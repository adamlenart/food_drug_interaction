    "0": "In a randomized double-blind study of 175 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, oxprenolol hydrochloride (160-480 mg) given once daily was compared with the same drug given twice daily for efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Of these patients, 123 (58 receiving the once daily regimen and 65 receiving the twice daily regimen) were included in the analysis of efficacy. Both groups showed similar significant (p less than 0.01) reductions in mean blood pressure during the 6-week titration period and for the remainder of the trial. A comparison of mean standing diastolic blood pressure and supine systolic and diastolic blood presses showed no significant difference between groups during the fixed dosage period. The number of patients reporting adverse experiences was not significantly different for the two regimens. Plasma triglycerides increased in both groups, but there were no other laboratory abnormalities related to treatment. This study shows that oxprenolol given once daily is effective, safe, and well tolerated in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "1": "Refeeding 3-day-fasted rats with 40 kJ carbohydrate (CHO; corn flour) or protein (gelatin) caused a rise in plasma insulin levels 3 h later, but refeeding fat or injection of norepinephrine (400 micrograms/kg) had no effect. Injection of insulin (0.25 U) caused a 15% rise in metabolic rate 24 h later in fasted rats that could be inhibited by treatment with propranolol. Refeeding rats with a single CHO meal produced an increase in oxygen consumption (15%) 24 h later that was inhibited by injection of diazoxide or 2-deoxy-D-glucose given at the time of the meal. The thermogenic response to insulin injection was unaffected by treatment with diazoxide or 2-deoxy-D-glucose. Genetically obese Zucker rats failed to increase metabolic rate after insulin or CHO. In normally fed lean rats, maintained on a stock diet or a palatable cafeteria diet, insulin (4 U) enhanced the thermogenic response to norepinephrine and stimulated resting metabolic rate (16%) in the cafeteria-fed rats. These data suggest that insulin is involved in the thermogenic responses to food and catecholamines.", 
    "2": "Nadolol, 120 and 240 mg daily, reduced essential tremor in a placebo-controlled double-blind study. The effect was observed in patients who had previously responded to propranolol but not in those who had not benefited from propranolol therapy.", 
    "3": "The effect of zinc on serum glucose, insulin and glucagon as well as liver glycogen was investigated in normal, adrenalectomized (ADX), and diabetic rats. Serum glucose was significantly elevated within 15 minutes after intraperitoneal administration of zinc (25 mumol) but returned to normal limits within 4 hours. Similar effects on serum glucose were noted with orally administered zinc. Significant depletion of hepatic glycogen in zinc-treated rats suggests glycogenolysis was responsible at least in part for the increased blood glucose. Adrenalectomy completely eliminated the hyperglycemic response to this metal, whereas adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol was effective in preventing hyperglycemia. The hyperglycemic response to zinc was not eliminated in diabetic rats. Administration of dexamethasone, alone or in combination with zinc, was unable to change serum glucose concentrations in ADX rats. Plasma glucagon was significantly elevated within 15 minutes but was reduced 6 hours after zinc treatment. Insulin was significantly depressed within 30 minutes after administration of zinc and eventually increased over controls by 4 hours after treatment. These data suggest that the hyperglycemic response to zinc depends on a mechanism, requiring an intact adrenal gland, which acts to produce a rapid alteration in blood glucose.", 
    "4": "Several studies report a substantial rise in plasma catecholamines after caffeine. Epinephrine infusion induces a pressor response after nonselective beta-blockade. We studied the hemodynamic and humoral effects of drinking coffee after placebo and after both nonselective (propranolol) and beta 1-selective (metoprolol) blockade in 12 normotensive subjects. After placebo, coffee induced a rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a fall in heart rate, whereas forearm blood flow did not change. Plasma catecholamines, especially epinephrine (+150%), rose and plasma renin activity, fell after drinking coffee. The effects of coffee on blood pressure, forearm blood flow, and all humoral parameters were not altered by pretreatment with propranolol or metoprolol. The fall in heart rate after coffee, however, seemed to be greater during propranolol. We conclude that the rise in plasma epinephrine after coffee was too small to reveal differences in reaction in propranolol- and metoprolol-pretreated subjects.", 
    "5": "This study determines, with quantitative variables, if propranolol is detrimental in patients with documented coronary arterial spasm and if this drug can be used in combination with calcium antagonists. Eleven patients with documented coronary spasm were entered prospectively in a study with 4 phases of 2 days each: (1) control, (2) diltiazem or propranolol (mean 225 +/- 75 mg/day), (3) propranolol or diltiazem (360 mg/day), (4) propranolol and diltiazem. The effects of the drugs were assessed by the detection of ischemic electrocardiographic episodes (24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring) and provocative tests with ergonovine. During the period of treatment with propranolol, the number and the duration of attacks increased and provocative tests had positive results in all patients. Diltiazem completely abolished spontaneous episodes, but 6 of 11 patients remained sensitive to the administration of ergonovine. The association of the 2 drugs led to a disappearance of ischemic episodes. In conclusion, propranolol is ineffective in patients with coronary artery spasm. It can be used in combination with diltiazem, but without any advantage over diltiazem alone.", 
    "6": "In a double-blind crossover trial, 15 captopril (daily dose 600 mg) treated patients received in addition to the converting enzyme inhibitor, placebo, propranolol (240 mg), or bendroflumethiazide (7.5 mg). Propranolol produced an additional hypotensive effect, while pulse rate slowed, indicating effective beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Plasma renin activity decreased, but the hypotensive effect of propranolol was not accompanied by changes in the plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone levels or in the urinary aldosterone excretion. Also bendroflumethiazide lowered blood pressure, while body weight decreased slightly. During captopril-bendroflumethiazide treatment, serum sodium and potassium decreased while the plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated. In these captopril-treated patients, the hypotensive response to bendroflumethiazide tended to be somewhat larger than the response to propranolol, but the difference was small and statistically not significant.", 
    "7": "A prospective randomized study comparing coronary bypass surgery (group 1, 51 patients) to drug therapy (group 2, 49 patients) was initiated in 1981. Supine graded exercise testing (SGXT) was performed initially, at 6 months, and annually with a bicycle ergometer. The presence or absence of ischemic ST segment changes (positive or negative SGXT) and chest pain were recorded. Initially, 63% of all patients had positive SGXT. For group 2, the frequency of positive SGXT results did not change significantly at 6 months (58%) or at 5 years (52%). At 6 months the number of patients without chest pain increased in group 1 compared with group 2 (28/41 vs 13/41, respectively; p less than .002), but there was no difference in the frequency of positive SGXT results (20/41 vs 24/41, respectively; p = NS). This occurred because a majority of the group 1 patients with positive SGXT no longer had associated chest pain (group 1, 11/20, group 2, 3/24; p less than .007). This response was associated with incomplete revascularization in eight of these 11 group 1 patients and may result from \"silent ischemia.\" At 5 years, no significant difference existed in the incidence of positive SGXT (group 1, 10/32 vs group 2, 12/23; p = NS), but group 1 patients continued to have a reduction (although not statistically significant) in the number of patients without chest pain (group 1, 19/32 vs group 2, 7/23). The incidences of death and myocardial infarction were not significantly different between groups. Fewer episodes of unstable angia occurred in group 1 (10/51 vs 19/49; p less than .05). The prognosis of group 1 patients with positive SGXT and no chest pain and incomplete revascularization was not different from that of the entire group.", 
    "8": "Catecholamines (isoproterenol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline) elicited a small decrease in the resting potential of guinea-pig ventricular muscle cells depolarized by 27 mM K. This catecholamine-induced depolarization (CAD) was enhanced and often led to an automatic activity, when the membrane shunting conductance was reduced by application of 0.05 to 0.2 mM Ba. CAD was blocked by Mn (1 to 2 mM), verapamil (0.5 to 1 X 10(-5) M), and propranolol (0.1 to 1 X 10(-5) M), but not by phentolamine (10(-5) M). CAD did not develop when both Ca and Ba were absent in the bathing solution, but persisted when Sr was present. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CAD was due at least partly to an increase in the slow channel conductance that was initiated by catecholamine/beta-receptor interaction. CAD was markedly enhanced at low temperatures (21 to 25 degrees C), and such was characterized by slow repolarization after drug withdrawal. Propranolol, when applied after catecholamine, exerted no appreciable effect on this slow repolarization. This beta-blocker abolished CAD at low temperature, if applied prior to catecholamine. Methylxanthines (2 to 5 mM caffeine or theophylline) produced a depolarization similar to that seen with CAD, and the rate of repolarization after drug withdrawal also slowed at low temperature. The slow repolarization of CAD at low temperature appeared to reflect a slowing in the postreceptor metabolic processes responsible for deactivation of the slow channel that was sensitive to beta-receptor stimulation.", 
    "9": "The renin release responses to 1 and 5 min of renal nerve stimulation were determined. The left kidneys of alpha-chlorolose-anesthetized cats were pump perfused with blood while stimulating the decentralized renal nerves at different frequencies (0.5 ms, 10 V). With renal blood flow (RBF) held constant, 1 min of renal nerve stimulation increased renin secretion rate (RSR) at 1.0 (128%), 4.0 (168%) and 12.0 (160%) Hz. After 5 min of stimulation the responses were not different. Propranolol pretreatment prevented the increase in RSR at 1.0 Hz, and resulted in decreased RSR at 4.0 and 12.0 Hz. This response pattern occurred after 1 and 5 min of renal nerve stimulation. When renal perfusion pressure (RPP) was held constant, RSR at 1 min into the stimulation period was similar to that found in the constant RBF group. However, after 5 min the 4.0 Hz and 12.0 Hz responses were significantly greater than the 1 min responses (242% and 508%). Propranolol pretreatment resulted in renin responses after 1 min of stimulation which were similar to the beta-blocked constant RBF group. After 5 min of stimulation at 4.0 and 12.0 Hz RSR was greater than control levels. The results illustrate that renal nerve evoked renin release is time-dependent under constant RPP conditions. The data indicate the presence of 3 mechanisms in these responses. A beta-adrenergic receptor operates at all frequencies to increase renin release. When renal vasoconstriction occurs additional mechanisms are involved. One is inhibitory, independent of renal hemodynamic conditions and rapidly activated. The second is excitatory, occurs only under constant RPP conditions, and is activated slowly.", 
    "10": "The distribution of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in guinea-pig airways has been studied by radioligand binding assays and analysis of mechanical responses. Binding studies with the ligands [3H]-dihydroalprenolol and [125I]-cyanopindolol, revealed that beta-adrenoceptors were unevenly distributed throughout the airways with the highest density located in the parenchyma and the lowest density in the trachea. The relative proportion of beta 1:beta 2-adrenoceptor binding sites was assessed by computer-assisted analysis of the inhibition curves generated by selective agents. It was virtually identical in each region and in the order of 15:85%. beta-Adrenoceptor agonists caused concentration-dependent relaxations of both tracheal spirals and parenchymal lung strips. This response appeared to be mediated by both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in tracheal spirals as the pA2 value for the beta 1-selective antagonist, atenolol, varied depending upon which agonist was used, and, in the presence of the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551, noradrenaline and isoprenaline produced biphasic concentration-effect curves. In parenchymal lung strips only the one subtype was involved as antagonist pA2 values were not dependent on the agonist used and the properties were consistent with those expected for a beta 2-adrenoceptor.", 
    "11": "The leukotrienes (LT's) are a group of arachidonic acid derivatives implicated as mediators of allergic bronchoconstriction and acute inflammation. Tracheal spirals and strips of lung parenchyma from guinea pigs were used under non-flow conditions to characterize the contractions caused by LTA4, LTB4 and LTC4. Cumulative administrations of leukotrienes desensitized the lung strip, whereas non-cumulative dose-response relationships for the leukotrienes and histamine were reasonably parallel. Half maximal contractions of the lung strips were obtained at a final bath concentration of 1 nM for LTC4 and 300 nM for LTA4 or LTB4, as compared with 6 000 nM for histamine. In the trachea, LTC4 was approximately 100 times more potent than LTA4 and histamine. Leukotrienes B4 and C4, but not acetylcholine or histamine, elicited release of the bronchoconstrictive thromboxane A2 from the lung under non-flow conditions. Indomethacin blocked the contractile response to LTB4, whereas the contractile effect of LTC4 remained unaltered. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol and the LTC4 antagonist FPL 55712 attenuated the contraction, but not the release of thromboxane A2, induced by LTC4. Changing to a perifusion technique rendered the lung strips less sensitive to the direct action of LTC4, and released thromboxane A2 now contributed significantly to the contractile response. In addition, the perifusion experiments indicated that LTB4 released histamine as well. We conclude that the chemoattractant LTB4 is an indirectly acting bronchoconstrictor, whereas the slow reacting substance LTC4 contracts the airway muscle by a predominantly direct mechanism. The exquisite bronchoconstrictive activity of LTC4 may be unrelated to its ability to induce formation of thromboxane A2.", 
    "12": "Adult male rats were treated chronically with haloperidol (1 mg/kg) daily or propranolol (10 mg/kg bid) and evaluated for changes in shock-induced fighting. Haloperidol suppressed fighting. Chronic propranolol facilitated fighting when rats were tested eight hours after injection. Acutely, either 5 or 10 mg/kg of d,1-propranolol suppressed shock-induced fighting. Chronic pindolol (10 mg/kg bid) and chronic 1-propranolol (5 mg/kg bid) administration increased fighting. Chronic d,1-propranolol, 1-propranolol or pindolol administration was associated with an increase in Bmax for beta-adrenergic receptors. No change in fighting or Bmax was observed with the chronic administration of d-propranolol (5 mg/kg bid) or metoprolol (10 mg/kg bid). This increase in shock-induced fighting appears to be a behavioral response developing as a consequence of increased beta-adrenergic receptors responding to endogenously released norepinephrine.", 
    "13": "Binding characteristics of the beta-blockers and beta-agonists with the beta-adrenoceptors were investigated in 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) binding to rat heart membranes treated with neuraminidase. When 60% of the total sialic acid content in the membranes was removed, reproducibility of the binding assay became much better than was attainable without neuraminidase treatment, and the maximum density of beta-adrenoceptors was increased. These data suggest that the binding of the test compounds with the beta-adrenergic receptors in cardiac muscle was under the influence of the sialic acid of the glycocalyx of the membrane. The 3H-DHA binding sites in membranes treated with neuraminidase showed a strict stereo-specificity when tested with propranolol. The ranking order of inhibition of beta-antagonists or agonists is: dl-propranolol greater than oxprenolol greater than alprenolol greater than pindolol greater than YM-09538 greater than labetalol greater than acebutolol greater than atenolol greater than metoprolol greater than sotalol greater than butoxamine greater than practolol as antagonists or l-isoproterenol greater than l-epinephrine greater than l-norepinephrine as agonists. A good correlation (r = 0.91, P less than 0.001) was observed between the Ki values observed by the present binding assay and the pA2 observed in the guinea-pig atria relative to the positive inotropic effect by Bieth et al. (Br. J. Pharmacol. 68, 563-569, 1980), indicating that the present method will be useful for screening new beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists or agonists.", 
    "14": "The actions of the adrenergic blocking agents propranolol and phentolamine upon the responses of 124-135 days fetal sheep to hypoxia induced by causing pregnant ewes to breathe 9% O2 and 3% CO2 in N2 have been studied. During hypoxia fetal heart rate fell and any tendency for this to return was prevented by propranolol and stimulated by phentolamine. The ability of the fetal heart rate to return during hypoxia appears to be related to the rise in plasma catecholamines. Hypoxia induced increases in plasma ACTH and cortisol and in plasma metabolites appear to have the same characteristics as those changes induced by catecholamine infusion; the former being largely an alpha-receptor effect and the latter being beta-receptor mediated. The results indicate but do not prove that many of the fetal responses to hypoxia could be caused by the rise in plasma catecholamines.", 
    "15": "Physiological finger tremor has been assessed as an indicator of beta-adrenoceptor function. Tremor was not correlated with the sex, age, weight or height of the subjects and was stable over 5 min when the hand and fingers were held horizontally. It was not increased by mental arithmetic, the Valsalva manoeuvre or 3 min exercise. Satisfactory dose-response curves could be constructed for the isoprenaline enhanced increases in finger tremor. In six subjects, practolol 120 mg produced a small shift to the right of the isoprenaline dose-response curve for finger tremor (dose ratio 2.1) but propranolol 40 mg was seven times more effective (dose ratio 17.1). Physiological finger tremor appears to be a stable parameter which may be useful in the investigation of the selectivity of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs.", 
    "16": "In order to elucidate the mode of action of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists in essential tremor, the efficacy of chronic oral administration of metoprolol, atenolol and sotalol was compared in a randomised, double-blind placebo controlled trial in twenty-four patients. Only sotalol proved superior to placebo on both subjective and \"objective\" assessments. Metoprolol and sotalol produced comparable degrees of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism as judged by the blockade of standing tachycardia. Atenolol, in the dose used, produced a trend towards a greater cardiac chronotropic effect. These findings provide no support for the concept that central or peripheral beta 1-adrenoreceptor mechanisms are important in essential tremor. The beneficial effect of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists may be mediated predominantly through peripheral beta 2-adrenoreceptor mechanisms.", 
    "17": "The effect of beta-blockade on glycogen metabolism during isometric and dynamic exercise in humans has been investigated. Isometric exercise increased the glycogenolytic rate in muscle but had no effect on the cAMP content. Neither the metabolic pattern nor the time of contraction was affected by beta-blockade. Dynamic exercise increased the cAMP content in muscle by about 100%. The cAMP content at rest was significantly reduced after propranolol infusion and did not increase during exercise. Total hexosemonophosphates increased sixfold during exercise but little or no increase occurred after administration of propranolol. The accumulation of lactate in muscle was slightly reduced during exercise following beta-blockade. The fraction of phosphorylase in the alpha form was 22.5% of the total at rest but decreased to 16% at exhaustion. Synthetase I was similarly decreased. During exercise with propranolol phosphorylase alpha decreased further to 3%, whereas synthetase I was unchanged. It is concluded that beta-blockade has no effect on muscle glycogenolysis during isometric contraction but decreases the rate of glycogen degradation during dynamic exercise at high work loads due to changes in the phosphorylase-synthetase system.", 
    "18": "We examined beta-adrenergic receptor density, basal, maximal isoproterenol and fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities, and morphologic characteristics of rabbit and rat native and heterotopic isograft cardiac tissue. Four weeks after graft placement there were only subtle histologic differences between native and graft tissue. Membrane preparations from isografts of rabbits demonstrated increases in beta-receptor density (maximum [3H]DHA binding = 111 +/- 19.3 fmol/mg versus 52.4 +/- 4.9 in native hearts, p less than 0.05). In a small number of experiments, rat isografts also demonstrated a suggestive increase in beta-receptor density (69.8 +/- 7.1 fmol/mg versus 40.2 +/- 7.3 in native hearts). Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was greater in rabbit graft hearts (3.98 +/- 0.20 X basal activity) than in native tissue 2.67 +/- 0.16 X basal activity, p less than 0.05). We conclude that cardiac denervation may lead to a postsynaptic form of beta-adrenergic supersensitivity that is due to an increase in beta-receptor density.", 
    "19": "Other investigators have claimed that norepinephrine does not evoke a significant alpha adrenergic inotropic effect in rabbit ventricular myocardium in contrast to some other mammalian species, indicating an important functional limitation of the cardiac alpha adrenoceptors. We therefore characterized the inotropic effects of norepinephrine in isometrically contracting rabbit papillary muscles. We studied both contraction and relaxation by measuring developed tension and its first and second derivatives. Both the influence of propranolol and prazosin on concentration-effect curves of norepinephrine and the qualitative characteristics of the responses revealed that norepinephrine evoked both alpha and beta adrenergic inotropic effects. The alpha adrenergic response to norepinephrine was qualitatively markedly different from the beta adrenergic effect and qualitatively similar to the alpha adrenergic effect of phenylephrine which was also characterized for comparison. Although the alpha adrenergic response to norepinephrine was marked, the beta adrenergic effect was the dominating one when norepinephrine was administered alone. Thus, the beta adrenergic effect had to be extensively blocked to reveal the prazosin-sensitive alpha-1 adrenergic response. It is concluded that also in rabbit papillary muscles, norepinephrine evokes inotropic effects through both alpha and beta adrenoceptors.", 
    "20": "Radioactive photoaffinity labels have been used to probe the cardiac glycoside-binding site of Na,K-ATPase and the catecholamine-binding site of the beta-adrenergic receptor. For the Na,K-ATPase, a systematic positioning of the photoactive group on the first, second, and third digitoxoses of digitoxin showed that the specific radioactivity in the alpha subunit decreased 5- to 20-fold as the photoactive group was extended further away from the steroid nucleus, whereas the beta subunit is positioned very close to the alpha subunit in the region of the cardiac glycoside-binding site. For the beta-adrenergic receptor, a new class of orthoiodophenylazide derivatives of pindolol was prepared with carrier-free 125I. Photolysis of the beta-adrenergic receptor of duck, turkey, pigeon, and frog erythrocyte membrane with one of these compounds (iodoazidobenzylpindolol) allowed identification of the receptor polypeptides. It was found that the size of the polypeptides and the number of polypeptides varied.", 
    "21": "The goal of these experiments was to determine if isoproterenol-stimulated renin secretion in the rat is mediated by activation of beta 1- and/or beta 2-adrenoceptors. The rat renal cortical slice preparation was used. The renin secretory rate was a sigmoid function of the logarithm of the isoproterenol concentration; half-maximal and maximal stimulation occurred at approximately 0.01 and 0.1 microM isoproterenol, respectively. Neither timolol (a nonselective beta-antagonist) nor atenolol (a beta 1-selective antagonist) had a significant effect on basal secretory rate, but both shifted the isoproterenol dose-response curve to the right without changing its slope, suggesting competitive antagonism. Timolol was the more potent, but the response to a maximally effective concentration of isoproterenol could be blocked by timolol (0.9 microM), atenolol (110 microM), or a combination of the two (0.45 microM timolol plus 55 microM atenolol). This latter finding is consistent with action of the two antagonists at one and the same site. If it is assumed that timolol antagonizes both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors and that atenolol antagonizes only beta 1-adrenoceptors, it follows that isoproterenol-stimulated renin secretion in this preparation is mediated by activation of beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "22": "The influence of heart size on the effect of long term timolol treatment with regard to mortality and reinfarction after myocardial infarction was examined among 1881 patients randomised to either active or placebo treatment. The patients were followed for 12 to 33 months. At the baseline, heart size was determined by x-ray film in two projections: 1199 patients had normal heart size, 262 had borderline heart size, and 420 had enlarged hearts. The incidence of total cardiac death was three times greater in patients with enlarged hearts compared with patients with normal size hearts. The incidence of non-fatal reinfarctions, however, was independent of heart size at baseline. The timolol related reduction of total cardiac death compared with placebo was 40.7% in patients with normal heart size, 47.8% in patients with borderline heart size, and 38.2% in patients with enlarged hearts at baseline (intention to treat approach). The reduction of first non-fatal reinfarctions in the timolol group compared with placebo was, respectively, 31.7%, 41.2%, and 25.9%. Thus, timolol treatment appears to reduce cardiac death and non-fatal reinfarctions after myocardial infarction independent of heart size at baseline. Timolol treatment may be of special importance in patients with cardiomegaly, because of the very high incidence of cardiac mortality in this group of patients, and consequently a larger number of cardiac deaths may be prevented.", 
    "23": "Effects of a new adrenergic beta-blocking agent, arotinolol (S-596), on the blood pressure and heart rate were assessed in comparison with those of other beta-blocking agents in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-saline induced and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The relationship between the antihypertensive effect and the beta- or alpha-adrenoceptor blocking action of S-596 was also investigated in normotensive conscious rats. In the rat, a cannula was implanted chronically in a femoral artery, from which blood pressure was recorded. The test drugs were administered orally once a day for 14 days at several dose levels. The development of hypertension in DOCA-saline treated rats was clearly retarded with the consecutive oral administration of propranolol (100 mg/kg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg/day), but not with S-596 (20, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day) or pindolol (10 mg/kg/day). On the other hand, in SHR, S-596 (more than 10 mg/kg/day) propranolol (50 mg/kg/day), pindolol (10 mg/kg/day), labetalol (100 mg/kg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg/day) produced definite antihypertensive effects after the chronic administration. In normotensive conscious rats, the vasodepressor responses induced by isoproterenol were reduced by the beta-blocking agents at lower dose levels than those required for development of antihypertensive effects. The acute effects on blood pressure were determined in hypertensive rats during the chronic treatment with the test drugs. In either type of hypertension, S-596, (10-50 mg/kg/day) showed a depressor effect at 4 and/or 8 hr after administration. In normotensive conscious rats, S-596 antagonized the pressor responses to phenylephrine at doses more than 30 mg/kg. It is therefore suggested that an adrenergic alpha-blocking property is at least partly involved in the hypotensive effect of S-596 as labetalol. In the experiment of acute effect in SHR, pindolol and labetalol showed prominent hypotensive effect after the 1st administration, but lesser effect after the 10th administration. Propranolol showed a marked rise in blood pressure in this experiment.", 
    "24": "In order to investigate the actions of acetylcholine (ACh), catecholamines and substance P on K transport in the submaxillary gland, measurements of net K flux to and from the gland tissue using flame photometry, Na efflux from the tissue using radioactive 22Na, and membrane potential and input resistance using micro-electrodes were carried out on isolated superfused segments of rat and mouse submaxillary glands. ACh (5.5 X 10(-8) to 5.5 X 10(-4) M), phenylephrine (5 X 10(-7) to 5 X 10(-4) M) or substance P (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) stimulation for 5 min induced a transient K release followed by a small K uptake after the cessation of stimulation. The K release was markedly enhanced by the simultaneous addition of ouabain (10(-3) M). On the other hand, isoprenaline (2.5 X 10(-9) to 2.5 X 10(-5) M) induced a transient K uptake without any preceding K release. The K uptake was completely blocked by the addition of ouabain. Noradrenaline induced only K uptake at a low concentration (3 X 10(-7) M), but induced transient K release followed by marked K uptake at higher concentrations (3 X 10(-6) to 3 X 10(-4) M). The K release induced by noradrenaline was suppressed by the addition of phentolamine (10(-5) M), while the K uptake was suppressed by propranolol (5 X 10(-6) M). The K release induced by ACh, phenylephrine, noradrenaline or substance P was severely reduced by Ca omission from the superfusing solution and restored by the re-admission of Ca. The isoprenaline- or noradrenaline-induced K uptake was, however, little affected by Ca omission. Application of isoprenaline (2.5 X 10(-6) M) induced an increase in 22 Na efflux. The increase in 22Na efflux was completely abolished in the presence of ouabain. Local application to the tissue bath of isoprenaline (4.7 X 10(-13) to 4.7 X 10(-12) mole) or noradrenaline (5.7 X 10(-12) to 5.7 X 10(-11) mole) in the presence of phentolamine (10(-5) M) induced membrane hyperpolarization without any appreciable change in input resistance. The hyperpolarization was abolished in the presence of ouabain (10(-3) M) or propranolol (5 X 10(-6) M) or in a K-free or low Na solution. Higher doses of both agonists, however, induced depolarization or biphasic responses (initial depolarization followed by hyperpolarization). The depolarizations were accompanied by a moderate reduction in input resistance. It is concluded that in the rat and mouse submaxillary gland acinar cells cholinergic, alpha-adrenergic or substance P stimulation causes K release (and perhaps Na uptake) resulting in activation of the Na-K pump, while beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation might directly activate the Na-K pump resulting in K uptake, or might cause Na uptake resulting in activation of the Na-K pump.", 
    "25": "Simultaneous studies on the secretory response of amylase and the neurotransmitter receptors of rat parotid gland, after brief treatment with agonists, showed selective alteration in beta-adrenoceptors with specific change in amylase secretion, suggesting a regulatory role of the receptors in the secretory response. The beta-adrenergic agonist (+/-)-isoprenaline (IPR) stimulated amylase secretion from rat parotid tissues much more than did the same concentration of an alpha-adrenergic or cholinergic agonist. The stimulatory effects of IPR were studied by pre-treating rat parotid tissues with IPR for 10 min and then incubating the tissue in fresh medium for 10 min. Pre-treatment with 10 microM-IPR for 10 min resulted in increased amylase secretion during further incubation with IPR and also in a lower EC50 value of amylase secretion for IPR. This treatment also resulted in selective changes in the number and affinity of beta-adrenoceptors, assessed by measuring binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA): the maximal binding sites increased from 286/357 f-mole to mg protein and the IC50 value (the concentration for 50% inhibition of specific [3H]DHA binding) of beta-agonists, not antagonists, decreased significantly. An increase in the period of pre-treatment with IPR to 30 min resulted in a decrease in the maximal binding sites of beta-adrenoceptors and a decrease in amylase secretion during further incubation with IPR. Experiments with other agonists showed that supersensitivity of the secretory response was induced specifically by beta-agonists. Binding studies with [3H]WB-4101 and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate showed that alpha-adrenoceptors and muscarinic ACh receptors in rat parotid did not change under the conditions tested. The alteration in beta-adrenoceptors was parallel with a change in amylase secretion after IPR pre-treatment, but not with a change in cyclic AMP content.", 
    "26": "The effects of several beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, [+), (-) and (+/-)-oxprenolol, p-oxprenolol, practolol, propranolol and timolol) were investigated on the ventricular arrhythmias occurring within the first 30 min of acutely ligating the main left coronary artery in anaesthetized rats. The degree of cardiac and vascular beta-adrenoceptor blockade was also assessed. All the compounds exhibited antiarrhythmic activity under these conditions. The degree of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade required for this protection was less for the cardioselective agents, p-oxprenolol and practolol, than for the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. A comparison of the two isomers of oxprenolol demonstrated that the (-)-isomer markedly suppressed ischaemic arrhythmias (ventricular ectopic beats, incidence and duration of ventricular tachycardia and duration of ventricular fibrillation) more effectively than the (+)-isomer. Compounds possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) caused less marked haemodynamic changes (in equivalent beta-blocking doses) than those that did not possess this ancillary property. The membrane stabilizing activity of oxprenolol and p-oxprenolol did not appear to contribute to the antiarrhythmic activity of these agents; however, the membrane stabilizing activity of propranolol may contribute to its effectiveness. In all the drugs studied, the main pharmacological property required to suppress early postischaemic arrhythmias is blockade of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "27": "Four beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, namely (-)-propranolol, (+)-propranolol, ICI-118551 and (+/-)-practolol, were investigated for their effects on leukotriene C4 (LTC4)-induced bronchoconstriction in the anesthetized guinea-pig. (-)-Propranolol was also investigated for its effects on acetylcholine and histamine bronchospasm in the anaesthetized guinea-pig, and on LTC4-induced contractions of guinea-pig isolated trachea and lung parenchyma. The various beta-adrenoceptor antagonists potentiated, dose-dependently, the bronchoconstriction induced by threshold doses of LTC4 and the intensity of the potentiation correlated with the beta 2-blocking capacity possessed by the drugs. (-)-Propranolol potentiated the bronchospasm induced by threshold doses of acetylcholine and histamine but to a lesser degree than the LTC4-induced bronchospasm. The airway hyper-responsiveness induced by (-)-propranolol was unaffected by pretreatment with mepyramine, cyproheptadine, phenoxybenzamine, atropine or indomethacin. The airway hyper-responsiveness induced by (-)-propranolol persisted even in adrenalectomized or reserpine-treated guinea-pigs, although adrenalectomy induced some increase in airway responsiveness. (-)-Propranolol had no effect on LTC4, histamine and acetylcholine-induced contractions of isolated trachea and lung parenchyma. The results show that the airway hyper-responsiveness induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists generally correlates with their beta 2-blocking activity. The possibility remains that some other unknown mechanism(s) may also be implicated.", 
    "28": "In anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing guinea-pigs, enhanced bronchoconstrictor responses (increases RL) to histamine were measured following intravenous injection of practolol, (+/-)-propranolol, (+)- and (-)-propranolol. Propranolol enhanced not only histamine- but 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced bronchoconstrictions and its effects lasted up to 2 h. This increased airway sensitivity was not due to beta-adrenoceptor blockade because: (a) similar effects were produced by racemic propranolol and its two isomers (+)- and (-)-propranolol and (b) whilst equal doses of (+/-)- and (+)-propranolol produced the same potentiation of histamine bronchoconstriction, only (+/-)-propranolol also caused a measurable beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the airways. The enhanced histamine- and 5-HT-induced bronchoconstrictions were antagonized by the leukotriene antagonist FPL 55712 and by the lipoxygenase/cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor BW755c. The results demonstrate that endogenously released leukotrienes can produce not only a direct bronchospasm but may enhance the effects of other bronchoconstrictor agents. The relevance of this leukotriene-mediated hyperreactivity to the non-specific airway hyperreactivity seen in asthmatics is discussed.", 
    "29": "Prenalterol, a beta 1 selective agonist, exerts a positive inotropic action in animal studies as well as in human volunteers and is effective when administered orally. To assess its immediate haemodynamic and myocardial metabolic effects, we studied the response to prenalterol (50 and 100 micrograms kg-1 given intravenously by cardiac catheterization) in 15 patients with congestive heart failure secondary to coronary artery disease or non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. At peak effect, cardiac index increased from 2.6 +/- 0.5 to 3.2 +/- 0.8 l min-1 m2 (mean +/- S.D.) (P less than 0.001); peak rate of left ventricular pressure development rose from 963 +/- 242 to 1335 +/- 411 mmHg s-1 (P less than 0.001); left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 25 +/- 6 to 17 +/- 7 mgHg (P less than 0.001); coronary sinus blood flow increased from 113 +/- 39 to 148 +/- 55 ml min-1 (P less than 0.01); myocardial oxygen consumption was augmented from 12.7 +/- 3.9 to 16.4 +/- 5.8 ml min-1 (P less than 0.001); and heart rate increased slightly (from 76 +/- 12 to 86 +/- 14 beats min-1; (P less than 0.05)). No significant changes occurred in left ventricular systolic pressure, stroke volume index, myocardial lactate extraction rate and myocardial arteriovenous oxygen difference, and no patients developed angina, ECG changes or ventricular arrhythmias. Infusion of prenalterol effectively improved haemodynamic function and cardiac metabolism in cardiomyopathy. Therefore this agent deserves further investigation to evaluate its possible role for the long-term therapy of patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "30": "In a series of 8 patients with recently discovered moderate essential hypertension the blood-retinal barrier permeability to fluorescein was determined by aid of quantitative vitreous fluorophotometry before and after normalization of the systemic blood pressure. The permeability before medical treatment was 1.69 X 10(-7) cm/sec (+/- SEM = 0.14) and after medical treatment and normalization of the blood pressure 1.27 X 10(-7) cm/sec (+/- SEM = 0.12), corresponding to the permeability in a normal population. Thus the blood-retinal barrier permeability is pathologically increased even in moderate degrees of essential hypertension, but this increase in permeability is reversible.", 
    "31": "Prenalterol (levo-1-[4-hydroxyphenoxy]-3-isopropyl-amino-2-propanol), a new stimulant of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors in man, induces cardiovascular malformations when topically administered to 2 1/2- through 5 1/2-day chick embryos (Hamburger-Hamilton stages 17-27). Ventricular septal defects (VSD) located in the middle portion of the conal septum and classified as the simple, punched-out type VSD without septal malalignment were the predominant malformations observed throughout the developmental period tested. Arch malformations of the aortic circulation were also observed throughout the test interval, while anomalies of the pulmonary system were observed only at Hamburger-Hamilton stages 17 and 26-27. At stage 25 prenalterol demonstrated an acute toxicity significantly less than (1/50-1/20) epinephrine (P = .035 at concentrations of 8-10 mM) but was relatively equipotent with epinephrine in producing cardiovascular malformations. The effective median concentrations of the two agents were comparable (0.5-1.0 mM). The spectra of malformations induced by prenalterol and epinephrine were qualitatively similar. Malformations included absence of the right and/or left third aortic arch (innominate arteries), persistent remnant of the left fourth aortic arch, and VSD. These results support a previously proposed theory by these investigators that hyperstimulation of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors in the chick embryo produces cardiovascular malformations.", 
    "32": "The effect of acute unselective (propranolol) and beta 1-selective (atenolol) beta-adrenoceptor blockade was studied on alpine skiing in six leisure and seven elite skiers. Prior to the skiing tests a short time \"all out\" cycle ergometer test (Wingate muscle power test) was performed to confirm whether a beta-blocking effect (80 mg propranolol and 100 mg atenolol orally) was present or not. Peak and average power of the Wingate test showed an impairment in the order of 4%--6% (P less than 0.05--0.001). Peak blood lactate was only reduced after propranolol (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.01). During leisure skiing under submaximal exercise conditions peak blood lactate was increased (P less than 0.05) as compared to placebo, but rated perceived exertion (RPE) was unchanged as well as the estimated skiing technique. The elite skiers showed prolonged performance times (P less than 0.05) after beta-blockade and in the case of propranolol also reduced peak and mean blood lactates (P less than 0.05). It is suggested that during intense exercise propranolol reduced lactate formation, which is in line with previous reports. This might impair short time, \"explosive\" type muscular exercise. If there is a risk factor for injury during beta-blockade and alpine skiing, it might be connected to the impaired performance and metabolism in relation to intense exercise and propranolol treatment.", 
    "33": "Some of the more important recent studies on the effect of thiazides and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents is conflicting, possibly because of differences in patient compliance and in lipoprotein methodology and quality assurance between studies. It is likely that in the short-term, thiazide diuretics produce an increase in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol and in LDL-cholesterol. No consistent effect of monotherapy with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents was seen. Further long-term studies of monotherapy with both of these classes of drugs are required. Combined therapy with thiazides or beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents consistently increased plasma triglyceride concentrations, but their effect on VLDL, LDL and HDL concentrations is uncertain. Further research required into the effect of these drugs on apolipoproteins which may be useful discriminators for patients with coronary heart disease (Avogaro et al., 1979) and on HDL subfractions.", 
    "34": "Albetol treatment was administered to 31 patients with stable hypertension. The drug produced a drop in the heart rate, cardiac index and a slight decrease of total peripheral resistance, due to albetol simultaneous alpha- and beta-blocking action. There were no marked orthostatic changes. Blood pressure, cardiac index and heart rate values increased to a smaller extent in response to exercise. Experimental studies in the frog atrium showed different effects of Albetol and Propranolol on transmembrane ion currents. Albetol did not affect renal function at rest, nor the pattern of its change under physical stress and in an orthostatic position. It is suggested that albetol alpha-blocking action is predominant in the orthostatic test, while beta-blocking effect prevails during exercise.", 
    "35": "C.N.S.-induced suppression of muscle Na-pump activity was studied in fast 'twitch' muscle, extensor digitorum longus, of hypokalaemic rats which were fed a K-deficient diet for 0-9 weeks. The results were compared with those of slow 'tonic' muscle, soleus, reported previously. K-deficient diet caused blood hypokalaemia and a considerable K+ loss and Na+ accumulation in the skeletal, heart and smooth muscles. The cellular K+ loss was in the order of soleus greater than extensor digitorum longus greater than diaphragm greater than duodenum greater than auricle greater than ventricle; C.N.S. organs such as cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, spinal cord and liver were spared this K+ fall. Skeletal, heart and smooth muscles lost more K+ with prolongation of hypokalaemic periods, whereas plasma K+ concentration did not fall much below 1.6 mM during hypokalaemia. Peripheral nerve section, cervical and brain-stem transection, decerebration and cortical spreading depression with 20% KCl, which activated the active Na+ and K+ transport in soleus muscles during hypokalaemia, could not enhance the pump activity in extensor digitorum longus muscles. Alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists such as phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine and dibenamine and a specific blocker of post-synaptic alpha 1-adrenoreceptor, prazosin, did not stimulate Na+ and K+ transport in the extensor digitorum longus muscles during hypokalaemia while the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, propranolol, also had no effect. The sensitivity of the active Na+ and K+ transport system in rat muscles to ouabain applied intraperitoneally was greater in extensor digitorum longus muscles than in soleus muscles. The binding experiment with a radiolabelled ligand of alpha 1 adrenoreceptor antagonist, [3H]prazosin, demonstrated the presence of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors on the soleus muscle membranes of hypokalaemic rats, but not of normal rats. alpha 1 Adrenergic receptors were not detected on the extensor digitorum longus muscle membranes prepared from either hypokalaemic or normal rats. The correlation between the C.N.S.-induced inhibition on the Na pump in soleus muscle during hypokalaemia and the occurrence of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors on the muscle was discussed.", 
    "36": "Pharmacologic beta-adrenergic blockade reduces maximal heart rate (HR) during exercise but variable results have been reported for minute ventilation (VE), CO2 output (VCO2), and O2 uptake (VO2). A total group of 19 subjects with mild asthma was studied. We studied 16 subjects from the group who received placebo or pindolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, during 1-min incremental exercise on a cycle ergometer. During incremental exercise, HR, VE, VCO2, and VO2 were less after beta-blockade than after placebo at the same work rate below the anaerobic threshold. Maximal HR, VE, VO2, VCO2, and work rate were significantly less after beta-blockade. In addition, we studied six subjects from the group, including three who had also performed incremental exercise, during the steady state of constant-work cycling exercise. We found no difference in VE, VCO2, or VO2 although HR was less after beta-blockade. We conclude that beta-adrenergic blockade affects gas exchange by delaying the normal cardiovascular response to exercise. Decreased VE during incremental exercise is due to slowed delivery of CO2 load to the lungs rather than alterations in substrate, lung function, or ventilatory control.", 
    "37": "A double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out to examine the contribution of propranolol as an adjunct to neuroleptic medication in the treatment of chronic schizophrenic patients whose florid symptoms had not remitted with neuroleptic medication alone. Propranolol was shown to have a more beneficial effect than placebo, but the results were much less dramatic than those which have been described in previous studies. Recent work has shown that there may be a pharmacokinetic interaction between propranolol and neuroleptics, and this should be considered as one possible explanation of our findings.", 
    "38": "Six healthy subjects were studied on two occasions. Graded bolus injections of isoprenaline sulphate were given intravenously and control dose-response curves were drawn for the changes in heart rate and blood pressure. In a random order each subject received an intravenous infusion of either propranolol or practolol and further dose-response curves were constructed PRE- and POST-atropine (0.04 mg/kg). Exercise tachycardia was reduced 26.1 +/- 2.7% by propranolol and this was not significantly different from the reduction by practolol (21.2 +/- 1.9%). Propranolol attenuated the isoprenaline tachycardia (dose ratio 43.7) and after atropinisation the dose ratio was not significantly altered (41.1). Practolol also attenuated the isoprenaline tachycardia (dose ratio 4.4) but after atropinisation the dose ratio was significantly increased to 8.8, though this remained significantly less than the dose ratio for propranolol. At a heart rate increase of 25 beats/min, the isoprenaline-induced control fall in mean blood pressure was 9-11 mm Hg. After propranolol administration this fall was converted to a small increase of + 2.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg. Following practolol, however, the mean blood pressure reduction was 19.7 +/- 2.9 mm Hg. Practolol did not significantly block the isoprenaline-induced fall in diastolic pressure. The difference in potency of propranolol and practolol, demonstrated by their effect on isoprenaline induced tachycardia at doses shown to have equal effects on exercise tachycardia, is contributed to but not fully explained by the reflex withdrawal of cardiac vagal tone which occurs with cardioselective but not non-selective antagonists.", 
    "39": "The possible role for adrenergic influences or prostaglandins in the effects of endotoxin to inhibit the glucocorticoid induction of hepatic tryptophan oxygenase (TO) activity, to decrease the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P--450-dependent drug-metabolizing activity, and to induce heme oxygenase activity was examined. Administration of the alpha-adrenergic locking agents phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine attenuated the inhibitory effect of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide on the induction of TO activity by dexamethasone. Injection of a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, or of indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis, accentuated the effect of endotoxin to inhibit TO induction. Neither phenoxybenzamine, propranolol, nor indomethacin altered the effect of endotoxin to decrease aniline hydroxylase activity, ethylmorphine N-demethylase activity, or the levels of cytochrome P--450. Also, dexamethasone administration did not significantly protect against the effects of endotoxin on the hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme system, and none of the pharmacological agents diminished the effects of endotoxin to induce hepatic heme oxygenase activity. Endotoxin administration was also shown to diminish, but not prevent, the induction of cytochrome P--450 and ethylmorphine N-demethylase activity produced by phenobarbital. The results indicate that alpha-adrenergic mechanisms are involved in the endotoxic inhibition of the glucocorticoid induction of TO activity and suggest that neither adrenergic influences nor prostaglandins play a significant role in the effect of endotoxin to decrease hepatic mixed-function oxidase activity.", 
    "40": "Human myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors were directly identified and characterized using the high affinity antagonist radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol. Beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors were found to coexist in both the left ventricle and right atrium. The relative proportions of the two receptor subtypes were determined by the use of competition radioligand binding and computer modelling techniques employing the subtype selective agents atenolol (beta 1 selective) and zinterol (beta 2 selective). The left ventricle contains 86 +/- 1% beta 1 and 14 +/- 1% beta 2 adrenergic receptors while the right atrium contains 74 +/- 6% beta 1 and 26 +/- 6% beta 2 adrenergic receptors. The direct demonstration of beta 2 adrenergic receptors in the human heart, with a higher proportion in the right atrium agrees with pharmacologic data and supports the notion that chronotropic effects of adrenergic agonists in man may be mediated by both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors.", 
    "41": "The ability of 1-(5-chloracetylaminobenzfuran-2-yl)-2-isopropylaminoethanol (Ro03-7894) to irreversibly inactivate beta-adrenoreceptors was studied. In isolated rat atria Ro03-7894 (500 microM) depressed and shifted the tension development curve for isoproterenol to the right. After a 2 hour washout period the dose response curve for isoproterenol was further depressed. At a lower dose of Ro03-7894 (50 microM), the isoproterenol dose response curve was also depressed and shifted to the right although after a 2 hour washout, the sensitivity to isoproterenol was restored but the maximum response was still depressed. Ro03-7894 (50 microM) also depressed the tension development response to increasing concentrations of external calcium. The concentration of Ro03-7894 that inhibited (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding by 50% in cardiac and lung membranes was 20 microM. Incubation of rat ventricular or lung membranes for 1 hour with 100 microM Ro03-7894 followed by washing did not change the concentration of beta-adrenoreceptors or the KD values for [3H]DHA binding. Furthermore, neither the concentration of beta-adrenoreceptors nor the KD for [3H]DHA binding was changed in cardiac and lung membranes at 4 or 24 hours after an i.p. injection of 20 mg/kg of Ro03-7894. The results suggested that Ro03-7894 was a relatively weak beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist which under the conditions used did not irreversibly inactivate the receptor but probably depressed tension development in intact atria nonspecifically.", 
    "42": "Various ethylenediamine derivatives have been incorporated into the nitrogen substituent of certain short-acting (aryloxy)propanolamine systems that contain esters on their aryl functions. Although several of these compounds showed durations of action comparable to their prototypes, most of the nitrogen substituents significantly prolonged the duration of beta-adrenergic blockade. Similarly, while one of the compounds showed appreciable cardioselectivity in vitro, generally, little enhancement of cardioselectivity was obtained. A brief discussion of structure-activity relationships observed for the ethylenediamine derivatives is presented.", 
    "43": "We have shown recently that norepinephrine stimulates muscle cell hypertrophy in primary cultures from the neonatal rat ventricle and that this stimulation is not blocked by the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol. The present study was done to define the adrenergic specificity of the myocyte hypertrophic response to norepinephrine. 90% pure, single-cell cultures of nongrowing myocytes were maintained in serum-free medium 199 with transferin and insulin. Myocyte size was quantitated 48 h after addition of adrenergic agents, by measuring cell volume, cell surface area, and cell protein. L-norepinephrine increased myocyte size to a maximum 150% of control; half-maximum effect was obtained at a concentration of 0.2 microM. This increase in cell size was inhibited by the nonselective alpha adrenergic antagonist phentolamine and by the alpha 1 adrenergic antagonists prazosin and terazosin; it was not inhibited by propranolol or by the alpha 2 adrenergic antagonist yohimbine. The beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol did not increase cell size. Thus, norepinephrine-stimulated hypertrophy of cultured rat myocardial cells is an alpha 1 adrenergic response.", 
    "44": "The medications currently used to treat generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and phobic disorders are reviewed, and research comparing their relative efficacies and use in conjunction with nonpharmacologic approaches is discussed. Although there is increasing public and professional interest in these disorders and their treatment, available research does not yet provide conclusive evidence that would permit more specific treatment recommendations, particularly in generalized anxiety disorder. A possible hierarchy of approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders is presented and the need for further research in specific areas is identified.", 
    "45": "Rabbit corneal epithelial cell cultures were established from Dispase-treated anterior corneas. In culture medium containing cholera toxin, insulin and epidermal growth factor, these cells proliferated in vitro in the absence of any contaminating cells. Following subculture, cells retained epithelial morphology and the ability to synthesize cAMP in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation, but lacked the ability to respond to serotonergic stimulation. Retention of the beta-adrenergic system in culture serves as a functional epithelial cell marker; whereas expression of serotonergic responsiveness may be regulated by developmental or extrapithelial systems that are absent in these cell cultures.", 
    "46": "We examined the impact of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs on the sensitivity and specificity of radionuclide ventriculography in 95 patients with angiographically proved coronary disease and in 22 angiographically normal subjects. Sixty of the former and seven of the latter were receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents. All had normal regional and global left ventricular function at rest. Exercise-induced asynergy and failure of exercise to increase ejection fraction by at least 0.05 were considered abnormal findings. The specificity of the criterion, failure to increase ejection fraction, was so impaired (0.87 vs 0.29) by these agents as to negate the usefulness of that observation for the diagnosis of coronary disease. The utility of the ejection fraction measurement to assess the severity of occlusive disease is also compromised, since that response is ameliorated by these drugs. An exercise-induced decline in ejection fraction of at least 0.05 was observed significantly less frequently in patients receiving beta blockers (30% vs 54%; p less than 0.025).", 
    "47": "The shooting results of 26 soldiers were evaluated in comparison between 3 shots without previous administration of tablets and 3 shots after administration of one tablet Inderal 40 mg respectively one placebo. After administration of Inderal there was an improvement of 26.71 percent and after placebo one of 14.29 percent; that means a real Inderal-effectuated improvement of more than 12.5 percent. A separated evaluation corresponding to the situation of the pulse (normal or high) before the first shot proved a more considerable better result: rifle-men with anxiety, restlessness and high pulse showed after Inderal a 58 percent improvement of the accuracy of fire. So it seems proven that Inderal shows already in lower doses a favourable result in sense of anxiolysis and tranquillizing without disagreeable sedative or hypnotic side effects.", 
    "48": "Markedly elevated nighttime concentrations of serotonin in rhesus monkey cerebrospinal fluid were reduced to daytime levels by exposing the monkeys to continuous light or to the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Nighttime elevations of melatonin in cerebrospinal fluid were also suppressed by propranolol and light. Serotonin released in large quantities at night appears to be regulated like melatonin, and may act as a cerebroventricular hormone to influence brain and pituitary function at night.", 
    "49": "We have studied the binding of dansyl propranolol to lipid bilayers and to the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The fluorescence emission spectra for dansyl propranolol bound to the ATPase system can be fitted to the sum of three peaks, characteristic of probe bound to lipid and to protein and free in solution, respectively. Titrations show that binding to the lipid component of the ATPase system is comparable to binding to simple lipid bilayers. Binding constants obtained using fluorescence spectroscopy for binding to lipid bilayers agree with constants obtained from microelectrophoresis measurements. Binding to sites on the ATPase can be described either in terms of the aqueous concentration of dansyl propranolol or in terms of the mole fraction of dansyl propranolol in the lipid phase of the membrane. Both descriptions suggest extensive binding to annular sites at the lipid/protein interface of the ATPase. Binding at other sites on the ATPase might also be present. Binding of dansyl propranolol to the ATPase results in a marked inhibition of activity. At high Ca2+ concentrations, inhibition fits to a non-competitive model of inhibition, described by a Ki of 5 microM. We attribute this effect to binding at annular sites. At lower Ca2+ concentration, a decrease is observed in the apparent affinity of the ATPase for Ca2+ which can be attributed to a build-up of positive charge on the membrane as a result of binding.", 
    "50": "Using high performance liquid chromatography with an electro-chemical detector, we studied effects of different compounds on the impulse-evoked release of endogenous noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) release from slices of the rat hypothalamus. Adrenaline (10(-7) M), with a potent alpha-agonistic action decreased both NA and DA release, and these effects were blocked by pretreatment with yohimbine (10(-7 M). The alpha 2-antagonist, yohimbine alone (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) concentration-dependently increased these releases, while alpha 1-antagonist, prazosin showed weak increase on NA but not DA release at 10(-6) M. Isoproterenol (10(-10) - 10(-8) M) concentration-dependently increased these releases and the effects were antagonized by pretreatment with a non-selective beta-antagonist, 1-propranolol, a beta 1-antagonist, atenolol or a beta 2-antagonist, butoxamine. 1-Propranolol (3 X 10(-7) M) alone, but not the d-isomer inhibited the releases. Thus, in the rat hypothalamus, the release of NA and DA may be mediated via presynaptic alpha 2-, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "51": "The Ca2+ selective fluorescent indicator, Quin-2, was employed to monitor continuously the concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+ [ Ca2+ ]i in isolated rat hepatocytes. Epinephrine (10(-6) M) and phenylephrine (10(-5) M), acting via alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, increases [ Ca2+ ]i from a basal concentration of approximately 0.2 microM to approximately 0.6 microM. This increase in [ Ca2+ ]i is evident as early as 1 to 1.5 s, the earliest time so far reported for any hepatic alpha 1-adrenergic event. Vasopressin (10(-8) M), after a lag which is 2 to 3 s longer, increases [ Ca2+ ]i to the same extent and at the same rate as the alpha 1-adrenergic agonists. Glucagon (10(-8) M) also increases [ Ca2+ ]i but at a significantly slower rate and only after a lag of about 10 s. All of these agents also induce an increase in the fluorescence of control cells. This Quin-2 independent fluorescence, which is due to an increased reduction of pyridine nucleotides, must be corrected for before the maximum change in [ Ca2+ ]i can be calculated but is sufficiently slow so as not to contribute to the initial rate of increase in the Quin-2-dependent fluorescence.", 
    "52": "Gastric emptying of the fed guinea-pig was measured using a non-invasive X-ray fluoroscopic technique to determine passage from the stomach of polystyrene-coated barium sulphate spheroids. Peripherally administered metoclopramide (0.1-10 mg/kg i.p.), clebopride (1-10 mg/kg i.p.), (-)-sulpiride (40 mg/kg i.p.), haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.) and domperidone (1-10 mg/kg i.p.) failed to modify gastric emptying. Stress inhibited emptying, and this was considered to explain the effects of eserine and high dose metoclopramide. Gastric emptying was decreased by peripherally administered atropine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) and apomorphine (0.1-0.5 mg/kg s.c.); the apomorphine response was antagonised by pretreatment with haloperidol, domperidone, (-)-sulpiride, metoclopramide and clebopride but not by prazosin + propranolol. Gastric emptying was facilitated by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administrations of metoclopramide and clebopride (40, 100 and 200 micrograms) but not by i.c.v. domperidone, haloperidol, fluphenazine or (-)-sulpiride (100, 200 micrograms) and was inhibited by i.c.v. apomorphine (100, 200 micrograms); the response to i.c.v. apomorphine was antagonised by i.c.v. pretreatments with haloperidol, domperidone, (-)-sulpiride, metoclopramide and clebopride (40-50 micrograms). Facilitation of emptying by i.c.v. metoclopramide was prevented by peripheral pretreatment with atropine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.). It is concluded that the actions of apomorphine and metoclopramide/clebopride to respectively inhibit and facilitate gastric emptying may be mediated, at least in part, via central mechanisms. Whilst apomorphine's action may be mediated via dopamine receptor mechanisms, metoclopramide and clebopride act at additional unspecified sites, metoclopramide's action being expressed via cholinergic mechanisms.", 
    "53": "The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist radioligand [125I]cyanopindolol (CYP) has been used to localize beta-adrenoceptors in rat kidney sections. [125I]CYP bound with high affinity to sites in rat kidney sections having the recognition characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors. Autoradiographic studies combined with histochemical techniques demonstrated that the beta-adrenoceptors were primarily located on renal glomeruli, distal and cortical collecting tubules rather than on proximal tubules or vascular elements.", 
    "54": "Presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors were further characterized in spiral strips of guinea-pig pulmonary arteries preloaded with [3H]norepinephrine. l-Metoprolol (3 X 10(-6) M) inhibited isoproterenol (3 X 10(-7) M)-induced increases in 3H efflux by transmural field stimulation, whereas the d-isomer produced no inhibition. However, IPS 339, H 35/25, butoxamine and metoprolol (3 X 10(-6) M) antagonized salbutamol (3 X 10(-7) M)-induced increases in the parameter, whereas acebutolol, bevantolol and practolol (3 X 10(-6) M) produced no antagonism. Presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig pulmonary arteries appear to have characteristics similar to those postsynaptic classical beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "55": "Many trials have reported that beta blockers increase survival after myocardial infarction; these trials are reviewed. The timolol trial was randomized and showed that mortality was reduced for all patients randomized to beta blockers. Similar findings have been found in both the metoprolol trial in G\u00f6teburg and the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial in the U.S. Chronic beta-blockade therapy appears to reduce mortality in patients who survive acute myocardial infarction. The mechanism is as yet unknown.", 
    "56": "There is some evidence that partial agonism is an important property of beta-blocking drugs, and this property may be exploited to produce a new range of positive inotropic drugs. With the established beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs, the level of partial agonist activity is weak and the dose-response curve for this property is shallow. However, its absence appears to increase the likelihood of inducing bronchospasm and bradycardia, and drugs that lack intrinsic sympathomimetic activity appear more likely to be associated with rebound cardiac arrhythmias on cessation of treatment. The idea of a small level of hormone activity--in this case, catecholamine activity--being necessary to maintain normal cardiac and perhaps bronchial function is not new. Minimal doses of steroids are essential to maintaining the inotropic action of cardiac muscle. There is now enough accumulated evidence to suggest that a minimal degree of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation is also important for normal bronchial and cardiac function, and its absence increases the incidence of bradycardia and the risks of bronchospasm and rebound arrhythmias.", 
    "57": "Timolol, one of the newer beta-adrenergic antagonists, has less depressive effects on the heart than propranolol, so that it has the potential for use by pregnant women. In chronically cannulated ewes, timolol at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg of body weight induced maternal and fetal bradycardia; the higher dose also depressed uterine blood flow and fetal PaO2. When this higher dose preceded brief compression of the umbilical cord, uterine flow was further depressed and the usual posthypoxia rebound tachycardia did not develop. Both the blocking of fetal responses to hypoxia (precluding detection of fetal distress) and the reduction in uterine flow led us to conclude that timolol taken by a mother could pose particular hazards for her fetus in hypoxic conditions, such as during cord compression at parturition.", 
    "58": "Incubation of rat adipocytes with 1 microM-noradrenaline caused a decrease in both the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive (microsomal) and N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive (mitochondrial) glycerol phosphate acyltransferase activities measured in homogenates from freeze-stopped cells. The effects of noradrenaline on glycerol phosphate acyltransferase activity were apparent over a wide range of concentrations of glycerol phosphate and palmitoyl-CoA. The effect of noradrenaline was reversed within cells by the subsequent addition of insulin or propranolol. Inclusion of albumin in homogenization buffers abolished the effect of noradrenaline on the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive activity. The effect of noradrenaline on the N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive (mitochondrial) activity was, however, not abolished by inclusion of albumin in buffers for preparation of homogenates from freeze-stopped cells. Inclusion of fluoride in homogenization buffers did not alter the observed effect of noradrenaline. The inactivating effect of noradrenaline persisted through the subcellular fractionation procedures used to isolate adipocyte microsomes (microsomal fractions). The effect of noradrenaline on mitochondrial glycerol phosphate acyltransferase did not persist through subcellular fractionation. Noradrenaline treatment of cells significantly decreased the Vmax. of glycerol phosphate acyltransferase in isolated microsomes without changing the activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. Glycerol phosphate acyltransferase activity in microsomes from noradrenaline-treated cells is unstable, being rapidly lost on incubation at 30 degrees C. Bivalent metal ions (Mg2+, Ca2+) or post-microsomal supernatant protected against this inactivation. Glycerol phosphate acyltransferase activity in microsomes from noradrenaline-treated cells could not be re-activated by incubation with either alkaline phosphatase or phosphoprotein phosphatase-1. Addition of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunits to adipocyte microsomes incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP considerably increased the incorporation of 32P into microsomal protein, but did not cause inactivation of glycerol phosphate acyltransferase. These findings provide no support for the proposal that inactivation of adipocyte microsomal glycerol phosphate acyltransferase by noradrenaline is through a phosphorylation type of covalent modification.", 
    "59": "The beta-blocker propranolol administered intraperitoneally to rats prior to the barbiturate anaesthetic thiopentone caused a dose-dependent increase in anaesthesia duration. Sotalol, which only poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier, had no such effect, implying a central site of action. The selective beta 1-blockers, metoprolol and atenolol, did not alter thiopentone anaesthesia duration; implying that the effect of propranolol was mediated by a beta 2-receptor. The selective alpha 1-blocker prazocin increased thiopentone anaesthesia duration, while the alpha 1-agonist ST 587 decreased it. Since the alpha 1-agonist methoxamine, which only poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier, was ineffective, a central site of action is indicated. The alpha 2-agonist clonidine markedly increased thiopentone-anaesthesia duration, while the alpha 2-blocker yohimbine, shortened the duration. These effects were shown to be noradrenergic since they were blocked by prior depletion of brain noradrenaline using 6-hydroxydopamine. A model is proposed in which drug-induced alterations in the firing of locus coeruleus cells, or drug-induced changes in the postsynaptic effect of released noradrenaline, may be responsible for modulation of cortical arousal, wakefulness and the processing of sensory stimuli; thus affecting the duration of barbiturate anaesthesia.", 
    "60": "Adenylate cyclase activity associated to wild type Neurospora membranes is highly dependent on Mn2+ and insensitive to fluoride, guanyl nucleotides, and cholera toxin. These membranes are able to interact with components of detergent extracts from turkey erythrocyte ghosts. The reconstituted cyclase system is catalytically active in the presence of Mg2+ and it is activated by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate plus isoproterenol and fluoride. When detergent extracts were prepared from avian erythrocyte membranes treated with cholera toxin, the reconstituted system was stimulated by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate in the absence of isoproterenol and cyclase activities were higher than those observed with extracts from membranes not treated with the toxin. Dose-response curves for isoproterenol and fluoride in the reconstituted system were similar to those reported for avian erythrocyte and liver membranes, respectively.", 
    "61": "A rapid, selective and reproducible high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed for the measurement of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug atenolol in small (400 microliters) volumes of plasma. Following solid phase sample preparation using Bond-ElutTM mini-columns the compound is separated by high-performance column liquid chromatography on a microparticulate (6 microns) cyano column using acetonitrile--ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (4:96) containing triethylamine (0.25%, v/v) as the mobile phase, and the absorption of the column effluent is monitored at 224 nm. The practical limit of quantitation, based upon an assay volume of 400 microliters, is 25 ng/ml for atenolol. The average coefficient of variation is 3.1%.", 
    "62": "The membrane potentials of rat neocortical astrocytes growing in primary cultures (mean resting potential; -79 mV at [K+]o = 4.5 mM) were depolarized by up to 30 mV by 10(-5) M norepinephrine added to the medium, or up to 11 mV by norepinephrine or phenylephrine applied by ionophoresis. This depolarization could be inhibited by the alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine (10(-5) M) but not by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10(-5) M). These results suggest that the norepinephrine-evoked depolarizations seen in these cells may be mediated through an alpha-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "63": "Using gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G-50) and radio-immunoassay for beta-endorphin (beta-END) and beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) we investigated the site [anterior lobe (AL) vs. intermediate lobe (IL)] for serotonergic control of pituitary beta-END-like immunoreactivity (beta-END-LI) in the rat. Since the secretion of beta-LPH in vitro clearly distinguishes beta-END-LI release by the AL as compared to the IL, we interpreted changes in plasma levels of immunoreactivity resembling beta-LPH to reflect beta-END-LI release from the AL. Following the administration of L-tryptophan (200 mg/kg, 30 min, ip), a serotonin precursor, nearly all of the rise in total plasma beta-END-LI was due to the form of immunoreactivity resembling beta-LPH in molecular size. Similarly, 5-hydroxytryptophan (30 mg/kg, 30 min, ip), a serotonin precursor, and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, 15 min, ip), a serotonin reuptake blocker, predominantly increased circulating levels of beta-LPH-sized immunoreactivity with little effect on beta-END-sized immunoreactivity. Quipazine (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, 30 min, ip), a serotonin receptor agonist, elevated plasma levels of both forms of beta-END-LI; however, the immunoreactive peak coeluting with beta-LPH was primarily affected, being increased 9.5-fold while that resembling beta-END was increased less than 1-fold. Immobilization stress (30 min) dramatically elevated plasma levels of both forms of immunoreactivity, however, a greater relative rise in beta-LPH than beta-END was observed. Intraventricular administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (75 micrograms, free base, 10 d), a serotonin neurotoxin, lowered plasma levels of both forms of immunoreactivity about equally in stressed animals. Further, dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid which selectively inhibits AL corticotroph secretion in vitro, attenuated the beta-LPH response to serotonergic activation in vivo. Together, these findings indicate that serotonergic drugs predominantly influence the release of beta-END-LI resembling beta-LPH and further suggest that serotonin neurons preferentially regulate the release of beta-END-LI from AL corticotrophs in vivo.", 
    "64": "The beta adrenoceptor antagonist radioligand [3H] dihydroalprenolol (DHA) has been used to characterise beta adrenoceptors in membranes prepared from rat renal glomeruli. Association of the ligand was rapid and had reached equilibrium within 10 mins at 37 degrees C. Dissociation occurred in two distinct phases, a rapidly dissociating phase (low affinity site) and a slowly dissociating phase (high affinity site). The KD value for the high affinity site calculated from the kinetic experiments was 0.8 nM. Saturation analysis of binding gave comparable values for KD (1.77 nM) and demonstrated that membranes from glomeruli had four times the density of binding sites measured in renal cortex. In all saturation studies Hill coefficients were not significantly different from unity. Binding was stereoselective with respect to the (-) isomers of isoprenaline and propranolol and the potency of the selective displacing agents betaxolol (beta 1 adrenoceptors) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2 adrenoceptors) indicated that the receptors are of the beta 1 subtype.", 
    "65": "The effects of amrinone on conduction in the intact canine heart were studied. Intracardiac His-electrode catheter recordings were used to measure the functional refractory period (FRP) of the AV node and conduction time through the AV node (A2H2 interval) and in the His-Purkinje system (H2V2 interval). Amrinone (2.5 to 10 mg/kg) shortened the FRP and A2H2 in a dose-dependent manner but had no significant effect on H2V2. In hearts where AV conduction was depressed by treatment with verapamil, propranolol, or ouabain, amrinone partially reversed this depression. Amrinone also shortened the recovery time of spontaneous sinoatrial (SA) node activity following a train of rapid atrial stimulation. This effect was also observed after depression of SA nodal recovery with verapamil, propranolol, or ouabain. These results indicate that amrinone enhances AV conduction and SA nodal activity in the normal heart and may favorably influence depressed AV conduction and SA nodal activity induced by a variety of cardioactive agents.", 
    "66": "The plasma oxprenolol concentrations were measured in nine cases for 3 days following the application of 1 dragee (160 mg) daily of Slow Trasicor (CIBA). Blood sampling was carried out at the 1st, 6th, 12th, and 24th h during the 1st day, and at the 12th and 24th h during the 2nd and 3rd days, respectively. Oxprenolol reached a considerable plasma level already after the 1st h: 140 ng/ml on the average during the 1st day. The average concentrations were 284 and 202 at the 6th and 12th h, respectively. It decreased to 43 ng/ml by the 24th h. During the 2nd and 3rd days 124 and 122 ng/ml values were found at the 12th h, and 42 and 50 ng/ml at the 24th h. The results of these studies prove the good absorption of Slow Trasicor, as well as its prolonged presence in the plasma. The corresponding clinical improvements in the patients indicate the therapeutic effect of the plasma levels.", 
    "67": "Plasma propranolol levels were measured in a woman who took 3120 mg of propranolol in a suicide attempt. Highest plasma level, measured at the 12th hour, was 1475 ng/ml. Elimination half life was prolonged to 13.8 h. She suffered from coma and profound hypotension, then died on the 20th day. By estimating brain propranolol concentration from the plasma level, and reviewing the clinical pictures of previously reported cases, we propose that central nervous suppression by propranolol, with membrane stabilizing effect as its pharmacological basis, may cause life threatening abnormalities in patients with massive overdose of propranolol.", 
    "68": "The blood pressure (BP) effect and modes of action of a twice daily regimen of labetalol (mean 450 mg/day) were assessed in ten mild to moderate hypertensives using continuous ambulatory BP monitoring. The reflex control of BP during physiological interventions was examined just prior to the next dose of medication to estimate the residual alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Global 24 h BP was reduced by 15/9 mm Hg, and home pressures by 13/11 mm Hg. The predominant antihypertensive effect was noted during the waking hours. During dynamic exercise significant inhibition of the heart rate and blood pressure rise occurred. Coupled with a reduction of the post-release BP 'overshoot' in Valsalva's manoeuvre, the response resembles that seen with beta-adrenoceptor blockade. A small alpha-adrenoceptor blocking action was evident in one patient's response to the Valsalva manoeuvre.", 
    "69": "The direct-acting vasodilator, endralazine, in combination with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker significantly reduced the blood pressures of normotensive volunteers and of patients with essential hypertension. The mean terminal elimination half-life for endralazine of 136 min in hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from the 155 min in normotensive subjects. In normal subjects the mean oral bioavailability for endralazine was 75% and the mean clearance was 780 ml/min. There were no significant pharmacokinetic differences between fast and slow acetylators. The administration of endralazine to steady state in the hypertensive patients was associated with an increase in terminal elimination half-life and a decrease in the rate of absorption. However, there was no accumulation of endralazine with chronic dosing.", 
    "70": "Experiments on anesthetized rats were made to study the effects of atenolol and propranolol on cardiac output and distribution of the drugs in the heart, lungs, brain, kidneys, large and small intestines, stomach, liver and skeletal muscles with the use of radioactive carbonized microspheres techniques. Atenolol and propranolol provoked a decrease in cardiac output and raised the total peripheral resistance without a detectable effect on blood pressure. Administration of atenolol brought about a decrease in the renal blood flow whereas that of propranolol in the myocardial blood flow.", 
    "71": "Presented here are six examples of potentially life-threatening propranolol-epinephrine interactions. The only report found that warns of a deleterious clinical interaction between propranolol and epinephrine appeared in 1980. With widespread use of propranolol for approved and unapproved conditions, the population at risk is significant. All physicians and dentists using local anesthetic with epinephrine should be aware of this interaction.", 
    "72": "The comparative effects of electrical stimulation of parasympathetic (chorda tympani nerve) and sympathetic innervation to the rat submandibular gland on calcium secretion were examined. The separate roles of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in the regulation of calcium secretion during sympathetic nerve stimulation were also determined. The present study shows that the parasympathetic and sympathetic innervations to rat submandibular gland have very different effects on [Ca] of saliva; the regulatory influence of the sympathetic is more prominent than that of the parasympathetic innervation; [Ca] of submandibular saliva evoked by chorda stimulation was about 25 times less than that of saliva evoked by sympathetic stimulation. However, since total volume of chorda-evoked submandibular saliva was about 20 times greater than that of sympathetically evoked saliva, the total output of calcium following stimulation of either autonomic branch was similar. Glandular depletion of calcium for both kinds of nerve stimulation was also similar. Comparison with previous studies on the rat parotid gland shows that the role of the parasympathetic innervation in regulation of [Ca] of saliva and glandular depletion of calcium differed in the two glands while that of the sympathetic innervation was generally similar for both submandibular and parotid glands. Calcium secretion from rat submandibular gland was decreased during sympathetic nerve stimulation in the presence of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, while it was greatly increased when the sympathetic nerve was stimulated in the presence of phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker. Thus, it was concluded that with both glands beta-adrenoceptors play the major role in the regulation of calcium secretion.", 
    "73": "The long-term antihypertensive effect of combined nifedipine and propranolol therapy was assessed in an open trial in 26 hypertensive patients (19 men, seven women, mean age 53 years). On propranolol alone (160 to 240 mg/day), the patients' average sitting blood pressure was 192 +/- 5/114 +/- 2 mm Hg. Propranolol was continued in a fixed dose and nifedipine was added in a dose that was gradually increased from 30 to 90 mg/day to achieve blood pressure (BP) values below 160/95 mm Hg. Twenty-two patients remained on the combined regimen for 14 to 30 weeks. Their BP decreased to 136 +/- 3/84 +/- 2 mm Hg on an average daily dose of 59.5 mg nifedipine. Seventeen of the 22 subjects were subsequently treated sequentially with propranolol alone, combined therapy, and nifedipine alone, to assess the relative efficacy of each mode of therapy. The combined regimen was found to be more effective than either drug alone. Side effects occurred in 13 of 26 patients. Four dropped out 4 to 11 weeks after starting nifedipine because of either intolerable flushing (2), allergic rash (1), or headache (1). Nine subjects experienced mild reactions that were well tolerated. It is concluded that the combined use of propranolol and nifedipine is effective in the long-term treatment of moderately severe hypertension and offers an alternative therapeutic approach that deserves further evaluation."
