    "0": "The structural relationships between interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), varicose nerve fibers, and smooth muscle cells in the gastrointestinal tract have led to the suggestion that ICC may be involved in or mediate enteric neurotransmission. We characterized the distribution of ICC in the murine stomach and found two distinct classes on the basis of morphology and immunoreactivity to antibodies against c-Kit receptors. ICC with multiple processes formed a network in the myenteric plexus region from corpus to pylorus. Spindle-shaped ICC were found within the circular and longitudinal muscle layers (IC-IM) throughout the stomach. The density of these cells was greatest in the proximal stomach. IC-IM ran along nerve fibers and were closely associated with nerve terminals and adjacent smooth muscle cells. IC-IM failed to develop in mice with mutations in c-kit. Therefore, we used W/W(V) mutants to test whether IC-IM mediate neural inputs in muscles of the gastric fundus. The distribution of inhibitory nerves in the stomachs of c-kit mutants was normal, but NO-dependent inhibitory neuro-regulation was greatly reduced. Smooth muscle tissues of W/W(V) mutants relaxed in response to exogenous sodium nitroprusside, but the membrane potential effects of sodium nitroprusside were attenuated. These data suggest that IC-IM play a critical serial role in NO-dependent neurotransmission: the cellular mechanism(s) responsible for transducing NO into electrical responses may be expressed in IC-IM. Loss of these cells causes loss of electrical responsiveness and greatly reduces responses to nitrergic nerve stimulation.", 
    "1": "This paper details various rapid and sensitive methods for the extraction and derivatisation of propranolol, metoprolol, sotalol, atenolol, pindolol, timolol, oxprenolol, alprenolol and penbutolol in equine urine and in human post mortem whole blood and urine. Three solid-phase extraction methods are described involving the use of either XtrackT XRDAH515, Bond Elut Certify or Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. Two derivatisation methods are also described involving the formation of cyclised silyl or pentafluoropropionate derivatives with either chloromethyldimethylchlorosilane or pentafluoropropionic anhydride, respectively. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry analysis was carried out in select-ion monitoring mode. All these methods were evaluated using drug-free human post mortem blood, urine and equine urine fortified at various levels with the beta-blockers mentioned above. The application of some of these methods on a forensic case study is also presented. This work does not include samples from equine administration trials of beta-blockers.", 
    "2": "Despite the availability and use of effective methods for limiting infarct size with thrombolytic agents and primary angioplasty, patients experiencing a myocardial infarction (MI) are at increased risk for a second cardiac event in the post-MI period (e.g., reinfarction, heart failure, and sudden death). For this reason, postinfarction risk management is crucial. An extensive data base has firmly established the efficacy of beta blockers in reducing cardiovascular risk following acute MI. The full advantages of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have only recently begun to emerge as the result of a growing understanding of the mechanisms of adverse outcomes following MI. The importance of lipid-lowering agents, in particular the \"statins,\" should be considered in all post-MI patients, especially since recent studies have conclusively shown improved survival and reduced rates of MI and coronary artery bypass surgery in this population with this therapy. Aspirin is now considered a standard part of the early management of the acute infarct patient as well as for secondary prevention in post-MI patients. At present, chronic anticoagulation with warfarin should be reserved for selected patients. The nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists diltiazem and verapamil can be considered for post-MI use only in patients in whom beta blockers are contraindicated and who have preserved systolic function and/or those without clinical heart failure. In contrast, the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, particularly nifedipine, have no role in secondary prevention. Although long-term benefits are minimal, nitrates continue to be useful in post-MI patients with residual ischemia (angina or silent ischemia), heart failure (systolic or diastolic), or postinfarction hypertension. Antiarrhythmic agents, except amiodarone, are relatively contraindicated in post-MI patients. Recent data show that vitamin E reduces the rate of nonfatal MI. Its role in cardiovascular death and overall mortality remains to be clarified. Despite their demonstrated value, agents used in secondary prevention generally appear to be underutilized. In addition, when pharmacologic therapies are administered for secondary prevention, they are often prescribed at lower doses than those tested and proved in trials. A greater appreciation for the efficacy and safety profiles of these agents could lead to more widespread use and more pronounced reductions in morbidity and mortality among post-MI patients.", 
    "3": "This 4-week, randomized, parallel-group study compared the efficacy and safety of a metered-dose inhaler equipped with a new spacer device (Jet spacer) with those of a standard actuator in the administration of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (0.5 mg twice daily) in 66 adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were responsive to beta 2-agonists. Lung function values, symptom scores, and daily consumption of a beta 2-agonist determined efficacy. At baseline and after treatment, levels of morning serum and 24-hour urinary cortisol were measured in half of the patients (one center). Ease of use of the two devices was expressed by patients at the final visit. Lung function values and clinical symptoms improved in both groups (P < .01 at the final visit); the Jet group reported a better outcome (P < .05 between groups) than the standard-actuator group for predicted normal values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity, and bronchial noises. Salbutamol consumption decreased in both groups. One patient in the Jet group and 5 patients in the standard-actuator group reported adverse reactions. No significant between-group differences were found in plasma and urinary cortisol levels. The Jet device was judged easier to use (P < .05 between groups) than the standard actuator. In conclusion, the jet device was more effective than a standard actuator in reducing local adverse reactions to inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate in adults with COPD, with a better efficacy profile.", 
    "4": "Carvedilol (Kredex, Coreg) is a multiple action antihypertensive drug that has been shown to protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidative damages. In this study the physical and structural effects of carvedilol on lipid bilayers are investigated by fluorescence techniques, differential scanning calorimetry and other physical methods. Carvedilol binds to liposomal membranes (9:1 DMPC:DMPG) strongly with an apparent binding constant on the order of 10(4) M-1 in PBS (pH 7.4). The characteristic changes in its intrinsic fluorescence properties when bound to liposomes suggest that this compound is situated in a non-polar environment. The Stern-Volmer and bimolecular quenching constants, determined using nitrate as the fluorescence quencher, for the free and bound carvedilol indicate that the carbazole moiety is at a depth of > 11 A in the lipid bilayer. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements show that, unlike the membrane probes DPH and TMA-DPH, carvedilol is relatively mobile, and does not have a rigidly-defined molecular orientation in the bilayers. Differential scanning calorimetry results indicate that carvedilol is an effective membrane \"fluidizer' as it dose-dependently lowers the gel to liquid crystalline transition temperature and broadens the endothermic transition. Comparative studies of interactions of carbazole, 4-OH carbazole and carvedilol with the model liposomal membranes reveal a possible role of membrane-partitioning in their antioxidant efficacy. These findings are discussed in perspective with the membrane biophysical properties of different classes of therapeutic significant lipid antioxidants in mind.", 
    "5": "Previously, studies have demonstrated that the effects of both a laboratory-produced vancomycin and a clinically available vancomycin were mediated, in part, by activation of both H(1) and H(2) receptors; however, other mechanisms may play a role in the vascular changes associated with vancomycin, since neither H(1) and H(2) receptor blockade has completely abolished the vasodilator responses to vancomycin in any model system. To study the mechanisms of vancomycin interactions in the hindlimb vascular bed of the rat, responses of two types of vancomycin preparations were studied. Vancomycin prepared for either clinical or laboratory use produced an initial short-lived period of vasoconstriction followed by a prolonged period of vasodilation in the hindlimb vascular bed. Responses to both the vancomycins and histamine on systemic arterial vasodilation were significantly decreased after administration of both the H(1)-receptor antagonist diphenhydramine and the H(2)-receptor antagonist famotidine. Verapamil, an L-type calcium channel blocker, significantly reduced the vasopressor responses to clinical vancomycin but not the vasopressor responses to laboratory vancomycin. Enalaprilat, and angiotensin-converting enzyme blocker, significantly reduced the vasodilator responses but not the vasoconstrictor responses of clinical vancomycin and significantly reduced the vasoconstrictor responses but not the vasodilator responses to laboratory vancomycin. Meclofenamate, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, and N(omega)-L-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthetase inhibitor, had no significant effect on the biphasic responses with either vancomycin preparations. Atropine, an anticholinergic-antimuscarinic receptor antagonist, and propranolol, a beta adrenergic blocker, had no significant effect on vancomycin responses. Finally, ondansetron, a serotonin receptor blocker, and HOE 140, a bradykinin receptor blocker, also had no significant effect on vancomycin responses. These data suggest that both vancomycin preparations (clinically available and laboratory prepared) caused biphasic responses that differed from the dose-dependent vasodilation elicited by histamine. Both vancomycin preparations' vasodilator responses appear to be modulated, in part, by a histamine receptor--sensitive mechanism, while vancomycin-induced vasoconstrictor responses appear to be modulated, in part, by angiotensin-converting enzyme and L-type calcium channel--sensitive mechanisms in the rat hindlimb vascular bed. These data also suggest that the vascular responses of vancomycin are preparation dependent.",

Drop in diastolic arterial pressure with anapriline therapy amounted to 15.9 and 15.6%, with corinfar therapy-to 15.0 and 15.6% in hypertensive disease stage I and II respectively. Hypotensive action of corinfar might result from correction of impaired cation-transport function of cellular membranes, electrolyte homeostasis of cells, phospholipid composition of membranes. No dynamics has been revealed of the membrane tests under study during administration of anapriline therapy treatments.",

We make use of these representations, pharmacological distribution diagrams (PDDs), in structurally heterogeneous groups where generally they adopt skewed Gaussian shapes or present several maxima. The maxima afford intervals of discriminant function in which exists a good expectancy to find new active drugs. A set of beta-blockers with contrasted activity has been selected to test the ability of PDDs as a visualizing technique, for the identification of new beta-blocker active compounds.", 
    "15": "The relationships among the metabolic ratios for the standard probe drugs of CYP2D6 activity, such as debrisoquine, sparteine, metoprolol and dextromethorphan, were studied in 32 Turkish subjects. All subjects were randomly selected according to their phenotypes from a group of 111 Turkish subjects whose oxidation status had been tested for debrisoquine previously. All subjects were given a 10 mg debrisoquine tablet, a 100 mg sparteine tablet, a 100 mg. metoprolol tablet and a 20 mg dextromethorphan capsule orally with a wash-out period of at least 1 week between each probe administration. Metabolic ratios were calculated as percentage of dose excreted as parent drug/percentage of dose excreted as its hydroxymetabolite of parent drug in 0-8 h urine. Three poor metabolisers (PM) of debrisoquine were identified. They were also PMs of the other test probes and no misclassification by the 4 phenotyping methods was observed. All six correlations among the metabolic ratios of the 4 probe drugs assessed by Spearman's rank test were highly significant (P < 0.001). The present findings indicate that the oxidative metabolism of debrisoquine, sparteine, metoprolol and dextromethorphan is catalysed by the same cytochrome P450 in the Turkish subjects.",

Tissues were prepared in Krebs-Henseleit solution with and without adding cocaine. 17 beta-estradiol and propranolol for blocking neuronal and extraneuronal noradrenaline reuptake. In normal Krebs-Henseleit solution imipramine-N-oxide, nomifensine, viloxacine and lofepramine increased noradrenaline responses, while clomipramine, trazodone and doxepin behaved as competitive antagonists.

    "17": "Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of arrhythmias and for the prevention of sudden cardia death, particularly in post-myocardial infarction patients. Betablockers have been demonstrated to reduce mortality, reinfarction, ventricular fibrillation and cardiac rupture in acute infarction. Therefore, in patients with suspected myocardial infarction and without contraindications, treatment with betablockers should be initiated early and continued for at least 2 years. Side-effects are mild and occur in approximately 10% of patients. Patients who have contraindications for betablockers use early in myocardial infarction should be reevaluated before discharge from the hospital and considered for such therapy. Because betablockers prevent some of the adverse arrhythmogenic mechanisms seen in chronic heart failure, it may be reasonable to expect that these drugs could have a role in preventing sudden cardiac death in these patients. Analysis of some of the betablocker post-infarction trials indicate that betablockers reduced the risk of sudden death in patients with heart failure at baseline. Some studies demonstrated also the symptomatic improvement following therapy with betablockers in patients with heart failure. But the currently available data are too limited to provide conclusive information.", 
    "18": "1. The studies were designed to investigate the changes in responsiveness to beta-adrenoceptor agonists induced by chronic administration of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and agonists. 2. Dose-response curves for dopexamine, isoprenaline, noradrenaline and impromidine on heart rate, blood pressure and myocardial contractility (dP/dt:integrated isometric tension) were obtained in untreated dogs and compared to those measured in dogs which had been pretreated with propranolol (8 mg kg-1 day-1), atenolol (6 mg kg-1 day-1), isoprenaline (0.5 microgram kg-1 min-1) or noradrenaline (0.5 microgram kg-1 min-1) for 14 days. 3. Propranolol pretreatment significantly enhanced the inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoprenaline. There were noticeable, but non-significant increases in inotropic sensitivity to noradrenaline and dopexamine, especially at higher dose levels. In the atenolol treatment group, there were significant increases in inotropic responses to dopexamine and isoprenaline and in depressor responses to isoprenaline. 4. Thus, chronic administration of propranolol increased responses mediated by both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, whereas, atenolol selectively enhanced the inotropic responsiveness to dopexamine, which is mediated mainly by beta 2-adrenoceptors. 5. Isoprenaline pretreatment caused a significant decrease in inotropic sensitivity to dopexamine, isoprenaline and noradrenaline and a significant reduction in chronotropic responses to dopexamine. The tendency to reduced depressor responses to isoprenaline and dopexamine failed to reach significance. Pretreatment with noradrenaline decreased only the inotropic response to noradrenaline. 6. Thus, chronic isoprenaline treatment reduced the responsiveness of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, while chronic noradrenaline infusion only reduced beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated responses. 7. There was no significant change in any of the dose-response curves to impromidine after any beta-adrenoceptor antagonist or agonist treatment. This indicates that there was no non-specific alteration in responsiveness and that the observed changes were likely to be associated with specific alterations in beta-adrenoceptor number or function.", 
    "19": "1. Exposure of rat tail arteries to clenbuterol, a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, for 20 or 90 min, did not change or increase, respectively, tritium overflow induced by electrical field stimulation in arteries preincubated with [3H]-noradrenaline (NA). This facilitatory effect was antagonized by propranolol. 2. Phentolamine increased the evoked overflow four-fold, which was not modified by 90 min incubation with clenbuterol. In rats pretreated with clenbuterol for 2 weeks, the stimulated overflow was not enhanced by this beta 2-agonist, and the increase produced by phentolamine was markedly diminished. 3. Contractile responses induced by electrical field stimulation were not modified or increased (only at low frequencies) by preincubation with clenbuterol for 20 or 90 min, respectively. This effect was inhibited by propranolol. 4. In arteries precontracted with 5-hydroxytryptamine, clenbuterol (10 nM-10 microM) produced small relaxations, which were reduced by propranolol plus phentolamine and not modified by phentolamine or 90 min exposure to clenbuterol. 5. These results indicate that prolonged exposure of rat tail arteries to clenbuterol produces a facilitation of NA release mediated by activation of presynaptic beta 2-adrenoceptors, which may be involved on the enhancement of contractile responses to electrical stimulation induced by clenbuterol. However, chronic treatment with this beta-agonist desensitizes these receptors.", 
    "20": "The efficacy and tolerability of nisoldipine coat-core (nisoldipine CC 10, 20, 40 mg) and atenolol (50, 100 mg) were compared in 230 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Treatment was titrated at two-weekly intervals as necessary to control blood pressure. After eight weeks of active therapy, the two treatments proved to be equally effective in reducing sitting diastolic blood pressure (13.7 +/- 8.3 mmHg and 14.2 +/- 9.1 mmHg for nisoldipine CC and atenolol, respectively), and provided equivalent reduction in systolic blood pressure and identical response rates (69%). Heart rate was reduced from baseline in the atenolol group but remained unchanged in the nisoldipine CC group (p < 0.001 difference between the two groups). Both nisoldipine CC and atenolol were well tolerated and had no detectable metabolic effects. Adverse events were minor and of the type commonly associated with drugs of these classes.", 
    "21": "Acute myocardial infarction, major cause of death in Western society, has been the focus of many clinical investigations over the past decade. As the result of randomized trials involving hundreds of thousands of infarct patients worldwide, the life-saving potential of several pharmacologic interventions has been validated, and the usefulness of other commonly used treatments has been disproven or brought into question. Much of the innovative therapy has been targeted toward limiting myocardial damage by eradicating the occlusive thrombus or otherwise restoring flow through the infarct-related artery, reducing oxygen demands in the injured ventricle, and altering vascular dynamics to limit the process of ventricular remodeling. Data have accumulated showing substantially lower mortality of acute myocardial infarction with simple pharmacological interventions such as intravenous thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors. In particular, ACE-inhibitors have recently proven to be effective in infarcted patients, especially in high-risk subjects with acute anterior infarction not treated with thrombolytic agents or patients with left ventricular dysfunction. ACE-inhibitors may limit the process of ventricular remodeling after a large infarction, lessening the risk of sudden death and heart failure. Intravenous heparin has a role in maintaining patency of infarct-related vessel after rt-PA, and it seems that this combination offers some benefits with respect to streptokinase plus subcutaneous heparin. Recent studies have also demonstrated the importance of lipid-lowering agents for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Several previously recommended therapies (routine intravenous lidocaine, calcium channel blockers, magnesium, nitrates) have not been proven to be life-saving.", 
    "22": "Hypertension and norepinephrine hypersecretion in a 59-year-old woman suffering from malignant pheochromocytoma with multiple metastases were appropriately controlled with alpha- and beta- blockers, and alpha-methyltyrosine (alpha-MT), a catecholamine-synthesis inhibitor. Metastasized vertebrae were treated with external radiation to relieve pain, but this treatment had to be interrupted at a total dose of 20 Gy because the patient suffered acutely exacerbated hypertension (200/110 mmHg), tachycardia (160 beats/min) and a low-grade fever. Simultaneously her serum levels of LDH, potassium, urea nitrogen, creatinine, white blood cell count, CRP and norepinephrine were significantly increased, suggesting that this episode was due to radiation-induced tissue destruction and the leakage of catecholamines and possibly interleukin-6, a cytokine mediating inflammation which is reportedly present in pheochromocytoma. The marked hypertension was controlled by continuous i.v. administration of phentolamine and propranolol. Although radiation therapy effectively relieves pain due to neoplasmic metastasis to the bone, physicians should be aware that life-threatening complications such as the above occur in malignant pheochromocytoma. Sufficient pretreatment with adrenergic blocking agents and/or alpha-MT and careful monitoring of the patient's general condition during radiation therapy, even at a low dose, are highly recommended.", 
    "23": "The cloning, sequencing and expression in model systems of the previously unidentified beta 3-adrenoceptor recently led to an extensive functional characterization. Ligand binding and adenylate cyclase activation studies helped define a specific profile that is quite distinct from that of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, but strongly reminiscent of most of the 'atypical' beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses reported in earlier pharmacological studies. More recently, a naturally occurring variation in the human beta 3-adrenoceptor has been correlated with hereditary obesity and with increased dynamic capacity to add on weight and develop non-insulin dependent diabetes in Western obese patients. Donny Strosberg and France Pietri-Rouxel describe how results now provide a consistent picture of an important role for the human beta 3-adrenoceptor in the regulation of lipid metabolism and as an obvious target for drugs to treat some forms of obesity and diabetes.", 
    "24": "In the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome of sepsis and septic shock the heart is one of the organs subject to failure. Many new insights into the mechanisms underlying septic cardiomyopathy were gained in the last years. Experimental work with neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes considerably contributed to this progress, facilitating the documentation of direct attenuation of the contractions of the heart muscle cell by toxins and mediators, as well as investigating the underlying cellular mechanisms. With this respect, contractile-depressant effects have been found in cardiomyocytes for many toxins and sepsis mediators, with endotoxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 and nitric oxide being the most relevant ones identified. These substances interfere at clinically relevant concentrations with several main inotropic axes, not only with the beta-adrenoceptor/adenylyl cyclase and with the NO-cGMP-system-on which most of the interest is focused at present-but also with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor/phosphoinositide pathway and the Ca2+ homeostasis of the cardiomyocyte, the latter representing the common final inotropic pathway. Not a single cardiodepressant factor, but more likely a total bunch of toxins and mediators with different attack mechanisms seem to contribute to the picture of septic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "25": "The role of glycogen content in the heart for the development of isoprenaline-induced myocardial lesions (IML) was studied in Wistar rats and in two inbred rat strains: In IR rats (resistant to the development of IML) and in IS rats (sensitive to IML development). Glycogen content in the heart can be dramatically lowered or increased by various interventions. IML develop during the period of very low heart glycogen content (about 0.6 mg.g-1) induced by isoprenaline administration. In animals with increased resistance to IML, either due to genetic factors or induced by isoprenaline pretreatment a high glycogen content in the heart is found (up to 7.5 mg.g-1). The increase of resistance to IML development and increased glycogen content induced by isoprenaline pretreatment were accompanied by lower basal or ISO-, guanylylimidodiphosphate- (Gpp/NH/p) and forskolin-stimulated activities of adenylyl cyclase. On the other hand, these parameters did not differ between IR and IS rats in spite of the presence of significant differences in the resistance to the development of IML and in heart glycogen content in these two rats strains. These results suggest that genetically determined differences between two inbred rat strains in the resistance of the heart to the development of IML and in the heart glycogen content are caused by factors which are independent of the receptor-adenylyl cyclase complex and are therefore different from those involved in the increase of resistance and glycogen content due to isoprenaline pretreatment.", 
    "26": "Sera from T. cruzi infected mice were tested in an enzyme immunoassay on peptides corresponding to the second extracellular loops of the beta 1-, the beta 2-adrenergic receptor and the M2 muscarinic receptor. All sera of mice (4/4) in the acute phase recognized the beta 1-adrenergic receptor and the M2 muscarinic receptor peptides but not the beta 2-adrenergic receptor peptide. The same peptides were recognized during the chronic phase in half of the mice (6/12). The immunoglobulin fractions of the mice were tested for their activity on L-type Ca++ channels of isolated guinea-pig cardiomyocytes using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. The immunoglobulin fractions of acute phase mice were able to activate the Ca++ channels by stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptors, as assessed by inhibition with propranolol. Those of the chronic phase mice reduced the Ca++ current by stimulation of the muscarinic receptors, as assessed by inhibition with atropine. These results confirm the existence of functional epitopes on the second extracellular loops of both receptors. They suggest that, as in humans, the parasite is able to elicit functional autoantibodies against these epitopes. They give evidence that these autoantibodies mediate their physiological effects by modulating the cAMP activated Ca++ channels.", 
    "27": "The effect of nipradilol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker with nitroglycerin-like vasodilating activity, on oxotremorine-induced tremor was studied in mice. General tremor in mice was elicited by 0.5 mg/kg oxotremorine. The tremor was quantified using a capacitance transducer, then analyzed by a signal processor. The strength of the tremor was expressed in \"points\". The point values of the tremor (mean +/- SE) in control mice for 5 mg/kg (+/-)-propranolol, 2.5 mg/kg arotinolol, 0.5 mg/kg nipradilol, 1.0 mg/kg nipradilol and 2.5 mg/kg nipradilol were 87 +/- 16, 42 +/- 6, 38 +/- 6, 99 +/- 28, 28 +/- 6 and 31 +/- 7, respectively. The strength of the tremor was reduced by all beta-blockers. Although 1.0 mg/kg nipradilol significantly reduced the tremor, further inhibition of the tremor was not obtained with dosages up to 2.5 mg/kg of the drug. In conclusion, nipradilol was effective for suppressing oxotremorine-induced tremor, as were other beta-blockers.", 
    "28": "Because the significance of P-glycoprotein in the in-vivo secretion of beta-blockers in intestinal epithelial cells is unclear, the secretory mechanism for beta-blockers and other drugs has been evaluated. Uptake of the beta-blockers acebutolol, celiprolol, nadolol and timolol, and the antiarrhythmic agent, quinidine by the multidrug-resistant leukaemic cell line variant K562/ADM was significantly lower than that by drug-sensitive K562 cells, suggesting that these beta-blockers are transported by P-glycoprotein out of cells. The reduced uptake of acebutolol by the drug-resistant K562/ADM cells was reversed by treating the cells with anti-P-glycoprotein monoclonal antibody, MRK16, whereas no such alteration in uptake was observed for drug-sensitive K562 cells. Acebutolol uptake by K562/ADM cells was, moreover, markedly enhanced, in a concentration-dependent manner, in the presence of the specific P-glycoprotein inhibitors, MS-209 and cyclosporin. Caco-2 cells were used for evaluation of the role of P-glycoprotein in intestinal permeability to drugs in-vitro. Basolateral-to-apical transport of acebutolol was twice that in the reverse direction. A similar polarized flux was also observed in the transport of vinblastine, but not in that of acetamide or mannitol. When in-vivo intestinal absorption was evaluated by the rat jejunal loop method, with simultaneous intravenous administration of a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, cyclosporin, intestinal absorption of both acebutolol and vinblastine increased 2.6- and 2.2-fold, respectively, but no such enhancement was observed in the absorption of acetamide. The effect of cyclosporin on the intestinal absorption of several drugs was further examined, and the extent of the contribution of P-glycoprotein as an absorption barrier to those drugs was evaluated. ATP depletion by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery resulted in a clear increase in epithelial permeability to vinblastine, but not to 3-O-methylglucose or acetamide, indicating that vinblastine is secreted by ATP-dependent P-glycoprotein into the lumen. These findings demonstrate that P-glycoprotein plays a role as an absorption barrier by transporting several drugs from intestinal cells into the lumen.", 
    "29": "The impact of anxiety neurosis on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with unexplained syncope (S) was assessed in 178 patients (91 women and 87 men) with an average age of 36.5 +/- 20 years, presenting with 10.7 +/- 24 episodes of S). None had evidence of underlying cardiac disease apart from 7 patients with mild hypertension. All patients underwent a tilt test (TT) at 60 degrees for 45 minutes. A bolus of isoproterenol was injected intravenously in subjects with negative TT. After the test, the patients were classified according to the presence (n = 38) or absence (n = 140) of anxiety neurosis based on the DSM III-R diagnostic. The TT was positive in 76 patients, 9 of whom had a cardioinhibitory reaction with prolonged asystole. Patients with anxiety had more episodes of S (24 +/- 43 versus 7 +/- 13; p = 0.001), a shorter interval between S (11.5 +/- 23 months versus 12.5 +/- 20 months, p = 0.02) but more negative TT (27/38 versus 75/140; p = 0.05). One hundred and sixty-eight patients were followed up : 10 were lost to follow-up. Preventive treatment was undertaken in 59 patients who were representative of the whole group with respect to age (30 +/- 18 years 39 +/- 21 years : p = 0.004). After an average follow-up of 24.5 +/- 15 months, 26 patients (15%) experienced a recurrence of S. The recurrence rate was identical in patients with positive and negative TT and in treated and untreated cases. On the other hand, recurrence was higher in those with anxiety (12/25 versus 14/117; p = 0.001) who also had less improvement of symptoms (12/15 versus 74/120; p = 0.001). The \"anxiety\" variable was therefore identified as being the only predictive factor for recurrence of syncope. The authors conclude that in patients referred for investigation of unexplained syncope, some suffer from anxiety neurosis, in whom the TT is usually negative, and have a higher risk of recurrence. They justify a specific therapeutic management.", 
    "30": "The combined death/infarct rate in the weeks following unstable angina ranges from 10 to 40%. Aspirin and GP IIb/IIIa antagonists reduce the mortality and morbidity, which has not been demonstrated with heparin. The short term clinical results of treatment with hirudin are better than those with heparin. A rebound biological effect after heparin or hirudin therapy may have adverse clinical consequences. Nitrate derivatives have a role to play and adjuvant therapy includes the betablockers and some calcium antagonists in special indications.", 
    "31": "The mortality of heart failure remains high despite recent therapeutic progress. The objectives of treatment are to relieve symptoms, but also to improve survival. The secondary objectives are extension of the duration of effort, improvement of the ejection fraction, reduction of arrhythmias and neuroendocrine disturbances, although these criteria are not strictly related to the primary objectives. Diuretics should be used from the first symptoms, but their effect on survival has not been evaluated. Digitalis alkaloids, with no effect on survival, also improve functional signs, even in patients in sinus rhythm. All other positive inotropic agents increase mortality. Nitrates improve symptoms and, when associated with hydralazine, prolong survival. Amiodarone should be reserved to patients with dangerous arrhythmias. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have the best demonstrated effect on survival and must be used as first-line treatment. Their preventive effect on mortality is limited, except in post-infarction ventricular dysfunction. Beta-blockers, which appear very promising for the improvement of survival, functional signs and ejection fraction, are currently under evaluation. Their mechanisms of action and the choice of the most active drugs have yet to be determined.", 
    "32": "Previous studies have shown that acute stress impairs risk assessment behavior in mice. The present study was undertaken to determine the role of beta adrenoceptors, which are known to be stimulated by stress, in this effect. Mice were treated with either a beta-1 antagonist, betaxolol, a beta-2 antagonist, ICI 118551, an alpha-1 antagonist, prazosin, or an alpha-2 antagonist, yohimbine, and 30 min later were subjected to a 1-h session of restraint stress. Thirty minutes after the stress the animals were tested for the entry latency, number of headpokes prior to entry, and the path of entry into a white open field from a small dark box. In agreement with previous findings, stress was found to markedly reduce risk assessment behaviors as reflected by a reduced entry latency, a reduced number of headpokes and a changed entry path from wall hugging to central entry. Betaxolol was found to prevent all of the above effects of stress dose dependently, whereas ICI 118551, prazosin, and yohimbine had no reversal effects. It is concluded that beta-1 receptor activation and possibly brain glycogen depletion is involved in the effects of stress on risk assessment behavior.", 
    "33": "Humans acutely exposed to anticholinesterase (anti-ChE) pesticides often become febrile, whereas rats and other rodents become markedly hypothermic. The rat may nonetheless be a useful model for anti-ChE toxicity because recent work using radiotelemetry demonstrated an elevation in core temperature of unrestrained rats for several days following acute exposure to the anti-ChE, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). To discern the mechanisms of DFP-induced hypothermia and hyperthermia, various pharmacological agents were administered acutely or chronically to rats injected with 1.5 mg/kg DFP (SC). Core temperature, heart rate, and motor activity were monitored continuously via radiotelemetry. Methylscopolamine, a peripheral muscarinic antagonist, attenuated the DFP-induced hypothermia by 1.0 degree C and reversed the DFP-induced bradycardia. Chronic scopolamine, a central and peripheral muscarinic antagonist, delivered via a subcutaneously implanted minipump (9.5 mg/kg/day) blocked DFP-induced hypothermia and hyperthermia. Propranolol (10 mg/kg; SC), a general beta blocker, augmented the bradycardic effects of DFP but had no effect on body temperature. Sodium salicylate (200 and 300 mg/kg; IP), an antipyretic that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, administered during the period of DFP-induced hyperthermia produced a transient recovery in body temperature. Overall, DFP-induced hypothermia and hyperthermia in the rat appear to be mediated via cholinergic activation in the CNS because both are blocked by scopolamine. The decrease in core temperature following sodium salicylate suggests that prostaglandin release is involved in the manifestation of DFP-induced hyperthermia. The elevation in core temperature after DFP appears to involve neurochemical pathways similar to that of fever.", 
    "34": "To determine which cytochrome P450 form is involved in the promethazine [10-(2-dimethylaminopropyl) phenothiazine] metabolism, in vitro analysis using human liver microsomes were performed. Promethazine was mainly biotransformed to ring-hydroxylated, S-oxidized and N-demethylated metabolites. The promethazine hydroxylase in human liver microsomes was inhibited by SKF-525A, propranolol, sparteine, quinidine and anti-CYP2D6 serum suggesting involvement of a P450 related to CYP2D6. Lineweaver-Burk plots for the hydroxylation, S-oxidation and N-demethylation indicated that the hydroxylation occurred with a low K(m) value in human liver microsomes. Microsomes from genetically-engineered human B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6 hydroxylated promethazine most efficiently as compared to other P450 forms, indicating that it was the principal P450 responsible for the metabolism of promethazine in human liver microsomes. The inhibition of CYP2D6-catalysed bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase by various histamine H3 antagonists including promethazine suggested that promethazine and some other histamine H1 antagonists could be inhibitors of this P450 in human liver microsomes.", 
    "35": "Exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) without demonstrable heart disease was studied in pediatric patients. The study population consisted of 17 patients aged 5-14 years (average 9.1 years), who demonstrated reproducible VT during or immediately after exercise testing using a treadmill. The main reasons for the exercise testing were episodes of exercise-related syncope in two patients, exercise-related palpitation in seven and evaluation of sporadic ventricular premature contraction (VPC) in eight. Of the eight patients in the asymptomatic group, two developed sustained VT and the other six had non-sustained VT. Of the nine patients in the symptomatic group, six developed sustained VT. Verapamil produced a good response in seven of 14 patients, and propranolol in six. None of the patients died during the follow-up period, an average of 59.6 months. In four patients, both VT and VPC disappeared, not only on exercise testing, but also on Holter electro-cardiograms, so the anti-arrhythmic agents were discontinued. One patient had syncope and convulsion caused by rapid bidirectional VT in the follow-up period. It was concluded that the prognosis of exercise-induced VT without demonstrable heart disease in children is relatively benign, but careful follow-up is required.", 
    "36": "The classical understanding of the mechanism of anti-anginal or anti-ischemic drugs is an increase in blood supply to the heart and/or a decrease in oxygen consumption of the heart, maintaining energy balance in the heart between supply and demand and hence maintaining the tissue levels of high-energy phosphates. This scheme is reasonable. During reperfusion following ischemia, however, there is more serious damage to the heart, although the tissue levels of high-energy phosphates increase. This is probably because toxic substances are generated in the heart during ischemia/reperfusion. We propose that both lysophosphatidylcholine and palmitoyl-L-carnitine that accumulate in the myocardium during ischemia/reperfusion are candidates for the toxic substances that accelerate ischemia/reperfusion damage to the heart. Therefore, drugs that have anti-lysophosphatidylcholine and/or anti-palmitoyl-L-carnitine effects are promising for the treatment of ischemic heart diseases. We found that K-7259, a novel derivative of dilazep having a minimal effect on the normal heart, is a drug that attenuates the deleterious effects of both lysophosphatidylcholine and palmitoyl-L-carnitine on the heart, and therefore attenuates the ischemia/reperfusion damage.", 
    "37": "We have studied the autonomic nervous function in voles (Microtus arvalis) and mice. For this purpose, ECGs were recorded from conscious and unrestrained voles and mice using radiotelemetry and the autonomic nervous function was investigated by the power spectral analysis of heart rate variability. Heart rate in voles was lower than mice and the coefficient of variance was larger in voles. In the power spectra of voles and mice, there were two major spectral components with the high frequency (HF) peak generally appearing between 2.0 and 4.0 Hz, and the low frequency (LF) peak appearing below 0.6 Hz. On the basis of this data, we set the two frequency bands as LF (0.1-1.0 Hz) and HF (1.0-5.0 Hz) to evaluate autonomic nervous function. The LF and HF powers were larger in voles than mice. The LF/HF ratio was thought to provide a convenient index of autonomic nervous balance and was smaller in voles than mice. The LF powers in both species were reduced by atropine, but propranolol reduced the LF power only in mice. The HF power was reduced by atropine only in voles. The intrinsic heart rate produced by a double blockade with atropine and propranolol in voles was almost the same as control levels, but in mice was lower than controls. The ratio of the LF and HF powers by a double blockade were almost the same as those of the administration of atropine in voles, but nearer to propranolol in mice. These results suggested that the parasympathetic nervous function was predominant in voles, but the sympathetic one was predominant in mice.", 
    "38": "We evaluated the effects of 0.5% betaxolol hydrochloride and 0.5% timolol maleate on retinal blood flow. We measured the diameter of the retinal artery (Da) and vein (Dv), and retinal venous blood flow rate (V) in 8 healthy young volunteers by laser speckle velocimetry before and after the application of betaxolol or timolol topically to both eyes daily for one week. There were no any significant changes. Da before and after the application of betaxolol was 114.2 +/- 6.3 (mean +/- standard deviation) microns and 115.6 +/- 6.7 microns and before and after the application of timolol, 117.5 +/- 12.7 microns and 101.3 +/- 9.5 microns. Dv before and after the application of betaxolol was 149.5 +/- 11.1 microns and 148.4 +/- 13.3 microns, and before and after the application of timolol 148.5 +/- 9.2 microns and 146.2 +/- 10.3 microns. V before and after the application of timolol was 12.3 +/- 2.6 mm/s and 12.6 +/- 2.4 mm/s, and before and after the application of betaxolol, 11.6 +/- 1.5 mm/s and 11.4 +/- 2.1 mm/s. Thus one-week application of the beta-blockers, betaxolol and timolol did not change the retinal arterial or venous blood flow.", 
    "39": "An 11-year-old, 25-kg girl with congenital myelomeningocele was scheduled for posterior spinal fusion because of progressive scoliosis. After induction of general anesthesia and administration of a standard dose of intravenous esmolol hydrochloride, her cardiac rhythm progressed to asystole. Although given ephedrine, epinephrine, and atropine sulfate, the patient's normal heart rhythm could not be restored until calcium chloride was administered. A review of the medical literature indicates that the optimal treatment for acute beta-blocker toxicity is intravenous glucagon. Calcium administration should also be considered. Acute esmolol toxicity may be self-limiting because of its extremely short half-life.", 
    "40": "Beta-blocking agents reduce mortality and improve symptoms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). There have been reports that diltiazem, a calcium-blocking agent, is also effective in such patients. We prospectively compared the effects of the beta-blocking agent bisoprolol with those of the calcium-blocking agent diltiazem in 18 patients (11 males and 7 females, age 14 to 68) with DCM. The 18 patients, (10 in New York Heart Association functional class III and 8 in class IV) were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Bisoprolol was administered as the first drug in 10 patients and diltiazem was administered in 8. Cross-over to bisoprolol was also performed in 3 patients. At the end of the study, among the 13 patients who had been given bisoprolol, 9 showed a good response (efficacy rate: 69%). In contrast, only 3 of the 8 patients who received diltiazem showed a good response (efficacy rate: 37.5%). Among the patients in NYHA class III, all 7 (100%) who were treated with bisoprolol responded but only 2 of the 4 (50%) treated with diltiazem responded (p < 0.05). Among the patients in class IV, 2 of 6 (33%) responded to bisoprolol and 1 of 4 (25%) responded to diltiazem (not significant). These results suggest that diltiazem, like bisoprolol, has a beneficial effect in patients with DCM, with a greater effect in class III patients. However, we conclude that diltiazem should usually be used as a second choice to improve heart failure in DCM, and as the first medication only in those with contraindications to beta-blocking agents.", 
    "41": "We present a 15-year-old girl with an unusual clinical course of intractable thyrotoxicosis that was resistant to thiocarbamide therapy and propranolol. Although the latter beta-adrenergic blocking agent has been used as the sole drug in the preparation of thyrotoxicosis patients for thyroidectomy, it was unsatisfactory for control of our case. In contrast, the patient's clinical response to lithium carbonate 900-1500 mg/d for 10 days was very good and no side effects were observed. This demonstrates the importance of lithium as the drug of choice in thyrotoxic emergencies and uncontrolled preoperative patients when rapid and safe inhibition of thyroid hormone secretion is required.", 
    "42": "Beta adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) are an important class of drugs in the management of patients with cardiovascular diseases. These drugs have been shown to reduce mortality in hypertension and prolong survival in patients with coronary heart disease. Although hypertension and coronary heart disease account for the majority of excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in blocks, beta-blockers continue to be underprescribed in this ethnic group. The magnitude of blood pressure reduction in black patients with hypertension has been consistently less during monotherapy with nonselective beta-blockers than with diuretics. However, the highly selective beta-blocker bisoprolol has been shown to be as effective as diuretics and is equally effective in black and nonblack patients with hypertension. In general, no racial differences in efficacy are noted when beta-blockers are used with diuretics as combination therapy for hypertension. Black patients should not be denied beta-blocker therapy because of an anticipated suboptimal response, especially when there are clear indications for treatment (e.g., for migraine, hyperthyroidism, arrhythmia control, and after myocardial infarction).", 
    "43": "Specific beta 1-adrenoceptors antagonist [3H]CGP 26505 binding was characterized in rat cerebral cortex and heart sinus atrial node. In both tissues [3H]CGP 26505 binding was maximal at 25 degrees C, it was specific, saturable and protein concentration dependent. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms of specific [3H]CGP 26505 binding in cerebral cortex showed that [3H]CGP 26505 binds a single class of high affinity sites with a dissociation constant (KD) of 1 +/- 0.3 nM and a maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) of 40 +/- 2 fmol/mg of protein. In sinus atrial node, [3H]-CGP 26505 binds a single class of high affinity sites (KD = 1.9 +/- 0.4 nM, Bmax = 28 +/- 2 fmol/mg of protein).", 
    "44": "The effects of arginine vasotocin (AVT) were examined in isolated gar arteries (afferent branchial, ABA; conus arteriosus, CA; ventral aorta, VA) and veins (hepatic, HV; intestinal; ovarian). AVT (10(-11) - 10(-7) M) had no effect in CA, produced contraction in ABA and VA and stimulated relaxation in veins. In precontracted HV, AVT relaxation was dose-dependent, long-lived (> 30 min) and reduced total tension by 49.0 +/- 10.7%. EC50s for AVT, arginine vasopressin, oxytocin, desmopressin, and isotocin in gar HV were 1.4 +/- 0.3, 3.6 +/- 0.2, 5.3 +/- 1.7, 11.0 +/- 6.5, and 19.0 +/- 0.4 nM, respectively. AVT was more potent compared with isotocin. Strength of relaxation (percentage decrease in total tension) of AVT and structural analogs was similar (range = 32.5 to 55%). Endothelium removal did not alter percentage relaxation or sensitivity to AVT in HV. AVT relaxation was not inhibited by nitric oxide synthase inhibitors or propranolol or reversed by addition of methylene blue but it was significantly enhanced by indomethacin (10(-5) M). Arginine vasopressin-receptor antagonists (V1- or V2-type selectivity; 10(-6) M) were equally effective inhibitors, each blocked 99% of AVT relaxation. Forskolin (10(-6) M) and papaverine (10(-4) M) relaxed precontracted gar arteries and veins. The adenylyl cyclase inhibitors SQ 22536 and MDL 12,330A (10(-5) M) produced transient contraction and stable relaxation, respectively, but did not inhibit AVT-induced relaxation in HV. Atrial natriuretic peptide (3 x 10(-8) M) and sodium nitroprusside (10(-4) M) had no effect in precontracted HV. AVT acts directly on gar venous smooth muscle cells via a nonclassical AVP receptor, possibly by increasing [cAMP]. AVT is a potent vasoconstrictor in vertebrate vasculature but produces a novel relaxation in gar veins.",

    "46": "Epinephrine 1% was applied unilaterally to pigmented rabbits. At selected time points between 10 min and 6 hr, a 2.5-mm diameter iris-ciliary body, in the treated eye, was irradiated with 2 J diode laser (2 W for 1 sec). Instant heat generated by the irradiation deactivated the cellular enzymes used in the synthesis and degradation of cAMP. Rabbits were sacrificed immediately, and samples of the iris-ciliary body were isolated from the irradiated area, the non-irradiated area, and from the contralateral, untreated eye. Levels of cAMP in these samples and in the aqueous humor were determined by radioimmunoassay. Further experiments were performed in rabbits pretreated with an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine, and a beta-adrenergic antagonist, timolol, 30 min before the epinephrine treatment. Unilateral laser photocoagulation of the iris-ciliary body was performed at 10 min and 1 hr after the epinephrine treatment.", 
    "47": "The cAMP level in the photocoagulated iris-ciliary body did not change in parallel to the change in the aqueous humor. An increase of aqueous humor cAMP was observed for 6 hr. However, a reduction of cAMP level in the photocoagulated iris-ciliary body was observed at 1 hr after the epinephrine treatment. In yohimbine-pretreated rabbits, the reduction of cAMP level in the photocoagulated iris-ciliary body was absent. Pretreatment with timolol had no effect.", 
    "48": "These observations suggest that, at 1 hr after the epinephrine treatment, the cellular signal via the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the iris-ciliary body, which reduces the intracellular cAMP level, is stronger than that via the beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "49": "Both systemic and central injections of glucose can enhance memory. For example, glucose reverses impairments on inhibitory avoidance resulting from intra-amygdala injections of morphine. The present experiment investigated the ability of glucose to reverse memory impairments resulting from intra-amygdala injections of propranolol, a beta-noradrenergic antagonist. Pretraining administration of 10 microg propranolol significantly reduced inhibitory avoidance retention latencies but had no effect on performance in a spontaneous alternation task. Coadministration of glucose into the amygdala at 3 doses (1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 microg) did not reverse the propranolol-induced inhibitory avoidance deficits. However, coadministration of 2.5 microg of glutamate with the propranolol did reverse these deficits. The ability of glucose to reverse impairments following intra-amygdala injections of morphine but not propranolol may reflect the neurotransmitter system or systems through which glucose exerts its effects.", 
    "50": "The Harderian glands are innervated by sympathetic fibers originating in the superior cervical ganglia. The aim of this study is to characterize the beta-adrenergic receptors in the rat Harderian gland. The characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptors were determined in crude membrane preparations from rat Harderian gland, using [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) as radioligand. The binding of the ligand to the receptor is rapid, reversible, saturable, specific and dependent on time, temperature and membrane concentration. At 30 degrees C, stoichiometric data suggest the presence of one binding site with a Kd value of 0.29 nM and Bmax of 32 pmol/L. The interaction shows a high degree of specificity for beta-adrenergic agonists and blockers, as suggested by competitive displacement experiment with isoproterenol (IC50 = 19.1 nM), propranolol (IC50 = 28.1 nM), and norepinephrine (IC50 = 96.3 nM). Clonidine, yohimbine, methoxamine, and prazosin are ineffective at concentrations up to 1 microM. In the other hand, binding of [125I]CYP by Harderian gland membranes exhibits day-night variations. Binding values are low during the daytime and increase progressively late in the evening to reach a maximum at 2200 h (2 h after the onset of dark period), but decreased to the end of the dark period (0600 h). In conclusion, the results presented in this paper show the functional and pharmacological characterization of beta-adrenergic receptors in the rat Harderian gland. This neurotransmitter may play a physiological role at this level regulating, at least, processes such as a thyroid hormone metabolism.", 
    "51": "We investigated the systemic and splanchnic haemodynamic effects of combined treatment with molsidomine and propranolol on cirrhotic rats. Liver cirrhosis was produced by repeated intraperitoneal injections of thioacetamide. The blood flow of each organ was measured serially using the radioactive microsphere method in the awake state before and after the administration of each agent. Cirrhotic rats received molsidomine (0-.5 mg/kg), propranolol (0.1 or 0.2 mg/min), both agents or placebo. Combination treatment with molsidomine and 0.1 mg/min propranolol significantly reduced portal pressure compared with molsidomine or propranolol alone (21 +/- 4 vs 15 +/- 3 or 11 +/- 2% P < 0.05). Systemic haemodynamic changes with this combined treatment were mild. This combined treatment slightly inhibited the molsidomine-induced decrease in portal vascular resistance (27 +/- 9 vs 31 +/- 6; NS) and markedly inhibited the molsidomine-induced decrease in splanchnic arterial resistance (7 +/- 6 vs 27 +/- 5% P < 0.05). Compared with low-dose propranolol administration, the combined treatment was associated with a significant decrease in portal vascular resistance (27 +/- 9% decrease vs 2 +/- 2% increase; P < 0.001) and a significant decrease in splanchnic arterial resistance (7 +/- 6% decrease vs 5 +/- 4% increase P < 0.05). The combination of molsidomine and high-dose propranolol (0.2 mg/min) caused a marked reduction in portal venous inflow, mean arterial pressure and cardiac index. We conclude that propranolol enhances the molsidomine-induced decrease in portal pressure by splanchnic vasoconstriction in association with a slight decrease in portal vascular resistance. The combination therapy with molsidomine and low-dose propranolol combination had more beneficial and less harmful effects on systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics and thus appears to be a superior method for treating portal hypertension.", 
    "52": "1. This study is concerned with the supply of metabolic substrates for neuronal metabolism. Experiments were carried out to investigate whether mechanisms demonstrated in cultured astrocytes also occurred in vivo; these were cAMP-mediated breakdown of glycogen and glutamate uptake-stimulated release of lactate. 2. In vivo microdialysis was used in freely moving rats. Lactate and glucose in the dialysate were assayed using enzyme-based on-line assays. Drugs were given locally through the dialysis probe. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured using the hydrogen clearance method. 3. There was an increase in dialysate glucose in response to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline and to 8-bromo-cAMP, an analogue of cAMP, the second messenger of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The effect of isoprenaline was blocked by the antagonist propranolol. Isoprenaline had no effect on dialysate lactate, which was increased by the glutamate uptake blocker beta-D,L-threohydroxyaspartate (THA). 4. Physiological stimulation of neuronal activity produced an increase in both lactate and glucose. The increase in lactate was depressed in the presence of THA but was unaffected by propranolol. The increase in glucose was blocked by propranolol. Regional cerebral blood flow was increased by physiological stimulation but was unaffected by propranolol. 5. These results demonstrate that physiologically stimulated increases in glucose and lactate in the brain are mediated by different mechanisms.",

    "55": "Compared with those who received placebo, the patients taking nadolol showed significant improvement on total BPRS score, particularly on the thought disturbance and activation factors, after the first treatment week (p = .05). By the end of the second treatment week, the patients taking placebo also began to show improvement, and the group differences were no longer significant. The patients treated with nadolol showed significantly more improvement on Simpson-Angus scores than those who received placebo (p = .03). However, there was no significant correlation between BPRS and Simpson-Angus changes. In the nadolol group, patients with and without akathisia showed no significant difference in their BPRS scores.", 
    "56": "These findings suggest that adjunctive nadolol may be useful in the treatment of acutely aggressive schizophrenic patients by inducing a more rapid and consistent decrease of overall psychiatric symptoms and by reducing the extrapyramidal effects. Our results raise the possibility that the mechanism of action of nadolol on psychiatric symptoms in schizophrenic patients may be different from the mechanism of improvement of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia. Nadolol may be a helpful adjunctive treatment for schizophrenic patients in general and not just for those with a high hostility level.",

    "62": "1. Several recent in vitro studies have suggested that production of nitric oxide (NO) from the islet NO system may have an important regulatory influence on the secretion of insulin and glucagon. In the present paper we have investigated, mainly with an in vivo approach, the influence and specificity of the NO synthase (NOS) blocker NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on L-arginine-induced secretion of insulin and glucagon. 2. In freely fed mice, L-NAME pretreatment (1.2 mmol kg-1) influenced the dynamics of insulin and glucagon release following an equimolar dose of L-arginine, the specific substrate for NOS activity, in that the NOS inhibitor enhanced the insulin response but suppressed the glucagon responses. This was reflected in a large decrease in the plasma glucose levels of the L-NAME pretreated animals. 3. L-NAME pretreatment did not influence the insulin and glucagon secretory responses to the L-arginine-enantiomer D-arginine, which cannot serve as a substrate for NOS activity. 4. Replacing L-NAME pretreatment by pretreatment with D-arginine or L-arginine itself, which both carry the same cationic change and are devoid of NOS inhibitory properties, did not mimic the effects of L-NAME on L-arginine-induced hormone release. 5. Fasting the animals for 24 h totally abolished the L-NAME-induced potentiation of L-arginine stimulated insulin release suggesting that the sensitivity of the beta-cell secretory machinery to NO-production is greatly changed in the fasting state. However, the L-NAME-induced suppression of L-arginine stimulated glucagon release was unaffected by starvation. 6. In isolated islets from freely fed mice, L-arginine (5 mM) stimulated insulin release was greatly enhanced and glucagon release markedly suppressed by the presence of the NOS inhibitor L-NAME in the incubation medium. These effects were abolished in isolated islets taken from 24 h fasted mice. 7. Our present results, which showed that the NOS inhibitor L-NAME markedly enhances insulin release but suppresses glucagon release induced by L-arginine in the intact animal, give strong support to our previous hypothesis that the islet NO system is a negative modulator of insulin secretion and a positive modulator of glucagon secretion. Additionally, we observed that the importance of the beta-cell NO-production for secretory mechanisms, as evaluated by the effect of L-NAME on L-arginine-induced insulin release, was greatly changed after starvation, an effect less prominent with regard to glucagon release.",

Therapeutic dosing with fluvoxamine (100 mg day-1) for 2 weeks caused a significant increase in the 0-8 h urinary S/R ratio of mephenytoin from 0.16 to 0.55 (95% confidence interval for difference between means: 0.28-0.50; P < 0.01), accompanied by a 54% reduction in the 0-8 h urinary recovery of 4'-hydroxymephenytoin (95% confidence interval for difference between means: 3.64-16.24 mg; P < 0.05). However, this did not alter the assigned phenotype of any of the subjects based on the established antimode of 0.95 (S/R-mephenytoin ratio). Two weeks after fluvoxamine was discontinued, both metabolic indices returned to their pre-study values. By contrast, fluvoxamine had no effect on either 0-8 h urinary metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratio (95% confidence interval for difference between means: -0.38-0.46; P > 0.05) or the 0-8 h urinary recovery of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (95% confidence interval for difference between means: -0.61-0.70 mg; P > 0.05). These results indicated fluvoxamine has a modest inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP2C19, but no effect on that of CYP2D6 in vivo.", 
    "64": "We tested the hypothesis that exposure to altitude decreases reliance on free fatty acids (FFA) as substrates and increases dependency on blood glucose. Therefore, the effects of exercise, hypobaric hypoxia, and altitude acclimatization on FFA, glycerol and net glucose uptake and release [= 2(leg blood flow)(arteriovenous concentration)] and on fatty acid (FA) consumption by the legs (= 3 x glycerol release + FFA uptake) were measured. Because sympathetic responses have been implicated, we utilized nonspecific beta-blockade and observed responses to exercise, altitude, and altitude acclimatization. We studied six healthy beta-blocked men (beta) and five matched controls (C) during rest and cycle ergometry exercise (88 W) at 49% of sea-level (SL) peak O2 uptake at the same absolute power output on acute altitude exposure (A1; barometric pressure = 430 Torr) and after 3 wk of chronic altitude exposure to 4,300 m (A2). During exercise at SL, FA consumption rates increased (P < 0.05). On arrival at 4,300 m, resting leg FFA uptake and FA consumption rates were not significantly different from those at SL. However, after acclimatization to altitude, at rest leg FA consumption decreased to essentially zero in both C and beta groups. During exercise to altitude after acclimatization, leg FA consumption increased significantly, but values were less than at SL or A1 (P < 0.05), whereas glucose uptake increased relative to SL values. Furthermore, beta-blockade significantly increased glucose uptake relative to control. We conclude that 1) chronic altitude exposure decreases leg FA consumption during rest and exercise; 2) relative to SL FFA uptake decreases while glucose uptake increases during exercise at altitude; and 3) beta-blockade potentiates these effects.",

A 71-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation successfully suppressed with sotalol, 80 mg bid, was started on terfenadine, 60 mg bid. Eight days later, she developed repeated self-terminating episodes of torsades de pointes. Sotalol and terfenadine were discontinued, and no further arrhythmia was observed after 72 hours of temporary pacing was discontinued.", 
    "66": "Administration of propranolol can provoke bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients. Recently, we successfully developed a guinea-pig model for propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction (PIB). We hypothesized that such bronchoconstriction may result from the inflammatory mediators released by an allergic reaction. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in the development of PIB after allergic reaction. Propranolol, at a concentration of 10 mg.mL-1 was inhaled 20 min after antigen challenge in passively sensitized, anaesthetized and artificially-ventilated guinea-pigs. The animals were treated intravenously with PAF antagonists, E6123 (1 and 10 micrograms.kg-1) or Y-24180 (1 and 10 mg.kg-1), 10 min before or 15 min after antigen challenge. Propranolol inhaled 20 min after antigen challenge caused bronchoconstriction. E6123 and Y-24180 administered 15 min after antigen challenge as well as 10 min before antigen challenge reduced the PIB in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that platelet-activating factor may contribute to the development of propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction after allergic reaction in our guinea-pig model.", 
    "67": "Cyclandelate inhibits calcium-induced contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells, platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, platelet-activating-factor and adenosine, and also suppresses a provoked 5HT release from platelets. This pharmacological profile suggests that cyclandelate may have a potential prophylactic effect in migraine. To test this hypothesis, a double-blind multicentre study was performed in 214 patients to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of cyclandelate compared to placebo and propranolol. After a 4-week baseline period, eligible patients (randomization 3:2:3) were treated for 12 weeks with daily doses of 1.200 mg cyclandelate (n = 81), placebo (n = 55) or 120 mg propranolol (n = 78). The number of migraine attacks (> or = 50% responders) and the migraine duration/month were compared based on the difference between baseline and the last 4 weeks of prophylactic treatment. The percentage of patients with a reduction in migraine attacks of > or = 50% treated with cyclandelate (37.0%) or propranolol (42.3%) was not significantly superior to placebo (30.9%; p > 0.025). The mean duration of migraine in hours (h) per month decreased in both active treatment groups (cyclandelate: 36.8 h, p = 0.046; propranolol: 34.4 h, p = 0.039) compared to placebo (13.7 h) without reaching statistical significance (alpha/2 = 0.025). The clinical efficacy of cyclandelate and propranolol was comparable. Adverse experiences were reported by 13 patients (16.0%) treated with cyclandelate, by 5 patients (9.1%) treated with placebo and by 19 patients (24.4%) treated with propranolol. These were drug-related in 7.1% (n = 6) of patients treated with cyclandelate and in 9% (n = 7) of patients treated with propranolol. In summary, cyclandelate has a comparable efficacy to that of propranolol, an established drug of first choice in the prophylaxis of migraine. Both drugs were better than placebo, but not significantly so. Both active treatments were well tolerated.", 
    "68": "The aim of the present study was to establish a concentration-response relationship for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated increase of 86Rb+ efflux, and to characterize the sensitivity of this response to the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. Isolated rat hearts were perfused retrogradely at constant flow and at 31 degrees. Timolol (10(-6) mol/l) was used to block beta-adrenoceptors. After a loading period with 86Rb+ and 55 min. washout, the hearts were exposed to phenylephrine in a concentration range from 3 x 10(-8) mol/l to 10(-4) mol/l. Control experiments comparing the effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation on 86Rb+ efflux and 42K+ efflux were performed. alpha 1-Adrenoceptor stimulation increased the 86Rb+ efflux with a pD2 = 6.35 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- S.E.M). The maximal response to phenylephrine was 22.5 +/- 2.0% (mean +/- S.E.M.) of the control values. The concentration-response curve was shifted to higher concentration of agonist in the presence of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (3 x 10(10) mol/l). The calculated inhibition constant for prazosin was 6.1 x 10(-11) mol/l. 86Rb+ was found to be a suitable K+ analogue in the study of relative changes in K+ efflux although the basal efflux kinetics were different for the two isotopes.",

    "72": "The permeability coefficients (Kp), which were dependent on partition coefficients (PC), of all the prodrugs were markedly increased compared to the parent drug. In full-thickness skin, the (R) caproyl-PL (CR-PL) showed the highest Kp, which was about 52-fold greater than that of PL. Most of the more lipophilic prodrugs showed stereoselectivity in Kp (R > S). All the prodrugs underwent stereoselective hydrolysis (R > S) during penetration. The prodrugs which showed stereoselectivity in permeation were comparatively lipophilic and showed great differences in hydrolysis percentages between the enantiomers. Permeation studies with stripped skin revealed that prodrugs were more permeable across stratum corneum compared to PL, whereas reverse was happened across viable skin. Although CR-PL showed high stereoselectivity in permeation across full-thickness skin and underwent higher percent of concurrent stereoselective cutaneous hydrolysis, the prodrug showed no stereoselectivity in permeation across DFP, an esterase inhibitor, treated skin and the concurrent cutaneous hydrolysis was also stopped.", 
    "73": "Lipophilic prodrugs may readily pass the stratum corneum but may not be able to penetrate so easily through the deeper tissues. Unlike the (S) isomers, the (R) isomers of lipophilic prodrugs almost completely converted to propranolol in epidermis and can easily pass through the dermis layer, resulting in stereoselective penetration.", 
    "74": "1. The potentiation of glycine receptor-mediated taurine response (Itau) by alpha 1 adrenoceptor activation was investigated in neurons freshly dissociated from the rat substantia nigra (SN) using a nystatin perforated-patch recording. 2. Norepinephrine (NE) at a concentration of 10(-4) M in the presence of 10(-5) M yohimbine and 10(-5) M propranolol potentiated the peak amplitude of Itau (10(-3) M) at a holding potential of -40 mV under voltage clamp conditions. NE could be substituted by phenylephrine at this potentiation. 3. This potentiation of the taurine response persisted in the treatment with pertussis toxin (500 ng/ml) for 18 h. The intracellular application of GDP-beta S (100 microM) with a conventional whole cell patch recording mode abolished the effect of alpha 1 adrenoceptor activation on the Itau. 4. Staurosporine (10(-7) M) blocked the enhancement of Itau by 10(-4) M NE with 10(-5) M yohimbine and 10(-5) M propranolol. In additional phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (10(-5) M) potentiated Itau. 5. The intracellular application of 0.275 U/ml protein kinase C (PKC) with a conventional whole cell configuration gradually increased the peak amplitude of Itau. On the other hand, intracellular perfusion either without PKC or with PKC plus 4 microM PKC (19-36), a PKC inhibitor, did not potentiate Itau. 6. A single channel recording in a cell attached configuration revealed that NE (10(-4) M) with 10(-5) M yohimbine and 10(-5) M propranolol increased the total open time of the taurine-activated channel. This increase of the channel opening was antagonized by staurosporine (10(-7) M). 7. Neither tapsigargin (10(-6) M), LiCl (10(-4) M), trifluoperazine (10(-5) M) nor (S)-5-isoquinolinesulfonic acid, 4-[2-[(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl) methylamino]-3-oxo-(4-phenyl-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]phenyl ester (10(-4) M) applied in the perfusate were found to affect the potentiation of Itau by alpha 1 adrenoceptor. The intracellular application of inositol triphosphates (10(-4) M) in a conventional whole cell recording also had no effect on Itau. 8. These findings thus indicate that alpha 1 adrenoceptor coupled with pertussis-insensitive G protein increases the intracellular PKC activity, thus leading to an increase in the channel opening activated by taurine and an enhancement of the peak amplitude of Itau in the SN neurons.", 
    "75": "The aim of this study was to clarify the actions of propranolol and isosorbide-5-mononitrate upon the portal circulation.", 
    "76": "Portal haemodynamics were assessed in 16 patients with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunts. A reverse thermodilution catheter was positioned in the portal vein, and portal vein pressure and portal vein flow were measured directly. The effects of propranolol 80 mg and isosorbide-5-mononitrate 20 mg over 1 h were determined independently.",

In contrast, isosorbide-5-mononitrate tended to increase portal vein flow (814 +/- 186 to 911 +/- 211 mL/min; P = 0.06) whilst reducing portal pressure significantly (108 +/- 12 to 92 +/- 10 mmHg P = 0.014). This suggests a fall in intrahepatic resistance and provides no evidence for baroreceptor-mediated reflex splanchnic vasoconstriction.",

    "79": "Because major cardiovascular disease states are characterized by defects in adenylyl cyclase regulation, it becomes important to understand the mechanisms by which adenylyl cyclase activators affect inotropy and chronotropy in intact conscious animals. Accordingly, we examined the inotropic and chronotropic responses to forskolin in 11 normal conscious, chronically instrumented dogs and 3 dogs with ventricular denervation (VD). Left ventricular first derivative of pressure (LV dP/dt) increased by 96 +/- 7%, P < 0.05, in response to forskolin (50 nmol.kg-1.min-1) in normal dogs and by significantly less, 52 +/- 14%, in VD dogs. Circulating norepinephrine (NE) levels increased similarly in both groups (from 226 +/- 18 to 389 +/- 33 pg/ml in normal dogs, from 177 +/- 23 to 329 +/- 71 pg/ml in VD dogs). In the presence of ganglionic blockade, the increase in LV dP/dt in response to forskolin was reduced (+62 +/- 4%) in normal dogs but was unchanged in VD dogs (+52 +/- 12%). Ganglionic blockade abolished the increase in circulating NE levels in both groups. Increases in heart rate in the presence of ganglionic blockade (+54 +/- 6 beats/min) were less than in the presence of atropine alone (+92 +/- 10 beats/min). Notably, the LV dP/dt and heart rate responses to forskolin were further attenuated by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in the presence and absence of ganglionic blockade. Morphine also attenuated the increases in both LV dP/dt and plasma NE in response to forskolin. Increases in LV dP/dt in response to NKH-477 (30 micrograms/kg), a water-soluble forskolin derivative, were similar before and after ganglionic blockade (+63 +/- 8 and +51 +/- 10%, respectively). However, in vitro experiments in LV sarcolemmal membrane preparations demonstrated that stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin and NKH-477 was not affected by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. These results indicate that in conscious dogs, inotropic and chronotropic effects of forskolin are not only due to direct activation of adenylyl cyclase, but the effects also are mediated by neural mechanisms and potentiated by the prevailing level of sympathetic tone.", 
    "80": "Heart rate variability (HRV) depends on various reflexes, including the baroreflex or respiratory reflex. Experimental studies have suggested that the sinoatrial node density in G protein-linked receptors may be involved. Transgenic mice, with a specific eightfold atrial overexpression of human beta 1-adrenoceptor (beta 1-AR), have been generated to evaluate the role of the atrial beta 1-AR density on HRV. The heart rate was monitored using telemetry, and the signal was analyzed using a quantitative time-frequency domain analysis, the smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville method, and phase portrait maps. 1) Heart rate was unchanged, but the two normal components of HRV were decreased in transgenic mice. Transgenic mice have an unshortened life span and no arrhythmias. 2) Challenge of the animals by propranolol showed no modulation of the HRV in transgenic mice compared with controls. 3) In isolated atrial strips from transgenic mice, basal contractility was increased and there was no isoproterenol-induced inotropic effect. 4) The basal level of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate production was lowered in transgenic mice, suggesting a shift in adenylate cyclase isoforms.", 
    "81": "Although alterations in beta 2-adrenergic receptor (AR) responsiveness may in part explain reports linking deterioration of asthma control with beta-agonist treatment of asthmatics, few data exist on beta 2-AR regulation in human airway cells. We have employed a bronchoscopy model to examine inflammation- and beta-agonist-induced alterations in human bronchial epithelial cell beta 2-AR density and responsiveness. Allergic asthmatic subjects participated in 2-day protocols examining airways before and 24 h after segmental antigen challenge (SAC) with ragweed. To assess the effect of acute beta-agonist exposure, bronchoscopies were performed both with (+ beta-Ag) and without (-beta-Ag) inhalation of beta-agonist 30 min before the procedure. Measurements of inflammatory cell infiltration were obtained by analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and beta 2-AR density and responsiveness were examined in bronchial epithelial cells obtained by bronchoscopic brushing. Neither SAC nor acute beta-agonist administration alone significantly affected epithelial cell beta 2-AR density. beta-Agonist-stimulated adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) generation was significantly lower in the + beta-Ag groups compared with the-beta-Ag group, demonstrating acute agonist-specific beta 2-AR desensitization in vivo. SAC caused a small, statistically insignificant reduction in beta-Agonist-stimulated cAMP production in both -beta-Ag or + beta-Ag groups. These lata suggest that acute beta-agonist inhalation, but not airway inflammation, significantly reduces maximal beta 2-AR responsiveness in airway cells.", 
    "82": "The effects of denopamine, a nonparenteral partial beta agonist which is used clinically in Japan, on the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) were examined in rabbit ventricular cells. Denopamine stimulated basal ICa with a maximum response of +33.2% and a concentration for half-maximal response (EC50) of 0.039 microM. The maximum response of ICa was only a quarter of that induced by isoprenaline (ISO), while 10 microM denopamine elicited 70-75% of the maximum inotropic response in the papillary muscle preparations. The denopamine stimulation of ICa was abolished by selective beta 1 antagonists (atenolol or bisoprolol). Pretreatment with forskolin or dialysis with cAMP also abolished the stimulation. Denopamine, in turn, inhibited ISO-stimulated ICa. This inhibition was not affected by pretreatment with pertussis toxin or prazosin. The presence of denopamine at various concentrations caused a rightward shift in the concentration/response curve for ISO stimulation of ICa. The Schild plot for this effect had a slope of 0.99 and Kp of 0.20 microM. In the presence of guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) (0.5 mM) in the pipette, denopamine (10 microM) stimulated the ICa to 86 +/- 5% of the maximum response induced by ISO. These findings indicate that denopamine modulates ICa exclusively through the beta 1 adrenoceptor-adenylate cyclase pathway, that the stimulatory GTP-binding protein regulates the agonistic potency of denopamine, and that the signal from the beta 1 adrenoceptors is amplified between ICa and the tension development, which would contribute to the spare capacity of beta adrenoceptors.", 
    "83": "A new synthetic polymeric material has been investigated as an oral controlled-release system. The water soluble polymer consists of a non-cross-linked, ionic polymer possessing sulfonate functional groups: poly(sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium-co- methyl methacrylate) (PSPMK/MMA). Drug-resin complexes were obtained by preparing an aqueous solution of the polymer to which propranolol HCl as a model drug was added. Using either dextrose or microcrystalline cellulose as a tablet binder did not cause any problems in fabricating a compact drug-resinate tablet. The release of propranolol HCl from drug-resinate tablets (2.5 mm x 9.0 mm, 10% dextrose) was pseudo-zero-order kinetics from the beginning to the end for over 21 h. This was due to the greater contribution of drug release from the edge of the tablets. However, zero-order release tablets were obtained by increasing the radius to thickness ratio of the tablet to greater than 3.13. A mathematical model describing release kinetics from drug-resinate tablets predicted the effects of drug loading and the physical dimensions of the tablets by a heterogeneous dissociation/erosion-controlled mechanism. As the content of dextrose in the tablets increased, the dissociation/erosion rate constant (K0) increased due to the greater influx of water into the tablets along with counterions. As expected, the release rate was decreased as the stirring rate decreased from 100 to 50 rpm, resulting in the dissociation/erosion rate constant of 2.62-2.04 mg/cm2h, respectively. Therefore, this system has been proven to release drugs independent of the pH of simulated gastric/intestinal fluids (1.2 and 7.5) as well as the compression force of the tablet, which ranged from 1500 to 4400 lbs.",

In order to approach the main characteristics in an in vitro model, a coculture system of absorptive Caco-2 cells and mucus-secreting HT29-MTX cells was developed and the permeability of a range of different drugs was tested. Variable goblet cell frequency can be achieved, preserving a significant barrier to drug transport and maintaining the differentiated features of both cell types. Absorption rates for actively transported drugs are rather underestimated in the cell culture model when compared to in vivo data. However, a good correlation with fraction absorbed in humans was attained separating the range of passively transported drugs into two groups of well-absorbable compounds with Peff > or = 10 x 10(-6) cm/s and drugs that are absorbed 40-70% with Peff = 0.1-1 x 10(-5) cm/s.

The 2 products were administered according to a randomized 2-way crossover design to 24 healthy male volunteers. After drug administration, serial blood samples were collected over a period of 30 hours. Atenolol plasma concentrations were measured using an HPLC technique with fluorometric detection at an excitation and an emission wavelengths of 222 nm and 300 nm, respectively. The parametric 90% confidence intervals of the mean value of the ratio (Tenolol/Tenormin) of pharmacokinetic parameters were 0.90-1.12, 0.92-1.12, 0.88-1.14, and 0.91-1.09 for AUC0-30h, AUC0-infinity, Cmax, and t1/2. In each case values were within the acceptable bioequivalence range of 0.8-1.25. Point estimates of these parameters were 1.01, 1.02, 1.01, and 1.0. The parametric point estimate of the mean difference of Tmax between the 2 formulations (Tenolol-Tenormin) was 0.19 hours with a 90% confidence interval of -0.47-0.84, which overlaps with the stipulated bioequivalence range of +/- 0.64.

The widely used beta 1-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent metoprolol is metabolized via CYP2D6. The influence of pantoprazole on the pharmacokinetics of an orally administered zero order kinetics formulation (ZOK) of metoprolol was the objective of this study. Eighteen volunteers (9 female, 9 male, age 20-44 years) completed the randomized, double-blind crossover study. Each subject received either 95 mg metoprolol and placebo (reference (R)) or 95 mg metoprolol and 40 mg pantoprazole (test (T)) as oral doses (sid) for 5 consecutive days. On day 5 of each period serum concentrations of R- and S-metoprolol were determined and a treadmill ergometry was performed. The primary pharmacokinetic characteristics for extent and rate of absorption were AUC(0-24h) and % PTF, respectively. To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of metoprolol the excess area under the effect vs. time curve was calculated for heart rate during ergometry (AUCexHR). Point estimate and 90% confidence limits (CI) for the ratios of population medians of T and R were given. The respective point estimates (90% CI) of the ratios of both primary and secondary characteristics were entirely within the equivalence range of 0.80 and 1.25 for both enantiomers of metoprolol. Moreover, equivalence could be shown for the pharmacodynamic characteristic AUCexHR. Hence, it was concluded that pantoprazole does not interact with metoprolol pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Therefore, no dose adjustment of metoprolol during therapy with pantoprazole is necessary.", 
    "87": "Insulin increases both cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMC) and attenuates noradrenaline-induced vasoconstriction. In the present study, we aimed at investigation in hVSMC: 1) the interrelationships between insulin-induced increases of cGMP and cAMP; 2) the insulin effect on the catecholamine modulation of cAMP. Catecholamines cause both vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Vasoconstriction is attributable to the reduced synthesis of cAMP in hVSMC through alpha 2-adrenoceptors and to direct effects on calcium fluxes through alpha 1-adrenoceptors; vasodilation is attributable to the increased synthesis of cAMP through beta-adrenoceptors. In the present study, we determined the influence of insulin on cAMP in hVSMC incubated with or without: a) the inhibitor of guanylate cyclase methylene blue or the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA); b) the beta-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol and salbutamol; c) the physiological catecholamines noradrenaline and adrenaline; d) noradrenaline+the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol or the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine; e) noradrenaline+methylene blue of L-NMMA. We demonstrated that: 1) the inhibition of the insulin-induced cGMP synthesis blunts the insulin-induced increase of cAMP; 2) insulin induces a significant increase of cAMP also in the presence of isoproterenol, salbutamol, noradrenaline and adrenaline: the combined effects of insulin and catecholamines were additive in some, but not in all the experiments; 3) insulin enhances the cAMP concentrations induced by noradrenaline also in the presence of alpha 2- or beta-adrenergic antagonists; 4) in the presence of methylene blue or L-NMMA insulin does not modify the noradrenaline effects on cAMP.",

Despite the widespread use of antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with implanted cardioverter defibrillators, the effect of such drugs on defibrillation energy requirements in humans has not been well studied. Sotalol (in the d,l racemic form) is an antiarrhythmic with beta-blocking and cardiac refractoriness prolonging effects.

    "91": "1. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) activated a fast (70 ms to half maximum) and desensitizing inward current through non-selective channels conducting predominantly monovalent cations in neurons of Helix aspersa. 2. alpha-Methyl-5-HT was equipotent with 5-HT in activating this current, but the known selective agonists at vertebrate 5-HT3 receptors, 2-methyl-5-HT and arylbiguanides were ineffective (< 100 microM). 5-Methoxytryptamine which is inactive on vertebrate 5-HT3 receptors was a very weak agonist. 3. The responses were antagonized by the specific vertebrate 5-HT3 receptor blocker MDL-72222 (IC50 = 1 microM), but were only weakly affected by ondansetron (10 microM). The 5-HT2-type antagonist, ketanserin (< 5 microM) had no effect. The responses were also antagonized by the non-specific antagonists (+)-tubocurarine and strychnine. 4. Unitary currents through channels non-selective for monovalent cations, and with a conductance of 2pS, could be activated repeatedly by 5-HT or alpha-methyl-5-HT in outside-out patches from neurones exhibiting the fast 5-HT-activated current (I[5-HT]fast), even in the presence of 500 microM GDP-[beta S] in the recording pipette. This strongly supports direct-gating of these channels by 5-HT. The properties of these unitary currents resembled those of I[5-HT]fast. 5. The pharmacological properties of this molluscan 5-HT-operated, ligand-gated channel differed sufficiently from known vertebrate 5-HT3-type receptors to suggest that it represents a new class of 5-HT receptor.", 
    "92": "1. Cyanopindolol (CYP) is a potent antagonist at the beta 3-adrenoceptor in rat ileum. Several analogues of CYP and pindolol were synthesized that also produced antagonist effects at the beta 3-adrenoceptor. However, at high concentrations, these compounds appear to act as \"partial agonists'. This study was conducted to determine the structural requirements of CYP analogues necessary for antagonist activity and to examine the possibility that the agonist effects of CYP and its analogues may occur through a mechanism independent of beta-adrenoceptor activation. 2. Analogues of CYP and pindolol were tested for antagonist activity in rat ileum in which the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were blocked. Fourteen compounds were tested against (-)-isoprenaline, and four of the more potent analogues were then tested against BRL 37344. The two most potent antagonists were CYP and iodocyanopindolol. The pKb values (negative log of equilibrium dissociation constant) obtained against (-)-isoprenaline were significantly higher than those obtained against BRL 37344, but the cause of this difference is not known. 3. Several structural requirements were determined for antagonist activity. Modification at the carbon atom alpha to the secondary amine caused the antagonist potency to fall as the level of saturation was reduced. Thus, a quaternary carbon group, such as t-butyl, produced the most potent antagonist. Substitution with a large moiety such as a cyclohexyl or benzyl group reduced antagonist activity, probably due to steric hindrance. Inclusion of an electron-withdrawing group, such as a cyano or ethylester moiety, alpha to the indole nitrogen, also increased the potency. Iodination of CYP and ethylesterpindolol at the 3-position of the indole ring did not increase antagonist potency. In contrast, iodination of the almost inactive analogues produced a significant increase in potency, suggesting that a beneficial electronic effect on the indole ring imparted by the iodo moiety may be able to offset partially the negative effects caused by either the steric hindrance, of lack of a quaternary carbon alpha to the secondary amine. 4. Values for pseudo-pD2 were also determined by conducting cumulative concentration-response studies up to the limit of drug solubility. For nine of the compounds tested, the pKb was significantly higher than the pseudo-pD2 value. 5. The discrepancy between the pKb and pseudo-pD2 values was examined further. The agonist effects of iodocyanopindolol, the agonist with the highest potency, were not antagonized by CYP which was the most potent antagonist of (-)-isoprenaline and BRL 37344 at the beta 3-adrenoceptor. This suggests that the agonist effects of iodoCYP were produced through a different mechanism: either via another receptor, another isoform of the rat beta 3-adrenoceptor, or through a non-receptor-mediated effect. Pseudo-pD2 values did not correlate with log P values for these compounds, indicating that their relaxant effects were not simply a function of their lipid solubility. 6. This study has highlighted several structural requirements for antagonist binding potency at the rat ileum beta 3-adrenoceptor and should assist in the development of potent selective antagonists for this receptor.", 
    "93": "1. In rat aortic rings contracted by phenylephrine, the relaxation induced by isoprenaline was partly inhibited by iberiotoxin, (ibTX), tetraethylammonium, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, but not by glibenclamide. 2. In the presence of 4-AP, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin failed to inhibit further the relaxant response to isoprenaline. Cromakalim-induced relaxation was inhibited by glibenclamide. 3. In the absence of endothelium, ibTX and 4-AP still inhibited the relaxant response to isoprenaline. 4. The inhibitory effect of ibTX on the relaxant response to isoprenaline was eliminated by pretreatment with ICI-118,551, a beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not by atenolol, a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist. 5. The inhibitory effect of 4-AP on the relaxation induced by isoprenaline was abolished by atenolol, but not by ICI-118,551. 6. The inhibitory effect of ibTX on the isoprenaline-induced relaxation in the presence of atenolol was completely abolished by MDL 12,330A, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor. Further, the inhibitory effect of 4-AP on the isoprenaline-induced relaxation in the presence of ICI-118,551 was markedly reduced by MDL 12,330A. 7. The relaxation induced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP was partly inhibited by 4-AP but not by ibTX. However, in the presence of KT5720, an inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, ibTX failed to inhibit further the relaxation induced by isoprenaline. 8. These results suggest that, in rat aortic rings, KCa channels are involved in the relaxation induced by isoprenaline. In addition, KCa channels are mainly activated by beta 2-adrenoceptors through cyclic AMP-dependent pathways. Further, the inhibition of isoprenaline-relaxation by 4-AP may be related to the activation of beta 1-adrenoceptors and cyclic AMP formation.", 
    "94": "The stability of drugs commonly prescribed for use in oral liquid dosage forms but not commercially available as such was studied.

A sample was removed from each bottle initially and at intervals up to 60 days and analyzed for drug concentration by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography. At least 91% of the initial drug concentration was retained in all the oral liquids for up to 60 days. There were no substantial changes in the appearance or odor of the liquids, or in the pH.

    "95": "We investigated the effects of isoflurane on the rabbit cardiovascular system at several end-tidal concentrations. Furthermore, because isoflurane has been reported to produce tachycardia while reducing sympathetic nervous activity and baroreflex function, we evaluated whether the chronotropic effects of isoflurane could be due to a vagal withdrawal. ECG, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were obtained in rabbits the conscious, unsedated state and during isoflurane anesthesia by telemetric device. Measurements of pH, oxygen, carbon dioxide, plasma catecholamines, baroreflex sensitivity, and spectral analysis of HR variability were made in nonanesthetized and anesthetized animals. Isoflurane caused an increase in HR at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and MAP at 1 and 1.5 MAC. Biochemical analysis showed that isoflurane-mediated cardiovascular effects were not accompanied by any significant changes in plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) levels. Neither were any significant differences in plasma catecholamine levels noted between anesthetized and awake animals. The analysis of spectral components of HR variability and baroreflex function indicated that isoflurane induced a marked reduction in the low- and high-frequency spectral power of HR variability and in baroreflex sensitivity. Tachycardia under isoflurane was suppressed dose dependently by the administration of clonidine or atenolol and was not influenced by bilateral vagotomy. Collectively, our results indicate that cardiovascular effects induced by isoflurane in smaller animals such as rabbits are similar to those observed in humans and other animal species. We showed that isoflurane-induced tachycardia is mainly the result of vagal withdrawal rather than a baroreflex response, even though a marginal role of baroreflex in heart response to higher concentrations of isoflurane cannot be excluded.", 
    "96": "In microdialysis studies, somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) were activated by the local infusion of 50 microM citalopram, a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This reduced extracellular 5-HT by about 50% in dorsal striatum, an area receiving 5-HT afferents exclusively from the DRN. (-)Pindolol dose-dependently attenuated this citalopram-induced reduction of striatal extracellular 5-HT. Consistent with its 5-HT reuptake blocking properties, single doses of the SSRI paroxetine (1 and 3 mg/kg IP) and citalopram (1 mg/kg IP) significantly elevated extracellular 5-HT in the dorsal striatum. Pretreatment with (-)pindolol (15 mg/kg IP) potentiated the effect of 3 mg/kg paroxetine and 1 mg/kg citalopram on striatal extracellular 5-HT. A 2-day treatment with 10 mg/kg/day (SC) of paroxetine reduced by 60% the spontaneous activity of 5-HT neurons of the DRN. However, 5-HT neurons displayed normal activity in rats treated with paroxetine and (-)pindolol for 2 days. The inhibitory effect of LSD on 5-HT neuronal firing activity was also markedly attenuated in (-)pindolol-treated rats, indicating that somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors were blocked by (-)pindolol. To determine whether (-)pindolol also blocked postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in hippocampus, 5-HT and the prototypical 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT were applied by microiontophoresis onto CA3 pyramidal neurons following the same treatment. (-)Pindolol did not modify the responsiveness of these neurons to 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT. Taken together, these results indicate that (-)pindolol can potentiate the effects of an SSRI on extracellular 5-HT concentration by preventing the activation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors resulting from the blockade of the 5-HT transporter in the raphe. This presumably leads to enhanced 5-HT neurotransmission because (-)pindolol would not alter the responsiveness of certain postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, such as those located on hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. These results provide a neurobiological basis for the reported potentiation of certain antidepressant drugs by pindolol in major depression.", 
    "97": "Continuous administration of verapamil significantly reduced the mortality rate of acute murine Trypanosoma cruzi infection (P < 0.05). The mechanistic basis for these observations was investigated. Verapamil and other calcium-channel blockers did not inhibit the growth of epimastigotes in culture. Furthermore, verapamil did not inhibit the intracellular growth of amastigotes in endothelial cells as determined by the uptake of 3H-uracil. There were no significant differences in parasitemia between infected mice that were untreated and those treated with verapamil. Twenty days postinfection infected, untreated mice had a parasitemia of 5.8 x 10(6) trypomastigotes/ml (SD +/- 2 x 10(6)), whereas infected, verapamil-treated mice had a parasitemia of 2.2 x 10(6) trypomastigotes/ml (SD +/- 0.5 x 10(6)). There was no significant difference in mortality between mice administered verapamil only for the initial 10 days of murine infection compared to those treated continuously. A 3-day delay in the initiation of verapamil administration reduced the mortality rate, but a 10-day delay did not. Propranolol (beta-adrenergic blocker), prazosin (alpha 1-adrenergic blocker), and diltiazem (another calcium-channel blocker) reduced the mortality but not significantly (P = 0.07). In biochemical studies of the beta- adrenergic signal transduction complex, we determined that verapamil and propranolol reversed the infection-associated decrease in myocardial beta- adrenergic adenylyl cyclase activity. In contrast, complementary western blot analysis revealed no significant changes in the G-proteins of the beta- adrenergic receptor complex 45 days postinfection. Therefore, these results suggest that the basis of verapamil's influence on the early critical period of infection is multifactorial and independent of a direct trypanocidal effect.", 
    "98": "The aim of the study was to evaluate a new noninvasive transcranial near-infrared spectroscopy (TNIRS) technique for determination of the lower limit of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation by comparing this technique with the standard cerebral arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference (AVDo2) method. In eight healthy volunteers, mean arterial blood pressure was increased by infusion of angiotensin and decreased by the combination of lower-body negative pressure and labetalol. For each 5-mm Hg change in mean arterial pressure, blood was sampled from the bulb of the internal jugular vein and a radial artery, and simultaneously, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in the brain was measured with an INVOS 3100 Cerebral Oximeter (Somanetics). The lower limit of autoregulation was then calculated by a computer using (a) AVDo2 and (b) the difference between arterial oxygen saturation and the saturation determined with the cerebral oximeter (ACDo2). The median lower limit of autoregulation determined by the two methods was 73 and 78.5 mm Hg, respectively (p > 0.05). A statistically significant correlation between relative CBF (percentage of baseline) determined with the two methods was found below the lower limit of autoregulation (1/AVDo2 = 12 + 0.8 x 1/ACDo2; r = 0.55; p < 0.001). For all the 98 pairs of saturations registered, the correlation was 0.37 (p < 0.001), the mean difference was 16%, and the limits of agreement were -2.2 and 33.8%. We conclude that the cerebral oximeter might be useful in evaluation of the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation. This method, however, is of no value for estimation of levels of global cerebral oxygen saturation.",

    "103": "Human neutrophils, plated in fibronectin-coated wells and stimulated with N-formyl-methionylleucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), were found to undergo a massive and prolonged respiratory burst, as measured by monitoring superoxide production. The beta 2-agonist salmeterol inhibited the respiratory burst in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, salbutamol was ineffective. Moreover, the neutrophil respiratory burst was partially suppressed by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the phosphodiesterase type IV (PDE-IV) inhibitor RO 20-1724. When salmeterol was used in combination with PGE2 or RO 20-1724, additive inhibitory effects were observed. The inhibitory activity of salmeterol was not reversed in the presence of the beta-blocker propranolol, and did not correlate with its ability of increasing cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Finally, the compounds used did not affect neutrophil adherence to fibronectin-coated wells. The results suggest that salmeterol is capable of down-regulating the neutrophil oxidative response to fMLP, also of co-operating with PGE2 and PDE-IV inhibitor RO 20-1724 in a manner not related to its beta 2-receptor binding activity. In other words, salmeterol displays neutrophil-directed effects, susceptible to be amplified by natural mediators such as PGE2 or PDE-IV inhibitors, consistent with possible anti-inflammatory properties of the drug.",

    "111": "The cloned human beta-3 adrenoceptor was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells at three different levels (130, 400 and 3000 fmol/mg). The potency and intrinsic activity of a range of agonists in functional assays with these cell lines rose as a function of increasing receptor density. Operational analysis of concentration-response data allowed calculation of functional affinity and efficacy of agonists at the human beta-3 adrenoceptor. The data highlighted the low efficacy of BRL 37344 \u00bf(RR,SS)-(+/-)-4-[(2-(2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-propyl] phenoxyacetate\u00bf for the human beta-3 adrenoceptor, which may explain its lower potency at the human receptor despite its higher affinity relative to isoprenaline. The potency of catecholamines at the human beta-3 adrenoceptor was found to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher when determined in an intact cell cAMP accumulation assay compared with a membrane-based adenylyl cyclase activation assay. The reason for this enhanced sensitivity is not clear, but the result is that the potency of the natural agonist noradrenaline in the intact cell is considerably higher than predicted either from its ligand binding affinity, or from its potency in membrane-based assays. Much smaller enhancements in sensitivity were observed for compounds of the aryloxypropanolamine class such as CGP 12177 [(+/-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)benzimidazol-2-one], with the result that the rank order of potency of such agonists at the beta-3 adrenoceptor was altered. In particular, CGP 12177 exhibited high relative potency in the cyclase assay, but low relative potency in intact cell assays. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate expression levels and appropriate assay methodology when cloned receptors are used to characterize agonists.", 
    "112": "The cell death of cultured neurons triggered by beta-amyloid peptides has been theorized to model, at least in part, the neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer's disease. To investigate potential strategies to interrupt beta-amyloid neurotoxicity in vitro, we examined the effects of potassium-induced membrane depolarization, a treatment previously demonstrated to reduce development-related apoptosis in cultured neurons. We report here that cultured rat hippocampal neurons pretreated for several hours with 30 mM KCl exhibit significantly reduced vulnerability to aggregated beta-amyloid peptides. The potassium-mediated neuroprotection was mimicked by activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels using S(-)-Bay K8644 and was attenuated by R(+)-Bay K 8644, a blocker of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and KN-82, an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide also attenuated beta-amyloid neurotoxicity. Addition of cycloheximide following 30 mM KCl significantly increased protection offered by membrane depolarization, whereas cycloheximide addition during membrane depolarization blocked the protective effect. These data suggest that one cellular pathway that can inhibit neuronal death induced by beta-amyloid involves calcium influx through voltage-sensitive channels followed by stimulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity and synthesis of new protein(s).",

The need for treatment seems obvious. However, in young and middle-aged women, treatment is not straightforward, and trials have not specifically targeted this group. Data extrapolated from existing studies suggest that treatment of hypertension does not confer the same protection against CAD and stroke in women as it does in men. In fact, a trend toward harm in young and middle-aged white women receiving stepped care for hypertension has been reported. Therefore, for now, treatment of women in this age-group should be conservative; drugs should be prescribed only after a focused trial of lifestyle modification has failed. Until recently, elderly subjects were also excluded from treatment studies, despite the fact that they are at high risk for morbidity and death from hypertension-related diseases. Recent studies have established that treatment of hypertension in the elderly is extremely effective, that elderly women should be treated as aggressively as elderly men, and that low-dose diuretic or beta-blocker therapy should be initiated if lifestyle modifications are not effective.", 
    "115": "Wide complex tachycardias are cardiac rhythm disorders with three or more consecutive beats, rates exceeding 100 beats per minute and a QRS duration of 120 msec (0.12 second) or greater. The width of the QRS complex should be verified in a number of leads, since the QRS complex often appears mistakenly narrower (i.e., a QRS duration of less than 120 msec) in one or two of the 12 leads. Most wide complex tachycardias are ventricular tachycardia, and they are managed with antiarrhythmic drugs and correction of serum potassium and magnesium levels. Electrical cardioversion/defibrillation may be used in patients with serious cardiac compromise. Supraventricular tachycardias occur with or without ventricular conduction abnormalities. The management of supraventricular tachycardia requires careful evaluation for aberrant ventricular conduction or preexcitation. The cause of a wide complex tachycardia must be identified, because certain therapies can result in potentially fatal arrhythmias. If the cause cannot be determined, a test dose of intravenous adenosine can be used. Another approach is intravenous administration of procainamide and a beta-adrenergic blocker.",

However the specific effects on LV diastolic function have been subjected to only limited examination. This study investigated the effects of the combined beta blocker/vasodilator, carvedilol, on systolic and diastolic LV performance in dilated cardiomyopathy. Thirty-six patients with New York Heart Association II to III heart failure and LV ejection fraction < or = 0.35 were entered into either arm of this placebo-controlled, double-blind 4-month trial. Twenty-one subjects were entered into the carvedilol treatment arm and 15 patients were entered into the placebo arm in a 3:2 ratio. Carvedilol therapy resulted in a significant improvement in LV ejection fraction, from 0.22 +/- 0.02 to 0.30 +/- 0.02 when compared with the placebo group (0.19 +/- 0.02 to 0.21 +/- 0.02 at baseline and after 4 months of therapy, respectively; p = 0.0001). However, no significant change in radionuclide parameters of LV diastolic function, including peak filling rate or time to peak filling rate, was observed. LV end-diastolic volume index did not change with carvedilol therapy, whereas end-diastolic volume index increased in the placebo group, although the difference between groups at 4 months was significant (p = 0.02). In conjunction with these changes, end-systolic volume index was smaller at 4 months after carvedilol treatment compared with that of the placebo group (p = 0.04). Thus, these results demonstrate that in moderate chronic heart failure, systolic LV performance improves but diastolic LV function does not improve when compared with placebo after treatment with carvedilol.",

We measured cardiac mRNAs by Northern blot analysis. In 9-week-old SHR at the very early stage of cardiac hypertrophy, the expression of various cardiac genes related to the regulation of cardiac contraction and relaxation was already significantly changed compared with control Wistar-Kyoto rats, indicating that cardiac molecular changes are responsible for cardiac remodeling or the modulation of cardiac performance in SHR. We gave various types of antihypertensive drugs, at oral doses causing a mild and comparable hypotensive effect, to 27-week-old SHR to examine the effects on the altered cardiac gene expression. Imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, normalized the increased gene expression of atrial natriuretic polypeptide and collagen types I and III and the decreased expression of alpha-myosin heavy chain in SHR heart. Atenolol (a beta 1-blocker) combined with doxazosin did not affect cardiac ANP and alpha-myosin heavy chain expression of SHR but normalized the increased collagen expression. In contrast, despite a hypotensive effect comparable to these two drug treatments, doxazosin (an alpha 1-blocker) alone or manidipine (a calcium antagonist) did not normalize these altered gene expressions of SHR. These results show that the cardiac renin-angiotensin system is involved in the altered cardiac gene expression in SHR. The beta 1- but not alpha 1-adrenergic receptor is also responsible for the increased cardiac collagen expression in SHR.",

In a double-blind randomized parallel-group study, they were treated with atenolol 50 mg once per day (n = 25) or urapidil 60 mg twice per day (n = 17), a peripheral alpha1-receptor blocker with an additional central serotonin 1A (5HT1A) receptor agonistic effect, for 12 weeks. Plasma fibrinogen concentration decreased by 24% (P < .0001) during urapidil treatment and by 9% (P = .05) during atenolol treatment, with the effects of the two drugs differing significantly. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity tended to increase by 17% (nonsignificant [NS]) in the atenolol-treated group and to decrease by 4% (NS) in the urapidil group. Differences between the effects of the two drugs on very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides (TG) and on total TG were significant. During urapidil medication, these two parameters were reduced by 22% and 13%, respectively, but the changes were nonsignificant (P = .11 and P = .14, respectively). In contrast, atenolol treatment caused a significant increase in both VLDL TG and total TG of 31% and 21%, respectively. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) increased by 4% (P = .06) during atenolol treatment, but was unaffected by urapidil. There were no significant changes within or between atenolol- and urapidil-treated groups regarding glucose disposal on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or the insulin sensitivity index on a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test. In conclusion, urapidil treatment was characterized by neutral or favorable effects on several variables associated with the metabolic syndrome. Atenolol treatment had neutral properties in some metabolic aspects, but deleterious effects on lipid status.",

After logistic regression analysis controlling for nulliparity, birth weight, and epidural anesthetic use, the significant reduction in the cesarean rate associated with use of propranolol persisted. Propranolol administration was associated with a markedly reduced cesarean rate among patients with inadequate uterine contractility.", 
    "123": "Low-dose administration of IV propranolol in patients with dysfunctional labor augmented with oxytocin safely reduced the need for cesarean delivery, particularly among patients with inadequate uterine contractility.", 
    "124": "Heart rate variability is an important prognostic indicator for sudden death. An increased risk of sudden death and arrhythmia is associated with reduced heart rate variability in heart failure. In heart failure, there is also dilatation of the atria, which raises the prospect that there could be some physiological basis to possibly link heart rate variability with atrial dilatation. We therefore investigated whether sustained atrial stretch could modulate heart rate variability directly.", 
    "125": "Pigs were anesthetized and their hearts exposed. A specially built device stretched the sinoatrial node before and after vagal section and then after administration of propranolol. Stretch of the sinoatrial node decreases heart rate variability in the following ways: The standard deviation of the beat-to-beat interval decreases (4.2 to 2.6 ms; P = .004), and the high-frequency components are reduced (control, 6.5 +/- 2.2 ms2, during stretch, 1.4 +/- 0.3 ms2, P = .003). After section of both vagi, the high-frequency components are reduced by stretch of the sinoatrial node (2.8 +/- 0.9 ms2 for control versus 1.2 +/- 0.3 ms2 during stretch; P = .05). Similarly, after both vagal section and beta-blockade, stretch of the sinoatrial node reduces the high-frequency components (10.6 +/- 3.5 ms2 for control verses 3.0 +/- 1.5 ms2 during stretch; P = .01).", 
    "126": "We conclude that stretch of the sinoatrial node reduces high-frequency heart rate variability. This may account in part for the reduced heart rate variability seen in clinical conditions in which the right atrium is dilated, such as congestive cardiac failure.", 
    "127": "Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is thought to be a critical step in ischemic preconditioning. Many receptor agonists activate PKC via stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC), which degrades membrane phospholipids to diacylglycerol (DAG), an important PKC cofactor. However, adenosine receptors, critical components of the prototypical preconditioning pathway, are not thought to couple to PLC in the cardiomyocyte. We therefore tested whether ischemic preconditioning or adenosine might instead activate phospholipase D (PLD) to produce DAG.", 
    "128": "PLD activity was measured in isolated rabbit hearts. Ischemic injury was evaluated in either isolated rabbit hearts or dispersed myocytes. PLD activity doubled from a control level of 74.8 +/- 10.0 to 140.0 +/- 11.5 mumol.min-1.g-1 (P < .025) after two 5-minute periods of global ischemia separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion. A similar increase was noted after the heart had been exposed to (R)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine [(R)-PIA] for 20 minutes. When sodium oleate, which activates PLD, was administered to isolated hearts before a 30-minute coronary occlusion, infarct size (15.6 +/- 2.0% of the risk zone) was significantly smaller than in untreated hearts (30.4 +/- 2.2%; P < .01). Exposure to sodium oleate significantly prolonged the rate of isolated myocyte survival during simulated ischemia. Propranolol 100 mumol/L, which blocks DAG production from metabolites produced by PLD catalysis, completely abolished the protective effects of both metabolic preconditioning and (R)-PIA exposure in myocytes.", 
    "129": "We conclude that PLD stimulation is involved in the protection of ischemic preconditioning in the rabbit heart.", 
    "130": "Respiratory alkalosis (RA) is seen in diverse clinical conditions including tissue hypoxia, malignancy, neurologic disorders, febrile states, pregnancy, and hepatic failure. Acute RA causes hypophosphaturia in rats, and this effect on renal phosphate handling is reversed by beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of acute RA on phosphate excretion in human patients in the absence and presence of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism with propranolol. Twelve normal volunteers, 6 women and 6 men, were studied in two phases, once with placebo and once with intravenous infusion of propranolol. In both groups, 30-minute renal clearances were taken during normoventilation (NV) and during acute RA induced by voluntary hyperventilation. Acute RA produced a significant decrease in plasma phosphate (PPi) in the absence (deltaPPi = -0.16 +/- 0.03 mmol/L) and the presence (deltaPPi = -0.16 +/- 0.05 mmol/L) of propranolol. In the placebo group, fractional excretion of phosphate (FEPi) decreased from 24.1% +/- 3.4% in NV to 19.2% +/- 2.6% in RA. This was associated with a significant decrease in parathyroid hormone (PPTH), from 3.38 +/- 0.28 pmol/L in NV to 2.54 +/- 0.30 pmol/L in RA. In the propranolol group, FEPi did not change significantly, from 19.1% +/- 2.7% in NV to 18.7% +/- 3.0% in RA. This also occurred in the face of a decrease in PPTH, from 4.39 +/- 0.53 pmol/L in NV to 2.78 +/- 0.33 pmol/L in RA. Thus propranolol selectively changes the response of FEPi to acute RA while leaving the PPi and PPTH responses unaltered. This suggests that beta-adrenoreceptors play a role in the regulation of the response of renal phosphate handling during acute RA and that this role involves a direct tubular effect on phosphate reabsorption, independent of filtered load and hormonal status. We conclude that beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism blunts the hypophosphaturic effect of acute respiratory alkalosis in human subjects.", 
    "131": "Capillarization of the sinusoids in cirrhosis is proposed to reduce oxygen availability to the hepatocyte, resulting in the patterns of altered drug metabolism observed in cirrhosis. If this were true, drug metabolism in cirrhotic livers would be expected to be more sensitive to reduced oxygen delivery than in noncirrhotic livers. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity of propranolol clearance with reduced oxygen delivery in isolated perfused livers from healthy and cirrhotic rats.", 
    "132": "Propranolol clearance was measured at steady state in 5 normal and 5 cirrhotic weight-matched perfused rat livers under single-pass conditions with normal oxygen delivery (mean, 71.5 mumol/min) and with graded reductions in oxygen delivery (range, 58.1-18.8 mumol/min).", 
    "133": "In noncirrhotic livers, propranolol clearance was independent of oxygen supply for the oxygen delivery range of 73-45 mumol/min but decreased with further reductions in oxygen supply. In cirrhotic livers, propranolol clearance decreased linearly (r2 = 0.92; P < 0.005) for the entire oxygen delivery range (73.4-18.8 mumol/min).", 
    "134": "The increased sensitivity of propranolol clearance in perfused cirrhotic livers to reductions in oxygen delivery is consistent with impaired oxygen delivery to hepatocytes in cirrhosis. These novel findings potentially hold implications for clinical management of patients with cirrhosis.", 
    "135": "Adenosine, verapamil, propranolol, and procainamide are widely used antiarrhythmic drugs. The interactions among them are still not known in human beings. Adenosine-induced negative dromotropic effects were assessed by rapid bolus injection of adenosine during constant high right atrial pacing in each patient. The initial dose of adenosine was 0.5 mg and was followed by a stepwise increment of 0.5 mg until atrioventricular (AV) nodal block occurred. The negative dromotropic actions of adenosine were examined in the control state and in the following three protocols in three groups of patients: (1) In 12 patients (group 1), intravenous verapamil, 0.15 mg/kg, was given; (2) In 12 patients (group 2), intravenous propranolol, 0.1 mg/kg, was given; and (3) in 10 patients (group 3), intravenous procainamide, 15 mg/kg, was given. The dose-response curves of adenosine on AV nodal conduction were almost identical in the control state and after verapamil, propranolol, or procainamide injection. However, verapamil, in contrast to propranolol, significantly reduced the dose of adenosine required to produce AV nodal block, from 4.4 +/- 0.7 mg to 2.7 +/- 0.3 mg (p < 0.01). Of note, procainamide exerted no significant effects on adenosine-induced negative dromotropism on AV nodal conduction or AV nodal block. In conclusion, the negative dromotropic effects of adenosine are preserved and independent even in the presence of verapamil, propranolol, or procainamide. Both verapamil and propranolol can exhibit additive effects with adenosine in prolonging AV nodal conduction time; however, only verapamil can reduce the dose of adenosine required to produce AV nodal block. This finding indicates that the dose of adenosine may be reduced for patients who have already been treated with verapamil.", 
    "136": "The old paradigm states that the greater the stenosis, the greater the risk of cardiac events. Revascularization procedures are the only effective approach to improving prognosis associated with coronary artery disease. In contrast, on the basis of the new paradigm, the nature of the plaque determines the risk of acute cardiovascular events. Dangerous plaques have a lipid-rich core with surrounding inflammation and a thin friable overlying fibrous cap, but they usually appear innocuous on angiography. Effective risk factor modification stabilizes the dangerous plaques and is associated with prompt improvement in endothelial dysfunction and a substantial decrease in the risk of acute cardiovascular events and death."
