The transition of the prion protein (PrP) from a mainly alpha-structured isoform (PrPC) to a prevalent beta-sheet-containing protein (PrPSc) is believed to represent a major pathogenetic mechanism in prion diseases. To investigate the linkage between PrP neurotoxicity and its conformation, we used a recombinant prion protein fragment corresponding to the amino acidic sequence 90-231 of human prion protein (hPrP90-231). Using thermal denaturation, we set up an experimental model to induce the process of conversion from PrPC to PrPSc. We report that partial thermal denaturation converts hPrP90-231 into a beta-sheet-rich isoform, displaying a temperature- and time-dependent conversion into oligomeric structures that share some physico-chemical characteristics with brain PrPSc. SH-SY5Y cells were chosen to characterize the potential neurotoxic effect of hPrP90-231 in its different structural conformations. We demonstrated that hPrP90-231 in beta-conformation, but not when alpha-structured, powerfully affected the survival of these cells. hPrP90-231 beta-structured caused DNA fragmentation and a significant increase in caspase-3 proteolytic activity (maximal effects+170%), suggesting the occurrence of apoptotic cell death. Finally, we investigated the involvement of MAP kinases in the regulation of beta-hPrP90-231-dependent apoptosis. We observed that the p38 MAP kinase blocker SB203580 prevented the apoptotic cell death evoked by hPrP90-231, and Western blot analysis revealed that the exposure of the cells to the peptide induced p38 phosphorylation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the hPrP90-231 elicits proapoptotic activity when in beta-sheet-rich conformation and that this effect is mediated by p38 and caspase-3 activation.", 
    "1": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and tissue factor (TF) produced by monocytes and macrophages have been shown to be among the aggravating factors for chronic heart failure (CHF), because they induce cardiac dysfunction and thrombotic complications, respectively. Carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with alpha(1)- adrenoceptor blockade action, has been demonstrated to improve the outcome of patients with severe CHF, suggesting that carvedilol might inhibit the production of TNF and TF. In this study, this possibility is examined using isolated human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. Carvedilol (10 muM) significantly inhibited LPS-induced production of TNF and TF by monocytes, whereas prazosin (a selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist), bisoprolol (a selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist), ICI-118,551 (a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist), and arotinolol (a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blockade action) did not. Carvedilol inhibited both expression of early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, but it did not inhibit activation of either nuclear factor-kappaB or activator protein-1 in monocytes stimulated with LPS. These results suggest that carvedilol inhibits LPS-induced production of TNF and TF by inhibiting activation of the ERK1/2-Egr-1 pathway independent of its adrenoceptor inhibitory activities in monocytes.",

    "4": "Age, obesity, and presence of symptoms accompanying AF were inversely associated with baseline exercise capacity, but these factors accounted for only 10% of the variance in exercise capacity. Patients most likely to benefit from cardioversion were those most limited initially, younger, not obese or hypertensive, and with an uncontrolled ventricular rate at baseline. Conversion to sinus rhythm (SR) resulted in significant reductions in resting (approximately 25 beat/min) and peak exercise (approximately 40 beat/min) heart rates at 6 months and 1 year (P < .001). Successful cardioversion improved exercise capacity by 15% at 8 weeks, and these improvements were maintained throughout the year.

In particular, the importance of the level and type of plasticizers was investigated. The permeability of the model drug metoprolol tartrate through plasticized isolated films could be adjusted by selecting the type and amount of plasticizer in the films due to the different hydrophilicity of the plasticizers. The release of metoprolol tartrate from coated pellets is consistent with the drug diffusion through the films made up of the same polymer blends. This indicated that it is useful to test isolated films for early predictions and for formulation optimization.",

    "19": "On the premise that human medicines may potentially induce similar pharmacological and toxicological profiles in fish and other lower vertebrates, we have applied this comparative approach to beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists ('beta-blockers') which are widely detected in surface waters. While reported concentrations of beta-blockers are typically in the low ng/L range, data are needed to define whether this contamination poses any long-term threat to fish or other aquatic organisms. We argue that gathering experimental data in fish for these compounds may be done more efficiently by considering mammalian toxicology data. Extensive mammalian pharmacological and toxicological studies are central to development of medicines and these can provide valuable information to guide ecotoxicological studies. For beta-blockers, we can increasingly exploit the knowledge from molecular approaches to understand phenotypes and functions of adrenergic receptors in mammals versus fish. Some beta-adrenergic receptors have been characterised in fish using both traditional molecular cloning methods, or via mining of genomic sequences from various organisms. These approaches demonstrate that fish have beta-adrenergic receptors very similar to those present in mammals. Since we believe that any effects of beta-blockers in fish are most likely to be mediated via beta-adrenergic receptors, it is the physiological processes regulated by these receptors that are most likely to be affected. Thus, cardiovascular dysfunction is one possible consequence of exposure of fish to these compounds, leading to impaired fitness (e.g. reduced growth and fecundity). More broadly, conceptual mathematical models suggest it might be possible to predict plasma concentrations of beta-blockers in fish from mammals, although these models cannot be regarded as reliable until thoroughly validated. Experimental data are therefore urgently needed to define plasma levels and metabolism of beta-blockers compared in fish with mammals. Finally, accurate citation of CAS numbers is essential for pharmaceuticals in order to compare nominal concentration data in terms of either the drug free base or the drug salt complex.",

A luciferin-luciferase assay was used to quantify the change of stretch-evoked adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release by amiloride.

Thus, the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) and the American College of Cardiology-American Heart Association (ACC-AHA) guidelines were updated in 2006 and 2005, respectively. We review the evidence from these trials and summarize the changes to the HFSA and ACC-AHA guidelines. Based on data from these studies, the new guidelines include broader, stronger recommendations for beta-blocker therapy, and strong recommendations for angiotensin II receptor blockers. The aldosterone antagonists, spironolactone and eplerenone, are also included in the guidelines.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use confers a 16-20% reduction in mortality. beta-Blocker use also confers a significant reduction in mortality, as well as reduces hospitalizations. Angiotensin II receptor blockers also reduce mortality and morbidity. Appropriate use of drugs can reduce other costs associated with heart failure. During the past 20 years, many trials in patients with heart failure have been conducted. Those that have demonstrated reductions in morbidity and mortality were reviewed in order to identify the important implications for sound clinical care of patients with heart failure.

They will also know which agents are preferred based on well-conducted clinical trials, as well as the target doses at which these agents should be used.", 
    "37": "A significant proportion of the mortality and morbidity of severe burns is attributable to the ensuing hypermetabolic response that typically lasts for at least 9-12 months post-injury. This is associated with impaired wound healing, increased infection risks, erosion of lean body mass, hampered rehabilitation and delayed reintegration of burn survivors into society. The endocrine status is markedly altered during this period with an initial and then sustained increase in proinflammatory 'stress' hormones such as cortisol and other glucocorticoids, and catecholamines including epinephrine and norepinephrine by the adrenal medulla and cortex. These hormones exert catabolic effects leading to muscle wasting, the intensity of which depends upon the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) involved, as well as the time elapsed since initial injury. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies may be used to reverse the catabolic effect of thermal injury. Of these, beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol has been the most efficacious anti-catabolic therapy in the treatment of burns. The underlying mechanism of action of propranolol is still unclear, however its effect appears to occur due to an increased protein synthesis in the face of a persistent protein breakdown and reduced peripheral lipolysis. This article aims to review the current understanding of catecholamines in postburn muscle wasting and focuses on the clinical and metabolic effects of beta-blockade in severe burns.",

    "44": "Beta-blockers have been used to treat ischemic heart disease, due to negative chronotropic and inotropic properties, thus inducing a decrease in myocardial consumption of oxygen and nutrients, allowing a better balance between nutritional needs and the supply provided by the coronary blood flow. Recent developments in cell biology allowed us to understand that not all beta-blockers are equal, as their intracellular mechanisms of action can be very different. This paper will focus on carvedilol, a non-selective beta-blocker with alfa-blocker properties, currently used to treat hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease. Effects of carvedilol on cardiac mitochondria, their relation to its antioxidant properties, and how these can improve cardiomyocyte resistance to aggression and cardiac function will be discussed. We will begin by depicting the effect of carvedilol on mitochondrial parameters, namely oxidative phosphorylation, calcium homeostasis and energy production. Then we will focus on the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and how the antioxidant properties of carvedilol can be used to minimize oxidative stress, a powerful inducer of MPT. Carvedilol will also be highlighted as an enzyme modulator, focusing on its importance to prevent doxorubicin (DOX) cardiotoxicity. The mitochondrial-related mechanism of cardioprotection involving carvedilol will also be addressed, as we will discuss some clinical pieces of evidence showing the importance of mechanisms previously depicted. In conclusion, based upon its molecular mechanisms of action, carvedilol seems to be a unique beta-blocker. These unique characteristics can help us understand the positive impact of carvedilol on the prognosis of patients with heart disease.",

Research on TGFbeta signalling and the potential treatment role of TGFbeta antagonists may lead to exciting new treatments, but the results of clinical trials are awaited. In managing the cardiovascular complications of Marfan's syndrome, the paediatrician has to walk a difficult path.

For similar heart rate reduction, ivabradine attenuated stunning, whereas atenolol further depressed systolic wall thickening. PSWT to total wall thickening ratio was significantly decreased by ivabradine vs. saline, whereas total wall thickening was similar. Thus, ivabradine devoted a greater part of thickening to systole by converting PSWT into ejectional thickening. In contrast, atenolol failed to reduce PSWT vs. saline.

In the cannulation(-) group a maximum ten- to fifteen-fold increase in serum AGP concentration was observed at 48 h post surgery, followed by a gradual return back to baseline within 1 week. In the cannulation(+) group a similar concentration-time profile for AGP was found, but without a complete return to baseline within 1 week and with a much higher variability. Ex vivo, an increase in AGP serum concentration from 55 to 675 microg/ml resulted in a profound decrease in the free fraction of S(-)-propranolol from 14+/-0.6 to 1.9+/-0.3%.",

    "53": "In a previous study, we found that stimulation with scent of grapefruit oil (SGFO) elevated plasma glycerol levels in rats. However, stimulation with scent of lavender oil (SLVO) triggered a negative effect. To identify the mechanism of these changes during lipolysis, we examined the role of autonomic blockers and bilateral lesions of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the modification of plasma glycerol in rats exposed to SGFO and SLVO. We found that intraperitoneal injection of propranolol hydrochloride and atropine sulfate eliminated the changes in plasma glycerol levels induced by SGFO and SLVO, respectively. Bilateral lesions of the SCN completely abolished the effects of SGFO and SLVO on lipolysis. In addition, we investigated tyrosine phosphorylation of the transmembrane glycoprotein BIT (a brain immunoglobulin-like molecule with tyrosine-based activation motifs, a member of the signal-regulator protein family), which was found to be involved in the activation of renal sympathetic nerves and increase in body temperature on cold exposure. SGFO was found to enhance the immunoreactivity of BIT to the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in the SCN, whereas SLVO decreased the immunoreactivity. The changes in BIT phosphorylation resulting from the exposure to SGFO and SLVO were eliminated by the corresponding histamine receptor antagonists, which eliminated the changes in plasma glycerol concentration. The results suggest that SGFO and SLVO affect the autonomic neurotransmission and lipolysis. The SCN and histamine neurons are involved in the lipolytic responses to SGFO and SLVO, and tyrosine phosphorylation of BIT is implicated in the relevant signaling pathways.", 
    "54": "Levosimendan is a new calcium sensitizer with inotropic and vasodilatory actions mediated by the sensitization of contractile proteins to calcium, opening of potassium channels and inhibition of phosphodiesterase-3. Its alternative mechanisms of action to those of other traditional inotropes provide a new approach in the management of decompensated heart failure. In contrast to dobutamine, levosimendan does not increase myocardial oxygen demand and, therefore, it is thought to have a lower potential to induce increases in myocardial ischemia and cardiac arrhythmias. The commonly used inotropic agent dobutamine increases myocardial contractility at the expense of increased myocardial oxygen consumption and, therefore, it can result in poor outcomes. Although dobutamine may also have favorable hemodynamic and symptomatic effects, levosimendan has been shown to be superior to dobutamine in increasing cardiac output and decreasing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with decompensated heart failure. In the presence of concomitant beta-blocker therapy, these favorable effects were present or even more pronounced during treatment with levosimendan, but not dobutamine. However, the mortality benefit of levosimendan observed in earlier trials has not been confirmed in recent, larger clinical trials. A distinct advantage of levosimendan over dobutamine is its prolonged hemodynamic effects, which last for up to 7-9 days. There are more data on the safety of levosimendan in ischemic patients than with any other inotropic drug and, therefore, levosimendan seems to be safe and effective in patients with ischemic heart disease when used at the recommended doses. Despite advances in heart failure therapy, many patients experience clinical deterioration, or do not respond to a single inotropic drug. Increasing evidence suggests the use of levosimendan in combination with dobutamine in patients with decompensated heart failure that is refractory to dobutamine alone.",

One hundred and twenty patients with tremor and generalized anxiety disorder were investigated. Tremor was scored clinically by the Webster Tremor Scale. Electromyographic examination of tremor activity from antagonistic hand muscles was performed. Sixty patients were treated with alprazolam and propranolol, in an open, crossover design, while the other sixty patients received no particular treatment for the tremor The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with propranolol, alprazolam, or received no tremor treatment. Our results revealed a postural and kinetic tremor with characteristics of an enhanced physiological tremor. Tremor involved only upper limbs and no other body parts. Treatment with propranolol or alprazolam had similar favorable effect on tremor. In conclusion tremor in generalized anxiety disorder is an enhanced physiological tremor The kinetic tremor disturbs patients and particular tremor treatment with propranolol or alprazolam should be applied.", 
    "56": "The African American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) found that African American patients with advanced heart failure fared better if the fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine was added to their regimen, which for most of them already included an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB), a beta-blocker, and a diuretic (N Engl J Med 2004; 351:2049-2057). This placebo-controlled trial was the first to evaluate a therapy in a specific racial group, and it points the way to a more individualized approach to heart failure therapy.", 
    "57": "Approximately 20 to 40 percent of patients at high risk of cardiac-related morbidity develop myocardial ischemia perioperatively. The preferred approach to diagnostic evaluation depends on the interactions of patient-specific risk factors, surgery-specific risk factors, and exercise capacity. Stress testing should be reserved for patients at moderate to high risk undergoing moderate- or high-risk surgery and those who have poor exercise capacity. Further cardiovascular studies should be limited to patients who are at high risk, have poor exercise tolerance, or have known poor ventricular function. Medical therapy using beta blockers, statins, and alpha agonists may be effective in high-risk patients. The evidence appears to be the strongest for beta blockers, especially in high-risk patients with proven ischemia on stress testing who are undergoing vascular surgery. Many questions remain unanswered, including the optimal role of statins and alpha agonists, whether or not these therapies are as effective in patients with subclinical coronary artery disease or left ventricular dysfunction, and the optimal timing and dosing regimens of these medications.", 
    "58": "The genetic polymorphism of beta-2 adrenergic receptors (B2AR) could play a major role in the prognostic of patients with a coronary heart disease. Two recent epidemiological studies could support this hypothesis. In 597 patients treated by a beta-blocker and followed for 3 years after a myocardial infarction or an acute coronary syndrome, the death rate was 5.4 times higher in homozygous Arg 16 and Gln 27 B2AR genotypes than in heterozygous or homozygous Gly 16 and Glu 27 B2AR genotypes. The beta-1 adrenergic receptor (B1AR) genetic polymorphism did not modify mortality. In a second study, in a prospective cohort of 5249 patients aged > or =65 years, the incidence of sudden cardiac death was 1.56 times higher in patients with homozygous Gln 27 B2AR than in heterozygous or homozygous Glu 27 B2AR genotype. This result was confirmed by a case-control study (155 cases of sudden cardiac death versus 144 control subjects). These data suggest that B2AR genetic polymorphism should be systematically studied in clinical trials in myocardial ischemia, with or without congestive heart failure.", 
    "59": "Nimesulide, a non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug, produces ulcerogenic effects in adrenalectomized rats but is gastro-protective in intact rats. The objective of this study was to determine whether adrenal gland hormones are involved in the anti-ulcer effects of nimesulide. The results revealed that 100 mg/kg nimesulide produces gastric ulceration in adrenalectomized rats, which is prevented by prednisolone and adrenaline. The anti-ulcer effects of adrenaline and prednisolone in adrenalectomized rats were in turn antagonized by yohimbine, a selective alpha(2)-receptor blocker, but not by doxazosine (alpha(1)-receptor blocker) or propranolol (beta-blocker). Adrenaline prevented the formation of indomethacin-induced ulcers in both adrenalectomized and intact rats, but prednisolone increased the indomethacin-induced ulcerous area in intact rats, whereas it decreased the size of the ulcers in adrenalectomized rats. In addition, prednisolone prevented ulcer formation in intact rats in which the adrenaline concentration had been decreased by metyrosine. These results suggest that glucocorticoids are anti-ulcerogenic in not only adrenalectomized rats but also in intact rats with diminished circulating levels of adrenaline. In the light of these data, the effect of nimesulide on plasma adrenaline concentrations was studied. In comparison to the adrenaline levels found in intact control rats, the administration of nimesulide at doses of 10, 20, 40 and 100 mg/kg decreased adrenaline concentrations by 12.8, 22.6, 30.4, and 58.2%, respectively, without affecting blood corticosterone concentrations. The anti-ulcer effect of nimesulide was observed to be dose-dependent, and the strength of this effect was directly correlated the decreasing concentration of adrenaline. The concentration of adrenaline was decreased by 60.9% in rats treated with 300 mg/kg metyrosine in which prednisolone produced anti-ulcer effects. In summary, we have shown that nimesulide produces its anti-ulcer effect by decreasing endogenous adrenaline concentrations and that glucocorticoids may induce anti-ulcer effects via alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors, but not via their own receptors.", 
    "60": "To assess the relationship between cardiac autonomic dysfunction and inflammation in patients with type 1 diabetes and whether beta-blocker therapy might improve both abnormalities in these patients.", 
    "61": "We studied 49 patients with type 1 diabetes (age 50.5 +/- 11 years, 33 men). Serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, as a marker of inflammation, and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) on 24 h Holter monitoring, as a measure of cardiac autonomic function, were assessed in all patients. Twenty-one patients with depressed HRV were subsequently randomized to receive atenolol (50 mg daily) or no-beta-blockade. HRV and C-reactive protein were re-assessed after 3-4 weeks from randomization. An inverse correlation was found between C-reactive protein levels and HRV parameters, with the highest r coefficient shown with low-frequency (LF) power (r = -0.38; P = 0.007). Furthermore, C-reactive protein serum levels were significantly higher in patients with bottom quartile values of LF power compared with patients with values in the three top quartiles (4.64 +/- 2.8 vs.1.79 +/- 1.6 mg/L, respectively; P = 0.003), also after adjustment for potential confounding variables (P = 0.013). HRV parameters improved significantly in patients treated with atenolol, but not in the no-atenolol group. Furthermore, C-reactive protein levels decreased in the beta-blockade group, but not in the no-beta-blockade group (P = 0.04 for changes between groups).", 
    "62": "In type 1 diabetic patients, serum C-reactive protein levels are significantly associated with depressed HRV; the favourable effects of beta-blockade on both HRV parameters and C-reactive protein serum levels suggest that autonomic nervous system may have significant modulator effects on inflammation.", 
    "63": "Plasma adiponectin levels are well associated with metabolic syndrome. However, the relationship between hypertension and plasma adiponectin levels is not clear. Also, there is not enough data about the effects of different antihypertensive regimens on plasma adiponectin levels.", 
    "64": "Ninety-six hypertensive patients (48 male, 48 female) who fulfil the diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome were enrolled. Patients were treated for 3 months with metoprolol (n = 18, 100 mg/day), amlodipine (n = 20, 10 mg/day), doxazosin (n = 18, 4 mg/day), ramipril (n = 20, 5 mg/day) and valsartan (n = 20, 80 mg/day). Blood biochemistry and plasma adiponectin concentrations were measured both before and after the study. Insulin resistance was measured by homeostasis assessment index (HOMA).", 
    "65": "Plasma adiponectin levels were correlated with the total cholesterol (r = -0.244, P = 0.017), triglyceride (r = -0.306, P = 0.002), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r = 0.286, P = 0.005), body mass index (r = -374, P < 0.001), systolic (r = -502, P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressures (r = -235, P = 0.021). The independent predictors of plasma adiponectin levels were HOMA (beta = -0.199, P = 0.02), body mass index (beta = -0.313, P < 0.001) and systolic blood pressures (beta = -0.483, P < 0.001). Ramipril and valsartan increased the plasma adiponectin levels significantly higher than the other regimens (P < 0.05 for both) while metoprolol did not make a significant effect.", 
    "66": "According to the results, plasma adiponectin levels are associated with the arterial blood pressures, body fat content and the lipid parameters in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. The effects of antihypertensive drugs on plasma adiponectin levels are parallel to their effects on blood pressures and insulin sensitivities. The different effects of several regimens on plasma adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivities may account for the diversity of the cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension.", 
    "67": "Whether beta-blockers (BB) or banding is the best therapy for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is subject to debate. A randomized comparison between the 2 treatments was performed in candidates for liver transplantation (LT). A total of 62 patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh B-C cirrhosis and high risk varices received propranolol (31) or variceal banding (31). The primary endpoint was variceal bleeding. There were 2 variceal hemorrhages (6.5%) in the banding group, related to postbanding ulcers, and 3 (9.7%) in the propranolol group (P = not significant [n.s.]). Deaths and bleeding related deaths were 3 and 1 for banding and 3 and 2 for BB, respectively (P = n.s.). A total of 14 patients underwent LT in the banding group and 10 in the propranolol group (P = n.s.). Adverse events were 2 postbanding ulcer bleedings in ligated patients (1 fatal) and 5 were intolerant to propranolol (P = n.s.). Mean costs per patient were higher with banding than with propranolol treatment (4,289 +/- 285 vs. 1,425 +/- 460 U.S. dollars, P < 0.001). In conclusion, propranolol and banding are similarly effective in reducing the incidence of variceal bleeding in candidates for LT, but ligation can be complicated by fatal bleeding and is more expensive. Our results suggest that banding should not be utilized as primary prophylaxis in transplant candidates who can be treated with BB.", 
    "68": "Changes in heart rate and stroke volume after successive blockade of cardiac adreno- and cholinoceptors were examined on rats of different age. It was established that irrespective of animal age the heart rate remained unchanged under conditions of total adreno- and cholinergic blockade of the heart. Stroke volume under conditions of total adreno- and cholinergic blockade increased with age.", 
    "69": "Stimulation of cardiac beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR) or delta-opioid receptor (DOR) exerts a similar degree of cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia in experimental models. We hypothesized that delta-opioid-initiated cardioprotection is mediated by the intrinsic cardiac adrenergic (ICA) cell via enhanced epinephrine release. Using immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization methods, we detected in situ tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA and TH immunoreactivity that was colocalized with DOR immunoreactivity in ICA cells in human and rat hearts. Western blot analysis detected DOR protein in ICA cells isolated from rat ventricular myocytes. The physiology of DOR expression was examined by determining changes of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) transients in isolated rat ICA cells using fluorescence spectrophotometry. Exposing the selective delta-opioid agonist D-[Pen(2,5)]enkephalin (DPDPE) to ICA cells increased [Ca(2+)](i) transients in a concentration-dependent manner. Such an effect was abolished by the Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine. HPLC-electrochemical detection demonstrated a 2.4-fold increase in epinephrine release from ICA cells following DPDPE application. The significance of the ICA cell and its epinephrine release in delta-opioid-initiated cardioprotection was demonstrated in the rat myocardial infarction model and ICA cell-ventricular myocyte coculture. DPDPE administered before coronary artery occlusion or simulated ischemia-reperfusion reduced left ventricular infarct size by 54 +/- 15% or myocyte death by 26 +/- 4%, respectively. beta(2)-AR blockade markedly attenuated delta-opioid-initiated infarct size-limiting effect and abolished delta-opioid-initiated myocyte survival protection in rat ICA cell-myocyte coculture. Furthermore, delta-opioid agonist exerted no myocyte survival protection in the absence of cocultured ICA cells during ischemia-reperfusion. We conclude that delta-opioid-initiated myocardial infarct size reduction is primarily mediated via endogenous epinephrine/beta(2)-AR signaling pathway as a result of ICA cell activation.",

    "72": "Of the 626 patients, 119 (19%) had severe pulmonary hypertension defined as pulmonary artery systolic pressure > or =60 mmHg. Patients with severe pulmonary hypertension had a smaller aortic valve area (P < 0.0001), a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.0001), a higher mitral E/A velocity ratio (P < 0.0001) indicating a higher filling pressure and a higher prevalence of 3 or 4+ mitral regurgitation (P < 0.001). They were less likely to be on a beta blocker (P = 0.05) or a statin (P = 0.02). Smaller aortic valve area, left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation and lack of statin use were independent predictors of severe pulmonary hypertension.",

    "74": "Hypoxia-induced retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death has been implicated in glaucomatous optic neuropathy. However, the precise mechanism of death signaling and how neuroprotective agents affect it are still unclear. The aim of this study is to characterize the mechanisms of hypoxia-induced apoptosis of cultured purified RGCs and to study the neuroprotective effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists. Rat RGCs were purified utilizing a modified two-step immuno-panning procedure. First, the extent of apoptosis in RGCs under hypoxia was quantified. Next, the effects of glutamate-channel antagonists (MK801 or DNQX), Bax inhibiting peptide (BIP), and beta-adrenergic antagonists (betaxolol, nipradilol, timolol or carteolol) on hypoxia-induced RGC death were investigated by the cell viability assay. Third, the effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists on hypoxia-induced increase of intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) and the additional effect of NO scavenger to nipradilol were evaluated. Apoptotic RGC percentages under hypoxia were significantly increased compared to the control. The viability of RGCs under hypoxia was not affected by MK801 or DNQX, whereas it was increased in a dose-dependent manner with exposure to BIP, and to betaxolol, nipradilol, timolol, but not to carteolol. These effective beta-adrenergic antagonists showed no significant change in hypoxia-induced [Ca(2+)](i) levels. The NO scavenger alleviated neuroprotective effect by nipradilol. In conclusion, purified RGC damage induced by hypoxia involves Bax-dependent apoptotic pathway, but mostly independent of glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Betaxolol, timolol and nipradilol showed a protective effect against hypoxia-induced RGC death, which was thought to be irrelevant either to calcium channel or beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects.", 
    "75": "Electroacupuncture (EA) is used to treat a variety of inflammatory diseases; however, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying EA's anti-inflammatory effect remain unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests that the sympathetic nervous system regulates immunologic and inflammatory responses and thus we hypothesized that this system could be involved in EA's anti-inflammatory effect (EA-AI). The goal of the present study was to evaluate whether the sympathetic nervous system plays a critical role in EA-AI using a mouse air pouch inflammation model. We found that bilateral low-frequency (1 Hz) EA applied to the Zusanli acupoint significantly suppressed the number of zymosan-induced leukocytes migrating into the air pouch. Furthermore, double-labeling immunohistochemical experiments showed that EA stimulation increased Fos expression in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons in the intermediolateral region of thoracic spinal cord segments. Chemical sympathetic denervation by intraperitoneal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (which spares sympathetic adrenal medullary innervation) significantly inhibited EA-AI. In contrast, adrenalectomy did not alter EA-AI. Finally, systemic propranolol administration significantly inhibited EA's anti-inflammatory effect, suggesting that beta-adrenoceptors are involved. Collectively, these results suggest that EA produces an anti-inflammatory effect in this mouse air pouch model by activating the sympathetic nervous system leading to the release of catecholamines from post-ganglionic nerve terminals, which act on beta-adrenoceptors on immune cells to inhibit their migration.", 
    "76": "The interaction of hybrid lipid/gramicidin A (gA) monolayers with dextran sulfate (DS) and the effect of this interaction on ion transfer at a liquid-liquid interface is reported. The interfacial and physicochemical properties are studied with Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) and electrochemical techniques. The results obtained from compression isotherms demonstrate that the interactions between the different species in the hybrid monolayer vary according to the chemical nature of the lipid (hydrocarbon region and charge of the head group). Interfacial capacitance measured with AC voltammetry indicates that the DS chains form a rather flat and compact layer when adsorbed to either zwitterionic or negatively charged phospholipid monolayers, and that calcium, even at low concentrations, interacts with the monolayers. These results are successfully described by a model based on the solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation in the interfacial region. Ion transfer and interactions with the lipid/gA/DS-modified monolayers were also studied with electrochemical techniques. Admittance data show that although the studied ions are not using gA channels for the transfer through the lipid membranes, the incorporation of gA in the lipid domain and the adsorption of DS at the interface have a significant effect on ion transfer across the monolayers. This effect can be explained as a consequence of the modified surface charge and of the compactness of the lipid domain due to its interaction with gA and to calcium and DS adsorption at the interface. The ion-transfer rate, therefore, depends on the composition of the monolayer and the chemical nature of the ion.", 
    "77": "This report describes the creation of semipermanent capillary coatings that are compatible with organic-water solvent systems in CE. The coatings are created by simply rinsing the fused-silica capillary with long double-chain cationic surfactants, such as dimethyl-ditetradecyl ammonium bromide (2C(14)DAB), dihexadecyldimethyl ammonium bromide (2C(16)DAB), and dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium bromide (2C(18)DAB). These surfactants generate semipermanent bilayer coatings on the capillary surface, which display a high degree of stability in buffers containing up to 60% v/v of organic solvents, such as methanol and ACN. The coating stability increases with increasing hydrophobicity of the surfactant, i.e., with increasing chain length. For instance, the EOF changes by only 1.2% in a 2C(18)DAB-coated capillary after 130 capillary volumes of rinsing with 60% v/v methanol containing buffer. The bilayer coatings allow separations to be performed without the need to regenerate the coating between runs or to maintain the EOF modifier in the run buffer. Rapid separations (<2 min) of anions and basic drugs with migration time reproducibility of less than 0.5% RSD and efficiencies of 0.4-0.6 million plates/m are obtained. In addition, selectivity changes for small anions and cationic drugs are also observed when the organic solvent content is adjusted.",

    "79": "Timolol maleate is a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist currently used mainly as an ocular preparation for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Despite the topical administration, ophthalmic timolol causes systemic adrenergic beta-blocking because of absorption from the eye into the systemic circulation. Gel formulations of ophthalmic timolol have been developed to reduce systemic absorption and adverse effects in comparison with conventional aqueous solution formulations. Timolol is metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme (CYP2D6). The changes in heart rate (HR) are the most striking effects of the systematically absorbed fraction of ophthalmic timolol, with 0.5 % aqueous formulations presenting larger effects than 0.1 % hydrogel formulations, especially during exercise. Plasma levels of ophthalmic timolol correlate with the changes in HR. Neither 0.5 % aqueous nor 0.1 % hydrogel formulations of timolol have exerted noteworthy effects on systolic (SAP) or diastolic (DAP) arterial pressures, probably because of a compensatory increase in systemic vascular resistance due to the attenuation of HR. Ophthalmic timolol does not exert remarkable effects on pulmonary parameter peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) in non-asthmatic patients. CYP2D6 activity is clearly associated with the pharmacokinetic parameters, particularly when 0.5 % aqueous solution of timolol is used: peak plasma concentration, elimination half-life and area-under-the-curve are highest in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Finally, since there is a correlation between the plasma level of timolol and several haemodynamic effects - especially HR in the state of elevated beta-adrenergic tonus - the CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may be more prone to bradycardia during treatment with (aqueous) ophthalmic timolol.",

    "90": "Hormones that activate receptor tyrosine kinases have been shown to regulate G protein-coupled receptors, and herein we investigate the ability of IGF-I to regulate the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor. Treating Chinese hamster ovary cells in culture with IGF-I is shown to functionally antagonize the ability of expressed beta(1)-adrenergic receptors to accumulate intracellular cAMP in response to stimulation by the beta-adrenergic agonist Iso. The attenuation of beta(1)-adrenergic action was accompanied by internalization of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in response to IGF-I. Inhibiting either phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt blocks the ability of IGF-I to antagonize and to internalize beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. Mutation of one potential Akt substrate site Ser412Ala, but not another Ser312Ala, of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor abolishes the ability of IGF-I to functionally antagonize and to sequester the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor. We also tested the ability of IGF-I to regulate beta(1)-adrenergic receptors and their signaling in adult canine cardiac myocytes. IGF-I attenuates the ability of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors to accumulate intracellular cAMP in response to Iso and promotes internalization of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in these cardiac myocytes.", 
    "91": "Astrocytic glutamate transporters are considered an important target for neuroprotective therapies as the function of these transporters is abnormal in stroke and other neurological disorders associated with excitotoxicity. Recently, Rothstein et al., [Rothstein JD, Patel S, Regan MR, Haenggeli C, Huang YH, Bergles DE, Jin L, Dykes Hoberg M, Vidensky S, Chung DS, Toan SV, Bruijn LI, Su ZZ, Gupta P, Fisher PB (2005) Beta-lactam antibiotics offer neuroprotection by increasing glutamate transporter expression. Nature 433:73-77] reported that beta-lactam antibiotics (including ceftriaxone, which easily crosses the blood-brain barrier) increase glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) expression and reduce cell death resulting from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in dissociated embryonic cortical cultures. To determine whether a similar neuroprotective mechanism operates in more mature neurons, which show a different pattern of response to ischemia than primary cultures, we exposed acute hippocampal slices obtained from rats treated with ceftriaxone for 5 days (200 mg/kg; i.p.) to OGD. Whole-cell patch clamp recording of glutamate-induced N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) currents from CA1 pyramidal neurons showed a larger potentiation of these currents after application of 15 microM dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA; a potent blocker of glutamate transporters) in ceftriaxone-injected animals than in untreated animals, indicating increased glutamate transporter activity. Western blot analysis did not reveal GLT-1 upregulation in the hippocampus. Delay to OGD-induced hypoxic spreading depression (HSD) recorded in slices obtained from ceftriaxone-treated rats was longer (6.3+/-0.2 vs. 5.2+/-0.2 min; P<0.001) than that in the control group, demonstrating a neuroprotective action of the antibiotic in this model. The effect of ceftriaxone was also tested in organotypic hippocampal slices obtained from P7-9 rats (>14 days in vitro). OGD or glutamate (3.5-5.0 mM) damaged CA1 pyramidal neurons as assessed by propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence. Similar damage was observed after pre-treatment with ceftriaxone (10-200 microM; 5 days) and ceftriaxone exposure did not result in GLT-1 upregulation as assayed by Western blot. Treatment of slice cultures with dibutyryl cAMP (100-250 microM; 5 days) increased GLT-1 expression but did not reduce cell damage induced by OGD or glutamate. Thus we confirm the neuroprotective effect of antibiotic exposure on OGD-induced injury, but suggest that this action is related to independent modulation of transporter activity rather than to the level of GLT-1 protein expression. In addition, our results indicate that the protective effects of beta-lactam antibiotics are highly dependent on the experimental model.",

ISO-treated hearts exhibited a 3-fold increase in YY1 and a 2-fold reduction in Elk-1 DNA binding activity, strongly favoring CuZn-SOD gene repression. In isolated cardiomyocytes, sustained (24 h) ISO stimulation significantly (p<0.01) increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), an effect blocked by CGP20712A, a beta1-AR antagonist, but not by ICI118,551, a beta2-AR antagonist. CuZn-SOD downregulation paralleled the increase in ROS, and were similarly blocked by beta1- but not beta2-AR blockade. There were no changes in CuZn-SOD mRNA stability or myocyte size with ISO treatment. However, nuclear run-on revealed a 40% reduction in CuZn-SOD mRNA expression (p<0.01), consistent with transcriptional repression. ISO also depressed total cellular antioxidant capacity, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, and the GSH:GSSG ratio. Moreover, CuZn-SOD siRNA transfection of H9c2 cardiomyocytes to suppress CuZn-SOD protein by approximately 40-50% (analogous to the in vivo changes) induced cellular apoptosis.",

    "96": "We used voltage-clamp technique and biochemical assays to study IK,ACh regulation in atrial appendages from 61 sinus rhythm (SR), 11 paroxysmal AF (pAF), and 33 cAF patients.", 
    "97": "Compared to SR basal current was higher in cAF only, whereas the muscarinic receptor (2 micromol/L carbachol)-activated IK,ACh was smaller in pAF and cAF. In pAF the selective IK,ACh blocker tertiapin abolished the muscarinic receptor-activated IK,ACh but excluded agonist-independent constitutive IK,ACh activity. Blockade of type-2A phosphatase and the subsequent shift to increased muscarinic receptor phosphorylation (and inactivation) reduced muscarinic receptor-activated IK,ACh in SR but not in cAF, pointing to an impaired function of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase. Using subtype-selective kinase inhibitors we found that in SR the muscarinic receptor-activated IK,ACh requires phosphorylation by protein kinase G (PKG), protein kinase C (PKC), and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), but not by protein kinase A (PKA). In cAF, constitutive IK,ACh activity results from abnormal channel phosphorylation by PKC but not by PKG or CaMKII, whereas the additional muscarinic receptor-mediated IK,ACh activation occurs apparently without involvement of these kinases. In cAF, the higher protein level of PKCepsilon but not PKCalpha, PKCbeta1 or PKCdelta is likely to contribute to the constitutive IK,ACh activity.", 
    "98": "The occurrence of constitutive IK,ACh activity in cAF results from abnormal PKC function, whereas the muscarinic receptor-mediated IK,ACh activation does not require the contribution of PKG, PKC or CaMKII. Selective drug targeting of constitutively active IK,ACh channels may be suitable to reduce the ability of AF to become sustained.",

    "100": "This was a randomized, crossover, investigator-masked, active-control study of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Patients received either once-daily 0.5% timolol GFS (n=40) or once-daily 0.005% latanoprost (n=35) for 8 weeks (period 1). Patients were then crossed over to the other medication and treated for another 8 weeks (period 2). Intraocular pressure (IOP) was determined every 2 hours from 8:00 to 20:00 at baseline and weeks 8 and 16. Safety was assessed by visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and adverse event reports.", 
    "101": "During period 1, reduction in mean (SD) diurnal IOP was significantly greater in latanoprost-treated patients (-6.9 [3.0] mm Hg) than in timolol GFS-treated patients (-5.5 [2.4] mm Hg), p=0.034. There was also a significant reduction in IOP from baseline after switching from timolol GFS to latanoprost (p<0.001), not observed when patients were switched from latanoprost to timolol GFS. After results from each drug's treatment periods were combined between treatment arms, latanoprost reduced IOP more (-6.9 [2.9] mm Hg) than did timolol GFS (-6.2 [2.7] mm Hg), p=0.018. Hyperemia was the most common adverse event in both treatment groups, with 5 incidences in timolol GFS-treated patients, and 10 in latanoprost.",

    "103": "Peripheral circulating lymphocytes are easily accessible cells for investigating changes in beta-adrenergic receptors (ADRBs) in humans, but previous reports indicate that these cells only express ADRB2. This study aimed to investigate whether ADRB1 and ADRB3 were expressed in peripheral lymphocytes and the changes of ADRBs in congestive heart failure. Our study demonstrates that ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3 coexist in human peripheral lymphocytes, with differential binding property and expression level. Patients with congestive heart failure had significantly decreased total ADRB density and mRNA levels of ADRB1 and ADRB2 genes, but not ADRB3, compared with healthy subjects. The levels of mRNA of ADRB1 and ADRB2 in peripheral lymphocytes from patients with congestive heart disease were significantly increased after drug treatment. Our study, for the first time, indicates that human peripheral lymphocytes coexpress ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3, which has important implications for precisely predicting clinical response to drug therapy in congestive heart failure.",

The study was conducted at the Adnan Menderes University Hospital in Aydin, Turkey and involved 120 patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II aged 20-50 years. The patients were randomised into four equal groups. The control group (group C) received dextrose 5% 5 mL, the esmolol group (group E) received esmolol 1.5 mg/kg, the fentanyl group (group F) received fentanyl 1 microg/kg and the lidocaine group (group L) received lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg 2 minutes before endotracheal intubation. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and rate-pressure product (RPP) were recorded before and after induction of anaesthesia, immediately after intubation, and 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 minutes after intubation.",

In group F there was an increase in MAP immediately after intubation, but the increase was less than in other groups. Compared with control, RPP decreased significantly in groups E and F after induction, immediately after intubation and 1 minute after intubation (p < 0.0083).

In the whole population we studied native coronary arteries and in 141 cases the patency of coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). The quality of MDCT images was graded as good, sufficient and insufficient.", 
    "113": "We were able to evaluate the patency of all grafts, with the exception of 4 cases. Diagnostic accuracy of CABG evaluation was very high (sensitivity 100%, specificity 98.4%). In native coronary arteries the overall feasibility was 97.9%. The middle left circumflex artery, right coronary artery and posterior descending artery were the segments most often poorly visualized. The first cause of artifacts was misalignment related to high heart rate, followed by premature heart beats and calcified plaque. The population was separated into 3 groups: group 1: heart rate <55 bpm, group 2: 55-65 bpm, group 3: >65 bpm. In group 1, misalignment was significantly lower than in groups 2 and 3. On a segment-based analysis, overall feasibility was therefore significantly higher in group 1 vs group 2 and vs group 3. Images of good quality were significantly higher in group 1 (95.4%) than in group 2 (87%) and group 3 (71.8%). The higher image quality in group 1 impacts on the overall diagnostic accuracy of the exam. Indeed overall sensitivity is significantly higher in group 1 (89.5%) than in group 2 (86%) and group 3 (82.8%) and overall specificity is significantly higher in group 1 than in group 3.",

A non-responder was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect less than 15% compared with baseline measurement. Two 12-hour IOP diurnal curves, measured between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (8:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 12:00 noon, 2:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.), were obtained retrospectively from the records of 31 patients, the first while on prostaglandin analogs/prostamides (baseline IOP) and the second while receiving DTFC (DTFC IOP). The study outcomes were the change in mean diurnal IOP and the reduction in IOP fluctuation as a result of receiving DTFC in patients unresponsive to prostas. The IOP was evaluated by intragroup comparisons with a two-tailed paired Student's t-test. A chi-square test was adopted for analysis of categorical variables.",

    "127": "The catecholamine norepinephrine is a critical effector of the mammalian stress response and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-a syndrome intrinsically related to the experience of extraordinary stress. Symptom-linked hypernoradrenergic derangements have been observed in PTSD and several studies have examined the potential therapeutic effects of agents that dampen the centrally hyperactive noradrenergic state. These agents include compounds that decrease norepinephrine release (e.g. centrally acting alpha(2) agonists such as clonidine) and those which block post-synaptic norepinephrine receptors (e.g. centrally acting alpha(1) or beta receptor antagonists such as prazosin or propranolol). In this article, we review studies of central noreadrenergic hyperactivity under both basal and challenge conditions and explore the evidence for these derangements as potential psychopharmacologic targets in patients with PTSD. Given the significant involvement of CNS norepinephrine hyperactivity in PTSD, and its link to intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms, it is not surprising that interventions directed at this system have therapeutic potential in PTSD. The utility of these anti-adrenergics in the clinical treatment of PTSD remains to be determined, though it is possible that they may prove to have primary roles in a disorder that is only modestly responsive to antidepressant treatment.",

    "130": "Enhanced memory for novel or unexpected stimuli is mediated by anterior hippocampus, whereas increased memory for emotional stimuli is mediated by a beta-adrenergic-dependent modulation of amygdala-hippocampal interactions. We introduce a hypothesis that medial temporal connectivity with autonomic control centres may be central to this memory enhancement.",

    "132": "Ocular inflammation can arise in the form of conjunctivitis, uveitis, episcleritis and scleritis. The uveitides can be subdivided by anatomical location into anterior and posterior uveitis or categorized by location of inflammation, e.g., iritis, pars planitis or iridocyclitis. Multiple drugs have been associated with ocular inflammation and much has been written on the subject. Discussed here is a sampling of drugs representing classes of medication associated with ocular inflammation. However, this is not a comprehensive list and interested readers are encouraged to access the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects (Casey Eye Institute, Portland, Oregon, www.eyedrugregistry.com) or the textbook Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects for further information (1). The agents discussed may be administered systemically, topically or intracamerally (inside the eye). The mechanism behind ocular inflammation is frequently unknown. Prevention and treatment are based upon physician recognition and withdrawal of the drug in some instances. Consultation with an ophthalmologist is recommended, as many types of ocular inflammation can threaten vision.", 
    "133": "Fixed-combination travoprost/timolol solution consists of travoprost 0.004% and timolol 0.5%. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of this medication used once daily for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. This fixed combination has been compared to travoprost and timolol used concomitantly, latanoprost and timolol used concomitantly, latanoprost/timolol fixed combination and travoprost and timolol monotherapy. Fixed-combination medicines such as travoprost/timolol offer the potential of maximizing patient adherence by decreasing the burden of using multiple topical agents that lower intraocular pressure, and by potentially decreasing the overall cost to both the patient and the health-care system. We discuss the benefits of fixed-dose medications, report on previous clinical trials and summarize the existing data on the performance of travoprost/timolol.", 
    "134": "During 2006, new evidence supporting the need to adopt a global approach to the treatment of cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients has been reported. It is increasingly clear that it is not sufficient to aim for optimum blood pressure control, which in any case is not easy to achieve, and that it is essential to treat all cardiovascular risk factors by using drugs with proven benefits, even when those benefits are supplementary to the drug's principal effects. In addition, drugs that could have a detrimental effect or that are, merely, less beneficial should be avoided or kept as a last resort. This appears to have happened with atenolol, and with beta-blockers in general, which have been withdrawn as first-line treatment in the recommendations of some professional societies. To lower cardiovascular risk, it is essential to prevent the development of conditions like diabetes, which are known to have drastic effect on the patient's prognosis. Recently, the results of the DREAM study, which are discussed in detail in this article, have been reported. They could lead to a change in therapeutic strategy in patients who are expected to develop diabetes. In addition, this year has seen the publication of substantial data on a new antihypertensive agent, aliskiren, the first oral renin inhibitor. It is awaiting approval by the international medicine agencies (i.e., the FDA and the EMEA), but should provide a very promising tool in the difficult area of high blood pressure management. Despite numerous advances in the pharmacologic treatment of high blood pressure, control is very difficult to achieve, principally in the elderly, in whom the prevalence of hypertension is high. In these patients, social factors and difficulties with treatment compliance also have an influence and must be dealt with by public health measures aimed at improving blood pressure control.", 
    "135": "We evaluated whether the changes in the insulin sensitivity observed in hypertensive patients following treatment with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (candesartan) or calcium-channel antagonist (amlodipine) might be related to improvement of the endothelial function (END) and/or plasma level of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) following such treatment.", 
    "136": "Seventy-one hypertensive patients (age: 58 +/- 10 years) without obvious target organ damage were allocated randomly to treatment with either candesartan at the dose of 8 mg/day or amlodipine at the dose of 5 mg/day. At the start and end of the 8-month treatment period, the homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR index), plasma CRP and END, as assessed by changes in the forearm blood flow in reactive hyperemia, were determined. While significant improvement of END was observed in patients receiving either drug, only candesartan, but not amlodipine, also reduced the plasma CRP and HOMA-IR index (2.13 +/- 1.92 --> 1.53 +/- 1.47, P < 0.05). In the patients receiving treatment with candesartan, stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the percent change in the HOMA-IR index was significantly and independently correlated with that in the plasma CRP (beta = 0.38, P < 0.05), but not with that in END:", 
    "137": "Improvement of the END alone by the antihypertensive medication might not entirely explain the improvement of the insulin sensitivity observed in these patients. Additional mechanisms may be involved, and the anti-inflammatory effects of the medication observed in patients treated with candesartan may also be related, at least in part, to the observed improvement of insulin sensitivity.", 
    "138": "It has been shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade may improve endothelial dysfunction, an early manifestation of atherosclerosis, in patients with diabetes. Whether this protective effect is mediated through blood pressure-lowering effects or other specific mechanisms such as a reduction in oxidative stress is not clear. We investigated the influence of losartan, compared with atenolol, on endothelial function and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.", 
    "139": "Thirteen patients were included in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study; they received losartan 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks followed by atenolol 50 mg twice daily or vice versa. Concomitant medication with renin-angiotensin blocking agents or beta-blockers was withdrawn, whereas other medication remained unchanged. At baseline and after each treatment period, flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery and oxidative stress were measured in serum samples.", 
    "140": "Flow-mediated dilation was increased significantly after 4 weeks' treatment with losartan (3.4 +/- 0.44%) compared with atenolol (2.58 +/- 0.42%; P = 0.01). 8-Isoprostanes, a marker of oxidative stress, were significantly reduced in the losartan group compared with baseline (0.039 +/- 0.007 versus 0.067 +/- 0.006 ng/ml; P = 0.01), but did not differ from baseline with atenolol. Glucose, hemoglobin A1c, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, lipids and systolic blood pressure remained unaltered, whereas diastolic blood pressure tended to be lower in the atenolol group.", 
    "141": "This study demonstrates that losartan significantly improved endothelial function in type 2 diabetes patients with hypertension compared with atenolol. This must be independent of the blood pressure-lowering effect of losartan and is probably caused by an antioxidative effect of the angiotensin receptor blocker.", 
    "142": "Oxidative and inflammatory stresses are cardinal in the pathogenesis of hypertension and atherosclerosis. Oxidative stress also leads to the induction of inflammation through the activation of proinflammatory transcription factors. Understanding the mechanisms leading to oxidative stress and the means of suppressing it are important in controlling complications related to atherogenesis, since oxidative and inflammatory stress are important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The failure of chemical antioxidants [which scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS)], such as vitamins E and C, has led to further exploration of the ROS-suppressive effects of drugs used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Carvedilol has been shown to possess both ROS-scavenging and ROS-suppressive effects, and its use is associated with a reduction in oxidative stress. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory effects of carvedilol have now been described. Although further clinical investigations are required, these properties may contribute to the improvement in clinical outcomes observed with carvedilol.", 
    "143": "Augmented sympathoadrenal activity during exercise may contribute to occurrence of various arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation (AF). The prolongation of intraatrial and interatrial conduction times and inhomogeneous propagation of sinus impulses are well-known characteristics of the atrium prone to fibrillate and are evaluated by maximum P-wave duration (P max), P-wave dispersion (PWD). To show the increased P max and PWD values in patients experiencing AF during exercise testing and the role of beta blockade on treatment of exercise-induced AF, 22 of these patients were compared with a control group consisting of 41 patients without AF attacks. P max (p = 0.001) and PWD (p = 0.001) values were significantly higher in patients with AF compared to those without AF. The development of AF during exercise testing was found to be positively correlated with P max (r = 0.87, p < 0.001), PWD (r = 0.83, p = 0.001), and work load (r = 0.34, p = 0.002) and negatively correlated with ejection fraction (r = -0.26, p=0.02). After the treatment with beta-blocking agents for 2 weeks, the decrease in P max and PWD values was accompanied by a much lower prevalence of exercise-induced AF. Consequently, the patients with AF had greater P max and PWD values compared to control subjects, and these simple parameters were well correlated with the occurrence of AF during exercise testing. Furthermore, treatment of these patients with beta blockers would appear to decrease the recurrence of exercise-induced AF and to be associated with a decrease in P-wave durations.", 
    "144": "Ethyl-4-[trans-4-[((2S)-2-hydroxy-3-[4-hydroxy-3[(methylsulfonyl)amino] phenoxy]propyl) amino]cyclohexyl]benzoate hydrochloride (SAR150640) was characterized as a new potent and selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist for the treatment of preterm labor. SAR150640 and its major metabolite, the corresponding acid 4-[trans-4-[((2S)-2-hydroxy-3-[4-hydroxy-3[(methylsulfonyl) amino] phenoxy]propyl)amino]cyclohexyl]benzoic acid (SSR500400), showed high affinity for beta(3)-adrenoceptors (K(i) = 73 and 358 nM) and greater potency than (-)-isoproterenol in increasing cAMP production in membrane preparations from human neuroblastoma cells (SKNMC), which express native beta(3)-adrenoceptors (pEC(50) = 6.5, 6.2, and 5.1, respectively). SAR150640 and SSR500400 also increased cAMP production in membrane preparations from human uterine smooth muscle cells (UtSMC), which also express native beta(3)-adrenoceptors (pEC(50) = 7.7 and 7.7, respectively). In these cells, SAR150640 dose-dependently inhibited oxytocin-induced intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation. SAR150640 and SSR500400 had no beta(1)- or beta(2)-agonist or antagonist activity in guinea pig atrium and trachea, or in human isolated atrium and bronchus preparations. Both compounds concentration-dependently inhibited spontaneous contractions in human near-term myometrial strips, with greater potency than salbutamol and 4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)-amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one hydrochloride (CGP12177) (pIC(50) = 6.4, 6.8, 5.9, and 5.8, respectively), but with similar potency to (-)-isoproterenol and atosiban (oxytocin/vasopressin V(1)a receptor antagonist). SAR150640 also inhibited the contractions induced by oxytocin and prostaglandin F(2alpha). In vivo, after intravenous administration, SAR150640 (1 and 6 mg/kg), but not atosiban (6 mg/kg), dose-dependently inhibited myometrial contractions in conscious unrestrained female cynomolgus monkeys, with no significant effects on heart rate or blood pressure. In contrast, salbutamol (50 and 250 microg/kg) had no inhibitory effect on uterine contractions, but it dose-dependently increased heart rate. These findings indicate a potential for the therapeutic use of SAR150640 in mammals during preterm labor.",

The surgical stress index (SSI) is derived from the photoplethysmographic waveform amplitude and the heart beat-to-beat interval. We evaluated the ability of SSI to measure surgical stress in patients undergoing gynaecological laparoscopy. Our hypothesis was that while keeping State Entropy (SE) at a predetermined level, SSI would be higher in patients receiving a beta-blocking agent (esmolol) than in those receiving an opioid (remifentanil) during laparoscopy.", 
    "146": "Thirty women undergoing gynaecological laparoscopy were assigned randomly to receive esmolol (n = 15) or remifentanil (n = 15). Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl and maintained with desflurane and nitrous oxide 50% in oxygen to keep SE at 50(5). The infusion of esmolol or remifentanil was started before laparoscopy and adjusted to keep the systolic blood pressure at -20 to +10% from the preoperative value.",

In the patients receiving esmolol, the SSI reacted to the initial incision (P < 0.05), and remained high after trocar insertion (P < 0.05). In patients receiving remifentanil, it did not react to the initial incision, but increased after trocar insertion (P < 0.05), and it remained lower both after incision (P < 0.05) and after trocar insertion (P < 0.05).",

    "149": "In this work, a novel strategy was constructed to determine the enantiomeric composition of chiral substances discriminated by bovine serum albumin (BSA) based on the UV-vis spectra of the receptor-ligand mixtures coupled with partial least squares (PLS-1) analysis. Taking tryptophan (Trp) enantiomer as an example, when 20 microM BSA was used, the enantiomeric composition was accurately determined with concentration of only 100 nM and the corresponding enantiomeric excess as high as 98% (or -98%), which is relatively more sensitive than in literature. Furthermore, the BSA-based approach was also used to predict the enantiomeric composition of other chiral compounds, such as phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), alanine (Ala), cysteine (Cys), DOPA and propranolol (Prop). The results fully demonstrate that BSA is effective in determination of enantiomeric composition of some chiral compounds.",

Drugs evaluated included cisapride (>98% ppb), risperidone (90% ppb), and d, l-sotalol (negligible ppb). Effects on APD were monitored using standard microelectrode techniques under physiologic conditions and temperature ([K(+)]=4 mM, 37 degrees C) during slow stimulation (2 s basic cycle length).",

Because of the complex drug interactions that occur in plasma, the electrophysiological effects seen with bound drugs are not well correlated with the calculated free fraction and thus caution should be exercised when assigning a predictive safety window. Thus, the canine Purkinje fiber assay is useful for defining the modulation of delayed repolarization due to plasma protein binding of novel therapeutic agents.",

Traditional parameters such as left ventricular ejection fraction and the presence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia were not strong enough to achieve this goal with reasonable cost-effectiveness. Heart rate variability (HRV) is one of the most popular parameters used to assess the autonomic tone. HRV has been reported as a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Currently, three different categories of methods in HRV analysis are being used; the time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis. Both time domain and frequency domain analyses of HRV have been investigated extensively regarding their use as a prognostic marker for cardiovascular mortality. The non-linear dynamic analysis is the latest tool that has shown to have an even higher predictive value than any of the traditional parameters. However, standardized and supporting evidence on this new technique is still lacking. In this article, the current role of HRV in the prediction of cardiovascular mortality in myocardial infarction and heart failure patients has been reviewed.", 
    "169": "Many studies investigating drug interactions with citrus compounds focus on the major grapefruit furanocoumarins bergamottin, dihydroxybergamottin, and the flavonoid naringenin. This study evaluated the influence of polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), tangeretin, nobiletin, 3,5,6,7,8,3,4'-heptamethoxyflavone, and sinensetin, as well as other minor occurring citrus phenols, hesperetin, limettin, 7-OH-coumarin, 7-geranyloxycoumarin, and eriodictyol, on P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of the beta-blocker talinolol using the Caco-2 cell monolayer model and was used to determine the structure-function aspects of the interaction. The transport of talinolol across Caco-2 cells monolayers was determined in the absence and presence of distinct concentrations of the calcium-channel blocker verapamil (a known inhibitor of P-glycoprotein) and citrus compounds. A sigmoid dose-response model was used to fit the data and to estimate the IC50 values of the potential inhibitors. Results from this study show that PMFs significantly decreased talinolol transport from the basolateral to apical side, where tangeretin had the lowest IC50 of 3.2 micromol/L, followed by nobiletin, heptamethoxyflavone, and sinensetin with IC50 values of 3.5, 3.8, and 3.9 micromol/L, respectively. However, the efficacy of the compounds did not appear to be dependent on the number of methoxy groups. Other citrus compounds did not have any significant effect on the transport of talinolol. This study suggests that PMFs have a high potential in the interaction with P-gp-mediated talinolol transport in Caco-2 cells. Based on their relatively low concentrations (< or =3 microg/mL) in citrus, the clinical relevance of these interactions needs to be further elucidated in in vivo studies.", 
    "170": "Management of pain by opioid analgesics is confounded by central adverse effects that limit clinical dosages. Consequently, there is considerable interest to understand peripheral analgesic effects of opioids. The actions of opioids on peripheral sensory neurons have been difficult to study because of a general lack of effect of opioid agonists on nociceptor function in culture despite documented presence of opioid receptors. In this study, the micro-opioid receptor agonist, [D-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin (DAMGO), did not alter guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)-triphosphate (GTPgamma[(35)S]) binding, adenylyl cyclase activity, or neuropeptide release in primary cultures of rat trigeminal ganglion (TG). However, after brief exposure to bradykinin (BK), DAMGO stimulated GTPgamma[(35)S] binding and inhibited both prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2))-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and BK/PGE(2)-stimulated neuropeptide release. The effect of BK was blocked by the B(2) antagonist HOE 140 [D-Arg[Hyp(3),Thi(5),D-Tic(7),Oic(8)]-bradykinin], but not by the B(1) antagonist, Lys-[Leu8]des-Arg9-BK, and was mimicked by the protease-activated receptor-2 agonist, Ser-Leu-Ile-Gly-Arg-Leu-NH(2), and by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or by administration of arachidonic acid (AA). The enhanced responsiveness of micro-opioid receptor signaling by BK priming was blocked by both cyclooxygenase and PKC inhibitors; however, the effect of AA was blocked only by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. The results indicate that micro-opioid receptor signaling in primary sensory TG neurons is enhanced by activation of phospholipase C-coupled receptors via a cyclooxygenase-dependent AA metabolite that is downstream of PKC.", 
    "171": "The C terminus of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor (AR) interacts with G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins in an agonist-dependent manner, suggesting that conformational changes induced by ligands in the transmembrane domains are transmitted to the C terminus. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to examine ligand-induced structural changes in the distance between two positions on the beta(2)-AR C terminus and cysteine 265 (Cys-265) at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane domain 6. The donor fluorophore FlAsH (Fluorescein Arsenical Helix binder) was attached to a CCPGCC motif introduced at position 351-356 in the proximal C terminus or at the distal C terminus. An acceptor fluorophore, Alexa Fluor 568, was attached to Cys-265. FRET analyses revealed that the average distances between Cys-265 and the proximal and distal FlAsH sites were 57 and 62A(,) respectively. These relatively large distances suggest that the C terminus is in an extended, relatively unstructured conformation. Nevertheless, we observed ligand-specific changes in FRET. All ligands induced an increase in FRET between the proximal C-terminal FlAsH site and Cys-265. Ligands that have been shown to induce arrestin-dependent ERK activation, including the catecholamine agonists and the inverse agonist ICI118551, led to a decrease in FRET between the distal FlAsH site and Cys-265, whereas other ligands had no effect or induced a small increase in FRET. Taken together the results provide new insight into the structure of the C terminus of the beta(2)-AR as well as ligand-induced conformational changes that may be relevant to arrestin-dependent regulation and signaling.",

The origin of thromboembolism is often the left atrial appendix (LAA). Flow rate velocity (FRV) inside the LAA is the major determinant of thrombus formation. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of diltiazem and metoprolol used for ventricular rate control on FRV of the LAA in CAF patients and thus to evaluate the positive or negative effects of these two drugs on thromboembolic events.", 
    "173": "Sixty-four patients were included in the study. All patients were suffering from CAF for more than a year. The patients were allocated to two groups according with agent used for rate control- metoprolol (Group 1; n=31) and diltiazem (Group 2; n=33). Transesophageal echocardiography was applied to all patients and LAA FRV was measured by a pulse wave Doppler in the 1/3 proximal portion of the LAA. The measurements were repeated after applying 5 mg metoprolol to Group 1 and 25 mg diltiazem to Group 2 via venous cannula.",

All transfers were successful applying the same chromatographic conditions, except for insulin where the acetonitrile content of the mobile phase was reduced by 0.5%. The intraday and interday precisions for both retention time and peak area were evaluated over a wide concentration range. Results were found to be equal, or slightly better on Chromolith Performance with RSD%<1.1% in all cases. Monolithic batch to batch repeatability of both retention time and peak area, compared for monolithic columns from different batches gave an RSD% of less than 1.3%. The separation of each drug and its related products was investigated on monolithic columns at flow rates from 1 to 9 ml/min, and superior resolution was always obtained using monolithic over conventional columns at the same flow rate. A total of seven monolithic columns from four different batches were used in this study.", 
    "177": "Using immunocytochemical and whole cell recording techniques, we examined expression of glycine receptors on bullfrog retinal cone photoreceptors. Immunofluorescence double labeling experiments conducted on retinal sections and isolated cell preparations showed that terminals and inner segments of cones were immunoreactive to both alpha1 and beta subunits of glycine receptors. Moreover, application of glycine induced a sustained inward current from isolated cones, which increased in amplitude in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 (concentration of glycine producing half-maximal response) of 67.3+/-4.9 microM, and the current was blocked by the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine, but not 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (DCKA) of 200 microM, a blocker of the glycine recognition site at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The glycine-induced current reversed in polarity at a potential close to the calculated chloride equilibrium potential, and the reversal potential was changed as a function of the extracellular chloride concentration. These results suggest that strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors are functionally expressed in bullfrog cones, which may mediate signal feedback from glycinergic interplexiform cells to cones in the outer retina.", 
    "178": "Carvedilol, a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist with strong antioxidant activity, produces a high degree of cardioprotection in a variety of experimental models of ischemic cardiac injury. Although growing evidences suggest specific effects on mitochondrial metabolism, how carvedilol would exert its overall activity has not been completely disclosed. In the present work we have investigated the impact of carvedilol-treatment on mitochondrial bioenergetic functions and ROS metabolism in H9C2 cells. This analysis has revealed a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory fluxes by NAD-dependent substrates associated with a consistent decline of mitochondrial complex I activity. These changes were associated with an increase in mitochondrial H(2)O(2) production, total glutathione and protein thiols content. To evaluate the antioxidant activity of carvedilol, the effect of the exposure of control and carvedilol-pretreated H9C2 cells to H(2)O(2) were investigated. The H(2)O(2)-mediated oxidative insult resulted in a significant decrease of mitochondrial respiration, glutathione and protein thiol content and in an increased level of GSSG. These changes were prevented by carvedilol-pretreatment. A similar protective effect on mitochondrial respiration could be obtained by pre-treatment of the cells with a sub-saturating amount of rotenone, a complex I inhibitor. We therefore suggest that carvedilol exerts its protective antioxidant action both by a direct antioxidant effect and by a preconditioning-like mechanism, via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I.", 
    "179": "Atherosclerosis accounts for most peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD). Although many of the risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) such as hyperlipidemia have been identified as risk factors for peripheral arterial disease, strong evidence is lacking that risk factor modification is effective in halting progression or improving outcomes. A better understanding is needed regarding the clinical and pathophysiologic responses to risk factor modification. This review describes current advances in the medical management for PAD including lipid modification antiplatelet therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, exercise, and endovascular intervention. In addition, we discuss our active ELIMIT Trial (Effect of Lipid Modification on Peripheral Arterial Disease after Endovascular Intervention). We test the hypothesis that an aggressive regimen of serum lipid modification will inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis in femoral arteries and reduce the incidence of restenosis of femoral arteries following endovascular stenting by decreasing thrombosis and inflammation. This study will provide a novel strategy for retarding or preventing progression of atherosclerosis and re-stenosis of peripheral arterial disease following arterial revascularization procedures. Importantly, our magnetic resonance imaging studies will provide quantitative data on the vascular lesions in PAD. These studies will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of inflammation and thrombosis associated with aggressive lipid modification.", 
    "180": "Stress negatively influences wound healing in a clinically relevant manner. In an animal model, repeated restraint stress (RST) impairs wound healing in mice, partially through stress-induced glucocorticoid (GC) release. However, the role of stress-induced catecholamines (i.e., (nor)epinephrine) in healing has not been elucidated. In the present study, two 3.5mm round dermal wounds were placed on the backs of mice. Animals were restrained overnight for 3 days prior to and 5 days post-wounding. Prior to RST, mice were injected with either phentolamine or nadolol: non-specific alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, respectively. Pictures were taken daily to measure the rates of wound closure and contraction. Blockade of alpha-adrenergic, but not beta-adrenergic receptors, attenuated impairments in wound closure and contraction, and normalized edema, in RST mice. Thus, although stress impairment in wound healing clearly involves GCs, catecholamines play an important role via alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation.",

Adrenergic stimulation favors atrial arrhythmogenesis but its effects on IKH are poorly understood.", 
    "182": "Adrenergic modulation of IKH was studied in isolated canine atrial cardiomyocytes with whole-cell patch-clamping, and action-potential consequences were assessed in multicellular preparations with fine-tipped microelectrodes. Isoproterenol increased IKH in a concentration-dependent manner (maximum 103+/-22% increase), an effect mimicked by forskolin and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP. Isoproterenol effects were prevented by propranolol and the selective beta1-adrenoceptor blocker CGP-20712A, but not the beta2-blocker ICI-118551. Isoproterenol enhancement was prevented by pipette-administered protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor peptide or by superfusion of H89 (PKA blocker). Phenylephrine decreased IKH in a reversible, concentration-dependent way. This effect was blocked by the alpha-antagonist prazosin and the selective alpha1A-blocker niguldipine, but not the alpha1B-blocker chloroethylclonidine or the alpha1D inhibitor BMY-7378. Phenylephrine effects were prevented by the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide. The PKC-activating phorbol ester PDD (but not its inactive analogue alpha-PDD) mimicked phenylephrine effects. Action potential recordings in the presence and absence of the selective IKH blocker tertiapin indicated a functional role of alpha- and beta-adrenergic actions on IKH. Adrenergic regulation of cholinergic agonist-induced K+ current paralleled that of IKH.",

This was a prospective, examiner masked, randomised and crossover study. Participants were 32 consecutive subjects, who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, with newly diagnosed OAG. Patients were randomised to either LTFC or DTFC for the first 1-month treatment phase after a 1-month washout period, without medical treatment, patients began with the opposite treatment for the second 1-month treatment period. Colour Doppler parameters in ophthalmic artery (OA) and posterior ciliary arteries (PCA), ocular perfusion pressure, IOP and systemic haemodynamics were assessed at each baseline and at the end of each treatment period. The main outcomes include peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV) and resistance index (RI) in OA and PCA. DTFC significantly increased EDV in OA from 7.55 (1.16) to 9.32 (1.22), p<0.0001, and in the PCA from 4.41 (0.70) to 5.36 (0.60), p<0.0001, and significantly decreased RI in OA from 0.775 (0.036) to 0.725 (0.032), p<0.0001, and in the PCA from 0.694 (0.045) to 0.634 (0.034). LTFC significantly decreased the EDV and significantly increased RI in PCA, p=0.0076 and p=0.0009, respectively. There were no statistical significant differences in the IOP lowering effect between both treatments. DTFC seems to have a beneficial vascular effect on retrobulbar vessels in OAG patients.",

In order to avert these ischemic episodes, beta-blockers must be continued or introduced during vascular surgery. In other types of surgery, they must be considered.
