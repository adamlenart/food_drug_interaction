This response can last for as long as 1 year after injury and is associated with impaired wound healing, increased infection risks, erosion of lean body mass, hampered rehabilitation, and delayed reintegration of burn survivors into society. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies may be used to reverse the catabolic effect of thermal injury. Nonpharmacologic strategies include early excision and wound closure of burn wound, aggressive treatment of sepsis, elevation of the environmental temperature to thermal neutrality (31.5 +/- 0.7 degrees C), high carbohydrate, high protein continuous enteral feeding, and early institution of resistive exercise programs. Pharmacologic modulators of the postburn hypermetabolic response may be achieved through the administration of recombinant human growth hormone, low-dose insulin infusion, use of the synthetic testosterone analog, oxandrolone, and beta blockade with propranolol.

Device based treatment consisting of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) devices offer new modes of treatment to patients with symptomatic heart failure despite optimal medical therapy. ICDs have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe heart failure while CRT leads to an improvement in functional class, quality of life scores, physiological measures such as peak Vo(2), and reduce hospitalisations. Combination devices, which provide both ICD and CRT functions, have now been seen to provide synergistic benefits in selected patients.",

Right atria from rats 48 h after sinoaortic denervation were subsensitive to isoprenaline, norepinephrine and CGP12177. One week after sinoaortic denervation, the sensitivity to CGP12177 had recovered whereas the responses to isoprenaline and norepinephrine were still subsensitive, suggesting that the binding sites for these molecules showed independent behavior. In atria from 48 h sinoaortic-denervated rats, propranolol or 3 microM CGP20712A (2-hydroxy-5(2-((2-hydroxy-3-(4-((methyl-4-trifluormethyl)1H imidazole-2-yl)-phenoxypropyl) amino) ethoxy)-benzamide monomethane sulphonate)) blocked the responses to 10 nM-1 microM CGP12177 and steepened the curves. The concentration-response curves to CGP12177 in the presence of ICI118,551 (erythro-DL-1(-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylamino-butan-2-ol) were biphasic, suggesting that CGP12177 interacted with at least two conformations of beta-adrenoceptors that showed negative cooperativism, one acting through beta(2)-adrenoceptor-Gi and the other via beta(1)-adrenoceptor-Gs.

We also assessed type of plaque (calcified, noncalcified, or mixed) and its anatomic distribution. Of 85 patients included, 78 (92%) had fully evaluable multislice computed tomograms that allowed assessment of coronary plaque burden, including major and side branches (>or=2 mm), yielding a total of 855 segments. These 78 patients (92% men; mean age +/- SD 58 +/- 11.5 years) were in sinus rhythm, with heart rates of <70 beats/min (spontaneous or induced by beta blocker). Plaque was detected in 57% of all segments (487 of 855). The mean number of segments with plaque per patient +/- SD was 6.2 +/- 3.9. Plaque was classified as large in 33% of segments and small in 67%. Overall, 65% of plaques were calcified, 24% were noncalcified, and 11% were mixed.

We report here a case of cesarian section in a patient with R-W syndrome whose QT prolongation was successfully managed with landiolol, a selective beta1 receptor blocker. A 25-year-old woman with R-W syndrome was scheduled for cesarean section. In the operating room, the patient's ECG showed tachycardia (102 beats x min(-1)) and marked QT prolongation (QTc = 0.56 s). After spinal anesthesia, the patient's heart rate (HR) increased to 130 beats/min accompanied by a slight decrease in arterial blood pressure to 97/57 mmHg and the QTc was prolonged to 0.57 s. Landiolol was continuously infused at a rate of 0.04 mg.kg(-1) x min(-1) and the HR gradually decreased to 80-90 beats x min(-1) accompanied by the normalization of QTc to 0.48 s. We thought that the use of landiolol was more rational and was preferable to a nonselective beta receptor blocker for a term-pregnant woman because blockade of the beta2 receptor might cause uterine contraction. After the use of landiolol, intraoperative and postoperative courses in both the patient and the baby were uneventful.",

Thanks to the contribution of molecular genetics, the genetic bases, pathogenesis, and genotype-phenotype correlation of both diseases have been progressively unveiled and shown to have an extremely high degree of genetic heterogeneity. The clinical manifestation of the diseases is also highly variable. Symptomatic patients experience ventricular tachyarrhythmias which may lead to recurrent syncope and/or sudden cardiac death. In long QT syndrome patients with syncope, therapy with beta-blockers has proven effective. When, despite beta-blocker treatment, arrhythmia-related symptoms continue to occur, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is indicated. Such a device should also be implanted in resuscitated patients. In symptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome, the implantable cardioverter defibrillator is the only life-saving option. In asymptomatic patients with a Brugada ECG pattern, risk stratification has become of utmost importance in order to discover which patients really need definitive treatment.",

The total direct cost incurred by the health plan and patients was dollar 309 million (dollar 2,312 per patient-month of follow-up); 72% of total costs were attributable to hospitalizations. The majority of costs were medical (dollar 286 million, 93%), and dollar 23 million (7%) were pharmacy costs. Fifty-one percent of patients had a revascularization procedure, which was typically performed during the index hospitalization (median time to revascularization was 0 days). Coronary artery stent implantation was the most common revascularization procedure (68%).

    "49": "Carvedilol is a beta- and alpha-adrenergic-blocking drug with clinically important antiarrhythmic properties. It possesses anti-ischemic and antioxidant activity and inhibits a number of cationic channels in the cardiomyocyte, including the HERG-associated potassium channel, the L-type calcium channel, and the rapid-depolarizing sodium channel. The electrophysiologic properties of carvedilol include moderate prolongation of action potential duration and effective refractory period; slowing of atrioventricular conduction; and reducing the dispersion of refractoriness. Experimentally, carvedilol reduces complex and repetitive ventricular ectopy induced by ischemia and reperfusion. In patients, carvedilol is effective in controlling the ventricular rate response in atrial fibrillation (AF), with and without digitalis, and is useful in maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion, with and without amiodarone. In patients with AF and heart failure (HF), carvedilol reduces mortality risk and improves left ventricular (LV) function. Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated that combined carvedilol and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy significantly reduces sudden cardiac death, mortality, and ventricular arrhythmia in patients with LV dysfunction (LVD) due to chronic HF or following myocardial infarction (MI). Despite intensive neurohormonal blockade, mortality rates remain relatively high in patients with post-MI and nonischemic LVD. Recent trials of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators added to pharmacologic therapy, especially beta blockers, have shown a further reduction in arrhythmic deaths in these patients.",

    "51": "The aim of this study was to analyse the in vitro effect of carvedilol on aggregation of human blood platelets, to compare this effect with the effect of propranolol and atenolol, and to determine whether its suggested antiaggregatory effect was accompanied with reduced thromboxane B2 formation. Moreover, some physico-chemical parameters of the drugs tested were calculated and compared.",

The reduction was accompanied by inhibition of thromboxane B2 formation. In comparison to propranolol, carvedilol was more effective, with the exception for aggregation stimulated with ADP. Atenolol did not affect any platelet function tested. From the drugs studied, the molecule of carvedilol was found to possess the highest partition coefficient, the highest index of molar refractivity, and the lowest dipole moment.", 
    "54": "Our study found carvedilol to be more potent than propranolol and atenolol in inhibiting platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 production. This may be due to the different structure and more convenient physico-chemical parameters of the carvedilol molecule.", 
    "55": "In patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation cardiac glycosides, generally in combination with beta-blockers, are indicated to control ventricular rate. In systolic heart failure and sinus rhythm, however, the use of digitalis continues to be debated. There are special concerns that cardiac glycosides might lead to an increased mortality rate in women. Retrospective analyses, however, do not indicate any sex-based differences in the effectiveness of cardiac glycosides. Beneficial effects of cardiac glycosides in heart failure seem to be related to the attenuation of sympathetic activation and neurohumoral alterations, which is already obtained at low digoxin serum concentrations, while high serum levels are associated with increased mortality. Therefore, in patients with sinus rhythm who remain symptomatic under an optimized therapy with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and diuretics in addition to digitalis should be considered regardless of the gender. However, target serum digoxin concentrations should be low in a range of 0.5 to 0.8 ng/ml.",

However, beta-blockers tended to increase the risk of pulmonary edema (relative risk, 2.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-6.23). Magnesium tested in one unblinded trial also reduced the risk of atrial tachyarrhythmia (relative risk, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.78). On the other hand, digitalis preparations were found to be harmful because they increased the risk of atrial tachyarrhythmia in 3 trials (relative risk, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.28). Finally, 2 other medications, flecainide and amiodarone, were each tested in a single small trial, and their effects were associated with great uncertainty.", 
    "59": "Calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers are effective in reducing postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmia. The use of these medications should be individualized, and possible adverse events of beta-blockers should be taken into account. Randomized clinical trials do not support the use of digitalis in general thoracic surgery. The value of magnesium as a supplement to a main prophylactic regimen should be explored.",

Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients with heart failure, without influencing peak VO2, raising the possibility that peak VO2 is no longer suitable as an indicator of prognosis in these patients.", 
    "61": "We analyzed prospectively gathered data on 2105 patients referred for cardiopulmonary testing for all-cause mortality and for occurrence of death or transplantation. Patients receiving beta-blockers were younger, more likely to have coronary disease, and had a greater mean ejection fraction but had a similar peak VO2. There were 555 deaths (26%) and 194 (9%) transplants during a median follow-up of 3.5 years. Peak VO2 was a predictor of mortality irrespective of beta-blocker use; a decrease of 1 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1) resulted in an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.13 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.17, P<0.0001) in patients not receiving beta-blockers and 1.27 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.36, P<0.0001) in patients receiving beta-blockers. Similar findings were noted when considering death or transplantation as an end point. Beta-blocker use was associated with better outcomes until peak VO2 values became very low (approximately 10 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1)), at which level survival rates were equally poor.", 
    "62": "Peak VO2 is a determinant of survival in patients in heart failure even in the setting of beta-blockade. Because of improved survival in patients treated with beta-blockers, the cut point value of 14 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for referral for cardiac transplantation in these patients requires reevaluation, and a lower cut point may be more appropriate.", 
    "63": "A specific LC-MS/MS assay was developed for the automated determination of talinolol in human plasma, using on-line solid phase extraction system (prospekt 2) combined with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) tandem mass spectrometry. The method involved simple precipitation of plasma proteins with perchloric acid (contained propranolol) as the internal standard (IS) and injection of the supernatant onto a C8 End Capped (10 mmx2 mm) cartridge without any evaporation step. Using the back-flush mode, the analytes were transferred onto an analytical column (XTerra C18, 50 mmx4.6 mm) for chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry detection. One of the particularities of the assay is that the SPE cartridge is used as a column switching device and not as an SPE cartridge. Therefore, the same SPE cartridge could be used more than 28 times, significantly reducing the analysis cost. APCI ionization was selected to overcome any potential matrix suppression effects because the analyte and IS co-eluted. The mean precision and accuracy in the concentration range 2.5-200 ng/mL was found to be 103% and 7.4%, respectively. The data was assessed from QC samples during the validation phase of the assay. The lower limit of quantification was 2.5 ng/mL, using a 250 microL plasma aliquot. The LC-MS/MS method provided the requisite selectivity, sensitivity, robustness accuracy and precision to assess pharmacokinetics of the compound in several hundred human plasma samples.",

    "69": "The dietary supplement and adrenergic receptor agonist ephedrine has been a controversial topic as its safety has been questioned. Beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) activation causes immunomodulation, which may contribute to promotion of autoimmune pathology. This report investigated the ability of ephedrine to exacerbate processes associated with autoimmune disease in a lupus-prone mouse model. To mimic human supplementation, ephedrine was administered to NZM391 (lupus-prone) and BALB/c (nonlupus prone) mice orally twice a day for three months at a dose of 50 and 100 microg/day. Some ephedrine-treated NZM391 mice also were preadministered the beta-AR antagonist propranolol to investigate beta-AR involvement. Mice were bled monthly, and sera were assayed for a variety of lupus manifestations and immunological measurements. In NZM391 males and females, both doses of ephedrine significantly increased lupus manifestations, including IgG production and organ-directed autoantibody titers, and significantly lowered the ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 compared to controls. Ephedrine significantly decreased female lifespan and significantly increased circulating populations of plasma cells (CD38(hi) CD19(lo) cytoplasmic IgG+) and CD40+ B1a cells, while preventing an age-related decrease in the B1a cell population expressing a high level of CD5. While ephedrine induced gender-specific immunomodulation in BALB/c mice, increases in the lupus manifestations of anti-dsDNA titers and serum urea nitrogen were not detected. Preadministration of propranolol decreased lupus manifestations and serum levels of IgG and IgE in ephedrine-treated mice, but did not block the shift towards IgG1 production. These findings indicate that ephedrine via beta-AR can exacerbate lupus symptoms in NZM391 mice and that blockade of the beta-ARs on B cells, and not T cells, apparently was of greater importance as the inhibition of lupus symptoms corresponded to an inhibition of immunoglobulin levels, not a change of Th1/Th2 balance.",

The total number of drops in one bottle of each solution was counted drop by drop. The cost per drop was calculated by dividing the government-controlled standard prices by the total number of drops in one bottle. The annual cost of ophthalmic solution was calculated by multiplying the cost per drop by the number of drops typically used per day. The total number of drops of the ophthalmic solutions in one bottle ranged from 108 to 168. The yearly cost of the beta-adrenergic blockers studied ranged widely, from yen 5392 to yen 27236. Differences in the total number of drops and the usage effect on the annual cost of ophthalmic solutions were found.

The subjects consisted of 29 males and 11 females with a mean age of 63.5+/-10.1. Data on the plasma concentration of bisoprolol from 94 blood samples obtained at steady-state following repetitive oral administration were analyzed using the NONMEM program, where a one-compartment model with repetitive bolus dosing was parameterized in terms of oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F).

The objective of the study is to analyse the association between genetic variations in the beta1 or the beta2 adrenoreceptor (AR) gene and the effects of beta-blockade in patients with stable CHF. We studied 199 consecutive patients with stable CHF not treated with beta-blockers.

The beta1ARGly389Arg, beta1ARSer49Gly, beta2ARGly16Arg, beta2ARGln27Glu and beta2ARThr164Ile polymorphisms were determined: beta-blockade resulted in a significant decrease in heart rate, a significant increase in LVEF (from 30+/-10% to 40+/-13%, P<0.0001). There was no association between the five polymorphisms and heart rate or LVEF, either before or after beta-blockade. Heart rate and LVEF responses to beta-blockade were not associated with the beta1AR or the beta2AR polymorphisms. betaAR polymorphisms did not explain the interindividual variability in the response to beta-blockers.",

Such patients may be less responsive to positive inotropic agents, whereas the beneficial effects of nesiritide, which are not dependent on the beta-adrenergic receptor signal-transduction pathway, may be preserved. This analysis of the Vasodilation in the Management of Acute CHF trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of nesiritide in decompensated congestive heart failure patients receiving beta blockers. The Vasodilation in the Management of Acute CHF trial was a multicenter, randomized, controlled evaluation of nesiritide in 489 hospitalized patients with decompensated congestive heart failure. One hundred twenty-three patients were on chronic beta-blocker therapy at enrollment (31 randomized to placebo, 50 to nesiritide, and 42 to nitroglycerin). Primary end points included pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and dyspnea evaluation at 3 hours. Patients receiving nesiritide, but not IV nitroglycerin, had significantly reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure vs. placebo at 3 hours regardless of beta-blocker use. The use of beta blockers did not alter the beneficial effects of nesiritide on systemic blood pressure, heart rate, or dyspnea evaluation. In nesiritide-treated subjects, safety profiles were similar regardless of beta-blocker use. Thus, the clinical and hemodynamic benefits and safety of nesiritide are preserved in decompensated congestive heart failure patients receiving chronic beta blockade.",

In this study it was found that, in the cell-free system, carvedilol dose-dependently decreased chemiluminescence in the following ranking order of radicals: hydroxyl radical > hydrogen peroxide > superoxide radical. The inhibition of myeloperoxidase was significant with carvedilol concentrations of 10 and 100 micromol/l and manifested in the concentration-dependent shift of chemiluminescence peaks to the right. In whole blood, carvedilol in concentrations of 10 and 100 micromol/l significantly inhibited chemiluminescence induced by both receptor-bypassing stimuli (A23187, PMA) and receptor-operating stimuli (fMLP, OpZ). Carvedilol dose-dependently inhibited chemiluminescence of isolated human polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the ranking order of stimuli: A23187 > OpZ > fMLP. In the presence of blood platelets, carvedilol did not substantially change chemiluminescence induced by fMLP and OpZ, while it was much more effective on chemiluminescence stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187. This could be the result of the supportive effect of serotonin liberated from platelets by A23187.",

Tissue distribution was assessed at steady state by infusing cassette doses of beta-blockers into the jugular vein via an indwelling catheter at a constant rate. Blood was sampled via an indwelling catheter in the carotid artery, and 12 tissues excised at the end of dose infusion (4 or 8 h). Drug concentrations were quantified using a novel chiral LC-MS method and the tissue-to-plasma (Kp) and tissue-to-plasma water (Kpu) values were calculated for each tissue. Differences between Kp were observed between many enantiomeric pairs, and largely explained by enantiomeric differences in plasma protein binding. Across compounds, Kpu values were generally highest in lung and lowest in adipose, and were higher for the more lipophilic drugs betaxolol and propranolol. For any tissue, Kpu differences between the individual beta-blockers correlated well with the corresponding affinity for blood cells. For all compounds, regional tissue distribution correlated well with tissue acidic phospholipid concentrations, with phosphatidylserine appearing to have the strongest influence. This information may be used as the basis for predicting the tissue distribution of basic drugs.", 
    "90": "Lowering elevated blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of stroke, but whether any specific type of antihypertensive medication is better for this purpose, independent of blood pressure-lowering effects, is controversial. Compared with placebo or no treatment, the point estimate for stroke reduction is the largest with calcium antagonists; all such studies used dihydropyridine compounds. When all clinical trials published through December 2004 are combined in meta-analysis, stroke is not significantly reduced when an initial dihydropyridine or nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist is compared with an initial diuretic or beta blocker, but when the two subclasses are combined, stroke reduction (9%) is significant. The risk of heart failure, however, is significantly increased (by 29%) with the initial calcium antagonist. These estimates may change as newer trials are reported.", 
    "91": "Recent studies in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have benefits beyond blood pressure reduction alone. Increased arterial stiffness, itself an emerging risk factor for CAD, adversely influences ventricular vascular interaction, leading to an increased central aortic pulse pressure. A number of recent studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between central pulse pressure and angiographic CAD. Furthermore, aortic stiffness also correlates with CAD. These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that central aortic stiffness may promote the development of CAD and that therapeutic intervention targeted at reducing arterial stiffness may be of benefit in patients with CAD. The ACE inhibitor, perindopril, has been shown to decrease arterial stiffness, largely independently of any effect on peripheral blood pressure. Results of the recent REASON study demonstrate that perindopril, in combination with indapamide, reduces central systolic and pulse pressure to a greater degree than the beta-blocker atenolol and that this effect is due to improved arterial stiffness and decreased wave reflection. In addition to its other beneficial effects, such as improved endothelial function and decreased inflammation, these haemodynamic effects of perindopril may therefore have contributed to the decrease in cardiovascular events seen in patients in the EUROPA study. Overall, perindopril, in addition to lowering peripheral blood pressure, decreases arterial stiffness and central pulse pressure. In individuals with CAD, perindopril would thus appear to be a very reasonable choice.",

Bimatoprost reduced intraocular pressure (IOP) 4.5 mm Hg (21.5%; P < .001) from baseline at week 6 and 4.2 mm Hg (19.6%; P < .001) at week 12. Patients were more likely to achieve low target pressures with bimatoprost than with topical beta-blockers. Conjunctival hyperemia was the most commonly reported adverse event. The findings from this study indicate bimatoprost monotherapy provides a substantially greater IOP reduction than topical beta-blocker therapy and allows more patients to achieve a low target pressure.

It is triggered by many conditions such as thyroid dysfunction, cardiac disease, alcohol, and pulmonary disease. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are susceptible to many insults that can lead to an acute deterioration superimposed on chronic disease. Changes in blood gases, abnormalities in pulmonary functions, and hemodynamic changes resulting from pulmonary hypertension can lead to the development of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation and COPD frequently coexist and complicate treatment of both conditions. The treatment of COPD exacerbation may include beta-adrenergic agonist and theophylline, which can precipitate atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Pharmacologic and electrical cardioversion may be ineffective in the management of atrial fibrillation in patients with COPD until respiratory decompensation has been corrected. This article focuses on the management of atrial fibrillation in patients with COPD.",

    "107": "Thirty-seven patients (28 men, nine women) underwent unenhanced helical CT and MDCT angiography of the coronary arteries. After patients received oral beta-blocker medication, CT scans were obtained during a single breath-hold with a 16-MDCT scanner using ECG-gating (0.75-mm collimation, 2.8-mm table feed/rotation, 0.42-sec rotation time). The image quality was assessed in terms of artifacts and segment visibility by two reviewers. Stenosis severity was compared with the results of conventional invasive coronary angiography.", 
    "108": "The data evaluation of the image quality was based on a total of 488 segments, of which 380 segments were considered to have diagnostic image quality. One hundred eight segments (22.1%) could not be sufficiently evaluated because of severe calcifications (35 segments) and motion artifacts (73 segments). The mean calcium score (Agatston score equivalent [ASE]) was 524.3 +/- 807.6. Twenty-eight (75.7%) of the 37 patients had an ASE of less than 1,000 (mean ASE, 90.8 +/- 152.3 [SD]), and nine (24.3%) patients had an ASE of 1,000 or greater (mean ASE, 1,761.0 +/- 637.6). For detecting lesions 50% or greater (without any exclusion criteria), the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 59%, 87%, 61%, and 87%, respectively. When limiting the number of patients to those with a calcium score of less than 1,000 ASE, the threshold-corrected sensitivity for lesions 50% or greater was 93%; specificity, 94%; positive predictive value, 68%; and negative predictive value, 99%.",

    "110": "To understand how nicotinic cholinergic receptors may participate in epileptic seizures, we tested the effects of nicotine and of the competitive nicotinic antagonists dihydro-beta-erythroidine and alpha-bungarotoxin on synaptic paroxysmal depolarization shifts (PDSs) and intrinsic bursts of action potentials recorded in slices from rats presenting a cortical status epilepticus. This model named GABA-withdrawal syndrome (GWS) appears consecutive to the interruption of a prolonged intracortical GABA infusion. Effects of both nicotinic antagonists suggest a distinct involvement of alpha4-beta2 and alpha7 subunits in shaping individual PDSs and patterning repetitive bursts. On one hand, in GWS rats, an increase of PDS latency and prolongation of PDS and bursts were induced by nicotine and reduced by dihydro-beta-erythroidine, but not by alpha-bungarotoxin. The K+ blocker tetraethylammonium also increased duration without changing latency. Thus, dihydro-beta-erythroidine-sensitive receptors exert distinct controls on the presynaptic generation of PDS and on the process which terminates PDSs and bursts. On the other hand, alpha-bungarotoxin depolarized neurons and generated rhythmic discharges of clustered bursts. Clustered bursts were also observed in slices obtained from GWS rats treated with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor eserine. We suggest that both dihydro-beta-erythroidine and alpha-bungarotoxin-sensitive sites control paroxysmic activities in GWS and could be involved in some human and animal epilepsies presenting mutations of nicotinic cholinergic receptors.",

Interaction between beta(2)AR and proinflamatory cytokines in airway smooth muscle has been revealed. Being located on proinflamatory cells, beta(2)ARs may influence function of these cells in vivo. It was clear established, that stimulation of beta(2)AR inhibits release of proinflamatory mediators from mast cells, influences T-cell growth and function, eosinophil survival and function, including GM-CSF- or PAF-induced degranulation. Stimulation of beta(2)ARs, located on alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, has ambiguity influence on their regulation and function, including phagocytosis and mediator secretion, in vivo. Vascular responses, resulting in inhibition of plasma exudation were confirmed, but modulation of sensory nerves via beta(2)AR is not certain yet. beta(2)AR-agonists are effective in treatment of immediate allergic reactions, but desensitisation of beta(2)ARs on inflammatory cells may result in paradoxical effects, especially in asthma. In summary, it is clear that beta(2)ARs may play an anti-inflammatory role in vitro. Unfortunately, in vitro data have shown limited applicability in vivo; therefore further research in this field is required.", 
    "121": "The cellular role of mitochondria includes ATP generation and the modulation of cytosolic calcium signals, besides being the \"crossroads\" for several cell death pathways. The maintenance of optimal mitochondrial functioning during the disease process increases the chances for survival. For example, ischaemia followed by reperfusion is known to negatively affect mitochondrial function, namely by inducing a deleterious condition called mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). The MPT is responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction and can ultimately lead to cell death. Therefore, it seems important to protect mitochondrial function in cardiac disease. Carvedilol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with antioxidant properties, has a positive impact on cardiac mitochondria during in vitro, ex-vivo and in vivo models of cardiac dysfunction. Particularly, carvedilol was shown to inhibit MPT in isolated heart mitochondria and protect mitochondria against the oxidative damage induced by the xanthine oxidase/hypoxanthine pro-oxidant system. The observation that carvedilol acts as an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex-I is also of importance, since this mitochondrial system was proposed as cause of the cardiotoxicity associated with the anti-neoplasic drug doxorubicin. This review points out the major findings concerning the positive impact of carvedilol on mitochondrial function and its use in the treatment of myocardial diseases where oxidative stress is known to be involved.",

Although most classes of antihypertensive agents play a role in risk reduction, none offers blanket reductions for all adverse events. The beta-blockers, while the agents of choice for those with ischemic heart disease and for disease states requiring reducing heart rate, are inappropriate first-line therapies in patients whose primary concern is stroke risk reduction. In patients who require heart rate-lowering therapy but who cannot tolerate beta-blockers, long-acting nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists offer the benefits of heart rate reduction, as well as the vasodilation that is characteristic of the calcium antagonists as a class.

It has long been established that patients are at higher risk for cardiovascular events-including myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death-in the early morning hours. Using novel oral delivery methods, chronotherapeutic medication synchronizes the delivery of blood pressure drug within the period of rates risk, significantly reducing both absolute blood pressure numbers and, especially important, the rate of blood pressure increase. These therapies have also shown the ability to maintain adequate blood pressure levels during the trough period. Several blood pressure medications now have chronotherapeutic formulations including the calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem and the beta-blocker propranolol.", 
    "146": "Heart failure is characterized by limited exercise tolerance and by a skeletal muscle myopathy with atrophy and shift toward fast fibres. An inflammatory status with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and exaggerated free radicals production, can worsen muscle damage. In a well established model of heart failure, the monocrotaline treated rat, we show that CHF is accompanied by oxidation of the skeletal muscle actin, tropomyosin and myosin, which further depresses muscle function and exercise capacity. We have also tested the efficacy of Carvedilol, a non-selective beta(1)-beta(2)-blocker, which has been widely used in clinical trials to improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality in moderate and severe CHF, in preventing contractile protein oxidation in CHF rats. As comparison we used Bisoprolol a beta(1) selective agent, without known anti-oxidative properties. Carvedilol at the dose of 2 mg/kg per day was able to prevent the myofibrillar protein oxidation, while Bisoprolol (0.1 mg/kg) did it only partially, as demonstrated by the oxyblot analysis. While Carvedilol improved force production on isolated muscles, Bisoprolol did not. After the COMET trial, the anti-oxidative capacity of Carvedilol has been invoked as one of the mechanism that makes this drug superior to other selective beta-blockers in the treatment of CHF. One of the reason of Carvedilol superiority could be the effect on skeletal muscle with reduction of contractile protein peroxidation, amelioration of muscle function and improvement of exercise tolerance. Inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and of pro-inflammatory cytokines may also lead to a decreased muscle wastage, another factor contributing to worsening of exercise tolerance.",

Significant and comparable reductions in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, body weight, heart rate, and HDL-cholesterol were recorded in both patient groups. The LDL-cholesterol concentration increased significantly in propranolol compared with both baseline and atenolol period. Serum triglycerides increased significantly with both medications. The number of circulating platelet aggregates decreased significantly with propranolol (0.99-/+0.19) in comparison with both atenolol (1.41-/+0.70; P=0.004, Wilcoxon matched pairs test) and baseline (1.59-/+0.94; P=0.002, Wilcoxon matched pairs test).",

Despite reperfusion therapy, intraaortic balloon pumping, antiarrhythmic drugs and beta-blocker, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation relapsed and cardioversion was performed 29 times during 32 h. Temporary overdrive atrioventricular sequential pacing was initiated and the malignant arrhythmia finally disappeared. Even after stoppage of 25 h overdride pacing, it never recurred. Temporary overdrive pacing is an easy and feasible therapy for a drug-resistant electrical storm associated with AMI and should be performed in the early stage.",

ISO significantly elevated left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure, decreased peak-negative dP/dt and LV ejection fraction. BB and ARB similarly ameliorated cardiac dysfunction due to ISO, but BB+ARB were more potent than the individual therapies. Separately, ARB preserved the histological structure in LV myocardium. In contrast, BB ameliorated calcium handling, as shown by the increased ratio of SERCA2 to phospholamban protein, despite having little effect on the histology.",

The study included 50 patients who developed arterial hypertension after LT. The data on the first 30 patients who have completed 12-month follow-up are reported herein. Eighteen patients received nifedipine, and 12 patients received carvedilol. Patients were evaluated monthly at the outpatient clinic for 1 year. If patients developed severe adverse effects to nifedipine, they were switched to carvedilol and vice versa (therapy failure). The two groups were similar for clinical features, indications for LT, immunosuppressive therapy, and baseline blood pressures. A failure of treatment was observed in 9 of 18 patients treated with nifedipine (50.0%) and one of 12 patients treated with carvedilol (8%, P < .025). Nifedipine was effective in 4 of 18 patients, carvedilol, in 4 of 12 patients (22.21% vs 33.3%, P = NS). Two of the nine nonresponders to nifedipine responded to carvedilol.

For such drugs, the bioavailability is influenced by the time of administration. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in the pharmacokinetic patterns between a pulsatile drug delivery system using a pulsatile capsule, an immediate release tablet and a controlled release tablet. Metoprolol was chosen as a model drug because of its high solubility and high permeability pattern throughout the GI tract. The dosage forms were administered to four dogs and the plasma levels were measured using LC-MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for each dosage form. Fluctuations in the plasma time curves over the observation period indicated that physiological factors like motility have an influence on the drug absorption. The comparison of the plasma time curves of the dosage forms showed that each dosage form caused significant differences in the drug plasma levels. The pulsatile drug delivery capsule caused two defined C(max) values for each dose between 1-1.75 and 2.5-3.5h. Implications for the use of a pulsatile drug delivery device for chronopharmacotherapy are discussed. Pulsatile drug delivery offers a promising way for chronopharmacotherapy if the time of administration and pulse time are adjusted to the circadian pattern.",

In the most recent trial, participants with mild OAG, progressive visual field (VF) loss, after adjustment for cataract surgery, was not significantly different for medications compared to trabeculectomy (Odds ratio (OR) 0.74; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.01). Reduction of vision, with a higher risk of developing cataract (OR 2.69, 95%% CI 1.64 to 4.42), and more patient discomfort was more likely with trabeculectomy than medication. There is some evidence, from three trials, for people with moderately advanced glaucoma that medication is associated with more progressive VF loss and 6 to 8 mmHg less intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering than surgery, either by a Scheie's procedure or trabeculectomy. There was a trend towards an increased risk of failed IOP control over time for initial pilocarpine treatment compared to trabeculectomy. In the longer-term (two trials) the risk of failure was significantly greater with medication than trabeculectomy (OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.60 to 9.53; HR 7.27, 95% CI 2.23 to 25.71). Medicine and surgery have evolved since these trials were undertaken, and additionally the evidence is potentially subject to detection and attrition bias.",

Reduced vision, cataract and eye discomfort are more likely with trabeculectomy. There is some evidence, for more severe OAG, that initial medication (pilocarpine, now rarely used as first line medication) is associated with greater VF deterioration than surgery. In general, surgery lowers IOP more than medication. There was no evidence to determine the effectiveness of contemporary medication (prostaglandin analogues, alpha2-agonists and topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) compared to surgery in severe OAG, and in people of black African ethnic origin who have a greater risk of more severe open angle glaucoma.

All patients in the database who had AKA or BKA from 1990 to May 2001 were included in the study. Perioperative 30-day cardiac morbidity and mortality and 3-yr and 10-yr mortality after AKA or BKA were assessed. The effect of DM on 30-day cardiac outcome was assessed by multivariate logistic regression and the effect on long-term survival was assessed by Cox regression analysis. The perioperative cardiac event rate (cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) was at least 6.8% after AKA and at most 3.6% after BKA. Median survival was significantly less after AKA (20 mo) than BKA (52 mo) (P < 0.001). DM was not a significant predictor of perioperative 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.76 [0.39-1.49]; P = 0.43) or 3-yr survival (Hazard ratio, 1.03 [0.86-1.24]; P = 0.72) but predicted 10-yr mortality (Hazard ratio, 1.34 [1.04-1.73]; P = 0.026).

Actual mobilities were derived from the dependence of the effective mobilities of the analytes on the pH of the methanolic background electrolyte solution (pH(MeOH)). The pKa values of the pharmaceuticals in methanol (pK(a,MeOH)) were calculated by non-linear curve fitting to the measured mobility values. It was found that the shift in pKa value (when compounds were transferred from water to methanol) increased with the acidity of the analyte. The average pKa shift for compounds exhibiting acidic properties in water was ca. 5.5 units, and the shift for basic compounds about 2 units. As was shown for a mixture of beta-blockers, the calculated actual mobilities and pKa values can be utilised in the optimisation of pH conditions for separation. The practical value of the method was illustrated by the analysis of urine samples.",

Twelve months after beta-blocker initiation, LV ejection fraction (EF) increased by > or = 5% in 75% of patients, whereas EF failed to increase by 5% or decreased in the remaining 25%. Over the subsequent 32 months, LVEF increased further in patients who had experienced an initial EF increase by > or = 5%, whereas EF tended to further decrease in patients who had experienced an initial EF increase of <5% or a decrease. Thus, the benefits of carvedilol or metoprolol on LV function are long lasting in patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy who are free of events susceptible to alter LV function while receiving beta blockade.", 
    "191": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a rare arrhythmogenic disease characterized by exercise- or stress-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias, syncope, or sudden death, usually in the pediatric age group. Familial occurrence has been noted in about 30% of cases. Inheritance can be autosomal dominant or recessive, usually with high penetrance. The causative genes have been mapped to chromosome 1. Mutations of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RyR2) have been identified in autosomal dominant pedigrees, while calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) mutations are seen in recessive cases. Ankyrin-B mutations may also be implicated in catecholaminergic polymorphic VT: mutations in this gene were previously linked to the long-QT 4 phenotype. Ventricular ectopy, bidirectional VT, and polymorphic VT occur in a predictable and progressive manner with increasing heart rate during exercise or isoproterenol infusion. Estimated mortality of untreated cases ranges from 30% to 50% before the age of 20-30 years according to family studies. Although beta-blocker therapy was considered to be effective in preventing clinical recurrence in the initial series, recent data show low efficacy. As there is a chance for sudden cardiac death if even a single dose of beta-blocker is missed, there is a trend toward implantation of defibrillators in more and more patients.",

Dobutamine (0.3-100 microM) produced a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect which was not affected by 50 nM (+/-)-1-(2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy)-3-((1-methylethyl)amino)-2-butanol hydrochloride (ICI 118551), a beta2-receptor antagonist, but was virtually abolished by 0.3 microM (+/-)-2-hydroxy-5-(2-((2-hydroxy-3-(4-(1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-l)phenoxy)propyl)amino)ethoxy)-benzamide methanesulfonate (CGP 20712A), a beta1-receptor antagonist. Glucagon (0.01-1 microM) also enhanced the contractility of the preparation in a concentration-dependent way. Selective inhibitors of PDE 1 8-methoxymethyl-3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine (MIMX, 1 muM), PDE 2 erythro-9-[2-hydroxy-3-nonyl]adenine (EHNA, 1 microM) and PDE 3 cilostamide (0.1 microM) did not affect basal contractility. Cilostamide increased the positive inotropic effects of glucagon but not those of dobutamine. MIMX and EHNA did not alter the effects of either dobutamine or glucagon. Dobutamine (3 microM), but not glucagon (0.1 microM), increased tissue levels of cAMP. 1 microM of MIMX or EHNA were devoid of effects and failed to alter the effects of dobutamine and glucagon on cAMP. Cilostamide (0.1 microM) did not increase the effects of dobutamine but caused glucagon to enhance cAMP. The pharmacological and biochemical data presented in this study can be explained quantitatively by a cell compartment model in which PDE 3 appears to be colocalized with the contractile machinery responsible for the effects of glucagon but not those of dobutamine. Neither PDE 1 nor PDE 2 appears to regulate the inotropic effects of dobutamine and glucagon in rat ventricular myocardium.",

A heterogenic response to stimulation, inversely related to the extent of cell shortening prior to adrenergic stimulation, was observed. Challenge of cardiac myocytes with a selective beta1-antagonist, atenolol (10(-7) M), suggests the heterogenic response is not caused by basal beta1-adrenoceptor activity. Thus, basal myocyte contractility determines the response to beta1-adrenoceptor stimulation, this should be taken into account when experimental conditions are designed.",

In this functional urethral constriction model, both TAK-802 at 1 and 10 microg/kg and tamsulosin at 3 and 10 microg/kg (intravenously) caused increasing effects on the Qmax and voiding efficiency. The effects were more apparent with combined exposure. Although the Pvesmax was dose-dependently increased by TAK-802 alone, the effects were completely abolished by concomitant treatment with tamsulosin.",

That TAK-802 increased Pves when administered alone implies that monotherapy using an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be withheld in patients with voiding dysfunction caused by obvious bladder outlet obstruction with benign prostatic hyperplasia, to avoid disorders of the upper urinary tracts, and it should be used with an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist.
