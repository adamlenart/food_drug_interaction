Isoprenaline, a beta-adrenergic full agonist, and carteolol, befunolol and BFE-55, beta-adrenergic blockers with an intrinsic sympathomimetic action, induced dose-related increases in heart rate when administered intravenously (i.v.). 2. The beta-partial agonists administered i.v. shifted a dose-heart rate increased response curve of isoprenaline, suggesting a competitive antagonism. 3. In carteolol, doses to block beta-adrenoceptors were found to be 400-1000 times lower than that to induce agonistic action. In BFE-55, doses to block beta-adrenoceptors were equal to that to induce sympathomimetic action. The difference between doses of the befunolol to produce both actions was intermediate. 4. These results suggest that there may be a difference between doses blocking beta-adrenoceptors and inducing sympathomimetic action in some beta-adrenergic partial agonists and, therefore, that there may exist beta-partial agonists which do not induce sympathomimetic action in doses blocking beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "1": "Minoxidil and other potent vasodilators cause coronary arterial injury, right atrial hemorrhagic lesions, and subendocardial necrosis in dogs. This paper discusses the pathogenesis of coronary arterial and right atrial lesions associated with minoxidil in the dog. Acute coronary vascular injury characterized by segmental medial hemorrhage and necrosis and perivascular inflammation occurred only during the first few days of treatment, after which tolerance to further acute injury developed. At 30 d or more of treatment, coronary vascular injury was characterized by perivascular fibrosis rarely attended by medial distortion or hyperplasia and subintimal thickening, changes consistent with responses to previous injury. Right atrial hemorrhagic lesions, unlike coronary vascular injury, often became progressively more extensive with continued treatment. At 3 d, atrial hemorrhage and inflammation were confined to the subepicardium of the right atrium, evidently around affected subepicardial branches of the right coronary artery. At 30 d, fibrovascular proliferative right atrial lesions (granulation tissue with evidence of continual hemorrhage) extended from the epicardium to the myocardium, with eventual replacement of the atrial wall by mature connective tissue at 1 yr of treatment. Minoxidil-induced cardiovascular lesions were not prevented by treatment with a beta-blocker (propranolol), or an alpha-blocker (dibenzylene), or by sympathetic neural activity suppression (surgical sympathectomy or constant carotid sinus nerve stimulation), suggesting that the sympathetic response to the pharmacologic activity of minoxidil was not responsible for the induction of the cardiovascular lesions. Minoxidil-related vascular lesions were confined to the most pharmacologically responsive segment of the arterial system, the coronary arteries, suggesting that medial injury may have been associated with tensile changes in the arterial wall.", 
    "2": "1. To evaluate the influence of beta-blockers and minor tranquilizers on autonomous stress response, 40 healthy subjects selected with regard to personality traits were randomly assigned to 5 groups. 2. Mental arithmetic induced the most pronounced increase in heart rate (HR), blood pressure and epinephrine secretion. 3. Beta-blockers reduced HR increases due to mental stress, whereas the minor tranquilizer reduced skin conductance level throughout the whole trial. 4. Our data provide evidence that different structured situations induce specific response patterns that are differentially modified by beta-blockers and minor tranquilizer.", 
    "3": "The influence of various beta-blockers on tear production in rabbits was studied by means of direct cannulation of the lacrimal gland excretory duct. Tear production was significantly decreased (p less than 0,001) after systemic (I.M.) administration of either selective beta 1-blockers (metoprolol, betaxolol), B2-selective (butoxamine) or non-selective ones (timolol, propranolol) or finally those with I.S.A. (oxprenolol), although differences in the size of tear production decreasing response of each beta-blocker were recorded. Bilateral topical application of timolol (50 microliters of 0,5% b.i.d. for three days), decreased also tear production significantly, while the response of betaxolol administered under the same regime was rather negligible. It is concluded that although beta 2 adrenergic receptors are mainly involved in tear production, the administration of selective beta 1-blockers in high doses disappears their selectivity, decreasing tear production too.", 
    "4": "1. The beta adrenergic agonists isoproterenol and epinephrine stimulated in vitro lipolysis in adipose tissue removed from heifers 30 days pre- and 120 days postpartum. 2. Propranolol, a beta antagonist, blocked isoproterenol stimulated lipolysis pre- and postpartum. 3. Epinephrine co-incubated with propranolol resulted in a suppression of lipolysis similar to that produced by clonidine, an alpha agonist, both pre- and postpartum. 4. Bovine adipose tissue lipolysis was more responsive to isoproterenol and isoproterenol + propranolol at 120 days of lactation than 30 days prepartum. 5. Adipose tissue sensitivity to clonidine, epinephrine and epinephrine + propranolol did not differ 30 days pre- and 120 days postpartum.", 
    "5": "The effects of 5 and 10 mg bisoprolol once daily for 7 days on exercise ECG, myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function in 25 patients with stable coronary heart disease have been assessed in a double-blind, randomized, parallel group trial design. ST-segment depression during exercise was reduced by 56% by 5 mg bisoprolol and by 64% after 10 mg; the difference between the dose levels was significant. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the rate-pressure product were reduced to similar extent both at rest and during exercise by both doses. Left ventricular thallium-201 scintigrams indicated a significant reduction in myocardial perfusion defects after 10 mg bisoprolol compared to baseline; however, the difference between the two active treatments was not significant. Left atrial and left ventricular diameters obtained by one-dimensional echocardiography, and the calculated shortening fraction, remained unchanged after bisoprolol, and so gave no evidence of a negative inotropic action. It is concluded that 5 mg bisoprolol was effective in once-a-day treatment of angina pectoris due to coronary heart disease, and a further improvement can be expected on increasing the dose to 10 mg.", 
    "6": "Twenty Nigerians with labile essential hypertension (LEH) were asked to record their blood pressure and pulse rate for 14-16 hours using the Remler Portable Ambulatory Blood Pressure Recorder while exposing themselves to the stress of Lagos traffic. The average blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate for the test day (ASBP, ADBP and APR) were determined in a cross-over randomised open design before (C), after one week on placebo bidaily (P1), after one week on bromazepam 1.5 mg bidaily (B), after one week on placebo bidaily (P2) and after one week on labetalol 100 mg bidaily (L). Allocation to the active drugs was randomised. All drugs were administered at 8.00a.m. and 8.00p.m. respectively. The maximum blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate MxSBP, MxDBP and MxPR were similarly determined. Both B and L significantly reduced ASBP, ADBP, APR, MxSBP, MxDBP and MxPR but L produced a much greater reduction in the above parameters than B. Side effects observed included drowsiness with B (two subjects) and postural dizziness with L (one subject). Both drugs were effective in controlling LEH but L was more effective than B in reducing stress hypertension.", 
    "7": "Assessment of the functional significance of B2-receptors in the human heart is possible by employing combinations of B-receptor agonists and antagonists or by endogenous cardiac B-receptor stimulation combined with different B-receptor antagonists. A number of studies have shown that positive chronotropic responses indeed can be mediated by B2-receptors both in vitro and in intact humans. Regarding inotropic responses, tissue bath data in isolated human myocardium indicates that B2-receptors are coupled to a positive inotropic response. Our studies in healthy humans using the P/V ratio as an index of myocardial contractility show that B2-receptor stimulation can cause an inotropic response but less than the chronotropic response. Results obtained with B-receptor stimulation by increased cardiac sympathetic nerve activity versus B-receptor stimulation by exogenously administered agonists support the concept that the cardiac B1-receptor subpopulation may represent the \"innervated\" B-receptor linked to the synaptic cleft whereas the cardiac B2-receptor subpopulation may represent the \"humoral\" B-receptor associated with part of the cell in close contact with the circulation.", 
    "8": "During the past 5 years it has been clearly established that there is a prominent morning increase in the frequency of onset of acute myocardial infarction. Similar increases have also been observed for the related conditions of sudden cardiac death, stroke and episodes of transient myocardial ischemia. The period from 6 a.m. to noon is also a time when a number of physiologic processes that could contribute to the onset of coronary thrombosis are intensified. Arterial pressure, which could lead to plaque rupture, rises; coronary tone increases; and platelet aggregability, which could contribute to a hypercoagulable state, increases. The immediate significance of these observations is the emphasis that should be placed on pharmacologic protection of patients during the morning hours. The primary longer-term significance of the recognition of the morning increase of onset of acute cardiovascular disease is the contribution it makes to the concept that onset of coronary thrombosis at any time of the day is frequently triggered by the activities of the patient. Investigation of this possibility may yield more information about the mechanism of disease onset and facilitate design of more effective preventive therapy.", 
    "9": "Unstable angina is an acute coronary syndrome characterized by the rapid progression of clinical symptoms which may culminate in acute myocardial infarction, infarct extension or sudden death. The pathologic substrate involves atherosclerotic plaque rupture with platelet deposition, thrombus formation and coronary arterial spasm. Patients with postinfarction angina represent a high-risk subgroup with severe multivessel disease, compromised collateral vessels and/or partially occlusive thrombi; their risk of infarct extension and death is significantly increased. Initial therapy includes nitrates, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel antagonists, aspirin and possibly i.v. heparin, as well as prompt identification and control of exacerbating factors. Thrombolytic therapy may assume a more central role based on its ability to achieve rapid clinical stabilization. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting may be used emergently in patients refractory to medical therapy, or electively when clinically indicated.", 
    "10": "The clinical effects of early intravenous beta-blockade followed by short-term oral treatment in acute myocardial infarction (MI) have been studied in 30 randomized trials totaling almost 28,000 patients. This treatment reduces the incidence of infarction by 10-15% in patients with threatened MI, reduces infarct size by 20-30%; reduces the incidence of nonfatal reinfarction, nonfatal cardiac arrest and mortality each by about 15%. Treatment has to start within 12 h of the onset of symptoms to be able to reduce measures of infarct size and infarct development. If patients are carefully selected serious side effects are rare and reversible. Based on the different presumed mechanisms of benefit it would be reasonable to expect the combination of i.v. beta-blockade and other therapies of proven benefit to be more beneficial than either class of agent used alone.", 
    "11": "As part of an ongoing community-wide study of time trends in the incidence and case-fatality rates of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (MI) in 16 Worcester, Mass., metropolitan hospitals during the calendar years 1975, 1978, 1981, and 1984, changes over time in the therapeutic management of 3,263 patients with validated acute MI were examined. Beta-blocker and nitrate therapy use increased consistently and dramatically. Use of antiplatelet agents was inconsistent, while use of digoxin remained stable. Use of antiarrhythmic medications other than lidocaine decreased consistently while lidocaine use increased between 1975 and 1978 and then leveled off to being used in approximately 45% of hospitalized patients with acute MI in 1981 and 1984. A variety of demographic (e.g. age, sex, teaching hospital) and clinical characteristics (e.g. MI order, MI type, MI location, peak CPK findings, occurrence of acute clinical complications) were also associated with the use of these therapies. The results of this community-wide study suggest changes over time in the therapeutic management of patients hospitalized with acute MI and of various patient demographic and clinical factors associated with the use of these agents.", 
    "12": "By means of M-type electrocardiography the anapriline (propranolol--40 mg) and nitrosorbide (isosorbide dinitrate--10 mg) action on the left ventricular diastolic function was studied in the conditions of acute experiment in 55 patients with stable stenocardia. It was established that anapriline lengthens the diastole (at the expense of diastasis), decreases the myocardial relaxation speed and the fast filling and causes an increase of the telediastolic volume. Nitrosorbide decreases the filling velocity in the three diastolic phases without changing its duration and leads to a decrease of the telediastolic volume. In the combination of the two drugs anaprilin acts mainly on the duration, volume and speed indices of the left ventricular diastolic function while nitrosorbide acts mainly on the venous flow towards the heart and reduces the unfavourable action of anapriline on myocardial relaxation.", 
    "13": "The hypothesis that in hypoglycaemia adrenoceptor-blocking drugs may enhance those metabolic effects of the catecholamines that remain unblocked has been investigated in 12 volunteers. alpha-Adrenoceptor blockade with urapidil increased the heart rate and the plasma noradrenaline level, and increased the beta-adrenoceptor mediated cellular uptake of potassium and phosphate, and the production of lactate. Posthypoglycaemic glucose intolerance and the counterregulatory responses of hGH and cortisol remained unchanged. Plasma adrenaline, the alpha-adrenoceptor mediated responses of cortisol and hGH, and the diastolic blood pressure were increased by propranolol. Adrenoceptor blocking drugs produce an indirect stimulatory effect by eliciting a reflex increase in sympathetic tone, which is manifested as stimulation of receptors of the type that has not been blocked.", 
    "14": "The effects on renal hemodynamics and salt-water handling of equipotent doses of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol (M, 100 mg) and of the non-selective (intrinsic sympathetic activity) beta-antagonist pindolol (P, 10 mg) were compared in 30 WHO Grade 1-2 hypertensive men. M lowered pulse rate more than P. Systolic pressure was equally reduced by both agents, and diastolic and mean pressures were decreased only after P. Glomerular filtration rate was not significantly altered by either antagonist, and renal blood flow decreased by approximately 11% both after M and P. Renal vascular resistance was unchanged after P, and was increased by 10% after M. It is concluded that, like the effects on central haemodynamics, ISA is more important in the renal response to beta-adrenoceptor blockade than is beta-receptor selectivity.", 
    "15": "The effects of beta-blockade on the responses of oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR) and blood lactate (La-) were examined during ramp cycle ergometer tests (50 W.min-1 ramp slope) in 8 healthy male volunteers. Each subject took placebo, or one of four different doses of three different beta-blockers (propranolol, metoprolol or oxprenolol) 2 h prior to each test for a total of 15 exercise tests. VO2 was measured breath-by-breath, HR was sampled once per breath, and La- was obtained every minute. Linear regression analysis was applied to VO2 and HR data to obtain the kinetic parameter total lag time (TLT) and a slope value. La- was analyzed by a continuous exponential model with the lactate slope index (LSI) being derived from the individual response curves. Submaximal exercise HR was significantly depressed at the baseline as well as during the ramp tests by beta-blockade. TLT for HR was significantly affected by beta-blockade, with a dose dependent shift from a placebo value of 16 to 26 s with placebo to a value of -40 to -60 s at the highest dose. Slope of HR was significantly depressed relative to placebo. VO2 kinetics assessed by TLT were not significantly affected by beta-blockade. This slope of the VO2 vs work rate relationship was significantly less than placebo only at the highest dose of beta-blocker. The LSI was not significantly affected by beta-blockade. In contrast with the clear impairment of HR response to exercise during beta-blockade, both the VO2 and La- responses appear to be relatively unaffected by beta-blockade during ramp exercise tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "The selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 induces amnesia in the domestic chick when given systemically, 10 min after a one-trial PAL task. Young chicks will spontaneously peck at a small bright bead. If the bead has been coated with a distasteful substance, the chicks will learn in a single trial not to peck at a similar bead on subsequent presentation. Administration of ICI 118,551 prevented retention of this task. Vehicle-injected chicks which learnt the task, avoided a similar bead to the training bead in the retention test, but did not avoid a bead of a different colour. The effect of ICI 118,551 is unlikely to be a direct effect on performance since amnesic chicks pecked both beads freely and equally in the test.", 
    "17": "Yohimbine (2.5 or 4 mg/kg) reduced the percentage of open arm entries and the percentage of time spent on the open arms displayed by rats on an elevated plus-maze indicating anxiogenic activity. These effects were reversed by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (0.01 mg/kg) and by the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine (0.57 mg/kg). The following failed to reverse the effects of yohimbine: the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, guanfacine (0.25 and 1 mg/kg), B-HT920 (0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg), B-HT933 (1 and 10 mg/kg); the beta-blocker propranolol (2.5 and 10 mg/kg); the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine; the D1 agonist SK&F 38393 (5 and 10 mg/kg) and the D2 agonist LY 171555 (0.5 and 1 mg/kg). Therefore, it is unlikely that activity at only the alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, D1 or D2 sites can entirely account for the anxiogenic actions of yohimbine in the elevated plus-maze. Evidence that clonidine affects the dopaminergic system and that apomorphine affects the noradrenergic system suggest that yohimbine may produce its anxiogenic response by activity on both the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems.", 
    "18": "The effect of selective beta 1-adrenoblocker metoprolol, used alone or in combination with selective beta 2-adrenostimulant terbutaline, on hemodynamic and gas exchange parameters was examined in 30 patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and attendant chronic pulmonary obstructive diseases (CPOD). Severe gas exchange and intracardiac hemodynamic disorders, conducive to right-ventricular decompensation, were demonstrated in this category of patients. Selective beta 1-adrenoblockers can be used as part of combined treatment for MI under the monitoring of external respiration parameters in patients with mild bronchial obstruction and moderate hypoxemia, whereas in MI patients with severe respiratory insufficiency and gas exchange disorders, the treatment with beta 1-adrenoblockers can aggravate those. Combined use of metoprolol and brikanil produces a number of favorable ventilatory and hemodynamic effects, conducive to the stabilization of clinical condition in MI patients with attendant CPOD and limits the risk of complications.", 
    "19": "The modulatory influence of alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists on the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated or H2-receptor-mediated positive chronotropic effect was investigated in isolated guinea-pig right atria. In the presence of cirazoline, the isoprenaline- or impromidine-induced positive chronotropic effect was significantly reduced. Methoxamine also reduced the isoprenaline-induced positive chronotropic effect. The reduction was abolished by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. The protein kinase C activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, as well as the protein kinase inhibitor polymyxin B, had no influence on the cirazoline-evoked decrease of the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic effect. Cirazoline, in the absence of isoprenaline or impromidine, concentration-dependently decreased heart rate, which could not be abolished by phentolamine and prazosin. Stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors by phenylephrine in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol, decreased spontaneous heart rate. The decrease was abolished by prazosin as well as by pretreatment with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxy-dopamine. The decrease in heart rate may to some extent be the result of interactions at the level of signal transduction systems of the 3 receptors.", 
    "20": "Non-Q-wave infarction, formerly referred to as nontransmural infarction, is usually associated with less myocardial necrosis and a lower in-hospital mortality than Q-wave or transmural infarction. Despite the initially favorable prognosis, however, long-term survival of patients after non-Q-wave infarction is similar to or even shorter than that after Q-wave infarction. It is now well documented that patients with non-Q-wave infarction are more prone to reinfarction, which usually occurs in the same area as the original injury. Since extensive damage from recurrent myocardial necrosis has a considerable deleterious effect on long-term survival, patients with non-Q-wave infarction would be expected to benefit from prophylactic treatment that prevents reinfarction. Indeed, this subset of patients appears to provide a unique opportunity to modify favorably the natural history of ischemic heart disease.", 
    "21": "The respiratory tolerance can limit the use of beta-blocker medication (beta-) currently indicated in numerous clinical situations, both cardiovascular and also neurological and ophthalmological. Blockade of beta adrenergic receptors is without risk in subjects free of bronchial pathology, but may destabilize underlying airflow obstruction; either presenting as or sustaining bronchospasm in an asthmatic, and increasing bronchial obstruction, in patients suffering from chronic airflow obstruction (BPCO). Now BPCO, and in particular asthma, are easily associated with diseases for which beta- are indicated. In addition the notion of cardioselectivity is relative and dose dependent.", 
    "22": "beta- are contraindicated in chronic airflow obstruction with bronchial hyper-reactivity; in other cases, beta- should be used carefully choosing the most cardioselective products at the lowest effective dose. Whatever the route of administration (in particular eye drops), the beta- are reliable to produce the same harmful effects. There should be strict follow up of treatment and a watch kept for signs of a worsening or a provocation of respiratory problems; conversely the occurrence of such symptomatology in a patient with bronchial pathology should call into question the place of beta-. Finally beta- should be avoided in allergic subjects and (a fortiori) in specific immunotherapy where there is a possibility of anaphylactic shock.", 
    "23": "The nature of the receptors that mediate the relaxation of smooth muscle by field stimulation, (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline was investigated in calf tracheal smooth muscle. The relation between relaxation, stimulation of the adenylate cyclase and density of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes was studied with the help of antagonists of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. The question of the existence of catecholamine-containing nerves was also investigated. (1) Nerves with varicosities exhibiting catecholaminergic fluorescence were observed between bundles of smooth muscle cells. (2) Consistent with the existence of adrenergic nerves (-)-noradrenaline was also found. The content of (-)-noradrenaline (1 microgram.g-1 w.w.) was the same in smooth muscle strips from the sublaryngeal region and from the region close to the bifurcation of the calf trachea. (-)-Adrenaline was not detected. (3) Smooth muscle relaxation by low (-)-noradrenaline concentration (0.6-2 nmol/l) was mediated through beta 1-adrenoceptors. Low concentrations of (-)-adrenaline (0.06-1 nmol/l) relaxed through beta 2-adrenoceptors. High concentrations of (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline also caused relaxation through beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptors respectively. (4) Field stimulation caused relaxation which was half maximal at 0.2-0.8 Hz. Blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors strongly attenuated the relaxant response to field stimulation and shifted the frequency-relaxation curves to 4 times higher frequencies. These results are consistent with a beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation caused by (-)-noradrenaline released from sympathetic nerve endings at low stimulation frequencies. (5) Blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors failed to reduce smooth muscle relaxation caused by field stimulation at low stimulation frequencies (0.1-1 Hz). However, after beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade, additional blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors reduced the relaxant effects observed at high frequencies (2-400 Hz). The results suggest that high concentrations of endogenous (-)-noradrenaline cause relaxation through beta 2-adrenoceptors. (6) Binding experiments with 3H-(-)-bupranolol and 3H-ICI 118,551 revealed between 10,000 and 20,000 beta-adrenoceptors per smooth muscle cell of which 3/4 were beta 2 and 1/4 beta 1. The equilibrium dissociation constant of (-)-adrenaline for both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors and of (-)-noradrenaline for beta 1-adrenoceptors was 1 mumol/l. The affinity of (-)-noradrenaline for beta 2-adrenoceptors was 10 to 20 times lower than for beta 1-adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "The interaction of the carbostyril derivatives 5-[2-[[1-(4-aminophenyl)-2-methyl-prop-2-yl]amino]-1-hydroxyethyl]- 8-hydroxycarbostyril (carbo-amine) and 5-[2-[[3-[4-(bromoacetamido)phenyl]-2-methylprop-2-yl]amino]-1- hydroxyethyl]-8-hydroxycarbostyril (carbo-Br) with the rat reticulocyte beta-adrenoreceptor system has been partially characterized. In the absence of a guanine nucleotide, the concentration of carbo-amine, carbo-Br and (-)isoprenaline that inhibited (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) binding by 50% (IC50) was 5.9 +/- 0.2, 3.3 +/- 0.3 and 49 +/- 3 nM, respectively. In the presence of a guanine nucleotide, the IC50 values were carbo-amine, 21 +/- 0.6 nM; carbo-Br, 7.6 +/- 0.3 nM and (-)isoprenaline, 813 +/- 66 nM. Preincubation of membranes with either of the carbostyril congeners followed by washing reduced specific [125I]CYP binding capacity without changing the KD value for the remaining receptors. The beta-antagonist nadolol largely prevented the receptor reduction induced by the carbostyril compounds. Incubation of membranes for 18 h at 25 degrees C resulted in an 11% recovery of the carbo-amine-induced receptor loss and no recovery of the receptors lost by preincubation with carbo-Br. However, the carbo-amine induced receptor loss could be largely reversed (80%) by membrane heating at 45 degrees C whereas little reversal (less than 10%) was observed with the carbo-Br pretreated membranes. The concentration of carbo-amine, carbo-Br and (-)isoprenaline that stimulated half-maximal cAMP formation in reticulocyte membranes was 17.8 +/- 3.1, 8.2 +/- 2.1 and 241 +/- 17 nM, respectively, and all 3 agonists produced the same maximal response. Initial cAMP formation stimulated by the carbostyril derivatives and (-)isoprenaline was blocked by concurrent addition of propranolol after 7 min of incubation with either of the two carbostyril derivatives did not affect further cAMP production whereas with (-)isoprenaline further cAMP production was blocked.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "The agonist (-)-denopamine was used as a tool to study relationships between pharmacological effects and adenylate cyclase stimulation mediated through beta 1-adrenoceptors. 1. (-)-Denopamine was a full agonist in kitten papillary muscles (force), kitten left atria (force) and kitten and guinea-pig atria (sinoatrial frequency). (-)-Denopamine was a strong partial agonist in guinea-pig tracheae (relaxation). None of these effects was influenced by blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors. beta 1-Adrenoceptors mediated all effects of (-)-denopamine in atria and effects of low (-)-denopamine concentrations in papillary muscles and tracheae, as assessed with beta 1-selective antagonists. 2. High (-)-denopamine concentrations caused positive inotropic effects in papillary muscles and tracheorelaxant effects that were resistant to blockade by beta 1-, beta 2- and alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists (non-adrenergic effects). 3. (-)-Denopamine stimulated the adenylate cyclase of membranes derived from kitten ventricle and calf tracheal cells with an intrinsic activity of 0.3 and 0.2, respectively, compared to catecholamines. The contribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors to cyclase stimulation was assessed by selective blockade. Cyclase stimulation through beta 2-adrenoceptors by (-)-denopamine was 12% in ventricle and 82% in trachea but is not associated with positive inotropic effects and tracheal relaxation. 4. (-)-Denopamine exhibited only a 2- to 5-fold selectivity for beta 1-adrenoceptors compared to beta 2-adrenoceptors, as estimated consistently from binding assays and blockade of cyclase stimulation in myocardial and tracheal cell membranes. 5. Desensitization of kitten ventricular tissues, caused by a 3 h exposure to 30 mumol/l (-)-isoprenaline followed by 5 h washout, reduced the inotropic sensitivity of papillary muscles without decreasing the maximum inotropic effects of (-)-denopamine. In desensitized tissues, the nonadrenergic effect contributed by 30% to the maximum inotropic effect of (-)-denopamine. 6. In membranes, derived from desensitized tissues, the maximum adenylate cyclase stimulation induced by (-)-isoprenaline, (-)-denopamine and xamoterol was reduced to 1/2 of the corresponding stimulations observed in membranes from sham desensitized tissues. The density of beta-adrenoceptors, assessed with 3H-(-)-CGP 12,177, was not changed by the desensitization procedure suggesting that part of the receptors was uncoupled from the adenylate cyclase. The partial inotropic agonist xamoterol, which has an intrinsic activity of 0.5 in non-desensitized tissues, failed to cause positive inotropic effects in desensitized papillary muscles suggesting that not all cyclic AMP possesses inotropic relevance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "26": "The present study was designed to examine the selectivity of 3H-CGP-12177 (4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-[5,7-3H]benzimidazole-2-one hydrochloride) for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors by the Scatchard and the displacement analysis. The plots of specific binding obtained from the Scatchard analysis using 3H-CGP12177 for the rat myocardium membrane were uniphasic when the non-specific binding was determined by the use of 10 microM I-propranolol, and the Kd and Bmax values were 408.53 +/- 67.20 pM and 12.27 +/- 0.83 fmoles/mg protein, respectively. On the other hand, two binding sites were observed in the displacement curve when I-metoprolol was used as a competitor. The existence of these two binding sites implied the selectivity of 3H-CGP12177 to beta-adrenoceptors because 3H-CGP12177 was 1.8-fold more selective towards beta 1-adrenoceptors than beta 2-adrenoceptors. In addition, these two binding sites could be regarded as beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors from the evaluation of the binding characteristics beta-adrenoceptors by the displacement analysis using beta-selective antagonists. Thus, 3H-CGP12177, a hydrophilic radioligand, was useful for the binding assay of beta-adrenoceptors in rat myocardial membranes.", 
    "27": "Beagle dogs with catheters chronically implanted into the lateral cerebral ventricle were used to study the distribution of atenolol and metoprolol between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasma over a 24-hr period during long term treatment. The concentration of atenolol declined more slowly in CSF than in blood plasma and the CSF/plasma ratio of atenolol (after iv administration for 7 days) increased from 0.08 +/- 0.02 (2 hr after dose) to 0.83 +/- 0.14 (24 hr after dose) (mean +/- SD). Furthermore, the CSF concentration of atenolol, relative to the plasma concentration, increased during repeated drug administration. The CSF/plasma ratio 24 hr after an iv dose was 0.48 +/- 0.12 on day 1 and 0.83 +/- 0.14 on day 7. The CSF concentration of the more lipophilic beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol was almost the same as the concentration of the drug in blood plasma. After 7 days of oral treatment, the CSF/plasma ratio of metoprolol 24 hr after dosing was 0.81 +/- 0.10. The regional CSF concentration of atenolol along the neuraxis was determined in anaesthetized dogs after acute iv administration of the drug. The atenolol concentration in CSF from the lateral cerebral ventricle was similar to that in the cisterna magna but lower than the concentration in CSF sampled from the lumbar region. It is concluded that the CSF concentration of the moderately lipophilic beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol equilibrates with the plasma concentration of the drug more rapidly compared with the hydrophilic drug atenolol.", 
    "28": "1. The chronotropic effect of norepinephrine was studied in isolated spontaneously beating atrial preparations of carp (Cyprinus carpio) heart. 2. Norepinephrine, 0.1 microM, caused a positive chronotropic effect, while at 1 microM it caused either a positive or a negative chronotropic effect. The positive chronotropic effect, observed in 13 preparations, was potentiated by phentolamine and almost completely blocked by propranolol. 3. The negative chronotropic effect observed in the other 5 preparations was greater in the presence of propranolol, reduced by phentolamine and not affected by atropine. 4. These results indicate that alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors may coexist, mediating the negative and positive chronotropic effects, respectively, in isolated atrial preparations of carp heart.", 
    "29": "1. The mechanism for positive and negative inotropic effects of histamine was studied in electrically stimulated ventricular strips of carp heart. 2. A high concentration of histamine (1 mM) caused a transient negative, and subsequent positive inotropic effects. The positive effect was significantly reduced by pyrilamine, diphenhydramine or dl-propranolol, but was not affected by cimetidine or d-propranolol. 3. Prior treatment with reserpine significantly decreased epinephrine and norepinephrine contents in ventricular muscles, and also almost completely abolished the positive inotropic effect caused by tyramine; however, this treatment failed to affect the positive inotropic effect of histamine. 4. The transient negative inotropic effect was reduced by neither atropine, diphenhydramine, pyrilamine nor cimetidine, and potentiated by pyrilamine. 5. These results suggest that the positive inotropic effect of histamine observed in the ventricular muscle of carp heart is mediated by a direct stimulation of both H1-receptors and beta-adrenoceptors. The negative inotropic effect is unrelated to either cholinergic or histaminergic receptor stimulation.", 
    "30": "Cardiotonic effects and the mechanism of action of 1,2-dihydro-6-methyl-2-oxo-5-(imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-6-yl)-3-pyridine carbonitrile hydrochloride monohydrate (E-1020), a new cardiotonic agent, were investigated in vitro. E-1020 (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/l) produced a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect in papillary muscles. E-1020 also caused an increase in contractile force in the right atria which was accompanied by small increases in spontaneous beating rate. The inotropic effect of E-1020 on papillary muscles was not altered by treatment with beta-adrenoceptor or histamine H2-receptor blockade, but was attenuated by the muscarinic agonist, carbachol. E-1020, like isoprenaline (isoproterenol, Iso), restored the contraction of papillary muscles which had been arrested in a high-potassium solution. The inotropic response of papillary muscles to Iso was potentiated by pretreatment with E-1020 at a minimally-effective inotropic concentration (3 x 10(-7) mol/l). E-1020 did not affect the activity of dog kidney Na+, K+-ATPase. On the other hand, the compound specifically inhibited the cyclic AMP-specific isoenzyme (fraction III) of phosphodiesterase and caused an elevation of cyclic AMP content in guinea pig hearts. These results indicate that E-1020 is a potent cardiotonic agent with a minor chronotropic effect and that its inotropic action is mainly mediated by the rise in cardiac cyclic AMP content due to the inhibition of cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase.", 
    "31": "Six cases of systemic reactions to topical treatment with beta-blocking eyedrops are reported, bradycardia and faintness due to an overdosage of ophthalmic timolol; decompensated heart failure one month after the prescription of carteolol eyedrops: bronchospasm after two weeks of treatment with metipranolol eyedrops; crippling Raynaud's phenomenon of otherwise unknown origin, which had begun with timolol eyedrops, continued with carteolol eyedrops and regressed after discontinuation of ophthalmic beta-blockers; aggravation of an anaphylactoid shock in a patient treated with ophthalmic timolol, and myocardial infarction possibly due to the abrupt withdrawal of timolol eyedrops. It cannot be overstressed that the rules governing the prescription of oral beta-blockers also apply to ophthalmic preparations of these drugs: respect of contra-indications, strict adherence to the dosage recommended, gradual drug withdrawal and regular supervision. Only controlled studies and long-term follow-up will be able to demonstrate differences in safety between the five beta-blockers commercialized as eyedrops in this country.", 
    "32": "The capability of cyclohexylphenol exaprolol of protecting the ischaemic myocardium during ischaemic cardiac arrest was assessed in the isolated working rat heart. Exaprolol added to the perfusion medium in a dose of 10(-7) mol.l-1 only minimally influenced the left ventricular function (reduced the stroke volume by 18.84% and cardiac output by 14.63%). The hearts were subjected to global ischaemia for 75 min at 26 degrees C and subsequently reperfused for 60 min at 37 degrees C. The recovery of left ventricular function following reperfusion, expressed as a percentage of preischaemic functional performance was used as an indicator of the ischaemic tolerance of the heart. The effect of exaprolol on sarcolemmal (Na+ + K+)-, Mg2+- and Ca2+-ATPase activities was also examined. Exaprolol-pretreated hearts revealed better postischaemic recovery of the left ventricular dP/dt max and stroke volume as well as improved efficiency in the transformation of chemical energy to mechanical work. Exaprolol in 10(-4) mol.l-1 concentration significantly stimulated the specific activity of sarcolemmal (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. Possible mechanisms of the salutary effect of exaprolol on the ischaemic heart are discussed.", 
    "33": "Bopindolol was given to hypertensive patients in a single daily dose ranging from 1 to 4 mg. In 86.7% of the patients diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 10 mmHg or more, or lowered to below 90 mmHg, already during the first 4 wk of treatment. Inulin clearance decreased by 10%; PAH and creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine were unchanged.", 
    "34": "The antihypertensive effect of bopindolol, a long-acting beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, was investigated in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). One group received tap water during the period of 8 to 32 weeks of age. The average dose of bopindolol administered was calculated from water intake to be approximately 1.4 mg/kg/day. The lowering effect in blood pressure of bopindolol was apparent at the age of 14 weeks, and this continued up to the end of the experiment. Bopindolol significantly reduced the heart rate. Plasma levels of urea nitrogen (BUN), triglyceride, and phospholipid of SHRSP treated with bopindolol were lower than those of the control SHRSP. One of the 8 control SHRSP died, and no rats treated with bopindolol died during the experiment. The histopathological study revealed that three of the control SHRSP had cerebral apoplexy, whereas there was no evidence of cerebral apoplexy in the treated SHRSP. Chronic treatment of bopindolol clearly alleviated myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophic changes in the left ventricular wall of the heart. Decreases in the incidence of proliferative arteritis and malignant nephrosclerosis in the kidney and necrotizing arteritis of the mesenteric arteries were observed in SHRSP treated with bopindolol. The data presented indicate that bopindolol is a powerful antihypertensive agent.", 
    "35": "Beta-blockers given within the first 24 hours of an acute MI, first as an intravenous bolus followed by oral therapy, have been shown to reduce in-hospital mortality following a myocardial infarction. For the long-term, beta-blockers represent the only documented effective prophylactic treatment for MI patients. The reduction in all-cause mortality is due primarily to a reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular deaths, particularly sudden cardiac deaths. This finding is consistent with the experimental observation that beta-blockers raise the threshold for ventricular fibrillation. Indeed, MI patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias respond very favorably to beta-blockers. However, reductions in nonsudden deaths and nonfatal reinfarctions have also been observed, suggesting that the beneficial effects of beta-blockers are not limited to antiarrhythmic effects alone and that these drugs may also have anti-ischemic effects. The prime candidates for beta-blocker therapy are the high-risk MI patients with transient electrical and/or pump complications during the acute phase. If therapy is initiated within hours of an acute infarction, it seems reasonable to continue it after hospital discharge. Evidence from the large, long-term trials suggest that, in the absence of any troublesome adverse reaction and given that most post-MI patients experience ventricular arrhythmias and angina, it seems reasonable not to limit the duration of treatment.", 
    "36": "The relaxant effects of isoprenaline, noradrenaline, and adrenaline on the isolated rectum of the rainbow lizard (Agama agama) were studied. Responses were measured as a reduction of carbachol-induced contractions for each sympathomimetic agent. Isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline produced a dose-dependent relaxation of this preparation and the order of potency was as given. The pD2 value of 8.15 +/- 1.88 obtained for isoprenaline was significantly different (p less than 0.05) from those for adrenaline (5.80 +/- 0.90) and noradrenaline (5.25 +/- 1.18). H35/25, propranolol, and practolol competitively antagonized the relaxant effects of isoprenaline on the isolated lizard rectum. The pA2 values for these beta-adrenoceptor antagonists did not differ significantly (at p less than 0.05). alpha-Adrenoceptor antagonists, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, failed to alter the relaxant responses of these sympathometics to any appreciable extent. These results are interpreted to suggest that the relaxant effect produced by these sympathomimetics are mediated predominantly by beta-adrenoceptors that are not significantly differentiated into subtypes. alpha-Adrenoceptors in this preparation contribute minimally to the observed inhibitory response following sympathomimetic stimulation.", 
    "37": "The isoproterenol dose-response curve was used to assess quantitatively the degree of systemic beta-adrenoceptor blockade induced by metipranolol (B\u00e9tanol) and betaxolol (B\u00e9toptic) eye drops. The study was carried out in twelve healthy volunteers, aged 22 +/- 1.4 yr. In a randomized double-blind trial, each volunteer received, on separate occasions at least one week apart, one drop in each eye of either placebo (physiological saline) or either of the ophthalmic beta-blockers. The intraocular pressure (Pio), heart rate (fc), arterial systolic (Pasys) and diastolic (Padia) pressures were measured before instillation of the eye drops after 15 to 30 min rest, and 3 h afterwards. The isoproterenol dose-response curve was studied 3 h after instillation of the drops. The CD25 (the amount of isoproterenol needed to increase fc by 25 b.min-1) was obtained by extrapolation on the least square linear regression curve. Both beta-blockers gave a significant fall in Pio compared with placebo, metipranolol more than betaxolol (p less than 0.02). There was also a significantly greater fall in fc with both metipranolol and betaxolol than with placebo. There were no changes in Pasys and Padia. CD25 was significantly increased with both beta-blocker eye drops as compared with placebo (p less than 0.05 for betaxolol; p less than 0.01 for metipranolol), but there was no difference between the two. Systemic absorption after topical application of ocular beta-blockers was thus confirmed for both metipranolol and betaxolol. However, the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade was weaker than that observed with other older ocular beta-blockers (timolol and carteolol).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "The stability of esmolol hydrochloride and sodium nitroprusside in an admixture containing both drugs was studied. Solutions containing sodium nitroprusside in a final concentration of approximately 200 micrograms/mL and esmolol hydrochloride in a final concentration of 10 mg/mL in 5% dextrose injection were prepared in a 250-mL volumetric flask. The flask was wrapped with a light-protective cover, stored at ambient room temperature (15-30 degrees C), and protected from light. All experiments were conducted in triplicate with samples taken at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours. Testing included measurement of pH and absorbance at 400 and 600 nm. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure esmolol hydrochloride and sodium nitroprusside concentrations. No changes were observed in the physical appearance, pH, or absorbance of the admixtures. Neither the esmolol hydrochloride nor the sodium nitroprusside concentrations varied by more than 4% during the study. Under the conditions studied, esmolol hydrochloride is compatible with sodium nitroprusside in an admixture containing both drugs.", 
    "39": "The experiments were carried out on female dogs with exteriorized ureters prior to and following surgical denervation of the left kidney. Propranolol 1.0 mg/kg b.w. was administered intravenously. Sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, creatinine and urea concentrations in the urine from the denervated and intact kidneys as well as in blood drawn were determined. After renal denervation PAH clearance was determined. As a result of denervation diuresis and calcium and copper excretion were increased while urine osmolality was diminished. No change occurred in kidney blood flow and GFR. After propranolol administration diuresis, calcium and copper excretion in the intact kidney significantly increased. Changes in the excretory function of the left kidney following its denervation were not a result of alterations in renal haemodynamics. Results obtained indicative of that beta-adrenergic receptors contribute to the excretion of calcium and copper ions.", 
    "40": "The acute effects of centrally acting beta adrenergic agonists on discrete trial conditioned avoidance responding in rats were examined. Clenbuterol (0.01-3.0 mg/kg), salbutamol (0.01-30 mg/kg), and prenalterol (30-300 mg/kg) suppressed avoidance responding in a dose-dependent manner at doses that did not produce escape failures. For comparative purposes, the effects of the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (1.0-30 mg/kg) and the antipsychotic haloperidol (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) were similarly assessed. Both compounds suppressed avoidance responding in a dose-dependent manner. Only haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg) produced escape failures. Administered alone, the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol (1.0 and 10 mg/kg) did not affect avoidance behavior. When administered prior to clenbuterol (0.1 mg/kg), salbutamol (1.0 mg/kg), or prenalterol (100 mg/kg), propranolol antagonized the beta adrenergic agonist-induced suppression of avoidance responding. The suppressive effect of desipramine (3.0 mg/kg) on avoidance performance only tended to be attenuated by propranolol. Propranolol had no effect on the ability of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) to reduce avoidance responding. These results suggest that the effects of the beta adrenergic agonists clenbuterol, salbutamol, and prenalterol on discrete trial avoidance behavior are mediated, in part, through agonist interactions with beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "41": "Although many cases of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) poisoning are uneventful, a proportion develop serious and sometimes fatal cardiovascular system depression with severe hypotension. As beta-adrenergic tone is not essential for cardiovascular function in health, there is no physiological reason why total beta-adrenoceptor blockade should have serious consequences in the resting individual. The toxic actions of beta-blockers appear to be related to properties such as membrane depressant activity and possibly due to actions on beta-adrenoceptors distinct from those in the cardiovascular system. Most reports of serious adverse effects following overdosage concern beta-blockers with significant membrane depressant activity, and in particular propranolol and oxprenolol, with which progressive heart block and bradycardia are features. Sotalol toxicity, with its unique electrophysiological action, is a special case. Animal experiments confirm that beta-blockers with membrane depressant activity are more toxic than the newer more selective ones, such as atenolol and nadolol. However, experimental models also reveal that artificial ventilation markedly reduces the toxicity of all beta-blockers tested, suggesting a respiratory depressant action with very high doses. Treatment of serious overdosage in man should include maintenance of adequate ventilation. High dose intravenous glucagon is recommended, because its inotropic action depends on direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase. beta-Agonists such as isoprenaline (isoproterenol) or prenalterol may be effective, but the nature of agonist-competitive antagonist interactions may necessitate the use of unrealistically large doses to overcome very high tissue beta-blocker concentrations.", 
    "42": "In the present study an investigation was made on the pharmacodynamic effect of the beta-blocking agent bupranolol in the low-dose range. Bupranolol is usually given in doses of 100 mg twice daily in the treatment of hypertension, however the dose range between 20 and 100 mg was studied using graded isoproterenol injections in healthy volunteers. A significant beta-1-blocking activity was observed for the 20 mg dose already. This effect was reduced after a treatment of 10 days. The effect increased with the higher doses, there might be a linear correlation between the logarithm of the dose and the reduction of the tachycardia after the isoproterenol injections in the low-dose range. It was concluded that using the safe and sensitive isoproterenol injection method, the clinical effect of very low doses of bupranolol may be demonstrated. The low dose might be useful to reduce the reflex tachycardia seen in the treatment of hypertension with vasodilating drugs.", 
    "43": "1. The action of N-2'-chloroethyl-N-ethyl-2-methyl benzylamine (xylamine) on rat pineal gland sympathetic innervation was examined. 2. This alkylating agent caused a concentration-dependent increase in pineal gland N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in neurologically intact pineal glands that was suppressed in glands previously subjected to bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy. 3. Xylamine-induced elevations in NAT activity were attenuated by beta-noradrenergic antagonist drugs but not by alpha-noradrenergic antagonist drugs. 4. Since pineal gland uptake of radiolabelled norepinephrine (NE) was impaired by xylamine, the drug may increase pineal gland NAT activity by inhibiting NE reuptake into the presynaptic nerve terminal, thereby increasing the amount of the neurotransmitter available to stimulate pinealocyte beta-noradrenoceptors.", 
    "44": "1. Rectus abdominis muscle biopsies were obtained from 28 patients undergoing abdominal surgery. In membranes prepared from these biopsies beta-adrenoceptor binding was examined. The apparent affinity (KD) and the density (Bmax) of the receptors for the radioligand (-)-[125I]cyanopindolol were 28.5 +/- 2.7 (pM) and 25.9 +/- 2.1 (fmol mg-1 protein) (mean +/- s.e. mean) respectively. In forceps biopsies from vastus lateralis muscle from four healthy volunteers the values for KD and Bmax were 22.5 +/- 4.4 (pM) and 16.4 +/- 2.2 (fmol mg-1 protein). The binding characteristics for the radioligand were similar in the biopsies from the two muscle sites. 2. Inhibition of the radioligand binding by the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 (KI = 117 +/- 45 nM) and selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol (KI = 15229 +/- 5046 nM) suggests the dominance of beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype in human skeletal muscle. 3. There were no significant differences in the skeletal muscle beta-adrenoceptor densities or affinities between the young and older patients.", 
    "45": "1. Intraocular pressure and cardiovascular responses to metipranolol 0.1% and 0.3% and timolol 0.25% eyedrops were measured in a balanced single dose placebo-controlled crossover study in eight healthy volunteers aged 34-58 years. 2. Timolol 0.25% and metipranolol 0.3% reduced intraocular pressure throughout the 6 h period of observation to a similar extent. Metipranolol 0.1% was marginally less effective, significantly reducing pressure up to 4 h only. 3. No drug treatment significantly altered resting heart rate or blood pressure. Timolol 0.25% significantly reduced exercise tachycardia (P less than 0.05), an effect which was not shown by metipranolol 0.1 or 0.3%. Exertional pain in the legs occurred more frequently after timolol 0.25% and metipranolol 0.3% than after metipranolol 0.1% or placebo eyedrops. 4. Octan-1-ol/pH 7.4 buffer distribution coefficients at 37 degrees C were found to be: metipranolol 5.19, timolol 0.84, indicating that metipranolol has an approximately 6-fold greater lipid solubility. 5. It is concluded that, by comparison with timolol, metipranolol in eyedrop concentrations up to 0.3%, despite its greater lipid solubility, reaches concentrations in the systemic circulation which are less likely to affect the heart.", 
    "46": "Three-hundred and seventy-five unselected patients below 65 years of age and with acute myocardial infarction participated in a controlled investigation aimed at studying the effects of a multifactorial intervention programme on morbidity, mortality and risk factor control. After ten years' follow-up the significantly lower sudden death and coronary mortality observed three years after myocardial infarction still persisted in the intervention group (188 patients) compared with the control group (187 patients). The incidence of sudden death in the intervention group was 12.8% compared with 23.0% in the controls (P = 0.01). The incidence of coronary mortality was 35.1% and 47.1%, respectively (P = 0.02). No significant difference was found in the number of patients with clinical non-fatal reinfarctions (25.6% and 19.3%, respectively). During the first year, when the mortality difference was most marked, the use of beta blockers was not significantly different between the groups. The results suggest that with a multifactorial intervention programme which starts early after the infarction and lasts for years a significant long-term reduction in sudden deaths and coronary mortality can be attained.", 
    "47": "Marching-in-place (MIP) was observed in 12 out of 133 (9%) chronically hospitalized psychiatric patients and in none of 60 hospital staff controls. The prevalence was similar in both sexes. MIP was associated with tardive dyskinesia or parkinsonism or both but did not occur alone. Counting the number of steps per minute provides a reliable method to quantify MIP and may permit a simple objective method for investigating the neuropharmacology of this phenomenon. Preliminary observations suggest that anticholinergic agents may improve MIP in some patients but worsen it in others.", 
    "48": "The advent of radioligand binding studies has allowed the classification of receptor subtypes in various tissues. However, the presence of a receptor subtype in a heterogenous tissue does not insure that the receptor has a significant physiological role. beta 1- and beta 2-Adrenoceptors have been reported to coexist in the rabbit right atria. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the physiological role of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in catecholamine-induced chronotropic responses in the rabbit right atria through comparison of data from functional and radioligand binding studies. Rank order of potency was determined using isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine for both chronotropic and inotropic responses in the rabbit right atria and right ventricular papillary muscles, respectively. These studies indicated that the beta 1-adrenoceptor was primarily responsible for catecholamine-induced responses. Next, the beta 1-selective antagonist, atenolol, was found to inhibit the chronotropic responses of the nonselective beta-agonist, isoproterenol, and the beta 2-selective agonist, terbutaline, to the same extent. These data indicate that terbutaline produces its chronotropic effects in the rabbit right atria through stimulation of beta 1-, not beta 2-adrenoceptors. Finally, competition studies for [125I]iodocyanopindolol and the relatively selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists (ICI 89406 and ICI 118551, respectively) indicated that the ratio of beta 1- to beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes is 6:1. It is concluded that while both receptors may be present in the rabbit right atria, the beta 1-adrenoceptor is the predominant subtype both in density and physiological significance, while the beta 2-adrenoceptor plays little, if any role, in the chronotropic responses induced by catecholamines.", 
    "49": "The relaxation of tension of the rabbit and rat heart right ventricle papillary muscles was estimated by the characteristic time t30. An increase in the stimulation rate as well as an increase in extracellular concentration of Ca ions decelerated the relaxation in the rabbit myocardium, whereas in the rat myocardium a shortening of interimpulse interval accelerated isometric relaxation. Constant administration of reserpine and beta-blocking agents did not alter the effects. The mechanism of the stimulation rate effect on the velocity of relaxation are discussed.", 
    "50": "1. The dose-related effects of the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine, UK-14,304 and B-HT 933 on the body temperature of untreated and reserpine-treated mice were investigated. 2. In untreated mice all three agonists induced a dose-related hypothermia. The highest doses of UK-14,304 and B-HT 933, 3 and 100 mg kg-1 respectively, elicited a marked (10 degrees C) hypothermia, whereas the maximal hypothermic effect of clonidine (5.5 degrees C) was less pronounced and reached a plateau at a dose of 0.5 mg kg-1 i.p. 3. Reserpine (2.5 mg kg-1, s.c.) induced a marked hypothermia in the mouse; 18 h after injection body temperature had decreased to only slightly (0.5-1.5 degrees C) above ambient (19 degrees C). 4. All three alpha 2-agonists produced a partial dose-related reversal of reserpine-induced hypothermia; maximal thermogenic responses (9-10 degrees C increases in body temperature) were elicited by doses of 0.2, 0.5 and 16 mg kg-1 i.p. of clonidine, UK-14,304 and B-HT 933 respectively, and the log dose-response curves for all 3 agonists were bell-shaped. 5. Following intracerebroventricular administration to reserpine-treated mice, the thermogenic response to clonidine was more rapid in onset, and the agonist was 20 fold more potent than when injected i.p. 6. The selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, idazoxan (0.05-0.5 mg kg-1), Wy 26392 (0.3-5.0 mg kg-1) and yohimbine (0.1-1.6 mg kg-1) given orally attenuated the thermogenic responses to all 3 agonists in reserpinized mice in a dose-related manner. Pretreatment with a single dose of idazoxan (0.3 mg kg-1, orally) elicited a 6 fold parallel shift to the right in the dose-response curve to clonidine. 7. The selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, prazosin (10 mg kg-1) and indoramin (3-10 mg kg-1), and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (10 mg kg-1), only partially attenuated the thermogenic responses to the alpha 2-agonists in reserpinized mice. These effects were variable and not clearly dose-related. 8. Pretreatment of reserpinized mice with the catecholamine synthesis inhibitor, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, markedly attenuated (60-95%) the thermogenic response to the noradrenaline uptake inhibitor, desipramine (0.13-12.5 mg kg-1, i.p.), but only slightly reduced (10-35%) that to clonidine (0.032-0.5 mg kg-1, i.p.). 9. These results suggest that alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists reverse reserpine-induced hypothermia via a central mechanism involving activation of postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "51": "To assess the role of blockade of beta-receptor subpopulations in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA), the specific beta 2-antagonist ICI 118,551 was compared to placebo in a double-blind study. After a baseline evaluation on placebo, patients were treated with ICI 118,551 or placebo. Five of six patients treated with ICI 118,551 showed improvements in NIA, while only one of four patients improved on placebo. Patients were then treated openly with propranolol, a mixed beta 1, beta 2-antagonist. Compared to ICI 118,551, no further improvement on objective measures of akathisia was seen on propranolol. Mean subjective assessments of NIA declined on propranolol, but changes were variable and not statistically significant.", 
    "52": "The hemodynamic and neurohumoral responses of 21 thiazide-resistant hypertensives receiving sequential chronic therapy with propranolol and bevantolol, a new cardioselective beta-1 blocker, were studied and compared with their responses to placebo. The objective was to determine to what extent decreased circulation levels of catecholamines and renin activity contributed to the hypotensive action of bevantolol and whether it demonstrated a significant sparing effect on vascular resistance. Both propranolol and bevantolol lowered supine and erect blood pressures to a comparable extent but the response of diastolic pressure to upright posture was maintained. Resting heart rates were lowered and postural tachycardia was attenuated. Propranolol induced a greater decrease in forearm blood flow and greater increase in vascular resistance than bevantolol. Both drug therapies were associated with lowered plasma concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline, while the decrease in noradrenaline levels was linearly related to the fall of mean arterial pressure for both drugs. Plasma renin activity was lowered only to a marginal extent by either drug but aldosterone concentrations were significantly reduced to a comparable extent by both drugs. The results suggest that a negative chronotropic action on the heart and an overall reduction in sympathetic nervous tone both contribute to the hypotensive effects of bevantolol and propranolol, but reduction of plasma renin activity may be of lesser importance. Bevantolol demonstrated a significant vascular sparing effect in this patient group compared with propranolol.", 
    "53": "Whether administration of antianginal medications at the time of exercise thallium scintigraphy reduces the prognostic value of this test was retrospectively examined using two year follow-up of 201 patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy of five test outcomes for prediction of coronary events (unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac death) were compared between groups of patients either taking or not taking antianginal medications. Specificity and negative predictive value of exercise and redistribution thallium scores for prediction of coronary events were greater in patients not taking antianginal medication (P less than 0.05). It was concluded that normal exercise thallium scintigraphy affords greater assurance against future coronary events in patients tested while not taking antianginal medications.", 
    "54": "Treatment in cases of acute myocardial ischaemia is currently undergoing dynamic changes. Several studies, involving thousands of patients with acute cardiac infarction, have shown beneficial effects of beta blockers, thrombolysis, and treatment with platelet aggregation inhibitors. Current research is focused on the definition of subgroups among those with acute myocardial ischaemia who are best served by a particular treatment or combination of treatments.", 
    "55": "A prospective study was carried out in 499 patients admitted to a coronary care unit (CCU) in order to evaluate the incidence of clinically significant electrolyte disturbances. Low serum potassium values (less than 3.6 mmol l) occurred in 7% of the CCU patients and low serum magnesium values (less than 0.70 mmol l-1) in 6%. Few patients had low values of both these ions (1.9%). In 49 patients the contents of these electrolytes in muscle biopsies were similar to the values of control subjects and were unrelated to treatment with diuretics. Serum calcium was determined in 444 of the patients and was above the reference range in 11 (2.5%). If we consider their concomitant parathyroid hormone (PTH) values, primary hyperparathyroidism was likely to occur in at least seven patients (1.5%). Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) had mean PTH and electrolyte values similar to those of individuals without this disease. In conclusion, the present study indicates that clinically important disturbances of magnesium, potassium or calcium homeostasis are rare among unselected patients admitted to a CCU.", 
    "56": "The treatment of pain in acute myocardial infarction varies with local practice. Narcotic analgesics are still the usual treatment in many hospitals. Knowledge of optimal doses, duration of pain relief, and time between drug administration and pain relief is inadequate. Many studies indicate that the relief of pain is often incomplete after treatment with narcotic analgesics. There is often a need for alternative treatments. Large randomised studies consistently show that beta blockade, initially given intravenously and then orally, relieves pain and reduces the need for analgesics. Studies also indicate that early administration of streptokinase and glyceryl trinitrate relieves pain. There is evidence that drugs that limit ischaemic damage also relieve pain.", 
    "57": "The relationship between blood pressure (BP) and blood lead concentration (PbB) was examined in 51 bus drivers who were treated for hypertension. These drivers were a subset of a representative sample (N = 342) of the driver population (N = approximately 2,000), and were not selected for hypertension or lead exposure. Blood lead concentrations ranged from 2-24 micrograms/dl (median: 6.9 micrograms/ld). There were 33 subjects treated primarily with diuretics, and 18 subjects were treated with beta blockers. Adjusted regression coefficients relating systolic BP with PbB were -6.4 +/- 11.4 and 4.5 +/- 12.9 mmHg/In(micrograms/dl) in each group, respectively, but were not statistically significant. The adjusted coefficients for diastolic BP were 1.12 +/- 3.89 and 14.3 +/- 5.69 mmHg/In(micrograms/dl) (p = 0.036), respectively. The latter relationship represents an average increment of 12 mmHg in diastolic BP over the range of observed PbBs (2.0 to 11.4 micrograms/dl) in subjects treated with beta blockers. Thus, beta blocker therapy may be less effective in reducing diastolic pressure in individuals with higher PbBs and suggests an action of lead at PbBs below current standards.", 
    "58": "The influence of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs atenolol, doberol, propranolol and exaprolol on synaptosomal membranes was studied using ESR spectroscopy of stearic acid spin labeled at the 16th position. The drugs changed the ESR spectra of the label in the membranes, where in addition to changes of a fluid lipid component they increased the proportion of a motionally-restricted component. No motionally-restricted component was found in the samples prepared from brain total lipid liposomes treated with the drugs. The drug propensities at 20 mmol/l concentration to increase the proportion of the motionally-restricted component in the following order, control less than doberol approximately atenolol less than or equal to propranolol less than exaprolol did not correlate with their potency to influence the dynamics of the bulk lipid membrane phase. The motionally-restricted component induced by exaprolol increased with raising temperature and prolongation of time of the sample incubation. The results indicate that the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs influence lipid-protein interaction in the synaptosomal membranes, which could be important for elucidation of their mechanism of biological membrane activities.", 
    "59": "In rabbits, the characteristics of cardiac beta-1 receptor blockade produced by ICI 147,798, a novel beta receptor blocking agent with diuretic properties, were evaluated and compared with those of propranolol. In conscious rabbits, i.v. injections of 0.31, 1.0 and 3.1 mg/kg of ICI 147,798 and 1.0 mg/kg of propranolol caused significant bradycardia. ICI 147,798 produced a dose-dependent shift to the right of the dose-response (chronotropic) curve of isoproterenol with suppression of the maximal tachycardia, an effect characteristic of insurmountable beta receptor blockade. Propranolol also produced a shift to the right of the dose-response curve of isoproterenol without affecting the maximal tachycardia. ICI 147,798-induced antagonism was specific for beta adrenoceptors as it failed to modify the effects of acetylcholine, angiotensin II, phenylephrine, adenosine, histamine and prostaglandin E2 on mean arterial pressure and heart rate. In rabbits with prior autonomic blockade, ICI 147,798, like propranolol, failed to inhibit the positive chronotropic effects of theophylline which are mediated by postreceptor mechanisms. In reserpinized rabbits, ICI 147,798 was found to have no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Unlike the effects of propranolol, which were attenuated by first-pass through the hepatic vascular bed, the effects of ICI 147,798 were unaffected suggesting an absence of first-pass metabolism. The effects of propranolol (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) were not detectable at 24 hr after injection, whereas significant beta receptor blocking activity was still present at 24 hr after ICI 147,798 (1.0 mg/kg i.v.). The results suggest that ICI 147,798 is a specific, long-acting, insurmountable beta-1 receptor blocking agent without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "ICI 147,798 has been shown to exhibit both diuretic and beta-antagonist properties in vivo. The present study investigated the nature and selectivity of the beta-antagonism in a variety of isolated tissues. ICI 147,798 produced a concentration-dependent suppression of the maximum chronotropic response of norepinephrine in guinea pig right atria (beta-1 adrenoceptor). ICI 147,798 caused a concentration-dependent shift to the right of the salbutamol concentration-response curve in the guinea pig trachea (beta-2 adrenoceptor), and Schild analysis suggested competitive inhibition. Propranolol produced parallel shifts to the right of the norepinephrine concentration-response curve in guinea pig right atria, except at relatively high concentrations. The inhibitory effects of propranolol in guinea pig right atria were reversed by greater than 95%, whereas the effects of ICI 147,798 were only slightly reversed after a 6-hr washout period. Preincubation of propranolol with ICI 147,798 in guinea pig right atria prevented completely the suppression of the norepinephrine maximum chronotropic response. Postincubation of propranolol with ICI 147,798 partially reversed the suppression of the maximum chronotropic response. ICI 147,798 had no effect on the maximum chronotropic responses of either histamine (H2-receptor) or forskolin (adenylate cyclase activation) in guinea pig right atria and had no effect on agonist responses in a variety of other receptor systems. The insurmountable beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonism was evaluated based on the assumptions of irreversible competitive antagonism, mixed competitive and noncompetitive antagonism and slowly dissociating competitive antagonism (\"hemi-equilibrium\" conditions). Concentration-dependent changes in norepinephrine KA values suggested the first three possibilities were unlikely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Essential hypertension is a major health care problem in the elderly and requires effective treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. The traditional stepped-care approach to therapy consisted of diuretics; sympatholytic agents, or beta-blockers for all age groups. Indeed, initial therapy with these agents is effective in 50 to 60 percent of elderly patients but may produce adverse effects. A high incidence of adverse responses, including sexual dysfunction and central nervous system impairment, has been reported with diuretic or beta-blocker therapy, and a reduction in several measures of quality of life has been noted during therapy with methyldopa or propranolol. Administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is as effective as the traditional stepped-care approach without producing the ill effects associated with diuretics, sympatholytics, or beta-blockers. The combination of an ACE inhibitor with a diuretic produces additive antihypertensive effects while minimizing diuretic-induced metabolic alterations. Orthostatic hypotension with the first dose can be minimized by making sure that patients are not hypovolemic from previous diuretic therapy. Nevertheless, in controlled trials, the combination of ACE inhibitor and diuretic has been effective in up to 85 percent of patients. In addition, the use of ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in the hypertensive patient with concomitant congestive heart failure. Most important, the patient's quality of life is maintained during therapy with an ACE inhibitor alone or in combination with a diuretic. Thus, an ACE inhibitor plus a diuretic is a valuable alternative to traditional antihypertensive therapy in elderly patients.", 
    "62": "The assessment of chronic pharmacological treatment of stable angina requires serial exercise stress testings. It is well known that exercise tolerance can be improved by the training effect of performing repeated testings. Our study investigated the values of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate-pressure product, and duration of exercise at 0.1 mV ST depression during exercise and the same parameters plus the maximal ST-segment depression at peak exercise, collected from three different tests. The first and second were performed at one-week intervals before, and the third (75 days after the first), was performed after a double-blind study with a drug versus placebo. We found a significant increase of exercise duration at 0.1 mV ST depression and at peak exercise, while 6 of 12 patients increased exercise duration from the second to the third test. Individual variability of exercise duration showed increasing values, ranging from 0 to 71% (first vs. third test). In contrast, the ratio of heart rate and systolic blood pressure did not differ between the tests. Our data criticized the use of mean values of exercise time for pharmacological studies; moreover, individual variability could affect results independently of drug or placebo administration. These findings should be taken into account in order to exclude misleading results.", 
    "63": "Venous return determines cardiac preload and is in turn affected by respiration and vasodilation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the dynamics of venous return and venous volume, using impedance volume measurements in the venous system. In order to develop a methodology for the assessment of venous volume and venous return in man, we first studied 17 endotracheally intubated and ventilated anesthetized closed-chest dogs. We measured central venous and inferior vena cava (IVC) pressure (micromanometer) and volume (impedance catheter). Studies were done above and below the diaphragm with normal ventilation, with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and with beta-adrenergic blockade and i.v. nitroglycerin. Intrathoracic IVC volume fell and extrathoracic IVC volume rose with lung inflation, while PEEP raised extrathoracic IVC volume and lowered intrathoracic IVC volume. Nitroglycerin lowered intrathoracic IVC volume. Beta blockade did not affect IVC volume, ventilatory variation, or response to PEEP and nitroglycerin. We performed similar studies in 14 human subjects during normal quiet respiration, with measurements above and below the diaphragm, and with interventions including Valsalva maneuver and i.v. nitroglycerin. Intrathoracic IVC volume fell and extrathoracic IVC volume rose with expiration and Valsalva maneuver. Nitroglycerin again lowered intrathoracic IVC volume. We conclude that venous volume and the dynamics of venous return can be assessed in animals and man with an impedance catheter. Specifically, we show the divergent effects of respiration, ventilation, PEEP, and nitroglycerin on IVC volumes above and below the diaphragm. Beta-adrenergic blockage does not appear to play a role in altering any of these effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "Angina pectoris in the elderly is usually due to fixed coronary arteriosclerotic disease. Management includes the use of nitrates and beta- and calcium-blocking drugs. A combination of these drugs may be necessary in patients with severe symptoms. Each of these drugs has potential side effects. These drugs should be started in small dosages and gradually increased, determined by the patient's response. Angina with associated disease states should determine what specific drugs are selected.", 
    "65": "We have determined simultaneously the density of beta-adrenoceptors in human myometria (by (-)-[125I]iodopindolol binding) derived from 36 women undergoing cesarean section and in the corresponding circulating lymphocytes (by (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding). In myometrial membranes about 80% to 85% of the beta-adrenoceptors were of the beta 2-subtype. The density of myometrial and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors in women treated with the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist hexoprenaline to prevent preterm labor was about 65% to 70% lower than that in nontreated women. Concomitantly, in hexoprenaline-treated women the 10 mumol/L isoproterenol-evoked increase in lymphocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate content (as index for lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness) was diminished to a similar extent. Combining all data resulted in a significant positive correlation between myometrial and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor densities (r = 0.7303; n = 36; p less than 0.001). It is possible that determination of beta-adrenoceptor function in circulating lymphocytes may be a useful model to monitor myometrial beta-adrenoceptor changes during tocolytic therapy.", 
    "66": "To assess the contribution of cardiac beta 2-receptors in the cardiac inotropic and chronotropic responses to a beta 2 agonist, terbutaline was infused (0.2 and 0.4 micrograms/kg/min), alone or after pretreatment with either oral atenolol 50 mg or atropine 0.04 mg/kg i.v. or both in six healthy subjects with a multiple crossover design. Terbutaline 0.2 micrograms/kg/min increased heart rate by 15 +/- 2 beats/min, and this response doubled (to 29 +/- 3 beats/min) when the terbutaline infusion followed atropine pretreatment, whereas atenolol pretreatment had no significant effect. Heart rate increased by 44 +/- 2 beats/min in response to terbutaline 0.4 micrograms/kg/min. This response was not affected by atropine. Pretreatment with atenolol diminished the chronotropic response to the higher dose of terbutaline to 27 +/- 4 beats/min. The inotropic response (i.e., changes in pressure: volume ratio) to terbutaline 0.2 micrograms/kg/min was potentiated by atropine (from 1.6 +/- 0.3 to 3.4 +/- 0.8 mm Hg/ml), whereas atenolol pretreatment had no effect. At the higher dose of terbutaline, atropine pretreatment had no additional effect, whereas atenolol decreased the rise in pressure: volume ratio from 6.0 +/- 1.4 to 2.6 +/- 1.0 mm Hg/ml. The results with atenolol pretreatment indicate that cardiac beta 1 responses are associated with the higher dose of terbutaline, either through direct beta 1 stimulation or indirectly from presynaptic beta 2 activity. The atropine data show that vagal tone actually increased during the terbutaline infusions, blunting the cardiac effects. The results of the present study support the existence of functional chronotropic, as well as inotropic, beta 2 receptors in the healthy human heart.", 
    "67": "Enzymatically inactive renin (IR) is the predominant circulating form of renin. Sympathetic activity may influence plasma renin activity (PRA) by regulation of the conversion of IR to active renin (AR, PRA). It has been demonstrated previously that beta blockade lowers PRA at least partly through inhibition of this conversion process. The authors hypothesized that beta blockade and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) would have opposing effects on production of AR from its inactive precursor. Eighteen primary hypertensives (12 male, 6 female, mean age 57.7 +/- 2.7) were entered in a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study of the effects of equipotent doses of pindolol and propranolol on mean +/- SEM systolic BP, diastolic BP, heart rate, active renin (AR), total renin (TR), inactive renin (IR), and % AR/TR. Drug dose was titrated to achieve a goal DBP of 90 mmHg or less. Active renin was defined as the rate of generation of angiotensin I in 37 degrees C plasma at pH 5.7. Total renin was determined by preincubation of plasma aliquots with 1.5 mg/mL trypsin in the presence of 5 mM benzamadine for one hour at -4 degrees C prior to assay of renin activity. Inactive renin was calculated as TR minus AR. The BP responses achieve by dose titration of propranolol and pindolol were virtually identical at rest, indicating equivalent depressor effects of the two beta blockers. Heart rate and active renin were, however, lowered to a much greater extent with propranolol as compared with pindolol. The lack of significant pindolol-induced fall in % AR/TR suggests that this drug has little net effect on the formation of AR from IR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "The effects of two cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents--celiprolol (claimed to have bronchodilator properties) and atenolol (without such claims)--on respiratory function and control of asthma were studied in ten asthmatic patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Following a beta-2 agonist-free period of ten hours, administration of 100 mg of atenolol was associated with bronchoconstriction (p less than 0.05), whereas 400 mg of celiprolol was not. Responsiveness to beta-2 agonist therapy was retained with both agents (p less than 0.05). Day-to-day asthma control, interpreted from patient recordings of peak flow, inhaler use and symptom scores, were all no different on either agent from placebo. When given acutely, celiprolol appeared to have acute bronchosparing properties, possibly providing a greater margin of respiratory safety than atenolol.", 
    "69": "Isradipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with myocardial effects significantly different from those of nifedipine, as shown by in vitro and animal experimental data. Isradipine selectively inhibits the sinus node but not the atrioventricular conduction and its negative inotropic action is much less if administered in a dose of comparable peripheral effects. To study these effects in man, 40 patients with coronary artery disease were divided into 2 groups receiving either a continuous 30-minute intravenous infusion of 2 mg of nifedipine or 0.5 mg of isradipine, doses that resulted in a comparable afterload reduction (decrease of systemic vascular resistance: nifedipine -22.1%, isradipine -25%, p less than 0.001). Ten patients in each group received an additional intravenous bolus of 5 mg of propranolol at the end of the calcium antagonist administration to antagonize its induced adrenergic reflex mechanisms. The heart rate significantly increased after nifedipine only (+9.2%, p less than 0.001), experienced no change after isradipine and the nifedipine and propranolol combination and decreased after the combination of isradipine and propranolol (-9.6%, p less than 0.001). This resulted in a significant decrease of the rate pressure product with isradipine (-12.5%, p less than 0.001) but not with nifedipine. As a result of the afterload-induced adrenergic reflex mechanisms, the maximal derivative of the left ventricular pressure increased after isradipine administration (+13.5%, p less than 0.001) and was unchanged after nifedipine, which demonstrates the significantly less negative inotropic properties of isradipine as compared with nifedipine.", 
    "70": "A 5-year, randomized, double-masked, clinical trial was conducted to determine whether treatment with topical timolol maleate was effective in preventing or delaying the onset of glaucomatous visual field loss in subjects with ocular hypertension. Sixty-five individuals considered to be at moderate risk for developing open-angle glaucoma were recruited for the study. In each patient, one eye was chosen randomly to receive timolol twice-daily while the fellow eye received diluent (placebo). Timolol administration reduced IOP from baseline in the treated eyes over the course of the study by a mean +/- SD of 4.9 +/- 3.4 mm Hg. Timolol administration also produced a mean +/- SD contralateral reduction of IOP from baseline in the untreated fellow eyes of 2.9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg. The mean +/- SD difference in IOP between the treated and untreated eyes during the study was 2.3 +/- 2.6 mm Hg. Over the course of the study reproducible visual field loss developed in 4 timolol treated eyes and 10 placebo treated eyes (P = .039, McNemar test). Clinical progressive optic disc cupping was noted in four treated and eight untreated eyes (P = .11, McNemar test). In the 42 subjects who completed a minimum 4-year follow-up, baseline and final optic disc photographs were analyzed using a computer image analysis system to determine changes in the area of disc pallor. The mean +/- SD increase in optic disc pallor was 0.86% +/- 2.4% in the timolol treated eyes and 1.80% +/- 3.6% in the placebo treated eyes. This difference was statistically significant (P = .04, paired t-test). This study provides evidence that medical treatment prevents or delays the onset of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic disc damage in individuals with ocular hypertension. The magnitude of the protective effect of timolol was partially obscured by the contralateral reduction of IOP in the placebo treated fellow eyes.", 
    "71": "Balb/c mice were immunized with homologous heart in complete Freund's adjuvant to induce autoimmune myocarditis. The myocarditis was characterized by lymphomononuclear infiltration, electrocardiographic abnormalities and antimuscle antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. In this paper, we demonstrate that the IgG present in autoimmune myocarditis mice is able to bind to beta-adrenoreceptors of the heart and also induce a biological effect inhibiting the contractile action of exogenous norepinephrine. Auto-immune IgG inhibited the binding of (3H)-dyhidroalprenolol to a beta-adrenergic receptor of purified myocardial membranes behaving as non-competitive inhibitor. This IgG also exerted a non-competitive inhibition upon the mechanical effect of exogenous norepinephrine. The recognition appears to be organ specific, because the autoimmune myocarditis IgG did not bind to beta-lymphocyte, lung and fat adrenoreceptors. The autoimmune IgG inhibited the stimulatory action of isoproterenol on cAMP levels, behaving as a beta-adrenergic antagonist.", 
    "72": "The basic compound N-N-N'-trimethyl-N'-(2-hydroxy-3-methyl-5-iodobenzyl)-1,3- propanediamine (HIPDM) accumulates in human and rabbit lungs, where it forms a slowly effluxable pool. In isolated perfused rat lung, HIPDM is taken up by a saturable, energy-independent mechanism, which is competitively inhibited by imipramine, chlorpromazine and propranolol. To ascertain whether beta-adrenergic receptors are involved in the binding process of HIPDM to lung tissue, the ability of unlabelled HIPDM to displace the beta-adrenergic receptor ligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) from rabbit lung beta-receptors was examined. Lung microsomal membrane fractions (75 micrograms ml-1) were incubated at 37 degrees C for 3 h with 68 pM ICYP (with or without 1 microM of (+/-)-propranolol) in the presence of HIPDM (10(-10)-10(-3) M). Bound and free radioactivity were separated through glass-fibre filters and the retained radioactivity was counted in a gamma-spectrometer. HIPDM competed with ICYP for beta-adrenoceptors (13% displacement at 10(-5) M. 50% at 5 x 10(-5) M, and 90% at 2 x 10(-4) M). The inhibition curve of ICYP binding by HIPDM was similar to that observed for (-)-noradrenaline. Although the results of the in vitro studies cannot be extrapolated to in vivo conditions, they suggest that beta-adrenergic receptors may be involved in the observed lung uptake of the basic amine HIPDM.", 
    "73": "To investigate the possible side effects of epinephrine on the aqueous outflow pathway, we studied the response of human trabecular cells in vitro exposed daily to the drug at various concentrations. Epinephrine at 10(-6) M caused abnormal cytokinesis and cell retraction, inhibited mitosis and phagocytosis, and induced a 4- to 5-fold increase in cAMP. After 7-10 days of exposure, notable degenerative changes were observed in the trabecular cells. Within certain limits, these effects were reversible when the drug was withdrawn. Exposure to epinephrine at 10(-5) M caused cell death within 96 hours. When a 10(-7) M concentration of epinephrine was administered for up to 10 days, no degenerative changes were seen, but mitotic activity was reduced somewhat. Pretreatment with timolol reduced, but did not completely eliminate, the cytotoxic effects of epinephrine. Cells with loose contact to the substrate were affected most. The morphologic changes and the observed loss of intracellular actin filaments indicate that the deleterious effects of epinephrine are probably mediated through damage to cellular contractile proteins. Although the precise cytotoxic action of epinephrine in vivo remains to be established, our results for primary cell cultures indicate a toxic action of this drug at concentrations of 10(-6) M or higher on human trabecular cells and suggest that, for prolonged use, the maximal dose of this drug at target sites should be in the region of 10(-7) M.", 
    "74": "In this study we seek to elucidate the mechanism of hormone-independent adenylate cyclase stimulation by Gpp(NH)p in chicken erythrocyte membranes, and the inhibition of this stimulation by propranolol. Membrane treatment with isoprenaline + GMP increased Gpp(NH)p stimulation to near maximal levels [obtainable with isoprenaline + Gpp(NH)p], but reduced stimulation by NaF. The stimulation by Gpp(NH)p was stereoselectively inhibited by propranolol, but not by equal concentrations of the local anaesthetic lignocaine. Propranolol's inhibitory action was abolished following membrane treatment with isoprenaline/GMP. In contrast to its inhibition of Gpp(NH)p stimulation, propranolol did not alter Gpp(NH)p-mediated 3H-GDP release from membranes. The polyene antibiotic filipin, which uncouples receptor (R) from Gs, also abolished Gpp(NH)p stimulation and this effect was partly overcome by membrane treatment. These results are consistent with a model in which free R exists in equilibrium with precoupled R.Gs complexes in the absence of hormone. These complexes are activated by Gpp(NH)p and dissociated by antagonists. The existence of such complexes is a prerequisite for Gpp(NH)p stimulatory action.", 
    "75": "Beta-2 adrenergic receptors were found in a human heart and their role in regulation of inotropic properties during last year was proved. The aim of our study was comparison of effects of selective (metoprolol) and nonselective (propranolol) beta-receptors blockade on cardiac electrophysiological properties. The study was carried out in 20 patients in the majority without organic heart injury and clinical symptoms of the sinus node dysfunction as well as atroioventricular conduction disorders. Method of the transoesophageal left atrial stimulation was utilized. Examinations were performed after drugs administrations in the same persons, during following days. Propranolol and metoprolol were intravenously administrated in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg b.w. Both drugs statistically significant lengthened sinus rhythm cycle time, sinus node recovery time, sinus node and a-v node effective refraction and lowered Wenckebach's point. They did not significantly effect on sinoatrial conduction and the atrial effective refraction. There were no significant differences between examined beta-blockers. Obtained results allowed us to conclude that: 1) eletrophysiologic properties of propranolol and metoprolol are similar, 2) it seems that in physiological conditions the effects of the adrenergic nervous system on electrophysiologic properties of sinus node, atrio-ventricular node and atrium is mainly realized by beta-1 adrenergic receptors.",

    "77": "Blood pressure (BP) and hemodynamic responses (cardiac output [CO] and total peripheral resistance [TPR]) to a competitive reaction-time task, previously shown to increase beta-adrenergic activity, were compared in 20 Black and 20 White young men, once following infusion of saline placebo and later repeated after infusion of the nonselective beta-antagonist, propranolol. Both racial groups included subjects with marginal systolic BP (SBP) elevations (n = 6 Whites, n = 5 Blacks) and subjects with normal BP (n = 14 Whites, n = 15 Blacks). Blacks with marginal SBP elevations showed greater diastolic BP increases during the stressor than their White counterparts, both before and after beta-blockade. Both Blacks and Whites with marginal SBP elevations showed greater CO increases during the task than normotensives prior to blockade. Independent of BP status, Black subjects consistently showed higher TPR responses to the task than Whites (lesser decreases before blockade and greater increases after blockade). Blacks also showed greater diminution than Whites after blockade in ionotropic myocardial responses (stroke volume, pre-ejection period, and CO) to the stressor. The possible contributions of alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic influences to these racial group differences are discussed.",

The main basal cAMP level in bovine thyroid slices was 3 pmol/mg tissue. TSH stimulated cAMP production in correlation to the concentration. Maximum stimulation was achieved with a TSH concentration of 10 mU/ml. The beta-blockers DL-propranolol and L-alprenolol caused 74 and 77% inhibition of TSH-stimulated cAMP synthesis respectively. The beta-adrenergic agonist L-isoprenaline did not significantly affect either the basal or the TSH-stimulated cAMP level. The role of the beta-adrenergic receptor system in the regulation of TSH-stimulated cAMP synthesis is discussed.",

Injection of epinephrine induced in skin a decrease in the level of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate (Glc-1,6-P2), which was accompanied by correlated changes in the activities of several enzymes which are modulated by this regulator. 2. These effects were blocked by the alpha adrenergic blocker phentolamine, in contrast to muscle where the hormone increases Glc-1,6-P2, acting through beta receptors. 3. The changes in the enzymes' activities, as well as in glycogen and lactate content induced by epinephrine, reveal that the hormone causes, in skin, a stimulation of glycogenolysis and glycolysis, as well as an acceleration of pentose phosphate pathway. 4. The reduction in glycogen content induced by epinephrine, was blocked by the beta adrenergic blocker propranolol, whereas the hormone's effects on the other processes were mainly mediated through alpha receptors.", 
    "80": "1. In experiments on 2-, 10- and 22-month old rats, it was found that the Bmax values for muscarinic receptors and beta-adrenoreceptors increased in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus of 10-month old rats as compared to those in 2-month old rats. 2. The Bmax values for both receptor types significantly decreased in the same brain structures of 22-month old rats as compared to those in 10-month old rats. In the striatum and hippocampus of 22-month old rats the binding capacity decreased as compared also to those in 2-month old rats. 3. In the hypothalamus there was also a tendency towards increasing the binding capacity of 10-month old rats and towards decreasing the binding capacity of 22-month old animals only for muscarinic receptors. The beta max of beta-adrenoreceptors remained unchanged in all age groups studied. 4. The receptor affinity of both receptor types was in most cases unaltered with advancing age. The Kd values were slightly increased only in the striatum and hippocampus of 22-month old rats as compared to 10-month old rats. 5.

However, the inhibition of FMLP-induced O2- generation was more pronounced than that induced by PMA. Disodium cromproxate also counteracted the changes in membrane potential in neutrophils induced by either FMLP or PMA. The actions of disodium cromproxate differed from those of propranolol, as propranolol had no antagonistic action on membrane potential changes induced by FMLP and PMA.", 
    "82": "Astrocytes are the most numerous cell type in the central nervous system. When cultured, these cells express a wide variety of receptors for neurotransmitters. Nonetheless, it has yet to be firmly established that adult astrocytes in situ express receptors for neurotransmitters. In this report the technique of combined receptor autoradiography and immunocytochemistry has been applied to isolated astrocytes from adult animals to examine beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) expression by these cells. It is shown that fibrous and protoplasmic astrocytes isolated from adult rat cerebral cortices specifically bind the beta-AR ligand iodocyanopindolol and that this binding is inhibited by the beta-AR ligands propranolol and isoproterenol. These results indicate that at least two of the major morphological subtypes of adult astrocytes express beta-ARs.", 
    "83": "The effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors on the lower limits of cerebral (CBF) and cerebellar blood flow (CeBF) autoregulation were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats. CBF and CeBF were measured during hemorrhagic hypotension in rats treated with adrenergic blockers, phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) or propranolol (PPL), using a hydrogen clearance method. The lower limits for CBF beyond which blood flow was decreased steeply were 72% of resting values in the control, 44 in the PBZ and 80 in the PPL group. Similar tendency was also observed for CeBF. In the control group, the reducing rates of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to decrease CBF by 15 and 30% of the resting values were 33% (58 mm Hg) of the resting MAP and 46% (80 mm Hg), respectively, and those to reduce CeBF to the same extent were 35% (61 mm Hg) and 52% (92 mm Hg), respectively. In the PBZ group, the respective reducing rates of MAP were 52% (71 mm Hg) and 65% (88 mm Hg), respectively, for CBF and 50% (68 mm Hg) and 65% (88 mm Hg), respectively, for CeBF. In contrast, in the PPL group, those rates were 22% (39 mm Hg) and 32% (56 mm Hg), respectively, for CBF, and 23% (40 mm Hg) and 30% (52 mm Hg), respectively, for CeBF, being significantly smaller than those in the control and the PBZ groups (p less than 0.01, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "84": "Dilevalol (R,R'-isomer of labetalol) is an antihypertensive agent combining non-specific beta blockade with peripheral vasodilatation due to beta 2-receptor agonism. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of chronic dilevalol administration on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density. The investigation was conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison. Ten days of chronic dilevalol (400 mg) or placebo treatment was administered to 12 healthy normotensive volunteers. Clinical and biochemical parameters: heart rate (HR) systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), electrocardiogram, norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), MHPG (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol; one of the major brain metabolites of NE) were analysed on the first day (D1) before (H0) and 3 h after oral treatment (H3) and on the tenth day (D10). Clinical results showed no significant changes in HR, DBP, SBP in the two groups (placebo, n = 6; dilevalol, n = 6). NE increased 3 h after the first oral dilevalol intake (p less than 0.05). This increase is greater than that due to the circadian variation observed in the placebo group. Acute dilevalol treatment seems to increase the plasma circulating NE level, which returns to normal values after 10 days of chronic treatment. Binding assays were performed before and after 10 days of treatment. In the placebo group, no change in beta-adrenoceptor density was observed (36.6 +/- 8.3 versus 38.3 +/- 9.4 femtomol/mg of protein). Lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor density (Bmax) significantly decreased after 10 days of dilevalol treatment without any changes in affinity (KD). Results were 40.3 +/- 11.6 (D1) and 30 +/- 7.6 (D10) (p less than 0.05). It was concluded that dilevalol down-regulated lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density, suggesting that beta 2 agonism of dilevalol is predominant.", 
    "85": "Dopamine has been widely utilized in the treatment of acute congestive heart failure, ibopamine, the diisobutyrate ester of N-methyldopamine (epinine), is a novel inotropic agent that, unlike-dopamine, is orally active. In clinical studies at doses that produce favorable hemodynamic responses, ibopamine and dopamine can evoke a slight and transient increase in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, an effect that is no longer apparent 1 h after administration. We have previously demonstrated in anesthetized dogs that this effect is due to stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors in the pulmonary circulation by dopamine and ibopamine, as well as by the active form of ibopamine, epinine. The aim of the present investigation was to determine how dopamine, ibopamine, and epinine interact with beta-adrenoceptors in the canine pulmonary circulation, since this activity may serve to offset the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses. Intraarterial injection of dopamine, ibopamine, and epinine resulted in dose-dependent pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses with a maximum increase of approximately 50-60% above resting pulmonary vascular tone. When animals were pretreated with propranolol (1 mg/kg iv) to block beta-adrenoceptors, pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to dopamine were unchanged, whereas pulmonary vasopressor responses to ibopamine and epinine were significantly potentiated, especially for epinine. Upon intraduodenal administration of a therapeutically effective dose of ibopamine (i.e. 36 mg/kg) to normal dogs, virtually no pulmonary pressor response was observed. However, administration of this same dose of ibopamine to dogs pretreated with propranolol (1 mg/kg iv) resulted in a marked pulmonary pressor response. These data indicate that epinine, and therefore the parent compound ibopamine, have the capacity to stimulate beta 2-adrenoceptors in the pulmonary circulation to a far greater degree than dopamine, and that this activity serves to offset, at least in part, the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated pulmonary vasoconstriction that occurs in response to ibopamine.", 
    "86": "In control conditions preoptic cAMP concentration during wakefulness was significantly higher than during synchronized sleep. No differences in nucleotide concentration were observed in the cerebral cortex. Propranolol decreases brain cAMP concentration. This change was associated with the suppression of the difference observed between wakefulness and synchronized sleep in the preoptic region.", 
    "87": "Propranolol induces basal achlorhydria in 30.7% of the patients, decreases significantly the HCl secretion in 42.3%, does not change it in 25% and increases it in 1.9%. After histamine stimulation (Kay test) propranolol decreases HCl in 57% and increases it in 43% of the cases. Propranolol induces a significant decrease of carbon anhydrase in the gastric mucosa. Serum gastrin is not significantly decreased after propranolol treatment. Isoprenaline increases the HCl secretion in all the patients investigated. Propranolol suppresses the effect of isoprenaline in 28.6% of the cases, decreases it in 33%, does not change it in 19% and increases it in 19%. The action of isoprenaline is not influenced by atropine, so the mechanism of action of the beta agonist is non-cholinergic. The gastric juice volume is not changed significantly by the blockage or stimulation of beta receptors. The beta adrenergic nervous system stimulates HCl secretion.", 
    "88": "Interactions between light-flash stimulation and electrical single impulse stimulation of locus coeruleus (LC) were investigated in 9 freely moving rats with chronically implanted electrodes during different behavioral states. The interaction of both showed different immediate and long-lasting effects. Simultaneous visual and electrical stimulation caused a clear decrease of trigger rate of photically evoked after-discharges from 60% to 15% and a reduction of the early primary component of visually evoked potentials (VEP) in area 17 compared with the values without LC stimulation during relaxed wakefulness (RW). On the contrary, the simultaneous LC stimulation was ineffective during exploratory behavioral states (E). At 100 ms stimulus interval and more there was no detectable LC stimulus effect on VEP components during RW, whereas the LC stimulation under beta-blockade (2.5 mg/kg propranolol i.p.) during RW-like behavior clearly reduced the early VEP component to 75% compared with values without LC stimulation. On the other hand, LC stimulation facilitated mainly the primary VEP component to about 160% during E compared with the flash response alone. This effect was observed from 100 to 300 ms after LC stimulus and was unaffected by muscarinic blockade (0.5 mg/kg scopolamine i.p.). We conclude from these data that the short-time effects are comparable with the influence of spontaneous behavioral activation and probably result from a costimulation of cholinergic neurons around LC, whereas the long-lasting effects may be attributed to the influence of noradrenergic LC cells. The noradrenergic-dependent facilitation of early VEP component counteracts the cholinergically-induced reduction."
