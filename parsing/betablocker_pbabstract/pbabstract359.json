    "0": "Isoproterenol-headup tilt table testing provides a diagnosis of neuromediated syncope in many patients who faint. The involvement of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in the provocation of syncope suggests that beta blockers might chronically prevent syncope. To assess this, a cohort of 153 syncope patients (age 39 +/- 20 years) underwent baseline assessment of demographic variables, symptomatic burden, and hemodynamic and clinical responses to tilt testing. Fifty-two patients then received beta blockers, and 101 did not receive drug therapy. The primary outcome was the time to the first recurrent syncopal spell. Actuarial survival analysis was used. Syncope recurred in 17 of 52 patients who received beta blockers and in 28 of 101 patients who were untreated. The actuarial probability of remaining free of syncope was similar in both groups. For example, the probability of remaining free of syncope 12 months following the tilt test was 0.72 in both populations. Thus, treatment with beta blockers may not have a significant effect in preventing syncope recurrence following a positive tilt test.", 
    "1": "Head-up tilt testing is a reliable diagnostic tool for patients with recurrent unexplained syncope. It has also been used to assess the drug efficacy for the treatment of patients with syncope. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of verapamil compared with metoprolol in a randomized crossover design for patients with syncope and a positive tilt test response. Twenty-eight patients with a positive head-up tilt test were randomized to receive either metoprolol or verapamil; the test was repeated after 7 days of therapy. Of the 15 patients initially given metoprolol, 2 (13.3%) did not respond; both were crossed over to verapamil, to which they remained unresponsive. Of the 13 patients who initially received verapamil, 8 (61%) did not respond; after crossing over to metoprolol therapy, 1 remained unresponsive. Overall, 20 of 23 patients receiving metoprolol had negative results on repeat tilt testing, whereas only 5 of 15 patients receiving verapamil had negative results (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that verapamil is considerably less efficacious than metoprolol in managing neurocardiogenic syncope.", 
    "2": "Initial assessment of widecomplex tachycardias (WCTs) should begin with patient history and physical examination. If there is a history of remote myocardial infarction, WCT should be considered as ventricular tachycardia until proved otherwise. In most cases, WCT is subsequently shown by electrophysiologic evaluation to be ventricular tachycardia. The presenting symptoms and degree of hemodynamic compromise should not be used to distinguish ventricular tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) should be carefully reviewed by looking for signs of ventricular tachycardia (atrioventricular dissociation, captured and fusion beats, certain QRS shapes and concordance). If the surface ECG is inconclusive, changing the position of V1 or use of a transesophageal lead may allow assessment of atrial activity. When more QRS than P waves are documented, the diagnosis is ventricular tachycardia. Cardioversion-defibrillation is required in patients with WCT who are in unstable condition. Atrioventricular node blockers are the agents of choice for arrhythmias that are atrioventricular node-dependent, but they may cause hemodynamic collapse if administered to patients with ventricular tachycardia or with atrial fibrillation and preexcitation. Lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine HCl IV), preferred for ventricular tachycardia, has been reported to cause ventricular fibrillation in patients with atrial fibrillation and preexcitation. When there is doubt about the diagnosis, elective electrical cardioversion may be considered. Medical therapy should consist of intravenous magnesium sulfate and procainamide hydrochloride (Pronestyl). A beta blocker may also be considered if more aggressive blockade of the atrioventricular node becomes necessary.", 
    "3": "The human beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) rapidly internalizes after binding agonist, resulting in a dramatic redistribution of receptors from the plasma membrane and into endocytic vesicles. We sought to determine whether intracellular receptors constitute a static pool or represent a fraction of dynamically internalizing and recycling receptors. Using cells expressing a beta 2AR with an epitope tag at its amino-terminal ectodomain, changes in surface receptor levels were measured by flow cytometry and radioligand binding assays. The addition of a saturating level of a strong agonist (isoproterenol) caused the endocytosis of receptors with first-order kinetics (ke for naive cells, 0.222 min-1). After 10 min, the level of surface receptors remained stable at approximately 20% that of untreated cells, even though endocytosis continued with similar kinetics (ke for pretreated cells, 0.258 min-1), suggesting that internalized receptors were cycling in steady state with surface receptors. This prediction was confirmed directly by showing that internalized beta 2ARs recycled to the cell surface in the continued presence of agonist. The calculated transit times (1/k) in the presence of isoproterenol were 3.9 min for endocytosis and 11.2 min for recycling. The endocytic rate constant and the steady state redistribution to the internal pool were much lower after treatment with the partial agonist albuterol, suggesting a correlation between the efficiency of endocytosis and that of receptor coupling to the downstream signal transduction pathway. These findings indicate that in the presence of agonist, beta 2ARs are in a dynamic steady state between the plasma membrane and endosomes that is regulated principally by agonist efficacy.", 
    "4": "Sustained stimulation of several G protein-coupled receptors is known to lead to a reduction in the signaling efficacy. This phenomenon, named agonist-induced desensitization, has been best studied for the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (AR) and is characterized by a decreased efficacy of beta-adrenergic agonists to stimulate the adenylyl cyclase activity. Recently, several beta-adrenergic ligands were found to inhibit the spontaneous agonist-independent activity of the beta 2AR. These compounds, termed inverse agonists, have different inhibitory efficacies, ranging from almost neutral antagonists to full inverse agonists. The current study was undertaken to determine whether, as is the case for agonists, desensitization can affect the efficacies of inverse agonists. Agonist-promoted desensitization of the human beta 2AR expressed in Sf9 cells potentiated the inhibitory actions of the inverse agonists, with the extent of the potentiation being inversely proportional to their intrinsic activity. For example, desensitization increased the inhibitory action of the weak inverse agonist labetalol by 29%, whereas inhibition of the spontaneous activity by the strong inverse agonist timolol was not enhanced by the desensitizing stimuli. Interestingly, dichloroisoproterenol acted stochastically as either a weak partial agonist or a weak inverse agonist in control conditions but always behaved as an inverse agonist after desensitization. These data demonstrate that like for agonists, the efficacies of inverse agonists can be modulated by a desensitizing treatment. Also, the data show that the initial state of the receptor can determine whether a ligand behaves as a partial agonist or an inverse agonist.", 
    "5": "Losartan, the first specific and orally available angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is a potent antihypertensive drug with a low incidence of side effects in humans. However, the effects of losartan on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism have not been investigated in detail. Therefore, we carried out a randomized, double-blind study to compare the effects of losartan (50 mg QD) and metoprolol (95 mg QD) on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, glucose tolerance, and lipids and lipoproteins in 20 hyperinsulinemic subjects with essential hypertension. The fall in blood pressure was greater with losartan than with metoprolol. Insulin sensitivity evaluated by the euglycemic clamp technique did not change in either group after 12 weeks of treatment. Similarly, glucose oxidation (losartan: 17.0 +/- 0.9 versus 16.9 +/- 1.0 mumol/kg per minute [before versus after, P = NS]; metoprolol: 17.9 +/- 1.3 versus 16.8 +/- 1.6 [P = NS]) and nonoxidation (losartan: 22.3 +/- 4.0 versus 23.5 +/- 3.4 mumol/kg per minute [P = NS]; metoprolol: 23.3 +/- 3.2 versus 25.6 +/- 4.7 [P = NS]) remained unchanged during the last 30 minutes of the 3-hour euglycemic clamp. Losartan and metoprolol did not have any significant adverse effects on insulin secretion, glucose tolerance, or lipids and lipoproteins. In conclusion, losartan is metabolically neutral, without any significant adverse effect on glucose and lipid metabolism.", 
    "6": "Terlipressin (Glypressin), a vasopressin analog, may be administered to patients with cirrhosis receiving a beta-adrenergic antagonist. Since terlipressin alone and beta-blockers alone both decrease portal pressure, a combination of these substances may have additional portal hypotensive effects. However, the negative side effects of terlipressin may be accentuated by long-term beta-blockade. Thus, the present study examined hemodynamic and metabolic responses to terlipressin in 12 patients receiving nonselective beta-blockers (propranolol or nadolol). Hemodynamics and oxygen (O2) -derived variables were measured prior to and 30 min after the administration (intravenous bolus) of terlipressin (1 to 2 mg, according to body weight). The hepatic venous pressure gradient and azygos blood flow significantly decreased (from 15.3 +/- 1.1 to 12.5 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, and from 0.6 +/- 0.1 to 0.5 +/- 0.1 liters/min, respectively). Arterial and pulmonary wedged pressures significantly increased. Heart rate, cardiac index, and O2 consumption were not significantly affected by terlipressin. In conclusion, in patients with cirrhosis being treated with a nonselective beta-blocker, terlipressin administration decreased portal pressure. Moreover, terlipressin induced only mild systemic hemodynamic effects in these patients. These results suggest that terlipressin can be administered in patients receiving a beta-adrenergic blocker.",

Slow-pathway ablation has been suggested to be the mechanism for this response.

We have studied the use of such imprints against drugs as artificial antibody-binding mimics in competitive radioimmuno-style binding assays. The recognition sites \"molded\" in the polymers mimic the binding sites of natural antibodies in their interactions with the target antigen. Binding constants are as low as 4.0 nmol/L for a small number of well-defined sites, and cross-reactivities are similar to or better than those observed with biological antibodies. In some cases, the polymers have been used to determine drug concentrations in human serum specimens.", 
    "17": "The entero-hepatic circulation of thyroid hormones is increased in thyrotoxic states. Based on this observation, the use of ionic exchange resins to bind thyroid hormones in the intestine has been tried. The present study evaluates the effectiveness of cholestyramine as an adjunctive therapy in the management of hyperthyroid Graves' disease. Thirty patients with newly diagnosed hyperthyroid Graves' disease were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: methimazole, propranolol and cholestyramine for 4 weeks (group I); methimazole and propranolol for 4 weeks (group II); methimazole, propranolol, and cholestyramine for 2 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of methimazole and propranolol (group III). At the end of the study, total and free T4 as well as T3 levels had decreased more in group I compared with group II: 61%, 78%, 68% in group I compared with 43%, 65%, 50% in group II (P = 0.037 for T4, P = 0.038 for free T4, P = 0.012 for T3). Group III behaved like group I while patients were receiving cholestyramine, but once the drug was discontinued, the rate of decline of thyroid hormones slowed down. We conclude that cholestyramine represents an effective and well-tolerated adjunctive therapy in patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease, and it produces a more rapid and complete decline in thyroid hormone levels in these patients.", 
    "18": "We determine whether the cyclic AMP signal transduction pathway affects phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element binding protein and increases muscle gene expression in the heart. Elevation of cyclic AMP results in phosphorylation of the binding protein which is detected using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated, but not the unphosphorylated, form. The protein is present, but not phosphorylated, within the nuclei of myocytes in intact neonatal rat hearts and in high-density cultures. It is not expressed in low-density cultures. Increasing the amount of phosphorylated cyclic AMP with either isoproterenol or forskolin also increases the frequency and force of the beating. The phosphorylated form of the response element binding protein is visible in the nuclei by 10 min and persists for 2 h of drug treatment. A 1.5-fold increase in skeletal alpha-actin and alpha-myosin gene expression is detected after 48 h of isoproterenol treatment. However, blockage of beating with a calcium channel blocker (verapamil) in the presence of cyclic AMP results in a similar increased gene expression. This suggests that muscle gene expression can be regulated directly by the cyclic AMP pathway, probably via phosphorylation of the cyclic AMP response element binding protein but independent of contractile activity.", 
    "19": "We demonstrated previously that glucocorticoids differentially affect the levels of the two pituitary gonadotropins, LH and FSH, both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, the effect of glucocorticoids is GnRH independent, indicating a direct action on the gonadotrope, and it leads to selective up-regulation of the pituitary content of FSH and FSH beta-subunit messenger RNA (mRNA). The objective of the present study was to confirm the direct action of corticosterone (B) on FSH beta-subunit mRNA in primary anterior pituitary cell culture and to assess whether the selective B-induced rise in FSH beta mRNA is mediated through altered stability of the FSH beta transcript. Anterior pituitary glands collected from randomly cycling female rats were dissociated with trypsin. Cells were incubated at 37 C for 48 h and subsequently exposed to vehicle or B (1.7 microM) for an additional 42 h. At the end of the incubation, media were sampled for FSH and LH, cells were lysed, and total RNA was isolated for Northern blot analysis. Exposure to B for 42 h caused direct and selective upregulation of FSH release, FSH content, and FSH beta mRNA; decreased alpha-subunit mRNA; and had no significant effect on LH release, LH content, or LH beta mRNA. To evaluate the mRNA stability of the three subunits, cells were exposed to the transcription blocker actinomycin D (act D; 5 micrograms/ml) for an additional 6 h. The combined 6-h treatment with B and act D slightly, but significantly, suppressed alpha-subunit mRNA and did not change LH beta mRNA, confirming a long half-life of the two gonadotropin subunit mRNAs. In contrast, FSH beta mRNA was significantly suppressed by act D to the same level in vehicle- and B-treated cells. The posttranscriptional decay rate was examined by sampling at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 h during the 6-h act D treatment period. Decay curves for FSH beta mRNA were parallel in vehicle- and B-treated cells, indicating that B did not alter FSH beta mRNA stability. We conclude that the selective B-induced rise in FSH beta mRNA is mediated at the level of transcription rather than mRNA stabilization.", 
    "20": "A method has been developed for the determination of total celiprolol (sum of enantiomers) or the enantiomers (R)-celiprolol and (S)-celiprolol in plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV and fluorescence detection. After extraction from alkalinized plasma with methyl-tert.-butyl ether and back-extraction into 0.01 M HCl (for total celiprolol determination) or after evaporation of the organic phase and derivatisation with R(-)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl isocyanate (enantiomer determination), total celiprolol or its diastereomeric derivatives were chromatographed on a reversed-phase HPLC column with a mixture of acetonitrile and phosphate buffer pH 3.5 (+0.05% triethylamine). Acebutolol was used as internal standard. Linearity was obtained in the range of 5 to 2000 ng/ml for total and 2.5 to 500 ng/ml for enantiomer determination. Intra-day and inter-day variation was lower than 10%. The method can be applied for analysis of plasma samples obtained from patients treated with oral racemic celiprolol doses.", 
    "21": "The role of ATP as a positive feedback element in Ca2+ signaling and secretion was examined in female rat pituitary gonadotrophs. ATP and ADP, but not AMP or adenosine, induced a dose- and extracellular Ca2+-dependent rise in [Ca2+]i in identified gonadotrophs in a Mg2+- and suramin-sensitive manner. ATP, adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), adenosine-5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate), 2-methylthio-ATP, and 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP were roughly equipotent in rising [Ca2+]i in gonadotrophs, while ADP was effective only at submillimolar concentration range, and none of these compounds permeabilized the cells. On the other hand, alpha,beta-methylene-ATP, beta,gamma-methylene-ATP, and UTP were unable to induce any rise in [Ca2+]i. This pharmacological profile is consistent with expression of P2X2 and/or P2X5 purinergic receptor channels. Patch-clamp experiments showed that ATP induced an inward depolarizing current in gonadotrophs clamped at -90 mV, associated with an increase in [Ca2+]i. The ATP-induced [Ca2+]i response was partially inhibited by nifedipine, a blocker of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCC), but was not affected by tetrodotoxin, a blocker of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels. Thus, the P2-depolarizing current itself drives Ca2+ into the cell, but also activates Ca2+ entry through VSCC. In accord with this, low [ATP] induced plasma membrane-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations in quiescent cells, and increased the frequency of spiking in spontaneously active cells. ATP-induced Ca2+ influx also affected agonist-induced and InsP3-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations by increasing the frequency, base line, and duration of Ca2+ spiking. In addition, ATP stimulated gonadotropin secretion and enhanced agonist-induced gonadotropin release. ATP was found to be secreted by pituitary cells during agonist stimulation and was promptly degraded by ectonucleotidase to adenosine. These observations indicate that ATP represents a paracrine/autocrine factor in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling and secretion in gonadotrophs, and that these actions are mediated by P2 receptor channels.", 
    "22": "Sotalol is a unique compound with several potential antiarrhythmic mechanisms, including beta blockade (class II activity), action potential duration prolongation (class III activity), and possibly reduction of QT dispersion. In recent years, trials such as the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) and the Electrophysiologic Study versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) trial reported disappointing results with the use of class I agents in the management of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery disease. These results have led to increased interest in class III antiarrhythmic agents, including sotalol. Sotalol is effective in suppressing ventricular premature complexes as well as nonsustained and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The interaction between sotalol and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) is generally favorable. As is the case with other antiarrhythmic drugs, there is no placebo-controlled trial assessing the effect of sotalol on mortality. It is not known if sotalol is more effective than placebo, conventional beta blockade, amiodarone, or ICDs in reducing mortality from life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, the optimal method of selecting patients for sotalol therapy has yet to be determined. The safety profile of sotalol has been well established in > 3,000 patients worldwide. Proarrhythmia occurs in approximately 4% of patients, and torsades de pointes occurs in approximately 2.5%. The majority of episodes of torsades de pointes occurs within 3 days of commencing sotalol therapy, and the risk of torsades de pointes increases sharply at dosages > 320 mg daily. It is recommended that initiation of sotalol therapy or dosage increases be performed in a monitored setting. Overall, only 1% of patients enrolled in clinical trials of sotalol discontinued therapy as a result of drug-related congestive heart failure. However, these trials have excluded patients with poor left ventricular systolic function and/or overt heart failure. The optimal management of these patients, who are at greatest risk of sudden cardiac death, and of patients with substrates other than coronary artery disease remains to be elucidated.", 
    "23": "In recent years, the results of large randomized and controlled trials of antiarrhythmic agents for primary and secondary prevention of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation have changed perceptions of the actions of antiarrhythmic agents regarding both efficacy and risk. The premature termination of the CAST trials of primary prevention in postinfarct patients highlighted the proarrhythmic risk and inefficacy of the sodium channel blockers (class I action), encainide, flecainide, and moricizine, in patients at relatively low risk for death in the long term. The excess mortality with therapy was attributed to proarrhythmia due to facilitation of reentry, especially during acute ischemia. About the same time, European trials with amiodarone, a complex agent with antiadrenergic action and powerful action to prolong refractoriness (class III action), indicated enhanced survival after infarction with amiodarone but not with agents with class I action. Recent verbal reports of larger and placebo-controlled trials (EMIAT and CAM-IAT) confirm a significant reduction in arrhythmia mortality, possibly with a favorable trend in total mortality. While an older trial with dl-sotalol (class III and beta-blocking actions) showed a trend toward improved survival after infarction, a recent trial with d-sotalol in patients with recent infarction or remote infarction and heart failure was prematurely terminated because of excess mortality attributed to proarrhythmia (torsades de pointes), indicating the importance of beta-blocking properties of a class III agent. A secondary prevention trial (ESVEM) in patients surviving an episode of VT or VF showed significant superiority of dl-sotalol compared to an array of agents that block sodium channels with respect to both efficacy and tolerance. Occurrence rates of arrhythmias treated with drugs tested for efficacy either by suppression of inducible arrhythmias or by suppression of spontaneous ectopy were higher and equivalent for both testing methods. A secondary prevention trial of amiodarone and multiple agents that block sodium channels in survivors of cardiac arrest (CASCADE) showed a significant increased efficacy of amiodarone but poorer long-term tolerance compared with the other agents. Comparative analysis of the results of the various trials suggests that class III action coupled with antiadrenergic action is more efficacious in both primary and secondary prevention of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and that lethal proarrhythmias may be the predominant effect in attempts at primary prevention in low-risk populations due to class I or so-called pure class III action.", 
    "24": "Antiarrhythmic drug therapy is in a state of continuous flux. In the last decade or so, numerous experimental and clinical studies have revealed that drugs that act by delaying conduction, while markedly suppressing ventricular arrhythmias, have the proclivity to increase mortality in subsets of patients with significant cardiac disease. The adverse impact on mortality was confirmed by placebo-controlled randomized trials as well as meta-analysis of smaller randomized clinical trials. The latter indicated that beta blockers exert a beneficial effect on mortality. Benefit from drugs that lengthen repolarization, especially drugs that have the additional property of blocking sympathetic excitation, was also seen in relatively small numbers of patients. Sotalol and amiodarone fell into this category of antiarrhythmic drugs. There were 2 major consequences that stemmed from the results of these trials. First, the endpoint of clinical trials shifted to total mortality from surrogates such as defined degree of suppression of ventricular arrhythmias. Second, concern regarding increases in mortality produced by class I drugs engendered a shift in favor of drugs that prolong repolarization. Such a shift was bolstered by the growing body of data that established the efficacy of sotalol and amiodarone as potent agents for the control of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. They were both found to be superior to class I agents. The perception that the critical factor that mediates their efficacy is the homogeneous prolongation of repolarization has led to the synthesis and characterization of so-called pure class III agents, which include d-sotalol and other lKr blockers such as dofetilide, sematilide, E-4031, and almokalant, among numerous others. The increase in mortality produced by d-sotalol in patients with myocardial infarction and lowered ejection fraction and in patients with and without heart failure has led researchers to question how to design future antiarrhythmic molecules. In the search for an ideal antifibrillatory agent, should emphasis be placed on simple molecules such as pure class III agents or on those with more complex profiles, such as sotalol and amiodarone, which exhibit antiadrenergic actions and the ability to prolong cardiac repolarization? The available data are in favor of the latter approach.", 
    "25": "We examined the effects of chronic sinoaortic denervation (SAD) on regional haemodynamic responses to acute environmental stress in rats. In conscious male intact (n = 12) and SAD (2 weeks before study, n = 7) rats, arterial pressure and blood flow velocities (pulsed Doppler probes) in the subdiaphragmatic aorta, superior mesenteric artery and distal aorta (hindquarters) were simultaneously recorded. In response to air jet stress, intact rats showed modest increases in arterial pressure that were accompanied by vasoconstriction in the mesentery and vasodilatation in the hindquarters. These regional haemodynamic changes were almost balanced, as indicated by the lack of change in the subdiaphragmatic aortic conductance. SAD markedly enhanced the pressor and mesenteric vasoconstrictor responses and blunted the hindquarters vasodilatation. After acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol, the stress-induced hindquarters vasodilatation was strongly reduced in the intact rats and was reversed into vasoconstriction in the SAD rats. These results point to an opposing interaction between centrally-induced sympathoexcitation and arterial baroreceptor reflex activation during stress. This probably favours the hyperaemic response in the skeletal muscles at a lower metabolic cost.", 
    "26": "The nodose ganglion contains the cell bodies of afferent nerves which convey predominantly sensory information from the viscera to the central nervous system (CNS). Autoradiographic studies show binding sites for beta-adrenoceptor ligands are present on sections of the rat nodose ganglion and also on the corresponding inferior vagal ganglion in humans, indicating the presence of beta-adrenoceptors in these ganglia. Since prolonged stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors in rats with the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (400 micrograms kg-1 day-1 s.c.) for 14 days results in desensitisation and/or down-regulation of receptors in peripheral tissues, such as heart, kidney and blood vessels, the effects of this treatment on the beta-adrenoceptor population on the nodose ganglion have been examined. Using [125I]-pindolol as a radioligand, autoradiographic studies revealed that specific binding was reduced by 74% in ganglia from isoprenaline-pretreated rats compared to that in ganglia from vehicle-pretreated rats, demonstrating down-regulation of receptors by isoprenaline. [125I]-Pindolol binding was sensitive to inhibition by ICI 118.551 (selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) but not to atenolol (selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist), indicating receptors are predominantly of the beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype. No change in binding was apparent over the vagus nerve. The nodose ganglion appears to be an additional site at which beta 2-adrenoceptors may be down-regulated in vivo, possibly interfering with normal baro-, chemo- and sensory reflexes.", 
    "27": "In Syrian hamsters, vasopressin (AVP) in the medial preoptic-anterior hypothalamus (MPOA-AH) controls a form of scent marking called flank marking. Another neurochemical signal that may interact with AVP to control flank marking is glutamate. We tested the hypothesis that glutamate interacts with AVP in the MPOA-AH to regulate flank marking. On day 1, AVP was microinjected into the MPOA-AH. On day 2, AVP was microinjected as a cocktail combining either AP-5, a NMDA antagonist, or GAMS, a non-NMDA antagonist or propranolol, a beta norepinephrine antagonist. On day 3, AVP alone was microinjected. Hamsters engaged in high levels of marking in response to AVP alone or to a combination of AVP and propranolol. In contrast, the frequency of marking was significantly reduced in response to a combination of either AVP and AP-5 or AVP and GAMS. These data support the hypothesis that stimulation of flank marking by AVP within the MPOA-AH requires the activity of glutamate.", 
    "28": "To investigate the molecular mechanism for stereospecific binding of agonists to beta 2-adrenergic receptors we used receptor models to identify potential binding sites for the beta-OH-group of the ligand, which defines the chiral center. Ser-165, located in transmembrane helix IV, and Asn-293, situated in the upper half of transmembrane helix VI, were identified as potential binding sites. Mutation of Ser-165 to Ala did not change the binding of either isoproterenol isomer as revealed after transient expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. In contrast, a receptor mutant in which Asn-293 was replaced by Leu showed substantial loss of stereospecific isoproterenol binding. Adenylyl cyclase stimulation by this mutant after stable expression in CHO cells confirmed the substantial loss of stereospecificity for isoproterenol. In a series of agonists the loss of affinity in the Leu-293 mutant receptor was strongly correlated with the intrinsic activity of the compounds. Full agonists showed a 10-30-fold affinity loss, whereas partial agonists had almost the same affinity for both receptors. Stereospecific recognition of antagonists was unaltered in the Leu-293 mutant receptor. These data indicate a relationship between stereospecificity and intrinsic activity of agonists and suggest that Asn-293 is important for both properties of the agonist-receptor interaction.",

In the present study, we examined the functional status of the IL-2R-associated Jak/STAT pathway in malignant T lymphocytes from advanced skin-based lymphomas: anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Sezary syndrome (SzS). Proliferation of three ALCL cell lines (PB-1, 2A, and 2B) was partially inhibited by rapamycin, a blocker of some of the signals mediated by IL-2R, but not by cyclosporin A, FK-506, and prednisone, which suppress signals mediated by the T-cell receptor. All the cell lines expressed on their surface the high-affinity IL-2R (alpha, beta, and gamma c chains). They showed basal, constitutive phosphorylation, and coassociation of Jak3, STAT5, and STAT3. Weak basal phosphorylation of IL-2R gamma c was also detected. In regard to SzS, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 10 of 14 patients showed basal phosphorylation of Jak3, accompanied by phosphorylation of STAT5 in 9 patients, and STAT3 in 4 patients. However, in vitro overnight culture of SzS cells without exogenous cytokines resulted in markedly decreased Jak3 and STAT5 phosphorylation, which could be reversed by stimulation with IL-2. This indicates that the basal phosphorylation of Jak3 and STAT5 in freshly isolated SzS cells is induced rather than constitutive. The basal activation of the Jak/STAT pathway involved in IL-2R signal transduction in ALCL and SzS cells reported here suggests that this pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, although the mechanism (induced versus constitutive) may vary between different lymphoma types.", 
    "30": "The primary objective of antihypertensive treatment is to prevent the involvement of target-organs, including hypertensive vascular disease of the kidney or left ventricular hypertrophy. Antihypertensive treatment should not worsen other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. lipids) or impair quality of life. Contemporary efforts to optimize antihypertensive therapy are focused on single-drug therapy and on individualizing treatment according to patients age, sex, race and the presence of concomitant illnesses and therapies, in order to improve compliance and reduce overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Several antihypertensive drugs such as ACE-inhibitors, beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, alpha-adrenergic-receptor antagonists, and newer substances such as imidazoline-receptor antagonists and angiotensin-II antagonists are discussed.", 
    "31": "A new (radio)iodinated, beta-adrenoceptor ligand, (S)-(-)-4-[3-[(1,1-dimethyl-3-iodo-(2E)-propenyl)-amino]-2- hydroxypropoxy]carbazole (CYBL8E, 1), was prepared. 1 is an iodinated analogue of the high-affinity beta-adrenoceptor antagonist carazolol (2). The asymmetric synthesis was achieved in four steps starting from 4-hydroxycarbazole. The iodine-123-labeled form was obtained by an iododestannylation reaction with [123I]NaI in the presence of H2O2. Using classical in vitro displacement experiments with membrane fractions of cardiac left ventricular muscle, 1 proved to have a high affinity for the receptor (Ki = 0.31 +/- 0.03). Biodistribution studies performed in New Zealand white rabbits demonstrated the specificity of the binding in vivo to the receptor. Uptake of [123I]1 was reduced significantly in both atrial muscle, left ventricular muscle, frontal cortex, cerebellum, and striatum, by the pretreatment of the animals with different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. In conclusion, 1 is a potent nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, which binds specifically to the beta-adrenoceptor in vivo, and is therefore a promising radioligand for the imaging of beta-adrenoceptors using single photon emission computerized tomography.", 
    "32": "Alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation of human airway epithelial cells induces a transient increase in polyphosphoinositide turnover coincident with augmented Na+Cl-(K+) cotransport activity. This activation of airway epithelial cells also results in a biphasic elevation of diacylglycerols. To better understand the significance of these distinct diacylglycerol pools, we now characterize the mass of ether- and ester-linked diacylglycerol species. We demonstrate that the relative mass of ether-linked diacylglycerols is reduced in airway epithelium from cystic fibrosis patients in the presence or absence of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation. This reduction in ether-linked diacylglycerol mass may represent a compensatory mechanism to help maintain normal chloride influx in cystic fibrosis patients.",

The PET imaging protocol consisted of 15O2 emission (OEF and MMRO2), transmission, [15O]CO emission (blood pool), and [15O]CO2 emission (myocardial blood flow: MBF(pets) mL.min-1.g-1) scans. OEF was calculated from the PET data (OEFpet) by three different analytical techniques: steady-state, 5-minute, and 8-minute autoradiographic analyses. Reference measurements of MBF (MBFref) and OEF (OEFref) were obtained during 15O2 inhalation with radiolabeled microspheres and paired arterial and coronary sinus blood sampling, respectively. MMRO2 was calculated from the PET (MMRO2pet) and the reference (MMRO2ref) data as follows: MMRO2 = OEF x MBF x (O2 content of arterial blood). OEF measured by the steady-state PET method was well correlated with the reference data over the range 0.16 to 0.73 (OEFpet = 1.03 OEFref -0.01, r = .97), as was MMRO2 over the range 2.4 to 27.5 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1 (MMRO2pet = 0.98 MMRO2ref +0.91, r = .94). OEFpet calculated by use of the 5-minute and 8-minute autoradiographic analyses were equally well correlated with the reference measurements (r = .95 and r = .97, respectively). There were no significant differences between values of MMRO2pet calculated by use of the steady-state, 5-minute, and 8-minute autoradiographic analyses (P = NS by ANOVA).

Cardiac mRNAs were examined by Northern blot analysis. In TGR(mRen2)27, left ventricular hypertrophy was associated with a decrease in alpha-myosin heavy chain expression of 31% and an increase in skeletal alpha-actin and atrial natriuretic polypeptide expression by 2.6- and 21-fold, respectively (P < .05), thereby showing the shift of myocardium to a fetal phenotype. Furthermore, cardiac collagen and laminin expressions were increased in TGR(mRen2)27 (P < .05), suggesting the occurrence of cardiac remodeling. Although treatment of TGR(mRen2)27 with a high dose of TCV-116 (angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist) or manidipine (calcium antagonist) combined with atenolol (beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocker) completely normalized blood pressure, TCV-116 regressed cardiac hypertrophy and suppressed the changes in cardiac mRNA levels of TGR(mRen2)27 much more potently than manidipine with atenolol. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of a low dose of TCV-116 on cardiac hypertrophy and altered gene expressions of TGR(mRen2)27 were greater than those of doxazosin (alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocker) combined with atenolol, despite their similar hypotensive effects.",

Transmitral Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate diastolic function in 77 patients randomly assigned to placebo (n = 37) or metoprolol (n = 40). The patients were treated for 12 months. Changes in Doppler flow variables in the metoprolol group implied a less restrictive filling pattern, expressed as an increase in E-wave deceleration time (placebo, 185 +/- 126 to 181 +/- 64 ms; metoprolol, 152 +/- 63 to 216 +/- 78 ms; P = .01, placebo versus metoprolol). Maximal increase in deceleration time had occurred by 3 months, whereas systolic recovery was achieved gradually and maximal effect was seen by 12 months of treatment. Although deceleration time was correlated to heart rate at baseline, changes in deceleration time were not significantly correlated to changes in heart rate during treatment.",

Positron emission tomographic measurement of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose myocardial distribution also was made. Adenosine blood flow in segments that contracted normally at peak dobutamine was similar to that of segments that became hypokinetic (1.06 +/- 0.72 versus 1.02 +/- 0.77 mL.g-1.min-1). Segments that became akinetic failed to augment blood flow (0.68 +/- 0.30 mL.g-1.min-1). Fluorodeoxyglucose-blood flow mismatch was more common in segments with abnormal wall motion at peak dobutamine (24 of 59, 41%) versus those that contracted normally (63 of 269, 23%; chi 2, 7.40; P < .01). In patients off beta-blockers, segments that contracted normally at peak dobutamine increased blood flow with adenosine (0.70 +/- 0.31 to 0.86 +/- 0.46 mL.g-1.min-1; P < .05), whereas those that became abnormal did not (0.63 +/- 0.24 to 0.65 +/- 0.19 mL.g-1.min-1; P = NS). Segments of patients on beta-blockers that contracted normally at peak dobutamine increased blood flow with adenosine (0.78 +/- 0.31 to 1.10 +/- 0.70 mL.g-1.min-1; P < .05), as did segments that became abnormal (0.74 +/- 0.34 to 1.06 +/- 0.82 mL.g-1.min-1; P = NS). However, segments adjacent to ones with abnormal wall motion at rest had higher frequency of abnormal response at peak dobutamine in groups on (48% versus 16%; chi 2, 14.1; P < .001) and off (51% versus 21%; chi 2, 10.9; P < .01) beta-blockers.", 
    "44": "Augmented contraction at maximal dobutamine depends not only on increased myocardial blood flow but also on tethering, metabolic, and beta-blocker status.

    "45": "In individual pancreatic beta-cells the rise of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), induced by 11 mM glucose, is manifested either as oscillations (0.2-0.5 min-1) or as a sustained elevation. The significance of the plasma membrane permeability of Ca2+ and K- for the establishment of these slow oscillations was investigated by dual wavelength microfluorometric measurements of [Ca2+]i in individual ob/ob mouse beta-cells loaded with fura-2. Increasing the extracellular Ca2+ to 10 mM or the addition of Ca2+ channel agonist BAY K 8644 (1 microM) or K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium+ (TEA: 10-20 mM) caused steeper rises and higher peaks of the glucose-induced oscillations. However, when extracellular Ca2+ was lowered to 0.5 mM the oscillations were transformed into a sustained suprabasal level. When the beta-cells exhibited glucose-stimulated sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i in the presence of a physiological Ca2+ concentration (1.3 mM), it was possible to induce slow oscillations by promoting the entry of Ca2+ either by raising the extracellular Ca2+ concentration to 10 mM or adding TEA or BAY K 8644. The results indicate that glucose-induced slow oscillations of [Ca2+]i depend on the closure of ATP-regulated K+ channels and require that the rate of Ca2+ influx exceeds a critical level. Apart from an inherent periodicity in ATP production it is proposed that Ca(2+)-induced ATP consumption in the submembrane space contributes to the cyclic changes of the membrane potential determining periodic entry of Ca2+.",

The results showed that (1) the endothelium-independent relaxation due to beta-agonism was more significant in BA than that in RA; (2) there was no alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction in most of the BA, only a small part of BA showed constriction in response to alpha 1-agonism, but with low affinity and efficacy and a desensitization tendency; (3) no response to alpha 2-agonist BHT 920 (10(-3) mol/L) in BA was shown, either in the presence or absence of endothelium. But in RA there was relaxation in the presence of endothelium and constriction in its absence. The above results suggest that there is a scarce distribution of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, but an abundant distribution of beta-adrenoceptor in basilar artery compared with that in renal artery. The alpha 1-subtype in BA is different from the alpha 1-subtype in RA, and the alpha 2-receptor which mediates direct smooth muscle constriction and endothelium-dependent relaxation is highly heterogeneous between basilar and renal arteries.",

Most of the studies showed that long-term treatment of heart failure with beta-blockade produces improvement in symptoms, exercise tolerance, ejection fraction and central hemodynamics (CI, PCWP, MPAP, LVSWI, SVI). Treatment must be started at an extremely low dose and then must be increased gradually to therapeutic levels over several weeks. The titration phase must take place in the hospital. It was emphasized that the management of chronic heart failure with beta-blockers is not the routine management yet. Ongoing multicenters trials should finally determine the place of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure.", 
    "56": "Differentiation of binding sites of CGP12177 and carteolol to the beta-adrenoceptors in the guinea-pig taenia caecum was investigated. Carteolol and CGP12177 competitively antagonized the relaxation responses to isoprenaline, and the pA2 values were 9.87 and 9.33, respectively. Butoxamine, a beta 2-selective antagonist, caused competitive antagonism of the relaxant responses to carteolol, and the pA2 value for butoxamine was 6.22. However, butoxamine (10(-4) M) did not significantly affect the relaxant responses to CGP12177. CGP12177 caused competitive antagonism of the relaxant responses to carteolol, and the pA2 value for CGP12177 was 9.32. However, carteolol (10(-6) M) did not significantly affect the relaxant responses to CGP12177. The competitive inhibition curve for specific binding of 50 nM [3H]befunolol by carteolol showed a biphasic shape, although the curve by CGP12177 was monophasic. Moreover, the competitive inhibition curve for specific binding of 100 nM [3H]CGP12177 by CGP12177 showed a biphasic shape, although the curve by carteolol indicated partial inhibition. These results suggest that the low affinity site of beta-adrenoceptor and beta 3-adrenoceptors are different from each other.", 
    "57": "Lungs from near-term fetal guinea pigs (61 +/- 2 days of gestation) were supported in vitro for 3 h; lung liquid production was monitored by a dye dilution method. Untreated preparations produced lung liquid with no significant changes (ANOVA; regression analysis) (rates in successive hours, initial study: 1.37 +/- 0.30, 1.36 +/- 0.30, and 1.28 +/- 0.27 mL.kg-1 body weight.h-1; n = 6). Preparations given acetylcholine at 10(-4) (n = 6), 10(-5) (n = 6), and 10(-6) M (n = 18) during the middle hour showed marked and significant fluid reabsorption (p < 0.025-0.0005); 10(-8) M acetylcholine was without effect. Reductions were linearly related to log concentration of acetylcholine (r = 0.97; theoretical threshold, 1.0 x 10(-7) M acetylcholine). Atropine, at 10(-5) M, greatly reduced responses to acetylcholine, and all reabsorptions were abolished; 10(-4) M atropine completely abolished all responses to acetylcholine; atropine alone had no effect (based on 48 studies). The alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist phentolamine (1.78 x 10(-5) M) abolished the effects of 10(-6) M acetylcholine, but had no effect alone (based on 48 studies); the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol (10(-5) M) had no effect on responses to 10(-6) M acetylcholine (based on 24 studies). It is suggested that acetylcholine at physiological levels can produce lung liquid reabsorption by activating muscarinic receptors and releasing catecholamines within the lungs; these catecholamines act via alpha-receptors. This raises the possibility of neural controls of lung liquid reabsorption during the early stages of delivery or neonatal life.", 
    "58": "1. The effects of catecholamines and some adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on isolated preparations of human colonic smooth muscle obtained from surgical resections were examined. 2. Strips of circular smooth muscle displayed rhythmic myogenic spontaneous contractions which were inhibited by catecholamines with an order of potency of isoprenaline (1.0) > noradrenaline (0.32) > adrenaline (0.2). Phentolamine (0.7 microM) significantly shifted the noradrenaline concentration-response curve (CRC) to the right but had no significant effect on isoprenaline or adrenaline. Propranolol (1 microM) significantly shifted the isoprenaline to the right but had no significant effect on noradrenaline or adrenaline. 3. Salbutamol (30 microM) had no inhibitory effect on the spontaneous activity and ICI 118,551 (1 microM) had no effect on inhibitory responses to isoprenaline. Betaxolol (1 microM) significantly shifted the CRC to isoprenaline to the right. BRL 37344 had no effect on spontaneous activity. 4. Responsiveness of circular strips to catecholamines was not affected by age of the patient and no consistent differences between males and females were shown. 5. Strips of taenia coli exhibited little or no spontaneous phasic activity. Noradrenaline and isoprenaline relaxed KCl-induced tone. The effects of noradrenaline and isoprenaline were antagonized by propranolol but not by phentolamine. BRL 37344 had no effect on KCl-induced tone. 6. In conclusion, catecholamines relaxed spontaneous activity of human colon circular smooth muscle through an action on both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. The alpha-adrenoceptors were of the alpha 1-subtype. The beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation appeared to be primarily beta 1. In taenia coli, catecholamines relaxed KCl-induced tone via beta-adrenoceptors only.",

In the rat isolated distal colon and oesophagus, relaxant responses to (-)-isoprenaline were poorly antagonized by propranolol (0.1 microM), suggesting an involvement of beta 3-adrenoceptors. 2. In the presence of propranolol the rank order of potency for the agonist-induced relaxations was similar in the two tissues. 3. BRL 37344 was a partial agonist relative to isoprenaline in the colon but when a single maximal concentration of BRL 37344 (1 microM) was added, a full relaxation was observed. 4. BRL 37344 desensitized responses to isoprenaline in both the colon and oesophagus. 5. (+/-)-Cyanopindolol (1.0 microM) antagonized the relaxatory responses to both isoprenaline and BRL 37344 in the distal colon and oesophagus and reduced the desensitizing effect of BRL 37344. 6. The present study demonstrates that the beta-adrenoceptors mediating relaxation in both the rat isolated distal colon and oesophagus are of the beta 3-adrenoceptor subtype. Desensitization appears to result from the binding of BRL 37344 to the beta 3-adrenoceptor in a manner which is blockable by cyanopindolol.",

Several studies have shown that, in patients without a contraindication to these drugs, betablockers reduce the mortality and recurrence of infarction by about 25%. The best results observed in the subgroup of patients with criteria of severity (previous myocardial infarction or cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, residual ischaemia, occluded artery or triple vessel disease) has been shown in the APSI and BHAT studies where the reduction in mortality was almost 50% in the subgroup of patients with cardiac failure.

France is a zone at low risk even if deaths of undetermined causes are taken into account. This gradient is confirmed by the data from the Registries of the MONICA project. In France, the official mortality figures show a decrease of 28% in coronary mortality between 1985 and 1991 in men, throughout France. The differences in incidence of myocardial infarction between Lille and Toulouse in the MONICA project are not important but the differences in mortality are worrying. Between 1985 and 1991, the three registries show a 7% decrease in mortality (p < 0.001) and a 25% decrease in recurrences (p < 0.001) with an increase in primary infarcts of 8.3% (p < 0.05). There has been an increase in the prescription of betablockers, thrombolytics, ACE inhibitors and aspirin during the acute phase and at discharge form hospital. French cardiologists have followed the recommendations of the large scale clinical trials published during this period. The improved hospital mortality corresponds to the beneficial results reported in trials with aspirin, betablockers, ACE inhibitors and thrombolytics.",

To study the impact of early lesions on 5-HT1B sites as putative 5-HT terminal autoreceptors, we labelled them autoradiographically with [3H]5-HT 4 months after intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intracisternal (i.c.) 5,7-DHT injection during the first postnatal week and quantitated specific binding in 22 brain regions. Changes were confined to the subiculum and substantia nigra, regions with the most 5-HT1B-specific binding and projection areas of structures with high mRNA expression. Both routes of 5,7-DHT injection were associated with increases in specific binding in subiculum (24% for i.p. and 47% for i.c. route). In contrast, there was a 32% increase in specific binding in the substantia nigra in rats with lesions made i.c. but not i.p. No significant differences were found in nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen or other brain areas. In saturation homogenate binding studies of 5-HT1B sites using [125I]iodocyanopindolol 1 month after i.p. injections, neonatal 5,7-DHT lesions did not significantly alter Bmax or Kd in the neocortex, striatum, diencephalon or brainstem. These data indicate the differential effects of the route of neonatal 5,7-DHT injections on plasticity of 5-HT1B receptor recognition sites and suggest the presence of a subpopulation of post-synaptically located 5-HT1B sites which increases in response to denervation. The data also suggest that sprouting of 5-HT neurons after neonatal 5,7-DHT lesions does not involve 5-HT1B sites.", 
    "63": "[[3-(alkylamine)-2-hydroxypropyl]-2-oximino]pyridines and O-[3-(alkylamine)-2-hydroxypropyl]methylpyridine ketone oximes 5a-o were synthesized by a solid-liquid phase-transfer reaction, and their beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The replacement of the aryl linked to the oximic carbon of the (methylenaminoxy)methyl moiety with the bioisoster pyridine ring produced a decrease of the beta-adrenergic blocking activity. The polarization of the oximic group, derived from the electron-withdrawing action of the nitrogen atom, is more evident for the 2-oxyminopyridine derivative 5d. But also conformational parameters may play an important role in the variation of activity of the compounds 5d, 5l and 5n. The replacement of the hydrogen linked to the oximic carbon with a methyl group increased the activity of the compounds 5a, 5i, 5m and 5o. The methyl could allow a delocalization of the partial positive charge present on the oximic carbon, but also its lipophilicity contributed to the increment of binding to the receptor site. None of the compounds showed high beta 1 or beta 2 selectivity in vitro. The (R) and (S) isomers of the compound 5a were synthesized and obtained with enantiomeric ratio 7:3 and 6:4, respectively.

    "65": "In 7 patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurring in the previous 30 days, we investigated forearm vascular reactivity to lower body negative pressure (LBNP), by the strain gauge plethysmography with simultaneous administration of negative pressure around the lower limbs. This manoeuvre has then been repeated after 10 days of oral beta-blocker therapy (propanolol 160 mg/die). A significant flow reduction derived from LBNP associated to plethysmography with respect to plethysmography alone, but this significant difference was suppressed by propranolol treatment, that prevented the reflex decrease in forearm blood flow, (forearm blood flow from 5.97 to 3.85 ml/min/100 ml in wash-out vs 5.64 to 5.75 ml/min/100 ml during propranolol treatment). We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to the desensitizing effect of propranolol on cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors (CPB), with the consequent loss or reduction of their functional inhibition for the efferent sympathetic outflow towards resistance vessels in skeletal muscle. Therefore, LBNP does not elicit forearm reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction, because pressure unloading of CPB areas is no longer able to modify sympathetic discharge, since the influence on it of baroreceptor activity has already been weakened by prolonged beta-blockade. Thus, the LBNP low levels, by ruling out and/or by removing the CPB activity are theorically able to elicit sympathetic \"disinhibition\", and to exercise, consequently, a reflex, vasoconstrictor influence upon the forearm vascular bed, whereas the same reflex behaviour by forearm resistance vessels does not appear feasible if the CPB activity has been preventively minimized by prolonged, chronic beta-blockade.",

Contact sensitization was determined by measuring the ear swelling response to application of 1% drug in vehicle. Control mice treated by application of vehicle alone did not exhibit an ear swelling response to drug. Supplementation of the mice with vitamin A boosted the ear swelling response, as did application of drug to dorsal versus abdominal skin. Although plasma amounts of retinol were higher in vitamin A supplemented versus control mice, the rate of drug (albuterol and nadolol) permeation was not significantly different between vitamin A supplemented and control mice. Permeability of dorsal skin for nadolol was twice that of ventral skin, which may explain the differences in sensitization at these sites. This sensitization protocol should be useful in the development of hypoallergenic transdermal drug delivery systems.", 
    "67": "Contractile responses to serotonin (5-HT) of fundic smooth muscle strips isolated from both control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were investigated. Contrary to carbachol (CCh) which causes contractile hyperactivity in DM, 5-HT response tended to decrease in DM compared to that of the control. Pindolol (10(-5)M) increased the value of EC50 of the concentration-response to 5-HT about 2.5 times in both the control and DM. After treatment with pindolol, the maximal tension to 5-HT in DM significantly decreased compared to that of the control. Pindolol showed no effect on the contractile response to CCh. Pindolol significantly inhibited the relaxation caused by isoproterenol in DM more than in the control. Mianserin (10(-5) M) increased the EC50 of the response to 5-HT about 2-2.5 times in both groups, but did not cause a significant difference between the control and DM. The Ca(2+)-induced contraction caused hyperreactivity in DM in the presence of 10(-6) M CCh, but that in DM was not significantly different from the control in the presence of 10(-6) M 5-HT. Pretreatment of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10(-5) M) significantly attenuated the response to 5-HT in the control, but not in DM. Results suggest that the contractile response to 5-HT in DM is related to the altered Ca2+ signal transduction system via disturbed protein kinase C (PKC) activity, and that there are alterations of receptor characteristics and of the density in 5-HT receptor subtypes, especially 5-HT1A, during DM development.", 
    "68": "Blood pressure changes in response to intravenous drug administration were examined in a respirator-dependent 49-year-old patient with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who developed severe hypertensive attacks. She showed severe hypertension and tachycardia during the daytime and nocturnal hypotension without compensatory tachycardia, which were consistent with the autonomic phenomenon reported in ALS patients. Infusion of phenotolamine (2.5 mg) induced an abrupt 90 mmHg decrease in systolic pressure and slight increase in heart rate. Propranolol (1 mg) infusion induced decreases in both systolic pressure (36 mmHg) and heart rate (17 beats/min), although the pressure decrease was transient while the heart rate remained at the decreased level Infusion of diazepam (10 mg) induced a 47 mmHg decrease in systolic pressure and a 23 beats/min increase in heart rate. These vasomotor responses indicate the distinct participation of abnormally augmented sympathetic tone, and especially of alpha-sympathetic hyperactivity rather than of beta-sympathetic hyperactivity, in the hypertensive attacks occurring in this ALS patient.", 
    "69": "For the bulbar ALS/MND patient with dysphagia, the accumulation of oral secretions is a distressing problem. The control of these secretions, particularly the thick mucus form, is very difficult. In approaching this problem it is important to realise that the source of these secretions is not just from the oral salivary glands. The nose and lungs also contribute a constant flow of serous and particularly mucoid fluids. The neural control of these different forms of secretion is of importance in controlling them. Stimulation of cholinergic receptors produces thin serous secretions whereas beta adrenergic receptors produce thick protein and mucus-rich secretions. Therefore 16 bulbar ALS/MND patients were treated with beta antagonists after maximising other therapy. 75% of this group had fast and significant relief from their thick secretions. It is therefore proposed to perform a large controlled trial of beta blockers in the control of thick oral secretions in ALS/MND based on these promising pilot data.", 
    "70": "The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study evaluated the feasibility of carrying out a randomized, multicenter, 7-year clinical trial to determine the effects of two goal levels of blood pressure control and three antihypertensive drug regimens on decline in glomerular filtration rate in African Americans with clinically diagnosed hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Participants were randomized to either a usual mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) goal group (102-107 mm Hg) or a low-MAP goal group (< or = 92 mm Hg) and to a drug regimen (initial therapy with either atenolol, amlodipine, or enalapril). Quality of life was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 36 (MOS SF-36) at baseline and the last follow-up visit for 84 of the 94 participants of the AASK Pilot Study. Symptoms were assessed at baseline and throughout the course of therapy by participant self-report. Mean SF-36 scores increased significantly on physical functioning (9.2), role limitations (physical) (19.0), social functioning (9.0), and vitality dimensions (5.6) from baseline to the last follow-up visit in the usual MAP goal group. Scores for the eight health dimensions assessed by the MOS SF-36 did not change significantly during the same time period either in the low-MAP goal group or in any of the drug regimens. The mean score for general health perception was significantly lower at the last follow-up visit in the enalapril drug regimen (49.9) compared to drug regimens with atenolol (65.4) or amlodipine (63.9). Physical functioning, role limitations (emotional), social functioning, mental health, vitality, and general health perception scores were negatively correlated with self-reported symptoms during treatment. We conclude that selected dimensions of quality of life improved during the AASK Pilot Study only in participants randomized to the usual MAP goal group. Significant differences between MAP goal groups and drug regimens at the end of follow-up were observed for only a few health dimensions.", 
    "71": "Hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, especially among African Americans. The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study evaluated the feasibility of conducting a long-term clinical trial to compare the effects of two levels of blood pressure control and three different antihypertensive drug regimens on the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in African Americans with clinically diagnosed hypertensive renal disease. African American men and women aged 18-70 years with a GFR of 25-70 ml/min/ 1.73m2 and hypertension were randomized in a 3 x 2 factorial design to initial treatment with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), or a beta blocker (atenolol) and to a mean arterial blood pressure (goal MAP) of either 102-107 mm Hg or < or = 92 mm Hg. Furosemide, doxazosin, clonidine, hydralazine, and minoxidil were added sequentially until goal MAP was achieved. To compare the pathologic diagnosis with the clinical diagnosis of renal disease, study participants without contraindication were also asked to undergo a renal biopsy. The goals of the AASK Pilot Study were to evaluate recruitment techniques, adherence to prescribed antihypertensive drug regimens, ability of the antihypertensive regimens to achieve blood pressure goals, rates of participation in scheduled clinic visits and procedures, and variability of GFR measurements. A further goal was to obtain renal biopsy data in at least 75% of the randomized study participants. Compared to the ESRD patient population whose renal disease is caused by hypertension, women were underrepresented in the AASK Pilot Study. AASK Pilot Study participants had higher unemployment rates and lower income levels than African Americans in the general U.S. population.", 
    "72": "Glucose homeostasis is maintained by a balance between the release and action of insulin, and the counterregulatory responses mediated principally by glucagon, catecholamines, growth hormone and cortisol. Hence, the effects of a drug on glucose metabolism may be mediated by any of these agents singly or in combination. Host factors, such as inherent glucoregulatory mechanisms, concurrent diseases, organ function and concomitant medications also increase the risk of drug-induced disturbances of glucose homeostasis in susceptible individuals. By far the most important agents causing hypoglycaemia are insulin and the sulphonylureas. Alcohol (ethanol), over-zealous glycaemic control, hypoglycaemic unawareness, detective counterregulation especially in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and renal and liver impairment are all important predisposing factors. Although antihyperglycaemic agents such as metformin and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors do not cause hypoglycaemia alone, they may enhance the hypoglycaemic effects of potent hypoglycaemic agents such as insulin and sulphonylureas. On the other hand, the potential hypoglycaemic effects of ACE inhibitors, alpha-blockers, lipid-lowering agents and recombinant human insulin-like growth factor demonstrated in experimental settings, are of potential therapeutic interest. Iatrogenic hypoglycaemia and intensive insulin treatment are associated with hypoglycaemic unawareness which may be obviated by meticulous avoidance of hypoglycaemia. Effective patient education remains an important preventive measure. Oral glucose is used to treat mild hypoglycaemic episodes while more severe episodes are treated by intravenous glucose or glucagon. Nasal glucagon and theophylline are other experimental measures to improve recovery from hypoglycaemia. In refractory hypoglycaemia due to hyperinsulinaemia such as during sulphonylurea overdosage or quinine treatment, the long-acting somatostatin, octreotide, may suppress insulin release and restore euglycaemia. Diuretics, beta-blockers, sympathomimetics, corticosteroids and sex hormones are commonly prescribed drugs which may have adverse effects on carbohydrate metabolism especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or those who are at risk of developing glucose intolerance. Pentamidine was frequently associated with dysglycaemia due to its pancreatic beta-cell cytotoxic effects but is now used less often to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients. Despite the large number of anecdotal reports of drug-induced disturbances of glucose metabolism, many of the so-called adverse drug reactions were either idiosyncratic or coincidental. Nevertheless, they emphasise the complex nature of glucose homeostasis and its potential interactions with drugs, host factors and disease states. An understanding of these relationships may allow more critical interpretation of these clinical observations, better prediction of drug induced adverse effects on carbohydrate metabolism and the implementation of more rational therapy. Hence, the hypoglycaemic effects of a drug may be turned to a therapeutic advantage in patients with glucose intolerance. Similarly, the hyperglycaemic effect of a drug may help to treat refractory hypoglycaemia.", 
    "73": "Twenty patients with primary open angle glaucoma who have been treated with identical antiglaucoma eye drops in both eyes were examined. Silicone punctal plugs were used to occlude the inferior punctum of one eye, in order to block the nasolacrimal canal. The intraocular pressures and effects of the medical therapy before and after punctal occlusion were compared. Punctal occlusion significantly decreased the intraocular pressure with an average of 2.00 +/- 0.43 mmHg in the plugged eyes (p < 0.001). The intraocular pressure in the unplugged control eyes did not change significantly (p > 0.05) after punctal occlusion of the fellow treated eye.", 
    "74": "Treatment of adult rats with a single dose of nerve growth factor (NGF, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) results in a prolonged hypersensitivity to noxious thermal stimulation which becomes noticeable within 30 min of administration and lasts for several days. A significant mechanical hyperalgesia develops within 7 h following injection of NGF and persists for up to 7 days. In the present set of experiments we describe certain quantitative features of this hyperalgesia. The initial thermal hyperalgesia can be highly variable and is associated to some degree with the presence of an overt immunologic reaction. The mechanical hyperalgesia is reproducible enough to reveal a clear dependency on the dose of NGF. We also examined the pharmacological properties of the NGF-induced hyperalgesia. The bradykinin BK1 receptor antagonist des-Arg9[Leu8]BK transiently blocked the thermal hyperalgesia when injected 1 day after NGF administration whereas mechanical thresholds were further reduced under this protocol. The BK2 antagonist HOE 140 had no effect on this late NGF-induced hyperalgesia. Injection of the neurokinin NK1 receptor antagonist CP-96345 or its inactive enantiomer CP-96344 one day after NGF both induced a transient block of NGF-induced thermal hyperalgesia indicating a non-specific effect rather than an action at NK1 receptors. This was confirmed by finding no reversal of NGF-induced hyperalgesia by RP67580, another NK1 receptor blocker. These results suggest upregulation and activation of BK1 but not NK1 receptors as an additional, probably peripheral, mechanism for the late phase of NGF-induced thermal hyperalgesia.", 
    "75": "Most clinicians are still unacquainted with the beneficial effects of neurostimulation as an additional therapeutic strategy for severe angina pectoris. Patients with therapeutically refractory angina pectoris suffer from chest discomfort during minimal exercise, despite maximal tolerated antianginal drug therapy (at least 2 out of a beta-blocker, calcium-antagonist or long-acting nitrate). In these patients, revascularization procedures, such as a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, are often technically impossible because of diffuse coronary artery disease or should be withheld as a consequence of absolute contraindications such as severe left ventricular dysfunction. All patients have inoperable multivessel disease, experienced one or more myocardial infarctions, and were treated by earlier invasive interventions. This group of patients are severely physically and psychologically disabled by their intractable angina pectoris. Available published data and the neurostimulation experience of the authors are reviewed in relation to the treatment of cardiac ischemic syndromes. We conclude that neurostimulation is an effective therapeutic adjuvant for patients with severe angina pectoris unresponsive to standard treatment. This treatment modality appears to be safe, and a promising tool for other ischemic cardiac syndromes.", 
    "76": "A practical synthesis of the sialyl Lewis X (sLex) pentasaccharide, NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta OEt (1), as a potential blocker for E-selectin has been described. The glycosylation of a trisaccharide acceptor, Fuc alpha (1-3)GlcNAc beta (1-3)Gal beta OEt, with a disaccharide donor, NeuAc alpha (2-3)Gal beta SMe, did not yield the desired sLex pentasaccharide 1 at all. However, the glycosylation of a disaccharide acceptor, GlcNAc beta (1-3)Gal beta OEt, with a disaccharide donor, NeuAc alpha (2-3)Gal beta SMe, quantitatively yielded the tetrasaccharide NeuAc alpha (2-3)Gal beta (1-4)GlcNAc beta (1-3)Gal beta OEt. This tetrasaccharide is readily converted to the title compound in a high yield by fucosylation, followed by deprotection. The inhibitory activities of compound 1 toward the binding of the natural ligand (sLex) with the E-, P-, and L-selectins were stronger than those of the sLex tetrasaccharide.",

    "78": "Experiments were performed on isolated human renal arteries rings obtained during surgery due to kidney tumors (n = 12). Epinine concentration-dependently relaxed isolated precontracted (PGF2 alpha) human renal artery rings (P < 0.05) in the presence of phentolamine, as effectively (epinine -30 +/- 4 mN, dopamine -31 +/- 5 mN) and with the same potency as dopamine (epinine EC50 0.7 mumol/l (0.4-1.2 mumol/l), dopamine 0.5 mumol/l (0.2-1.7 mumol/l). This effect was antagonized by the specific D1-receptor-antagonist SCH 23390. Effective beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic concentrations of propranolol did not affect epinine-induced vasorelaxation. In the absence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-antagonists the potency of epinine to contract renal artery rings was significantly higher compared to dopamine indicating a higher affinity of epinine to alpha-adrenoceptors.",

    "80": "Cardiorespiratory effects of capsaicin (CAPS) solution instilled into the larynx and the reflex mechanisms were investigated in rats with spontaneous breathing or under artificial ventilation. The first challenge with CAPS (100 micrograms/ml, 20 microliters) markedly inhibited spontaneous breathing due to a considerable prolongation of expiration time (TE) (1785% of control) in all rats. Circulatory changes such as hypertension (mean systolic blood pressure-210 mmHg) and bradycardia (10.5% decrease in heart rate) were also elicited by the 1st challenge with CAPS. These changes were largely reduced by the second challenge of CAPS; but not abolished in 3 of 5 rats by bilateral section of the superior laryngeal nerves (SLNs) and recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs). The bradycardia and hypertension after the CAPS-instillation were able to be elicited to the same extent in rats in the absence of apnea under artificial ventilation. The bradycardia was entirely abolished by pretreatment with atropine injection, while the hypertension was largely inhibited by phentolamine and propranolol. These results demonstrated that the laryngeal and/or pharyngeal noxious stimulus could induce marked cardiorespiratory reflexes, where the circulatory changes could be elicited in the absence of apnea, suggesting the presence of eliciting mechanisms of circulatory changes independent on the occurrence of apnea. In addition, it was also suggested that those cardiorespiratory responses were mediated by the afferents such as unmyelinated C-fiber endings and thin myelinated fibers and by the efferents, both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems.", 
    "81": "The development of a capillary zone electrophoresis method for determination of the drug atenolol in the presence of its related substances in bulk and in a tablet dosage form is described. The method was fully validated in terms of repeatability (RSDs for migration time and peak area of atenolol at 0.05 mg ml-1 were 0.25% and 0.52%, n = 10, respectively), reproducibility (RSD of peak area 0.84%, n = 5), linearity at two ranges of atenolol concentration, limits of detection and quantitation, ruggedness and robustness. The method was applied to the determination of the drug in a commercial tablet preparation (recovery 99.4%, m/m). The method proved to be fast and reliable for the quantitative analysis of atenolol in the presence of its related substances in bulk and pharmaceutical forms.", 
    "82": "Near-infrared spectrometry (NIR) was used to quantify metroprolol succinate in controlled release tablets. Metoprolol tablets were made according to an experimental design using different strengths around a central strength of 47.5 mg per tablet. A comparison was made between NIR in the diffuse reflectance mode and the transmission mode. This showed that, although a narrower wavelength range was available in the transmission mode, predictions were much better for models based on transmission spectra than for models based on diffuse reflectance spectra. The main reason for this is that in the reflectance mode NIR spectrometry is very sensitive to the inhomogeneity of the material, while in the transmission mode this problem is less severe. This is due to the larger volume of the material scanned in the transmission mode compared to that in diffuse reflectance. Spectra were taken before and after the tablets were stored under humid conditions. This allowed the final calibration models to be made more robust towards variations in the amount of water in the tablet. Different batches of metoprolol pellets and microcrystalline cellulose were used during the production of the tablets. this resulted in models that were more robust towards possible batch-to-batch differences in the main constituents.", 
    "83": "A case involving a 27-year-old woman who ingested an overdose of acebutolol is presented. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was initiated to stabilize the patient's condition before commencing hemodialysis. S-diacetolol (the N-acetelation product of acebutolol) was cleared with hemodialysis. It is suggested that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be of short-term benefit in the treatment of overdoses with beta-adrenergic agents such as acebutolol when accelerated clearance with hemodialysis is anticipated.", 
    "84": "Aconitine and higenamine are the major cardioactive compounds obtained from processed aconite. The chronotropic interaction between these two compounds was investigated in isolated right atria of mice. Both aconitine and higenamine potentiated the action of the other. Practolol (1 nM), a selective beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, but not butoxamine (1 microM), a beta 2-adrenergic antagonist, blocked the potentiation by higenamine (5 nM) of the aconitine-induced positive chronotropic effect and, at high concentrations (30 and 300 nM) also shifted the aconitine concentration-response curves to the right. The potentiating interaction between aconitine and higenamine was reversed by pretreating with cholera toxin (CTX) and forskolin. In CTX (100 nM, 1 h)- and forskolin (30 and 100 nM)-treated atria, higenamine significantly depressed the aconitine-induced response, which was abolished by pertussis toxin (PTX, 150 micrograms/kg, i.p., 3 d). Neither CTX (50 and 100 nM) nor forskolin (15-100 nM) significantly affected the aconitine-induced positive chronotropic effect, while PTX (150 micrograms/kg) depressed it. These results suggest that the potentiating interaction between aconitine and higenamine involves \"cross-talk\" between the beta 1-adrenergic signalling pathway and Gi-protein.",

    "86": "In the present study, mediators of muscle contraction-evoked cardiovascular responses were examined in anesthetized rats. Rhythmic contractions of the hindlimb triceps surae muscle were produced by stimulating the tibial nerve (motor threshold 22.7 +/- 2.3 microA; n = 10) by using a 1 s on-1 s off pattern. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) responses were recorded before and after 1) muscarinic receptor blockade (atropine sulfate; 2.0 mg/kg i.v., n = 5); 2) nitric oxide synthase inhibition with N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 300 microM/kg i.v., n = 7); 3) beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol; 2.0 mg/kg i.v., n = 10); and 4) bilateral adrenalectomy (n = 4). Rhythmic stimulation (10-s) significantly reduced MAP (P < 0.05) and elicited small decreases in HR that were abolished by neuromuscular blockade (n = 4). Atropine had no effect on MAP or HR responses to contraction. L-NAME increased baseline MAP (112.2 +/- 2.2 to 137.1 +/- 4.6 mmHg, P < 0.05) and attenuated contraction-evoked reductions of MAP (P < 0.05) without affecting HR. L-NAME-induced response deficits were mimicked in four separate rats by elevating MAP with phenylephrine (7-10 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 iv) to a level not different from that produced by L-NAME. Bilateral adrenalectomy and propranolol did not significantly affect HR responses but reduced contraction-evoked decreases in MAP from 14.3 +/- 2.9 to 7.7 +/- 2.2 mmHg and from 13.4 +/- 1.3 to 6.3 +/- 3.1 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.05). Baseline MAP was unchanged. We conclude that adrenal catecholamines, acting at beta-adrenoceptors, contribute significantly to the contraction-evoked depressor response in rats. No role for muscarinic receptors is evident in this response. Furthermore, attenuation of depressor responses to contraction after nitric oxide inhibition could result from an indirect effect of the pressor actions of L-NAME.", 
    "87": "Although propranolol has been shown to protect against ethanol and stress ulceration, the antiulcer mechanisms are still unclear. The present study examined the antiulcer mechanisms of propranolol in three different types of ulceration induced respectively by ethanol (60%), indomethacin (30 mg/kg) and stress (cold-restraint). Propranolol pretreatment in the highest dose (10 mg/kg) given either intraperitoneally (i.p.) or orally (p.o.) prevented gastric mucosal damage in these three ulcer models. The three doses of the drug (2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased systemic blood pressure which was accompanied by a reduction of gastric mucosal blood flow. These findings suggest that the protection was unrelated to an improvement of local circulation in the stomach. However, propranolol preserved the mucus levels in the three types of ulcer models. The beta-adrenoceptor blocker also increased the basal gastric mucosal potential difference. These findings indicate that propranolol strengthens the mucosal barrier by the preservation of mucosal mucus and enhancement of the mucosal integrity in the stomach.", 
    "88": "Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is used for treatment of portal hypertension as it is believed to diminish splanchnic blood flow both by reducing cardiac output (beta(1)-blockade) and by increasing splanchnic arteriolar resistance (beta(2)-blockade). However, possible vasodilatory properties of propranolol at higher concentrations may counteract splanchnic vasoconstriction. Nadolol, another nonselective beta-blocker, has also been suggested for treatment of portal hypertension. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of various concentrations of propranolol and nadolol on vascular resistance in isolated perfused mesenteric arterial beds from normal and portal hypertensive rats. At concentrations of 10(-7) mol L-1 to 10(-6) mol L-1 neither propranolol nor nadolol changed pressor responses to noradrenaline in normal rats. However, nadolol 10(-5) mol L-1 significantly increased, whereas propranolol 10(-5) mol L-1 reduced, noradrenaline-induced vasoconstriction both in normal and in portal hypertensive rats. This unexpected vasodilatory effect of propranolol at high concentrations was present in preparations stimulated by both noradrenaline and methoxamine but not vasopressin and thus may be due to competitive alpha-receptor blockade. In contrast, nadolol lacked this effect and produced splanchnic arteriolar vasoconstriction at high concentrations also.", 
    "89": "A large number of randomized clinical trials have shown that thrombolysis, long-term treatment with beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, for calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil) there was either no benefit, or positive effects have been reported in subgroups only. Recent studies have raised concern about the safety of this drug class, especially in patients with coronary heart disease. We studied the long-term survival, for a median follow-up time of 4.4 years, of 1197 non-diabetic patients in the population-based AMI registry in Augsburg, Germany, aged 25-74 years, who had survived a first Q wave acute myocardial infarction for at least 28 days. The impact of thrombolysis and prescribed medication at discharge (beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and calcium channel blockers) on long-term survival was analysed using the Cox-Proportional-Hazard model, controlling for age, sex, and concomitant cardiac drug use. Thrombolysis (risk ratio, RR, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.48-1.08), long-term beta-blockade (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.36-0.74) and antiplatelet drug use (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.94) were associated with considerable reductions in total mortality. The use of calcium channel blockers was not associated with a reduction in total mortality (RR 1.23; 95% CI 0.89-1.69). Separate analyses for nifedipine (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.68-1.48), and diltiazem (RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.04-2.32) showed an increased risk of death associated with the latter. Using patients on beta-blockers only (RR 1.00) as a reference, the prescription of these calcium channel blockers was consistently associated with an increased total mortality (nifedipine, without beta-blockers RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.12-3.57, diltiazem, without beta-blockers RR 2.87; 95% CI 1.75-4.70). These results from an observational study demonstrate a benefit of thrombolysis, beta-adrenergic blockade and antiplatelet drug use on long-term survival in acute myocardial infarction patients. Calcium channel blocker use appears to be associated with an increased risk of death. These data support the need for controlled trials to address this issue specifically.", 
    "90": "A comparative post-marketing surveillance study of the safety and efficacy of flunarizine and propranolol in the treatment of migraine was carried out. General practitioners in Belgium and the Netherlands each recruited patients for whom they would prescribe one of the study medications in the normal course of their treatment and recorded all medical events on follow-up forms for up to 8 months. A total of 1601 migraine patients were enrolled; 838 in the flunarizine cohort and 763 in the propranolol cohort. Propranolol was somewhat better than flunarizine in reducing the severity of migraine attacks, although this may have been due to a selection bias. Discontinuations of therapy due to events considered likely to be treatment-related were mostly due to the recognized side effects of the two drugs. As regards the occurrence of depressions, a total of 58 patients had depressive events, 34 in the flunarizine cohort and 24 in the propranolol cohort. Whereas migraine itself appears to be associated with an increased risk of depression, the number of previous migraine treatments was shown to be an additional risk factor for the development of depression in patients receiving flunarizine as was a history of depression. Overall, there was no appreciable difference in the risk/benefit ratio between flunarizine and propranolol.", 
    "91": "The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of salmeterol versus theophylline in the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma. One hundred and eighty nine asthmatic patients (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow (PEF) >50% of predicted) were randomized to receive either salmeterol dry powder, 50 microg b.i.d. via a Diskhaler (n=92) or dose-titrated slow-release theophylline capsules (\"Theo-Dur\") b.i.d. (n=97), in a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study for 4 weeks. Patients had previously been titrated with theophylline to a serum theophylline level of 10-20 microg x mL-1. The median percentage of nights with no asthma symptoms rose from 14% in both groups at baseline to 71% with salmeterol and to 46% with theophylline (p=0.044). There was also a significant increase for salmeterol in the median percentage of nights with no rescue salbutamol use (from 36 to 86%) compared with theophylline (from 71 to 78%; p=0.002). The mean morning PEF increased from 337 L x min-1 in the salmeterol group and 332 L x min-1 in the theophylline group to 372 and 357 L x min-1, respectively. No significant difference between the two treatments was observed for PEF, symptoms or additional salbutamol medication during the day. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms (gastric irritation, nausea and vomiting) was greater among patients receiving theophylline (11%) than with salmeterol (3%). These findings suggest that inhaled salmeterol is more effective in relieving symptoms of asthma, and better tolerated than theophylline in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.", 
    "92": "We determined the haemodynamic, electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic effects, and the pharmacokinetic properties of 4'-hydroxypropranolol (4'-OHP) by conducting three different experiments in dogs. In experiment 1 the plasma concentrations of 4'-OHP (mg/kg, i.v.) in pentobarbital anaesthetized dogs were determined by HPLC and pharmacokinetic parameter values were estimated. The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) for 4'-OHP was 69.4 min, the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) was 3.39 L/kg and the total clearance (Clt) was 53.6 mL/min.kg. These data were subsequently used to calculate the loading and maintenance doses of 4'-OHP required to produce targeted steady-state plasma concentrations for 4'-OHP of 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 ng/mL. In experiment 2 the haemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects for target plasma concentrations of 4'-OHP were determined in two groups of pentobarbital anaesthetized dogs, and beta-blocking activity was assessed by infusion or bolus doses of isoproterenol. The haemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects of the target plasma concentrations (30, 60, 120 ng/mL) of 4'-OHP were first determined in seven pentobarbital anaesthetized dogs (Group 1). Beta blocking activity was assessed by the infusion of 0.1 microgram/kg/min isoproterenol. The infusion of 4'-OHP produced dose dependent decreases in heart rate, cardiac output, dP/dtmax, mean arterial pressure and left ventricular diastolic pressure. The PR interval of the lead II electrocardiogram increased and the QTc interval decreased. These haemodynamic and electrocardiographic changes became apparent at plasma 4'-OHP concentrations equal to or greater than 30 ng/mL. Plasma concentrations of 4'-OHP equal to or greater than 30 ng/mL prevented the haemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects of isoproterenol infusion. In group 2 dogs, (seven dogs) the haemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects of target plasma concentrations (30, 60, 120, 240, 480 ng/mL) of 4'-OHP were evaluated and beta-blocking activity was assessed by the i.v. bolus administration of 1 and 4 micrograms/kg of isoproterenol. The infusion of 4'-OHP produced haemodynamic and electrocardiographic changes similar to those in group 1 dogs. In addition, the QRS duration of the electrocardiogram increased at plasma concentrations of 4'-OHP equal to or greater than 240 ng/ mL. The haemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects of i.v. bolus dose administrations of 1 and 4 micrograms/kg isoproterenol were abolished by plasma concentrations of 4'-OHP equal to or greater than 240 ng/mL. In experiment 3 we determined the electrophysiologic effects of 10(-9) to 10(-5) mmol/L 4'-OHP on Tyrodes superfused bundles of canine Purkinje fibres. Action potential duration and the effective refractory period decreased at superfusate concentrations of 4'-OHP equal to or greater than 10(-7) mmol/L. Action potential overshoot, action potential total amplitude, the rate of rise of phase 0 (dV/dt) and spontaneous rate decreased at superfusage concentrations of 4'-OHP equal to or greater than 800 ng/mL. These studies demonstrate that: 1) 4'-OHP produces haemodynamic. electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic effects similar to those of other beta-blocking drugs in pentobarbital anaesthetized dogs; 2) the haemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects produced by 4'-OHP are apparent at relatively low plasma concentrations (30 ng/mL); 3) the concentrations of 4'-OHP that are required to produce direct cardiac electrophysiologic effects are unlikely to be responsible for clinical antiarrhythmic activity and 4) 4'-OHP blocks the haemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects of infusions and i.v. bolus administration of isoproterenol.", 
    "93": "The idiopathic long QT syndrome (LQTS) carries a high mortality in untreated patients. Administration of beta-receptor antagonists is considered the treatment of choice. Data concerning the usefulness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in this condition are sparse. We report on a 29-year-old female with LQTS who was treated with propranolol, but also underwent implantation of an ICD as a fail-safe therapy. During the next 17 months, the patient was asymptomatic. However, after skipping her propranolol for 3 days, she had several syncopal spells with concomitant device therapy. ICD interrogation revealed a total of 55 nonsustained runs of ventricular tachycardia and 16 sustained episodes that were correctly identified by the device and respectively terminated by the first shock. This case report demonstrates that in selected patients with the LQTS, using ICD therapy as a fail-safe treatment may be life-saving, particularly when compliance to medical therapy is uncertain.", 
    "94": "1. We have previously reported that activation of group II-like metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in rat hippocampus results in a potentiation of the accumulation of cAMP elicited by activation of G-protein Gs-coupled receptors. This large increase in cAMP levels results in release of cAMP or a cAMP metabolite and depression of synaptic transmission at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapse through activation of A1 adenosine receptors. 2. Consistent with these studies, we report that antagonists of group II mGluRs block both the potentiation of cAMP accumulation elicited by activation of mGluRs and the depression of synaptic transmission induced by coactivation of mGluRs and beta-adrenergic receptors. 3. In situ hybridization studies suggest that of the cloned group II mGluRs only mGluR-3 mRNA is present in area CA1. Interestingly, mGluR-3 appears to be present predominantly in glia in this region. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that mGluRs coupled to potentiation of cAMP accumulation were present on glia rather than neurons in area CA1. 4. The selective group II mGluR agonist 2S,1'R,2'R,3'R-2(2,3-dicarboxycyclo-propyl)glycine (DCG-IV) failed to enhance cAMP-mediated electrophysiological responses to the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoprenaline (Iso) in CA1 pyramidal cells, suggesting that mGluRs coupled to potentiation of cAMP accumulation may not be present in these cells. 5. Pre-incubation of hippocampal slices with either of the selective glial toxins L-alpha-aminoadipic acid (L-AA) or fluorocitrate (FC) blocked mGluR-mediated potentiation of cAMP accumulation. However, L-AA and FC had no discernible effects on viability of CA1 pyramidal cells, or cAMP-mediated electrophysiological effects in these neurons. 6. Pre-incubation of hippocampal slices with the neurotoxin kainate resulted in disruption of neuronal transmission and degeneration of neurons in area CA1, but had no effect on mGluR-mediated potentiation of cAMP accumulation. 7. Pre-incubation of hippocampal slices with the cAMP/cAMP metabolite transport blocker probenicid blocked the depression of synaptic transmission elicited by coapplication of Iso and DCG-IV, while having no significant effect on cAMP accumulation elicited by these agonists. 8. Taken together, these data suggest that mGluRs coupled to potentiation of cAMP accumulation are present on glia rather than neurons in area CA1 of hippocampus. This suggests that a novel form of glial-neuronal communication may exist, since activation of these mGluRs in concert with beta-adrenergic receptors results in depression of synaptic transmission.", 
    "95": "We investigated the effects of a novel bradycardiac agent, bertosamil (3-isobutyl-7-isopropyl-9,9-pentamethylene-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1] nonane sesquihydrogenfumarate), on the sinus rate and atrial contractile force and the left ventricular contractile force in isolated, blood-perfused dog hearts and the blocking effects of bertosamil on the chronotropic and inotropic responses to pinacidil and Bay k 8644 (methyl-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)- piridine-5-carboxylate). Bertosamil (0.1-100 nmol) caused transient positive, followed by continuous negative, chronotropic responses and positive inotropic responses in atria, and increased the left ventricular contractile force. Neither propranolol nor atropine affected the cardiac responses to bertosamil. Bertosamil (3-100 nmol) dose dependently attenuated the negative chronotropic and inotropic responses to pinacidil but not to acetylcholine. Bertosamil at a high dose attenuated the positive cardiac responses to Bay k 8644, norepinephrine and isoproterenol. These results suggest that bertosamil inhibits negative cardiac responses mediated by an ATP-sensitive K+ channel but not an acetylcholine muscarinic receptor and, at a high dose, attenuates the L-type Ca2+ channel-mediated positive cardiac responses in isolated dog hearts.", 
    "96": "1. The heart of several species including man contains atypical beta-adrenoceptors, in addition to coexisting beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. We now asked the question whether or not the third cardiac beta-adrenoceptor is identical to the putative beta 3-adrenoceptor. We compared the properties of the third cardiac beta-adrenoceptor with those of beta 3-adrenoceptors in isolated tissues of the rat. To study the third cardiac beta-adrenoceptor we used spontaneously beating right atria, paced left atria and paced left ventricular papillary muscles. As a likely model for putative beta 3-adrenoceptors we studied atypical beta-adrenoceptors of the colonic longitudinal muscle precontracted with 30 mM KCl. We used beta 3-adrenoceptor-selective agonists, antagonists and non-conventional partial agonists (ie high-affinity blockers of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors know to exert also stimulant effects through beta 3-adrenoceptors). 2. The non-conventional partial agonist (-)-CGP 12177 caused positive chronotropic effects in right atria (pD2 = 7.3) and positive inotropic effects in left atria (pD2 = 7.5). The stimulant effects of (-)-CGP 12177 were resistant to blockade by 200 nM-2 microM (-)-propranolol and 3 microM ICI 118551 (a beta 2-selective antagonist) but antagonized by 1 microM (-)-bupranolol (pKB = 6.4-6.8), 3 microM CGP 20712A (a beta 1-selective antagonist) (pKB = 6.3-6.4) and 6.6 microM SR 59230A (a beta 3-selective antagonist, pKB = 5.1-5.4). 3. The non-conventional partial agonist cyanopindolol caused positive chronotropic effects in right atria (pD2 = 7.7) and positive inotropic effects in left atria (pD2 = 7.1). The stimulant effects of cyanopindolol were resistant to blockade by 200 nM (-)-propranolol but antagonized by 1 microM (-)-bupranolol (pKB = 6.8-7.1). 4. Neither (-)-CGP 12177 nor cyanopindolol caused stimulant effects in papillary muscles at concentrations between 0.2 nM and 20 microM. 5. In the presence of 200 nM (-)-propranolol the beta 3-adrenoceptor-selective agonists BRL 37344 (6 microM), SR 58611A (6 microM), ZD 2079 (60 microM) and CL 316243 (60 microM) did not cause stimulant effects or modify the potency and efficacy of the effects of (-)-CGP 12177 in right and left atria. The combination of 2 microM (-)-propranolol and 2 microM (-)-noradrenaline did not modify the chronotropic potency and efficacy of (-)-CGP 12177 compared to the potency and efficacy in the presence of 2 microM (-)-propranolol alone. 6. (-)-CGP 12177 relaxed the colon with a pD2 of 6.9 and a maximum effect of 55% compared to (-)-isoprenaline. The relaxant effects of (-)-CGP 12177 were resistant to blockade by 200 nM (-)-propranolol, 3 microM CGP 20712A, 3 microM ICI 118551 but blocked by 2 microM (-)-propranolol (pKB = 6.0), 1 microM (-)-bupranolol (pKB = 6.4) and 3 microM SR 59230A (pKB = 6.3). In the presence of 200 nM (-)-propranolol, (-)-CGP 12177 (20 microM) antagonized surmountably the relaxant effects of BRL 37344 (pKP = 7.3) (-)-noradrenaline (pKP = 7.0); and CL 316243 (pKP = 7.0). 7. Cyanopindolol in the presence of 200 nM (-)-propranolol relaxed the colon with a pD2 of 7.0 and a maximum effect of 40% compared to (-)-isoprenaline. As expected from a partial agonist, cyanopindolol antagonized the relaxant effects of both BRL 37344 and CL 316243 with a pKP = 7.6 and (-)-noradrenaline with a pKP = 7.4. 8. The following beta 3-adrenoceptor-selective agonists were potent colonic relaxants (pD2 values between parentheses): BRL 37344 (9.1), ZD 2079 (7.0), CL 316243 (9.0) and SR 58611A (8.2). The relaxant effects of these agonists were only marginally affected by 200 nM (-)-propranolol, not blocked by 3 microM CGP 20712A or 3 microM ICI 118551, and blocked by SR 59230A 3 microM (pKB = 6.9-7.5), 1 microM (-)-bupranolol (pKB = 6.2-6.4) and 2 microM (-)-propranolol (pKB = 6.3-6.5). 9...", 
    "97": "1. Intravenous bolus doses of thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH, 50-1000 micrograms) caused statistically significant, non-dose dependent and transient rises in blood pressure, heart rate and plasma catecholamines in healthy young males. 2. Mean peak incremental rises in systolic blood pressure (mean +/- s.e. mean) following 50, 200 and 500 micrograms TRH were 14.3 +/- 2.9 mmHg, 15.7 +/- 3.2 mmHg and 17.1 +/- 3.9 mmHg respectively (all P < 0.05 vs placebo). Mean incremental rises in heart rate for the three doses of TRH were 8.2 +/- 2.2 beats min-1, 7.1 +/- 1.8 beats min-1, and 10.7 +/- 2.9 beats min-1 respectively (all P < 0.05 vs placebo). 3. Following the 50 micrograms and 1000 micrograms doses of TRH, plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline rose significantly (P < 0.05) between 4 and 8 min. Mean +/- s.e. mean incremental plasma noradrenaline rise following 50, 200 and 100 micrograms TRH were 0.4 +/- 0.13 nmol 1(-1), 0.37 +/- 0.21 nmol 1(-1) and 0.41 +/- 0.18 nmol 1(-1) respectively. Mean +/- s.e. mean incremental rise in adrenaline for the 50, 200 and 1000 micrograms dose were 0.13 +/- 0.04 nmol 1(-), 0.08 +/- 0.03 nmol 1(-1), and 0.11 +/- 0.05 nmol 1(-1) respectively. 4. Following administration of the ganglion blocking drug pentolinium (5 mg) the incremental systolic blood pressure and heart rate rises following 500 micrograms TRH alone 16.6 +/- 2.8 mmHg and 10.4 + 3.1 beats min-1 respectively. 5. The rises in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline following TRH were attenuated by prior ganglion blockade. 6. alpha-Adrenoceptor blockade with thymoxamine (0.3 mg kg-1 bolus + 0.3 mg kg-1 h-1 infusion), singly and combined with intravenous propranolol (10 mg i.v. over 10 min), did not alter the pressor or tachycardic effects of 500 micrograms TRH. 7. In conclusion, although plasma noradrenaline rises following i.v. TRH, suggesting activation of the sympathetic nervous system, this effect is not responsible for the pressor response to TRH, which appears to be due to either a direct vasoconstrictive effect on the peripheral resistance vessels or a direct inotropic/chronotropic effect on the heart.", 
    "98": "1. The affinity of (--)-timolol for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors was determined on isolated atrial preparations from patients undergoing open heart surgery. The times for onset and offset of antagonism of the positive inotropic effects of (--)-adrenaline and (--)-noradrenaline by (--)-timolol were measured. 2. The antagonism of the positive inotropic effects of (--)-adrenaline and (--)-noradrenaline by (--)-timolol (0.1-100 nM) was simple competitive in human atrium tissue. The slope of Schild-plots was not significantly different from 1.0 [0.93 +/- 0.09 for (--)-adrenaline, 0.97 +/- 0.09 for (--)-noradrenaline]. 3. The inotropic effects of (--)-adrenaline were antagonized significantly more by each concentration of (--)-timolol than those of (--)-noradrenaline. KB-values (-log M) were 10.10 +/- 0.09 against (--)-adrenaline and 9.43 +/- 0.07 against (--)-noradrenaline (P < 0.001). 4. Blocking kinetics of (--)-timolol for the beta-adrenoceptor were relatively slow. Half-times for the onset of blockade by 10 times KB of (--)-timolol were approximately 30 min for both (--)-adrenaline and (--)-noradrenaline; offset times were similar. 5. It is concluded that (--)-timolol has a higher affinity for the beta 2-adrenoceptor than for the beta 1-adrenoceptor in human atrium. This property may be beneficial clinically in protecting against the beta 2-adrenoceptor hypersensitivity induced by cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade, but also explain why severe asthma can occur after administration of very low intra-ocular doses of the drug.", 
    "99": "Performance of rats on a motor learning paradigm that has been demonstrated to be dependent upon cerebellar norepinephrine (NE) was studied in male F344 rats treated with an alpha 1 antagonist (prazosin), an alpha 2 antagonist (yohimbine) or a beta noradrenergic antagonist (propranolol). The ability of propranolol-treated rats (10 mg/kg i.p. 30 min prior to daily testing) to acquire proficiency on the novel motor task was impaired while prazosin-treated rats' (0.5 mg/kg i.p. 30 min prior to daily testing) and yohimbine-treated rats' (1 mg/kg i.p. 30 min prior to daily testing) rates of acquisition of the novel motor task were not different from controls. In an attempt to distinguish between alterations in motor coordination and motor learning, additional tests of psychomotor performance were assessed for all groups of rats. These examinations included a walking test on 2.5 and 5 cm rods and speed of running on the motor task. The data indicate that drug-treated rats show no difference from controls on the above parameters. Some differences, however, were observed between propranolol and controls in the time spent in the goal box. Overall, the data are consistent with our hypothesis that the beta noradrenergic receptor is involved in the ability to acquire novel motor tasks.", 
    "100": "Corneal permeability data taken from the literature were analyzed for possible quantitative relationships with physicochemical properties. Although a parabolic relationship was obtained with good correlation between lipophilicity, as expressed by the 1-octanol-water partition coefficients, log Poctanol (or the distribution coefficients, log D for ionizable compounds), and the permeability in individual analyses of compound classes such as beta-adrenoceptor blockers and steroids, the correlation was reduced when taken together. However, delta log P (i.e., log Poctanol-log Palkane) correlated inversely with the combined permeability data for beta-blockers and steroids and played a key role as a unifying variable. To a lesser extent, lipophilicity itself also contributes positively to corneal permeation. Even with the addition of miscellaneous compounds such as methanol and ibuprofen, the delta log P and lipophilicity terms were still significant. However, small molecules were likely to be underestimated, which is consistent with penetration via another pathway besides that governed by delta log P and lipophilicity.", 
    "101": "Five antihypertensive trials launched outside of the United States have been designed to address one of two vital issues. The first is whether or not there is an optimal level of blood pressure that clinicians should aim for to minimize the risk of cardiovascular disease. This has been addressed by the Swedish Behandla Blodtryck Battre (BBB) Trial and the international Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study. The BBB Trial revealed interesting trends, but no definitive conclusions. The ongoing HOT Study will have to be completed before this particular issue can be adequately addressed. However, preliminary analysis of a subgroup study has revealed that the HOT treatment regimens are as effective in the elderly as in younger patients. The second important issue, which is the question of whether traditional antihypertensive agents are more effective than the newer agents in reducing cardiovascular risk, is the current focus of three ongoing studies. Investigators in the Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) are comparing captopril to beta-blocker and diuretic regimens. The purpose of the Nordic Diltiazem Study (NORDIL) is to determine if diltiazem is more effective than conventional therapy in reducing cardiovascular risk. The Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension-2 (STOP-Hypertension-2) has been designed to compare therapy with beta-blockers and diuretics to therapy with calcium antagonists and angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors. All ongoing trials should be completed in the next few years and are expected to yield valuable information that will improve current strategies for the treatment of hypertension."
