P-11 (0.25 to 1.00 mg/kg i.v.) decreased the positive chronotropic effects of isoprenaline (0.2 micrograms/kg i.v.), but potentiated the isoprenaline-induced hypotension in reserpine-pretreated rats. P-11 (10(-7) to 10(-5)M) did not modify the concentration-effect curves for isoprenaline in carbachol-contracted guinea-pig tracheal strips. The pD2 value of isoprenaline was 5.94 before and 6.35 after P-11. The combined alpha1-postsynaptic antagonist/beta1-blocking activity of this compound is discussed.", 
    "1": "The absolute bioavailability and dose proportionality of betaxolol [(+/-)-1-(p-[2-cyclopropylmethoxy)ethyl]phenoxy]-3- (isopropylamino)-2-propanol hydrochloride], a cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist effective in the treatment of angina and hypertension, was studied in 12 healthy male subjects using a four-way crossover Latin Square design. Each subject received a 10-mg iv dose administered by constant-rate infusion over a period of 30 min and three oral doses (10, 20, and 40 mg). Blood and urine were collected over a 48-h period and analyzed for betaxolol using gas-liquid chromatography with electron capture detection. Maximum concentrations occurred 3-4 h after the dose. The maximum mean (+/- SD) blood concentrations normalized to the 10-mg oral dose were 21.6 +/- 3.7, 21.1 +/- 3.7, and 22.5 +/- 4.0 micrograms/L following the 10-, 20-, and 40-mg doses, respectively. A significant lag time of 10-80 min was observed after oral doses but was not related to dose size. The terminal slope (ts), absolute bioavailability (F), and renal clearance (CLr) were likewise not affected to an important degree by dose (ts: 0.043 +/- 0.006, 0.044 +/- 0.005, 0.046 +/- 0.006 h-1; F: 0.88 +/- 0.08, 0.82 +/- 0.06, 0.84 +/- 0.07; CLr: 0.68 +/- 0.22, 0.69 +/- 0.19, 0.65 +/- 0.22 mL/min kg). Unlike many beta-adrenergic antagonists, betaxolol has a long half-life (13-20 h) and high and consistent bioavailability (70-90%), and its disposition is independent of the size of the administered dose.", 
    "2": "The effects of a new beta-blocker, (+/-)-4-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-2-methyl-1(2H)-isoquinolino ne hydrochloride (tilisolol hydrochloride, N-696), on forearm circulation were examined and compared with those of propranolol in healthy young males. N-696 (30 mg/d for 7 days) decreased heart rate from 75 +/- 4 to 56 +/- 2 bpm (p less than 0.01) and decreased mean blood pressure from 86 +/- 2 to 79 +/- 2 mmHg (p less than 0.05) (n = 7). Propranolol (60 mg/d for 7 days) decreased heart rate from 62 +/- 1 to 51 +/- 2 (p less than 0.01) and decreased mean blood pressure from 83 +/- 3 to 73 +/- 3 mmHg (p less than 0.01) (n = 7). Resting forearm blood flow and forearm vascular resistance were not altered by N-696, whereas propranolol decreased forearm blood flow (p less than 0.05) and increased forearm vascular resistance (p less than 0.01). Reflex forearm vasoconstriction was examined by measuring forearm vascular resistance with a strain gauge plethysmograph during lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The regression line relating central venous pressure and forearm vascular resistance during LBNP was shifted toward the resistance axis by propranolol but was not altered by N-696. Propranolol augmented forearm vascular responses to intraarterially infused norepinephrine but N-696 did not alter them. Thus, in contrast to propranolol, N-696 lowered blood pressure and heart rate without peripheral vasoconstriction and did not augment forearm vasoconstrictive responses to norepinephrine.", 
    "3": "The positive inotropic agent milrinone and the newly synthesized compound saterinone [+/-)-1,2-dihydro-5-[4-[2-hydroxy-3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl] propoxy]phenyl]-6-methyl-2-oxo-3-pyridine-carbonitrile, BDF 8634) dose-dependently increased the contractile force of guinea pig left atria. During a 90-min exposure, 10(-4) mol/l saterinone caused a continuous increase of the functional refractory period (FRP), while the initial positive inotropic effect faded gradually. No change of the FRP was observed with milrinone. Saterinone (10(-4) mol/l) also increased the action potential duration and the FRP of guinea pig papillary muscles, while milrinone had no influence on either parameter. Both milrinone and saterinone increased the amplitude, depolarization velocity and duration of slow response action potentials in K+-depolarized muscles. These effects appeared in the presence of tetrodotoxin or propranolol and could be reversed by carbachol. It is concluded that saterinone increases the force of contraction and the slow inward current by inhibiting cardiac phosphodiesterase. The increase of the FRP may be attributed to a decrease of the membrane K+ conductance.", 
    "4": "The present pharmacological test results characterize soquinolol (5-[3-tertiary butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy]-2-formyl-1,2,3,4- tetrahydroisoquinoline mucate, We 704, Sertum) as a highly potent non-subtype-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, which is devoid of any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Its localanaesthetic activity (membrane stabilizing effect) is very weak. It also shows good enteral efficacy and long duration of action. In binding studies with heart (Ki beta 1 = 3.25 nmol/l) and lung membranes (Ki beta 2 = 0.85 nmol/l) its binding profile was found to be similar to that of propranolol. Soquinolol inhibits the isoprenaline-induced tachycardia (EC50% = 48 micrograms/l) in the guinea-pig Langendorff heart in vitro to the same degree as propranolol. However, in the conscious dog soquinolol's beta 1-adrenergic blocking activity (ED 50%) on intravenous injection (5.5 micrograms/kg) and oral administration (5.8 micrograms/kg) is about twice as great as that of pindolol and 19 times (i.v.) or 138 times (p.o.) greater than that of propranolol. These results suggest 95% enteral efficacy for soquinolol (pindolol 88%, propranolol 13%). The differences in soquinolol's and propranolol's efficacy detected in vitro and in vivo are partially attributable to differences in their kinetic properties namely the lower protein binding and the higher distribution volume of soquinolol. In the conscious dog, soquinolol inhibits beta 1-(ED 50% = 4.0 micrograms/kg) and beta 2-receptors (ED 50% = 2.7 micrograms/kg) at dose levels which do not differ significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "A method is described for assessing the selectivity of compounds for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in vivo. The potency of selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists to increase heart rate and decrease uterine contractions in pithed rats and in isolated tissues was determined. The order of potency both in vivo (i.v. route) and in vitro was: isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than salbutamol on heart rate, and isoprenaline greater than salbutamol greater than noradrenaline on uterine relaxation. Fenoterol, salbutamol, and BRL 26830A/28410, but not denopamine, (i.p.) route were more potent stimulants of uterine relaxation than of heart rate in pithed rats and in vitro. The abilities of atenolol (beta 1-selective), ICI 118551 (beta 2-selective) and propranolol (non selective between beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors) to inhibit responses to isoprenaline on heart rate and uterine contractions in vivo were also assessed. The effects of isoprenaline on heart rate were selectively antagonized by atenolol while those on the uterus were selectively antagonized by ICI 118551. These results show that beta 1-adrenoceptors mediate increases in heart rate and that beta 2-adrenoceptors mediate uterine relaxation in the pithed rat. They further show that the activity of compounds at these tissues can be used to assess their selectivity for beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors in vivo.", 
    "6": "1. The effects of procaterol, a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, on excitatory neuro-effector transmission in the dog trachea were investigated and the findings were compared to those seen with isoprenaline, with microelectrode, double sucrose gap and tension recording methods. 2. Procaterol (10(-10)-10(-9) M) and isoprenaline (10(-9) M) had no effect on the resting membrane potential or on the input resistance of the smooth muscle cells of dog trachea. However with increased concentrations (greater than 10(-8) M), these agents hyperpolarized the membrane and decreased the input resistance of the membrane. 3. Procaterol (10(-10)-10(-7) M) and isoprenaline (10(-9)-10(-7) M) dose-dependently reduced the amplitude of the twitch contractions evoked by field stimulation in the combined presence of indomethacin (10(-5) M) and guanethidine (10(-6) M). In parallel with actions on twitch contractions, procaterol (10(-10)-10(-7) M) and isoprenaline (10(-9)-10(-7) M) reduced the amplitude of the excitatory junction potentials (e.j.ps), evoked by single pulse field stimulation in the dog trachea. 4. Procaterol (10(-8) M) had no effect on the post-junctional response of smooth muscle cells to exogenous acetylcholine (ACh) (10(-7)-10(-6) M). 5. Pretreatment with ICI-118551, a beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking agent, reduced the inhibitory action of procaterol on the amplitude of twitch contractions evoked by field stimulations in the dog trachea. 6. These results indicate that procaterol in low concentrations has a prejunctional action inhibiting the excitatory neuro-effector transmission in addition to a postsynaptic action, presumably by suppressing transmitter release from the vagus nerve terminals through beta 2-adrenoceptors in the dog tracheal tissue. The pre- and post-junctional actions of procaterol explain its potent bronchodilator effects in clinical use.",

    "8": "Excretion of hydroxyproline with urine was studied in 16 children (5-14 years old) with Marphan-Like syndrome and Marphan, Ehlers-Dunlos and Larson syndromes after therapy involving propranolol and a complex of vitamins (ascorbic acid, riboflavin and pyridoxine) and recommended on the basis of echocardiographic analyses. The therapeutic course appears to cause quantitative and qualitative correction of collagen and apparently of elastin fibrilles development. Depending on initial patterns of hydroxyproline excretion and the syndrome form the correction could be complete or partial, while positive effect of the treatment was stable or provisional. The data obtained suggest that the complex treatment developed might be applied as a preoperative therapy of the patients with Marphan-like syndrome as well as with syndromes of Marphan and Ehlers-Dunlos before thoracoplastics caused by hereditary chest deformation and by impairments of cardiovascular system.", 
    "9": "The development of an encapsulated filtering bleb (Tenon's cyst) complicated 56 of 409 consecutive filtering operations (13.7%) performed during a 40-month period after January 1983. Fifteen eyes (27.8% of encapsulated blebs) required surgical revision. The recognition of bleb encapsulation occurred 20.4 +/- 12.7 days (mean +/- standard deviation) postoperatively. Prolonged duration of beta-adrenergic antagonist therapy was associated with an increased frequency of bleb encapsulation (180.6 +/- 128.5 weeks without encapsulation, 229.0 +/- 129.3 weeks with encapsulation, P less than 0.009). Bleb encapsulation occurred in 42 of 272 eyes with previous argon laser trabeculoplasty, but in only 4 of 85 eyes without any previous anterior segment laser (P less than 0.01). Encapsulated filtering blebs developed in 4 of 12 (33.3%) eyes with congenital glaucoma and 4 of 9 (44.4%) eyes with juvenile glaucoma (P less than 0.0002). The intraocular pressures (IOPs) in the eyes with encapsulated filtering blebs were significantly elevated at 1, 2, and 3 postoperative weeks, and at final follow-up compared with eyes without bleb encapsulation.", 
    "10": "Beta-adrenoblockers were found to be able of suppressing platelet aggregation through beta 2-subtype of adrenoreceptors. This is due to the membrane-stabilizing action of beta-adrenoblockers which by binding to the receptors decrease microviscosity of the membranes and prevent the opposite shift under the influence of aggregation inductors.", 
    "11": "1. The isolated rat portal vein was employed for essaying beta-agonists and beta-antagonists. beta-agonists elicit a log-dose dependent reduction of force of the spontaneous, rhythmic, myogenic contractions of the vein. The ID50 dose for isoprenaline was 8.40 +/- 0.04 SEM (negative log. of the molar concentration). Isoprenaline was the most potent of the beta-agonists. If given the value 100, then fenoterol is 75; salbutamol 10; terbutaline 6.75 and during alpha-blockade, adrenaline 28.80 and noradrenaline 0.27. The ratio of potency is thus ISOP greater than FENOT greater than ADR greater than SALB greater than TERB greater than NOR. This suggests that the predominant beta-receptors are beta 2. 2. The duration of effects was shortest for isoprenaline and largest for fenoterol and terbutaline. 3. With the highly potent, specific, competitive beta 2-blocker ICI 118551, a pA2 against isoprenaline of 9.30 (+/- SEM 0.03; C.L. 95% 9.22-9.38) was found. The pA2 against fenoterol, terbutaline, adrenaline and noradrenaline were included in these confidence-limits. With propranolol, a pA2 against isoprenaline of 8.82 (+/- SEM 0.02) was obtained. 4. The high pA2 found against non-selective (isoprenaline, adrenaline) and selective (fenoterol, terbutaline) beta 2-agonists is, as said, practically the same. This, together with the potency ratio ISOP greater than ADR greater than NOR, markedly suggest that the population of beta-receptors in the smooth muscle of the rat portal vein is homogeneously beta 2. 5. The method is very useful to essay beta-agonists and beta-antagonists. As straight regression lines with very high correlation coefficients are obtained, the potency and efficacy of agonists may be relatively easily obtained.", 
    "12": "Bisoprolol is a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with no partial agonist (intrinsic sympathomimetic) activity or membrane stabilising (local anaesthetic) activity. The oral bioavailability of bisoprolol is high (90%) and the drug has a long elimination half-life which allows once-daily administration; in addition, it is hepatically and renally cleared in equal proportions. In non-comparative studies, and comparative trials, bisoprolol proved effective, and as efficacious as atenolol, low doses of metoprolol, diuretics and nifedipine SR in hypertension, and atenolol and verapamil in stable angina pectoris. Bisoprolol has been well tolerated in most patients. Thus, bisoprolol is an effective alternative to other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension or stable angina pectoris. Furthermore, its unique pharmacokinetic properties may offer advantages in selected patients. However, the results of further comparative studies with established agents in the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris are still awaited so that a final assessment of the relative place in therapy of bisoprolol in these disease states may be made.", 
    "13": "Drug candidates for the prevention of first and recurrent variceal bleeding include 1) vasoconstrictors, 2) vasodilators and 3) various drugs increasing lower esophageal sphincter pressure. 1) Nonselective and beta 2-selective beta-adrenergic blockers act through vasoconstriction at the level of the splanchnic arterioles, which adds to the effect of decreased cardiac output. Nonselective beta-blockers decrease portal pressure in most but not all patients by about 10-15%. Azygos venous blood flow, however, is decreased up to 40% in virtually all patients. Data on the efficacy of the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol in the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage derived from prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trials are controversial. While one study showed a decrease in both rebleeding rates and long-term mortality in alcoholic cirrhotics with good liver function, these positive results were not confirmed by several subsequent trials. It has been argued that this discrepancy might be the consequence, at least in part, of differences in patient selection. In contrast, three randomized trials did not show any difference in rebleeding rates and survival between propranolol and endoscopic sclerotherapy thus indicating that propranolol might be useful for the prevention of variceal rebleeding. Preliminary results of placebo-controlled trials of propranolol and nadolol for the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding also suggest a potential role for beta-blockers in the treatment of portal hypertension. 2) Vasodilator candidates in the treatment of portal hypertension are nitrates, calcium channel blockers, serotonin antagonists, peripheral alpha-adrenergic blockers like prazosine and central alpha-stimulators such as clonidine. The action of nitrates is most probably mediated by reflex splanchnic vasoconstriction consequent on peripheral systemic vasodilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "1. The effects of single oral doses of 10 mg bisoprolol and 400 mg acebutolol on respiratory function were studied in nine smokers with airway obstruction in a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment. 2. The effects of the drugs were assessed by measuring specific airway conductance (sGaw) for 3 h after their administration and by studying their interaction with the bronchodilator response to inhaled salbutamol. 3. sGaw did not change for 3 h after bisoprolol or acebutolol administration. The bronchodilator response to inhaled salbutamol was not affected by bisoprolol but significantly reduced by acebutolol (P less than 0.05 vs placebo). 4. Under these conditions, bisoprolol behaves like a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist but acebutolol exhibits less beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity.", 
    "15": "Effects of three beta antagonist eye drops are studied in three parallel groups of asthmatic patients. Each ocular topic lowers FEV1 with a maximal effect of -13.4 +/- 2.1% for timolol (n = 15), -17.9 +/- 3.3% for metipranolol (n = 10), and -8.6 +/- 3.0% for carteolol (n = 10). Vital capacity, systolic and diastolic pressure scarcely change, but all three eye drops give a dose dependent sinus bradycardia. Intravenous infusion of isoproterenol (exclusive beta agonist) shows an important inhibition of cardiac receptors by timolol. Doses necessary to increase heart rate of 50% are of 0.242 +/- 0.019 microgram/kg before eye drops are instilled and of 0.647 +/- 0.054 microgram/kg after timolol treatment. This study stresses out the necessity of following recommended doses and respecting carefully classical contra indications of beta blocking agents and specially asthma.", 
    "16": "Some of the disturbances encountered in patients with chronic cerebral vasculopathies may be attributable to associated or concomitant pathologies such as arterial hypertension. In many of the papers published on citicoline it is less than clear whether the improvement in the symptoms is the result of the treatment of the hypertension or the substance used. In conclusion, the importance of correct treatment of hypertension in order to cure certain standard chronic cerebral vasculopathies is emphasised and the value of citicoline in improving kinesthesis, mnemonic and perceptive-motor efficiency is confirmed.", 
    "17": "The binding to catecholamines to the beta-adrenergic receptors on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes rapidly inhibits cell responses stimulated by chemoattractant ligands. As a first step in understanding the mechanism of the inhibition, we investigated the number of beta-receptors required to optimally block superoxide anion production, a response that is measured kinetically by a convenient spectrophotometric assay for the reduction of cytochrome c. We found that after blockade of 50-60% of the beta-adrenergic receptors with an irreversible antagonist, maximal inhibition of the response was still elicited by isoproterenol (ISO). Next we investigated the kinetics with which superoxide generation is inhibited. We found that half-maximal inhibition was observed at 3 x 10(-8) M ISO, which approximates the Kd because many of the receptors are involved. Cell responsiveness recovered when propranolol was added between the time of ISO and chemoattractant addition. From the recovery we estimated that the half-time for ISO dissociation is less than 10 sec. Finally, we examined the rate at which cell responses decay following ISO administration after chemoattractant. Optimal rates of inhibition, turning off oxidant production in seconds, occur at ISO concentrations greater than or equal to 3 x 10(-7) M. Taken together, these observations are consistent with an association rate constant for ISO estimated to be greater than or equal to 10(8) M-1min-1 and a dissociation rate constant greater than or equal to 4 min-1. These results are discussed in terms of the available data concerning the binding of agonists to beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "18": "The muscarinic receptors coupled to pepsinogen secretion on isolated frog esophageal peptic cells have been characterized using functional and radioligand binding techniques. N-[3H]methylscopolamine [( 3H]NMS) binding to intact cells was complex and indicative of a high affinity, low capacity site and a high capacity uptake site. Binding to the high capacity site was inhibited by atropine with high affinity (IC50, 3 nM) and by imipramine and propranolol with IC50 values of 70 and 270 nM, respectively. After inhibition of uptake by 30 microM propranolol, [3H]NMS bound to a single population of high affinity sites (KD, 125 +/- 16 pM), which exhibited binding site maximum of 2.1 fmol/10(6) cells, equivalent to 1260 sites/cell. Binding to these sites was reversible, stereoselective and inhibited by muscarinic receptor agonists with an order of potency: oxotremorine greater than acetylcholine greater than carbachol greater than bethanechol and by antagonists with an order of potency:atropine greater than 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide greater than pirenzepine greater than AF-DX 116 (11-2[2-[[diethylamino) methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]-benzodiazepine-6-one). Pepsinogen secretion was stimulated by the agonists with an order of potency: acetylcholine greater than or equal to carbachol greater than oxotremorine greater than bethanechol. Atropine, pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 competitively inhibited carbachol-stimulated pepsinogen secretion with pA2 values of 9.58, 7.37 and 6.68, respectively, which correlated with their log (inhibition constants) for receptor binding. By contrast, agonists with significant efficacy exhibited EC50 values which were 20 to 90 times lower than their inhibition constants for binding which suggests the possibility of \"spare\" muscarinic receptors. Our findings indicate that functional muscarinic receptors on peptic cells exhibit similar characteristics to the high affinity sites labeled by [3H]NMS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "We observed the effects of carvedilol, a novel beta adrenoceptor blocker, on electrical responses of smooth muscle cells produced by endogenous and exogenous norepinephrine (NE) in isolated canine mesenteric artery and vein. Carvedilol inhibited the NE-induced depolarization in the artery but not in vein, with potencies equivalent to prazosin, i.e., carvedilol blocked alpha 1 adrenoceptors in arterial smooth muscles. Stimulation of perivascular nerves evoked an excitatory junction potential (e.j.p.) and a slow depolarization in these vascular smooth muscles. Carvedilol inhibited the slow depolarization evoked in the artery but not in the vein, with no marked inhibition of the e.j.p.s. High concentrations (10(-5) M) of carvedilol inhibited the e.j.p., slow depolarization, and also the compound action potentials of sympathetic nerve bundles running along the mesenteric vessels, suggesting that these inhibitions were due to local anesthetic actions. The e.j.p. amplitude was increased by isoprenaline and was decreased by NE. The NE and isoprenaline actions were antagonized by yohimbine and propranolol, respectively. Carvedilol inhibited the isoprenaline-actions but not the NE actions on the e.j.p., suggesting that this drug blocked prejunctional beta adrenoceptors but not the alpha 2 adrenoceptors. These results indicate that carvedilol blocks alpha 1 and beta adrenoceptors but not alpha 2 adrenoceptors in vascular tissues.", 
    "20": "To further our understanding of the functional role of catecholaminergic systems in regulating hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion, we assessed the direct effects of a multiplicity of catecholamine agonists and antagonists on hypothalamic CRH secretion. To accomplish this, we used an in vitro rat hypothalamic organ culture system in which CRH secretion from single explants was evaluated by a specific RIA (IR-rCRH). Norepinephrine (NE) stimulated IR-rCRH secretion dose dependently, with peak effects in the nanomolar range. The effect of NE was antagonized by the mixed alpha antagonist phentolamine, the alpha 1 antagonist prazosin, and the alpha 2 antagonist yohimbine, but not by the beta blocker, L-propanolol. Compatible with these data were the findings that the alpha 1 agonist phenylephrine and the alpha 2 agonist clonidine both stimulated IR-rCRH secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. On the other hand, whereas the beta agonist, isoproterenol, caused a weak, non-dose-dependent increase in IR-rCRH secretion, this effect could not be antagonized by L-propanolol. Despite pretreatment with serotonin and acetylcholine antagonists, the effect of NE upon IR-rCRH secretion was undiminished, suggesting that NE-induced CRH secretion is not mediated by either neurotransmitter. On the other hand, pretreatment with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) attenuated NE-induced IR-rCRH secretion. Whereas epinephrine (E) stimulated IR-rCRH secretion, this occurred only at higher concentrations, and was antagonized by phentolamine, but not by L-propanolol. Dopamine (DA) had a weak stimulatory effect that could be antagonized by the DA1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, but not by phentolamine. We conclude that NE and E stimulate hypothalamic IR-rCRH secretion via alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptors. The effect of NE upon IR-rCRH secretion is not apparently mediated by serotonergic or cholinergic interneurons, but is modulated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. These data support the idea that the central catecholaminergic systems are excitatory rather than inhibitory upon CRH secretion when acting directly at the hypothalamic level.", 
    "21": "Our objectives were 1) to investigate the extent to which the pulmonary vascular response to increasing cardiac index after a period of hypotension and hypoperfusion (defined as reperfusion) measured in conscious dogs is altered during pentobarbital sodium anesthesia, and 2) to determine whether pentobarbital anesthesia modifies autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation of the pulmonary circulation during reperfusion. Base-line and reperfusion pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots were generated by stepwise inflation and deflation, respectively, of an inferior vena caval occluder to vary Q in conscious and pentobarbital-anesthetized (30 mg/kg iv) dogs. During pentobarbital anesthesia, controlled ventilation (without positive end-expiratory pressure) allowed matching of systemic arterial and mixed venous blood gases to conscious values. Marked pulmonary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.01) was observed during reperfusion in pentobarbital-anesthetized but not in conscious dogs. Both sympathetic alpha-adrenergic receptor block and total ANS ganglionic block attenuated, but did not abolish, the pulmonary vasoconstriction during reperfusion in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Neither sympathetic beta-adrenergic receptor block nor cholinergic receptor block enhanced the magnitude of the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to reperfusion during pentobarbital anesthesia. Thus, in contrast to the conscious state, the pulmonary vascular response to reperfusion is characterized by active, non-flow-dependent pulmonary vasoconstriction during pentobarbital anesthesia. This response is primarily, but not exclusively, mediated by sympathetic alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction and is not offset by either sympathetic beta-adrenergic or cholinergic vasodilation. These results indicate, that, compared with the conscious state, pentobarbital anesthesia modifies pulmonary vasoregulation, during reperfusion following hypotension and hypoperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "The mechanisms underlying the vascular responses of superficial fibular nerve stimulation (SFNS) have not been defined. Right hindpaws of anesthetized heparinized dogs were vascularly and neurally isolated, enclosed in a volume recorder, and perfused with controlled pressure. Vascular volume (VV) (131I-labeled albumin) and rate of tissue volume changes (VT) (plethysmography) were determined. SFNS increased blood flow resistance, reduced capillary filtration coefficient (CFC) and permeability-surface area product (PS) of 86Rb, increased VV, and reduced 131I-albumin recovery. VT increased at the rate of 3.35 +/- 0.45 ml/min. SFNS during terbutaline increased resistance, CFC, PS, and VV were unchanged, 131I-albumin recovery was complete, and VT increased at one-fourth the control rate. Phentolamine and yohimbine blocked all responses to SFNS. Prazosin with SFNS attenuated hemodynamic changes and VT increased to two-thirds of control, decreased VV, albumin, and Rb recovery but not PS and CFC. SFNS during pyrilamine maleate reduced VT increase to two-thirds of control rate and blocked decreases in PS and CFC. Metiamide did not change the SFNS responses, except to reduce vascular volume and VT. The combined histamine H1 and H2 blockers reduced VT increase to one-third of control and attenuated albumin loss, prevented histamine dilation, attenuated vasopressin and norepinephrine but not angiotensin constriction. SFNS stimulation increased precapillary resistance by alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors and venous resistance by alpha 2-receptors and increased permeability by histamine release from endothelium.",

Esmolol was infused intravenously to a maximal dose of 300 micrograms/kg body weight per min for less than or equal to 48 h in 16 patients: 9 with acute myocardial infarction, 6 with periinfarction angina and 1 with acute unstable angina. The sinus rate and systolic arterial pressure declined rapidly in all patients from baseline values of 99 +/- 12 beats/min and 126 +/- 19 mm Hg to 80 +/- 14 beats/min (p less than 0.05) and 107 +/- 20 mm Hg (p less than or equal to 0.05) during esmolol treatment. Rate-pressure product decreased by 33% and cardiac index by 14% during esmolol treatment, but pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was not significantly altered by drug infusion (19 +/- 3 mm Hg at baseline versus 19 +/- 5 during treatment, p = NS). In all patients there was a rapid return toward baseline hemodynamic measurements within 15 min of stopping administration of esmolol, and virtually complete resolution of drug effect was evident within approximately 30 min. During infusion of esmolol, four of nine patients receiving intravenous nitroglycerin required downward adjustment of nitroglycerin infusion rate to maintain systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol changes were followed in 45 men with coronary heart disease who underwent 12 weeks of monitored aerobic exercise. Twenty-five patients who were taking a nonselective beta-receptor blocking drug (Group 1) did not demonstrate a significant change in HDL cholesterol after exercise (mean difference 2.8 +/- 11.5 mg/dl), whereas patients who had not received a beta-blocking drug for greater than or equal to 3 months (Group 2) showed a significant increase (mean difference 8.4 +/- 5.5 mg/dl; p less than 0.05). However, for those patients in each group who had an initial HDL cholesterol level less than 35 mg/dl before exercise, there was a significant increase in HDL cholesterol levels (mean difference 8 +/- 6.9 mg/dl [p less than 0.02] and 11 +/- 3 mg/dl [p less than 0.001] for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively) and a significant decrease in the low density lipoprotein (LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio (mean difference -1.2 +/- 1.6 [p less than 0.05] and -0.9 +/- 0.57 [p less than 0.001], respectively). Patients in both groups who started exercise with an HDL cholesterol level greater than 35 mg/dl did not show a significant change after exercise. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 achieved similar levels of exercise training after 12 weeks and were closely matched in age, medications, alcohol intake and smoking. The results indicate that among high risk patients (with an abnormally low HDL cholesterol level) exercise training can induce an augmentation of HDL cholesterol in those receiving a beta-blocking drug similar to that of patients not receiving such a drug.", 
    "26": "1. We have examined the binding of (-)[125]-cyanopindolol ((-)[125I]-CYP) to membranes prepared from uterus and lung of dioestrous and post-partum (1-6 days) guinea-pigs. 2. The densities of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in circular and longitudinal myometrium from dioestrous animals were similar, and approximately one-eight of those in the lung. Ascorbate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in the incubation medium did not affect binding. 3. The numbers and affinities of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in both myometrial layers and in lung parenchyma from post-partum animals were similar to those in corresponding tissues from dioestrous animals. 4. The distribution of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in the post-partum uterus was examined using receptor autoradiography. Binding to circular and longitudinal muscle layers and to the endometrium was inhibited by (-)-propranolol (1 mumol/l), by the beta 2-adrenoceptor selective antagonist ICI 118,551 (70 nmol/l), but not by the beta 1-adrenoceptor selective antagonist CGP 20712A (100 nmol/l), indicating that the beta-adrenoceptor present was of the beta 2-subtype. 5. The ability of isoprenaline to compete for (--)[125]-CYP binding sites in uterine membranes from post-partum animals was approximately twice that in corresponding preparations from dioestrous animals. 6. Changes in the numbers or affinity of beta 2-adrenoceptors cannot account for the marked and selective enhancement of the actions of sympathomimetic amines at beta-adrenoceptors previously observed in longitudinal myometrium taken from post-partum guinea-pigs. It is suggested that enhancement of later steps in the chain of events between beta-adrenoceptor occupancy and uterine relaxation, and/or a decrease in the contribution of alpha-adrenoceptors to the net effect of the amine might provide alternative explanations.", 
    "27": "Administration of a supramaximal dose of GRF 1-44 (200 micrograms, i.v.) to normal human volunteers increased GH levels while a further bolus of GRF (200 micrograms i.v.) given 2 hours later failed to increase plasma GH levels. In contrast, alpha-adrenergic receptor agonism with either propranolol-adrenaline infusion or clonidine increased plasma GH levels at a time when GH responses to this supramaximal dose of GRF were absent. This indicates that alpha-adrenergic pathways stimulate GH secretion through a non-GRF-dependent mechanism in normal human subjects.", 
    "28": "Stimulation of the left atrial receptors in dogs anaesthetized with chloralose results in a reflex diuresis and natriuresis. The efferent limb of this reflex is though to have at least three components: nervous, haemodynamic and humoral. The present study was designed to investigate the humoral component in dogs anaesthetized with chloralose; to determine whether a humoral agent, other than vasopressin, might be causative in this reflex diuresis. The nervous and haemodynamic components were prevented by pharmacological denervation. Any possible contribution to the diuresis by a decrease in the plasma concentration of vasopressin was prevented by the removal of the pituitary gland. In animals in which a spontaneous diuresis followed hypophysectomy, an infusion of arginine vasopressin sufficient to maintain urine flow in the normal range for these dogs anaesthetized with chloralose was given. Distension of small balloons at the pulmonary vein-atrial junctions and in the left atrial appendage discretely to stimulate the atrial receptors in eleven dogs anaesthetized with chloralose resulted in a significant diuresis. It was concluded that a blood-borne agent other than vasopressin was responsible for the observed diuresis. At the moment it is not known whether vasopressin or the diuretic agent, or both, are involved in the diuresis accompanying the stimulation of atrial receptors.", 
    "29": "Diazinon, an organophosphorous compound, produced hyperglycemia and reduced the glycogen content of the brain 2 h after its administration to rats (40 mg/kg, i.p.). The activities of the glycogenolytic enzymes, glycogen phosphorylase and phosphoglucomutase, were significantly increased, while that of glucose-6-phosphatase was not altered. Atropine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) given immediately after diazinon abolished the changes; tolazoline or propranolol (each at 10 mg/kg, i.p.) injected 30 min before the administration of diazinon significantly reduced the hyperglycemia and the increase in brain glycogenolysis. A combination of tolazoline and propranolol was more effective than either of them alone and completely abolished the hyperglycemia and the changes in brain glycogenolysis. It may be concluded that diazinon initially activates central cholinergic processes leading to hyperglycemia and increased cerebral glycogenolysis in animals.", 
    "30": "1. (-)-Atenolol was used as a tool to assess the function of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in human heart. Right atrial and left ventricular preparations from patients undergoing open heart surgery were set up to contract isometrically. Membrane particles were prepared for beta-adrenoceptor labelling with [3H]-(-)-bupranolol and adenylate cyclase assays. 2. The positive inotropic effects of (-)-noradrenaline were antagonized to a similar extent by (-)-atenolol in atrial and ventricular preparations. (-)-Atenolol consistently antagonized the effects of (-)-adrenaline to a lesser extent than those of (-)-noradrenaline in atrial preparations. In ventricular preparations (-)-atenolol antagonized the effects of low concentrations of (-)-adrenaline to a lesser extent than those of high concentrations. 3. pKB values (M) of (-)-atenolol, estimated with non-linear analysis from the blockade of the positive inotropic effects of the catecholamines, were 7.4 for beta 1-adrenoceptors and 6.0 for beta 2-adrenoceptors. 4. (-)-Atenolol inhibited the binding of [3H]-(-)-bupranolol to ventricular beta 1-adrenoceptors with a pKD (M) of 5.9 and to ventricular beta 2-adrenoceptors with a pKD of 4.6. 5. (-)-Atenolol inhibited the catecholamine-induced adenylate cyclase stimulation in the atrium and ventricle with pKB values of 5.8-6.4 for beta 1- and pKB values of 4.7-5.7 for beta 2-adrenoceptors. The binding and cyclase assays suggest a partial affinity loss for (-)-atenolol inherent to membrane preparations. 6. beta 1-Adrenoceptors mediate the maximum positive inotropic effects of (-)-noradrenaline in both the atrium and ventricle of man. beta 2-Adrenoceptors appear to be capable of mediating maximal positive inotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline in atrium. In contrast, ventricular beta 2-adrenoceptors mediated only submaximal effects of (-)-adrenaline.", 
    "31": "1. Receptor autoradiography with (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol (CYP) was used to study the distribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes in the human internal mammary artery and saphenous vein. 2. Images from X-ray film and nuclear emulsion coated coverslips, exposed to [125I]-CYP labelled sections, showed a high density of beta 2-adrenoceptors localized to the endothelium of the internal mammary artery and fewer beta 2-adrenoceptors on the smooth muscle. 3. The function of beta-adrenoceptors in ring preparations of the internal mammary artery was investigated in organ bath studies. (-)-Isoprenaline produced concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine contracted rings. The potency and maximal effects of (-)-isoprenaline were not influenced by the presence of the endothelium. 4. Images of [125I]-CYP binding to the saphenous vein, from X-ray film and nuclear emulsion coated coverslips, showed localization of beta 2-adrenoceptors to the outer smooth muscle and not to the endothelium. 5. Relaxation of mammary artery and saphenous vein to (-)-isoprenaline is mediated via beta 2-adrenoceptors located on the smooth muscle. Endothelial beta 2-adrenoceptors, although present on the internal mammary artery, mediate other functions.", 
    "32": "Studies have been made on the binding of labeled ligands to beta-adrenoreceptor--3H-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and 125I-iodocyanopindolol (ICP--in crude homogenate and subcellular fractions of toad embryos during cleavage divisions. Specific binding of these ligands was observed which is confirmed by a decrease of the activity after addition of cold propranolol or adrenalin. The value of Kd for DHA is equal to 3 x 10(-9) M for ICP--to 1.5 x 10(-9) M. In addition to this high-affinity pool of binding with a low capacity, a low-affinity and high-capacity pool was also found. Cooling of the preparation up to 4 degrees C for 2 h increases the specific binding simultaneously with a decrease of the affinity of adrenoreceptive structures of the embryo. The data obtained are discussed in relation to the criteria of intracellular transmitter process.", 
    "33": "The centrally acting beta adrenergic agonist clenbuterol has been shown to produce specific effects on behavior maintained under differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate and multiple fixed-interval/fixed-ratio schedules. In the present study, experiments were carried out to determine whether these effects of clenbuterol were mediated by beta adrenergic receptors in the brain or in the periphery. This was accomplished by comparing the antagonistic potencies of the beta adrenergic antagonists propranolol and CGP-12177, following systemic administration. These compounds were found to exhibit similar affinities for beta adrenergic receptors in vitro. They also inhibited 125I-pindolol binding, in vivo, to rat heart and lung with similar potencies. By contrast, CGP-12177, being hydrophilic relative to propranolol, was approximately 100-fold less potent than propranolol at inhibiting 125I-pindolol binding in cerebral cortex and cerebellum, in vivo. The potencies of propranolol and CGP-12177 for antagonizing the behavioral effects of clenbuterol also were determined. CGP-12177 was about 40-fold less potent than propranolol at antagonizing the behavioral effects of clenbuterol. These results suggest that the changes in the goal-oriented behaviors produced by clenbuterol were predominantly a result of activation of central, rather than peripheral, beta adrenergic receptors. For this reason, it appears that centrally acting beta adrenergic agonists like clenbuterol may be useful pharmacological tools to study the relationship between activation of central beta adrenergic receptors and behavior.", 
    "34": "It was shown that in the rats exposed to hyperbaric oxygenation, as compared to the animals being under normal atmospheric conditions, nitroglycerin did not increase the level of free radicals (FR) in the myocardium and liver and significantly decreased the amplitude of nitrosyl complexes of iron in the liver. The obsidan-induced changes of FR and final products of lipid peroxidation in the myocardium were prevented. Isoptine was found to increase the contents of FR and final products of lipid peroxidation in the animal liver.", 
    "35": "The binding characteristics of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors, lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors and platelet imipramine receptors were studied in five women during their menstrual cycle. A significant cyclic variation in the number of beta 2-adrenoceptor sites on intact lymphocytes was found during the menstrual cycle, while binding to alpha 2-adrenoceptors and imipramine receptors remained unchanged.", 
    "36": "The beta-adrenergic ligand iodocyanopindolol (ICP) bound specifically to hepatic plasma membrane preparations from the axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum (Bmax, 40 fmol/mg protein (P) at free concentration above 140 pM; KD, 42 pM); the toad, Xenopus laevis (Bmax, 200 fmol/mg P at 1 nM; KD, 300 pM); and the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri (Bmax, 100 fmol/mg P at 5 nM). For the lungfish, the Scatchard plot was curved showing two classes of binding site with KD's of 20 and 500 pM. Neither the alpha 1-adrenergic ligand prazosin nor the alpha 2-adrenergic ligand yohimbine bound specifically to hepatic membrane preparations from any of the three species. Several adrenergic ligands displaced ICP from hepatic membrane preparations of all three species with KD's of Axolotl--propranolol, 50 nM; isoprenaline, 600 nM; adrenaline, 10 microM; phenylephrine, 20 microM; noradrenaline, 40 microM; and phentolamine, greater than 100 microM; X. laevis--propranolol, 30 nM; isoprenaline, 100 microM; adrenaline, 200 microM; noradrenaline, 300 microM; phenylephrine, 1 mM; and phentolamine, greater than 1 mM; N. forsteri,--propranolol, 25 nM; isoprenaline, 1 microM; adrenaline, 20 microM; phenylephrine, 35 microM; noradrenaline, 600 microM; and phentolamine, 400 microM. These findings suggest that alpha-adrenergic receptors are not present in hepatic plasma membrane preparations from these three species and that the hepatic actions of catecholamines are mediated via beta-adrenergic receptors. The order of binding of the beta-adrenergic ligands suggests that the receptors are of the beta 2 type.", 
    "37": "Nalbuphine, an analgesic with opiate agonist and antagonist properties, increases heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cardiac function following a moderate hemorrhage in the rat. The interaction between opiate receptors and the sympathoadrenal system was examined in control, beta receptor-blocked, and adrenal-demedullated animals. MAP and heart rate were measured continuously in chronically instrumented conscious animals. Hemorrhage decreased MAP in the control group by 50%, and nalbuphine (1 mg/kg) returned this to prehemorrhage values within 5 min. MAP remained significantly greater in the nalbuphine-treated animals for 120 min. Heart rate fell with hemorrhage and increased above prehemorrhage values in the nalbuphine-treated animals. The pressor response to nalbuphine was abolished in both beta-blocked and adrenal-demedullated animals. Plasma catecholamines were not significantly elevated in the nalbuphine-treated as compared to control animals, which suggests that nalbuphine effects do not result from an enhancement of central mediated sympathoadrenal discharge. The opiate receptor antagonist naloxone, in a concentration that was not by itself effective in alleviating the hypotensive effects of hemorrhage, prevented the pressor response with nalbuphine. These results suggest that nalbuphine's beneficial effects in hemorrhagic shock depend on an intact sympathoadrenal system and on an interaction with opiate receptor sites, possibly in the heart.", 
    "38": "We used radioligand binding methods to characterize beta-adrenergic receptors on endothelial cells cultured from adult human iliac vein (HIVE) and bovine fetal aorta (BFAE). For comparison, we also studied the well-characterized C6 glioma cell line (C6). Both human and bovine endothelial cells showed specific saturable binding of [125I]iodopindolol. There was no difference in the binding affinity (KD) of iodopindolol to membranes from the three cell types. However, the beta-receptor density (Bmax) was greater on HIVE cells and BFAE cells than on C6 cells. Displacement of ligand from HIVE and BFAE cells by zinterol or from BFAE cells by ICI 89,406 was consistent with binding to the beta 2-subtype. In contrast, displacement of ligand from C6 cells by zinterol or ICI 89,406 was consistent with binding to both beta 1- and beta 2-subtypes. Exposing BFAE cells in culture to 10 microM isoproterenol for 6 h resulted in a 55% decrease in Bmax without a change in KD. We conclude that 1) human and bovine endothelial cells in culture contain a substantial population of beta-adrenergic receptors, which are predominantly of the beta 2-subtype, and 2) endothelial beta-receptors exhibit downregulation by beta-agonists in culture.", 
    "39": "Exposure of cultured heart muscle cells to noradrenaline led to a decrease in the effects of isoproterenol and prostaglandin E1 on cAMP formation and contraction velocity. However, heterologous desensitization, as measured by prostaglandin E1 stimulation, only occurred at higher noradrenaline concentrations than homologous desensitization (isoproterenol stimulation). As the defects of the adenylate cyclase system in heart failure are attributed to noradrenaline-induced desensitization, it is concluded from the results that, in comparison to the subsensitivity to beta-adrenoceptor agonists in failing human hearts, a decrease in the responsiveness to other receptor-dependent adenylate cyclase stimulators should also occur but only at higher degrees of heart failure.", 
    "40": "Treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs may result in augmented plasma concentrations of noradrenaline during exercise. The effect of propranolol on exercise heart rate and its relationship to plasma concentrations of propranolol and noradrenaline were examined in 10 hospitalized volunteers following treatment with propranolol, in doses of 80 mg and 320 mg daily. Responses to submaximal treadmill exercise during propranolol treatment and following discontinuation of the higher dose were compared to pre-drug and post drug placebo values. Exercise noradrenaline was increased by 67% over baseline values by treatment with the 320 mg daily dose of propranolol; this increment was present at 4 h and returned to baseline by 16 h after drug administration. Augmentation of exercise noradrenaline was correlated with plasma propranolol concentrations; the threshold concentration for this effect was 10-fold higher than the threshold for reduction in exercise heart rate. The effect of propranolol on heart rate was blunted in relation to the augmentation of exercise noradrenaline (P less than 0.001). These relationships suggest that, in patients taking high doses of propranolol, drug induced augmentation of plasma levels of noradrenaline during exercise may have physiologic importance. Enhanced effects on adrenergic receptors could have clinical relevance in certain groups of patients.", 
    "41": "Severe hypertension may be a difficult management issue, and it often requires therapy with multiple drugs at frequent dosing intervals. We report on the antihypertensive effects of the alpha-beta adrenergic blocking agent, labetalol, in combination with enalapril, a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, administered to 14 patients with severe hypertension (nine of whom had nephrosclerosis or renal artery stenosis) on other antihypertensive drug therapies. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), hematologic and blood chemistry values, and adverse side effects were monitored at 24 hours, 1 week, and 4 weeks of therapy. Rapid titration of the drugs was performed in the hospital in 10 patients; four were managed closely as outpatients. Following one month of combination therapy blood pressure decreased from 212 +/- 31/120 +/- 16 mm Hg at baseline to 155 +/- 19/86 +/- 12 mm Hg, and heart rate declined from 86 +/- 18 bpm to 70 +/- 16 bpm. Ten of the 14 patients (71%) maintained good BP control (BP less than 140/90 mm Hg) with no additional treatment. Serum potassium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen concentrations, and hematologic parameters did not significantly change in 13 of 14 patients. Three patients developed symptomatic postural hypotension; in one patient this side effect resulted in discontinuation from the study. These data suggest that combination therapy with labetalol and enalapril is effective in lowering BP in patients with severe essential or renovascular hypertension. An additional advantage of this regimen is the twice-daily dosing interval, which may promote better long-term compliance.", 
    "42": "The role of intracellular signals in the regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release was studied using the isolated left and right atria from a rat. The atria were perfused with Tyrode's solution, equilibrated with 95% O2-5% CO2 at 37 degrees C with a constant flow of 0.5 ml/min. Addition of epinephrine (10(-6) M), an alpha- and beta-agonist, to the perfusate induced the biphasic release of ANP from the right atrium without effect on the left. The initial peak (19.2 +/- 2.6 pg.min-1.ml-1) occurs 2-4 min after the administration of epinephrine, which lasted 4-6 min and returned to base line (10.4 +/- 1.1 pg.min-1.mg-1). The second peak (16.5 +/- 2.0 pg.min-1.ml-1) appeared 30-35 min after epinephrine administration and was sustained for 100 min, at which time the experiment was terminated. The first peak was stimulated by isoproterenol (10(-6) M), a beta-agonist, and blunted by propranolol (10(-6) M), a beta-antagonist. The second peak appeared following methoxamine (10(-6) M), an alpha-agonist, and could be suppressed by phentolamine (10(-6) M), an alpha-antagonist. These studies indirectly suggest that the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate system and the inositol triphosphate system are involved in ANP secretion, with the former responsible for the initial rapid release and the latter maintaining the secretion.", 
    "43": "Surgical (removal of a superior cervical ganglion) or chemical [(administration of a single dose of 6 hydroxydopamine (6 OHDA) (50 mg/kg dose body wt)] sympathectomy of rats at 2 or 8 days of age resulted in an increase in [3H]DHA binding of membranes of parotid gland of young rats (age range 21 days to 48 days). The increase progressed with postnatal age; at 21 days of age (surgical sympathectomy), it was 13%; at 32 days of age with 6 OHDA, it was as much as 34%, but only 26% at 42 days of age with surgical sympathectomy. No change in [3H]QNB binding was observed at any postnatal ages following neonatal sympathectomy. Conversely, surgical sympathectomy of the parotid of adult rat resulted in little or no change in [3H]DHA binding at 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks postdenervation, but [3H]QNB binding was reduced at all periods, with the reduction from control values at 2 weeks being 34%, and at the subsequent intervals, 24-26%. The increase in number of beta adrenoceptors of the parotid gland was not related to the kind of sympathectomy (chemical or surgical) or neonatal age at which it was done; however, duration of the denervation for 2-3 weeks was necessary for the receptor increase to occur. In the adult, however, the duration of the denervation was of no importance since change in number of beta adrenoceptors did not occur at 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks after surgical denervation but did occur after only 1 week after of reserpine-induced denervation. QNB binding was decreased with surgical sympathectomy as well as reserpine-induced sympathectomy of adult parotid gland; norepinephrine concentration was decreased to levels of a few percent of innervated glands. The relation between development of glandular supersensitivity and increase in beta adrenoceptors is discussed.", 
    "44": "Catecholamines regulate lipolysis in rat fat cells via beta-adrenergic receptors. Recently, it has been proposed that beta-adrenergic receptors of rat fat cells are neither beta 1 nor beta 2 in character but rather an 'isoreceptor,' 'hybrid,' or 'beta 3' [Br. J. Pharmacol. 84:131-137 (1985)]. This putative receptor subtype has been envisioned as possessing an alkanolamine side-chain interaction site of beta 1 nature and an aromatic moiety interaction site of beta 2 nature. These proposals were evaluated in the present work through a reexamination of the nature of the fat cell beta-adrenergic receptor using four radioligands that differ chemically in one or both of these regions of the molecule as well as in their hydrophobicity. Equilibrium binding of agonist and of beta 1- and beta 2-subtype-selective high affinity antagonist ligands to fat cell membranes was detailed. The binding sites labeled by these ligands had the characteristics of beta 1-adrenergic receptors. The rank order of subtype-selective antagonists in competing for radioligand binding to fat cell membranes was the same as that for inhibition of agonist-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation by these ligands. At equimolar concentrations, the beta 1-selective antagonist CGP-20712A provided a greater degree of inhibition of catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis than the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI-118,551. These results document the character of the rat fat cell beta-adrenergic receptor as solely beta 1.", 
    "45": "Parotid acinar cells, prepared from pharmacologically sympathectomized adult rats (reserpine, 0.1 mg/kg/day for 1 week), display decreased responsiveness to beta adrenergic stimulation in vitro compared to cells from control and surgically sympathectomized rats. Both methods of denervation increase amylase content (amylase activity per microgram of DNA). Percent release of amylase activity and percent release of CCl3COOH-precipitable [14C]leucine were used as indicators of protein secretion. Exposure of cells from pharmacologically sympathectomized rats to the beta adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, resulted in a marked reduction in receptor-coupled secretion (67% and 75% relative to controls, respectively). 8-Bromo-cyclic AMP, like isoproterenol, was unable to surmount this reserpine-induced inhibition of stimulated secretion, suggesting that an alteration in receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling is not responsible for the observed secretion defect. Cells prepared from surgically sympathectomized rats displayed modest decreases in stimulated secretion when the same secretory markers were monitored (30% and 25% relative to controls, respectively). The number of beta adrenoreceptors [( 3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites) increased (35%), with no change in binding affinity, in membrane preparations from reserpine-treated rats. Thus, the observed inhibition of beta adrenergic agonist-induced secretion is not likely the result of alterations in beta adrenergic receptor characteristics. Short-term (1 week) surgical denervation had no effect on the number of beta adrenergic receptor sites; however, an increase in ligand binding affinity was noted. The decrease in the apparent Kd (30%) was not the result of a shift in receptor subtype as determined by competition studies with specific beta-1 (atenolol) and beta-2 (ICI 118,551) receptor antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "Experiments were carried out to characterize the pharmacological properties of enantiomers and racemic mixture of dobutamine to modulate the myocardial contractility through alpha and beta adrenoceptors in the rabbit papillary muscle. Dobutamine caused the concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect: the rank order of potency was R-(+)- greater than (+/-) - greater than S-(-)-dobutamine. The positive inotropic effect of (+)-, (-)- and (+/-)-dobutamine was antagonized by a beta adrenoceptor antagonist, (+/-)-bupranolol in a competitive manner, but was not affected by an alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin. The concentration-response curve for (-)-phenylephrine mediated by alpha adrenoceptors in the presence of 10(-6) M (+/-)-bupranolol was shifted by enantiomers of dobutamine to the right in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, enantiomers of dobutamine antagonized the positive inotropic effect of (-)-phenylephrine in a competitive manner, and pA2 values [negative logarithm of the dissociation constant (KB)] for (+)- and (-)-dobutamine were 6.67 and 5.99, respectively. The specific binding of [3H]prazosin to membrane fractions of rabbit ventricular myocardium was displaced by dobutamine with a high potency: the -log Ki values for (+)- and (-)-dobutamine were 6.43 and 5.97, respectively, which correspond well with pA2 values of these compounds for functional modification. These findings indicate that enantiomers of dobutamine elicit the positive inotropic effect through activation of beta adrenoceptors, whereas both enantiomers behave as the competitive antagonist of myocardial alpha adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic effect in the isolated rabbit papillary muscle.", 
    "47": "The effects of ethanol on the beta adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system were examined in vitro using membranes prepared from S49 lymphoma cells. Ethanol caused a dose-dependent increase in adenylate cyclase activity in membranes prepared from wild-type cells when the activity was measured in the presence of GTP. Activity measured in the presence of isoproterenol was also increased by ethanol, but the fold-stimulation by isoproterenol was lower in the presence of ethanol. Ethanol also shifted the dose-response curve for stimulation of the enzyme by isoproterenol to the right. This shift was due to a decrease in the affinity of the beta adrenergic receptor for isoproterenol. A decrease in the affinity of the receptor for the antagonists [125I]iodopindolol and propranolol was also observed, but the magnitude of this effect was less than that seen with the agonist isoproterenol. The density of binding sites for [125I]iodopindolol was not affected by ethanol. Dose-response curves for NaF and guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), both of which stimulate adenylate cyclase activity through an effect on the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gs), were shifted to the left by the addition of ethanol. In membranes prepared from the CYC- variant of S49 cells, which lacks the alpha subunit of Gs, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. The inhibition by guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) was not affected by ethanol. In membranes prepared from both wild-type and CYC- S49 cells, ethanol inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Whereas the inhibition of this activity by GTP was greatly attenuated in membranes prepared from CYC- S49 cells which had been pretreated with pertussis toxin, the inhibition by ethanol was not affected by pretreatment with pertussis toxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "Seven L-amino acids (Trp, Arg, Lys, Met, Ile, Val, and Phe) partially (28-81%) reversed the inhibitory action of 1 microM gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding to rat brain membranes, with EC50 values ranging from 5 to 120 mM. D-Trp, D-Arg, D-Lys, D-Met, D-Val, and D-Phe were approximately equipotent with their L-isomers. Tyramine, phenethylamine, and tryptamine, the decarboxylation products of the aromatic amino acids (Tyr, Phe, and Trp, respectively), reversed the inhibitory action of 1 microM GABA on [35S]TBPS binding more potently than the parent amino acids (EC50 values = 1.5-3.0 mM). Human hereditary amino acidemias involving Arg, Lys, Ile, Val, and Phe are associated with seizures, and these amino acids and/or their metabolites may block GABA-A receptors. Five other L-amino acids (ornithine, His, Glu, Pro, and Ala) as well as Gly and beta-Ala inhibited [35S]TBPS binding with IC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 37 mM, and these inhibitions were reversed by the GABA-A receptor blocker R 5135 in all cases. The inhibitory effects of L-ornithine, L-Ala, L-Glu, and L-Pro were stereospecific, because the corresponding D-isomers were considerably less inhibitory. L-His, D-His, and L-Glu gave incomplete (plateau) inhibitions. Human hereditary amino acidemias involving L-ornithine, His, Pro, Gly, and beta-Ala are also associated with seizures, and we speculate that these GABA-mimetic amino acids may desensitize GABA-A receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "The alpha-adrenoceptor agonist ST-1059 (2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl) ethanol), the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine and a nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor agonist norepinephrine, all increase cardiac output and dose-dependently increase arterial blood pressure in spinally anesthetized ganglion-blocked dogs. The increase in cardiac output may be the result of an increased venous return via the contraction of capacitance vessels, and the vasopressor responses are attributed to an increase in total peripheral resistance. The increases in cardiac output and pressor responses induced by ST-1059 and methoxamine were antagonized by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.3 mg/kg i.v.), but those induced by clonidine were not inhibited. In contrast, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) had little or no effects on the increase in cardiac output or the pressor responses induced by ST-1059 and methoxamine, but strongly attenuated those of clonidine. Prazosin and yohimbine inhibited the norepinephrine-induced increase in cardiac output and pressor responses. These results suggest that the increases in cardiac output and blood pressure induced by ST-1059 were mediated by postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation, such as by methoxamine, but that those induced by clonidine were mediated by postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation in dogs. Not only the postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors but also the postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors may play an important role in the constriction of venous beds, as well as of the arterioles in spinally anesthetized ganglion-blocked dogs.", 
    "50": "1. Arterial relaxant responses to beta-adrenoceptor agonists are decreased in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) when compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). To establish which component of the beta-adrenoceptor.adenylate cyclase (AC) system is impaired in the SHR arteries, effects of two activators of AC--cholera toxin (CTX) and forskolin--and of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db cyclic AMP) were compared between strips of femoral arteries isolated from 13 week-old SHR and age-matched WKY. 2. In the absence of timolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, contractile responses of the strips to noradrenaline (NA) were significantly greater in the SHR than in the WKY. Timolol augmented the contractile responses to NA to a smaller extent in the SHR than in the WKY. 3. After blockade by timolol of beta-adrenoceptors, contractile responses of the strips to NA through the activation of alpha-adrenoceptors were not significantly different between the two strains. 4. Pre-treatment of the strips with CTX, an activator of the stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs), produced a slow-onset and long-lived antagonism of the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contractions. The antagonism was much smaller in the SHR than in the WKY. 5. The dose-response curves of the strips from both strains for alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation with NA determined after pretreatment with CTX were comparable to those determined in the absence of timolol. 6. Forskolin, an activator of the catalytic subunit of AC, and DB cyclic AMP also antagonized the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contractions. However, these antagonisms were not significantly different between the two strains. 7. Isobutyl methylxanthine (IBMX), an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, produced a similar antagonism of the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contractions between the two strains. 8. These results suggest that a reduced function of Gs is the main factor responsible for the decreased responsiveness to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in the SHR femoral artery.", 
    "51": "To investigate the safety of labetalol in the treatment of hypertension in patients with heart failure, sixteen hypertensive patients with a history of congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction at rest less than 45%, had measurements of ejection fraction and cardiac output by first pass radionuclide angiography at baseline, at the end of 2 weeks maintenance with labetalol (titrated to the effective antihypertensive dose of 200-1600 mg daily), and in the post-treatment placebo period. On labetalol, heart rate and blood pressure were significantly lower than placebo at rest and the ejection fraction was higher (30 vs 25%) (p less than 0.05). At maximal exercise on labetalol the heart rate and blood pressure were lower than at placebo maximal exercise (p less than 0.05) and the ejection fraction was higher (32 vs 27%) (p less than 0.01). Exercise tolerance was not changed by labetalol. No patient was discontinued from the study because of worsening heart failure. Dizziness was reported in 5 of 16 patients usually at one visit. Dyspnea that was reported in 4 of 16 patients improved with minor adjustments in digitalis or diuretic dose. In conclusion, labetalol reduces blood pressure in hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction without reducing cardiac performance.", 
    "52": "We investigated the detailed mode and mechanism of action of denopamine in canine right ventricular muscle. When administered in single doses, denopamine produced a positive inotropic effect (PIE) and increased cyclic AMP levels. Concentration--response curves for both variables were sigmoid. The maximum PIE of denopamine was almost the same as that produced by isoproterenol. However, the maximum increase in cyclic AMP caused by denopamine was approximately 65% of that attained with isoproterenol. When administered cumulatively, concentration--PIE curves for denopamine were bell-shaped, ascending at 10(-7) to 10(-6) M, reaching a maximum at approximately 3 X 10(-6) M which was approximately 75% of that attained with single administrations, and descending at higher concentrations. The bell-shaped curve, which was computer-fitted, suggested that denopamine behaves as an agonist with pD2 of 6.12 and as an antagonist with pD2 of 4.50. The PIE of denopamine was antagonized by atenolol (pA2 = 7.66) but not by ICI 118,551 (less than 10(-7) M), indicating that denopamine is a selective beta 1-receptor agonist. The PIE of denopamine was augmented by 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine. The PIE and increase in cyclic AMP level caused by 3 X 10(-6) M denopamine were abolished by 10(-6) M atenolol or 3 X 10(-6) M carbachol. From these results we concluded that the PIE of denopamine is derived from the mechanism of action as a selective beta 1-receptor partial agonist. We suggested the close coupling of the beta 1-receptor-adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP system to positive inotropy.", 
    "53": "The hemodynamic and biochemical properties of bisoprolol, a new highly beta 1-adrenoceptor selective blocker, were compared with those of atenolol. The studies were performed in eight healthy volunteers and consisted of two separate parts. In the first part the effects of oral doses of 20 mg bisoprolol, 100 mg atenolol, and placebo, given in a double-blind randomized order, on the hemodynamic and biochemical changes induced by multiple doses of intravenous isoproterenol and bicycle exercise were investigated. Blood pressure and heart rate and the plasma concentrations of magnesium, potassium (K+), glucose, lactate, renin activity, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were determined. In the second part the effects of the same oral doses of bisoprolol and atenolol on changes in forearm blood flow (FBF) induced by intra-arterial (i.a.) infusions of isoproterenol and epinephrine were investigated. After both beta blockers approximately 10-times higher doses of isoproterenol i.v. were needed to obtain similar hemodynamic responses as after placebo. The hemodynamic and biochemical changes during isoproterenol i.v. and bicycle exercise were almost identically influenced by bisoprolol and atenolol. However, after bisoprolol, isoproterenol lowered plasma K+ more (p less than 0.02) and the exercise-induced increase in renin activity was less (p less than 0.02) than after atenolol. The effect of isoproterenol i.a. on FBF was attenuated to the same extent by bisoprolol and atenolol. The vasodilatory component of epinephrine i.a. was reduced only by atenolol (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that bisoprolol and atenolol are selective beta 1 antagonists. In the doses used, bisoprolol showed only slightly more potency and selectivity for beta 1 adrenoceptors than atenolol.", 
    "54": "The effects of acute and chronic treatment with beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs on peripheral adrenergic neurovascular transmission were investigated. Experiments were performed using the blood perfused gracilis muscle preparation in control dogs and in animals treated with single or repeated doses of beta-receptor antagonists. After 7 days of d,l-propranolol, l-propranolol, or atenolol administration, the arterial pressor response to sympathetic nerve stimulation was significantly reduced in treated dogs (p less than 0.05) when compared with control- or d-propranolol-treated animals. In comparison, acute beta blockade produced by a single intravenous dose of propranolol had no effect on the pressor response to nerve stimulation. Inhibition of fatty acid-cyclooxygenase activity by indomethacin or piroxicam enhanced the vasoconstrictor response to sympathetic nerve stimulation in chronic d,l-propranolol-, l-propranolol-, and atenolol-treated dogs, but had no effect on vascular neurotransmission in control-, chronic d-propranolol-, or acutely d,l-propranolol-treated animals. The vasoconstrictor response to intraarterial phenylephrine was not significantly altered by chronic propranolol treatment, and measurement of norepinephrine overflow during sympathetic nerve stimulation failed to reveal any difference in neurotransmitter release between control- and propranolol-treated dogs. The results indicate that chronic but not acute beta-adrenergic receptor blockade alters signaling at the neurovascular synapse to diminish adrenergic transmission. This effect does not appear to result from a change in postsynaptic alpha 1 receptors or from a decrease in norepinephrine release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "To determine if combinations of mexiletine and sotalol retain Class I and III electrophysiologic actions, using standard microelectrode techniques, we examined the electrophysiologic effects on canine Purkinje fibers of solutions of mexiletine (3.1-100 microM), sotalol (3.1-400 microM), and combinations of the two drugs, at stimulation frequencies of 1.5 and 2.0 Hz. The combinations consisted of 12.5 microM of one drug combined with 3.1, 12.5, and 50 microM of the other. Mexiletine caused a concentration dependent depression of Vmax, the degree of depression always being greater at the more rapid frequency. At concentrations above 50 microM, sotalol depressed Vmax slightly. Increasing the stimulation frequency did not result in further Vmax depression. The addition of sotalol did not alter the Vmax depression produced by mexiletine but prior exposure to sotalol attenuated the effect of subsequent mexiletine. Both drugs reduced action potential amplitude and in combination their effects on this parameter were additive. Sotalol prolonged and mexiletine shortened action potential duration. Low concentrations of mexiletine reversed the prolongation caused by sotalol, whereas the addition of sotalol did not alter the effect of mexiletine. Mexiletine shortened the effective refractory period at low concentrations and prolonged it at high concentrations. Sotalol prolonged the effective refractory period at all concentrations. Exposure to a low concentration of sotalol did not alter the effects on the effective refractory period of subsequent exposure to mexiletine but a low concentration of mexiletine reduced the prolongation from subsequent sotalol. Thus, the combination of mexiletine and sotalol may add a Class II action to the Class I effects of mexiletine but the mexiletine prevents the Class III effects of sotalol.", 
    "56": "Noradrenergic (NA) and serotonergic (5-HT) receptor profiles were compared in the cerebral cortex of young adult (3 months old) and aged (24 months old) male Sprague Dawley rats. Beta and alpha-1 receptors were significantly decreased in 24 month old rats, whereas alpha-2 receptors remained unchanged. 5-HT-2 Postsynaptic receptors and 5-HT high affinity uptake were reduced in aged animals; on the other hand the number of 3H-imipramine (3H-IMI) recognition sites located on serotonin nerve terminals and labelled also by 3H-paroxetine (3H-PAR), were significantly higher in the cerebral cortex of old rats. The ratio 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)/5-HT, an index of serotonin turn-over, increased in some brain areas of senescent rats. There were no age-related changes in the responsiveness of investigated binding sites to subchronic desipramine treatment; the density of beta-noradrenergic and 5-HT-2 serotonergic receptors and that of 3H-IMI binding sites was reduced both in young adult and aged rats.", 
    "57": "A high energy shock delivered by an automatic defibrillator may interfere with pacemaker function. To provide insight into the changes that occur in the threshold for ventricular pacing after the shock from an automatic defibrillator, we measured the time to capture during asynchronous ventricular pacing in dogs from endocardial or epicardial sites, after a 30 joule shock was delivered via conventional automatic defibrillator (AICD) patch electrodes. After a 30 joule shock, there was a transient loss of ventricular capture. The duration of capture loss was related to current strength. During endocardial pacing at threshold current, the time to capture was 4.9 +/- 1.2 s, whereas at current values twice threshold the time to capture from endocardial pacing was 2.2 +/- 0.9 s. No difference was found between endocardial and epicardial pacing sites in the time to capture. To ascertain the mechanism of capture loss we: (1) examined the effects of converting the pacing catheter to a current sink (transiently shunting to ground); (2) altered excitability by an infusion of flecainide; (3) blocked sympathetic input (propranolol). No change in time to capture was noted by shunting the pacer to ground. After an infusion of flecainide the time to capture from endocardial pacing was significantly prolonged to 14.9 +/- 2.2 s at the threshold value (P less than .01) and 5.6 +/- 2.1 s at twice threshold (P less than .05). Conversely, intravenous propranolol had no effect on the time to capture after shock from endocardial pacing. These data indicate that there is a transient increase in pacing threshold after the shock from an automatic defibrillator.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "The emetic action of 4-(m-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy)-2- butynyltrimethylammonium chloride (McN-A-343) was investigated in the unanaesthetized cat, after it was injected into the cerebral ventricles, through chronically-implanted cannulae. Intracerebroventricular injection of McN-A-343 produced dose-dependent and shortlasting emesis, which was not completely abolished after ablation of the area postrema. The predominantly selective muscarinic M1 antagonist, pirenzepine as well as the mixed muscarinic M1 and M2 antagonist, atropine, injected into the cerebral ventricles, attenuated or abolished the emesis evoked by intracerebroventricular McN-A-343. Both atropine and pirenzepine produced dose-dependent inhibition of the emesis evoked by McN-A-343. However, the ID50 value for atropine was approximately five times greater than that for pirenzepine. Abolition of McN-A-343-induced emesis only occurred with the largest dose of atropine (1 mg). On the other hand, selected ganglionic blocking agents, an alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, a dopamine antagonist, a 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonist and an antihistamine, all injected into the cerebral ventricles, had no significant effect on emesis evoked by McN-A-343, similarly injected. The emetic response to intracerebroventricular injection of McN-A-343 was attenuated or abolished in cats pretreated with hemicholinium-3, triethylcholine, reserpine and 6-hydroxydopamine, intracerebroventricularly. On the contrary, the emetic response to intracerebroventricular injection of McN-A-343 was not altered in cats pretreated with intracerebroventricular injections of bretylium, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine and 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine. It is postulated that the emesis produced by McN-A-343, injected into the cerebral ventricles, is mediated through muscarinic M1 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "Adrenergic involvement in the hypothermia produced by systemically administered chlordecone (CLD) was evaluated in the rat using intracisternal pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists (phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine) and beta-adrenergic antagonists (propranolol and atenolol). The effect of intraperitoneal administration of 75 mg/kg of chlordecone on colonic temperature (Tcol) in male Fischer-344 rats was measured 7 days after administration of 6-OHDA and 30 min following pretreatment with the receptor antagonists. Prior depletion of catecholamines in brain with 250 micrograms of 6-OHDA administered intracerebrally attenuated hypothermia induced by chlordecone, without affecting basal Tcol. Phenoxybenzamine (10 or 20 micrograms) and phentolamine (5 or 10 micrograms) also reduced the hypothermic response to chlordecone. The beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists propranolol (50 or 100 micrograms) and atenolol (10 or 20 micrograms) did not attenuate chlordecone-induced hypothermia. These data suggest that the hypothermia induced by chlordecone is a result of alterations in central alpha-adrenergic functions, possibly involved with the sympathetic control of vasomotor tone.", 
    "60": "C6-2B rat astrocytoma cells were used to test whether the increase of cellular nerve growth factor (NGF) content and secretion induced by isoproterenol treatment are associated with an increase in the content of mRNA that encodes NGF (NGF mRNA). Incubation of cells with isoproterenol (10 microM) for different time periods produced an increase of NGF mRNA content (3- to 5-fold over control) reaching maximum levels at 3 hr and lasting up to 24 hr. The isoproterenol effect on NGF mRNA was antagonized by the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist I-propranolol (10 microM) but not by phentolamine (10 microM), an alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist. When C6-2B astrocytoma cells were exposed for a short time to isoproterenol (10 microM; 10 or 20 min) followed by a washout period of 3 hr, the NGF mRNA content was increased by about 2-fold. The increase of NGF mRNA was obtained also with 10 microM prostaglandin E1 and this effect was potentiated by 100 microM of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Inasmuch as both isoproterenol and prostaglandin E1 increase cyclic AMP content, one can surmise that cyclic AMP is involved in the stimulation of NGF mRNA accumulation. Whether cyclic AMP directly activates NGF gene transcription or activates an intermediate step, however, cannot be assessed by the present experiments.", 
    "61": "Intravenous administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride, a central stimulant, was unexpectedly found to exert a potent analgesic effect on primary sensory symptoms in a group of patients with Parkinson's disease. This effect, which has now been studied in a short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment, subsequently disappeared if patients were pretreated with a beta-blocker or with a serotonin antagonist. Cerebrospinal fluid monoamine metabolites were determined in some of these patients, and the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level was found to be significantly lower than in parkinsonian patients without pain and in normal volunteers. Given the mechanism of action of methylphenidate on the central nervous system, the adrenergic and serotoninergic mediation of its analgesic effect, and the demonstration of impaired central serotonin metabolism in the patient group, it is concluded that not only central dopaminergic deficiency but also altered noradrenergic and serotoninergic transmission in the spinal cord are quite likely to play a role in the pathophysiology of pain in Parkinson's disease.", 
    "62": "This study aimed to detect the difference in hemodynamic and electrocardiographic responses during the prebypass period in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting who were receiving beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, calcium entry blocking drugs, or both beta-adrenergic and calcium entry blocking drugs. Electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia was noted significantly more frequently in patients receiving calcium entry blocking drugs alone at induction of anesthesia (P less than 0.03), skin incision (P less than 0.05), and sternotomy (P less than 0.002). Heart rate at sternotomy was significantly higher in patients receiving calcium entry blocking drugs (P less than 0.02) as compared to patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or the combination of both drugs. In conclusion, patients treated with calcium entry blocking drugs alone had significantly higher incidence of perioperative ischemic ECG changes compared with patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking drugs alone or in combination with calcium channel blocking drugs.", 
    "63": "The efficacy and safety of sotalol were assessed by electrophysiologic testing and ambulatory recordings in 16 patients with recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or nonfatal cardiac arrest who were refractory to an average of 4.8 conventional antiarrhythmic agents. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory recordings were performed before and after sotalol therapy. Fourteen patients underwent baseline electrophysiologic study and sustained VT was inducible in 12. Oral sotalol (320 to 960 mg/day) completely suppressed inducible sustained VT in 7 patients (58%), with modification in 3 (25%). Ventricular premature complexes were suppressed from baseline (mean +/- standard deviation) 431 +/- 616 to 60 +/- 110/hr (p less than 0.03). After a mean follow-up of 19 +/- 7 months, 12 of 14 patients receiving sotalol treatment had successful suppression of ventricular premature complexes (60 +/- 85/hr) and remained clinically free of sustained VT, except 2 who needed additional antiarrhythmic drugs to suppress the recurrent sustained VT. One patient died suddenly after 25 months of sotalol treatment. No severe side effects were noted during sotalol therapy. This study demonstrates that sotalol is a well-tolerated, effective antiarrhythmic agent in patients at high-risk for sudden death. It appears to be beneficial in patients who did not benefit from multiple drug treatment.", 
    "64": "Galanin is a 29 amino acid peptide which has been found in intrapancreatic nerves. The effects of galanin, adrenergic and cholinergic blockade as well as somatostatin on the hormone release from the isolated perfused dog pancreas were studied. It was found that galanin dose-dependently inhibited insulin (P less than 0.001) and somatostatin (P less than 0.001) but not glucagon secretion at normal glucose levels. The lowest galanin concentration that caused a significant suppression of insulin and somatostatin secretion was 10(-11) and 10(-10) mol/l, respectively. Similar effects were evident during stimulation with 2.5 mmol/l arginine. Galanin (10(-9) mol/l) caused a more pronounced inhibition of insulin and somatostatin secretion at high (10 mmol/l) and normal (5 mmol/l) than at low glucose (1.3 mmol/l). In contrast, suppression of the glucagon secretion was only seen at low glucose (1.3 mmol/l). Perfusion of 10(-6) mol/l of atropine, phentolamine and propranolol had no effect on the galanin-mediated (10(-10) mol/l) inhibition of insulin and somatostatin secretion. Galanin (10(-12)-10(-10) mol/l) and somatostatin (10(-12)-10(-10) mol/l) were equipotent in inhibiting insulin secretion whereas only somatostatin exerted a suppression of the glucagon secretion at normal glucose. Thus, galanin exerts a differential effect on islet hormone secretion and may participate in the hormonal control of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin secretion.", 
    "65": "Acute volume alterations were produced in eight anesthetized dogs to determine if the contractility of the left ventricle is partially volume-dependent. Pressures were measured in the left ventricle with a micromanometer and regional ventricular function was measured with sonomicrometers implanted in the midwall of the anterior, lateral, and posterior left ventricle. Regional end-systolic pressure-length relations (ESPLR) were determined with transient venae cavae occlusions. The ESPLR data were fitted to a quadratic equation, then end-systolic lengths were compared at matched end-systolic pressures at multiple time periods after the acute load alterations. Bilateral vagotomy, carotid sinus denervation, and stellate ganglion denervation were performed to prevent reflex alterations in contractility. The heart was paced at a constant rate. In seven animals, dextran was infused intravenously over 77 +/- 23 seconds (+/- SD) to increase left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 5 +/- 2 to 13 +/- 3 mm Hg and peak pressures from 113 +/- 11 to 147 +/- 18 mm Hg. The end-diastolic lengths increased 14 +/- 6% in the anterior, 9 +/- 2% in the lateral, and 12 +/- 4% in the posterior segments. The ESPLR was measured immediately (77 +/- 23 seconds), early (3 +/- 1 minutes), and late (10 +/- 2 minutes) after initiation of the volume load. In all three regions, there was a significant time-dependent leftward shift in the ESPLR. From 1 to 10 minutes after the volume load, the regional end-systolic lengths decreased by a mean of 4-6% when compared at a matched end-systolic pressure of 96 +/- 10 mm Hg, and decreased by 7-9% when compared at a matched pressure of 139 +/- 20 mm Hg. The end-systolic lengths immediately after the volume load were not significantly different from the control value (compared at a matched end-systolic pressure) but were significantly shorter 10 minutes after the volume load. The leftward shift of the ESPLR represented a true increase in contractility and not merely a recovery from a transient myocardial depression. A similar leftward shift in the ESPLR occurred in four animals after release of a partial venae cavae occlusion, producing an acute volume load without acute hemodilution. Acute volume loads in four animals treated with propranolol also produced a leftward shift in the ESPLR, ruling out the possibility that a time-dependent increase in circulating catecholamines was responsible for the alterations in contractility. In five animals, the ESPLR shifted to the right after a transient (1-2 minutes) decrease in venous return.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Seventy-three (58 men and 15 women) survivors of myocardial infarction below 45 years of age and 73 healthy matched controls were investigated regarding in vitro platelet aggregability to ADP and collagen, platelet sensitivity to prostacyclin and plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4 and fibrinogen. The patients, studied 3-6 months after the acute event, had a reduced platelet sensitivity to prostacyclin. They did not differ from the controls regarding the other platelet function tests. Females had higher platelet reactivity than men. Smoking, obesity or beta-blocker treatment did not influence platelet function. The patients had higher fibrinogen levels than the controls. Gender did not influence, while smoking and obesity increased plasma fibrinogen. Patients on beta-blockade had lower fibrinogen levels than patients without this therapy. The high fibrinogen level and the low platelet sensitivity to prostacyclin might indicate an increased thrombotic liability in young myocardial infarction patients.",

The cardiac vagus ganglia presented a high concentration of a single population of high affinity binding sites (Bmax 109 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein; Kd 64 +/- 5 pM). Displacement studies with the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 A and the beta 2-selective adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 indicated that most (80 to 90%) of the binding sites are of the beta 2-type.", 
    "68": "Enhancement of neurotransmitter release following phorbol ester-induced activation of protein kinase C (PKC) may be mediated by changes in ion conductance through the presynaptic membrane. This question was studied with rabbit hippocampal slices preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA). NA release was evoked by pulses of either high K+ or Ca2+ (in the presence of high K+), or by electrical field stimulation. 4 beta-Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) increased and polymyxin B (PMB) reduced the K+-evoked NA release independent of the K+ concentration used for depolarization. The effects of PDB and PMB were not reduced by tetrodotoxin. PDB still enhanced the NA release triggered by short Ca2+ pulses in depolarized, axon terminal membranes (30 mM K+ and no Ca2+). The electrically evoked NA release was markedly enhanced by PDB even in the absence of Cl- in the medium or in the presence of the K+ channel blockers, tetraethylammonium, 4-amino- and 3,4-diaminopyridine. The inhibitory effect of the Ca2+ channel blocker, Cd2+, remained almost unchanged in the presence of PDB. It is concluded that PKC activation facilitates NA release in the hippocampus but not via presynaptic changes in Na+, K+ or Cl- currents. Whether phorbol ester mediates an increased intracellular Ca2+ availability, or whether a triggering 'normal' Ca2+ influx simply initiates, and synergistically supports, the PKC-mediated reactions leading to enhanced exocytosis, cannot be decided from the results of the present experiments.", 
    "69": "The present studies were undertaken to explore the use of intracerebral microdialysis to measure brain adrenergic receptor activity in vivo using the efflux of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the extracellular fluid as an index of receptor function. An initial study with brain slices showed that extracellular levels of cAMP were highly correlated with intracellular levels after noradrenergic receptor activation. Detectable levels of extracellular cAMP were obtained from microdialysis probes implanted in the frontal cortex. Stable levels (3.5 +/- 2.7 pmol/ml) were obtained between 1.5 and 7 h after implantation. Perfusion of probes with NE (10(-5) to 10(-3) M) led to dose-dependent increases in cAMP efflux. The response to NE was blocked by infusion of the beta-antagonist, timolol, indicating that it reflected beta-receptor activation. Similar responses were obtained at 2 and 24 h after implantation indicating that the responses were not affected by acute traumatic effects of implantation. The findings show that the microdialysis technique can be successfully applied to the in vivo study of central adrenoceptor function. This suggests that the in vivo measurement of second messengers by microdialysis will provide a valuable new neurochemical and neuropharmacological technique.", 
    "70": "We evaluated the use of topically administered betaxolol 0.5% in 101 glaucoma patients (47 men and 54 women) who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or timolol-induced bronchoconstriction. Betaxolol 0.5% was administered twice daily and patients were reexamined at three-month intervals for up to two years. In addition to measurement of intraocular pressure, pulmonary function tests were obtained before therapy (baseline), two or three weeks after initiating betaxolol therapy, and at yearly intervals. Before treatment with betaxolol, the mean ratio of forced expiratory volumes in one second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) was 66.3% (n = 101). After two weeks of betaxolol treatment, mean FEV1/FVC ratio was 66.2% (n = 101). After one year of betaxolol therapy, mean FEV1/FVC ratio was 60.1% (n = 24), and after two years it was 54.4% (n = 5). Nine patients developed symptoms that may have been associated with betaxolol treatment and were withdrawn from the study. Five of these patients developed symptomatic pulmonary obstruction between one and 554 days after initiating betaxolol treatment. Topically administered betaxolol was well tolerated by most glaucoma patients with concomitant pulmonary disease.", 
    "71": "Acetone extract prepared from the plasma membranes of human erythrocytes contained substances which induced the contraction of the thoracic aortic strip of rabbit in vitro and caused blood pressure elevation in rat upon intravenous injection. The contractile response was inhibited by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin. By HPLC/electrochemical detection as well as radioenzymatic assay, large amounts of norepinephrine (NE) (14 +/- 4 [SE] ng/ml packed cells) and epinephrine (E) (16 +/- 2 ng/ml packed cells) were found in the extract. Using the same amounts as in the extract, we were able to demonstrate additive effect between NE and E. The possibility that erythrocyte membranes may play a role in the regulation of NE and E in circulation is suggested.", 
    "72": "There are no systematic and complex investigations regarding the hemorheologic action of the betablockers propranolol and talinolol. The results on the other ones are contradictory. On the basis of a critical survey of the literature, in-vitro-experiments and studies in animals (rats) and humans may conclude that there are no remarkable deteriorations of rheological parameters in the therapeutic dose range. This is valid for diseases only where the haemodynamic regulation doesn't prevail.", 
    "73": "We conducted a randomized, double-masked study of intraocular pressure in 80 patients treated with betaxolol, levobunolol, timolol, or placebo after extracapsular cataract extraction. Intraocular pressures were measured preoperatively and early (four to seven hours) and late (20 to 24 hours) postoperatively. There was a significant mean increase in pressure from the preoperative period to the early postoperative period for the placebo group (5.35 mm Hg), betaxolol group (6.73 mm Hg), and the timolol group (3.83 mm Hg). However, the levobunolol group had a mean decrease in pressure (0.43 mm Hg). There was no significant difference between preoperative and late postoperative pressures for any of the groups. One-way analysis of covariance of the changes in pressure from the preoperative to early postoperative period showed a significant increase for the placebo and betaxolol groups compared to the levobunolol group, without significant difference between the levobunolol and timolol groups. Overall, levobunolol proved most effective in preventing an increase in intraocular pressure after extracapsular cataract extraction; timolol was partially effective.", 
    "74": "Fluoride ion, presumably an Al3+-F- complex, has been proposed to activate the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (G-protein) of the visual system, transducin, by associating with GDP at the nucleotide-binding site and thus mimicking the effects of non-hydrolysable GTP analogues [Bigay, Deterre, Pfister & Chabre (1985) FEBS Lett. 191, 181-85]. We have examined this proposed model by using the adenylate cyclase complexes of frog erythrocytes, S49 lymphoma cells and human platelets. Preincubation of plasma membranes from frog erythrocytes and S49 cells with 20 mM-fluoride for 20 min at 30 degrees C strongly stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. In contrast, the preactivated membranes were still able to bind beta-adrenergic agonist with high affinity, as determined by radioligand-binding techniques. Moreover, high-affinity agonist binding in fluoride-treated membranes was fully sensitive to guanine nucleotide, which decreased beta-adrenergic-receptor affinity for agonist. Very similar results were obtained for [3H]prostaglandin E1 binding to S49 membranes pretreated with fluoride. Incubation of human platelet membranes with increasing concentrations of fluoride (1-50 mM) resulted in biphasic regulation of adenylate cyclase activity, with inhibition observed at concentrations greater than 10 mM. Preincubation of platelet membranes with 20 mM-fluoride did not affect agonist high-affinity binding to alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, nor receptor regulation by guanine nucleotide. These results suggest that the model developed from the study of transducin may not be generally applicable to the G-proteins of the adenylate cyclase system.", 
    "75": "The in vivo phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase was re-examined by fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry and a procedure in which phosphoserine residues are first converted to S-ethylcysteine. In animals injected with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, the phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal (N) and C-terminal (C) cyanogen bromide peptides were identified as the serine residues at N7, the region C28-C39, C42, C46 and C100. In animals injected with adrenalin, the phosphorylation of N7 increased from 0.6 to 0.8 mol/mol, the region C28-C39 from 0.7 to 1.2 mol/mol and C100 from 0.3 to 0.6 mol/mol. The phosphorylation states of C42 (0.7 mol/mol) and C46 (0.9 mol/mol) were unchanged. In addition, two further serine residues became phosphorylated at positions N10 (0.5 mol/mol) and C87 (0.5 mol/mol), which were not phosphorylated in the absence of adrenalin. Residues N10 and C42 have not been recognized as in vivo sites of phosphorylation previously. The results suggest that N10 is phosphorylated by a novel protein kinase which may be activated by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphorylation of C42 is likely to be catalysed by glycogen synthase kinase 3. The protein kinases responsible for phosphorylating N7, the region C28-C39, C46, C87 and C100 in vivo and the molecular mechanisms by which adrenalin inactivates glycogen synthase in vivo are discussed. Residue N3, a major site phosphorylated by casein kinase-I in vitro is not phosphorylated in vivo. This and other evidence indicates that casein kinase-I is not a glycogen synthase kinase in vivo.", 
    "76": "Dopexamine hydrochloride (Dopacard) has been developed as a peripherally acting dopamine receptor agonist with afterload reducing properties for use in the acute management of low cardiac output states. Dopexamine hydrochloride is one-third as potent as dopamine in stimulating DA1 receptors but 60 times as potent as a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist. Unlike dopamine, it is a weak beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist and does not stimulate vascular alpha adrenoceptors. Its stimulant properties at vascular DA1 receptors and at vascular beta 2 adrenoceptors endow it with the ability to improve renal blood flow and to increase cardiac output secondary to afterload reduction. In addition, mild positive inotropic activity arises from stimulation of cardiac beta 2 adrenoceptors, potentiation of endogenous norepinephrine due to uptake-1 blockade, and activation of the baroreceptor reflex. Other features of dopexamine hydrochloride that should enhance its clinical use are lack of arrhythmogenicity and rapid responsiveness to alterations in infusion rate.", 
    "77": "The electrophysiological and cAMP responses to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol were measured in the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. Subtype-selective antagonists were used to evaluate the specificity of these responses. The beta 1-selective antagonist ICI 89,406 was 60-fold more potent than was the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 at antagonizing the electrophysiological response. ICI 89,406 was 200 times more potent in its antagonism of the cAMP response. These results suggest that the electrophysiological and cAMP responses in this preparation are primarily mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "78": "Adrenergic systems exert dual control over the release of oxytocin (OT) in rats, with stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors exciting, and stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors inhibiting, release of this neurohormone. Because suckling stimulation also releases epinephrine from the adrenal medulla, the present experiments tested whether catecholamines of adrenal origin may participate in the adrenergic regulation of OT release during lactation. In two independent experiments, adrenal demedullation of rats in midlactation did not alter the basal plasma levels of OT, but markedly enhanced the suckling-induced release of OT, suggesting an inhibitory action of an adrenal catecholamine. The OT release induced by suckling in both sham-operated and adrenal demedullated rats was prevented by stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol. Conversely, blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol prevented the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol, and when given alone, mimicked the effects of demedullation to enhance suckling-induced OT release. Stimulation of peripheral alpha-adrenergic receptors with phenylephrine did not affect either basal or suckling-induced OT release, but blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors with phentolamine also completely prevented the release of OT by suckling. These data support the concept that stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors inhibits OT secretion, and further suggest that this may be due, at least in part, to an action of an adrenal catecholamine, which may act centrally and/or directly on the neurohypophysis. The present results also provide further evidence that activation of central, but not peripheral, alpha-adrenergic mechanisms is necessary for suckling-induced OT release.", 
    "79": "We have measured the effect of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) on high- and low-affinity [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding in cerebral cortex of control rats and rats with lesions of serotonin neurons. Eleven days of treatment with ECS (once daily) resulted in a decrease in the number of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites for which isoproterenol has high-affinity. Following lesions with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, ECS still resulted in a decrease in these receptors. Hence, ECS does not require intact serotonin neurons to decrease the number of high-affinity beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "80": "The results of several clinical investigations have suggested that a special relationship exists between thyroid function and affective disorders and/or the therapeutic response to antidepressants. Animal studies have shown the possible beta-adrenergically mediated antidepressant-like properties of triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) in rodents. The present experiment showed (1) that the reversal by antidepressants (clomipramine or imipramine) of escape deficits produced by previous exposure to uncontrollable shock was significantly hastened in animals given TRIAC and (2) that L-penbutolol treatment prevented the elimination of helpless behavior induced by TRIAC, suggesting a beta-adrenergic mediation of the antidepressant activity of thyroid compounds. The study confirmed that learned helplessness might be a useful model for studying in animals the neurohormonal correlates of affective disorders and the neurobiochemical basis of the enhancement of the antidepressant action produced by thyroid compounds.", 
    "81": "The effects of propranolol and d-propranolol on the accumulation of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) induced by complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) for 90 min, were investigated in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. The myocardial levels of eight NEFA (lauric, myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and arachidonic acids) were determined after fluorescent labelling of the NEFA with 9-anthryldiazomethane. LAD occlusion increased the myocardial levels of NEFA, especially those of arachidonic and palmitoleic acids; arachidonic acid increased by 3.5 times and palmitoleic acid by 2.9 times. Pretreatment with propranolol (1 mg/kg) inhibited almost completely the accumulation of NEFA induced by occlusion of the LAD, whereas pretreatment with d-propranolol (1 mg/kg) did not inhibit the accumulation of NEFA, although it tended to inhibit the accumulation of palmitoleic, stearic and arachidonic acids. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of propranolol on the accumulation of NEFA in the myocardium during ischemia is mainly due to its antagonistic effect at beta-adrenoceptors and probably partly due to its effect as a local anesthetic.", 
    "82": "The existence of beta-adrenoceptors on guinea pig alveolar macrophage membranes was determined by means of radioligand binding studies. Saturable binding with [125I]cyanopindolol demonstrated 38 +/- 6 fmol binding sites per 10(6) alveolar macrophages with a Kd of 0.85 +/- 0.15 nM. With timolol, atenolol and ICI 118.551 for competition of [125I]cyanopindolol binding it became clear that guinea pig alveolar macrophages possessed adrenergic binding sites of the beta 2-subtype. The cyclic AMP levels of alveolar macrophages could be increased by selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists but not by selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonists. The influence of non-selective beta- and selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists on the phagocytic and metabolic responsiveness of alveolar macrophages was also studied. Addition of beta-adrenoceptor agonists had no effect on the uptake of bacteria by alveolar macrophages. Incubation of alveolar macrophages with increasing amounts of non-selective and selective beta 1-agonists resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the detection of hydrogen peroxide released by alveolar macrophages. This effect was due to the scavenging properties of these drugs. The selective beta 2-receptor agonists, salbutamol and terbutaline, had no effect on the oxidative metabolism of alveolar macrophages. We conclude that guinea pig alveolar macrophages possess beta 2-adrenoceptors on their cell surface and that these receptors are not involved in the phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages.", 
    "83": "The concentration and location of adrenergic receptors in cat visual cortex have been determined by radioligand binding techniques using [3H]prazosin (alpha 1-adrenergic receptors), [3H]yohimbine (alpha 2-adrenergic receptors) and [3H]dihydroalprenolol (beta-adrenergic receptors). Saturable high affinity binding sites for all of these ligands were found. The beta-adrenergic receptor population was resolved into beta 1- and beta 2-sites that were present in the ratio 35:65. The laminar distributions of the alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptors were different. The alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors were very similarly localized, being seen in upper layers (I, II and III) and lower layers (layers V and VI). The labelling in upper layers was greater than that in lower layers, more so for alpha 1-adrenergic receptors than beta-adrenergic receptors. alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors were seen in a single band that occupied layer II and III but did extend to the pial surface. These results indicate that the effect of norepinephrine on neuronal activity in cat visual cortex will depend upon the layer in which it is released. Our results provide a basis for further physiological studies of the role of norepinephrine in the processing of visual information.", 
    "84": "We have shown that metoclopramide, a dopamine-2 antagonist, failed to antagonise the ocular hypotensive action of timolol. The practical implication of combining dopamine agonists with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of glaucoma is discussed.", 
    "85": "When propranolol is given to prevent hypoxaemic episodes in children with tetralogy of Fallot who are awaiting operation it is advisable to continue the treatment until shortly before the induction of anaesthesia. Because catecholamines are often required to maintain adequate cardiac output after surgical correction the effect of preoperative treatment with beta blockers on the response to isoprenaline after the operation was investigated in nine children given propranolol before operation and nine who were not. They were studied three and 24 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. The haemodynamic response to increasing doses of infused isoprenaline was monitored. Immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass the response to isoprenaline was significantly blunted in the patients who had been given propranolol before operation. Their dose-response curve lay to the right of that for patients not given propranolol, and this indicates competitive inhibition. Propranolol concentrations in the blood and myocardium correlated significantly with the heart rate response to isoprenaline. Twenty four hours after operation the isoprenaline response was similar in both groups and concentrations of propranolol in the blood were minimal or undetectable. beta Blockers given up to the time of operation significantly altered the postoperative response to catecholamines.", 
    "86": "Propranolol binding to human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) delipidated by two methods is described. Commercial AAG (99% pure) was either precipitated by ethanol-acetone and then washed by ether, or it was precipitated by ethanol. Binding capacity was quantified by the product n x Ka where n denotes the number of binding sites and Ka the association constant (M-1). Propranolol binding to nondelipidated AAG (n x Ka = 0.113 +/- 0.013 microM-1) was clearly increased after precipitation by ethanol-acetone (n x Ka = 0.386 +/- 0.109 microM-1) or precipitation by ethanol (n x Ka = 0.312 +/- 0.096 microM-1). Binding capacity potentiation cannot be due to modification of AAG microheterogeneity forms, as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis pattern of AAG in presence of concanavalin A was not altered after both methods. Recombination of precipitated AAGs with supernatant dry residue resulted in the abrogation of observed potentiation. Moreover, addition of a polar lipid, linoleic acid, (from 30 to 300 microM) strongly inhibited propranolol binding. These results indicated that glycoprotein precipitation by ethanol provided a simple method to further study binding inhibitors associated with isolated AAG.", 
    "87": "To study whether right atrial contraction can forward blood into the pulmonary artery during diastole, blood volume was expanded in anesthetized open-chest pigs until mean right atrial pressure was 13-20 mmHg (range). In the control situation, blood flow in the pulmonary artery was only observed during ventricular systole. Forward diastolic pulmonary artery flow, coinciding with right atrial contraction, was observed when diastolic pulmonary artery pressure was reduced during selectively increased left-side contractility, during bradycardia after propranolol injection (0.5 mg/kg body wt iv), and during the prolonged diastolic interval after spontaneously occurring atrial extrasystoles. The prolongation of the diastolic interval in all three series caused the diastolic pulmonary artery pressure to decline and the filling of the right atrium to increase, thus further stimulating the right atrial Frank-Starling mechanism. The diastolic blood flow in the pulmonary artery constituted 11% of the stroke volume during increased left-side inotropic stimulation, 8% during bradycardia, and 6% in beats preceded by a prolonged diastolic interval. Thus, in the normal heart, blood can be ejected into the pulmonary artery during right atrial contraction.", 
    "88": "Previous studies suggest that the hypotensive response to centrally administered propranolol results from a drug-induced release of norepinephrine which then stimulates central alpha adrenergic receptors and, as a consequence, arterial pressure is lowered. Inasmuch as the C1 area of the rostral ventrolateral medulla is known to contain noradrenergic nerve terminals and participate in arterial pressure regulation, we determined whether this medullary region is a site mediating the hypotensive response to centrally administered propranolol. Bilateral microinjections (0.1 microliter) of dl-propranolol (0.25-2 nmol) into the C1 area of urethane-anesthetized rats resulted in a gradual reduction in mean arterial pressure which was sustained throughout the 120-min experimental period. The injection site was verified pharmacologically at the end of each experiment by bilateral microinjection of 10 nmol of tyramine and observing a further decrease in mean arterial pressure and a reduction in heart rate. Pretreatment of the C1 area bilaterally with reserpine 24 hr earlier significantly reduced the hypotensive responses to microinjections of both propranolol and tyramine whereas the hypotensive response to the direct acting agonist clonidine was unchanged. These results demonstrate that the C1 area of the rostral ventrolateral medulla is a site for a central hypotensive action of propranolol. Moreover, the data provide further evidence that the hypotensive action of centrally administered propranolol results from a drug-induced release of norepinephrine from central noradrenergic neurons."
