However, pH in the ER lumen remains neutral, which suggests a mechanism responsible for proton re-entry. We studied whether cation-proton exchangers could act as routes for such a re-entry. ER Ca(2+) uptake was measured in permeabilized immortalized hypothalamic neurons, primary rat cortical neurons and mouse cardiac fibers. Replacement of K(+) in the uptake solution with Na(+) or tetraethylammonium led to a strong inhibition of Ca(2+) uptake in neurons and cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, inhibitors of the potassium-proton exchanger (quinine or propranolol) but not of the sodium-proton exchanger reduced ER Ca(2+) uptake by 56-82%. Externally added nigericin, a potassium-proton exchanger, attenuated the inhibitory effect of propranolol. Inhibitors of small conductance calcium-sensitive K(+) (SK(Ca)) channels (UCL 1684, dequalinium) blocked the uptake of Ca(2+) by the ER in all preparations by 48-94%, whereas inhibitors of other K(+) channels (IK(Ca), BK(Ca) and K(ATP)) had no effect. Fluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis revealed the presence of both SK(Ca) channels and the potassium-proton exchanger leucine zipper-EF-hand-containing transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1) in ER in situ and in the purified ER fraction. The data obtained demonstrate that SK(Ca) channels and LETM1 reside in the ER membrane and that their activity is essential for ER Ca(2+) uptake.",

This method is based on a new procedure of hydrolysis and extraction by 5% trichloracetic acid, and then cleaned up by mixed strong cation exchange (MCX) cartridges coupled with a novelty cleanup step by methanol. Methanol and 0.1% formic acid were used as mobile phases for gradient elution, while a Supelco Ascentis Express Rp-Amide column was used for LC separation. ESI positive ion scan mode was used with consecutive reaction monitoring (CRM, MS\u00b3). Nine \u03b2\u2082-agonists labeled by the deuterium isotope were used as internal standards for quantification. The linear ranges of 48 analytes were from 5 to 200 \u03bcg/L; the coefficient of correlation was not less than 0.995. Blank pork muscle, blank liver, and blank kidney were selected as representative matrix for spiked standard recovery test. The recoveries of each compound were in the range of 46.6-118.9%, and the relative standard deviations were in the range of 1.9-28.2%. Decision limits (CC\u03b1, \u03b1 = 0.01) of 48 analytes in muscles, liver, and kidney samples ranged from 0.05 to 0.49 \u03bcg/kg, and the detection capability (CC\u03b2, \u03b2 = 0.05) ranged from 0.13 to 1.64 \u03bcg/kg.

    "7": "Increasing evidence in animal models and in humans shows that sympathetic nerve activity controls ovarian androgen biosynthesis and follicular development. Thus, sympathetic nerve activity participates in the follicular development and the hyperandrogenism characteristics of polycystic ovary syndrome, which is the most prevalent ovarian pathology in women during their reproductive years. In this study, we mimic sympathetic nerve activity in the rat via \"in vivo\" stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO), a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist, and test for the development of the polycystic ovary condition. We also determine whether this effect can be reversed by the administration of propranolol (PROP), a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Rats were treated for 10 days with 125 \u03bcg/kg ISO or with ISO plus 5 mg/kg PROP. The ovaries were examined 1 day or 30 days following drug treatment. While ISO was present, the ovaries had an increased capacity to secrete androgens; ISO + PROP reversed this effect on androgen secretory activity. 30 days after treatment, androstenedione secretion reverted to normal levels, but an increase in the intra-ovarian nerve growth factor (NGF) concentration and luteinizing hormone (LH) plasma levels was detected. ISO treatment resulted in follicular development characterized by an increased number of pre-cystic and cystic ovarian follicles; this was reversed in the ISO + PROP group. The lack of change in the plasma levels of progesterone, androstenedione, testosterone, or estradiol and the increased LH plasma levels strongly suggests a local intra-ovarian effect of ISO indicating that \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation is a definitive component in the rat polycystic ovary condition.",

    "12": "Bone remodeling, the mechanism that modulates bone mass adaptation, is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system through the catecholaminergic pathway. However, resorption in the mandible periosteum envelope is associated with cholinergic Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP)-positive nerve fibers sensitive to sympathetic neurotoxics, suggesting that different sympathetic pathways may control distinct bone envelopes. In this study, we assessed the role of distinct sympathetic pathways on rat femur and mandible envelopes. To this goal, adult male Wistar rats were chemically sympathectomized or treated with agonists/antagonists of the catecholaminergic and cholinergic pathways; femora and mandibles were sampled. Histomorphometric analysis showed that sympathectomy decreased the number of preosteoclasts and RANKL-expressing osteoblasts in mandible periosteum but had no effect on femur trabecular bone. In contrast, pharmacological stimulation or repression of the catecholaminergic cell receptors impacted the femur trabecular bone and mandible endosteal retromolar zone. VIP treatment of sympathectomized rats rescued the disturbances of the mandible periosteum and alveolar wall whereas the cholinergic pathway had no effect on the catecholaminergic-dependent envelopes. We also found that VIP receptor-1 was weakly expressed in periosteal osteoblasts in the mandible and was increased by VIP treatment, whereas osteoblasts of the retromolar envelope that was innervated only by tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers, constitutively expressed beta-2 adrenergic receptors. These data highlight the complexity of the sympathetic control of bone metabolism. Both the embryological origin of the bone (endochondral for the femur, membranous for the mandibular periosteum and the socket wall) and environmental factors specific to the innervated envelope may influence the phenotype of the sympathetic innervation. We suggest that an origin-dependent imprint of bone cells through osteoblast-nerve interactions determines the type of autonomous system innervating a particular bone envelope.",

    "21": "Neuromodulatory input, acting on G protein-coupled receptors, is essential for the induction of experience-dependent cortical plasticity. Here we report that G-coupled receptors in layer II/III of visual cortex control the polarity of synaptic plasticity through a pull-push regulation of LTP and LTD. In slices, receptors coupled to Gs promote LTP while suppressing LTD; conversely, receptors coupled to Gq11 promote LTD and suppress LTP. In vivo, the selective stimulation of Gs- or Gq11-coupled receptors brings the cortex into LTP-only or LTD-only states, which allows the potentiation or depression of targeted synapses with visual stimulation. The pull-push regulation of LTP/LTD occurs via direct control of the synaptic plasticity machinery and it is independent of changes in NMDAR activation or neuronal excitability. We propose these simple rules governing the pull-push control of LTP/LTD form a general metaplasticity mechanism that may contribute to neuromodulation of plasticity in other cortical circuits.", 
    "22": "A brief synaptic input to the bag cell neurons of Aplysia evokes a lengthy afterdischarge and the secretion of peptide hormones that trigger ovulation. The input transmitter is unknown, although prior work has shown that afterdischarges are prevented by strychnine. Because molluscan excitatory cholinergic synapses are blocked by strychnine, we tested the hypothesis that acetylcholine acts on an ionotropic receptor to initiate the afterdischarge. In cultured bag cell neurons, acetylcholine induced a short burst of action potentials followed by either return to near baseline or, like a true afterdischarge, transition to continuous firing. The current underlying the acetylcholine-induced depolarization was dose dependent, associated with increased membrane conductance, and sensitive to the nicotinic antagonists hexamethonium, mecamylamine, and \u03b1-conotoxin ImI. Whereas nicotine, choline, carbachol, and glycine did not mimic acetylcholine, tetramethylammonium did produce a similar current. Consistent with an ionotropic receptor, the response was not altered by intracellular dialysis with the G protein blocker guanosine 5'-(\u03b2-thio)diphosphate. Recording from the intact bag cell neuron cluster showed acetylcholine to evoke prominent depolarization, which often led to extended bursting, but only in the presence of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine. Extracellular recording confirmed that exogenous acetylcholine caused genuine afterdischarges, which, as per those generated synaptically, rendered the cluster refractory to further stimulation. Finally, treatment with a combination of mecamylamine and \u03b1-conotoxin ImI blocked synaptically induced afterdischarges in the intact bag cell neuron cluster. Acetylcholine appears to elicit the afterdischarge through an ionotropic receptor. This represents an expedient means for transient stimulation to elicit prolonged firing in the absence of ongoing synaptic input.", 
    "23": "Recent studies have underlined the innovative theories concerning the role of neuroendocrine system on the tumor and metastasis microenvironment. These observations have suggested the possibility that drugs originally intended for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockers (\u03b2-blockers), may provide new therapeutic opportunities for the control of tumor progression. A large number of observational studies showed the protective effect of \u03b2-blockers in breast cancer, but more recently, similar findings were also reported in other cancers such as prostate cancer and melanoma. The results of these studies have shown that the use of \u03b2-blockers, but not other antihypertensive drugs, was associated with a significant increase of the disease free survival and of the overall survival. With regard to melanoma, a recent study by De Giorgi et al. showed a 36% reduction in risk of disease progression for each year of treatment with \u03b2-blockers. These data, originating from prospective studies, cannot be considered conclusive and require validation by means of clinical trials that are underway.",

    "25": "Here we report the results of a blinded study comparing the in vitro canine atrial electrophysiological effects of vernakalant, ranolazine, and dl-sotalol. Action potential durations (APD(50,75,90)), effective refractory period (ERP), post repolarization refractoriness (PRR), maximum rate of rise of the action potential (AP) upstroke (V(max)), diastolic threshold of excitation (DTE), conduction time (CT), and the shortest S(1)-S(1) permitting 1:1 activation (S(1)-S(1)) were measured using standard stimulation and microelectrode recording techniques in isolated normal, non-remodeled canine arterially perfused left atrial preparations. Vernakalant caused variable but slight prolongation of APD(90) (P=not significant), but significant prolongation of APD(50) at 30 \u03bcmol/L and rapid rates. In contrast, ranolazine and dl-sotalol produced consistent concentration- and reverse rate-dependent prolongation of APD(90). Vernakalant and ranolazine caused rate-dependent, whereas dl-sotalol caused reverse rate-dependent, prolongation of ERP. Significant rate-dependent PRR developed with vernakalant and ranolazine, but not with dl-sotalol. Other sodium channel-mediated parameters (ie, V(max), CT, DTE, and S(1)-S(1)) also were depressed significantly by vernakalant and ranolazine, but not by dl-sotalol. Only vernakalant elevated AP plateau voltage, consistent with blockade of ultrarapid delayed rectified potassium current and transient outward potassium current.", 
    "26": "In isolated canine left atria, the effects of vernakalant and ranolazine were characterized by use-dependent inhibition of sodium channel-mediated parameters, and those of dl-sotalol by reverse rate-dependent prolongation of APD(90) and ERP. This suggests that during the rapid activation rates of AF, the I(Na) blocking action of the mixed ion channel blocker vernakalant takes prominence. This mechanism may explain vernakalant's anti-AF efficacy.", 
    "27": "The process of reconsolidation has attracted much attention because of its potential application for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Here, we investigate a possible boundary condition of disrupting reconsolidation with the noradrenergic antagonist propranolol in humans. Reconsolidation can be initiated by retrieval of an acquired fear memory, which is in procedure equivalent to extinction training. If memory retrieval promotes the formation of a novel extinction memory trace, propranolol may interfere with extinction rather than with reconsolidation. Using a differential fear conditioning paradigm, we demonstrate that administration of propranolol (double-blind placebo controlled) prior to repetitive unreinforced CS presentations did not affect extinction at a physiological level (startle reflex and skin conductance). At a cognitive level, propranolol directly impaired extinction learning. These findings indicate that careful selection of timing parameters is essential to ensure that pharmacological agents interfere with the intended memory process to reduce fear.",

In this study, we investigated the activation of the Notch pathway in Ins2 Akita diabetic mouse (Akita mouse) and the effects of telmisartan, an angiotensin II type1 receptor blocker, on the Notch pathway. The intracellular domain of Notch1 (ICN1) is proteolytically cleaved from the cell plasma membrane in the course of Notch activation. The expression of ICN1 and its ligand, Jagged1, were increased in the glomeruli of Akita mice, especially in the podocytes. Administration of telmisartan significantly ameliorated the expression of ICN1 and Jagged1. Telmisartan inhibited the angiotensin II-induced increased expression of transforming growth factor \u03b2 and vascular endothelial growth factor A which could directly activate the Notch signaling pathway in cultured podocytes.

We analyzed the evolutionary history of this same domain in humans and in Pan troglodytes. We identified two variants that segregate in both humans and chimpanzees; one of them (rs3735007) does not occur at a hypermutable site and accounts for a nonsynonymous substitution (Thr851Ile). The probability that the two trans-specific polymorphisms have occurred independently in the two lineages was estimated to be low (P = 0.0054), suggesting that at least one of them has arisen before speciation and has been maintained by selection. Population genetic analyses in humans indicated that the region surrounding the shared variants displays strong evidences of long-standing balancing selection. Selection signatures were also observed in a chimpanzee population sample. Inspection of 1000 Genomes data confirmed these findings but indicated that search for selection signatures using low-coverage whole-genome data may need masking of repetitive sequences. A case-control study of more than 1,000 individuals from mainland Italy indicated that the Thr851Ile SNP is significantly associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.08-1.99, P = 0.011).

Given the network of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) fibers that innervates the bone marrow to regulate normal (non-leukemic) hematopoietic progenitor cells, we tested the possibility that stress-induced SNS signaling might also affect ALL progression. In an orthotopic mouse model, Nalm-6 human pre-B ALL cells were transduced with the luciferase gene for longitudinal bioluminescent imaging and injected i.v. into male SCID mice for bone marrow engraftment. Two weeks of daily restraint stress significantly enhanced ALL tumor burden and dissemination in comparison to controls, and this effect was blocked by the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. Although Nalm-6 ALL cells expressed mRNA for \u03b21- and \u03b23-adrenergic receptors, they showed no evidence of cAMP signaling in response to norepinephrine, and norepinephrine failed to enhance Nalm-6 proliferation in vitro. These results show that chronic stress can accelerate the progression of human pre-B ALL tumor load via a \u03b2-adrenergic signaling pathway that likely involves indirect regulation of ALL biology via alterations in the function of other host cell types such as immune cells or the bone marrow microenvironment.",

    "67": "The present investigation provides mechanistic insights into the hyperglycemic and stressogenic effects of monocrotophos, an organophosphorus insecticide. Pre-treatment of rats with mifepristone (glucocorticoid receptor antagonist) prevented induction of liver tyrosine aminotransferase activity (TAT), but was ineffective in attenuating hyperglycemia induced by monocrotophos. Pre-treatment with propranolol (\u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) and phentolamine (\u03b1-adrenergic receptor antagonist) were effective in abrogating monocrotophos-induced hyperglycemia. Interestingly, while propranolol offered partial protection against hyperglycemia, phentolamine completely abolished the same. However, monocrotophos-induced hyperlactacidemia was completely abolished by propranolol. Both the adrenoreceptor antagonists, however, failed to attenuate the stressogenic potential of monocrotophos. Hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia induced by monocrotophos were abolished by pre-treatment with atropine. Exogenous epinephrine was associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia. The impact of adrenergic antagonists on epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia were remarkably similar to that of monocrotophos-induced hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia. Further, hydrazine sulfate (a gluconeogenesis inhibitor) abolished hyperglycemia in monocrotophos-treated rats. From our data, it can be hypothesized that excessive stimulation of adrenoreceptors, probably elicited by increased plasma epinephrine, mediates hyperglycemic outcomes induced by monocrotophos. Pattern of changes in plasma lactate suggests that \u03b2-adrenergic activation mediates monocrotophos-induced hyperlactacidemia, while \u03b1-adrenergic receptor mediates lactate utilization, leading to hyperglycemia. Induction of liver TAT activity is attributable to glucocorticoid receptor activation as a result of hypercorticosteronemia.",

However, the quantitative and qualitative estimation of these receptors by radioligand binding approaches in human airways has not yet been reported because of tissue limitations. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The regional distribution and relative proportion of mAChR and \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtypes were evaluated in human bronchus and lung parenchyma by a tissue segment binding method with [(3)H]-N-methylscopolamine ([(3)H]-NMS) for mAChRs and [(3)H]-CGP-12,177 for \u03b2-adrenoceptors. Functional responses to carbachol and isoprenaline were also analysed in the bronchus. KEY RESULTS The M(3) subtype predominantly occurred in the bronchus, but the density decreased from the segmental to subsegmental bronchus, and was absent in lung parenchyma. On the other hand, the M(1) subtype occurred in the lung only, and the M(2) subtype was distributed ubiquitously in the bronchus and lungs. \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors were increased along the airways, and their densities in the subsegmental bronchus and lung parenchyma were approximately twofold higher than those of mAChRs in the same region. \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptors were also detected in lung parenchyma but not in the bronchus. The muscarinic contractions and adrenoceptor relaxations in both bronchial regions were mediated through M(3)-mAChRs and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS From the present radioligand binding approach with intact tissue segments, we constructed a distribution map of mAChRs and \u03b2-adrenoceptors in human bronchus and lung parenchyma for the first time, providing important evidence for future pharmacotherapy and new drug development for respiratory disorders.",

Since 2008, propranolol has become the first choice of therapy for complicated IH, compared to conventional approach with systemic corticosteroid therapy as first-line treatment and then interferon or vincristine as second- or third-line therapeutic agents. We report three cases of hemangioma, successfully treated with propranolol. Oral propranolol was given for a period of 6 months with monthly follow up.

We have reported that enzyme kinetic parameters for carvedilol glucuronidation by human liver microsomes (HLM) differed greatly depending on the substrate form, namely, racemic carvedilol and each enantiomer. These phenomena were thought to be caused by mutual inhibition between carvedilol enantiomers during racemate glucuronidation. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of these phenomena in HLM and human intestinal microsomes (HIM) and its relevance to uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1, UGT2B4 and UGT2B7, which mainly metabolize carvedilol directly in phase II enzymes. HLM apparently preferred metabolizing (S)-carvedilol to (R)-carvedilol in the racemate, but true activities of HLM for both glucuronidation were approximately equal. By determination of the inhibitory effects of (S)-carvedilol on (R)-carvedilol glucuronidation and vice versa, it was shown that (R)-carvedilol glucuronidation was more easily inhibited than was (S)-carvedilol glucuronidation. UGT2B7 was responsible for (S)-carvedilol glucuronidation in HLM. Ratios of contribution to (R)-carvedilol glucuronidation were approximately equal among UGT1A1, UGT2B4 and UGT2B7. However, enzyme kinetic parameters were different between the two lots of HLM used in this study, depending on the contribution ratio of UGT2B4, in which (R)-glucuronidation was much more easily inhibited by (S)-carvedilol than was (S)-glucuronidation by (R)-carvedilol. Meanwhile, HIM preferred metabolizing (R)-carvedilol, and this tendency was not different between the kinds of substrate form.", 
    "106": "The ultra-short acting, selective \u03b2(1)-adrenergic antagonists landiolol and esmolol are widely used perioperatively; however, little is known about their acute direct actions on the heart. The current study utilized the Langendorff perfused heart system to measure changes in cardiac function and hemodynamics in response to each drug. Furthermore, electrophysiological analysis was performed on isolated ventricular myocytes. Direct application of esmolol significantly decreased systolic left ventricular pressure and heart rate at concentrations > 10 \u00b5M, while it dose-dependently increased coronary perfusion pressure. Esmolol also shortened the action potential duration (APD) in a concentration-dependent manner, an action maintained even when the delayed rectifier K(+) current or ATP sensitive K(+) current was blocked. Moreover, esmolol inhibited both the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) and the L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) and increased the outward current dose-dependently. In contrast, landiolol had minimal cardiac effects. In the Kyoto Model computer simulation, inhibition of either I(K1) or I(CaL) alone failed to shorten the APD; however, an additional increase in the time-independent outward current caused shortening of the APD, equal to that induced by esmolol. In conclusion, esmolol directly inhibits cardiac performance significantly more so than landiolol, an effect revealed to be at least in part mediated by esmolol-induced APD shortening.",

Simulations of escapes from 600 to 1,000 fsw (with 200-fsw steps) were performed, with varying dwell times (DT) in the escape trunk (from 10 to 60 seconds, in 10-second steps). Baseline cardiac output (CO) was set at 5 liters/minute, and it was varied through changes in heart rate from 50% to 200% in the escape simulations. LBct was assumed to vary inversely with CO.", 
    "109": "The risk of N2 narcosis was expressed as equivalent narcosis depth (END) in fsw, corresponding to N2 pressure in the brain after five minutes of air diving at that equivalent depth. The effects of changing CO on the highest END values (corresponding to the peak N2 pressures) reached while in the escape trunk or during entire escapes were tabulated. Depths at which peak N2 occurred were also analyzed. Prolonging LBct appeared to have two advantageous effects: 1. It reduced peak N2 reached both in the escape trunk and during the entire course of the escape 2. It delayed peak N2 to later stages of escapes (i.e., closer to the surface during ascent). These effects were more evident at greater escape depths and with longer DTs.",

The urine flows during non-surgery were 43, 147, and 176 ml in the control, esmolol, and phenylephrine groups, respectively (medians, P<0.03). When surgery had started the corresponding values were 34, 65 and 61 ml (P<0.04). At 3 hours, averages of 9%, 20%, and 25% of the infused volume had been excreted in the three groups (P<0.01).

Glomerular Hic-5 expression increased in parallel with \u03b1-SMA expression in a rat model of mesangial proliferative GN. Combined therapy with an angiotensin type I receptor blocker and an antioxidant in this model improved the histology and the expression of Hic-5 and \u03b1-SMA.

    "128": "The reconsolidation hypothesis posits that established emotional memories, when reactivated, become labile and susceptible to disruption. Post-retrieval injection of propranolol (PRO), a nonspecific \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, impairs subsequent retention performance of a cocaine- and a morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), implicating the noradrenergic system in the reconsolidation processes of drug-seeking behavior. An important question is whether post-retrieval PRO disrupts memory for the drug-cue associations, or instead interferes with extinction. In the present study, we evaluated the role of the \u03b2-adrenergic system on the reconsolidation and extinction of ethanol-induced CPP. Male DBA/2J mice were trained using a weak or a strong conditioning procedure, achieved by varying the ethanol conditioning dose (1 or 2 g/kg) and the number of ethanol trials (2 or 4). After acquisition of ethanol CPP, animals were given a single post-retrieval injection of PRO (0, 10 or 30 mg/kg) and tested for memory reconsolidation 24 h later. Also, after the first reconsolidation test, mice received 18 additional 15-min choice extinction tests in which PRO was injected immediately after every test. Contrary to the prediction of the reconsolidation hypothesis, a single PRO injection after the retrieval test did not modify subsequent memory retention. In addition, repeated post-retrieval administration of PRO did not interfere with extinction of CPP in mice. Overall, our data suggest that the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor does not modulate the associative processes underlying ethanol CPP.", 
    "129": "The resin of Boswellia species is a major anti-inflammatory agent that has been used for centuries to treat various conditions including injuries and inflammatory conditions. Incensole acetate (IA), a major constituent of this resin, has been shown to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation and concomitant inflammation, as well as the neurological deficit following head trauma. Here, we show that IA protects against ischemic neuronal damage and reperfusion injury in mice, attenuating the inflammatory nature of ischemic damage. IA given post-ischemia, reduced infarct volumes and improved neurological activities in the mouse model of ischemic injury in a dose dependent fashion. The protection from damage was accompanied by inhibition of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and TGF-\u03b2 expression, as well as NF-\u03baB activation following injury. In addition, IA is shown to have a therapeutic window of treatment up to 6h after ischemic injury. Finally, the protective effects of IA were partially mediated by TRPV3 channels as determined by the TRPV3 deficient mice and channel blocker studies. This study suggests that the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities of IA may serve as a novel therapeutic treatment for ischemic and reperfusion injury, and as a tool in the ongoing research of mechanisms for neurological damage.",

The influence of aIL was investigated in details, including various aILs, the concentration of aIL and molar ratio of aIL to CD. The ratio of DM-\u03b2-CD to TM-\u03b2-CD in dual CDs was also discussed. DM-\u03b2-CD and TM-\u03b2-CD favor the enantioseparations of PIN/OX and PRO, respectively. Meanwhile, the presence of [GTMA]Cl was found to play a key role in enantioseparations, and it widened the scope of application of DM-\u03b2-CD and TM-\u03b2-CD. Furthermore, FESI as an effective on-line sample enrichment technique was developed to improve the detection sensitivity. Under the optimum conditions, the detection limits of the three pairs of enantiomers range from 0.10 to 0.65 nM, which are much lower than those in the conventional methods. Eventually, the proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of spiked urine sample with good recoveries.",

The analyses of urine samples obtained from patients treated with \u03b2-blockers were also carried out. The separation of analytes was performed on a Hypersil GOLD\u2122 column (100 mm \u00d7 2.1mm, 1.9 \u03bcm) using a gradient elution profile for 10 min and mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile. In these conditions, some of the tested compounds were not separated, but this was compensated by the use of MS/MS detection. The drugs, polyphenols and their metabolites were detected with a tandem mass spectrometer after being ionised positively or negatively (depending on the molecule) using an electrospray ionisation (ESI) source. The MS system was operated in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode, where one quantitation and one confirmation transition was done for each analyte. The quantitative method was validated for selectivity, linearity, low limits of quantitation, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect and analyte stability. The LLOQ varied from 0.01 to 0.40 ng mL(-1) for \u03b2-blockers and from 0.05 to 40.0 ng mL(-1) for polyphenols. The linear range was 0.08-1000 ng mL(-1) for the drugs and 0.10-2300 ng mL(-1) for the polyphenols. Intra-day and inter-day precision was less than 8%, and the accuracy ranged from -4.40 to 2.23% for all analytes. The average recoveries for all compounds analysed were better than 90%. The developed method can be successfully used to monitor cardiovascular drugs and their metabolites in urine samples of patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and can also be used to study the effect of polyphenols on the metabolism of drugs.",

The patient had no history of alcoholism, drug abuse, blood transfusion, or exposure to hepatitis A, B, or C. Extrahepatic obstruction was ruled out with an abdominal ultrasonogram. Serologic studies and immunologic tests were negative. This case illustrates the sudden and abrupt deterioration of multiorgan dysfunction due to antithyroid drug administration and thyroid storm. The thyroid storm score of Burch and Wartofsky was 90/140. The multiorgan dysfunction was reversed by discontinuation of the methimazole and treat with hemodialysis, steroids, cholestyramine, nonselective beta-blocker, fresh frozen plasma infusion and supportive management in the intensive care unit.

    "143": "We demonstrated the rapid effects of 10nM bisphenol A (BPA) on the spinogenesis of adult rat hippocampal slices. The density of spines was analyzed by imaging Lucifer Yellow-injected CA1 neurons in slices. Not only the total spine density but also the head diameter distribution of spine was quantitatively analyzed. Spinogenesis was significantly enhanced by BPA within 2h. In particular, the density of middle-head spine (with head diameter of 0.4-0.5\u03bcm) was significantly increased. Hydroxytamoxifen, an antagonist of both estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR\u03b3) and estrogen receptors (ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2), blocked the BPA-induced enhancement of the spine density. However, ICI 182,780, an antagonist of ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2, did not suppress the BPA effects. Therefore, ERR\u03b3 is deduced to be a high affinity receptor of BPA, responsible for modulation of spinogenesis. The BPA-induced enhancement of spinogenesis was also suppressed by MAP kinase inhibitor, PD98059, and the blocker of NMDA receptors, MK-801. Washout of BPA for additional 2h after 2h BPA treatment abolished the BPA-induced enhancement of spinogenesis, suggesting that the BPA effect was reversible. ERR\u03b3 was localized at synapses as well as cell bodies of principal neurons. ERR\u03b3 at synapses may contribute to the observed rapid effect. The level of BPA in the hippocampal slices was determined by mass-spectrometric analysis.",

Beta-blockers are currently used in a number of cardiovascular conditions such as systolic heart failure, postmyocardial infarction, and in prevention and treatment of arrhythmias. They are not recommended as the first line antihypertensive therapy, particularly in the elderly, unless there are specific indications. Despite the benefits of beta-blockers, tolerability concerns in patients with co-morbidities have limited their use. Some of these problems were overcome with the discovery of cardioselective beta-blockers. The third generation beta-blockers have additional properties of vasodilatation and advantages in terms of minimizing the adverse effects of beta-blockers. Some of the advantages include improvement of insulin resistance, decrease in cholesterol as well as alleviation of erectile dysfunction.

We further evaluated the efficacy and safety of these combination therapies in older (\ue2f665 years) and younger (<65 years) hypertensive patients. In this sub-analysis of the COPE trial 3293 patients (1533\ue2f665 years old and 1760 <65 years old) were randomly assigned to receive benidipine-based therapy with an ARB, a \u03b2-blocker or a thiazide. In each group, the average BP did not differ among the three treatment groups. The incidence of the primary cardiovascular composite end point in the older group was higher than in the younger group (12.7 vs. 8.3 per 1000 person-years, P=0.023). The primary composite cardiovascular end point, achievement (%) of target BP, and cardiovascular hard composite end points were similar among the three treatment groups. However, the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals in older patients were 2.74 (1.08-6.96; \u03b2-blocker vs. thiazide, P=0.022) for fatal and non-fatal stroke, and 2.47 (1.03-5.91; \u03b2-blocker vs. ARB, P=0.043) for new-onset diabetes. Thus, benidipine combined with an ARB, a \u03b2-blocker, or a thiazide was similarly effective in preventing cardiovascular events and achieving the target BP in both older and younger hypertensive patients.

    "160": "Hypertension is a major cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, but several other common conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), osteoporosis, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD), have been shown to independently increase the risk of CV events and death. The physiological basis for an increased CV risk in those conditions probably lies in the augmentations of oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and arterial stiffness, which all are also hallmarks of hypertension. \u03b2-Blockers have been used for the treatment of hypertension for more than 40 years, but a number of meta-analyses have demonstrated that treatment with these agents may be associated with an increased risk of CV events and mortality. However, the majority of primary prevention \u03b2-blocker trials employed atenolol, an earlier-generation \u03b2(1) -selective blocker whose mechanism of action is based on a reduction of cardiac output. Available evidence suggests that vasodilatory \u03b2-blockers may be free of the deleterious effects of atenolol. The purpose of this review is to summarize pathophysiologic mechanisms thought to be responsible for the increased CV risk associated with COPD, osteoporosis, and PAD, and examine the possible benefits of vasodilatory \u03b2-blockade in those conditions.

Endothelial function, measured by digital reactive hyperemic index (RHI), circulating oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), 8-isoprostane, and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were obtained at baseline, post-period 1, post-washout, and post-period 2. Analyses were adjusted for baseline measurements by analysis of covariance, with robust variance estimation for confidence intervals and P values. C+L treatment compared to H+L treatment significantly improved RHI (0.74, 95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.19, P\u2003=.001). This difference persisted after adjustment for the change in systolic blood pressure. No significant treatment differences were observed for oxLDL, 8-isoprostane, or ADMA. These data provide evidence that independent of blood pressure-lowering, C+L therapy improves endothelial function to a greater extent than H+L therapy. Levels of oxidative stress were not significantly different between treatments, suggesting that other mechanisms may be responsible for the improvement in endothelial function.",

It appears that this very important development may have undermined many previous efforts to develop 3D theoretical models of GPCRs. To address this question directly, we have compared several historical \u03b22AR models versus the inactive state and nanobody-stabilized active state of \u03b22AR crystal structures in terms of their structural similarity and effectiveness of use in virtual screening for \u03b22AR specific agonists and antagonists. Theoretical models, incluing both homology and de novo types, were collected from five different groups who have published extensively in the field of GPCRs modeling. All models were built before X-ray structures became available. In general, \u03b22AR theoretical models differ significantly from the crystal structure in terms of TMH definition and the global packing. Nevertheless, surprisingly, several models afforded hit rates resulting from virtual screening of large chemical library enriched by known \u03b22AR ligands that exceeded those using X-ray structures. The hit rates were particularly higher for agonists. Furthemore, the screening performance of models is associated with local structural quality, such as the RMSDs for binding pocket residues and the ability to capture accurately, most if not all critical protein/ligand interactions. These results suggest that carefully built models of GPCRs could capture critical chemical and structural features of the binding pocket, and thus may be even more useful for practical structure-based drug discovery than X-ray structures.", 
    "171": "The impact of postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) on patient outcomes has prompted intense investigation into the optimal methods for prevention and treatment of this complication. In the prevention of PAF, \u03b2-blockers and amiodarone are particularly effective and are recommended by guidelines. However, their use requires caution due to the possibility of drug-related adverse effects. Aside from these risks, perioperative prophylactic treatment with statins seems to be effective for preventing PAF and is associated with a low incidence of adverse effects. PAF can be treated by rhythm control, heart-rate control, and antithrombotic therapy. For the purpose of heart rate control, \u03b2-blockers, calcium-channel antagonists, and amiodarone are used. In patients with unstable hemodynamics, cardioversion may be performed for rhythm control. Antithrombotic therapy is used in addition to heart-rate maintenance therapy in cases of PAF >48-h duration or in cases with a history of cerebrovascular thromboembolism. Anticoagulation is the first choice for antithrombotic therapy, and anticoagulation management should focus on maintaining international normalized ratio (INRs) in the 2.0-3.0 range in patients <75 years of age, whereas prothrombin-time INR should be controlled to the 1.6-2.6 range in patients \u226575 years of age. In the future, dabigatran could be used for perioperative management of PAF, because it does not require regular monitoring and has a quick onset of action with short serum half-life. Preventing PAF is an important goal and requires specific perioperative management as well as other approaches. PAF is also associated with lifestyle-related diseases, which emphasizes the ongoing need for appropriate lifestyle management in individual patients.",

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that \u03b2-AR stimulation induces ER stress, and induction of ER stress plays a pro-apoptotic role in cardiac myocytes. Using thapsigargin and brefeldin A, we demonstrate that ER stress induces apoptosis in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs). \u03b2-AR-stimulation (isoproterenol; 3h) significantly increased expression of ER stress proteins, such as GRP-78, Gadd-153, and Gadd-34, while activating caspase-12 in ARVMs. In most parts, these effects were mimicked by thapsigargin. \u03b2-AR stimulation for 15 min increased PERK and eIF-2\u03b1 phosphorylation. PERK phosphorylation remained higher, while eIF-2\u03b1 phosphorylation declined thereafter, reaching to ~50% below basal levels at 3 h after \u03b2-AR stimulation. This decline in eIF-2\u03b1 phosphorylation was prevented by \u03b21-AR, not by \u03b22-AR antagonist. Forskolin, adenylyl cyclase activator, simulated the effects of ISO on eIF-2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Salubrinal (SAL), an ER stress inhibitor, maintained eIF-2\u03b1 phosphorylation and inhibited \u03b2-AR-stimulated apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of caspase-12 using z-ATAD inhibited \u03b2-AR-stimulated and thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. In vivo, \u03b2-AR stimulation induced ER stress in the mouse heart as evidenced by increased expression of GRP-78 and Gadd-153, activation of caspase-12, and dephosphorylation of eIF-2\u03b1. SAL maintained phosphorylation of eIF-2\u03b1, inhibited activation of caspase-12, and decreased \u03b2-AR-stimulated apoptosis in the heart. Thus, \u03b2-AR stimulation induces ER stress in cardiac myocytes and in the heart, and induction of ER stress plays a pro-apoptotic role.",

During field stimulation at a constant rate, the developed force increased with incremental concentrations of [Ca\u00b2\u207a](ec). During spontaneous beating, rising [Ca\u00b2\u207a](ec) increased beating rate and developed force up to a [Ca\u00b2\u207a](ec) of 2.5\u2009mM. When [Ca\u00b2\u207a](ec) was increased further, spontaneous beating rate decreased, whereas the developed force continued to increase. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced a dose-dependent increase of the frequency of spontaneous beating; however, it did not significantly change the developed force during spontaneous contractions or during electrical stimulation at a constant rate. Force developed by early hESC-CMs depends on [Ca\u00b2\u207a](ec) and on the L-type Ca\u00b2\u207a channel. The lack of an inotropic reaction despite a pronounced chronotropic response after beta-adrenergic stimulation most likely indicates immaturity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. For cell-replacement strategies, further maturation of cardiac cells has to be achieved either in vitro before or in vivo after transplantation.", 
    "189": "Extracellular ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulates G protein and \u03b2-arrestin signaling by changing the conformational states of the cytoplasmic region of the receptor. Using site-specific (19)F-NMR (fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance) labels in the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR) in complexes with various ligands, we observed that the cytoplasmic ends of helices VI and VII adopt two major conformational states. Changes in the NMR signals reveal that agonist binding primarily shifts the equilibrium toward the G protein-specific active state of helix VI. In contrast, \u03b2-arrestin-biased ligands predominantly impact the conformational states of helix VII. The selective effects of different ligands on the conformational equilibria involving helices VI and VII provide insights into the long-range structural plasticity of \u03b2(2)AR in partial and biased agonist signaling."
