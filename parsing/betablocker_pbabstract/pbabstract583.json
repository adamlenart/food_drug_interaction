    "0": "A prodrug (Fig. 1(IV)) is synthesized consisting of the beta-blocker bupranolol which is covalently linked to 1, 3-dipalmitoyl-2-succinyl-glycerol. The resulting lipid-like prodrug is amphipathic and surface active. It disperses readily in H2O above 30 degrees C forming a smectic lamellar phase. This prodrug bears one positive charge at neutral pH and hence the swelling behaviour of dispersions in H2O is similar to that of charged phospholipids: the dispersions show continuous swelling with increasing water content and consequently in the excess H2O region of the phase diagram the thermodynamically most stable structure is the unilamellar vesicle. This includes oligomeric vesicles which may be defined as unilamellar vesicles containing smaller, also unilamellar vesicles entrapped in their internal aqueous compartment. The prodrug dispersions in H2O are polydisperse with vesicle sizes ranging from 0.1 micron to several micron. Sonication of these dispersions produce small unilamellar vesicles of an average size and size distribution similar to sonicated egg phosphatidylcholine dispersions. Unsonicated dispersions of the prodrug in H2O undergo reversibly sharp order-disorder transitions at 32 degrees C with an enthalpy change of delta H = 10 kcal/mol. In sonicated aqueous dispersions this phase transition is asymmetric and significantly broadened indicating that the cooperativity is markedly reduced. The peak temperature and enthalpy change of this broad transition are reduced compared to the transition observed with unsonicated dispersions. The temperature dependence of the electron spin resonance (ESR) hyperfine splitting and order parameter also reflects the order-disorder transition. From ESR spin labeling it is concluded that in sonicated dispersions the prodrug molecule is more mobile and its anisotropy of motion is reduced compared to unsonicated dispersions. This result indicates that the molecular packing in the highly curved bilayers of small unilamellar prodrug vesicles is significantly perturbed compared to bilayers of unsonicated dispersions.", 
    "1": "Treatment of rats with triiodothyronine (T3 10 micrograms/100 g per day, 20 days) increased the mass of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and heart ventricle and stimulated beta-adrenoreceptor number (assessed from radioligand binding) by 43% in isolated BAT and heart membranes. alpha-Receptor number was slightly increased in BAT membranes (42%) but reduced in heart from T3-treated rats. The ratio of alpha-receptors/beta-receptors was unaffected by T3 treatment in BAT membranes (control and hyperthyroid = 1.54) but reduced in heart (control = 2.8, T3 = 1.04).", 
    "2": "A membrane preparation of the calf heart left ventricle has been used after identification and characterization, as a source of myocardial beta 1-adrenoceptor for radioligand binding studies. The displacement of specifically bound (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol by some beta-adrenoceptor ligands appeared to be pH-dependent, which could be related to the ionization characteristics of the compounds. Among the usually four ionic species of the ligand, present at physiological pH, the cation was shown to govern beta 1-adrenoceptor affinity. Furthermore, quantitative structure affinity relationships for the interaction with beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were established for the phenoxypropanolamines, a class of beta-adrenoceptor ligands. The N-isopropyl-oxypropanolamine side chain itself does not discriminate between beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, whereas aromatic substitution ortho to the side chain induces some beta 2-selectivity. Selectivity for myocardial beta 1-adrenoceptors is mainly obtained by aromatic substitution para to the side chain. This substitution pattern yields a decrease in beta 2-adrenoceptor affinity, far more pronounced than the decrease in beta 1-adrenoceptor affinity.", 
    "3": "The cyclic AMP content of acini, freshly prepared from mammary tissue of lactating rats, was measured during incubation in vitro. Neither adrenergic agonists nor cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors alone caused a change of more than 2-fold in the basal cyclic AMP content of acini. Together, however, these agents provoked increases of around 20-fold in acini cyclic AMP content. Forskolin caused similar effects. The relative potency of adrenergic agonists in increasing cyclic AMP in acini, together with the ability of selective antagonists to oppose such rises, indicated that beta 2-adrenergic receptors were involved in mediating the effects. Receptor-binding experiments using [3H]dihydroalprenolol and selective beta-antagonists confirmed the predominant presence of beta 2-adrenergic receptors on acini membranes and on membranes prepared from purified mammary secretory epithelial cells. These results elucidate some previous findings [Robson, Clegg & Zammit (1984) Biochem. J. 217, 743-749; Williamson, Munday, Jones, Roberts & Ramsey (1983) Adv. Enzyme Regul. 21, 135-145], questioning the role of cyclic AMP in the regulation of lipogenesis in mammary acini.", 
    "4": "The binding properties of a newly developed, highly selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist radioligand, (-)[3H]bisoprolol (EMD 33512) were investigated in rabbit lung membranes containing a mixture of 80% beta 1-and 20% beta 2-adrenoceptors. The binding of (-)[3H]bisoprolol at 25 degrees C was saturable, of high affinity (KD = 4.7 +/- 0.6 nM, N = 4), rapid and readily reversible. The maximal number of (-)[3H]bisoprolol binding sites (244 +/- 31 fmol bound/mg protein, N = 4), however, was only 80% of the number of sites labelled by the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor radioligand (-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol (299 +/- 36 fmol bound/mg protein, N = 4). beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists (non-selective: propranolol, alprenolol; beta 1-selective: metoprolol, practolol, bisoprolol; beta 2-selective: ICI 118,551) inhibited (-)[3H]bisoprolol binding with monophasic displacement curves and pseudo-Hill coefficients of 1.0 indicating that in rabbit lung membranes (-)[3H]bisoprolol labels a homogeneous class of beta-adrenoceptors. Agonists inhibited binding with an order of potency: (-)-isoprenaline greater than (-)-noradrenaline = (-)-adrenaline, which is a typical one for beta 1-adrenoceptors. It is concluded that in rabbit lung membranes (-)[3H]bisoprolol selectively labels beta 1-adrenoceptors. (-)[3H]Bisoprolol therefore seems to be a suitable ligand for direct determination of the properties of beta 1-adrenoceptors in those tissues where both beta-adrenoceptor subtypes coexist.", 
    "5": "The tight binding of noradrenaline (NA) to beta-adrenergic receptors was studied in membranes from the left ventricular myocardium of the rat. Addition of GTP (0.1 mM) to membrane preparations from control rats (NA concentration 8.5 +/- 2.1 nM) caused a 4-35% (N = 8) increase (P less than 0.01) in the number of specific binding sites of [125I](-)pindolol. In contrast, addition of GTP did not cause any changes in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in heart membranes from reserpinized animals (NA concentration less than 0.1 nM). In heart membranes from reserpinized animals, preincubation with NA (followed by washing) revealed a time- and concentration-dependent decrease with a maximum of 35-40% in the [125I](-)pindolol-binding sites. This agonist-mediated decrease in the number of receptors was prevented if GTP was also present in the NA-preincubation medium. It is concluded that NA can undergo tight binding to beta-adrenergic receptors in rat heart membranes. The heart-membrane preparations contain endogenous NA which, via tight agonist binding, is responsible for masking part of the beta-adrenergic receptor population.", 
    "6": "Variations in cerebral blood flow and partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide (pO2, pCO2) were studied in rabbits during short-duration (1 min) immobilization stress. The techniques used enabled us to determine these variables locally in the caudate nucleus in a continuous, simultaneous and quantitative fashion. It could be shown that cerebral blood flow and arterial blood pressure increased in parallel immediately after inducing the stress reaction, and that pO2 increased further, indicating that cerebral oxygen supply is maintained by the hyperaemia. Previous administration of a beta-receptor blocker or of a cholinergic receptor blocker significantly diminished the cerebrovascular reaction to stress, inducing a decrease in pO2 during the reaction. Administration of both blockers nearly abolished the cerebral vasodilation studied. Previous administration of an alpha-receptor blocker enhanced the reactive hyperaemia. No disturbance of the blood-brain barrier could be observed in rabbits subjected to stress. Intravenous injection of adrenaline, as well as angiotensin II inducing similar increases in blood pressure, had no comparable effect on the blood flow. The conclusion is that in this model of anxiety, neurogenic mechanisms are involved in the provision of a sufficient oxygen supply to the brain.", 
    "7": "The binding of adrenergic ligands (3H-prazosin, 3H-clonidine, 3H-dihydroalprenolol) was studied on a preparation of cerebral microvessels in the prefrontal cortex and putamen of control and Parkinsonian subjects. The adrenergic receptor density in microvessels of control patients was less than 0.5% and 3.3% respectively of the total binding. A significant decrease in the number of alpha-1 binding sites was observed on microvessels in the putamen of patients with Parkinson's disease.", 
    "8": "An in vitro model for the study of adrenoreceptor-prostacyclin (PGI2) relationships in the rat aorta is described. PGI2 synthesis was stimulated by adrenergic agonists (rank order of potency: epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine). Isoproterenol, UK 14304, clonidine and salbutamol were without effect. Epinephrine (3 X 10(-7) M)-stimulated PGI2 synthesis was inhibited by adrenoreceptor antagonists (rank order of potency: yohimbine greater than prazosin greater than phentolamine greater than corynanthine much greater than propranolol). The absence of calcium in incubation media abolished epinephrine-stimulated PGI2 synthesis as did the calcium channel blocker, verapamil, in a dose-dependent manner. Calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-5) M)-stimulated PGI2 synthesis was inhibited by verapamil (in a dose-dependent manner), but not by prazosin, phentolamine or yohimbine. It is concluded that epinephrine-mediated rat aortic PGI2 synthesis is alpha-adrenoceptor- and not beta-adrenoceptor-mediated, calcium-dependent, and that the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists evaluated do not have verapamil-like calcium channel blocking activities. These findings may be relevant to contraction-relaxation cycles of vascular tissue.", 
    "9": "3H-Octopamine binds reversibly and with high affinity to sites on adult firefly light organ membranes. The binding is characterized by multiple affinities. Scatchard analysis supported a two site binding model with a tentative Kd value of about 1 nM for the high affinity component. The more abundant lower affinity site had a Kd value of about 60 nM. Guanyl nucleotides (Gpp(NH)p and GTP) greatly reduced the apparent number of octopamine binding sites. Competition studies with known octopaminergic agonists including the formamidine pesticides chlordimeform (CDM) and N-demethyl chlordimeform (DCDM) showed the following rank order of potencies in displacing octopamine: DCDM greater than octopamine = synephrine greater than naphazoline greater than clonidine greater than CDM. It was also observed that phentolamine was much more active than propranolol in antagonizing OA-binding. These relative activities are similar to the abilities of the same compounds to alter adenylate cyclase activity in light organ homogenates. Together with the effect of GTP on binding, these results suggest that the binding sites are functional octopamine receptors of the light organ.", 
    "10": "Thyrotropin causes a time- and concentration-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells as measured by Quin2 fluorescence; the half-maximal response occurs in response to 1 X 10(-7) M thyrotropin. The effect of added thyrotropin is the same whether cells have been previously and chronically exposed to thyrotropin or whether they have been thyrotropin \"starved\" for several days. The thyrotropin effect on cytosolic Ca2+ has no relationship to intracellular cAMP levels with respect to dose and time course. Norepinephrine (1 X 10(-7) M) also causes increases in cytosolic Ca2+ in FRTL-5 thyroid cells. With the use of a variety of adrenergic inhibitors, norepinephrine was found to exert its effect via an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor. The exposure of FRTL-5 cells to physiological thyrotropin concentrations enhances the effect on cytosolic Ca2+ level induced by norepinephrine in vitro; the shape of the dose-response curve indicates a cooperative effect of the thyrotropin and norepinephrine. The increase in cytosolic Ca2+ seems to be derived from an intracellular pool rather than from the extracellular space. It is not prevented by nifedipine, a blocker of Ca2+ channels; it is present in cells exposed to ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid; and it is not associated with increased Ca2+ uptake into the cell. the thyrotropin- and norepinephrine-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ parallels the efflux of iodide and the organification of thyroglobulin in a dose-dependent manner.", 
    "11": "The in vitro biological actions of synthetic chum salmon melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) on melanophores of the blue damselfish (a teleost), Chrysiptera cyanea, were studied. This cyclic heptadecapeptide stimulated melanosome (melanin granule) aggregation (centripetal migration) within melanophores at a threshold concentration of about 10(-10) M. The action of this putative hormone was not blocked by alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. It was concluded that the effects of MCH were direct and were not mediated indirectly through the actions of adrenergic neurotransmitters released from nerve terminals. Further evidence for this view comes from the observation that, unlike the case of neurotransmitter release, melanosome aggregation in response to MCH proceeded in the absence of calcium. The possible role of MCH in the control of color change of teleost fishes is discussed.", 
    "12": "The haemodynamic effects of flecainide were compared in three different subsets of patients with documented coronary disease. Ten patients (A) had no heart failure, 5 patients were on beta blockers (B) and 5 patients had overt heart failure (C). Flecainide was associated with negative inotropic effects that were relatively more pronounced in patients with left ventricular dysfunction: pulmonary wedge pressure increased by 27% in A, by 31% in B and by 42% in C; left ventricular stroke volume and stroke work decreased respectively by 10 and 12% in A, 21 and 19% in B, 26 and 28% in C. Ejection fraction decreased by 9% in A, 13% in B and 20% in C, in relation with an increase in end systolic volume (+9% in A, +10% in B and +5% in C). Absolute changes, however, were not significantly different from one group to another except for the increase of systemic vascular resistance which was more pronounced in C as compared with the other groups. The myocardial depression was also confirmed by the fall in dP/dt that was maximal at the end of injection; dP/dt remained depressed 15 min later despite some improvement. Flecainide thus exerts negative inotropic effects that are maximal at the end of infusion and may be of importance in patients with established left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "13": "The concentration of timolol in aqueous humour after one single drop of timolol ophthalmic solution was studied in 19 patients. Relatively high concentrations were found (mean: 626 ng/ml), but the individual differences were great (range: 0 ng/ml - 2080 ng/ml). Possible explanations are discussed. No detectable levels of timolol were found in plasma (detection level greater than or equal to 1 ng/ml).", 
    "14": "Glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) activity and triglyceride lipase (TGL) activity were measured in homogenates from hearts perfused with adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Perfusion with adrenalin or the beta-agonist isoprenaline produced an increase in TGL activity and a fall in GPAT activity. These changes could be imitated by incubation of heart homogenates with cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The alpha 2-agonist clondine produced the opposite effect, thus it increased GPAT activity and decreased TGL activity. Methoxamine, an alpha 1-agonist, had no effect on TGL activity but reduced GPAT activity. Continuous perfusion of the beta-antagonist atenolol reduced TGL activity to half that found in controls but also reduced GPAT activity. No change was seen on continuous perfusion of alpha 1- or alpha 2-antagonists. Changes in GPAT activity were localized mainly in the microsomal enzyme. These changes are consistent with both enzymes being regulated via a cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase system and via alpha-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "15": "The pharmacokinetic properties of propranolol and atenolol were evaluated both in 9 patients with cirrhosis and in 12 healthy subjects. The hemodynamic effects of the drugs were evaluated separately in the cirrhotic patients. Propranolol and atenolol significantly decreased wedged hepatic venous pressure and cardiac output in cirrhotic patients. Propranolol Cmax, tmax and AUC were significantly increased and plasma half-life was significantly prolonged in cirrhotic patients. In contrast, the corresponding pharmacokinetic values of atenolol were not significantly different in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects.", 
    "16": "Amrinone, a positive inotropic-vasodilator agent, was administered to anaesthetised dogs in an attempt to reverse heart failure induced by drugs possessing negative inotropic properties. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker; verapamil, a calcium slow-channel blocker procainamide, a type 1 antiarrhythmic agent; or sodium pentobarbital, a barbituate; administered as a bolus injection and/or infusion, produced a sustained depression in canine cardiac function. Cardiac depression was characterised by a greater than 40% reduction in cardiac contractile force (CF) and maximum left ventricular pressure development (LV dp/dtmax), a 30 to 50% reduction in cardiac output (CO) and concomitant increases in mean central venous or mean right atrial blood pressures (CVP, RAP, respectively). Amrinone, when administered intravenously as a bolus injection (1 or 3 mg X kg-1) plus an infusion (0.03 or 0.1 mg X kg-1 X min-1) reversed the depression in cardiac function by increasing CF, CO and LV dp/dtmax and decreasing preload CVP or RAP in all four drug-induced failure models. Due to the vasodilator properties of amrinone, afterload, total peripheral resistance (TPR), was reduced in verapamil and procainamide failures as well as in propranolol failure, the only model where TPR increases. In another model of heart failure, in which ouabain-induced arrhythmias preceded procainamide toxicity, amrinone was also an effective cardiotonic agent. Ouabain's inotropic effect was studied in propranolol-induced heart failure. Although an increase in LV dp/dtmax and a decrease in CVP were noted, ouabain (40 micrograms X kg-1 iv) increased TPR and had little effect on the depression in CF and CO. Drug-induced models of heart failure were useful pharmacological tools for evaluating the cardiotonic agent's ability to overcome severe cardiac depression. In propranolol-, verapamil-, procainamide-, and pentobarbital-induced cardiac toxicity, amrinone could be of therapeutic value.", 
    "17": "Resting blood flow, arterio-venous glucose and oxygen (A-V)O2 differences, glucose uptake and oxygen consumption by a segment of the upper jejunum were measured in anaesthetized dogs. Systemic arterial pressure was also measured. The effect of nicotine infusion (25 micrograms kg-1 i.v., over 10 min) on these measurements was recorded in untreated dogs, in dogs treated with propranolol (0.5 mg kg-1) to produce beta-adrenoceptor blockade and in dogs after alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin (0.2 mg kg-1). Nicotine cause a significant pressor response during infusion and a hypotensive response during the post infusion period. Propranolol did not significantly affect these results. Jejunal blood flow increased in the first half of nicotine infusion in both the untreated and beta-blocked animals. Vascular resistance was reduced during nicotine infusion and the decrease persisted post infusion in the beta-blocked group. In the untreated group (A-V)O2 was significantly reduced during the first 5 min of nicotine infusion, thereafter it returned to control levels, then rose significantly above control level, post infusion. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade had little effect on these responses to nicotine. When oxygen consumption was calculated it was found that nicotine had little effect during or after infusion. Nicotine caused significant hyperglycaemia during and for about 1 h after infusion. Tissue release of glucose was occasionally observed following the infusion. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade reduced the hyperglycaemia caused by nicotine. beta-Blockade alone increased uptake and nicotine caused a further three to four fold increase. Prazosin abolished the effects that were observed in the untreated and the alpha-blocked animals. 6 The present findings, related to our previous observations on the effects of catecholamines on glucose uptake by the bowel, are consistent with the hypothesis that nicotine has its action on bowel glucose uptake or release through its well-established action in releasing catecholamines and in activating beta-adrenoceptors. The responses are not related to oxygen utilization.", 
    "18": "In a double-blind, balanced and randomised study we used treadmill exercise to assess the effects of long-acting propranolol (LA propranolol) 160 or 320 mg or placebo, given once daily for 4 weeks, on heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) in 15 Chinese subjects with mild primary hypertension (PHT). We used 24 h ECG monitoring to assess drug effects on HR. Another 18 patients were similarly assessed without exercise. Steady-state plasma propranolol concentrations after LA propranolol 160 and 320 mg were comparable to those after ordinary propranolol 80 and 160 mg daily measured in 11 and 12 separate patients. LA propranolol 160 and 320 mg reduced HR and BP before and during vigorous exercise. LA propranolol 160 and 320 mg reduced HR for 17.6 and 21.4 h of the day, and 320 mg significantly reduced the mean 24 h HR, and the mean maximum HR. The drug effects on BP and HR, and the average plasma propranolol levels after LA propranolol were similar to those reported in European subjects.",

    "20": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus is a long-lasting enhancement of synaptic efficacy produced by a brief, high frequency repetitive stimulation of afferents. LTP has generated a great deal of interest as a candidate mechanism in learning and memory. A recent in vivo study has shown that depletion of norepinephrine (NE) or serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reduced LTP in the dentate gyrus produced by stimulation of the perforant path. However, it was impossible to tell whether this resulted from depletion in the hippocampus, itself, or was secondary to depletion of other brain areas, and no comparison between hippocampal cell fields was done. Therefore, we have examined the effects of depletion of NE or 5-HT on LTP in the dentate and field CA1 of the isolated in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. We report here that NE depletion markedly reduces the occurrence and amplitude of LTP in the dentate, but not in field CA1. In contrast, depletion of 5-HT does not prevent occurrence of LTP in either area. Furthermore, pharmacologic data indicate that beta-receptor stimulation of adenylate cyclase is probably the mechanism of NE's action in the production of LTP in the dentate. These results suggest that endogenous hippocampal NE is more important to LTP in the dentate than is endogenous 5-HT.", 
    "21": "Drug-serum protein binding was evaluated in genetically obese Zucker rats, their lean littermates, and lean Sprague-Dawley rats. The free fraction (fp) of phenytoin was significantly higher in the obese rat (fp = 0.177) compared to its lean littermate (fp = 0.136), apparently due to displacement by free fatty acids. Conversely, diazepam and propranolol fp values were decreased in the obese Zucker rat (fp = 0.107 and fp = 0.122, respectively) compared to the lean Zucker rat (fp = 0.140 and fp = 0.174, respectively). Evidence strongly suggests that the increased binding of propranolol was not due to elevations in the serum concentrations of alpha1-acid glycoprotein (as is the case in the human obese population). Rather, the decreased fp for both diazepam and propranolol was a result of increased lipoprotein partitioning. Strain differences between the lean Zucker rat and lean Sprague-Dawley rat were also evident, with serum binding of the Sprague-Dawley rat more closely resembling the obese Zucker rat.", 
    "22": "The specific muscarinic ligand [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) was used to label acetylcholine receptors in the submandibular gland of the rat. Specific binding of [3H]QNB increased linearly with tissue concentration in the range of 0.02-0.3 mg of protein/ml. Kinetic analysis of [3H]QNB binding revealed the presence of a single population of high affinity binding sites, with a dissociation constant of 87.2 pM and a Hill coefficient of 0.95. The binding was saturable and the receptor density was 214 fmol/mg of protein. The rate constants at 37 degrees C for association and dissociation of the [3H]QNB-receptor complex were 5.98 X 10(-8) M-1 X min-1 and 6.6 X 10(-3) X min-1, respectively. The ratio k-1/k+1 gave a Kd value of 11.1 pM, similar to the Kd value (13.1 pM) determined by kinetic parameters when extrapolated at infinitely low receptor concentration. Muscarinic antagonists displaced [3H]QNB from muscarinic receptors with a Hill coefficient near to 1.0. Displacement curves for muscarinic agonists and for the atypical antagonist pirenzepine had Hill values significantly less than one. In the presence of 0.1 mM GPP(NH)P, the potency of agonists but not antagonists in displacing [3H]QNB binding decreased 2 to 3-fold. The [3H]QNB binding site was sensitive to the inhibitory effect of various sulfhydryl reagents. Repeated treatments of rats with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor led to a decreased density of muscarinic receptors in the submandibular gland. This alteration was specific for the muscarinic recognition site and was paralleled by a reduced sensitivity to carbachol.", 
    "23": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade (beta B) on muscle release and uptake of H+ and K+ in humans during maximal exercise has been investigated. Eight volunteers cycled intermittently at power outputs corresponding to 100% of maximal O2 uptake. Prior to exercise either propranolol (beta B) or saline (control) was infused into the femoral vein. Arterial and femoral venous blood samples were drawn at rest, during exercise, and during 30-min recovery. Peak arterial blood values for K+, lactic acid (LA), and base deficit (BD) (mean +/- SE) were respectively 5.5 +/- 0.1, 9.5 +/- 0.6, and 11.7 +/- 0.9 mmol/l during beta B and 5.1 +/- 0.1, 8.3 +/- 0.6, and 10.3 +/- 1.0 for control (P less than 0.05). The release of K+ from the working leg did not differ between treatments during exercise, but K+ uptake during late recovery (5-30 min) was slightly lower during beta B. Thus the higher arterial K+ levels during exercise (beta B) cannot be attributed to greater release by active muscle but are likely due to decreased K+ uptake by noncontracting muscle. Arterial-femoral venous differences for LA and BD did not differ significantly between treatments. Additionally LA exchange across the leg was similar to H+ exchange (arterial-femoral venous differences for BD) under all conditions. During early recovery (1-5 min), regardless of experimental treatment, BD levels iin arterial blood were higher than LA (P less than 0.05). These elevated BD levels may be due to unequal removal rates between LA and H+ equivalents by nonexercised tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "In order to elucidate the influence of autonomic nervous system on atrial electrophysiologic properties, we studied 10 patients with sinus node dysfunction and 10 age-matched normal subjects. In each of them effective and functional refractory periods of the right atrium (near its junction with the superior caval vein) were measured, during atrial pacing (100/min) and using variable current strengths (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 15 mA), before and after pharmacologic autonomic blockade (using intravenous propranolol 0.2 mg/kg and atropine 0.04 mg/kg). Mean values of effective and functional refractory periods at each current strength were significantly higher in patients with sinus node disease than in normal subjects both before and after autonomic blockade. Blockade did not significantly modify mean values of effective and functional refractory periods at any current strength, either in patients with sinus node disease or in normal subjects. Furthermore, autonomic blockade did not change the effects of the increase of current strength on atrial refractoriness in either group. We conclude that our data indicate a prolonged refractoriness to be present in patients with sinus node disease even in the absence of influences from the autonomic nervous system. Thus, we can suggest a \"primary\" involvement of atrial fibers in this pathophysiological condition. Propranolol together with atropine did not induce changes of atrial refractoriness. Indeed, they probably exerted an opposite effect. The effects of the increase of current strength on atrial excitability do not seem to be mediated by autonomic humoral agents.",

    "26": "We studied 67 patients (100 eyes) with childhood glaucoma who were treated with timolol maleate. Thirty of these patients (40 eyes) did not require additional surgery or medications after being treated with timolol (follow-up, from six to 60 months). Thirty-one eyes (78%) in this group had a pressure drop; 18 eyes (45%) had a pressure drop of greater than 10 mm Hg. We conclude that timolol is effective in the treatment of pediatric glaucoma, although there is a need to be aware of its potential complications.", 
    "27": "The synthetic amino terminal fragment of parathyroid hormone, PTH-(1-34), is a potent coronary artery vasodilator in the dog. In the present study, using instrumented open-chest dogs, we have performed the initial characterization of this effect and showed other dose-related cardiovascular effects of the hormone. A near-maximal flow response was obtained after intracoronary injection of 0.024 nmol X kg-1 PTH-(1-34) with minor, if any, concomitant changes in mean blood pressure, contractile force, or heart rate. At higher doses, mean blood pressure decreased while contractile force and heart rate increased in dose-dependent fashion. Infusion of PTH-(1-34) for 20 min showed that the vasodilatory effect could be sustained without a concomitant decrease in mean arterial pressure. Pharmacological characterization showed for the first time that the coronary response to PTH-(1-34) was unaltered in the presence of beta- or alpha-adrenergic, muscarinic, or histaminergic blockades. We conclude that PTH-(1-34), an endogenous circulating calcemic peptide, produces a large increase in coronary blood flow at doses sufficiently low to preclude complicating effects on blood pressure, contractile force, and heart rate. Furthermore, the results suggest that the vasodilatory effects may be specific.", 
    "28": "The antihypertensive mechanisms of single and combined therapy with a beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol) and a vasodilator (hydralazine) were investigated in 9 patients with moderately severe hypertension, who were receiving maintenance diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) treatment. Hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses were determined at rest and during lower body negative pressure, and dynamic and static exercise stress after the chronic administration of propranolol and hydralazine, given alone or in combination. All 3 drug regimens, each administered for at least 10 weeks, reduced blood pressure (p less than 0.05) compared with diuretic-only therapy in patients at rest, in both the supine and standing position, and during lower body negative pressure and dynamic exercise. There was a significant additive antihypertensive effect when propranolol and hydralazine were combined. Only combination therapy effectively lowered pressure during static exercise. The regimens produced divergent effects on the supine cardiac output: a decrease with propranolol (p less than 0.05), no change with combination therapy and an increase with hydralazine (p less than 0.05). Both hydralazine and combination therapy significantly reduced supine total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.05), whereas propranolol produced no change. All 3 drug treatments significantly reduced total peripheral resistance during upright rest and dynamic exercise (p less than 0.05), without changing cardiac output or maximal exercise capacity. During exercise, cardiac output was maintained in patients treated with propranolol and in those treated with combined therapy by increases in stroke volume (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The objectives of this study were to examine the independent and combined effects of beta blockade (practolol) and calcium channel blockade (verapamil) on cardiac responses to hypoxia in the neonate. Lambs were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (20 mg/kg) and were prepared for measurements of left ventricular (LV) performance under controlled hemodynamic conditions. Force generation was assessed from curves relating LV systolic pressure (SP) to end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) over a broad range of afterloading. Velocity was determined from simultaneous measurements of LV dP/dtmax. Values obtained at LVEDP 10 cm H2O were used to compare interventions. Practolol (P) caused no significant reduction in SP10, but dP/dt10 fell from 51 to 37 (X 10(2] mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.05). Verapamil (V), 2 micrograms/min/kg, reduced measures of contractility (p less than 0.01). Doubling the dose of V further reduced SP10 to 79% of control. Hypoxemia (PaO2, 32 torr) increased SP10 from 172 to 192 mm Hg, and dP/dt10 from 51 to 85 (X 10(2] mm Hg/s (p less than 0.001). After P, the same degree of hypoxia elicited no changes in LV function. During infusion of V (4 micrograms/min/kg), hypoxia reduced SP10 from 138 to 122 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and dP/dt10 from 29 to 24 (X 10(2] mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that in the absence of adrenergic support, hypoxia significantly depresses both force and velocity parameters of contractility in hearts with calcium channel blockade.", 
    "30": "The disposition of [14C]practolol and its tissue association in the male Syrian hamster were investigated after p.o. administration. After an acute dose of 400 mg/kg, there was a marked persistence in the eye of total radioactivity (primarily practolol; approximate T 1/2 = 7 days) and nonextractable radioactivity which showed minimal decay over 7 days. Nonextractable radioactivity was also found in other tissues (liver, skin, small intestine and skeletal muscle examined). The level of total and nonextractable radioactivity was linearly related to dose (800 mg/kg highest dose examined). There was a marked accumulation of total and nonextractable radioactivity in the eye (7- and 14-fold, respectively) and skin (6- and 7-fold) after daily administration of 400 mg/kg for 22 days. The association of practolol metabolites with tissue macromolecules might explain the immunological changes in patients with the practolol-induced oculomucocutaneous syndrome. The adverse effects of practolol in humans have not yet been reproduced in any laboratory species and so the results must be interpreted with caution in relation to the toxicity of compound.", 
    "31": "Effect of liver injury induced by chronic treatment with carbon tetrachloride for 1 to 4 months on hepatic clearance of propranolol was investigated in male Wistar rats. Plasma propranolol level after i.v. and p.o. dosing (1.0 mg/kg) was always higher in the rats which were treated for 2 and 4 months than in control (sham-injected) rats. The chronic treatment reduced hepatic clearance of propranolol significantly, yielding only approximately 30 to 50% of the control clearance value. Distribution volume of this drug was also significantly reduced by the chronic treatment but seemed to be less sensitive to the treatment than the hepatic clearance. Accordingly, the elimination rate constant was decreased slightly in the rats treated longer than 2 months. The chronic treatment for 2 and 4 months also reduced intrinsic hepatic clearance substantially. The hepatic clearance estimated for both these control and chronically treated rats was significantly dependent on the liver blood flow. Furthermore, propranolol was eliminated much more slowly in the injured liver of the rat which was treated for 2 or 4 months than in the control liver when perfused in in vitro technique. It is, therefore, suggested that the metabolic dysfunction induced by chronic treatment with carbon tetrachloride may be directly related to substantial changes in anatomical arrangement of the hepatic circulation (portasystemic shunting), which may be due to a fibrosis of the tissue.", 
    "32": "The effect of acute renal failure (ARF) on the hepatic uptake and metabolism of propranolol was investigated in relation to the hepatic clearance of the drug. ARF was induced by the subcutaneous injection of uranyl nitrate to rats. The uptake rate of propranolol in the isolated perfused liver was determined by the multiple-indicator dilution method and was found to decrease from 43.6 +/- 2.0 min-1 (mean +/- S.E.) in control to 29.4 +/- 1.7 min-1 in ARF (P less than 0.001). The recovery fraction of propranolol in effluent venous blood increased about twofold in ARF compared to control (P less than 0.05). The metabolic activity for propranolol was examined using the hepatic microsomal fraction prepared from control and ARF rats. There was no significant difference in the kinetics of oxidative metabolism of propranolol between two groups. These results suggest that the previously reported decrease in the hepatic clearance of propranolol in ARF is due to decreased hepatic uptake of the drug from the blood into the liver cells.", 
    "33": "We evaluated the ability of propranolol and diltiazem alone and in combination to enhance the recovery of left ventricular (LV) segmental function during 1 month of reperfusion after two temporary occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in conscious dogs instrumented with ultrasonic crystals for the measurement of regional net systolic wall thickening (NET). LV segments were classified according to their contractile function after 1 hr of LAD occlusion: class 1, greater than 67% of preocclusion (control) NET; class 2, 0% to 66.9%; class 3, less than 0% (paradoxical systolic wall thinning). Propranolol (1 mg/kg iv) or diltiazem (20 micrograms/kg/min) was given 65 min after LAD occlusion in dogs that had 2 (group I) or 4 hr (group II) of LAD occlusion. Diltiazem plus propranolol (same doses) were given to another group of dogs that underwent 4 hr (but not 2) of LAD occlusion. Untreated control dogs received 25 ml of saline and underwent 2 or 4 hr of LAD occlusion. The NET of class 2 and 3 segments in group I control dogs increased significantly during 1 month of reperfusion, from 32 +/- 5% and -43 +/- 6% to 66 +/- 9% and 26 +/- 9%, respectively (p less than .05). Neither diltiazem nor propranolol enhanced the long-term recovery of these segments in group I dogs. However, diltiazem prevented further deterioration of contractile dysfunction observed in control dogs immediately after reperfusion in both segment classes. The NET of class 2 segments in group II control dogs after 4 weeks of reperfusion remained at levels observed during LAD occlusion: 30 +/- 4% to 37 +/- 12%. Class 3 NET increased from -33 +/- 5% to 12 +/- 12% with 1 month of reperfusion, but these segments were essentially akinetic. Propranolol or diltiazem alone did not produce significant overall increases in NET, but diltiazem again prevented further declines in NET of class 2 and 3 segments during early reperfusion. However, the combination of diltiazem and propranolol significantly enhanced overall recovery of class 2 NET in group II dogs (44 +/- 3% to 88 +/- 7%) and prevented the worsening of NET associated with early reperfusion. Compared with untreated dogs, propranolol plus diltiazem also significantly decreased the extent of histologic necrosis in class 2 and 3 segments as well as the macrohistochemically determined infarct size in group II dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "34": "140 patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia are evaluated. 22 patients were treated by symphatholytic and parasympatholytic drugs and the remaining 118 were operated on by peripheral neurectomy and nerve avulsion. In case of involvement of the inferior alveolar nerve, Thoma's, Poppen's and Ginwalla's method were tried. All cases were critically evaluated and followed for a period of 6 months to 5 years. The objective was to assess the different techniques and to find out the most ideal method of management. Our study showed that an injection of atropine was quite promising in the third division involvement while peripheral neurectomy in second division involvement (Ginwalla's technique of nerve avulsion) was found to be more satisfactory than Thoma's or Poppen's method.", 
    "35": "The success of lithium in the treatment of manic-depressive illness has highlighted the problems posed by the minority of bipolar patients who are lithium nonresponders or who suffer severe adverse effects. A number of possible alternative treatments have been proposed, and the evidence in support of their clinical efficacy is evaluated. At this time, only the anticonvulsant carbamazepine can be regarded as a clinically applicable potential alternative to lithium. Further controlled studies are needed before the antimanic and prophylactic efficacy of carbamazepine can be regarded as conclusively established. Other treatment approaches are of considerable theoretical interest and of potential value clinically but need to be more thoroughly evaluated.", 
    "36": "Twelve outpatients with essential hypertension who showed a normal cardiac index (CI) (between 2.5 and 3.6 1/min/m2) or low CI (2.5 and less 1/min/m2) were studied. Head-up tilting (70 degrees) was performed for 15 min before and 2 weeks after treatment with propranolol (90 mg/day). Before treatment, the normal CI group showed a fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) associated with a decrease in CI and an increase in the total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) during tilting. Conversely, the low CI group showed a rise in SBP associated with an increase in CI and a decrease in TPRI. There was a negative correlation (r = -0.69, P less than 0.05) between the basal CI and the change caused by the tilting. During treatment with propranolol, on the other hand, both groups showed decreases in CI. There was a greater increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) in the normal than in the low CI group before treatment with propranolol. The rise in PRA was significantly (P less than 0.05) suppressed by propranolol in the normal CI group only. It was demonstrated that the low CI group showed a different hemodynamic response to the tilting than the normal CI group. The lower rise in PRA may have partially contributed to the lack of increase in TPRI in the low CI group, compared with the normal CI group. Such hemodynamic differences may be abolished by propranolol which has a cardioinhibitory and/or renin-suppressive effect.", 
    "37": "Experiments were undertaken in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized cats to determine how reflex activation of the renal nerves altered the responsiveness of the kidney to release renin during reductions in renal perfusion pressure. Reflex activation of the renal nerves was achieved by reducing carotid sinus perfusion pressure by 30 mmHg, which increased systemic blood pressure. During this period renal perfusion pressure was regulated at control levels and neither renal blood flow nor glomerular filtration rate changed, but there was a significant decrease in sodium excretion and increase in renin secretion. Renal denervation abolished both these latter responses. Renal perfusion pressure reduction, by 25-30 mmHg, had no effect on renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate but significantly decreased sodium excretion and increased renin secretion. Simultaneous reduction of carotid sinus and renal perfusion pressures had no effect on renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate, decreased sodium excretion, and the magnitude of the increase in renin secretion was significantly greater than that obtained with reduction in renal perfusion pressure alone. Renal denervation abolished the increase in renin secretion during these manoeuvres. During atenolol administration, renal haemodynamics and sodium excretion responses to renal pressure reduction were similar to those obtained in the absence of the drug. Renin secretion was increased, but significantly less than in the absence of atenolol. Simultaneous carotid sinus and renal pressure reductions during atenolol administration had no effect on renal haemodynamics, reduced sodium excretion and increased renin secretion, the magnitude of which was significantly greater than that recorded with only renal pressure reduction in the presence of atenolol. Direct electrical stimulation of the renal nerves, at frequencies which caused a 5-10% reduction in renal blood flow, did not change glomerular filtration rate, decreased sodium excretion by 30% and increased the rate of renin secretion twofold. In the presence of atenolol, such renal nerve stimulation reduced renal blood flow to the same degree, did not change filtration rate, decreased sodium excretion by 37% but did not change renin secretion. These results show that the magnitude of the release of renin in response to renal pressure reduction is dependent on activity within the renal nerves, being blunted after denervation, and enhanced during reflex activation of the renal nerves.", 
    "38": "It has long been thought that the symptomatology and prognosis of coronary events in patients with diabetes may differ from those in nondiabetic persons. A review of recent data demonstrates a higher mortality during the acute phase of myocardial infarction for diabetic patients than for their nondiabetic counterparts, possibly related to a higher incidence of congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock. The clinical course of diabetic patients with infarction and the role of insulin in myocardial adaptation to ischemia are both reviewed. Diabetic patients surviving the acute phase of myocardial infarction have a lower survival in follow-up than nondiabetic survivors, although some improvement in survival has been noted following beta-adrenergic-blocker therapy.",

    "40": "Renin release from the juxtaglomerular cell appears to be inversely related to calcium concentration. We studied the role of Ca+2 to confirm recent findings and to further explore the role of intracellular calcium as well as the calcium-calmodulin system in renin release. A rat renal cortical slice preparation was used. Isoproterenol (10(-6) M) caused significant stimulation of renin release, whereas angiotensin (AII; 5 X 10(-5) M) suppressed basal as well as isoproterenol-stimulated renin release. Removal of calcium from the buffer reversed AII suppression of renin release. Nifedipine (10(-5) M), a specific calcium channel blocker, induced a marked increase in basal renin release. TMB-8, an inhibitor of intracellular calcium release, also caused a dose-related increase in basal renin release. The calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine and calmidazolium both caused significant dose-related increases; however, calmidazolium was a more potent stimulator. Low extracellular calcium or nifedipine concentrations did not alter isoproterenol-induced renin release. Isoproterenol further stimulated renin release in the presence of trifluoperazine and calmidazolium. These results suggest that acute beta-adrenergic stimulation of renin in independent of changes in levels of extracellular and intracellular calcium and calmodulin. These studies provide further evidence that unlike most other secretory systems, the reduction of intracellular calcium or inhibition of the calcium-calmodulin system in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney acts as a secretogogue.", 
    "41": "Data for the first 12 months are reported for an ongoing, multicentre, clinical study comparing the long-term, ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of topical levobunolol (0.5% and 1%) and timolol (0.5%). This study was a double-masked trial testing 88 patients with chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. During the 12-month period drops were instilled twice daily into both eyes after a washout of prestudy ocular hypotensive medication. The effect of the three treatments in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) was similar. Mean IOP reductions over the 12 months averaged 7.2 mmHg for the 0.5% levobunolol group, 6.2 mmHg for the 1% levobunolol group, and 6.0 mmHg for the timolol group. Decreases in mean heart rate of up to 5 beats per minute were observed in the 0.5% levobunolol group, up to 8 beats per minute in the 1% levobunolol group, and up to 4 beats per minute in the timolol group. Several patients were removed from the study owing to side effects possibly related to levobunolol treatment.", 
    "42": "The Norwegian Multicenter Group Study noted the effect of smoking habits before and after myocardial infarction and their relation to mortality and reinfarction rate after treatment with timolol in patients surviving acute myocardial infarction. The mean follow up period was 17.3 (range 12-33) months. No relation was found between initial smoking habits and risk category after infarction or between initial smoking habits and later outcome. At the time of their first infarct smokers were seven years younger than non-smokers. One moth after infarction nearly 60% of the smokers had stopped smoking completely. A significantly lower incidence of early cardiac death and lower total mortality was found in patients treated with timolol in both those who continued smoking and in the combined non-smoking groups and a significantly lower reinfarction rate among non-smokers. Cessation of smoking alone was associated with a reduced reinfarction rate by 45% but a non-significant reduction in mortality by 26%. It is concluded that treatment with timolol and cessation of smoking have an additive effect in reducing mortality and reinfarction rate after myocardial infarction.",

    "44": "The incidence, risk factors and long-term prognosis of complex ventricular arrhythmias after coronary artery bypass graft surgery are not known. Complex ventricular arrhythmias are defined as Lown grades 4a (couplets), 4b (ventricular tachycardia) and 5 (R on T phenomenon). Ninety-two patients with normal left ventricular function who underwent elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery were prospectively evaluated. Ventricular arrhythmias were documented by predischarge 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring; 43% of patients had no or simple ventricular arrhythmias (Lown grades 1 to 3) and 57% had complex ventricular arrhythmias. Risk factors analyzed included age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, preoperative digoxin or propranolol therapy, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross-clamp time, number of vessels bypassed, peak creatine kinase (CK) elevation and pericarditis. No risk factor identified patients at higher risk for complex ventricular arrhythmias. Patients were followed up for 6 to 24 months (mean 16). Patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias did not have a higher incidence of sudden death, cardiac death, syncope, angina, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. It was concluded that: Complex ventricular arrhythmias are common after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. None of the risk factors considered identify high risk patients. Complex ventricular arrhythmias after coronary artery bypass graft surgery do not indicate a poor prognosis in patients with normal left ventricular function.", 
    "45": "An anthracycline-resistant subline of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60/AR) has been isolated in vitro by subculturing in progressively higher concentrations of Adriamycin. The resistant cells are capable of sustaining continuous growth in 10(-6) M Adriamycin which is more than 50 times the 50% inhibitory dose for the parent line. HL-60/AR expressed variable degrees of cross-resistance to daunorubicin, dihydroxyanthracenedione, vincristine, vinblastine, and actinomycin D, but it remained sensitive to methotrexate and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of glycoproteins of HL-60/AR revealed two prominent glycoproteins with molecular weights of 160,000 +/- 10,000 and 110,000 +/- 10,000 which were not detected in the sensitive cells. Cellular uptake and retention of daunorubicin was studied in the resistant and sensitive cells utilizing digitized video fluorescence microscopy. The sensitive cells accumulated more drug and showed at least 2-fold greater levels of brightness than the resistant cells. Studies of total intracellular accumulation, utilizing 10(-6) M [14C]-daunorubicin as a marker, showed a 1-h accumulation of 98 +/- 20 pmol/10(6) cells in HL-60/AR versus 255 +/- 25 pmol/10(6) cells in HL-60. Exposure to nontoxic concentrations of the calcium channel blocker Verapamil (10(-5) M) led to enhanced accumulation (175 +/- 8 pmol/10(6) cells) and retention of the drug in HL-60/AR, resulting in increased cytotoxicity in HL-60/AR. These anthracycline-resistant leukemic cells may serve as a valuable experimental model in studying the phenomenon of multiple drug resistance as well as strategies to circumvent it in human myeloid leukemia.", 
    "46": "Regional myocardial function during acute coronary artery occlusion was studied with ultrasonic dimension gauges in 20 open-chest anesthetized dogs. Two pairs of ultrasonic crystals were implanted in the left ventricular free wall near the epicardium in an ischemic segment and in a control nonischemic segment, and the segment length (SL) and maximum velocity of systolic shortening (max dL/dt) were measured. In six dogs, the wall thickness (WT) was measured simultaneously in the same regions with sonomicrometry. Left ventricular pressure (LVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and plasma norepinephrine concentration in the coronary sinus (NECS) were also measured. The heart rate was kept constant (180 beats/min) with atrial pacing. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded at its distal portion without propranolol in 12 dogs (group 1) and 30 min after propranolol in eight dogs (group 2). In the ischemic region, coronary artery occlusion resulted in an increase in end-diastolic SL (50% at 3 min after occlusion in group 1, P less than 0.005), and a decrease in max dL/dt in systole (36% at 5 min after occlusion in group 1, P less than 0.02). In the nonischemic region, end-diastolic SL did not change significantly, but an increase in max dL/dt (29% at 10 min after occlusion in group 1, P less than 0.005) was observed in systole. Under propranolol (group 2), the results were similar to those of group 1. There were no significant changes in LVP, AoP, AoP, and NECS during occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "We have examined the in vivo consequences of prolonged stimulation of the cardiovascular alpha-adrenergic receptor system in a rat model harboring pheochromocytoma. New England Deaconess Hospital rats with transplanted pheochromocytomas developed systolic hypertension and their plasma norepinephrine concentrations were approximately 60-fold greater than controls. Alpha 1-adrenergic receptors were quantitated in hearts from controls and rats with transplanted pheochromocytoma using the alpha 1-receptor selective antagonist [3H]prazosin. Down-regulation of alpha 1-receptors was found in the hearts of pheochromocytoma rats (33.0 vs. 23.0 fmol/mg protein) without any significant change in the affinities of these receptors for the circulating catecholamine, norepinephrine. Furthermore, the responsiveness of the blood vessel to the alpha-adrenergic stimulation was assessed using in vitro contractile experiments. Aortic rings from pheochromocytoma animals showed an eight fold decrease in sensitivity (EC50) and a 74% decrease in maximal contractility (Emax) to norepinephrine as compared with controls. Similarly, mesenteric artery rings prepared from the same animals showed a five fold loss of EC50 but no decrease in Emax to phenylephrine as compared with controls. In addition, serotonin EC50 and Emax of these mesentery preparations remained unaltered. Coupled with our previous findings [9], the present study suggests that rats with pheochromocytoma secreting large amounts of norepinephrine provide a valuable model system for studying in vivo desensitization of the cardiovascular alpha-receptor systems as well as the beta-adrenergic receptor system.", 
    "48": "The experiments were conducted in order to examine the mechanism of hyperthermia induced by l-ephedrine in rats. beta-Adrenoceptor agonists have been known to enhance normal body temperature. Therefore, the effect of various beta-adrenoceptor agonists on body temperature in rats was examined to clarify the mechanism of action of l-ephedrine. The results showed that drugs with beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist activity and l-ephedrine caused hyperthermia in rats and this effect was selectively inhibited by pretreatment of animals with propranolol (a mixed beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) or butoxamine (a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist). These results suggest that hyperthermic action of l-ephedrine may largely be due to its effect on beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "49": "The effect of sulfhydryl reagents on binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol hydrochloride [-)-[3H]DHA) to a microsomal fraction of rabbit ventricular muscle was studied. Incubation with the disulfide reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT), 2-mercaptoethanol, and reduced glutathione resulted in loss of (-)-[3H]DHA binding. At 500 microM DTT, less than 50% of specific binding activity remained; at 100 mM, binding was completely eliminated. 2-Mercaptoethanol and reduced glutathione were less effective than DTT at inhibiting binding activity. The total binding capacity (Bmax) decreased from 155.4 fmol mg-1 of protein, in the absence of DTT, to 92.4 and 77.5 fmol mg-1 at 0.25 and 0.7 mM DTT, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) increased from 7.6 nM, in the absence of DTT, to 10.3 nM at 0.25 mM DTT and to 20.8 nM at 0.7 mM DTT. Thus, DTT-induced decline in (-)-[3H]DHA binding results from a decrease in both the number and affinity of membrane binding sites for the tracer. Receptors could be protected from DTT inactivation by preincubation with beta-adrenergic ligands. Oxidants could not reverse inactivation, with the exception of o-iodosobenzoate which was only partially effective. Thus, the beta-adrenergic receptor of rabbit ventricular muscle contains essential disulfide moietie(s) which can be inactivated by reducing thiols.", 
    "50": "The significance of carbohydrate moieties containing the beta-adrenoceptor molecule in the rat brain was examined using radioligand binding assay methods. Thus, this experiment was designed to assess the effects of exoglycosidase (alpha-D-mannosidase and neuraminidase), endoglycosidase (endoglycosidase D and endoglycosidase H), and glycopeptidase A on the affinity of beta-adrenoceptor. The main reason why five kinds of enzymes were used in the present study is that they can hydrolyze different carbohydrate molecules from cell membranes. Rat brain was used and beta-adrenoceptor binding assay was carried out using 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) as a ligand. 3H-DHA binding to beta-adrenoceptors was sensitive to very low concentration of endoglycosidase H and glycopeptidase A, thus indicating that the treatments with these enzymes of rat brain membrane appear to decrease the number of beta-receptor binding sites. On the other hand, the treatment with neuraminidase, endoglycosidase H, and glycopeptidase A of the membrane induced lower values of the dissociation constant (Kd) than those of the control. alpha-D-mannosidase and endoglycosidase D are without effect in spite of the removal of hexose contents and total carbohydrate contents with these treatments, respectively. These results imply that complex type N-linked acidic carbohydrate chains containing neuraminic acid and high mannose type N-linked carbohydrate chains, which are hydrolyzed with endoglycosidase H and glycopeptidase A, of the rat brain membrane containing beta-adrenoceptor molecules play a crucial role in the drug-receptor interaction.", 
    "51": "In purified ventricular myocytes from adult rabbit, beta-adrenergic stimulation causes cyclic AMP accumulation and cyclic AMP-protein kinase activation in both particulate and soluble fractions of the cell, whereas prostaglandin E1 elevates cyclic AMP and cyclic AMP-protein kinase activity in the soluble fraction exclusively. Only activation of particulate cyclic AMP-protein kinase activity results in phosphorylase b----a conversion. Using radioligand binding technics, we have determined whether beta 1- and beta 2-receptor subtypes mediate beta-adrenergic effects in particulate and soluble subcellular compartments, respectively. The non-selective antagonist [125I]iodocyanopindolol binds to intact ventricular myocytes with KD of 25 pM and a Bmax of 2.6 X 10(5) receptors/myocyte. Competition for [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding to intact myocytes by the beta-receptor subtype-specific antagonists practolol (beta 1) and zinterol (beta 2) results in monophasic curves with antagonist KD values of 1 microM and 1.5 microM, respectively. We conclude that adult rabbit cardiac myocytes do not possess detectable beta 2 receptors. Further, the ability of isoproterenol to cause elevation of cyclic AMP in two functionally distinct regions within the myocyte must pertain to the actions of a single subtype of beta-receptor, the beta 1-receptor.", 
    "52": "The mechanisms of action of extracellular mitogens for normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were investigated by observing their effects on selected biochemical pathways when the cells were incubated in serum-free media. We find that (a) epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and the rate of cell division without stimulating cAMP; (b) alone, pituitary extract (PEX) does not stimulate ODC activity, cAMP levels, or cell division; (c) when PEX is added to medium containing EGF there is a further increase in both ODC activity and the rate of cell division, again with no increase in cAMP levels; (d) in contrast, alone, L-epinephrine (EPI) stimulates an increase in both ODC and cAMP but does not stimulate cell division; (e) when EPI is added to medium containing both EGF and PEX a further increase in the rate of cell division is noted; (f) the specific inhibitor of ODC, alpha-(difluoromethyl)-ornithine (DMFO), also inhibits NHBE cell proliferation; and (g) the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol inhibits the mitogenic action and ODC induction by EPI observed under condition e. We conclude that an increase in ODC activity is necessary but not sufficient for an increase in proliferation of NHBE cells. In contrast, cAMP stimulation is not necessary for an increase in NHBE cell division. However, in the presence of undefined factors in PEX, increases in cAMP levels result in a synergistic increase in the rate of EGF-stimulated clonal growth. By correlating the biochemical pathways invoked by EGF, PEX, EPI, and combinations thereof with their mitogenic actions, we have better defined the role each of these different mitogens plays in stimulating epithelial cell division.", 
    "53": "Strips of human pulmonary arteries from patients undergoing surgery for lung tumour were incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline. Subsequently, they were superfused with physiological salt solution containing cocaine and corticosterone. Tritium overflow from the strips was stimulated by transmural electrical impulses (2 Hz). The electrically evoked overflow of tritium consisted of 91% unmetabolized [3H]-noradrenaline, and this percentage was not altered by isoprenaline. Adrenaline (in the presence of rauwolscine), isoprenaline and the preferential beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, procaterol, concentration-dependently increased the electrically evoked tritium overflow. Prenalterol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist with moderate preference for beta 1-adrenoceptors, was considerably less active than the previously mentioned agonists; noradrenaline (in the presence of rauwolscine) was ineffective. The concentration-response curve of procaterol was shifted to the right by the preferential beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118-551 but was not affected by the beta 1-selective antagonist, atenolol. Propranolol, but not atenolol, produced a shift to the right of the concentration-response curve of isoprenaline. It is concluded that the sympathetic nerve fibres of the human pulmonary artery are endowed with facilitatory presynaptic beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "54": "The waking EEG of DBA/2 mice is punctuated by conspicuous bursts of high-amplitude, 6-7-cps spindles. Catecholamine depletion by 2.0 mg/kg, i.p., reserpine or 120 mg/kg, i.p., alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine increased the occurrence and duration of these brief spindle episodes (BSEs). This effect may reflect noradrenergic depletion because the beta-noradrenergic antagonist propranolol (10 mg/kg, i.p.) powerfully promoted BSE occurrence and increased BSE duration in freely-moving and midpontine-transected mice, whereas the dopamine antagonist haloperidol (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) neither increased nor decreased BSE occurrence. The alpha-noradrenergic agonist clonidine (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), which is known to inhibit noradrenergic neuronal firing as well as act at postsynaptic alpha receptors, also promoted BSE occurrence in transected mice. In addition, the dopamine agonist apomorphine (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) increased BSE occurrence in freely-moving mice once the behavioral activation it produced subsided. These effects were blocked by 2.0 mg/kg haloperidol, i.p. The convulsant drug pentylenetetrazol, which is known to promote BSE occurrence at subconvulsant doses in DBA/2 mice, may activate BSEs, in part, by activating dopamine neurons: 2.0 mg/kg haloperidol, i.p., partially blocked the facilitation of BSEs by 20 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol, i.p., in midpontine DBA/2 mice. Thus, noradrenergic neurons may block spindle occurrence in DBA/2 mice whereas dopamine neurons may be one of several systems that can promote spindle occurrence.", 
    "55": "The present study examined the developmental changes in the adrenergic control of glycogenolysis in the rat model. A relatively new beta-adrenergic radioligand, 125I-iodocyanopindolol (ICP), was examined in binding assays with rat liver plasma membrane (LPM). ICP demonstrated both a higher specificity and a greater affinity for beta-adrenergic receptors than any previously available beta-adrenergic radioligand used to study rat LPM. Utilizing this new ligand it was found that beta-adrenergic receptor density decreased from 114 +/- 4 fmol mg-1 in newborn LPM to 19 +/- 3 fmol mg-1 in adult male LPM. In contrast alpha-adrenergic receptor density examined using 3H-prazosin increased from 161 +/- 14 fmol mg-1 in the newborn to 554 +/- 59 fmol mg-1 in the adult male. The results of ICP displacement assays employing various beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists indicated that ICP binding sites were beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Both guanosine triphosphate and its nonhydrolyzable synthetic analog guanylyl-imidodiphosphate lowered the affinity of epinephrine for ICP binding sites similarly in newborn and adult LPM. Thus the coupling of receptor to guanine nucleotide regulatory protein appeared to be the same in both age groups examined. In isolated hepatocytes glycogen phosphorylase activation was mediated by beta 2-adrenergic stimuli in the newborn and predominantly alpha-adrenergic stimuli in the adult male. These results suggest that the change in glycogen phosphorylase activation from beta- to predominantly alpha-adrenergic mechanisms seen with maturation is related to changes in receptor density.", 
    "56": "Saliva was elicited from rat salivary glands by terbutaline at i.p. doses of 1, 5, 10 and 25 mg/kg b.wt. but not by doses of 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg b.wt. Dobutamine elicited no secretion at 1 or 2 mg/kg but did at 5, 10 and 25 mg/kg b.wt. At 5 mg/kg terbutaline evoked nearly maximal volumes but with dobutamine, volumes were small at this dosage. At dosages of 10 and 25 mg/kg volumes with the two agonists were similar for parotid, but with submandibular, the volumes evoked by dobutamine were nearly two times as high as those elicited by terbutaline. Mean [Ca] of parotid saliva was also similar at all dosages of dobutamine (approximately 12 mEq/liter) and generally similar at all dosages of terbutaline (11-15 mEq/liter). Mean [Ca] of dobutamine-elicited submandibular saliva was approximately 6, 7 and 8 mEq/liter at 5, 10 and 25 mg/kg b.wt, respectively. With parotid, [Ca] was approximately 10 mEq/liter at 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg b.wt. but increased to 16-18 mEq/liter at 25 mg/kg. The time course of calcium secretion is described for both agonists at each dosage. [Ca] of both glands was decreased 60 min after i.p. injection of 10 or 25 mg/kg doses of dobutamine or terbutaline but was not changed by 5 mg/kg doses. Administration of 10 mg/kg of atenolol, the selective beta 1 antagonist, 20 min prior to injection of a 10 mg/kg dose of either terbutaline (beta 2 agonist) or dobutamine (beta 1 agonist) blocked secretion from both glands, and prevented the usual agonist-induced reduction in glandular concentration of calcium. Butoxamine, on the other hand, did not modify effects of terbutaline on fluid secretion or depletion of glandular calcium; it did partially inhibit dobutamine-induced fluid and calcium secretion but not depletion of glandular calcium. The present data suggest that beta adrenoceptors of salivary glands are predominantly of the beta 1 subtype and that it is these that regulate calcium and fluid secretion. On the basis of the data with the antagonists, it is concluded that terbutaline activates beta 1 rather than beta 2 receptors since the beta 1 antagonist but not the beta 2 antagonist blocked secretory responses to terbutaline.", 
    "57": "Observations in vivo suggest that catecholamines modulate reabsorptive functions of proximal tubules by acting on beta-adrenoceptors. However, beta-catecholamine binding sites or beta-adrenoceptor-sensitive adenylate cyclase (AdC) has not been found in segments of proximal tubules of rat, rabbit, or mouse kidney. In the present study, we investigated the responsiveness of AdC to catecholamines, [8-Arg]vasopressin (AVP), and to parathyroid hormone (PTH) in proximal convoluted tubules (PCT), proximal straight tubules (PST), and in late distal convoluted tubules (LDCT) microdissected from canine kidney. Isoproterenol (ISO) caused a marked and dose-dependent stimulation of AdC in PST (maximum: delta + 850%; half maximum stimulation at 10(-7) M ISO), but ISO had no effect on AdC in PCT. The AdC in both PCT and PST was markedly stimulated by PTH; AVP stimulated the AdC in LDCT but not in PST or in PCT. The stimulatory effect of 10(-5) M ISO in PST (delta + 725%) was significantly greater than in LDCT (delta + 307%); norepinephrine and epinephrine had stimulatory effects in PST similar to ISO. The stimulation of AdC in PST by ISO was blocked by propranolol and by beta 2-blocker ICI-118551. On the other hand, alpha-blocker phentolamine and beta 1-blocker metoprolol did not abolish the stimulation of AdC in PST by ISO. The accumulation of cAMP in intact PCT and PST incubated in vitro was stimulated by PTH both in PST and in PCT, but ISO elevated cAMP (delta + 683%) only in PST. Our results show that proximal tubules of canine nephron, PST but not PCT, contain beta-adrenoceptors of beta 2 subtype coupled to AdC. These observations provide direct evidence that the effects of catecholamines, either released from renal nerve endings or arriving from blood supply, can act directly on beta 2-adrenoceptors located in proximal tubules, and also suggest that at least some of the catecholamine effects in proximal tubules are mediated via cAMP generation.", 
    "58": "The transmural distribution of coronary blood flow was studied during vagal stimulation in closed-chest, morphine- and alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs. The left main coronary artery was cannulated and perfused at constant pressure. Bradycardia during vagal stimulation was prevented by atrioventricular heart block and ventricular pacing. Beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked with propranolol (1 mg/kg iv), and aortic pressure was stabilized by means of a pressure reservoir. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured with 9-micron radioactive microspheres during vagal stimulation and during intracoronary acetylcholine infusion. Vagal stimulation increased coronary blood flow uniformly across the left ventricular wall. In contrast, intracoronary acetylcholine infusion, at a rate selected to increase total flow to the same degree, vasodilated the subendocardium more than the subepicardium, increasing the inner/outer blood flow ratio. It is concluded that both vagal activation and acetylcholine produce coronary vasodilation that is independent of left ventricular preload, afterload, and heart rate. Acetylcholine vasodilation preferentially vasodilates the subendocardium, increasing the inner/outer flow ratio, but vagal stimulation produces uniform vasodilation across the left ventricular wall.", 
    "59": "The mechanism by which viruses bind to and infect specific tissues to cause disease has only recently begun to be understood. The mammalian reoviruses provide an especially attractive model for studying the details of cell surface recognition. The cell and tissue tropism of reovirus is determined by a portion of the viral hemagglutinin termed the neutralization domain. We have reported previously on the generation of both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies that mimic the viral hemagglutinin in the specificity of binding to the reovirus receptor. By using these anti-idiotypic antibodies as specific probes, we have successfully isolated the mammalian reovirus receptor from neuronal and lymphoid cells. In the present study, we report that the reovirus receptor is structurally similar to the mammalian beta-adrenergic receptor. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (i) purified beta-adrenergic receptor is immunoprecipitable by anti-reovirus receptor antibody; (ii) purified reovirus receptor obtained from murine thymoma cells and beta-adrenergic receptor obtained from calf lung exhibit identical molecular masses and isoelectric points; (iii) trypsin digests of purified reovirus and beta-adrenergic receptors display indistinguishable fragment patterns; (iv) purified reovirus receptor binds the beta-antagonist [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol and this binding is blocked by the beta-agonist isoproterenol.", 
    "60": "The hypothesis that behavioral responses to antidepressant drugs in the forced swim test are related to a rapid neural adaptation produced by the combination of drug treatment and swim stress was explored. As a measure of adaptation, brain beta adrenergic receptors were assayed using [3H]dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]DHA) binding to brain membranes from rats that were processed in the forced swim test. The combination of swim stress and imipramine treatment antagonized immobility induced by forced swimming and resulted in a reduction in [3H] DHA binding to membranes from forebrain preparations which did not include the corpus striatum. Administration of antidepressant drugs from other chemical classes, including pargyline, iprindole and nomifensine, also reduced immobility induced by the forced swim and produced a reduction in [3H]DHA binding to forebrain membranes. In homogenates of the corpus striatum, [3H]DHA binding was not altered by swim stress combined with antidepressant drug treatment. Chlordiazepoxide was without an effect on immobility or beta receptor binding when combined with forced swim. Even though atropine and amphetamine exhibited a positive activity in the forced swim test, they did not reduce [3H]DHA binding. Therefore, by combining behavioral and neurochemical analysis of animals processed in the forced swim test, it may be possible to differentiate, with greater confidence, potential antidepressant drugs from \"false positives.\" The present studies support the hypothesis that antidepressant drug action in the forced swim test involves a rapid neural adaptation as reflected by the down regulation of beta adrenergic receptors. Thus, this behavioral paradigm may serve as a model of adaptive mechanisms induced by antidepressant drugs.", 
    "61": "The BG dog manifests various characteristics of human asthma, including airway hyperreactivity to low concentrations of methacholine. Studies have suggested that airway hyperreactivity in asthma is related to inadequate intracellular cAMP responses. We studied cAMP characteristics in MNL from 19 BG and 14 mongrel dogs. beta-Adrenergic receptors were assessed by 125I CYP in the presence and absence of propranolol. The responses of cAMP to ISO were measured by radioimmunoassay. Adenylate cyclase activity was determined in homogenized MNL preparations by cAMP generation. PDE activity was quantitated by radioenzyme assay. Mongrel dog leukocyte ISO-stimulated cAMP levels doubled, whereas there were negligible increases in MNL from BG dogs. Basal PDE levels were higher in BG dogs than in mongrel dogs. The PDE inhibitor Ro 20-1724 restored ISO-stimulated cAMP responses in MNL of BG dogs. Adenylate cyclase activity was not lower in MNL homogenates from BG dogs than in mongrel dogs. Cells from both BG and mongrel dogs demonstrated similar receptor numbers and affinities of saturable, specific beta-adrenergic binding over a 10 pM to 400 pM range. Our results suggest that depressed cAMP responses in BG dogs are due to high PDE activity rather than to a defect in the beta-adrenergic receptor adenylate cyclase system.", 
    "62": "Nociceptive stimulation of the peritoneum inhibits colonic motility via a sympathoadrenergic reflex. This sympathetic reflex most probably induces the inhibition indirectly via a presynaptic blockade of cholinergic transmission. To further clarify this reflex, colonic motility was continuously recorded by a volume method in rats exposed to nociceptive abdominal stimulation and intravenous drug administration. Intraabdominally applied HCl inhibited colonic motility, which was unaffected by nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol). However, the nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine and the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine restored motility. Spontaneous colonic motility was unaffected by the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist (isoproterenol) and the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist (L-phenylephrine). On the other hand, a nonselective alpha-agonist (noradrenaline) and a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist (clonidine) inhibited spontaneous colonic motility. It is suggested that in the rat sympathetic reflex inhibition of colonic motility caused by abdominal nociception is mediated via presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors inhibiting the excitatory cholinergic neurons.", 
    "63": "beta-Adrenergic receptor subtypes were localized and differentiated in rat kidney slices by in vitro autoradiography using the nonselective beta-antagonist [125I]iodocyanopindolol in the presence of the selective agents betaxolol (beta 1) and zinterol (beta 2). [125I]Iodocyanopindolol binding to kidney sections in the presence of these agents could be differentiated into high- and low-affinity components as predicted by the subtype selectivity of the compounds. Autoradiography revealed that: beta-adrenergic receptors were highly concentrated within the renal cortex, especially in glomeruli and juxtaglomerular granule cells, and to tubular sites in the cortex and medulla; [125I]iodocyanopindolol labeling of the juxtaglomeruluar granule cells was abolished at lower concentrations (10(-8) M) of betaxolol than was the labeling of glomeruli (10(-6)--10(-4) M); and zinterol had little effect on labeling of juxtaglomerular granule cells and glomeruli unless high concentrations were used, whereas the tubular labeling in medulla was much more sensitive to incubation with zinterol. These results indicate that beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes are differentially distributed within the kidney: beta 1, predominantly contained in juxtaglomerular granule cells and glomeruli, and beta 2, predominantly in medullary tubules. In vitro autoradiography provides a useful means to examine different receptor populations in discrete tissue areas.", 
    "64": "The effect of a 90-min iv infusion of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist (0.2 mg/kg BW), on basal plasma GH levels and the GH responses to an iv bolus injection of GH-releasing hormone-(1-44)-NH2 (GHRH; 1 microgram/kg BW) was examined in 10 prepubertal children (6 short but otherwise normal and 4 normal). The iv injection of GHRH resulted in significant increases in plasma GH, comparable to those after either insulin-induced hypoglycemia or arginine infusion. Only a small and inconsistent increase in plasma GH levels occurred during the iv infusion of propranolol, whereas simultaneous administration of propranolol with GHRH caused marked enhancement of GHRH-induced GH release in all subjects. The difference between the plasma GH response to GHRH given with propranolol and the response to GHRH given with 0.9% saline was significantly greater than that between the plasma GH level after propranolol and that after 0.9% saline infusion without GHRH injections. There was no difference in plasma GH responses to GHRH, propranolol, or both in the normal short children or normal children. These findings indicate that beta-adrenergic blockade potentiates GHRH-induced GH secretion in prepubertal children.", 
    "65": "The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on heart rate in anaesthetized cats were analysed both in intact animals and after spinal section plus vagotomy. The intact cat responded to 5-HT (3, 10 and 30 micrograms X kg-1, i.v.) with a brief, but intense, bradycardia and a longer-lasting hypotension. Administration of MDL 72222, a selective antagonist of M-type 5-HT receptors, blocked bradycardia elicited by 5-HT without affecting that caused by stimulation of the vagus nerve. In spinal cats the same doses of 5-HT increased heart rate and blood pressure. These effects remained essentially unchanged after bilateral adrenalectomy, guanethidine, propranolol and burimamide, suggesting that 5-HT acted directly on the myocardium and blood vessels. The tachycardic responses to 5-HT in spinal cats were little affected by 0.5 mg X kg-1 doses of MDL 72222 or of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, ketanserin, ritanserin or cyproheptadine. In contrast, the non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist, methysergide, which binds to both 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 recognition sites in rat brain membranes, potently antagonized the 5-HT-induced tachycardia in doses of 0.05 to 0.5 mg X kg-1. However pizotifen and mianserin, two other 5-HT2 antagonists which show poor affinity for 5-HT1 recognition sites, were also effective against the tachycardic response to 5-HT in doses of 0.5-4.5 mg X kg-1. The pressor responses to 5-HT in the spinal cat were markedly inhibited by all six 5-HT2 antagonists at a dose of 0.5 mg X kg-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Thirty-four hyperthyroid patients were divided into four groups: placebo, carteolol (20 mg/day), indenolol (60 mg/day) and metoprolol (120 mg/day) groups. The heart rate was determined before and two weeks after the treatment with each drug. Serum levels of T4, T3 and rT3 were measured before, and one and two weeks after the treatment. Both indenolol and metoprolol significantly reduced the heart rate (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively), whereas carteolol was ineffective. Carteolol significantly decreased T4 from 23.4 +/- 4.4 micrograms/100 ml to 20.1 +/- 3.2 micrograms/100 ml (p less than 0.01) in one week and to 20.0 +/- 3.7 micrograms/100 ml (p less than 0.01) in two weeks. T3 and rT3 were also decreased significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively) two weeks after the treatment with carteolol. After two weeks of indenolol treatment, T4 was decreased significantly from 26.2 +/- 8.5 micrograms/100 ml to 23.9 +/- 8.2 micrograms/100 ml (p less than 0.05) and T3 from 789 +/- 391 ng/100 ml to 592 +/- 340 ng/100 ml (p less than 0.02). Metoprolol had no effect on serum thyroid hormone levels. The decrease in the serum level of thyroid hormones by carteolol and indenolol but not by metoprolol in patients with hyperthyroidism would be due to the blockade of beta 2-adrenoreceptors concerning with thyroid hormone secretion.", 
    "67": "This discussion reviews drugs that affect the eye, including antihyperglycemic agents; corticosteroids; antirheumatic drugs (quinolines, indomethacin, and allopurinol); psychiatric drugs (phenothiazine, thioridazine, and chlorpromazine); drugs used in cardiology (practolol, amiodarone, and digitalis gylcosides); drugs implicated in optic neuritis and atrophy, drugs with an anticholinergic action; oral contraceptives (OCs); and topical drugs and systemic effects. Refractive changes, either myopic or hypermetropic, can occur as a result of hyperglycemia, and variation in vision is sometimes a presenting symptom in diabetes mellitus. If it causes a change in the refraction, treatment of hyperglycemia almost always produces a temporary hypermetropia. A return to the original refractive state often takes weeks, sometimes months. There is some evidence that patients adequately treated with insulin improve more rapidly than those taking oral medication. Such patients always should be referred for opthalmological evaluation as other factors might be responsible, but it might not be possible to order the appropriate spectacle correction for some time. The most important ocular side effect of the systemic adiministration of corticosteroids is the formation of a posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma also can result from corticosteroids, most often when they are applied topically. Corticosteroids have been implicated in the production of benign intracranial hypertension, which is paradoxical because they also are used in its treatment. The most important side effect of drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is an almost always irreversible maculopathy with resultant loss of central vision. Corneal and retinal changes similar to those caused by the quinolines have been reported with indomethacin, but there is some question about a cause and effect relationship. The National Registry of Drug Induced Ocular Side Effects in the US published 30 case histories of cataract suspected to be induced by allopurinol; numerous additional cases have been reported to the registry since. Phenothiazine, with an estimated 3% incidence of side effects, appears to be safer than other antipsychotic drugs, but the rate of ocular effects increases with the duration of therapy. Thioridazine and chlorpromazine are known to cause lens deposits and pigmentary retinopathy. There is a significantly high prevalence of thrombophlebitis and pseudotumor cerebri among women who use OCs and thrombotic retinal vascular disease, such as retinal vein occulsion, might be linked with them. It also is probable that, because of altered hydration of the cornea, there is a decreased tolerance to contact lenses.", 
    "68": "The present study investigated sympathetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of colonic motility and blood flow in the cat. Infusion of neuropeptide Y (NPY) close i.a. produced an inhibition of colonic motility and a vasoconstriction of long duration but no post-infusion vasodilatation. In contrast to NPY, porcine pancreatic polypeptide did not evoke any vascular or motility response. On a molar basis, NPY was 25 times more potent than noradrenaline in producing 50% reduction of the colonic blood flow. These vascular and motility effects of NPY were resistant to guanethidine, phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. Thus, the action of NPY on vascular and colonic smooth muscle did not seem to be mediated via adrenergic receptors. Noradrenaline administered close i.a. produced inhibition of colonic motility, and vasoconstriction followed by a rapid vasodilatation. These effects were completely blocked by combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Electrical stimulation of the splanchnic and lumbar colonic nerves produced an overall inhibition of colonic motility, and vasoconstriction of the proximal and distal colon, respectively, with a rapid post-stimulatory vasodilatation. After combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade the inhibitory effect of the nerve stimulations on colonic motility partly remained together with a marked vasoconstriction, which was most pronounced upon lumbar colonic nerve stimulation. All vascular effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation were eradicated by guanethidine, which also abolished the inhibitory motility response to splanchnic nerve stimulation. However, lumbar colonic nerve stimulation elicited a colonic contraction, possibly due to stimulation of afferent C-fibres. The present findings indicate the existence of a sympathetic nonadrenergic neuronal mechanism mediating vasoconstriction and inhibition of colonic motility in the cat. Thus, NPY may be released from noradrenergic neurons to act on colonic smooth muscle and vessels.", 
    "69": "In the Netherlands timolol maleate, probably the drug of first choice in antiglaucoma therapy, is often combined with other intraocular pressure lowering drugs. The efficacy of most combinations have been discussed in the literature several times, except the one with aceclidine, a parasympathetic drug, that has a reasonable popularity in Western Europe. Unlike pilocarpine, aceclidine does not seem to give a clinically significant additional pressure lowering effect in timolol pre-treated eyes. The decrease in IOP in aceclidine pre-treated eyes after single dose timolol seems to be an effect of timolol alone. Our results suggest that co-administration of timolol and aceclidine is not a rational action in antiglaucomatous therapy.", 
    "70": "302 male myocardial infarction patients were divided into 4 groups according to their symptom-limited physical working capacity and examined during bicycle ergometer training. Lactic acid and heart rate during training were measured.", 
    "71": "Arterial lactic acid and training heart rate decreased proportionally with the reduction of the maximal symptom-limited working capacity. Arterial lactic acid levels in 4 training groups of 100, 75, 50 and 25 watts were 2.23 (2.56) mmol/l, 1.87 (2.32) mmol/l, 1.58 (1.73) mmol/l and 1.20 (1.11) mmol/l, respectively, p less than 0.001 (in bracket = with beta blocker). Decrease in arterial lactic acid levels according to the reduction of working capacity corresponded to a decrease of training heart rate. In patients with beta blocker therapy results were less pronounced. Intensity of training corresponded to about 80% of VO2 measured as maximal symptom-limited physical working capacity. Training heart rate corresponded to about 85% of maximal heart rate as measured at symptom-limited physical working capacity. The so-called fixed anaerobic threshold of 4 mmol/l lactic acid was not reached by patients with myocardial infarction up to a training intensity of 100 watts (approximately 1.3 watts/kg). From this study it can be concluded that fixed anaerobic threshold and lactic acid are of secondary importance in determining the intensity of endurance training in patients with myocardial infarction.", 
    "72": "Double- and triple-barreled ion-sensitive microelectrodes were used to measure changes in extracellular K+ and Na+ concentrations ([K+]o, [Na+]o) in brown fat. Redox states of different respiratory enzymes were measured simultaneously in order to correlate ion movements with metabolic activity. Trains of stimuli applied to the efferent nerves evoked two distinct increases in [K+]o. A first, small, rapid increase occurred within 10 s and accompanied a first, rapid membrane depolarization. A second, slow increase of [K+]o occurred several minutes after stimulation and accompanied a second, slow depolarization. A few seconds after stimulation onset, while the membrane was repolarizing and shifts in redox states indicated increases in lipolysis and respiration, [K+]o decreased. The [K+]o decrease was accompanied by an increase in [Na+]o, and could be partly blocked by ouabain. Phentolamine, an alpha-antagonist that blocks the first depolarization, also blocked the first, rapid [K+]o increase and part of the subsequent decrease. Propranolol, a beta-antagonist, had little effect on the first depolarization and the first increase in [K+]o, but blocked part of the subsequent [K+]o decrease and the second, slow [K+]o increase. The changes in [K+]o were almost completely abolished in the presence of both antagonists. It is concluded that brown adipocytes take up K+ and simultaneously lose Na+ in response to the interaction of noradrenaline with alpha- and beta-receptors, and this indicates a very early stimulation of the Na+ pump.", 
    "73": "Myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, cerebrovascular accidents, blood pressure control and treatment tolerability were studied in a randomized double-blind trial conducted in 6357 men and women aged 40-64 years with uncomplicated essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressures 100-125 mmHg). At the start of the trial 3185 patients received treatment based on a beta-blocker (oxprenolol), while in the remaining 3172 placebo replaced oxprenolol. Supplementary drugs, excluding beta-blockers, were used as necessary in both treatment groups, with the aim of reducing diastolic pressure to 95 mmHg or less. Patients were followed for 3-5 years, a total of 25 651 patient years at risk. In most respects the two groups fared equally well; sudden death (relative risk [RR] 1.08; 95% confidence interval [Cl] 0.68 and 1.72), myocardial infarction (RR 0.83; Cl 0.59 and 1.16) and cerebrovascular accident (RR 0.97; Cl 0.64 and 1.47) rates were similar. Beta-blocker based therapy was associated with significantly lower average blood pressures, earlier ECG normalization, less hypokalaemia and fewer withdrawals from double-blind treatment for uncontrolled hypertension. Doctor-elicited and patient-assessed unwanted effects demonstrated overall good tolerability. In smokers the cardiac event rate was doubled. We propose that beta-blocker treatment effects depend on smoking status, with a significant interaction benefiting non-smoking men. Lower blood pressures during treatment were associated with substantially lower rates for cardiac as well as cerebrovascular events. Proportional hazards analysis also underlines the importance of other cardiovascular risk factors. The IPPPSH stresses the need for a comprehensive approach to the management of blood pressure and other risk factors in hypertensive patients.", 
    "74": "The effect of hypoxia on contractile performance of left ventricular papillary muscles from 2-week old and 6-month old rats was studied. Left ventricular glycogen concentration was not significantly different between 2-week and 6-month old hearts; however, the lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme pattern of the left ventricular myocardium from the 2-week old rats demonstrated a shift toward M-type (anaerobic) distribution relative to 6-month-old animals. Papillary muscle performance was studied at 28 degrees C while contracting 12 times/min at the peak of the active tension curve in oxygenated (95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide) Krebs-Henseleit solution containing glucose concentrations from 5.5 to 22 mM. In a bath containing 5.5 mM glucose, the decline in developed tension during hypoxia (95% nitrogen, 5% carbon dioxide) of preparations from the 2-week old rats was significantly less (P less than 0.05) than the 6-month old group only at 15 min. Raising the glucose concentrations of the bath to 11 and 16.5 mM resulted in improved performance throughout 60 min of hypoxia in preparations from 2-week compared with 6-month old animals. Practolol (5 X 10(-5)M) did not prevent the increased tolerance to hypoxia observed in preparations from 2-week animals. Thus, increasing anaerobic substrate has differential effects on the performance of 2-week and 6-month myocardium during hypoxia. The data suggests that in contrast to 6-month old heart muscle, myocardium from 2-week old rats is capable of modulating its active mechanical activity during hypoxia in accordance with the availability of glycolyptic substrate.", 
    "75": "Beta-receptor antagonists lower exercise heart rate and cardiac output, and can thus be expected to interfere with oxygen transport, and hence physical performance, particularly at higher levels of activity. Therefore, the effects of a 4-week and 15-month treatment period with the beta 1-selective receptor blocker acebutolol (500 mg daily) on oxygen uptake and plasma catecholamines during submaximal steady-state and maximal exercise and on maximal work load were studied in eight WHO stage 1 hypertensive men (mean age 36.4 years). Oxygen uptake, ventilation, and plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine concentrations during steady-state exercise were not significantly different from control conditions either after 4 weeks or after 15 months of receptor blockade, although heart rates were significantly (27% and 25%, respectively; P less than 0.01) reduced. After the 4-week treatment period, maximal oxygen uptake (3.9% reduction, NS) and maximal work load (2.4% reduction, NS) tended to be slightly lower after acebutolol compared with control values; maximal oxygen pulse was significantly (P less than 0.05) increased. However, after long-term treatment of 15 months, maximal oxygen uptake was virtually identical compared with pretreatment values, and maximal work load tended to be higher (5.2%, NS); plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations were significantly (P less than 0.05) enhanced. Since beta 1-selective receptor blockers do not affect maximal oxygen uptake and maximal work capacity after long-term treatment, they appear preferable for patients taking part in preventive and rehabilitative training programs.", 
    "76": "This paper presents a review of studies dealing with combined beta-adrenoceptor blockade and vasodilatation in the treatment of hypertension. This therapy can be achieved either through the combined use of conventional beta-adrenoceptor blocking compounds given together with vasodilator drugs or with agents which show multiple action of this kind. From a hemodynamic point of view this therapeutic approach is quite logical since most forms of established hypertension are characterized by increased vascular resistance. It can therefore be concluded that combined beta-adrenoceptor blockade and vasodilation offers a rational and useful treatment of hypertension.", 
    "77": "Chronic administration of nadolol has been reported to reduce blood pressure either without or with a concomitant fall of renal blood flow. We therefore studied the effects of nadolol 80 mg once daily on ambulatory blood pressure, renal and systemic haemodynamics in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Ten patients took part in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, each phase of which lasted 4 weeks. Nadolol significantly reduced ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate, but had no effect on blood pressure variability. Cardiac output was significantly reduced by nadolol and total peripheral resistance increased but without reaching statistical significance. Despite the fall in blood pressure and cardiac output, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged. The fraction of cardiac output reaching the kidneys rose significantly and renal vascular resistance was significantly reduced. Body weight, urinary sodium excretion and urine flow rate remained unchanged. We conclude that nadolol 80 mg once daily lowers ambulatory blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate hypertension without impairment of renal blood flow, indicating a redistribution of cardiac output to the kidneys. The mechanism of the renal vasodilator effect of nadolol remains to be determined.", 
    "78": "Five thousand patients of atheromatous heart disease, presented as angina pectoris, were studied over a period of five years. After adding the 'Husk of Isabgol' and 'aloe vera' (an indigenous plant known as ghee-guar-ka-paththa) to the diet, a marked reduction in total serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, fasting and post prandial blood sugar level in diabetic patients, total lipids and also increase in HDL were noted. Simultaneously the clinical profile of these patients showed reduction in the frequency of anginal attacks and gradually, the drugs, like verapamil, nifedipine, beta-blockers and nitrates, were tapered. The patients, most benefitted, were diabetics (without adding any antidiabetic drug). The exact mechanism of the action of the above two substances is not known, but it appears, that probably they act by their high fibre contents. Both these substances need further evaluation. The most interesting aspect of the study was that no untoward side effect was noted and all the five thousand patients are surviving till date."
