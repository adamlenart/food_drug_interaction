In the response, hindquarter flow was increased by more than 50%, superior mesenteric and renal flows were decreased by about 30 and 15%, respectively, and common carotid flow remained almost unchanged. The increase in hindquarter flow in the response was much less after beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol. In adrenalectomized rats the flow changes in the hindquarter, mesenteric, and renal areas were less marked in either direction. These findings indicate that the blood flow redistribution in the transposition response is characterized by a shift of flow from the viscera to the skeletal muscles, in which the alpha- and beta-effects of catecholamines released from the adrenal medulla in the response play a dominant role.", 
    "1": "7 merino sheep in an advanced state of pregnancy received oxytocin for labour induction under the conditions of control, monotherapy with the beta 2-adrenergic tocolytic fenoterol, combination of the latter with the beta 1-blocking substance metoprolol (Beloc). Likewise, the effect of labour induction was investigated when putting an artificial stenosis around the a. uterina during simultaneous application of fenoterol alone and combined with metoprolol. The following parameters were measured: aortic pressure and heart rate both in dam and fetus, maternal left ventricular pressure rising velocity, intrauterine pressure, uterine blood flow, uterine vascular resistance and regional myometrial contraction patterns by means of an ultrasonic transit time method. Measurement of maternal cardiovascular parameters once more showed, that maternal cardiovascular derangements could excellently be antagonised by metoprolol. Intrauterine pressure measurements as well as regional myometrial contraction patterns proved evidence, that there is no counteraction between the beta 2-mimetic substance and the beta 1-blocking agent concerning the tocolytic effect. When artificially stenosing the a. uterina, a rise in uterine contraction status could be observed; this hypoxic augmentation of myometrial tone could almost completely be reverted when combining fenoterol and metoprolol. Finally, no difference could be observed in the reaction of fetal cardiovascular parameters to reduced uterine blood flow before and after application of the beta 1-blocking substance metoprolol.", 
    "2": "We investigated the influence of an intoxication with sparteine (10 mg/kg X min i.v.) on heart rate, arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance in anesthetized rats. The leading feature of the cardiovascular activity of sparteine in rats was a strong bradycardia whereas blood pressure, cardiac output and peripheral resistance only slightly decreased and stroke volume even increased. The death of the rats occurred with a sudden stop of the QRS complexes in the ECG and an abrupt fall of blood pressure. Isoprenaline, orciprenaline, dopamine and prenalterol were compared with respect to their efficacy in reversing sparteine-induced toxicity in rats. Prenalterol proved to be the best antidote on account of its specific action on adrenergic beta 1-receptors. This result was affirmed in two experiments in pigs. Isoprenaline may also be used as an antidote for sparteine but decreases the blood pressure. Vasoconstrictors like dopamine should only be used in sparteine intoxication when a severe fall of blood pressure occurs which can not be overcome by prenalterol or isoprenaline.", 
    "3": "1. The dose-response relationship and duration of action of 3'-acetyl-4'-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropyl)-butyranilide (acebutolol, Prent) were determined under double-blind conditions in 9 volunteers using heart rate at rest and during exercise as a test parameter. 2. The effect of 200 mg of acebutolol on ischemic ST-segment depression, heart rate, and blood pressure was investigated in 10 patients with coronary heart disease. 3. Heart rate at rest and while standing was most markedly reduced in the volunteers 3 h following ingestion of acebutolol 300 mg. 100 and 300 mg lowered heart rate during exercise by 9.9 and 18.9%, respectively. No significant additional effect was achieved by increasing the dosage to 500 mg. 4. 24 h after single oral doses of 300 and 500 mg of acebutolol, nearly 50% of the substance's activity was still evident. 5. In patients with coronary heart disease, maximum heart rate during exercise 3 h after oral intake of 200 mg declined by 13%. The heart rate sum during ergometry fell by 11.2%. Systolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise also was lower. 6. A single oral dose of 100-300 mg of acebutolol consistently reduces heart rate during exercise as well as exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Since the drug remains active over a 24-h period, administration once daily should provide an adequate therapeutic effect in many patients.", 
    "4": "Five experiments were carried out on the control of melatonin levels in the pineal gland of a diurnal species, the Eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus). We confirmed that the exposure of chipmunks of fluorescent white light of 3,981-4,304 lux during the normal dark period does not prevent the rise in pineal melatonin levels normally associated with darkness. Also, the administration of propranolol (20 mg/kg) at 8 p.m. did not block the rise in pineal melatonin in animals exposed to either dark or light at night. Similarly, if chipmunks received propranolol 4 hours into the dark phase, pineal melatonin levels were not depressed 2 hours later. When animals were superior cervical ganglionectomized, however, the pineal content of melatonin remained low regardless of whether animals were exposed to darkness or light at night. The exposure of chipmunks acutely to light at midnight (4 hours after darkness onset) had only a slight depressive effect on pineal melatonin 30 min later; by comparison, when chipmunks were acutely exposed to light at 3 a.m. (7 hours after darkness onset) daytime pineal melatonin levels were reached within 15 min after light onset. These findings in a diurnal species, The Eastern chipmunk, differ markedly when compared to previously reported observations on nocturnal laboratory rodents.", 
    "5": "Changes in adrenoceptor and serotonin receptor activities, and platelet serotonin uptake, in a group of moderately depressed patients before and during treatment have been monitored. alpha 2 and beta-adrenoceptor densities on platelets and lymphocytes were markedly higher before treatment commenced and decreased to approximately control values following clinical response to drug treatment; patients not responding to such treatment failed to show any attenuation of the receptor hypersensitivity. Responders and non-responders showed differing receptor affinity for the ligands at the conclusion of the treatment period. Platelet serotonin receptor activity and uptake were lower before the start of treatment than in those patients who responded to therapy. There was no difference between plasma free and bound tryptophan concentrations of patients and controls, either before or during treatment. The observed changes in receptor function may correlate with changes in the clinical status of depressed patients.", 
    "6": "We used the open-chest, anesthetized dog to investigate the possible influence of blood PCO2 on alpha-adrenergic constriction (ansa subclavia stimulation) of previously dilated (adenosine infusion into the left anterior descendens LAD) coronary vessels. During hypercapnia, LAD flow was increased to a significantly greater degree by adenosine than during normocapnia. Adenosine infusion during hypocapnia was least effective in dilating the coronary vasculature. Ansa stimulation at the peak of the adenosine response attenuated LAD flow by 7 and 33 percent respectively during hypo- and hypercapnia. Although there was a significant effect of PCO2 on the vascular response to adenosine, the ability of the adrenergic nerves to attenuate this response in the presence of an altered PCO2 seemed to relate to this pre-existing level of coronary tone.", 
    "7": "Exposure in vitro of various mammalian retroviruses to the chelating agents EDTA or EGTA in millimolar concentrations resulted in partial disintegration of viral membranes as measured by accessibility or even release of reverse transcriptase, an internal viral protein, without any other treatment usually required. Among the viruses responding to chelators were mammalian type C viruses, primate type D viruses and bovine leukemia virus. The effect was dose-dependent. The avian type C virus AMV, however, was found to be not susceptible to the agents. Rauscher mouse leukemia virus treated in vitro with EDTA or EGTA showed reduced infectivity in mice. The results are considered as evidence for some association of divalent cations with membranes of mammalian retroviruses. The disintegrating activity of EGTA suggests that Ca2+ is an integral constituent of viruses but Mg2+ may also be involved. These cations seem to be responsible for maintaining integrity of retroviral membranes which, after chelation of ions, are either disrupted or become permeable for the exogenous template of reverse transcriptase. In addition, the disintegrating activity of trifluoperazine may indicate that a calmodulin-like protein occurs in retroviral membranes.", 
    "8": "A dual action of the adrenergic system on the release of LH has been demonstrated: facilitation mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors and inhibition mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. These two actions can be dissociated either by treatment with agents which block-specific adrenergic receptors or by cuts placed just in front of the mammillary bodies (PM cuts) interrupting caudal afferents to the medial basal hypothalamus. These cuts affected the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) in a way similar to that of treatment with the beta-adrenoblocker, propranolol. Thus, in animals with PM cuts (1) the release of LH following the injection of norepinephrine into the third ventricle was enhanced and (2) the blocking action of intraventricular injection of isoproterenol on the release of LH was suppressed whereas the facilitatory effect of clonidine was not changed. Furthermore, whereas the release of LH induced by intraventricular injection of norepinephrine in intact rats was enhanced by treatment with propranolol, in rats with PM cuts the already enhanced induced release was no further raised by propranolol treatment. On the other hand, PM cuts did not affect the suppressive action of the alpha-adrenoblocker phenoxybenzamine on the norepinephrine-induced release of LH. It is concluded that adrenergic mechanisms inhibiting the release of LH were suppressed by PM cuts whereas those facilitating the release were not affected by these cuts.", 
    "9": "Rats were trained by treadmill running after chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxy-dopamine or during chronic beta receptor blockade. Contrary to untreated trained animals, sympathectomized rats did not get a reduction of the intrinsic heart rate after training despite an increased heart weight. In contrast, no cardiac hypertrophy occurred after training during beta adrenergic blockade but the heart rate during exercise was reduced in these animals. It is concluded that the training-induced bradycardia contains a lowering of the intrinsic heart rate and that this is not dependent on the stimulation of cardiac beta receptors or the magnitude of heart rate increase during exercise. The results also indicate that there is not a causal relationship between the training-induced bradycardia and cardiac hypertrophy. The latter conclusion is supported by an echocardiographic study in humans where no correlation was found between IHR and cardiac dimensions.", 
    "10": "Intraluminal injections of lectins, including concanavalin A (Con A), wheatgerm lectin, and soybean lectin, Con A-Sepharose 4B beads, calcium ionophore A23187 or peanut oil into the left uterine horns of mice on day 4 of pseudopregnancy induced the formation of deciduomata and significantly increased the weight and alkaline phosphatase activity of uterine tissue on day 7 of pseudopregnancy. In contrast, injections of these materials into the uterine horns of non-pseudopregnant mice that had not been previously mated failed to induce similar responses. Tranylcypromine blocked the decidual cell reaction artificially induced by lectins, calcium ionophore A23187 and peanut oil in pseudopregnant mice. However, uterine responses observed after individual and concurrent injections with indomethacin, iproniazid, propranolol or progesterone indicated that this deciduoma-blocking effect may not be solely related to the ability of tranylcypromine to inhibit prostacyclin biosynthesis but may also involve catecholamines and luteolytic prostaglandins which interfere with decidualization on day 4 and day 6 of pseudopregnancy, respectively. A role for prostaglandins and uterine beta-adrenergic receptors, however, was implicated in the induction of decidualization because both indomethacin and propranolol blocked the response to peanut oil. The results suggested that the embryonic signal responsible for the induction of the decidual cell reaction in mice may involve surface interactions between the embryo and uterine luminal epithelium resulting in a stimulation of the uterus via glycoprotein receptors. A role for calcium was implicated in this phenomenon.", 
    "11": "Cardiac membrane preparations from developing spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (0 to 125 days of age) were analyzed for the apparent numbers of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activities in an attempt to correlate biochemical changes with the reported functional changes occurring with the development of hypertension in the SHR. Although the apparent number of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors were similar in both strains of rats, isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in the prehypertensive SHRs when compared to WKY rats and declined to lower values as hypertension appeared. The percent stimulation produced by isoproterenol remained similar in cardiac membranes from normotensive WKY rats at all ages of development whereas this percent stimulation was 40% higher at birth in the SHRs and declined to approximately one half the original value by 100 days of age (P less than 0.05). The elevated adenylate cyclase activity observed during the prehypertensive state may contribute to the genesis of hypertension.", 
    "12": "1. A method is described for efficient and rapid isolation of viable hepatocyte suspensions from chick embryos in the last few days of incubation. 2. Although qualitatively similar, quantitative differences exist in the hormonal control of glycogen metabolism between embryonic and hatched chicks. 3. Glucagon and adrenaline activate glycogenolysis. 4. Insulin did not inhibit basal or glucagon-stimulated glycogenolysis. 5. Phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenergic agonist), angiotensin and vasopressin, all of which activate glycogen breakdown in rat liver through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, were without effect on chick embryo hepatocytes.", 
    "13": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was estimated from measurements of internal carotid blood flow and sagittal sinus blood flow in mechanically ventilated rabbits under 70% N2O-30% O2. Intravenously administered physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, increased CBF under normocapnia and enhanced the cerebral vasodilatation of hypercapnia, but did not alter the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). The cerebrovascular effects of physostigmine were antagonized by atropine but not by dihydro-beta-erythroidine, a nicotinic blocker. Neostigmine, a quaternary cholinesterase inhibitor that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, showed no cerebrovascular effects. It is concluded that the cholinergic cerebral vasodilatation does not depend on cerebral metabolic activation, and that the cholinergic receptors involved are muscarinic and located beyond the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "14": "After 3 weeks of placebo administration, thirty-two mildly or moderately hypertensive patients were treated with hydrochlorothiazide (HCZ) for 3 weeks, then with HCZ plus nadolol, a new beta-adrenergic blocker, for 2 years. The dose of HCZ was 50 mg once daily for all except two patients, who received 50 mg twice a day. The dose of nadolol ranged from 40 mg to 240 mg, once daily. The average supine blood pressure decreased from 182/110 mm Hg at the end of the placebo period to 170/104 mm Hg at the end of treatment with HCZ alone. Nadolol was added to the regimen, and the average supine blood pressure decreased further to 132/88 mm Hg at the end of 3 months of combined therapy. It remained essentially unchanged for the duration of the 2-year study, and no increases in the dosage of either drug were needed. Side-effects were mild, and none required a change in dosage. A once-daily dose of nadolol combined with HCZ appears to be safe and effective therapy for the long-term treatment of mild or moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "15": "A fixed combination of metoprolol slow-release 200 mg and chlorthalidone 25 mg was given once daily over a 3 months period in forty out-patients with mild-to-moderate arterial hypertension stage I or II WHO. The combination elicited a clear-cut antihypertensive effect lasting at least 24 hours after drug. As compared with pre-treatment values, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were gradually reduced within the first month of treatment, remaining nearly constant in the following 2 months. Treatment was well tolerated by all patients. Neither serum potassium nor any other laboratory test (creative, glucose, uric acid, etc) showed significant changes. In conclusion, slow-release metoprolol fixed association with chlorthalidone provides a safe and effective treatment of arterial hypertension even on a long-term basis. The once daily dosing schedule may considerably improve patient's compliance.", 
    "16": "Coronary arterial spasm has been postulated to be a cause of myocardial ischemia for over 100 years. It was not until the work of Prinzmetal et al in 1959, however, that major clinical attention and research began to be addressed to the role of vasospasm in the manifestations of ischemic heart disease. It is now known that spasm may be clinically important in patients with significant underlying atherosclerotic coronary artery disease as well as in patients with anatomically normal or subcritically stenosed coronary vessels. Research has suggested that spasm may be associated with symptoms of stable resting and/or exertional angina pectoris and that it almost certainly plays a role in the pathogenesis of unstable angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction. Symptomatic arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia, heart block, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, have been documented to complicate coronary vasospasm. Given the potential importance of coronary arterial spasm in so many different ischemic heart disease syndromes, the development of therapeutic agents that may prevent spasm has obvious clinical importance.", 
    "17": "The authors studied the effect of drugs with different mechanisms of action on the prevention of stress ulcer production in the rat. Stress ulcer was induced by a method developed by the authors: intact, starved rats were swum in water at 23 degrees C for 5 hours. Atropine (0.1-0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg i.m.), cimetidine (1.0-5.0 and 25 mg/kg i.p.), prostacyclin (PGI2) (5.0-25.0 and 100 micrograms/kg i.p.) and phentolamine (0.35-1.75-3.5 and 7.0 mg/kg i.m.) were shown to decrease the production of stress ulcers significantly, in a dose-dependent fashion. Propranolol (0.35-1.75-3.5 and 7.0 mg/kg i.m.) did not influence the production of stress ulcers. The finding that drugs with different actions could considerably reduce or prevent the production of stress ulcer appears to indicate the complexity of the neural, hormonal and biochemical processes involved in the pathogenesis. On the basis of the present results the authors suggest the use of a preventive therapeutic regimen in clinical practice with an appropriate combination of drugs.", 
    "18": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) and systolic time intervals (STI), including total electromechanical systole (QS2), left ventricular ejection time (LVET), pre-ejection period (PEP) and isovolumetric contraction time (ICT), were measured in patients with borderline hypertension (n = 23) before and after oral treatment with atenolol and propranolol. Both beta blockers caused a similar fall in blood pressure and heart rate (P less than 0.001). QS2, PEPc and PEP/LVET values did not change after treatment. Propranolol prolonged ICT (p less than 0.001) and reduced LVET (p less than 0.001). No significant changes were detected in PRA after atenolol while a reduction was found after treatment with propranolol (p less than 0.001). No relationship was found between PRA and STI, however a linear correlation was recorded between systolic pressure and PRA (r = 0,91; p less than 0.01) before beta-blockade. These results suggest that: a) only beta 2-adrenoceptors are involved in the release of renin; and b) the effect of beta-blockers on STI follows a reduction of blood pressure and heart rate which in turn affect afterload.", 
    "19": "In normal human pregnancy there is considerable expansion of both plasma volume and total extracellular fluid volume, together with marked diminution of vascular reactivity in response to intravenous infusion of vasopressor agents. Pregnancy-associated hypertension (pre-eclampsia) is characterised by increased vascular reactivity, vasoconstriction and a fall in plasma volume associated with a shift of fluid from intravascular to interstitial fluid space. Direct expansion of plasma volume in patients with pregnancy-associated hypertension leads to partial correction of the abnormalities of volume homeostasis together with a significant fall in blood pressure. Certain forms of antihypertensive therapy also lead to reversal of volume contraction and improvement in cardiac function. This is associated with lowered vascular resistance and improved placental function, leading to improved pregnancy outcome. Although these observations do not elucidate the ultimate cause/causes of pregnancy-associated hypertension, they help to unravel the pathologic mechanisms by which the syndrome causes its effects and to suggest rational paths by which therapeutic endeavours may be expected to benefit mother and fetus.", 
    "20": "Plasma catecholamines and cardiovascular responses to acute insulin i.v. injection (0.12 U.I. per Kg of body weight) have been studied in eight patients with mild essential hypertension. The hypoglycaemia test was carried out before and after a week of atenolol treatment. In six patients the test was also repeated after propranolol treatment. Following insulin injection, blood sugar fell abruptly with a nadir at 30 m, diastolic blood pressure decreased, and systolic blood pressure and heart rate rose significantly. Atenolol treatment abolished almost completely these hemodynamic changes. By contrast, propranolol caused an increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, leaving the heart rate unmodified. During hypoglycaemia, plasma adrenaline rose sharply in coincidence with the glycaemic nadir and declined thereafter during the glycaemic recovery. Plasma noradrenaline rose less markedly than adrenaline, but the increments were significant after 30 and 60 m. Neither atenolol, nor propranolol affected significantly these changes in plasma catecholamine concentration. These data indicate that beta-blockers do not alter the hypoglycaemia-induced adrenomedullary release of catecholamines. We conclude therefore that beta-blockers modify the pattern of the hemodynamic response to acute hypoglycaemia by interfering with the peripheral effects of circulating catecholamines in a way which depends on the degree of beta-1 selectivity of the drug used.", 
    "21": "48 essential hypertensives were randomly assigned to (1) a behavioral treatment (n = 20), (2) a pharmacological treatment (n = 20), or (3) self recordings of BP (n = 8). Group 1 and 2 showed during 1 year of therapy comparable significant decreases of systolic and diastolic BP, whilst group 3 showed significant increases after 3 months of therapy.", 
    "22": "Rats were immunized with sheep erythrocytes, and 4 days in succession were stressed by restraint for 3 hours/day, or injected with dextro-amphetamine (7.5 mg/kg/day) or propranolol (0.1 mg/kg/day), or both stressed and treated with one of the drugs. Hemolytic plaque-forming cells (PFC) were counted in the spleens on the 5th day. Stress caused marginal suppression of the PFC response. The suppression was considerably potentiated by amphetamine and negligibly so by propranolol. Effect of the drugs has been discussed in view of altered corticosterone secretion.", 
    "23": "The specific physiological roles of ALDH have not been determined. In this overview, we have identified malondialdehyde as one potential endogenous toxic aldehyde that is oxidized by ALDH. Undoubtedly, there are other cytotoxic aldehydes which occur in several different tissues that are detoxified by this same system of enzymes. Intuitively, the role of aldehyde dehydrogenases in the detoxification of xenobiotic aldehydes should also receive additional consideration and attention. An interesting feature of specific studies described in this overview is that a single aldehydic substrate, like malondialdehyde, may be a substrate for one ALDH isozyme and a potent inhibitor of ALDH present in another cellular compartment. Assuming that the ALDH susceptible to this inhibition performs other important physiological or biochemical functions, a potentiating effect would occur. Thus, the efficient metabolism of potentially cytotoxic aldehydes may be a protective mechanism against a number of different organ system pathologies. Another striking feature of ALDH is its sensitivity to in vitro and in vivo inhibition by a number of chemically and pharmacologically diverse agents. This characteristic suggests that ALDH may be a target enzyme for inhibition by several therapeutically important drugs or their metabolites. As a result, the perturbation of ALDH by specific therapeutic agents suggests a potential role of this enzyme in a number of different drug-induced toxicities.", 
    "24": "Betaxolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, which has a bioavailability of 90% and a T 1/2 of 20 h. A four group, cross-over double-blind trial was conducted to select between betaxolol 20 mg and 40 mg for long term trials. 60 patients were allocated randomly to one of the sequences placebo-20 mg, 20 mg-placebo, placebo-40 mg and 40 mg-placebo, each treatment lasting for 2 weeks. Groups were homogenous for baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP), age and male/female ratio, and were slightly unbalanced for weight. A two-way ANOVA (3 treatments, 2 sequences) showed no treatment-sequence interaction nor sequence effect. The mean reduction in DBP was 14.2 +/- 1.8 mm Hg following 20 mg and 18.0 +/- 1.8 following 40 mg betaxolol, and 4.0 +/- 1.2 mm Hg during placebo (p less than 0.001). Age, weight, baseline DBP and duration of hypertension did not influence the treatment effect. The 95% confidence intervals of the reduction in DBP were 10.4 - 17.9 for 20 mg and 14.3 - 21.6 mm Hg for betaxolol 40 mg. Aiming at a mean reduction to 90 mm Hg, betaxolol 20 mg would appear to be adequate in similar patient populations.", 
    "25": "Prazosin was compared with hydralazine in 39 patients (mean age 49 years), who were already on beta-blockade for arterial hypertension. They all had a resting DBP greater than 100 mm Hg on propranolol 80 mg b i d. They were randomly allocated to prazosin or hydralazine treatment. Blood pressure was measured after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. We noted a significant fall in blood pressure in both groups, in most cases to normotensive levels. Side-effects and other variables of interest are discussed. Together with beta blockade, i e propranolol, both prazosin and hydralazine give good blood-pressure control and no important differences could be found.", 
    "26": "Thirty-two patients with primary hypertension were studied in a double-blind cross-over comparison between the cardioselective beta 1-blocking agent atenolol and the combined alpha- and beta-blocking agent labetalol. The doses used were atenolol 50--150 mg twice daily and labetalol 200--600 mg twice daily. Both drugs effectively reduced blood pressure and heart rate. Dose increments every second week resulted in a higher proportion of patients with normal blood pressure (les than or equal to 150/90 mm Hg) with both drugs. Labetalol was somewhat more effective in lowering upright blood pressure while atenolol caused a more pronounced heart-rate reduction. Both agents decreased plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone excretion. Scalp tingling on labetalol (2 patients) and cold fingers with atenolol (1 patient) caused withdrawal of the drugs. Cold fingers were reported in another four patients during treatment with atenolol and in one when on labetalol. Tiredness and postural symptoms were more common during intake of labetalol.", 
    "27": "beta-Adrenoceptor blocking drugs are generally recognized as being effective in the treatment of hypertension. The mechanisms whereby these drugs reduce blood pressure are, however, not fully understood. In a double-blind, randomized study either metoprolol, 100--300 mg/day, or pindolol, 5--15 mg/day, was given for 6 months and the effects on blood pressure, heart rate and vascular resistance in the calf and forearm were investigated. Measurements were made at rest, during and after physical exercise, and during postischaemic hyperaemia. Both drugs reduced blood pressure to the same extent both at rest and during and after exercise. Metoprolol reduced heart rate to a greater extent than pindolol at rest and after exercise, whereas no difference was seen during physical exercise. Pindolol reduced the vascular resistance in the calf at rest by 14% (p less than 0.05), whereas metoprolol tended to increase vascular resistance, the difference in effect being highly significant (p less than 0.005). During and after leg exercise, there was no difference in forearm vascular resistance between the two drugs. It may be concluded that pindolol reduced resting blood pressure partly through peripheral vasodilatation. This was probably an effect of beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation linked to the pronounced intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of pindolol. Metoprolol on the other hand, acted mainly through cardiac mechanisms, as suggested by its pronounced reduction of heart rate.", 
    "28": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured in 23 patients (pts.) affected by myocardial infarction (AMI), and in a control group of 4 normal subjects, during bed rest. A blood sample was drawn every 12 hours to determine PRA pattern curve during 5 days in Coronary Care Unit. The initial PRA was in the normal range in all pts., but it rose subsequently. The highest level was reached on the 4th day. The mean value of PRA at this time was significantly higher than the initial one (p less than 0.01). Such increasing PRA was not correlated with age, sex, infarction site, infarction dimension, pain, blood pressure, arrhythmias, bed rest. At variance with the experience of others, we were not able to show a significant correlation between PRA and plasma K+ levels. Diuretic and/or beta-blocker agents too, did not influence this increase of PRA in AMI. Our results are compared with those previously reported in the literature and the possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed.", 
    "29": "The effects of single oral doses of alinidine 40 mg, propranolol 40 mg or placebo during a maximal exercise test on a bicycle ergometer in patients with angina pectoris were studied in a randomised, double blind study. 2 and 5 h after drug intake a small fall in resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure was observed both after alinidine and propranolol. At a fixed work load both drugs decreased heart rate, systolic blood pressure, double product and the extent of ST segment depression. Total work performed and time to appearance of angina pectoris were increased 2 h alinidine and propranolol. The same effects were still apparent 5 h after propranolol but not after alinidine. At peak exercise neither drug had any effect on the extent of ischaemic ST segment depression.", 
    "30": "The effect of an acute intravenous and repeated oral doses of propranolol on haemodynamics, plasma and urinary catecholamines and plasma renin activity was studied in patients with essential hypertension. Intravenous injection of propranolol 5 mg produced a fall in cardiac output but had no consistent effect on blood pressure. Treatment with oral propranolol for 24 weeks lowered cardiac output and blood pressure; total peripheral resistance did not differ from the pretreatment values. Neither acute intravenous nor chronic oral administration of the beta-blocker affected the resting plasma levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline. Long-term treatment with propranolol reduced urinary excretion of vanilmandelic acid without affecting urinary catecholamine excretion. Acute intravenous injection of propranolol decreased plasma renin activity less than did chronic oral treatment with the drug. The observed time course of plasma renin activity was compatible with the view that suppression of this enzyme contributed to the antihypertensive effect of propranolol.", 
    "31": "A double-blind crossover trial was undertaken to compare the efficacy of sustained-release clonidine and long-acting propranolol in the treatment of 20 patients (8 males and 12 females) with sustained hypertension. Each patient was stabilized with metoprolol with or without diuretic therapy prior to admission to the trial. Long-acting propranolol in a once daily dosage of 160 mg proved to be effective over a 6-week period of treatment with no significant side-effects. Sustained-release clonidine in a single daily dosage of 0.25 mg was also effective over a similar period, but side-effects were more common. Although none were serious, they were sufficiently troublesome to result in 5 patients withdrawing from the trial. Despite this, sustained-release clonidine was considered a suitable drug for the treatment of hypertensive patients in whom beta-blockade is unsuitable.", 
    "32": "An open study was carried out in 641 patients with mild to moderate hypertension seen in general practice to assess the effectiveness of treatment with a timolol/hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride preparation compared with cyclopenthiazide/potassium. The timolol/hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride preparation produced better control of blood pressure in a larger percentage of patients after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment than did the diuretic/potassium preparation, and more patients were maintained on 1 tablet per day. Both treatments reduced the number of symptoms complained of by the patients at the initial visit.", 
    "33": "In a multicentre, double-blind (DB), within-patient study, the antihypertensive effectiveness and tolerability of two oral administration schedules of metoprolol (M) 100 mg b.i.d. versus 200 mg once daily (o.d.), were investigated in 103 outpatients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The study lasted 14 weeks and was divided into 3 periods: a) a weeks of single-blind (SB) placebo wash-out; b) 4 weeks of SB administration of M 100 mg b.i.d.; at the end of the second week of this period, chlorthalidone (C) 25 mg was added in patients with a recumbent diastolic blood pressure (BP) still greater than 95 mmHg and was continued throughout the following period; and c) DB cross-over administration of M 200 mg/d for 4 weeks on a b.i.d. schedule and 4 weeks on a once daily schedule. In comparison with pretreatment values, heart rate and systolic and diastolic BP were reduced (p less than 0.001) by both M administration schedules; there was no differences between the once and twice daily treatment regimens. During M once daily, betablockade was still maintained over 24 hours or longer, as the heart rate remained significantly lower than the basal value. In 57 patients, C was added at the end of the second week of SB M administration, and a further decrease in BP was observed; again, there was no significant change during once and twice daily M administration. Unwanted effects during M treatment were of minor severity, and the majority occurred when C, too, was added.", 
    "34": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the haemodynamic and ventilatory effects of two beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blockers and their interaction with the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline was carried out in eight asthmatic patients. One hour after intake of placebo, metoprolol 100 mg or acebutolol 400 mg, increasing doses of terbutaline were infused. Before and one hour after ingestion of the medication and after each infusion of terbutaline, ventilatory and haemodynamic indices were measured. The two beta-blocking agents caused equal changes in basal ventilatory and haemodynamic indices. Terbutaline infusion caused a dose dependent increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), both during placebo and beta-blockade. Metoprolol did not affect the terbutaline-induced bronchodilatation. During acebutolol medication, however, the increase in FEV1 and PEFR induced by terbutaline was partly inhibited. Terbutaline infusion during placebo caused a dose-dependent increase in heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (BP), and a decrease in diastolic BP. During acebutolol medication, these haemodynamic effects of terbutaline were completely blocked, but during metoprolol medication terbutaline still caused small changes in the same direction as during placebo, presumably because the vasodilator action of terbutaline was not inhibited. A negative correlation was found between the plasma levels of acebutolol and its metabolite N-acetyl acebutolol at the end of the study and changes in FEV1 and PEFR induced by terbutaline during acebutolol therapy as compared with placebo. The ventilatory and haemodynamic findings suggest a lower degree of beta 1-selectivity after oral administration of acebutolol as compared to metoprolol.", 
    "35": "The behaviour of active (AR) and inactive (IR) renin was studied in 48 hypertensive patients (37 with uncomplicated essential hypertension and 11 with reno-vascular hypertension) treated with indomethacin alone or with AR stimulating (bumetanide, tienilic acid, captopril) and inhibiting (atenolol) drugs before and after indomethacin addition. In 10 pts indomethacin (50mg q.i.d./3 days) reduced (p less than 0.05) AR and to a lesser extent IR. In 6 pts bumetanide (1 mg) increased (p less than 0.05) only AR and this effect was abolished by indomethacin. In 6 pts tienilic acid (250 mg) increased (p less than 0.05) only AR and this action was unchanged by indomethacin. In 11 renovascular pts captopril (100mg) increased AR (p less than 0.01) and lesser IR and both these effects were uninfluenced by indomethacin. In 11 essential hypertensive pts captopril (25mg b.i.d./3 days) increased only AR (p less than 0.02), but after 1 year both AR and IR were increased (p less than 0.05) and these effects were abolished by indomethacin. In all the above reported protocols we did never find any inverse correlation between either AR and IR values or their induced changes. These data suggest that prostaglandins stimulate, even if not to a similar extent, both AR and IR and that drugs, which stimulate renin either through or independently of PGs, did not cause any apparent interconversion of plasma IR into AR. In 6 pts atenolol (100 mg daily/6 days) reduced AR (p less than 0.05) and tended to increase IR. Indomethacin addition further decreased AR and reduced IR (both p less than 0.05 vs atenolol alone): however the proportion (% of total) of IR was still reduced. These findings suggest that beta 1-adrenoreceptors blockade exerts a divergent effect on active and inactive renin and that this action is not influenced by PGs synthesis inhibition.", 
    "36": "The acute effects of oral administration of niludipine (Bay a 7168), a new dihydropyridine derivative Ca2+-antagonist, on blood pressure (BP), hemodynamics and plasma renin activity (PRA) were investigated in patients with essential hypertension (n = 28) and normotensive volunteers (n = 7). In the hypertensives, BP was acutely lowered by 20 mg of niludipine (from 163/94 to 141/83 nmHg at 2 h, n = 7), 40 mg (163/101 to 140/90), and 60 mg (173/106 to 135/85). Niludipine (60 mg) increased cardiac output (CO; 5.13 to 7.56 l/min), stroke volume (79.0 to 107 ml/beat), and decreased total peripheral resistance (22.3 to 13.6 mmHg/l/min). In the normotensives, BP was not appreciably affected by 60 mg (decrease from 112/73 to 110/68). Heart rate (HR) and PRA were not influenced by the drug in all subjects. Long-term trials were carried out on 21 hypertensives. BP was reduced by niludipine monotherapy (20 mg, 4 times a day) from 167/97 to 140/80 mmHg at the 4th week and remained stable during the entire treatment. Addition of propranolol (10 mg, 4 times a day) did not lower BP any further, but tended to reduce HR. By adding penfluzide (2.5 mg a day) to this regimen, systolic BP was further lowered. Tachycardia, bradycardia, edema, increase in PRA or tachyphylaxis were not observed during the trial. The results indicate that niludipine, either alone or combined with propranolol and penfluzide, is effective in the treatment of patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "37": "Beta-blockade is known to induce muscle fatigue and tendency to hypoglycaemia during prolonged exercise. In addition, beta-blocking agents influence the secretion of many hormones, which regulate glucose. We have investigated the effects of a beta 1-selective (metoprolol) and a non-selective (propranolol) beta-blocking agent on muscle glycogenolysis, blood glucose and lactate levels, plasma levels of free fatty acids and on secretion of insulin, growth hormone, glucagon and cortisol during physical exercise in a double blind cross-over study in seven healthy male volunteers. They participated in three bicycle ergometer tests each lasting for 30 minutes under treatment of placebo (C), metoprolol (M) or propranolol (P). A biopsy was obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle before and immediately after the exercise for muscle glycogen assay. The glycogen concentration after exercise tended to be lower in C than in M or P experiment. The blood glucose level decreased during P and at 30 min there was a significant difference between P and C. The blood lactate was significantly lower before exercise during P than C or M. The increase of blood lactate during exercise, however, was not inhibited by P. Both beta-blocking agents counteracted the increase of FFA during exercise. There was a marked increase of growth hormone secretion during beta-blockade. The secretion of glucagon and cortisol were slightly increased by P and M, but the plasma insulin level was not affected by beta-blockade.", 
    "38": "The effect of verapamil 120 mg t.d.s. was compared with propranolol 160 mg b.d. in the treatment of stable angina pectoris. Nineteen patients were studied in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, using patient diaries, exercise-testing and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Both drugs were given for 1 month. On average the number of attacks of angina was reduced equally by verapamil and propranolol. The degree of electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischaemia was decreased by the same amount, but verapamil was significantly more effective in prolonging the exercise time. Both drugs reduced the number of episodes of ST-segment depression during 24 hours of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, which was analyzed in nine patients. It is concluded that verapamil compares very favourably with propranolol in the treatment of stable angina, and is more beneficial in improving exercise capacity.", 
    "39": "This multicentre, open study was conducted in 263 hypertensive patients from six different countries by seventeen investigators. The results confirm the efficacy and safety of nadolol, used alone or in combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension, even in patients in whom previous antihypertensive therapy with other drugs was unsatisfactory. The study also demonstrated that nadolol can effectively replace a variety of other antihypertensive agents, and, because of once a day dosage, can enhance patient compliance and produce better therapeutic responses.", 
    "40": "The role of the renin-aldosterone axis in mediating responses to antihypertensive treatment was examined in patients with essential hypertension treated with propranolol (n=50) or chlorthalidone (n=50). Control plasma renin activity tended to be predictive of the response to treatment: it correlated with the diastolic blood pressure changes produced by both the renin-lowering agent, propranolol (r=-.43, P less than 0.001), and the diuretic, chlorthalidone (r= .48, P less than 0.001). However, when patients were divided into responders (fall in diastolic blood pressure of greater than 10%) and non-responders, the treatment-induced changes in aldosterone excretion rate appeared to be more important than the changes in renin in determining outcome. During propranolol there was no difference between the renin changes in the responders (n=21) and the non-responders (n=29), but aldosterone fell significantly more (P less than 0.025) in the responders than in the non-responders. Similarly, renin changes during chlorthalidone were not markedly different between the two groups, but the increase in aldosterone excretion in the non-responders was significantly greater (P less than 0.001) than in the responders (n=25). Thus, regardless of the treatment used, responders were characterized by having lower levels of aldosterone during therapy than non-responders. This possible role for aldosterone in influencing blood pressure changes was not related to clinically measurable effects on fluid and electrolyte balance; it has been conjectured that this pressor effect of aldosterone could reflect a direct action in the peripheral circulation.", 
    "41": "In order to determine the changes in potassium disposition with antirenin, antihypertensives during dynamic physical activity, a double-blind placebo controlled study was undertaken using normal volunteers receiving placebo or single and multiple dose clonidine, methyldopa and propranolol 0.2 mg. followed by 0.1 mg. bid x 7 days, 500 mg. followed by 250 mg. bid x 7 days or 80 mg. followed by 40 mg. bid x 7 days, respectively. Prior to study, 2 hours post dosing and coincident with immediate pre-exercise on treadmill, at graded increases of exercise and 2 hours post exercise (approximately 4 hours post dosing), blood was sampled for potassium, renin concentration, aldosterone and catecholamines. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were measured. The results demonstrate no greater increase in potassium over placebo with single or multiple dose clonidine or methyldopa. Following the initial dose of propranolol, 80 mg., there was a statistically greater rise in potassium over that seen with placebo but not observed with multiple dose. This may be related to the low multiple dose regimen. There were minor but significant changes in norepinephrine, renin and systolic pressure with multiple dose clonidine and methyldopa and in renin, heart rate and systolic and diastolic pressure with propranolol. Overall, the adrenergic responses, to exercise with methyldopa and propranolol are more biochemically altered than functionally impaired, yet the latter is related to dose and the underlying age and state of health of the group being studied.", 
    "42": "The long-term effects of angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) inhibition with Captopril on fluid and electrolyte metabolism, aldosterone secretion, renal function, and arterial pressure were evaluated in conscious sodium deficient dogs. Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), plasma renin activity (PRA), urinary sodium excretion (UNaV), arterial pressure (AP), renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood kinin concentration (BK), urinary kinin excretion (UK), and urinary kallikrein activity (UKA) were determined during long-term inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II). In response to Captopril administration (20 mg/kg/day) PAC decreased from 38.9 +/- 6.7 to 14.3 +/- 2.3 ng/dl, PRA increased from 3.58 +/- 0.53 to 13.7 +/- 1.6 ng/ml/hr, UNaV increased from 0.65 +/- 0.27 to 6.4 +/- 1.2 mEq/day, AP decreased from 102 +/- 3 to 65 +/- 2 mmHg, RBF increased from 136 +/- 7 to 156 +/- 8 ml/min, GFR decreased from 65 +/- 8 to 36 +/- 7 ml/min, BK increased from 0.17 +/- 0.02 to 0.41 +/- 0.04 ng/ml, UK increased from 7.2 +/- 1.5 to 31.4 +/- 3.2 micrograms/day, and UKA decreased from 23.6 +/- 3.1 to 5.3 +/- 1.2 E.U./day. Aldosterone infusion in sodium deficient dogs maintained on Captopril failed to alter urinary sodium excretion, renal function, or arterial blood pressure. However, angiotensin II infusion (3 ng/kg/min) restored aldosterone secretion, renal function, and arterial blood pressure within three days to levels observed in untreated sodium deficient dogs. The marked alterations in renal function and urinary sodium excretion during angiotensin II infusion indicate that angiotensin II is several times more potent than aldosterone in the long-term control of sodium excretion. Also, our studies demonstrated that the long-term hypotensive and natriuretic actions of inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) are mediated by inhibition of angiotensin II formation.", 
    "43": "1 Fifty-seven patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, mean age 50 (range 31-69) were randomised to treatment with either captopril or atenolol. Twenty-six patients in each group completed the study. 2 Captopril (25-50 mg three times daily) and atenolol (50-100 mg once daily) caused a highly significant fall in blood pressure both supine and standing. 3 When hydrochlorothiazide (25-50 mg once daily) was added a further fall in blood pressure was observed in both groups. 4 Captopril as single drug caused no significant change in heart rate, while atenolol significantly reduced heart rate both supine and standing. 5 Two patients were excluded from the captopril group, one because of a reversible loss of taste and the other because of dizziness. Three patients were excluded from the atenolol group, two because of bradyarrhythmias and one because of inadequate blood pressure response. 6 Both captopril and atenolol were found to be effective antihypertensive agents, suitable for the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "44": "An open, randomized crossover study was carried out in 8 patients with accelerated hypertension to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of oxprenolol with that of propranolol. Dosage was titrated for each patient to achieve normotensive levels and was in the range of 40 to 320 mg twice daily. The same mg dosage was maintained for the alternative drug after crossover at 32 weeks for the second treatment period. The results showed that both drugs had equivalent antihypertensive effect on the erect systolic and diastolic and supine systolic blood pressures. Oxprenolol, however, produced a significantly greater reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure than did propranolol. There were no significant changes in heart rate or any of the other clinical or laboratory parameters monitored during either treatment, and side-effects were remarkably infrequent.", 
    "45": "The effects of metoprolol and/or nifedipine on blood pressure were studied in 12 hypertensive males at rest and during standardized exercise on an ergometer bicycle. Metoprolol (100 mg X 2) and nifedipine (10 mg X 3) gave similar blood pressure reductions both at rest and during exercise. When the drugs were combined, the antihypertensive effect was potentiated. The PQ interval was not affected during any treatment period. No adverse reactions to the combined treatment were noted. The combination of a calcium blocker with vasodilating properties with a beta-blocker, which reduces cardiac output, thus seems a logical and promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "46": "Atenolol is a hydrophilic betareceptor blocking drug, which is predominantly eliminated via the kidneys, only about 5% of the atenolol is metabolised by the liver. After oral administration atenolol is incompletely absorbed from the intestine, so about 50% of the beta blocker are finally biovailable. In plasma only 3% of atenolol are protein-bound. There exists a linear relationship between the atenolol plasma levels and the degree of beta blocking effect measured by inhibition of the exercise-induced tachycardia. No correlation was found between plasma levels of atenolol and blood pressure lowering activity of the drug. After oral administration elimination half life of atenolol is calculated from 6 to 9 h by different authors. In patients with impaired renal function elimination half life of atenolol gradually increases to values of 36 h in uraemic patients (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 10 ml/min). Between GFR and atenolol plasma clearance as well as renal clearance a close significant correlation is described. Prolongation of elimination half life requires a dosage adjustment of atenolol in patients with renal failure. A marked interaction of atenolol is found when calcium or aluminium hydroxide are concurrently administered with the beta blocker whereas cimetidine does not influence atenolol kinetics.", 
    "47": "1. Recent evidence suggests that mild hypertensives benefit from antihypertensive drug treatment. 2. The variable course of mild hypertension suggests that drug treatment is best reserved for patients whose blood pressures do not fall in repeated observation. 3. The possibility that thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs may have adverse effects suggest that calcium channel blockers should be considered for the early treatment of mild hypertension.", 
    "48": "In the treatment of severe hypertension the choice of vasodilator is limited by side-effects, of which the lupus erythematosus syndrome induced by hydralazine is potentially the most serious, particularly in patients with the slow acetylator phenotype. This study describes the clinical evaluation of a new vasodilator, endralazine, which is related to hydralazine but which is not metabolised to any great extent by acetylation. In 6 essential hypertensives not adequately controlled by combined beta-blocker and diuretic therapy the additional administration of the first dose of 10 mg endralazine resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure, without orthostatic symptoms, but associated with significant increases in heart rate and plasma noradrenaline concentration. These 6 patients and a further 9 similar hypertensive patients were then prescribed twice daily endralazine for 4 weeks with significant improvement in blood pressure control. During this short period of maintenance treatment with endralazine the single dose observations were repeated and no significant changes in heart rate or plasma noradrenaline concentration were observed. In summary, endralazine is an effective vasodilator/antihypertensive which was well tolerated in a triple therapy regimen in this study.", 
    "49": "Chronic administration of clonidine to six month old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) by continuous infusion with Alzet minipumps resulted in a decreased systolic arterial pressure, a decrease in heart weight, protein content and the incorporation of precursors of cellular protein and glycoprotein into the myocardium. Chronic administration of propranolol to SHR for three consecutive weeks by Alzet minipump reduced systolic arterial pressure but did not reverse the indices of myocardial hypertrophy. Chronic administration of propranolol to SHR for three consecutive weeks resulted in myocardial necrosis in each of the SHR tested. Because both clonidine and propranolol inhibit sympathetic activity to the myocardium, whereas propranolol also blocks myocardial beta receptors, the data support the conclusion that the ability of clonidine to reverse myocardial hypertrophy in the SHR cannot result from withdrawal of sympathetic tone to the myocardium. Moreover, since both drugs caused an equivalent reduction in pressure, the effects of clonidine cannot result from a decrease in afterload to the myocardium. The data support the conclusion that clonidine may reverse myocardial hypertrophy by a direct action on the myocardium or by inhibiting the synthesis or release of circulating or trophic factors which may mediate myocardial hypertrophy. Moreover, if propranolol-induced focal myocardial necrosis is found to occur in other species, caution should be utilized in the use of propranolol for the treatment of essential hypertension in man.", 
    "50": "The water soluble beta-adrenergic ligand [3H]CGP-12177 was used to measure the cell surface receptors in intact cells. In two cell lines, C6 glioma and WEHI 7 lymphoma cells, -50% of the cell surface receptors disappear within minutes of incubation of the cells with isoproterenol. The receptors can still be detected in homogenates and reappear on the cell surface when cells are washed and reincubated at 37 degrees C. The data agree with a disappearance of the receptors from the cell surface by an agonist-mediated endocytosis.", 
    "51": "A microelectrode study is performed of the postsynaptic potentials of single smooth-muscle cells from various regions of cat stomach. The smooth-muscle cells from the region of the fundus, the corpus along the small curvature, as well as from the middle region of the anterior wall, produce more frequently inhibitory responses to transmural electrical stimulation, while the cells of the cardia, of the corpus along the big curvature and the antrum respond predominantly by depolarization and contraction of the muscle strip (excitatory responses). Administration of atropine in doses of 10(-6) M blocks the excitatory postsynaptic potentials, which suggests that the majority of them are cholinergic. By adding adrenergic antagonists in a dose of 10(-6) M it is demonstrated that a part of the inhibitory responses are produced by nonadrenergic inhibitory nerve fibres. The differences in the nerve transmission of different stomach regions may be associated with the possibilities of exercising the reservoir or evacuative function of these regions.", 
    "52": "Isolated tissues from rat and guinea pig hearts were employed to investigate the relationship between the positive inotropic effects of isoproterenol and glucagon and the shortening of time to peak tension (TPT). The involvement of cAMP in the inotropic responses to histamine and isoproterenol and corresponding changes in TPT was also studied. On isoproterenol challenge, a correlation was found between the percent increase in tension and reduction in TPT. Histamine produced a positive inotropic response in both guinea pig left atria and papillary muscles; however, TPT was shortened only in the cAMP-associated response of the papillary muscle. In guinea pig left atria, isoproterenol in the absence and presence of D-600, RO-20-1724, or propranolol increased tissue levels of cAMP and decreased TPT such that a significant correlation was found between these two parameters. The significance of relationships among positive inotropic responses, tissue levels of cAMP, and TPT is discussed.", 
    "53": "This study, performed on pure muscular regulatory proteins and contracting myocytes in embryonal myocardial cultures, showed a direct interaction of the tropomyosin-troponin complex (TM-TN) with beta-adrenergic and Ca2+-channel-blocking agents. The TM-TN complex incorporates into the myocyte membranes as well as into artificial membranes, inducing changes in the X-ray diffraction picture. This protein complex prevents the inhibitory effect of D-600, propranolol, and other agents on the contraction of myocytes, restores the sensitivity of the cells to catecholamines, and promotes transmembrane transport of Ca2+ . beta-Adrenergic agents decrease the melting point and increase the intramolecular mobility of the TM-TN complex. They activate the Mg2+ ATPase of native but not desensitized actomyosin. In this case, they do not compete with Ca2+ for the same sites. The role of the direct interaction of cardioactive agents with the Ca2+-binding proteins in the membranes and other compartments of the cell is discussed in connection with their mechanism of action on the myocardium.", 
    "54": "A method for preservation of both morphological and enzymatic integrity was used to demonstrate localization of adenylate cyclase (AC) in rat myocardium. Short prefixation with a 2% glutaraldehyde solution and 5% DMSO followed by incubation in modified standard medium with 10 mM ouabain, 1 mM adenine deaminase, and 1 mM tetramisol with 10-20 mM NaF and 0.1-0.4 mM isoproterenol as activators and/or 1-100 propranolol as a beta blocker allowed regularly reproducible localization of fine granular precipitate of lead imidodiphosphate at the sites of adenylate cyclase activity. In addition to localization on the sarcolemma, the greatest precipitation was found inside the junctional sacroplasmic reticulum and subsarcolemma cisternae. Longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum was free of precipitate. Participation of Ca2+ ions in these areas, where calcium is usually present in high concentration, was excluded by electron probe X-ray microanalysis. The amount of precipitate was greatly enhanced after stimulation of AC with isoproterenol or NaF and was diminished by 30-min preincubation with 10-100 mM propranolol.", 
    "55": "The pharmacologist is interested in both the therapeutic effect of the drug and its mode of action. This latter is mainly studied in the isolated heart in vitro. However, in vitro experiments are not satisfactory to predict antiarrhythmic activity in vivo because: they are mostly performed in preparations made from the normal myocardium; in vitro the autonomic and hormonal effects are absent; some drugs such as nitroglycerine or strophanthin do not produce antiarrhythmic electrophysiological changes in vitro but under appropriate conditions may have a clear-cut antiarrhythmic action in vivo; and arrhythmias mostly arise from the interaction of changes in several fundamental electrophysiological parameters which could be best studied in vivo. These facts are demonstrated by the example of the pathomechanism and pharmacotherapy of early postinfarction arrhythmias. In spite of these shortcomings, there is, however, some promising development in this field. Progress is being made in the in vivo recording of electric events in the heart (multiple KCl suction electrodes, in vivo recording of Purkinje activity). Prolonged drug treatment can evoke electrophysiological changes in vitro characteristic of the action of the drug in vivo. In the donor-perfused isolated heart preparation, the drug administered to the donor animal will evoke responses in concentrations producing the in vivo effect, and the possibility of drug metabolism and binding to plasma proteins is also present.", 
    "56": "Transmembrane action potentials were recorded from isolated electrically paced cat and guinea pig left auricles in Tyrode solution and in the presence of 25 mM K+ or tetrodotoxin (TTX). The overshoot (OS) was increased, and the plateau of the action potential (AP) was shortened by epinephrine (5 X 10(-6)M) and by celluline-A (an organic calcium complex obtained from frog skin). The maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) was enhanced by serotonin (5-HT) (10(-6)M), prostaglandin F2 alpha (2.8 X 10(-6)M), and by celluline-A. After inactivation of the fast sodium channel by TTX (10(-5)M) or by partial depolarization (25 mM K+ Tyrode) of electrically driven cat and guinea pig left auricle, catecholamines (epinephrine and isoproterenol, 4 X 10(-7) to 5 X 10(-6)M), histamine (10(-6) to 10(-5)M), and celluline-A restored the electrical and mechanical activity. Prostaglandins (PGE1, PGF2 alpha, 1.4 X 10(-8)-2.8 X 10(-6)M), 5-HT (10(-6)-5 X 10(-6)M), and 4-aminopyridine (1.5 X 10(-4)M) were ineffective in such conditions. The beta-adrenergic blocking agent pindolol (4 X 10(-7)M) prevented only the effect of catecholamines; the H1 receptor blocker mepyramine (10(-5)M) antagonized only that of histamine, and D-600 (2 X 10(-6)M), a selective Ca channel blocker, prevented the restoring effect of catecholamines, histamine, and celluline-A.", 
    "57": "In anesthetized open-chest dogs, tachyarrhythmia (TA) was electrically induced by above-threshold stimuli via the right ventricle. During TA, a significant increase in the release of PGE and cAMP was observed in the canine coronary sinus blood (CSB). The efflux of cAMP corresponded with a concomitant increase in the left ventricular tissue level of this nucleotide. Pretreatment with propranolol (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) prevented the TA-induced changes in the level of PGE as well as cAMP in the CSB and in the tissue levels of cAMP. There was an increase in the activity of phosphorylase a in the myocardial tissue during TA which could be abolished by propranolol pretreatment. These results suggest possible interrelationships among catecholamines, cAMP, and PGE.", 
    "58": "The possible involvement of adrenergic receptors in nickel ion (Ni2+)-induced coronary vasoconstriction was studied on isolated perfused rat hearts and on isolated canine coronary artery strips. The experiments on both models showed that (i) alfa-adrenergic blockade by phenoxybenzamine or phentholamine caused only partial depression of Ni2+-induced coronary vasoconstriction: (ii) beta-adrenergic receptor blockade by propranolol totally prevented Ni2+-action, and (iii) Ni2+ (1 microM) caused significant inhibition of coronary vasodilatation induced by isoproterenol. The experimental results indicate that alfa-adrenoceptors play minor role (if any) in the coronary action mechanism of Ni2+ but it may be mediated by beta-adrenergic mechanisms. Nickel was found to alter the reactivity of coronary beta-adrenoceptors suggesting a possible modulatory role of this trace metal in coronary adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "59": "The cellular localization of the binding of radioactive noradrenaline and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was studied in organotypic cultures of rat cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord using autoradiography. In cerebellar cultures, many neurones, which appeared to be Purkinje cells, were labelled by [3H]noradrenaline and by the beta-antagonists [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]carazolol, whereas no binding of the alpha-antagonists [3H]prazosin and [3H]rauwolscine was detected. In cultures of spinal cord and brain stem, [3H]noradrenaline and the beta-antagonists were bound to many large neurones. Binding of [3H] alpha-antagonists was observed to a small number of brain stem and spinal neurones, the labelling being much weaker than that produced by the [3H] beta-antagonists. The antidepressant [3H]desmethylimipramine was bound to many neurones and glial cells in cerebellar, brain stem and spinal cord cultures. Glial cells also possessed binding sites for [3H]noradrenaline and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, findings that are consistent with recent electrophysiological observations which indicate the existence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors on cultured astrocytes.", 
    "60": "The action of adrenergic alpha- and beta-agonists and antagonists has been studied on the membrane potential and resistance of glial cells of cultured rat central nervous system. Noradrenaline and the alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating agents phenylephrine and clonidine (10(-7) to 10(-4)M) depolarized the glial membrane, whereas the beta-agonist isoprenaline caused a hyperpolarization at low concentrations (10(-7) and 10(-6)M). The effects of noradrenaline and phenylephrine were reversibly blocked by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine, whereas those of isoprenaline were antagonized by the beta-blocker atenolol. Atenolol did not affect the depolarization by noradrenaline. The glial depolarization induced by the alpha-agonists was not the consequence of a change in the extracellular K+-concentration unlike that produced by amino acid transmitters. The present results, together with those of biochemical and autoradiographic binding studies, suggest that alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors occur on glial cells and that the glial depolarization is mediated by alpha-receptors, whereas the hyperpolarization is due to activation of beta-receptors.", 
    "61": "The development of beta-adrenergic receptors in the rat visual cortex was examined and the density of beta-receptors and associated subtypes (beta 1 and beta 2) was compared between visual and non-visual or whole cortical tissues using radioreceptor assays employing [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol and [125I]iodocyanopindolol as ligands. Saturation assays revealed not only similar affinities of beta-receptors for [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol in visual cortical samples at 10, 24 and 160 days after birth but also practically identical saturation curves for visual and non-visual cortical samples at 160 days of age. Displacement of [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol with propranolol in visual cortical membranes at various postnatal ages showed a gradual increase in receptor density from day 4 to day 24 with no change thereafter. No significant differences were observed in the overall density of beta-receptors or in the distribution and density of beta 1 and beta 2-receptors between visual and non-visual or whole cortical samples; however, there was a definite decline in the density of beta-receptors in these samples between 40 and 160 days of age. The results indicate that the developmental pattern of beta-receptor density and the distribution of beta 1 and beta 2-receptors are similar between visual and whole cortical tissues. In addition, the results emphasize the importance of maintaining the dissociation constant at a fixed value when comparing receptor densities between experiments, and also show the utility of employing the high-affinity ligand, [125I]iodocyanopindolol, with a combination of serotoninergic, dopaminergic and alpha-adrenergic antagonists to examine beta-adrenergic receptors in a specific region of the brain. Study of beta-receptors in the visual cortex may be beneficial in elucidating the role of norepinephrine in this region.", 
    "62": "The acute blood pressure response to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was used to measure participation of the renin-angiotensin system in treatment-resistant hypertension. By 2 h after a single 25-mg oral captopril dose in patients still receiving a diuretic-vasodilator-beta-blocker combination, systolic and diastolic blood pressures had fallen significantly; the decrease in diastolic pressure correlated with the control (immediately pre-captopril) plasma renin activity (r = 0.64, p less than 0.001). Apart from its possible contribution to the underlying hypertension, this captopril-identified renin component may have reflected diuretic and vasodilator-induced renin stimulation that could not adequately be prevented by the renin-lowering properties of the beta-blocker. Captopril, and perhaps other specific antirenin drugs, therefore, may be valuable adjuncts to treatment in patients with hypertension refractory to conventional therapy.", 
    "63": "Electroconvulsive shock (ECS) reduces the number of rat cortical beta-adrenergic receptors. Lithium has been reported in several systems to prevent receptor changes induced by other agents. However, the present experiment reports that chronic lithium does not prevent the reduction in dihydroalprenolol binding induced by ten daily ECS treatments.", 
    "64": "The effects of biogenic amines on cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and on cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were studied in isolated glomeruli from dog kidneys. Of the agents tested, histamine produced the greatest increase in cyclic nucleotide activity. Isoproterenol, dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine also produced increases in cAMP and/or cGMP activity but of lesser magnitude. Propranolol decreased cyclic nucleotide levels. Glomeruli isolated from the outer cortex showed greater responses to stimulation than glomeruli from the inner cortex.", 
    "65": "Hepatocytes isolated from the livers of starved, sham-operated, bilaterally nephrectomised and ureter-ligated rats as well as rats with ischaemic acute renal failure were used for a comparative study of the effects of different hormones on gluconeogenesis. In all tested groups dibutyryl-3':5'-adenosine monophosphate inhibits glucose synthesis from pyruvate whereas this process is not affected by glucagon and only slightly activated by adrenalin. In contrast, gluconeogenesis from dihydroxyacetone was stimulated by all three hormones at the expense of the conversion of dihydroxyacetone to lactate. In the presence of l-serine adrenalin, glucagon and dibutyryl cAMP also stimulate glucose synthesis, which is more marked in bilaterally nephrectomised and ureter-ligated animals. In half of the experiments with bilaterally nephrectomised rats (group BN 2), lack of sensitivity of hepatocytes to all tested hormones on gluconeogenesis from serine or dihydroxyacetone was observed. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol reduced the stimulatory effect of adrenalin on glucose synthesis from serine and abolished the influence of catecholamines in the presence of dihydroxyacetone and pyruvate. This suggests that both alpha- and beta-receptors are involved in the activation of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Insulin and parathyroid hormone did not change the rate of glucose synthesis in any of the experimental groups.", 
    "66": "The beta-adrenergic receptors of the intact human lung diploid fibroblast line Wl-38 and an SV-40 transformed clone of Wl-38, Wl-38-VA-13-2RA (VA13), were estimated in experiments utilizing the beta-adrenergic ligand, 125l-hydroxybenzylpindolol (125IHYP). When specific 125IHYP binding was measured in cells grown to relatively low population densities (0.15x10(6)cells/35mm dish), both Wl-38 and VA13 cells had approximately 40,000 beta-adrenergic receptors per cell. Wl-38 cells, when cultured to a high population density (0.5x10(6) cells/35/mm dish) had clearly diminished numbers of beta-adrenergic receptors and greatly decreased cAMP responses to epinephrine stimulation. On the other hand, in VA13 cells, neither the receptor number nor the beta-adrenergic response was affected by cell population density. In Wl-38 cells, the diminished cAMP response to epinephrine paralleled the decrease in number of beta-adrenergic receptors. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) stimulation of cAMP levels was unaffected by cell population density in either Wl-38 or VA13 cells. Thus, increased cell population density, perhaps related to density dependent inhibition of growth, caused a specific diminution in 125IHYP binding concomitant with decreased cAMP responses to epinephrine."
