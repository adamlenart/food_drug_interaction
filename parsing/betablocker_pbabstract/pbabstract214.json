A special punch was fabricated and used while preparing an NBAS. Solubility of PH in phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.6), partition coefficient between phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 1-octanol, and permeability coefficient through the porcine buccal mucosa were performed and found to be 74.66 mg/mL, 5.17, and 5.6, respectively. Stability of NBAS was determined in natural human saliva, and it was found that both PH and device are stable in human saliva. NBAS was evaluated by weight uniformity, thickness, hardness, friability, swelling, mucoadhesive strength, in vitro drug release, and in vivo human acceptability studies. Swelling index was higher (4.4) for formulations containing hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) K4M alone, and it decreases with its decreasing concentration in the NBAS. Mucoadhesive strength (MS) was measured by using a modified apparatus. All NBASs showed higher MS with porcine buccal mucosa when compared with that of rabbit buccal mucosa. NBASs containing carbopol (CP) 934P and HPMC K4M at the ratio of 1:1 showed higher MS (44.76 g) with porcine buccal mucosa when compared with 1:2 (39.76 g), 0:1 (23.29 g), and 1:0 (22.22 g) ratios, respectively. The mechanism of PH release was found to be by non-Fickian diffusion (value of \"n\" between 0.5 and 1.0) and followed first order kinetics. In vivo human acceptability study showed that the newly prepared NBAS was comfortable in the human buccal cavity. It can be concluded that NBAS is a superior, novel system that overcomes the drawback associated with the conventional buccal adhesive tablet.", 
    "1": "The purpose of this research was to evaluate in vitro transnasal sustained-release ability of sorbitan monostearate (SMS) organogels in isopropyl myristate (IM). Organogels were prepared containing SMS (2.5%-20%) and water (5%-25%) in IM and analyzed microscopically for phase behavior. The effect of Tween surfactants on gel strength and in vitro nasal diffusion of propranolol is reported. The in vitro nasal release retardant effect of SMS and Tween 20 was investigated using factorial design. The microscopic changes in structure of organogel during in vitro nasal diffusion were studied. The water-holding capacity of SMS organogels in IM increased with SMS concentration. The release retardant effect with incorporation of cosurfactant was of the order of Tween 80 > Tween 60 > Tween 20. Gel strengthening and increased viscosity were evident with increased concentration of SMS and Tween 20. The 3-dimensional network of SMS molecules controls the diffusional drug release. The organogel system on nasal mucosa during diffusion is dynamic in nature and changes continuously with the time of diffusion. The water penetration in the organogel network results in percolation and emulsification of organogel, thus affecting the release. Organogels provided an effective barrier for diffusion of propranolol. The surface epithelium lining and the granular cellular structure of treated nasal mucosa were intact.",

The study found that patients having NQMI with initial ST segment depression, unlike those with initial ST segment elevation, were characterized by diffuse coronary atherosclerosis, evident diastolic dysfunction and left ventricle (LV) remodeling, progressing with the course of time. Early administration of aspirin, heparin and PP reduced LV remodeling, improved diastolic function and prognosis in patients having NQMI with initial ST segment depression.", 
    "3": "Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (THPP) is a rare complication of hyperthyroidism and an uncommon form of hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Its differentiation of more common forms of periodic paralysis is important because aggressive treatment can place the patient at risk for rebound hyperkalemia. Treatment of the underlying thyroid dysfunction cures the muscle symptoms. Here we describe a 37-year-old Turkish male with THPP whose paralysis attack recurred soon after administration of radioactive iodine.", 
    "4": "Whole cell patch recording was performed from morphologically identified cone-driven on-off bipolar cells (Cabs) in giant danio retinal slices to study their glutamate receptors and light-evoked responses. Specific agonists were puffed in the presence of cobalt, picrotoxin, and strychnine to identify glutamate receptors on these cells. Most Cabs responded to both the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)/kainate receptor agonist kainate and the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) substrate D-aspartate, and both responses were localized to the dendrites. Kainate generated depolarizations whereas D-aspartate had E(rev) close to E(Cl) and generated hyperpolarizations, indicating that the AMPA/kainate receptors are sign-preserving, whereas the EAATs are sign-inverting. In response to white light, some Cabs gave on bipolar cell-like responses whereas others gave off bipolar cell-like ones, but many cells' responses had both on and off bipolar cell components. In response to appropriately colored center-selective stimuli, many Cabs responded to short and long wavelengths with opposite polarities and were thus double color-opponent. The depolarizing components of the responses to white or colored stimuli were suppressed by the EAAT blocker DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA), whereas the hyperpolarizing components were reduced by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that both EAATs and AMPA/kainate receptors are involved in the generation of light-evoked responses in Cabs and that they confer these cells with on and off bipolar cell properties, respectively. Cabs can generate double color-opponent center responses by receiving inputs from certain cones through EAATs and from other cones through AMPA/kainate receptors.",

    "6": "The determinants of change in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) over time in patients with impaired LV function at baseline have not been clearly established. Using a nuclear database to assess changes in LV function over time, we included patients with a baseline LVEF of 25% to 40% on a gated single-photon emission computed tomographic study at rest and only if second-gated photon emission computed tomography performed approximately 18 months after the initial study showed an improvement in LVEF at rest of > or =10 points or a decrease in LVEF at rest of > or =7 points. In all, 148 patients qualified for the EF increase group and 59 patients for the EF decrease group. LVEF on average increased from 33 +/- 4% to 51 +/- 8% in the EF increase group and decreased from 35 +/- 4% to 25 +/- 5% in the EF decrease group. The strongest multivariable predictor of improvement of LVEF was beta-blocker therapy (odds ratio 3.9, p = 0.002). The strongest independent predictor of LVEF decrease was the presence of a permanent right ventricular apical pacemaker (odds ratio 6.6, p = 0.002). Thus, this study identified beta-blocker therapy as the major independent predictor for improvement in LVEF of > or =10 points, whereas a permanent pacemaker (right ventricular apical pacing) was the strongest predictor of a LVEF decrease of > or =7 points.", 
    "7": "Glaucoma is a multifactorial optic neuropathy in which there is a characteristic acquired loss of retinal ganglion cells, at levels beyond normal age-related baseline loss, and corresponding atrophy of the optic nerve. Although asymptomatic in its earlier stages, the disease is nevertheless one of the leading global causes of irreversible blindness. Although elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is one of the most important risk factors and lowering of IOP is the only proven treatment so far, the definition of glaucoma has evolved from a disease caused by increased IOP to one characterised by an IOP-sensitive, progressive optic neuropathy. In recent years, safer and better tolerated topical medications have been developed to control IOP more effectively, thereby limiting the need for surgery. New research has also noted the importance of diurnal IOP variation as a critical risk factor for progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) and subsequent visual field loss. Moreover, new discoveries have further elucidated the basic pathophysiological and genetic mechanisms underlying the elevated levels of IOP, as well as the cellular mechanisms of GON. As our understanding of these complex pathways continues to improve, development opportunities for new therapeutic modalities will be enhanced.",

    "9": "While cannabinoid receptors activate multiple signaling pathways in the brain, it remains unclear what influence the inhibition of adenylylcyclase has on the inhibition of glutamate release. In cerebrocortical nerve terminals, the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 reduced KCl-evoked glutamate release through a mechanism that restricted the rise of cytoplasmic free Ca2+, but not the changes in plasma membrane depolarization. These effects were consistent with the inhibition of Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, WIN55,212-2 reduced 4-aminopyridine (4AP) evoked glutamate release to a larger extent by modulating the behavior of both Ca2+ and K(+)-channels. The inhibition of 4AP-evoked release was associated with a decrease in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ and in plasma membrane depolarization that was reverted by the potassium channel blocker, tetraethylammonium. Interestingly, the reduction of KCl- and 4AP-evoked release by WIN55,212-2 was independent of adenylylcyclase activity and did not affect cAMP. Forskolin and the beta-adrenergic receptor increase intrasynaptosomal cAMP and promote a PKA-dependent tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive increase in the spontaneous release of glutamate. These two responses were reduced by WIN55,212-2. However, the glutamate release induced by Sp-8-Br-cAMPS, which directly activated PKA without affecting cAMP, was also similarly reduced by WIN55,212-2. Hence, we conclude that the inhibition of glutamate release by WIN55,212-2 is unrelated to changes in cAMP and that the inhibition of release that a decrease in cAMP might produce is occluded by the activation of additional pathways such as the inhibition of Ca2+ channels and/or the activation of K(+)-channels that strongly depress glutamate release.",

ESH/ESC/JNC 2003), A group of 11 men and 11 women with a mean age 47+/-5 years underwent 24-h blood pressure monitoring after 8 days of placebo and after 20 days of treatment. A significant reduction (p < 0.05) in blood pressure was found for 11 h in men and 15 h in women (systolic) and 9 h in men and 13 h in women (diastolic). There was a tendency for a greater mean reduction in women (9.6/8.0 mmHg in men versus 12.9/7.4 mmHg in women). Diastolic blood pressure variability was significantly reduced in women (9.9 versus 13.1, respectively, p < 0.002) with a tendency for systolic blood pressure variability reduction (13.0 versus 15.1). The smoothness index for systolic blood pressure was higher in women (1.0/0.74 versus 0.64/0.61). A better response for betaxolol treatment 20 mg/day was observed in women in terms of target organ damage: a longer period of significant blood pressure reduction, lower variability and a tendency toward a greater reduction.", 
    "11": "The deterioration of the long-term fractal component of heart rate variability (beta) is reported in patients with organic heart disease. To examine the day-to-day variability of beta and to study the effects of nipradilol (NIP), an antianginal agent, on beta in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), we performed 24-hour ambulatory ECG (AECG) in 24 patients with silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) and obtained the conventional frequency domain heart rate variability (HRV) indices and beta using the MemCalc system. Patients were divided into two groups: group I consisted of 10 patients (64 +/- 5 years of age) for the assessment of the day-to-day variability of beta; group II comprised 14 patients (60 +/- 6 years of age) for evaluation of the effect of NIP (3 mg b.i.d). In group I, AECG was repeated twice a week, while AECG was recorded before NIP treatment (placebo) and on the last day of the 4-week NIP treatment in group II. In group I, there was significant correlation between the values of beta on day 1 and day 2 (r = 0.79, p < 0.05), the difference being 0.09 +/- 0.15 (coefficient of variance: 6.8%). Bland and Altman's analysis indicated that the results were easily reproducible, making this approach feasible for clinical use. In group II, NIP significantly decreased the values of beta by 10.6% (from -1.23 +/- 0.09 to -1.18 +/- 0.07; p < 0.05). NIP also significantly increased the conventional HRV indices. The degree of decrement of beta by NIP was larger than that of the day-to-day variability. In conclusion, a day-to-day variability exists in beta in patients with SMI, but its value is relatively small. A daily dose of 6 mg NIP ameliorates beta and overcomes this variability.",

However, the clinical application of PET and SPET on a routine basis is severely limited by the lack of widely available selective radiotracers. Technetium-99m-labelled 4-fluorobenzyl-4-(2-mercapto-2-methyl-4-aza-pentyl)-4-(2-mercapto-2-methyl-propylamino)-piperidine (99mTc-FBPBAT) is a recently developed radiotracer which exhibited marked adrenergic affinity in previous investigations in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes, and in rats. In this study, we have verified these findings in a porcine model, and evaluated the potential of SPET with 99mTc-FBPBAT to assess the adrenergic nervous system of the heart.",

The cardiac uptake was specifically suppressed by previous treatment of the animals with metoprolol and prazosin, and was displaceable by norepinephrine. In contrast, the inhibition of radioactivity uptake into the heart was less pronounced after pretreatment with desipramine. The peak radioactivity in blood was determined after 1.5-2 min, followed by a plateau of nearly constant radioactivity from 25-30 min onwards. Within 6 h, more than 35% of the injected activity was excreted in the urine. The effective dose according to International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60 (ICRP 60) was 0.0064 mSv.MBq-1 for adults.", 
    "25": "In view of these findings, we conclude that the myocardial uptake of 99mTc-FBPBAT reflects the sympathetic adrenergic nervous system of the heart. The effective dose estimated indicates that the clinical use of 99mTc-FBPBAT results in an acceptable radiation dose in humans. Despite the relatively high radioactivity uptake into the lung and liver, 99mTc-FBPBAT appears to be the first promising Tc-based radiotracer for scintigraphic assessment of the cardiac adrenergic system. This result encourages further development of Tc-based agents for routine SPET studies in humans.",

We describe 3 male patients with thyrotoxicosis and associated pulmonary hypertension. Case reports of an additional 15 patients are also reviewed. In patients with thyrotoxicosis and pulmonary hypertension, treatment of thyrotoxicosis alone is associated with improvement in pulmonary hypertension. Previous reports have consisted of mostly female patients, but we report 3 men. When all cases are considered, the typical patient is female (10/14 = 71%), middle-aged (48 years), with mean pulmonary artery systolic pressures improving from 56 to 32 mm Hg with treatment. Autoantibodies were detected in 10/14 (71%) patients. The response to treatment (medical or surgical) of thyrotoxicosis supports the hypothesis that hyperthyroidism is either a cause of pulmonary hypertension, or a factor that may unmask pulmonary hypertension. Recognition is important since treatment and response are very different compared to other patients with pulmonary hypertension.

(2) The working definition of hypertension is unchanged, namely blood pressure of at least 160/95 mm Hg in the general population, and at least 140/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes and a history of stroke; these figures must be found on several occasions using a standardised method, with the patient at rest. (3) The goals of antihypertensive therapy are to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events, and not simply to drive blood pressure below a fixed (and often controversial) threshold. (4) Some drug and non drug interventions have a positive risk-benefit balance in the long term. (5) When antihypertensive drug therapy is needed, trials based on clinical endpoints show that it is best to start treatment with a single drug. (6) New data support the use of certain thiazide diuretics (chlortalidone, or hydrochlorothiazide if chlortalidone is not available) as first line treatment for most hypertensive patients, including non diabetic adults, diabetic adults, elderly subjects (over 65 years), and stroke patients. Some betablockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitor) are second-line alternatives. (7) Assessment of other antihypertensive drugs has also progressed since 1999, including indapamide (thiazide-like diuretic), amlodipine, diltiazem and verapamil (calcium channel blockers), lisinopril (ACE inhibitor), and losartan and valsartan (angiotensin II antagonists).

    "39": "During cold exposure, homeothermic animals mobilize glucose with higher efficiency than at thermoneutrality. An interaction between the insulin signal transduction machinery and high sympathetic tonus is thought to play an important role in this phenomenon. In the present study, rats were exposed to cold during 8 days and treated, or not, with a beta3-adrenergic agonist, BRL37344 sodium 4-2-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl amino propyl phenoxy-acetic acid sodium (BRL37344), or antagonist, SR59230A 3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylamino]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate (SR59230A), to evaluate the cross-talk between insulin and beta3-adrenergic intracellular signaling in brown adipose tissue. The drugs did not modify food ingestion, body temperature, and body weight in control and cold-exposed rats. Treatment of control rats with BRL37344 led to higher insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptors, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and ERK, higher insulin-induced IRS-1/PI3-kinase association, and higher [Ser(473)] phosphorylation of Akt. Cold exposure alone promoted higher insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptors, IRS-1, IRS-2, and ERK, and higher insulin-induced IRS-1 and IRS-2/PI3-kinase association. Except for the regulation of ERK, SR59230A abolished all the cold-induced effects upon the insulin signal transduction pathway. However, this antagonist only partially inhibited the cold-induced increase of glucose uptake. Thus, the sympathetic tonus generated during cold-exposure acts, in brown adipose tissue, through the beta3-adrenergic receptor and modulates insulin signal transduction, with the exception of ERK. However, insulin-independent mechanisms other than beta3-adrenergic activation participate in cold-induced glucose uptake in brown adipose tissue of rats.", 
    "40": "The present study was designed to explore the role of gap junctions in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF beta1)-stimulated steroidogenesis in ovarian granulosa cells of gonadotropin-primed immature rats. There were three specific aims. First, we investigated the effect of FSH and TGF beta1 as well as lindane (a general gap junction blocker) on the level of connexin43 (Cx43), the major gap junction constituent in granulosa cells, and on gap junction function. The second aim was to determine the effect of lindane on FSH and TGF beta1-stimulated progesterone production and the levels of two critical players, cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc) enzyme and steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein. The third aim was to further investigate the specific involvement of Cx43 gap junctions in FSH and TGF beta1-stimulated steroidogenesis using a Cx43 mimetic peptide blocker. Immunoblotting analysis showed that FSH plus TGF beta1 dramatically increased the levels of phosphorylated Cx43 without significantly influencing the level of nonphosphorylated Cx43, and this stimulatory effect was completely suppressed by lindane. Also, immunofluorescence analysis showed that Cx43 immuno-reactivity increased in the FSH plus TGF beta1-treated group and predominantly appeared in a punctate pattern at cell-cell contact sites, and lindane reduced such cell periphery immunostaining. Furthermore, TGF beta1 enhanced the FSH-induced gap junction intercellular communication and lindane completely suppressed this effect. In addition, lindane suppressed the FSH and TGF beta1-stimulated increases in progesterone production and the levels of P450scc enzyme and StAR protein. This study demonstrates a clear temporal association between the Cx43 protein level/gap junction communication and progesterone production in rat ovarian granulosa cells in response to FSH and TGF beta1 as well as lindane. Furthermore, a specific Cx43 gap junction blocker suppressed FSH plus TGF beta1-stimulated progesterone production. In conclusion, this study suggests that Cx43 gap junctions may play a critical role in FSH plus TGF beta1-stimulated progesterone production in rat ovarian granulosa cells.",

Electrical stability was achieved and the patient was discharged on propranolol 400 mg/day. Two months later, a second arrhythmia cluster occurred that was controlled by the addition of amiodarone. The patient remains free of arrhythmia 15 months after the event with the combination of propranolol and amiodarone.", 
    "42": "Pretreatment of Hep G2 cells with beta-naphthoflavone (BNF 1-25microM) significantly increased cytosolic sulfation activities of 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH-PL) racemate. The profile was similar to those of sulfations towards dopamine and triiodothyronine in the same cytosolic fractions. Kinetic studies of 4-OH-PL sulfation in Hep G2 cytosolic fractions revealed that V(max) values increased but apparent K(m) values remained unchanged following the BNF pretreatment. Among five recombinant human SULT isoforms (SULT1A1, -1A3, -1B1, -1E1 and -2A1) examined, only SULT2A1 did not show 4-OH-PL sulfation activities under the conditions used. SULT1A3 and -1E1 exhibited an enantioselectivity of 4-OH-R-PL sulfation>4-OH-S-PL sulfation, which agreed with that of BNF-pretreated Hep G2 cells as well as of nontreated cells, whereas SULT1A1 and -1B1 showed a reversed enantioselectivity (R<S). In kinetic studies of 4-OH-PL sulfations by four kinds of human SULT isoforms, apparent K(m) values for SULT1A3 were the lowest, and the parameters were close to those of Hep G2 cytosolic fractions. Real time RT-PCR using TaqMan probes demonstrated that the mRNA levels of SULT1A3 increased following BNF pretreatment, which paralleled the results from Western blotting showing the elevated levels of SULT1A3 proteins. These results suggest that the induction of SULT1A3 is mainly responsible for the elevated 4-OH-PL sulfation activities following the pretreatment of Hep G2 cells with BNF.", 
    "43": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious illness that affects over 5% of the adult population. It is one of the few conditions for which the mortality and morbidity are still increasing. Experts expect COPD to become the third leading cause of death and the fifth leading cause of disability worldwide by the year 2020. Thus far, the only treatments that have been shown to make a difference to survival are smoking cessation and the use of oxygen supplements for those who are hypoxaemic at rest. The use of inhaled corticosteroids as monotherapy or in combination with a long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist for COPD is controversial. Experimental data indicate that the inflammatory process in COPD may be resistant to the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids. However, several large clinical studies have shown that inhaled corticosteroids in relatively high doses (e.g. budesonide 800 microg/day or fluticasone propionate 1 mg/day) reduce exacerbations by 20-30% and improve the health status of COPD patients by a similar amount compared with placebo. Withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids may increase clinical exacerbation rates by 50% in COPD patients and by 2-fold in those with severe disease. Combined therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists may be superior to individual component therapy in reducing exacerbations. However, these medications must be used cautiously, as they have been associated with certain adverse effects. Inhaled corticosteroids, for instance, increase the risk for dysphonia and oral thrush by 2- to 3-fold. Skin bruising is also more common in users than in non-users of inhaled corticosteroids. On balance, for those with moderate-to-severe COPD and those who experience frequent exacerbations, judicious use of inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists appears reasonable.", 
    "44": "Beta-blockers utilized in the Type 2 diabetic patient result in an even greater decrease in cardiac events than in the nondiabetic patient. Unfortunately, first-and second-generation beta-blockers are associated with the worsening of insulin resistance, deterioration of glycemic control, peripheral vasoconstriction, potentially worsening peripheral vascular disease, and more frequent and severe hypoglycemia. The third-generation beta-blockers have unique properties, including alpha1-blockade, and have been shown to lower insulin resistance, improve glycemic control, and vasodilate resistance arterioles. The Glycemic Effects in Diabetes Mellitus: Carvedilol-Metoprolol Comparison in Hypertensives (GEMINI) trial has been designed to compare a third-generation (carvedilol) with a second-generation beta-blocker (metoprolol) in a cohort of participants with hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome measure of the study is change in the HbA1c. The study is powered to detect a difference in HbA1c of 0.3 units (%) between the groups. Secondary endpoints include changes in insulin resistance, fasting glucose, and the lipid profile. Differences in the side-effect profile (cold extremities, fatigue, impotence, and hypoglycemia) will also be assessed. The GEMINI trial, therefore, is the first large randomized trial to assess whether utilizing a third-generation beta-blocker yields a favorable metabolic profile in the patient with Type 2 diabetes and hypertension.",

Recently it has been suggested that band ligation may be a better option for primary prophylaxis. We compared nonselective beta-blockers with band ligation in patients with large varices (F2, F3) and elevated hepatic venous wedge pressure gradient (HVWPG, > or = 12 mm Hg). All patients were prospectively followed for variceal bleeding, mortality, and treatment-related complications. Based on previous published studies, we estimated that 90 patients in each arm would be required to show a difference in bleeding rate. The study was prematurely terminated when we realized that our estimated sample size was inadequate to show a difference based on the observed bleeding rate. At the time of termination, 31 patients (Child A, 11; B, 14; C, 6), with a mean HVWPG of 19 +/- 9.1 mm Hg, were randomized to either band ligation (group A; n = 16) or beta-blockers (group B; n = 15). Baseline demographics of both groups were similar and the mean follow-up period was 27.4 +/- 12.9 months. During the follow-up, two patients in group A and one patient in group B had bleeding. Nine patients (29%; group A, six; group B, three; P = ns) died due to non-bleeding-related causes and five (16%) patients (group A, three; group B, two) underwent liver transplantation. Treatment-related complication were minimal in both groups. Despite the selection of high-risk patients, the observed bleeding rate was much lower than anticipated.

    "57": "Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is a rare but serious complication in patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and is characterized by a progressive, intra-abdominal, inflammatory process resulting in the formation of sheets of new fibrous tissue, which cover, bind, and constrict the viscera, thereby compromising the motility of the bowel. No satisfactory estimate is available on the comparative incidence of dialysis related SEP and the pathogenesis of SEP still remains uncertain. Although recent therapeutic approaches have reported varying degrees of success, an efficient measure to detect, at an early stage, patients at risk for SEP would be beneficial and a standardized treatment regimen to prevent the illness is urgently needed. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features of SEP and to identify the possible risk factors for the development of SEP in CAPD patients. We retrospectively reviewed by questionnaire SEP cases among CAPD patients from 7 university hospital dialysis centers in Korea, including Yonsei University, Ajou University, Catholic University, Inha University, Kyungpook University, Seoul National University and Soonchunhyang University, from January 1981 to December 2002. Out of a total of 4,290 CAPD patients in these centers, 34 cases developed SEP with an overall prevalence of 0.79%. The male to female ratio was 17:17. The median age of these patients was 44.5 years (range 19-66). The median duration of CAPD before SEP was 64 months (9-144) and 68% of patients (23/34) had been on CAPD for more than 4 years. Peritonitis (including two fungal cases) was the main cause of catheter removal in SEP (27 cases, 79%). Seventy-five percent of the cases (15/20) were administered beta-blocker for a mean duration of 85 months (26-130). Among 10 cases with available peritoneal equilibration test (PET) data, 8 showed high transporter characteristics, and the remaining 2 were high average. Eighteen cases were diagnosed by clinical and radiologic methods, and 16 were surgically diagnosed. Eleven cases were surgically treated and the others were treated conservatively with intermittent total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The overall mortality rate was 24%. SEP is a serious, life threatening complication of CAPD. Most cases had a PD duration of more than 4 years, a history of severe peritonitis, and high transporter characteristics in PET. Therefore, to reduce the incidence of SEP, careful monitoring and treatment, including early catheter removal in patients with severe peritonitis, should be considered for long-term CAPD patients with the above characteristics.",

We examined the relationship between HRV [standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), power in high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF), and LF:HF ratio] and ambient air pollutants in 497 men from the Normative Aging Study in greater Boston, Massachusetts, seen between November 2000 and October 2003. We examined 4-hr, 24-hr, and 48-hr moving averages of air pollution (PM2.5, particle number concentration, black carbon, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide). Controlling for potential confounders, HF decreased 20.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.6-34.2%] and LF:HF ratio increased 18.6% (95% CI, 4.1-35.2%) per SD (8 microg/m3) increase in 48-hr PM2.5. LF was reduced by 11.5% (95% CI, 0.4-21.3%) per SD (13 ppb) increment in 4-hr O3. The associations between HRV and PM2.5 and O3 were stronger in people with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and hypertension. The associations observed between SDNN and LF and PM2.5 were stronger in people with diabetes. People using calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers had lower associations between O3 and PM2.5 with LF. No effect modification by other cardiac medications was found. Exposures to PM2.5 and O3 are associated with decreased HRV, and history of IHD, hypertension, and diabetes may confer susceptibility to autonomic dysfunction by air pollution.", 
    "69": "The aim was to characterize mouse gender and strain differences in the metabolism of commonly used human cytochrome (CYP) P450 probe substrates. Thirteen human CYP probe substrates (phenacetin, coumarin, 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin, amiodarone, paclitaxel, diclofenac, S-mephenytoin, bufuralol, dextromethorphan, chlorzoxazone, p-nitrophenol, testosterone and lauric acid) were used in activity measurements. The metabolism of the probe substrates was compared in liver microsomes from male and female NMRI, CBA, C57bl/6, 129/SvJ and CD1 strains. The expression of proteins identified on Western blots with commonly available antibodies selective for specific human and rat CYP enzymes were compared in the different mouse strains. Males had higher metabolism than corresponding females for phenacetin O-deethylation (human marker for CYP1A2 activity), and a high correlation was found between phenacetin activity and immunoreactivity in Western blots produced with rat CYP1A2 antibodies. Protein detected by antibodies cross-reacting with human CYP2B6 and rat CYP2B1/2 antibodies was female specific except for the 129/SvJ strain, where it was absent in both genders. Females generally had a higher metabolism of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation (human markers for CYP2D activity). Bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation correlated with a female-dominant mouse CYP, which was detected with antibodies against rat CYP2D4. p-Nitrophenol 2-hydroxylation correlated better than chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation with the protein detected with antibodies against rat CYP2E1, indicating that p-nitrophenol is a more specific substrate for mouse CYP2E1.",

    "75": "Advanced heart failure is characterized by increased activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the development of cachexia. Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been proposed as a lipid metabolism regulator. The effects of exogenous Ang II (osmotic minipump, 525 ng/kg/min for 12 d) on interstitial sc glycerol and norepinephrine levels, indexes of lipolysis, and sympathetic activation, respectively, were measured in Sprague Dawley rats by consecutive microdialysis performed in vivo in white adipose tissue. Higher sustained interstitial glycerol and norepinephrine levels were found after 7 and 12 d of Ang II infusion. Triglyceride to DNA content ratio and adipocyte diameter were reduced in sc and visceral (retroperitoneal and epididymal) fat tissues of Ang II-infused rats, whose body weight was lower and blood pressure higher. Losartan, an Ang II receptor 1 blocker, and carvedilol, an alpha1-nonselective-beta1,2,3-adrenergic blocker, but not doxazosin, an alpha1-selective-adrenergic blocker, lowered glycerol and norepinephrine levels, preventing lipolysis and weight loss. Our results indicate that Ang II stimulates lipolysis in sc and visceral adipocytes by sympathetic activation and beta-adrenergic-receptor stimulation. Nonselective-beta-adrenergic and Ang II-receptor1 blockade markedly attenuated the rise of norepinephrine, preventing catabolic effects. The metabolic benefits of carvedilol and losartan, in addition to recognized protective cardiovascular effects, may be relevant in cachectic patients with advanced heart failure.",

BK has a predominant distribution in the extracellular space and an average hepatic extraction of 8% in the steady state. Hydrolysis products of infused BK (R(1)-F(5) and R(1)-P(7)) did not elicit PHR. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is concentrated in the perivenous region and B2R in the periportal region. Microphysiometry showed that BK (and not a B1 agonist) interacts with stellate cells and the endothelial sinusoidal/Kupffer cell fraction. This effect was inhibited by the B2R antagonist.", 
    "86": "Events can be summarized as: the hypertensive action of BK on sinusoidal cells of the periportal region is followed by its hydrolysis by ACE which is primarily present in the perivenous region; there is no functional B1R in the normal liver; BK induces HAHR via eicosanoid release and PHR by a distinct pathway on the B2R.

    "88": "A sensitive RP-HPLC method for the determination of propranolol enantiomers was developed. It involves the formation of the monoester of propranolol with optically pure (R,R)-O,O'-diacetyl tartaric acid anhydride (DATAAN) in a dry, aprotic solvent with an excess of trichloroacetic acid. The resulting diastereomeric monoesters were easily resolved on a Shim-pack CLC-ODS column with the mobile phase system consisting of different proportions of 2% aqueous acetic acid (adjusted with concentrated ammonia to pH 3.48) and 90% aqueous methanol. And the column effluent was monitored by a fluorescence detector (lambda(ex) 296 nm, lambda(em) 340 nm). In our experiment, a very strong difference of the fluorescence absorbance of the two diastereomers was observed. After having studied chromatographic separation conditions including pH value, ionic strength and the volume percent of organic modifier in mobile phase, we presented the different configurations of the diastereomers and an intra-molecular hydrogen bond which exists only in the (R,R,S) isomer. These could account for the obvious difference of fluorescence activity of two diastereomeric monoesters and their elution order on the reversed-phase column.

A possible interaction between beta-adrenoceptors and AngII pressor activity was also investigated. 2. Injection of isoproterenol (0.1-10 nmol) in the anterior hypothalamic area induced a dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in sham-operated (SO), but not in ACo, animals. Isoproterenol (1 nmol) reduced blood pressure in SO rats (DeltaMAP -10.1+/-1.4 mmHg; n=10) but not in ACo animals (DeltaMAP -0.9+/-1.6 mmHg; n=10; P<0.05 vs SO rats). Whereas previous administration of atenolol (40 nmol) enhanced the cardiovascular effect of isoproterenol (1 nmol) in ACo rats but not in SO animals, propranolol (40 nmol) prevented the hypotensive action of isoproterenol in both experimental groups. Intrahypothalamic administration of clenbuterol decreased MAP in a dose-dependent manner; however, the depressor response to clenbuterol (10 nmol) was greater in ACo rats than in SO rats (DeltaMAP -26.8+/-3.2 vs -14.4+/-2.4 mmHg, respectively; n=5 for both; P<0.05). When AngII (50 ng) was injected into the anterior hypothalamic area, a greater pressor response was observed in ACo rats than in SO rats (DeltaMAP 19.6+/-1.1 vs 11.3+/-0.6 mmHg, respectively; n=5 for both; P<0.05). Atenolol (40 nmol) pretreatment partially and significantly prevented the pressor response to AngII in ACo rats, but not in SO rats. 3. In conclusion, these results provide pharmacological evidence for the existence of a beta1-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor mechanism in the anterior hypothalamic area of ACo rats that is absent in SO rats. The enhanced depressor beta2-adrenoceptor activity observed in chronic ACo rats could be a compensatory adjustment to pressor beta1-adrenoceptor activity. Conversely, pressor overactivity of AngII was observed in the anterior hypothalamic area of ACo rats at a chronic hypertensive stage; this enhancement could be explained, at least in part, by the pressor beta1-adrenoceptor activity.",

Use rates were compared by age, sex, time period and geographical area, according to available data.", 
    "147": "Use rates for reperfusion in STEMI patients ranged from 60% to 70%, primarily representing fibrinolytic therapy. A delay in presentation to hospital after symptom onset represented an impediment to timely therapy, which was particularly pronounced for women and elderly patients. Overall, less than 50% of patients met the door-to-needle target of less than 30 min. Medication use rates at discharge increased from 1999/2000 to 2000/2001 across the different data sources: acetylsalicylic acid, 83% to 88%; beta-blockers, 74% to 89%; ACEIs, 54% to 67%; statins, 41% to 53%; and calcium antagonists, 21% to 32%.",

    "149": "The disparity between what doctor's believe and the medical facts can be frightening at times. This reflects centuries of training on how to manage patients in the absence of evidence to guide practice. Increasingly disease is becoming susceptible to treatment, requiring a change in the professional approach from the educated, hopeful guess to the application of objective data. Arrogance and certainty, born of ignorance and clutching in desperation at imaginary straws probably still have a place in medicine when conventional treatment has failed, but should play a diminishing role within the medical profession. Epidemiological association is no longer sufficient evidence to conclude that an intervention is effective; with few exceptions, randomised-controlled trials are required. A more successful and objective era of medical practice has arrived. Consequently, a greater degree of scepticism about claims of benefit is also appropriate, which should apply equally to treatments new and old. Of course, no 2 patients are alike, and the evidence-base remains a guide-map on how patients should be treated, rather than a set of rigid rules. Guidelines are guidelines and not infallible, inviolable decrees. In this article, some of the current controversies in the management of heart failure are discussed, ranging from diagnosis, diastolic heart failure, and the role of natriuretic peptides, to the lack of evidence for a clinically-relevant benefit (and therefore possible harm) from aspirin, statins, implantable defibrillators or revascularisation.",

When compared with patients with no documented NSVT, patients with NSVT were older, more often had myocardial infarction in their history, diabetes mellitus, and an ejection fraction <40%. Regarding frequency of drug application, medication at discharge did not (beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, amiodarone) or only slightly (acetylsalicylic acid, statins, and sotalol) differ between both groups. Multivariable analysis of 1 year mortality, adjusted for age, gender, diabetes, reperfusion therapy, ejection fraction <40%, and beta-blocker therapy showed the following results: In patients without statin treatment and no NSVT, 1 year mortality after STEMI was 9.2%, but increased to 25.0% [odds ratio (OR) 3.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-6.20], if NSVT were present. In patients on statin treatment and no NSVT, 1 year mortality was only 3.2%, and in the presence of NSVT 1 year mortality was not significantly increased anymore (5.3%; OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.55-1.92).",

Forty-five patients were randomly assigned to the control, esmolol, and landiolol groups (n = 15 each). Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in oxygen, with an end-tidal concentration maintained at 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC). Infusion of saline (control group), esmolol (bolus of 1 mg/kg and then 0.25 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1); esmolol group), or landiolol (bolus of 0.125 mg/kg and then 0.04 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1); landiolol group) was started 5 min after the induction of anesthesia and was continued throughout the study. Tracheal intubation was performed 12 min after anesthesia induction. There were no differences in overall changes of mean arterial blood pressure among the three groups, whereas, at 1-5 min after tracheal intubation, heart rate increased in all groups but was significantly slower in the esmolol and landiolol groups than in the control group (P < 0.05). BIS was between 96 and 98 for all patients at baseline and decreased during the induction of anesthesia. There were no differences in BIS among the three groups before laryngoscopy (39 +/- 5, 39 +/- 5, and 38 +/- 4 in the control, esmolol, and landiolol groups, respectively). BIS increased significantly in the control group (54 +/- 10; P < 0.05) 1 min after intubation, whereas it remained unchanged in the esmolol and landiolol groups (45 +/- 10 and 41 +/- 6, respectively). In conclusion, the increase in both heart rate and BIS after tracheal intubation under 1 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia was suppressed by the concomitant administration of either esmolol or landiolol.",

The major proportion of atherosclerosis mortality is related to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, yet there still is not an optimal method for making the diagnosis of vulnerable plaque in vivo. The search for such an undefined method, along with studies on amelioration of currently available technology, gains special significance when the association between the qualitative definition of lesions in an individual and cardiovascular risks are considered. We, therefore, start by defining the critical lesion of coronary atherosclerosis and review the advantages and potential for clinical use of various methods to detect the vulnerable plaque and comment on possible future implications in this field.",

Non-selective beta-blockers are the first-line treatment; band ligation is roughly equivalent to beta-blockers and is the first choice for patients with contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers. Treatment of acute bleeding should aim at controlling bleeding and preventing early rebleeding and complications, especially infections. Combined endoscopic and pharmacological treatment with vasoactive drugs can control bleeding in up to 90% of patients. All patients who survive a variceal bleed should be treated with beta-blockers or band ligation to prevent rebleeding. All patients in whom bleeding cannot be controlled or who continue to rebleed can be treated with salvage TIPS or, in selected cases, with surgical shunts. Liver transplantation should be considered for patients with severe liver insufficiency in which first-line treatments fail.",

The effects of propranolol and placebo were assessed using time series of the RR interval (RRI) and systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) obtained from continuous ECG and blood pressure signal recordings. Heart rate and systolic arterial blood pressure fluctuations were analyzed using nonlinear and linear methods of time series statistics.", 
    "159": "Propranolol significantly increased the complexity of heart rate fluctuations in terms of symbol dynamic (SymDyn) entropy and symbol dynamic percentage of forbidden words. Propranolol augmented cross entropy between RRI and SAP and increased fractal dimension of RRI. beta-blockade also affected linear measures of RRI fluctuations by increasing parasympathetic, respiration-related high-frequency (HF) variability and arterial baroreflex-related low-frequency (LF) variability. Propranolol administration, however, had no effect on the complexity of SAP fluctuations assessed using nonlinear time series statistics.", 
    "160": "beta-blockade by propranolol has a differential effect on RRI and SAP fluctuations in healthy subjects. Propranolol increases the complexity of RRI fluctuations. The effect is associated with the cardiac vagotonic drug action of propranolol. SAP fluctuations are almost unchanged. The increased complexity of RRI fluctuations may be a beneficial feature of beta-blockade, since many cardiovascular diseases decrease the complexity of RRI time series by dampening cardiovascular reflex actions.",

The primary endpoint was the change in the maximum exercise time (MET) 24 +/- 1 h after the last intake of study medication compared to baseline. Secondary efficacy parameters were time to onset of angina, time to 1 mm ST segment depression, angina attacks, consumption of short-acting nitrates, blood pressure and pulse rate. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment with talinolol (100, 200 or 300 mg once daily) or placebo for a period of 6 weeks.",

The means of MET prolongation ranged from 27.4 sec under placebo to a maximum of 47.6 sec in the 200 mg group. However, the time to 1 mm ST segment depression during exercise increased markedly with talinolol, the difference to placebo reaching statistical significance with the 200 mg/d dose (80.1 +/- 32.7 sec, p = 0.0182) and 300 mg/d dose (82.0 +/- 31.6 sec, p = 0.0127). In the case of the other secondary variables, the most pronounced effects were recorded for talinolol doses of 200 and 300 mg/d. Talinolol significantly inhibited the exercise-induced increase in heart rate and blood pressure. The decrease in rate pressure product at 100 W workload was statistically significant with all administered talinolol doses (delta from baseline to final visit 3090, 4351 and 4291 for 100, 200 and 300 mg/d, respectively, p < 0.0001). Despite once-daily dosing, talinolol at doses up to 300 mg/d was very well tolerated. No unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed.",

    "165": "beta-Blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) have proven to be valuable methods in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of EVL combined with nadolol versus EVL alone as secondary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding. Patients admitted for acute variceal bleeding were treated during emergency endoscopy with EVL or sclerotherapy and received somatostatin for 5 days. At that point, patients were randomized to receive EVL plus nadolol or EVL alone. EVL sessions were repeated every 10 to 12 days until the varices were eradicated. Eighty patients with cirrhosis (alcoholic origin in 66%) were included (Child-Turcotte-Pugh A, 15%; B, 56%; C, 29%). The median follow-up period was 16 months (range, 1-24 months). The variceal bleeding recurrence rate was 14% in the EVL plus nadolol group and 38% in the EVL group (P = .006). Mortality was similar in both groups: five patients (11.6%) died in the combined therapy group and four patients (10.8%) died in the EVL group. There were no significant differences in the number of EVL sessions to eradicate varices: 3.2 +/- 1.3 in the combined therapy group versus 3.5 +/- 1.3 in the EVL alone group. The actuarial probability of variceal recurrence at 1 year was lower in the EVL plus nadolol group (54%) than in the EVL group (77%; P = .06). Adverse effects resulting from nadolol were observed in 11% of the patients. In conclusion, nadolol plus EVL reduces the incidence of variceal rebleeding compared with EVL alone. A combined treatment could lower the probability of variceal recurrence after eradication.",

Only a few of the many published studies meet the criteria of the WHO-BPH consensus conference. The few placebo-controlled, long-term (>/=6 months) studies suggest a positive effect of some extracts (saw palmetto, beta-sitosterol, urtica, rye-grass, saw palmetto/urtica combination) on LUTS; an effect on uroflow, post-void residual volume, prostate volume and PSA was not consistently demonstrable. Randomised trials against an active comparator (alpha1-blocker, 5alpha-reductase inhibitors) are difficult to interpret. Due to the lack of prospective studies, several meta-analyses have been published that can not, however, replace prospective studies. None of the BPH-guidelines currently recommend plant extracts, yet universally conclude that this is an interesting approach. Further prospective studies using WHO standards are required to reliably determine the role of such extracts in the management of elderly men with LUTS due to BPH/BPE.",

    "174": "Platelets play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes. Chronic beta-blockade has been shown to improve the long-term clinical outcome in coronary heart disease. Because platelets play a central role in thrombus formation, the aim of the present study was to investigate if chronic beta-blockade may transregulate the expression of alpha2-adrenergic receptors on human platelets and via this mechanism may modulate platelet activation. The densities of alpha2-adrenergic receptors of platelets were determined in healthy volunteers under chronic beta-blockade and as alpha2-adrenergic receptor-mediated function in catecholamine-induced platelet aggregation was determined. Chronic beta-blockade induced a time-dependent reduction of alpha2-adrenergic receptors. This reduction was accompanied by a decrease of the alpha-subunit of Gi proteins as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. This transregulation at both the receptor level and the G-protein level resulted in an almost complete loss of the alpha2-adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. The impairment of the alpha2-adrenergic receptor system correlated with a reduction of the catecholamine-induced activation and aggregation of human platelets. The functional transregulation of alpha2-adrenergic receptors by chronic beta-blockade in platelets and the consequent impairment of platelet activation may contribute to the therapeutic success of beta-blocker therapy.",

UV absorption spectra for each drug sample were determined using a spectrophotometer. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and carteolol hydrochloride were simultaneously added to the HCECs for 10 minutes, and the cell viability was measured 12 hours later. The ability of carteolol hydrochloride to scavenge superoxide anion (O2) and singlet oxygen (O2) was investigated using the MCLA chemiluminescence method.",

Carteolol hydrochloride at 1 mmol/L attenuated the UVB-induced cell damage when added before, during, or after UVB irradiation (P<0.01). Levobunolol hydrochloride at 1 mmol/L (P<0.01) added during or after irradiation and timolol maleate at 0.1 mmol/L or higher (P<0.05) added during irradiation attenuated the UVB-induced cell damage. Betaxolol hydrochloride and nipradilol had no effect. The UV absorption spectra of timolol maleate and levobunolol hydrochloride overlapped with the UVB wavelength spectrum, while carteolol hydrochloride, betaxolol hydrochloride, and nipradilol showed a partial overlap. Carteolol hydrochloride at 1 mmol/L (P<0.05) significantly inhibited H2O2-induced cell damage and was able to scavenge O2 (EC50 value: 48 mmol/L).",

    "179": "Like nocturnal rodents, the diurnal tropical rodent Arvicanthis ansorgei shows a daily rhythm in pineal melatonin content. Seasonal and photoperiodic variations in the biosynthetic activity of the pineal gland: arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT), hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT) activities and melatonin content were measured in male and female A. ansorgei captured near Samaya, Mali, and kept either under artificial laboratory photoperiods [light-dark (LD) cycles: LD 14:10, LD 12:12 or LD 10:14 or caught in the field in Mali and killed at four different times of the year (January, April, June and November). Under artificial photoperiod, the duration of the nocturnal peak of AA-NAT activity and melatonin content increased with the duration of the dark period while the amplitude did not significantly change. In the field, annual variations in the amplitude of the nocturnal melatonin peak were observed with a maximum in April (highest temperature, low humidity and no grass availability, only seeds) and a minimum in November (high humidity, maximum green grass availability). The variations in the amplitude of the melatonin peak were not correlated with changes in AA-NAT HIOMT activities, suggesting that seasonal variations in the amplitude of the melatonin peak are not driven by these enzymes. Daytime injections of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, stimulated melatonin synthesis in January, April and June, but not in November. The annual differences in the amplitude of the melatonin peak as well as the seasonal differences in the response to an adrenergic stimulation suggest that environmental factors other than photoperiod, such as temperature, humidity and consequent food availability, could be important in the regulation of the annual variations in the pineal biosynthetic activity in this species.", 
    "180": "Levosimendan is a new calcium sensitizer developed for the treatment of congestive heart failure. Experimental studies indicate that levosimendan increases myocardial contractility and dilates both the peripheral and coronary vessels. Its positive inotropic effect is based on calcium-dependent binding of the drug to cardiac troponin C. It also acts as an opener of ATP-dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle, thus inducing vasodilation. Although levosimendan acts preferentially as a calcium sensitizer it has also demonstrated selective phosphodiesterase III inhibitory effects in vitro. However, this selective inhibition does not seem to contribute to the positive action at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Levosimendan has an active metabolite, OR-1896. Similarly to levosimendan, the metabolite exerts its positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects on myocardium and vasculature. The elimination half-life of levosimendan is about 1 hour. Thus, with intravenous administration, the parent drug rapidly disappears from the circulation after the infusion is stopped. The active metabolite, however, has a half-life of approximately 80 hours, and can be detected in circulation up to 2 weeks after stopping a 24-hour infusion of levosimendan. The intravenous formulation of levosimendan has been studied in several randomized comparative studies in patients with decompensated heart failure. Both patients with ischemic and non-ischemic etiology have participated in the studies. Levosimendan produces significant, dose-dependent increases in cardiac output, stroke volume and heart rate, and decreases in PCWP, mean blood pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean right atrial pressure and total peripheral resistance. With a loading dose, the effects on PCWP and cardiac ouput are seen within few minutes. There is no sign of development of tolerance even with a prolonged infusion up to 48 hours. Cardiac performance is improved with no significant increases in oxygen consumption or potentially malignant rhythm disorders. Due to the formation of an active metabolite, the hemodynamic effects are maintained up to several days after stopping levosimendan infusion. Compared to dobutamine, levosimendan produces similar increase in cardiac output but profoundly greater decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. On the contrary to dobutamine, the hemodynamic effects are not attenuated with concomitant beta-blocker use. Levosimendan has been shown to have favourable effects on symptoms of heart failure superior to placebo and at least comparable to dobutamine. Mortality and morbidity in levosimendan treated patients has been shown to be significantly lower when compared to dobutamine or placebo treated patients. The most common adverse events associated with levosimendan treatment are headache and hypotension, as a likely consequence of the vasodilating properties of the compound. In conclusion, levosimendan offers a new effective option for the treatment of acutely decompensated heart failure. Unlike traditional inotropes, levosimendan seems also to be safe in terms of morbidity and mortality.",

    "183": "A total of 72 trials (comprising 9094 patients) were selected and analyzed. No trial evaluating furosemide or spironolactone satisfied the inclusion criteria for this analysis. For SBP, the reduction was more marked with diuretics, calcium channel antagonists, and ACE inhibitors. Of all the drugs studied, indapamide SR gave the greatest SBP reduction (-22.2 mm Hg). Evaluated therapeutic classes had a similar magnitude of effect on DBP, i.e. reduction between -11.4 mm Hg with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and -10.3 mm Hg with angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists.", 
    "184": "Indapamide SR 1.5 mg appeared to be the most effective drug for a significant reduction in SBP within 2-3 months, which is an essential element in optimizing cardiovascular prevention among hypertensive patients. The clinical application of these results should take into consideration all the limitations discussed in this analysis.", 
    "185": "Major advances in the diagnostic, evaluation, and particularly surgical treatment of aortic regurgitation (AR) have redefined the role of medical treatment. In acute AR, aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the only life-saving treatment. Medical treatment may improve the hemodynamic state temporarily before surgery. Rationale of medical treatment in chronic AR is based on the natural history and pathophysiology of the disease. The primary goal is to optimize the time of the AVR. If there is any symptom and/or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, early AVR is required. Vasodilators should only be considered as a short-term treatment before surgery if there is evidence of severe heart failure or as a long-term treatment if AVR is contraindicated because of cardiac or noncardiac factors. In asymptomatic patients with severe chronic AR and normal LV function (even if the left ventricle is moderately dilated), vasodilators may prolong the compensated phase of chronic AR, although proof of their efficacy in delaying AVR is limited. Nifedipine is the best evidence-based treatment in this indication. ACE inhibitors are particularly useful for hypertensive patients with AR. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) may be indicated to slow the rate of aortic dilatation and delay the need for surgery in patients with AR associated with aortic root disease. Furthermore, they may improve cardiac performance by reducing cardiac volume and LV mass in patients with impaired LV function after AVR for AR."
