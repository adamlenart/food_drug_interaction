    "1": "This was a multi-institution, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, parallel-group study. After a full ophthalmic and glaucoma examination, a total of 110 NTG patients--55 undergoing therapy with BTFC and 55 0.5%, with timolol--participated in this study. Among them, 1 failed to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 10 revoked their consent to participate in the study, 3 had adverse reactions, and 1 had a drug adherence rate of less than 70%. Ultimately, a total of 95 patients--48 in the BTFC group and 47 in the 0.5% timolol group--completed the study. The study visits took place at baseline and at 4 and 12 weeks. Diurnal IOP was measured at 9 a.m., 11 a.m., and 5 p.m. during the baseline visit and the visit at 12 weeks after eye-drop instillation. At each follow-up visit, compliance was assessed. Throughout the study, all adverse events were recorded and monitored by the investigators.", 
    "2": "The average difference in IOP change measured at 11 a.m. 12 weeks after administration between the two groups was 2.10 \u00b1 2.59 mmHg. The BTFC group had a better IOP-lowering effect at all time points than did the 0.5% timolol group. The ratio of patients whose average IOP had decreased by >20% after 4 and 12 weeks was 50 and 56% in the BTFC group, respectively, whereas it was 29.41 and 23.53% in the 0.5% timolol group, respectively (p = 0.034, <0.001).",

    "4": "Cerebral cavernous malformations are more common than generally thought, affecting approximately 1 in every 250 adults. Most of these lesions are asymptomatic or have a relatively benign course, but a small minority behave aggressively and present with recurrent episodes of symptomatic hemorrhage. A safe and effective medical treatment option for the management of this latter group would be useful. Propranolol has recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of infantile hemangioma, a close pathologic counterpart of cavernous malformations. These results suggest a potential role for propranolol treatment in the management of patients with symptomatic cavernous malformations.", 
    "5": "Low-dose propranolol (20 mg, three times daily) was used to treat 2 adult female patients in their mid- to late fifties, both of whom had symptomatic cavernous malformations and a history of repeated hemorrhage. Serial magnetic resonance imaging studies after the initiation of propranolol demonstrated regression of the lesions and no evidence of recurrent hemorrhage.", 
    "6": "Propranolol may offer a safe and effective treatment for patients who have cavernous malformations with symptomatic hemorrhage. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", 
    "7": "Type A acute aortic dissection is a life-threatening vascular emergency because of its high morbidity and mortality. Platelet is a pivotal ingredient involved in the development of acute aortic dissection. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether mean platelet volume (MPV)/platelet count ratio predicts in-hospital complications and long-term mortality in type A acute aortic dissection. In this single-center and prospective cohort study, 106 consecutive patients with Stanford type A acute aortic dissection admitted to the hospital within 12\u200ah after onset were recruited. The best cut-off value of MPV/platelet count ratio predicting all-cause mortality was determined by the receiver operator characteristic analysis. Patients were divided into high (H-MPV/platelet count) and low (L-MPV/platelet count) groups based on the cut-off value of 7.49 (10\u200afl/10/l). Patients were followed up for 3.5 years. Of the 106 acute aortic dissection patients, 71 (67.0%) died during the study period, with a median follow-up duration of 570 days. Compared to the L-MPV/platelet count group, patients with H-MPV/platelet count had a higher risk of in-hospital complications including hypotension, hypoxemia, myocardial ischemia/infarction, conscious disturbance, pericardial tamponade, paraplegia, and poor survival (all P\u200a<\u200a0.05). In multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders, MPV/platelet count ratio was positively associated with the hazard of all-cause mortality, irrespective of interventions either with medication only or urgent surgery, and the hazard ratios were 2.81 (95% confidence interval 1.28-4.48) for the H-MPV/platelet count group when taking L-MPV/platelet count group as the reference (P\u200a=\u200a0.005). The MPV/platelet count ratio was a strong independent predictor for in-hospital complications and long-term mortality in patients with type A acute aortic dissection.", 
    "8": "Heart failure (HF) is a progressive disorder associated with impaired quality of life, high morbidity, mortality and frequent hospitalization and affects millions of people from all around the world. Despite further improvements in HF therapy, mortality and morbidity remains to be very high. The life-long treatment, frequent hospitalization, and sophisticated and very expensive device therapies for HF also leads a substantial economic burden on the health care system. Therefore, implementation of evidence-based guideline-recommended therapy is very important to overcome its worse clinical outcomes. However, HF therapy is a long process that has many drawbacks and sometimes HF guidelines cannot answers to every question which rises in everyday clinical practice. In this paper, commonly encountered questions, overlooked points, controversial issues, management strategies in grey zone and problems arising during follow up of a HF patient in real life clinical practice have been addressed in the form of expert opinions based on the available data in the literature.", 
    "9": "Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are the most common vascular tumor and arise from a hemangioma stem cell (HemSC). Propranolol has proved efficacious for problematic IHs. Propranolol is a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR) antagonist that can lower cAMP levels and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway downstream of \u03b2ARs. We found that HemSCs express \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR in proliferating IHs and determined the role of these \u03b2ARs and the downstream pathways in mediating propranolol's effects. In isolated HemSCs, propranolol suppressed cAMP levels and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Propranolol, used at doses of <10(-4) M, reduced cAMP levels and decreased HemSC proliferation and viability. Propranolol at \u226510(-5) M reduced cAMP levels and activated ERK1/2, and this correlated with HemSC apoptosis and cytotoxicity at \u226510(-4) M. Stimulation with a \u03b2AR agonist, isoprenaline, promoted HemSC proliferation and rescued the antiproliferative effects of propranolol, suggesting that propranolol inhibits \u03b2AR signaling in HemSCs. Treatment with a cAMP analog or a MAPK inhibitor partially rescued the HemSC cell viability suppressed by propranolol. A selective \u03b22AR antagonist mirrored propranolol's effects on HemSCs in a dose-dependent fashion, and a selective \u03b21AR antagonist had no effect, supporting a role for \u03b22AR signaling in IH pathobiology. In a mouse model of IH, propranolol reduced the vessel caliber and blood flow assessed by ultrasound Doppler and increased activation of ERK1/2 in IH cells. We have thus demonstrated that propranolol acts on HemSCs in IH to suppress proliferation and promote apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion via \u03b22AR perturbation, resulting in reduced cAMP and MAPK activation.", 
    "10": "The present study investigated the action of propranolol in infantile hemangiomas (IHs). IHs are the most common vascular tumor in children and have been proposed to arise from a hemangioma stem cell (HemSC). Propranolol, a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR) antagonist, has proven efficacy; however, understanding of its mechanism of action on HemSCs is limited. The presented data demonstrate that propranolol, via \u03b2AR perturbation, dose dependently suppresses cAMP levels and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, propranolol acts via perturbation of \u03b22AR, and not \u03b21AR, although both receptors are expressed in HemSCs. These results provide important insight into propranolol's action in IHs and can be used to guide the development of more targeted therapy.", 
    "11": "Long-term usage of the antiarrhythmic drug digoxin has been connected to lowered risk of prostate cancer. A recent study has suggested that beta-blockers might also have similar risk-decreasing effects. We evaluated the association between use of digoxin, beta-blocker sotalol, and other antiarrhythmic drugs and prostate cancer risk in a retrospective cohort study.", 
    "12": "Our study population consisted of men in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial during 1996-2012 (n = 78,615). During median follow-up of 12 years, 6,639 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed. The national prescription database was the source of the information of antiarrhythmic drug purchases. Data were analyzed using Cox regression method with medication use as a time-dependent variable.", 
    "13": "No association was found for overall prostate cancer risk with antiarrhythmic drug use (HR 1.05 95% CI 0.94-1.18). Neither sotalol (HR 0.97 95% CI 0.76-1.24) nor digoxin (HR 1.01 95% CI 0.87-1.16) users had a decreased risk of prostate cancer. Similar results were obtained for high-grade (Gleason 7-10) and metastatic prostate cancer. Nevertheless, the risk estimates for Gleason 7-10 prostate cancer tended to decrease by duration of digoxin use (p for trend = 0.052), suggesting that the drug may reduce the risk in long-term usage (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49-1.03). In analysis stratified by screening trial arm, the protective association against Gleason 7-10 disease was observed only in the screening arm (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12-0.84 for men who had used digoxin for 5 years or longer).", 
    "14": "Digoxin or other antiarrhythmic drugs are not associated with any clear decrease in prostate cancer risk. However, digoxin might have a benefit in long-term use by reducing risk of high-grade disease. Further research will be needed to evaluate possible effects on prostate cancer survival.",

Adrenergic receptor antagonists have been evaluated as antifibrotic drugs in rodent models of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of carvedilol and doxazosin on fibrosis/cirrhosis in a hamster animal model.", 
    "16": "Cirrhotic-induced hamsters were treated by daily administration of carvedilol and doxazosin for 6 weeks. Hepatic function and histological evaluation were conducted by measuring biochemical markers, including total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and albumin, and liver tissue slices. Additionally, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) immunohistochemistry was analyzed.", 
    "17": "Biochemical markers revealed that hepatic function was restored after treatment with doxazosin and carvedilol. Histological evaluation showed a decrease in collagen type I deposits and TGF-\u03b2-secreting cells.", 
    "18": "Taken together, these results suggest that the decrease in collagen type I following treatment with doxazosin or carvedilol is achieved by decreasing the profibrotic activities of TGF-\u03b2 via the blockage of \u03b11- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor. Consequently, a diminution of fibrotic tissue in the CCl4-induced model of cirrhosis is achieved.", 
    "19": "The left ventricular reverse remodeling (LVRR) in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and the treatment with carvedilol in infants with severe heart failure remain poorly understood.", 
    "20": "We reviewed the medical records of 5 infants around 12 months old referred to our hospital with severe heart failure due to DCM. Increased left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) by more than 10% and the percent of normal of left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (%LVDd) less than 120% were defined as LVRR in this study.", 
    "21": "DCM onset ranged from 8 to 16 months. Initial treatment of their acute heart failure was successful in all 5 but 4 patients relapsed despite the usual dose of carvedilol (induction 0.02-maintenance 0.4mg/kg/day), and developed worsening heart failure. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels which increased again after the acute treatment had fallen subsequent to discontinuing or decreasing carvedilol. Over 24 months, LVFS had increased from 11\u00b12% (mean\u00b1SD) to 34\u00b15% (p<0.05), and %LVDd decreased from 149\u00b127% to 108\u00b111% (p<0.05).", 
    "22": "LVRR was found at 2 years after the onset of DCM. Usual dose induction of carvedilol therapy can sometimes worsen heart failure after successful initial conventional treatment for the acute heart failure in DCM. Close control of carvedilol treatment may determine the prognosis of infantile DCM around 12 months old. It is prudent to increase low-dose carvedilol slowly corresponding with the BNP level.", 
    "23": "Cloud-point extraction (CPE) draws increasing interest in a number of analytical fields including bioanalysis, but combining CPE and LC-MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) in the determination of drugs in biological fluids such as plasma, serum or blood has not been reported so far. Bisoprolol was determined in human plasma by CPE using Trition X-114 as a surfactant and metoprolol as the internal standard. NaOH concentration, temperature and Trition X-114 concentration were optimized. All analyses were performed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). All validation experiments met international acceptance criteria and no significant matrix effect was observed. The compatibility of CPE and LC-ESI-MS/MS was confirmed using clinical plasma samples and appropriate statistical tests. The determination of bisoprolol concentration in human plasma in the range 1.0-70ngmL(-1) by the CPE method leads to the results which are equivalent to those obtained by the widely used liquid-liquid extraction method. The results revealed that a structural analogue may be an appropriate internal standard when CPE is used as the extraction technique. CPE offers significant practical advantages over the classical extraction methods, including a positive impact on the environment, therefore its wider application in future pharmacokinetic studies is justifiable.", 
    "24": "A recent individual patient data meta-analysis has shown that beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) who are in sinus rhythm but not in those who are in atrial fibrillation. Similar results applied also to cardiovascular death or first hospitalization for heart failure. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend beta-blockers in patients with HFrEF regardless of baseline rhythm. However, despite improving symptoms, the prognostic benefits of beta-blockers have now been questioned by these authors in patients with HFrEF and atrial fibrillation. In this review we comment the findings of this study.", 
    "25": "Strategies aimed at mimicking or enhancing the action of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) therapeutically improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS); however, it is not clear whether GLP-1 directly drives insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. Here, we examined the mechanisms by which GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion in mouse and human islets. We found that GLP-1 enhances GSIS at a half-maximal effective concentration of 0.4 pM. Moreover, we determined that GLP-1 activates PLC, which increases submembrane diacylglycerol and thereby activates PKC, resulting in membrane depolarization and increased action potential firing and subsequent stimulation of insulin secretion. The depolarizing effect of GLP-1 on electrical activity was mimicked by the PKC activator PMA, occurred without activation of PKA, and persisted in the presence of PKA inhibitors, the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide, and the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker isradipine; however, depolarization was abolished by lowering extracellular Na(+). The PKC-dependent effect of GLP-1 on membrane potential and electrical activity was mediated by activation of Na(+)-permeable TRPM4 and TRPM5 channels by mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) from thapsigargin-sensitive Ca(2+) stores. Concordantly, GLP-1 effects were negligible in Trpm4 or Trpm5 KO islets. These data provide important insight into the therapeutic action of GLP-1 and suggest that circulating levels of this hormone directly stimulate insulin secretion by \u03b2 cells.", 
    "26": "Disruption of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor prolonged life span in mice. Since aging-related decline in skeletal muscle function was retarded in Atgr1a(-/-) mice, we examined the role of AT1 receptor in muscle regeneration after injury. Administration of AT1 receptor blocker irbesartan increased the size of regenerating myofibers, decreased fibrosis, and enhanced functional muscle recovery after cryoinjury. We recently reported that complement C1q, secreted by macrophages, activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and promoted aging-related decline in regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle. Notably, irbesartan induced M2 polarization of macrophages, but reduced C1q expression in cryoinjured muscles and in cultured macrophage cells. Irbesartan inhibited up-regulation of Axin2, a downstream gene of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, in cryoinjured muscles. In addition, topical administration of C1q reversed beneficial effects of irbesartan on skeletal muscle regeneration after injury. These results suggest that AT1 receptor blockade improves muscle repair and regeneration through down-regulation of the aging-promoting C1q-Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.", 
    "27": "Lipids are emerging as key regulators of membrane protein structure and activity. These effects can be attributed either to the modification of bilayer properties (thickness, curvature and surface tension) or to the binding of specific lipids to the protein surface. For G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the effects of phospholipids on receptor structure and activity remain poorly understood. Here we reconstituted purified \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22R) in high-density lipoparticles to systematically characterize the effect of biologically relevant phospholipids on receptor activity. We observed that the lipid headgroup type affected ligand binding (agonist and antagonist) and receptor activation. Specifically, phosphatidylgycerol markedly favored agonist binding and facilitated receptor activation, whereas phosphatidylethanolamine favored antagonist binding and stabilized the inactive state of the receptor. We then showed that these effects could be recapitulated with detergent-solubilized lipids, demonstrating that the functional modulation occurred in the absence of a bilayer. Our data suggest that phospholipids act as direct allosteric modulators of GPCR activity.",

    "29": "We included Medicare beneficiaries in the 40% random sample denominator file continuously enrolled in fee-for-service benefits for 2010 or 2011 (7,961,201 person-years) and extracted data on prescription fills for oral antibiotics that treat respiratory pathogens. We collapsed the data to the state level so they could be merged with monthly flu activity data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Linear regression, adjusted for state-specific mean antibiotic use and demographic characteristics, was used to estimate how antibiotic prescribing responded to state-specific flu activity. Flu-activity associated antibiotic use varied substantially across states-lowest in Vermont and Connecticut, highest in Mississippi and Florida. There was a robust positive correlation between flu-activity associated prescribing and use of medications that often cause adverse events in the elderly (0.755; P<0.001), whereas there was a strong negative correlation with beta-blocker use after a myocardial infarction (-0.413; P=0.003).", 
    "30": "Adjusted flu-activity associated antibiotic use was positively correlated with prescribing high-risk medications to the elderly and negatively correlated with beta-blocker use after myocardial infarction. These findings suggest that excessive antibiotic use reflects low-quality prescribing. They imply that practice and policy solutions should go beyond narrow, antibiotic specific, approaches to encourage evidence-based prescribing for the elderly Medicare population.",

Because of its efficacy and once-a-day dosing, it is commonly preferred in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and intolerance to warfarin in clinical practice. However, it can result in some adverse effects such as bleeding, rashes and liver injury. Here, we described a very rare adverse reaction of rivaroxaban, jaundice due to intrahepatic cholestasis, appeared in a 71-year-old male patient after taking rivaroxaban.",

    "37": "Fifty consecutive patients with recent onset HFrEF (<30 days) performed a standardized exercise protocol with respiratory gas analysis at baseline as well as after 6 and 12 months. Patients participated in a quality of care programme aiming to achieve guideline-recommended target doses for beta-blocker therapy. At baseline, 6 and 12 months, 36%, 70% and 62% of patients, respectively, had a resting HR<70 bpm. Beta-blocker dose after 12 months was comparable in patients with resting HR<70 versus \u226570 bpm (P value=0.631). However, with similar dose uptitration, the former versus the latter had a significantly larger HR reduction (17\u00b122 versus 4\u00b115 bpm; P value=0.027). Peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) was significantly higher when resting HR was <70 versus \u226570 bpm (17.5\u00b15.5 versus 14.4\u00b13.3 mL/min/kg, respectively; P value=0.038). Similar results were observed after 6 months. Patients in whom resting HR decreased at follow-up compared to baseline had a 2.0\u00b13.2 mL/min/kg increase in VO2max compared to a 1.2\u00b17.7 mL/min/kg increase in patients who did not demonstrate a lower resting HR (P value=0.033).",

    "39": "Carvedilol functions as a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (AR)/\u03b11-AR antagonist that is used for treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Carvedilol has been shown to function as an inverse agonist, inhibiting G protein activation while stimulating \u03b2-arrestin-dependent signaling and inducing receptor desensitization. In the present study, short-circuit current (Isc) measurements using human airway epithelial cells revealed that, unlike \u03b2-AR agonists, which increase Isc, carvedilol decreases basal and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-stimulated current. The decrease in Isc resulted from inhibition of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The carvedilol effect was abolished by pretreatment with the \u03b22-AR antagonist ICI-118551, but not the \u03b21-AR antagonist atenolol or the \u03b11-AR antagonist prazosin, indicating that its inhibitory effect on Isc was mediated through interactions with apical \u03b22-ARs. However, the carvedilol effect was blocked by pretreatment with the microtubule-disrupting compound nocodazole. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry experiments and measurements of apical CFTR expression by Western blot analysis of biotinylated membranes revealed a decrease in the level of CFTR protein in monolayers treated with carvedilol but no significant change in monolayers treated with epinephrine. These results demonstrate that carvedilol binding to apical \u03b22-ARs inhibited CFTR current and transepithelial anion secretion by a mechanism involving a decrease in channel expression in the apical membrane.",

These analogues showed potency and physicochemical and in vitro ADME-tox profiles comparable to propranolol. In addition, both benzazaborinine analogues showed excellent bioavailability and brain penetration following subcutaneous administration in a pharmacokinetic study in rats. These studies unveil the potential of aromatic azaborinines as bioisosteric replacements of naphthalene in drug discovery programs.", 
    "41": "Anticancer drugs (ACDs) exhibit high biological activity, they are cytotoxic, genotoxic, and are constantly released into the environment as a result of incomplete metabolism. Consequently they pose a serious threat to the environment and human health due to their carcinogenic, mutagenic and/or reproductive toxicity properties. Knowledge of their bioavailability, including their sorption to soils and their impact on the soil-groundwater pathway, is crucial for their risk assessment. Laboratory batch and column leaching tests are important tools for determining the release potential of contaminants from soil or waste material. Batch and column tests were carried out with soils differing in physicochemical properties, each spiked with cyclophosphamide (CK) or ifosfamide (IF). Moreover, due to the fact that environmental pollutants may occur as coexisting compounds in the soil the mobility evaluation for ACDs in the mixture with metoprolol (MET; \u03b2-blocker) as a co-contaminant was performed. In order to assess appropriateness, the batch and column tests were compared. The release depended on the properties of both the soil and the presence of co-contaminants. The faster release was observed for coarse-grained soil with the smallest organic matter content (MS soil: 90% decrease in concentration until liquid-to-solid ratio (L/S) of 0.3 L kg(-1) for all tests' layout) than for loamy sand (LS soil: 90% decrease in concentration until ratio L/S of 0.75 L kg(-1)). ACDs are highly mobile in soil systems. Furthermore, the decrease of mobility of ifosfamide was observed with the presence of a co-contaminant (metoprolol) in both of the soils (in MS soil a decrease of 29%; in LS soil a decrease of 26%). The mobility of cyclophosphamide does not depend on the presence of a contaminant for MS soil, but also exhibits a decrease of 21% in LS soil.", 
    "42": "The therapy of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, may be associated with a number of cutaneous adverse effects, including psoriasis-like, eczema-like, and lichenoid eruptions. Other rare skin complications are neutrophilic dermatoses such as amicrobial pustulosis of the folds (APF), which is a chronic relapsing pustular disorder classified in this spectrum.The authors analyzed clinical, histopathologic, and cytokine expression profiles of 3 inflammatory bowel disease patients with APF triggered by adalimumab (patient 1) and infliximab (patients 2 and 3).All 3 patients presented with sterile pustules involving the cutaneous folds, genital regions, and scalp 6 months after starting adalimumab (patient 1) and 9 months after starting infliximab (patients 2 and 3). Histology was characterized by epidermal spongiform pustules with a dermal neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrate. Tumor necrosis factor blocker withdrawal associated with topical and systemic corticosteroids induced complete remission of APF in all 3 patients. The expressions of interleukin (IL)-1 beta and its receptors as well as TNF alpha and its receptors were significantly higher in APF than in controls. Also IL-17, leukocyte selectin, and chemokines, such as IL-8, [C-X-C motif] chemokine ligand 1/2/3 (C\u200a=\u200acysteine, X\u200a=\u200aany amino acid), [C-X-C motif] chemokine ligand 16 (C\u200a=\u200acysteine, X\u200a=\u200aany amino acid), and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) were significantly overexpressed. Finally, the authors found significant overexpression of both metalloproteinases 2/9 and their inhibitors 1/2.The observation of 3 patients with APF following anti-TNF therapy expands not only the clinical context of APF but also the spectrum of anti-TNF side effects. Overexpression of cytokines/chemokines and molecules amplifying the inflammatory network supports the view that APF is autoinflammatory in origin.",

SCR-1693 also inhibited the increase of AChE activity in the mouse hippocampus. SCR-1693 was more effective than donepezil and memantine in preventing A\u03b225-35-induced long-term and short-term memory impairment, maintaining the basal transmission of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, and sustaining LTP in mouse hippocampus.

ACEI doses were at 62\u00a0% of the guideline recommended target doses, BBs at 46\u00a0%, while MRAs were sufficiently highly dosed. The guideline adherence indicator (GAI-3) was only 22\u00a0%. In Stage II, GPs in all 15 practices were interviewed, and health record documentation deficits and patients' contraindications were taken into account. This increased the percentage of patients correctly prescribed ACEIs/ARBs to 87\u00a0%, BBs to 84\u00a0% and GAI-3 to 56\u00a0%. MRAs exhibited the most frequent contraindications, but remained underprescribed. Many GPs seemed not to be aware of the therapeutic value of MRAs or the need to reach target doses of the indicated drug classes. Patients-interviewed in Stage III-reported good tolerability of HF-drugs and generally good compliance, although 11\u00a0% discontinued HF-medication on their own.",

    "56": "Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibit exaggerated emotional reactions to threatening stimuli, which may represent deregulated fear-conditioning, associated with long-term adaptations in the sympathetic nervous system. Within a repeated measures design, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was employed to investigate neural responses to threat in PTSD participants (N=7), during the presentation of emotional facial expressions. Scans were separated by 6 weekly reconsolidation impairment treatment sessions, consisting of traumatic memory reactivation under the influence of propranolol. Greater activation before versus after treatment emerged in the thalamus and amygdala during fearful versus neutral face processing. Furthermore, participants showed greater activation after versus before treatment in the right anterior cingulate, during fearful relative to happy face processing. PTSD symptoms significantly improved (d=1.75), post-treatment. These preliminary results suggest that aberrant emotional responding is modulated by noradrenergic plasticity within the amygdala-prefrontal cortex circuit, a neural substrate for the pharmacological treatment of PTSD.",

The patient was a 61-year-old man with intractable heart failure. Echocardiography showed a low ejection fraction of 22% but no dyssynchrony. Because he had been hospitalized many times for congestive heart failure despite \u03b2-blocker and diuretic treatment, we decided to use CRT. However, after implantation of the CRT device, the QRS complex widened abnormally, and his symptoms worsened. He was re-admitted 2 months after CRT implantation. We examined the pacemaker status and optimized the AV delay to obtain a \"narrow\" QRS complex. The patient's condition improved dramatically after the AV delay optimization. His clinical status has been good, and there has been no subsequent hospitalization. Our case points to the effectiveness of CRT in patients with a narrow QRS complex and to the importance of AV optimization for successful CRT.",

Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) laminated buccal sponges loaded with CVD microemulsions (CVD-ME) were exploited to surmount such limitations. Six pseudoternary-phase diagrams were constructed using Capmul\u00ae MCM C8/Capmul\u00ae PG8, Tween\u00ae 80, propylene glycol and water. Six CVD-ME systems (0.625% w/v) were incorporated into HPMC core sponges backed with Ethocel\u00ae layers. The sponges were preliminary evaluated via FT-IR, DSC and XRD. The surface pH, morphology and in vitro drug release studies were evaluated. In vivo mucoadhesion and absorption studies of the best achieved laminated sponges (F4) were assessed in healthy volunteers. CVD-ME systems displayed nano-spherical clear droplets. The sponges showed interconnecting porous matrices through which CVD was dispersed in amorphous state. No intermolecular interaction was detected between CVD and HPMC. The surface pH values were almost neutral. The sponges loaded with CVD-ME systems showed more sustained-release profiles than those loaded with CVD-powder. Compared to Dilatrend\u00ae tablets, the significantly (P<0.05) higher bioavailability (1.5 folds), delayed Tmax and prolonged MRT(0-\u221e) unraveled the dual-potential of F4 sponges for water-insoluble drugs, like CVD, in improving drug oral bioavailability and in controlling drug release kinetics via buccal mucosa.",

There is a continuing need to develop nondopaminergic approaches to treat Parkinsonism. One such approach is to use medications that normalize dopamine depletion-related firing abnormalities in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry. In this study, we assessed the potential of a specific T-type calcium channel blocker (ML218) to eliminate pathologic burst patterns of firing in the basal ganglia-receiving territory of the motor thalamus in Parkinsonian monkeys. We also carried out an anatomical study, demonstrating that the immunoreactivity for T-type calcium channels is strongly expressed in the motor thalamus in normal and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys. At the electron microscopic level, dendrites accounted for >90% of all tissue elements that were immunoreactive for voltage-gated calcium channel, type 3.2-containing T-type calcium channels in normal and Parkinsonian monkeys. Subsequent in vivo electrophysiologic studies in awake MPTP-treated Parkinsonian monkeys demonstrated that intrathalamic microinjections of ML218 (0.5 \u03bcl of a 2.5-mM solution, injected at 0.1-0.2 \u03bcl/min) partially normalized the thalamic activity by reducing the proportion of rebound bursts and increasing the proportion of spikes in non-rebound bursts. The drug also attenuated oscillatory activity in the 3-13-Hz frequency range and increased gamma frequency oscillations. However, ML218 did not normalize Parkinsonism-related changes in firing rates and oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range. Whereas the described changes are promising, a more complete assessment of the cellular and behavioral effects of ML218 (or similar drugs) is needed for a full appraisal of their anti-Parkinsonian potential.",

Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is the predominant metabolizing enzyme of these two drugs. Since the first description of a CYP2D6 sparteinedebrisoquine polymorphism in the mid-seventies, substantial genetic heterogeneity has been reported in the human CYP2D6 gene, with ~100 different polymorphisms identified to date. Some of these polymorphisms render the enzyme completely inactive while others do not modify its activity. Based on all the identified variants, four metabolizer phenotypes are nowadays used to characterize drug metabolism via CYP2D6 in humans: ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM); extensive metabolizer (EM); intermediate metabolizer (IM); and poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes. As a consequence of these CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes, pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of carvedilol and metoprolol can range from therapeutically ineffective levels (in the UM patients) to excessive (overdose) and potentially toxic concentrations (in PM patients). This, in turn, can result in elevated risks for either treatment failure (in terms of blood pressure reduction of hypertensive patients and of improving survival and cardiovascular function of heart failure patients) or for adverse effects (e.g. hypotension and bradycardia). The present review will discuss the impact of these CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms on the therapeutic responses of cardiovascular patients treated with either of these two \u03b2-blockers. In addition, the potential advantages and disadvantages of implementing CYP2D6 genetic testing in the clinic to guide/personalize therapy with these two drugs will be discussed.",

KI myocytes showed shorter diastolic sarcomere length at baseline, stronger inotropic response to ISO, and drastic drop of diastolic sarcomere length under increased workload. Ranolazine attenuated ISO responses in WT and KI cells and prevented workload-induced diastolic failure in KI. Late Na(+) current density was diminished and insensitive to ranolazine in KI cardiomyocytes. Ca(2+) sensitivity of skinned KI trabeculae was slightly decreased by ranolazine.

The present study was designed to investigate roles of adrenergic signaling and the endogenous hydrogen sulfide producing enzyme cystathionine \u03b2-synthetase (CBS) in a previously validated rat model of IBS induced by neonatal colonic inflammation (NCI). Here we showed that NCI-induced visceral hypersensitivity (VH) was significantly attenuated by \u03b22 subunit inhibitor but not by \u03b21 or \u03b23 or \u03b1 subunit inhibitor. NCI markedly elevated plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration without alteration in expression of \u03b22 subunit receptors in dorsal root ganglion (DRGs) innervating the colon. In addition, NCI markedly enhanced TRPV1 and CBS expression in the colon DRGs. CBS inhibitor AOAA reversed the upregulation of TRPV1 in NCI rats. In vitro experiments showed that incubation of DRG cells with NE markedly enhanced expression of TRPV1, which was reversed by application of AOAA. Incubation of DRG cells with the H2S donor NaHS greatly enhanced TRPV1 expression. Collectively, these data suggest that activation of adrenergic signaling by NCI sensitizes TRPV1 channel activity, which is likely mediated by upregulation of CBS expression in peripheral sensory neurons, thus contributing to chronic visceral hypersensitivity.",

Mice expressing Akt/PKB/SGK-resistant GSK3\u03b1/GSK3\u03b2 (gsk3(KI)) exhibit enhanced sympathetic nervous activity and phosphaturia with decreased bone density. Hormones participating in phosphate homeostasis include fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, a bone-derived hormone that inhibits 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3; calcitriol) formation and phosphate reabsorption in the kidney and counteracts vascular calcification and aging. FGF23 secretion is stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system. We studied the role of GSK3-controlled sympathetic activity in FGF23 production and phosphate metabolism. Serum FGF23, 1,25(OH)2D3, and urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) were measured by ELISA, and serum and urinary phosphate and calcium were measured by photometry in gsk3(KI) and gsk3(WT) mice, before and after 1 wk of oral treatment with the \u03b2-blocker propranolol. Urinary VMA excretion, serum FGF23, and renal phosphate and calcium excretion were significantly higher, and serum 1,25(OH)2D3 and phosphate concentrations were lower in gsk3(KI) mice than in gsk3(WT) mice. Propranolol treatment decreased serum FGF23 and loss of renal calcium and phosphate and increased serum phosphate concentration in gsk3(KI) mice. We conclude that Akt/PKB/SGK-sensitive GSK3 inhibition participates in the regulation of FGF23 release, 1,25(OH)2D3 formation, and thus mineral metabolism, by controlling the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.",

Results showed that ozagrel, a TXS blocker, suppressed NNK-induced lung tumors in mice. The expressions of CD133 and ALDH1A1 were positively associated with TXS. Similar results were observed in human NSCLC tumor samples. NNK significantly stimulated TXS and enhanced the generation of LCSCs, evident by the upregulation of CD133 and ALDH1A1 expression, and the increase in the number and size of tumor spheres. NNK also promoted the expression of LCSC-related molecules including \u03b2-catenin and Nanog. All these NNK-mediated effects could be offset by ozagrel. In the colony formation assay, NNK increased whereas ozagrel decreased the number of colonies. Collectively, LCSCs and TXS participate in NNK-induced lung cancer.

During a median follow-up of 23 months, 10 (29%) of 35 patients in the endoscopy + \u03b2-blocker group, as compared to 0 of 37 (0%) patients in the TIPS group, developed variceal rebleeding (P = 0.001). Mortality (TIPS 32% vs. endoscopy 26%; P = 0.418) and treatment failure (TIPS 38% vs. endoscopy 34%; P = 0.685) did not differ between groups. Early hepatic encephalopathy (within 1 year) was significantly more frequent in the TIPS group (35% vs. 14%; P = 0.035), but during long-term follow-up this difference diminished (38% vs. 23%; P = 0.121).",

    "159": "The normal physiologic stress mechanism, mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, causes a release of the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine. Preclinical data have demonstrated an effect on tumor progression and metastasis via the sympathetic nervous system mediated primarily through the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) pathway. In\u00a0vitro data have shown an increase in tumor growth, migration, tumor angiogenesis, and metastatic spread in breast cancer through activation of the \u03b2-AR. Retrospective cohort studies on the clinical outcomes of \u03b2-blockers in breast cancer outcomes showed no clear consensus. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of \u03b2-blockers on breast cancer outcomes. A systematic review was performed using the Cochrane library and PubMed. Publications between the dates of January 2010 and December 2013 were identified. Available hazard ratios (HRs) were extracted for breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer death, and all-cause mortality and pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. A total of 7 studies contained results for at least 1 of the outcomes of breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer death, or all-cause mortality in breast cancer patients receiving \u03b2-blockers. In the 5 studies that contained results for breast cancer recurrence, there was no statistically significant risk reduction (HR, 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-1.13). Breast cancer death results were contained in 4 studies, which also suggested a significant reduction in risk (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32-0.80). Among the 4\u00a0studies that reported all-cause mortality, there was no significant effect of \u03b2-blockers on risk (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.75-1.37). Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that the use of \u03b2-blockers significantly reduced risk of breast cancer death among women with breast cancer.", 
    "160": "The mechanism of therapeutic efficacy of flecainide for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is unclear. Model predictions suggest that Na(+) channel effects are insufficient to explain flecainide efficacy in CPVT. This study represents a first step toward predicting therapeutic mechanisms of drug efficacy in the setting of CPVT and then using these mechanisms to guide modelling and simulation to predict alternative drug therapies. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterized by fatal ventricular arrhythmias in structurally normal hearts during \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Current treatment strategies include \u03b2-blockade, flecainide and ICD implementation--none of which is fully effective and each comes with associated risk. Recently, flecainide has gained considerable interest in CPVT treatment, but its mechanism of action for therapeutic efficacy is unclear. In this study, we performed in silico mutagenesis to construct a CPVT model and then used a computational modelling and simulation approach to make predictions of drug mechanisms and efficacy in the setting of CPVT. Experiments were carried out to validate model results. Our simulations revealed that Na(+) channel effects are insufficient to explain flecainide efficacy in CPVT. The pure Na(+) channel blocker lidocaine and the antianginal ranolazine were additionally tested and also found to be ineffective. When we tested lower dose combination therapy with flecainide, \u03b2-blockade and CaMKII inhibition, our model predicted superior therapeutic efficacy than with flecainide monotherapy. Simulations indicate a polytherapeutic approach may mitigate side-effects and proarrhythmic potential plaguing CPVT pharmacological management today. Importantly, our prediction of a novel polytherapy for CPVT was confirmed experimentally. Our simulations suggest that flecainide therapeutic efficacy in CPVT is unlikely to derive from primary interactions with the Na(+) channel, and benefit may be gained from an alternative multi-drug regimen.",

It is crucial for integrin-mediated platelet adhesion and aggregation and disulfide bond exchange is necessary for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 activation. However, the role of disulfide bond exchange and PDI in the post-ligation phase of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 mediated cell adhesion has yet to be determined.",

    "165": "Multidrug resistance is a principal mechanism by which tumors become resistant to structurally and functionally unrelated anticancer drugs. Resistance to chemotherapy has been correlated with overexpression of p-glycoprotein (p-gp), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of membrane transporters. P-gp mediates resistance to a broad-spectrum of anticancer drugs including doxorubicin, taxol, and vinca alkaloids by actively expelling the drugs from cells. Use of specific inhibitors/blocker of p-gp in combination with clinically important anticancer drugs has emerged as a new paradigm for overcoming multidrug resistance. The aim of this paper is to review p-gp regulation by dietary nutraceuticals and to correlate this dietary nutraceutical induced-modulation of p-gp with activity of anticancer drugs.",

Sodium channel blockers are discussed with an emphasis on recently identified specialized uses. Beta blockers, amiodarone, sotalol, and dofetilide are discussed together in the context of structural heart disease, because they do not increase mortality in this group of patients. Other medications found to reduce ventricular arrhythmia burden are discussed last.", 
    "168": "Since most patients with ventricular arrhythmias have structural heart disease, pharmacologic treatment is limited to amiodarone, d-,l-sotalol, and dofetilide (off-label indication), in conjunction with defibrillator implantation. While amiodarone has superior reduction in arrhythmias, its long-term extracardiac toxicities can cause significant morbidity. A trial of sotalol is reasonable if there are no contraindications, recognizing that over 20% of patients have to discontinue it because of adverse effects. Beta blockers are first line therapy for most patients. Genetic testing is particularly informative regarding treatment approach in long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. Research should continue to focus on developing more effective antiarrhythmic medications with less long-term toxicity.",

For those arrhythmias that are unresponsive to conservative therapy, such as vagal maneuvers or life style interventions, or that present a higher risk to the mother or fetus, medical therapy may be necessary. In each case, the patient and provider must carefully consider the risks and benefits of a particular therapy. This requires an understanding of the data regarding the safety and efficacy of any particular drug, which in some cases may be extensive and in others quite limited. Fortunately, options exist for the treatment of arrhythmias during pregnancy.",

Although a rare disease, its recognition is important because of its high mortality rate when left untreated. We report an index case of a 32-year-old woman who presented with recurrent syncope. The diagnosis was confirmed by exercise-induced polymorphic ventricular premature beats and episodes of non-sustained VT, in the absence of structural heart abnormalities. She remained event free with beta-blocker therapy. CPVT is a potentially life-threatening disease and should be considered in the case of recurrent syncope, in young individuals. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and exercise testing, which is the gold standard. Therapy is mandatory in all diagnosed individuals. Exercise testing in first-degree relatives is recommended, even in the case of a mutation-negative index patient.",

Thirty male, adult B6 mice were categorized into group 1 (untreated control), group 2 [DOX treatment (15 mg/every other day for 2 weeks, i.p.], and group 3 [carvedilol (15 mg/kg/d, from day 7 after DOX treatment for 28 days)], and euthanized by day 35 after DOX treatment. By day 35, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly lower in group 2 than in groups 1 and 3, and significantly lower in group 3 than in group 1, whereas the left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and LV end-systolic dimensions showed an opposite pattern to the LVEF among the three groups. The protein expressions of fibrotic (Smad3, TGF-\u03b2), apoptotic (BAX, cleaved caspase 3, PARP), DNA damage (\u03b3-H2AX), oxidative stress (oxidized protein), mitochondrial damage (cytosolic cytochrome-C), heart failure (brain natriuretic peptide), and hypertrophic (\u03b2-MHC) biomarkers of the LV myocardium showed an opposite pattern to the LVEF among the three groups. The protein expressions of antifibrotic (BMP-2, Smad1/5), \u03b1-MHC, and phosphorylated-Akt showed an identical pattern to the LVEF among the three groups. The microscopic findings of fibrotic and collagen-deposition areas and the numbers of \u03b3-H2AX(+) and 53BP1(+) cells in the LV myocardium exhibited an opposite pattern, whereas the numbers of endothelial cell (CD31(+), vWF(+)) markers showed an identical pattern to the LVEF among the three groups. Cardiac stem cell markers (C-kit(+) and Sca-1(+) cells) were significantly and progressively increased from group 1 to group 3. Additionally, the in vitro study showed carvedilol treatment significantly inhibited DOX-induced cardiomyoblast DNA (CD90/XRCC1(+), CD90/53BP1(+), and r-H2AX(+) cells) damage.

In ATMOSPHERE, patients with diabetes differed in numerous ways from those without. Patients with diabetes were older and had worse heart failure status but a similar left ventricular ejection fraction (mean 28%); they had a higher body mass index and more co-morbidity, especially hypertension and coronary heart disease.

    "175": "The purpose of this work was to explore the particle size reduction effect of carvedilol on dissolution and absorption. Three suspensions containing different sized particles were prepared by antisolvent precipitation method or in combination with an ultrasonication process. The suspensions were characterized for particle size, surface morphology, and crystalline state. The crystalline form of carvedilol was changed into amorphous form after antisolvent precipitation. The dissolution rate of carvedilol was significantly accelerated by a reduction in particle size. The intestinal absorption of carvedilol nanosuspensions was greatly improved in comparison with microsuspensions and solution in the in situ single-pass perfusion experiment. The in vivo evaluation demonstrated that carvedilol nanosuspensions and microsuspensions exhibited markedly increased C(max) (2.09- and 1.48-fold) and AUC(0-t) (2.11- and 1.51-fold), and decreased T(max) (0.34- and 0.48-fold) in contrast with carvedilol coarse suspensions. Moreover, carvedilol nanosuspensions showed good biocompatibility with the rat gastric mucosa in in vivo gastrointestinal irritation test. The entire results implicated that the dissolution rate and the oral absorption of carvedilol were significantly affected by the particle size. Particle size reduction to form nanosized particles was found to be an efficient method for improving the oral bioavailability of carvedilol.", 
    "176": "The major mission of the ovarian follicle is the timely production of the mature fertilizable oocyte, and this is achieved by gonadotropin-regulated, gap junction-mediated cell-cell communication between the oocyte and surrounding nurturing granulosa cells. We have demonstrated that FSH and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) stimulate Gja1 gene-encoded connexin43 (Cx43) gap junction formation/function in rat ovarian granulosa cells is important for their induction of steroidogenesis; additionally, cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA)- and calcium-calcineurin-sensitive cAMP response element-binding (CREB) coactivator CRTC2 plays a crucial role during steroidogenesis. This study was to explore the potential molecular mechanism whereby FSH and TGF\u03b21 regulate Cx43 synthesis and degradation, particularly the involvement of CRTC2 and ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. Primary culture of granulosa cells from ovarian antral follicles of gonadotropin-primed immature rats was used. At 48\u200ah post-treatment, FSH plus TGF\u03b21 increased Cx43 level and gap junction function in a PKA- and calcineurin-dependent manner, and TGF\u03b21 acting through its type I receptor modulated FSH action. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis reveals FSH induced an early-phase (45 min) and FSH+TGF\u03b21 further elicited a late-phase (24 h) increase in CRTC2, CREB and CBP binding to the Gja1 promoter. Additionally, FSH+TGF\u03b21 increased the half-life of hyper-phosphorylated Cx43 (Cx43-P2). Also, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented the brefeldin A (blocker of protein transport through Golgi)-reduced Cx43-P2 level and membrane Cx43 gap junction plaque. This is associated with FSH+TGF\u03b21-attenuated Cx43 interaction with Nedd4 and Cx43 ubiquitination. In all, this study uncovers that FSH and TGF\u03b21 upregulation of Cx43 gap junctions in ovarian granulosa cells critically involves enhancing CRTC2/CREB/CBP-mediated Cx43 expression and attenuating ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-mediated proteosomal degradation of Cx43 protein.",

Unexpectedly, Marfan mice treated with CCBs show accelerated aneurysm expansion, rupture, and premature lethality. This effect is both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) dependent and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor (AT1R) dependent. We have identified protein kinase C beta (PKC\u03b2) as a critical mediator of this pathway and demonstrate that the PKC\u03b2 inhibitor enzastaurin, and the clinically available anti-hypertensive agent hydralazine, both normalize aortic growth in Marfan mice, in association with reduced PKC\u03b2 and ERK1/2 activation. Furthermore, patients with Marfan syndrome and other forms of inherited thoracic aortic aneurysm taking CCBs display increased risk of aortic dissection and need for aortic surgery, compared to patients on other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "178": "Propranolol administration through buccal route offers some distinct advantages thanks to the easy access to the oral mucosa, fast onset of action, and avoidance of hepatic and intestinal degradation mechanisms. To overcome the effective removal existing in the buccal cavity, mucoadhesive delivery systems are considered a promising approach as they facilitate a close contact with the buccal mucosa. The aim of this study was to prepare mucoadhesive tablets based on chitosan/gelatin microparticles for buccal delivery of propranolol hydrochloride. Spray-dried microparticles were prepared with different chitosan-gelatin weight ratios and characterized in terms of yield and morphology. Microparticles were subsequently compressed with the drug to obtain loaded buccal tablets. In vitro water uptake, mucoadhesion, release, and permeation tests were performed to investigate tablet ability to hydrate, to adhere to the mucosa, and to deliver drug through buccal mucosa. Microparticles showed a different morphology based on the different chitosan-gelatin weight ratios. Moreover, buccal tablets based on the prepared microparticles showed different technological and functional characteristics in virtue of their composition. In particular, tablets with an excess of chitosan showed the best mucoadhesive properties, allowed the permeation of the greatest drug amount among all formulations, and could be promising for buccal administration of propranolol hydrochloride.",

All four cardiovascular disease medicines were available in 61 (95%) of 64 urban and 27 (90%) of 30 rural communities in high-income countries, 53 (80%) of 66 urban and 43 (73%) of 59 rural communities in upper middle-income countries, 69 (62%) of 111 urban and 42 (37%) of 114 rural communities in lower middle-income countries, eight (25%) of 32 urban and one (3%) of 30 rural communities in low-income countries (excluding India), and 34 (89%) of 38 urban and 42 (81%) of 52 rural communities in India. The four cardiovascular disease medicines were potentially unaffordable for 0\u00b714% of households in high-income countries (14 of 9934 households), 25% of upper middle-income countries (6299 of 24,776), 33% of lower middle-income countries (13,253 of 40,023), 60% of low-income countries (excluding India; 1976 of 3312), and 59% households in India (9939 of 16,874). In low-income and middle-income countries, patients with previous cardiovascular disease were less likely to use all four medicines if fewer than four were available (odds ratio [OR] 0\u00b716, 95% CI 0\u00b704-0\u00b757). In communities in which all four medicines were available, patients were less likely to use medicines if the household potentially could not afford them (0\u00b716, 0\u00b704-0\u00b755).", 
    "206": "Secondary prevention medicines are unavailable and unaffordable for a large proportion of communities and households in upper middle-income, lower middle-income, and low-income countries, which have very low use of these medicines. Improvements to the availability and affordability of key medicines is likely to enhance their use and help towards achieving WHO's targets of 50% use of key medicines by 2025.",

    "208": "Numerous studies have reported the presence of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) and expression of its lectin-like receptor, LOX-1, have been shown in atherosclerotic regions. The present study aims to investigate the effects of ox-LDL on expression of desmoglein 1 (DSG1) and desmocollin 2 (DSC2) in endothelial cells, and to explore the role of LOX-1 mediated signal in the permeability injury associated with DSG1 and DSC2 disruption induced by oxidized lipoprotein. RT-PCR and Western blotting were applied to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of DSG1 and DSC2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) respectively. Immunoreactivities of DSG1 and DSC2 were detected by laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). HUVEC monolayers permeability was evaluated by FITC-labeled LDL in transwell assay system. The possible signal was assessed using in\u00a0vitro blocking LOX-1 or Ca(2+) channel or PKC. The DSG1 and DSC2 expression were decreased by ox-LDL in concentration- and time-dependent manner. The effects of ox-LDL were mediated by its endothelial receptor, LOX-1. In parallel experiments, ox-LDL increased the influx of extracellular calcium, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and permeability to LDL, which was inhibited by the LOX-1blocking antibody (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), Ca(2+) channel blocker (Diltiazem, 50\u00a0\u03bcmol/L) and PKC-\u03b2 inhibitor (hispidin, 4\u00a0\u03bcmol/L). These results suggested that ox-LDL-induced decrease in DSG1 and DSC2 expression and monolayer barrier injury via calcium uptake and PKC-\u03b2 activation following up-regulation of LOX-1 is one of the mechanisms of inducing greater permeability in HUVECs.", 
    "209": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate diurnal variations of the variability and irregularity of heart rate (HR) in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) with and without rate control drugs. Thirty-eight patients with permanent AF were part of an investigator-blind crossover study comparing diltiazem, verapamil, metoprolol, and carvedilol. We analyzed five Holter recordings per patient: at baseline (no rate control drug) and with each of the four drug regimens. HR, variability (SD; percentages of interval differences of successive RR intervals of >20, 50, and 80 ms; and root of the mean squared differences of successive RR intervals), and irregularity (approximate and sample entropy) parameters were computed in 20-min long nonoverlapping segments. Circadian rhythmicity was evaluated using cosinor analysis to each parameter series, which is characterized by the 24-h mean [midline statistic of rhythm (MESOR)] and excursion over the mean (amplitude). Arrhythmia-related symptoms were assessed by a questionnaire measuring symptom severity and frequency. HR and variability parameters showed a significant circadian variation in most patients, whereas only a small minority of the patients had circadian variations of irregularity parameters. Patients with circadian approximate entropy n at baseline had more severe symptoms (symptom severity: 9 \u00b1 4 vs. 6 \u00b1 5, P < 0.05, circadian vs. noncircadian variations). All drugs decreased the MESOR of HR and increased the MESOR of variability parameters. Only carvedilol and metoprolol decreased the normalized amplitude over 24 h of all parameters and HR. In conclusion, HR and RR variability parameters present a circadian variation in patients with permanent AF, whereas few patients demonstrated circadian fluctuations in irregularity parameters, suggesting different physiological mechanisms.", 
    "210": "Losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, attenuates transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling, which inhibits myogenic regeneration. Although many researchers have demonstrated that losartan has anti-fibrotic and protective effects on cardiac and skeletal muscles, for long-term administration to treat dystrophic disorders, it is essential to demonstrate not only the therapeutic effects of losartan on muscles but also its effects on other organs and on blood biochemistry.", 
    "211": "Mdx mice, an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), were fed losartan dissolved in tap water. After 44weeks, the skeletal (gastrocnemius), cardiac, and diaphragm muscles of mdx mice were removed. Tissue and blood samples were collected from all experimental animals. Effects of losartan on muscle regeneration, fibrosis, and blood enzymatic profiles were evaluated.", 
    "212": "In histopathological findings and serum biochemistry analyses, chronic losartan administration showed muscular protective effects and inhibited fibrosis in skeletal (gastrocnemius), cardiac, and diaphragmatic muscles. In addition, losartan had no effects on other solid organs. Interestingly, losartan had beneficial effects on serum HDL ratio.", 
    "213": "This study demonstrates the therapeutic effects of losartan on muscles and its effects on other organs and on blood biochemistry. In conclusion, our results provide useful information for consideration of chronic losartan administration be as a treatment of DMD.", 
    "214": "Numerous studies have been conducted in many countries to identify the factors associated with readmission of patients with heart failure (HF). However, there have been no such studies utilizing a large-scale administrative database in Japan. This study aimed to establish the factors associated with 30-day readmission of patients with HF using a Japanese nationwide administrative database.", 
    "215": "Data of the index admissions of 68,257 patients discharged from 1057 participating hospitals between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013 were analyzed. Patients were divided into the 30-day readmission group and no readmission group according to whether unplanned HF readmission occurred within 30\u00a0days after discharge. Study variables included age, sex, New York Heart Association functional class (NYHA) at admission, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), length of stay in hospital (LOS), body mass index (BMI) at admission, hospital volume reflected by the number of cases hospitalized with HF, and medical treatment at discharge.", 
    "216": "The 30-day readmission and no readmission groups included 4479 and 63,778 patients, respectively. The independent factors associated with the increase in 30-day readmission were older age, higher NYHA, higher CCI, and use of the following drugs at discharge: beta blockers, loop diuretics, thiazide, and nitrates. In contrast, the independent factors associated with the decrease in 30-day readmission were longer LOS, higher BMI, and the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, and spironolactone.", 
    "217": "The results suggest that, especially during the first few weeks after discharge, careful management of HF outpatients with advanced age, high disease severity, multiple comorbidities, or taking beta blockers, loop diuretics, thiazide, and nitrates at discharge may be crucial for reducing the 30-day readmission rate.", 
    "218": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder in which amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide accumulates in the brain. The receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) is a cellular binding site for A\u03b2 peptide and mediates amyloid \u03b2-induced perturbations in cerebral vessels, neurons, and microglia in AD. Here, we identified a specific high-affinity RAGE inhibitor (APDTKTQ named RP-1) from a phage display library. RP-1 bound to RAGE and inhibited A\u03b2 peptide-induced cellular stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SYSY cells in vitro. Three amino acids in RP-1 are identical to those in the A\u03b2 peptide. RP-1 shows high homology to the 16-23 (KLVFFAED) regions in A\u03b2 peptide and high-affinity RAGE. Functional analyses indicated that RP-1 significantly reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS products and that it enhanced catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. Furthermore, it inactivated caspase3 and caspase9 and inhibited the upregulation of RAGE, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) protein expression. In addition, RP-1 activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, inhibiting the interaction between Bax and Bcl-2. Our data suggest that RP-1 is a potent RAGE blocker that effectively controls the progression of A\u03b2 peptide-mediated brain disorders and that it may have potential as a disease-modifying agent for AD."
