    "1": "Patients had either untreated hypertension or treated hypertension. For those with type II diabetes mellitus, inclusion criteria required at least two additional risk factors. Patients were randomized to amlodipine with addition of perindopril as required (amlodipine-based) or atenolol with addition of thiazide as required (atenolol-based). Therapy was titrated to achieve a target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mmHg.", 
    "2": "The trial was terminated early due to significant benefits on mortality and stroke associated with the amlodipine-based regimen. In patients with diabetes mellitus, the amlodipine-based treatment reduced the incidence of the composite endpoint--total cardiovascular events and procedures--compared with the atenolol-based regimen (hazard ratio 0.86, confidence interval 0.76-0.98, P=0.026). Fatal and nonfatal strokes were reduced by 25% (P=0.017), peripheral arterial disease by 48% (P=0.004) and noncoronary revascularization procedures by 57% (P<0.001). For the other endpoints included in the composite, the endpoint differences were less clear including coronary heart disease deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (the primary endpoint), which were reduced nonsignificantly by 8% (hazard ratio 0.92, confidence interval 0.74-1.15).", 
    "3": "In the large diabetic subgroup in the blood pressure-lowering arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, the benefits of amlodipine-based treatment, compared with atenolol-based treatment, on the incidence of total cardiovascular events and procedures was significant (14% reduction) and similar to that observed in the total trial population (16% reduction).",

    "11": "Obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) is usually complicated by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or left ventricular hypertrophy. It occurs rarely in cases of sigmoid-shaped septum (SS), which are considered as a normal part of the aging process. The 2 cases of SS with obstruction of the LVOT were observed. Their complaints were dyspnea on effort and exercise increased the left ventricular pressure gradient. In both cases, atenolol administration decreased rest pressure gradient. Moreover, additional cibenzoline administration decreased the pressure gradient caused by exercise. It is emphasized that dual therapy with cibenzoline and atenolol is effective in resolving the obstruction of the LVOT caused by SS.", 
    "12": "We report a case of myocarditis mimicking acute lateral myocardial infarction and treated as such initially, which was complicated by ventricular fibrillation a few hours after admission to the intensive care unit. The correct diagnosis was rapidly made using a low-dose delayed-enhanced cardiac multidetector computed tomography scan performed immediately after a normal coronary angiogram, demonstrating typical myocardial late hyperenhancement and good correlation with delayed enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. This case suggests that myocarditis can be accurately diagnosed by delayed-enhanced cardiac multidetector computed tomography in an emergency setting. The other lesson from this case is that patients presenting with severe clinical symptoms, important ECG signs and high myocardial enzyme levels should be closely monitored for at least 72 hours, even when myocardial infarction has been excluded.", 
    "13": "We report the case of a 51-year-old woman receiving endobronchial treatment with neodymium:yttrium garnet laser After 30 minutes of stable anaesthesia and laser treatment, sudden inferior myocardial ischaemia developed followed by haemodynamic collapse. Resuscitation with fluids, pressors, atropine and esmolol was successful, leading to rapid resolution of the ischaemia and full recovery. The sudden onset and time course of the ST segment elevation was consistent with coronary artery air embolism, as occurs occasionally during cardiac surgery. Systemic gas embolism during endobronchial laser treatment has been previously reported with poor outcomes and significant mortality. This complication can be avoided with awareness of the mechanism while appropriate monitoring may allow early detection and successful treatment.",

    "16": "IV administration of 0.1 mg/kg WIN reduced IOP by 30% after 30 min, which continued to decline for up to 120 min. Timolol injection (25 mu g/kg) also reduced IOP by 25% after 30 min but was not sustained. In comparison, both topical WIN (1.0%) and timolol (0.5%) reduced IOP by 20% from baseline after 30 min. IV injection of either WIN or timolol significantly reduced HR to 155.4 +/- 11.4 bpm and 165.9 +/- 11.1 bpm, respectively, from a baseline of 256.3 +/- 9.9 bpm. Topical administration was well tolerated and did not affect behavior, BP, or HR.", 
    "17": "Topical administration of either WIN or timolol did not decrease IOP as much as IV administration, but the lack of systemic or local toxicity could make it the safer alternative.", 
    "18": "Nephrotic syndrome presenting in the first year of life is often challenging, with substantial risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) comprises up to 20% of biopsy-proven glomerular disease in children and adults. We report on a 9-month-old infant who presented with nephrotic syndrome, hypertension and progressive deterioration of renal function due to FSGS. As immunosuppressive agents are often unsuccessful in treating this condition, we adopted renoprotection as the mainstay treatment for this patient, through rigorous control of blood pressure and proteinuria with a multi-drug regimen including renin-angiotensin axis blockade. Initially, there was partial improvement, with a gradual decline in proteinuria and a concomitant rise in the glomerular filtration rate, before the disease eventually passed into complete clinical and laboratory remission. We speculate that infants with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to FSGS may benefit from tight control of hypertension, mainly though early blockade of the renin-angiotensin axis. We believe that its renoprotecive mechanism counteracts the deleterious effects of both hypertension and proteinuria, thereby not only preventing progressive renal disease, but even paving the way for a remission, as in our patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an infant with nephrotic syndrome (NS) due to FSGS that passed into complete remission while the patient was on renoprotective measures including the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis).",

Fixed-combination glaucoma medications containing brimonidine 0.2% and timolol 0.5%, or dorzolamide 2% and timolol 0.5%, were compared with brimonidine 0.2% and dorzolamide 2% that were used as adjunctive therapy to timolol 0.5%.", 
    "23": "A literature review was conducted to determine the outcome parameters of intraocular pressure reduction and tolerability after 3 months of use of brimonidine or dorzolamide, each together with timolol as a fixed-combination or in concomitant therapy. Modelled cost-minimization and cost-effectiveness analyses were performed to investigate the economic consequences of ophthalmic therapy with brimonidine, dorzolamide, and timolol from a societal perspective.", 
    "24": "The literature review found that brimonidine and dorzolamide used as fixed combinations with timolol as well as in adjunctive therapy to timolol were equally effective and safe. Furthermore, in the European countries studied, the fixed combination of brimonidine/timolol represented a less costly option when compared to the fixed combination of dorzolamide/timolol evaluated over both a 3-month and a 12-month horizon.", 
    "25": "Brimonidine used as a fixed-combination therapy with timolol provided better cost value than dorzolamide/timolol in all the countries studied. For most countries, the fixed combination of brimonidine and timolol also provided better cost value than adjunctive therapy with brimonidine, which was more cost effective than adjunctive therapy with dorzolamide.", 
    "26": "The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and noradrenergic neurotransmission therein mediate cardiovascular responses to acute restraint stress in rats. Bilateral microinjection of the non-specific synaptic blocker CoCl(2) (0.1 nmol/100 nl) into the BST enhanced the heart rate (HR) increase associated with acute restraint without affecting the blood pressure increase, indicating that synapses within the BST influence restraint-evoked HR changes. BST pretreatment with the selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist WB4101 (15 nmol/100 nl) caused similar effects to cobalt, indicating that local noradrenergic neurotransmission mediates the BST inhibitory influence on restraint-related HR responses. BST treatment with equimolar doses of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist RX821002 or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol did not affect restraint-related cardiovascular responses, reinforcing the inference that alpha(1)-adrenoceptors mediate the BST-related inhibitory influence on HR responses. Microinjection of WB4101 into the BST of rats pretreated intravenously with the anticholinergic drug homatropine methyl bromide (0.2 mg/kg) did not affect restraint-related cardiovascular responses, indicating that the inhibitory influence of the BST on the restraint-evoked HR increase could be related to an increase in parasympathetic activity. Thus, our results suggest an inhibitory influence of the BST on the HR increase evoked by restraint stress, and that this is mediated by local alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. The results also indicate that such an inhibitory influence is a result of parasympathetic activation.", 
    "27": "The hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, discovered initially in cardiac and neuronal cells, mediate the inward pacemaker current (I (f) or I (h)).

    "28": "RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry were used to examine the presence of HCN channels in alpha cells. Whole-cell patch-clamp, calcium imaging and glucagon secretion experiments were performed to explore the function of HCN channels in alpha cells.", 
    "29": "HCN transcripts and proteins were detected in alpha-TC6 cells and dispersed rat alpha cells. Patch-clamp recording showed hyperpolarisation-activated currents in alpha-TC6 cells, which could be blocked by HCN channel inhibitor ZD7288. Glucagon secretion RIA studies demonstrated that at both low and high glucose concentrations (2 and 20 mmol/l), ZD7288 significantly enhanced glucagon secretion in alpha-TC6 and IN-R1-G9 cell lines. Conversely, activation of HCN channels by lamotrigine significantly suppressed glucagon secretion at the low glucose concentration. Calcium imaging studies showed that blockade of HCN channels by ZD7288 significantly increased intracellular calcium in alpha-TC6 cells, while lamotrigine or the Na(+) channel blocker tetrodotoxin suppressed the effect of ZD7288 on intracellular calcium. Furthermore, we found the HCN channel inhibitors ZD7288 and cilobradine both significantly increased glucagon secretion from rat islets.",

    "31": "Premature suture obliteration results in an inability of cranial and facial bones to grow, with craniofacial dysmorphology requiring surgical correction as a consequence. Understanding signaling pathways associated with suture morphogenesis might enable non-invasive treatment of patients with fused sutures. Tgf-beta 2 induces premature suture fusion associated with increased cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Tgf-beta 2 and Egf signal transduction pathways use some signaling proteins in common to regulate proliferation and differentiation, leading to speculation that these two pathways converge to regulate normal suture development. It was therefore hypothesized that Egf could induce suture fusion, and that Tgf-beta 2-induced suture closure occurred via an Egf-dependent pathway. A well-established fetal calvarial organ culture system was used to expose developing E19.5 fetal rat coronal sutures to Egf, Tgf-beta 2 and SC-120, a blocker of Egf receptor activity. Co-culture experiments examined the effect of Egf on Tgf-beta 2-induced suture closure when Egf was given either prior to or after Tgf-beta 2 treatment. Histomorphometric measurement of suture width was done on sagittal sections through coronal sutures harvested after 5 days in culture. Western blotting using phospho-antibodies against Egf receptors was used to confirm Egf receptor activity. Suture width increased with increasing concentrations of Egf, demonstrating that Egf-induced cell activity alone was not sufficient to cause premature suture obliteration. Egf administered prior to Tgf-beta 2 treatment rescued sutures from Tgf-beta 2-induced suture obliteration, demonstrating that pre-exposure of cells to this powerful mitogen prevented their response to signals induced by Tgf-beta 2. However, Egf added after Tgf-beta 2 treatment had no effect on Tgf-beta 2-induced suture closure. Blocking Egf activity after Tgf-beta 2 treatment rescued sutures from Tgf-beta 2-induced obliteration, indicating that Tgf-beta 2 required Egf activity to induce suture obliteration. Appropriate timing of signal generation by Egf and Tgf-beta 2 is critical for normal suture development and maintenance of suture patency.", 
    "32": "The low-pressure volume overload of isolated mitral regurgitation (MR) is associated with increased adrenergic drive, left ventricular (LV) dilatation, and loss of interstitial collagen. We tested the hypothesis that beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade (beta1-RB) would attenuate LV remodeling after 4 mo of MR in the dog. beta1-RB did not attenuate collagen loss or the increase in LV mass in MR dogs. Using MRI and three-dimensional (3-D) analysis, there was a 70% increase in the LV end-diastolic (LVED) volume-to-LV mass ratio, a 23% decrease in LVED midwall circumferential curvature, and a >50% increase in LVED 3-D radius/wall thickness in MR dogs that was not attenuated by beta1-RB. However, beta1-RB caused a significant increase in LVED length from the base to apex compared with untreated MR dogs. This was associated with an increase in isolated cardiomyocyte length (171+/-5 microm, P<0.05) compared with normal (156+/-3 microm) and MR (165+/-4 microm) dogs. Isolated cardiomyocyte fractional shortening was significantly depressed in MR dogs compared with normal dogs (3.73+/-0.31 vs. 5.02+/-0.26%, P<0.05) and normalized with beta1-RB (4.73+/-0.48%). In addition, stimulation with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (25 nM) increased cardiomyocyte fractional shortening by 215% (P<0.05) in beta1-RB dogs compared with normal (56%) and MR (50%) dogs. In summary, beta1-RB improved LV cardiomyocyte function and beta-adrenergic receptor responsiveness despite further cell elongation. The failure to attenuate LV remodeling associated with MR could be due to a failure to improve ultrastructural changes in extracellular matrix organization.",

The primary outcome was new-onset HF. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke.", 
    "36": "Among the 12 randomized controlled trials, which evaluated 112,177 patients with hypertension, BBs reduced blood pressure by 12.6/6.1 mm Hg when compared with placebo, resulting in a 23% (trend) reduction in HF risk (p = 0.055). When compared with other agents, the antihypertensive efficacy of BBs was comparable, which resulted in similar but no incremental benefit for HF risk reduction in the overall cohort (risk ratio: 1.00; 95% confidence interval: 0.92 to 1.08), in the elderly (> or =60 years) or in the young (<60 years). Analyses of secondary outcomes showed that BBs confirmed similar but no incremental benefit for the outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction but increased stroke risk by 19% in the elderly.", 
    "37": "In hypertensive patients, primary prevention of HF is strongly dependent on blood pressure reduction. When compared with other antihypertensive agents, there was similar but no incremental benefit of BBs for the prevention of HF. However, given the increased risk of stroke in the elderly, BBs should not be considered as first-line agents for prevention of HF.", 
    "38": "Arterial hypertension is one of the major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease and cerebrovascular events. Adequate blood pressure control is vital for the management of patients with vascular disease. New therapeutic alternatives are appearing on the horizon to improve the degree of blood pressure control in these patients, such as direct renin inhibitors, beta-blockers with additional properties, carotid receptor- stimulating devices and vaccination against arterial hypertension. Direct renin inhibitors are a new family of antihypertensive drugs that have so far shown a good antihypertensive effect and an additive effect on reduction of proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Recent meta-analyses suggest that betablockers used as first-line treatment for uncomplicated arterial hypertension could have a less beneficial effect on the development of cardiovascular disease than other antihypertensive drugs. However, the emergence of new subtypes of beta-blockers with other hemodynamic and metabolic properties could change this conception. Carotid receptor-stimulating devices and vaccination against arterial hypertension, although not totally new therapies, are being revitalized, with preliminary results that suggest that they could be used for the treatment of arterial hypertension in patients with a specific profile. Although scientifically stimulating, the long-term beneficial effects of these new therapeutic alternatives on target-organ protection still need to be confirmed.", 
    "39": "Glomerulosclerosis, defined as phenotype transition of mesangial cell and deposition of extracellular matrix, remains a chronic disease with excessive morbidity and mortality. The molecular mechanism underlying the suppression of mesangial cell activation is not fully understood. Since activation of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) has been proposed to decrease the effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on glomerulosclerosis, we examined here whether and how telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker with PPARgamma-modulating activity, inhibited TGF-beta-induced glomerulosclerosis in rat glomerular mesangial cells. Protein levels of PPARgamma were detected by Western blot. Activation of PPARgamma response element (PPRE) was analyzed by luciferase assays. Deposition of extracellular matrix was tested by confocal laser scanning. The results showed that telmisartan, but not valsartan, another angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, up-regulated PPARgamma protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Activation of PPRE, represented by luciferase activity, was also increased with higher concentration of telmisartan in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Furthermore, telmisartan inhibited TGF-beta-induced alpha-smooth muscle actin expression and collagen IV secretion in mesangial cells. GW9662, an inhibitor of PPAR-gamma, blocked the inhibitory effects of telmisartan on TGF-beta-induced glomerulosclerosis in mesangial cells. Our study indicates a benefit of telmisartan as a PPARgamma agonist against TGF-beta-induced mesangial cells activation in renal glomerulus. It may provide possibility that telmisartan works as a potential agent against diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive renal disease.", 
    "40": "Exercise-induced dyspnea in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases may be related to sympathetic nervous system activation, with increased metabo- and/or chemosensitivities. Whether this mechanism plays a role in exercising normal subjects remains unclear.", 
    "41": "Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), HR, ventilation (V(E)), O2 saturation (SpO2), and end-tidal PCO2 (PetCO2) were measured in 14 healthy young adults after 1 wk of beta1-receptor blockade with bisoprolol 5 mg x d(-1) versus placebo after a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design. The MSNA and the ventilatory responses to hyperoxic hypercapnia (7% CO2 in O2), DeltaV(E)/DeltaPetCO2, and isocapnic hypoxia (10% O2 in N2), DeltaV(E)/DeltaSpO2, and to an isometric muscle contraction followed by a local circulatory arrest (metaboreflex) were determined at rest followed by an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test.", 
    "42": "Bisoprolol did not change the V(E) and MSNA responses to hypercapnia, hyperoxia, or isometric muscle contraction or ischemia. Bisoprolol decreased maximum O2 uptake (P < 0.05), workload (P < 0.05), and HR (P < 0.0001) and both V(E)/VO2 and V(E)/VCO2 slopes (P < 0.05).", 
    "43": "These results suggest that decreased aerobic exercise capacity after intake of beta-blockers is accompanied by decreased ventilation at any metabolic rate. However, this occurs without detectable change in the sympathetic nervous system tone or in metabo- or chemosensitivity and is therefore probably of hemodynamic origin.", 
    "44": "To study the efficacy of a treatment strategy for the management of hypertensive urgencies, the authors evaluated 549 patients admitted to the emergency department. They were first assigned to a 30-minute rest period, then a follow-up blood pressure measurement was carried out. Patients who did not respond to rest were randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of an antihypertensive drug with different mechanisms of action and pharmacodynamic properties (perindopril, amlodipine, or labetalol), and blood pressure was reassessed at 60- and 120-minute intervals. A satisfactory blood pressure response to rest (defined as postintervention systolic blood pressure < 180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 110 mm Hg, with at least a 20 mm Hg reduction in basal systolic blood pressure and/or a 10-mm Hg reduction in basal diastolic blood pressure) was observed in 31.9% of population. Among nonresponders, 79.1% had a satisfactory blood pressure response to the antihypertensive drug treatment in a 2-hour average follow-up period. No major adverse events were observed. This treatment strategy, based on standardized rest as an initial step and different antihypertensive drugs, can be effective and safe for the management of patients with hypertensive urgencies.",

The analytes, together with metoprolol, which was employed as an internal standard (IS), were extracted with a mixture solvent of chloroform/ethyl ether (1/2, v/v). The chromatographic separation was performed on a narrow-bore reversed phase HPLC column with a gradient mobile phase of methanol/water containing 15 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 10.5). The API 3,000 mass spectrometer was equipped with a TurboIonSpray interface and was operated on positive-ion, multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. The mass transitions monitored were m/z 426.3-->100.0, m/z 411.3-->100.0 and m/z 268.3-->116.1 for tiloronoxim, tilorone and the IS, respectively. The assay exhibited a linear dynamic range of 1-100 ng/ml for both tiloronoxim and tilorone based on the analysis of 0.2 ml aliquots of urine. The lower limit of quantification was 1 ng/ml for both compounds. Acceptable precision and accuracies were obtained for concentrations over the standard curve ranges. Run time of 8 min for each injection made it possible to analyze a high throughput of urine samples. The assay has been successfully used to analyze human urine samples from healthy volunteers.", 
    "57": "Electrochemically modulated liquid-liquid extraction (EMLLE) enables the selective extraction and separation of ions from mixtures by choice of an applied interfacial potential difference. The extraction of ionized drugs from artificial urine is reported in this paper. The artificial urine matrix was characterized by cyclic voltammetry at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES), showing that components of that aqueous phase truncate the available potential window at the ITIES. The transfer of three cationic drugs from aqueous artificial urine to the 1,2-dichloroethane organic electrolyte phase was examined. Both propranolol and timolol were found to transfer across the artificial urine-organic interface. However, sotalol transfer was not possible within the available potential window. Extraction of propranolol and timolol from artificial urine into an organogel phase, by electrochemically modulated liquid-liquid extraction, was examined. The application of potentials positive of the drugs' formal transfer potentials enabled the selective extraction of both propranolol and timolol, with a higher potential being required for timolol.

    "61": "Introduced as an anti-anginal compound in 1962, amiodarone emerged in the 1970s as a uniquely effective antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory drug with a multiplicity of properties, the most striking being the lengthening of the repolarization in the atria and ventricles associated with bradycardia but without a significant propensity for inducing torsade de pointes. Amiodarone is now the most frequently used agent for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with AF. Its effectiveness for maintaining sinus rhythm remains unrivalled. Although the drug has few absolute contraindications to its use as an antiarrhythmic agent, limiting side effects such as thyroid dysfunction, pulmonary fibrosis, dermatological changes, and myriad lesser adverse effects often limit the use of the drug long-term in a proportion of patients. Thus, the idea has arisen that amiodarone might serve as a model for the synthesis and development of newer and novel antiarrhythmic agents devoid of organ toxicity. Amiodarone is an iodinated compound, and the possibility that its molecule may be modified with or without elimination of the iodine is being tested. The deletion of the iodine radical, substituting ethyl with butyl in the side chain of the aromatic ring, and adding a methylsulphonyl radical to the benzofuran component of the molecule leads to the loss of thyroid and pulmonary effects. The resulting compound, dronedarone, is in advanced clinical development. It is likely the first amiodarone congener that will be used in the control of atrial fibrillation. Others are in earlier phases of development.",

The hearts were incubated for ten minutes, with or without propofol (25 or 50 microM), or for five minutes with 500 microM 5-hydroxydecanoate (a mitochondrial K(ATP) channel blocker) or 30 microM HMR1098 (sarcolemmal K(ATP) channel blocker), followed by five minutes with 50 microM propofol before ischemia. Action potentials on the anterior epicardial surface of the ventricle were monitored using a high-resolution charge-coupled device camera system, and at five minutes after reperfusion, GSK-3beta phosphorylation at the serine residue, Ser9, was examined.",

In addition, prior incubation with 5-hydroxydecanoate or HMR1098 had no effect on functional recovery improved by 50 microM propofol. At five minutes after reperfusion, propofol (25 and 50 microM) shortened the duration of the action potential and increased the levels of phospho-GSK-3beta (P < 0.05).",

An acute myocardial infarction(AMI) and reperfusion model was created with a three-hour occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by one-hour reperfusion.

It also decreased plasma ET-1 and myocardial tissue ET-1. However, glibenclamide abrogated the protective effect of carvedilol. The beneficial effect of carvedilol on myocardial no-reflow could be due to its effect on ET-1 via the activation of the K(ATP) channel.", 
    "67": "Hypertension affects an estimated 88 million Americans and is controlled to the recommended blood pressure (BP) goal of <140/90 mmHg in only 37% of individuals with hypertension. The benefits of achieving these goals, including significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, are well documented. Thus, a concerted effort to improve BP goal attainment is required. The majority of patients will require two or more antihypertensives to achieve BP goal. It has been shown that administering two drugs in a single-dose formulation substantially improves patient compliance compared with separate agent administration. Fixed-dose combination therapy can offer potential advantages over individual agents, including increased efficacy, reduced incidence of adverse effects, lower healthcare costs, and improved patient compliance through the use of a single medication administered once daily. Currently available fixed-dose agents include several combinations with complementary pharmacodynamic activity. This article reviews the fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations currently available in the US, and assesses the published literature comparing fixed-dose combinations with co-administration of two separate drugs or with other combinations. An analysis of the published literature between 1987 and 2007 reveals that most studies of fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations have compared the combination with monotherapy (53%); many fewer published papers have compared a fixed combination with coadministration of similar drugs as separate agents (2%), a fixed combination with another fixed combination from the same class (7%), or with a combination of agents from a different class (9%). Other comparisons have been with placebo, baseline or between generic formulations. This analysis indicates that: (i) physicians can be assured that a fixed-dose combination is more effective than either agent given as monotherapy; (ii) there is a paucity of data comparing different fixed-dose combinations; and (iii) very few studies have investigated the impact of fixed-dose combinations on achievement of BP goals, including both systolic BP and diastolic BP. For clinical decision making, physicians should rely on how the agents perform when administered together in add-on studies and how each component performs as monotherapy in reducing BP, achieving BP goals and reducing outcomes, as well as considering patient factors such as response to and tolerance of such agents as monotherapy and cost. The availability of effective and well tolerated fixed-dose combination antihypertensive agents should encourage primary-care physicians to be more willing to use such therapies in a timely manner when BP goals are not being achieved with monotherapy. This approach would improve BP control rates in the US and worldwide.",

This information can be determined using the ligand-detected (1)H NMR experiments T(1rho)-NOESY, diffusion, and saturation transfer difference (STD). This work compares the results of these experiments and examines their ability to distinguish the binding epitopes of propranolol enantiomers with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). The epitope maps for the propranolol enantiomers are fairly similar, as expected from their similar binding affinities; however, the STD epitope maps provide unique insights into the different orientations of the enantiomers with respect to the AGP binding pocket. Our results suggest that it is best to consider the data provided by several NMR epitope mapping experiments in drawing conclusions about ligand-protein binding interactions.",

The initial non-invasive strategy should include an echocardiography and a stress test (exercise ECG, stress echocardiography or perfusion scintigraphy), followed, in the majority of cases, by a coronary angiography. Lifestyle changes are mandatory and are fully part of secondary prevention: cigarette smoking withdrawal, mediterranean diet (fruit, vegetables, fish and poultry), weight loss, moderate alcohol consumption, increased omega-3 fatty acids and regular physical activity. Pharmacological therapy of stable coronary artery disease should associate short-acting nitrates (in case of angina), and systematically aspirin and statin. A beta-blocker should be used as a first-line therapy, particularly in the post-infarction setting or in case of left ventricular dysfunction. In case of contraindication, a calcium inhibitor or a long-acting nitrate should be choosen. ACE inhibitors are indicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension or diabetes and should also be considered in high-risk patients. The combination aspirin plus clopidogrel is required for at least one month after insertion of a nude stent, 12 months after an active stent or an acute coronary syndrome.",

However, these fistulas may be congenital arteriovenous connections that open spontaneously in the settings of collagen vascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, or may develop in females during peripartum period. A case of spontaneous carotid cavernous sinus fistula in a young adult male who presented with pulsating exophthalmos and secondary glaucoma is presented.

The genetic determinants of responses to drugs have important implications for the clinical course and management of HF.

    "76": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in the development of diabetic nephropathy, and blockade of the RAS is currently used for treatment of diabetic nephropathy. One major problem for the current RAS inhibitors is the compensatory renin increase, which reduces the efficacy of RAS inhibition. We have shown that vitamin D exerts renoprotective actions by transcriptionally suppressing renin. Here we demonstrated that combination therapy with an AT1 receptor blocker and a vitamin D analog markedly ameliorated renal injury in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model due to the blockade of the compensatory renin rise by the vitamin D analog, leading to more effective RAS inhibition. STZ-treated diabetic DBA/2J mice developed progressive albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis within 13 weeks, accompanied by increased intrarenal production of angiotensin (Ang) II, fibronection, TGF-beta, and MCP-1 and decreased expression of slit diaphragm proteins. Treatment of the diabetic mice with losartan or paricalcitol (19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(2), an activated vitamin D analog) alone moderately ameliorated kidney injury; however, combined treatment with losartan and paricalcitol completely prevented albuminuria, restored glomerular filtration barrier structure, and markedly reduced glomerulosclerosis. The combined treatment suppressed the induction of fibronection, TGF-beta, and MCP-1 and reversed the decline of slit diaphragm proteins nephrin, Neph-1, ZO-1, and alpha-actinin-4. These were accompanied by blockade of intrarenal renin and Ang II accumulation induced by hyperglycemia and losartan. These data demonstrate that inhibition of the RAS with combination of vitamin D analogs and RAS inhibitors effectively prevents renal injury in diabetic nephropathy.",

The human gut contains a huge number of neurons involved in the secretion and sensing of a class of neuroendocrine hormones called catecholamines.

We wished to investigate the impact of adrenaline on the biology of Salmonella spp.", 
    "78": "We have determined the effect of adrenaline on the transcriptome of the gut pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Addition of adrenaline led to an induction of key metal transport systems within 30 minutes of treatment. The oxidative stress responses employing manganese internalisation were also elicited. Cells lacking the key oxidative stress regulator OxyR showed reduced survival in the presence of adrenaline and complete restoration of growth upon addition of manganese. A significant reduction in the expression of the pmrHFIJKLM antimicrobial peptide resistance operon reduced the ability of Salmonella to survive polymyxin B following addition of adrenaline. Notably, both phenotypes were reversed by the addition of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Our data suggest that the BasSR two component signal transduction system is the likely adrenaline sensor mediating the antimicrobial peptide response.", 
    "79": "Salmonella are able to sense adrenaline and downregulate the antimicrobial peptide resistance pmr locus through the BasSR two component signalling system. Through iron transport, adrenaline may affect the oxidative stress balance of the cell requiring OxyR for normal growth. Both adrenaline effects can be inhibited by the addition of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Adrenaline sensing may provide an environmental cue for the induction of the Salmonella stress response in anticipation of imminent host-derived oxidative stress. However, adrenaline may also serve in favour of the host defences by lowering antimicrobial peptide resistance and hence documenting for the first time such a function for a hormone.",

The diagnosis of this genetic disorder relies on a constellation of electrocardiographic, clinical, and genetic factors. Accumulating data from recent studies indicate that the clinical course of affected LQTS patients is time-dependent and age-specific, demonstrating important gender differences among age groups. Risk assessment should consider age-gender interactions, prior syncopal history, QT-interval duration, and genetic factors. Beta-blockers constitute the mainstay therapy for LQTS, while left cardiac sympathetic denervation and implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator should be considered in patients who remain symptomatic despite beta-blocker therapy. Current and ongoing studies are also evaluating genotype-specific therapies that may reduce the risk for life-threatening cardiac events in high-risk LQTS patients.",

To explore its cellular mechanisms, we investigated possible involvement of the beta-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic and dopaminergic systems on LTP in this pathway of anesthetized rats. The induction of BLA-DG LTP was not affected by administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (50-150nmol, i.c.v.), the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (2-6mg/kg, i.p.), the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (50 nmol, i.c.v.) or the dopamine D(1) receptor antagonist SCH23390 (100nmol, i.c.v.), but significantly inhibited by the dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, chlorpromazine (15nmol, i.c.v.) and haloperidol (0.15-0.5mg/kg, i.p.), and significantly promoted by the dopamine D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (78nmol, i.c.v.). Furthermore, lesioning with 6-hydroxydopamine of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the origin of mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons, resulted in attenuated BLA-DG LTP. These results suggest that the D2-dopaminergic system, but not the beta-adrenergic, muscarinic or D1-dopaminergic system, is involved in the induction of BLA-DG LTP. In addition, inhibition of BLA-DG LTP by haloperidol or VTA lesion was abolished by blockade of GABAergic inhibition with picrotoxin. It is probable that the D2-dopaminergic system promotes the induction of BLA-DG LTP by suppressing GABAergic inhibition.",

However, PPARgamma ligands have a limitation for breast cancer therapy, since estrogen receptor alpha (ER(alpha)) negatively interferes with PPARgamma signaling in breast cancer cells. Here we show that ER(alpha) inhihits PPARgamma transactivity and ER(alpha)-mediated inhibition of PPARgamma transactivity is blocked by tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor blocker. The activation of ER(alpha) with 17-beta-estradiol blocked PPRE transactivity induced by troglitazone, a PPARgamma ligand, indicating the resistance of ER(alpha)-positive breast cancer cells to troglitazone. Indeed, troglitazone inhibited the growth of ER(alpha)-negative MDA-MB-231 cells more than that of ER(alpha)-positive MCF-7 cells. Combination of troglitazone with tamoxifen led to a marked increase in growth inhibition of ER(alpha)-positive MCF-7 cells compared to either agent alone. Our data indicates that troglitazone enhances the growth inhibitory activity of tamoxifen in ER(alpha)-positive MCF-7 cells.",

There were some significant differences in cardiovascular responses to CO2, with propranolol significantly decreasing heart rate and flupentixol increasing blood pressure when compared with placebo. The lack of subjective anxiolytic actions of the three drugs contrasts with our previous findings with acute benzodiazepines and chronic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor administration. It may be that prolonged treatment with these agents would be required to show anxiolytic effects, although it may also be that their efficacy is insufficient to be demonstrated in this model.

    "116": "Sympathovagal balance and baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) were evaluated during the development (1 and 4 wk) of one-kidney, one-clip (1K1C) hypertension in conscious mice. The development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis was also examined. Overall variability of systolic arterial pressure (AP) and HR in the time domain and baroreflex sensitivity were calculated from basal recordings. Methyl atropine and propranolol allowed the evaluation of the sympathovagal balance to the heart and the intrinsic HR. Staining of renal ANG II in the kidney and plasma renin activity (PRA) were also evaluated. One and four weeks after clipping, the mice were hypertensive and tachycardic, and they exhibited elevated sympathetic and reduced vagal tone. The intrinsic HR was elevated only 1 wk after clipping. Systolic AP variability was elevated, while HR variability and baroreflex sensitivity were reduced 1 and 4 wk after clipping. Renal ANG II staining and PRA were elevated only 1 wk after clipping. Concentric cardiac hypertrophy was observed at 1 and 4 wk, while cardiac fibrosis was observed only at 4 wk after clipping. In conclusion, these data further support previous findings in the literature and provide new features of neurohumoral changes during the development of 1K1C hypertension in mice. In addition, the 1K1C hypertensive model in mice can be an important tool for studies evaluating the role of specific genes relating to dependent and nondependent ANG II hypertension in transgenic mice.",

Many new aspects of this system have been revealed in recent years, leading to new therapeutic approaches. It's well known that RAS blocking agents have potent antiatherosclerotic effects, which are mediated by their antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and oxidative stress lowering properties. Inhibitors of RAS are now first-line treatments for hypertensive target organ damage. Their effects are greater than expected by their ability to lower blood pressure. Angiotensin receptor blockers reduce the frequency of atrial fibrillation and stroke, are also able to prevent cardiovascular and renal events in diabetic patients. Thus, blockade of RAS represents one of the most important strategies in order to reduce cardiovascular risk.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate various characteristics of hypertensive patients undergoing ABPM before starting antihypertensive treatment and evaluate the adequacy of the blood pressure (BP) control during antihypertensive treatment. ABPM was performed in 108 consecutive patients attending the hypertension clinic of Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital from 1st March 2005 to 30th April 2007 with DynaPulse 5000A (version 3.20q ) for approximately 24 hours. Male female ratio was 59:49 and age (mean +/- SD) was 47.8 +/- 16.4 years. The maximum use of ABPM (25.9%) was noted in the age group of 40-49 years. Body mass index was 25.7 +/- 3.8. Diabetes was noted in 13% patients. Maximum use of ABPM was observed in Newar ethnic group (56.5%). ABPM was used for the diagnosis of HTN in 62.0% patients and for follow up in 38.0% patients. Severe HTN was seen in approximately half (47.2%) of the hypertensive patients. Majority of the patients (88.0%) had dipper type of HTN. Beta-blocker (35.6%), ACE inhibitor/Losartan (31.1%) and calcium channel antagonist (26.7%) were the usual antihypertensive agents used.

    "126": "Metoprolol is a widely used cardioselective beta-blocker. However, like all other beta-blockers it is also a racemic mixture of R- and S- isomers. The beta 1 blocking activity (cardioselectivity) of metoprolol resides in S-isomer while R-isomer exhibits beta 2 blocking activity. As both these isomers have different pharmacological properties, racemic metoprolol can be considered a combination of two different drugs in a fixed 1:1 ratio. The needless administration of the non beta-blocking R-enantiomer that makes up 50% of racemate actually puts the patient at an increased risk of side-effects, drug interactions and loss of cardioselectivity with up-titration of dosing. Clinical experience with chirally pure S-metoprolol at half the dose of racemate has shown it to be as effective as racemate in the treatment of patients with hypertension and angina. S-metoprolol has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in patients with coexisting diabetes, COPD, and hyperlipidaemia. This confirms higher cardioselectivity of S-metoprolol in clinical settings. Less interaction potential of S-metoprolol compared to R-isomer further makes it a sensible choice in patients taking CYP2D6 inhibitors or in patients with heart failure or hepatic insufficiency. This article reviews differing properties of two isomers of metoprolol with focus on clinical experience with S-metoprolol.", 
    "127": "Neurohormonal activation and increased sympathetic stimulation are among the factors that have been linked to the development and progression of left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and heart failure (HF) in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Various available pharmacologic therapies can target these factors and improve many aspects of the disease, depending on the degree of LVD. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists because of their proven favorable effects on symptoms, left ventricular function, cardiac remodeling, hospitalization rates, and survival. However, they are not being used in over two thirds of patients with post-MI LVD. This review illustrates the impact of these therapies on post-MI LVD patients using evidence from multiple clinical trials. In addition, current and emerging treatments for acute decompensated HF will be outlined.", 
    "128": "Carefully managing patients undergoing elective surgeries is difficult in the perioperative setting. However, this becomes increasingly complex in patients hospitalized for acute conditions that may or may not be related to the pending surgery. Not only must the consulting physician take into consideration any complications inherent to the surgical procedure, but must also consider all related comorbidities of the acute condition for which the patient was initially hospitalized plus any existing chronic conditions. A careful systematic approach should be undertaken in these circumstances, which consists of (1) perioperative risk stratification, (2) medical optimization, and (3) perioperative risk reduction. Risk stratification is determined by the patient's inherent perioperative cardiac risk factors, whereas medical optimization and risk reduction are actively determined during the hospital course. For perioperative risk stratification, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index is the simplest tool for accurately identifying those patients at increased perioperative risk for cardiac mortality and morbidity. Medical optimization involves performing any necessary preoperative testing that would help identify concurrent undiagnosed medical conditions that might require preoperative intervention or the initiation of certain medication regimens to optimize disease treatment. Lastly, perioperative risk reduction includes any modalities that would be started to decrease the risk of potential perioperative cardiac, pulmonary, or other surgery-related comorbidities.",

Hemodynamic changes [blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR)], adverse effects, image quality using a 5-point scale, and accuracy of detecting significant stenoses (>or=50% reduction in lumen diameter) were evaluated. HR was significantly reduced during injection, and quickly recovered after cessation of administration, of landiolol hydrochloride. Neither significant changes in BP nor adverse effects occurred. Among visible segments, 1,869 (94%) displayed an excellent (83%) or good (11%) image quality. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in 39 of 145 patients who underwent invasive CAG within 3 weeks after MSCT. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MSCT CAG for detection of significant stenoses in assessable segments were excellent (per artery: 94%, 98%, 92%, and 100%; per segment: 92%, 98%, 94%, and 96%, respectively).",

    "133": "Deoxycorticosterone acetate-induced hypertension is a volume overload and human primary aldosteronism model characterized by severe cardiac lesions attributed to elevated inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and hypertrophy. An important cytoprotective pathway that counteracts tissue insults is the heme oxygenase (HO) system. Although the HO-1 gene promoter contains consensus binding sites for proinflammatory/oxidative transcription factors like nuclear factor-kappaB, activating protein (AP)-1, and AP-2, the effects of HO inducers on these transcription factors in cardiac lesions of deoxycorticosterone acetate hypertension are not fully understood. Hemin therapy normalized systolic blood pressure and markedly reduced the left:right ventricular ratio, left ventricular wall thickness, and left ventricle:body weight ratio, whereas the HO blocker, chromium mesoporphyrin, exacerbated cardiac fibrosis/hypertrophy in deoxycorticosterone acetate-hypertensive rats. The cardioprotection by hemin was accompanied by increased HO-1, HO activity, cGMP, superoxide dismutase, catalase, the total antioxidant capacity alongside the reduction of 8-isoprostane, AP-1, AP-2, nuclear factor-kappaB, and c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase, whereas chromium mesoporphyrin abolished the hemin effects. Furthermore, hemin therapy attenuated transforming growth factor-beta(1) and extracellular matrix proteins like fibronectin and collagen, with a corresponding reduction of histopathologic lesions, including longitudinal/cross-sectional muscle fiber thickness, scarring, muscular hypertrophy, coronary arteriolar thickening, and collagen deposition. The suppression of AP-1, AP-2, nuclear factor-kappaB, and c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase proinflammatory/oxidative mediators in the left ventricle of hemin-treated animals is a novel observation that may account for cardioprotection in deoxycorticosterone acetate hypertension. By concomitantly upregulating HO activity and cGMP and potentiating the total antioxidant status, hemin therapy reduced hypertension, suppressed oxidative stress, and attenuated extracellular matrix and remodeling proteins, with a reduction of histopathologic lesions that characterize cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and end-stage organ damage.", 
    "134": "In several observational studies, revascularization is associated with substantial reduction in mortality in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (nSTE-ACS). This has strengthened the belief that routine early angiography would lead to a reduction in mortality. We investigated the association between actual in-hospital revascularization and long-term outcome in patients with nSTE-ACS included in the ICTUS trial.", 
    "135": "The study population of the present analysis consists of ICTUS participants who were discharged alive after initial hospitalization. The ICTUS trial was a randomized, controlled trial in which 1200 patients were randomized to an early invasive or selective invasive strategy. The endpoints were death from hospital discharge until 4 year follow-up and death or spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) until 3 years. Among 1189 patients discharged alive, 691 (58%) underwent revascularization during initial hospitalization. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, in-hospital revascularization was independently associated with a reduction in 4 year mortality and 3 year event rate of death or spontaneous MI: hazard ratio (HR) 0.59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.96] and 0.46 (95% CI 0.31-0.68). However, when intention-to-treat analysis was performed, no differences in cumulative event rates were observed between the early invasive and selective invasive strategies: HR 1.10 (95% CI 0.70-1.74) for death and 1.27 (95% CI 0.88-1.85) for death or spontaneous MI.", 
    "136": "The ICTUS trial did not show that an early invasive strategy resulted in a better outcome than a selective invasive strategy in patients with nSTE-ACS. However, similar to retrospective analyses from observational studies, actual revascularization was associated with lower mortality and fewer MI. Whether an early invasive strategy leads to a better outcome than a selective invasive strategy cannot be inferred from the observation that revascularized patients have a better prognosis in non-randomized studies.", 
    "137": "Secondary prevention in patients with coronary heart disease includes treatment with platelet inhibitors, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or AT (1)-blockers, and statins. Initiation of therapy generally does not require a slow gradual dose increase. In treatment naive patients with acute coronary syndromes, administration of a loading dose of aspirin and/or clopidogrel is recommended. To reduce flushing, nicotinic acid should be initiated at low stepwise increasing dosages. beta-blocker therapy should not be stopped acutely in coronary heart disease patients. If beta-blocker therapy has to be terminated, blood pressure should be monitored closely and, if necessary controlled with other medication. Termination of statin therapy in the acute phase after strokes or acute coronary syndromes is associated with increased cardiovascular events and should therefore be avoided.",

    "139": "The present investigation was undertaken to study the effect of beta-blockers and exercise training on cardiac structure and function, respectively, as well as overall functional capacity in a genetic model of sympathetic hyperactivity-induced heart failure in mice (alpha(2A)/alpha(2C)ArKO). alpha(2A)/alpha(2C)ArKO and their wild-type controls were studied for 2 months, from 3 to 5 months of age. Mice were randomly assigned to control (N = 45), carvedilol-treated (N = 29) or exercise-trained (N = 33) groups. Eight weeks of carvedilol treatment (38 mg/kg per day by gavage) or exercise training (swimming sessions of 60 min, 5 days/week) were performed. Exercise capacity was estimated using a graded treadmill protocol and HR was measured by tail cuff. Fractional shortening was evaluated by echocardiography. Cardiac structure and gastrocnemius capillary density were evaluated by light microscopy. At 3 months of age, no significant difference in fractional shortening or exercise capacity was observed between wild-type and alpha(2A)/alpha(2C)ArKO mice. At 5 months of age, all alpha(2A)/alpha(2C)ArKO mice displayed exercise intolerance and baseline tachycardia associated with reduced fractional shortening and gastrocnemius capillary rarefaction. In addition, alpha(2A)/ alpha(2C)ArKO mice presented cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and ventricular fibrosis. Exercise training and carvedilol similarly improved fractional shortening in alpha(2A)/alpha(2C)ArKO mice. The effect of exercise training was mainly associated with improved exercise tolerance and increased gastrocnemius capillary density while beta-blocker therapy reduced cardiac myocyte dimension and ventricular collagen to wild-type control levels. Taken together, these data provide direct evidence for the respective beneficial effects of exercise training and carvedilol in alpha(2A)/alpha(2C)ArKO mice preventing cardiac dysfunction. The different mechanisms associated with beneficial effects of exercise training and carvedilol suggest future studies associating both therapies.", 
    "140": "Acute intravenous infusion of ranolazine (Ran), an anti-ischemic/antiangina drug, was previously shown to improve left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) without a concomitant increase in myocardial oxygen consumption in dogs with chronic heart failure (HF). This study examined the effects of treatment with Ran alone and in combination with metoprolol (Met) or enalapril (Ena) on LV function and remodeling in dogs with HF. Dogs (n = 28) with microembolization-induced HF were randomized to 3 mo oral treatment with Ran alone [375 mg twice daily (bid); n = 7], Ran (375 mg bid) in combination with Met tartrate (25 mg bid; n = 7), Ran (375 mg bid) in combination with Ena (10 mg bid; n = 7), or placebo (PL; Ran vehicle bid; n = 7). Ventriculographic measurements of LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) and LV EF were obtained before treatment and after 3 mo of treatment. In PL-treated dogs, EDV and ESV increased significantly. Ran alone prevented the increase in EDV and ESV seen in the PL group and significantly increased EF, albeit modestly, from 35 +/- 1% to 37 +/- 2%. When combined with either Ena or Met, Ran prevented the increase in EDV, significantly decreased ESV, and markedly increased EF compared with those of PL. EF increased from 35 +/- 1% to 40 +/- 1% with Ran + Ena and from 34 +/- 1% to 41 +/- 1% with Ran + Met. Ran alone or in combination with Ena or Met was also associated with beneficial effects at the cellular level on histomorphometric parameters such as hypertrophy, fibrosis, and capillary density as well as the expression for pathological hypertrophy and Ca2+ cycling genes. In conclusion, Ran prevented progressive LV dysfunction and global and cellular myocardial remodeling, and Ran in combination with Ena or Met improved LV function beyond that observed with Ran alone.", 
    "141": "The effect of Mentha longifolia (L.) leaf hydroalcoholic extract (MLE) was examined on rat ileal smooth muscle contractions. Last portion of ileum from male adult Wistar rat was mounted in an organ bath containing Tyrode solution. The tissue was contracted by carbachol (CCh, 10 microM), KCl (60 mM) and BaC12 (4 mM) and then MLE (0.0625-1 mg mL(-1)) was added to the bath cumulatively. The effect of MLE on KCl-induced contraction was examined after tissue incubation with propranolol (1 microM), naloxone (1 microM) and N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 microM). The effect of MLE on CaCl2-induced ileal contraction in Ca(2+)-free with high potassium Tyrode solution was also evaluated. The role of potassium channels was examined by ileum incubation (5 mim) with tetraethylammonium (TEA, 1 mM). The results showed that KCl-, CCh and BaCl2-induced ileal contractions were inhibited (p < 0.001) by cumulative concentrations of MLE with the same potency. In addition, MLE (0.25-1 mg mL(-1)) inhibited (p < 0.01) ileal contractions induced by CaCl2 (0.45-2.7 mM) in a concentration-related manner. The antispasmodic effect of MLE was affected neither by propranolol, L-NAME nor by naloxone. The MLE concentration-response curve was shifted to the right (p < 0.05) by tissue incubation with TEA. From results it may be suggested that Mentha longifolia hydroalcoholic leaf extract induces its spasmolytic activity mainly through disturbance in calcium mobilization and partly by potassium channels activation. Present results show that Mentha longifolia leaf extract exerts relaxant effects on intestinal smooth muscle, consistent with the traditional use of the plant to treat gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea and colic.",

In all recordings, the corrected QT interval (QTc) was measured in each lead. The dispersion of QTc (QTc-D; maximum QTc minus minimum QTc) was also measured. Compared with the CONTROL, the QTc-D exhibited significant deterioration after ICD shock (61 +/- 12, 91 +/- 24 ms(1/2), respectively, p < 0.001). However, the QTc-D after NIFE administration either with or without ICD shock did not differ from the CONTROL group (65 +/- 20, 61 +/- 18, and 61 +/- 12 ms(1/2), respectively, p = 0.99).",

    "145": "On the basis of previous findings suggesting that in human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-induced release of calcium machinery is either absent or immature, in the present study we tested the hypothesis that hESC-CM contain fully functional 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP(3))-operated intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) stores that can be mobilized upon appropriate physiological stimuli. To test this hypothesis we investigated the effects of angiotensin-II (AT-II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), which activate the 1,4,5-IP(3) pathway, on [Ca(2+)](i) transients and contractions in beating clusters of hESC-CM. Our major findings were that in paced hESC-CM both AT-II and ET-1 (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) increased the contraction amplitude and the maximal rates of contraction and relaxation. In addition, AT-II (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) increased the [Ca(2+)](i) transient amplitude. The involvement of 1,4,5-IP(3)-dependent intracellular Ca(2+) release in the inotropic effect of AT-II was supported by the findings that (a) hESC-CM express AT-II, ET-1, and 1,4,5-IP(3) receptors determined by immunofluorescence staining, and (b) the effects of AT-II were blocked by 2 microM 2-aminoethoxyphenyl borate (a 1,4,5-IP(3) receptor blocker) and U73122 (a phospholipase C blocker). In conclusion, these findings demonstrate for the first time that hESC-CM exhibit functional AT-II and ET-1 signaling pathways, as well as 1,4,5-IP(3)-operated releasable Ca(2+) stores.", 
    "146": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of black pepper fruit hot water extract (BPE) on rat ileum contractility and the mechanism(s) of its action. The extract was prepared by adding black pepper powder to boiling distilled water followed by evaporated the solvent. Ileum was dissected from male adult rat (Wistar) and in Tyrode solution the tissue contractions were recorded by an isotonic transducer under 1 g tension. The cumulative concentrations of the BPE (0.0625-1 mg mL(-1)) reduced the ileum contractions induced by KCl (60 mM) or carbachol (10 microM) concentration dependently (p<0.001). In Ca2+-free Tyrode solution with high potassium (60 mM), BPE, (0.0625-1 mg mL(-1)) attenuated the contractions induced by cumulative concentrations of CaCl2 (0.225-2.7 mM) concentration dependently (ANOVA, p<0.05). The incubation of the tissue preparation (20 or 30 min) with L-NAME (100 microM), naloxone (1 microM) or propranolol (1 microM) did not reduce the extract antispasmodic effect on KCl-induced ileum contraction. The extract spasmolytic effect was attenuated neither by glibenclamide (10 microM) nor by tetraethylammonium (1 mM). Present results suggest that the spasmolytic effect of the extract on rat ileum was possibly mediated via Ca2+ influx.", 
    "147": "Importins, also called karyopherins, belong to a large family of proteins involved in cytoplasm-to-nucleus transport. Transport machinery generally involves a complex formed by two different importin subtypes (alpha and beta). Both alpha and beta importins are expressed in the brain, and their expression and localization is regulated by physiological neuronal activity. Little is known about regulation of importin expression in brain pathological conditions. Here we studied the expression of importin beta1 (imp beta 1) in the rat hippocampus after acute and chronic seizures induced by the glutamate agonist kainic acid (KA). The overall content of imp beta 1 mRNA and protein did not change after acute KA seizures. However, acute KA seizures rapidly induced the translocation of imp beta 1 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in pyramidal CA1 neurons. KA-induced imp beta 1 translocation was prevented by the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) receptor blocker MK-801. After chronic seizures, the overall levels of imp beta 1 mRNA and protein did not change in the whole hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry revealed a massive loss of imp beta 1-positive neurons in pyramidal layers (that degenerated after KA), whereas an increased number of imp beta 1-positive cells was detected in the stratum radiatum of rats with chronic seizures compared with control animals. Double-labeling experiments identified these cells as glial cells expressing the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 (neuron/glial antigen 2), a glial subtype recently shown to regulate hippocampal neuron excitability. These data show a differential regulation of imp beta 1 expression after acute and chronic seizure activity in the rat hippocampus.",

The UV detection was carried out at 225 nm. HCTZ and BF were separated in less than 10 min with good resolution and minimal tailing, without interference of excipients. The method was validated according to ICH guidelines and the acceptance criteria for accuracy, precision, linearity, specificity and system suitability were met in all cases. The method was linear in the range of 50-150 microg/ml for BF and 125-375 microg/ml for HCTZ.",

Insulin (0.8 or 1.2units/kg) caused near total social withdrawal at 0.75h with full recovery not occurring until 4h (0.8units/kg) or 8h (1.2units/kg) post-insulin injection. Insulin also caused a marked elevation in plasma catecholamines. Basal 12h fasting NE and Epi were 287+/-38 and 350+/-47pg/ml, respectively. Insulin at 0.8units/kg increased plasma NE and Epi to 994+/-73 and 1842+/-473pg/ml, respectively. Administration of exogenous NE or Epi caused social withdrawal similar in magnitude to insulin. Importantly, administration of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline also caused social withdrawal while administration of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist butoxamine blocked NE-induced social withdrawal. Finally, butoxamine blocked insulin-induced social withdrawal.",

    "165": "A 2-year-old boy was presented with late-recognized coarctation of the aorta and pulmonary hypertension due to left ventricular failure. The coarctation was corrected at the day of admission with a good postoperative result. However, weaning from the respirator failed despite multiple drug support due to left ventricular failure. Consequently, a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was implanted 22 days later. The further course was complicated by systemic hypertension and ongoing pulmonary hypertension requiring extensive antihypertensive therapy. The first attempt to wean from LVAD failed and the left ventricle was left completely unloaded for additional 4 weeks. The second weaning attempt, using a very smooth weaning protocol, led to a recovered left ventricle and facilitated the removal of the assist device after a total of 120 days. The patient was discharged with normal cardiac function, but he still requires antihypertensive therapy. We believe that the slow reduction of the LVAD support was the key measure that leads to the successful weaning of the patient, thereby avoiding heart transplantation.",

Low-dose carperitide (0.01-0.05 microg x kg(-1 ) x min(-1)) was infused for 72 h as the initial treatment (n=26), whereas in the control group (n=23), standard medical treatment other than carperitide was given without limitation. Anti-aldosterone drugs were prohibited in both groups. During carperitide infusion, significant increases of the atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic GMP levels and a significant decrease in the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein/serum creatinine ratio were observed, suggesting inhibition of myocyte cell membrane damage. On the other hand, no significant differences in the plasma brain natriuretic peptide, troponin T, and creatinine levels were noted in either group. During 18-month follow-up, significant reductions of death and rehospitalization occurred in the carperitide vs control group (11.5% vs 34.8%; p=0.0359). Cox regression analysis revealed that randomization to carperitide (p=0.020), pretreatment systolic blood pressure >or=140 mmHg (p=0.043), and beta-blocker therapy (p=0.016) were independent predictors for freedom from cardiac events.",

The average event rate for this group of patients was 4.3% per year. The circadian pattern reveals a pronounced peak in ICD discharges for the hours from 14:00 to 16:00. HCM patients receiving antiarrhythmic or beta-blocker therapy did not demonstrate a different circadian pattern compared with patients not receiving these medications.",

In-hospital mortality was higher in elderly patients (2.4% vs. 3.4% vs. 8.9% vs. 14.0%, respectively for age groups, p < 0.0001). Similarly, in non-shock patients and in patients with elevated cardiac markers, age-dependent differences in mortality were observed. Independent predictors of in-hospital death were: age, cardiogenic shock, elevated cardiac markers and pharmacotherapy index.",

Forty-two patients (53.2%) experienced recurrence of syncope or presyncope during the follow-up period. In recurrent symptomatic patients, diaphoresis had been more significantly reported in their past medical history (p = 0.018) and they had more syncopal spells before TTT (p = 0.001).

    "184": "We have reported that serum C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation is an independent predictor of lung oxygenation impairment (LOI) after distal type acute aortic dissection (AAD). Systemic activation of the inflammatory system after aortic injury may play a role in the development of LOI. The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of beta-blockers on systemic inflammation and the development of LOI after distal type AAD. A total of 49 patients, who were admitted with distal type AAD and treated conservatively, were examined. White blood cell (WBC) count, serum CRP level, and arterial blood gases were measured serially. Forty patients received beta-blocker treatment within 24 h of the onset, while 9 patients received no beta-blocker treatment. Maximum WBC count, maximum CRP level, lowest PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio, and patient background were compared between the two groups. There was no difference between the groups according to age, sex, coronary risk factors, blood pressure, serum level of CRP, WBC count, and oxygenation index on admission. Beta-blocker treatment was associated with lower maximum WBC count (P = 0.0028) and lower maximum serum CRP level (P = 0.0004). The minimum P/F ratio was higher in patients with beta-blocker treatment than in those without (P = 0.0076). Multivariate analysis revealed that administration of a beta-blocker was an independent negative determinant of LOI (P/F ratio < or = 200 mmHg). In conclusion, early use of beta-blockers prevented excessive inflammation and LOI after distal type AAD, suggesting a pleiotropic effect of beta-blockers on the inflammatory response after AAD.",

    "186": "Of 1299 HCM patients, 28 (2%) were identified with left ventricular apical aneurysms, including a pair of identical twins. Aneurysms were recognized at a wide age range (26 to 83 years), including 12 patients (43%) who were <or=50 years of age. Apical aneurysms varied considerably in size (maximum dimension, 10 to 66 mm), were dyskinetic/akinetic with thin rims, and were associated with transmural (and often more extensive) myocardial scarring identified by late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Apical aneurysms were recognized by echocardiography in only 16 of 28 patients (57%) but by cardiovascular magnetic resonance in the 12 patients undetected by echocardiography. Left ventricular chamber morphology varied; however, 19 patients (68%) showed an \"hourglass\" contour, with midventricular hypertrophy producing muscular narrowing and intracavitary gradients in 9 patients (74+/-42 mm Hg). Sarcomeric protein missense mutations known to cause other phenotypic expressions of HCM were present in 3 patients. Over 4.1+/-3.7 years of follow-up, 12 patients (43%) with left ventricular apical aneurysms experienced adverse disease complications (event rate, 10.5%/y), including sudden death, appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharges, nonfatal thromboembolic stroke, and progressive heart failure and death.",
