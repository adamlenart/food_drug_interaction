    "1": "We retrospectively analysed 103 consecutive coronary surgery patients under the care of one surgeon between April 2003 and September 2003. These patients received 40 mg of sotalol orally twice daily from the first post-operative day for 6 weeks and 2 g of magnesium intravenously immediately post surgery and on the first post-operative day. We developed a propensity score for the probability of receiving sotalol and magnesium after coronary surgery. 89 patients from the sotalol and magnesium group were successfully matched with 89 unique coronary surgery patients who did not receive either sotalol or magnesium with an identical propensity score.", 
    "2": "Preoperative characteristics were well matched between groups. There was no significant difference with respect to in-hospital mortality between groups (sotalol and magnesium 1.1% versus control 4.5%; p = 0.17). The incidence of atrial fibrillation in the sotalol and magnesium group was 13.5% compared to 27.0% in the controls (p = 0.025).",

    "4": "The transmitters involved in the non-nitrergic component of the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory response of the rat small intestinal longitudinal muscle to electrical field stimulation of its nerves is a matter of controversy. The present study is the first one to utilise a combination of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor and a P(2) purinoceptor antagonist for studying this response. We found that the P(2) purinoceptor antagonist pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS; 5x10(-5) M) abolished the non-nitrergic NANC relaxation to electrical field stimulation (10 Hz). PPADS alone provided a significant, moderate inhibitory action. PPADS specifically inhibited relaxations due to exogenous adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) or alpha,beta-methylene ATP. The guanylate cyclase blocker 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 10(-6) M) did not add to the inhibitory action of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine on field stimulation-induced relaxation. ODQ abolished the relaxant effect of the nitric oxide donors nitroglycerin or sodium nitroprusside. These data indicate that: (1) nitric oxide and ATP fully account for the field stimulation-induced relaxation in the rat ileal strip under the experimental conditions of this study, and (2) no ODQ-sensitive guanylate cyclase-mediated mechanism is involved in the non-nitrergic component of the NANC relaxation.", 
    "5": "A reverse-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography method is described for the quantification of 1'-hydroxybufuralol formed enzymatically by the incubation of bufuralol with cDNA-expressed CYP2D6 or human liver microsomes. Analytical separation is achieved using a C18 column and a mobile phase consisting of 30% acetonitrile and 2 mM perchloric acid, with detection by fluorescence using an excitation wavelength of 252 nm and an emission wavelength of 302 nm. This method is applicable to enzymatic studies for determination of CYP2D6-catalyzed bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation activity.", 
    "6": "This study presents the advantages of the 20 microm inner diameter (id) capillary for the enantioseparation of ten basic drugs with native beta-CD as the chiral selector. The apparent binding constants of each enantiomeric pair were determined to calculate the optimum beta-CD concentration ([beta-CD]opt) and the optimization was subsequently carried out. Comparison of the 20 microm id with 50 microm id were made in terms of the results obtained in the optimization and detection limits. Applying the optimum conditions for each compound, reproducible results (RSD from 0-3; n>5) were obtained for the 20 microm id capillary. Although the sensitivity is lower in the 20 microm id capillary, the LOD determined using this capillary is still found to be acceptable for the ten basic drugs studied. Enhanced resolution and faster analysis times were the main advantages observed with the use of this capillary in enantioseparation.", 
    "7": "Hydrogen sulphide (H2S), which is produced endogenously from L-cysteine in mammalian tissues, has been suggested to function as a neuromodulator in the brain. However, the role of H2S in microglial cells is unclear. In this study, the effect of exogenous and endogenous H2S on intracellular calcium homeostasis was investigated in primary cultured microglial cells. Sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), a H2S donor, caused a concentration-dependent (0.1-0.5 mM) increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). This effect was significantly attenuated in the presence of a calcium-free extracellular solution, Gd3+ (100 microM), a nonselective Ca2+ channel blocker, or thapsigargin (2 microM), an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase. These observations suggest that the increase in [Ca2+]i in response to H2S involves both calcium influx across the plasma membrane and calcium release from intracellular stores. The H2S-induced calcium elevation is partly attenuated by H-89, a selective cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor, but not by U73122, a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, and chelerythrine, a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of cAMP/PKA, but not PLC/PKC/phosphoinositol-3,4,5-inositol (IP3) pathway. Using RT-PCR, only cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), a H2S producing enzyme, was detected in primary cultures of microglia. Lowering endogenous H2S level with, D,L-propargylglycine and beta-cyano-L-alanine, two CSE inhibitors, significantly decreased [Ca2+]i, suggesting that endogenous H2S may have a positive tonic influence on [Ca2+]i homeostasis. These findings support the possibility that H2S may serve as a neuromodulator to facilitate signaling between neurons and microglial cells.", 
    "8": "Analyses of statistical variance were applied to evaluate the precision and practicality of a CD-based NACE assay for R-timolol after enantiomeric separation of R- and S-timolol. Data were collected in an interlaboratory study by 11 participating laboratories located in Europe and North America. General qualitative method performance was examined using suitability descriptors (i.e. resolution, selectivity, migration times and S/N), while precision was determined by quantification of variances in the determination of R-timolol at four different impurity levels in S-timolol maleate samples. The interlaboratory trials were designed in accordance with the ISO guideline 5725-2. This allowed estimating for each sample, the different variances, i.e. between-laboratory (s2(Laboratories)), between-day (s2(Days)) and between-replicate (s2(Replicates)). The variances of repeatability (s2r) and reproducibility (s2R) were then calculated. The estimated uncertainty, derived from the precision estimates, seems to be concentration-dependent above a given threshold. This example of R-timolol illustrates how a laboratory can evaluate uncertainty in general.", 
    "9": "AT1 receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors decrease the risk for new onset diabetes mellitus. The phenomenon could be related to a direct angiotensin II effect on tissue metabolism. To address the issue, we recruited eighteen obese hypertensive patients. Patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with either valsartan (n = 8) or atenolol (n = 10) for thirteen weeks. They underwent an oral glucose tolerance test before and during active treatment, while metabolism was monitored through subcutaneous and intramuscular microdialysis and indirect calorimetry. After glucose ingestion, venous glucose and insulin concentrations increased rapidly while systemic free fatty acid concentrations were suppressed. Dialysate glucose and lactate concentrations increased briskly in adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle. Dialysate glycerol decreased profoundly in both tissues. Respiratory quotient increased markedly after glucose ingestion. These responses were identical at baseline and during active treatment either drug. We conclude that AT1 receptor blockade in obese hypertensive patients has no effect on interstitial glucose supply, lipolysis, and substrate oxidation. One possible explanation is that angiotensin II levels in obese hypertensives are not sufficient to elicit the metabolic changes that have been observed after direct angiotensin II application. The exact mechanism by which inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system decreases the diabetes risk remains unresolved and requires further study.", 
    "10": "In this study we have tested the effects of d-propranolol (D-Pro) on the iron uptake, iron release and oxidative response of iron-loaded cells in a cellular model of iron-overload using isolated rat peritoneal macrophages incubated with iron-dextran (Fe-D). Pretreatment of macrophages with D-Pro (5-200 microM) prior to Fe-D exposure decreased the cellular iron content and partially prevented iron release from latex-activated macrophages. Release of reactive oxygen species from activated cells was detected by dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCDHF, 5 microM) oxidation. We found that loading cells with Fe-D increased their response to latex, which was prevented by the lysosomotropic antioxidant agent D-Pro (10 microM).", 
    "11": "Sensitive spectrophotometric and spectrofluorimetric methods are described for the determination of tramadol, acebutolol and dothiepin (dosulepin) hydrochlorides. The two methods are based on the condensation of the cited drugs with the mixed anhydrides of malonic and acetic acids at 60 degrees C for 25-40 min. The coloured condensation products are suitable for the spectrophotometric and spectrofluorimetric determination at 329-333 and 431-434 nm (excitation at 389 nm), respectively. For the spectrophotometric method, Beer's law was obeyed from 0.5 to 2.5 microg ml(-1) for tramadol, dothiepin and 5-25 microg ml(-1) for acebutolol. Using the spectrofluorimetric method linearity ranged from 0.25 to 1.25 microg ml(-1) for tramadol, dothiepin and 1-5 microg ml(-1) for acebutolol. Mean percentage recoveries for the spectrophotometric method were 99.68+/-1.00, 99.95+/-1.11 and 99.72+/-1.01 for tramadol, acebutolol and dothiepin, respectively and for the spectrofluorimetric method, recoveries were 99.5+/-0.844, 100.32+/-0.969 and 99.82+/-1.15 for the three drugs, respectively. The optimum experimental parameters for the reaction has been studied. The validity of the described procedures was assessed. Statistical analysis of the results has been carried out revealing high accuracy and good precision. The proposed methods were successfully applied for the determination of the selected drugs in their pharmaceutical preparations with good recoveries. The procedures were accurate, simple and suitable for quality control application.", 
    "12": "Nebivolol is a highly selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocker with additional vasodilatory properties, which may be due to an endothelial-dependent beta(3)-adrenergic activation of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). beta(3)-adrenergic eNOS activation has been described in human myocardium and is increased in human heart failure. Therefore, this study investigated whether nebivolol may induce an eNOS activation in cardiac tissue. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed using specific antibodies against eNOS translocation and eNOS serine(1177) phosphorylation in rat isolated cardiomyocytes, human right atrial tissue (coronary bypass-operation), left ventricular non-failing (donor hearts) and failing myocardium after application of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers nebivolol, metoprolol and carvedilol, as well as after application of BRL 37344, a specific beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist. BRL 37344 (10 microM) significantly increased eNOS activity in all investigated tissues (either via translocation or phosphorylation or both). None of the beta-blockers (each 10 microM), including nebivolol, increased either translocation or phosphorylation in any of the investigated tissues. In human failing myocardium, nebivolol (10 microM) decreased eNOS activity. In conclusion, nebivolol shows a tissue-specific eNOS activation. Nebivolol does not activate the endothelial eNOS in end-stage human heart failure and may thus reduce inhibitory effects of NO on myocardial contractility and on oxidative stress formation. This mode of action may be of advantage when treating heart failure patients.", 
    "13": "The use of beta-blockers to antagonize beta-adrenergic receptor signaling in the heart has become a standard method of treatment for heart failure, resulting in positive clinical outcomes alone and in conjunction with other modulators of cardiomyocyte contractility. However, an entire explanation for improved cardiac function in patients using beta-blockers is unknown, and in fact may be quite complicated, considering the numerous intracellular signaling pathways associated with beta-adrenergic receptors. Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors during both normal conditions and during heart failure activate several distinct signaling cascades, which influence cardiomyocyte contraction, hypertrophy and apoptosis. This review explores the signaling cascades induced by beta-adrenergic receptor activation in normal and desensitized states to provide new insight into the effective treatment of cardiac dysfunction.", 
    "14": "This article examines evidence-based findings in the literature on the efficacy of perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg, a first-line, low-dose antihypertensive drug combination. In regulatory Phase II and III trials, perindopril/indapamide significantly lowered blood pressure compared with other first-line therapies (atenolol, losartan and irbesartan). This was also the case in STRAtegies of Treatment in Hypertension: Evaluation, a postregistration study versus current monotherapies and stepped-care therapy with different classes of antihypertensive agents. The efficacy/safety ratio (both clinical and with regard to laboratory parameters) of perindopril/indapamide was good. Perindopril/indapamide provides additional antihypertensive efficacy compared with each component used alone and with current monotherapies, with major efficacy on systolic blood pressure, an important predictor of cardiovascular risk. It also reduces pulse pressure, an independent cardiovascular risk factor, large-vessel arterial stiffness and microcirculatory alterations. The fixed dosage of a once-daily tablet, ensures optimal ease of use and enhances patient compliance. Perindopril/indapamide also reduces target organ damage in patients at high cardiovascular risk, such as patients with cardiac hypertrophy and Type 2 diabetics with albuminuria. These benefits, together with the good efficacy/tolerability ratio, fulfill the requirements of the European Society of Hypertension and of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines for low-dose, first-line combination therapy in hypertension.", 
    "15": "The effect of the ultra-short-acting beta blocker, landiolol, on ischemic preconditioning was examined in isolated rabbit hearts. Ischemic preconditioned hearts received 2 episodes of 5 min each of global ischemia and reperfusion. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 1 hour and reperfused for 1 hour. Left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic pressures and infarct size were measured. Seven control hearts had no drug infused. Four groups of 6 hearts each were pretreated with 1 or 3 microM of landiolol or a combination of 1 or 3 microM landiolol and ischemic preconditioning. A further group of 6 hearts had ischemic preconditioning without landiolol. Ischemic preconditioning significantly reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and infarct size compared to the controls. Landiolol alone did not change left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or infarct size, but landiolol 3 microM and ischemic preconditioning decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure more than preconditioning alone. These data suggest that pre-ischemic landiolol infusion may enhance the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning.",

    "18": "Modern drug discovery is primarily based on the search and subsequent testing of drug candidates acting on a preselected therapeutic target. Progress in genomics, protein structure, proteomics, and disease mechanisms has led to a growing interest in and effort for finding new targets and more effective exploration of existing targets. The number of reported targets of marketed and investigational drugs has significantly increased in the past 8 years. There are 1535 targets collected in the therapeutic target database compared with approximately 500 targets reported in a 1996 review. Knowledge of these targets is helpful for molecular dissection of the mechanism of action of drugs and for predicting features that guide new drug design and the search for new targets. This article summarizes the progress of target exploration and investigates the characteristics of the currently explored targets to analyze their sequence, structure, family representation, pathway association, tissue distribution, and genome location features for finding clues useful for searching for new targets. Possible \"rules\" to guide the search for druggable proteins and the feasibility of using a statistical learning method for predicting druggable proteins directly from their sequences are discussed.", 
    "19": "The skin is our primary defense against noxious environmental agents. Upon injury, keratinocytes migrate directionally into the wound bed to initiate re-epithelialization, essential for wound repair and restoration of barrier integrity. Keratinocytes express a high level of beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-ARs) that appear to play a role in cutaneous homeostasis as aberrations in either keratinocyte beta2-AR function or density are associated with various skin diseases. Here we report the novel finding that beta-AR antagonists promote wound re-epithelialization in a \"chronic\" human skin wound-healing model. beta-AR antagonists increase ERK phosphorylation, the rate of keratinocyte migration, electric field-directed migration, and ultimately accelerate human skin wound re-epithelialization. We demonstrate that keratinocytes express two key enzymes required for catecholamine (beta-AR agonist) synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase, both localized within keratinocyte cytoplasmic vesicles. Finally, we confirm the synthesis of epinephrine by measuring the endogenously synthesized catecholamine in keratinocyte extracts. Previously, we have demonstrated that beta-AR agonists delay wound re-epithelialization. Here we report that the mechanism for the beta-AR antagonist-mediated augmentation of wound repair is due to beta2-AR blockade, preventing the binding of endogenously synthesized epinephrine. Our work describes an endogenous beta-AR mediator network in the skin that can temporally regulate skin wound repair. Further investigation of this network will improve our understanding of both the skin repair process and the multiple modes of action of one of the most frequently prescribed class of drugs, hopefully resulting in a new treatment for chronic wounds.",

As a consequence, absorption and bioavailability may depend on the intestinal concentration profile of the drug and may vary as a function of dose and release rate of the drug from the dosage form. The impact of controlled versus immediate-release on the absorption of P-glycoprotein substrates is currently unknown. Thus, the main focus of the present study was a comparison of the pharmacokinetics of the P-gp model substrate talinolol following administration of immediate-release (IR) and controlled-release (CR) tablets to healthy human volunteers with a particular focus on the absorption characteristics of the active pharmaceutical ingredients.", 
    "21": "Talinolol immediate-release (Cordanum), 100mg), one controlled-release (100mg) and two controlled-release tablets (200mg) were administered as single doses to fasting healthy volunteers in a crossover design with a 1 week washout period between treatments. Sufficient blood and urine samples were drawn and analysed using a specific HPLC method with UV detection to describe the resulting plasma and urinary excretion versus time profiles.", 
    "22": "The bioavailability of talinolol in term of AUC(0-->infinity) for IR talinolol was approximately twice as high as compared to the administration of the same dose in a controlled-release dosage form. After administration of talinolol IR tablets, the drug was rapidly absorbed and reached maximum concentrations C(max) of 204.5 ng/ml+/-121.8 (means+/-S.D.) 2h after dosing. The terminal half-life of the drug averaged 19.8h following IR administration in comparison to 32 h under CR dosing conditions. Following administration of the IR dosage form, significant secondary peaks were observed in one healthy subject. Secondary peaks were not clearly apparent in the CR plasma profiles.",

    "24": "A composite membrane for transdermal delivery of S-propranolol enantiomer was developed based on the controlled pore functionalization of bacterial cellulose membranes using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) layer synthesis. The reactive pore-filling of an asymmetric porous cellulose membrane with a MIP thin-layer was effected using a silanized coupler as an additional anchor for the MIP. MIP thin-layers with specific binding sites for S-propranolol were synthesized by copolymerization of methacrylic acid with a cross-linker, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate in the presence of S-propranolol as the template molecule and the latter was subsequently extracted. Selective transport of S-propranolol through the MIP composite membrane was obtained, although this was determined mostly by the parent cellulose membrane with some ancillary contributory effect from the MIP layer. In addition, an enantioselectivity in the transport of propranolol prodrug enantiomers was found, suggesting that the shape and functional groups orientation, which are similar to that of the print molecule were essential for enantiomeric recognition of the MIP composite membrane. The enantioselectivity of S-MIP membranes was also shown when the release of propranolol enantiomers was studied in vitro using rat skin, with racemic propranolol contained in the donor compartment. The composite membrane of bacterially-derived cellulose and molecularly imprinted polymer may have great potential for use as a transdermal enantioselective controlled-release system for racemic propranolol.", 
    "25": "Oxytocin has been implicated in the modulation of somatosensory transmission such as nociception and pain. The present study investigates the effect of oxytocin on formalin-induced pain response, a model of tonic continuous pain. The animals were injected with 0.1 ml of 1% formalin in the right hindpaw and the left hindpaw was injected with an equal volume of normal saline. The time spent by the animals licking or biting the injected paw during 0-5 min (early phase) and 20-25 min (late phase) was recorded separately. Oxytocin (25, 50, 100 microg/kg, i.p.) dose dependently decreased the licking/biting response, both in the early as well as the late phases. The antinociceptive effect of oxytocin (100 microg/kg, i.p.) was significantly attenuated in both the phases by a higher dose of the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (5 mg/kg, i.p.), MR 2266 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist and naltrindole (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), a selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist but not by a lower dose of naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or beta-funaltrexamine (2.5 microg/mouse, i.c.v.), a selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker (1 and 5 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a dose-dependent analgesic effect. The antinociceptive effect of oxytocin was significantly enhanced by the lower dose of nimodipine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) in both the phases. Chronic treatment with oxytocin (100 microg/kg/day, i.p. daily for 7 days) did not produce tolerance in both the phases of formalin-induced pain response. The results thus indicate that oxytocin displays an important analgesic response in formalin test; both kappa- and delta-opioid receptors as well as voltage-gated calcium channels seem to be involved in the oxytocin-induced antinociception.", 
    "26": "This paper describes a strategy for the development of chromatographic methods for drug candidates based upon the use of simple MS compatible mobile phases and optimization of the chromatographic selectivity through variations of the stationary phase and mobile phase pH. The strategy employs an automated column selection system and a series of HPLC columns, varying in hydrophobicity and silanol activity, in combination with DryLab software to develop chromatographic methods for the separation of mixtures of bupivacaine and its metabolites; acidic, basic, and neutral compounds; and atenolol, nitrendipine, and their degradation products.",

Antiplatelet drugs were given to 96.1% vs 89.1% of patients, beta-blockers to 51.1% vs 30.1%, and ACE inhibitors to 41.6% vs 24.9% (P<.001 for all comparisons). In addition, 28-day mortality was 11.3% and 14.2% (P<.001), respectively, and one-year mortality, 16.4% and 18.5% (P<.001), respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality at one year in PRIAMHO II compared with PRIAMHO I was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.70-0.86, P<.001; adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, smoking, dyslipemia, hypertension, previous MI and CABG, ST-elevation status and Killip class at admission, and hospital characteristics).", 
    "30": "Even though patients registered in 2000 formed a higher risk group than those registered in 1995, one-year mortality after AMI decreased by 22% over the five-year period. This improvement was due to more frequent and earlier reperfusion therapy and better use of antithrombotics, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors.", 
    "31": "Before initiating specific treatment of atrial fibrillation treatable causes must first be reliably ruled out. Furthermore, the chances of maintaining a sinus rhythm must be individually weighed against the potential complications and risks of an anti-arrhythmic therapy, and also alternative strategies considered. Today, rate control is recommended in the case of asymptomatic patients, in particular in the elderly, while rhythm control is the strategy of choice in younger, symptomatic patients. For recurrence prevention, beta blockers are the first-choice drugs. In patients with no structural heart disease, class IC antiarrhythmic agents, in those with structural heart disease only amiodarone, may be considered. Promising new additive therapeutic approaches are ACE-inhibitors and AT-II receptor antagonists.

This strategy dominates both strategies involving latanoprost (as add-on to timolol or as first line) in these four countries. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of bimatoprost first-line therapy versus timolol with add-on bimatoprost varies from each country and target (from 305 pounds sterlings to 43,720 euros per patient). In France the timolol first line and latanoprost add-on is not dominated and is the cheapest alternative. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of timolol with add-on bimatoprost versus add-on latanoprost lies between 71 euros and 355 euros per patient depending on target (18 and 13 mm Hg, respectively).",

The method, which expresses the induced dipoles as a set of \"induced\" charges, is based on the induced dipole approach and methodology for calculating potential-derived point charges from distributed multipole series. The method has the advantage that the same methodology can be used to determine the induced charges and the potential derived charges and so both sets of charges are rigorously defined within the same framework. This underlying link with the wave function makes the method particularly suitable for use in hybrid QM/MM calculations. Here we assess the importance of explicit polarization in the classical part of a QM/MM system with regard to improving the classical description and the consequent effects on the quantum description. The main advantages of the induced charge approach are that the method is readily interfaced with quantum mechanical methods and that induced charges are more readily interpreted than induced dipoles. The ease of interpretation is illustrated by analysis of the charges involved in dimeric and trimeric hydrogen bonded systems. The method for treating the MM polarization has been validated by a regression analysis of the charges induced in both the QM and MM systems against those derived from full quantum mechanical calculations. The method has also been validated using two energy decomposition approaches, which show that MM polarization makes a significant and reliable contribution to the QM - MM interaction energy in a hybrid system. The distance dependency of the induced charges is investigated in calculations on methylsuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala chlormethyl ketone interacting with human neutrophil elastase and propranolol interacting with asparagine residues in a model of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "45": "To observe the influences of metoprolol on hemodynamics and myocardial ischaemia in elderly patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.", 
    "46": "Thrity patients (60 approximately 75 years) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery were randomly divided into a metoprolol group (n = 15) and a control group (n = 15). In the metoprolol group, metoprolol (0. 5 mg and 1.5 mg) was slowly injected into the vein of patients before the induction of intravenous anesthesia and after the tracheal intubation. The hemodynamic indice (invasive BP, HR and rate pressure product-RPP), the myocardial ischaemia indice (reversible ST segment depression of ECG II, V5 leads more than 0.1 mv or reversible ST segment elevation more than 0.2 mv from the baseline, ST segment depression or elevation over 1 min), the myocardial damage indice (serum cardiac troponin I, cTn I), and the indice of metoprolol cardiac and the respiratory adverse effects (incidence of HR below 50 beats/min, average doses of atropine, airway peak pressure) were observed intraoperatively.", 
    "47": "The HR and RPP were lower before the tracheal induction than the baseline (before anesthesia) in all patients, but there is no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). During the tracheal intubation, the HR and RPP of the control group significantly increased, compared with the baseline (P < 0.05) and those of metoprolol group (P < 0.05). The incidence of perioperative hypertension was higher in the control group than that in the metoprolol group. The incidence of myocardical ischaemia episode was 30% in the control group, and 13% in the metoprolol group (P < 0.01). The release of cTn I was detected in 5 patients in the control group, and 2 patients in the metoprolol group (P < 0.05). The incidence of HR < 50 beats/min, and the average doses of atropine had no statistic difference between the two groups, but a tendency of high incidence of bradycardia in the metoprolol group occurred when abdominal viscera was tracted by surgical manupilation. There was no significant difference in airway peak pressure, SpO2 and PET CO2 between the two groups (P > 0.05).", 
    "48": "Intravenous administration of 0.5 mg and 1. 5 mg metoprolol before the induction of anesthesia and after the tracheal intubation has several advantages, including the decrease of myocardial oxygen consumption, the improvement of hemodynamic stability, and the lowering perioperative incidence of myocardial ischeamia and damage, but the tendency of high bradycardia incidence caused by peritoneal traction should be noticed.", 
    "49": "The patients after myocardial infarction could hope for a significant improvement in their life expectancy when complying with the principles of the secondary prevention. Today there is no doubt that the administration of ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, aspirin and statins decrease mortality in these patients. Although the clinicians are aware of the guidelines of Evidence Based Medicine, international and Hungarian surveys show that in their everyday application there is still much to improve.", 
    "50": "The authors studied the therapy of 200 consecutive patients (115 men and 85 women) who suffered from acute myocardial infarction (either STAMI or NSTAMI) in 1999-2000 at the discharge from their internal medicine department with cardiological profile and 6 months later during outpatient check-up. Having these therapeutic data a special emphasise was given to the same group of drugs and their administration was investigated in patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome with elevated troponin-T levels in the year 2002.", 
    "51": "In the study of years 1999-2000 at the discharge 175 of 200 patients received ACE-inhibitor (87%), 121 (60%) beta-blocker, 180 (90%) antiplatelet and 102 (51%) statin therapy. At the time of the control performed 6 months later 85% of the patients were on ACE-inhibitor, 88% on beta-blocker, 77% on aspirin and 47% on statin therapy. In this high risk population during the 6 months control the LDL-cholesterol goal of 2.5 mmol/l was attained in the 17% of patients. In the survey performed in 2002 the use of beta-receptor blocker increased to 85%, antiplatelet drug and statin administration to 95% and 57%, respectively.", 
    "52": "Although the administration of drugs improving life expectancy in the authors' department is comparable with the published Hungarian and international data, effort to the widespread application of the ever growing principles of the Evidence Based Medicine and continuous self-control are essential.", 
    "53": "Adaptation to hypoxia lessens myocardial ischemic injury. This study tested whether hypoxia-induced beta-adrenergic activity mobilizes mechanisms that protect myocardium during subsequent ischemia and reperfusion. Dogs were intermittent hypoxia conditioned (IHC) by a 20 days program of 5-8 daily, 5-10 min cycles of normobaric hypoxia (FIO2 = 9.5-10%), or sham conditioned with normoxic air, and metoprolol (beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist) was administered throughout the IHC program. Twenty-four hours after the last IHC session, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was occluded for 60 min, and then reperfused for 5 h. Area at risk (AAR) and infarct size (IS) were measured. IHC lowered IS/AAR from 38+/-6% in sham-conditioned dogs to 1.1+/-0.3%, and eliminated ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF) that occurred in 14 of 17 non-conditioned dogs. Metoprolol blunted IHC-evoked cardioprotection (IS/AAR=27+/-3%), and VT and/or VF occurred in 5 of 6 dogs. Metoprolol did not exacerbate ischemic injury in sham-conditioned dogs (IS/AAR=38+/-2%). Neither IHC nor metoprolol affected hematocrit or LAD collateral blood flow. A single IHC session failed to protect ischemic myocardium (IS/AAR = 36+/-8%), and protection was incomplete after 10 days of IHC (IS/AAR = 13+/-5%), suggesting that de novo protein synthesis was required for protection. Thus, episodic beta1-adrenergic activation during IHC evokes progressive development of powerful resistance to myocardial ischemia.", 
    "54": "In this article different aspects of chronic heart failure in old age are described. We mainly focus on the place of beta-blocker therapy in chronic heart failure. Beta-blockers are recommended for the treatment of stable chronic heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. There is additional information from recent studies that there is proven efficacy for beta-blocker therapy in patients with heart failure up to the age of 80 years. For patients with heart failure aged 80 and over the evidence to prescribe beta-blockers is limited. However, it is known that also in very elderly patients beta-blocker therapy is well tolerated. In patients with heart failure with preserved systolic ventricular function there is still no evidence that there is a beneficial effect of beta-blockers. It is still not clear if there are differences between beta-blocking agents. Of all beta-blockers, only bisoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol and metoprolol CR are proven effective in stable chronic heart failure with impaired left ventricular systolic function and can be recommended in elderly patients on standard treatment with diuretics and ACE inhibition.", 
    "55": "Documentation of psoriatic eruptions occurring with the initiation of various pharmacotherapy agents has been reported in the literature. Two such agents include lithium and beta-blocking drugs. By understanding the mechanism by which these drugs induce and exacerbate psoriasis, we may gain further understanding of the disease process of psoriasis as well as how to treat this side effect. This paper reviews the literature that has examined the mechanism by which lithium and beta-blockers may induce and exacerbate psoriasis. Mechanisms involving both immunologic and non-immunologic factors have been examined in various studies. No consensus has been reached and further investigation is needed. However, findings such as improvement with inositol supplementation in cases of lithium-induced and -exacerbated psoriasis and disparate histologic presentation of beta-blocker-induced psoriasis provide suggestions that both the origin and treatment of drug-induced psoriasis may be different than psoriasis that is unrelated to medications.", 
    "56": "Patients with left ventricular dysfunction who are undergoing major noncardiac vascular surgery are at increased risk of adverse postoperative events. We sought to evaluate whether perioperative medication use, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin, was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative in-hospital mortality in these high-risk patients. The study enrolled 511 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction <30%) who were undergoing major noncardiac vascular surgery. Cardiac risk factors and medication use were noted before surgery. Preoperative dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) was performed to identify patients with stress-induced myocardial ischemia. The end point was postoperative in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relation between perioperative medication use and mortality. The mean age of the study population was 64 +/- 11 years, and 75% were men. Perioperative use of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin was recorded in 215 (48%), 139 (27%), 107 (21%), and 125 patients (24%), respectively. Stress-induced myocardial ischemia occurred in 82 patients (16%). Sixty-four patients (13%) died. Perioperative use of ACE inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.91), beta-blockers (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.26), statins (OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.53), and aspirin (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.55), was significantly associated with a reduced incidence of mortality, after adjusting for cardiac risk factors and DSE results. In conclusion, the present study showed that the perioperative use of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin is independently associated with a reduced incidence of in-hospital mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction who are undergoing major noncardiac vascular surgery.", 
    "57": "Perioperative myocardial infarction following noncardiac surgery is a complex process with a variety of proposed etiologic factors. Perioperative beta-blockade has been reported to reduce perioperative myocardial infarction and cardiac death, with possible direct effects on longer-term outcome, particularly after vascular surgery. Despite two high-profile studies that have pushed this topic into the mainstream of medicine, the number of patients studied and outcomes observed remains limited, especially for a therapy recommended for widespread adoption in millions of patients globally. Observational analyses, small meta-analyses, and newer randomized trial data (primarily in abstract format) suggest the therapy is of benefit in high-risk patients, whereas in patients at intermediate or low risk, it is either mildly efficacious or neutral in effect. Adverse effects appear to be limited to the expected primary hemodynamic side effects of bradycardia and hypotension, although a suggestion of increased mortality has been reported in one observational analysis in the lowest-risk group. beta-Blockade may be associated with reduction in length of stay and reduced analgesic requirements, although these effects remain controversial. A single mega-trial being conducted outside of the United States with a target goal of 10,000 patients is ongoing and promises to provide definitive data within the next few years. Ongoing research into various etiologies of perioperative myocardial infarction and other medications with potential efficacy in this setting, including the important antiplatelet agents, must also be considered in developing recommendations for widespread adoption of perioperative beta-blockade.",

    "59": "The study included 193 stable patients referred to and subsequently seen at our heart failure clinic between 1995 and 2001 with an ejection fraction of 40% or less. They had 1906 visits (1661 with structured follow-up). Recommendations by heart failure specialists regarding medication influencing prognosis and adherence of referring physicians to them were recorded.", 
    "60": "Ninety-six percent of patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) when referred. The prescription rate of beta-blockers and spironolactone increased after publication of large trials (more than 80% in 2001). Doses were inappropriate for both ACE-inhibitors/ARBs (55% +/- 30% of target dose) and beta-blockers (29% +/- 24%). Recommendations were followed closely for dose reduction/discontinuation of all drugs (82%) and start/uptitration of spironolactone (78%). Adherence was less (P < .01) for start/uptitration of ACE inhibitors/ARBs (62%) and beta-blockers (48%). Recommendations regarding single-step start/uptitration were more successful (ACE-inhibitors/ARBs, 70%; beta-blockers, 63%; single-step of both, 67%) than multiple-step uptitration (ACE inhibitors/ARBs, 48%; beta-blocker, 38%; P < .001). This was particularly true if recommendations concerned multiple-step uptitration of both drugs (25%, P < .001). There was no difference between general practitioners and cardiologists.", 
    "61": "Although penetration of drugs beneficial in heart failure was high upon referral, doses were lower than recommended, and recommendations regarding changes were insufficiently adhered to by the referring physicians. Simple, one-step recommendations were better implemented and may be combined with direct prescriptions during control visits to guarantee adequate medical therapy.", 
    "62": "The hepatic extraction of metoprolol is reduced in rats with bilateral ureter ligation (BUL)-induced renal failure. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of uremic substances on the hepatic metabolism of metoprolol in rats with BUL. The metabolic rate in the liver microsomes of BUL rats was similar to that in sham rats, and there was no significant difference between sham and BUL rats in the effect of the supernatant of liver homogenates on the metabolism. The rate of metabolism in the liver microsomes in the presence of the plasma of BUL rats was also similar to that in the presence of the plasma of sham rats. These findings indicated that uremic substances which accumulate in BUL rats do not directly inhibit the activity of CYP2D2, which is responsible for the metabolism of metoprolol in the rat liver.", 
    "63": "Psoriasis is a common skin disorder that needs a long-term management, not only because, of its prevalence but also because of the profound impact it can have on patients quality of life. Drugs may result in exacerbation of a preexisting psoriasis, in induction of psoriatic lesions on clinically uninvolved skin in patients with psoriasis, or in precipitation of the disease in persons without family history of psoriasis or in predisposed individuals. The knowledge of the drugs that may induce, trigger, or exacerbate the disease is of primary importance in clinical practice. By reviewing the literature, there are many reports on drug-induced psoriasis, but the data are not univocal. We propose, when possible, the use of a probability score from the authors to obtain a better classification and further understanding of drug-induced psoriasis.", 
    "64": "Extensive randomised clinical trial data support the view that beta-blockers have a significant impact on the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease, especially those with coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure. Unfortunately, this essential treatment is often withheld from patients with asthma and from some patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The principal concern, a concern supported by a number of guidelines, is that beta-blockers may precipitate severe and potentially fatal bronchospasm. However, a number of studies, culminating in a recent meta-analysis, show that cardioselective beta-blockers are not only safe but are beneficial in patients with co-existing airways and coronary disease. In this article we review the evidence supporting the position that cardioselective beta-blockers, when introduced with care in both community and hospital settings, are safe in patients with mild airways disease and can significantly improve prognosis.",

A battery of hemodynamic measurements as facilitated by a thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter and indirect calorimetry were also measured before and after the 3-hour selective beta adrenergic blockade.", 
    "67": "Selective beta adrenergic blockade was associated with the 20% reduction in heart rate and a comparable decrease in cardiac output. Esmolol administration failed to affect systemic or pulmonary vascular resistance, oxygen consumption, hepatic or leg blood flow, energy expenditure, or ATP availability/energy charge within muscle. Esmolol infuse did incite a shift in fuel oxidation toward an increase in palmitate oxidation and with a decrease in the oxidation of glucose. There was no demonstrable influence beta1 adrenergic blockade on muscle protein kinetics.",

    "69": "1. Propranolol has been prescribed successfully to patients with cardiovascular diseases, but the exact mechanisms by which it reduces peripheral vascular resistance have been poorly investigated. 2. The present study was designed to investigate the relaxing effects of propranolol in the rat isolated aorta and mesenteric artery, focusing on the contribution of the nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP pathway and calcium entry blockade. Relaxation responses to propranolol were obtained in precontracted rat aortic and mesenteric artery rings. 3. DL-Propranolol (10-100 micromol/L) produced concentration-dependent relaxations in the aorta and mesenteric artery rings with intact endothelium. The isomers D- and L-propranolol produced relaxation responses that were equipotent to the racemic mixture. 4. Metoprolol (10-100 micromol/L) produced slight relaxations, whereas atenolol (10-100 micromol/L) had no relaxant activity. 5. The NO inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 micromol/L) and the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (1 micromol/L), as well as removal of the endothelium, significantly reduced the relaxation responses induced by the lower concentrations of propranolol without affecting maximal responses. In addition, DL-propranolol markedly increased cGMP levels in endothelium-intact preparations. 6. In Ca(2+)-free Krebs' solution, DL-propranolol (10-100 micromol/L) caused marked rightward shift in the concentration-response curves to CaCl(2), with a decrease of maximal responses in tissues with either intact or denuded endothelium. Nifedipine (1 micromol/L) in combination with DL-propranolol virtually abolished the CaCl(2)-induced contractile responses. 7. The relaxation responses induced by DL-propranolol were significantly reduced in aortic and mesenteric rings precontracted with phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (1 micromol/L). 8. In conclusion, DL-propranolol relaxes arterial smooth muscle by mechanisms involving activation of the NO-cGMP pathway and calcium influx blockade, independent of beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "70": "1. The present study assesses the effects of autonomic blockade (alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor and cholinergic) on cardiovascular function studied by heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV) and baroreflex sensitivity in rats using non-linear dynamics. Little is known about the influence of pharmacological autonomic nervous system interventions on non-linear cardiovascular regulatory indices. 2. In 13 conscious rats, heart rate and aortic blood pressure were measured continuously before, during and after autonomic blockade with atropine, phentolamine and propranolol. Non-linear scaling properties were studied using 1/f slope, fractal dimension and long- and short-term correlation. Non-linear complexity was described with correlation dimension, Lyapunov exponent and approximate entropy. Non-linear indices were compared with linear time and frequency domain indices. 3. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade did not alter the non-linear characteristics of HRV and BPV, although low-frequency power of HRV was depressed. Alpha-adrenoceptor blockade decreased the scaling behaviour of HRV, whereas cholinergic blockade decreased the complexity of the non-linear system of HRV. For BPV, the scaling behaviour was increased during alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and the complexity was increased during cholinergic blockade. The linear indices of HRV and BPV were decreased. 4. The present results indicate that the beta-adrenoceptor system has little involvement in the generation of non-linear HRV and BPV in rats. 5. Alpha-adrenoceptor blockade mostly influenced the scaling properties of the time series, whereas cholinergic blockade induced changes in the complexity measures. 6. The absence of the baroreflex mechanism can trigger a compensatory feed-forward system increasing the complexity of BPV.", 
    "71": "1. The participation of sympathetic efferent fibres in wound healing is not well understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor blockade on rat excisional cutaneous wound healing. 2. Male rats were treated orally with propranolol dissolved in drinking water (50 mg/kg per day), whereas the control group received drinking water without propranolol. Propranolol was administered daily until rats were killed. A full-thickness excisional lesion was performed. The lesion area was measured to evaluate wound contraction. After rats had been killed, lesion and adjacent normal skin were formol fixed and paraffin embedded. Sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin, Sirius red or Toluidine blue and immunostained for a-smooth muscle actin or proliferating cell nuclear antigen. 3. Propranolol-treated rats presented delayed wound contraction and epidermal healing and decreased hydroxyproline levels, collagen density and neo-epidermis thickness. Blockade of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors increased epidermal and connective tissue cell proliferation, polymorphonuclear leucocyte migration, myofibroblast density and mast cell migration. The volume density of blood vessels was increased and vessels were more dilated in propranolol-treated animals. 4. Thus, we conclude that beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor blockade impairs cutaneous wound healing. This information should be considered by physicians during the treatment of patients who present with hypertension and problems in the healing process (such as venous ulcers).", 
    "72": "The aim of this study was to define the characteristics of heart rates and myocardial changes in rats exposed to carbon monoxide (CO), and the effects of reoxygenation, atenolol (a beta-blocker) and melatonin after sublethal CO intoxication. Widespread use of beta-blockers in cardiology practice and growing literature on the positive effect of melatonin in ischaemia reperfusion lead us to question their effects in case of CO intoxication. Rats were exposed to CO. After sublethal intoxication the rats were reoxygenated with ambient air. Subsequently blood values, electrocardiographic recordings and pathological changes were examined for each groups. Five rats died after CO intoxication in the control group: no myocardial changes were seen in light microscopy. However, myocardium of seven reoxygenated rats presented contraction bands. Seven reoxygenated rats pretreated with atenolol had a higher number of contraction bands of myocardial cells. Seven reoxygenated rats pretreated with melatonin had more contraction bands than reoxygenated rats, and heart rate recordings of these animals revealed a profund and sustained bradycardia. Thus, melatonin and atenolol appear to have some adverse effects in CO intoxication on the myocardial cells.", 
    "73": "Also poorly metabolized drugs, including certain beta-blocking agents, can be susceptible to drug interactions caused by transporter inhibitors and inducers. Thus, our aim was to investigate the effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of atenolol in healthy people. In a randomized cross-over study with two phases, nine healthy volunteers received a 5-day pretreatment with rifampicin (600 mg daily) or placebo. On day 6, a single 100 mg dose of atenolol was administered orally. The plasma concentrations of atenolol and its excretion into urine were measured up to 33 hr after dosing. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were recorded in a sitting position before the intake of atenolol and 2, 4, 6, and 10 hr later. During the rifampicin phase, the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of atenolol was decreased to 81% and renal clearance increased to 109% of the placebo phase values (P<0.05). Rifampicin pretreatment reduced, albeit not statistically significantly, also the peak plasma concentration (Cmax), AUC(0-33 hr), and amount of atenolol excreted to 85% (P=0.139), 81% (P=0.053), and 86% (P=0.12) of the respective placebo phase values. The average heart rate and diastolic blood pressure were slightly higher during the rifampicin phase compared with the placebo phase (P<0.05). To conclude, although the inducing effect of rifampicin may not have been at its maximum by day 6, rifampicin has only a minor effect on the pharmacokinetics of atenolol evidenced by a slight reduction in its bioavailability.", 
    "74": "Pheochromocytoma may infrequently lead to dilated cardiomyopathy, which may reverse partially or completely after treatment. Progressive dyspnea, palpitations, and paroxysmal attacks of severe hypertension leading to cardiac failure had developed in a 25-yr-old woman. Chest radiography and echocardiography revealed a massive 4-chamber dilatation of the heart with an ejection fraction of 12%. Twenty-four-h urinary vanillylmandelic acid and metanephrine levels were elevated. Magnetic resonance imaging detected a large mass lesion in the right adrenal gland. Oral glucose tolerance testing revealed diabetes mellitus. Medical drug therapy with alpha-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, beta-blocker, digoxin, and diuretic rapidly improved her cardiac condition. Repeat echocardiogram showed that the left ventricular function had improved substantially. The clinical condition of excess catecholaminemia (and thus, arterial hypertension and the abnormality of the glucose metabolism) subsided with complete resolution of the congestive heart failure following the surgical removal of the tumor. Evaluation for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) revealed an elevated calcitonin level demonstrated by fine needle aspiration biopsy. There were no biochemical evidences for primary hyperparathyroidism. Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN 2A) syndrome was diagnosed. An overwhelming secretion of catecholamine might cause severe cardiomyopathy and impair glucose metabolism, as evidenced by the improvement of both conditions following the medical treatment of catecholaminemia and surgical resection of the tumor.", 
    "75": "This article provides information and a commentary on trials relevant to the pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of heart failure, presented at the American College of Cardiology 55th Annual Scientific Session held in March 2006. All reports should be considered as preliminary data, as analyses may change in the final publication. Darbepoetin alfa increased haemoglobin levels in heart failure patients and improved some aspects of quality of life compared to placebo. In the ASTEROID study rosuvastatin significantly reduced LDL-cholesterol levels and induced regression of atherosclerosis in patients with CAD. Rosuvastatin also produced a significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels in heart failure patients in the UNIVERSE study, but had no effect on left ventricular remodelling compared to placebo. The paediatric carvedilol study failed to show a benefit of carvedilol in children with heart failure. Ultrafiltration produced a greater weight and fluid loss than intravenous diuretics in heart failure patients with volume overload in the UNLOAD study but did not exert a greater improvement in breathlessness; however, ultrafiltration did reduce readmission rates. The ICELAND MI study showed that CMR imaging was more sensitive than ECG or clinical criteria for detecting myocardial infarction.", 
    "76": "Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta-blockers have been proved to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI), studies show that these agents are consistently underused in this population. Further, morbidity and mortality remain high even when standard-of-care therapies are applied. Thus, new strategies have been sought to better counteract the maladaptive effects of neurohormonal stimulation in post-AMI heart failure. The Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) demonstrated that the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone, when used in addition to standard therapy, results in significant incremental improvements in survival and morbidity and is safe and well tolerated in this setting. Based on this, major therapeutic guidelines in the United States and Europe now strongly recommend that all eligible patients with concomitant heart failure post-AMI be treated with an aldosterone blocker in addition to an ACE inhibitor (or an ARB) and a beta-blocker. To achieve needed improvements in outcomes in this population, early and consistent initiation of these evidence-based, guideline-recommended therapies in all eligible patients is crucial.", 
    "77": "In NMR diffusion experiments to study ligand-protein binding equilibria, the spectral background due to broad protein resonances can contribute significantly to the measured ligand signal intensity resulting in erroneous binding affinities. One method to suppress the protein spectral background involves coupling a CPMG pulse train before or after the BPPSTE pulse sequence to allow for differential T(2) relaxation of the broad protein resonances. Here, we present an improved method, the Gradient Phase Encoded Spin-lock (GraPES) experiment that integrates the relaxation filter into the diffusion period. Compared with sequential CPMG-BPPSTE pulse sequences, GraPES offers effective suppression of the protein background with improved signal-to-noise ratios and shorter experiment times.", 
    "78": "Neural transplantation is a promising approach for treating neurodegenerative disease. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) are self-renewing and multipotent and thus are good candidates for donor cells when they have been clearly defined to differentiate into neurons. As neuronal differentiation follows cell cycle exit, we investigated whether neuron production from NPCs is increased by treatment with cell cycle blockers. NPCs from E12.5 rat ventral mesencephalon were cultured as neurospheres in DMEM/F12 medium containing N2 supplements and bFGF. Treatment of NPCs with deferoxamine, a G1/S phase blocker, increased the number of beta-tubulin III-positive cells after differentiation, concomitant with increases of MAP2 mRNA and protein, and a decrease of GFAP protein. Further, an increase in beta-tubulin III/BrdU double-positive cells and a decrease in GFAP/BrdU double-positive cells were confirmed. In real-time PCR, the expressions of p21(cip1), p27(kip1) and p57(kip2) mRNAs remained unaltered for 8 h after treatment with deferoxamine but were significantly elevated after 1 day. Deferoxamine specifically enhanced the elevation of p27(kip1) mRNA at 1-2 days and the accumulation of p27(kip1) protein at 3 days, along with the activation of neuroD promoter and the elevation of neuroD mRNA. Transfection of p27(kip1) into NPCs induced activation of neuroD promoter and increase of number of beta-tubulin III-positive cells. These data suggest that pretreatment with deferoxamine increases the number of neurons from NPCs related to prolonged p27(kip1) elevation and activation of the neuroD signaling pathway. In this way, regulation of the cell cycle should be a useful first step in engineering NPCs for neural transplantation.",

The odds of cocaine abstinence showed a marginally significant increase over time in the propranolol group (p=0.06) but not in the other three groups. In highly medication-adherent patients, treatment retention was significantly better in the propranolol group compared to the placebo group (p=0.01) and the odds of cocaine abstinence increased significantly over time in the propranolol group but not in the other three groups.", 
    "82": "In the intent-to-treat sample, none of the three active treatments (propranolol, amantadine or their combination) was significantly more effective than placebo in promoting abstinence from cocaine among patients who entered treatment with more severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms. Among patients highly adherent to study medication, propranolol treatment was associated with better treatment retention and higher rates of cocaine abstinence compared to placebo.", 
    "83": "Autoantibodies against beta-adrenoceptors might be involved in different cardiomyopathic diseases such as idopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, Chagas' disease and ventricular arrhythmias. To study the effects of such antibodies on the whole heart, we made use of a new technique allowing the measurement of Ca++ transients as well as action potentials in Langendorff preparations of mouse hearts. Mouse antibodies directed against the second extracellular loop of the beta2-adrenoceptor induced conduction blocks which could be washed away by the beta2-adrenoceptor inverse agonist ICI118,551, confirming the specificity and non-toxicity of these events. These results were confirmed by the use of a monoclonal antibody, monospecific for the beta2-adrenoceptor and the beta2-specific full agonist, clenbuterol. Both increased slightly, but significantly, the beating frequency but their main effect was the production of conduction blocks. In contrast, a monoclonal antibody, monospecific for the beta1-adrenoceptor, highly increased the beating frequency without interfering with the conduction. Our results suggest that stimulation of the beta2-adrenoceptor by anti-receptor antibodies in the conduction tissues leads to conduction disturbances, probably mediated by coupling to a different pathway than the classical Gs pathway. They confirm that anti-beta2 adrenoceptor antibodies could be responsible for ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "84": "Little is known of the cardiorespiratory control mechanisms utilized by hypoxia-tolerant teleost fish to tolerate prolonged periods (h) of near anoxic exposure. Here, we report on the cardiorespiratory control mechanisms of the common carp Cyprinus carpio L. during normoxia and prolonged, severe hypoxic (<0.3 mg O(2) L(-1)) exposure at acclimation temperatures of 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, and 15 degrees C. Through serial intra-arterial injections of alpha - and beta -adrenergic, cholinergic, and purinergic antagonists while measuring cardiac output (Q), heart rate (f(H)), ventral aortic blood pressure, and respiration rate, we established that autonomic cardiovascular and respiratory control was preserved during severe hypoxia at all three acclimation temperatures and contributed to downregulation of cardiorespiratory activity. Specifically, inhibitory cholinergic tone mediated up to 76% reductions in f(H) and Q during hypoxia, whereas the accompanying arterial hypotension was attenuated by an upregulation of an alpha -adrenergically mediated peripheral vasoconstriction. Despite the overall cardiac downregulation, a large, stimulatory cardiac beta -adrenergic tone was present during prolonged, severe hypoxia, possibly to protect the heart from attendant acidotic conditions. Purinergic blockade, following alpha -adrenergic and cholinergic antagonists, showed that the hypoxic ventilatory depression, which reversed the 2.3- to 7.7-fold increases in respiration rate that occurred with the onset of hypoxia, was a result of purinergic inhibition at all three acclimation temperatures. In contrast, purinergic inhibition of cardiac activity during hypoxia might be important only at 5 degrees C. Finally, given that cardiac power output was reduced 72%-87% during prolonged, severe hypoxia and that glycolysis yields approximately 94% less ATP per mole glucose than oxidative phosphorylation, it seems unlikely that the common carp sufficiently reduces its cardiac energy demand to a level to preclude activation of a partial Pasteur effect. This means that glycogen stores will be used and waste products will accumulate at faster rates, a finding that may help explain why the common carp cannot tolerate such extended periods of severe hypoxia (weeks to months) at cold acclimation temperatures as the freshwater turtle, which is able to reduce its cardiac energy demand to a level that does not require a Pasteur effect and also blunts autonomic cardiovascular control.", 
    "85": "Renal failure causes sympathetic overactivity and inadequate capillary growth in response to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in experimental renal failure, as well as in uremic patients. In nonuremic animals, sympathetic overactivity was shown to suppress capillary growth. The purpose of this study was to examine whether blockade with alpha- and beta-adrenoblockers ameliorates the capillary deficit that was documented in the hearts of rats with moderate renal failure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 3 days after surgical ablation [subtotal nephrectomy (SNX)] or sham operation (sham), were treated with phenoxybenzamine, metoprolol, or a combination of both: After 12 weeks, the hearts were investigated using morphometric and stereologic techniques. The length density of myocardial capillaries was lower (p<0.05) in untreated SNX than in sham (2,786+/-372 vs 3,397+/-602 mm/mm3); the decrease was abrogated by metoprolol (3,305+/-624 mm/mm3), but not by phenoxybenzamin (2,628+/-480 mm/mm3). The intercapillary distance increased (p<0.05) in SNX (20.5+/-1.5 microm) and tended to be lower after metoprolol treatment (19.0+/-1.9 microm). The media area of intramyocardial arterioles was significantly higher in untreated SNX (1,158+/-1,343 vs 686+/-771 microm2 in sham). Metoprolol in nonhypotensive doses prevents the capillary deficit in the hearts of rats with moderate renal failure and presents an argument for an important role of sympathetic overactivity in the genesis of the capillary deficit in moderate chronic renal insufficiency.",

In contrast, the effect size reported in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) may change over time because the sum of all kinds of bias influencing the reported effectiveness is not necessarily constant. As this would affect the validity of meta-analyses, we tested the hypothesis that the reported effect size decreases over time. Furthermore, we tested three hypotheses that would explain a possible change.", 
    "91": "Because of well established outcome measures, the lipid-lowering drugs Pravastatin and Atorvastatin (serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C) and the anti-glaucoma drugs Timolol and Latanoprost (intraocular pressure, IOP) were chosen for this investigation. Studies were identified by a standardized MEDLINE search. RCTs investigating the above identified medications administered as monotherapy, and in defined dosages, were included. Publication year, baseline (= pre-treatment value in the treatment group of interest) and post intervention means, number of patients and the assignment to experimental or control group were extracted for each study.",

    "94": "Recent studies have demonstrated that increased QT interval variability (QTV) is associated with a greater susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias and that patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) were prone to ventricular arrhythmias during the daytime. The goal of the present study was to investigate the circadian variation of the QTV and to determine whether beta-blocker therapy improves the temporal fluctuation of the ventricular repolarization in patients with MI.", 
    "95": "The study population consisted of 15 MI patients who had not received beta-blocker therapy, 11 MI patients who had received beta-blocker therapy, and 12 healthy subjects. Twenty-four hour Holter monitoring was obtained, and the RR and QT intervals were calculated automatically from 512 consecutive sinus beats for every 2 hours.", 
    "96": "In the daytime, the QT-SD was significantly greater in the MI group than in the healthy subjects (P<0.01), but there was no difference in the QT-SD when comparing the beta-blocker group to the control group. Moreover, the QT variability index and the QT variance normalized for the mean QT were similar pattern with QT-SD. The heart rate variability did not significantly differ when compared between the three study groups.", 
    "97": "These data indicate that the QTV increases during the daytime in patients with MI and that this circadian effect is prevented by beta-blocker therapy. Thus, beta-blocker therapy may reverse the maladaptation of the ventricular repolarization to the change in the heart rate and may thereby reduce the ventricular arrhythmias and decrease the mortality in patients with MI.", 
    "98": "We now know pharmacological negative inotropic agent, i. e. beta-blocker, increase cardiac contractility when given chronically to patients with chronic heart failure. In contrast, positive inotropic agents have consistently been shown to increase mortality when given chronically. The routine use of inotropes in either acute or the chronic setting is not supported by the available data. However, some appropriate uses of inotropes are as temporary use of refractory acutely decompensated heart failure, or as a bridge to definitive treatment, or palliative measure in a subset of patients with end-stage heart failure.", 
    "99": "The efficacy of beta-blockers for improving the survival rate of patients with chronic heart failure has been confirmed by results deriving from a series of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) such as MERIT-HF, CIBIS-II, and COPERNICUS. Thus, treatment guidelines recommend that beta-blockers should be used in all patients with heart failure resulting from left ventricular systolic dysfunction who can tolerate with beta-blockers. Despite these guidelines, actual rates of beta-blocker prescription has been lower than expected, and when used, beta-blockers are generally prescribed in doses lower than what has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in RCTs. In the MUCHA trial conducted in Japan, the beta-blocker carvedilol decreased the cardiovascular risk for hospitalization in a dose-dependent manner. The 5 mg/day dose achieved a remarkable reduction that was nearly as great as the 20 mg/day dose. Whether this low-dose therapy was sufficient was not fully investigated by the MUCHA trial. Moreover, there is an ethnic difference in the effective dose between patients in Japan and Western countries, which may depend on a difference in beta1-receptor sensitivity. J-CHF trial may suggest that low doses of carvedilol under 2.5 mg/day have a beneficial effect. This trial is a randomized multi-center parallel group dose-comparison study, and with sub-studies such as an analysis of genetic polymorphisms on voluntary participation. This trial may serve as a tailored approach for Japanese physicians in the clinical management of heart failure.", 
    "100": "The goal of the treatment of chronic heart failure is improvement of patient's prognosis and QOL. To achieve this goal, new pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches have been developed. ACE inhibitor - and beta-blocker-treatment added to the standard therapy has been established to improve the prognosis, and ICD, cardiac resynchronization treatment (CRT) with biventricular pacing and LV assist device also contribute to the advances in the therapeutic progress. However, recent clinical trials for the new drugs which antagonize the endothelin receptors and TNF receptors failed to demonstrate the benefit of these new drugs. Establishment of the therapeutic strategies for treatment of diastolic heart failure is also another problem to be solved.", 
    "101": "The use of carvidolol as well as atenolol in patients with hypertensive disease associated with ischemic heart disease resulted in sufficient hypotensive and antianginal effects, although patients on carvidolol have expereinced more favorable hemodinamic changes in comparision with atenolol, especially the patients with heart insufficiency. An increase in miocardium contractility under carvidolol use had a linear function depending on heart insufficiency severity.", 
    "102": "Prophylactic treatment is mainly intended to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, enhance response to acute medications, improve patient function and reduce disability. Sufficient evidence and consensus exist to recommend propranolol, timolol, amitriptyline, pizotifen, divalproex, sodium valproate and topiramate as first line agents for migraine prevention. These drugs can halve the frequency of attacks in 50% of patients. The anticipated benefit must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with each agent in determining the optimal preventive regimen for individual patients considering any comorbid conditions that are often present. The decision to treat and the choice of prophylactic drug must be taken with the patient. It is important to balance expectations and therapeutic realities for each particular drug. Recent data on the effect of prophylactic treatment on trigeminovascular activation and on cortical spreading depression emphasise the importance of developing research on migraine-preventive drugs.", 
    "103": "The aim of the study was to assess the effect of the prolonged intake of three beta-blocking drugs (propranolol, metoprolol and nebivolol) on the sexual behavior and penile microcirculation of rabbits. Drugs were administered p.o. for 9 weeks and every three weeks in each group (n=13) one subgroup (n=7) performed behavioral tests, whereas in the second subgroup (n=6) penile microcirculation was measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter. The copulation studies revealed significant impairment of sexual function only in the propranolol treated group. The measured behavioral parameters suggest that at a given dose propranolol affects more performance rather than arousal aspects of rabbits' sexual behavior. In the course of the whole study no significant difference was observed among groups in penile blood flow. The data indicate that among the beta-blockers given only propranolol interferes with sexual behavior, and that beta-blockers do not appear to have a negative effect on penile microcirculation.", 
    "104": "The pharmacologic management of hypertension has long been implicated in the genesis of erectile dysfunction; the latter is considered the main reason of nonadherence to antihypertensive therapy. Older-generation antihypertensive drugs (central-acting, beta blockers, diuretics) negatively affect erectile function, while newer-generation agents (calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) seem to have neutral effects. Preliminary data with the latest drugs (angiotensin receptor blockers) point to a beneficial effect on erectile function. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, can be safely and effectively administered to hypertensive patients (even when on multiple-agent antihypertensive therapy), with a caution regarding alpha blockers. In the case when erectile dysfunction is considered to result from antihypertensive therapy, the treating physician may either add phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors or substitute current treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers.", 
    "105": "Reduction of blood pressure to guideline goals (i.e., <130/80 mm Hg) in persons with diabetes is crucial to optimally reduce cardiovascular events and kidney disease progression. Since many patients will be >20/10 mm Hg above this goal, most guidelines recommend using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system in concert with a thiazide-like diuretic to achieve goal blood pressure. Meta-analyses of clinical trials indicate that while all classes of antihypertensive agents reduce cardiovascular risk, they exert different effects on glucose utilization and lipids and, hence, may affect morbidity. Specifically, beta blockers, in general, worsen insulin resistance and increase triglycerides in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, they are not recommended as initial therapy for hypertension treatment in the absence of heart failure or recent myocardial infarction, especially in the elderly. Recent studies support the notion that newer beta blockers with vasodilating effects have a better metabolic profile when compared with those that purely affect beta receptors. Thus, vasodilating beta blockers, by being neutral on glycemic and metabolic factors, are associated with less use of additional medication for lipid or glucose control and may provide a potentially greater cardiovascular risk reduction by virtue of these effects.", 
    "106": "Insulin resistance is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Therapies to lower blood pressure should not decrease insulin sensitivity. Some b-adrenergic blocking agents can have an adverse effect on insulin sensitivity. This study examined the effect of extended-release metoprolol succinate on insulin sensitivity. Nondiabetics with hypertension (N=30) were started on (or changed to) hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg daily for 14 days. Patients with blood pressure>140/90 mm Hg while taking HCTZ alone underwent an insulin clamp procedure to quantify insulin sensitivity. Metoprolol succinate treatment was begun at 50 mg daily and titrated to a dose that lowered blood pressure to <140/90 mm Hg. Following 12 weeks of metoprolol succinate plus HCTZ therapy, the insulin clamp procedure was repeated. On metoprolol succinate plus HCTZ treatment, there were no significant changes in insulin clamp measures of insulin sensitivity. Plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly on metoprolol succinate plus HCTZ. When b-blocker therapy is considered, metoprolol succinate can be used to treat hypertension without adverse metabolic effects.",

Three pts (4.8% of the total population) developed a clinical relevant, polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia, 3-48 h after initiation of amiodarone loading. Coronary heart disease was present in all of these pts, and in two of them left ventricular ejection fraction was severely reduced. The mean QTc in these pts was only slightly prolonged; mean heart rate was significantly decreased compared with the total study population (61.0+/-7.5 vs. 74.5+/-24.1 bpm; P < or = 0.05). In all pts with pro-arrhythmia, amiodarone (two pts i.v., one patient oral) was initiated during concomitant beta-blocker/digitalis therapy.

    "110": "The sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine has been found to increase mucosal adherence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in explants of murine cecum and porcine distal colon. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that norepinephrine augments the initial, loose adherence of this important pathogen to the intestinal mucosa. In mucosal sheets of porcine cecum or proximal, spiral and distal colon mounted in Ussing chambers, norepinephrine (10 microM, contraluminal addition) increased mucosal adherence of wild-type E. coli O157:H7 strain 85-170; in the cecal mucosa, this effect occurred within 30-90 min after bacterial inoculation. In addition, norepinephrine transiently increased short-circuit current in cecal and colonic mucosal sheets, a measure of active anion transport. Norepinephrine was effective in promoting cecal adherence of a non-O157 E. coli strain as well as E. coli O157:H7 eae or espA mutant strains that are incapable of intimate mucosal attachment. Nerve fibers immunoreactive for the norepinephrine synthetic enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase appeared in close proximity to the cecal epithelium, and the norepinephrine reuptake blocker cocaine, like norepinephrine and the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist UK-14,304, increased E. coli O157:H7 adherence. These results suggest that norepinephrine, acting upon the large bowel mucosa, modulates early, non-intimate adherence of E. coli O157:H7 and probably other mucosa-associated bacteria. Sympathetic nerves innervating the cecocolonic mucosa may link acute stress exposure or psychostimulant abuse with an increased microbial colonization of the intestinal surface. This in turn may alter host susceptibility to enteric infections.",

An intact response to acute CL-316243 treatment was observed in MKR mice. Chronic intraperitoneal CL-316243 treatment of MKR mice reduced blood glucose and serum insulin levels. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps exhibited improvement of the whole body insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis concurrently with enhanced insulin action in liver and adipose tissue. Treating MKR mice with CL-316243 significantly lowered serum and hepatic lipid levels, in part due to increased whole body triglyceride clearance and fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes. A significant reduction in total body fat content and epididymal fat weight was observed along with enhanced metabolic rate in both wild-type and MKR mice after treatment. These data demonstrate that beta3-adrenergic activation improves the diabetic state of nonobese diabetic MKR mice by potentiation of free fatty acid oxidation by adipose tissue, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for beta3-adrenergic agonists in nonobese diabetic subjects.", 
    "131": "Transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) is involved in several cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. At the cell surface, TGF-beta binds to serine-threonine kinase transmembrane receptors (type II and type I) to initiate Smad-dependent intracellular signaling cascades. During the early stages of skeletal muscle differentiation, myotubes start to evoke spontaneous electrical activity in association with contractions that arise following the maturation of the excitation-contraction apparatus. In this work, we report that TGF-beta-dependent signaling is regulated by electrical activity in developing rat primary myotubes, as determined by Smad2 phosphorylation, Smad4 nuclear translocation, and p3TPLux reporter activity. This electrical activity-dependent regulation is associated with changes in TGF-beta type I receptor (TbetaRI) levels, correlated with changes in transducing receptors at the cell membrane (measured through radiolabeling binding assays). The inhibition of electrical activity with tetrodotoxin, a voltage-dependent sodium channel blocker, increases TbetaRI levels via a transcription-dependent mechanism. In contrast, the promotion of electrical activity in myotube cultures, induced by the up-regulation of voltage-dependent sodium channels or by direct stimulation with extracellular electrodes, causes TbetaRI levels to decrease. Similar results were obtained in denervated adult muscles, suggesting that electrical activity-dependent regulation of TbetaRI also occurs in vivo. Additional results suggest that this activity-dependent regulation is mediated by myogenin. Altogether, these findings support the possibility for a novel regulatory mechanism acting on TGF-beta signaling cascade in skeletal muscle cells.", 
    "132": "Given that adverse effects of chronic sympathetic activation are mediated by all three adrenergic receptor subtypes (beta1, beta2, alpha1), we examined the effects of standard doses of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate (metoprolol controlled release/extended release [CR/XL]) on hemodynamics, myocardial metabolism, and regional organ perfusion.", 
    "133": "Both beta1 selective and combined adrenergic blockade reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure. Whether there are advantages of one class over the other remains controversial, even in the wake of the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET). Similarly, the mechanistic basis for the relative differences is incompletely understood.", 
    "134": "Thirty-three conscious, chronically instrumented dogs with pacing-induced (240 min(-1) for 4 weeks) dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) were randomized to carvedilol (25 mg twice daily, Coreg, Glaxo Smith Kline, Research Triangle, North Carolina) or metoprolol succinate (100 mg qd, Toprol XL, Astra Zeneca, Wilmington, Delaware). Left ventricular and systemic hemodynamics, myocardial substrate uptake, and norepinephrine spillover were measured before and after three days of treatment. Regional (renal, hepatic, skeletal muscle) blood flows were measured using neutron-activated microspheres.", 
    "135": "Both agents had comparable heart rate effects. However, carvedilol-treated dogs showed significantly greater increases in stroke volume and cardiac output and decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and systemic vascular resistance. Carvedilol increased renal, hepatic, and skeletal muscle blood flow. Carvedilol increased myocardial glucose uptake and suppressed norepinephrine and glucagon. Carvedilol antagonized the response to exogenous norepinephrine to a greater extent than metoprolol CR/XL.", 
    "136": "At doses inducing comparable heart rate reductions, short-term treatment with carvedilol had superior hemodynamic and metabolic effects compared with metoprolol CR/XL. These data suggest important advantages of blocking all three adrenergic receptor subtypes in DCM.", 
    "137": "A rapid and sensitive ion-pair HPLC method using a monolithic column and fluorescence detection has been developed for quantification of sotalol in plasma. The assay enables the measurement of sotalol for therapeutic drug monitoring with a minimum quantification limit of 10 ng ml(-1). The analytical method involves simple, one-step protein precipitation and no extraction procedure is needed. Sample preparation is fast and the analytical recovery was complete. The separation was carried out in reversed-phase conditions using a Chromolith Performance (RP-18e, 100 mm x 4.6 mm) column at ambient temperature. The mobile phase was 10% acetonitrile, 0.001 M heptane sulfonic acid, 0.02 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and distilled water to 100%, adjusted to pH 5.5 at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min. The excitation wavelength was set at 235 nm, emission at 300 nm. The calibration curve was linear over the concentration range 20-1500 ng ml(-1). The coefficients of variation for inter-day and intra-day assay were found to be less than 7%. The method has been applied to the determination of sotalol in plasma from 12 subjects dosed with racemic sotalol.", 
    "138": "The safety profile of the different glaucoma medications is an important issue when initiating therapy in glaucomatous patients. The decision on which medication to prescribe depends not only on the type of glaucoma, but also on the patient's medical history and needs a detailed knowledge of the potential side-effects of each medication. Medications side effects may be an important cause of non adherence for the individual patient The properties of the drugs, the composition of the glaucoma eyedrops and the dynamics of ocular drug absorption must be considered. The ocular surface changes induced by long-term antiglaucomatous treatment especially by their preservatives are a major cause of intolerance or poor tolerance to glaucoma eyedrops. Moreover topically applied ophthalmic medications can attain sufficient serum levels through absorption into conjunctival and nasal mucosas to have systemic effects and to potentially interact with other drugs. Then this presentation will deal with the ocular and systemic side-effects which can be encountered with the different classes of the currently available glaucoma topical medications. Recommendations than can be applied to reduce both frequency and severity of side-effects of glaucoma medications will be stressed on. Concurrently patients should be fully informed not only about their disease but also the medications they used and what side-effects they have to expect.",

    "140": "This was a prospective, open-label clinical study.", 
    "141": "A total of 44 eyes of 22 eligible patients whose intraocular pressure (IOP) was inadequately controlled by topical beta-blocker were enrolled. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients with primary open angle glaucoma who either had IOP measurements > or = 22 mmHg while on topical beta-blocker monotherapy or had IOP measurements > or = 18 mmHg while on dual therapy (topical beta-blocker and a second drug of a different class which was to be discontinued prior to the study to allow washing out of its effects).", 
    "142": "Baseline IOP, pupil size, blood pressure and pulse rate were initially measured; the patients were then examined at 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 18th and 24th weeks of following commencement of topical unoprostone isopropyl therapy (given twice daily).", 
    "143": "IOP pupil size, blood pressure and pulse rate were measured and were compared to baseline values.", 
    "144": "In 44 eyes of 22 eligible patients, unoprostone isopropyl resulted in a statistically significant IOP reduction of 24.6% (p < 0.02). The mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 132.79 +/- 22.11 mmHg (range 100-180 mmHg) at baseline to 125.77 +/- 18.40 mmHg (range 80-160 mmHg) at 24th week after unoprostone isopropyl administration. This reduction was statistically significant (p = 0.002) but was unlikely to have clinical importance. Both mean diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.344), pulse rate (p = 0.306), and pupil diameter (p = 0.107) were not significantly affected.", 
    "145": "Topical unoprostone isopropyl beneficially provides additive IOP lowering effect to topical beta-blocker in patients with primary open angle glaucoma. No serious systemic side effects were found in the present study.", 
    "146": "Retroconduction (ventriculo-atrial conduction) remains a problem for patients with implanted cardiac rhythm devices. Pacemaker algorithms can detect and terminate endless loop tachycardia (ELT), but actual prevention of ELT may require anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs). Similarly, AADs can affect ICD rhythm discrimination algorithms that depend on atrio-ventricular ratios. There is concern whether these drugs remain effective during stress situations.", 
    "147": "Electrophysiologic studies that included retroconduction testing using slow ramp pacing were done in 1332 patients. The presence or absence of retroconduction at baseline and with drug was recorded, as was the rate at block. As a stress surrogate, isoproterenol was used to test retroconduction and reversal of drug-induced block.", 
    "148": "Procainamide, mexiletine, phenytoin, disopyramide, quinidine, beta-blockers, encainide, and amiodarone caused complete retrograde block or decreased the rate at which block occurred (mean 76% of patients, p < 0.008), whereas digoxin, lidocaine, diltiazem, and verapamil did not. Isoproterenol (in the absence of AADs) increased the rate at block in 82% of 404 patients with retroconduction at baseline (p < 0.005). Of 319 patients without retroconduction at baseline, 134 (42%) developed retroconduction after isoproterenol. Isoproterenol reversed retrograde block in 39% of patients with block on an AAD. Amiodarone, digoxin, and the combination of digoxin plus a beta-blocker were most effective at resisting this reversal of ventriculo-atrial block (80%, 68%, and 75% respectively).", 
    "149": "Most of the AADs reviewed increase the cycle length at block or abolish retroconduction, while isoproterenol has the opposite effect. Anti-arrhythmic medications, particularly amiodarone, digoxin, and the combination of digoxin plus a beta-blocker may be considered for a patient with multiple ELT episodes or certain ICD detection problems.",

    "151": "Thirty-seven patients (age 31+/-16 years) with refractory recurrent NCS being 19 females where prospectively studied. All patients became asymptomatic and had a negative tilt table test (TT) after pharmacological therapy. The treatment was interrupted and one month later, a new TT with no medication was carried out. The probability free of symptoms recurrence was analyzed according to sex, age, number of syncope episodes previously to the treatment, clinical history time, treatment time, drug free from treatment time and TT result.", 
    "152": "Twenty-two patients (59%) presented recurrence during a mean follow-up of 21+/-19.7 months. The variables related to greater recurrence were number of previous syncope (p=0.0248), positive TT after interruption of the therapy (p=0.0002) and female gender (p=0.0131).", 
    "153": "Most of the very symptomatic patients with NCS present recurrence after the suppression of a specific therapy. A TT carried out after treatment discontinuation can identify patients with higher risk of recurrence, specially in the first year of follow-up.", 
    "154": "Bisoprolol, carvedilol and nebivolol have been shown to be effective in the treatment of heart failure. However, the beta-blocking effects of these drugs have never been compared directly.", 
    "155": "Therefore, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in 16 healthy males. Subjects received 10 mg bisoprolol, 50 mg carvedilol, 10 mg nebivolol and placebo on the first morning followed by 5 mg bisoprolol once daily, 25 mg carvedilol twice daily, 5 mg nebivolol once daily and placebo for 1 week. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured at rest and exercise 3 and 24 h following intake of the first dose, and immediately before and 3 hours following intake of the last dose of each drug. In addition, effects of the drugs on nocturnal melatonin release were determined, and quality of life (QOL) was evaluated.", 
    "156": "Heart rate at exercise was decreased at 3 h following intake of the first single dose of each drug by bisoprolol (-24%), carvedilol (-17%) and nebivolol (-15%), and at 24 h following intake of the respective last dose of each drug following 1 week of chronic administration by bisoprolol (-14%), carvedilol (12 h; -15%) and nebivolol (-13%) (p < 0.05 in all cases). Thus, trough-to-peak-ratios at long-term were as follows: Bisoprolol, 58%; carvedilol (12 h), 85%; nebivolol, 91%. Nocturnal melatonin release was decreased by bisoprolol (-44%, p < 0.05) whereas nebivolol and carvedilol had no effect. QOL with carvedilol was slightly but significantly lower than with the other drugs, whereas bisoprolol and nebivolol did not alter QOL.", 
    "157": "These data show that peak beta-blocking effects of bisoprolol appear stronger than those of nebivolol and carvedilol. On the other hand, nebivolol exerts the highest trough-to-peak-ratio. However, beta-blocking effects of all the three drugs are similar at trough. Only bisoprolol but neither nebivolol nor carvedilol decreased nocturnal melatonin release, a feature which might cause sleep disturbances. Finally, only carvedilol slightly decreased QOL, whereas nebivolol and bisoprolol did not affect QOL. We conclude that different beta-blockers may exert clinically relevant different effects.", 
    "158": "A 70-year-old man with alcoholic cardiomyopathy underwent 99mtechnetium-sestamibi (MIBI), iodine-123-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy and Iodine-123-labeled beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) scintigraphy. 99mtechnetium-MIBI identified myocardial damage in the inferior wall of left ventricle. (123)I BMIPP showed low uptake in the inferior wall of the myocardium, concordant to perfusion. (123)I BMIPP and (123)I MIBG showed reduced uptake in the inferior segment of the myocardium, indicating impairment of fatty acid metabolism and sympathetic abnormalities. Damaged myocardium was demonstrated in alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Beta blocker (carvedilol) and angiotensin-receptor blocker (valsartan) were started at low doses, then increased gradually, leading to the improvement of cardiac performance. Cardiac sympathetic nerve function, impaired due to alcoholic cardiomyopathy, was improved with beta-blocker therapy. Cardiac scintigraphy may be useful to assess the extent of myocardial improvement and the response to therapy.", 
    "159": "Genotype/phenotype analysis with human hepatocytes has identified a new inactive CYP2D6 allele, CYP2D6*56. Cryopreserved human hepatocytes from 51 livers were evaluated for CYP2D6 activity with dextromethorphan as the probe substrate. Hepatocyte lots that lacked CYP2D6 activity were further evaluated for CYP2D6 expression and known genetic variations, including CYP2D6*2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *9, *10, *11, *14, *15, *17, *18, *19, *20, *25, *26, *29, *30, *35, *40, *41, *43, and various multiple copy CYP2D6 alleles (*1xn, *2xn, and *4xn) by the AmpliChip CYP450 prototype microarray (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ). Two discrepancies were uncovered between the CYP2D6 genotype and activity by this approach. In one sample, a previously unreported 3201C 224 T transition in exon 7 resulted in Arg344(CGA) being replaced by a stop codon (TGA), resulting in a CYP2D6 enzyme lacking the terminal 153 amino acids. This allele was given the designation of CYP2D6*56 and the GenBank accession number DQ282162. The lack of CYP2D6 activity in cryopreserved hepatocytes and microsomes found in the second sample, despite a normal level of CYP2D6 expression and a genotype (*10/*1) predictive of normal CYP2D6 activity, was attributed to enzyme inactivation by an unknown metabolite. The identification and characterization of the CYP2D6*56 allele indicates that commercial cryopreserved human hepatocytes may provide a valuable means to rapidly identify genetic variations with functional relevance. This integrated approach of identifying alleles and examining allele relationships to gene expression and function could be of tremendous value to understanding the mechanism responsible for functional differences in gene variation. The commercial availability of human cryopreserved hepatocytes also makes this potential readily available to any who are interested in it, not just those with access to private liver banks.", 
    "160": "Major vascular surgery is associated with a long in-hospital length of stay (LOS). Cardiac risk factors identify patients with an increased risk. Recent studies have associated statin, aspirin, and beta-blocker therapies with improved postoperative outcome. However, the effect of all these factors on LOS has not been defined. Our aims were to determine the effect of cardiac risk factors and (preventive) statin, aspirin, and beta-blocker therapy on LOS and to deduce from these factors a model that predicts LOS. In total, 2,374 patients from 1990 to 2004 were enrolled. Mean LOS was 18 +/- 9 days. Cardiac risk factors that were significantly associated with LOS in the multivariable analysis were age, previous heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Statin and aspirin use was associated with a shorter LOS. Beta blockers shortened LOS only in patients with underlying coronary artery disease. Together, these factors explained 14.1% of the variance in LOS. In conclusion, in-hospital LOS in patients who undergo major vascular surgery can be predicted more accurately by clinical cardiac risk factors. A significant decrease in in-hospital LOS was achieved with statin, aspirin, and beta-blocker therapies.", 
    "161": "In urethane-anesthetized, artificially-ventilated rats, alterations in dorsal spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) were measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter in response to innocuous mechanical cutaneous stimulation. SCBF recorded at the T12-L1 level increased with brushing of the ipsilateral, but not contralateral, upper back, lower back or proximal hindlimb. Brushing of the forepaw, proximal forelimb or hindpaw had no effect on T12-L1 SCBF. SCBF recorded at the L4-6 level increased with brushing of the ipsilateral, but not contralateral, proximal hindlimb and hindpaw. Brushing of the forepaw, proximal forelimb, upper back or lower back had no effect on SCBF at the L4-6 level. None of these brushing stimuli produced significant changes in systemic arterial blood pressure or heart rate. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine, an alpha adrenoceptor blocking agent, resulted in a small but statistically significant attenuation in the response of SCBF to brushing. However, pretreatment with propranolol, a beta adrenoceptor blocking agent, or atropine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor blocking agent, produced no such effect. These results indicate that innocuous mechanical cutaneous input can produce a segmentally-organized increase in regional SCBF, which may be mediated in part, by alpha adrenergic receptors.", 
    "162": "Apomorphine (Apo), a dopaminergic agonist used for treatment of Parkinson disease, is a potent antioxidant. In addition to its antioxidative effects, the dopaminergic and adrenergic effects of Apo were studied. Isolated perfused rat hearts were exposed to 25 min of no-flow global ischemia (37 degrees C) and 60 min of reperfusion (I/R, control). Drugs were introduced for the first 20 min of reperfusion. The LVDP of the control group recovered to 54.6 +/- 3.3%. Apo-treated hearts had significantly improved recovery (61.6 +/- 5%, p < 0.05). The recovery of the work index LVDP x HR was even bigger: 67.8 +/- 3.7% (Apo treatment) vs 41.7 +/- 4.6% (control, p < 0.001). Haloperidol, a dopaminergic antagonist, did not affect the recovery with Apo. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, initially inhibited the effect of Apo. However, the recovery of the combined group (Apo + propranolol) increased and reached significance (LVDP, p < 0.05 vs control group) after cessation of propranolol perfusion. At 60 min of reperfusion this group was superior to Apo-treated hearts (LVDP, p < 0.05). Propranolol (without Apo) did not improve the hemodynamic recovery. The same pattern of recovery applies also to the recovery of the +dP/dt during the reperfusion. L-DOPA was less effective than Apo. I/R caused significant increase in carbonylation of proteins. Apomorphine inhibited the increase in carbonylation. Haloperidol did not affect this beneficial effect of Apo. L-DOPA significantly decreased the carbonylation of proteins. We conclude that the antioxidative effect of Apo is its main mechanism of cardioprotection.", 
    "163": "Many questions regarding blood pressure management after acute stroke remain unanswered, resulting in an ongoing debate about whether to treat hypertension acutely and how aggressively blood pressure should be lowered. This review discusses normal and altered cerebrophysiology and provides evidence supporting and opposing the active management of blood pressure within the first 24 hours after stroke. Commonly used intravenous antihypertensive agents and their cerebrovascular effects are reviewed, and therapeutic recommendations are given based on the available evidence."
