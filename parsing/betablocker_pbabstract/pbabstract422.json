Relaxin i.v. bolus (5 micrograms kg-1) did not change cAMP concentrations but inhibited uterine contractions with rapid onset. Uterine contractions were significantly reduced by 30-70% for 60 min. Relaxin (50 micrograms kg-1) produced a short-lived (up to 5 min) and small (up to 3.2-fold) increase in cAMP concentrations plus a marked (90%) and prolonged inhibition of uterine contractions (70-90% over 60 min). Salbutamol (an agonist at beta 2-adrenoceptors, 100 and 500 micrograms kg-1) produced a similar degree and time course of inhibition of uterine contractions to that of relaxin but a more marked (19-fold) increase in cAMP concentrations. Glibenclamide, a blocker of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, which has been shown to antagonize relaxin as a uterine relaxant, did not prevent the relaxin-induced rise in cAMP concentrations. It is suggested that the uterine relaxant action of relaxin may not result from an increase in uterine cAMP concentrations.", 
    "1": "Taking into account the possible regulatory influences of the beta-adrenergic system on lymphocyte proliferation as well as the proposed role of cyclic 3'-5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the modulation of multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumour cells, we have tried to assess the status of the interactions between the beta-adrenergic system and a mouse lymphocytic leukemia, the P388, both as a doxorubicin-sensitive (P388) and -resistant (MDR) variant (P388/DXR). P388 showed a low total number of high affinity 125I-pindolol binding sites (340 +/- 33/cell, Kd 108 pM) when compared with normal splenocytes (1221 +/- 67 sites/cell, Kd 97 pM). The number of beta-adrenergic receptors was even lower in P388/DXR cells (230 +/- 41 sites/cell, Kd 101 pM). In addition, these receptors were subnormally expressed on the cell surface: only 26% and 52% of the total receptors were surface receptors in P388 and P388/DXR, respectively, whereas it was 87% in normal splenocytes. Isoproterenol slightly (less than 1-fold) stimulated cAMP accumulation in P388 and P388/DXR; the stimulation observed in splenocytes was 2.5-fold. In addition, the basal levels of cAMP appeared to be low (0.48 +/- 0.05 pmoles/10(6) cells in P388 and 0.71 +/- 0.08 pmoles/10(6) cells in P388/DXR; 3.47 +/- 0.28 pmoles/10(6) cells in splenocytes) in the two leukemias and they were only slightly (less than 2-fold) increased by forskolin, which otherwise stimulated about 15-fold cAMP accumulation in splenocytes; thus, P388 and P388/DXR were probably also defective in their adenylate cyclase activity. It can be concluded that, owing to multifactorial mechanisms, the lymphocytic leukemia P388, also as an MDR variant, is minimally sensitive to the direct influences of the beta-adrenergic system, probably including any effect of this system on drug-sensitivity.", 
    "2": "20R 14 beta-amino 3 beta-rhamnosyl 5 beta-pregnan 20 beta-ol (LND 623, CAS 90520-42-6) was investigated and compared to digoxin in anesthetized dogs. The hemodynamic profiles showed: a) a pure positive inotropic action of LND-623; b) its potency was four-fold higher than that of digoxin and more marked in heart failure; c) its duration of action was maintained for at least 6 h. The onset and reversal of the inotropic effects of a single dose (3.3 nmol.kg-1.min-1) were faster with LND-623 than those of digoxin. This reversal is consistent with the faster dissociation profile observed at the level of the high affinity cardiac Na+,K(+)-ATPase receptor form. The advantage of LND-623 over digoxin resides in its larger therapeutic index (ratio of arrhythmogenic to inotropic responses) in anesthetized dogs with propranolol-induced heart failure. This index was 6 for LND-623 and 2 for digoxin.", 
    "3": "Membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase activity was stimulated in vitro separately by T4 (10(-10) M) and by epinephrine (10(-6) M). In the presence of a fixed concentration of T4, additions of 10(-8) and 10(-6) M epinephrine reduced the T4 effect on the enzyme. beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol (10(-6) M) prevented stimulation by epinephrine of Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, but did not prevent the suppressive action of epinephrine on T4-stimulable Ca(2+)-ATPase. In contrast, alpha 1-adrenergic blockade with unlabelled prazosin restored the effect of T4 on Ca(2+)-ATPase activity in the presence of epinephrine. Like propranolol, prazosin prevented enhancement of enzyme activity by epinephrine in the absence of thyroid hormone. Neither prazosin nor propranolol had any effect on the stimulation by T4 of red cell Ca(2+)-ATPase in the absence of epinephrine. Analysis of radiolabelled prazosin binding to human red cell membranes revealed the presence of a single class of high-affinity binding sites (Kd, 1.2 x 10(-8) M; Bmax, 847 fmol/mg membrane protein). Thus, the human erythrocyte membrane contains alpha 1-adrenergic receptor sites that are capable of regulating Ca(2+)-ATPase activity.",

Of these, 65% were newly treated hypertensives and 35% were previously uncontrolled on a diuretic alone. A seated diastolic blood pressure of 95-115 mmHg was required after a 3-week placebo run-in period. Any previous diuretic therapy was changed to hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once a day) and the dose was kept constant throughout the trial. Newly diagnosed patients did not take a diuretic at any time. Quality of life was assessed from self-completed questionnaires measuring psychological well-being, symptomatic side effects of treatment, and activity and perceived well-being (a health index). A relative's perception of the patients' mood was also obtained where possible.",

    "8": "It has been postulated that neurohumoral factors, such as sympathetic nervous system or renin-angiotensin system, may play an important role in the development of myocardial lesion in cardiomyopathic hamsters. This study was undertaken to determine whether the electromechanical responsiveness of the ventricular myocardium to alpha 1-adrenoceptor and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor stimulation is altered in cardiomyopathic (CM) Syrian hamsters. Changes of action potential and isometric tension in response to these receptors stimulation were examined in left ventricular papillary muscles of 14-20 week-old normal (F1 beta), hypertrophic (BIO 14.6) and dilated (BIO 53.58) cardiomyopathic hamsters using conventional microelectrode techniques. Action potential duration (APD) recorded from the papillary muscles (PMs) of BIO 14.6 was significantly shorter than that recorded from BIO 53.58 and F1 beta PMs. Developed tension, which was corrected for the cross-sectional area of PMs, was significantly reduced in PMs of both cardiomyopathic hamsters than those of normal hamsters. Phenylephrine (0.3-30 microM) in the presence of propranolol (1 microM) produced concentration-dependent increases in APD and DT in PMs of normal and cardiomyopathic hamsters. Increases in APD and DT in response to 30 microM phenylephrine (PHE) in BIO 14.6 PMs were significantly greater than those in PMs of F1 beta. However, the increases in APD and DT produced by alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in BIO 53.58 PMs were comparable to those observed in F1 beta PMs. In order to define ionic mechanism(s) responsible for the greater increase in APD during alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in PMs of BIO 14.6, effects of PHE on membrane currents were examined in ventricular cells of F1 beta and BIO 14.6 using patch clamp techniques. PHE-induced decrease in the transient outward current (I(to)) in BIO 14.6 cells was similar to that in F1 beta cells. However, PHE produced a significantly greater decrease in the inward rectifier potassium current (IK1) in BIO 14.6 myocytes than in F1 beta ones. The greater inhibition of IK1 may, at least in part, explain the greater prolongation of APD in BIO 14.6 PMs. Angiotensin II (Ang II, 0.01-1 microM) also produced concentration-dependent increases in APD and DT in PMs of normal and cardiomyopathic hamsters. In contrast to electromechanical responses to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation, Ang II produced a significantly smaller increase in DT in BIO 14.6 PMs than F1 beta ones, concomitantly with a smaller increase in APD. The Ang II-induced increase in DT in BIO 53.58 PMs was also smaller than that in F1 beta PMs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Effects of chronic heart failure upon receptor binding and cardiac function were studied in mongrel dogs. Heart failure was induced by three to seven, graded, sequential, intracoronary microembolizations performed 1 to 3 weeks apart. Depressed systolic and diastolic left ventricular function, reduced cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, increased plasma norepinephrine concentration, left ventricular hypertrophy, and dilation were associated with the development of heart failure in this model. Three months after the last embolization, the density and affinity of myocardial beta adrenoceptors and voltage sensitive calcium channels were quantified by analyzing saturation isotherms of specific radioligand binding. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol and [3H]nitrendipine bound specifically and with high affinity to cardiac beta adrenoceptors and calcium channels, respectively. Scatchard transformation of the specific binding of these radioligands in membranes prepared following intracoronary embolization demonstrated a 47% decrease in the density of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites (605 +/- 20 fmol/mg, normal, vs. 323 +/- 18 fmol/mg, failed; P < 0.05) and a 20% decrease in [3H]nitredipine binding sites (371 +/- 11 fmol/mg, normal, vs. 298 +/- 17 fmol/mg, failed; P < 0.05). The binding equilibrium dissociation constants for [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]nitrendipine were not significantly different between normal and failed myocardium. There was no difference in the sialic acid content in the sarcolemmal membranes prepared from normal and failed dog hearts (31.07 +/- 0.76 nmol/mg, normal, vs. 30.58 +/- 5.25 nmol/mg, failed). This is inconsistent with the selective purification of membranes utilized in these radioligand binding studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "The effects of VIP on CCK-induced contractions of the gallbladder were studied in the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, in vivo. Gallbladder pressures were measured via a catheter inserted into the gallbladder, and drugs were injected through a catheter in the dorsal aorta. CCK-induced contractions of the gallbladder wall were reduced in a dose-dependent manner by VIP. The effect of VIP was inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist sotalol, indicating an adrenergic link in the VIP inhibition of the CCK-induced contraction. It is suggested that activation of VIP nerves could facilitate postprandial filling/refilling of the gallbladder despite the increased plasma levels of CCK during this period.", 
    "11": "We investigated the expression and functional characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors in a panel of 10 phenotypically different human hematopoietic cell lines. A binding assay with [125I]iodocyanopindolol as the ligand revealed that cell lines of myelomonocytic or histiocytic derivation (HL-60, ML-2, RC-2A, U-937) expressed high numbers of beta-adrenoceptors. An intermediate density of receptors was found in a non-T, non-B cell leukemia line (Nall-1), whereas T-cell (JM, CCRF-CEM), B-cell (Raji) or erythroleukemic cell lines (K-562, HEL) displayed minimal or undetectable binding of the radioligand. Isoprenaline-stimulated cAMP production by the cells correlated to their extent of beta-adrenoceptor expression. Southern blot hybridization analysis of genomic DNA from the cell lines with a 32P-labelled beta 2-adrenoceptor cDNA probe revealed no evidence for major rearrangement or amplification of the receptor gene. Incubation with isoprenaline in vitro suppressed the proliferation of the receptor-rich RC-2A cells but did not affect the growth rate of the receptor-deficient K-562 cells. Treatment with propranolol slightly enhanced the proliferation of the RC-2A cells but did not markedly alter the growth rate of two other cell lines, regardless of their beta-adrenoceptor status. These findings indicate a regulatory influence by the sympathoadrenergic system on selected cells of the myelomonocytic lineage.", 
    "12": "1. Isoprenaline (3 x 10(-8)-10(-5) M), salbutamol (3 x 10(-7)-10(-4) M) and forskolin (3 x 10(-9)-3 x 10(-7) M) relaxed rat isolated thoracic aortic rings contracted with noradrenaline (10(-7) M). Removal of the endothelium from the aortic rings abolished the effect of acetylcholine (10(-6) M) and completely prevented the vascular relaxation induced by isoprenaline, salbutamol or forskolin. 2. The isoprenaline concentration-relaxation curve was shifted in parallel to the right about 10 fold by propranolol (3 x 10(-7) M) with no change in the maximum response, showing that the relaxation was mediated by a beta-adrenoceptor. 3. The inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG; 10(-5) M), shifted the isoprenaline relaxation curve to the right and reduced the maximum response. 4. Isoprenaline (10(-6) M) relaxed noradrenaline-induced tone by approximately 95% and at the same time increased levels of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) 4 fold and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) 12 fold in the aortic rings. Sodium nitroprusside (3 x 10(-8) M) relaxed noradrenaline-evoked tone by 82% without changing levels of cyclic AMP but raised cyclic GMP 19 fold. 5. Forskolin (10(-7) M) relaxed noradrenaline-induced tone by approximately 41% and, like isoprenaline, increased levels of cyclic AMP (2.5 fold) and cyclic GMP (12 fold) in the aortic rings. 6. Removal of the endothelium abolished the relaxant effects of isoprenaline (10(-6) M) and also the associated accumulation of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP.7. L-NOARG (10- M) inhibited the relaxant responses and accumulation of cyclic GMP induced by isoprenaline (10-6 M) and forskolin (10- M) without affecting the associated cyclic AMP accumulation.8. It is concluded that, in the rat aorta, isoprenaline acts through a P-adrenoceptor on the endothelium to raise cyclic AMP and that this may, directly or indirectly, release nitric oxide to evoke vascular relaxation via the increase in cyclic GMP. The importance of this novel transduction pathway for cardiovascular regulation remains to be determined.", 
    "13": "Prostaglandin (PG) E2 synthesis elicited by adrenergic agonists in the guinea pig trachea has been shown to be mediated via activation of beta-adrenergic receptors. The purpose of this study was to examine arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism and to characterize the subtype of beta receptor involved in PG synthesis. [14C]AA was incubated with guinea pig tracheal rings, and the radiolabelled products were extracted from the medium. Thin layer chromatographic analysis and radioimmunoassay of the extract showed that [14C]AA was incorporated into guinea pig tracheal rings and metabolized mainly into radiolabeled and immunoreactive PGE2 (iPGE2) and smaller amounts into PGF2 alpha. Trace amounts of PGD2, TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha but not LTB4 or LTC4 were detected by enzyme immunoassay. Incubation of guinea pig tracheal rings for 10 min with isoproterenol or salbutamol resulted in a significant increase in PGE2 synthesis (optimum concentration 0.1 microM for both compounds). In contrast, dobutamine, BRL 37344, BRL 28410, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and xylazine (up to 1 microM) did not significantly increase PGE2 production. Isoproterenol-induced iPGE2 production was inhibited by the selective beta 2 receptor antagonist butoxamine (0.1-1.0 microM) and somewhat reduced by the beta 1 receptor antagonist practolol (1 microM). The increase in PGE2 synthesis was diminished with increasing concentrations of isoproterenol (0.5-5.0 microM) or salbutamol (0.5-1.0 microM); but it was reversed by pretreatment of tracheal rings with the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide (0.9 microM) and actinomycin D (2 microM) but not by phenylisopropyl adenosine (0.1-1.0 microM), an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase. These data suggest that isoproterenol-induced iPGE2 synthesis is primarily via activation of a beta 2 adrenergic receptor. Failure to enhance iPGE2 synthesis by a high concentration of isoproterenol is likely to be due to an induction of new inhibitory protein synthesis.", 
    "14": "The products of the cellular immediate-early genes (IEGs) are thought to act as messengers in the coupling of trans-synaptic stimuli with altered neuronal gene expression. However, the manner in which neurotransmission specifies particular responses through the IEGs is undefined. In this report, mRNA and transcription analysis of a precisely-timed, physiological IEG response illustrates how an IEG signal may be organized through differential neurotransmitter receptor activation. The nocturnal pattern of IEG expression in the rat pineal gland has been shown to be differentially regulated through post-synaptic adrenergic receptors. Induction of the c-fos gene is primarily mediated through alpha 1-receptors, whereas the coordinately regulated jun-B gene exhibits dual regulation through alpha 1- and beta-receptors. A simultaneous repression of c-jun expression is partly mediated through a beta-receptor mechanism. In vitro analysis of IEGs in cultured pineal glands has confirmed the receptor-specific link between adrenergic neurotransmission and IEG induction. The pineal is a unique neuroendocrine model in which the characteristics and function of the IEG third messenger system may be defined.", 
    "15": "An increase in basal heart rate caused by a lack of vagal control and chronotropic supersensitivity to epinephrine has been shown in transplanted human hearts. Prejunctional and/or postjunctional origins for this supersensitivity have been suggested, the latter involving changes in the number of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors or in the receptor adenylate cyclase system. To directly determine the time course of change, serial determinations were performed during the first 3 months after heart transplantation. The beta-adrenergic receptor density measured by iodine 125-labelled iodocyanopindolol binding in 61 endomyocardial biopsy specimens (a mean of 6.1 +/- 0.58 biopsies from each of 10 patients) showed great intraindividual and interindividual variability (56.6 +/- 6.8 fmol/mg protein) with no mean trend toward gradually changing receptor densities. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity measured in 33 biopsy specimens (a mean of 5.5 +/- 0.67 biopsy specimens from each of six patients) varied considerably (112.5 +/- 13.8 pmol cyclic adenosine monophosphate/mg protein/min), again with no definite tendency with regard to the development over time. The beta-adrenergic receptor densities showed no statistical correlation with the degree of rejection as assessed by histologic criteria and antimyosin ration. These results suggest that in the first 3 months after heart transplantation beta-adrenergic receptor density and adenylate cyclase responses to 10 mumol/L isoproterenol do not change and that beta-adrenergic receptor density in the transplanted myocardium does not seem to be affected by the degree of rejection.", 
    "16": "Lymphocytes contain a homogeneous population of beta 2-adrenoceptors. However, their physiological role in the regulation of lymphocyte function, especially early in the activation/proliferation process, remains unclear. To study the role of beta-adrenergic activation on the regulation of membrane transport, we examined 86Rb uptake in the Jurkat human lymphoma cell line. 86Rb uptake was predominantly accounted for by bumetanide-sensitive uptake (74 +/- 2% total 86Rb uptake) and ouabain-sensitive uptake (20 +/- 2%). Bumetanide potently inhibited 86Rb uptake (50% inhibitory concentration = 210 +/- 40 nM), and bumetanide-sensitive uptake was dependent on extracellular sodium and chloride, consistent with uptake via Na-K-Cl cotransport. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 microM) mediated a 50 +/- 11% reduction in bumetanide-sensitive uptake without a significant alteration in ouabain-sensitive uptake. The effect of isoproterenol was potent (50% effective concentration = 4.42 +/- 1.70 nM), stereoselective, and was inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist nadolol. The effect of isoproterenol was mimicked by permeant adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate analogues but not by pindolol. These data indicate that beta-adrenoceptor activation decreases 86Rb uptake in lymphocytes via inhibition of Na-K-Cl cotransport. Modulation of this transporter could be one mechanism by which beta-adrenergic agonists regulate lymphocyte function.", 
    "17": "Chronic stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors leads to increased mRNA and protein levels of pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) in the heart. In the present study the time course is reported of the effect of isoprenaline infusions on myocardial mRNA levels of Gi alpha-2, Gi alpha-3, G(o) alpha, Gs alpha, and G beta and myocardial levels of PTX-sensitive G proteins. Rats were treated by subcutaneous infusions, with osmotic minipumps, of 0.9% NaCl, isoprenaline (2.4 mg/kg/day), propranolol (9.9 mg/kg/day), or a combination thereof for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 days, and two groups were treated with NaCl or isoprenaline for 13 or 26 days. Additional groups of rats were treated with 0.24 or 0.07 mg/kg/day for 4 days to determine the dose dependency of the effects of isoprenaline. mRNA concentrations were determined by standardized slot blotting with 32P-labeled cDNA or cRNA probes. In isoprenaline-treated rats, mRNA levels of all members of the Gi alpha/G(o) alpha family increased gradually in parallel. The increase in Gi alpha-2, Gi alpha-3, and G(o) alpha mRNA levels reached significance on days 2-3, reached maximal values on days 3-4, and remained stable over the total time of treatment of up to 26 days. Compared with NaCl, maximal increases were 77% (Gi alpha-2; 16.4 versus 9.3 pg/micrograms), 58% (Gi alpha-3; 4.65 versus 2.95 pg/micrograms), and 78% (G(o) alpha; 0.40 versus 0.22 pg/microgram). Gs alpha mRNA levels (about 30 pg/micrograms) and G beta mRNA levels remained unchanged. In isoprenaline-treated rats myocardial levels of PTX-sensitive G proteins increased by maximally 54%, compared with control. The time course differed slightly from the time course of mRNA up-regulation in the first 3 days of treatment and paralleled the increase in mRNA levels from day 4 on. Propranolol had no effect on G alpha mRNA or protein levels when given alone but abolished all effects of isoprenaline when given in combination. Isoprenaline at a dose of 0.24 mg/kg/day still induced an increase in Gi alpha-2 mRNA levels of 24%, without any effects on histopathology of the myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "18": "Intracellular current- and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from basolateral (BLA) and central (ACe) neurones of the rat amygdala in vitro. The effect of superfusion of rat corticotropin releasing factor (rCRF) was examined on the ACe and BLA, nuclei with a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cell bodies and CRF receptors, respectively. rCRF (12.5-250 nM) had no effect on either resting membrane potential or input resistance in BLA neurones. In contrast, at low nanomolar concentrations rCRF (10-50 nM) caused hyperpolarisation and decreased membrane input resistance in the majority of ACe neurones. The equilibrium potential for this effect was -84 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM), suggesting that this response may be mediated by a postsynaptic increase in K+ conductance. Furthermore, rCRF consistently reduced the amplitude of, and the current mediating, the slow after hyperpolarisation following evoked action potential firing in both nuclei. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 40 nM in BLA neurones and was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and noradrenergic antagonists. In addition, the putative CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 (5 microM) blocked the effect of rCRF and showed partial agonist action on slow after hyperpolarisations. In BLA neurones, rCRF (50 nM) prolonged the Ca(2+)-spike evoked in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium (2 mM), suggesting that the blockade of the slow after hyperpolarisation occurs subsequent to Ca2+ entry. These results suggest that rCRF has a differential effect on the membrane properties of BLA and ACe neurones possibly by activation of a heterogeneous population of CRF receptors.", 
    "19": "The relative contribution of the direct and indirect pathways to liver glycogen formation was assessed in humans by using a combined tracer-hepatic vein catheterization technique. An oral glucose load (75 g) labelled with 1-14C-glucose was administered to five subjects (control group) and 4.5 h later hepatic glycogen was flushed with glucagon and analysed to determine the randomization of 14C. The specific activity (SA) of the glycogen derived glucose (1-14C-glucose SA+recycled 14C-glucose SA) was 61 +/- 7% of the mean blood glucose SA of the interval 0-180 min after the oral glucose load. The relative values due to 1-14C-glucose and recycled 14C-glucose were 33 +/- 7 and 28 +/- 3%, respectively. The data indicate that the indirect pathway of glycogen formation is not only active in humans but contributes substantially (at least 50%) to liver glycogen formation. In order to investigate whether the basal adrenergic tone plays a role in the maintenance of the indirect pathway, the same protocol was also performed in a second group of subjects (n = 5) who received propranolol before the oral glucose load (propranolol group). The SA of the glycogen-derived glucose was considerably smaller than that of the control group (18 +/- 5 vs. 61 +/- 7%, P < 0.001), suggesting lesser glycogen formation. However, the ratio of 1-14C to recycled-14C in the glucose molecule was similar in the control (1.3 +/- 0.4) and propranolol group (1.9 +/- 1.2). We conclude that the basal adrenergic tone does not play any role in the operation of the indirect pathway of liver glycogen synthesis.",

In addition, DT, +dT/dt, and -dT/dt of untreated MI rats demonstrated an impaired response to isoproterenol stimulation compared with controls. beta-Adrenergic receptor density (Bmax) measured by [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding was decreased 23% after infarction (9.3 +/- 0.6 versus 12.0 +/- 1.8 fmol/mg protein [prot]) (p < 0.05); however, the dissociation constant (Kd) for ICYP was not changed (24.1 +/- 5.7 versus 33.2 +/- 12.1 pM).

    "23": "The effects of a crude extract of the stem bark of Cassia abbreviata on mean arterial pressure in anaesthetized rats were investigated. Bolus injections of the stem bark elicited a transitory fall in blood pressure which was dose-dependent. The depressor response was not blocked by atropine nor propranolol thus indicating that muscarinic and beta 2 receptors are not involved. However it was partially blocked by diphenhydramine, and H1 antagonist. The latter also partially blocked the depressor response to histamine which is mediated partially through both H1 and H2 receptors.

Those compounds were studied pharmacologically in order to determine their toxicity, antiarrhythmic activity in selected experimental models of arrhythmia, the local anesthetic effect and influence on the cardiovascular system. The tested compounds showed a less potent or similar toxicity towards reference drugs, were devoid of an antiarrhythmic activity in the model of barium arrhythmia, yet some of them (compounds 9 and 12) increased the arrhythmogenic dose of strophanthin. All the compounds studied had a local anesthetic effect stronger than lidocaine in infiltration anesthesia, and compound 8--also in surface anesthesia.", 
    "25": "Propranolol (P) is known to be actively captured by the lungs of experimental animal and man. To elucidate the mechanism of the phenomenon, the authors studied the P enantiomeric ratio in the serum from the left ventricle 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 s after bolus injection of P (0.5 mg) into the pulmonary artery of 8 patients catheterized for coronary angiography. The total P concentrations and enantiomeric ratio were measured by non-stereoselective and stereoselective high performance liquid chromatography. The solid-phase extraction method was used for extracting P from the serum. It showed a small, but significant increase is S(-)/R(+) ratio (to 1.18 +/- 0.12, P < 0.05 vs 1) which was, however, almost the same when measuring this after adding P to serum of the same patients (1.11 +/- 0.05, P > 0.05 vs 1.18). Thus, propranolol uptake by the lung during a single passage is not stereoselective and hardly involves some active process.",

The beneficial properties of AC, however, is attributed mainly to the S-(+)-enantiomer. The disposition of AC enantiomers and their active, chiral metabolites, diacetolol (DC) were examined after oral administration to healthy and adjuvant-induced arthritic (AA) female Sprague-Dawley rats. Arthritis was induced by tail base injection of Mycobacterium butyricum. Swelling of hind and forepaws were apparent in 10-16 days in AA but not controls. Control and AA rats were sacrificed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after a 25 mg/kg oral AC dose and blood was collected (n = 6). Significant three to tenfold increases in the initial plasma concentrations (0.5-2 h) of AC were observed in AA. Enantiomers were equally affected, thus AC S:R ratio was not changed. Higher plasma concentrations of the metabolite were only significant at 2 h. The ratio of DC:AC, however, was unaffected by AA. The DC S:R ratio was significantly decreased at 0.5 and 1 h in AA. The limited protein binding of AC (10%) was neither stereoselective nor affected by AA. Reduced intrinsic clearance in AA may be responsible for these observations.",

    "34": "Membrane currents were measured in ventricular myocytes from guinea pig hearts with the whole cell voltage clamp technique. IK was activated during clamp steps from a holding potential of -40 mV to test potentials -30 and +50 mV. The tail current Itail was measured upon stepping back to holding potential.", 
    "35": "In control experiments. IK and Itail declined spontaneously (\"run down\"). With 300 ms long test pulses to +50 mV, only d-sotalol (10(-4) M) caused a significant further decrease in IK, whereas all four agents significantly reduced Itail (almokalant 10(-6) M, E-4031 10(-7) M, quinidine 10(-5) M). When tested with 1 s long clamp steps at various potentials almokalant (3 x 10(-6) M), E-4031 (10(-6) M), quinidine (10(-5) M), and d-sotalol (10(-4) M) reduced IK in the potential range between -20 and +40 mV, yielding a bell shaped inward rectifying drug sensitive current. Itail was reduced by almokalant and E-4031 over the whole voltage range with saturation of block positive to +20 mV. Similar reductions with quinidine but not with d-sotalol were also significant. With rest pulses to +50 mV of increasing duration (25 ms-4000 ms), Itail developed with a faster time course than IK and therefore the ratio of Itail/IK declined with pulse duration. With almokalant and E-4031, this ratio became independent of test pulse duration. For 250 ms pulses, Itail/IK was also significantly reduced by d-sotalol and quinidine.", 
    "36": "Inhibition of the rapidly activating inwardly rectifying component of IK is prominent with almokalant and E-4031 and less pronounced with d-sotalol and quinidine. Since inhibition of this component prolongs the cardiac action potential, it should contribute to the antiarrhythmic properties of the agents.", 
    "37": "The effects of halothane on the effective refractory period (ERP) and the ventricular activation were examined in a canine myocardial infarction model, and compared with those of propranolol. Halothane reduced the heart rate and prolonged the ERP in both normal and infarcted zones. A prolongation of ERP with halothane was also observed during atrial pacing at the same rate as in control, but the effect was less than during sinus rhythm. Halothane (1 MAC) further delayed or blocked the delayed activation in the infarcted zones with only slight effects on the activation of the normal zones. Propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) prolonged ERP during sinus rhythm, but it did not affect either the ERP or ventricular activation during atrial pacing. In conclusion, halothane produced a selective depression of the delayed activation and the prolongation of ERP, which may be caused by both direct effects on the myocardium and secondary effects such as a reduction of the heart rate. These effects of halothane may contribute to its antiarrhythmic effects in the myocardial infarction model which have been previously reported.",

However, escape reaction, elicited from the feeding center under substance P was found unchanged after intravenous administration of 0.25 mg kalipsol. The data obtained suggested an important role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in substance P transformation of the functional properties of the hypothalamic feeding centre.", 
    "39": "Effects of two Ca-antagonists, verapamil and nifedipine, on the total cellular cholesterol content and accumulation, as well as on the synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in human aortic intimal smooth muscle cells and P388D1 cell line have been studied. Verapamil and nifedipine used at 10(-6) M and higher concentrations decreased the total cellular cholesterol content (by 25-40%) in intimal cells isolated from atherosclerotic lesions without any effect on the cholesterol content in normal intimal cells or P388D1 cells. At 2 x 10(-5) M verapamil and nifedipine prevented the accumulation of cholesterol induced by atherogenic blood serum or atherogenic low density lipoproteins in both types of cells. At 10(-5) M and higher concentrations verapamil and nifedipine inhibited (2-3-fold) cholesteryl ester synthesis in intimal cells and, used at 10(-6) M and higher doses, in P388D1 cells as well. Verapamil and nifedipine (2 x 10(-5) M) enhanced the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in both types of cells. The Ca-channel agonist Bay K8644 had no effect on cholesteryl ester synthesis, nor did it suppress its inhibition by Ca-antagonist. The beta-receptor blocker propranolol induced the accumulation of cholesterol in intimal cells and inhibited the synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesterol esters in these cells. The data obtained suggest that the antiatherosclerotic action of Ca-blockers is determined by their ability to reduce the cellular cholesterol content which is suggested to be the result of enhanced hydrolysis of cellular cholesteryl esters.", 
    "40": "1. To explore mechanisms of urinary obstruction in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), the features of contraction and relaxation in human hyperplastic and non-hyperplastic (control) prostatic tissues were investigated for beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors by radioligand binding and in vitro isometric tension experiments. 2. Hyperplastic and control prostatic tissues had a similar number (per mg protein) of prazosin binding sites with similar affinities. Noradrenaline (NA) induced dose-dependent contraction in both tissues. Contraction induced by either exogenous NA or transmural stimulation was inhibited by prazosin in both tissues, indicating that the same contractile mechanisms mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors exist in hyperplastic and control tissues. 3. The number of dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding sites (per mg protein) was less in hyperplastic tissues than in controls, whereas the affinity to the ligand was identical in both tissues. Isoprenaline caused a marked relaxation of the tonic contraction induced by KCl in control tissues, but not in hyperplastic tissues. Propranolol enhanced exogenous NA- or transmural stimulation-induced contraction more in control tissues than in hyperplastic tissues. Both tissues, however, similarly responded to forskolin by relaxation. 4. These results indicate that decreased beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation in hyperplastic prostatic tissues, which is attributable at least in part to the decreased number of beta-adrenoceptors, may play a role in the urinary obstruction of BPH in addition to mechanical compression of the urethra by the enlarged prostate.", 
    "41": "Previous studies of late potentials have not standardized the autonomic milieu at the time of testing. We studied the effects of autonomic manipulation in seven patients with previous Q wave myocardial infarction. Late potentials were evaluated using standard temporal (TD) and spectral temporal mapping techniques (STM) in the drug free state, and during separate intravenous administration of each of the following: isoproterenol, esmolol, and atropine. Isoproterenol was titrated to achieve a heart rate of 130% of baseline. Esmolol was infused at a rate of 250 micrograms/kg per minute, after a loading dose of 500 micrograms/kg. Atropine was given as a 2-mg bolus. In addition, five patients who received no drug infusions acted as controls, undergoing four serial signal-averaging studies in the baseline state: a \"baseline\" study, and then three additional studies at time intervals similar to those incurred by the study patients. Therefore, a total of 21 TD and 21 STM tests were done in the study group (seven patients; three drugs per patient) during the drug infusions, and 15 TD and 15 STM tests were done in the control group (five patients; three \"nonbaseline\" tests per patient). A change (normal to abnormal, or vice versa) in TD during a drug infusion occurred in 24% of the tests. No such change occurred in the control group (P < 0.01). A change in STM during a drug infusion occurred in 38% of tests, versus 13% of tests in the control group (P = 0.14). Overall, six of seven patients had a change in TD and/or STM diagnosis with infusion of one or more of the study drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

U wave accentuation occurred during sinus rhythm without pauses in periods of heightened sympathetic tone. To examine the role of early afterdepolarization (EAD), monophasic action potentials were recorded during ventricular extrasystoles and TdP occurring spontaneously and induced by ventricular pacing. The effects of lidocaine, verapamil, propranolol, and epinephrine were assessed. Our data show that: (1) EAD plays a significant role in the genesis of familial long QTU syndrome and TdP; (2) rapid ventricular pacing causes postpause-dependent EADs, U waves, and TdP; and (3) EAD is enhanced by epinephrine infusion in the absence of pause, whereas EAD-triggered firing is inhibited by verapamil and propranolol but not by lidocaine.", 
    "43": "Sotalol has Class II and III antiarrhythmic effects. Its efficacy and safety as a treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is controversial. We evaluated the effects of isoproterenol and IV sotalol (1.5 mg/kg in 10 minutes) given together versus isoproterenol alone on anterograde conduction through the AV node and accessory pathway. Atrial fibrillation was induced in 22 patients with WPW (13 men, 9 women, 36 +/- 16 years old). AV node and accessory pathway conduction were both enhanced by isoproterenol, although the effect was greater on the AV node. The minimum interval between preexcited QRS complexes shortened in all patients. Conversely, sotalol caused a significant prolongation of the shortest preexcited QRS interval as well as of the shortest interval between narrow QRS complexes. In addition, sotalol reversed all the effects of isoproterenol during atrial fibrillation. The percent of preexcited QRS complexes was not significantly modified because variations in ventricular preexcitation results from a balance between the relative effects on refractoriness of the accessory pathway versus of the AV node and in the amount of respective anterograde and retrograde concealed conduction. There were no serious adverse effects. Reversion to sinus rhythm was documented in 12 patients (60%). These short-term observations suggest that sotalol may be safe and effective in the treatment of patients with WPW and atrial fibrillation.", 
    "44": "In order to allow the use of sotalol to control ventricular tachycardia (VT), dual chamber rate responsive (DDDR) pacemakers were implanted in ten patients aged 6 to 73 years (mean 50 years). Nine presented with monomorphic VT (seven inducible at baseline electrophysiological study [EPS]) and one with syncope (monomorphic VT at EPS). On sotalol, VT was initiated in only one. This patient received sotalol in the absence of an effective alternative agent. The mean dose was 468 +/- 269 mg/day. Indications for pacing were symptomatic sotalol induced bradycardia (7), sinus node dysfunction (1), postoperative complete heart block (1), and infra-His block at baseline EPS (1). At least five of these patients would have been candidates for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator had sotalol required discontinuation. Initially, nine patients were paced in DDDR mode and one, with normal AV conduction on sotalol, in AAIR. One patient was unable to tolerate sotalol despite pacing. One patient died suddenly after 35 months of symptom-free follow-up. There was a significant improvement in symptomatic status (P = 0.03) after pacing among the other eight patients with no recurrence of VT. The implantation of a DDDR pacemaker may be indicated in selected patients with serious cardiac arrhythmias. With such a device programmed to an appropriate mode, sotalol can be used successfully where otherwise contraindicated by bradycardia or preexisting conduction disease. For some patients this may obviate the expense, inconvenience, and attendant risks of implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation.", 
    "45": "Frequency dependent effects of d-Sotalol (2.0 mg/kg IV, n = 6) and amiodarone (400 mg/day for 3 months, n = 9) were studied on the action potential duration (APD) in 14 patients who underwent electrophysiological testing. Monophasic action potentials were recorded from the right ventricle at five different steady-state paced cycle lengths (700 msec, 600 msec, 500 msec, 400 msec, and 350 msec), and during ventricular extrastimuli with coupling intervals between 300 msec and 1000 msec, before and after d-sotalol and amiodarone, respectively. D-sotalol caused a prolongation of the APD at slow steady-state stimulation rates (11 +/- 5% at cycle length of 700 msec), which became attenuated at faster cycle lengths (5 +/- 3% at cycle length of 350 msec). Prolongation of APD after amiodarone was independent of pacing rate, e.g., 12 +/- 9% at cycle length of 700 msec, and 11 +/- 6% at cycle length of 350 msec. Similar frequency dependent prolongation of the APD was observed during abrupt changes of cycle lengths after d-sotalol, whereas amiodarone caused uniform prolongation of the APD at different extrastimulus intervals. Thus, d-sotalol, a nonselective potassium channel blocker, has reverse use-dependent effects on the human ventricular APD, while amiodarone with greater potassium channel selectivity, has equal ability to prolong the ventricular APD at fast and slow heart rates.", 
    "46": "Antiarrhythmic agents alter cardiac conduction, refractoriness, and action potential duration in a rate dependent fashion. A simple in vivo model was developed to measure these variables over a wide range of cycle lengths. Complete heart block was produced in dogs using an 8 French hexapolar ablation catheter, anterior skin electrode, and radiofrequency current (30 W, 13.6 +/- 2.6 seconds). Ventricular pacing and monophasic action potential recordings were performed using a single combination catheter. QRS and action potential durations were measured at multiple cycle lengths and after an abrupt change in paced cycle length. Ventricular effective refractory periods were also measured at multiple cycle lengths. Data obtained during flecainide and d-Sotalol infusions are presented. This simple model allows detailed in vivo evaluation of the electrophysiological effects of antiarrhythmic agents and combinations.", 
    "47": "Contraction-excitation feedback has been studied extensively in mammalian ventricles. In contrast, little is known about contraction-excitation feedback in mammalian atria. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of acute alterations in atrial pressure, induced by varying the atrioventricular (AV) interval, on atrial refractoriness. Twenty patients without structural heart disease participated in the study. In each patient the atrial effective (ERP) and absolute refractory periods (ARP) were measured during AV pacing at a cycle length of 500 msec and an AV interval of 120 msec. Acute increases in atrial pressure were induced by pacing the atrium and ventricle simultaneously for the final two beats of the drive train. The ERP was defined as the longest extrastimulus coupling interval that failed to capture with an extrastimulus current strength of twice the stimulation threshold. The ARP was defined in a similar manner with an extrastimulus current strength of 10 mA. The ERP and ARP were determined using the incremental extrastimulus technique. A subset of patients had the pacing protocol performed during autonomic blockade. As the AV interval of the final two beats of the drive train was shortened from 120 msec to 0 msec, the peak right atrial pressure increased from 7 +/- 3 mmHg to 15 +/- 5 mmHg (P < 0.001). The increase in atrial pressure associated with simultaneous pacing of the atrium and ventricle resulted in shortening of the atrial ERP and ARP by 7.3 +/- 5.2 and 6.2 +/- 3.5 msec, respectively (P < 0.001). Similar results were obtained during autonomic blockade. these findings confirm the presence of contraction-excitation feedback in normal human atria.",

The procedure may be used to determine residues of the tranquilisers acepromazine, azaperone, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, propionylpromazine, xylazine, the metabolite of azaperone, azaperol, and the beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent carazolol. Existing methods of analysis for tranquilisers are based on ultraviolet and fluorescence detection and have been used for pig kidney analysis. Determination in this method was by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in the screen mode. The enhanced selectivity offered by the electrochemical detector allowed determination in liver extracts, which often give rise to more interferences on chromatographic traces when using conventional methods of detection. The method offers up to a ten-fold improvement in limits of determination over methods using ultraviolet and fluorescence detection. Recoveries and coefficients of variation have been determined in the range 2-25 micrograms/kg in pig kidney and liver. This electrochemical detection method has been used to measure residues in routine surveillance programmes.",

    "50": "The effect of isoproterenol (Iso) on synaptic transmission mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (EPSPNMDA) was investigated in slices of rat amygdala using intracellular recording techniques. EPSPNMDA was isolated pharmacologically by application of a solution containing the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10 microM) and GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline (20 microM). Superfusion of Iso (15 microM) produced a long-lasting enhancement of EPSPNMDA. Pretreatment the slices with propranolol (10 microM) completely prevented the effect of Iso confirming the mediation by beta-adrenergic receptors. These results provide the direct evidence for adrenergic modulation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission in the vertebrate central nervous system.", 
    "51": "The palmitoylation of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2-AR) was studied in recombinant baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells. At 48 h post-infection, a high level expression of an epitope-tagged beta 2-AR (10-25 pmol/mg protein) was detected by [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) binding assays. The identity of the receptor was confirmed both by photoaffinity labeling and immunoblotting. The fusion receptor displayed typical beta 2-AR pharmacological properties and conferred a beta-adrenergic sensitive adenylyl cyclase activity to the Sf9 cells. Moreover, exposure of the Sf9 cells to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced a rapid desensitization of the receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Purification of the epitope-tagged beta 2-AR by immunoprecipitation as well as by alprenolol-Sepharose affinity chromatography revealed that the receptor is covalently modified with palmitic acid in the insect cells as is observed in mammalian cells. In addition, short-term incubation of the cells with isoproterenol led to a specific increase in the incorporation of [3H]palmitate in the receptor, consistent with a rapid agonist-modulated turnover of the beta 2-AR-attached palmitic acid. These results suggest that agonist-mediated regulation of beta 2-AR post-translational palmitoylation could represent an other regulatory process for G protein-coupled receptors.", 
    "52": "A simple and sensitive gas chromatographic method has been developed for the determination of timolol in plasma using electron-capture detection and propranolol as internal standard. Timolol was extracted using butyl chloride and derivatized using trifluoroacetic anhydride in butyl acetate. The lower detection limit for the assay was found to be 1 ng/ml from 1 ml of plasma. Extracted standards gave within-day precision of 12.55, 9.68 and 3.78% for 1, 20 and 100 ng/ml plasma samples, respectively. A recovery of at least 80% of timolol was found using the extraction method described. The assay was used in a randomized cross-over bioequivalence trial using an oral administration of 20 mg of timolol. Pharmacokinetic parameters compare favourably with other literature values.", 
    "53": "Adrenoceptor antagonists block the enhancement of memory storage produced by epinephrine injection, but not that produced by glucose injection. The present experiment determined whether adrenoceptor antagonists modify resting blood glucose levels or the magnitude of epinephrine-, glucose-, and footshock-induced increases in circulating glucose levels in a manner related to these previously observed effects on memory. The alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol, respectively, were injected in rats 30 min prior to administration of epinephrine, glucose, or footshock. Plasma glucose levels were sampled during the next 30 min. Epinephrine-induced increases in plasma glucose levels were potentiated by phenoxybenzamine and were attenuated and delayed by propranolol. The adrenoceptor antagonists did not alter resting plasma glucose levels, or the increases in plasma glucose levels resulting from glucose injection or footshock. These findings suggest that phenoxybenzamine and propranolol alter blood glucose responses to epinephrine injection in a manner which may contribute to attenuation of epinephrine-induced enhancement of memory storage with peripheral injections of adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "54": "The release of catecholamines, dopamine and noradrenaline has been suggested to play a role in mediating ischemic damage in susceptible brain regions, the hippocampus and striatum. We now provide evidence that suggests a role for adrenoceptors in the deficit of 2-deoxyglucose uptake and CA1 field potential induced in hippocampal slices by hypoxia/hypoglycemia (ischemia). Treatment with alpha 1- or beta-adrenoceptor agonists or cAMP potentiated an ischemia-induced decline of both 2-deoxyglucose uptake and CA1 field potential in hippocampal slices, whereas alpha 1- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, or alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists produced a remarkable neuroprotective action against these deficits. The results indicate that stimulation of adrenoceptors may play a detrimental role in the development of ischemic damage, and suggest a neuroprotective action for adrenoceptor antagonists, which may lessen the functional deficits induced by ischemia.",

Only half of the patients on beta-agonists used inhaled corticosteroids prophylactically. Drug interactions capable of causing changes in plasma theophylline concentrations appeared in only a small number of patients.

    "56": "The anti-ischemic efficacy of diltiazem may improve with increments in dosage and with additional beta-blocking therapy. However, the combined administration could lead to adverse effects through amplification of negative inotropic and chronotropic properties. To evaluate hemodynamic tolerability and safety of high-dose intravenous diltiazem in patients with coronary artery disease receiving long-term metoprolol treatment, 9 such patients were studied for 30 minutes after onset of intravenous diltiazem administration (0.5 mg/kg for 5 minutes, followed by 15 mg/hour). Diltiazem plasma levels peaked at 5 minutes (641 +/- 74 micrograms/liter), decreasing to 177 micrograms/liter at 30 minutes. Average metoprolol levels (43 +/- 12 micrograms/liter) did not change. Diltiazem immediately decreased systemic vascular resistance, left ventricular systolic and mean aortic pressures (29, 21 and 20%, respectively, at 5 minutes), and they remained significantly reduced at 30 minutes. Heart rate initially increased by 11% during the bolus infusion (p < 0.05). Concomitantly, contractility indexes Vmax and Vce40, measured at fixed heart rates, also increased significantly by 11%. Both heart rate and contractility indexes returned to baseline levels thereafter. Cardiac output increased by 10% (p = not significant), stroke index remained unchanged, but stroke work decreased significantly by 20%. Also, the tension-time index was significantly reduced (23%). Diltiazem induced moderate negative lusitropic effects, the first derivative of negative left ventricular pressure decline decreased by 12% and Tau 2 lengthened by 13%. Concomitantly, left ventricular filling pressure increased from 19 +/- 2 to 23 +/- 3 mm Hg, but only at 5 and 15 minutes.

    "57": "The skeletal alpha-actin gene encodes a major component of the embryonic cardiac sarcomere that is strongly and selectively re-induced during beta-adrenoceptor-mediated hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. We present evidence that beta-adrenergic induction of this gene is mediated, not by cAMP, but by a calcium-dependent pathway involving ryanodine-sensitive calcium stores. Nifedipine-induced blockade of the plasma membrane L-type calcium entry channel prevented induction of skeletal alpha-actin mRNA by isoproterenol. Activation of calcium entry by the dihydropyridine agonist Bay K8644 independently induced skeletal alpha-actin mRNA, as did cholera toxin-mediated activation of Gs. Induction of skeletal alpha-actin mRNA by compounds that directly elevate cAMP was weak relative to their effects on other cAMP-dependent phenomena and required calcium entry. In addition, selective inhibition of protein kinase A with KT5720 did not block beta-adrenergic induction of skeletal alpha-actin. Calcium ionophore A23187 did not induce skeletal actin, but prevented its induction by isoproterenol. Ryanodine had bimodal effects: 10(-10) M ryanodine induced skeletal alpha-actin mRNA, whereas 10(-6) M ryanodine prevented skeletal actin induction by beta-adrenergic stimuli. We postulate that beta-adrenergic stimulation of skeletal alpha-actin mRNA requires G-protein-coupled calcium channel activation and compartmentalized calcium release in a manner independent of the cAMP/protein kinase A signal pathway.", 
    "58": "RR variability was analyzed in 15 patients with ventricular arrhythmias to evaluate whether the antiarrhythmic action of propafenone is associated with alteration of neural control mechanisms. Before drug administration, spectral analysis of RR variability was characterized by 2 major components at low and high frequency, which are considered to reflect sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of the heart period. After propafenone (600 to 900 mg/day), there was a marked reduction in RR variance (826 +/- 184 to 412 +/- 77 ms2; p < 0.05), although the mean RR interval was unchanged. The drug significantly reduced the low-frequency component (52 +/- 6 to 28 +/- 4 nu) and augmented the high-frequency component (39 +/- 6 to 55 +/- 5 nu). As a result, the low-/high-frequency ratio (an index of sympathovagal balance) decreased from 2.0 +/- 0.4 to 0.6 +/- 0.1. A positive correlation between serum levels and drug-induced changes in the low-frequency component was also observed. Furthermore, the increase in the low-frequency component induced by tilt (53 +/- 5 to 79 +/- 3 nu) was markedly attenuated after drug administration (27 +/- 5 to 54 +/- 7 nu). Thus, propafenone administration is associated with changes in spectral components that are consistent with a beta-blocking effect of the drug.", 
    "59": "An agonist-activated phospholipase D/phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAH) pathway was recently demonstrated in human neutrophils, and evidence suggests that phosphatidic acid (PA) and/or diradylglycerol (DG) generated from this pathway participates in activation of the O2(-)-generating respiratory burst. We have used a series of cationic amphiphilic compounds (sphingosine, propranolol, chlorpromazine, and desipramine) and antibiotics (clindamycin, trimethoprim, and roxithromycin) all of which inhibit the respiratory burst, to investigate the role of the phospholipase D/PAH pathway in neutrophil activation. The phosphatidylcholine (PC) pool in intact cells was first labeled using [3H]-1-O-alkyl-lysoPC; released [3H]-PA and [3H]-DG were then quantified after the addition of either chemo-attractant or PMA. Using either agonist, all compounds showed a dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]-DG generation which correlated with inhibition of O2- generation, but compounds failed to inhibit directly the NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system. For either activator, a plot of the ID50 values for O2- generation vs those for DG generation was linear over four orders of magnitude. In many cases, inhibition of [3H]-DG generation corresponded to an increase in [3H]-PA, implicating PAH as the locus of inhibition. Superoxide generation was inhibited under conditions where PA was either elevated or minimally affected. Neither O2- release nor DG generation showed any selectivity for stereoisomers of propranolol, suggesting that this inhibition does not act via a specific binding site on PAH. No evidence was obtained for an effect of the inhibitors on PA mobility as monitored by electron spin resonance studies of spin-labeled PA in a model membrane system. Data are consistent with an effect of the inhibitors at the level of the interaction of PAH with the membrane and/or its substrate. These data imply that DG produced via the phospholipase D/PAH pathway functions in the activation or maintenance of the respiratory burst.", 
    "60": "We have previously shown that the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulates activity of the ubiquitous Na-H exchanger (NHE-1) independently of changes in cAMP accumulation and independently of a cholera toxin-sensitive stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs). To further investigate the potential role of a GTP-binding protein in coupling the beta-AR to NHE-1, we have used a recently available nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, \"caged\" guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), to study time-dependent effects of GTP on NHE-1 in intact cells. By monitoring intracellular pH (pHi) in cells loaded with the fluorescent pH-sensitive dye, 2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, we determined NHE-1 activity in primary cultures of canine enteric endocrine cells, which express an endogenous beta-AR, and in mouse L cells stably transfected with either the wild type hamster beta 2-AR or a mutant construct of the hamster beta 2-AR containing a deletion in amino acid residues 222-229. This D(222-229)beta 2-AR is functionally uncoupled from Gs and adenylylcyclase. In all three cell types, NaF and GTP gamma S induced an increase in activity of the exchanger, determined by assessing the rate of pHi recovery from an acute intracellular acid load (dpHi/dt). This increase in pHi recovery was dependent on extracellular Na+ and sensitive to the amiloride analog ethylisopropylamiloride. GTP gamma S, but not NaF, also increased beta-adrenergic stimulation of resting NHE-1 activity. The alkalinization in response to isoproterenol was reversed by propranolol in the absence, but not the presence, of GTP gamma S and was completely blocked by GDP beta S. The ability of guanine nucleotides to regulate beta-adrenergic activation of NHE-1 in cells expressing the mutant D(222-229)beta 2-AR suggests that functional coupling of the beta-AR to NHE-1 may be mediated by a GTP-binding protein other than Gs.", 
    "61": "With respect to prevention of its most common complication--mortality from coronary heart disease--treatment of hypertension had disappointed. It is possible that this is due to negative effects of antihypertensives on lipid metabolism.", 
    "62": "The effects of beta blockers on lipid metabolism can be differentiated principally, in accordance with the classification of beta blockers into those with and those without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), as also selectivity and non-selectivity. Thus, non-selective beta blockers with no ISA usually lead to an increase in triglycerides of 25% to 30%, and a decrease in HDL cholesterol of about 15%. On average, beta-1 selective blockers result in a smaller increase in triglycerides. Beta blockers with ISA, in contrast, are largely neutral vis-\u00e0-vis lipid metabolism. In the individual case, in particular in the presence of hyperlipoproteinemia, the effects cannot be reliably predicted.", 
    "63": "Lipoprotein concentrations should be monitored during treatment with beta blockers. If necessary, a change in the agent employed is recommended. In the case of prevention of a second myocardial infarction, for which various studies have unequivocally shown a reduction in mortality associated with treatment with beta blockers with no ISA, these side effects will, however, be accepted--with the exception of extreme changes--for a limited period of time.", 
    "64": "Multiple administrations of the psychotomimetic drug, phencyclidine-HCI (PCP), decreased striatal neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) levels in a dose-dependent manner. Single or multiple PCP administrations decreased striatal NPY levels after 10-12 h; levels returned to control 24 h after a single dose or 58 h after multiple doses. In contrast, no significant changes were seen in nigral NPY levels with either acute or multiple-dose PCP treatments. The role of monoamine, sigma or opioid receptors in PCP-induced striatal NPY changes was evaluated. When administered alone, the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin, the sigma antagonist, BMY 14802, and the dopamine D2 antagonist, sulpiride decreased striatal NPY levels; however, only prazosin and the dopamine D1 antagonist, SCH 23390, significantly attenuated PCP-induced changes. Administration of the gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) inhibitors, amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA) or gamma-vinyl-GABA (GVG, vigabatrin, MDL 71,754) alone had no effect on striatal NPY-LI levels while administration of these indirect GABA agonists prior to or concurrently with PCP treatment completely blocked PCP-induced changes in striatal NPY-LI levels. The effect of the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, MK-801, on striatal NPY-LI content resembled that of PCP and was also blocked by the two indirect GABA agonists. These data suggest that NPY systems are modulated by glutamatergic activity (specifically by the NMDA receptor) and that the interaction between these two transmitter systems is mediated by GABAergic mechanisms.", 
    "65": "The effects of various doses of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist clonidine administered systemically (30, 50 and 100 micrograms/kg i.v.), were investigated on the vocalization threshold to paw pressure in normal rats and in rats with Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis. Previous results have suggested that there is an increase in the activity of the bulbospinal noradrenergic systems in these arthritic animals. In the present study, clonidine led to significant antinociceptive effects in both groups of rats. Clonidine was found to be highly effective in arthritic animals, even at the lower concentration: the elevation in threshold produced by 30 micrograms/kg i.v. was 160% in arthritic vs. 124% in normal rats. The effects of clonidine were prevented dose-dependently by pretreatment with yohimbine or idazoxan 250 to 1000 micrograms/kg i.v., in the two groups of rats, indicating clearly that the dose-dependent effects of i.v. clonidine are mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "66": "The oxidative metabolism of cinnarizine (CZ) [1-(diphenylmethyl)-4-(3-phenyl-2-propenyl)-piperazine] to 1-(diphenylmethyl)piperazine (M-1), 1-(diphenylmethyl)-4-[3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propenyl]piperazine (M-2), benzophenone (M-3) and 1-[4'-hydroxyphenyl)-phenylmethyl]-4-(3- phenyl-2-propenyl)piperazine (M-4) has been studied in rat liver microsomes. In Wistar rats, kinetic analysis revealed sex differences (male > female) in the Km values for formation of all the metabolites and the Vmax values for the formation of M-1, M-3 and M-4. The reactions required NADPH, and were inhibited by carbon monoxide and SKF 525-A. Only M-2 formation was suppressed by sparteine or metoprolol, and was significantly lower in female Dark Agouti rats than in Wistar rats of both sexes. The results suggest that CZ is oxidized by cytochrome P450, and M-2 formation is related to debrisoquine/sparteine-type polymorphic drug oxidation.", 
    "67": "Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, also inhibits phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, the enzyme that converts phosphatidic acid into diacylglycerol. This latter effect has prompted recent use of propranolol in studies examining the importance of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid in cellular signalling events. Here, we show that propranolol is also an inhibitor of protein kinase C. At concentrations greater than or equal to 20 microM, propranolol reduced [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding (IC50 = 200 microM) and phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated superoxide anion release (IC50 = 130 microM) in human neutrophils. Scatchard analysis showed that propranolol lowers the number of phorbol diester binding sites without significantly affecting their affinity. In vitro kinetic analysis, performed in a mixed micellar assay with protein kinase C purified from human neutrophils, suggested a competitive inhibition of propranolol with the cofactor phosphatidylserine. Complex kinetic patterns were observed with respect to diacylglycerol and ATP, approximating competitive and noncompetitive inhibition, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that the drug interacts at the level of the regulatory domain of the enzyme. Fifty % inhibition occurred at approximately 150 microM propranolol. Similar levels of inhibition were obtained using exogenous (histone) and endogenous (p47-phox, a NADPH oxidase component) substrates. Protein kinase C-alpha and protein kinase C-beta, two protein kinase C isozymes present in human neutrophils, were inhibited by propranolol in a comparable manner. In the range of concentrations tested (30-1000 microM), neither cAMP-dependent protein kinase nor neutrophil protein tyrosine kinases were affected. The racemic form of propranolol and the (+) and the (-) stereoisomers were equally active, and other beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (pindolol) and agonists (isoproterenol) were inactive. This suggests that the inhibitory action of propranolol on protein kinase C is related to the amphipathic nature of the drug rather than to its beta-adrenergic receptor blocking ability. Analogs of propranolol were synthesized and found to be more potent protein kinase C inhibitors, with IC50 values in the 10-20 microM range. We conclude that the ability of propranolol to inhibit both protein kinase C and PA phosphohydrolase complicates interpretation of results when this drug is used in signal transduction studies. In addition, propranolol may be a useful prototype for the synthesis of new protein kinase C inhibitors.", 
    "68": "alpha-Adrenergic stimulation (alpha-AS) and beta-adrenergic stimulation (beta-AS) of the myocardium are associated respectively with an increase and a decrease in myofilament responsiveness to Ca2+. We hypothesized that changes in cytosolic pH (pH(i)) may modulate these opposite actions of alpha-AS and beta-AS. The effects of alpha-AS (50 microM phenylephrine and 1 microM nadolol) and beta-AS (0.05 microM isoproterenol) on contraction and either cytosolic Ca2+ (Cai) or pH(i) were assessed in adult rat ventricular myocytes bathed in bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.36 +/- 0.05). In cells loaded with the ester derivative (AM form) of indo-1, the 410/490-nm ratio of emitted fluorescence indexed Cai. Myofilament responsiveness to Ca2+ was assessed by the relaxation phase of the length-indo-1 fluorescence relation during a twitch. alpha-AS and beta-AS shifted this relation in opposite directions, indicating that alpha-AS increased and beta-AS decreased myofilament responsiveness to Ca2+. In addition, the positive inotropic action of alpha-AS was associated with an increased Cai transient amplitude in 50% of the myocytes (n = 12), whereas beta-AS always increased Cai (n = 5). In cells loaded with the fluorescent pH(i) probe SNARF-1 AM, the emitted 590/640-nm fluorescence is a measure of pH(i). The effect of alpha-AS on the extent of cell shortening during the twitch (ES) was expressed as the percentage of resting cell length. Both ES and pH(i) were assessed in myocytes bathed in 1.5 mM [Ca2+] and stimulated at 0.5 Hz (control ES, 7.4 +/- 1.5%; control pH(i), 7.11 +/- 0.05; n = 10). alpha-AS enhanced both ES (delta ES, 1.8 +/- 0.6%; p less than 0.05) and pH(i) (delta pH(i), 0.06 +/- 0.01; p less than 0.005), and there was a significant correlation between delta ES and delta pH(i) (r = 0.76, p less than 0.05). A similar effect of alpha-AS on pH(i) was observed in the absence of electrical stimulation (n = 8). The alpha-AS-induced enhancement of ES and pH(i) was abolished by 10 microM ethylisopropylamiloride, a Na(+)-H+ exchange inhibitor (n = 7). In additional experiments, myocytes were preincubated either with 0.2 microM 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (n = 8) or with 5 nM staurosporine (n = 8), which have been shown to downregulate and inhibit Ca(2+)-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C, respectively. In either group, alpha-AS had no effect on pH(i) and decreased ES to approximately 60% of control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The influences of Carteolol and Timolol eye drops on intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual fields were compared in a multi-center, double-masked, prospective study. Two-hundred and forty eyes of 120 patients were initially included in the study, and 142 eyes of 72 patients fulfilled all the criteria for final statistical analysis. Both drugs significantly reduced IOP. The visual fields in both treatment groups did not change during one year of treatment. In both groups some patients improved slightly, and others deteriorated slightly. This indicates that locally applied beta-blockers may efficiently stop further progression of visual field defects in cases with increased IOP and early visual field damage. There was no difference between Carteolol and Timolol in this regard. The side effects were minimal, and there were no differences in their frequency or intensity in the two treatment groups.",

In 23 control subjects the above mentioned parameters were assessed only under basal conditions. In hypertensive patients urinary THP excretion was not different from controls. In all examined groups a significant positive correlation was found between urine volume and urinary THP excretion under basal conditions. Such a correlation was absent after nifedipine or propranolol therapy respectively, but still existed after furosemide administration.

In all patients administration of the drug led during the third hour to a statistically significant drop of the blood pressure after a load. Twenty-four hours after administration the drop was no longer statistically significant. In patients with a high cardiac index (group A, n = 6) the decline of blood pressure was due to a blocked increment of the cardiac output and a slight block of the peripheral vascular resistance. In the group with a low cardiac index and high peripheral vascular resistance (group B, n = 3) the drop of the blood pressure was less marked than in group A and it was due only to the blocked increment of the cardiac output. The increment of the peripheral vascular resistance was not influenced by the preparation. Bisoprolol did not affect the left ventricular systolic function.",

Treatments were performed for 16 days, orally with dosages reducing heart beat/min by 25% (metoprolol 10 mg/kg, propranolol 1 mg/kg). Liver glycogen content was not influenced by either beta-blocker in healthy animals. CCl4-induced loss of glycogen was equally moderated by metoprolol and propranolol. Blood glucose increased in metoprolol treated healthy and liver damaged rats after a single dosage likewise following prolonged treatment. Propranolol was without effect on blood glucose level. Cytochrome P-450 decline in microsomal fraction was greater in metoprolol, than in propranolol treated healthy animals. However, the severe fall elicited by liver injury was moderated by metoprolol and normalised by propranolol. Cytochrome b5 seems to be involved in metoprolol metabolism. Cytochrome P-450-dependent aminopyrine-N-demethylase was impeded by metoprolol in animals with healthy liver. The serious inhibition caused by CCl4 was moderated by metoprolol and with a better result by propranolol. The high serum bilirubin level in liver lesion was lowered by metoprolol and particularly by propranolol. Neither phase I metabolic process aminopyrine-N-demethylation nor phase II glucuronidation were normalised.

    "82": "Clinical and experimental investigations have revealed changes of the Na, K, Ca and Mg concentration in serum and cells in patients with essential arterial hypertension (EAH). Some hypotensive drugs correct, more or less, the electrolytic abnormalities at the same time as the decrease of arterial pressure. Epidemiological studies have shown a lower arterial blood pressure in populations with decreased intake of Na and an increased intake of K, Ca and Mg. However the most frequently encountered electrolyte anomaly in patients with EAH is hypophosphatemia, mainly induced by a shift of inorganic phosphate from serum into the cells. Probably the increased influx of inorganic phosphate from the serum, increases the arterial cellular energetic potential. As hypotensive drugs lead to a reduction of the inorganic phosphate shift from serum into the cells one may suggest that the obtained decrease of arterial blood pressure may be at least partially due to a diminished energetic potential of certain cells.",

The effects of each of these drugs on hemoglobin (Hb) concentration during maximal exercise and on maximal exercise performance were investigated. The maximal incremental exercise protocol began at 4.0 km/h and 0% grade and finished at 5.6 km/h and 12% grade, with speed or grade increases every 1.5 minutes. Maximal exercise in control (untreated) sheep caused a mean 42% increase in hematocrit and 44% increase in Hb. This exercise-induced increase in Hb was unaffected by propranolol but was partially blocked by phenoxybenzamine. Epinephrine caused an immediate increase in Hb which abated during the early minutes of exercise and then subsequently increased toward the end of the exercise challenge. Maximum oxygen consumption (VO2) in control sheep was 47.6 +/- 6.7 ml/min per kilogram. Maximum VO2 after epinephrine, 51.6 +/- 8.7 ml/min per kilogram, was not significantly different from control.

In the present study, amino acid concentrations were investigated before and up to 3 hours after beta blockade (Inderal, 40-80 mg, n = 10) or fasting (n = 8) in cirrhotic patients. In the basal state the patients had low levels of all three BCAA, as compared with healthy subjects.

Psychosocial stress has been shown to accelerate atherogenesis in animals, an effect probably mediated via beta-adrenoceptor activation. In view of the postulated roles of platelets and beta-adrenoceptor activation in atherosclerosis development, we decided to test whether beta blockade affects arterial platelet accumulation. We studied the accumulation of radioactivity from 111In-labelled platelets on the wall of the thoracic aorta of rabbits as a measure of platelet accumulation. During the exposure to the labelled platelets, the animals were also exposed to 3 hours of chloralose anesthesia. This is a reproducible model of experimental sympathetic activation, including beta-adrenoceptor activation, which we used to amplify possible effects of beta-blockade on platelet-vessel wall interaction. The effectiveness of the anesthesia in increasing sympathetic activity was verified by significant rises in mean arterial blood pressure (from 77 to 88 mmHg), heart rate (190 to 290 bpm), and plasma levels of norepinephrine (1.0 to 3.3 nM) and epinephrine (0.13 to 0.83 nM). In chloralose anesthetized rabbits, approximately 30 x 10(-9)% of the injected 111In accumulated in each square millimeter of intima at unbranched thoracic aorta. Platelet accumulation was significantly higher at arterial branching points, 70% higher at intercostal artery bifurcations, and 150% higher at coronary artery bifurcations than in unbranched aortic intima.

We studied 14 elderly men, aged 64-85 years, and 14 younger men, aged 29-48 years, in the early postfibrinolytic phase of acute myocardial infarction. All the patients were in Killip class I. A triple-lumen Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter was introduced into the right heart chambers. The patients received 5 mg intravenous atenolol over 5 minutes. All hemodynamic parameters were measured before and 10 minutes after atenolol. The hemodynamic characteristics and the location and extent of acute myocardial infarction were the same in both groups before atenolol. The hemodynamic changes after atenolol administration were the same in the two groups, but the stroke volume and cardiac indexes decreased to a greater extent in the elderly (p = .01 and p = .0001, respectively). These results indicate that intravenous atenolol in the early postfibrinolytic phase of acute myocardial infarction is safe in Killip class I elderly patients, although the cardiac and stroke volume indexes decrease, and the increase in the total systemic resistance is more in older than in younger patients.",

    "96": "All three drugs suppressed ventricular salvos (> 3, < 5 consecutive ventricular premature contractions) (p < 0.01) and VT (p < 0.05) on Holter monitoring and did not differ statistically in effect. Exercise induced VT was also suppressed by all three drugs (p < 0.01), and of these sotalol was the most effective although this was not statistically significant (14/23 inducible when drug free, 4/23 on flecainide, 2/23 on sotalol, 5/23 on verapamil). Sustained and non-sustained VT induced by programmed stimulation was also suppressed by the three drugs (p < 0.01) and again sotalol was the best of these though the differences did not achieve statistical significance (17/23 inducible when drug free, 4/17 on flecainide, 2/17 on sotalol, and 6/17 on verapamil). Proarrhythmic effects of drugs were found in a few patients. There was no difference in the efficacy of the drugs in patients with histological abnormalities of the myocardium when compared with those of normal histology.", 
    "97": "Ventricular tachycardia associated with a clinically normal heart can be suppressed by flecainide, sotalol, or verapamil. In individual patients sotalol was the most frequently effective drug (effective in > 89% of patients) and is a suitable choice for first line treatment.", 
    "98": "The effect of oxprenolol HCl loading on the kinetics of polymer swelling and drug release from suspension-polymerized poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PMMA/MAA) beads has been studied in detail. Within the range of variables studied, the polymer swelling rate increases with buffer pH and concentration. And an ionization-controlled swelling mechanism (analogous to the relaxation-controlled mechanism) mechanism) seems to become more rate-limiting at higher buffer concentrations. At oxprenolol HCL loading levels below 17.8%, the drug release and associated dimensional changes (in pH 7.4) exhibit an extended quasi-linear region despite the inherent limitation of spherical geometry. At higher loading levels, the drug release becomes faster and first-order in nature. This is apparently a result of the transition from a dissolved to a dispersed system above a percolation threshold (15-18% loading in the present study). As a result of competition from processes such as the reduction of bead dimension due to drug release and the dimensional increase due to polymer swelling and osmotic contributions from the drug, the transient bead diameter increases monotonically during drug release at loading levels up to 25.6%, whereas upon further increasing the drug loading, the bead diameter goes through a maximum during the early drug release, which eventually increases again as a result of the slow but continuous increase in polymer swelling due to further ionization. In all cases, both the drug release and the dimensional changes approach completion as the penetrating ionization fronts meet at the center, indicating a true swelling-controlled behavior.", 
    "99": "Maximal trachealis muscle shortening in vivo was compared with that in vitro in seven anesthetized dogs. In addition, the effect of graded elastic loads on the muscle was evaluated in vitro. In vivo trachealis muscle shortening, as measured using sonomicrometry, revealed maximal active shortening to be 28.8 +/- 11.7% (SD) of initial length. Trachealis muscle preparations from the same animals were studied in vitro to evaluate isometric force generation, isotonic shortening, and the effect of applying linear elastic loads to the trachealis muscle during contraction from optimal length. Maximal isotonic shortening was 66.8 +/- 8.4% of optimal length in vitro. Increasing elastic loads decreased active shortening and velocity of shortening in vitro in a hyperbolic manner. The elastic load required to decrease in vitro shortening to the extent of the shortening observed in vivo was similar to the estimated load provided by the tracheal cartilage. We conclude that decreased active shortening in vivo is primarily due to the elastic afterload provided by cartilage.", 
    "100": "To test the desensitization hypothesis of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) in chronic hypoxia, the effect of 1, 3, 7, 15, and 21 days of exposure to hypobaric hypoxia (380 Torr) was evaluated in Wistar rats. Exposure to hypoxia for 1-15 days did not induce any change in right and left ventricular beta-AR density (Bmax) determined with [125I]iodocyanopindolol or in antagonist affinity. After 21 days, Bmax decreased by 24% in the left ventricle. In contrast, no change in beta-AR was shown in the right hypertrophied ventricle. Agonist affinity in the left ventricle was not altered, as shown by the analysis of displacement curves of isoproterenol (normoxia 185 +/- 26 nM, hypoxia 170 +/- 11 nM). Moreover, there was no significant decrease in adenylate cyclase activity (pmol.mg-1.min-1) in the left ventricle. In the right ventricle, a 21-day exposure to hypoxia led to a decrease in basal and maximal activity when stimulated by isoproterenol. A decrease in tissue norepinephrine content was observed after 7 days of hypoxia. In conclusion, these data support the beta-AR downregulation hypothesis as one of the mechanisms of myocardial adaptation to high altitude occurring after 2-3 wk of exposure to hypoxia. The regulation pathways of beta-AR may differ between left nonhypertrophied and right hypertrophied ventricles. No evidence of profound abnormality of signal transduction was shown.", 
    "101": "We studied three women with the long QT syndrome. They were aged 42, 52 and 25 years and had experienced recurrent syncopal attacks. We followed case 1 for 17, case 2 for 18, and case 3 for over 6 y. The attacks tended to occur during the premenstrual stage in case 1 and case 2; case 3 often experienced attacks after exercise. The QT(U)c intervals on admission were 0.68, 0.62, and 0.50 in case 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Torsade de pointes followed by ventricular fibrillation was documented in case 1 and case 2. Although each was treated with a beta-blocker, none was fully compliant with the regimen. In case 1, estrogen therapy administered to maintain the hormonal balance premenstrually effectively prevented attacks. Despite the inconsistent use of beta-blockers, the attacks in case 1 and case 2 tended to decrease with age. Case 2 experienced no attacks after menopause. Cause 3 took medication consistently and remained free of attacks for over 6 y. Although she discontinued beta-blocker therapy because of pregnancy, she has experienced no attacks to date. These case studies suggest that hormonal status may be important in the development of syncopal attacks in female patients with the long QT syndrome.", 
    "102": "The relationship between racemic sotalol plasma concentrations and QTc interval prolongation after both single-dose and repeated administration of three sotalol oral doses was studied in a randomized crossover protocol performed in 10 healthy volunteers. QTc interval increase was significant after the three single-dose sotalol administrations and was significantly related to the administered dose (p < 0.0001). In 21 of 30 analyses, QTc interval was linearly correlated with sotalol plasma concentrations. After the 320 mg dose, the linear model was a best fit for 90% of the cases, and no hysteresis was observed. After repeated sotalol administration, 69 of 87 QTc interval measurements at steady state could be predicted from the plasma concentration versus effect relationship established after single-dose 320 mg administration. Seventeen of 18 errors (94%) corresponded to QTc intervals that were significantly lower than predicted. These findings suggest that a short-term individual linear model determined after a 320 mg test dose of sotalol allows a good prediction of expected maximal increase in QTc duration in healthy subjects.",

    "104": "Twenty-four patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and no contraindications to atenolol participated in the study. The study design required randomized assignment to one of three groups: placebo followed by 50 mg atenolol daily, followed by no treatment, each for 1 week; atenolol followed by placebo; and atenolol followed by nothing (to show residual drug effects). Twice-daily blood pressure measurements were made by patients at home; once-weekly measurements of blood pressure and heart rate were made by a research nurse.", 
    "105": "Before drug treatment, there were no differences in the antihypertensive responses of patients taking placebo and patients taking nothing (difference, 0.98 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -0.98 to 2.93). After atenolol treatment, placebo treatment produced a significantly greater antihypertensive response than no treatment (difference, -6.09 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -11.81 to -0.38). Thus the placebo response after atenolol administration was more than a residual drug effect. Similar patterns were observed for heart rate but not for blood pressure readings taken in the office.", 
    "106": "These observations are consistent with a conditioning model of placebo effects. These findings warrant further investigation in larger studies and in other disease models.", 
    "107": "An elderly woman developed an Alzheimer-like subacute dementia as a result of propranolol toxicity. Analysis of the manifestations showed that severe impairment of memory accounted for virtually all of the abnormalities. There is evidence that cerebral reactions to drug toxicity can exhibit patterns that suggest highly selective involvement of functional subdivisions of the brain.", 
    "108": "The efficacy and safety of amlodipine (2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg) once daily was compared with atenolol (50 mg to 100 mg) once daily in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension in a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. One hundred and twenty-five patients were randomly allocated at the end of a 4-week run-in placebo period to 8 weeks' double-blind treatment with amlodipine (n = 41), atenolol (n = 43), or placebo (n = 41). The mean changes from baseline in blood pressure 24 h postdose for amlodipine (mean daily dose 8.8 mg) were -12.8/-10.1 mm Hg for supine and -11.5/-9.8 mm Hg for standing blood pressure (P < .001). For atenolol (mean daily dose 83.7 mg) the changes were -11.3/-11.7 mm Hg for supine and -13.3/-12.3 mm Hg for standing blood pressure (P < .001). There were no statistically significant differences between treatments. The responder rates for amlodipine, atenolol, and placebo were 61.1%, 64.9%, and 11.1%, respectively. Determinations taken over the 24-h period at the final visit revealed that amlodipine and atenolol maintained the group mean supine blood pressure at or below 140/90 mm Hg throughout the period of observation; the corresponding time-effect curve for the placebo group was clearly in the hypertensive range. Heart rate was significantly lowered by atenolol only. Both amlodipine and atenolol were well-tolerated. Only one patient was withdrawn because of the development of peripheral edema, arthralgia, and fatigue after treatment with amlodipine. This study demonstrates that once-daily administration of amlodipine or atenolol to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients was well-tolerated and provided adequate blood pressure control throughout the 24-h dosing interval.", 
    "109": "To investigate the stimulation of phosphatidic acid formation in bovine aortic endothelial cells by P2-purinergic agonists, we labelled AG4762 cells with [32P]P1 and stimulated in the presence of butanol. Under these conditions phospholipase D generated [32P]phosphatidylbutanol, whereas the [32P]phosphatidic acid from phospholipase C and diacylglycerol kinase was unchanged. The action of various purinergic agonists on both [32P]phosphatidic acid and [32P]phosphatidylbutanol was consistent with the presence of a P2Y receptor. The stimulation of phospholipase D was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and was mostly transient (completed within 3 min), whereas the initial stimulation of phospholipase C was independent of extracellular Ca2+, followed by a Ca(2+)-dependent phase. The agonist stimulation of phospholipase D was dependent on protein kinase C, as judged by its sensitivity to the relatively selective protein kinase C inhibitor Ro 31-8220. These results show that purinergic-receptor-mediated stimulation of phosphatidic acid has three phases: an initial Ca(2+)-independent stimulation of phospholipase C, an early but transient Ca(2+)- and protein kinase C-dependent stimulation of phospholipase D, and a sustained Ca(2+)-dependent stimulation of phospholipase C. Using propranolol to inhibit phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, we provide evidence that phosphatidic acid derived from purinergic-receptor-mediated stimulation of the phospholipase C/diacylglycerol kinase route can itself be converted back into diacylglycerol.", 
    "110": "Agitation after traumatic brain injury is disruptive for patient care, distressing, and difficult to treat. The use of propranolol has been advocated to control agitation after brain injury. It reportedly lacks some of the deleterious cognitive and emotional effects of other medications and physical restraints. This study was designed to test if propranolol is effective in reducing agitated behavior. Subjects had traumatic closed-head injury treated at a combined Level I Trauma Center and Rehabilitation Center. Twenty-one subjects met the criteria of agitation and were treated with propranolol or placebo in a double-blind fashion. The intensity of agitation was significantly lower in the treatment group although the number of episodes were similar. The use of restraints was also significantly lower in the treatment group. The results support the effectiveness of propranolol in reducing the intensity of agitation during the initial hospitalization after closed-head injury.", 
    "111": "Lung morphogenesis is in part regulated by extracellular matrix (ECM), and cytokines may indirectly control lung development via modulation of ECM. In the present study, we investigated the effect of different platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms AA, AB, and BB on the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) by fetal rat lung cells. Independent of gestational age, PDGF-BB, but not PDGF-AA or -AB, stimulated GAG synthesis of fetal lung fibroblasts. In contrast, GAG synthesis by epithelial cells was not affected by any of the PDGF molecules. The stimulatory effect of PDGF-BB on fibroblast GAG biosynthesis was dose (> 10 ng/ml) and time (> 8 h) dependent. The relative proportion of the individual GAG molecules was not altered by PDGF-BB exposure. Blockage of tyrosine kinase activity with staurosporine did abolish the effect of PDGF-BB on fibroblast GAG formation. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide did not abrogate the PDGF-BB effect, suggesting that no new RNA or protein synthesis is required. The proteoglycan synthesis blocker, beta-D-xyloside, also did not inhibit the PDGF-BB action on fibroblast GAG synthesis. These data suggest that the effect of PDGF on GAG synthesis is cell type and isoform specific and is most likely a direct effect on the GAG chain elongation enzymes.", 
    "112": "Muscle contraction in vitro increases glucose uptake (GU), independent of insulin, but in vivo, the exercise-induced increase in GU is impaired in insulin-deficient diabetic dogs. We wished to determine whether, in vivo, suppression of the free fatty acid (FFA)-glucose cycle with methylpalmoxirate (MP, inhibitor of FFA oxidation) alone or combined with propranolol (PRO, beta-blocker) could improve GU during exercise in the absence of insulin. We performed four groups of exercise experiments (6 km/h, 10% slope) in depancreatized insulin-deprived dogs: 1) control (n = 6); 2) MP treated (5 oral doses of 10 mg/kg, twice daily, n = 6); 3) treated with MP+octanoate (OCT; oxidation unaffected by MP, 27 mumol.kg-1.min-1 iv during exercise; n = 5); and 4) MP+PRO treated (5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 iv during exercise, n = 6). MP abolished ketosis (inhibition of hepatic FFA oxidation), decreased basal glucose production (GP), and increased metabolic clearance of glucose (MCR). During exercise, MP attenuated the increment in GP (P < 0.01), which was reversed by OCT. MP did not affect the exercise-induced increase in GU and MCR. With MP+PRO, FFAs decreased and lactate did not rise during exercise. GP was not further suppressed, but GU and MCR were increased (P < 0.01) to 89 and 31% of normal, respectively. In insulin-deprived depancreatized dogs, glucose cycling was increased to a greater extent than GP, as in type II diabetes. By the end of exercise, glucose cycling increased (P < 0.05), but to a similar extent as GP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "113": "Twenty-four-hour energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation rates were studied in a respiration chamber in 15 reduced-obese (BMI = 24.7) and 8 nonobese (BMI = 20.1) women. Two experiments were performed, one in which beta-blockade was introduced by propranolol and one with placebo. When adjusted for differences in fat-free mass, no difference in 24-h EE was found between the reduced-obese and nonobese groups in placebo experiments. Propranolol reduced 24-h EE by 2.7% in the reduced-obese group whereas no reduction was seen in the nonobese group. A positive correlation was found between fasting glycerol concentration and lipid oxidation. During daytime, lipid oxidation was reduced and carbohydrate oxidation increased by propranolol only in the nonobese subjects. Propranolol reduced fasting glycerol and free fatty acid concentrations in both groups. Beta-blockade seems to have little effect on sedentary 24-h EE but may have a suppressing effect on lipid combustion.", 
    "114": "This study was conducted mainly to investigate the relative contributions of various mechanisms by which bile salts and EDTA may improve the in vitro rectal penetration of insulin in the albino rabbit. Insulin could not cross the rectal mucosa unless Na glycocholate or other penetration enhancers were present. Penetration enhancement was attributed primarily to Na glycocholate's ability to reduce the barrier function of the rectal membrane and to increase the fraction of insulin in its monomeric form, and secondarily to Na glycocholate's ability to protect insulin from proteolysis. Na glycocholate was more effective than Na taurocholate, but less effective than Na deoxycholate and polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether in enhancing rectal insulin penetration. Although EDTA at 0.01 and 0.1% did not affect rectal insulin penetration, it augmented the penetration enhancement effect of 1% Na glycocholate without causing additional damage to the rectal membrane, as judged by protein release. Such an action was attributed to the synergistic effect associated with: 1) an increase in the permeability of the paracellular pathway by EDTA and 2) an increase in the proportion of insulin in the monomeric form by Na glycocholate. Results from parallel in vivo experiments have indicated that it may be possible to achieve significant penetration enhancement by using a combination of otherwise membrane-damaging penetration enhancers which act by complementary mechanisms at concentrations that are both effective and well tolerated by mucosal epithelial cells.", 
    "115": "Despite the therapeutic importance of propranolol and the potential usefulness of propranolol extraction measurements for the assessment of lung disorders, the pulmonary disposition of propranolol remains poorly understood. The extraction, accumulation and distribution of propranolol in lungs of conscious and anesthetized sheep were investigated by indicator-dilution methods, lung lymph fistula preparations and bronchoalveolar lavage. Pulmonary extraction of propranolol from plasma (0.81 +/- 0.03) was significantly less than that of imipramine (0.89 +/- 0.03), not significantly different from that of lidocaine (0.74 +/- 0.03) and much greater than that of water (0.44 +/- 0.02), whereas there were no differences in apparent red blood cell extraction of each indicator from plasma in vitro as determined under similar conditions (0.08-0.1). Pulmonary accumulation of imipramine (78 +/- 3%), lidocaine (52 +/- 4%), propranolol (37 +/- 4%) and water (7 +/- 2%), after a single pass through the pulmonary circulation, correlated positively with octanol/saline partition coefficients but not with pKa values. After bolus i.v. injection of [3H]propranolol, tritium concentrations in lung lymph increased rapidly to exceed plasma concentrations within 60 min and tritium concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage equaled plasma concentrations 5 to 15 min after injection. It is concluded that by a mechanism not involving molecular charge, propranolol permeates capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium to accumulate in hydrophobic regions of the lungs. This study in normal sheep suggests that reduced propranolol extraction by damaged lungs reflects pathological alterations other than endothelial cell dysfunction, such as pulmonary edema.", 
    "116": "We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial to compare the efficacy of sclerotherapy plus propranolol with that of propranolol alone in the prevention of recurrent gastroesophageal bleeding in severely cirrhotic patients. For 2 yr (1987 to 1988) 131 patients (96% of whom were alcoholic) with Child-Pugh class B or C cirrhosis (56% were class B and 44% were class C) were randomly assigned to one of our two treatment groups after cessation of variceal bleeding, without hemostatic sclerosis, and were observed for at least 2 yr. Treatment observance was good in 89% of cases; alcohol withdrawal was observed in 62% of cases. Sclerotherapy was performed weekly with 1% polidocanol, and variceal obliteration was obtained in 83% of cases, in a mean number of four sessions. The cumulative percentages (expressed as mean +/- S.D.) of recurrent bleeding at 2 yr were 42% +/- 6% for propranolol plus sclerotherapy and 59% +/- 6% for propranolol alone (a nonsignificant difference). Twenty-eight patients from the propranolol group but only 12 patients from the propranolol-plus-sclerotherapy group had recurrent bleeding from esophageal variceal rupture (p less than 0.01). The total number of blood units per patient with recurrent bleeding was slightly but not significantly more important in the propranolol group (8 +/- 7) than in the propranolol-plus-sclerotherapy group (5 +/- 5; p = 0.09).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "117": "We hypothesized that the effect of pimobendan (UD-CG 115 BS) to increase calcium sensitivity of contractile protein might result in less myocardial oxygen consumption (VO2) in comparison with dobutamine when they enhance ventricular contractility to the same extent. To examine this hypothesis, we compared the effects of pimobendan and dobutamine on left ventricular contractility and energetics using the frameworks of Emax (contractility index) and the relation between VO2 and PVA (systolic pressure-volume area, a measure of left ventricular total mechanical energy).", 
    "118": "We measured VO2, Emax, PVA, and force-time integral (FTI) in excised, cross-circulated, nonfailing dog hearts. The slope of the VO2-PVA relation reciprocally indicates the efficiency from PVA-dependent VO2 to the total mechanical energy (contractile efficiency). The VO2 intercept of the VO2-PVA relation, i.e., PVA-independent VO2, reflects energy utilization for excitation-contraction coupling. The ratio of FTI to PVA-dependent VO2 can be called contractile economy. Both drugs comparably enhanced Emax. Although the contractile economy was greater by 14 +/- 19% (p less than 0.05) for pimobendan than for dobutamine, the contractile efficiency was similar between the two drugs. Oxygen cost of contractility, defined as the slope of the relation between the PVA-independent VO2 and Emax, was the same between the two drugs. Other mechanoenergetic effects of both drugs were similar except for a greater coronary vasodilating effect of pimobendan.", 
    "119": "Pimobendan has almost the same mechanoenergetic effects as dobutamine but slightly greater contractile economy and coronary vasodilation. The calcium-sensitizing effect of pimobendan did not save the oxygen cost of contractility.", 
    "120": "Recent studies of human type 1 atrial flutter demonstrated reentry in the right atrium and an area of slow conduction in the low posteroseptal right atrium. Direct-current catheter ablation of this area has been only moderately successful in preventing recurrence. Therefore, we performed endocardial activation mapping and entrainment pace mapping during atrial flutter to determine the critical site for radiofrequency ablation of this arrhythmia.", 
    "121": "Twelve consecutive patients (seven men and five women; age, 21-73 years) with type 1 atrial flutter (mean cycle length, 253 +/- 39 msec) underwent right atrial endocardial activation and entrainment pace mapping using standard transvenous catheter techniques to localize the atrial flutter reentrant circuit, the area of slow conduction, and the exit site from the area of slow conduction. Upon identifying appropriate sites, radiofrequency energy (16-29 W) was applied via a 4-mm tipped catheter. Activation mapping of atrial flutter revealed a counterclockwise reentrant wave front originating just inferior or posterior to the coronary sinus ostium, proceeding superiorly in the atrial septum to the right atrial free wall, then inferiorly toward the tricuspid annulus and finally medially between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus, where low-amplitude fragmented electrical activity was noted. Entrainment pace mapping from this area produced an exact P wave match to atrial flutter on 12-lead ECG with a long (greater than 40 msec) stimulus-to-P interval indicating slow conduction, whereas pacing just inferior or posterior to the coronary sinus ostium produced an exact P wave match with a short stimulus-to-P interval (less than 40 msec), presumably identifying the exit site from the area of slow conduction. Radiofrequency energy (one to 14 applications) was effective in terminating and preventing reinduction of atrial flutter in 10 patients. In two patients, atrial flutter was not terminated during radiofrequency energy application but during subsequent pacing attempts. Sites where ablation was successful, located just inferior or posterior to the coronary sinus ostium, were characterized by discrete electrograms with activation times of -20 to -50 msec before P wave onset and exact entrainment pace maps with a stimulus-to-P interval of 20 to 40 msec, consistent with the exit site from the area of slow conduction. Follow-up (mean, 16 +/- 9 weeks; range, 2-31 weeks) revealed recurrence of the original atrial flutter in two patients, one of whom underwent repeat ablation without further recurrence, self-limited infrequent recurrence of a new atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation in three suppressed by beta-blocker or digoxin, and no recurrence in seven.", 
    "122": "1) Radiofrequency energy applied to a critical area in the atrial flutter reentrant circuit, inferior or posterior to the coronary sinus ostium, will terminate and prevent arrhythmia reinduction. 2) Long-term follow-up in a larger series of patients will be required to confirm efficacy of this technique, although short-term results look promising.", 
    "123": "1. The effect of systemic administration of ruthenium red on bronchospasm induced by acetylcholine, capsaicin or selective tachykinin receptor agonists ([Sar9]SP sulfone or [beta Ala8]-neurokinin A (NKA)-(4-10) for NK-1 and NK-2 receptors, respectively) was studied in anaesthetized guinea-pigs. 2. The bronchospasm induced by capsaicin was reduced by ruthenium red, which did not affect the response induced by acetylcholine. Atropine, which totally blocked the response to acetylcholine, also partially blocked the bronchospasm induced by capsaicin. 3. The inhibitory action of atropine and ruthenium red on the bronchospasm produced by capsaicin was additive, independently from the order of administration of the two antagonists. 4. Ruthenium red induced an increase in [Sar9]SP sulfone-bronchospasm and a marked enhancement of the bronchomotor response to [beta Ala8]NKA-(4-10). This latter was antagonized by the prior administration of the selective NK-2 receptor antagonist MEN 10,376. 5. Pretreatment with guanethidine or propranolol increased the airway constriction induced by [beta Ala8]NKA-(4-10). Furthermore, pretreatment with guanethidine prevented the enhancement induced by ruthenium red, showing that activation of NK-2 receptors influences the sympathetic bronchodilator drive to the airways. 6. It is concluded that ruthenium red antagonizes selectively the in vivo excitatory effect of capsaicin in guinea-pig airways. Furthermore, the additivity of the blocking action of ruthenium red and atropine indicates that two distinct mechanisms take place in bronchospastic response to i.v. capsaicin in this species."
