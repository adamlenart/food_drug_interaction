    "0": "Effect of long-term administration of propranolol was studied in 90 unselected patients with essential hypertension. At a dose of 180 and 360 mg daily it dropped the blood pressure to at least 155/95 mm Hg in 31 patients (34.4%). Those who responded to propranolol had lower systolic and diastolic blood pre-treatment pressures than those who failed, were younger by an average of eight years, and in no case had decreased plasma-renin activity and demonstrated greater plasma-renin activity after furosemide. After a titration phase with increasing doses of propranolol those who responded were treated in a crossed double-blind test with propranolol or placebo. There was a significant difference in systolic blood pressure (standing and lying) and diastolic pressure (standing) between the two. There was also a highly significant difference in heart rate. During chronic beta blockade the basal and stimulated plasma-renin activity fell. But percentage stimulation of renin secretion was fully maintained. However, aldosterone response was decreased. Serum potassium rose slightly but significantly, cAMP 24-hour urine excretion fell significantly. Electrolyte excretion did not differ between the two treatment periods.", 
    "1": "Emotional stress is conventionally considered to be associated with tachycardia and enhanced sympathetic activity. The electrocardiogram and plasma catecholamine and lipid concentrations were observed in 21 young healthy women undergoing dental procedures. Ten of these received premedication with the beta-blocking agent oxprenolol and 11 with a placebo, administered on a double-blind randomised basis. Mild tachycardia occurred in the placebo group a few minutes before and a few minutes after dentistry, but there was a reduction in heart rate immediately before and during the procedure. The pattern was similar in the group who received oxprenolol, though the heart rates at each stage were lower. Plasma adrenaline concentrations were much higher in the samples taken during the procedure than in those taken shortly before and after it. Plasma noradrenaline and lipid concentrations remained unchanged. A decrease in heart rate in the face of intense emotional arousal and an increased plasma adrenaline concentration suggest that the expectation or experience of pain may be associated with parasympathetic dominance despite greatly enhanced sympathetic activity.", 
    "2": "Serological studies in 22 patients presenting with ocular disease attributable to dosage with the beta-blocking agent practolol revealed a raised incidence of antinuclear antibodies. There was also a marginal increase in the incidence of antibodies to smooth muscle in the more severely affected individuals but the incidence of ther autoantibodies and levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM were within normal limits. Semi-quantitative analysis of tears from 14 of the patients showed absence or near absence in the more severely affected patients of secretory IgA, which is indicative of damage to the lacrimal gland. Other immunological parameters in the tears were normal.", 
    "3": "The blood vessels in the rabbit ear have been used to investigate the effects of octapressin on vascular smooth muscle. Continuous administration of this drug resulted in tachphlatis. Cocaine enhanced the response of the ear to octapressin; however, this potentiation was not evident when phentolamine was concurrently added to the perfusate. Denervation and reserpinisation of the ear also eliminated the potentiation of octapressin's response by cocaine. The results suggest that there is a small, indirect sympathomimetic component involved in octapressin's action on the vasculature.", 
    "4": "Clinical, laboratory, and pulmonary physiologic features of three fatal cases of paraquat poisoning are presented. Experimental investigations and clinical experience would suggest several possible means of modifying paraquat toxicity. The following specific therapeutic interventions, several of which had previously been applied only in experimental circumstances, were used: (1) inhibition of absorption of paraquat with Fuller's Earth and catharsis by magnesium sulfate, (2) elimination of absorbed paraquat by hemodialysis with ultrafiltration and forced diuresis, (3) competition by d-propranolol for tissue binding sites, (4) modification of direct pulmonary tissue effects of paraquat by hypoxic breathing mixtures, superoxide dismutase, and corticosteroids. Treatment was unsuccessful. However, our clinical experience and data concerning paraquat concentration in body and dialysis fluids suggest a therapeutic approach aimed at preventing early and progressive tissue damage. A combination of Fuller's Earth and magnesium sulphate should be used immediately and in frequently repeated doses to prevent absorption. Diuresis and haemodialysis should be instituted as soon as possible to increase excretion. Hypoxic atomspheres should be created urgently to produce a PaO2 of 40-45 mmHg, and the use of superoxide dismutase be further investigated. It is hoped that the high mortality of paraquat poisoning will be modified by this combined approach of early and intensive treatment.", 
    "5": "In a previous study we have shown that an isometric handgrip is accompanied by a rapid decrease in vascular resistance in the resting (contralateral) forearm, lasting for about 1 min, which in all probability is neurogenic. 2. In the present study the distribution of the vasodilatation was investigated by analysing O2 saturation in a deep vein, draining mainly muscle tissue. Some possible neurogenic mechanisms for the vasodilatation were tested by repeating the handgrip after local beta- and alpha-adrenergic blockade of the resting forearm with propranolol and phentolamine, respectively. 3. Without blockades the forearm vascular resistance decreased and the deep vein O2 saturation increase to similar degrees on contralateral handgrip. Propranolol markedly reduced both the decrease in resistance and the increase in deep vein O2 saturation. Phentolamine did not alter the initial decrease in resistance, but with phentolamine resistance continued to decrease after 1 min. 4. It is concluded that the rapid decrease in vascular resistance in the resting forearm on contralateral handgrip takes place, to a great extent, in muscle. It is mediated by neurogenic beta-adrenergic mechanisms and if the contraction is prolonged it gradually changes to a vasoconstriction mediated by alpha-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "6": "The effect of adrenaline on the membrane transport of 3-methylglucose was studied in perifused isolated rat left atria that had been fully arrested. In this preparation a high concentration of adrenaline stimulated and a low one decreased sugar transport. The stimulatory effect was strongly inhibited by the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol and by the antilipolytic agent nicotinic acid. As the atria were not beating, the effects were not mediated by changes in the rate or strength of muscular contraction. The possible mechanisms of these effects of adrenaline on sugar transport are discussed.", 
    "7": "The effects of two types of psychosocial stimuli on plasma renin activity (PRA) were studied in unanesthetized rats, blood being collected by decapitation. Thirty minutes of exposure to a novel environment (\"open field\") produced statistically significant increases of PRA in rats maintained on either a standard (1% NaCl) or sodium-free diet. No change in plasma renin substrate occurred. Prior treatment with propranolol (approximately 2 mg/kg) reduced the renin response by approximately 50% but did not completely abolish it. Plasma renin activity was also increased significantly by exposure of caged rats to the presence of a hungry cat for 30 min. We conclude that psychosocial stimuli can produce significant increases in renin secretion and that this response is mediated, at least in part, by the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "8": "2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), insulin, or norepinephrine (NE), when injected into the cerebral ventricles of conscious mice, produce decreased rates of O2 consumption and hypothermia. These changes are accompanied by hyperglycemia with 2-DG, hypoglycemia with insulin, and normoglycemia with NE. Desipramine blocks the reduction in body temperature and O2 consumption produced by each of these agents, but does not modify significantly their effects on plasma glucose. The latter suggests that the thermal and oxidative responses to central glucopenia can be dissociated from concurrent alterations in circulating glucose. Propranolol enhances the hypothermic response produced by administered 2-DG, insulin, or NE. Phentolamine, however, antagonizes the hypothermia only with NE, indicating the 2-DG and insulin are probably not acting through the release of endogenous NE.", 
    "9": "Rapid intravenous administration of a single bolus of secretin caused a marked decrease in both amplitude and frequency of rumen contractions, whereas pancreozymin administration caused a decrease in frequency but an increase in amplitude of rumen contractions. Alpha receptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine or beta receptor blockade with propranolol did not alter secretin or pancreozymin effects on rumen motility. Blockade of histamine receptor sites with tripelennamine did not prevent the secretin-induced decrease of rumen motility. A marked similarity in the decreased rumen motility pattern was observed when secretin effects were compared to aminophylline effects.", 
    "10": "At a 10(-5) to 10(-3) molar concentration range, 1-, d1- and d-propranolol were equipotent to progressively inhibit the uptake of 3H-NE into chopped rat cerebral cortex tissue. Similar concentrations of 1- and d1-, but not d-, propranolol significantly increased the amount of total deaminated catabolites (deaminated, deaminated-O-methylated) of 3H-NE; however, 10(-3) molar 1-, d1- and d-propranolol were required to increase the release of 3H-NE from rat brain in vitro.", 
    "11": "The changes of heart rate in response to i.v. administration of methylatropine (0.5 mg/kg) and/or propranolol (2 mg/Kg) or practolol (2.5 mg/Kg) were studied in conscious trained dogs. Cholinergic blockade alone or combined blockade of sympathetic and parasympathetic effector systems resulted in cardiac acceleration. Conversely, beta-adrenoceptor antagonism with either propranolol or practolol reduced heart rate. The data were analysed by means of a new method, whereby the heart (HRN) of the dog is considered to be the product of the intrinsic heart rate (HR0) and 3 further factors: HRN-HR0 times S times V times W (Multiplicative model). 2 of these factors represent the tonic sympathetic (S) and parasympathetic (V) influences, whereas the third (W) represents the sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction. This type of analysis reveals that W was approximately 1, i.e., the sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction did not play any significant role in determining the heart rate of conscious resting dogs (HRN = HRO-S-V-W = HRO-S-V). The change of heart rate due to the action of parasympathetic system (-53% of the intrinsic heart rate) was more important than the change caused by the action of the sympathetic system (26% of the intrinsic heart rate).", 
    "12": "The technique of microelectrophoresis was used in order to compare the actions of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and noradrenaline on single neurones in the cerebral cortices of cats and rats. DOPA could both excite and depress cortical neurones. Cells excited by DOPA were also excited by noradrenaline and cells depressed by DOPA were also depressed by noradrenaline. In the case of both excitatory and depressant responses, DOPA appeared to be less potent than noradrenaline. Responses to DOPA and noradrenaline could be antagonized by phentolamine and propranolol. Responses to acetylcholine were not affected. Responses to acetylcholine, but not responses to DOPA, were antagonized by atropine. The results indicate that locally applied DOPA may mimic the actions of noradrenaline on cortical neurones. Possible mechanisms for these effects of DOPA are discussed.", 
    "13": "Patients with acute anxiety-like attacks are often evaluated for various medical conditions, and, when nothing is found, their symptoms are attributed to psychogenic causes. \"beta-Adrenergic hyperactivity\" should be considered in these patients. Six patients are described who, we believe, are suffering from this condition. Low rates of isoproterenol hydrochloride infusion-precipitated symptoms that mimicked their spontaneous somatic anxiety attacks. Treatment with propranolol hydrochloride produced longterm symptomatic relief.", 
    "14": "The effects of verapamil (0.02-0.2 mg/kg) on contractility in normal and partially ischemic myocardium were compared with the changes following propranolol (0.01-1.0 mg/kg). Regional contractile function was studied in open-chest dogs with ultrasonic crystals and ischemia was controlled by graded occlusion of a carotid-to-coronary artery shunt. Reduction in shunt perfusion pressure (40-55 mm Hg) resulted in hypokinesia. Verapamil depressed contractility in ischemic myocardium in 5/5 dogs, but did not alter the maximum velocity of shortening (max V) or end-diastolic segment length in normal myocardium. Propranolol in doses sufficient to depress ischemic myocardium also depressed contractile function in normal myocardium. In two dogs without coronary occlusion, verapamil (up to 1.0 mg/kg) increased end-diastolic segment length but did not reduce max V. We conclude that verapamil selectively depresses ischemic myocardium, a finding that may have clinical implication since ischemic injury can be decreased by reducing contractility (and thereby MVO2).", 
    "15": "The goal of this study was to determine if changes in the epicardial QRS complex after coronary artery occlusion (CAO) can be used to evaluate the efficacy of interventions designed to limit infarct size. Forty-one open-chest dogs with CAO were studied: 15 were controls, 18 received hyaluronidase and eight received propranolol starting 20 minutes after CAO. Epicardial ECGs were recorded at specific time intervals to analyze ST-segment elevation and changes in Q and R waves. Transmural specimens were obtained 24 hours after CAO from the same sites at which ECGs were recorded. Q wave development (deltaQ), R wave fall (deltaR), and their combination (deltaR + deltaQ) at 24 hours correlated with the extent of necrosis, as determined by myocardial creatine phosphokinase activity depression and histologic appearance. In the control group ST-segment elevation 15 minutes after CAO (ST15M) predicted changes in Q and R waves 24 hours later; in the treated groups, the same ST15M prior to drug administration resulted in significantly less QRS changes. Thus, 1) Q wave development and R wave fall 24 hours after CAO accurately reflect myocardial necrosis. 2) ST15M predicts subsequent changes in Q and R waves. 3) The efficacy of hyaluronidase and propranolol, agents previously shown to reduce myocardial necrosis, can be detected by less Q wave development and a smaller fall in R wave voltage.", 
    "16": "The acute effects of small doses of intravenous propranolol on renin release and on circulatory dynamics were studied at the time of renal arteriography in 12 persons with essential hypertension. All of the subjects had a normal peripheral renin response to chronic sodium depletion and all had normal renal function. Seven subjects received a 10-mEq sodium diet. At the time of arteriography, arterial blood pressure, pulse rate, cardiac output, renal blood flow, and arterial and renal venous renin activity were measured before and 6-20 minutes after the intravenous administration of propranolol (9-18 mjg/kg). Average renin secretion rate in the salt-depleted subjects fell from 367 +/- 80 (SEM) U/ml per 100 g/min to 122 +/- 51 U/ml per 100 g (P=0.03) and renal plasma flow fell from 189 to 155 ml/min per 100 g (P = 0.018). We also found that in the salt-loaded subjects, renal plasma flow fell from 213 to 184 ml/min per 100 g (P = 0.025), whereas renin secretion did not change significantly in either group. We conclude that propranolol rapidly blocks renin release despite circulatory changes which ordinarily constitute a stimulus for renin secretion, i.e., renal vasoconstriction and reduced renal blood flow.", 
    "17": "The effect of ritodrine upon uterine artery blood flow (UtBF) and umbilical vein blood flow (UmBF) was investigated in near-term chronic sheep preparations. During intravenous ritodrine infusions to the ewe in sequential dose rates from 100 to 800 mug per minute, UtBF fell progressively to 43 per cent below control levels and mean maternal arterial pressure (MMAP) declined 20 per cent. During constant infusions of 100, 400, or 800 mug per minute of ritodrine to the ewe for 120 minutes,, UtBF decreased 10, 37, and 31 per cent, respectively, and MMAP decreased 6, 20 and 25 per cent respectively. Dose-related maternal tachycardia and hyperglycemia occurred. There were no significant changes in UmBF, mean fetal arterial pressure, or fetal heart rate. During all infusions, maternal and fetal arterial pH, PCO2, and PO2 remained within normal physiologic limits. Simultaneous infusion of ritodrine (400 mug per minute) and propranolol (100 mug per minute) blocked the maternal tachycardia, but decreases in UtBF, MMAP, and UmBF were observed. Ritodrine infusions to the fetus (25 mug per minute) resulted in fetal tachycardia and a variable increase in UmBF.", 
    "18": "Recent studies have suggested that propranolol decreases the extent of myocardial injury in acute ischemia. Although other studies have shown that global myocardial performance is depressed, zonal effects of propranolol in this setting are unknown. Therefore, the effect of propranolol (1.0 mg. per kilogram) was investigated in nine dogs with the use of Walton-Brodie strain gauge arches and local epicardial electrograms (10 to 12 sites). The heart rate effects of propranolol were controlled by atrial pacing. After coronary occlusion, heart rate increased slightly without a significant change in blood pressure. Following the infusion of propranolol, heart rate decreased significantly from 165.0 +/- 3.5 to 126.2 +/- 4.7 beats per minute (p less than 0.001) while both the systolic and diastolic blood pressures showed insignificant changes. After coronary occlusion, nonischemic zone tension showed no significant changes; however, propranolol decreased total tension from 105.2 +/- 2.5 per cent to 66.8 +/- 4.7 (p less than 0.001). Similarly, propranolol further decreased total tension in the border zone from 84.4 +/- 6.7 per cent (p less than .02) to 50.6 +/- 5.1 (p less than 0.01). Ischemic zone tension also fell further (p less than 0.025) after propranolol. Restoration of prepropranolol heart rate had no significant effect on tension development. Following coronary occlusion, sigmaST increased from 5.7 +/- 2.2 to 72.9 +/- 20.1 mv. (p less than 0.001). Coincident with the decrease in heart rate and tension development induced by propranolol, sigmaST decreased to 60.8 +/- 18.8 mv. (p less than 0.05). When the heart rate was restored to prepropranolol level, sigmaST again rose to 73.2 +/- 16.9 mv. (p less than .005). Thus, propranolol does effect an improvement in ischemic injury which is related, at least in part, to the induced decrease in heart rate. A concomitant substantial decrease in local tension development also occurs, however. The latter observations may limit the potential usefulness of propranolol in this setting.", 
    "19": "1. Nine subjects with severe coronary artery disease were studied during graded \"sprint\" and \"steady-state\" exercise before and after intravenous administration of the beta-receptor antagonist alprenolol. During \"sprint\" workload was increased every minute until maximum work capacity (Wmax) was reached. \"Steady-state\" exercise was performed at work rates of 0.250, 0.50, and 0.75 of each subject's sprint Wmax. Variables measured included ST-segment depression, changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory gas exchange, and arterial blood composition. Cardiac output (indirect Fick) was measured during \"steady-state\" exercise. 2. Alprenolol did not alter Wmax during \"sprint\" but reduced the incidence of angina in both types of exercise. After the drug work capacity was limited by symptoms and signs suggestive of mild left ventricular failure. 3. The relationship between workload (normalized in terms of Wmax) and ST-segment depression was curvilinear. Under control conditions a given rate of work during \"steady-state\" exercise was assocaited with more marked ST-segment depression than during \"sprint\". Alprenolol displaced the work-ST-depression curve to the right in each type of exercise; now a given rate of work produced similar ST-depressing during \"steady-state\" and \"sprint\" exercise. 4. Alprenolol attentuated the exercise tachycardia during both types of exercise. Cardiac output was lower in \"steady-state\" exercise after the drug than under control conditions. Metabolic effects included significant reduction in body oxygen consumption after alpreprenolol at 0.25 Wmax and diminished arterial lactate at 0.75 Wmax. The beneficial effects of the drug thus appeared to involve not only cardiac but peripheral effects on beta receptors. 5. Before alprenolol cardiac output was relatively fixed at all workloads, but after the drug there was a work-related rise in output in five out of nine subjects. Comparison with data in normal subjects suggested that in anginal subjects cardiac output at low \"steady-state\" workloads was inappropriately high.", 
    "20": "The authors report four new cases of hyperthyroidism associated with prolonged treatment with amiodarone. Massive doses of beta-blockers were required to deal with the severely disordered rhythm in one of the patients. Amiodarone, which is an effective treatment for angina, is not free from risk, even at the doses which are currently accepted. Hyperthyroidism, which may occur even in patients who have had no past history of any thyroid troupble at all, remains a most unusual complication.", 
    "21": "Mitotic rates in the basal layer of cells in the buccal epithelium of rat were measured using a stathmokinetic technique. Adrenaline was found to inhibit cell proliferation in this tissue and the effect of adrenaline could be blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol but not by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine nor by the specific beta2-adrenergic antagonist butoxamine. Cell proliferation in the buccal mucosa was also inhibited by terbutaline, a synthetic beta2-adrenergic agonist. The effect of terbutaline was not blocked by either butoxamine or by the specific beta1-adrenergic antagonist practolol.", 
    "22": "Unstable angina is an important symptom of coronary artery disease. Two general clinical presentations may occur: (1) stable angina with a recent increase in severity or angina of recent onset, or (2) acute coronary insufficiency or angina at rest with chest pain resembling that of acute infarction. The risk of death or infarction is greater in patients who have recurrent chest pain and ST-T wave abnormalities despite hospital treatment. In patients without electrocardiographic or serum enzyme evidence of a completed infarct, coronary arteriography and bypass graft surgery can be performed with an acceptably low mortality rate. Surgical treatment provides better symptomatic relief than medical management in many patients, but the significant incidence of perioperative infarction makes it difficult to determine if surgery prevents infarction. Some studies indicate that surgery improves survival in subgroups, but data from large scale randomized studies will be needed to answer this question securely. Patients with disease of the left main coronary artery should probably have surgical treatment. Medical treatment will relieve symptoms in most patients with unstable angina and on a long-term basis may obviate the need for surgery. A preliminary period of intensive medical treatment before surgery may be advantageous since there is little evidence that survival rates are improved by treating unstable angina as an acute surgical emergency.", 
    "23": "Placebo and propranolol (Inderal) in doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg were given in a single-blind test to two groups of six ocular hypertensives. The groups consisted of patients with an intraocular pressure ranging from 20 to 29 mmHg and 30 to 39 mmHg. The doses were given 48 hours apart and administered after fasting 12 hours. IOP by Goldmann applanation tonometer, systemic blood pressure and pulse rate in the supine position were recorded hourly before and after administration. In both groups a decrease in mean IOP was noted after one hour and this reduction reached its maximum three hours after the administration of propranolol. The absolute reduction was greater in the group with the highest initial IOP and in both groups the fall in mean IOP showed a clear dose-dependent correlation. The simultaneous mean decrease in pulse rate was also dose-correlated, but reached its maximum two hours after administration. The fall in systemic blood pressure was only moderate and showed no obvious dose-dependence.", 
    "24": "The distribution of blood pressure levels in elderly patients is described and the evidence that higher levels are associated with morbidity at this age is reviewed. In the absence of definitive evidence about the results of treating hypertension in the elderly, the physiological factors that have to be taken into account are surveyed with particular reference to aggravating cerebral ischaemia.More potent hypotensive agents should be avoided in older patients and in practice the decision on whether to treat may depend more on the clinical context than on the level of the blood pressure itself.", 
    "25": "Thirteen acutely symptomatic malignant hypertensive patients were treated with minoxidil in combination with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent and diuretics or dialysis. The degree of endorgan involvement varied, with the kidney being the most compromised in 11 of 13 patients. In 12 of 13 patients, MABP (mean arterial blood pressure) fell significantly within 72 hours, P less than 0.005. After 20 months of therapy, all have now had a favorable response, with a mean reduction in MABP of 48 mm Hg, and with no adverse cardiac disturbances. In addition, the patients with mild azotemia had an improvement in renal function as determined by a reduction in serum creatinine. PRA (peripheral renin activity) rose with the addition of minoxidil despite therapeutic concentration of serum propranolol and a reduction in MABP and heart rate. It was also noted that those patients who had been on guanethidine prior to minoxidil had a more pronounced lowering of MABP within 72 hours of minoxidil therapy. It is concluded that minoxidil is a safe, fast, and effective agent to achieve rapid and sustained control of MABP in malignant hypertensive states associated with chronic renal insufficiency.", 
    "26": "Ten patients not maximally controlled on an oxprenolo/cyclopenthiazide regimen for moderately severe hypertension were treated in a double blind crossover trial with either hydrallazine (75-150 mg/day) or phentolamine (60-120 mg/day) or placebo in addition to their other therapy. Additional phentolamine therapy did not lower blood pressure significantly when compared with placebo. Additional hydrallazine (75-150 mg/day) produced an approximate 10 mm, Hg fall in diastolic blood pressure, but no significant fall in systolic blood pressure. Pulse rates did not alter with the addition of hydrallazine or phentolamine. In patients who fail to attain optimal blood pressure response to beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs it is suggested that the addition of hydrallazine is a useful measure.", 
    "27": "The control of blood pressure achieved was similar whether pindolol or propranolol was given once or three times daily. When the drugs were ceased the antihypertensive effect lasted for longer than 24 h. There was no rebound hypertension. The full effect of the drug on blood pressure was seen within 24 h of its recommencement. Changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, and plasma renin activity occurred but these were not considered to be causally related. The response of plasma renin activity to posture was ablated when the patients were receiving beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs.", 
    "28": "Endocrine functions were investigated in a case of \"beta-adrenergic hyperdynamic circulatory state\". This state was diagnosed by (1) typical symptoms of cardiac awareness, (2) physical findings (increments of pulse rate and blood pressure by changing positions or walking), (3) increase in cardiac output (5.25 l/min leads to 14.03 l/min) and decrease in circulatory time (10.8 sec leads to 5.5 sec) by isoproterenol infusion (0.02 mug/min/kg body weight), (4) rapid loss of symptoms and above findings by propranolol treatment (30 mg per os daily) and reappearance by discontinuing medication. The mechanism of insulin response to glucose has been a controversy as to whether the secretion is transmitted by beta-receptor or independent glucose receptor. And in this physiologic beta-adrenergic state, it was found that insulin responses in IVGTT and OGTT were within normal limit. When beta-adrenergic condition was corrected by propranolol treatment, insulin responses were shown lowered, though in the normal range. This could be reproduced by discontinuing medication. Insulin, glucagon and growth hormone secretions caused by arginine were also found normal, but during the period the patient was on propranolol therapy, all responses were decreased, within the normal range. These results do not positively support the idea that glucose receptor is linked to beta-receptor. They do not either agree with the contention that secretions of insulin, glucagon and growth hormone induced by arginine are mediated through beta-receptors.", 
    "29": "In order to clarify the mechanism of the different sensitivity of the adrenoceptors between normal and hypothyroid rats, cyclic AMP levels in the liver and heart were measured after the administration of phenylephrine, isoproterenol, epinephrine and methoxamine. Cyclic AMP increased in all cases, but the extent of its increment in the heart was much less than that in the liver. Phentolamine and propranolol showed only a partial inhibition of cyclic AMP elevation by the agonists in the liver from normal and hypothyroid rat. On the other hand, propranolol blocked completely the effect of the agonists on the heart from both groups. It was also observed that cyclic AMP increased in adrenalectomized rats after the injection of the adrenergic agonists. The basal activity of protein kinase in hypothyroid status was slightly lower than that in the normal, but this enzyme was stimulated in the presence of cyclic AMP in vitro. These results suggest that the function of beta-adrenoceptor remained normal even in hypothyroidism and responded well to isoproterenol and epinephrine. It is also indicated that the increased sensitivity of alpha-adrenoceptor to phenylephrine in the hy pothyroid atria previously observed is probably in part independent of the mechanism mediated by cyclic AMP.", 
    "30": "In healthy humans glucagon infusion resulted in a significant increase in blood sugar and in plasma cyclic AMP. No discernible hemodynamic effects were found. Isoproterenol infusion on a mole per mole basis in the same subjects induced a significant, although less pronounced rise in plasma cyclic AMP, heart rate, and a fall in diastolic blood pressure but had no effect on blood sugar. Propranolol administration abolished the hemodynamic effects of isoproterenol and significantly decreased the response of plasma cyclic AMP; the same blocking dosage had little effect on plasma cyclic AMP changes induced by glucagon wheras the response in blood sugar was significantly reduced. These data in vivo are compatible with the in vitro demonstration of separate receptors for glucagon and isoproterenol.", 
    "31": "The intracellular level of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and its stimulation in vitro by norepinephrine were studied in brown and white adipocytes from rats adapted to constant or fluctuating cold. Cold acclimatization had no effect on the basal cyclic AMP intracellular content in both tissues, but the level in brown adipocytes was four-fold higher than in the white ones. Addition of norepinephrine in the incubation medium doubled the cyclic AMP content of white adipocytes from control or fluctuating-cold-adapted rats, and enhanced four-fold in constant-cold-adapted rats. In brown adipocytes norepinephrine increased cyclic AMP levels in the first two groups, but had no effects in constant-cold-adapted rats. In the two tissues of control and fluctuating-cold-adapted rats the norepinephrine action was increased by phentolamine and decreased by propranolol. The lack of response to norepinephrine of brown adipocytes from constant cold-adapted rats was not due to the predominance of the alpha component of hormone receptors. Antilipolytic drugs (nicotinic acid, insulin and prostaglandin E2) inhibited the action of norepinephrine on white adipocytes; only prostaglandin E2 had an effect on brown ones.", 
    "32": "Halothane has dual effects on lipolysis of human adipose tissue: at low tissue concentrations a stimulatory effect is found, while at higher tissue concentrations lipolysis is inhibited. The lipolytic resonse of human adipose tissue was studied in vitro with or without halothane, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline, the lipase activator dibutyryl cAMP(dbcAMP), the alpha-receptor antagonist phentolamine, the nonselective beta-receptor antagonist propranolol, and the selective beta1-receptor antagonist practolol. In the absence of beta-receptor antagonists low concentrations of halothane stimulated lipolysis, This effect was blunted by beta-receptor antagonists, indicating that halothane at low tissue concentrations may directly stimulate the beta-receptors. The inhibitory effect of higher tissue concentrations of halothane was not the result of increased alpha-receptor activity since addition of phentolamine did not inhibit this effect. High concentrations of theophylline or dbcAMP increased lipolysis in specimens exposed to halothane, but the lipolytic rate was still less than that found in specimens not exposed to halothane. The data thus indicate that the inhibitory effect of halothane is exerted at a step beyond the formation and degradation of cAMP.", 
    "33": "The mechanism by which isoproterenol and cyclic AMP inhibit organic acid transport was examined. Accumulation of 131I-Hippuran (S/M) was used as an index of organic acid transport. Propranolol, an antagonist of isoproterenol's beta-adrenergic response, not only inhibited accumulation of Hippuran but, when combined with isoproterenol, caused further inhibition. PTH elicited larger increases than isoproterenol in cortical-slice cyclic AMP content but did not inhibit accumulation of Hippuran. This lack of correlation between a positive effect on the adenylate-cyclase-cyclic AMP system and inhibition of transport was also seen when other agents were tested. Cyclic GMP, which has been postulated to work in opposition to cyclic AMP, was as potent as cyclic AMP in decreasing S/M. The decreasing of S/M by adenine and uric acid could not be related to any known effect of these agents on tissue cyclic AMP content. Similarly, although 0.1 mM theophylline significantly decreased S/M, cortical cyclic-AMP content was not increased until a 100-fold greater concentration of theophylline was employed. The data suggest that the inhibitory effect of these agents was attributable to their molecular configurations, which interact directly with the organic acid transport system rather than indirectly via the adenylate-cyclase-cyclic AMP system.", 
    "34": "Chronic effects of propranolol on plasma lipids and lipoprotein composition were examined in ten patients who had previous strokes and normal plasma lipids. Although plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol were not affected by propranolol, a slight decrease of free cholesterol and phospholipids and a significant increase of free fatty acids were observed in the eighth week of propranolol treatment. Reciprocal changes were observed in lipoprotein composition; these were an increase in lipids of very low-density lipoprotein and a decrease in lipids of both low-density and high-density lipoproteins. Postheparin lipolytic activity was significantly suppressed by the administration of propranolol. Inhibition of lipoprotein lipase by propranolol was considered to have played a role in the reciprocal changes of lipoprotein composition.", 
    "35": "Histamine depressed the contractions of dog saphenous vein strips caused by stimulation of their sympathetic nerves. This was due to a decrease in the release of norepinephrine which appears to be mediated by histamine H2-receptors. The evidence for this is as follows: (1) Contractions of the strips caused by activating the nerve endings electrically or by depolarization with potassium ions were depressed by histamine, whereas contractions caused by tyramine and norepinephrine were either unchanged or augmented. (2) Strips were incubated with norepinephrine[7-3H] and mounted for superfusion and isometric tension recording. The perfusate was collected for estimation of total radioactivity and for column chromatographic separation of norpinephrine and its metabolites. Histamine (0.9 muM) depressed the release of norepinphrine[7-3H] during contractions caused by electric stimulation, whereas the release of radioactive compounds caused by tyramine was unaffected. (3) The depression by histamine of the contractions and the efflux of radioactive compounds caused by electric stimulation were inhibited by an H2-receptor antagonist (metiamide), but were unaffected by an H1-receptor antagonist (pyrilamine). (4) Contractions caused by electric stimulation were inhibited by an H2-receptor agonist (4-methylhistamine) and augmented by an H1-receptor agonist (2-methylhistamine). These findings suggest the possibility that histamine, which is abundant in sympathetic nerves, might have a regulatory role in the release of the neurotransmitter.", 
    "36": "The relationship between altered transmembrane sodium movements and myocardial contractility was studied by opposing the action of the sodium pump with grayanotoxin I (GTX), an agent previously shown to increase resting sodium influx. GTX failed to affect Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase activity in vitro in concentrations as high as 0.1 mM. In electrically driven left atrial preparations of guinea-pig hearts, 1 mugM GTX produced a slight depolarization and appeared to decrease the upstroke velocity of the action potential, GTX (0.1-1 mugM) also produced a positive inotropic effect which developed over a 20-minute period. At higher concentrations, GTX produced arrhythmias. These effects of GTX were also observed in the presence of 10 mugM propranolol. Positive inotropic and arrhythmic effects of GTX were reversible after washout of the drug. These effects of GTX were also reversed by tetrodotoxin, an agent which has been shown to counteract the effect of GTX on sodium permeability. These data are consistent with a hypothesis that altered transmembrane sodium movement effects myocardial contractility.", 
    "37": "Release of PGE-like material has been studied on the isolated continuously-superfused cat tracheal muscle using dynamic bioassay methods. The effluent of transmural electrically-stimulated cat tracheal muscle induced a contraction when superfused over the rat stomach fundus strip. This response did not alter with atropine, methysergide, phentolamine and propranolol but was inhibited by aspirin and Sc 19220. The same myotropic activity in the effluent was found when trachea was mechanically stimulated by an additional increase in tension. The effluent from mechanically- and electrically-stimulated tracheal muscle caused a definite relaxation when superfused over a second cat tracheal muscle contracted by serotonin and pretreated with propranolol. Electrically-stimulated cat trachea itself gave a relaxant response which was blocked by propranolol but potentiated by aspirin. From these results it was concluded that both electrical and mechanical stimulation can elicit a release of PGE-like material from isolated cat tracheal muscle.", 
    "38": "The vascular action of 2,4'-dimethyl-3-piperidino-propiophenone hydrochloride (tolperisone hydrochloride), a centrally acting muscle relaxant, was investigated in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs. Tolperisone given intravenously produced a transient hypotension, tachycardia, and hyperventilation. The drug increased the femoral arterial flow, and decreased the superior mesenteric arterial flow following an initial transient increase. When injected directly into femoral and mesenteric arteries, tolperisone caused a rapid increase in both arterial flow (vasodilatation). However, femoral vessels were about 90 times as sensitive as mesenteric vessels to tolperisone. These results indicate that tolperisone shifts the blood volume from mesenteric (visceral) vessels to femoral (skeltal) ones. The femoral vasodilatation produced by i.a. tolperisone was not depressed by the pretreatment with i.a. propranolol, atropine or chlorphenylamine. Tolperisone decreased the contractile force in an isolated and cross-circulated papillary muscle. Tolperisone produced adrenaline reversal and antagonized the pressor response to noradrenaline. Moreover, femoral vasoconstriction caused by i.a. adrenaline was converted to vasodilatation and that caused by i.a. noradrenaline was depressed during an i.a. infusion of tolperisone. These results indicate that tolperisone blocks adrenergic alpha-receptors. The blocking action was rapid in onset, short-lived, and in addition, competitive.", 
    "39": "Effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents applied into the lateral ventricle were studied on the relay neuron in the rostral part of spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN) of cats. Conditioning stimulation of the locus coeruleus (LC) and sensory cortex (SC) inhibited the orthodromic spike generation in STN relay neuron without affecting the antidromic spike, as already reported, and re-confirmed herein. The LC-induced inhibition of orthodromic spike was significantly reduced by intraventricular administration of beta-blockers, MJ 1999 (5 mg) and propranolol (0.5 mg), while the SC-induced inhibition of orthodromic one was not modified by the beta-blockers. The antidromic spike in STN relay neuron per se remained unaffected by these treatments. Intraventricular administration of alpha-blockers such as phentolamine and phenoxybezamine produced no alterations of the LC- and SC-induced inhibition of orthodromic spike. As the beta-blockers produced a selective antagonism, noradrenaline originating in LC probably acts as an inhibitory transmitter on the STN relay neuron and is mediated by beta-receptor.", 
    "40": "1. The adipokinetic hormone release, which can be induced by anticholinesterases, is reduced by depleting the content of monoamines in the nervous system. 2. The participation of monoamines in the pathway of release of adipokinetic hormone is studied in vivo and in vitro. 3. A possible mechanism for anticholinesterase-induced release of this hormone involving cholinergic and aminergic transmission is postulated.", 
    "41": "Labetalol (AH5158) a new alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent was given to 12 hypertensive patients for an average of 7 months. Statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions of blood pressure both in the recumbent and standing positions were observed. Side effects were few and the absence of postural hypotension was noted.", 
    "42": "Spin-labeled analogues of dichloroisoproterenol and propranolol were synthesized. It was found that the KD's of both probes for the beta-adrenergic receptors of frog erythrocytes were about 30-fold higher than the KD's previously reported for the parent antagonists. Thus the introduction of a bulky nitroxide moiety in place of the isopropyl group on the amino nitrogen is associated with a decrease in affinity for the beta-adrenergic receptors. Nonetheless, the affinity of the spin-labeled propranolol would appear to be within a range compatible with EPR measurements.", 
    "43": "The effects of beta receptor blocking agents in various psychiatric indications have been investigated during the last decade. The results are summarised and discussed. A final judgement of the value of beta blocking agents within the complete psychopharmacological treatment is, at present, not yet possible. They appear to have a certain therapeutic effect depending on the peripheral beta receptor blockade, at least on functional psycho- and neurovegetative cardial and circulatory disturbances as well as on anxiety states, neurotic and those caused by stress, both of these presenting primarily somatic symptoms. In other cases the results, as they now stand, present some very interesting features for further investigation.", 
    "44": "dl-Propranolol (0.8-1.6 mg/kg - h for 1 h) produced a transient two- to three-fold increase in sodium excretion in nondiuretic rats infused with Pitressin and aldosterone and in water diuretic rats. Sodium excretion increased more in rats depleted of renin by chronic Doca and salt administration than in rats maintained on a low salt diet. An angiotensin inhibitor (1,sarcosine-8,valine angiotensin II) decreased sodium excretion. Therefore the natriuresis was not mediated by antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone, or renin-angiotensin. d-Propranolol did not produce a natriuresis. Prior treatment with phenoxybenzamine did not prevent the natriuretic response but chlorisondamine pretreatment did. The natriuresis is produced by beta blockade and requires post ganglionic nerve function but is independent of alpha receptors. dl-Propranolol decreased heart rate and cardiac output but systemic pressure did not fall and renal blood flow increased. This suggests a dopamine-mediated renal vasodilation and natriuresis. Haloperidol and pimozide, both dopamine blocking agents with minimal beta blocking effects, prevented the natriuretic response. We conclude that propranolol may increase sodium excretion directly by blocking beta receptors in the distal nephron and indirectly by dopamine-mediated renal vasodilation.", 
    "45": "Guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) increased 7-fold in rat pineal glands incubated in the presence of l-norepinephrine. This response consisted of two components-one was stereospecific and inhibited by alpha-adrenergic antagonists while the other was not stereospecific and not readily inhibited by antagonists. Although l-isoproterenol was more potent than l-norepinephrine it had less intrinsic activity and its action was not stereospecifc. The increase in cGMP caused by these catecholamines, unlike that of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), was dependent upon extracellular calcium. Ouabain and high levels of potassium produced a marked, calcium-dependent increase in pineal cGMP, without affecting cAMP. There was no effect of cholinergic agonists on cGMP. Surgical denervation markedly reduced the cGMP response to stimulation by l-norepinephrine, potassium, or ouabain. This was in contrast to the enhanced response of cAMP in denervated glands. The nonspecific increase in cGMP caused by l-isoproterenol, however, was not affected by denervation. These data demonstrate the existence of a calcium-dependent presynaptic mechanism for the generation of cGMP which may be mediated by an alpha-adrenergic-like receptor. In addition, the mechanisms regulating pineal cGMP appear to be physiologically distinct from those regulating cAMP.", 
    "46": "The isolated skin of Rana pipiens was found to be a suitable model for the quantitative study of chromatophore beta adrenergic receptors uninfluenced by prejunctional phenomena. Cumulative concentration-response curves for adrenergic agonists were obtained in preparations in which effective alpha adrenergic blockade had been produced with phenoxybenzamine. The beta adrenergic agonists darkened the preparation, as did melanocyte-stimulating hormone, but the maximum effects differed. The maximum of the l-isoproterenol cumulative concentration-response curve was approximately 50% less than that of melanocyte-stimulating hormone, while the maxima for l-epinephrine and l-norepinephrine were significantly less than that for isoproterenol. Microscopic examination revealed a qualitative difference: while maximal darkening produced by melanocyte-stimulating hormone was associated with maximal changes in both interspot melanophores and iridophores, maximal adrenergic-induced darkening was associated with maximal iridophore granule concentration only. No qualitative differences could be observed in the darkening caused by the three adrenergic agonists. The beta adrenergic potencies of l-norepinephrine and l-isoproterenol relative to l-epinephrine were determined by four-point bioassay. Isoproterenol was found to be 138 times as potent as epinephrine, while norepinephrine was 4 times as potent. Similarly, antagonism of isoproterenol-induced darkening of phenoxybenzamine-pretreated skin samples by the beta adrenergic blocking agents dl-propranolol, dl-sotalol, dl-practolol, l-butoxamine and d-butoxamine was studied, and their KB and pA2 values, respectively, were found to be: dl-propranolol (1.44 X 10(-8)M, 7.81); dl-sotalol (7.25 X 10(-8)M, 7.23); l-butoxamine (6.92 X 10(-6)M, 5.10); dl-practolol (1.91 X 10(-5)M, 4.96); d-butoxamine (no activity). Comparison of the potency ratios and pA2 values cited above with similar parameters obtained by other investigators in several mammalian tissues suggests that there is wide variation among beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "47": "Adenine, adenosine and three adenine nucleotides all caused relaxation of the guinea-pig trachea. The relaxation to the nucleotides was often preceded by a contraction. The response to adenosine and the nucleotides, but not adenine, was potentiated by dipyridamole. Imidazole inhibited the response to adenine alone. Propranolol has no effect on the response to any of the compounds. It is concluded that the guinea-pig trachea does not possess and a nucleotide-specific receptor as has been postulated for some other smooth muscle preparations. An alternative hypothesis postulating an adenosine-specific receptor is presented.", 
    "48": "The effect of oxprenolol administered intravenously (10 and 20 mg) and orally (20, 40, 80, and 160 mg) on plasma concentrations of the drug, resting heart rate, exercise-induced tachycardia, and arterial blood pressure was assessed as a function of time in 6 healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of oxprenolol following intravenous administration are best described as 2-compartnent open model with dose-dependent parameters. The mean (+/-SD) plasma half-life for oral doses is 1.94 +/- 0.37 and for intravenous doses is 2.31 +/- 0.64 hr. After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 90 min, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve varies linearly with the dose. Comparison of oral and intravenous data reveals the variation in bioavailabilty of orally administered oxprenolol to range from 19% to 74%. Unlike propranolol, oxprenolol does not show a saturable \"first-pass\" elimination effect. Blockade of beta-receptors occurs at plasma levels in excess of 60 ng/ml as evidenced by significant reductions in resting heart rate and exercise-induced tachycardia. Higher plasma concentrations of oxprenolol are required to lower blood pressure compared to those necessary to slow heart rate. These data suggest significant pharmacokinetic differences between oxprenolol and other beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists.", 
    "49": "Noradr\u00e9naline or isoprenaline (a beta sympathicomimetic drug) infusion in fasting awake dog provoque a rise of plasmatic FFA. This effect is abolished by administration of propranolol (beta blocking agent) but not by phentolamine (alpha blocking agent). Phentolamine potentiate the rise of FFA in response to noradrenaline but not to isoprenaline. This alpha blocking drug supress the fall of FFA induced by phenylephrine a sympathomimetic drug.", 
    "50": "Isoprenaline dose-response curves plotting increases in heart rate before and after labetalol are suggestive of competitive antagonism at beta-adrenoceptor sites. Phenylephrine dose-response curves using increases in systolic pressure before and after labetalol are suggestive of competitive antagonism at alpha-adrenoceptor sites. The ratio of alpha:beta-adrenoceptor antagonism induced by labetalol is approximately 1:3. Peak pharmacological responses after a single oral dose of labetalol (400 mg) occurred between 90-120 min after administration.", 
    "51": "1. The hyperthermic effect of intramuscular NA at 32 degrees C was abolished by propranolol but not by phentolamine preinjection. 2. The lack of hyperthermic response was at least partly due to the blocking effect of propranolol on beta-receptor mediated in heart rate. 3. After NA the respiratory rate was gradually increased in birds preinjected either with propranolol or with phentolamine.", 
    "52": "The comparative potency of two beta-blockers, propranolol and atenolol, in the inhibition of exercise tachycardia and isoproterenol-tachycardia has been studied in two groups of hypertensive patients, using oral doses which were increased weekly. A linear correlation was observed between the reduction in exercise tachycardia and the dose of each drug, up to a daily dose of propranolol 480 mg and atenolol 600 mg. Propranolol was slightly (0.7/1) more potent in decreasing maximal exercise tachycardia than atenolol when tested in low doses (below 100 mg); at higher doses (480 mg) no differences were found. However, atenolol was 10 times less potent than propranolol in blocking isoprenaline-induced tachycardia, which seems to be related to the cardioselectivity of atenolol.", 
    "53": "Electrophysiological and mechanical effects of histamine were observed in guinea-pig papillary muscle which had been depolarized and rendered inexcitable by elevation of potassium concentration in Tyrode solution to 27 mM. 1. Histamine (3 X 10(-7) to 3 X 10(-5) M) restored the action potential and tension development. The amplitude of the action potential was increased by 31.6 mV/10-fold increase in extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Nifedipine (10(-6) M) abolished the electrical and mechanical responses which had been restored by histamine (10(-5) M) but TTX (10(-5) M) did not affect them. Reduction of the extracellular Na+ concentration to one half decreased the amplitude and the maximum rate of rise of the action potential restored by histamine (10(-5) M) while the peak tension was increased and an after-contraction occurred. 2. The maximum rate of rise and the amplitude of the action potential restored by histamine (10(-5) M) decreased with increase in stimulus frequency from 0.1-1.6 Hz. The peak tension decreased and then increased. The shape of the developed tension was also changed. In the presence of caffeine (1 mM), the only effect of an increase in stimulus frequency was a decrease in peak tension but the change in the shape of developed tension did not occur. 3. The electrical and mechanical responses restored by histamine (3 X 10(-6) or 10(-5) M) were depressed by metiamide (3 X 10(-6) M) but not by diphenhydramine (10(-5) M) or bufetolol (10(-6) M). 4. The electrical response restored by histamine (10(-6) or 10(-5) M) was enhanced by papaverine (10(-5) M) and depressed by N-methylimidazole (10 mM). It is concluded that histamine may enhance the slow inward Ca2+ current mediated by histamine H2-receptors and the adenylate cyclase system in ventricular muscle and that the positive inotropic action of histamine may be attributed to these mechanisms.", 
    "54": "Adult male rats were progressively trained 5 days/weeks on a motor-driven treadmill. The training period lasted 12 weeks and consisted of 60 min/day of wind-sprints and endurance work. No significant difference in resting heart rates was observed between the control and exercise groups during week 1 (394 +/- 7 vs. 388 +/- 5). However, at week 12 the exercise group had a lower resting heart rate (359 +/- 6 vs. 331 +/- 4). Heart rates observed following saline, propranolol, atropine, and propranolol plus atropine injections were lower in the exercise group in all cases. The difference in heart rates between the control and exercise groups was 19 beats/min following propranolol plus atropine which was less than the 28 beats/min difference observed under control conditions. With atropine and then with propranolol the differences were 33 and 27 beats/min. These heart rate differences were observed without the presence of cardiac hypertrophy as assesssed from ventricle weights. Our data indicate that the bradycardia resulting from exercise training is due primarily to changes other than neural influences on the heart.", 
    "55": "Two beta-blocking agents with different properties were used to define the adrenergic component of the renin release which follows orthostasis. Five normal young subjects were tilted to 85 degrees for 30 min on four separate occasions. In two control studies the release of renin, as indicated by changes in plasma-renin activity, was highly reproducible. The effects of intravenous oxprenolol and intravenous propranolol, were then compared under the same experimental conditions. Oxprenolol attenuated the renin response in all subjects without completely abolishing it. Propranolol completely abolished the renin response. The difference in the ability of these agents to suppress renin release may be related to the presence (oxprenolol) or absence (propranolol) of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The increased rate of renin release in orthostasis seems to be mediated entirely by the adrenergic nervous system.", 
    "56": "Among the most important coronary risk factors are a diet rich in saturated fatty acids, cholesterol and calories, hypercholesterolemia, high blood pressure and excessive smoking. The typical pain can be elicited by putting a strain on the patient, e.g. climbing stairs. The disappearance of the pain after treatment with nitroglycerine is one of the most important pointers. Treatment is with nitroglycerine which, moreover, remains the drug of choice, also with nitrates such as pentaerythritol tetranitrate and with betablockers like propranolol. Favorable results have also been reported with a combination of isosorbide dinitrate and propranolol.", 
    "57": "Transient acceleration of the fetal heart rate is commonly seen in the cardiotachometer tracing of the human fetus during labor. A likely cause appeared to be partial occlusion of the umbilical cord. On the basis of this hypothesis, fetal cardiovascular responses to partial occlusion of the umbilical cord or isolated intra-abdominal portion of umbilical vein were studied in near-term pregnant baboons and rhesus monkeys prior to and following sympathetic blockade with dibenzyline and propranolol. The responses were of two types. In the well-oxygenated fetus, partial occlusion resulted in transient acceleration of heart rate and a decrease in pulse pressure. This response was abolished with dibenzyline or propranolol. In the hypoxic fetus, partial occlusion resulted in either bradycardia and hypotension or hypotension with no alteration in heart rate. Thus, transient acceleration of the fetal heart rate can be explained on the basis of a sympathetic response to diminished venous return. It would appear to be an early sign of a potential cord complication. This response will not be seen if the fetus becomes asphyxiated and hypoxic.", 
    "58": "Propranolol, prindolol, practolol and verapamil have been given orally in a fixed dose to subjects with preexcitation syndrome in a cross over study. The effect on exercise induced tachycardia, prevention of tachyarrhythmias and normalization of heart rate after exercise was investigated. Propranolol, practolol and prindolol significantly (p less than 0.01-0.05) reduced the heart rate at rest and during exercise and favourably influenced the normalization of the heart rate after exercise. The effect on effort tolerance (work done till the submaximal heart rate was reached) was significantly better after propranolol (versus prindolol and verapamil) and practolol (versus verapamil) only. Verapamil showed a consistent effect only given intravenously in paroxysmal tachycardia while in the majority of patients there was no difference between oral verapamil and placebo."
