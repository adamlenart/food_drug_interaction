Previously, we showed that prolonged NO synthase (NOS) inhibition produced severe nephrosclerosis with an increase of glomerular cell DNA fragmentation (apoptosis), glomerular ischemia and hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of the vasodilating, nonselective, NO-releasing beta-adrenoceptor blocker nipradilol on DNA fragmentation and synthesis/repair of glomerular cells in this prolonged NOS blockaded SHR. Twenty-week-old SHR were administered an NOS inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 80 mg/l in drinking water) or co-treated with the same dose of L-NAME and nipradilol (20 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks. After this treatment, expression of apoptosis was histologically examined using caspase-3, an apoptosis inducer, in addition PCNA (DNA synthesis/repair), and examination of glomerular morphometric changes, including cell number and tuft area. Nipradilol reduced blood pressure and preserved creatinine clearance reduction in L-NAME/SHR. These effects were associated with normalization of the glomerular cell apoptosis index and caspase-3 score, an increase in PCNA index, and increases in glomerular cell numbers and glomerular tuft area, resulting in a decreased glomerular injury score. Thus, in SHR administered an NOS inhibitor, nipradilol improved nephrosclerosis in association with a decrease in apoptosis and an increase in DNA synthesis/repair of glomerular cells. These findings may provide important insights into DNA repair/repair and apoptosis in nephrosclerosis.", 
    "1": "The cellular mechanisms by which hypertension enhances atherosclerosis are still not known in detail. Recently, evidence has been obtained that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of pressure-induced atherosclerosis. We examined the effects of pressure on oxidative stress in cultured human coronary smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Application of increased pressure (+100 mmHg) with He gas for 48 h increased oxidative stress of measured by flow cytometry by 71% and F2-isopretane by 77%. Increased pressure also increased the activities of phospholipase D (PLD), and particulate protein kinase C (PKC). The PLD inhibitor suramin 100 micromol/l, 1-butanol 40 mmol/l, and the PKC inhibitors chelerythrine 1 micromol/l and calphostin C 100 nmol/l and completely blocked the increase in oxidative stress induced by pressure. Carvedilol 1 micromol/l but not propranolol 1 micromol/l blocked pressure-induced increases in oxidative stress in cultured SMCs. These findings suggest that pressure increases oxidative stress and that carvedilol significantly inhibits pressure-induced increase in oxidative stress in cultured human coronary smooth muscle cells.", 
    "2": "Higher pulse pressure is associated with higher cardiovascular risk. We investigated the relationship between pulse pressure and known metabolic risk factors in hypertensive patients who had not experienced stroke or myocardial infarction. In a multicenter cross-sectional survey made in 1995, we registered 939 hypertensive patients aged > or = 50 years. Of these, 734 had never experienced stroke or myocardial infarction. We divided these 734 patients into two groups based on the value of their pulse pressures: 396 patients with a pulse pressure > or = 60 mmHg, and 338 patients with a pulse pressure<60 mmHg. The average pulse pressure value was 72 +/- 12 mmHg in the former group, and 49 +/- 8 mmHg in the latter group. The former group exhibited advanced age, a higher women-to-men ratio, lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and higher systolic and lower diastolic blood pressure. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and left ventricular hypertrophy were more frequently noticed in the former group than in the latter group. The prevalence of hyperlipidemia, however, was similar in the two groups. The association of pulse pressure with DM and low HDL cholesterol was statistically significant by multiple logistic analysis adjusted for age, sex, and other known cardiovascular risk factors. In conclusion, pulse pressure increases with advancing age. DM made a substantially larger contribution to the increase in pulse pressure than hyperlipidemia.", 
    "3": "Catheter ablation of the atrioventricular node (AVN) with radiofrequency current is closely associated with the short-term onset of a junctional rhythm. The origin of this rhythm was analyzed in Beagle dogs which were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Atrioventricular (AV) conduction block was induced first using a standard catheter ablation technique for the AVN, so that the sinus automaticity could not override the junctional ectopy during the following energy delivery. The ablation catheter was kept in the initial position and the delivery of radiofrequency energy was repeated. The pattern of ECG changes suggests that the dominant pacemaker may shift from the distal portion of the AV junctional area to the proximal portion during the energy delivery. This enhanced junctional automaticity was suppressed by the beta-blocker esmolol, but was not affected by M-antagonist atropine. Moreover, the beta-agonist isoproterenol did not induce the same type of junctional tachycardia, but the pacemaker shift was induced by the increased sympathetic tone after transient asystole by ventricular overdrive pacing or acetylcholine administration. These results suggest that proximal portion of the AV junctional area has extremely slow pacemaker activity, but responds to locally released norepinephrine with an abrupt rise and fall in rate, resulting in a typical pattern of junctional tachycardia during the ablation of the AVN.",

    "8": "ACE-inhibitors and AT, receptor antagonists play an important role in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases. The criteria of evidence-based medicine indicate that ACE-inhibitors (in appropriate combinations with other cardiovascular agents) continue to represent the treatment of first choice in chronic heart failure, post-myocardial infarction with compromised ventricular function, high cardiovascular risk, and diabetic (type 1) nephropathy. It is here that the AT1 antagonists should be used--in particular when ACE-inhibitors are not tolerated. The AT1 antagonists, Irbesartan and Losartan, are applied, at appropriately high doses, primarily in hypertensives with diabetic (type 2) nephropathy. With the current exception of chronic heart failure, no confirmed data are yet available on the value of combination treatment. The LIFE study has shown that an AT1 antagonist is superior to an established beta blocker in hypertensives with an increased risk (left-ventricular hypertrophy), in particular when diabetes mellitus is impending or already present.", 
    "9": "American women are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than from any other cause. Although hypertension is most prevalent, most deaths are attributed to coronary heart disease. Heart disease in women manifests approximately 12 to 15 years later than in men, up until menopause. Then the severity of coronary artery lesions in women accelerates until it equals or surpasses that of men by the late 70s or early 80s. Physicians can help older women reduce their risk for heart disease and stroke by managing hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and providing beta-blocker treatment when indicated after MI. Nonpharmacologic interventions may be effective as well. New guidelines for aspirin help identify women under age 80 who would benefit most from antiplatelet therapy.", 
    "10": "Beta-blockade results in rapid glucose clearance and premature fatigue during exercise. To investigate the cause of this increased glucose clearance, we studied the acute effects of propranolol on insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake during contraction in the presence of epinephrine with an isolated rat muscle preparation. Glucose uptake increased in both fast- (epitrochlearis) and slow-twitch (soleus) muscle during insulin or contraction stimulation. In the presence of 24 nM epinephrine, glucose uptake during contraction was completely suppressed when insulin was present. This suppression of glucose uptake by epinephrine was accompanied by a decrease in insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1-phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase activity. Propranolol had no direct effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake during contraction. However, epinephrine was ineffective in attenuating insulin-stimulated glucose uptake during contraction in the presence of propranolol. This ineffectiveness of epinephrine to suppress insulin-stimulated glucose uptake during contraction occurred in conjunction with its inability to completely suppress IRS-1-PI3-kinase activity. Results of this study indicate that the effectiveness of epinephrine to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake during contraction is severely diminished in muscle exposed to propranolol. Thus the increase in glucose clearance and premature fatigue associated with beta-blockade could result from the inability of epinephrine to attenuate insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake.", 
    "11": "Assessment of left ventricular (LV) function in the catheterization laboratory is important to optimize treatment decisions and guide catheter-based local therapies. NOGA electromechanical mapping was developed to assess LV contraction during catheterization; however, quantitative analysis of its \"local shortening\" (LS) algorithm and direct comparison with conventional methods are lacking. We evaluated the accuracy of NOGA-based regional and global function by examining its ability to detect pharmacologically induced changes in contractility compared with echocardiography. Ten anesthetized pigs were paced to ensure a constant heart rate throughout the experiment. Electromechanical maps of the LV and short-axis echocardiograms were obtained 1) at baseline, 2) during intravenous dobutamine, and 3) after intravenous propranolol. NOGA LS and ejection fraction (EF) consistently increased under dobutamine and decreased after propranolol. NOGA LS and NOGA and echocardiography circumferential shortening correlated highly with one another (r > 0.80), as did NOGA EF with echocardiography EF (r = 0.92), although absolute values differed somewhat. Thus NOGA-based global and regional function correlates closely with echocardiography and is sensitive to changes in contractility, but, at the upper end of the scale, LV function is underestimated.",

The BP after alpha-adrenergic blockade decreased to a greater extent in D(2)-/- than in D(2)+/+ mice. Epinephrine excretion was greater in D(2)-/- than in D(2)+/+ mice and adrenalectomy decreased blood pressure to a greater extent in D(2)-/- than in D(2)+/+ mice. The non specific endothelin B (ETB) blocker (BQ788) decreased BP in D(2)-/- but had not in D(2)+/+ mice. The ETB1 blocker RES 701 - 1 increased BP in D(2)-/- but not D(2)+/+ mice. ET-1 and the ETB agonist, sarafatoxin S6c increased BP to a greater extent in D(2)+/+ than in D(2)-/- mice. Circulating ET-like immunoreactive peptides were similar in D(2)-/- and D(2)+/+ mice but ETB receptor expression was greater in D(2)-/- than in D(2)+/+ mice.

After the monitoring devices had been positioned, vancomycin (15 mg/kg) was continuously infused at a constant rate over 30 min, before induction of anaesthesia. Haemodynamic profiles were recorded before vancomycin infusion (time point 1); at 15 (time point 2) and 30 min (time point 3) after the beginning of vancomycin infusion; and 15 min after vancomycin infusion had been stopped (time point 4). At each time arterial and mixed venous blood samples were drawn to calculate the shunt fraction (Qsp/Qt).",

Those changes were observed only in patients not treated with a beta-blocker before surgery, whereas no change occurred in patients treated with the drug. In the patients who were free from pruritus (group B, n = 28), we did not observe any significant change.",

Connectivity indices, of order 1 and 2, including simple, valence, and differential terms, are evaluated. The derivation of a recently proposed topological descriptor, the eccentric adjacency index, from the adjacency and distance matrices, is presented. The corresponding valence term, a novel descriptor, is developed, and other indices related to the distance matrix, the Wiener and Hyper-Wiener terms, are included. A high degree of linear correlation between the connectivity indices is noted. The correlations for first-order terms are slightly superior to the corresponding second-order values. This is particularly true when considering the valence terms compared with the nonvalence terms. The relationship between these terms and reported pharmacological properties are investigated. A decrease in the eccentric adjacency index resulted in an increase in the pharmacological property.",

These clinical findings are identical to those attributed to the membrane-stabilizing activity of propranolol and other lipophilic beta-blockers. It is commonly believed that hydrophilic agents such as atenolol lack this activity. A review of the literature reveals that hydrophilic beta-blockers may have membrane-stabilizing activity, though much higher concentrations are required to produce this action in comparison with lipophilic agents. This case and a review of the literature provides a potential pathophysiological basis for atenolol-induced haemodynamic depression.",

It is important to assess whether beta AR antagonists might protect the heart and improve ventricular function in this scenario. The authors therefore used esmolol (an ultra-short-acting beta AR antagonist) to determine whether beta AR antagonist treatment improves left ventricular function in a canine model of acute reversible coronary ischemia followed by coronary reperfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The authors also tested whether the mechanism includes preserved beta AR signaling.",

Fifteen mature mongrel dogs (7-15 kg) of both sexes were used in these experiments. Eight dogs served as controls, and seven dogs served as iatrogenic mitral regurgitation (MR) experimental animals. Carvedilol (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/kg, P.O.) was administered, and the blood carvedilol concentration was analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The response to isoproterenol or phenylephrine was also evaluated. Isoproterenol (0.025 microg/kg/min) was infused via the saphenous vein for 5 min, and phenylephrine (5 microg/kg) was injected with carvedilol (0.2, 0.4 mg/kg) or placebo for 4 days. The heart rate and arterial blood pressure were measured, and LV fractional shortening was measured by echocardiography. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured by intravenous infusion of sodium thiosulfate and sodium para-aminohippurate. Carvedilol (0.2 mg/kg) decreased the heart rate, whereas renal function, arterial blood pressure, and left ventricular contractile function were not affected. Carvedilol (0.4 mg/kg) decreased heart rate, blood pressure, and renal function. The tachycardic response to isoproterenol was significantly diminished for 36 hr by 0.4 mg/kg carvedilol. Carvedilol 0.2 mg/kg inhibited this effect for 24 hr. Thus, it is necessary to titrate the dosage of carvedilol, it should be initiated at less than 0.2 mg/kg and titrated up to 0.4 mg/kg for heart failure dogs.", 
    "31": "Chest pain is a hallmark symptom in patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP). However, little is known regarding the prevalence of an atypical presentation among these patients and its relation to subsequent care. We examined the medical records of 4,167 randomly sampled Medicare patients hospitalized with unstable angina at 22 Alabama hospitals between 1993 and 1999. We defined typical presentation as (1) chest pain located substernally in the left or right chest, or (2) chest pain characterized as squeezing, tightness, aching, crushing, arm discomfort, dullness, fullness, heaviness, pressure, or pain aggravated by exercise or relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. Atypical presentation was defined as confirmed UAP without typical presentation. Among patients with confirmed UAP, 51.7% had atypical presentations. The most frequent symptoms associated with atypical presentation were dyspnea (69.4%), nausea (37.7%), diaphoresis (25.2%), syncope (10.6%), or pain in the arms (11.5%), epigastrium (8.1%), shoulder (7.4%), or neck (5.9%). Independent predictors of atypical presentation for patients with UAP were older age (odds ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.17/decade), history of dementia (odds ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 2.03), and absence of prior myocardial infarction, hypercholesterolemia, or family history of heart disease. Patients with atypical presentation received aspirin, heparin, and beta-blocker therapy less aggressively, but there was no difference in mortality. Thus, over half of Medicare patients with confirmed UAP had \"atypical\" presentations. National educational initiatives may need to redefine the classic presentation of UAP to include atypical presentations to ensure appropriate quality of care.", 
    "32": "The risk of cardiac events in patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery is dependent on their clinical characteristics and the results of stress testing. The purpose of this study was to develop a composite approach to defining levels of risk and to examine whether different approaches to prophylaxis influenced this prediction of outcome. One hundred forty-five consecutive patients (aged 68 +/- 9 years, 79 men) with >1 clinical risk variable were studied with standard dobutamine-atropine stress echo before major noncardiac surgery. Risk levels were stratified according to the presence of ischemia (new or worsening wall motion abnormality), ischemic threshold (heart rate at development of ischemia), and number of clinical risk variables. Patients were followed for perioperative events (during hospital admission) and death or infarction over the subsequent 16 +/- 10 months. Ten perioperative events occurred in 105 patients who proceeded to surgery (10%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5% to 17%), 40 being cancelled because of cardiac or other risk. No ischemia was identified in 56 patients, 1 of whom (1.8%) had a perioperative infarction. Of the 49 patients with ischemia, 22 (45%) had 1 or 2 clinical risk factors; 2 (9%, 95% CI 1% to 29%) had events. Another 15 patients had a high ischemic threshold and 3 or 4 risk factors; 3 (20%, 95% CI 4% to 48%) had events. Twelve patients had a low ischemic threshold and 3 or 4 risk factors; 4 (33%, 95% CI 10% to 65%) had events. Preoperative myocardial revascularization was performed in only 3 patients, none of whom had events. Perioperative and long-term events occurred despite the use of beta blockers; 7 of 41 beta blocker-treated patients had a perioperative event (17%, 95% CI 7% to 32%); these treated patients were at higher anticipated risk than untreated patients (20 +/- 24% vs 10 +/- 19%, p = 0.02). The total event rate over late follow-up was 13%, and was predicted by dobutamine-atropine stress echo results and heart rate response.",

    "34": "We prospectively carried out echocardiographic examinations with IB analysis in 43 patients with DCM (31 males, 12 females) under the standard treatment. IB analysis was performed in the left ventricular wall and the calibrated (subtracting pericardial data) myocardial IB intensity (IBI) was obtained from the interventricular septum and the left ventricular posterior wall. After the follow-up (8-39 months), 31 followed a good clinical course, but eight had cardiac death, one had partial left ventriculectomy for uncontrolled heart failure and three were hospitalized for worsening heart failure. Beta-blocker responded in 27 (87%) of the 31 with good clinical course, but it did not respond in 11 among the 12 with poor course. In these 12 DCM, left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) was lower (good: 18+/-5%, poor: 14+/-4, P<0.03) and calibrated IBI was higher in both the septum (good: -16.4+/-5.6 dB, poor: -11.1+/-4.2 dB, P<0.006) and the posterior wall (good: -19.5+/-3.6 dB, poor: -13.8+/-5.6 dB, P<0.004). On the Cox proportional hazard model analysis, only calibrated IBI in the septum >-17 dB, the cut-off score of calibrated IBI discriminating non-responders to beta-blocker therapy in our previous report, was related to the poor outcome (chi(2)=4.43, P=0.035). The stepwise multivariate analysis revealed that both calibrated IBI in the septum>-17 dB (chi(2)=4.43, P=0.035) and LVFS<15% (chi(2)=3.89, P=0.049) were useful to predict the poor clinical outcome. The event free rate assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method was also significantly reduced in patients with calibrated IBI in the septum >-17 dB (chi(2)=6.594, P=0.01) and calibrated IBI in the posterior wall>-17 dB (chi(2)=4.215, P=0.04). However, LVFS<15% (chi(2)=3.576, not significant) did not contribute to discriminating the event free rate in the clinical course.",

    "37": "In animal (pig) experiments, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine have a specific inhibitory effect on SO contractility, which raises the possibility that the lack of this prorelaxing effect in hypothyroidism could, at least in part, explain the increased prevalence of CBDS. The aims of the present study were to investigate, whether human SO reacts similarly to T4, and to study the mechanisms of the T4 prorelaxing effect.", 
    "38": "We found that T4 had similar inhibitory effects on both human and pig SO contractions. The T4 effect was dose-dependent, and maximum was observed in 30 min. The maximal prorelaxing effect was achieved with 0.1 nM T4 concentration, the effect of the physiological T4 concentration (0.01 nM) being about half of the maximal effect. Addition of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, nitric oxide (NO)-synthesis inhibitor L-NAME, nerve conductance blocker tetrodotoxin, or cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac did not affect the T4-induced inhibition of contraction. Addition of transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or translation inhibitor cyclophosphamide partially reversed the T4-induced inhibition of contraction. Addition of K+ channel blocker glibenclamide totally reversed the T4-induced inhibition of contraction. In Western blotting, the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) antibody recognized 53 kDa and 58 kDa proteins, corresponding to beta1 and beta2 isoforms of TR, in the human SO tissue.",

Maternal and fetal gestational age ranged from 20-38 years and 28-41 weeks, respectively. Blood was collected from the umbilical cord vein and from the mother from zero to 12 h after drug administration. Urine was collected for 12 h after rac-pindolol administration at the following intervals: 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, and 9-12 h. Plasma and urine concentrations of the pindolol enantiomers were determined by HPLC using a Chiralpak AD chiral column and fluorescence detection. The data were fitted to a one-compartment model and differences between (+)-R and (-)-S enantiomers were compared by the paired t-test (P < 0.05). Mean results are reported. The disposition of pindolol in maternal plasma was stereoselective, with higher AUC(SS)0-12 (84.34 vs. 95.69 ng.h/ml) and Cl(R) values (9.16 vs. 10.85 L/h) and lower Vd/f (251.38 vs. 225.17 L) and Cl/f (62.48 vs. 55.74 L/h) for the (+)-R pindolol. The transplacental distribution of pindolol was not stereoselective.

During pacing, SR(sys) and CI remained unchanged in the AP and EI groups. During DI, epsilon(sys) and SV initially increased (5 microg. kg(-1). min(-1); epsilon(sys) = 77 +/- 6%, P < 0.01) and then progressively returned to baseline. During EI, SV and epsilon(sys) decreased (epsilon(sys) = 38 +/- 2%, P < 0.001). Pacing also decreased SV and epsilon(sys) in the AP (180 beats/min; epsilon(sys) = 36 +/- 2%, P < 0.001) and EI groups (180 beats/min; epsilon(sys) = 25 +/- 3%, P < 0.001). Thus, for normal myocardium, SR(sys) reflects regional contractile function (being relatively independent of HR), whereas epsilon(sys) reflects changes in SV.", 
    "42": "We investigated the effect of muscle metaboreflex activation on left circumflex coronary blood flow (CBF) and vascular conductance (CVC) in conscious, chronically instrumented dogs during treadmill exercise ranging from mild to severe workloads. Metaboreflex responses were also observed during mild exercise with constant heart rate (HR) of 225 beats/min and beta(1)-adrenergic receptor blockade to attenuate the substantial reflex increases in cardiac work. The muscle metaboreflex was activated via graded partial occlusion of hindlimb blood flow. During mild exercise, with muscle metaboreflex activation, hindlimb ischemia elicited significant reflex increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP), HR, and cardiac output (CO) (+39.0 +/- 5.2 mmHg, +29.9 +/- 7.7 beats/min, and +2.0 +/- 0.4 l/min, respectively; all changes, P < 0.05). CBF increased from 51.9 +/- 4.3 to 88.5 +/- 6.6 ml/min, (P < 0.05), whereas no significant change in CVC occurred (0.56 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.05 ml. min(-1). mmHg(-1); P > 0.05). Similar responses were observed during moderate exercise. In contrast, with metaboreflex activation during severe exercise, no further increases in CO or HR occurred, the increases in MAP and CBF were attenuated, and a significant reduction in CVC was observed (1.00 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.90 +/- 0.13 ml. min(-1). mmHg(-1); P < 0.05). Similarly, when the metaboreflex was activated during mild exercise with the rise in cardiac work lessened (via constant HR and beta(1)-blockade), no increase in CO occurred, the MAP and CBF responses were attenuated (+15.6 +/- 4.5 mmHg, +8.3 +/- 2 ml/min), and CVC significantly decreased from 0.63 +/- 0.11 to 0.53 +/- 0.10 ml. min(-1). mmHg(-1). We conclude that the muscle metaboreflex induced increases in sympathetic nerve activity to the heart functionally vasoconstricts the coronary vasculature.", 
    "43": "A direct and simple procedure for the determination of 4-methylpropranolol, a specific beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, in biological fluids was developed. The method was based on the measurement of the nonprotected fluid room-temperature phosphorescence of the drug. This technique enables us to determine analytes in complex matrices without the need for a tedious prior separation process. The appropriate experimental conditions to obtain suitable reproducibility and maximum phosphorescence signal, when sodium sulfite is used to eliminate the oxygen from the solution and when potassium iodide is used as heavy atom, were studied. The optimum concentration of KI was 3.2 M. The optimization of Na(2)SO(3) (7.0 x 10(-3) M) and the accurate value of pH (10.88) were determined using a simplex as the method of optimization. A sodium carbonate-hydrogen carbonate buffer solution (5.0 x 10(-2) M) was used to adjust the value of pH. The delay time (124 micros), gate time (206 micros), and time between flashes (5 ms) were also optimized using a simplex. Under the above conditions, the maximum signal of phosphorescence appears instantly once the sample has been prepared, and the intensity was measured at lambda(ex) = 300 nm and lambda(em) = 537 nm, in the concentration range 25-500 ng/ml. Overall least-squares regression was used to find the straight line that fit the experimental data. The detection limit according to the error propagation theory was 6.2 ng/ml and the detection limit calculated as proposed by C. A. Clayton et al. (1987, Anal. Chem. 59, 2506) was 11.7 ng/ml. The repeatability was studied using 10 solutions of 200 ng/ml 4-methylpropranolol; if error propagation theory was assumed, the relative error was 1.78% and the standard deviation for replicate samples was 3.5 ng/ml. This method was successfully applied to the determination of 4-methylpropranolol in urine, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, with recoveries of 99.3 +/- 0.5% in the case of urine, 99.8 +/- 0.2% for serum, and 101.5 +/- 1.5% for cerebrospinal fluid.", 
    "44": "Until now the relation between advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and vascular lesion is still controversial. However, the interaction of the former with a receptor triggers the synthesis of cytokines particularly interleukin 1- beta(IL-1 beta) and tumour necrosis factor- alpha(TNFalpha ). Subsequent release of nitric oxide (NO) may in turn induce certain damage to beta cell islets. Several arguments indicated that AGEs and reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) could alter the function of the vessel wall. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of aminoguanidine, AG (inhibitor of AGE formation) joined with omega -3-fatty acids, omega 3FAs (anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive drug) in STZ diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in 48 female albino Wistar rats by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg kg (-1)). Diabetic animals were treated with AG (50 mg kg(-1) ) and/or omega 3FAs (12 mg kg (-1)) daily and orally for 4 weeks. Groups of age matched diabetic rats ( n= 10) and healthy animals ( n= 10) served as positive and negative controls. At the end of the study, plasma glucose, fructosamine, total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), the susceptibility of LDL to copper-catalysed oxidation, catalase activity, NO, IL-1 beta, TNF alpha were measured. Histopathological assessment of pancreatic slices were also determined. Diabetes remarkably increased plasma glucose, fructosamine and dyslipidaemia (increased TC, LDLC and decreased HDLC). Oxidative markers like oxidative susceptibility of LDL, catalase activity and NO levels were greatly enhanced. Finally, it increased the synthesis and release of cytokine (IL-1beta and TNF alpha). Treatment of diabetic rats with AG and omega 3FAs markedly reduced the above mentioned parameters. Combined form therapy has a better effect regarding oxidative cell markers, specifically NO level. Finally, omega 3FAs coadministration with AG nearly restored the atrophy of islets of Langerhan's and the peripheral lymphocytic infiltration compared to diabetic and AG treated groups. In conclusion, there is a direct correlation between glycation, oxidative stress and cytokine production with increased propensity of microvascular disorder in STZ diabetic rats. omega 3FA administration with AGE receptor blocker may represent a possible avenue of research for therapeutics directed for alleviating the complication associated with diabetes.", 
    "45": "1 Originally, the so-called 'adrenaline hypothesis' related the release of noradrenaline (NA) to stimulation of presynaptic beta2-receptors in nerve endings; now it confers a possible role to adrenaline taken up then released by nerves endings. It represents a potentially useful therapeutic pathway. The present study aims to investigate the effects of formoterol, a highly selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonist. 2 It was carried out in freely moving rats, the isotope dilution technique being used to measure the NA spill over rate (NA-SOR) and metabolic clearance rate (MCR). 3 A series of three results are reported. (a) When compared with adrenaline on equimolar basis, formoterol (2.3 micro kg-1 min-1) increased NA-SOR while mean arterial blood pressure was decreased and heart rate increased. Thus, it was difficult to separate a direct presynaptic effect from indirect baroreflex-dependent activation of the sympathetic system. (b) When formoterol was infused at 1 ng kg-1 min-1, a dose empirically defined to induce no haemodynamic effect, NA-SOR was significantly increased, while NA-MCR remained unchanged. (c) The NA-SOR response to formoterol was not amplified by the presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptor blocker, yohimbine, in contrast to the NA-SOR response to adrenaline. 4 In conclusion, formoterol, a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist, is shown to increase the release and plasma concentration of NA while its clearance was not changed.", 
    "46": "The clinical implications of the recently revised criteria for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes are unknown.", 
    "47": "To evaluate the prognostic implications of the new diagnostic criteria for AMI, we studied 493 consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes admitted to University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, between May 1, 1999, and January 1, 2000. Patients with positive cardiac enzymes and symptoms suggestive of coronary ischemia (n = 275) were divided into 2 groups: group A, with elevated peak creatine kinase-MB fraction and/or new electrocardiographic changes suggestive of AMI regardless of troponin status (diagnosed as AMI by old criteria), and group B, with normal peak creatine kinase-MB fraction but elevated troponin I level (additional patients diagnosed as having AMI by new criteria).", 
    "48": "As compared with group A (n = 224), patients in group B (n = 51) were older women, with increased comorbidities such as previous stroke or aortic stenosis, and had fewer in-hospital procedures. In-hospital adverse events (reinfarction, heart failure, shock, and mortality) were similar between the groups, whereas 6-month mortality was higher among group B patients (16.3% vs 5.8%; P =.03). This difference was not statistically significant after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics between the groups (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-5.9).", 
    "49": "The new criteria result in a substantial increase in the diagnosis of AMI. Furthermore, they help to identify patients with acute coronary syndromes who have greater comorbidities and worse 6-month outcomes who are otherwise missed by the old criteria. Additional studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings and to determine the financial implications of the new criteria.", 
    "50": "Most patients with cardiopulmonary disease are predisposed to develop perioperative arrhythmias with the individual patient risk depending upon the type of operative procedure performed, the risk profile of the patient, and the complexity of the post-operative course. There are several management options that may tend to prevent perioperative arrhythmias that should be considered in certain patient subsets. Most important of these is the use of beta-blocker therapy before and after operation in patients with coronary risks factors undergoing non-cardiac thoracic procedures and in patients having coronary artery bypass grafting. The common supraventricular arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and flutter, multifocal atrial tachycardia, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia must be properly diagnosed and treated appropriately. Placement of atrial pacing wires for use after open cardiac surgery is of great value both for diagnosis, and in some cases, for treatment of arrhythmias. Fortunately, serious life threatening ventricular arrhythmias occurs less commonly but the clinician must recognize and correct important predisposing factors and know how to treat these when they occur. A specific protocol for arrhythmia management that sets guidelines for drug choice and therapies for each of the common arrhythmias is useful for clinicians and adds predictability to patient care.", 
    "51": "Intracarotid infusions of l-phenylephrine at 1.0 nmol.kg(-1).min(-1) or(.)10 nmol.kg(-1).min(-1) were accompanied by increases in salivary protein, urea, magnesium and bicarbonate, and by decreases in osmolality, hydrogen ion activity, sodium, potassium and chloride relative to cholinergically stimulated saliva. Intravenous infusions of phenylephrine at the same dose rates had much less effect on salivary composition with the differences between the routes of administration being greatest for the higher dose rate. Propranolol administered with phenylephrine via the carotid artery, at an antagonist:agonist ratio of 10:1, was much more effective in blocking the phenylephrine-induced changes in salivary composition than equimolar infusion of phentolamine with phenylephrine. Simultaneous intracarotid infusions of either a beta(1)-antagonist (CGP20712A) or a beta(2)-antagonist (ICI118551) with phenylephrine showed that ICI118551 was more potent than CGP20712A at preventing the changes in salivary composition associated with phenylephrine administration. It was concluded that alpha(1)-adrenoreceptors were not present in functionally significant numbers in the gland and that the effect of phenylephrine on the kangaroo mandibular was mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors predominantly of the beta(2)-subtype. As the phenylephrine dose rates in the kangaroos were comparable with those used to determine alpha-adrenergic responses of eutherian salivary glands and as both propranolol and phentolamine appeared to have minor beta-sympathomimetic activity, at least one subtype of beta-adrenoreceptors in macropods may not be identical to its eutherian counterpart.", 
    "52": "The effect of noradrenaline on the volume-sensitive chloride current (I(Cl(swell))) was studied with conventional whole-cell recording techniques in freshly dispersed isolated smooth muscle cells of the rabbit portal vein. In the absence of receptor antagonists, noradrenaline produced an increase in the amplitude of I(Cl(swell)) in some cells and a decrease in others. In the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, noradrenaline increased I(Cl(swell)) and in the presence of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, noradrenaline reduced I(Cl(swell).) The phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 reduced the amplitude of I(Cl(swell)) whereas the inactive analogue U73343 had no effect. The phorbol esters phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) increased the amplitude of I(Cl(swell)) by approximately 60 and 100 %, respectively, in a voltage-independent fashion. Inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) chelerythrine and calphostin-C decreased the amplitude of I(Cl(swell)) in a concentration-dependent but voltage-independent manner. Bath application of 8-Br-cAMP decreased I(Cl(swell)) by about 60 % whereas the inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA) KT5720 increased the amplitude of I(Cl(swell)) by approximately 80-90 %. In the presence of propranolol, chelerythrine prevented the increase of I(Cl(swell)) by noradrenaline; in the presence of prazosin, KT5720 blocked the inhibitory action of noradrenaline. The results show that in rabbit portal vein myocytes noradrenaline enhances I(Cl(swell)) by acting on alpha(1)-adrenoceptors and reduces I(Cl(swell)) by stimulating beta-adrenoceptors. The data suggest that the potentiating and inhibitory effects of noradrenaline are mediated, respectively, by PKC and PKA.", 
    "53": "Ghrelin is a novel 28-amino acid gut-brain peptide, which was first isolated in the rat stomach. This study examined the effect of ghrelin on insulin secretion from the isolated pancreas of normal and diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by a single dose of streptozotocin. Four weeks after the induction of diabetes, pancreatic tissue fragments of normal and diabetic rats were treated with different concentrations (10(-12), 10(-9) and 10(-6) M) of ghrelin. Ghrelin evoked large and significant increases in insulin secretion from the pancreas of both normal and diabetic rats. In the pancreas of normal rats, diltiazem (calcium channel antagonist) or a combination of atropine (muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist), propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist) and yohimbine (alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) significantly reduced the stimulatory effect of ghrelin on insulin secretion. Diltiazem and yohimbine failed to inhibit ghrelin-evoked insulin release in diabetic rat pancreas. Ghrelin-immunoreactivity cells was observed in 2.6% and 3.8% of the total cell population in the islet of Langerhans of normal and diabetic rats, respectively.", 
    "54": "Effects of melatonin on both thermoregulatory responses and hypothalamic serotonin release were assessed in unanesthetized rats at three different ambient temperatures (Ta). Systemic administration of melatonin (30-120 mg/kg, i.p) caused a decrease in both colonic temperature and hypothalamic serotonin (5-HT) release in rats at both Ta 8 and 22 degrees C. The hypothermia was brought about by a decrease in metabolic rate at Ta 8 degrees C, whereas at Ta 22 degrees C the hypothermia was produced by both a decrease in metabolic rate and an increase in cutaneous temperature. However, in the heat (Ta 31 degrees C), neither thermoregulatory responses nor hypothalamic 5-HT release was affected by the same amount of administered melatonin. The melatonin-induced hypothermia and decreased 5-HT release in the hypothalamus were attenuated by selective depletion of brain 5-HT produced by intracerebroventricular injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. Furthermore, the melatonin-induced hypothermia was almost completely abolished by treatment with a 5-HT2A receptor agonist (DOI) or a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist [(-)-pindolol]. The data indicate that melatonin potentiates the 5-HT1A receptor activation in the hypothalamus and results in hypothermic effects which can be antagonized by the expected hyperthermic effect of DOI.", 
    "55": "This article has three purposes: 1) to summarize recent findings of the Syst-Eur Trial; 2) to provide a short overview of the large trials in hypertension that have compared older with newer drug classes; and 3) to update the results of a meta-regression analysis that addressed the question of: to what extent blood pressure (BP) lowering can explain the findings of recent outcome trials in hypertensive patients or high-risk patients with normotension or hypertension. The Syst-Eur trial showed that in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, drug treatment starting with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker reduced the risk of stroke and of all cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, this treatment regimen improved the prognosis of diabetic patients; reduced the incidence of proteinuria; and prevented dementia, in particular Alzheimer's disease. The pooled evidence from nine recently published actively controlled outcome trials involving 62,605 hypertensive patients proved that calcium channel blockers have the same long-term efficacy and safety as the older drug classes. Compared with diuretics and beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers may offer greater protection against stroke and less protection against myocardial infarction, resulting in similar overall cardiovascular benefit. A meta-regression analysis including 30 trials and 149,407 hypertensive or high-risk patients showed that BP gradients largely accounted for most-if not all-of the differences in outcome. These findings emphasize the desirability of tight BP control. The hypothesis that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or alpha-blockers might influence outcome beyond their BP lowering-effects was not confirmed.", 
    "56": "Nicotine is a potent stimulus for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Systemic nicotine acts via central mechanisms to stimulate by multiple pathways the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary corticotrops and corticosterone from the adrenal cortex. Nicotine may stimulate indirectly the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, the site of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons which activates ACTH release. In the present studies an involvement of adrenergic system and prostaglandins synthesized by constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX-1) and inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) in the nicotine-induced HPA response in rats was investigated. Nicotine (2.5-5 mg/kg i.p.) significantly increased plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels measured 1 hr after administration. Adrenergic receptor antagonists or COX inhibitors were injected i.p. 15 min prior to nicotine and the rats were decapitated 1 hr after the last injection. Prazosin (0.01-0.1 mg/kg), an alpha1-adrenergic antagonist, significantly decreased the nicotine-evoked ACTH and corticosterone secretion. Yohimbine (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), an alpha2-adrenergic antagonist, moderately diminished ACTH response, and propranolol (0.1-10 mg/kg), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, did not significantly alter the nicotine-induced hormones secretion. Pretreatment with piroxicam (0.2-2.0 mg/kg), a COX-1 inhibitor, considerably impaired the nicotine-induced ACTH and corticosterone secretion. Compound NS-398 (0.2-5.0 mg/kg), a selective COX-2 blocker did not markedly alter these hormones secretion, and indomethacin (2 mg/kg), a non-selective COX inhibitor significantly diminished ACTH response. These results indicate that systemic nicotine stimulates the HPA axis indirectly, and both adrenergic system and prostaglandins are significantly involved in this stimulation. Noradrenaline, stimulating postsynaptic alpha1-adrenergic receptors, and prostaglandins, synthesized by COX-1 isoenzyme, are of crucial significance in the nicotine-induced ACTH and corticosterone secretion.", 
    "57": "Though the mechanisms for the vascular actions of vasodilatory beta-blockers are mostly determined, some of their interactions with monoaminergic systems are not elucidated. Because there are evidences supporting a possible involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in the actions of beta-blockers, we studied the effect of propranolol on peripheral serotonergic mechanisms in normotensive and Goldblatt two-kidney - one clip (2K1C) hypertensive rats. In both groups of animals propranolol decreased systolic blood pressure, significantly increased whole blood serotonin concentration and at the same time it decreased platelet serotonin level. The uptake of the amine by platelets from hypertensive animals was lower than that of normotensive animals and it was decreased by propranolol only in the latter. In both groups propranolol inhibited potentiation of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by serotonin. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that propranolol modifies platelet serotonergic mechanisms in normotensive and renal hypertensive rats.", 
    "58": "Beta-blockers are the most frequently used drugs for the treatment of hypertension. Apart from concerns regarding potential adverse metabolic effects on lipids or insulin sensitivity, beta-blockers can also cause weight gain in some patients. This fact appears little known to clinical practitioners and trialists. Thus, only a minority of clinical trials with beta-blockers report weight changes during treatment. In trials that do report weight changes, beta-blockers are associated with a weight gain of 1.2 (range -0.4-3.5) kg. This may be attributable to the fact that beta blockade can decrease metabolic rate by 10%. Beta-blockers may also have other negative effects on energy metabolism. Obesity management in overweight hypertensive patients may therefore be more difficult in the presence of beta-blocker treatment. We therefore question the use of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for overweight or obese patients with uncomplicated hypertension.",

Patients receiving the fast load amiodarone regimen had significant reductions in the risk of AF lasting more than 24 hours (52.6%; p = 0.038) and symptomatic AF (65.0%; p = 0.024), but the incidence of any AF or any recurrence of AF only showed a trend toward significance (34.0% and 45.5%; p = 0.054 and 0.09, respectively).", 
    "62": "Oral amiodarone in a slow loading regimen provides significant suppression of all AF factors and can be used when a patient has started it at least 5 days before OHS. If a patient has less than 5 days before OHS, the fast loading regimen is an efficacious alternative as it provides significant benefits in preventing AF from lasting more than 24 hours and for preventing symptomatic AF. Both regimens were well tolerated and safe in elderly patients receiving beta blockade according to the hospital's standard protocol.", 
    "63": "Listeriolysin O (LLO) and a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) are known virulence factors of Listeria monocytogenes in both tissue cultures and the murine model of infection. LLO is a member of a family of pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytotoxins and is known to play an essential role in escape from the primary phagocytic vacuole of macrophages. PI-PLC plays an accessory role, in that PI-PLC mutants are partially defective in escape. We have shown that both of these molecules are essential for initiating rapid increases in the calcium level in the J774 murine macrophage cell line (S. J. Wadsworth and H. Goldfine, Infect. Immun. 67:1770-1778, 1999). Here we show that both LLO and PI-PLC are required for translocation of protein kinase C delta (PKC delta) to the periphery of J774 cells and for translocation of PKC beta II to early endosomes beginning within the first minute after addition of bacteria to the culture medium. Treatment with the calcium channel blocker SK&F 96365 inhibited translocation of PKC beta II but not PKC delta. Our findings lead us to propose a host signaling pathway requiring LLO and the formation of diacylglycerol by PI-PLC in which calcium-independent PKC delta is responsible for the initial calcium signal and the subsequent PKC beta II translocation. LLO-dependent translocation of PKC beta I to early endosomes also occurs between 1 and 4 min after infection, but this occurs in the absence of PI-PLC. All of these signals were observed in cells that had not internalized bacteria. Blocking PKC beta translocation with hispidin resulted in more rapid uptake of wild-type bacteria and greatly reduced escape from the primary phagocytic vacuoles of J774 cells.", 
    "64": "Heart failure is a substantial cause of increased morbidity and mortality in the African-American population, with poorer prognosis versus white patients. Systolic heart failure is predominantly caused by poorly controlled hypertension in African-Americans. Overall, African-Americans remain underrepresented in morbidity and mortality heart failure trials, and further data are needed to confirm the potential benefit of present therapies and newer approaches to heart failure in African-Americans. Intensive blood pressure control and control of other risk factors, along with the appropriate application of evidence-based therapies including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and approved beta-blockers, are required to decrease racial disparities. Although some data suggest that contemporary treatment with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may be less effective in African-Americans in terms of reducing heart failure morbidity and mortality, there is not adequate evidence to support a unique strategy for this population. The use of evidence-based therapies should be equally applied to African-Americans as well as to other ethnic groups while awaiting further studies.", 
    "65": "Clinical trials provide average effects of interventions but are not powered to identify differences in subgroup responses. African-Americans have been under-represented in most previous trials in patients with heart failure. Furthermore, physiologic differences have been demonstrated between African-Americans and whites in the mechanisms and response to therapy in hypertension. Review of previous heart failure trials reveals that African-Americans exhibit less benefit than whites from ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and at least one b-blocker. In contrast, black patients experienced a greater benefit than white patients from the combination of nitrate and hydralazine. These data emphasize the need for trials in black patients to identify effective therapy. The first such trial, African-American Heart Failure Trial, is currently underway.",

This study aimed to determine the density and subtypes of beta-adrenoceptors in the normal and failing equine ventricular myocardium. Membrane preparations of the left papillary muscles were incubated with increasing concentrations of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist [3H]-CGP12177. Saturable and reversible binding of [3H]-CGP12177 to myocardial membranes was demonstrated with Kd values (+/- s.d.) of 0.49 +/- 0.40 and 0.43 +/- 0.22 nmol/l and Bmax values of 93.4 +/- 20.5 and 110.0 +/- 21.2 and fmol/mg protein for normal (n = 19) and heart failure (n = 10) tissues, respectively. Heart failure had no significant effect on the density of ventricular beta-adrenoceptors. The cardiac beta-adrenoceptors were further characterised by studying displacement of [3H]-CGP12177 (0.6 nmol/l) with the beta1-selective antagonists CGP20712A and the beta2-selective antagonist ICI118.551. In normal ventricular muscle, CGP20712A was 26 times more potent than ICI118.551 (Ki values 30.4 +/- 24.8 and 814.1 +/- 485.2 nmol/l, respectively). In heart failure cases, CGP 20712A curves were monophasic with a Ki value of 45.6 +/- 39.7 nmol/l. ICI 118.551 curves were biphasic in 5 horses where 11-31% of the cardiac beta-adrenoceptors had a high affinity for ICI 118.551. These data suggest that the normal equine ventricular myocardium possesses predominately beta1-adrenoceptors, with no evidence for co-existence of a significant population of beta2-adrenoceptors. The density of beta-adrenoceptors did not appear to change in heart failure, but the appearance of receptors with a high affinity for ICI118.551 may suggest that, in some cases, heart failure increases the expression of beta2-adrenoceptors in equine ventricular myocardium. This study provides an insight into the role of the adrenergic system in heart disease in the horse. Further studies in this area are warranted.",

We examined trends in the initial treatment choice for elderly people with hypertension and the effects of a government-sponsored program to publish and disseminate a simplified version of the national guidelines for the treatment of hypertension to all physicians in Ontario, Canada.", 
    "75": "Linked administrative databases containing information on the more than 1.2 million elderly residents in Ontario were used. Time series analysis was performed to determine prescribing trends from 1993 to 1998 for patients who began antihypertensive medication for the treatment of hypertension and to examine the effects of the simplified guidelines that were distributed in July of 1995.", 
    "76": "Diuretic agents were the most commonly prescribed medications, with annual rates from 35% to 38% (P = 0.59) throughout the study. Beta-blocker prescribing rose from 12% to 16% (P <0.01), whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prescribing rose from 27% to 32% (P <0.01). Prescriptions for calcium channel blockers dropped significantly, from 23% to 14% (P <0.01). However, the publication and dissemination of the Ontario hypertension guidelines had no statistically significant effects on the proportion of patients who began treatment with a diuretic agent (P = 0.55), beta-blocker, (P = 0.32), ACE inhibitor (P = 0.09), or calcium channel blocker (P = 0.07).",

    "78": "The possibility that spinal cord pathology following trauma can be assessed with early changes in the spinal cord evoked potentials (SCEPs) was examined in a rat model. Spinal cord injury (SCI) was produced in Equithesin-anesthetized (3 ml/kg, i.p.) rats through a longitudinal incision into the right dorsal horn at the T10-11 segments. The SCEPs were recorded with epidural electrodes placed over the T9 (rostral) segment of the cord. The SCEPs consisted of a small positive amplitude and a broad and high negative amplitude (NA). SCI resulted in an instant depression of the rostral NA that lasted for 1 h. However, the latency of NA continued to increase over time. At 5 h, spinal cord blood flow declined by 30% in the T9 segment, whereas the spinal cord water content and the permeability of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) were markedly increased. Damage to the nerve cells, glial cells, and myelin was quite common in the spinal cord, as seen by light and electron microscopy. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and nimodipine attenuated the SCEP changes immediately after trauma and resulted in a marked reduction in edema formation, BSCB permeability, and blood flow changes at 5 h. However, pretreatment with cyproheptadine, dexamethasone, phentolamine, and propranolol failed to attenuate the SCEP changes after SCI and did not reduce the cord pathology. These observations suggest that early changes in SCEP reflect secondary injury-induced alterations in the cord microenvironment. Obviously, these changes are crucial in determining the ultimate magnitude and severity of cord pathology.", 
    "79": "One class of pharmaceutical compounds identified in U.S. and European waters are the B-adrenergic receptor blocking compounds (B-blockers). However, little information is available on the potential aquatic toxicity of these compounds. Therefore, Hyalella azteca, Daphnia magna, Ceriodaphnia dubia, and Oryias latipes (Japanese medaka) were exposed to metoprolol, nadolol, and propranolol to determine potential toxicity. Average 48-h LC(50) for propranolol to H. azteca was 29.8 mg/L. The no-observed-effects concentration (NOEC) and lowest-observed-effects concentration (LOEC) for propranolol affecting reproduction of H. azteca were 0.001 and 0.1 mg/L, respectively. The average propranolol and metoprolol 48-h LC(50)s for D. magna were 1.6 and 63.9 mg/L, respectively. C. dubia 48-h LC(50)s were 0.85 and 8.8 mg/L for propranolol and metoprolol, respectively. The NOEC and LOEC of propranolol affecting reproduction in C. dubia were 0.125 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. In O. latipes, the propranolol 48-h LC(50) was 24.3 mg/L. Medaka growth was decreased at 0.5 mg/L propranolol. A 2-week medaka reproductive study indicated significant changes in plasma steroid levels; however, no changes in the average number of eggs produced or number of viable eggs which hatched was observed. In a 4-week follow-up propranolol exposure, the total number of eggs produced by medaka and the number of viable eggs that hatched were decreased at concentrations as low as 0.5 microg/L. Based on this study and the expected aqueous environmental exposure levels, adverse effects of propranolol to invertebrate populations is unlikely; however, further reproductive studies are need to elucidate the risk to teleosts.", 
    "80": "We showed previously that protein kinase C (PKC) is required for phagocytosis of apoptotic leukocytes by murine alveolar (AM\u00f8) and peritoneal macrophages (PM\u00f8) and that such phagocytosis is markedly lower in AM\u00f8 compared with PM\u00f8. In this study, we examined the roles of individual PKC isoforms in phagocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes by these two M\u00f8 populations. By immunoblotting, AM\u00f8 expressed equivalent PKC eta but lower amounts of other isoforms (alpha, betaI, betaII, delta, epsilon, mu, and zeta), with the greatest difference in betaII expression. A requirement for PKC betaII for phagocytosis was demonstrated collectively by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced depletion of PKC betaII, by dose-response to PKC inhibitor Ro-32-0432, and by use of PKC betaII myristoylated peptide as a blocker. Exposure of PM\u00f8 to phosphatidylserine (PS) liposomes specifically induced translocation of PKC betaII and other isoforms to membranes and cytoskeleton. Both AM\u00f8 and PM\u00f8 expressed functional PS receptor, blockade of which inhibited PKC betaII translocation. Our results indicate that murine tissue M\u00f8 require PKC betaII for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, which differs from the PKC isoform requirement previously described in M\u00f8 phagocytosis of other particles, and imply that a crucial action of the PS receptor in this process is PKC betaII activation.", 
    "81": "Compartmentation of intracellular signaling pathways serves as an important mechanism conferring the specificity of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. In the heart, stimulation of beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2-AR), a prototypical GPCR, activates a tightly localized protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, which regulates substrates at cell surface membranes, bypassing cytosolic target proteins (eg, phospholamban). Although a concurrent activation of beta2-AR-coupled G(i) proteins has been implicated in the functional compartmentation of PKA signaling, the exact mechanism underlying the restriction of the beta2-AR-PKA pathway remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) plays an essential role in confining the beta2-AR-PKA signaling. Inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 or wortmannin enables beta2-AR-PKA signaling to reach intracellular substrates, as manifested by a robust increase in phosphorylation of phospholamban, and markedly enhances the receptor-mediated positive contractile and relaxant responses in cardiac myocytes. These potentiating effects of PI3K inhibitors are not accompanied by an increase in beta2-AR-induced cAMP formation. Blocking G(i) or Gbetagamma signaling with pertussis toxin or betaARK-ct, a peptide inhibitor of Gbetagamma, completely prevents the potentiating effects induced by PI3K inhibition, indicating that the pathway responsible for the functional compartmentation of beta2-AR-PKA signaling sequentially involves G(i), Gbetagamma, and PI3K. Thus, PI3K constitutes a key downstream event of beta2-AR-G(i) signaling, which confines and negates the concurrent beta2-AR/G(s)-mediated PKA signaling.", 
    "82": "A liquid chromatographic column-switching method for the enantioselective determination of (RS)-sotalol in plasma was developed and validated. The method is based on the on-line coupling of a precolumn filled with the restricted access material LiChrospher ADS to a cellobiohydrolase I-based chiral stationary phase (CSP). The plasma samples were injected onto the precolumn using a mobile phase containing 1% methanol in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 for 10 min for the removal of matrix components. The analytes were transferred to the CSP for their enantiomeric separation by backflushing the precolumn with 15% 2-propanol in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) including 0.05 mM EDTA. The quantitative determination of the sotalol enantiomers was possible upon addition of the internal standard (S)-atenolol. The method was validated showing a good linearity in the concentration range from 25 to 1000 microg l(-1) for each enantiomer. The average values of the intra- and inter-day variability were 1.17% and 3.42%, respectively, for (R)-sotalol and 1.24% and 1.99%, respectively, for (S)-sotalol. The applicability of the method to real world samples has been proven by means of two pharmacokinetic studies. They revealed that the pharmacokinetic properties of the sotalol enantiomers do not differ significantly neither for healthy young volunteers after single dose application nor for elder patients in the steady state.", 
    "83": "Three model drug substances, the beta-blocking agents nadolol and propranolol and a choline-esterase inhibitor tacrine, were used in order to determine how different drug molecules affect the behavior of thermally responsive polymer nanoparticles composed of poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL). Pure PVCL particles in water exist in a swollen state at room temperature, but the size of the particles decreases discontinuously when the temperature is raised above the volume phase transition temperature. At temperatures above this transition temperature, water is expelled out from the nanoscopic hydrogel particles. Light scattering studies revealed that the more hydrophobic drug substances, propranolol and tacrine, considerably swell the PVCL-microgel. The more hydrophilic drug, nadolol, decreased the transition temperature of PVCL particles, whereas the transition temperature values of pure PVCL particles and that of the added propranolol and tacrine were quite similar. Attenuated drug release results showed that the beta-blocking agents were tightly bound to the microgel, and this was more evident at higher temperatures. On the contrary, the release of tacrine across the cellulose membrane was increased when PVCL particles were present. Thus, both physical and chemical properties of the drugs clearly affected their binding to PVCL particles and the release of drugs was affected by the temperature.", 
    "84": "The cornea is a major pathway for drug delivery to diseased eye structures. We have investigated the application of 1-s bursts of 20-kHz ultrasound, at I(SAPA) of 14 W/cm(2) (I(SATA) of 2 W/cm(2)), for enhancement of corneal permeability to glaucoma drugs of different lipophilicity (atenolol, carteolol, timolol and betaxolol). The permeability of rabbit cornea increased by 2.6 times for atenolol, 2.8 for carteolol, 1.9 for timolol and 4.4 times for betaxolol (all p-values < 0.05), after 60 min of ultrasound (US) exposure in vitro. The differences between the treatment and control experiments were statistically significant after 10 to 30 min of US exposure for all four drugs. US application appeared to produce epithelial disorganization and structural changes in the corneal stroma. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal US parameters for a safe and effective treatment.", 
    "85": "Dobutamine stress echocardiography, a highly useful and safe challenge test for myocardial ischemia, is being used increasingly. We report the case of a 37-year-old man with rest angina, repolarization abnormalities in precordial leads and normal coronary arteries who was referred for dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography, which was negative for ischemia. However, after testing, upon injection of propranolol, the patient suffered chest pain associated with ST elevation and severe regional systolic abnormalities. After intravenous nitroglycerin administration, chest pain and electrocardiographic abnormalities disappeared quickly, and systolic motion became normal. This complication was interpreted as a coronary spasm. We discuss the causes for the spasm and the role that might have been played by the drugs employed.", 
    "86": "The investigation was undertaken to study the stereoselective protein binding of alprenolol in renal disease patient sera, compared to that in the sera of healthy volunteers. The in vitro stereoselective protein binding of beta-blockers was determined in undiluted serum and in isolated alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP) solutions by ultrafiltration. The stereoselctive serum protein binding of alprenolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, in healthy volunteers was significantly altered in renal disease patients. We investigated the effects of AGP concentration and endogenous substances, including uremic toxins, on the stereoselective protein binding of alprenolol in renal disease patients. A good correlation between the unbound (R)/(S) ratio (F(R)/F(S) ratio), an apparent index of stereoselectivity in alprenolol serum binding and AGP concentration in serum, was found. However, stereoselective protein binding was not influenced by endogenous substances. This result can be explained by the difference in binding affinities of (R) and (S)-isomers of alprenolol to AGP. We conclude that the stereoselective protein binding of alprenolol in healthy volunteers and renal disease patients varies as a result of changes in AGP concentration. Accordingly, these findings might be useful in alprenolol therapy in renal disease patients.", 
    "87": "The role of adrenergic stimulation in Rb(+) uptake in normal and ischemic areas of pig hearts was investigated using an agonist (dobutamine) and an antagonist (S-propranolol). The left anterior descending artery (LAD) in isolated pig hearts was cannulated to maintain adequate perfusion of the LAD bed (2.2-2.8 ml/min/g). Rb(+) loading was initiated by switching perfusion to Rb(+)-containing Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer in the presence of 0.1 microM dobutamine, 0.5 microM propranolol, or no drug (control), and the LAD flow was reduced to 10% of the baseline for 120 min. The flow through the LAD was then restored to normal and the drugs were removed. In all groups the rate of Rb(+) uptake obtained from serial (87)Rb images was severely depressed in the ischemic anterior wall relative to that in the normal posterior wall. Dobutamine increased the rate of Rb(+) uptake in the posterior wall (6.3% +/- 1.4% vs. 2.5% +/- 0.25% per minute in control) and did not affect the rate in the anterior wall (0.86% +/- 0.40% vs. 1.14% +/- 0.19% per minute in control). Propranolol did not affect Rb(+) uptake in either of these areas. We conclude that the stimulation of Rb(+) uptake by dobutamine is related to activation of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase and passive Na(+) influx in normal tissue. The lack of any effect of propranolol implies a low level of endogenous norepinephrine during low-flow (LF) ischemia.", 
    "88": "Appropriate methods for meta-regression applied to a set of clinical trials, and the limitations and pitfalls in interpretation, are insufficiently recognized. Here we summarize recent research focusing on these issues, and consider three published examples of meta-regression in the light of this work. One principal methodological issue is that meta-regression should be weighted to take account of both within-trial variances of treatment effects and the residual between-trial heterogeneity (that is, heterogeneity not explained by the covariates in the regression). This corresponds to random effects meta-regression. The associations derived from meta-regressions are observational, and have a weaker interpretation than the causal relationships derived from randomized comparisons. This applies particularly when averages of patient characteristics in each trial are used as covariates in the regression. Data dredging is the main pitfall in reaching reliable conclusions from meta-regression. It can only be avoided by prespecification of covariates that will be investigated as potential sources of heterogeneity. However, in practice this is not always easy to achieve. The examples considered in this paper show the tension between the scientific rationale for using meta-regression and the difficult interpretative problems to which such analyses are prone.", 
    "89": "An increase in phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) in blood mononuclear white cells of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) has been described. This and other skin disorders worsen during stress, during which there are increased circulating levels of adrenaline and glucocorticoids. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of both these hormones on PDE4 in inflammatory cells. The human monocyte cell line U-937 was used as a model of blood mononuclear leucocytes. For this purpose, (1) the effect of adrenaline on PDE4 activity was determined, (2) the receptor mediating adrenaline actions was characterized, (3) the role of intracellular cAMP in PDE4 activation was investigated and (4) the effect of glucocorticoids on PDE4 activity was also ascertained. Adrenaline at a concentration of 1 micro M produced a two- to threefold selective increase in PDE4 activity in U-937 cells after 4 h of incubation with the hormone. This stimulation was reversible, as well as concentration- and time-dependent. Cycloheximide (10 micro M) induced a blockade of adrenaline-induced stimulation of PDE4. The stimulatory effect was inhibited by propranolol, but not by atenolol or phentolamine, in a concentration-dependent manner and was mimicked by salbutamol. The stimulation of PDE4 was paralleled by an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP. 8-Br-cAMP and forskolin also increased PDE4 activity. After 4 h of incubation in the presence of adrenaline, inhibition of cAMP degradation by rolipram further increased cAMP levels by about 300% and also enhanced PDE4 activity. These results suggest that adrenaline-induced stimulation of PDE4 is mediated by the beta(2)-adrenoceptor and is related to intracellular levels of cAMP, which might trigger expression and synthesis of the enzyme. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (in the concentration range 10(-8) to 10(-6) M) showed no effect on PDE4 activity or on the cAMP accumulation induced by adrenaline, even after prolonged (24 h) incubation with the cells. Of the two stress hormones assayed, PDE4 activity was shown to be sensitive to adrenaline elevation but resistant to changes in glucocorticoid levels in the U-937 monocytic cell line.", 
    "90": "Activation of the local and systemic renin-angiotensin system is directly and indirectly involved in mechanisms of vascular remodeling during chronic hypertension. This study investigated the effect of angiotensin II (AII) on rat vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration towards platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in vitro. Pre-treatment with AII (1 microM) for 48 or 72 h induced a significant increase in PDGF-BB-directed migration by 77 +/- 21 % and 58 +/- 24 %, respectively (both p < 0.01). This effect was concentration dependent and inhibited by the selective angiotensin receptor type I (AT(1)) blocker DUP 753. PDGF-directed migration of VSMCs was significantly inhibited by antibodies against beta(3)-and beta(5)-integrins, indicating an important role of these integrins in VSMC migration. However, AII augmented migration was not accompanied by an increased expression of beta(3)- and beta(5)-integrin mRNA and protein levels in VSMCs. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK 1/2 with PD 98059 (30 microM) completely abolished the effect of AII on PDGF-BB-directed VSMC migration (p < 0.01). The proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are cytoskeleton-associated protein kinases participating in integrin-dependent signaling. Therefore, expression and phosphorylation of these kinases was determined 48 h after AII treatment, revealing a significant increase in Pyk2 and FAK protein levels (up to 2-fold, both p < 0.05) and increased phosphorylation of Pyk2 (2-fold, p < 0.05) and ERK 1/2 (4-fold, p < 0.05) as compared to controls. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis demonstrated a translocation of Pyk2 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, as well as a perinuclear enrichment of ERK 1/2 protein 48 h after AII treatment. In conclusion, our data suggest that changes in the levels of Pyk2 and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, responsible for integrin-dependent signaling, as well as their subcellular translocation are important for the enhanced chemotactic response of VSMCs after AII pre-treatment.", 
    "91": "This study examined the proposition that kinins are involved in the renal hemodynamic effect of an ACE inhibitor in Goldblatt (GB) hypertension. The effects of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat were compared in two groups of anesthetized two-kidney one-clip GB rabbits. One group (n = 11) was given enalaprilat (10 mg/kg, i.v.) while a second group (n = 10) received the kinin B2 receptor antagonist, icatibant (2.5-5 microg/kg/min, i.v.) prior to enalaprilat. Enalaprilat caused a 40% rise in renal blood flow and 11 mm Hg decrease in blood pressure in the untreated, but no significant renal effect in the icatibant-treated group. Blood pressure was reduced to the same degree in both groups. The results indicate that kinins play a major role in the renal hemodynamic, but not the blood pressure effect of ACE inhibition in the GB rabbit.", 
    "92": "A new concept of cardioprotection based on the exploitation of endogenous mechanisms is known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC). It has been hypothesized that substances released during brief ischemic stress (e.g. catecholamines) stimulate the receptors and trigger multiple cell signaling cascades. Opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels [K(ATP)] has been suggested as a possible final step in the mechanisms of protection. In this study, the role of adrenergic activation was tested in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts subjected to test ischemia (TI; 30 min occlusion of LAD coronary artery) by: 1) mimicking IPC (5 min ischemia, 10 min reperfusion) with short-term (5 min) administration of norepinephrine (NE, 1 microM), 15 min prior to TI; 2) blockade with beta- or alpha1-receptor antagonists, propranolol (10 microM) and prazosin (2 microM), respectively, applied 15 min prior to TI during IPC. The role of K(ATP) opening was examined by perfusion with a K(ATP) blocker glibenclamide (10 microM) during IPC. Both IPC and NE-induced PC effectively reduced the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) to 33% and 37%, respectively, vs 100% in the non-PC controls, whereby ventricular fibrillation (VF) was totally abolished by IPC and markedly suppressed by PC with NE (0% and 10%, respectively, vs 70% in the non-PC hearts; P < 0.05). The severity of arrhythmias (arrhythmia score, AS) was also markedly attenuated by both interventions (IPC: AS 1.7 +/- 0.4; NE-PC: AS 1.8 +/- 0.3 vs AS 4.1 +/- 0.2 in the controls; P < 0.05). Protection was not suppressed by propranolol (VT 28%; VF 14%; AS 2.2 +/- 0.6), whereas prazosin reversed the protective effect of PC (VT 83%; VF 67%; AS 4.0 +/- 0.8). Antiarrhythmic protection afforded by NE-PC was abolished by pretreatment of rats with pertussis toxin (25 microg/kg, i.p.) given 48 h prior to the experiments. Glibenclamide did not suppress the IPC-induced protection. In conclusion, the sensitivity of the rat heart to ischemic arrhythmias can be modulated by IPC. Protection is mediated via stimulation of alpha1-adrenergic receptors coupled with Gi-proteins but glibenclamide-sensitive K(ATP) channels do not appear to be involved in the mechanisms of antiarrhythmic protection in this model.",

    "94": "In this study, the response to intravenous adenosine (0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg) was studied in 18 patients (age 46+/-15 years) with IST. In a subset of patients (n = 5), the direct effects of adenosine were assessed during pharmacologic beta-adrenergic and cholinergic blockade. Atrial cycle length (ACL) was measured before adenosine injection, at the time of the greatest cycle length prolongation, and during the maximum rebound acceleration of heart rate. Eighteen subjects (age 46+/-11 years) with normal sinus rhythm undergoing clinically indicated electrophysiologic study served as controls. Adenosine did not terminate IST in any patient. The maximum dose of adenosine prolonged the sinus interval significantly, from 780+/-128 msec to 985+/-225 msec (P < 0.001) in the control subjects. In contrast, adenosine caused no significant lengthening of atrial cycle length (527+/-69 msec vs 590+/-148 msec; P = NS) in the patients with IST. Similar difference in the response to adenosine was seen during the pharmacologic autonomic blockade. The reflex increase of the sinus rate (rebound effect) was greater in the control subjects than in the patients with IST (21.2%+/-9.7% vs 8.5%+/-8.8%; P < 0.001).",

    "96": "Aggressive behavior is frequently observed in schizophrenic patients. More than 50 % of all psychiatric patients and 10 % of schizophrenic patients show aggressive symptoms varying from threatening behavior and agitation to assault. The pharmacological treatment of acute, persisting and repetitive aggression is a serious problem for other patients and staff members. Not only is violent behavior from mentally ill patients the most detrimental factor in their stigmatization, aggression is also a considerable direct source of danger for the patients themselves. Based on rather limited evidence, a wide variety of medications for the pharmacological treatment of aggression has been recommended: typical and atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, beta-blockers and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Most clinical information on treating aggression has been collected for atypical neuroleptics, particularly for clozapine. Several retrospective and open studies indicate its efficacy. Treatment duration of 6 months is recommended to induce a stable reduction of physical and verbal aggression. Severe side effects have very rarely been seen. At the moment, clozapine seems to be the first choice in aggression treatment. Within the last few years, about 10 articles were published showing that this is the most effective antiaggressive agent in the treatment of aggression and agitation in psychiatric patients, independent of psychiatric diagnosis. However, clozapine, like all the other substances used, does not have an established indication for the treatment of aggressive symptoms. Noncompliance with medication makes it difficult to choose the right preparation for the medication: tablets, liquids, intramuscular injections and readily soluble \"FDDFs\" are available. Ethical, juridical and methodological problems prevent controlled studies from establishing a reference in the treatment of aggression in mentally ill patients. This review summarizes the current discussion and publications on the pharmacological treatment of aggression in schizophrenic patients of the last 20 years. In addition, we will briefly present studies and case reports concerning the treatment of aggression in other psychiatric patients.",

After 8 weeks the dose was doubled in the non-responders (diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg).

The level of LV dysfunction seems to be related to the degree of myocardial fibrosis. Prognosis of hypertensive patients who have LVH regression appears to be improved. Therefore, LVH regression is an important antihypertensive treatment goal. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is implicated in LVH development and myocardial fibrosis in essential arterial hypertension. Early studies in the 80s and 90s have led expectations that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors could induce greater LVH regression than other antihypertensive drugs at similar blood pressure reduction. In the late 90s, the double-blind randomized controlled PRESERVE trial (Prospective Randomize Enalapril Study Evaluating Reversal of Ventricular Enlargement) has been designed to evaluate whether the ACE inhibitor enalapril was more effective than nifedipine GITS in regressing LVH and improving LV diastolic dysfunction. The PRESERVE study demonstrated a mildly higher antihypertensive effect of nifedipine GITS than enalapril, which required more frequently association with hydrochlorothiazide to control blood pressure. However, at similar level of blood pressure reduction achieved with enalapril and long-acting nifedipine in association with hydrochlorothiazide or atenolol, both antihypertensive treatments showed similar efficacy in LVH regression and LV diastolic filling improvement.",

In view of the role of beta-adrenoceptors in thermogenesis we investigated the relationship between beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-adrenoceptor-stimulated lipolysis in abdominal sc fat cells and 3 different previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the calpain-10 gene (SNP-19, SNP-43, and SNP-63). The study sample comprised 240 healthy subjects. A strong association between lipolytic beta(3)-receptor function in adipocytes and the SNP-19, which is a deletion/insertion (1/2) was observed in overweight subjects (body mass index, >25 kg/m(2)), but not in lean ones. No association was found between any of the polymorphisms and lipolytic function of either beta(1)- or beta(2)-receptors. Carriers of 1/1 in SNP-19 had 30-fold decreased lipolytic sensitivity of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in comparison to 1/2 or 2/2 carriers (P = 0.0019, by ANOVA). This was found in both genders and was not influenced by SNP-43 or SNP-63 in the calpain-10 gene or by the Trp(64)Arg polymorphism in the beta(3)-adrenoceptor gene. In conclusion, a deletion/insertion polymorphism in the calpain-10 gene (SNP-19) is associated with reduced beta(3)-adrenoceptor function in obesity. This could be of importance for regulating thermogenesis in overweight subjects.",

Patients were divided into those with target organ damage (TOD; n=107) and those free of end-organ damage. Plasma levels of soluble P-selectin (sP-sel), a marker of platelet activation, and von Willebrand factor (vWF), an index of endothelial damage/dysfunction (both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the rheological indices fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, hematocrit, platelet, and white cell count were measured.

Patients with TOD had significantly higher vWF, 137 (SD 33) versus 125 (SD 33) IU/dL (P=0.002,) and a greater proportion of smokers, 31% versus 16% (P=0.002). There were no statistically significant differences in plasma viscosity, fibrinogen, hematocrit, white blood cell count, platelet count, or sP-sel between the 2 subgroups. In multivariate analysis, vWF was a significant independent predictor for TOD. After 6 months of intensified management in 53 patients who entered the trial, there were significant reductions in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, hematocrit, plasma viscosity, sP-sel, and vWF (all P<0.01) but no significant change in fibrinogen. In conclusion, there is a relationship between TOD and endothelial damage/dysfunction in hypertension.

We recently established two pancreatic beta-cell MIN6 cell lines that are glucose-responsive (MIN6-m9) and glucose-unresponsive (MIN6-m14). In the present study we have determined the cause of the glucose unresponsiveness in MIN6-m14. Initially, elevated [Ca(2+)](i) was observed in MIN6-m14, but normalization of the [Ca(2+)](i) by nifedipine, a Ca(2+) channel blocker, markedly improved the intracellular Ca(2+) response to glucose and the glucose-induced insulin secretion. The expression of subunits of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels and voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels were increased at both mRNA and protein levels in MIN6-m14 treated with nifedipine. As a consequence, the functional expression of these channels at the cell surface, both of which are decreased in MIN6-m14 without nifedipine treatment, were increased significantly. Contrariwise, Bay K8644, a Ca(2+) channel agonist, caused severe impairment of glucose-induced insulin secretion in glucose-responsive MIN6-m9 due to decreased expression of the channel subunits. Chronically elevated [Ca(2+)](i), therefore, is responsible for the glucose unresponsiveness of MIN6-m14. The present study also suggests normalization of [Ca(2+)](i) in pancreatic beta-cells as a therapeutic strategy in treatment of impaired insulin secretion.",

Metoprolol tartrate was chosen as a model drug because of its high water solubility. Matrix tablets containing either 30 (M1), 40 (M2) or 50% (M3) of guar gum were prepared by wet granulation technique using starch paste as a binder. Three-layer matrix tablets of metoprolol tartrate were prepared by compressing on both sides of guar gum matrix tablet granules of metoprolol tartrate M1, M2 or M3 with either 50 (TL1M1, TL1M2 or TL1M3) or 75 mg (TL2M1, TL2M2 or TL2M3) of guar gum granules as release retardant layers. Both the matrix and three-layer matrix tablets were evaluated for hardness, thickness, drug content uniformity, and subjected to in vitro drug release studies. The amount of metoprolol tartrate released from the matrix and three-layer matrix tablets at different time intervals was estimated by using a HPLC method. Matrix tablets of metoprolol tartrate were unable to provide the required drug release rate. However, the three-layer guar gum matrix tablets (TL2M3) provided the required release rate on par with the theoretical release rate for metoprolol tartrate formulations meant for twice daily administration. The three-layer guar gum matrix tablet (TL2M3) showed no change either in physical appearance, drug content or in dissolution pattern after storage at 40 degrees C/75% RH for 6 months. The FT-IR study did not show any possibility of metoprolol tartrate/guar gum interaction with the formulation excipients used in the study. The results indicated that guar gum, in the form of three-layer matrix tablets, is a potential carrier in the design of oral controlled drug delivery systems for highly water-soluble drugs such as metoprolol tartrate.",

The reduction in MAP after reversal of 2K1C hypertension has been ascribed either to release of a renal medullary depressor hormone (RMDH) or suppression of the renin-angiotensin and/or sympathetic nervous system. We studied in conscious rats: (i) The effects of angiotensin II receptor blockade (ARB; candesartan), sympathetic blockade (propranolol and phentolamine) or a combination on MAP in 6-week long 2K1C-RHR; (ii) The effects of reversal of 2K1C hypertension by removal of the constricting clip (unclipping, UC) or nephrectomy (Nx) on MAP, plasma renin activity (PRA) and noradrenaline (NA) spillover rates. The results show that: (i) MAP in the 2K1C-RHR was almost normalized by ARB but not significantly affected by the sympathetic blockade. The combination was not more effective than ARB alone; (ii) UC and Nx reduced MAP in 2K1C to similar levels as ARB. No significant changes in PRA or catecholamines could be detected in UC and Nx groups. We conclude that hypertension in 2K1C-RHR is maintained by the renin-angiotensin system without much contribution from the sympathetic nervous system. Furthermore, we found no evidence that UC of our model of 2K1C was associated with a generalized decrease in sympathetic tone or substantial release of RMDH from the unclipped kidney. Thus, we conclude that in the present model of 2K1C, both maintenance and reversal of hypertension are controlled by the renin-angiotensin system.",

Isoproterenol was the most potent agonist in both the NPE and TM cells. The rank order of potency of agonists in NPE and TM cells, respectively, was: isoproterenol [EC50 = 37 and 66 nM] > epinephrine [EC50 = 112 and 526 nM] > albuterol [EC50 = 426 and 785 nM] > norepinephrine [EC50 = 3 and > 10 microM] > phenylephrine [EC50 > 10 microM for both] = dopamine [EC50 > 10 microM for both](n = 3-19).

Propranolol treatment decreased fH in winter-acclimatized pigeons, accelerated fH in summer-acclimatized pigeons, but had no effect on fH in spring-acclimatized pigeons. The effect of propranolol in summer-acclimatized pigeons is opposite to that observed in mammals. Interestingly, isoproterenol produced a propranolol-like cardioacceleration in heat-acclimated pigeons. We suggest that propranolol affects fH in summer-acclimatized pigeons via two opposing routes-a direct and a peripheral indirect route. We also suggest that the cardiovascular effects of propranolol are involved in the capacity of the pigeon to evaporate water from its skin.", 
    "150": "An acid phosphatase (acPAse) activity was released during germination and tube growth of pollen of Lilium longiflorum Thunb. By inhibiting components of the secretory pathway, the export of the acPase activity was affected and tube growth stopped. Brefeldin A (1 microM) and cytochalasin D (1 microM), which block the production and transport of secretory vesicles, respectively, inhibited the acPase secretion. The Ca2+ channel blocker gadolinium (100 microM Gd3+) also inhibited acPase secretion and tube growth, whereas 3 mM caffeine, another Ca2+ uptake inhibitor, stimulated the acPase release, while tube growth was inhibited. The Yariv reagent (beta-D-glucosyl)3 Yariv phenylglycoside stopped tube growth by binding to arabinogalactan proteins of the tube tip cell wall but did not affect acPase secretion. A strong correlation between tube growth and acPase release was detected. The secreted acPase activity had a pH optimum at pH 5.5, a KM of 0.4 mM for p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and was inhibited by zinc, molybdate, phosphate, and fluoride ions, but not by tartrate. In electrophoresis gels the main acPase activity was detected at 32 kDa. The conspicuous correlation between activity of the secretory pathway and acPase secretion during tube elongation strongly indicates an important role of the acPase during pollen tube growth and the secreted acPase activity may serve as a useful marker enzyme assay for secretory activity in pollen tubes.", 
    "151": "In this work, the stereoselective release behaviors of \"low\"-swelling molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) bead matrices in pressed-coat tablet type were studied. Either R-propranolol selective MIP or S-propranolol selective MIP was combined with excipients and racemic propranolol and fabricated into the matrix. Subsequently, the release of different propranolol enantiomers from the matrices was examined. Also, the microscopic structure of the hydrated \"low\"-swelling MIP matrix was determined using a cryogenic scanning electron microscope in order to compare with that of the hydrated \"high\"-swelling MIP matrix. In vitro release profiles of the \"low\"-swelling matrices showed a difference in the release of enantiomers, in that the non-template isomer was released faster than the template isomer. However, in the last phase of dissolution this difference reduced and later reversed, resulting at last in the type of specificity being similar to that obtained previously with \"high\"-swelling MIP matrices. In summary, MIP beads can be fashioned into matrices and incorporated into different formulations to regulate the resultant stereoselectivity. From the behaviors of stereoselective release observed in MIP matrices, we can conclude that the enantioselective-controlled delivery mechanism of MIPs via formulations depends on the relative affinity of the enantiomer for the template sites, as well as the nature of the polymer, such as hydrophobicity and swellability.",

In mixed hippocampal cultures neuroprotection against glutamate-induced cell death by clenbuterol (1 microM) was blocked by the beta(1/2)-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and the specific beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists 1-[2,3-(Dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)-oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)-amino]-2-butanol (ICI 118,551, 10 microM) and butoxamine (10 microM), while the beta(1)-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist metoprolol (10 microM) showed no effect. The beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists clenbuterol (1-100 microM) and salmeterol (0.01-1 microM) induced profound morphological changes of cultured astrocytes which transformed into activated astroglia with pronounced dendrite-like processes. This phenomenon was blocked by butoxamine (1 mM) and propranolol (10 microM), but not by metoprolol (10 microM). However, similar morphological changes in astrocytes were also observed after stimulation of beta(1)-adrenoceptors by dobutamine (1-10 microM) and norepinephrine (1-10 microM). This effect was blocked by propranolol (10 microM) and metoprolol (10 microM) but not by butoxamine (1 mM), suggesting that stimulation of either beta(1)- or beta(2)-adrenoceptors was sufficient to induce activation of astrocytes. In addition, beta(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation by dobutamine (1-10 microM) protected hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity. In a model of focal cerebral ischemia in mice the cerebroprotective effect of clenbuterol (0.3 mg/kg) was blocked by propranolol (5 mg/kg) and butoxamine (5 mg/kg). Interestingly, the infarct size was reduced after co-treatment with clenbuterol (0.3 mg/kg) and metoprolol (5 mg/kg) as compared to clenbuterol treatment (0.3 mg/kg) alone. In conclusion, activation of astrocytes and neuroprotection can be achieved by stimulation of either beta(1)- or beta(2)-adrenoceptors in vitro, whereas in vivo neuroprotection is preferentially mediated through beta(2)-adrenoceptors."
