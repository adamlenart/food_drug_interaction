This study was performed to compare the effect of postoperative oral carvedilol versus metoprolol on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after CABG compared with metoprolol. In a double-blind clinical trial, 60 patients with coronary artery disease, aged 35 to 65 years, who had an ejection fraction of 15% to 35% were included. Either carvedilol or metoprolol was administered the day after CABG. The patients were evaluated by the same cardiologist 14 days before and 2 and 6 months after elective CABG. The results demonstrated better improvements in LVEF in the carvedilol group. No difference regarding postoperative arrhythmias or mortality was detected. The results suggest that carvedilol may exert more of an improved myocardial effect than metoprolol for the low ejection fraction patients undergoing CABG in the early postoperative months.",

    "13": "Extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) is known to regulate vascular smooth muscle contraction. However, a role for ERK in airway smooth muscle contraction has yet to be demonstrated conclusively, although contractile agents increase ERK activity in airway smooth muscle. Rather than initiating contraction, ERK could regulate airway tone by interfering with relaxation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether ERK regulates contraction or relaxation of airway smooth muscle. Segments of porcine peripheral bronchioles were mounted in an isolated tissue bath in Krebs-Henseleit buffer and maintained at 37\u00b0C. Cumulative concentration-response curves to histamine, endothelin-1, or the muscarinic agonist carbachol were then carried out in the absence or presence of the MEK inhibitor PD98059. In separate experiments, cumulative concentration response curves to the \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline or the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin were carried out in the absence or presence of the MEK inhibitors PD98059 or U0126. ERK activity was measured by Western blotting. All three contractile agents increased ERK activity, but the contractile responses were unaffected by PD98059. On the other hand, both PD98059 and U0126 enhanced the relaxations to isoprenaline but not relaxations to the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. The enhancement of isoprenaline-induced relaxations with PD98059 was prevented by the K(+) channel blocker tetraethylammonium. These data suggest that ERK regulates airway smooth muscle tone by inhibiting \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations, rather than an initiation of contraction. The effect on \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses appears to be through a cAMP-independent mechanism, possibly through an interaction with K(+) channels.", 
    "14": "Since they were launched on the market in 1964, cardiovascular indications for beta-blockers have been validated and accepted worldwide. Numerous studies and meta-analysis have confirmed their benefits. They reduce mortality in post infarction and acute coronary syndrome populations and also in people with stable coronary heart disease. Moreover, heart failure with systolic left ventricular dysfunction is a major indication for this therapeutic class, providing a 30% decrease in mortality. In patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, beta-blockers are recommended for rate control. In hypertension patients, first-line drug treatment with beta-blockers is currently discussed. Indeed, several studies have shown that patients randomized in the beta-blocker arms experienced more coronary heart and cerebrovascular diseases than comparators. Their lesser effect on central blood pressure decrease could partially explain those results. Nevertheless, beta-blockers are still considered as first-line drugs for hypertension in the French and European guidelines. Long-term comparative studies focusing on central blood pressure are needed. Concerning the other indications for beta-blockers in vascular diseases, their use perioperatively to reduce surgical cardiovascular risk raised much hope, but the most recent results are disappointed and even suggest possible higher mortality. Finally, except for patients with critical ischemia of the lower limbs, presence of peripheral artery disease should probably be considered as a condition favoring their prescription.",

The STEMI was diagnosed in 35-36% of these patients in 2003-2005, and this proportion remained stable at 30% to 32% in 2006-2009. The mean age of STEMI patients increased from 62.5 years in 2003 to 64.5 in 2009. During this period, women represented 32.7% to 34.6% of the STEMI patients. Proportion of patients presenting with pulmonary oedema or cardiogenic shock decreased with time, from 15.5% in 2003 to 8% in 2009. Delays to reperfusion tended to reduce over time: pain-to- -admission time was 240 min in 2005 and 229 min in 2009 and door-to-balloon time was 32 and 25 min in 2005 and 2009, respectively, with the delay being longer in the elderly population.

At the same time, the proportion of patients undergoing thrombolysis declined from 14% to 1%. Aspirin, beta-blocker, statin and ACE inhibitor use was constantly high, while nitrate use declined from 82% to 15%. The proportion of patients receiving clopidogrel increased from 40% to 97% over the analysed period. Significant reductions in mortality rates were observed: in-hospital mortality decreased from 11.9% to 6.4%; 30-day mortality from 13.5% to 9.6%; and 12-month mortality from 19.8% to 15.4% in 2003 and 2009, respectively. Invasive treatment strategy was associated with better in-hospital and long-term patient survival.",

    "42": "The objective of this study is to assess effects of beta-blocker migraine prophylaxis on cortical excitability determined by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Phosphene and motor thresholds (PT, MT) were investigated in 29 patients with migraine, in 15 of them prior to and following preventive medication with metoprolol and in 14 patients without prophylaxis. Following prophylaxis headache frequency significantly decreased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and mean PT were significantly increased (51.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5 vs. 63.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.4%) compared to patients without preventive treatment (53.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3 vs. 52.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.3%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.040). Mean MT did not significantly differ either between groups or due to treatment. In the group of all patients, a significant inverse correlation between headache frequency and the level of PT was found (R\u00a0=\u00a0-0.629; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). There was, however, no significant correlation in the subgroups of patients. We conclude that (a) clinical efficacy of beta-blocker treatment in migraine could be (at least partly) linked to its ability to modulate the excitability of the visual cortex and (b) the PT determined by TMS appears suitable to assess the effects of prophylaxis on cortical excitability in the individual patient. This may be useful in clinical trials investigating migraine preventive drugs.", 
    "43": "Sex-specific differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been reported to have important clinical consequences. In this review, some representative sex-specific differences in absorption and transporters (that is, P-glycoprotein (P-gp)), metabolic processes (that is, those that involve cytochrome P450 (CYP)), clearance (Cl) processes (for example, renal excretion or other pharmacokinetic parameters) and involvement of sex hormones (that is, estrogen and testosterone) in the regulation of some metabolic enzymes are introduced for each of the following categories of anti-hypertensive drugs: calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretic agents, and \u03b2-adrenergic-receptor blockers (\u03b2-blockers). In many cases, female sex is a risk factor for adverse effects or attenuated clinical responses because of lower Cl, smaller distribution volumes, higher activity of some metabolic enzymes (especially hepatic CYP3A4), or presence of sex hormones. Additionally, some of these factors often co-contribute to the sex-specific differences. Furthermore, pharmacodynamic variability among individuals is often larger than pharmacokinetic variability; in other words, it could become a predominant determinant of interindividual differences in therapeutic responses. Thus, studies of sex-specific differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics should be conducted. However, sex-related disparities in pharmacokinetics may not necessarily correspond to clinically significant differences in therapeutic response. There are still large gaps in our knowledge of sex-specific differences in clinical pharmacology and much more research is needed.",

The OCEAN Study is a collaborative study between Japan and China, enrolling 20\u2009000 patients and following them for 3 to 4 years. A pilot study was conducted before the full-scale study to confirm the feasibility of the protocol and that the study groups and infrastructures could function properly. A total of 279 Japanese patients were enrolled from 57 participating medical institutions between June and December 2004.

The heart weight:body weight ratio fell more in SHRs medicated with olmesartan versus those receiving atenolol. These changes were associated with increases in plasma Ang II in SHRs given the angiotensin II receptor blocker. At the end of treatment, plasma Ang (1-7) was higher in the olmesartan than atenolol or vehicle groups. The glomerular sclerosis (GS) index was lowered by olmesartan and atenolol compared with the vehicle group.

    "61": "The R21C substitution in cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is the only identified mutation within its unique N-terminal extension that is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in man. Particularly, this mutation is located in the consensus sequence for \u03b2-adrenergic-activated protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation. The mechanisms by which this mutation leads to heart disease are still unclear. Therefore, we generated cTnI knock-in mouse models carrying an R21C mutation to evaluate the resultant functional consequences. Measuring the in vivo levels of incorporated mutant and WT cTnI, and their basal phosphorylation levels by top-down mass spectrometry demonstrated: 1) a dominant-negative effect such that, the R21C+/- hearts incorporated 24.9% of the mutant cTnI within the myofilament; and 2) the R21C mutation abolished the in vivo phosphorylation of Ser(23)/Ser(24) in the mutant cTnI. Adult heterozygous (R21C+/-) and homozygous (R21C+/+) mutant mice activated the fetal gene program and developed a remarkable degree of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Investigation of cardiac skinned fibers isolated from WT and heterozygous mice revealed that the WT cTnI was completely phosphorylated at Ser(23)/Ser(24) unless the mice were pre-treated with propranolol. After propranolol treatment (-PKA), the pCa-tension relationships of all three mice (i.e. WT, R21C+/-, and R21C+/+) were essentially the same. However, after treatment with propranolol and PKA, the R21C cTnI mutation reduced (R21C+/-) or abolished (R21C+/+) the well known decrease in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension that accompanies Ser(23)/Ser(24) cTnI phosphorylation. Altogether, the combined effects of the R21C mutation appear to contribute toward the development of HCM and suggest that another physiological role for the phosphorylation of Ser(23)/Ser(24) in cTnI is to prevent cardiac hypertrophy.",

This study examined the effects of maternal separation (MS) on cardiac stress responsivity and structure in adulthood. Male Wistar rats were separated from the dams for 3\u00a0h per day from postnatal days 2 through 15. When exposed to 5-day intermittent restraint stress (IRS) as adults, MS, and control rats showed similar acute modifications of cardiac sympathovagal balance, quantified via heart rate variability analysis. In addition, MS had no effect on cardiac pacemaker intrinsic activity (as revealed by autonomic blockade with scopolamine and atenolol) and did not affect the circadian rhythmicity of heart rate, neither before nor after IRS. However, MS differed from control rats in cardiac parasympathetic drive following IRS, which was heightened in the latter but remained unchanged in the former, both during the light and dark phases of the daily rhythm. The evaluation of adult cardiac structure indicated that stress experienced during a crucial developmental period induced only modest changes, involving cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, increased density of vascular structures, and myocardial fibrosis. The mildness of these functional-structural effects questions the validity of MS as a model for early stress-induced cardiac disease in humans.",

    "72": "Modulation of the standing outward current (I (SO)) by muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (MAChR) stimulation is fundamental for the state-dependent change in activity mode of thalamocortical relay (TC) neurons. Here, we probe the contribution of MAChR subtypes, G proteins, phospholipase C (PLC), and two pore domain K(+) (K(2P)) channels to this signaling cascade. By the use of spadin and A293 as specific blockers, we identify TWIK-related K(+) (TREK)-1 channel as new targets and confirm TWIK-related acid-sensitve K(+) (TASK)-1 channels as known effectors of muscarinic signaling in TC neurons. These findings were confirmed using a high affinity blocker of TASK-3 and TREK-1, namely, tetrahexylammonium chloride. It was found that the effect of muscarinic stimulation was inhibited by M(1)AChR-(pirenzepine, MT-7) and M(3)AChR-specific (4-DAMP) antagonists, phosphoinositide-specific PLC\u03b2 (PI-PLC) inhibitors (U73122, ET-18-OCH(3)), but not the phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC (PC-PLC) blocker D609. By comparison, depleting guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) in the intracellular milieu nearly completely abolished the effect of MAChR stimulation. The block of TASK and TREK channels was accompanied by a reduction of the muscarinic effect on I (SO). Current-clamp recordings revealed a membrane depolarization following MAChR stimulation, which was sufficient to switch TC neurons from burst to tonic firing under control conditions but not during block of M(1)AChR/M(3)AChR and in the absence of intracellular GTP. These findings point to a critical role of G proteins and PLC as well as TASK and TREK channels in the muscarinic modulation of thalamic activity modes.",

    "82": "Formation of a dense microtubule network that impedes cardiac contraction and intracellular transport occurs in severe pressure overload hypertrophy. This process is highly dynamic, since microtubule depolymerization causes striking improvement in contractile function. A molecular etiology for this cytoskeletal alteration has been defined in terms of type 1 and type 2A phosphatase-dependent site-specific dephosphorylation of the predominant myocardial microtubule-associated protein (MAP)4, which then decorates and stabilizes microtubules. This persistent phosphatase activation is dependent upon ongoing upstream activity of p21-activated kinase-1, or Pak1. Because cardiac \u03b2-adrenergic activity is markedly and continuously increased in decompensated hypertrophy, and because \u03b2-adrenergic activation of cardiac Pak1 and phosphatases has been demonstrated, we asked here whether the highly maladaptive cardiac microtubule phenotype seen in pathological hypertrophy is based on \u03b2-adrenergic overdrive and thus could be reversed by \u03b2-adrenergic blockade. The data in this study, which were designed to answer this question, show that such is the case; that is, \u03b2(1)- (but not \u03b2(2)-) adrenergic input activates this pathway, which consists of Pak1 activation, increased phosphatase activity, MAP4 dephosphorylation, and thus the stabilization of a dense microtubule network. These data were gathered in a feline model of severe right ventricular (RV) pressure overload hypertrophy in response to tight pulmonary artery banding (PAB) in which a stable, twofold increase in RV mass is reached by 2 wk after pressure overloading. After 2 wk of hypertrophy induction, these PAB cats during the following 2 wk either had no further treatment or had \u03b2-adrenergic blockade. The pathological microtubule phenotype and the severe RV cellular contractile dysfunction otherwise seen in this model of RV hypertrophy (PAB No Treatment) was reversed in the treated (PAB \u03b2-Blockade) cats. Thus these data provide both a specific etiology and a specific remedy for the abnormal microtubule network found in some forms of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.",

Overall quality-of-life is often markedly affected by Graves' disease; this should not be overlooked. Smoking increases relapse risk after a course of antithyroid drug; it also increases the risk and severity of Graves' orbitopathy. Patients must be made aware of these deleterious effects and encouraged to quit smoking.",

    "111": "CHF was induced by rapid ventricular pacing in rabbits. Left ventricular function was assessed by echocardiography. Monophasic action potentials (MAPs) showed a prolongation of repolarization in CHF after atrioventricular block and stimulation at different cycle lengths. Sotalol (100 \u03bcM, n = 13) or veratridine (0.5 \u03bcM; n = 15) resulted in a further significant increase in the MAP duration. CHF was associated with an increased dispersion of repolarization, as compared with sotalol-treated (+22 \u00b1 7 ms; P < .05) and veratridine-treated (+20 \u00b1 6 ms; P < .05) sham hearts. In the presence of a low potassium concentration, sotalol and veratridine reproducibly induced early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs). SEA0400 (1 \u03bcM), a pharmacological inhibitor of NCX, significantly shortened the MAP duration (P < .01) and reduced dispersion (P < .05). It suppressed EAD in 6 of 13 sotalol-treated failing hearts and in 9 of 10 veratridine-treated failing hearts, leading to a reduction in VT (60% in sotalol-treated failing hearts and 83% in veratridine-treated failing hearts). Simulations using a mathematical model showed a reduction in the action potential duration and the number of EADs by the NCX block in all subgroups.", 
    "112": "In an experimental model of CHF, the acute inhibition of NCX (1) reduces the MAP duration, (2) decreases dispersion of repolarization, and (3) suppresses EAD and VT. Our observations indicate for the first time that pharmacological NCX inhibition increases repolarization reserve and protects against VTs in heart failure.",

Our purpose was to review the last data concerning heart failure in NSTEMI and perform an update on the subject, with the following findings as main highlights. As Killip classes III and IV, Killip class II onset in the context of NSTEMI has also proven bad prognosis significance. Beta-blocker therapy has proven benefit to patients with Killip class II in observational studies and small trials. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy shows stronger evidence of benefit in patients with heart failure than in patients without it. Eplerenone is indicated for patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure or diabetes mellitus. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators improve survival in patients with severe ventricular dysfunction after a myocardial infarction. Cardiac resynchronization therapy indications must be carefully assessed due to the high rate of implants that do not fulfill guidelines indications. In conclusion, heart failure during a NSTEMI is a common and meaningful situation which warrants careful management and further investigation to reach stronger evidence for clinical recommendations.", 
    "114": "The well established benefits of beta-blocker therapy in chronic heart failure include improved survival and quality of life and decreased morbidity and hospitalizations. In acute heart failure, evidence supports early initiation of beta-blocker therapy within the same hospitalization. Beta-blocker therapy seldom has to be withdrawn if patients are already on this medication as maintaining beta-blockers throughout these episodes is not deleterious and increases ulterior therapeutic adhesion. Possible indications for temporarily discontinuing therapy are a worsening clinical condition or cardiogenic shock. Potential benefits of maintaining beta-blockers on mortality still have to be confirmed by larger prospective trials.",

Chronic sympathetic hyperactivity in heart failure causes sustained \u03b2-AR activation, and this can deplete Ca(2+) in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leading to ER stress and subsequent apoptosis. We tested the effect of \u03b2-AR blockers on ER stress pathway in experimental model of heart failure.",

In Sprague-Dawley rats, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure was induced by abdominal aortic constriction or isoproterenol subcutaneous injection. Oral \u03b2-AR blockers treatment was performed in therapy groups. Cardiac remodeling and left ventricular function were analyzed in rats failing hearts. After 4 or 8 weeks of banding, rats developed cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Cardiac expression of ER chaperones was significantly increased. Similar to the findings above, sustained isoproterenol infusion for 2 weeks induced cardiac hypertrophy and failure with increased ER chaperones and apoptosis in hearts. \u03b2-AR blockers treatment markedly attenuated these pathological changes and reduced ER stress and apoptosis in failing hearts. On the other hand, \u03b2-AR agonist isoproterenol induced ER stress and apoptosis in cultured cardiomyocytes. \u03b2-AR blockers largely prevented ER stress and protected myocytes against apoptosis. And \u03b2-AR blockade significantly suppressed the overactivation of CaMKII in isoproterenol-stimulated cardiomyocytes and failing hearts in rats.",

    "118": "Dysfunction at glutamatergic synapses has been proposed as a mechanism in the development of neuropathic pain. Here we sought to determine whether peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain results in functional changes to primary afferent synapses. Signs of neuropathic pain as well as an induction of glial fibrillary acidic protein in immunostained spinal cord sections 4 days after partial ligation of the sciatic nerve indicated the induction of neuropathic pain. We found that following nerve injury, no discernable change to kinetics of dl-\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) or N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) could be observed in dorsal horn (lamina I/II) neurons compared with those of na\u00efve mice. However, we did find that nerve injury was accompanied by slowed decay of the early phase of eEPSCs in the presence of glutamate transporter inhibition by the competitive nontransportable inhibitor dl-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA). Concomitantly, expression patterns for the two major glutamate transporters in the spinal cord, excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT) 1 and EAAT2, were found to be reduced at this time (4 days postinjury). We then sought to directly determine whether nerve injury results in glutamate spillover to NMDARs at dorsal horn synapses. By employing the use-dependent NMDAR blocker (\u00b1)MK-801 to block subsynaptic receptors, we found that although TBOA-induced spillover to extrasynaptic receptors trended to increased activation of these receptors after nerve injury, this was not significant compared with na\u00efve mice. Together, these results suggest the development of neuropathic pain involves subtle changes to glutamate transporter expression and function that could contribute to neuropathic pain during excessive synaptic activity.",

At baseline, 8831 patients (54% women, mean age 67 years, mean blood pressure 174/98 mmHg after placebo run-in) had neither a history of AF nor AF on ECG, and they were thus at risk of developing this condition during the study.",

Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that intake of alcohol > 10 units/week predicted new-onset AF (p = 0.010) independently of most other univariate predictors, except when also baseline serum cholesterol, serum potassium and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio were included in the model (HR = 1.60 [95% CI 0.94-2.72], p = 0.081).

The objective of the present work was to study the suitability of the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) to monitor beta-blockers and hormones in effluents and surface waters. Four sampling campaigns were carried out in French rivers (the Sa\u00f4ne, the Ardi\u00e8res, the Bourbre, and the Seine) between November 2007 and September 2008. Passive samplers were exposed in surface waters, upstream and downstream of WWTP outflows, and in effluents. Exposures lasted for up to 24 d to study the uptake kinetics directly in situ, and repeatability was assessed by exposure of triplicates. A good agreement was found between POCIS and water samples. With the exception of atenolol, beta-blockers showed a linear uptake during at least three weeks, and their sampling rates could be determined in situ. These sampling rates were then used to calculate time-weighted average concentrations of beta-blockers in the Seine River with an overall good accuracy and repeatability. Such calculations could not be performed for hormones because of their variable occurrences and low concentrations in water and POCIS. Polar organic chemical integrative sampler therefore seems to be a suitable tool for monitoring beta-blockers in surface waters impacted by WWTP effluents. Longer exposure durations would be necessary to determine the suitability of POCIS for monitoring hormones. Finally, preliminary assays on the use of several deuterated compounds as performance reference compounds showed promising results for deuterated atenolol.", 
    "135": "Heart failure (HF) is a fatal complication in many muscular dystrophy cases and has become the most common cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) since 2001. HF deaths in DMD occur in young patients and increase, along with respiratory failure, in older patients. Managing HF, therefore, is the most important component of DMD treatment. Management of HF is necessary in DMD patients of all ages because myocardial damage progresses regardless of age and disability. Electrocardiography, echocardiography, myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and natriuretic peptides are used for the diagnosis of myocardial damage and chronic HF. Tissue Doppler echocardiography is in particularly useful for early detection of minute myocardial damage and dysfunction in DMD. The first-line drugs for chronic HF are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the prognosis of DMD patients has been improved using these drugs and beta-blockers. Diuretics are added in the presence of pulmonary congestion. Digoxin is most effective at a blood level of 0.5-0.8 ng/mL because of its pharmacokinetics in DMD. Surgical treatment may be necessary in cases of intractable HF. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (biventricular pacing), a treatment with an artificial pacemaker, is indicated for cases that meet specific criteria, including HF with ventricular dyssynchrony. Applications of partial left ventriculectomy (Batista procedure) and left ventricular assist devices in muscular dystrophy are likely in the near future.",

Matrix tablets were prepared by direct compression and the effects of polymer concentration and excipients-spray dried lactose, microcrystalline cellulose and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate on the mechanical (crushing strength (CS) friability (F) and crushing strength-friability ratio (CSFR)) and drug release properties of the matrix tablets were evaluated. The drug release data were fitted into different release kinetics equations to determine the drug release mechanism(s) from the matrix tablets. The results showed that the CS and CSFR increased with increase in polymer concentration while F decreased. The ranking of CS and CSFR was HPMC > terminalia > xanthan while the ranking was reverse for F. The ranking for t(25) (i.e. time for 25% drug release) at a polymer concentration of 60% was xanthan > terminalia = HPMC. The dissolution time, t(25), of theophylline matrices was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than those of carvedilol matrix tablets. Drug release from the matrices was by swelling, diffusion and erosion. The mechanical and drug release properties of the tablets were significantly (p < 0.05) dependent on the type and concentration of polymer and excipients used with the release mechanisms varying from Fickian to anomalous. Terminalia gum compared favourably with standard polymers when used in controlled release matrices and could serve as a suitable alternative to the standard polymers in drug delivery.", 
    "137": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare adrenergically mediated arrhythmogenic disorder classically induced by exercise or emotional stress and found in structurally normal hearts. It is an important cause of cardiac syncope and sudden death in childhood. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a genetic cardiac channelopathy with known mutations involving genes affecting intracellular calcium regulation. We present a case of a 14-year-old boy who had cardiopulmonary arrest after an emotionally induced episode of CPVT while attempting to invite a girl to the school dance. Review of his presenting cardiac rhythm, induction of concerning ventricular arrhythmias during an exercise stress test, and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of CPVT. He recovered fully and was treated with \u03b2-blocker therapy and placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. In this report, we discuss this rare but important entity, including its molecular foundation, clinical presentation, basics of diagnosis, therapeutic options, and implications of genetic testing for family members.

PTH has no defining clinical features; currently it is classified as a secondary headache based on its close temporal relationship to the injury. A growing number of studies are characterizing PTH by using primary headache classifications. Moderate to severe PTH that is often disabling may be classified as migraine or probable migraine and is found in substantial numbers of individuals. Recent data from civilian adult, pediatric, and military populations all find that PTH may be more of a chronic problem than previously thought, with a prevalence of close to half of the injured population. In addition, if PTH definitions are strictly adhered to, then many cases of PTH may be missed, thus underestimating the scope of the problem. New headaches may be reported well after the 7 days required for diagnosis of PTH by the guidelines of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition. A history of headache before a head injury occurs and female gender are possible risk factors for headache after TBI. Treatment of PTH may be acute or preventive, and recommendations are made for the use of migraine-specific acute therapy when indicated. Preventive therapy may be considered when PTH is frequent, disabling, or refractory to acute therapies. Comorbid conditions should be considered when choosing an appropriate preventive therapy. The symptom of headache as a \"return to play\" or \"return to duty\" barrier must be viewed in the context of other symptoms of mild TBI.",

We tested the hypothesis that VEN and ATEN disrupt acute stress mediated glucose production in fish liver. To this end, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes were exposed in vitro to different concentrations (0, 0.1, 10, 1000 nM) of VEN or ATEN and glucose production in response to either cortisol or epinephrine (two key stress hormones) was ascertained. Both VEN and ATEN did not affect either the unstimulated or cortisol (100 ng/mL)-stimulated glucose release over a 24 h period. The acute (3 h) unstimulated glucose production by isolated hepatocytes in suspension was also not modified by ATEN, while VEN (100 and 1000 nM) reduced basal glucose release. However, ATEN, even at concentration as low as 0.01 nM completely abolished epinephrine (1 \u03bcM)-induced glucose production in trout hepatocytes. Interestingly, VEN also suppressed epinephrine-induced glucose production but only at higher concentrations (100 and 1000 nM). Neither VEN nor ATEN significantly impacted the glucose production in response to either 8-bromo-cAMP (cAMP analogue) or glucagon (a metabolic hormone that increases glucose production) stimulation. ATEN but not VEN attenuated the epinephrine-induced increase in glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) mRNA abundance in trout hepatocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that the impact of ATEN and VEN on glucose production involves inhibition of \u03b2-adrenoceptor signaling in trout hepatocytes. Overall, VEN and ATEN are beta-blockers and may disrupt the adaptive acute glucose response to a secondary stressor in rainbow trout.",

SHR and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats were randomly assigned to one of six groups: SHR treated with NEB (1 mg/kg/day, intragastric); SHR treated with HCTZ (5 mg/kg/day, intragastric); SHR treated with NEB plus HCTZ (1 + 2.5 mg/kg/day); SHR treated with NEB plus HCTZ (1 + 5 mg/kg/day), along with a SHR and a WKY control group. The effects of NEB and HCTZ on clinical chemistry parameters and on cardiac function and structure were evaluated. NEB and HCTZ in combination had synergistic antihypertensive effects and significantly reduced heart rate and blood pressure compared with monotherapy with either agent. These effects were independent of water intake, urine output and electrolyte excretion. NEB plus HCTZ was associated with reduced oxidative stress in terms of glutathione availability, lower angiotensin I levels as index of plasma renin activity and reduced clearance of urinary sodium compared with HCTZ alone. Cardiac morphometric data and antioxidant parameters indicate that NEB may influence cardiac structure by reducing hypertrophy and by enhancing the availability of endothelial nitric oxide - a unique characteristic of NEB. The authors suggest that a combination of NEB and HCTZ for the treatment of hypertension may be useful for the synergistic characteristics of both drugs.", 
    "175": "The cardiovascular effects and pharmacokinetics of carvedilol were assessed in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) animals with special focus on short-term blood pressure variability (BPV). Male SH and WKY rats were acutely treated with vehicle or carvedilol 1 or 5\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) (i.v.), and effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and BPV were recorded. Plasma pharmacokinetics of R- and S-carvedilol was studied by traditional blood sampling. Relationship between carvedilol concentrations and their hypotensive and bradycardic effects was established by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling. Short-term BPV was assessed by standard deviation of BP recording. Vascular sympatholytic activity of carvedilol was studied by estimation of drug effects on ratio between low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) BPV (LF/HF ratio). Although pharmacokinetic properties of carvedilol remained mainly unaffected in SH rats with regard to WKY rats, hypertensive animals showed a reduction in drug clearance of R- and S-carvedilol after administration of 1\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) compared with WKY rats. PK-PD analysis of HR changes induced by S-carvedilol showed a greater maximal bradycardic response to carvedilol in SH rats (E (max), -27.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9%; p\u2009<\u20090.05) compared with WKY group (E (max), -13.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5%).

Carvedilol induced a greater reduction of LF/HF ratio in SH rats compared with WKY rats. Short-term BPV was markedly reduced by carvedilol in WKY and SH rats. In conclusion, as a consequence of an enhanced bradycardic response and a greater vascular sympatholytic activity, carvedilol exerts a greater hypotensive response in SH rats compared with WKY animals and dramatically reduces short-term BPV.",

    "177": "The epithelial Na\u207a channels (ENaCs) are present in kidney and contribute to Na\u207a and water homeostasis. All three ENaC subunits (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3) were demonstrated in the cardiovascular regulatory centers of the rat brain, including the magnocellular neurons (MNCs) in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). However, the functional significance of ENaCs in vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) synthesizing MNCs is completely unknown. In this study, we show with immunocytochemical double-labeling that the \u03b1-ENaC is colocalized with either VP or OT in MNCs in the SON and PVN. In addition, parvocellular neurons in the dorsal, ventrolateral, and posterior subregions of the PVN (not immunoreactive to VP or OT) are also immunoreactive for \u03b1-ENaC. In contrast, immunoreactivity to \u03b2- and \u03b3-ENaC is colocalized with VP alone within the MNCs. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for a known target for ENaC expression, the mineralcorticoid receptor (MR), is colocalized with both VP and OT in MNCs. Using single-cell RT-PCR, we detected mRNA for all three ENaC subunits and MR in cDNA libraries derived from single MNCs. In whole cell voltage clamp recordings, application of the ENaC blocker benzamil reversibly reduced a steady-state inward current and decreased cell membrane conductance approximately twofold. Finally, benzamil caused membrane hyperpolarization in a majority of VP and about one-half of OT neurons in both spontaneously firing and quiet cells. These results strongly suggest the presence of functional ENaCs that may affect the firing patterns of MNCs, which ultimately control the secretion of VP and OT.", 
    "178": "Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a rare genetic ion transmembrane disorder that has been associated with multiple various genetic mutations including life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Left thorascopic sympathectomy is an effective treatment for patients who are refractory to medical therapy or who need frequent epicardial internal cardiodefibrillator intervention. Although there is substantial literature about this therapy in adults, few reports detail the outcomes in children who undergo left thorascopic sympathectomies to treat LQTS. The authors report the successful use of a left thoracic sympathectomy for the treatment of an 11-year-old girl who had persistently symptomatic LQTS, even after implantation of an automatic cardioverter-defibrillator. The patient remained clinically stable without arrhythmias through 6 months' of follow-up. The authors also reviewed the relevant literature and found that it suggests that 77% of patients will have immediate resolution of their symptoms/arrhythmias after the procedure. When the outcome definition was broadened to include patients who had only 1 or 2 cardiac episodes in the follow-up period, 88% of cases were considered successful. The results of this case study and literature review suggest that left thorascopic sympathectomy is a safe and effective approach for treating pediatric patients with LQTS.", 
    "179": "Peritoneal membrane changes over time in long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients lead to dialysis failure and increased morbidity as well as mortality. Bio-incompatable PD solution, peritonitis, and uremia are hypothesized in causing membrane damage. Fibrous organization and angiogenesis of peritoneum are crucial morphological alterations which can diminish the efficacy of exchange and cause ultrafiltration failure. Pathophysiologic mechanisms of membrane damage have been extensively studied to innovate therapeutic strategies. One of the potential mechanisms is a presence of local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by which injured peritoneal mesothelial cell-derived angiotensin-II (AII) causes activations in TGF-beta, VEGF expression, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which contributes to extracellular matrix accumulation and neoangiogenesis in submesothelial tissues. Clinical evidence of RAAS blockade on human peritoneal membrane remains under investigation and is still inconclusive but relevant data seem to demonstrate its benefit on membrane preservation. Longitudinal effect of RAAS blockade on membrane structural, functional, and clinical relationships and strategies to use angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), aldosterone antagonist, and direct renin inhibitor are an interesting field to be explored.",

Treatment recommendations for resistant hypertension include maximizing diuretic therapy by using chlorthalidone and/or adding an aldosterone antagonist. Additional recommendations include combining antihypertensive agents from different drug classes. This retrospective cohort study describes antihypertensive use in patients with resistant hypertension defined as the concurrent use of \u22654 antihypertensive agents. Claims data from the Medstat MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounter database were used to identify patients with resistant hypertension based on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes and National Drug Codes between May 1, 2008 and June 30, 2009. Of the 5 442 410 patients with hypertension in the database, 140 126 met study criteria. The most frequently prescribed antihypertensive classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (96.2%), diuretics (93.2%), calcium channel blockers (83.6%), and \u03b2-blockers (80.0%). Only 3.0% and 5.9% of patients were on chlorthalidone or an aldosterone antagonist, respectively. A total of 15.6% of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor plus angiotensin receptor blocker. Our findings demonstrate that frequently prescribed antihypertensive agents for the treatment of resistant hypertension included guideline-recommended first-line agents. However, evidence-based and recommended agents, such as chlorthalidone and aldosterone antagonists, were underused. Moreover, minimally efficacious combinations, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker, were prescribed at higher rates than evidence-based and recommended agents.", 
    "181": "Selenocysteine lyase (SCL) catalyzes the decomposition of L-selenocysteine to yield L-alanine and selenium by acting exclusively on l-selenocysteine. The X-ray structural analysis of rat SCL has demonstrated how SCL discriminates L-selenocysteine from L-cysteine on the molecular basis. SCL has been proposed to function in the recycling of the micronutrient selenium from degraded selenoproteins containing selenocysteine residues, but the role of SCL in selenium metabolism in vivo remains unclear. We here demonstrate that the (75)Se-labeling efficiency of selenoproteins with (75)Se-labeled selenoprotein P (Sepp1) as a selenium source was decreased in HeLa cells transfected with SCL siRNA as compared to the cells transfected with control siRNA. Immunocytochemical analyses showed high SCL expression in kidney and liver cells, where selenocysteine is recovered from selenoproteins. Mature testes of mice exhibited a specific staining pattern of SCL in spermatids that actively produce selenoproteins. However, SCL was weakly expressed in Sertoli cells, which receive Sepp1 and supply selenium to germ cells. These demonstrate that SCL occurs in the cells requiring selenoproteins, probably to recycle selenium derived from selenoproteins such as Sepp1.",

In vivo ocular fundus images were captured with a digital camera equipped with a special objective lens. By measuring changes in diameter of retinal arterioles in the fundus images, retinal vascular response was assessed. The systemic blood pressure and heart rate in the animals were also continuously recorded. Following blockade of \u03b2\u2081/\u03b2\u2082-adrenoceptors with propranolol, noradrenaline (0.03-3 \u03bcg/kg/min, i.v.) decreased the diameter of retinal arterioles and increased the mean blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The highest dose (3 \u03bcg/kg/min, i.v.) of noradrenaline caused a small increase in heart rate. The \u03b1(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonist RS100329 (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) and the \u03b1(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist BMY 7378 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly prevented noradrenaline-induced contraction of retinal arterioles and pressor responses whereas the \u03b1(1B)-adrenoceptor antagonist L-765314 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) did not. The \u03b1(1A)-adrenoceptor agonist, A 61603 (0.03-0.3 \u03bcg/kg/min, i.v.), also caused contractile responses of retinal arterioles and pressor responses. These responses were almost completely prevented by RS100329 (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.), but not by BMY 7378 (1 mg/kg, i.v.). These results suggest that the contractile effects of noradrenaline on retinal arterioles and peripheral resistance vessels are, at least in part, mediated by stimulation of \u03b1(1A)- and \u03b1(1D)-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, it is likely that the \u03b1\u2081-adrenoceptor subtype(s) involved in rat vascular responses are similar in both retinal and peripheral circulation.",

    "207": "We randomized 63 elderly patients (73 \u00b1 9 years, 81% men, left ventricular ejection fraction 33 \u00b1 7%) with mild to moderate CHF (54% New York Heart Assocation class II) and moderate to severe COPD (76% Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage 2). Target dose was tolerated by 31 (49%) patients and 19 (30%) patients experienced adverse events during follow-up (19% bisoprolol, 42% carvedilol, p = 0.045). Study medication had to be withdrawn in 8 (13%) patients (bisoprolol: 2 due to hypotension, 1 due to bradycardia; carvedilol: 2 due to hypotension and 1 due to wheezing, dyspnoea, and oedema, respectively). Forced expiratory volume in 1(st) second significantly increased in bisoprolol (1561 \u00b1 414 ml to 1698 \u00b1 519 ml, p = 0.046) but not carvedilol (1704 \u00b1 484 to 1734 \u00b1 548, p = 0.44) group. Both agents reduced heart rate (bisoprolol: 75 \u00b1 14 to 68 \u00b1 10, p = 0.007; carvedilol 78 \u00b1 14 to 72 \u00b1 12, p = 0.016) and had no effect on N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide.", 
    "208": "Beta blockers frequently caused adverse events, and thus 49% of patients could tolerate the target dose. Bisoprolol induced demonstrable improvement in pulmonary function and caused less adverse events.", 
    "209": "G-protein-coupled receptors have extraordinary therapeutic potential as targets for a broad spectrum of diseases. Understanding their function at the molecular level is therefore essential. A variety of crystal structures have made the investigation of the inactive receptor state possible. Recently released X-ray structures of opsin and the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR) have provided insight into the active receptor state. In addition, we have contributed to the crystal structure of an irreversible agonist-\u03b2(2) adrenoceptor complex. These extensive studies and biophysical investigations have revealed that agonist binding leads to a low-affinity conformation of the active state that is suggested to facilitate G-protein binding. The high-affinity receptor state, which promotes signal transduction, is only formed in the presence of both agonist and G-protein. Despite numerous crystal structures, it is not yet clear how ligands tune receptor dynamics and G-protein binding. We have now used molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the distinct impact of agonist and inverse agonist on receptor conformation and G-protein binding by investigating the influence of the ligands on the structure and dynamics of a complex composed of \u03b2(2)AR and the C-terminal end of the G\u03b1(s) subunit (G\u03b1CT). The simulations clearly showed that the agonist isoprenaline and the inverse agonist carazolol influence the ligand-binding site and the interaction between \u03b2(2)AR and G\u03b1CT differently. Isoprenaline induced an inward motion of helix 5, whereas carazolol blocked the rearrangement of the extracellular part of the receptor. Moreover, in the presence of isoprenaline, \u03b2(2)AR and G\u03b1CT form a stable interaction that is destabilized by carazolol.", 
    "210": "The objective of this study was to develop pH sensitive polymethacrylic acid-chitosan-polyethylene glycol (PCP) nanoparticles. This was achieved by dispersion polymerization of methacrylic acid (MAA), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and different chitosan (CS) grades in the presence of cross linking agent ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) and polymer initiator potassium persulphate. Method development was carried out by varying formulation parameters such as type of CS, ratio of PEG to CS, quantity of solvent and polymer initiator. Metoprolol (MTP) tartrate was incorporated into the nanoparticles (NPs) as a model drug. Laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies revealed that the NPs were spherical with smooth surfaces ranging in size from 190 to 450 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) findings showed the presence of amorphous MTP in PCP NPs. The MTP loading of PCP and glycol chitosan (GC) NPs varied from 10 to 45% depending on the CS grade while both types of NPs showed excellent binding efficiency on mucin from porcine stomach. The in vitro dissolution study showed pH dependent release profiles suggesting that the PCP NPs system have great potential for oral controlled drug delivery as an alternative to conventional dosage forms.", 
    "211": "We report the case of a 29-week preterm infant with PHACE (posterior fossa malformations, hemangionas, arterial anomalies, cardiac anomalies, eye anomalies) syndrome. PHACE syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder with large facial segmental hemangionas associated with anomalies of the brain, eye, heart and aorta. The hemangiomas in our patient were problematic, distorting the airway and interfering with respirations to the point of requiring mechanical ventilation. Consultation with several different centers with medical expertize in treatment of congenital hemangiomas revealed different views on the best management strategy. In this infant, the hemangiomas progressed with failure to involute despite currently recommended therapy including corticosteroids and vincristine. Therefore, the infant was treated with propranolol and had significant regression of the hemangiomas. The use of propranolol for the treatment of infantile hemangiomas is reviewed.", 
    "212": "This study investigates the efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of metoprolol tartrate (MET), a widely used \u03b2(1)-blocker, in TiO(2) suspensions of Wackherr's \"Oxyde de titane standard\" and Degussa P25. The study encompasses transformation kinetics and efficiency, identification of intermediates and reaction pathways. In the investigated range of initial concentrations (0.01-0.1 mM), the photocatalytic degradation of MET in the first stage of the reaction followed approximately a pseudo-first order kinetics. The TiO(2) Wackherr induced a significantly faster MET degradation compared to TiO(2) Degussa P25 when relatively high substrate concentrations were used. By examining the effect of ethanol as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (OH), it was shown that the reaction with OH played the main role in the photocatalytic degradation of MET. After 240 min of irradiation the reaction intermediates were almost completely mineralized to CO(2) and H(2)O, while the nitrogen was predominantly present as NH(4)(+). Reaction intermediates were studied in detail and a number of them were identified using LC-MS/MS (ESI+), which allowed the proposal of a tentative pathway for the photocatalytic transformation of MET as a function of the TiO(2) specimen.", 
    "213": "Obestatin is a recently discovered gastrointestinal peptide with established metabolic actions, which is linked to diabetes and may exert cardiovascular benefits. Here we aimed to investigate the specific effects of obestatin on vascular relaxation.", 
    "214": "Cumulative relaxation responses to obestatin peptides were assessed in rat isolated aorta and mesenteric artery (n\u2265 8) in the presence and absence of selective inhibitors. Complementary studies were performed in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC).", 
    "215": "Obestatin peptides elicited concentration-dependent relaxation in both aorta and mesenteric artery. Responses to full-length obestatin(1-23) were greater than those to obestatin(1-10) and obestatin(11-23). Obestatin(1-23)-induced relaxation was attenuated by endothelial denudation, l-NAME (NOS inhibitor), high extracellular K(+) , GDP-\u03b2-S (G-protein inhibitor), MDL-12,330A (adenylate cyclase inhibitor), wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), KN-93 (CaMKII inhibitor), ODQ (guanylate cyclase inhibitor) and iberiotoxin (BK(Ca) blocker), suggesting that it is mediated by an endothelium-dependent NO signalling cascade involving an adenylate cyclase-linked GPCR, PI3K/PKB, Ca(2+) -dependent eNOS activation, soluble guanylate cyclase and modulation of vascular smooth muscle K(+) . Supporting data from BAEC indicated that nitrite production, intracellular Ca(2+) and PKB phosphorylation were increased after exposure to obestatin(1-23). Relaxations to obestatin(1-23) were unaltered by inhibitors of candidate endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs) and combined SK(Ca) /IK(Ca) blockade, suggesting that EDHF-mediated pathways were not involved.", 
    "216": "Obestatin produces significant vascular relaxation via specific activation of endothelium-dependent NO signalling. These actions may be important in normal regulation of vascular function and are clearly relevant to diabetes, a condition characterized by endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular complications.", 
    "217": "Despite the absence of a systematic development plan, \u03b2-blockers have reached the top tier of medical therapies for chronic heart failure. The successful outcome was due to the many dedicated investigators who produced, over a 30-year period, increasing evidence that \u03b2-blocking agents should or actually did improve the natural history of dilated cardiomyopathies and heart failure. It took 20 years for supportive evidence to become undeniable, at which time in 1993 the formidable drug development resources of large pharmaceutical companies were deployed into Phase 3 trials. Success then came relatively quickly, and within 8 years multiple agents were on the market in the United States and Europe. Importantly, there is ample room to improve antiadrenergic therapy, through novel approaches exploiting the nuances of receptor biology and/or intracellular signaling, as well as through pharmacogenetic targeting."
