    "0": "The binding of propranolol with plasma proteins and erythrocytes after oral administration of 80 mg of anapriline was studied in 12 patients with hypertensive disease. The content of propranolol fraction bound to plasma proteins was on the average 0.84 +/- 0.4. It was shown that propranolol to a considerable degree is captured by erythrocytes. The ratios of the erythrocyte content of propranolol free form to the plasma content were on the average 3.72 +/- 0.92 and 2.70 +/- 1.20, respectively, 2 and 4 hours after anapriline intake. During the assessment of the pharmacological parameters it is recommended to determine the contents of the total and free forms of propranolol in the whole blood rather than in plasma.", 
    "1": "Thirty-two patients with hypertensive disease were treated with a cardioselective blocker of beta-adrenergic receptors acebutolol (\"Sectral-400\", Rhone Poulenc, France). The binding of the drug and its metabolites diacetolol to plasma proteins and erythrocytes and their excretion with the saliva were studied. The significant binding of acebutolol and diacetolol to erythrocytes was shown. The ratio of the content of the free form of these substances in erythrocytes to plasma content was on the average 1.54 +/- 0.96 for diacetolol and 1.93 +/- 1.01 for acebutolol. A good correlation of acebutolol and diacetolol contents in the saliva with their contents in plasma was found. The mean values of the protein-bound fraction were for acebutolol 0.133 +/- 0.038 and for diacetolol 0.106 +/- 0.050.", 
    "2": "Arterial hypertension and proteinuric nephropathy are common features in diabetic patients. In streptozotocin-diabetic rats, it has been possible to reduce the blood pressure and proteinuria by converting enzyme inhibitors, and so slowing the decline of kidney function. These results have been confirmed in diabetic patients affected by arterial hypertension and persistent proteinuria. However, up to now it has not been clear if these favorable renal effects are related specifically to converting enzyme inhibition. In the attempt to clarify this last point, from a practical as well as from a speculative point of view, 12 type 2 diabetic outpatients affected by mild to moderate arterial hypertension and persistent macroalbuminuria (greater than 250 mg/daily, at least on three consecutive occasions) without any other signs of renal diseases were studied. In a randomized sequence and in a double blind fashion, after a washout period of 3 weeks, the patients underwent pharmacological treatment which consisted of enalapril 20 mg o.d., chlorthalidone 12.5 mg o.d., atenolol 50 mg o.d. and placebo o.d. Each treatment lasted 45 days. Kidney function, blood pressure and heart rate were checked at the beginning and at the end of each treatment, while urinary albumin excretion was measured at the end of the 4th, 5th, and 6th week of each treatment. Blood pressure significantly decreased in a similar fashion after each active treatment, while kidney function did not change significantly. Urinary albumin excretion rate significantly decreased after enalapril and atenolol, but did not change after chlorthalidone. According to these results we can hypothesize that the inhibition of tissue angiotensin formation and its related change on the glomerular permeability, rather than renal and systemic hemodynamic features, seem to be the common mechanisms by which both enalapril as well as atenolol decrease the albuminuria in our patients.", 
    "3": "A sample of 251 Whites and 818 Non-Whites, from Curitiba (southern Brazil), was typed with a new method with the aim of estimating the frequency of the CHE1*F allele. The frequency of this allele did not differ between Whites (0.60 +/- 0.34%) and Non-Whites (0.49 +/- 0.17%), being estimated as 0.51 +/- 0.15% for the whole sample. The use of the inhibitors DL-propranolol and RO2-0683 with alpha-naphthylacetate as substrate (at 37 degrees C) was efficient for discriminating between the CHE1 U and CHE1 UF phenotypes.", 
    "4": "Mutant clones resistant to ACTH-induced desensitization of adenylyl cyclase (Y1DR) were previously isolated from the Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line. In this study, both parental Y1 cells (Y1DS) and a Y1DR mutant were transfected with a gene encoding the mouse beta 2-adrenergic receptor, and transfectants isolated from both Y1DS and Y1DR cells were shown to express beta 2-adrenergic receptors. These transfectants responded to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol with increases in adenylyl cyclase activity and steroidogenesis and changes in cell shape. The transfectants were analyzed to determine whether the Y1DR mutation was specific for ACTH-induced desensitization of adenylyl cyclase or also affected desensitization of adenylyl cyclase via the beta 2-adrenergic receptor. Treatment of intact Y1DS transfectants with isoproterenol caused a rapid desensitization of the adenylyl cyclase system to further stimulation by the beta-adrenergic agonist. Treatment of intact cells with isoproterenol did not affect ACTH-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, indicating that desensitization was agonist specific or homologous. Y1DR transfectants were resistant to the desensitizing effects of isoproterenol in intact cells as well as in cell homogenates. These results indicate that the mutation in Y1DR transfectants affects a component that is common to the pathways of isoproterenol-induced desensitization and ACTH-induced desensitization of adenylyl cyclase. As determined using the hydrophilic beta-receptor antagonist CGP-12177, isoproterenol caused a rapid sequestration of cell surface receptors in both Y1DS and Y1DR transfectants. From these results we infer that the DR phenotype does not arise from mutations affecting receptor sequestration and that receptor number does not limit the response to isoproterenol in these transfectants.", 
    "5": "Contractile responses to norepinephrine (NE), and the population of beta-adrenoceptors, were determined in gastric fundus smooth muscle from rats with diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ), and age-matched controls. Relaxation and/or contraction of fundus strips of controls and diabetics were induced by 10(-5)M NE. Responses to NE were mainly relaxation in gastric fundus isolated from controls, and contraction in fundus isolated from diabetics. Contraction was blocked by 10(-8) M prazosin and relaxation was blocked by 10(-6) M propranolol. Relaxation by isoproterenol of contraction induced by 10(-6) M acetylcholine was significantly less in fundus from diabetics than in that from controls. The number of beta-adrenoceptors, measured with [125I] iodocyanopindolol as a ligand, was significantly less in gastric fundus membrane isolated from diabetics than in that from controls, but affinity was no different. The level of plasma catecholamine was higher in diabetics than in controls. Results suggest that depression of gastric fundus relaxation and increase of contraction by NE in diabetics could be due to fewer beta-adrenoceptor binding sites caused by down-regulation by higher catecholamine level in diabetic rats.", 
    "6": "Male Wistar rats were fed a standard diet or diets supplemented with 10% butter, 10% corn oil, or 10% cod liver oil from the age of 2 mo. At 7 and 24 mo of age, the fatty acid composition of total phospholipids was determined in ventricular crude sarcolemma preparations; binding capacity and affinity (1/Kd) of [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]nitrendipine binding were also determined. The arachidonic acid level was significantly higher at 24 mo than at 7 mo of age in the membrane phospholipids in rats fed no extra fat, but in rats fed fat-supplemented diets, age had no effect. Affinity of Ca2+ channels for [3H]nitrendipine decreased significantly in all dietary groups between 7 and 24 mo of age, whereas the affinity of beta 1-receptors for [3H]dihydroalprenolol increased in corn oil-fed rats. Density of beta 1-receptors decreased significantly in corn oil- and butter-fed rats and rats fed no extra fat between 7 and 24 mo of age, whereas the density of Ca2+ channels decreased significantly in corn oil-fed rats. We conclude that the antagonist binding properties of Ca2+ channels and beta 1-adrenergic receptors in rat hearts may change with age depending on the dietary fat.", 
    "7": "1. Reserpine (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) produced gastric mucosal vasoconstriction and injury in all rats within 6 h (injury score 38.8 +/- 2.1 mm2, mean +/- SEM). Coeliac ganglionectomy or the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drug propranolol (5-15 mg/kg) did not influence these effects of reserpine, but vagotomy protected the rats against them. The alpha-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine at 5 mg/kg were protective against injury. However, a 10 mg/kg dose of either blocker was more effective (2.2 +/- 0.5 mm2 and 3 +/- 0.8 mm2, respectively, versus 38.8 +/- 2.1 mm2, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01) and a dose of 15 mg/kg afforded complete protection. 2. Methysergide, a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist, produced a dose-dependent increase in the reserpine-induced injury; a significant (P less than 0.05) increase was noted with 15 and 20 mg/kg (47.5 +/- 2.9 mm2 and 49.4 +/- 2.2 mm2, respectively, versus 38.8 +/- 2.1 mm2, mean +/- SEM). 3. The results suggest that, in the rat, reserpine causes vagal alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation producing gastric mucosal vasoconstriction and injury. 5-Hydroxytryptamine is not implicated in the mechanism of this injury and affords protection against it.", 
    "8": "The effects of a chronic treatment with L-triiodothyronine (T3; 100 mg/rat/day s.c. for 7 days) or with propylthiouracil (PTU; 50 mg/rat/day for 35 days by stomach tube) on the characteristics of alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, imipramine and GABA binding sites in different brain areas of the adult rat have been studied. T3-treatment caused an increase in the number of [3H]dihydroalprenolol and a decrease in the number of [3H]muscimol binding sites in the cerebral cortex. PTU-treatment caused a decrease in the number of [3H]prazosin, [3H]yohimbine and [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites in the cerebral cortex, while the number of [3H]imipramine binding sites was reduced in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, and increased in the hippocampus. Affinity constants were never modified. Concurrent experiments showed that the \"in vitro\" addition of T3 and PTU did not influence the binding of any of the ligands employed to control rat brain membranes. The present data further support the view that neurotransmission in the CNS is influenced by the thyroid status.", 
    "9": "Our previous studies have shown that angiotensin II (Ang II) has a dose-dependent biphasic effect on bicarbonate and sodium transport and 4-beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate can simulate the stimulatory effect of Ang II on Na+/H+ exchange in the proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) of the rat kidney. This study was designed to further investigate the possible role of phosphoinositide turnover in mediating the biphasic effect of Ang II. Rat PCT was perfused in vivo with Ringer's solution containing [3H]inulin as a volume marker. Bicarbonate flux (JHCO3) was determined by total CO2 changes between the collected fluid and the original perfusate as analyzed by microcalorimetry. Luminal perfusion with 10(-11) M Ang II or 10(-8) M 4-beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate stimulated both fluid reabsorption (JV) and JHCO3, these effects can be blocked by 2 x 10(-4) M 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8), a blocker of intracellular calcium mobilization. Interestingly, Ang II at 10(-9) M or 2 x 10(-4) M TMB-8 have no effect on JV or JHCO3 individually. However, JV and JHCO3 significantly decreased when PCT were perfused simultaneously with 10(-9) M Ang II and 10(-4) M 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine; whereas JV and JHCO3 significantly increased when PCT were perfused with 10(-9) M Ang II and 2 x 10(-4) M TMB-8 together. These results suggest that PKC and intracellular calcium play a critical role in mediating the biphasic effect of Ang II on bicarbonate and sodium transport in PCT.", 
    "10": "Plasma histamine, cortisol, epinephrine, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptors were measured in asthmatic patients with (n = 7) and without (n = 10) nocturnal asthma at 4 PM and 4 AM and compared with those of normal subjects (n = 10). A twofold higher plasma histamine concentration was observed at 4 AM compared with 4 PM in all groups, with no change in plasma cortisol, epinephrine, and cAMP concentrations. At 4 AM compared with 4 PM, only patients with nocturnal asthma had a significant 33% decrease (p less than 0.05) in mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptor density, with no difference in binding affinity in all three groups. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes from patients with nocturnal asthma had significantly impaired response to isoproterenol at 4 AM (17% +/- 7.3% SEM increase in cAMP; p less than 0.05) compared with those of patients without nocturnal asthma (69.4% +/- 13.7%) and normal (80.2% +/- 21.3%) subjects. A significant change in beta-adrenergic receptor density and function occurs at night in patients with nocturnal asthma.", 
    "11": "The concentration-effect relationship of 0.25 mg intravenous timolol with and without pretreatment with 100 mg quinidine was studied in six healthy young volunteers with a randomized, double-blind, crossover study design. Blockade of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors was assessed by determining the dose ratios (DR) of isoproterenol infusions required to increase heart rate by 25 beats/min before and after timolol infusion. The logarithm of timolol concentration in plasma was linearly related to the logarithm (DR-1) of isoproterenol infusion, with a mean Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89 +/- 0.11 (+/- SD; n = 24) at timolol concentrations well below 1 ng/ml. The increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and norepinephrine plasma levels caused by isoproterenol infusions were attenuated after timolol. Quinidine administration increased timolol plasma levels and cardiac beta-blocking effects by 10% to 40%. It was concluded that timolol at concentrations below 1 ng/ml in plasma competitively antagonizes cardiac and noncardiac effects of isoproterenol infusions. Timolol effects are augmented after quinidine administration. The beta-blockade occurring at low plasma levels can explain side effects and actions of ocularly applied timolol.", 
    "12": "Biochemical studies of K+ efflux from rat pinealocytes revealed for the first time that norepinephrine (NE) increases 86Rb+ and 42K+ efflux. The effects of NE depend upon concurrent activation of both alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors. This effect is mediated by cAMP and Ca2+, which appear to act in conjunction to control K+ efflux; studies with charybdotoxin and tetraethylammonium indicate that a Ca2(+)-sensitive K+ channel (K(Ca] appears to be involved. Patch clamp studies identified a large conductance (approximately 100 psec) K+ channel. This study also revealed for the first time that NE treatment increases the fraction of time that this channel was open. Studies of inside-out pineal membrane patches indicated that increasing Ca2+ at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane increased the frequency of channel opening, as is typical of K(Ca) channels in this type of preparation. Outward K+ currents were almost completely blocked by tetraethylammonium (10 mM) and scorpion venom (L. quinquestriatum; 100 ng/ml). Cell-attached studies confirm that the effects of NE are mediated by intracellular second messengers. These investigations suggest that NE elevates K+ flux, probably through a large conductance K(Ca) channel, that NE acts through alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors, and that Ca2+ and cAMP act together through a biochemical \"AND\" gate to mediate the effects of receptor activation. Activation of this K(Ca) channel would have a hyperpolarizing influence and might contribute to the adrenergic hyperpolarization of pinealocytes.", 
    "13": "The influence of androgen status on the regulation of lipolysis and number of beta-adrenoceptors in isolated adipocytes was studied in male rats. Castration resulted in decreased catecholamine-induced as well as forskolin-induced lipolysis. beta-adrenoceptor number, examined by a whole cell cyanopindolol binding assay, was also diminished to a similar extent. Testosterone treatment of castrated rats normalized lipolysis as well as beta-adrenoceptor number. These results demonstrate that testosterone stimulates catecholamine-induced lipolysis in vivo by increasing the number of beta-adrenoceptors as well as the activity of adenylate cyclase, confirming previous in vitro studies performed in adipose precursor cells.", 
    "14": "The antihypertensive effects and safety profiles of lisinopril (10 to 40 mg) and atenolol (50 to 100 mg) were compared in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 144 patients with essential hypertension. After 8 weeks of therapy, seated blood pressure (BP) decreased by 26/15 mm Hg with lisinopril and by 19/14 mm Hg with atenolol. Lisinopril produced a greater reduction (p less than 0.05) in sitting systolic BP than did atenolol. Standing BP decreased by 25/15 mm Hg with lisinopril and by 19/14 mm Hg with atenolol. No important changes in hematologic and biochemical profiles were seen with either drug. Eleven patients, 7 receiving lisinopril and 4 receiving atenolol, were withdrawn because of adverse experiences; another 3 patients defaulted during treatment, 1 in the lisinopril group and 2 in the atenolol group. Both drugs were well-tolerated and are therefore suitable for first-line therapy in essential hypertension.", 
    "15": "The ethanol intake of Fawn-Hooded rats, a serotonin deficient strain, was examined under a two bottle choice between ethanol (10%) and tap water. The Fawn-Hooded rats drank as much ethanol as the alcohol preferring strain of rats (approximately 6 times that of the control Wistar rats), but drank more fluid and ate more. In general, direct and indirect serotonin agonists, reduced ethanol intake to a smaller degree in the Fawn-Hooded rats compared to the P rats. In contrast the centrally acting antimuscarinic scopolamine reduced ethanol intake to a similar degree in the two strains.", 
    "16": "The inhibition of fluid absorption (Jv) by the antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive drugs propranolol and nifedipine, which increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, was studied using the isolated rabbit proximal convoluted tubule perfused in vitro. Proximal convoluted tubules were perfused and bathed with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution containing bovine serum albumin. Jv was measured after a 30-min control period, after 40 min with either 0.1 mM propranolol or 1.0 mM nifedipine on the peritubular side and after a 40-min recovery period. Both drugs inhibited Jv (58% propranolol, and 21% nifedipine). The 40-min recovery period was sufficient to reverse the effect of nifedipine, but propranolol-treated tubules (N = 6) only reached 78% of the control Jv value. These results demonstrate that antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive drugs are powerful inhibitors of net fluid absorption by exerting a direct effect on proximal or distal tubule cells, thus acting like \"local diuretics\".", 
    "17": "The effects of extracellular calcium concentration on isovolumic relaxation, rapid filling phase, and passive properties of left ventricle, were studied in open chest dogs instrumented with ultrasonic crystals, and a miniature pressure transducer. A single dose of calcium chloride (0.025 mEq/kg/m) was administered to each dog. In another experimental group beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol 2 mg/kg) was induced before calcium administration. Diastolic function was evaluated using the time constant of the isovolumic relaxation (tau), the ratios between both +dP/dtmax and -dP/dtmax, and +dP/dt and -dP/dT at the common pressure of 35 mmHg, +dD/dtmax (as an equivalent of peak filling rate) and the chamber stiffness constant (Kc). To avoid the problem that rapid filling phase includes a portion of isovolumic relaxation, the concept of passive pressure for calculation of Kc was used. Calcium produced more increase in +dP/dtmax than in -dP/dtmax. The ratio between both maximal velocities was increased. When both velocities were examined at the common pressure of 35 mmHg, the ratio between them was not changed. tau was not changed but the asymptotic value was decreased. +dD/dtmax was increased, and Kc did not change. The same results on diastolic function of left ventricle were obtained after beta-adrenergic blockade. These data suggest that increased extracellular calcium did not alter the relaxation rate and chamber stiffness, but increased the peak filling rate and decreased the value towards left ventricular pressure decays.", 
    "18": "Fifteen adult subjects with mild to severe essential hypertension were recruited for a study to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of an adrenergic blocking agent in essential hypertension. Subjects ranged in age from 22 to 68 years. They were seen once monthly for 6 months and then were provided with medication to continue at their homes for 4 additional months. Follow-up examinations were completed in the 10th month, and all measurements were repeated. Mean blood pressure fell continuously during the treatment period, from 183 +/- 5 mm Hg (mean systolic blood pressure +/- SE), in month 1, to 117 +/- 3 mm Hg, month 10, and from 121 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean diastolic blood pressure +/- SE), month 1, to 78 +/- 1 mm Hg, month 10. Factors that appeared to affect patient compliance were free medication, free hospital visits, free transportation, open discussion with medical staff, use of a common dialect, and politeness of medical staff. These factors should be taken into consideration in evaluating the success of medication in rural communities.", 
    "19": "Intracerebroventricular administration of various doses of neuropeptide Y (NPY) to rats had different effects on their feeding behaviour: the lowest dose (100 ng) decreased food intake, but higher doses (5 micrograms) markedly increased the intake. Prazosin, a selective blocker of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, suppressed the effect induced by 5 micrograms (but not 100 ng) NPY. No such effect was observed with injections of yohimbine or propranolol. The opiate receptor antagonist, naloxone, blocked the feeding behaviour induced by 5 micrograms NPY without having any other effects on the responses induced by 100 ng NPY. The data obtained testify to heterogeneity within the NPY receptors of the central nervous system. It is concluded that the effects of high doses of NPY on feeding behaviour are mediated, at least in part, by alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "20": "Using ultrasound techniques, parameters of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function were assessed in 23 patients with degree I-II essential hypertension treated with metoprolol. Metoprolol administration was followed by increases in ejection fraction (p less than 0.01) and stroke volume (p less than 0.05), a decrease in heart rate (p less than 0.01) while cardiac output remained unchanged. Left ventricular filling was abnormal in 12 patients (52.2%). After metoprolol, the ratio of early diastolic to late diastolic transmitral velocity (E/A) rose; the increase indirectly correlated both with the baseline value of E/A (r = -0.59, p less than 0.01), and the change in heart rate (t = -0.65, p less than 0.01). Improved left ventricular diastolic filling was significant only in patients showing abnormal baseline diastolic function, and may be due to the decrease in heart rate rather than a direct effect exerted by metoprolol on the myocardium.", 
    "21": "Serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes were investigated during severe ethanol intoxication and withdrawal. Ethanol was administered intragastrically five times a day for 4 days (12 g/kg per day). 5-HT receptor subtypes were studied: (1) in severely intoxicated animals (mean blood ethanol concentration (BEC) = 4.7 g/l); (2) during the withdrawal reaction; and (3) in a control group. The maximal density of [3H] 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n- propylamino)tetralin [( 3H] 8-OH-DPAT) binding (Bmax) to 5-HT1a receptors was decreased by 25 and 17% in the hippocampus during chronic ethanol intoxication and withdrawal, respectively. [3H]Ketanserin binding to 5-HT2 receptors in the cortex, (-)[125I]-iodo-cyanopindolol [( 125I]CYP) binding to 5-HT1b receptors in the striatum and hypothalamus, and [3H] 8-OH-DPAT binding in the cortex were not affected by chronic ethanol administration. Previous in vitro experiments have shown that 5-HT1a receptors in the hippocampus are inhibitory. The down-regulation of these receptors may play a role in physical ethanol dependence, by inducing hyperexcitability of the hippocampus.", 
    "22": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a unique pharmacokinetic profile providing advantages over other therapies of its kind. It has been shown to possess high oral absorption, long elimination half-life, smooth onset of action and long duration of pharmacodynamic activity. These properties result in gradual vasodilation, ensuring a low incidence of vasodilatory side effects and once-daily administration. In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies a dose of 5-10 mg once daily has been established as the most efficacious dose for the treatment of angina pectoris. Amlodipine was found to increase exercise capacity significantly and reduce electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischaemia after treadmill exercise testing 24 h after administration compared with placebo in patients suffering from angina pectoris. Angina attack rate and glyceryl trinitrate consumption were also significantly reduced. Amlodipine was shown to possess comparable anti-anginal efficacy with the calcium antagonist diltiazem and the beta-blocker nadolol. In combination with beta-blockers and/or nitrates the addition of amlodipine was found to produce enhanced anti-anginal efficacy with good tolerability. Amlodipine is also effective in reducing the angina attack rate in patients with vasospastic angina. In conclusion, amlodipine is an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic agent given once daily as monotherapy or in combination with beta-blockers and/or nitrates for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and vasospastic angina.", 
    "23": "Migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC) from the media into the subendothelial space are important steps in the development of restenosing events after angioplasty; therefore a medical inhibition of this activity seems to be of clinical interest. Primary stenosing plaque material of 20 patients and restenosing plaque material of 6 patients was removed by atherectomy (Prof. H\u00f6fling, Dr. Bauriedel, Munich). For the isolation of plaque cells a mixture of Collagenase/Elastase was used. The vast majority of plaque cells was identified as smooth muscle cells by positive reaction with monoclonal antibodies against smooth muscle alpha-Actin. Propranolol (10(-4) mol/l to 10(-9) mol/l), Prednisolone (10(-3) mol/l to 10(-8) mol/l) and Etoposide (10(-4) mol/l to 10(-9) mol/l) were added to the cultures one day after seeding. After 3 days cell number and cell size distribution were analysed in a cell counter (Casy I, Sch\u00e4rfe System, Reutlingen). While Propranolol didn't change proliferative activity of SMC, Prednisolone caused a slight, but dose dependent inhibition of SMC-proliferation. Etoposid inhibited SMC-proliferation even below clinical concentrations to 50%. The local application of steroid or cytostatic agents might improve long term results after angioplasty. The clinical relevance of this 'Prescreening System' has to be evaluated by experimental and clinical studies.", 
    "24": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that has unique pharmacokinetic properties. The drug is absorbed gradually after oral administration and so produces a gradual vasodilatation, reducing the incidence of side effects such as reflex tachycardia and headache, which can be troublesome with other calcium antagonists. Amlodipine also has a long elimination half-life, which makes it suitable for use on a once-daily basis. Controlled clinical studies have confirmed that a suitable dose regimen of amlodipine for use in angina is to start with 5 mg daily and increase this to 10 mg daily if required to control symptoms. Exercise testing carried out 24 hours post dose has confirmed that once-daily doses of amlodipine provide good anti-anginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy for a full 24 hours, a vital aspect of any therapy for ischaemic heart disease. Amlodipine has been shown to have comparable anti-anginal efficacy to the beta-blocker nadolol taken once daily and the calcium antagonist diltiazem taken 3 times daily. When added to the treatment regimen of patients with uncontrolled chronic stable angina despite treatment with nitrates, beta-blockers or both, amlodipine produces improved anti-anginal efficacy. Amlodipine has also been shown to be consistently effective in patients with vasospastic angina. There has been no evidence of tolerance to the anti-anginal effects of amlodipine in formal clinical trials involving treatment for up to 26 weeks.", 
    "25": "Sleep apnea, which affects 10% of men in the mean age group, is a common illness, and arterial hypertension one of its early symptoms. For the large group of, mainly young, patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea and arterial hypertension it is important to have a drug treatment available which will effectively control blood pressure without exacerbating symptoms of sleep apnea. We studied the effects of antihypertensive agents on blood pressure, sleep and sleep apnea in a randomized double-blind study of 24 patients with a sleep apnea activity of more than 10 apnea phases per hour of sleep and arterial hypertension with diastolic blood pressure values in the sitting position greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg. Mean age was 51 (range: 33-69) years, mean body mass index 31.4 (24.9-40.6) kg/m2. The study protocol envisaged two baseline measurements in the sleep laboratory, after which the medication was administered for 8 days. On the last 2 days of the treatment, polysomnographic leads were once again recorded in the sleep laboratory. The patients received either the beta-blocker metoprolol (1 x 100 mg/day) or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril (1 x 2.5 mg/day). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were decreased by both substances as expected. Total sleep time was 358 (233-425) min vs. 332 (255-383) min in the metoprolol group and 368 (295-424) min vs. 341 (265-434) min in the cilazapril group which is statistically not different between the two groups nor between the proportions of non-REM and REM sleep.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "The core temperature of male Wistar rats was measured after local application of 5-HT (10 micrograms) or 8-OH-DPAT (5 micrograms) into the dorsal (DR) or the median raphe (MR) nuclei. The core temperature was measured by a rectal thermistor probe, 20 and 60 min after the injection procedure started. The injected volume was 0.5 microliter and injections were made by means of 31G needles, at a rate of 0.33 microliter min-1. The raphe nuclei were approached at 30 degrees in order to avoid penetration of the cerebral aqueduct or to avoid the DR with injections aimed for the MR. The application of 5-HT or the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT into the DR produced a marked decrease in core temperature, whereas injections into the MR had no effect. These results demonstrate an important role for the DR in temperature regulation in the rat. The fact that the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT produced a decrease in core temperature, together with the observation that administration of the 5-HT1 antagonist (-)pindolol antagonized the 5-HT as well as the 8-OH-DPAT-induced decrease, indicates the involvement of DR 5-HT1A receptors in rat thermoregulation.", 
    "27": "Disturbances in the fibrinolytic system have been associated with cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. In the present study the effects of an alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitor (doxazosin) and a selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker (atenolol) on the fibrinolytic system have been evaluated. Eighty four subjects with previously untreated mild to moderate hypertension and elevated serum cholesterol were randomized to receive atenolol or doxazosin in a double-blind study over 6 months. Tissue plasminogen activator(tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) were measured in citrated plasma samples before and after venous occlusion before and at the end of the study period. tPA activity after venous occlusion and tPA capacity were significantly increased after doxazosin as compared to pretreatment values. The fibrinolytic variables did not change in the atenolol group. Thus, doxazosin but not atenolol, improved the activity of the fibrinolytic system in patients with hypertension and an elevated serum cholesterol level. This effect of doxazosin warrants consideration when selecting a first-line antihypertensive drug.", 
    "28": "The open, long-term antihypertensive, hemodynamic and metabolic effects of betaxolol in combination with furosemide and minoxidil were investigated on 30 male patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension. Twenty-three patients were observed for 104 weeks, and 7 patients for 128 weeks. The patients were seen in the clinic every 4 weeks. Blood chemistries, electrocardiograms, chest x-rays and echocardiograms were done at set intervals during the study. This drug combination caused a significant and sustained decrease in arterial pressure and heart rate (p less than 0.001), a significant increase in the cardiothoracic ratio (p less than 0.05), left and right ventricular diameter in end diastole and in left ventricular mass (p less than 0.001), and had no effect on left ventricular wall thickness, interventricular septal thickness, left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial fiber shortening or metabolic functions. Clinical side effects included hypertrichosis, weight gain and edema. We conclude: (1) Single daily administration of betaxolol, furosemide and minoxidil produced a significant and sustained antihypertensive effect. (2) It caused cardiac enlargement and increased left ventricular mass without deterioration of myocardial function. (3) The clinical significance of the latter findings is not known at present time.", 
    "29": "Chemical modulation of tumor blood flow has until recently received relatively little attention as a therapeutic tool. Developments in the last few years, both in technology and in drug development, have changed this perspective. Fluorescence activated cell sorting techniques have provided evidence for the existence of acutely hypoxic cells resulting from transient fluctuations in microregional tumor blood flow in experimental tumor systems. We have used such techniques to assess the effects of three systemically administered agents, nicotinamide, flunarazine and Flusol-DA, on the amount of acute hypoxia in the SCCVII tumor. The most effective agent identified in this study is the benzamide analog nicotinamide. We suggest that compounds which modulate such hypoxia could well have a role in radiation therapy, particularly when combined with techniques which increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. The potential of tumor blood flow reduction to improve the effectiveness of bioreductive agents administered alone or in combination with radiation and/or hyperthermia, is well established in experimental systems. Further data are presented, which show that combining hydralazine and the beta-blocker propranolol can provide greater reduction in tumor blood flow than observed with hydralazine alone. Potential limitations of drug induced reduction in tumor blood flow are discussed including the possibility of inducing hypoxia in normal tissues.", 
    "30": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of chronic antihypertensive therapy with either celiprolol or atenolol on plasma lipids in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Forty-six patients with essential hypertension and a total cholesterol (TC) concentration greater than 220 mg/dl were studied. After 1 month on placebo, patients were stratified into five classes on the basis of their plasma TC levels and then randomized to receive atenolol 100 mg/day or celiprolol 400 mg/day for 1 year. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and blood samples for evaluation of TC, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) were taken before and after the placebo period, and every 6 months from the beginning of the active treatment. Celiprolol and atenolol caused similar reduction in BP. Both atenolol and celiprolol decreased TC. Atenolol significantly reduced HDL-C, while celiprolol increased it (p less than 0.01 at 12 months), and the difference between the two drugs was statistically significant in this regard. LDL-C levels were not significantly affected by atenolol, but were progressively reduced by celiprolol (p less than 0.05 at 6 months, p less than 0.01 at 12 months). TG rose under atenolol but was reduced by celiprolol (p less than 0.05). The results of this study show that the celiprolol-induced changes in plasma lipids may be favorable and suggest that, in hypertensive patients with high cholesterol levels, beta-blocker therapy with celiprolol may be effective in lowering BP without worsening the lipid profile.", 
    "31": "The efficacy and safety of doxazosin (n = 83) and atenolol (n = 81) have been compared during a 3-year period. Doxazosin (mean dose at 3 years, 5.2 mg/day) and atenolol (mean dose, 66.4 mg/day) produced a sustained and overall similar reduction in blood pressure, with no evidence of tolerance. Doxazosin decreased mean blood pressure from 158/104 mm Hg to 146/90 mm Hg; with atenolol the decrease was from 160/103 mm Hg to 144/88 mm Hg. Whereas the reduction in blood pressure with atenolol was paralleled by a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in heart rate (from a mean of 74 to 60 beats/min), doxazosin produced no clinically meaningful changes in heart rate. In contrast to atenolol, doxazosin reduced triglyceride levels by -5.9% (atenolol +22.5%), increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by +3.7% (atenolol, -11.2%), and increased the high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio by +5.9% (atenolol, -10.3%); all of these values were significantly (p less than 0.001) different from those of atenolol-treated patients. Doxazosin also reduced the calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by -3.3% (atenolol, unchanged). The adverse effect of atenolol on lipid levels apparently negated any beneficial effect of blood pressure reduction, because the calculated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk actually increased significantly. In contrast, the reduction in calculated CHD risk in the doxazosin group was statistically significant at all points during the study. The safety profile of the drugs was similar. With the added potential of the reduction in the calculated risk of CHD among hypertensive patients,doxazosin represents an appropriate first-line drug for the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "32": "Various aspects of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism have been studied in two groups of patients with mild hypertension before and after six months of treatment with either nicardipine (n = 10) or metoprolol (n = 10). A significant reduction of the arterial blood pressure was seen with both treatment regimens. Circulating plasma glucose, insulin, C peptide and triglyceride concentrations were measured at hourly intervals from 08 h 00 to 17 h 00, in patients on an isocaloric diet (35 kcalth/kg/die). Plasma glucose concentrations were unchanged and insulin and C peptide concentrations were higher in association with metoprolol treatment. In contrast, nicardipine-treated patients had similar plasma insulin, but lower plasma glucose, C peptide and triglyceride concentrations after treatment. The changes in day-long plasma glucose and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake had increased in association with metoprolol treatment and decreased following nicardipine. Finally plasma cholesterol concentrations did not change following metoprolol therapy, whereas plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in association with nicardipine treatment. The data seem to indicate that the negative effect of nicardipine on secretion of insulin is balanced by an improvement in glucose uptake.", 
    "33": "A stereospecific method for the analysis of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol in human plasma employing fluorescence detection has been developed using the homochiral derivatizing agent 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate (TAGIT). The use of fluorescence detection provided enhanced sensitivity and cleaner chromatograms for the analysis of plasma samples, when compared to UV detection. Furthermore, parameters such as TAGIT concentration, vortex time and reaction time were examined to optimize conditions for maximum derivatization recoveries. The analyses of S(-)- and R(+)-propranolol from plasma were linear over the concentration range of 2.0-200 ng ml-1, while S(-)- and R(+)-4-hydroxypropranolol were linear from 5.0 to 200 ng ml-1.", 
    "34": "The electrochemical properties of the calcium-channel blockers, nifedipine and nicardipine, and the beta-blocking agent, pindolol, have been exploited for the determination of their concentrations in plasma samples. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation was carried out on a cyanopropyl modified column and the drugs were detected in a flow-through carbon fibre microelectrode cell. The chromatographic system was coupled to a column-switching arrangement in order to perform on-line solid-phase extraction of the drugs from spiked human plasma. Preliminary investigations showed the response of the method to be linear over a range of 20-500 ng ml-1 in plasma with a limit of detection of approximately 15 ng ml-1 for each compound.", 
    "35": "It was found that pindolol reacts with Fe(III) chloride producing a green water soluble complex (1:1, v/v) with maximum absorbance at 635 nm. By applying the methods of Sommer and Job [Sommer et al., Folia, tomus XI, Chemia 7, 25, 1970] the conditional stability constant of the complex at pH = 1.70 +/- 0.02 was found to be log K' = 4.95 and the molar absorptivity of the complex to be 206 l mol-1 cm-1. Beer's law was obeyed up to a concentration of 220 mumol l-1 of pindolol. The recoveries were 98-101% (n = 7) and the detection limit was 5 micrograms ml-1. The described method was sufficiently simple, selective and sensitive to be suitable for the rapid and accurate determination of pindolol in tablets.", 
    "36": "A validated reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure employing fluorescence detection for the analysis of atenolol (Tenormin) in human whole blood is reported. The method is rapid and coupled with standard HPLC procedures leads to a sensitive, accurate and reproducible assay. The retention times of atenolol and internal standard, bamethan, are 4.4 and 6.3 min, respectively. The peak height ratio versus plasma concentration is linear over the range of 20.0-800 ng ml-1, with a detection limit below 10 ng ml-1. The mean absolute recovery of atenolol using the described assay is 90%. The inter- and intra-day accuracy and precision are within 8% of the actual values for all concentrations investigated. Furthermore, this procedure was applied to the analysis of whole blood samples from healthy subjects receiving a single 100 mg oral dose of Tenormin.", 
    "37": "3-(3-acetyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1-diethylurea (A-1354), is a synthetic intermediate of the beta-adrenergic blocker, celiprolol hydrochloride. A liquid chromatographic method has been developed and validated for the determination of bulk A-1354 and its potential impurities. High-low chromatography was used to improve the detectability of trace impurities. Enhanced chemical detectability was achieved by comparing the detector response of trace-impurity peaks from a stock sample solution (high-concentration) with the detector response for the A-1354 peak in a quantitatively diluted working sample solution (low-concentration). Chromatographic separation was achieved by gradient elution of A-1354 and its known impurities using an Ultrasphere C18 analytical column (5 microns, 250 x 4.6 mm i.d.). The gradient mobile phase components were methanol and 0.1% triethylammonium phosphate, pH = 4.0. The flow rate was 0.9 ml min-1 with UV absorbance detection at 236 nm. The method was determined to be specific, linear, precise and accurate for A-1354 and its known impurities. Known impurities of A-1354 are quantitated to 0.05% (w/w).", 
    "38": "The influence of dopamine on the motility of the caecum were studied. The experiments were carried out on 4 sheep with chronic fistulas of the caecum. The contractions of the caecum were recorded by the balloon method. Dopamine infused intravenously at a rate 29-38 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 inhibited the motility of the caecum. Dopamine infused after beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (0.5-1.0 mg.kg-1) inhibited the movements of the caecum, however administrated after domperidone (0.2-0.4 mg.kg-1) didn't change its movements. It has been concluded that dopamine inhibits the caecum motility in sheep through specific dopaminergic receptors.", 
    "39": "The results of esophageal varices treatment in two groups of patients are shown. The first group consists of 351 patients who suffered an hemorrhage and were treated with sclerosing varices during the acute period or in the intervals of bleedings. The second group consists of 90 cirrhotic patients to whom a prophylactic treatment was administered. From 67 patients treated during acute hemorrhage 6 (9%) died due to hemorrhage, 6 (9%) due to hepatic failure and 1 (1.5%) due to sepsis. The 90 cirrhotic patients with prophylactic treatment were divided in 3 groups. In the first group of 30, 15 were sclerosized and 15 did not get treatment. From the second group of 32, 16 got propranolol and 16 no treatment. In the third group of 28, 14 got propranolol and were sclerosized and 14 were not treated. In all three groups with treatment hemorrhage ceased in a statistically significative manner. Surviving was the same in the treated and non-treated groups. Most patients died due to an hepatic failure.", 
    "40": "1. Plasma renin activity was measured in non pregnant rabbits and guinea pigs under Ketamine-induced general anesthesia after pretreatment either with Propranolol or with a Placebo. Study was performed using a radio-immunoassay for angiotensin I. 2. Twenty minutes after the beginning of the observation period, renin activity in rabbits who had received Placebo alone (11.47 +/- 2.35 ng/ml/h) or associated with Ketamine (11.36 +/- 2.54 ng/ml/h) was similar. However, enzyme activity was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) when Propranolol was associated with Ketamine (3.97 +/- 0.58 ng/ml/h) or with Placebo (4.10 +/- 0.55 ng/ml/h). 3. In the same way, renin activity was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in guinea pigs without Propranolol than in those who had received this drug. 4. These findings indicate that stress induced by general anesthesia with Ketamine or by simple manipulation of animals (Placebo) was accompanied by an excessive increase in plasma renin activity. Propranolol maintained the level of this enzyme activity within normal limits.", 
    "41": "In this chapter, we will review recent findings which implicate the hepoxilins as modulators of second messenger systems in the human neutrophil. We have shown that the hepoxilins affect calcium homeostasis in the cell and that they stimulate the release of arachidonic acid and diradylglycerol but not inositol phosphate indicating a mode of action for these 12-lipoxygenase metabolites that is independent of phospholipase C activation. In fact lipid analyses indicate that the phospholipid affected by the hepoxilins is phosphatidyl choline, and that this phospholipid is hydrolyzed by a phospholipase D. These findings indicate that the hepoxilins, which are formed by the platelet as well as the neutrophil, may affect neutrophil activation through a potential cell-cell interaction in the circulation or at pathologic sites to initiate or potentiate the inflammatory process.", 
    "42": "Electrophysiological examination of hearts were performed in 35 women and 25 men aged 18-63 years (mean age 38 years) without any concurrent heart diseases, divided into two groups: with PMVP (group I--40 subjects) and patients without this valvular anomaly (group II--20 subjects). In the patients with PMVP the examination revealed a significantly more frequent occurrence of the so-called \"electrophysiological anomalies\" (in 67.5%). The following appeared most frequently: sinus automatism disorders (32.5%), accessory a-v pathways (32.5%), longitudinal a-v node dissection (20%), and disorders of intracardiac conduction in segments: proximal (15%), distal (7.5%) and in both (5%). The implementation of pharmacological tests (with ajmalin, propranolol and atropine) made it possible to detect, in group with PMVP, the existence of occult conduction disturbances, particularly in distal segments of the conduction system (10%), and also to estimate exactly the character of the sinus node dysfunction (the background being in 7 patients functional, in 6 organic). During the programmed heart stimulation supraventricular dysrhythmias were evoked in 17 patients with PMVP. This is a proof that there is increased predisposition for paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias to occur in patients with mitral valve anomaly.", 
    "43": "The effect of piperine on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of propranolol and theophylline has been examined in a crossover study. Six subjects in each group received a single oral dose of propranolol 40 mg or theophylline (150 mg) alone or in combination with piperine 20 mg daily for 7 days. An earlier tmax and a higher Cmax and AUC were observed in the subjects who received piperine and propranolol. It produced a higher Cmax, longer elimination half-life and a higher AUC with theophylline. In clinical practice, the enhanced systemic availability of oral propranolol and theophylline could be exploited to achieve better therapeutic control and improved patient compliance.", 
    "44": "We have used systolic time intervals (STI) to measure inotrophy and chronotropy as indirect measures of the actions of noradrenaline, in order to ascertain whether the depletion of cardiac noradrenaline stores which has been shown to occur in laboratory rats after chronic verapamil treatment could be demonstrated in healthy volunteers. Placebo, verapamil, or atenolol were given by slow intravenous injection to 8 healthy volunteers and QS2I, LVETI, and PEP/LVET were measured. Verapamil pretreatment resulted in a positive inotropic state. Intravenous verapamil after oral pretreatment caused accentuated negative inotropic and chronotropic responses as compared with acute verapamil without pretreatment. We postulate that the observed initial inotropic effect may be in part due to an increase in the amount of noradrenaline available to the myocardium intrasynaptically, and that the accentuated negative response after intravenous or oral verapamil may result from a decrease in cardiac noradrenaline storage.", 
    "45": "Experimental anatomical and physiological studies have shown that noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons, which are NE-sensitive due to inhibitory adrenoceptors, send inhibitory afferents to neurons of the peri-LC alpha and the adjacent dorsal pontine reticular formation (pRF); on the other hand these tegmental neurons, which are, in part at least, cholinergic as well as cholinoceptive, send excitatory afferents to the medullary inhibitory reticulospinal (RS) system. Experiments performed in precollicular decerebrate cats indicate that these pontine structures exert a regulatory influence on posture as well as on the gain of vestibulospinal (VS) reflexes. In particular, the increased discharge of dorsal pontine reticular neurons, and the related inhibitory RS neurons induced by microinjection of cholinergic agonists into the peri-LC alpha and the adjacent pRF of one side, decreased the postural activity, but greatly increased the response gain of the ipsilateral triceps brachii in response to stimulation of labyrinth receptors resulting from roll tilt of the animal (at 0.15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees). Similar results were also obtained when the discharge of these pontine and medullary reticular neurons was raised, either by local injection into the peri-LC alpha and the dorsal pRF of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, which blocked the inhibitory influence of the noradrenergic LC neurons on these structures, or by local injection into the LC complex of an alpha 2- or beta-adrenergic agonist (clonidine or isoproterenol) which led to functional inactivation of the noradrenergic neurons; in the latter case the effects were bilateral. Just the opposite results were obtained after microinjection into the LC of a cholinergic agonist, leading to activation of the corresponding neurons. Evidence was also presented indicating that the cholinergic excitatory afferents to the LC originated from the ipsilateral dorsal pRF. The effects described above were dose-dependent and site-specific, as shown by histological controls. Under given conditions, the decrease in postural activity induced either by direct activation of presumptive cholinergic and cholinoceptive pRF neurons or by inactivation of noradrenergic and NE-sensitive LC neurons was followed by transient episodes of postural atonia which lasted several minutes and affected the ipsilateral and sometimes also the contralateral limbs. In these instances, the EMG modulation of the corresponding triceps brachii to animal tilt was suppressed. These findings suggest two different ranges of operation for the noradrenergic and cholinergic structures located in the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum, leading either to a decrease or to an increase in gain of the VS reflexes. The cellular basis of these gain changes is discussed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "46": "We have studied the stereochemistry of accumulation of the hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist rac-atenolol by human platelets in vitro. The accumulation was slow, not reaching equilibrium until 90 min at 37 degrees C. The uptake was temperature dependent with the accumulation at 37 degrees C being 3-4 times greater than at 4 degrees C. The accumulation was also stereoselective at 37 degrees C, favoring the active (-)-enantiomer over the (+)-enantiomer by 2.3-fold. Reserpine, but not desipramine, inhibited the platelet accumulation of rac-atenolol enantiospecifically. This uptake profile is different from the platelet uptake of lipophilic beta-blockers, which is characterized by nonspecific membrane binding, but similar to the carrier-mediated accumulation of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine by storage granules within the platelet.", 
    "47": "Standard microelectrode techniques were used to investigate the in vitro developmental electrophysiologic effects of propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone on the adult and neonatal canine Purkinje fiber. The tonic and frequency-dependent depressant effects of these compounds on Vmax and amplitude were similar in both age groups. However, the ability of these compounds to shorten repolarization parameters was more pronounced in the adult. The extent of reduction of abnormal automaticity produced by propafenone was greater in the neonate compared to the adult, and 5-hydroxypropafenone significantly reduced automaticity only in the neonate. The sensitivity of neonatal abnormal automaticity to the effects of these compounds may prove to be important if the use of these agents is to be expanded into the realm of therapy for pediatric automatic rhythms.", 
    "48": "Four pharmacons were tested on an acute portal pressure lowering effect in an experimental animal model with 25 normal and 25 rats with Thioacetamide-toxic liver cirrhosis. Invasive measurements of arterial and portal pressure were made under Hexobarbital-Sodium anaesthesia during 30 minutes after pharmacon application. The portal pressure of cirrhotic rats was under basic conditions 9.5 +/- 1.5 mm Hg and significant higher as in normal animals (5.3 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). After 10 mg/kg body mass Propranolol the portal pressure decreased in both animal groups small but not significantly over the whole measurement time. 1 mg/kg Verapamil lowered arterial middle pressure significantly, but increased portal pressure at all 15-20% in both animal groups. Application of 0.1 mg/kg Prazosin decreased the arterial middle pressure at all 5-15% and the portal pressure at all 20-30% in both study groups (both significantly). For Canrenoat-Potassium (20 mg/kg) no clear effect could by evaluated on portal pressure. The model of Thioacetamide-toxic cirrhosis of the rat offers conditions like cirrhosis in human medicine in order to study the effects of portal pressure lowering pharmacons. Propranolol and Prazosin decrease portal pressure and should by further investigated.", 
    "49": "The isolated human iris sphincter contracted with carbachol produced relaxation with an average ED50 of 1.30 x 10(-7) M for (-)-isoproterenol. The effect is sensitive to block by (-)-timolol with KB 3 x 10(-9) M. The magnitude of the average relaxation mediated by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist was only 31%. Lowering of the temperature did not potentiate the effect of (-)-isoproterenol to a significant extent. Thus, in contrast to bovine iris sphincter, where the beta-adrenoceptor mediated response of (-)-isoproterenol produces a maximum relaxation or complete mydriasis, the maximum beta-adrenoceptor mediated mydriasis of human iris may not be more than 1/3 of the maximum pupillary dilatation achieved by physiologic or pharmacologic procedures.", 
    "50": "Severe adverse reactions to propylthiouracil occur in 1-5% of patients. Three major side effects, namely agranulocytosis, hepatotoxicity and drug-induced hypersensitivity, have been described though these syndromes are not distinct entities and there can be overlaps in the clinical manifestations. The drug-induced hypersensitivity may be an immune-mediated reaction with multiorgan involvement in which a combination of polyarthritis, cutaneous vasculitis and fever is common. We report a patient with propylthiouracil-induced hypersensitivity with an unusual combination of high spiking fever, migratory polyarthritis, reversible sensorineural deafness, normochromic normocytic anaemia, leucocytosis and hepatotoxicity associated with polyclonal activation of multiple autoantibodies. This case illustrates the highly variable clinical manifestations of the syndrome. The prompt recovery upon withdrawal of the drug indicates the importance of early diagnosis.", 
    "51": "We studied the distribution of lysosomes in differentiating human muscle cells in culture treated with propranolol, leupeptin and chloroquine. Chloroquine treated cells showed a significant vacuolization and an increase of the lysosomal apparatus as assessed by cytochemical analysis of the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase and by acridine orange staining. At electron microscopic level, an increase of lysosome-like bodies and disorganization of the contractile apparatus were demonstrated in multinucleated myotubes. These alterations observed in cultured muscle cells suggest that lysosomotropic agents may be harmful.", 
    "52": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes of heart rate (HR) and sympathetic tone occurring after myocardial infarction. Male rats (200-250 g) were submitted to ligation of the anterior branches of the left coronary artery to produce infarction (INF, N = 26) or to sham surgery (SO, N = 24). Groups of animals (N = 6-8) were studied 1,3,7 and 15 days later. A group not submitted to surgical procedures was used as control (C,N = 6). Blood pressure and HR were measured in conscious unrestrained animals after cannulation of the femoral artery. Basal HR and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the C group were 336 +/- 8 beats/min (bpm) and 110 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively. Similar values were observed in SO subgroups. One day after INF, HR increased to 417 +/- 9 bpm and MAP decreased to 97 +/- 2 mmHg. While MAP was unchanged for the remainder of the study, HR progressively decreased and normal HR values (360 +/- 18 bpm) were observed two weeks after INF. The sympathetic tone, which was evaluated from the reduction of HR after propranolol (2 mg/kg, iv), was increased during the tachycardic phase after INF. HR normalization paralleled the progressive reduction of sympathetic tone. The changes in HR after coronary artery ligation in rats seem to reflect the degree of sympathetic efferent activity during infarct healing.", 
    "53": "MK-417 (sezolamide) is a topically active carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The effect of additional treatment with sezolamide 1.8% twice daily to patient already receiving timolol 0.5% twice daily was investigated. For this purpose, 12-h diurnal curves were used in a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study in 36 patients with bilateral primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who during beta blocker therapy had intraocular pressures (IOP) greater than or equal to 22 mmHg. For 15 days patients received sezolamide or placebo 10 min after 0.5% timolol given at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. On treatment day 15, this addition of sezolamide twice daily induced a further mean decrease in IOP of approximately 4 mm Hg (about 15%) at 1, 2 and 4 h and of approximately 2-3 mm Hg at 0, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after drug administration, thus demonstrating a partial additive effect of sezolamide and timolol. Thus, sezolamide may be a useful addition to the treatment of glaucoma in patients not adequately controlled by beta blocker therapy.", 
    "54": "The efficacy and safety of nadolol (N), propranolol (PP), prazosin (PS) and a diuretic (D) were studied and compared with the aid of a total systems approach in a cooperative open study with participation of 10 centers of the USSR. As many as 419 men suffering from arterial hypertension (diastolic AP 95 mm Hg) were entered into the study. After randomization the patients received one of the 4 drugs. In case the monotherapy failed, combinations of 2-3 drugs were administered. The treatment lasted one year, with a monthly control being exercised. The patients' from the study accounted for 15% including the final points which constituted 1.9%. Of these, 6 patients suffered myocardial infarctions (one with a fatal outcome) and 2 presented with cerebral circulatory disorders. 3.8% of the patients were withdrawn from the study because of the side effects of the drugs. Out of 356 patients who completed the studies, 36.8% received one, 43% two, and 20.2% three drugs by the end of the year. The protocol of the study and the results of the monotherapy were provided in Communication I. Combined therapy with two or three drugs was effective whatever the combination and brought about a 12-16% decrease of diastolic AP. The negative chronotropic effect of N exceeded that of PP. The stable effect, t. e. the effect that lasted continuously over 6 months, was seen in less that half the patients treated for a year. Therefore, N is an effective, comparatively safe and long-acting beta-blocker. As for its efficacy, it does not yield to PP or PS and compares very favourably with D. The drug can successfully be used in long-term treatment of arterial hypertension.", 
    "55": "The paper concerns a cooperative open study with participation of 10 centers of the USSR. After receiving placebo 419 men aged 30-59 years suffering from arterial hypertension (diastolic arterial pressure in the sitting position greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) were given antihypertensive drugs after randomization. The treatment was provided in accordance with a stepped scheme and was started from monotherapy with the beta-adrenoblockers nadolol or propranolol (PP), or with the indirect vasodilator prazosin (PS) or the diuretic. If monotherapy failed, the patients were administered combinations of the indicated drugs. The treatment lasted one year, with a monthly control being exercised. 356 patients completed the studies. Of these, 131 patients (36.8%) had received monotherapy toward the end of the year. During the entire year, monotherapy was provided to 48.9% of the patients who started treatment from nadolol and completed the studies, to 34.1% who started treatment from PP, to 35.5% who started treatment from PS, and only to 14.4% of the patients who started treatment from the diuretic. Comparison of the patients' group given the diuretic with all the remaining groups demonstrate the difference to be significant. By the end of the treatment with nadolol, PP and PS, the diastolic arterial pressure reduced 10-11%, whereas toward the end of monotherapy with the diuretic, it dropped 6%, with the difference being significant. In patients on monotherapy, the negative chronotropic effect of nadolol exceeded that in patients given PP. Nadolol is an effective long-acting beta-blocker. By the intensity of the antihypertensive effect the drug is not inferior to PP or PS and compares very favourably with the diuretic.", 
    "56": "Two groups of twenty patients who were to undergo a routine e.c.c.e. applied eye-drops containing timolol 0.1% or 0.5% twice daily during the week preceding their operation. A third group of twenty patients, using placebo drops, served as control. During the cataract surgery a sample of aqueous was collected. The samples from the timolol 0.1% patient group contained a significantly lower concentration of timolol than those from the timolol 0.5% patient group, but there was considerable overlap.", 
    "57": "Clinical observation of eight patients with superficial stromal precipitation of calcium phosphate is presented. In all cases the predisposing factors for the formation of these depositions were: epithelial defects and the combined use of topical dexamethasone phosphate or prednisolone phosphate with topical beta-blocking agents. In two patients the medication that gave rise to these precipitates was used without preservatives, suggesting that the medication itself and not the preservatives contribute to the deposits. Discontinuance of simultaneous administration of the steroids and beta-blocking agents prevented further formation of precipitates. The authors suggest an interaction between simultaneously given steroid and beta-blocking agents, giving rise to calcium phosphate precipitates when an epithelial defect is present which allows easy access to the superficial corneal stroma.", 
    "58": "It is known that following partial hepatectomy in the rat hyperinsulinemia evolves, yet glucose intolerance exists. This pattern could be explained by peripheral insulin insensitivity and a compensatory insulin hypersecretion. In the present study, we examined in vivo insulin secretion and sensitivity in partially hepatectomized rats. We found that the increase in plasma insulin levels during i.v. infusion of glucose (10 mg/min) was exaggerated at 1 and 3 days after partial (68%) hepatectomy (P less than 0.001) compared with that in sham-operated controls. In contrast, at days 7 and 14 the plasma insulin response to glucose was not different from that in controls. To study the in vivo insulin sensitivity, a 3-h i.v. infusion of adrenaline, propranolol, glucose, and variable amounts of insulin were given at 3 days after partial hepatectomy. In this model, the ensuing glycemia, being stable during the 3rd hour of infusion, depends on the plasma insulin levels and insulin sensitivity. It was found that the relation between plasma insulin and plasma glucose levels was not different between partially hepatectomized and sham-operated rats. This indicates the same peripheral sensitivity to insulin in these two groups. We conclude that insulin hypersecretion is already evident even at day 1 after partial hepatectomy, whereas after 7 days this hypersecretion has vanished. Furthermore, the study shows that insulin sensitivity is not altered by partial hepatectomy.", 
    "59": "Acebutolol is a beta blocking agent that induces in C57Bl/6 mice a polyclonal activation of lymphocytes (PAL). In this study, its effect on cellular parameters of spontaneous PAL and lupus disease in NZB x NZW female mice is investigated. A significant reduction of PAL is found in 10-week-old mice after only five injections of 50 mg/kg/day of acebutolol. This effect is also observed in 7- and 9-month-old mice after 12 weeks of treatment. In these chronically treated mice, a significant decrease in incidence and levels of proteinuria as compared with untreated mice is found. No statistically significant increase in survival is observed. In conclusion, acebutolol down modulates the spontaneous PAL which characterizes the NZB x NZW mouse lupus disease and might prevent to some extent the development of nephritis.", 
    "60": "Serum prolactin is increased during chronic flunarizine treatment of patients suffering from migraine. In order to clarify the role of calcium in control of the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones, a study has now been made of the effects of chronic nimodipine and propranolol treatment of migraine patients on prolactin (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH) levels. 11 patients were treated with nimodipine and 8 with propranolol for four months. A statistically significant reduction in the frequency of the attacks was demonstrated in both groups. No significant change was found in the hormones levels during nimodipine treatment.", 
    "61": "Pharmacokinetics and the degree of beta-blockade of sustained release (SR) acebutolol (500 mg/day) and conventional acebutolol (200 mg tid) were examined after the first oral dose and after 10 days of treatment in ten healthy volunteers. After the first dose, acebutolol Cmax did not significantly differ between the two formulations; however, on day 10 acebutolol Cmax was significantly higher after SR formulation. Cmax of diacetolol, the major metabolite, did not differ between SR and conventional acebutolol neither on day 1 nor on day 10. The dose-corrected relative bio-availability of acebutolol was not different from 100% on day 1 and day 10; however the dose-corrected diacetolol AUC, SR/conventional ratio, was significantly lower than 100% on days 1 and 10. Both acebutolol preparations exerted a significant reduction in exercise tachycardia over 24 h on day 1 and day 10; however, conventional acebutolol exhibited a greater reduction 24 h after the first dose. Exercise-induced increase in systolic blood pressure was similarly inhibited by both treatments except for 24 h after the first dose when systolic blood pressure was significantly higher with SR than with conventional acebutolol. The percent reduction in heart rate during exercise was linearly correlated with log acebutolol plasma concentrations for each treatment regimen. These results suggest that beta-blockade exerted by SR acebutolol in healthy volunteers is equivalent to that of conventional acebutolol.", 
    "62": "Very often, an impact on the intracellular metabolism of iodothyronines and more precisely on microsomal deiodinases is evoked to explain thyroid hormone (TH) serum level alterations occurring with numerous drugs. Among them, three at least are also known to interfere with other hepatic microsomal enzymes, amiodarone (AMI), phenobarbital (PHE) and propranolol (PRO). Starting from this statement, we have examined the effects of 5 macrolides on TH serum level and on hepatic 5' type 1 deiodinase (5'DI) in vivo in rat. Rats were treated orally for eight days either with 200 mg/kg macrolides--erythromycine (ERY), troleandomycine (TRO), josamycine (JOS), midecamycine (MID) and spiramycine (SPI)--, or with AMI (45 mg/kg), PHE (50 mg/kg) or PRO (20 mg/kg), these 3 latter drugs for comparative purpose. Total T4, T3 and rT3 were determined by RIA. Hepatic 5'DI was evaluated by measuring released radioactive iodide from a reverse T3 monolabelled with 125I used substrate. Compared to control group, ERY and TRO decreased T4 (respectively by 28 and 16%) and from these two, only TRO decreased T3 (23%). With JOS, the only major modification was an increment of T3 (26%). AMI gave a typical alteration with a high T4 (130%), a low T3 (26%) and a high rT3 (376%). 5'DI was statistically inhibited by AMI (85%), JOS (49%), TRO (43%) and ERY (35%). The other drugs showed no significant effect. So, three macrolides have both altered TH serum level and 5'DI, findings which have never been reported before. The precise mechanism of this action remains unknown and the resulting effect, being far from the one observed with AMI, tends to demonstrate, for macrolides, an absence of correlation between the extent of 5'DI inhibition and TH serum profile. Besides, comparative analysis of the results observed with macrolides, AMI, PHE and PRO argues against any relationship between 5'DI and cytochrome-P450 monooxygenases.", 
    "63": "In elderly patients, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used concomitantly with antihypertensive agents. It is therefore important to assess the potential for interactions between NSAIDs and these agents. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 40 elderly hypertensive patients treated with acebutolol or atenolol, together with frusemide, were randomized to receive either ketoprofen, 200 mg/day (50 mg q.i.d.), or matching placebo for 7 days. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were monitored for a 24-hour period at baseline and at the end of treatment. Standard sphygmomanometric measurements of blood pressure and heart rate were conducted twice a day during the study. No clinically significant side effects or blood pressure or heart rate alterations were observed during the trial. The results indicate that ketoprofen does not interfere with blood pressure control in elderly hypertensive patients being treated with a combination of beta-blockers and diuretics.", 
    "64": "In previous studies we found degradable starch microspheres (DSM) to increase the antitumor effect of adriamycin injected by the hepatic artery in rats with a liver adenocarcinoma. Increased side effects also appeared, namely body weight loss and liver necroses. In the present paper, norepinephrine in four different protocols was added to the injection of adriamycin + DSM to decrease the drug flow to normal tissues. In two protocols norepinephrine decreased the body weight loss. There was also a non-significant decrease in liver necroses but also in antitumor effect. In these experiments we also observed that some rats given adriamycin + DSM got gastric necroses. This was not found when norepinephrine was added. Addition of propranolol to norepinephrine did not decrease side effects. Vasoactive drugs may therefore be of value to diminish adverse side effects of the combination cytostatic agent + DSM, probably decreasing overspill into normal tissues.", 
    "65": "Heart rate, blood pressure, and subjective stress ratings were recorded from 36 healthy normotensive students at three points in time: during a drug-free baseline, during a baseline 2 h after ingesting single oral doses of atenolol (75 mg), metoprolol (150 mg), or lactate placebo, and during a subsequently administered mental arithmetic test. Both beta-blockers equally reduced baseline heart rate and heart rate response to arithmetic, but subjective stress rating increases to arithmetic were greater for atenolol than for placebo and metoprolol. These results are contrary to peripheral theories of anxiety regulation. While the hydrophilic atenolol barely penetrates the blood-brain barrier, the lipophilic metoprolol can exert direct CNS effects in addition to its peripheral actions. Central stress-dampening effects of lipophilic beta-blockers may override peripheral baroreceptor-mediated stress-promoting effects.", 
    "66": "Between July 1984 and March 1986, we conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing propranolol and endoscopic sclerotherapy in the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage in a group of non selected alcoholic cirrhotics. Seventy-six patients with variceal hemorrhage were randomized to receive propranolol (P) (34 patients), or sclerotherapy (S) (42 patients) approximately 12 days after initial bleeding. The 2 groups were similar as concern age, sex, etiology of cirrhosis, severity of liver failure, the number of previous hemorrhages, and the severity of initial hemorrhage. No side effects were observed in the P group; 20 patients (48 percent) in the group S had at least one side effect although minor. After an average follow-up of 36 months, 18 patients in group P (53 percent) and 23 in group S (55 percent) had hemorrhagic recurrence. Rebleeding occurred from other sources than esophageal varices in 5 patients, in the group S only. Five patients in group P and 8 patients in group S died of rebleeding. During the follow-up period, 8 patients in group P (23 percent) and 13 patients in group S (31 percent) died. No significant difference could be demonstrated between the 2 groups as regards the percentages of patients without variceal rebleeding or survival, calculated according to the Kaplan Meier method. In conclusion, in this trial, no significant difference could be demonstrated between propranolol and endoscopic sclerosis in the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage in alcoholic cirrhotic patients.", 
    "67": "The response of the pulmonary artery smooth muscle tone to ethanol, and the effects of haloperidol (a dopaminergic receptor blocker), propranolol (a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker) and verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) on the response to ethanol were studied using the dog pulmonary artery smooth muscle. The results have shown that ethanol consistently induces a dose-dependent contraction of pulmonary artery smooth muscle which is not substantially modulated by the prior administration of haloperidol, but is partially blocked by propranolol, suggesting that catecholaminergic receptors are partly involved in the mediation of the ethanol induced pulmonary artery smooth muscle contraction. However, the results of this study have shown that ethanol induced contraction of pulmonary smooth muscle is not altered by verapamil in doses which blocked the contractil response of airway smooth muscle to ethanol. Due to these studies it can be concluded that ethanol, acting directly on pulmonary vasculature, might contribute to development of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonate chronicum.", 
    "68": "Nine patients with Type I diabetes mellitus, diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 100 mmHg and persistent microalbuminuria of greater than or equal to 30 micrograms/min were treated with 50 to 100 mg atenolol daily for 3 years in an uncontrolled pilot study to assess the effect of long-term reduction of blood pressure on microalbuminuria. Treatment with atenolol prevented progression of microalbuminuria with a median (range) urinary albumin excretion rate before treatment of 74 (33 to 196) micrograms/min and 50 (5 to 123) micrograms/min after 3 years of therapy (p less than 0.05). Blood pressure was significantly reduced from 156 (121 to 187) mmHg systolic and 95 (90 to 100) mmHg diastolic before treatment to 143 (112 to 168) mmHg systolic (p less than 0.04) and 82 (66 to 84) mmHg diastolic (p less than 0.0003) at 3 years. Measurements of renal function and diabetic control remained unchanged throughout the study period. These results suggest that early and prolonged use of antihypertensive therapy is beneficial in slowing down progression of microalbuminuria.", 
    "69": "Data generated to date on the use of beta-blockers, especially atenolol, in ischaemic heart disease are reviewed and compared with the results available with the calcium antagonists. Atenolol appears to be effective as an anti-ischaemic agent in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease when reduction in myocardial oxygen supply (ischaemia not preceded by an increase in heart rate and due presumably to functional coronary stenosis) or increase in demand are the likely causes. Based on current concepts and available data, there is convincing evidence to support the use of atenolol across the spectrum of ischaemic heart disease. In contrast, results with the calcium antagonists have been disappointing and variable. Atenolol, to date, is the only beta-blocker which has been demonstrated to have a life-saving benefit in acute intervention (within 12 hours of onset) in myocardial infarction. This cardioprotective aspect of the drug is likely to be applicable to other areas of ischaemic heart disease, including silent ischaemia.", 
    "70": "One hundred and five consecutive pregnancies in 79 women affected by hyperthyroidism were observed during an 8-year period. All had received treatment either with carbimazole alone (Group I) or with the combination of carbimazole and propranolol (Group II). There were 72 pregnancies in Group I, 33 in Group II. Seventy-five pregnancies occurred whilst the mother was receiving antithyroid therapy and in the other 30 the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was made following conception. The total fetal loss was 17.1%, with a spontaneous abortion rate of 5.5% in Group I and 24.2% in Group II. No congenital malformation or maternal deaths occurred. Carbimazole is safe and effective during pregnancy. Adding propranolol offers no further advantage and may indeed be detrimental.", 
    "71": "Mitral flow was assessed by Doppler echocardiography in patients with systemic hypertension. The study was carried out on 40 patients (27 men and 13 women) aged 24-50 years, mean 43 years with essential hypertension stage II according to WHO classification. No patient had other heart disease or diabetes. All patients were randomly assigned to verapamil (20 patients) or propranolol (20 patients). The daily dose of verapamil was 60-120 mg, mean 80 mg and propranolol 120-180 mg, mean 140 mg. Pulsed Doppler studies in all patients were performed before the treatment and after 4-6 weeks of the treatment. Echocardiographic examination was performed with Hewlett-Packard 707020 A ultrasound system using 2.5 MHz transducer. Two dimensionally guided pulsed Doppler echocardiograms were recorded with sample volume positioned in the inflow area below the mitral annulus. The following Doppler parameters were measured: early diastolic flow velocity (EDF), late diastolic flow velocity (LDF) and their ratio (EDF/LDF) which represents the ratio of early and late diastolic flow velocity of left ventricular filling. The study has showed that before treatment the value of EDF, LDF and EDF/LDF ratio in both groups did not significantly differ. Heart rate and arterial pressure in patients with systemic hypertension after treatment with verapamil or propranolol were significant lower than before treatment. Treatment with verapamil caused significant increase of EDF from 61.2 to 78.2 cm/sek and increase EDF/LDF ratio from 1.02 to 1.30. While LDF values were not changed. In the group of patients treated with propranolol the values of EDF, LDF and ratio EDF/LDF were similar to those before treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "In twenty two young (mean age 31.6 years) normotensive women with hyperkinetic heart syndrome (HHS) we assessed echocardiographically left ventricular (LV) function indexes before and after 40 mg of oral propranolol. At baseline the HHS group differed from controls with respect to higher heart rate heart and diastolic blood pressure (BPs), lower systolic and systolic LV volumes, greater corrected mean circumferential fiber shortening, ejection fraction, cardiac index and contractility index (systolic blood pressure x body surface area/LV end-systolic volume ratio). Propranolol normalized nearly all analyzed indexes except for BPs which remained increased compared to controls. In young women with HHS enhanced cardiac performance is expressed by higher cardiac index and speed of blood ejection from the left ventricle, is related to tachycardia and higher contractility but not to increased preload. Results post propranolol administration speak in favour of significant role of increased beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in HHS.", 
    "73": "This study was conducted to determine the mechanisms by which angiotensin II (Ang-II) acutely increases cardiac output. Pithed Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared for continuous measurement of cardiac output by electromagnetic flowmetry. Ang-II (31-1000 ng/kg, i.v.) produced dose-related increases in cardiac output, heart rate and stroke volume. Although the heart rate increases were abolished by beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the cardiac output responses were unchanged due to an offsetting increase in stroke volume. The constancy of the cardiac output response following beta-adrenoceptor blockade suggested that Ang-II increased cardiac output by constricting venous smooth muscle and thereby increasing venous return. This conclusion is supported by the observation that Ang-II produced marked increases in left ventricular end diastolic pressure that paralleled the increases in cardiac output. In fact, based on volume loading with Tyrode's solution, the changes in left ventricular end diastolic pressure produced by Ang-II should have resulted in even greater increases in cardiac output. However, it appears that the significant rise in peripheral resistance to Ang-II tended to counter the effects of increased venous return on cardiac output. In addition, the Ang-II-induced elevations in cardiac output were not altered by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Therefore, catecholamines do not play a role in mediating the Ang-II effects. The results of this study support the conclusion that Ang-II is capable of increasing cardiac output by constriction of venous smooth muscle.", 
    "74": "Fourteen men and six women, 48-68 years old, with stable angina and effort-induced ST-segment depression (ST-D) were treated with isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) 2 x 40 mg/day and/or atenolol (AT) 100 mg/day in a double-blind randomized sequence during two 6-week periods. The patients performed ergometer tests. AT caused more decrease of heart rate at rest and at comparable work-load than IS-5-MN. Blood pressure at rest was in the normal range. Decrease of blood pressure at rest and at effort was similar with both agents. Combined administration of the two drugs was not more effective than monotherapy with AT or IS-5-MN in lowering heart rate and blood pressure. The average ST-D at comparable effort was for placebo 2.3 mm, for IS-5-MN after 2, 4, and 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 h, respectively, after medication, 1.4, 1.0, and 1.3 mm, and for AT 1.2, 1.4, and 1.4 mm, respectively. Administration of the drugs together caused additional highly significant reduction of ST-D (0.3-0.9 mm). The results indicate that IS-5-MN and AT have a similar beneficial effect on effort-induced myocardial ischemia, which is enhanced by their combined administration. The drugs alone and in combination are effective for as long as 12 h after administration of IS-5-MN, and 24 h after administration of AT. Moderate signs of tolerance to IS-5-MN were found after 6 weeks of therapy.", 
    "75": "The effects of slow-release isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN), 25 mg once daily, bupranolol, 50 mg once daily, and their combination on exercise-induced ST-segment depression at comparable work load, maximal work load, exercise capacity, frequency of anginal episodes and sublingual nitroglycerin consumption were studied in 30 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. The patients were assigned in a randomized, double blind protocol, to either form of monotherapy, for 12 days, and thereafter to combined therapy for 12 days. Exercise stress test was performed before treatment and at 2 and 16 h after drug administration on the first and 12th day of each treatment period. ST-depression at comparative work load at 2 h after dosing was reduced by 49% acutely after administration of IS-5-MN. This effect was not significantly altered after 12 days of treatment and during combined therapy. In those patients treated by bupranolol alone, an effect was observed only after 12 days - a 24% reduction in ST depression. At the 12th day of combined therapy ST-segment depression was reduced by 65%. At 16 h after dosing there was no significant reduction in mean values of ST-segment depression in either groups, but some patients in each group showed a sustained effect for 16 h. Both drugs increased maximal work load and exercise capacity at 2 h after administration. This effect was sustained in the IS-5-MN group also at 16 h after administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "A study was made of the influence of atenolol on the sinocarotid and cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflexes (BR) in patients with essential hypertension. Sinocarotid mechanoreceptors were activated by means of a cervical decompression pressure chamber. The cardiopulmonary BR was tested by changing venous return with the aid of local decompression of the lower limbs. The changes in the hemodynamic parameters were estimated by continuous recording of the mean arterial pressure (AP), tetrapolar rheography, direct manometry arterial pressure (AP), tetrapolar rheography, direct manometry (right atrium), and venous occlusion plethysmography. The drug hypotensive effect was shown to be related to modulation of the sinocarotid BR. It has been demonstrated that there is no relationship between atenolol suppression of the vasoconstrictor cardiopulmonary BR and the drug ability for AP reduction.", 
    "77": "The significance of the level of circulating 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (C16-PAF, platelet-activating factor) in relation to transient neutropenia during hemodialysis with cuprophane membranes was examined. The neutrophil count was transiently and significantly decreased at 30 min after the start of hemodialysis, and it then gradually recovered during the period from 60 to 240 min after the start. Mirror image changes were observed in the circulating levels of C3a and C5a, suggesting that the decrease in the neutrophil count was triggered by activation of the complement factors. The circulating level of C16-PAF, although being similar to the basal level after 30 min of hemodialysis, was significantly increased after 60 and 120 min of hemodialysis. These data indicate that the increase in the circulating PAF level is not a direct cause of the transient decrease in the neutrophil count, but may be the result of activated neutrophils during hemodialysis with cuprophane membranes.", 
    "78": "The effects of a nutrient solution simulating the 'ischaemic milieu' (combined hyperkalaemia, hypoxia and acidosis) on the electrical activity of rabbit isolated ventricular myocardium were examined in the absence and presence of antiarrhythmic drugs. In such a simulated ischaemia the resting membrane potential, the rate of depolarization (Vmax) and the action potential duration (APD) were all diminished with a resultant decrease in conduction and a shortening of the effective refractory period (ERP). Sotalol, a Class 3 antiarrhythmic drug (5 x 10(-6)-10(-5) M/l) afforded a marked protection against the \"ischaemic\" abbreviation of the ERP and APD. To a much lesser extent, the same applied to propafenone, a predominantly Class 1C antidysrhythmic agent (1.65-3.3 x 10(-6) M/l). The 'ischaemia'-induced depression of Vmax was increased considerably by propafenone and diminished slightly by sotalol. The results are in keeping with the efficacy of propafenone and sotalol in ventricular arrhythmias of ischaemic origin and also with the proposal that the major mechanism by which propafenone inhibits postinfarction ventricular arrhythmias is a further depression of ischaemic myocardial cells resulting in conduction block of the reentrant wave front.", 
    "79": "The association (k+1) and dissociation (k-1) rate constants, and the equilibrium thermodynamic binding parameters (delta G0, delta H0 and delta S0) of the beta-adrenergic ligand [125Iodo]cyanopindolol (ICYP) were studied in a crude lung membrane preparation of rats of different ages. There was no difference in k+1-values for the different age groups, while the k-1-values were in all cases difficult to measure: almost no dissociation of ICYP from its binding site occurs. The thermodynamic properties were not affected by age. It is concluded that, in these experimental conditions, age has no effect on the kinetic parameters of the binding of ICYP to the beta-adrenoceptors in rat lung.", 
    "80": "The effects of timolol maleate on intraocular pressure (IOP) and the severity of retinopathy induced by exposure to 80% oxygen were studied in newborn Wistar rats. One drop of timolol maleate (0.25%) instilled in each eye twice a day for the first ten days of life substantially reduced intraocular pressure without significantly modifying arterial pressure. Forty percent of the ratlings treated in this way failed to develop oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) after exposure to 80% oxygen for the first five days of life; in the other 60% OIR was less severe than that seen in an identically oxygenated group that did not receive timolol. The authors hypothesize that the pharmacologically induced reduction in IOP may have attenuated the effects of the high concentrations of oxygen on the immature retinal vessels by improving the ocular perfusion pressure. The possibility that timolol maleate also exerts a direct action on the caliber of these vessels cannot be excluded.", 
    "81": "The short-term effect of 0.8 mg/kg of an intravenous bolus of labetalol on maternal and fetal hemodynamics was investigated in ten women with pregnancy-induced hypertension. The maximum effect occurred within 35 minutes after labetalol administration. At that point, the mean arterial pressure had decreased by 18% and there was a slight decrease in maternal heart rate. As to flow velocity waveforms, no significant change was found in mean systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio of the uterine artery, umbilical artery or fetal middle cerebral artery. However, in two subjects with a marked reduction in blood pressure also the uterine artery S/D ratio decreased.", 
    "82": "A placebo controlled double blind crossover study was performed in 12 healthy volunteers to compare the cardiovascular effects of single oral doses of nifedipine (5, 10 and 15 mg) and nicardipine (20 and 30 mg) in the presence of atenolol 100 mg. Haemodynamic measurements were made by transthoracic electrical bioimpedance cardiography (TEBC) 2 h following drug administration during passive tilting, graded bicycle exercise (30-150 W) and recovery from exercise. In the absence of calcium channel blockade, atenolol reduced mean blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac index, and increased stroke volume, peripheral resistance, pre-ejection period, and ventricular ejection time, particularly during and after exercise. In comparison with atenolol alone, addition of nifedipine or nicardipine reduced peripheral resistance but did not produce significant changes in stroke volume, cardiac output, dZ/dt [max], pre-ejection period (PEP). Ventricular ejection time (VET), PEP/VET, or Heather index at any point in the experiment. Similar reductions in peripheral resistance were produced by nifedipine 10 mg and nicardipine 20 and 30 mg. These apparently equivalent doses of nifedipine and nicardipine had similar effects on stroke volume, cardiac index, PEP/VET and Heather index. Thus the increases in ventricular performance previously demonstrated in association with nifedipine and nicardipine therapy were not observed in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Under these conditions no important differences have been observed in the cardiovascular effects of these two calcium channel blockers.", 
    "83": "251 patients from 23 primary health care centres were recruited to a clinical trial in which either felodipine or placebo was added to baseline metoprolol treatment. Three methods of symptom reporting were used in 191 patients, namely two previously documented self-administered questionnaires and an adverse event monitoring system (spontaneous reports to treating physician). Higher frequencies of symptoms were seen with the questionnaires compared to spontaneous reporting. However, the overlap between the methods was moderate and they were found to complement one another. The questionnaires were completed twice during the study and the adverse event monitoring system was applied on five occasions. The rate of application had consequences for the ability of each method to detect transient, dose-related symptoms, e.g. headache and dizziness. Regardless of method, the possibility of detecting dose-related symptoms was enhanced when symptoms were measured not only during active treatment but also during a run-in or other baseline period, and both phases were considered in the analyses.", 
    "84": "Rats tested for 1 h in the Behavioral Pattern Monitor (BPM) after injection of the mixed serotonergic agonist d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) exhibit a behavioral profile similar to that produced by various hallucinogenic 5HT-2 agonists. The characteristic effects of the hallucinogens include suppression of locomotor and exploratory behavior and a preferential decrease in entries into the center of the BPM during the initial half of the test session. After LSD, the initial suppression of responding is followed by a subsequent increase in locomotor activity that is not observed with other serotonergic agonists. In the present studies, the 5HT-1 and beta-adrenergic antagonist d,l-propranolol and the 5HT-2 antagonist ritanserin were administered individually or in combination prior to the acute administration of LSD to test for the involvement of these receptor subtypes in the mediation of the effects of LSD in the BPM paradigm. Propranolol (20 mg/kg) abolished the initial suppression of activity induced by 60 micrograms/kg LSD without affecting the subsequent increase in locomotion. Conversely, 2.0 mg/kg ritanserin failed to block the initial suppressive effects of 60 or 120 micrograms/kg LSD, but attenuated the LSD-induced increases in activity during the second half of the session. The combination of propranolol and ritanserin prevented both these effects of LSD. By contrast, the more selective 5HT-2 agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) (0.27 mg/kg) produced an initial suppression of activity in the BPM that was blocked by 2.0 mg/kg ritanserin and was not followed by a subsequent increase in activity.

The pattern of hepatotoxicity observed during therapy with the vasodilator hydralazine is highly variable, often making its diagnosis difficult. Serious hepatic injury induced by the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist labetalol has only recently been reported and therefore, many clinicians may be unaware of this adverse effect. Familiarity with the clinical features and course of hydralazine- and labetalol-induced hepatic injury is necessary to ensure prompt recognition and discontinuation of the agent.",

It has been established that nifedipine crosses the placental barrier in the sheep and causes a fall in mean arterial pressure and tachycardia in both the ewe and the foetus. This paper examines the effects of nifedipine on the foetus when administered to the pregnant ewe. Catheters and electrodes were implanted by surgical procedures in 15 ewes and foetal lambs between days 118 and 122 of gestation. The redistribution of foetal blood flow was measured by the radioactive microsphere injection technique. The infusion of nifedipine caused a 9% increase in the combined ventricular output (CVO) from 446 to 509 ml/min/kg in the foetus. Foetal lung blood flow increased from 29 +/- 6 to 69 +/- 14 ml/min/kg while figures for the skeletal muscle flow were 109 +/- 34 and 141 +/- 41.6 ml/min/kg. Heart and brain blood flow, expressed as percentages of CVO showed variations of 4.3 and 5.6 percent, respectively. Blood flow in the gut, placental membranes, skin, kidney and spleen was reduced. The present results show that nifedipine, in addition to its known effects causes a redistribution of the foetal circulation.", 
    "87": "Migraine patients suffering from frequent and severe attacks may need prophylactic treatment. Propranolol, a beta-receptor blocker, and flunarizine, a calcium antagonist, are considered to be the most effective compounds for the prophylaxis of migraine. In a number of controlled studies, flunarizine has been shown to reduce the number of migraine attacks significantly. In migraine studies, sedation and weight gain are the most frequent side effects of flunarizine.", 
    "88": "Thirty-one centers in the U.K. recruited 637 patients (aged 21 to 75 years) with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95 to 115 mm Hg, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than or equal to 200 mm Hg on three occasions]. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 533 patients were randomized to receive double-blind 4 mg of lacidipine once daily (n = 268) or 50 mg of atenolol once daily (n = 265). If blood pressure was not controlled after 1 month (control = DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg, or less than or equal to 95 mm Hg if reduced by greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg from baseline), dosages were increased to 6 mg of lacidipine once daily or 100 mg of atenolol once daily. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 25 mg once daily) was added after 2 months of active treatment if required for blood pressure control. Both lacidipine and atenolol reduced blood pressure to a similar degree over the 5 months of double-blind active treatment. The reduction achieved was maintained for the duration of the open phase of the study (to month 14). The incidence of adverse events was also similar for both drugs, and serious adverse events were rare and thought to be unrelated to the study drug therapy. The results indicate that lacidipine once daily for mild-to-moderate hypertension has an efficacy and safety similar to that of atenolol."
