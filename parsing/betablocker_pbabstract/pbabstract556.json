    "0": "The 15-20% decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) seen in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after the administration of a single dose of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists atenolol, betaxolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, propranolol or sotalol was not accompanied by an increase in plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration. In marked contrast, plasma NE concentration increased by 50-75% when MAP was lowered at the same rate, and to the same extent with the vasodilator minoxidil. Atenolol, betaxolol and propranolol significantly suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA), whereas oxprenolol, pindolol and sotalol did not alter PRA significantly. Based on these observations, I conclude that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists impair the normal baroreflexly-mediated increase in plasma NE concentration which occurs in response to a decrease in MAP and this sympatho-inhibitory effect does not require the suppression of renin release.", 
    "1": "In chronic renovascular hypertension the amplifier properties of the hypertrophied heart and vessels contribute considerably more to the maintenance of the elevated blood pressure (BP) than the basic underlying cause. This must also occur in chronic primary hypertension. Accordingly, we hypothesized that after reversal of hypertrophy by antihypertensive medication the cause(s) of hypertension should be easier to detect during the redevelopment of hypertension once medication was stopped, than in the chronic phase of the disorder. We have studied three groups of patients with moderate to severe hypertension in whom BP was controlled for (1) 1 month (2) 1 year and (3) 15 months to 5 years. The rate of subsequent redevelopment of hypertension between the series was inversely related to the duration of therapy, which was mostly with beta-blockers and diuretics. Redevelopment of hypertension was slowest after obtaining regression of both vascular hypertrophy and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Preliminary findings suggest that sympathetic overactivity is present during the redevelopment phase in most patients. Our findings have suggested a new therapeutic strategy, where the effectiveness of non-pharmacological methods of controlling BP is enhanced by first causing regression of cardiovascular hypertrophy by drug treatment. Moderate regular exercise has proved to be an effective non-pharmacological antihypertensive method which has now maintained five patients at normal BP for 1 year, following an initial period of drug treatment.", 
    "2": "This review examines the effects of various antihypertensive drugs on blood lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins. A large number of studies have documented the elevation of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol with many thiazide-type diuretic drugs, albeit mainly in short term studies. When added to thiazide diuretics, both beta 1-selective and non-selective beta-blocking drugs elevate total triglycerides and VLDL triglycerides, lower high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and raise the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio. Most non-selective beta-blockers have similar effects when used as monotherapy, but the beta 1-selective agents appear not to affect HDL cholesterol in monotherapy. Prazosin appears free of adverse lipid effects and has improved lipid-lipoprotein concentrations in many studies. Preliminary data on several other drugs also suggest a favourable lipid profile and additional study is warranted - among these are guanabenz, clonidine, pindolol, labetalol, indapamide, and guanfacine. Elevations in serum triglycerides are often ignored on various counts, but triglycerides have been found to be a strong risk factor in European studies and in women over the age of 50 years in the Framingham study. Despite the unfavourable short term effects of diuretics, the theoretical risk of the lipid-lipoprotein changes remains unclear because HDL cholesterol and the total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio are often unchanged. For this and other reasons, a long term trial comparing thiazide-type diuretics with drugs with the most favourable lipid-lipoprotein profile is needed. Until this is accomplished, in most settings diuretic-based regimens are still preferred initially since they are of proven, if limited, efficacy against the cardiovascular complications of hypertension.",

    "4": "The results of exercise electrocardiography were studied in a random sample of 317 subjects with clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease. In 278 patients with coronary artery disease the rate of false negative tests was 18% with and 12% without previous myocardial infarction. If ST elevation was considered a negative response, the corresponding values were 25% and 13%, respectively, p less than 0.01. The greatest prevalence of negative tests was seen after anterior myocardial infarction: 27% or 42% when ST elevation was not included into positive responses. The sensitivity of exercise-induced ST depression for the presence of multivessel disease was lower after anterior infarction (67%) than in other patients with previous infarction (86%), p less than 0.01. The corresponding specificities were 71% and 22%, respectively, p less than 0.005. If ST elevation was included into positive responses these differences were abolished. In subjects without myocardial infarction the sensitivity was 89% and specificity 43%. Digitalized patients had somewhat higher sensitivity in the exercise electrocardiogram than those without digoxin, 90% vs. 81% (p less than 0.05), but the difference was not seen with exclusion of ST elevation. The specificity was not influenced by digitalis. beta-blockade had no effect on the sensitivity or specificity, but the prevalence of postexercise ST evolution was lower with (11%) than without (30%) beta-blockade. The prevalence of slowly ascending ST depression was reduced by three factors: the presence of digitalis in patients without previous myocardial infarction, infarction itself, and the extent of coronary artery disease. We conclude that exercise electrocardiography has only a limited value in prediction of multivessel disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Subclasses of receptors exist for most neurotransmitters. Frequently, two subtypes of receptors coexist in the same tissue and, in some cases, they mediate the same physiological response. In tissues with two classes of binding sites for a given hormone, an estimate of the proportion of each class of binding sites is obtained by inhibiting the binding of a single concentration of a radioligand with a selective unlabeled ligand. Accurate estimates of the density of each class of receptors will only be obtained, however, if the radioligand is entirely nonselective. Selectivity of just 2- to 3-fold can markedly influence the results of subtype analysis. The conclusion that a radioligand is nonselective is usually based on the results of a saturation binding curve. If Scatchard analysis of such data results in a linear plot, then it is concluded that the radioligand is nonselective. However, Scatchard analysis cannot distinguish between a radioligand that is nonselective and one that is slightly selective. The use of a slightly selective radioligand can lead to errors of 50% or more, depending on the concentration of the radioligand relative to the Kd values of the two classes of sites. A new analytical method has been developed that can be used to quantitate 2- to 3-fold differences in the affinity of two distinct classes of binding sites for a radioligand. This new approach requires that a series of inhibition experiments with a selective unlabeled ligand be performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of the radioligand. Analysis of the resulting inhibition curves, utilizing the mathematical modeling program MLAB on the PROPHET system, yields accurate estimates of the density of each class of receptor as well as the affinity of each receptor for the labeled and unlabeled ligands. This approach was used to determine whether 125I-iodopindolol shows selectivity for beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic receptors. A series of inhibition curves was generated with the unlabeled ligands ICI 89,406 (beta 1-selective) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective), using membranes prepared from C6 glioma cells. These cells contain both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. 125I-Iodopindolol was determined to be 3-fold selective for beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Since the sensitivity of this approach is superior to that of Scatchard analysis, it is likely that other radioligands, previously thought to be nonselective, will be shown to be selective when analyzed by this method.", 
    "6": "The mechanical responses produced by alpha and beta adrenergic receptor agonists were evaluated in control and myenteric neuron-ablated rat jejunal longitudinal muscle. The myenteric plexus of the jejunum was destroyed by serosal application of benzalkonium chloride (BAC). The beta adrenergic receptor agonists isoproterenol and sulfonterol produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of both control and BAC-treated jejunum. Dose-response curves obtained in control and BAC-treated jejunum were nearly superimposable regardless of the beta agonist used. Isoproterenol-induced relaxation was antagonized by the beta receptor antagonists propranolol and practolol but not by butoxamine. The alpha-1 selective agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine were more potent and efficacious in producing relaxation of control than BAC-treated jejunum. The relaxant responses of methoxamine and phenylephrine in control jejunum were blocked by prazosin but not by yohimbine. The supposed alpha-2 selective agonist clonidine also produced a concentration-dependent, prazosin-sensitive, yohimbine-resistant relaxation which was markedly greater in control than BAC-treated jejunum, consistent with alpha-1 receptor stimulation. Clonidine tested in the presence of prazosin and the alpha-2 selective receptor agonists UK-14,304, M-7 and B-HT 920 all produced a concentration-dependent contraction of control but not BAC-treated jejunum. The contractile response produced by UK-14,304 was antagonized by yohimbine but not by atropine. Our results suggest that in rat jejunal longitudinal muscle: beta adrenergic receptors mediate relaxation and are located on the smooth muscle; alpha-1 adrenergic receptors mediate relaxation and are located on both the smooth muscle and myenteric plexus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "The affinity of the beta adrenergic receptor for antagonists is frequently higher than that for agonists. It has been assumed that the binding of agonists and antagonists is diffusion limited and that the high affinity of the receptor for typical antagonists is due to slow rates of dissociation. To test this hypothesis, the kinetics of binding of unlabeled agonists and antagonists were determined using the method described by Motulsky and Mahan (Mol. Pharmacol. 25: 1-9, 1984). The time course of the binding of a radioligand in the presence of a competing unlabeled ligand was analyzed in terms of rate constants of association (kon) and dissociation (koff) for binding of the radioligand and the competitor. This approach was validated by showing that the rate constants for binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]CGP-12177 [[3H]-4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazole-2-on ] determined directly were similar to values determined when the binding of [125I]iodopindolol was measured in the presence of [3H]dihydroalprenolol or [3H]CGP-12177. Computer simulations suggested that this method was experimentally limited to competing ligands with rate constants of dissociation below approximately 0.50 min-1. The apparent rate constants for binding of four unlabeled agonists and eight antagonists were determined experimentally at 10 degrees C. Although the values of koff for agonists and antagonists were similar, the values for kon for binding of agonists were consistently lower than the values for binding of antagonists. The relatively slow rate constant for association of agonists may be explained by a two-step mechanism or may involve agonist-induced isomerization of the receptor.", 
    "8": "The adrenoceptor activity of AY-28,925 (5-[1-hydroxy-2-[(1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl)amino]ethyl]-1 H-indole-7-carboxamide) was evaluated on various isolated vascular and nonvascular tissues. Based upon pA2 values derived from either the antagonism of the effect of isoproterenol on paced guinea pig left atria (pA2 = 7.3), spontaneously beating guinea pig right atria (pA2 = 7.4) or canine saphenous vein (pA2 = 7.3), AY-28,925 demonstrated nonselective beta adrenoceptor antagonist activity. Studies using the spontaneously beating guinea pig right atria and the prostaglandin F2 alpha-contracted canine saphenous vein indicated that AY-28,925 also possessed nonselective beta-adrenoceptor intrinsic efficacy. AY-28,925 was shown to be a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist with a pA2 value which was greater against phenylephrine in the rabbit aorta (pA2 = 6.6) than against clonidine in the rat vas deferens (pA2 = 5.4) or B-HT 920 in the canine saphenous vein (pA2 = 5.3). Only in concentrations greater than 2000 times those required for adrenergic activity was AY-28,925 able to inhibit potassium chloride- or prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced contractions of the rabbit aorta. The compound had no significant negative intropic activity. These experiments indicate that AY-28,925 possesses, in decreasing orders of activity: nonselective beta-adrenoceptor properties; a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor inhibitory effect; and a nonspecific direct relaxing action on vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "9": "Exercise conditioning involves adaptations in the heart, peripheral circulation, and trained skeletal muscle that result in improved exercise capacity. Since the specific influence of beta-adrenergic stimulation on these various adaptations has not been clear, we studied the effect of beta 1-selective and nonselective beta-adrenergic blockade on the exercise conditioning response of 24 healthy, sedentary men after an intensive 6 week aerobic training program. Subjects randomly assigned to receive placebo, 50 mg bid atenolol, or 40 mg bid nadolol were tested before and after training both on and off drugs. Comparable reductions in maximal exercise heart rate occurred with atenolol and nadolol, indicating equivalent beta 1-adrenergic blockade. Vascular beta 2-adrenergic selectivity was maintained with atenolol as determined by calf plethysmography during intravenous infusion of epinephrine. All subjects trained at greater than 85% of maximal heart rate and 80% of VO2 max determined on drug. VO2 max increased after training 16 +/- 2% (p less than .05) in the placebo group and 6 +/- 2% (p less than .05) in the atenolol group, while there was no change in the nadolol group. At maximal exercise, subjects receiving placebo increased their exercise duration and oxygen pulse significantly greater than those receiving atenolol or nadolol. During submaximal exercise there were reductions in heart rate and heart rate-blood pressure product in all three groups, but these reductions were greater with placebo than with either drug. Leg blood flow during submaximal exercise decreased 24 +/- 2% (p less than .01) in the placebo group but was unchanged in the atenolol and nadolol groups. Lactates in arterialized blood during submaximal exercise were reduced equivalently in all three groups after training. Capillary/fiber ratio in vastus lateralis muscle biopsy specimens increased 31 +/- 6% in the placebo group and 21 +/- 6% in the atenolol group (both p less than .05) and tended to increase in the nadolol group. Succinic dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase activities in muscle biopsy specimens increased equivalently in all three groups, especially during submaximal exercise, these changes were less marked than that with placebo. While beta-adrenergic blockade attenuated the exercise conditioning response, skeletal muscle adaptations including increases in oxidative enzymes, capillary supply, and decreases in exercise blood lactates were unaffected. Cardiac and peripheral vascular adaptations do appear to be affected by beta-adrenergic blockade during training. Cardioselectivity does not seem to be important in modifying these effects.", 
    "10": "The cellular characteristics of the beta-adrenoreceptor in glial and neuronal cells from the newborn rat brain were determined by (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding. In membranes from both cell types, the binding was saturable and from competition assays the potency series of (-)-isoproterenol greater than (-)-epinephrine = (-)-norepinephrine greater than (+)-isoproterenol was observed. 5'-Guanylyl-imidodiphosphate reduced the affinity of (-)-isoproterenol for the beta-adrenoreceptor from glial cells but had no effect on agonist affinity in neuronal cells. Chronic treatment of both cell types with (-)-isoproterenol reduced the receptor content and the capacity of the agonist to increase the cellular cyclic AMP content. However, the receptor recovery after chronic agonist treatment was faster in glial cells (72 h) than neuronal cells (120 h) and was blocked by cycloheximide. Treatment of both types with the irreversible beta-blocker bromoacetylalprenololmentane (2 microM) reduced the receptor content by 78% but no receptor recovery was observed for 120 h after the initial receptor loss. The data indicated that the majority of beta-adrenoreceptors in both cell types are the beta-1 subtype, but show some differences in receptor-agonist interactions. Furthermore, these CNS cells may be useful models for regulatory studies on the beta-adrenoreceptor.", 
    "11": "Acute occlusions of the proximal left circumflex coronary arteriovenous pedicle were performed in open chest anaesthetised dogs. Twenty eight dogs were randomly allocated to receive acebutolol (3 mg X kg-1 twice daily) or placebo given blindly by mouth for five days; a control group of 14 dogs without any pretreatment underwent the same procedure. Coronary ligations in the randomised study were performed during seven consecutive days, and four dogs were operated on each day. This schedule was chosen in order to measure acebutolol plasma concentrations just before ligation from 60 to 540 min after the last dose of the drug. Long term oral treatment with acebutolol protected against postischaemic ventricular fibrillation and significantly reduced the incidence of both early phase (0-10 min postocclusion) ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation. As a result the outcome was significantly improved after 60 min of ischaemia in acebutolol compared with placebo treated animals. The results in the control animals were similar to those in the placebo treated dogs. The protective effect of long term oral treatment with acebutolol lasted for nine hours and was apparently independent of the plasma concentrations of the drug. These data show that improved outcome in this canine model is due to the prevention of ischaemia induced ventricular fibrillation by long term beta adrenoceptor blockade, which is able to overcome the effect, if any, of partial agonist activity of acebutolol. A direct myocardial anti-ischaemic effect might explain the effectiveness of long term oral treatment, which is independent of plasma concentrations of the drug.", 
    "12": "The direct cardiac effects of high-dose insulin (HDI) were assessed in 13 canine hearts supported by cardiopulmonary bypass. Isovolumic peak developed pressure (PDP, mmHg), coronary blood flow (CBF, ml/beat/100 g LV) and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2, ml O2/beat/100 g LV) were determined during incremental left ventricular balloon inflation before and after functional depression by beta-blockade (0.2 mg/kg propranolol) or 2 hours cardioplegic ischemia at 28 degrees C. The 2 regimens gave an overall functional reduction of 46 +/- 3% and 42 +/- 2%, respectively. The hearts were then challenged with an aortic root bolus of 1000 IU insulin. A glucose clamp was maintained at physiological levels. Insulin reversed the negative inotropic effect of propranolol to 80% of control function and normalized heart rate. Despite the significant amelioration of systolic function by HDI, MVO2 indexed for cardiac effort did not change. Neither systolic function nor heart rate was changed in the ischemically depressed hearts. In conclusion, HDI reverses the negative inotropic effect of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade without augmenting oxygen utilization. Apart from effects ascribable to systemic vasodilation and metabolic shifts, no direct cardiac inotropic stimulation can be expected on the post-ischemically depressed, nondiabetic myocardium unless there is a persistent negative effect of beta-blockers.", 
    "13": "Sotalol is a unique beta-adrenergic blocking agent with additional actions characteristic of Vaughn-Williams class III antiarrhythmic agents in experimental models. To test the efficacy of sotalol to suppress ventricular arrhythmias, a 6 week parallel, placebo-controlled out-patient study of two doses (320 and 640 mg/day, in two divided doses) was performed in four hospitals in 56 patients with chronic premature ventricular complexes at a frequency of 30/h or more (mean +/- SE, 528 +/- 60/h) on 48 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording. During a placebo week, no change occurred in arrhythmia frequency (532 +/- 76/h). Subsequent sotalol therapy significantly reduced median arrhythmia frequency in patients receiving both low (n = 19) and high (n = 18) doses compared with that in patients receiving placebo (by 77 and 83%, respectively, versus 6%; p less than 0.001). Twenty-two (59%) of 37 sotalol-treated patients, 11 in each group, reached the prospectively defined criterion of efficacy (greater than or equal to 75% arrhythmia reduction) versus 2 (11%) of 19 placebo control patients (p less than 0.001). Sotalol reduced the median frequency of couplets by 94% (p less than 0.0001) and that of runs by 89% (p less than 0.0007). The electrocardiographic effects of sotalol included reductions in heart rate (by 17 to 27%) and increases in the QTc (by 6 to 9%) and PR (by 6%) intervals. Ejection fraction was unchanged. The most common adverse side effect was fatigue, but drug discontinuation was required in only three patients taking 640 mg/day. No proarrhythmic events or biochemical abnormalities were observed. In summary, sotalol displays significant antiarrhythmic activity of moderately high degree with good tolerance in doses of both 320 and 640 mg/day. Its antiarrhythmic actions are distinguished from those reported for other beta-blockers by its effects on the QTc interval and its moderately high degree of antiarrhythmic activity.", 
    "14": "New antihypertensive agents with favorable hemodynamic and metabolic profiles have resulted in reappraisal of traditional step-care therapy using diuretics and beta blockers. Calcium channel blockers are among the new antihypertensive agents that offer better hemodynamic effect compared with beta blockers, and they do not have unwanted metabolic effects as do diuretics. Calcium channel blockers, such as nitrendipine, are effective as monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensive agents, and are particularly useful in elderly, black and low-renin patients. Preliminary results from a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel study comparing nitrendipine with propranolol in patients over 40 demonstrate similar blood pressure-lowering effectiveness; however, propranolol was associated with a higher incidence of side effects and study withdrawals. In a second study, addition of propranolol to nitrendipine monotherapy produced a further decrease in blood pressure that was sustained over the year of study. These data suggest that nitrendipine provides additional effective and safe antihypertensive therapy, which can be used in place of or in combination with beta blockers.", 
    "15": "Calcium channel blockers are highly effective antihypertensive agents and provide a good alternative to other medications used as initial or monotherapy. Although the calcium channel blockers act as peripheral vasodilators, they are unique among this group of drugs in lowering blood pressure in a sustained manner; several compensatory mechanisms are inhibited by virtue of either direct or indirect effects of these agents. In recent years, hypertension has generally been treated with a step-care approach, the limitations of which are now becoming apparent. Today, 4 classes of agents are effective and well tolerated as single therapy and might therefore be considered as first-line drug therapy: diuretics, beta blockers, converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. Preliminary results from an ongoing double-blind randomized trial comparing nitrendipine (a calcium channel blocker) and hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic) in mild to moderate hypertension will be presented. Results from 63 patients showed the 2 agents to be equivalent in antihypertensive effects and in frequency of adverse reactions. Other data indicate that when nitrendipine and hydrochlorothiazide were combined, a further decrease in blood pressure was observed. Patient characteristics affecting drug choice and clinical situations in which calcium channel blockers can be used most effectively can now often be delineated.", 
    "16": "Calcium antagonists can affect the arterial vasculature, the venous capacitance vessels and the myocardium. The net effect of these agents on left ventricular (LV) performance depends on the interaction of effects on these 3 vascular components, and the state of LV function at the time that the drugs are administered. A calcium antagonist with profound arterial vasodilator effect might favorably influence LV performance even if it had negative inotropic properties. To demonstrate the direct effect of nitrendipine, a 1,4 dihydropyridine, on LV performance, the acute hemodynamic response to oral nitrendipine was studied in 8 patients with congestive heart failure. Administration of 10 to 20 mg of nitrendipine reduced preload, caused a decrease in both pulmonary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance, produced a modest decrease in blood pressure and an increase in stroke volume. In addition, plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly decreased. Plasma renin activity also tended to decrease. These data confirm that the drug can favorably alter performance of the failing left ventricle and further suggest that the vasodilator effect is not accompanied by reflex neurohumoral stimulation.", 
    "17": "This is the era of polypharmacy.

    "18": "When rats were tested more than two weeks following surgery, lesions of the medial basal hypothalamus centered on the arcuate nucleus enhanced a form of foot-shock stress-induced analgesia (SIA) that was not blocked by injections of the opiate receptor blocker, naltrexone (6 mg/kg;). These arcuate nucleus lesions reduced the SIA produced by the same stressor when similar rats were tested 3-4 days following surgery. Finally, when similar rats were tested more than 2 weeks following surgery these lesions reduced a different form of SIA that was blocked by naltrexone. There were no effects of the lesions or naltrexone on baseline pain reactivity in any of the experiments. We suggest that arcuate nucleus lesions disrupt a system important for the elaboration of opiate-mediated SIA (Expt. 4), perhaps by damaging the brain's beta-endorphin system. In response to damage to this opioid analgesic system, we hypothesize that the damaged brain initiates time-dependent compensatory changes in an undamaged non-opioid analgesic system, resulting in enhanced non-opiate-mediated SIA.", 
    "19": "The present study examined the relative importance of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the memory modulatory effects of epinephrine. Posttraining epinephrine administration enhanced retention performance of a one-trial inhibitory avoidance response. Further pretraining injections of a variety of adrenoceptor antagonists, including selective alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta 1- and/or beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, attenuated the retention enhancing effects of posttraining epinephrine. These results suggest that alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors of both subtypes are involved in the memory-modulating effects of epinephrine.", 
    "20": "The effects of the non-selective beta-adrenergic blocking agent pindolol upon central monoaminergic neurotransmission in rats were studied by means of in vivo biochemical methods. It was found that (-)-pindolol elicited a clearcut, selective, dose-dependent and stereospecific reduction of brain 5-HT synthesis rate. The synthesis reduction was not accompanied by any change in the tissue tryptophan levels and could not be prevented by depleting the monoamine stores by means of reserpine. Furthermore, in non-pretreated animals, (-)- but not (+)-pindolol (nor the beta 1- and beta 2-selective adrenoceptor antagonists metoprolol, betaxolol and ICI 118,551) decreased the 5-HIAA level and the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio while neither enantiomer altered the concentrations of 5-HT or NA, or DA and its metabolites. It is suggested that these effects of (-)-pindolol may be due to direct stimulation of 5-HT receptors in the CNS. The action of the compound is discussed within the context of literature data indicating its ability to act as an antagonist of certain other aspects of 5-HT receptor activation. The possibility is considered that, in addition to its beta-adrenergic properties, (-)-pindolol is a mixed agonist-antagonist at central 5-HT receptors.", 
    "21": "Methods are described for the analysis of endogenous (acetoacetic and pyruvic acids) and exogenous (propranolol) compounds in plasma. Acetoacetic and pyruvic acids were converted into 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones and identified by chromatography on a normal-phase silica gel column at 360 nm. The propranolol amino group was modified with dansyl chloride and the dansyl derivative, after extraction with a hydrophobic solvent, was analysed on a normal-phase silica gel column using fluorescence detection. The method allows the determination of 0.5 ng/ml of propranolol.", 
    "22": "Bleeding from esophageal varices remains a difficult clinical problem, carrying a high likelihood both of rebleeding and of mortality. The initial approach requires adequate but not overly vigorous volume replacement with blood and other fluids. Once the patient is resuscitated, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should be performed to establish the source of bleeding. Both endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy and balloon tamponade appear to be effective in achieving temporary control of acute ongoing hemorrhage from esophageal varices. The value of intravenous vasopressin remains controversial. Rebleeding can be prevented in most patients by shunt surgery. However, surgery carries both considerable early morbidity and mortality (related mainly to the severity of the underlying liver disease) and substantial longer-term morbidity and mortality from hepatic encephalopathy and liver failure. The role of pharmacologic agents (eg, propranolol) intended to prevent variceal hemorrhage by reducing portal pressure remains to be established. At present, we recommend use of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy for the control of active variceal bleeding, with employment of balloon tamponade and intravenous vasopressin if sclerotherapy is successful. Emergency shunt surgery should be reserved only for those patients whose bleeding cannot be controlled by these other means. For prevention of rebleeding in Child class C patients, we attempt to obliterate the varices by repeated endoscopic sclerotherapy. Patients who have two to three episodes of rebleeding despite this approach are considered for shunt surgery. For better-risk patients who do not have ascites, which is difficult to control, we are currently recommending a distal splenorenal shunt. Alternatively, repeated endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy is used for these better-risk patients (Child class A or B) in some centers, with shunt surgery reserved for patients who continue to rebleed. Which approach to preventing rebleeding in the better-risk patient is more effective, as well as the role of pharmacologic therapy with propranolol or other agents, remains to be settled by well-controlled randomized clinical trials.", 
    "23": "In a prospective, randomized, single-masked, cross-over study, 18 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma were treated for one month with each of the following regimens: timolol 0.5% twice daily, timolol 0.5% plus dipivefrin 0.1% twice daily given ten minutes apart, and timolol 0.5% plus dipivefrin 0.1% given twice daily four hours apart. An eight-hour intraocular pressure curve was obtained before treatment and at the end of each monthly regimen. When added to timolol therapy, dipivefrin produced a small but statistically significant additional mean decrease in intraocular pressure. The difference in intraocular pressure reduction between the two regimens for combined timolol and dipivefrin therapy was not statistically significant.", 
    "24": "Human A431 and rat glioma C6 cells exposed to isoproterenol underwent a time- and dose-dependent loss of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Desensitization was accompanied by sequestration of beta-adrenergic receptors, which became less accessible to the hydrophilic antagonist 3H-labeled 4-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)benzimidazole-2-one hydrochloride ([3H]CGP-12177) and redistributed from the heavier density plasma membrane fraction to a lighter density membrane fraction. Prior treatment of the cells with concanavalin A or phenylarsine oxide blocked sequestration of the receptors but not desensitization of the agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase. The membranes from such pretreated cells were exposed to alkali to inactivate adenylate cyclase, and the receptors were transferred to a foreign adenylate cyclase by membrane fusion with polyethylene glycol. beta receptors from desensitized cells exhibited a reduced ability to maximally stimulate the foreign adenylate cyclase, but remained accessible to [3H]CGP-12177 in the fused membranes. When isoproterenol-treated cells were washed free of agonist, there was a time-dependent recovery of agonist responsiveness and [3H]CGP-12177-binding sites. Using the fusion technique, the receptors recovered their functional activity in the resensitized cells. In concanavalin A-treated cells, desensitization and resensitization appeared to occur in the absence of receptor sequestration. Finally, membranes from desensitized cells pretreated with concanavalin A were fused with polyethylene glycol and assayed for agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase. There was no reversal of the desensitized state. Thus, the primary, essential step in the desensitization process is a reduction in functional activity of the beta-adrenergic receptor. In contrast, sequestration of the receptors is not a prerequisite, but a secondary event during desensitization.", 
    "25": "In a single-blind prospective study, patients with hyperlipoproteinemias of the types II a, II b or IV were examined for changes of their serum lipid levels under the treatment with 300 mg celiprolol or 200 mg metoprolol, respectively, for a period of 4 weeks. Celiprolol led to a reduction of serum triglycerides, while the total cholesterol level remained practically unchanged; the HDL-cholesterol level rose from an average of 41.7 to 53.9 mg/dl (p less than or equal to 0.05). There was a slight increase of the LDL-cholesterol level and a significant decrease of the quotients between LDL- and HDL-cholesterol and between total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol. Metoprolol caused a slight increase of the serum triglycerides, the total cholesterol level remained unchanged, while the HDL-cholesterol level slightly increased from 56.7 to 59.3 mg/dl. The level of LDL-cholesterol and the quotient between LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol decreased slightly. On the contrary, the quotient between total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol remained practically unchanged. Celiprolol had a favourable influence on the serum lipid pattern, as far as the atherogenic risk is concerned.", 
    "26": "The beta-adrenergic receptor located in chick erythrocyte membranes was characterized using (-)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA) with rapid filtration techniques. The affinity of beta-adrenergic antagonist, (-)-propranolol, was approximately 100-fold higher than that of (+)-propranolol. Catecholamines were bound with the receptor in the following order, (-)-isoproterenol greater than (-)-norepinephrine greater than (-)-epinephrine, suggested the binding site to be beta 1-classification. When the membrane preparation was treated with phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C (PCase) of Clostridium perfringens or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIase) of Bacillus thuringiensis, [3H]-DHA binding was decreased to the level of 66 or 86% of the control, respectively. The treatment with sphingomyelinase C (SMase) of Bacillus cereus, however, did not cause any appreciable reduction of [3H]-DHA binding. Throughout these experiments, the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of [3H]-DHA was not influenced by phospholipases C. The affinity of isoproterenol for beta-receptor was decreased in the absence of GTP, but not altered in the presence of GTP by PIase action. Treatment with PCase or SMase, however, did not affect the affinity of isoproterenol for beta-receptor. Treatment with PIase inhibited basal, isoproterenol-stimulated and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities. On the other hand, PCase treatment inhibited only isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, but not basal and forskolin-stimulated activities. These results suggest that membrane phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), are directly related to the receptor binding and that PI interacts with adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "27": "The fluorescent calcium indicator quin2 has been used for the first continuous measurement of the effects of pharmacological agents on intracellular calcium activity in isolated, perfused rabbit hearts. The average intracellular calcium activity was elevated after the infusion of norepinephrine, concurrent with increases in left ventricular pressure and heart rate. These changes were abolished by pretreatment of the heart with phentolamine and nadolol, alpha and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists, respectively. Pretreatment with phentolamine and nadolol did not eliminate the increases in left ventricular pressure and intracellular calcium activity caused by the infusion of the monovalent carboxylic ionophores monensin and salinomycin. It is concluded that the ionophores cause these effects by elevating intracellular sodium activity, which then raises the intracellular calcium activity of the myocardium through intracellular displacement and/or transcellular exchange. It is suggested that the use of fluorescent calcium indicators in intact organs could be useful in evaluating the role of calcium in a variety of pathological states.", 
    "28": "The ability of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol to block the effects of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HT1A-selective agonists on the spontaneous firing of serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons was assessed. During microiontophoretic application, (-)- but not (+)-propranolol rapidly and reversibly blocked the suppressant effects of the 5-HT1A-selective agonists ipsapirone (TVX Q 7821) and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). However, (-)-propranolol was a relatively weak antagonist of 5-HT itself, suggesting that the endogenous neurotransmitter may have actions on dorsal raphe neurons in addition to those mediated by 5-HT1A receptors.", 
    "29": "The debrisoquine/sparteine-type polymorphism of drug oxidation presumably is caused by the absence or deficiency of cytochrome P-450 (P-450) isozyme(s). Using bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation as a prototype reaction of this polymorphism, two functionally distinct forms, P-450 buf I and P-450 buf II, with identical apparent Mr of 50,000 were purified from liver microsomes of three different human livers. P-450 buf I exhibited a marked selectivity for the (+)-enantiomer of bufuralol ((-)/(+) ratio = 0.15), P-450 buf II was nonstereoselective((-)/(+) ratio = 1.03). The Km values for (-)- and (+)-bufuralol were 31 and 54 microM with P-450 buf I and 314 and 245 microM with P-450 buf II. P-450 buf II generated two other metabolites in addition to 1'-OH-bufuralol which were not observed with P-450 buf I. Using the inhibitor quinidine, a Ki of 0.06 microM was observed with P-450 buf I as opposed to 80 microM with P-450 buf II for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation. A strong immunochemical relatedness of P-450 buf I and P-450 buf II was found since polyclonal antibodies against either form recognized the heterologous antigen to the same extent as the homologous antigen on Western blots and in immunoinhibition and in immunoprecipitation experiments. Cross-reactivity of these antibodies with a microsomal nonheme protein of unknown function (apparent Mr 50,000) also was noted. Western blots of microsomes of in vivo and in vitro phenotyped extensive and poor metabolizer individuals revealed no correlation of in vivo-determined metabolic ratio, microsomal activity, and amount of immunoreactive material. Antibodies against P-450 buf I and P-450 buf II inhibited bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation in microsomes of in vivo and in vitro phenotyped poor metabolizer individuals demonstrating that the residual activities are immunochemically related to the activities in extensive metabolizers.", 
    "30": "In a large, open-label study of 522 patients diagnosed as essential hypertensives, atenolol was both effective and well tolerated. In 392 patients whose blood pressure was measured at the initial visit and after at least four weeks of atenolol therapy, average reductions of 21 mm Hg and 14 mm Hg, were noted in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively. Forty-three patients stopped taking atenolol because of side-effects. The incidence of CNS side-effects was particularly low, and the drug was well tolerated by diabetic patients. Among eight asthmatics who took atenolol, asthma worsened in two. By virtue of its hydrophilicity, cardioselectivity and long half-life, atenolol appears to be a suitable and well-tolerated beta-blocker in the majority of patients.", 
    "31": "In conditions of stimulation of adrenergic mechanisms with ephedrine, there was an improvement of the memory engrams reproduction (MER). Blockade of the alpha-adrenergic system by pyrroxan more expressively impeded reproduction of a passive defensive habit in comparison with the action of a beta-adrenolytic, the obsidan. Stimulation of MER processes was accompanied by a parallel activation of glucose-6-phosphate- and 6-phosphategluconatedehydrogenases of pentose path in the tissues of the frontal area of the cerebral cortex and pons Varolii. Blockade of alpha-adrenoreceptors suppressed the activity of the given enzymes in the same structures, while the obsidan suppressed the dehydrogenases of the pentose path only in the frontal zone of the neocortex.", 
    "32": "Effects of chronic administration of denopamine on acute cardiovascular response to denopamine were studied in anesthetized rats. Effects of repeated treatment with isoproterenol was also investigated. The dose of denopamine to increase LV dp/dtmax by 50% of the control (ED50) was 0.77 mg/kg, p.o. Following chronic administration of denopamine once daily at 10 or 20 mg/kg, p.o., for 14 days, the effect of denopamine (i.v.) on LV dp/dtmax was similar to that in the control group. In the 40 mg/kg-group, however, the positive inotropic effect of denopamine (i.v.) was attenuated significantly at lower doses without a decrease in the maximal response and the ED50 was increased 1.8-fold. Chronic treatment with denopamine in the diet at 20 or 40 mg/kg/day for 14 days did not influence the response to the drug. By subcutaneous administration of 50 micrograms/kg isoproterenol, thrice daily for 3 days, the ED50 of isoproterenol (i.v.) for positive inotropy were increased 6.8-fold. In addition, the maximal response to isoproterenol was depressed to about 70% of that obtained in the control. In the preparation desensitized by isoproterenol (50 micrograms/kg), the inotropic response to denopamine was attenuated at lower doses, but the maximal response was not altered. In the groups desensitized by the two drugs, the positive chronotropic effect of the drugs (i.v.) tended to decrease and the effects on blood pressure was not changed. By Scatchard analysis, the specific 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding to the cardiac membranes (Bmax) was reduced in the 40 mg/kg denopamine (p.o.) group as well as in the isoproterenol-treated groups. In the 10 mg/kg denopamine and 20 mg/kg denopamine groups, however, Bmax was not changed. These results suggest that chronic administration of denopamine hardly results in desensitization of its positive inotropy at the effective doses.", 
    "33": "The effects of isoproterenol pretreatment on phosphatidylinositol turnover in rat parotid slices were studied to elucidate the relationship between beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors. 32P-Labeling of phosphatidylinositol in parotid slices was increased by an alpha 1- and alpha 2-agonist (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and alpha 1-agonists (methoxamine and phenylephrine), but not by an alpha 2-agonist (clonidine) and a beta-agonist (isoproterenol). Prazosin inhibited the increase in phosphatidylinositol turnover elicited by epinephrine, but propranolol did not. These results indicate that the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover elicited by adrenergic agonists is mediated by activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the parotid glands. Isoproterenol pretreatment of the parotid slices caused a significant increase in 32P-labeling of phosphatidylinositol and a decrease in that of phosphatidic acid. The epinephrine- or phenylephrine-induced increase in 32P-labeling of phosphatidylinositol were further enhanced by the isoproterenol pretreatment of the slices. In the isoproterenol-treated membranes of the parotid glands, [3H]prazosin binding to alpha 1-receptors increased, but [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to beta-receptors did not. These findings indicate that the acceleration of phosphatidylinositol turnover induced by the isoproterenol pretreatment may be associated with an increase in alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites which might have appeared as a result of the isoproterenol pretreatment of the parotid slices.", 
    "34": "The renal pelvis and the ureter represent a functional system with myogenic excitation generation and conduction. The activity of this system is modulated by the autonomic nervous system: alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic substances stimulate, beta-adrenergic drugs inhibit the pyeloureteral activity. Besides the sympathetic nervous system with adrenergic postganglionic excitation conduction and the parasympathetic nervous system with cholinergic transmission, non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic systems appear to exist. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), e.g., markably decreases the frequency and amplitude of the ureteral activity. Calcium antagonists (e.g. nifedipin) lead to a direct inhibition of the ureteral activity: the quick phasic contractions are selectively oppressed without any influence on the tonic activity of the pyeloureter. A direct therapeutic modulation of the ureteral activity, however, e.g. to treat a colic or to accelerate the spontaneous discharge of stones, seems to be only rarely possible: Glucagone shows a markable decrease of ureteral peristalsis in animal experiments. Antagonists of prostaglandine proved to have not only an antiinflammatory and central analgetic effect but they also influence the pyeloureter directly by relaxing the muscular layer.", 
    "35": "Binedaline (1-[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]methylamino]- 3-phenylindole) binding to human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and other serum proteins was studied in the presence of three basic compounds: chlorpromazine, propranolol, and imipramine. In serum, at therapeutic concentrations, binedaline binding was not modified by the presence of these three compounds, nor did binedaline inhibit the binding of these compounds. With isolated alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, the four drugs exhibited competitive inhibition indicating that they share a common binding site on this protein.", 
    "36": "In the cat autoperfused and hemodynamically isolated m. gastrocnemius and small intestine, i.a. infusion of corinphare enlarged arterial vessels in both organs, increased venous outflow in the muscle and altered it in the intestine, decreased pre- and postcapillary resistance as well as hydrostatic pressure in both organs which led to absorption of fluid from the interstitium and increased the capillary filtration coefficient (CFC). Administration of obsidan into the skeletal muscle vascular bed induced a decrease of the perfusion pressure and precapillary resistance whereas its infusion into the intestine entailed both analogous and contrary changes of these parameters. Obsidan reduced venous outflow, increased the CFC, postcapillary resistance and capillary hydrostatic pressure, thus entailing a fluid filtration into the interstitial space.", 
    "37": "Using plasma catecholamine (CA) levels as an index of the sympathoadrenal activity, the effects of chronic and acute beta-blockade on the blood pressure and sympathetic activity were evaluated in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) - salt hypertensive (HT) rats. The acute administration of one beta-blocker (sotalol, 5 mg/kg) to intact of vagotomized anesthetized HT animals induced a significant decrease in plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The amplitude of the decrease of the MAP or NE levels were linearly correlated with the basal NE levels, suggesting that sotalol reduced the blood pressure and sympathetic NE release more efficiently in rats with increased sympathetic activity. Similarly, chronic infusion of sotalol (1.5 mg X day-1 X rat-1) through an osmotic pump for 12 days in DOCA-salt HT rats significantly reduced NE and epinephrine (E) plasma levels compared with those observed in untreated DOCA-salt HT rats. Moreover, the chronic treatment with sotalol significantly reduced the plasma E elevation induced by bilateral carotid occlusion (CO) in vagotomized normotensive (NT) and HT rats. It therefore appears that acute administration of sotalol to HT rats causes a significant reduction in the sympathetic activity which is associated to a decrease in MAP. Although chronic sotalol treatment causes a significant reduction in the sympathoadrenal basal activity and in the adrenal reactivity, this treatment did not prevent the development of DOCA-salt hypertension.", 
    "38": "In pentobarbitone-anaesthetised wistar rats, the baroreflex bradycardia in response to the vasopressor agent phenylephrine was converted to a tachycardia by propranolol. In pithed wistar rats, phenylephrine produced a marked tachycardia which was mediated largely by beta-adrenoreceptors since propranolol markedly antagonised the response. A component of the tachycardia was mediated by alpha 1-adrenoreceptors since the tachycardia to phenylephrine in the presence of propranolol was antagonised by prazosin and mimicked by the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor agonist amidephrine. It is concluded that phenylephrine is not a useful agent for assessment of baroreflex function in the rat due to its marked cardiac stimulant actions.", 
    "39": "The trachea with the vagus nerves attached was isolated from guinea-pigs. Contractile responses to nerve stimulation or to drugs were measured as pressure changes in the fluid-filled lumen. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves caused a prompt increase in the intratracheal pressure with an optimum frequency of stimulation between 20 and 30 Hz. The response to the left vagus was somewhat stronger than the response to the right vagus. Carbachol caused a maximum pressure increase which was about twice that achieved by bilateral stimulation of the vagus nerves at 20 Hz. In the presence of physostigmine the two sources of stimuli were equally effective. The excitatory response to stimulation of the vagus nerves was completely inhibited by hexamethonium, atropine and terbutaline. This indicates that the excitatory response is mediated via ganglia with end-organ responses mediated exclusively by muscarinic receptors and functionally antagonized by stimulation of beta 2-adrenoreceptors. The trachea preparation exhibited an intrinsic tone which was reduced by terbutaline and indomethacin but not by atropine or hexamethonium. It is probable that prostaglandins are involved in the generation of intrinsic tone. Noradrenaline caused a concentration dependent inhibition of the vagally mediated contractions of the trachea which was antagonized by propranolol and yohimbine. When tracheal tone was induced by carbachol only propranolol was effective thus indicating both pre- and postsynaptic effects of noradrenaline. The present study has shown that the isolated vagus nerve-trachea is a stable and useful preparation for the evaluation of drugs acting at various levels of the contractile responses of the trachea.",

    "42": "It was found that a hypotensive effect of penbutolol used for treatment of 234 patients with hypertensive disease exceeded that of propranolol and developed at a dose of 20-80 mg a day at the end of the 2nd week of treatment. Penbutolol produces a less negative chronotropic effect as compared to propranolol. The excess of penbutolol therapeutic dose leads to the further augmentation of a positive clinical effect.", 
    "43": "This study was undertaken to determine the chronic effects of a long-acting calcium-channel blocker (nitrendipine) on resting left ventricular filling abnormalities in ten patients with essential hypertension. Radionuclide left ventricular curves of these hypertensive patients were compared with the curves of twelve normal volunteers and of eight asymptomatic older patients. The curves were analyzed for ejection fraction, peak filling rate (normalized for end-diastolic counts and for stroke counts), time to peak filling rate and filling fraction in the first-third of diastole normalized for cycle length. Heart rate and ejection fraction were similar in both control groups and hypertensive patients before and after nitrendipine. Before nitrendipine, diastolic filling parameters were significantly different in the hypertensive patients as compared with the volunteers and with the asymptomatic aged patients: peak filling rate was lower, time to peak filling rate was longer and the first-third filling fraction was smaller. After six weeks of nitrendipine therapy, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly. After nitrendipine, the time to peak filling rate decreased and the first-third filling fraction and the peak filling rate (normalized for stroke counts) increased significantly. The acute oral administration of 100 mg atenolol induced a further decrease in systolic blood pressure and a significant decrease in heart rate. The effect of combining nitrendipine and atenolol on diastolic indexes was a preserved effect on time to peak filling rate and on the first-third filling fraction. These results suggest that short-term therapy with nitrendipine improves early diastolic dysfunction in hypertensives: the addition of a beta-blocking agent further improved the early diastolic indexes.", 
    "44": "Esmolol, an ultra-short-acting cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker, was investigated in a double-blind prospective protocol for its ability to control haemodynamic responses associated with tracheal intubation after thiopentone and succinylcholine. Thirty ASA physical status I patients received a 12-minute infusion of esmolol (500 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 for four minutes, then 300 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 for 8 minutes) or saline. Five minutes after the start of the drug/placebo infusion, anaesthesia was induced with 4 mg X kg-1 thiopentone followed by succinylcholine for tracheal intubation. Prior to induction esmolol produced significant decreases in heart rate (HR) (9.3 +/- 1.8 per cent) and rate-pressure product (RPP) (13.1 +/- 1.8 per cent), systolic blood pressure (SAP) (4.3 +/- 1.5 per cent) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (1.7 +/- 2.0 per cent). Increases in HR, SAP and RPP after intubation were approximately 50 per cent less in patients given esmolol compared to patients given placebo. There were highly significant differences in HR (p less than 0.0001), and RPP (p less than 0.0005) and significant differences in SAP (p less than 0.05) when the maximal esmolol post-intubation response was compared to the maximal placebo response. Infusion of esmolol in the dose utilized in this study significantly attenuated but did not completely eliminate cardiovascular responses to intubation.", 
    "45": "The objective of this study was to determine the relationships between the total oral clearance of propranolol and the partial clearances through its primary metabolic pathways, i.e. glucuronidation, side-chain oxidation and ring oxidation. Seven young, white males were given single 80 mg oral doses of the drug together with tritium-labelled propranolol. Plasma propranolol was measured by GC/MS and fourteen metabolites were measured in urine by h.p.l.c. with radiometric detection. The total oral clearance of propranolol in these subjects varied about three-fold, from 27.5 to 71.4 ml min-1 kg-1. The clearance through glucuronidation was very similar in all subjects, ranging from 6.8 to 9.9 ml min-1 kg-1. The clearance through side-chain oxidation varied 2.4-fold, from 10.9 to 25.8 ml min-1 kg-1. Increased clearance through this pathway correlated with increased total oral clearance (r = 0.84; P less than 0.02). The clearance through ring oxidation varied as much as 5.6-fold, from 7.5 to 41.8 ml min-1 kg-1. Increased clearance through this pathway correlated highly with increased total oral clearance (r = 0.94; P less than 0.002). These observations indicate that the intersubject variability in the oral clearance of propranolol in young, white males is due mainly to differences in the activity of the ring oxidation pathway, to some extent in the side-chain oxidation pathway, but not to differences in the glucuronidation pathway. The partial metabolic clearance approach adopted in this study may be useful in the investigation of factors influencing the oral bioavailability of propranolol.", 
    "46": "The potential interaction between ketanserin and propranolol has been investigated in eight healthy volunteers. Volunteers received single doses of placebo, propranolol (80 mg), ketanserin (20 mg), and propranolol (80 mg) plus ketanserin (20 mg) following a randomised double-blind regimen. A single dose of ketanserin had little effect on resting heart rate and blood pressure and the effects of propranolol and ketanserin in combination were similar to those of propranolol alone. The inhibition of exercise induced tachycardia by propranolol was not affected by ketanserin. The pharmacokinetics of propranolol elimination were not influenced by the concurrent administration of ketanserin, nor the pharmacokinetics of ketanserin by propranolol.", 
    "47": "Recent findings indicate that post-training glucose injections can modulate memory storage for inhibitory (passive) avoidance training. Experiment I extended these findings to determine whether glucose, like other memory modulating treatments, enhances memory storage when administered after training with low footshock and impairs memory storage after high footshock training. In Experiment I, male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained in a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task using either a brief footshock (0.5 mA, 0.7 s) or slightly more intense footshock kept on until escape (0.7 mA, mean escape latency = 3.4 s). Immediately after training, each rat received a subcutaneous injection of glucose (100 mg/kg). When tested for retention performance 24 h later, the glucose-injected animals exhibited enhanced retention performance for low footshock training and impaired retention for high footshock training. Experiment II determined whether pretreatment with adrenergic antagonists blocked the effects of glucose on memory. Pretreatment with the alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, phenoxybenzamine, or propranolol, respectively, had no effect on acquisition or retention in animals trained with the brief footshock and did not affect glucose facilitation of that memory. In animals trained to escape footshock, phenoxybenzamine did not attenuate the amnesia produced by glucose. Propranolol-pretreated animals had impaired retention whether or not they received post-training amnestic injections of glucose; glucose had no effect on retention in these amnestic animals. These findings add further support to the view that glucose release after training and treatment may represent a physiological response subsequent to epinephrine release in modulating memory storage processing.", 
    "48": "The effect of metoprolol on global left ventricular function during exercise was analyzed with nuclear ventriculography in 17 patients with ischemic heart disease. All had stable angina pectoris and ST-segment depression of more than 0.1 mV during treadmill exercise when not taking metoprolol. Each patient was stressed with supine bicycle exercise to the same load on a maintenance dose of metoprolol (100 mg X 2/day) and on a second occasion without the drug, the two being separated by 7 days. The mean heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly reduced both at rest and exercise with metoprolol. There was no significant difference of rest left ventricular ejection fraction with or without metoprolol. At exercise, however, every patient showed improvement of left ventricular function, the average left ventricular ejection fraction increasing by 14% (+/- 6) relative to the same exercise without metoprolol (p less than 0.001). We conclude that chronic metoprolol treatment in patients with ischemic heart disease can ameliorate left ventricular dysfunction induced by exercise and may thereby reduce myocardial ischemia.", 
    "49": "Anaesthesia for microlaryngoscopy was induced and maintained with fentanyl 3 micrograms kg-1 and methohexitone (initial bolus of 1-1.5 mg kg-1 plus subsequent infusion of 4 mg kg-1 h-1). Suxamethonium was used to induce neuromuscular blockade. Twenty minutes before induction of anaesthesia, previously normotensive patients (n = 35), and patients with hypertension well controlled by beta-receptor antagonists (n = 16) were pretreated with metoprolol (M) 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v. and dihydralazine (DH) 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v., dihydralazine 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v. alone, or saline. Arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored: any arrhythmia and ST60-T changes were noted. After the methohexitone infusion was stopped, the times for emergence and full recovery were short (median 2 min 15 s and 5 min later, respectively). Pretreatment with M + DH abolished increases in AP and HR during endoscopy. Arrhythmias were observed in fewer pretreated patients than in controls (P less than 0.05). ST60-T changes in the ECG indicating myocardial ischaemia were found in two of 19 M + DH and in six of 21 saline-pretreated patients. One of these six patients developed a myocardial infarction. Pretreatment with dihydralazine alone attenuated the pressor response to microlaryngoscopy, but was associated with consistently high HR and an incidence of arrhythmias as well as ST60-T changes similar to that found after saline.", 
    "50": "The interaction between nifedipine and propranolol on cardiac hemodynamics and function was investigated in 9 patients with normal left ventricular (LV) function who were undergoing cardiac catheterization for complaints of chest pain. Only 2 patients had angiographic evidence of significant coronary artery disease but no patient had clinical evidence of ischemia during the study. All patients were pre-treated with propranolol, 30 to 320 mg/day (mean +/- standard deviation 210 +/- 122); the propranolol serum level ranged from 43 to 246 ng/ml (mean 203 +/- 62). The administration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in blood pressure (from 94 +/- 11 to 85 +/- 13 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), increase in heart rate (from 59 +/- 6 to 65 +/- 7 beats/min, p less than 0.05), and an increase in both mean right atrial and mean pulmonary artery wedge pressures (from 8 +/- 3 to 9 +/- 3 mm Hg and from 13 +/- 3 to 14 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively, both p less than 0.05). Cardiac index increased (from 2.3 +/- 0.3 to 2.7 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.01). Stroke volume index also increased significantly (from 39 +/- 5 to 43 +/- 6 ml/m2) and systemic vascular resistance decreased (from 1,715 +/- 369 to 1,255 +/- 271 dynes s cm-5, p less than 0.01). No significant change was noted in pulmonary vascular resistance (148 +/- 94 vs 140 +/- 62 dynes s cm-5), LV stroke work index (44 +/- 9 vs 42 +/- 10 g-m/m2), LV end-diastolic pressure (15 +/- 2 vs 16 +/- 2 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "The anti-arrhythmic quinidine has been reported to be a competitive inhibitor of the catalytic activities of human liver P-450DB, including sparteine delta 2-oxidation and bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, and we confirmed the observation that submicromolar concentrations are strongly inhibitory. Human liver microsomes oxidize quinidine to the 3-hydroxy (Km 4 microM) and N-oxide (Km 33 microM) products, consonant with in vivo observations. Both bufuralol and sparteine inhibited microsomal quinidine 3-hydroxylation. Liver microsomes prepared from DA strain rats showed a relative deficiency in quinidine 3-hydroxylase activity in females compared to males. These observations might suggest that quinidine oxidation is catalyzed by the same P-450 forms that oxidize debrisoquine, bufuralol, and sparteine; i.e., rat P-450UT-H and P-450DB. However, neither of these two purified enzymes catalyzed quinidine 3-hydroxylation, and anti-P-450UT-H, which strongly inhibits human liver microsomal bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, did not substantially inhibit quinidine 3-hydroxylation or N-oxygenation. P-450MP, the human S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylase, also does not appear to oxidize quinidine but P-450NF, the human nifedipine oxidase, does. Anti-P-450NF inhibited greater than 95% of the 3-hydroxylation and greater than 85% of the N-oxygenation of quinidine in several microsomal samples. Quinidine inhibited microsomal nifedipine oxidation and, in a series of human liver samples, rates of nifedipine oxidation were correlated with rates of quinidine oxidation. Thus, quinidine oxidation appears to be catalyzed primarily by P-450NF and not by P-450DB. Quinidine binds 2 orders of magnitude more tightly to P-450DB, which does not oxidize it, than to P-450NF, the major enzyme involved in its oxidation. The substrate specificity of human P-450NF is discussed further in terms of its regioselective oxidations of complex molecules including quinidine, aldrin, benzphetamine, cortisol, testosterone and androstenedione, estradiol, and several 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dihydropyridines.", 
    "52": "Atenolol is a beta-blocker antihypertensive agent that reportedly has little central nervous system action. A patient was given atenolol during a course of electroconvulsive therapy and developed an organic mental syndrome with paranoid delusions. The possible alteration of the permeability of the blood-brain barrier by electroconvulsive therapy may have enabled atenolol to cause this unusual side effect.", 
    "53": "Depressive symptoms were measured in 34 white male patients receiving propranolol treatment for cardiovascular illness. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Hudson Generalized Contentment Scale were used to measure depressive symptoms. Patients with a positive personal or family history of depression had significantly higher depression scores than those with a negative history. Although there was no correlation between propranolol dosage and depressive symptoms for the population as a whole, among patients with a negative history there was a highly significant positive correlation between propranolol dosage and depression scores.", 
    "54": "The pharmacodynamic effects of single oral doses of atenolol (100 mg), labetalol (300 mg), and propranolol (80 mg) were compared with those of placebo in a randomized, double-blind, Latin square design in 12 patients with hypertension. Atenolol and propranolol both significantly reduced cardiac output (-0.55 vs. -0.31 L/min) and heart rate (-8.0 vs. -6.6 bpm), whereas labetalol had no effect on either parameter (-0.08 L/min; + 1.0 bpm). Labetalol significantly reduced vascular resistance (-339 dynes X cm/sec5), but atenolol and propranolol did not (147 vs. 62 dynes X cm/sec5). Only labetalol significantly reduced the systolic (-15.3 mm Hg), diastolic (-11.5 mm Hg), and mean blood pressures (-12.8 mm Hg). Atenolol significantly reduced only diastolic blood pressure (-5.20 mm Hg), whereas propranolol failed to lower these parameters significantly. These data indicate that the hemodynamic profile of labetalol differs from that of selective and nonselective beta-blockers. Labetalol lowered blood pressure primarily by reducing vascular resistance, whereas reductions in heart rate and cardiac output were the predominant effects of atenolol and propranolol.", 
    "55": "In isolated sc adipocytes removed from hyperthyroid patients, the specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [125I]iodocyanopindolol was greater than that in adipocytes from normal subjects. Based on Scatchard analysis of the [125I] iodocyanopindolol data, this difference was due to a significant (P less than 0.01) increase in adrenoceptor number, which was 1.72 +/- 0.18 (+/- SEM) pmol/10(7) cells in the hyperthyroid patients and 0.94 +/- 0.16 pmol/10(7) cells in the normal subjects. When the patients were restudied when they were euthyroid, a significant decrease in the specific binding of the two radioligands was found. In hyperthyroidism, the lipolytic responsiveness (maximum effect) to norepinephrine was increased 5-fold, and that to isopropylnorepinephrine was increased 2-fold. No changes in either the binding of [3H]yohimbine or the antilipolytic effect of clonidine were found. In isolated adipocytes from hypothyroid patients, the specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [125I]iodocyanopindolol did not differ from that in the normal subjects. The basal rate of lipolysis (P less than 0.025) and the lipolytic responsiveness to isopropylnorepinephrine (P less than 0.025) were significantly lower than normal, and the response to norepinephrine was almost completely abolished in the hypothyroid state. The sensitivity and responsiveness to clonidine were comparable in the adipocytes of the hypothyroid patients and normal subjects. There was no difference between hypothyroid patients and normal subjects in the binding of [3H]yohimbine. We conclude that the sc adipocytes in hyperthyroidism have beta-adrenergic, but not alpha 2-adrenergic abnormalities. Although there was a moderate increase in the beta-adrenoceptor density in hyperthyroidism, the most important abnormality, namely the increased responsiveness to the catecholamines, seems to be located beyond the receptor level. On the other hand, in hypothyroidism, there was no evidence of changes in either the alpha 2- or the beta-adrenoceptors. The chief abnormality in hypothyroidism, decreased responsiveness to beta-adrenergic agonists, also would appear to be localized beyond the adrenoceptor level.", 
    "56": "Melanophore-stimulating hormone (MSH) release from the pars intermedia of the pituitary gland is probably regulated by multiple factors of hypothalamic origin. We have examined a number of potential regulatory factors for their effects on MSH release from the amphibian Xenopus laevis. Serotonin and acetylcholine have no effect on MSH release. Both adrenaline and noradrenaline inhibit release of MSH in a dose-dependent manner. Studies with specific receptor agonists and antagonists reveal that these neurotransmitters exert their in vitro effects primarily through a dopamine D-2 receptor, although an alpha-adrenergic receptor could not be excluded. We further conclude that the pars intermedia of X. laevis lacks a beta-adrenergic receptor for the regulation of MSH secretion from the pars intermedia. In mammals, this receptor activates the adenylate cyclase system. Our studies reveal that despite the lack of beta-adrenergic receptors, cyclic-AMP is likely an intracellular factor involved in the stimulation of MSH release.", 
    "57": "Two separate randomized double-blind, crossover trials were carried out in hypertensive patients to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of verapamil. In the first study, verapamil, in doses of 120 mg three times daily, was compared with pindolol, in doses of 7.5 mg twice daily. A thiazide diuretic was given with both drugs. In another study, verapamil, in doses of 160 mg twice daily, was compared with 200 mg twice daily of labetalol in hypertensive patients with coexisting chronic obstructive lung disease. Blood pressure fell equally with these drugs, and neither of the drugs caused significant side effects. Labetalol significantly reduced both forced expiration volume at 1s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), suggesting a bronchoconstrictor effect. Verapamil was devoid of any such effect. Verapamil did not affect plasma renin concentration.", 
    "58": "In 34 patients on double-blind postinfarction treatment with metoprolol 100-200 mg daily (N = 20) or matching placebo, the study treatment was gradually withdrawn during one week. The patients were subjected to mental stress (a modified version of Stroop's colour word conflict test) before and 1 and 12 weeks after the completion of double-blind withdrawal. This stress increased heart rate (P less than 0.001), blood pressures (P less than 0.001) and adrenaline (P = 0.003), but not noradrenaline in venous plasma. In the placebo group similar responses were evoked on all three occasions. In the metoprolol group, heart rate responses were reduced while on treatment. Following withdrawal there was no rebound increase in the heart rate response. Rather, some blockade persisted one week after withdrawal. Twelve weeks after withdrawal heart rate and blood pressure responses to mental stress were normalized. During treatment the metoprolol group had fewer ventricular arrhythmias than the placebo group. Following withdrawal, ventricular arrhythmias during stress increased in 4 patients in the metoprolol group. Plasma adrenaline levels were reduced one week after withdrawal of metoprolol treatment. Plasma noradrenaline levels did not change within either group during the follow-up period. Thus, no rebound increase in cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress was found, in contrast to our previous findings with physical stressors in similar patients participating in this study. These differences in responsiveness after metoprolol withdrawal may be related to different clearance rates for metoprolol in different tissues. Our results indicate that central, presumably supramedullary, cardiovascular control mechanisms involving beta-adrenoceptors recover at a slow rate following withdrawal.", 
    "59": "The efficacy and safety of bevantolol (new cardioselective beta-blocking agent without intrinsic sympathetic activity) were evaluated in chronic stable angina pectoris. Acute effects on heart rate (HR) and pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in the first second, FEV1, and vital capacity, VC) (double-blind placebo, propranolol, 80 mg, and bevantolol, 150 mg) and the antianginal efficacy during early (double-blind placebo period) and chronic bevantolol therapy (long-term follow-up for 52 weeks) were studied. Bevantolol reduces HR in the same way as propranolol (both p less than 0.01). Pulmonary function is modified significantly only by propranolol (decreasing FEV1, p less than 0.05). Bevantolol reduces antianginal attacks and nitroglycerin consumption (p less than 0.01) and improves exercise tolerance (p less than 0.01) during early and chronic therapy.", 
    "60": "To determine the efficacy and safety of intravenous atenolol in patients with frequent and repetitive benign or potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias, 40 patients received an open-label, single dose of 10 mg of intravenous atenolol, given in aliquots of 2.5 mg every 10 minutes. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring was performed on the day before, the day of, and the day after infusion of atenolol. A full 10-mg dose was given to 37 patients; asymptomatic bradycardia developed in 3 patients, and they were not included in the efficacy analysis. A single 10-mg dose of intravenous atenolol was effective rapidly in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias, with peak suppression occurring 1 to 2 hours after infusion and significant suppression lasting for 7 hours. Only 1 patient had symptoms (lightheadedness), plus hypotension lasting 45 minutes after the infusion was concluded. The mean plasma level of atenolol was 231 ng/ml 10 minutes after the infusion, with individual patient values of 148 to 457 ng/ml. Thus, a single intravenous dose of 10 mg of atenolol can significantly reduce the frequency of ventricular premature complexes and ventricular tachycardia within the first hour after infusion; suppression can last for 7 hours. Atenolol is well tolerated.", 
    "61": "Eighteen patients with chronic, stable angina were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-way, crossover study in which they received 4 weeks of treatment with a once-daily dose of bepridil, 300 mg, a once-daily dose of long-acting propranolol, 160 mg, and placebo. Heart rate at rest during bepridil treatment was less than that during placebo (p less than 0.01), whereas propranolol reduced heart rate compared with placebo (p less than 0.001) and bepridil (p less than 0.01). Systolic blood pressure at rest did not change during the 3 treatment phases. Exercise time to onset of angina and to development of moderate angina were reproducible over the 24-hour period during each treatment phase. Treadmill walking time to onset of angina and to development of moderate angina was significantly prolonged during bepridil (p less than 0.01) and during propranolol treatment (p less than 0.05). Heart rate at peak exercise was similar during bepridil and during placebo, but was markedly reduced with propranolol treatment (p less than 0.001). Systolic blood pressure during exercise was similar during placebo and bepridil, but was substantially lower during propranolol treatment (p less than 0.01).", 
    "62": "A four-step synthesis of 2-chlorodopamine (2b) is presented as well as methods for the syntheses of the N-methyl, ethyl, and n-propyl analogues (2c-e). Compounds 2b and 2c were essentially equipotent to dopamine for increasing renal blood flow in anesthetized dogs that had been treated with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine. The increases in renal blood flow were blocked by the DA1 antagonist (R)-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine. Compounds 2d and 2e were significantly less potent than dopamine in the same model; the increases in renal blood flow were attenuated by propranolol and blocked by a combination of propranolol and (R)-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine. The significance of an o-chloro substituent on dopamine analogues for the activation of the DA1 receptor is briefly discussed.", 
    "63": "To determine whether the autonomic nervous system has a direct effect on GIP secretion, six normal subjects received a 4-hr intraduodenal perfusion of glucose (225 mg/min) and polyethylene glycol on four successive days. During the latter 2 hr, either normal saline, propranolol, phentolamine, or atropine were infused intravenously. Glucose absorption was calculated by measuring glucose and polyethylene glycol following luminal aspiration distal to the perfusion site. Basal and peak or nadir values in the saline study of plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, and GIP were similar to the other three studies prior to autonomic blockade. During the latter 2 hr of the glucose perfusion, the plasma glucose and glucagon responses to saline did not differ from responses to the three blocking agents. Phentolamine but not atropine or propranolol resulted in a greater insulin response compared to saline (3247 +/- 762 vs 1348 +/- 388 microU/ml/120 min, P less than 0.01). GIP was not significantly affected by phentolamine (18,146 +/- 4574), propranolol (7585 +/- 5854), or atropine (15,797 +/- 6297) compared to saline (11,717 +/- 5204 pg/ml/120 min). Glucose absorption was unaffected by infusions of saline, phentolamine, and propranolol, but was increased following atropine infusion (5841 +/- 1120 vs 1044 +/- 808 mg/120 min, P less than 0.02). There appears to be no direct effect of the autonomic nervous system on glucose-induced secretion of GIP.", 
    "64": "The effects of A23187 on electromechanical activity of guinea-pig papillary muscles were examined by microelectrode techniques. A23187 (10(-6) M) caused a marked positive inotropic effect (868% of control) on preparations driven at 0.2 Hz. This inotropic effect was accompanied by a significant prolongation of the action potential duration at an early repolarization phase (APD 10), but not at a late repolarization phase (APD 30 and APD 80). Other parameters of action potential were unaffected. In the presence of nifedipine (10(-6) M), Ca2+ channel blocker, A23187 still increased the contractile force (495% of control) but had no effect on APD 10. On the other hand, APD 30 and APD 80 were significantly shortened. In the presence of ryanodine (2 X 10(-6) M), an inhibitor of internal Ca2+ release, A23187 was also able to cause the positive inotropic effect (389% of control). This inotropic effect was accompanied by a prolonged APD 10. These electrical and mechanical effects of A23187 were completely blocked by the combined treatment with nifedipine and ryanodine, suggesting that A23187 has a dual action. In papillary muscles depolarized by 26 mM [K+]0, A23187 augmented the slow action potential. In voltage clamp experiments using a single sucrose-gap method, A23187 caused a marked increase in the slow inward current and the outward current. The effects of A23187 were not antagonized by a beta-adrenoceptor and a histamine (H2) receptor antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "The effects of forskolin on the electrophysiological parameters of the isolated corneal epithelium from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) were investigated. Forskolin stimulated the short-circuit current (SCC) and transepithelial potential difference (PDt), while reducing the transepithelial resistance. These effects were absent in Cl- -free bathing solutions. Furosemide, added either before or after forskolin, completely blocked the effects. Epinephrine and A23187, added after forskolin, produced only a small additional stimulation of the SCC. Propranolol neither blocked nor reduced the effect of forskolin. Forskolin increased the stroma to tear 36Cl flux by 61% and the tear to stroma 36Cl flux by 64%. Intracellular recordings showed that forskolin depolarized the potential difference across the apical membrane and reduced the apical/basolateral resistance ratio. Intracellular recordings in the isolated rabbit epithelium showed the same effects by forskolin except that there was only a brief stimulation of PDt, after which it stabilized slightly below the control level. These results are consistent with an increase in apical membrane permeability similar to that produced by adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, epinephrine, and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187.", 
    "66": "This study evaluates the antihypertensive effects of enalapril, a new, potent, long acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. 69 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were included in 5 groups. Group I was used to compare the effects of enalapril and propranolol on blood pressure, renal function, plasma renin activity, aldosterone excretion and plasma lipids in 24 patients after 12 weeks. Group II was used to evaluate long term effects (48 weeks) of these drugs in 13 patients. Group III included 32 patients that received enalapril as monotherapy for 6 to 12 weeks. Group IV was studied to estimate the antihypertensive effect of low doses of hydrochlorothiazide in 18 patients receiving enalapril. Group V was used to compare the antihypertensive effect of hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril or enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide in 19 patients. The effect on mean blood pressure was similar with enalapril and propranolol (117 versus 103 mmHg and 115 versus 104 mmHg respectively); however, glomerular filtration rate decreased with propranolol (105 versus 87 ml/min; p less than .05) and was unaltered with enalapril (102 versus 98 ml/min). Triglycerides rose with propranolol (179 versus 231 mg/dl; p less than .05) and did not change with enalapril (157 versus 121 mg/dl). In the long term, antihypertensive effects were similar and no significant side effects were observed. In 14/32 patients blood pressure became normal with enalapril alone. Low doses of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg) decreased mean blood pressure by 10 mmHg when added to enalapril. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide was significant greater than that of enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide alone. Used as monotherapy, enalapril normalised blood pressure in 44% of cases. Addition of low doses of hydrochlorothiazide significantly increased the antihypertensive effect of enalapril. These results show that enalapril is a good antihypertensive agent alone or with low doses of diuretic.", 
    "67": "In mammalian heart tissue beta 2-adrenoceptors are known to coexist with beta 1-adrenoceptors. In the present study, evidence that beta 2-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig and rat ventricles are primarily localized on the coronary endothelium is provided by competition binding studies with the subtype-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists ICI 89.406 (beta 1-selective) and ICI 118.551 (beta 2-selective) on four different plasma membrane preparations. (1) Following density gradient centrifugation of cardiac ventricular microsomes from rats or guinea-pigs, endothelial plasma membranes migrated at slightly higher density than the sarcolemmal membranes, as verified by endothelial (angiotensin converting enzyme) and sarcolemmal markers (adenylate cyclase, [3H]ouabain binding). At the activity peak of angiotensin converting enzyme, the relative amount of beta 2-adrenoceptors in guinea-pigs and rats was 25% and 65%, respectively. (2) On sarcolemmal membranes corresponding to the activity peak of adenylate cyclase, beta-adrenoceptors consisted of the beta 1-type exclusively (guinea-pig), or to at least 90% (rat). (3) Cultures of coronary endothelial cells derived from guinea-pigs revealed only beta 2-adrenoceptors. (4) Isolated guinea-pig cardiomyocytes contained only beta 1-adrenoceptors, a finding recently established in rat myocytes as well."
