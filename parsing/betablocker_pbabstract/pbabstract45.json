A comparative study on the efficacy and safety of bisoprolol and sustained release metoprolol succinate in patients with arterial hypertension (AH), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was conducted. High antihypertensive efficacy and good tolerability of bisoprolol and metoprolol succinate sustained release was shown in hypertensive patients with CVD and COPD. Bisoprolol versus metoprolol succinate sustained release was more effective in reducing the number of PVCs in hypertensive patients with CVD and COPD. After 12 weeks of therapy of bisoprolol there was a trend to reduce the number of patients with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy by 16.6 % (from 83.3% at baseline vs 66.7% after 12 weeks of treatment, p < 0.1). Despite the fact that the identified changes in respiratory function (ERF) in both groups did not reach certainty bisoprolol versus metoprolol succinate sustained-release was a lesser extent influenced the performance of ERF and more - to reduce dyspnea to the evaluation scales Borg and mMRC (delta% = -7.1 in fixed vs delta% = -3.8 in control groups and delta% = -5.6 vs delta% = 0 respectively) in patients with AH, CVD and COPD.",

We questioned whether chloride channels/transporters are novel targets for the relaxation of airway smooth muscle (ASM). We have screened a library of compounds, derivatives of anthranilic and indanyloxyacetic acid, that were originally developed to antagonize chloride channels in the kidney. We hypothesized that members of this library would be novel calcium-activated chloride channel blockers for the airway. The initial screen of this compound library identified 4 of 20 compounds that relaxed a tetraethylammonium chloride-induced contraction in guinea pig tracheal rings. The two most effective compounds, compounds 1 and 13, were further studied for their potential to either prevent the initiation of or relax the maintenance phase of an acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contraction or to potentiate \u03b2-agonist-mediated relaxation. Both relaxed an established ACh-induced contraction in human and guinea pig ex vivo ASM. In contrast, the prevention of an ACh-induced contraction required copretreatment with the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter blocker bumetanide. The combination of compound 13 and bumetanide also potentiated relaxation by the \u03b2-agonist isoproterenol in guinea pig tracheal rings. Compounds 1 and 13 hyperpolarized the plasma cell membrane of human ASM cells and blocked spontaneous transient inward currents, a measure of chloride currents in these cells. These functional and electrophysiological data suggest that modulating ASM chloride flux is a novel therapeutic target in asthma and other bronchoconstrictive diseases.",

In order to better understand biological activity of studied compounds, the influence on \u03b22-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig trachea and vasorelaxant properties in rat aorta were evaluated. Furthermore, due to assessed antioxidant activity, some biochemical studies were also performed. All tested compounds showed prominent antiarrhythmic activity in the model of ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. In this experiment the most active was compound MH-97. Whereas, compound MH-82 was the most active in barium- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmia after i.v. or p.o. administration, respectively. These two compounds have higher affinity to \u03b21-adrenoceptors than compound MH-87, thus it suggests that blocking properties of \u03b21-adrenoceptors are involved in the observed antiarrhythmic effects. All studied compounds have revealed antagonistic potency for \u03b22-adrenoceptors in tracheal smooth muscle, however weaker than that of propranolol. None of tested compounds demonstrated antioxidant effect. They also had weak calcium entry blocking activity.

Several studies provide biochemical and behavioral evidence about the anxiogenic action of orexin A. However, we have little evidence about the underlying neuromodulation. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of neurotransmitters in the orexin A-induced anxiety-like behavior in elevated plus maze (EPM) test in mice. Accordingly, mice were pretreated with a non-selective muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, atropine; a \u03b3-aminobutyric acid subunit A (GABA-A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline; a D2, D3, D4 dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol; a non-specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, nitro-l-arginine; a nonselective \u03b1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine and a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol 30min prior to the intracerebroventricular administration of orexin A. The EPM test started 30min after the i.c.v. injection of the neuropeptide. Our results show that orexin A decreases significantly the time spent in the arms (open/open+closed) and this action is reversed by bicuculline, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol, but not by atropine, haloperidol or nitro-l-arginine. Our results provide evidence for the first time that the orexin A-induced anxiety-like behavior is mediated through GABA-A-ergic, \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic neurotransmissions, whereas muscarinic cholinergic, dopaminergic and nitrergic neurotransmissions may not be implicated.",

In this setting, it is not infrequent to find relevant differences in the trial results across countries. The interpretation of these differences should be extremely cautious to avoid the well known mistakes related to subgroup analyses. To believe in differences, it is necessary to adopt appropriate methodologies in the analysis of data but, even more important, to find a biological plausibility that can explain the observed difference. A further confirmation from other studies can also help in the interpretation. In the literature there are some examples of such differences that, in some cases, produced erroneous interpretations of the results of a trial, and also induced regulatory authorities to take decisions based on these differences.",

We previously demonstrated that \u03b2-AR blockers at low dose improve osteoporosis with hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system via \u03b22-AR blocking, while they may have a somewhat inhibitory effect on osteoblastic activity at high doses. In this study, the effects of butoxamine (BUT), a specific \u03b22-AR antagonist, on tooth movement were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) showing osteoporosis with hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. We administered BUT (1 mg/kg) orally, and closed-coil springs were inserted into the upper-left first molar. After sacrifice, we calculated the amount of tooth movement and analyzed the trabecular microarchitecture and histomorphometry. The distance in the SHR control was greater than that in the Wistar-Kyoto rat group, but no significant difference was found in the SHR treated with BUT compared with the Wistar-Kyoto rat control. Analysis of bone volume per tissue volume, trabecular number, and osteoclast surface per bone surface in the alveolar bone showed clear bone loss by an increase of bone resorption in SHR. In addition, BUT treatment resulted in a recovery of alveolar bone loss. Furthermore, TH-immunoreactive nerves in the periodontal ligament were increased by tooth movement, and BUT administration decreased TH-immunoreactive nerves. These results suggest that BUT prevents alveolar bone loss and orthodontic tooth movement via \u03b22-AR blocking.", 
    "46": "\u03b2-Adrenergic receptor blockers (\u03b2-blockers) are commonly used to treat heart failure, but the biologic mechanisms governing their efficacy are still poorly understood. The complexity of \u03b2-adrenergic signaling coupled with the influence of receptor polymorphisms makes it difficult to intuit the effect of \u03b2-blockers on cardiac physiology. While some studies indicate that \u03b2-blockers are efficacious by inhibiting \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, other studies suggest that they work by maintaining \u03b2-adrenergic responsiveness. Here, we use a systems pharmacology approach to test the hypothesis that in ventricular myocytes, these two apparently conflicting mechanisms for \u03b2-blocker efficacy can occur concurrently. We extended a computational model of the \u03b2(1)-adrenergic pathway and excitation-contraction coupling to include detailed receptor interactions for 19 ligands. Model predictions, validated with Ca(2+) and F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer imaging of adult rat ventricular myocytes, surprisingly suggest that \u03b2-blockers can both inhibit and maintain signaling depending on the magnitude of receptor stimulation. The balance of inhibition and maintenance of \u03b2(1)-adrenergic signaling is predicted to depend on the specific \u03b2-blocker (with greater responsiveness for metoprolol than carvedilol) and \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor Arg389Gly polymorphisms.",

We have previously shown that the release of IL-6 from alveolar macrophages is required for a prothrombotic state and acceleration of thrombosis following exposure to PM. Here, we determined that PM exposure results in the systemic release of catecholamines, which engage the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) on murine alveolar macrophages and augment the release of IL-6. In mice, \u03b22AR signaling promoted the development of a prothrombotic state that was sufficient to accelerate arterial thrombosis. In primary human alveolar macrophages, administration of a \u03b22AR agonist augmented IL-6 release, while the addition of a beta blocker inhibited PM-induced IL-6 release. Genetic loss or pharmacologic inhibition of the \u03b22AR on murine alveolar macrophages attenuated PM-induced IL-6 release and prothrombotic state. Furthermore, exogenous \u03b22AR agonist therapy further augmented these responses in alveolar macrophages through generation of mitochondrial ROS and subsequent increase of adenylyl cyclase activity. Together, these results link the activation of the sympathetic nervous system by \u03b22AR signaling with metabolism, lung inflammation, and an enhanced susceptibility to thrombotic cardiovascular events.",

Nevertheless, whether restoring nitric oxide in humans by pharmacological means can ameliorate sodium sensitivity has not been investigated. Because nebivolol has been demonstrated to increase nitric oxide bioactivity in both laboratory and clinical investigations, we hypothesized that nebivolol might ameliorate sodium sensitivity and improve renal sodium handling in comparison to metoprolol. We therefore conducted a randomized, 2-treatment-period crossover trial in 19 Hispanic postmenopausal women with hypertension to determine the comparative effects of nebivolol versus metoprolol on (1) 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure response to an increase in dietary sodium from 5 days of low sodium to 5 days of high sodium, (2) renal natriuretic response to a 1-L saline challenge, and (3) asymmetrical dimethylarginine. Clinic blood pressure and heart rate were significantly reduced after 4 weeks of treatment with both nebivolol and metoprolol. Twenty-four\u2013hour mean systolic blood pressure increased sharply from low sodium to high sodium for both nebivolol and metoprolol. Nevertheless, the increases in blood pressure did not differ between the 2 drugs: 7.7 (3.1, 12.3) mm Hg with metoprolol and 9.3 (4.6, 13.9) mm Hg with nebivolol (P=0.63). Furthermore, we observed no differences between the drugs in natriuretic response to saline challenge or asymmetrical dimethylarginine.

In addition, in ATOC an increase in \u03b22-adrenoceptor (AR) mRNA expression and \u03b22-AR thymocyte surface density was registered. Furthermore, AMPT (10(-4)M), as propranolol (10(-4)M), augmented thymocyte apoptosis and diminished thymocyte proliferation in ATOC. Propranolol exerted these effects acting on CD3(high) thymocytes. However, in thymocyte cultures, propranolol (10(-6)M) acting on the same thymocyte subset exerted the opposing effect on thymocyte apoptosis and ConA-stimulated proliferation. This suggested that, depending on thymocyte microenvironment, differential effects can be induced through the same type of AR. Additionally, arterenol (10(-8) to 10(-6)M), similar to propranolol, diminished apoptosis, but increased ConA-stimulated thymocyte proliferation in thymocyte culture. However, differently from propranolol, arterenol affected manly CD3- thymocyte subset, which harbors majority of \u03b11-AR+thymocytes. Additionally, arterenol showed a dose-dependent decrease in efficiency of thymocyte apoptosis and proliferation modulation with the rise in its concentration. Considering greater affinity of arterenol for \u03b11-ARs than for \u03b22-ARs, the previous findings could be attributable to increased engagement of \u03b22-ARs with the rise of arterenol concentration. Consistently, in the presence of propranolol (10(-6)M), a \u03b2-AR blocker, the arterenol (10(-8)M) effects on thymocytes were augmented. In conclusion, thymic endogenous CAs, acting through distinct AR types and, possible, the same AR type (but in different cell microenvironment) may exert the opposing effects on thymocyte apoptosis/proliferation.",

Propranolol significantly attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine levels (tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-8) in BALF or mucus secretion, whereas metoprolol reduced only smooth muscle proliferation. Moreover, propranolol treatment was associated (albeit not significantly) with restoring \u03b22 -adrenoceptor expression in airway epithelia.

SXT has been demonstrated to show good therapeutic effects on the cardiovascular system. A metabolomic approach was applied to study its therapeutic mechanisms and the synergistic properties of PG. UPLC-Q-TOF/MS based metabolomic profiling was adopted to assess the intervention effects of SXT, SXT-PG (SXT lacking PG) and PG, on chronic heart failure (CHF) rats. Betaloc was used as a positive control drug. A supervised discriminant technique (PLS-DA) was used to visualize the difference in global metabolic profiles within all experimental groups. Some significantly changed metabolites, such as carnitines, long-chain fatty acids and sphinganines, were identified, and the biochemical alterations of these were related to the disturbance in serum metabolic profiling of CHF rats. Furthermore, the metabolomics study demonstrated that the administration of SXT, but neither SXT-PG or PG alone, gave satisfactory curative effects on CHF through partially regulating the perturbed metabolic pathways. These observations were demonstrated by histopathological, electrocardiogram and serum enzymatic investigations. All these results supported the TCM theory that PG possesses synergistic properties which promote the synergized herbs in SXT in CHF rats. Overall, this paper demonstrates that metabolomics offers opportunities to understand the therapeutic mechanisms and synergistic properties of TCM.",

The overall aim of this study was to determine the effects of several environmental and physiological parameters on excystation in Acanthamoeba castellanii belonging to the T4 genotype. Cysts were prepared by inoculating A. castellanii trophozoites on non-nutrient agar plates for up to 2 weeks. To determine the effects of various conditions on excystation, A. castellanii cysts were inoculated in growth medium i.e. PYG and incubated at varying temperatures (4-40 \u00b0C), various pHs (4-9), artificial light/dark cycles and 5% of CO2. Optimum excystation was observed when cysts were incubated at 30 \u00b0C in growth medium at neutral pH. Extremes of temperature and pH reduced excystation, while light/dark cycles had no effect on excystation of A. castellanii. On the other hand, 5% of CO2 enhanced excystation and growth of excysting amoebae. To determine the effect of serum on A. castellanii excystation, assays were performed in the presence of varying concentrations of heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS) (5-100%). The results revealed that FBS promoted excystation. The involvement of G proteins in excystation was also determined. Using propranolol hydrochloride, a G protein inhibitor, the results revealed that G proteins play a role in A. castellanii differentiation. Furthermore, organic solvents (methanol/ethanol) completely blocked excystation. None of the aforementioned conditions had any effect on the viability of A. castellanii. A complete understanding of excystation in A. castellanii will be of value to counter infection recurrence.",

    "193": "Heart rate is a fundamental determinant of cardiac function. Normally, the increase in heart rate is accompanied by increased cardiac function. But under pathological conditions such as myocardial infarction and heart failure, accelerated heart rate may become detrimental as it decreases the diastolic time for left ventricular filling and myocardial perfusion but increases left ventricular myocardial oxygen demand. Therefore, heart rate reduction is an appropriate strategy to protect cardiac function. Heart rate reduction can be achieved by different bradycardic drugs, including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and selective f-channel inhibitors. By competing with norepinephrine and epinephrine for binding sites, beta-blockers block beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses to sympathetic stimulation. This induces heart rate reduction and negative inotropy. Calcium channel blockers block calcium influx via specific calcium channels, causing vasodilation and decreases in heart rate, conduction velocity within the heart and myocardial force generation. The selective f-channel inhibitor, ivabradine, inhibits If currents that play an exclusive role in pacemaking and thereby slows heart rate without altering myocardial inotropy. Since these drugs differ in their mechanisms of action, they may cause different beneficial and side effects and thus different outcome according to pathological states. After briefly describing the mechanisms involved in beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, this review focuses on the bradycardic property of ivabradine and its pleiotropic actions.",

CLP-induced hemodynamic changes and mortality were assessed over 7 days in wild-type (WT) and BK \u03b21-KO mice that were either untreated, given volume resuscitation (saline), or saline + calcium channel blocker nicardipine. Some mice were euthanized 24 h post-CLP to measure tissue injury and vascular and immune responses. CLP-induced hypotension was similar in untreated WT and BK \u03b21-KO mice, but BK \u03b21-KO mice died sooner. At 24 h post-CLP (mortality latency in BK \u03b21-KO mice), untreated CLP-BK \u03b21-KO mice showed more severe hypothermia, lower tissue perfusion, polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration-independent severe intestinal necrosis, and higher serum cytokine levels than CLP-WT mice. Saline resuscitation improved survival in CLP-WT but not CLP-BK \u03b21-KO mice. Saline + nicardipine-treated CLP-BK \u03b21-KO mice exhibited longer survival times, higher tissue perfusion, less intestinal injury, and lower cytokines versus untreated CLP-BK \u03b21-KO mice. These improvements were absent in treated CLP-WT mice, although saline + nicardipine improved blood pressure similarly in both septic mice. At 24 h post-CLP, BK and L-type Ca2+ channel functions in vitro were maintained in mesenteric arteries from WT mice. Mesenteric arteries from BK \u03b21-KO mice had blunted BK/enhanced L-type Ca2+ channel function. We conclude that vascular BK channel deficiency exaggerates mortality in septic BK \u03b21-KO mice by activating L-type Ca2+ channels leading to blood pressure-independent tissue ischemia.",

Control group results show that after bronchi-constriction caused by Propranolol-aerosol (20 mg / ml) in patients with bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive bronchitis, an increase of specific resistance in airways was caused (SRaw, p < 0.01), which confirms the presence of hyper-reactive bronco-constrictor effects intermediated by vagal ways. Two hours after Propranolol, inhaled Hexorenaline has blocked the action of Propranolol, but not entirely. Furthermore, two hours after acetylcholine-aerosol (1 mg /ml) was applied, inhaled Ipratropium (2 inh x 1 mg) has fully blocked the action of chemical bronchoconstrictor mediators, causing a decline of specific resistance in the airways (SRaw; p < 0.01).",

Human (n = 9-10) and porcine (n = 6-7) buccal mucosa were mounted in a modified Ussing chamber, and the kinetics of metoprolol and mannitol transport was assessed for a period of 5.5 h with the pH values of donor medium set at 7.4, 8.5, and 9.0. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin and Alcian blue-van Gieson were used as tissue stains to evaluate the histology and the presence of acidic polysaccharides (e.g., mucins), respectively. The permeability of metoprolol was decreased in human buccal mucosa by almost twofold when compared with porcine buccal mucosa with a positive correlation (r(2) = 0.96) between the permeability assessed in porcine and human buccal mucosa. There was no change in the degree of either epithelial swelling or desquamation when treating with the pH 9.0 donor medium for 5.5 h. These data suggest that buccal mucosa from pigs can be used to predict human buccal absorption.",

Mucosa-denuded muscles were about 10-fold more sensitive to (-)-isoprenaline than intact muscles. CGP20712A did not affect the concentration-response curves (CRCs) to (-)-isoprenaline, ICI118,551 shifted the CRC further to the right in denuded than in intact strips so that the difference between them was abolished. Combined exposure to \u03b21 -AR and \u03b22 -AR blocker yielded the same result.

New insights on the drugs' action can be provided by a metabolomics-driven approach, which offers a detailed view of the physiological state of an organism. Here, we report a metabolome-wide association study with 295 metabolites in human serum from 1,762 participants of the KORA F4 (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) study population. Our intent was to find variations of metabolite concentrations related to the intake of various drug classes and--based on the associations found--to generate new hypotheses about on-target as well as off-target effects of these drugs. In total, we found 41 significant associations for the drug classes investigated: For beta-blockers (11 associations), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (four assoc.), diuretics (seven assoc.), statins (ten assoc.), and fibrates (nine assoc.) the top hits were pyroglutamine, phenylalanylphenylalanine, pseudouridine, 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphocholine, and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, respectively. For beta-blockers we observed significant associations with metabolite concentrations that are indicative of drug side-effects, such as increased serotonin and decreased free fatty acid levels. Intake of ACE inhibitors and statins associated with metabolites that provide insight into the action of the drug itself on its target, such as an association of ACE inhibitors with des-Arg(9)-bradykinin and aspartylphenylalanine, a substrate and a product of the drug-inhibited ACE. The intake of statins which reduce blood cholesterol levels, resulted in changes in the concentration of metabolites of the biosynthesis as well as of the degradation of cholesterol. Fibrates showed the strongest association with 2-hydroxyisobutyrate which might be a breakdown product of fenofibrate and, thus, a possible marker for the degradation of this drug in the human organism. The analysis of diuretics showed a heterogeneous picture that is difficult to interpret. Taken together, our results provide a basis for a deeper functional understanding of the action and side-effects of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs in the general population.", 
    "247": "Cardiac ischemia and angina pectoris are commonly experienced during exertion in a cold environment. In the current study we tested the hypotheses that oropharyngeal afferent blockade (i.e., local anesthesia of the upper airway with lidocaine) as well as systemic \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockade (i.e., intravenous propranolol) would improve the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand in response to the combined stimulus of cold air inhalation (-15 to -30\u00b0C) and isometric handgrip exercise (Cold + Grip). Young healthy subjects underwent Cold + Grip following lidocaine, propranolol, and control (no drug). Heart rate, blood pressure, and coronary blood flow velocity (CBV, from Doppler echocardiography) were continuously measured. Rate-pressure product (RPP) was calculated, and changes from baseline were compared between treatments. The change in RPP at the end of Cold + Grip was not different between lidocaine (2,441 \u00b1 376) and control conditions (3,159 \u00b1 626); CBV responses were also not different between treatments. With propranolol, heart rate (8 \u00b1 1 vs. 14 \u00b1 3 beats/min) and RPP responses to Cold + Grip were significantly attenuated. However, at peak exercise propranolol also resulted in a smaller \u0394CBV (1.4 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 5.3 \u00b1 1.4 cm/s, P = 0.035), such that the relationship between coronary flow and cardiac metabolism was impaired under propranolol (0.43 \u00b1 0.37 vs. 2.1 \u00b1 0.63 arbitrary units). These data suggest that cold air breathing and isometric exercise significantly influence efferent control of coronary blood flow. Additionally, \u03b2-adrenergic vasodilation may play a significant role in coronary regulation during exercise.",

TIMPs are the main inhibitors of MMPs and have other MMP-independent functions.

In vitro, TIMP-1-4 enhanced smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression in CFs, and TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 enhanced the expression of phosphorylated Smad-3 and phosphorylated transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 type 1 receptor in CFs; this effect was inhibited by TGF-\u03b2 receptor blocker SB-505124. TIMPs-1, -3, and -4 also inhibited the FAK, AKT, and ERK pathways that induce cardiac hypertrophy. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 suppressed apoptosis in cardiomyocytes; in contrast, TIMP-4 induced apoptosis in CFs. TIMP-2 stimulated collagen synthesis. Collagen gels containing TIMP-1 or TIMP-3, which exhibit cardioprotective effects in vitro, were transplanted to the left ventricular anterior wall of a rat heart model of myocardial infarction. Gel-released TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 significantly improved cardiac function and myocardial remodeling and enhanced SMA expression in the infarcted area in ischemic cardiomyopathy model rats. Further, the transplantation of TIMP-1 or TIMP-3 gels inhibited apoptosis in the ischemic myocardium and reduced MMP-2 activity. TIMPs may be an ideal target of cardiac regeneration therapy.",
