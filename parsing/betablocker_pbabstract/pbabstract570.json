These failures occurred in ten children with extra-hepatic portal obstruction and in four with intra-hepatic obstruction. The treatment of these failures was different in these two groups: 7 reoperations in the extra-hepatic obstruction, none in the intra-hepatic. That reoperation is often not suitable in the intrahepatic obstruction because of the hepatic failure. The use of sclerotherapy or the beta receptor blocking agents is discussed in this group.", 
    "1": "The authors follow up the effectiveness and tolerance of monotherapy with acebutolol in 47 patients with light and moderate hypertension, in a dose of 400-1200 mg in the course of three months. Twenty two of the patients have been treatment with the original French drug of the firm \"Specia\" and the rest 25--with the Bulgarian preparation, produced by Pharmachim according to a licence of the French one. The following parameters were followed up: arterial pressure, pulse rate, ECG, eventual adverse effects on 30, 60, 90 day of the treatment. The indices of cardiac output and total peripheral vascular resistance were calculated in a group of 13 patients. The results obtained reveal that the monotherapy with acebutolol, in light and moderate arterial hypertension, leads to definite, lasting and progressive antihypertensive effect in over 75% of the patients. The preparation has no significant effect on pulse rate and induces no orthostatism. It affected the total peripheral vascular resistance with 26% from the initial with unchanged or lightly increased indices of cardiac output. The Bulgarian drug, produced by Pharmachim, gives no way in effectiveness to the original French preparation.", 
    "2": "Altogether 259 tests with intravenous injection of pancreozymin (0.5 Units/kg) were made with and without administering the drugs. It was discovered that isadrin, dopamine, complamin, calcium gluconate, euphylline and papaverine stimulated the pancreatic secretion of lipase and trypsin. It was also found that atropine, the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol and corinfar, a calcium antagonist, consistently inhibited the pancreatic secretion of the enzymes. All those drugs did not favour the escape of the pancreatic enzymes to the blood according to the criterion of trypsinemia. Administration of prednisolone in a single dose or in courses enhanced the pancreatic secretion of the enzymes, while the increased trypsinemia was only noticed in solitary cases. All the data obtained during studies of the pancreotropic properties of the drugs administered in single doses or in courses are discussed from the stand-point of the clinical significance of the findings.", 
    "3": "The use of propranolol since the first hours of myocardial infarction reduced the perinecrotic zone and restricted the zone of myocardial necrosis, decreased the frequency of arrhythmias and did not produce heart insufficiency. The majority of the patients who had suffered myocardial infarction get rid of angina pectoris under the effect of an individually chosen dose of propranolol. They show a more rapid recovery of the physical activity and work fitness. The authors hold that it is desirable that the patients may receive propranolol continuously throughout many years following myocardial infarction.", 
    "4": "A hypotensive effect of corinfar and its effect on the indices of the central and peripheral hemodynamics were studied in 50 patients with stage II hypertension. In 3 weeks BP was lowered at the expense of a considerable decrease in the total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR) (by 29.6%) and regional vascular resistance (by 48%). It was accompanied by an increase in the peripheral blood flow (by 61%), a reflex activation of the sympathetic-adrenal system with an increase in heart rate and cardiac output (by 22%, p less than 0.001). An index of vein distensibility remained unchanged. The addition of propranolol removed signs of the sympathetic stimulation of the cardiac activity, improved vasodilatator tolerance, enhanced a hypotensive effect of corinfar causing a transient increase in TPVR and tension of the resistive vessels only. By the end of the 4th month of therapy these indices significantly decreased. A prolonged combined therapy with corinfar and propranolol resulted in a significant decrease in the resistance of resistive vessels in maximum vasodilatation characterizing the regression of arteriole structural changes. Besides there was a decrease in the wall thickness (p less than 0.01) and left ventricular myocardial mass (by 7.88 +/- 2.66 g, p less than 0.05) that was interpreted as a tendency to a decrease in a degree of hypertrophy of the left ventricle. The efficacy of corinfar therapy was higher in the patients with hypertension with a high initial tension of the peripheral vessels.", 
    "5": "A double-blind crossover study was carried out in 20 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a low fixed-dose combination containing 20 mg penbutolol (a beta-blocking agent) and 3 mg piretanide (a diuretic) in comparison to placebo over a period of 4 weeks. Active drug treatment in the 20 patients studied was preceded by a 1-week period of placebo. The results showed that there was an effective significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with initial levels in the fixed-dose combination group, when compared to the placebo group, both at rest, during maximal ergometric and isometric work load, and also in the diurnal blood pressure profile over 24 hours. Pulse rate also decreased in the combination group. The biochemical, haematological and urinary parameters showed no clinically relevant changes in either group during the entire study period. Minor side-effects definitely or probably associated with the treatment were observed in both groups but were generally mild and did not interfere with treatment. No patient withdrew prematurely from the trial.", 
    "6": "The long-term safety and antihypertensive efficacy of carteolol were evaluated in an open-label, multicenter trial of 245 hypertensive patients. For those patients maintained on carteolol monotherapy, three months of treatment with once-daily oral doses of carteolol ranging from 2.5 to 60 mg reduced the mean recumbent blood pressure by 12/14 mm Hg from baseline values of 151/100. Blood pressure reductions observed at three months were maintained throughout the study. The final daily dose of carteolol for most patients was 10 mg or less. Carteolol was shown to be safe and well tolerated by most patients.", 
    "7": "Endralazine, a novel vasodilator related to hydralazine, exhibits a longer half-life and is only minimally influenced by acetylator status. The antihypertensive action of once daily endralazine has been studied in 17 patients previously controlled with an antihypertensive regimen which included hydralazine and a beta-blocker. Hydralazine was discontinued but other medications were unchanged. Pre-study dosage of hydralazine ranged from 25 mg b.i.d. to 50 mg g.i.d., mean daily dose 126.5 mg. Endralazine was started at a dose of 10 mg o.d. and increased by 10 mg to a maximum of 40 mg o.d. until seated DBP was controlled below 95 mmHg. All 17 patients completed the study. Seated BP significantly decreased from 147.5/99.7 to 133.8/83.9 and standing BP from 145.8/99.2 to 133.6/87.3 mmHg. Ten patients (59%) were successfully controlled with endralazine once daily but 7 patients required twice daily dosage schedules because of lack of BP control at 24 h after dosing or excessive hypotension shortly after dosing. Other adverse effects were headache, palpitations and fatigue. There was a statistically insignificant average weight gain of 1 kg but pedal edema was not observed. Endralazine is an effective antihypertensive agent with adverse symptoms similar to those experienced with hydralazine.", 
    "8": "Pregnant Sherman rats were given propranolol (a) per os (50 mg X kg-1, twice a day) on days 17-19 of gestation, (b) by constant rate infusion: osmotic minipumps (6 mg X kg-1 X day-1) from day 13 of gestation. On day 20 (a-treated) or 21 (b-treated), [14C]-AIB + [3H]-H2O were injected intravenously; plasma and tissue samples were collected at different times up to 4 h (a-treated) or at 2 h (b-treated) for radioactivity measurements. Whatever the treatment, no difference was found between control and treated animals for all parameters studied (number of fetuses; weight, protein; DNA; [14C]-AIB or [3H]-H2O tissue levels) except in propranolol-treated mothers where maternal heart [14C]-AIB uptake was decreased and where fetal plasma and tissue [3H]-H2O levels where higher than control at 5 min. Another set of experiments were performed in a-treated rats. On day 20, each mother was anesthetized with ether and injected as above; maternal plasma sample and one feto-placental unit were collected at different times within 15 min after injection. For this period, [14C]-AIB uptake and mainly [3H]-H2O diffusion were increased in placentae and fetuses of propranolol-treated dams. Arterial blood pressure did not change throughout the experiment in propranolol-treated animals, but decreased in controls. Heart rate was slowed down in the former compared to controls. Thus, in our experimental conditions, propranolol treatment: does not modify fetal weight; has no effect on AIB placental transfer and tissue uptake, and could protect towards the stress of anesthesia and surgical injuries, since H2O transfer was impaired in control but not in treated animals.", 
    "9": "1,25(OH)2D3 slightly increases basal TSH in the incubation media after a 24 h incubation with increasing amounts of the hormone. The TRH induced TSH response increased significantly in the presence of 10(-8)M 1,25(OH)2D3 (P less than 0.05). The intracellular concentration of TSH after the TRH test showed a slight decreasing tendency after a 24 h incubation with increasing amounts of 1,25(OH)2D3. The presence of verapamil (10(-8) M) and propranolol (10(-8) M) blunted the enhancing effect of 1,25(OH)2D3. The results indicate an effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the secretion of TSH.", 
    "10": "In experiments on dogs, the spontaneous movements of the small bowel were in all cases enhanced by the alpha 2-blocker phentolamine, while they were not influenced, or were slightly decreased, by the beta 1-blocker practolol. Neither drug caused a change in the noradrenaline content of the intestinal wall. In the same animals, the joint administration of phentolamine and practolol led to a considerable increased small bowel motility, and to a significant decrease in the noradrenaline level of the intestinal wall. The results are in agreement with experimental data indicating that presynaptic alpha-receptors play a primary role in the sympathetic regulation of small bowel motility.", 
    "11": "To assess the role of peripheral sympathetic nerves in the regulation of calcitonin release, rats subjected to superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx) 16-28 h earlier were used. The time periods selected allowed us to examine C cell response during the supraliminal release of sympathetic transmitter that accompanies anterograde degeneration of nerve varicosities as well as during the neural paralysis that ensues thereafter. At the time intervals examined, SCGx did not result in significant changes of basal serum calcitonin or Ca levels. The intraperitoneal administration of CaCl2 brought about an impending increase of serum Ca to the same extent in SCGx and sham-operated rats. A significant depression of calcitonin release was observed in rats killed around the time of nerve terminal degeneration (16-21 h post SCGx) but not about 10 h later. Additionally a delay to achieve a maximal calcitonin response was apparent during nerve degeneration. Injection of the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine significantly increased basal calcitonin levels and restored the depressed calcitonin response to hypercalcemia seen in SCGx rats. Treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor-blocker propranolol counteracted phenoxybenzamine activity but was unable to modify per se calcitonin release in SCGx or sham-operated rats. Basal Ca levels and their increase after intraperitoneal CaCl2 were similar in all examined groups regardless of the drug injected. In an additional experiment phenoxybenzamine injected into SCGx rats in doses one-fifth those employed earlier still reversed both the depression in maximal calcitonin response as well as the delay to attain maximal release after CaCl2, but was unable to affect basal calcitonin levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "The effect of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug propranolol was investigated in patients with alcoholic liver disease and in those without liver disease before and after ten days treatment with 80 mg daily. Caffeine as a marker drug for the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible subtype had a significantly enhanced clearance after propranolol in liver-diseased patients, while the clearance of antipyrine which represents the phenobarbital-inducible subtype was unchanged. D-glucaric acid excretion as an endogenous compound which serves as an indicator of induced state of drug-metabolizing capacity of the liver was slightly enhanced in liver patients, but significantly decreased in patients without liver disorders. Indocyanine green elimination as a test material for substances limiting liver blood flow was not significantly reduced by this propranolol dosage.", 
    "13": "The effects of oxprenolol, a non-selective beta-blocker with moderate intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), given by the Oros delivery system, on resting and exercise heart rate and blood pressure have been compared over a 24-h period with those of atenolol, a beta 1-selective blocker without ISA. The effects on maximal and submaximal exercise tolerance and perceived exertion were studied in relation to the level of beta-blockade. 9 healthy subjects were treated with placebo, atenolol, 100 mg/day and oxprenolol Oros, 16/260 mg/day in random order, each for 5 days. Progressive maximal exercise tests and submaximal endurance tests at 80% of maximum aerobic exercise capacity were performed 2, 5 and 24 h after intake of the drugs. The reduction of blood pressure 2 and 5 h after drug intake was less pronounced after oxprenolol Oros than after atenolol, but by 24 h after the last dose the effects were similar. The peak level of beta-blockade (i.e. reduction in maximal exercise heart rate) was similar after oxprenolol Oros and atenolol. The minimal level of beta-blockade 24 h after the last dose was greater after oxprenolol Oros than after atenolol. Maximal exercise capacity and submaximal exercise tolerance were impaired after both beta-blockers. The subjective feeling of exertion did not differ between placebo, atenolol and oxprenolol Oros when related to the relative work load, except after the first minute of exercise, when the rating of perceived exertion was higher after atenolol.", 
    "14": "A study of the main hemorheological and hemostatic indices of the blood of 60 patients with unstable angina revealed considerable changes that required correction. The use of hemosorption (HS) produced a positive effect on a clinical course of disease as well as the patients' hemorheological status. However the HS effect maintained for 5 days and the use of drugs was required to prolong a sorption effect. The combined use of propranolol, trental and colpharit made a favorable effect on microcirculation owing to the improvement of rheological, coagulation and fibrinolytic properties of the blood.", 
    "15": "The cerebrovascular consequences of the gentle restraint commonly used for the measurement of local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) in conscious rats has been tested by using two drugs, propranolol and diazepam. Propranolol induced small LCBF decreases in 7 structures suggesting that the cerebral circulation was partially controlled by the activation of intra or extracerebral aminergic pathways in this protocol. Sedative doses of diazepam reduced LCBF in most of the structures but anxiolytic doses increased it in 4 structures. This effect may be due to a regionally differentiated modification of activity in the brain due to the selective inhibition of limbic structures by diazepam. Since propranolol and diazepam induced only small changes, the LCBF of gently restrained rats appeared to be minimally affected by the stressful situation imposed by the protocol.", 
    "16": "Whole-body microvibrations (MV) in three dimensions were measured in 51 volunteers, all medical students, 26 without and 25 with beta-receptor blockade (propranolol), immediately before a practical physiology examination and during the ensuing vacation. Propranolol impeded the increase in MV values in all three axes, significantly those in the z axis (vertical), the differences in MV values between the two measurements being minimal in the beta-receptor blocked group. On the other hand, propranolol enhanced MV in the x axis (anteroposterior) and the y axis (transverse), the y axis difference being significant only in females. Propranolol obviously relieves examination stress: the majority of candidates (52%) felt \"quieter\" in the examination with than in other similar situations without beta-receptor blockade. Propranolol was, however, without effect on the examination results. The rectified impulse in the z axis when related to body weight (Jz) correlates linearly with the calculated cardiac output. Propranolol, however, reduced cardiac output more than Jz, pointing to a Jz component non-sensitive to beta-receptor blockade. The part played by muscle tonus, mainly reflected in the y axis, thus remains unknown. The large and slow oscillations in the x and y axes, observed particularly in beta-receptor blocked females, might be attributed to diminution in standing ability.", 
    "17": "A single-blind, three-way Latin square crossover study without wash-out periods was performed in a general practice. Thirty moderately hypertensive patients were studied to compare the antihypertensive effect of 160 mg sustained-release oxprenolol once daily, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide/50 mg triamterene once daily or a combination of the two preparations once daily, each treatment being given for 1 month. Blood pressure control was significantly better with the combination than with either agent used separately. Pulse rates, as expected, were lower when sustained-release oxprenolol was taken either alone or in the combination. Adverse events led to withdrawal in 1 patient only. Otherwise, all treatments were well tolerated and compliance was excellent. Renal function tests indicated a slight increase in creatinine, urate and urea levels after the treatments which included hydrochlorothiazide compared with oxprenolol alone, although the results were of no clinical significance.", 
    "18": "Female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized, given estrogen, and blood samples were obtained via an atrial catheter in the afternoon during the prolactin (PRL) surge. Restraint stress applied at 16.00 h and continued for 3 h resulted in marked decrease in plasma prolactin (PRL) and an increase in plasma corticosterone (B). The neural mechanism(s) involved in the plasma PRL decrease to restraint stress in the afternoon were examined using neural agonists and antagonists. The administration of pimozide, a dopamine antagonist, increased plasma PRL and completely prevented the restraint-induced decrease in PRL. This result suggested that an increase in dopamine secretion mediated the stress-induced decrease of PRL in the afternoon. In unrestrained animals, the intravenous administration of atropine (a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist), arecoline (a muscarinic cholinergic agonist), propranolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist) and morphine (a beta-endorphin agonist) at 16.00 h decreased plasma PRL from that of vehicle-injected animals. Bicuculline (a GABAergic antagonist) had no effect while phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic antagonist) and phenoxybenzamine (an alpha-adrenergic antagonist) initially increased and then decreased plasma PRL. Naloxone (a beta-endorphin antagonist) initially decreased and then increased plasma PRL in unrestrained animals. In restrained animals, the intravenous administration of atropine and naloxone had no effect on the decrease in plasma PRL. Bicuculline and propranolol decreased plasma PRL below that observed for restrained animals alone, while phentolamine and morphine slightly retarded the course of the decrease. Arecoline did not alter the PRL decrease to restraint in the early sample periods but was followed by a rebound increase at later times.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Nine patients who had been treated for hypertension for many years with atenolol in a dose of 100 mg/day took part in this 18-month study, during which the dosage alternated between 50 and 100 mg/day for two-month periods. Blood pressure, heart rate, serum triglycerides and cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) lipids were checked at the end of each period. Altogether 27 and 32 measurements were made at the 50 and 100 mg dose levels respectively. Heart rate was lower by three beats/min (p less than 0.05) at the higher dose, but blood pressure and serum lipids and HDL cholesterol were not significantly different at the two dose levels.", 
    "20": "The centrally mediated cardiovascular changes induced by clonidine were studied in conscious rats. Clonidine administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), and intravenously (i.v.) caused hypotension following an initial pressor response. I.v. clonidine caused significant greater hypotension than i.c.v. clonidine (30 micrograms/kg; p less than 0.05). With the 30 micrograms/kg i.c.v. dose, a tachycardia was observed in all rats following initial transient bradycardia. No tachycardia was observed when clonidine was administered i.v. Propranolol (3 mg/kg i.v.) did not modify the cardiovascular actions of i.c.v. clonidine except initial pressure response. While combined treatment with propranolol (3 mg/kg i.v.) and atropine (1 mg/kg i.v.) abolished both the bradycardic and tachycardic actions of i.c.v. clonidine (30 micrograms/kg), but did not modulate the hypotensive action. Yohimbine (30 micrograms/kg i.c.v.) converted the hypotension induced by i.c.v. clonidine (30 micrograms/kg) to hypertension, attenuated the bradycardia but did not modulate the tachycardia. The same dose of i.c.v. yohimbine attenuated the hypotensive effect of i.v. clonidine (30 micrograms/kg) but did not affect the initial pressor response. Prazosin (30 micrograms/kg i.c.v.) did not modulate either phase of the heart rate response to i.c.v. clonidine. These results provide evidence of centrally mediated pressor and tachycardic actions of clonidine in conscious rats. The tachycardia appears to be mediated through the inhibition of parasympathetic tone and is not dependent on alpha-adrenoceptor mechanism. In conscious rats the opposing influence of centrally mediated pressor and depressor actions may result in the apparently low hypotensive potency of i.c.v. clonidine.", 
    "21": "Serum lipoproteins were analysed in 11 hypertensive patients before and after 2 and 16 months on pindolol therapy. In all patients significant blood pressure reductions were achieved with a mean pindolol dose of 13 mg (range 5-30) per day at 16 months' follow-up. After 2 months a significant increase by 35% was found in VLDL TG and cholesterol concentrations, but after 16 months all lipoprotein values had reverted to pretreatment levels. HDL did not change during pindolol therapy. It is not established whether the lack of long-term effects of pindolol on serum lipoprotein is specifically due to its high degree of intrinsic sympatomimetic activity.", 
    "22": "A study of bronchial permeability in 98 patients with acute pneumonia during clinico-roentgenological convalescence using a method of the analysis of the flow-volume loop diagram showed disorders of bronchial permeability in 73.46% of the patients, of them obvious disorders in 21.42% and latent ones in 52.04%. Hyperreactivity of the tracheobronchial tree to acetylcholine was established in 84.4% of the patients without signs of obvious obstruction and in some cases only to obsidan indicating the presence of disorders of vagotonic regulation without change in the functioning of beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "23": "The effects of therapeutic concentrations of antihypertensive drugs on catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities in term placental explants were studied. The enzyme activities were measured in tissue fractions using radioenzymatic techniques. At 6 h the incubation COMT activity increased significantly following exposure to verapamil and hydralazine, while exposure to alpha methyldopa caused a significant suppression of the enzyme. At 24 h exposure to hydralazine significantly suppressed the COMT activity. By 6 h the MAO activity was significantly suppressed by verapamil. MgSO4 and propranolol had no effect on the activities of COMT and MAO at 6 and 24 h. These results suggest that COMT and MAO activities in the placenta can be modulated by antihypertensive drugs and, therefore, these drugs might affect local catechol metabolism.", 
    "24": "Seven sets of plasma concentration-time data were fitted to both a conventional biexponential equation and a gamma equation. The values of clearance (CL) and mean residence time (MRT) were calculated from the fitted parameters and compared with the values calculated by the trapezoid rule. Both the biexponential and gamma equations provided adequate fits to the data. The values of CL and MRT calculated from the biexponential fits correlated very closely with the values calculated by the trapezoid rule, but there were large discrepancies between the values calculated from the gamma fits and the trapezoid rule. The biexponential model appears to be less sensitive to scatter in the data.", 
    "25": "The haemodynamic effects of concomitant intravenous administration of disopyramide (Norpace) and atenolol (Tenormin) were studied in a cross-over trial in 7 patients with ischaemic heart disease. Following 150 mg disopyramide i.v. the cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume index (SVI) decreased by 14% and 26%, respectively and the heart rate (HR) and preejection period index (PEPI) increased by 13% and 19%, respectively. A decrease in CI of 14% and HR of 21%, respectively were noted after intravenous administration of 7.5 mg atenolol; PEPI increased by 10% whereas SVI remained unchanged. The cardiac Index (CI) fell by 33% following the administration of both drugs. The effect on CI of the two drugs was additive. The effect of disopyramide and atenolol on HR, SVI and PEPI was not significantly modified by coadministration of the other drug. No change in blood pressure was observed after disopyramide or atenolol. A correlation (rho) of 0.540 and 0.387 was observed between the change in PEPI and the log free and total serum concentrations of disopyramide, respectively. Combined intravenous use of the two drugs in patients with incipient or overt heart failure is not recommended, unless it is due to the arrhythmia to be treated.", 
    "26": "The haemodynamic effect of indenolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) in animals, has been evaluated in a double-blind cross-over randomized trial after acute (3 days) and long-term treatment (28 days), in 12 hypertensive patients in comparison with that of propranolol. Patients were evaluated at rest and during isometric exercise (hand grip). The overall acute effect of both beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs was to decrease mean blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output, while total peripheral resistance increased. In the long-term studies the haemodynamic effect of propranolol was still characterized by cardiodepression and unchanged peripheral resistance. Patients on the long-term treatment with indenolol showed normal cardiac output and reduced total peripheral resistance. The data are compatible with a relatively strong ISA of indenolol, which would be responsible for the haemodynamic pattern observed during chronic treatment.", 
    "27": "The long-term efficacy of a new vasodilator, cadralazine (ISF 2469), and chlorthalidone have been compared in 20 hypertensive patients not adequately controlled by atenolol. After 4 weeks of treatment with atenolol 100 mg once daily, patients whose diastolic blood pressure was greater than 95 mmHg were randomly divided into two groups to receive in addition to atenolol, either cadralazine 15 mg once daily or chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily. Both treatments were administered for 6 months. At the end of treatment with atenolol and after 3 and 6 months of combination therapy, blood pressure and heart rate were measured at rest and during bicycle exercise 24 h after the last dose. Compared to atenolol alone, both cadralazine and chlorthalidone caused a significant and similar reduction in resting blood pressure. Both groups showed an increase in diastolic blood pressure during exercise while receiving atenolol alone. The addition of chlorthalidone did not modify the pressor response to exercise, whereas patients taking cadralazine had a decrease in exercise diastolic blood pressure, which was fully evident after 6 months of therapy. The reduction in exercise diastolic blood pressure induced by cadralazine was proportional to the increase in exercise heart rate, suggesting a fall in peripheral vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Serum lipoprotein lipid and apoprotein concentrations were determined in 21 hypertensive men during administration of two beta-blockers, penbutolol or atenolol, for 6 months preceded by a 4 week placebo period. Post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities were also measured. There was a trend to an increase of triglyceride and VLDL triglyceride concentrations during penbutolol administration, but the changes were not significant. Penbutolol also increased the total cholesterol by 11% at 3 months (mainly due to increase of VLDL cholesterol), but this effect diminished at 6 months. Atenolol did not cause any significant change in the total cholesterol but increased HDL cholesterol by 7% at 1 month, the change being due to rise of the HDL3. The HDL3 accounted also for a significant decrease of HDL cholesterol seen in the men receiving penbutolol at 6 months. HDL2 cholesterol as well as the LDL/HDL2 cholesterol ratio remained unchanged in both groups. Neither drug consistently influenced the postheparin plasma lipase activities or the serum apoprotein A or B concentrations. In contrast to an earlier study the results suggest that the clinically most important HDL subfraction, the HDL2, remains unaffected during treatment with beta-blockers.", 
    "29": "Experiments were performed in anaesthetized rats to investigate the vasodilator actions of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bucindolol. Bucindolol (3 mg/kg) lowered blood pressure significantly in rats pretreated with (i) prazosin (0.4 mg/kg) (ii) prazosin (0.4 mg/kg) plus propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) or (iii) labetalol (0.5 mg/kg). Thus, a portion of the hypotensive effect of bucindolol was independent of effects on alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors. This was attributed to direct vasodilatation. In reserpinized anaesthetized rats bucindolol increased heart rate and thus had an intrinsic sympathomimetic action (ISA). The ISA was equipotent with that of isoprenaline at the 0.25 nmol/kg dose level, but declined with increasing bucindolol doses, probably due to the onset of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. An isolated perfused rat tail arteries constricted by perfusing with a high-K+ Krebs solution, bucindolol (10(-5) mol/l, 10(-4) mol/l) caused a significant reduction in perfusion pressure indicative of vasodilatation. Since the perfusate contained 10(-6) mol/l propranolol, the vasodilatation was not due to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. These results are consistent with a direct vasodilator action of bucindolol. We suggest bucindolol lowers blood pressure by a complex mechanism involving beta-adrenoceptor blockade, alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, vasodilatation and perhaps beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "30": "Knowing the in vivo inhibitory effect of the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists on gastric mucosa carbonic anhydrase and the high clinical efficacy of \"Ulcosilvanil\" in the healing of gastric and duodenal ulcers, the authors combined propranolol with smaller doses of \"Ulcosilvanil\" in 925 active duodenal ulcer patients, divided into four groups. The first 236 patients were treated with small doses of \"Ulcosilvanil\" (20 mg/kg b.w./day active substance), the second group (of 258 cases) with high doses (35 mg/kg b.w./day) of \"Ulcosilvanil\", the third one (182 subjects) with propranolol only (60 mg/day) and the fourth group (349 patients) with small doses of \"Ulcosilvanil\" associated with 60 mg/day propranolol. Pain disappeared in all the cases of groups 1,2 and 4 after 3-6 days of treatment and in 40% of the third group. Basal acid output decreased, after 10 days of treatment, from 6.15 +/- 1.57 to 1.94 +/- 0.66 mEq/h in the first group (p less than 0.001), from 7.98 +/- 2.34 to 0.01 +/- 0.01 mEq/h in the second group (p less than 0.001), from 6.43 +/- 2.45 to 2.09 +/- 0.50 mEq/h in the third group (p less than 0.02) and from 6.76 +/- 2.80 to 0.011 +/- 0.01 mEq/h in the fourth group (p less than 0.001). Endoscopic healing was achieved, after 14 days of treatment, respectively in 78.5%, 92.4%, 51.6% and 88.41%; this percentages increased to 82.3%, 96.8%, 68.1% and 93.5% after 21 day of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "The role of central adrenergic receptors in the control of vasopressin release was studied in the conscious rat. Norepinephrine (10 micrograms) and the alpha-1 agonist, phenylephrine (50 micrograms), administered intracerebroventricularly resulted in significant increases in the plasma vasopressin concentration and blood pressure. The alpha-2 agonist, BHT 933 (50 micrograms) and the beta agonist, isoproterenol (10 micrograms) both caused a significant decrease in the plasma vasopressin concentration with only small changes in blood pressure. The central administration of the alpha-1 antagonist corynanthine (20 micrograms) had no effect on the plasma vasopressin concentration; however, increases in plasma vasopressin levels were observed when either the alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine (20 micrograms) or the beta antagonist propranolol (20 micrograms) were given. It is concluded that central noradrenergic pathways may play an important role in the control of vasopressin release and that this control may involve alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta adrenoreceptors.", 
    "32": "Hemodynamic effects of a new inotropic agent, OPC-8212 (2(1H)-quinolinone derivative) were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs pretreated with propranolol and diltiazem. Three doses (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) of OPC-8212 were administered intravenously and the net hemodynamic effect (% change) was obtained by subtraction of the effect of the solvent from the gross effect, since the vehicle has a transient, but significant hemodynamic effect. The maximal inotropic effect occurred 3 minutes after administration: LV dP/dt max and cardiac output (CO) increased by 19 +/- 2.5% and 28 +/- 8.5%, respectively, at 3 mg/kg. These cardiotonic effects were dose-dependent, whereas heart rate, peak LV pressure (PLVP) and mean aortic pressure were minimally changed at any dose. Accordingly, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased in a dose-dependent manner although the decrease was much less than that in administration of isoproterenol. The inotropic effect was not blocked by beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol 1 mg/kg), indicating that the cardiotonic action of this agent is not due to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Thus, this agent could reverse beta-blocker-induced heart failure. During infusion of diltiazem (0.1 mg/kg/min following bolus intravenous administration of 0.5 mg/kg), the increases in LV dP/dt max and CO due to OPC-8212 were similar to those in the control study. In contrast to the effects under beta-adrenoceptor blockade, however, decreased PLVP was restored by OPC-8212. Neither chronotropic nor rrhythmogenic effects were observed in the control or with either pharmacological intervention. These results indicate that OPC-8212 has a potent inotropic action with modest vasodilatory effect even with propranolol or diltiazem pretreatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "The blood flow pattern in the common umbilical vein is under normal conditions nonpulsatile in contrast to the flow in the fetal inferior vena cava. We observed pulsatile flow patterns in the common umbilical vein of fetal lambs during changes in the fetal hemodynamic equilibrium. These pulsations may influence the mixing of oxygen-rich ductus venosus blood and oxygen-poor inferior vena cava blood. This study deals with the phasic changes in umbilical venous blood flow during cord occlusion. The experiments were performed in eight chronically instrumented fetal lambs between 114 and 133 days gestation (term 146 days). Umbilical venous blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flow transducer around the intraabdominal common part of both umbilical veins. The fetuses were provided with catheter in the fetal abdominal aorta and with electrodes for monitoring arterial blood pressure and heart rate. Occlusion of the umbilical cord was performed by means of an inflatable balloon occluder around the total cord (occlusion time 20 to 90 seconds). Occlusions were performed in fetuses with an intact autonomic nervous system and after blockade of the alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic or cholinergic part of the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "34": "Norepinephrine (NE) and histamine (His) cause a dose related increase in the rate of the guinea pig isolated right atria. The rate increase induced by both amines has been shown to be mediated by pharmacologically different receptors. His shifted the NE CEC to the right in a non parallel fashion. Cimetidine (10(-4) mol/l) abolished this antagonism. Norepinephrine (3 X 10(-7) mol/l) shifted to the right the His CEC also in a non parallel fashion. Practolol (10(-4) mol/l) abolished this antagonism. Theophylline (10(-4) mol/l) reverted both: the antagonistic action of His related to the NE chronotropic effect and the antagonistic action of NE related to the His chronotropic effect. The reversal of the antagonism could be the result of the block of purinergic P1-receptors by theophylline. This block impairs the chronotropic effect of adenilic compounds which can function as a modulater of cardiac rate through a negative feed back mechanism.", 
    "35": "Stress-induced hypokalemia represents a transient risk factor for malignant arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery disease. The adrenergic nervous system serves as a major control system for the transport of potassium across the cell membrane. Nonselective beta-blockade presents epinephrine-mediated hypokalemia. This helps explain a possible mechanism for the significant improvement in morbidity and mortality rates of patients taking long-term propranolol therapy in the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial report.", 
    "36": "A prospective, randomized, double-blind between-patient study was carried out to compare the efficacy and tolerance of atenolol with nifedipine and atenolol with diuretic. Ninety-eight hypertensive patients inadequately controlled after 1-month's treatment with 100 mg atenolol alone once daily received, in addition, either 20 mg nifedipine twice daily or 5 mg amiloride plus 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily for a further 8 weeks. The results of blood pressure measurements in the lying and standing positions showed that the mean reduction in standing blood pressure from atenolol baseline was 28/12 mmHg for atenolol/diuretic and 18/13 mmHg for atenolol/nifedipine. The only significant difference between treatments in blood pressure control was in lying systolic blood pressure favouring atenolol/diuretic and a trend in favour of this combination for standing systolic blood pressure. Both regimens were reasonably well tolerated, although 19 patients withdrew during the course of the trial because of side-effects (2 on atenolol alone, 10 on atenolol/diuretic and 7 on atenolol/nifedipine).", 
    "37": "Noxious electric stimulation may release sympathetic mediators, since subcutaneously administered propranolol inhibited a peripheral analgesic effect by decreasing the vocalizing response of conscious guinea pigs to electric stimulation. Local injection of noradrenaline and isoprenaline induced increased vocalization to stimulation. Propranolol inhibited the effect of noradrenaline. The activation of beta-adrenergic receptors may participate in peripheral nociceptive information.", 
    "38": "We measured the aggressive behavior of isolated mice treated or not with d,1-amphetamine (6.0 mg/kg, ip) and injected with different doses of d,1-propranolol (10.0, 20.0 or 30.0 mg/kg, ip) or haloperidol (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg). d,1-Amphetamine (6.0 mg/kg, ip) decreased the aggressiveness of the isolated mice and induced stereotyped behavior. Haloperidol antagonized amphetamine-induced stereotypy, increased the latency to the 1st attack and decreased duration of fighting and frequency of attacks in mice treated or not with amphetamine. d,1-Propranolol did not change stereotypy but decreased aggressiveness in a dose-dependent way, being more effective against aggression induced by isolation per se. These results are discussed in terms of the interference of the drugs with the activity of either catecholaminergic neurons or midbrain reticular formation. The latter effect seems to be the most likely explanation for the observed anti-aggressive effects of haloperidol and d-1, propranolol.", 
    "39": "Brain catecholamines (noradrenaline and dopamine) seem to suppress certain forms of epileptic activity. In this paper we report the catecholaminergic influences on hippocampal paroxysmal activity in rats induced through hippocampal electrical stimulation via stereotaxic electrode placements. The experiments included: (1) systemic injections of clonidine (0.10 mg/kg); phenoxybenzamine (10 mg/kg); propranolol (10 mg/kg); apomorphine (1 mg/kg) and haloperidol (1 mg/kg) and (2) electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus ipsilateral to the stimulated hippocampus. The clonidine group showed a great reduction, while animals which received phenoxybenzamine showed a significant increase in the electrographic seizure activity. Propranolol produced only a transient reduction of epileptic activity. We did not observe any significant change in the epileptic discharges following apomorphine and haloperidol injections. Electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus induced a clear enhancement of the epileptiform activity. The results presented here support the view that noradrenergic, but not dopaminergic systems, may exert a tonic inhibitor effect on hippocampal epileptic activity.", 
    "40": "The vascular responses to acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE), KCl, and diltiazem were examined before and after removal of endothelial cells by an intraluminal bolus injection of saponin (1 mg) in isolated and perfused dog coronary arteries. Without any precontraction, ACh induced a long-lasting vasodilation in small doses (less than 1 microgram), and an initial brief vasoconstriction was occasionally accompanied in large doses. These vascular responses to ACh were not significantly affected by the pretreatment with propranolol (5 X 10(-6) mol/l). The endothelial removal by intraluminal saponin was confirmed electron microscopically. After 20-60 min of saponin treatment, the responses to drugs were observed and compared with the control. The ACh-induced vasodilation was significantly attenuated by saponin (P less than 0.01), but the ACh-induced vasoconstriction was not affected by it. The vasodilation was blocked by atropine. The NE- and KCl-induced vasoconstrictions and diltiazem-induced vasodilation were not affected by saponin treatment. It is suggested that: (1) ACh produced a vasodilation in the nonpreconstricted condition of dog coronary arteries; (2) the vasodilation caused by ACh is mostly endothelium-dependent, which is considered to be mediated by muscarinic receptors; and (3) the vascular responses to NE, KCl, and diltiazem and the vasoconstriction produced by ACh are not influenced by removal of the endothelium in a relatively large epicardial coronary artery of the dog.", 
    "41": "Healthy subjects show, in a special pressure compliance test of the optic nerve head, signs of autoregulation of optic nerve head circulation. In this test visual evoked response (VER) amplitudes were recorded during stepwise increased intraocular pressures. In the resulting VER amplitude/pressure curves glaucoma patients did not show the sign of autoregulation of optic nerve head circulation which is seen in healthy subjects. It is known that topically applied timolol maleate may affect optic nerve head circulation. Therefore the pressure compliance test was performed in 20 healthy eyes before and after 3 days of topically applied timolol maleate 0.5%. The aim of the study was to test the effect of topically applied timolol on optic nerve head autoregulation. In addition we determined the ocular perfusion pressures, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. While the ocular perfusion pressures show a slight, but statistically not significant, decrease under timolol, the systemic parameters and the autoregulation behavior did not change.", 
    "42": "The efficacy of captopril alone or in combination with indapamide was evaluated in 17 patients with severe hypertension (diastolic greater than 120 mmHg) previously treated with triple antihypertensive therapy, i.e. diuretic, beta-blocker and a vasodilator. After a wash-out period of 1 week, captopril was given initially as 75 mg/day for 2 weeks; at the end of this period, the dosage was doubled to 150 mg/day and continued at this level for a further 2 weeks. Indapamide (2.5 mg/day) was then added to the regimen and administered for 1 month. The results showed that captopril alone lowered, but did not normalize the blood pressure. The mean diastolic pressure was reduced to 117 and 103.8 mmHg after dosages of captopril of 75 mg and 150 mg, respectively. On the addition of indapamide, the blood pressure was normalized to 93.82 mmHg mean diastolic pressure. Systolic readings were similarly reduced. Two patients developed skin rashes while on captopril alone: no other treatment-related side-effects were reported once indapamide therapy had commenced.", 
    "43": "A large, open, multi-centre study was performed by physicians in general practice to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of pindolol (10 to 20 mg per day) in the treatment of patients with essential hypertension. The records of 7324 patients who completed the 6-week protocol with pindolol alone or in combination with a diuretic were analyzed by computer. Substantial reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were obtained in the majority of patients regardless of age, sex or race. No difference in blood pressure response was found between patients taking diuretics concurrently and those on pindolol alone. Side-effects were generally not troublesome and a trend toward a reducing incidence of side-effects was noted in all patients as the duration of therapy increased. Black patients tended to complain of fewer side-effects than did white patients.", 
    "44": "Blood pressure (BP) and metabolic variables were determined initially and after 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10 years' treatment in two groups of hypertensive men (n = 53 each) randomized to bendroflumethiazide 2.5-5 mg/day or propranolol 160-320 mg daily. There was no significant differences in BP or metabolic variables between the two groups at entry. BP was reduced to the same degree by both treatments. Five men in the propranolol group and one man in the thiazide group developed clinically overt diabetes during follow-up. Fasting blood sugar increased slightly but significantly though equally in both groups. Oral glucose tolerance was initially impaired to the same degree in both groups but improved significantly during treatment with both drugs. Fasting insulin increased slightly but to the same degree. While serum potassium decreased significantly in the thiazide group, the total body potassium was unchanged in this group. In the propranolol group, serum potassium rose, while total body potassium decreased significantly. Serum urate increased in both groups, though slightly more during thiazide treatment. One case of gout was found in each group. There was no difference in serum lipids between the two groups. The finding in this long-term trial indicate that in middle-aged men with mild to moderate hypertension a low-dose thiazide diuretic like bendroflumethiazide is as effective and safe an antihypertensive agent as the beta-blocker propranolol is and that it does not induce diabetes. The total clinical picture favors the retention of thiazide diuretics as a first choice drug in hypertension.", 
    "45": "Monotherapy with Ketanserin, a serotonin receptor antagonist, reduces blood pressure in a sizeable number of patients with essential hypertension. The present study was designed to compare its antihypertensive potency with those of metoprolol in a double-blind treatment and further to study its long-term efficacy and safety in a one-year open trial, alone or combined to metoprolol, according to diastolic blood pressure (DBP) normalization. Twenty-four patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly assigned to two parallel treatment groups, one group (n = 11) received Ketanserin (40 mg/day) and the other one (n = 13) metoprolol (200 mg/day). After 3 months double-blind treatment, all patients received Ketanserin, on an open basis for one year alone or combined to metoprolol if Ketanserin failed to normalize DBP. A significant antihypertensive effect was demonstrated after 3 months double-blind treatment, for Ketanserin and metoprolol, in both standing and supine position (p less than 0.01). Heart rate showed a clear decrease by metoprolol (p less than 0.01). In the one-year follow-up, patients were divided in: I (n = 7) patients on Ketanserin (previously treated with the same drug); II (n = 4) patients on Ketanserin plus metoprolol (previously treated with Ketanserin, in whom it failed to normalize DBP); and III (n = 13) patients on Ketanserin (previously treated with metoprolol). In group I the blood pressure lowering effect of Ketanserin remained constant after one-year follow-up. In group II, although the number of patients was insufficient, a trend in the decrease of parameters was observed. In group III, supine and standing DBP diminished from 92.5 +/- 8 and 92.5 +/- 7 during treatment with metoprolol to 83.6 +/- 9 and 79.8 +/- 8 mmHg respectively at 12 months, after treatment with Ketanserin (p less than 0.05); accordingly, the cumulative percentage of normalized DBP increased from 4/13 after metoprolol to 12/13 at the end of the trial. Ketanserin side effects were minimal. Taking into account the wide variety of contraindications or side effects with beta-blockers and diuretics, Ketanserin appears as a new and important alternative in the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "46": "Urgent hypertension is defined by severe elevations of blood pressure without associated end-organ damage. The use of parenteral agents for this entity entails intensive monitoring and the potential for significant hemodynamic complications. Therefore, various oral regimens have been studied. Herein described are mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and side effects of oral agents used in the treatment of urgent hypertension.", 
    "47": "Tertatolol is rapidly (tmax: 1.25 h) and totally absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract with a low presystemic metabolism, and the bioavailability (60%) is not affected by food intake. Although clearance is low (130 ml/min), half-life is short (3 h) due to a restricted volume of distribution. Tertatolol is extensively metabolized (99%) to 9 metabolites with three equally important pathways, sulfoxidation, hydroxylation and conjugation. The half-life is not altered in hypertensive patients. It is increased in the elderly (7 h) and in patients with renal failure (9 h, irrespective of creatinine levels). However, considering the once-daily regimen, the recommended dose (5 mg/24 h) does not need to be altered in these patients. In hepatic disease, the modifications of pharmacokinetic parameters correlate with the severity (t1/2 = 14.5 h in the severe group). Taking into account the extensive metabolism of the drug, this justifies halving the dose in patients with cirrhosis and prothrombin time less than 70%. The kinetics are linear over a 10-fold dosage range and, after repeated dosing, there is no accumulation. Despite the short half-life, and because of a flat plasma level response curve, beta-blockade continues for 24 h following a 5-mg dose.", 
    "48": "The effects of beta 1-blockade were investigated in 18 hypertensive pregnant diabetic women. The same women served as controls, covering a period just before therapy. The blood pressure was reduced in 14 women (p less than 0.01). The change in blood glucose homeostasis was statistically not different from the control period. Insulin doses were not affected. The fetal heart rate was affected by therapy, causing a decrease in baseline rate (p less than 0.05) and in acceleration amplitude (p less than 0.05). Although the incidence of suspect fetal distress, intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery was high, all surviving infants had normal Apgar scores at 5 and 10 min. Perinatal mortality consisted of one stillbirth. Except for respiratory problems, the incidence of neonatal complications was low. All survivors were healthy at follow-up. We found beta 1-blockade to be effective and safe in this group of high-risk pregnancies, and suggest it as an alternative for anti-hypertensive therapy in diabetic pregnancy.", 
    "49": "Although nitrates are the basic treatment for patients with ischemic heart disease and numerous clinical studies have compared the anti-ischemic effects of different combinations with beta-blockers and/or calcium antagonists, no study is known on a controlled intraindividual comparison of the combination nitrate plus beta-blocker with the combination nitrate plus a heart rate-decreasing calcium-antagonist. Therefore we performed a randomized, double-blind and crossover study to compare the effects of 80 mg isosorbide dinitrate in slow-release form (ISDN, once-daily) plus 120 mg verapamil (t.i.d.) with those of 80 mg ISDN plus 80 mg propranolol (b.i.d.). After these two phases of 3 weeks' duration respectively, patients received the combination of all three drugs with the same dosages in a single-blind manner. In addition to the standard inclusion criteria, a pathological exercise-ECG even after ISDN was required as well as a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of greater than or equal to 35%. This protocol could be completed in 26 of the 30 enrolled patients. The combination ISDN plus verapamil proved to exert the same anti-ischemic effects as the combination ISDN plus propranolol. The triple therapy showed a further improvement of exercise induced ischemia without deterioration of the EF at rest or during exercise. Even though only this triple therapy led to an optimal anti-ischemic result in about one third of the patients, it should be initiated cautiously, since symptomatic bradycardia may occur.", 
    "50": "One hundred ten patients of both sexes with mild to moderate essential hypertension were studied in this double-blind, multicenter study. In the double-blind portion of this study, which covered weeks 11 to 14, 71 patients were evaluated to determine the effect of Clinoril (sulindac, MSD), piroxicam, and placebo on the hypotensive effect of propranolol. All 110 patients were considered for safety evaluation. Patients treated with propranolol alone were distributed randomly into three groups (Clinoril, piroxicam and placebo) and compared in a 15-week study with four periods (I through IV). Having fulfilled the criteria for hypertension (I) and having been successfully controlled with propranolol alone (II), patients were entered into a double-blind period (III) comparing the three drug treatments during four weeks followed by one week of propranolol alone (IV). During period III, patients treated with piroxicam had significantly greater (p less than 0.05) increases in supine and standing diastolic blood pressure than patients treated with Clinoril. No clinical difference was shown between patients treated with Clinoril and placebo. At the end of period IV patients treated with piroxicam maintained the increase in their diastolic blood pressure, in contrast to Clinoril and placebo where no clinical difference was noted. Significantly more patients treated with piroxicam than Clinoril had a 10 mmHg or greater increase of their supine diastolic blood pressure. These results show that Clinoril does not blunt the antihypertensive effect of propranolol in patients with mild to moderate hypertension in contrast to piroxicam. This is an extension of a report previously published in Advances in Therapy, Vol. 2, No. 4, July/August 1985.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "The influence of a beta-adrenergic blocker on the thermic effect of feeding (TEF) a meal was investigated in 7 healthy male volunteers. Metabolic rate (MR) was measured before and for 180 min after the consumption of 2.0 MJ 'Ensure' (Abbott Laboratories, Queensborough, Kent, UK); there were 14, 33 and 53% of energy from protein, fat and carbohydrate, respectively. On one occasion propranolol (ICI plc, Macclesfield, Ches., UK) was administered intravenously at 0.1 mg/kg body weight at meal feeding. On the second occasion a similar volume of saline was infused. Serial blood samples (10 ml) were collected before and at 30-min intervals for 180 min after meal feeding. Mean (+/- SD) resting MR was 104 (13) and 116 (11) kJ/kg and MR increased by 12.8% and 10.8% after the test meal with and without propranolol, respectively. These differences were not significant. The postprandial changes in serum glucose and triiodothyronine were similar in the two trials. The magnitude of the rise of serum insulin was similar in the two trials, but the pattern was not. beta-Adrenergenic blockade resulted in an early peak in insulin output at 30 min compared with 60 min for the control trial. We conclude that propranolol had no influence on TEF in this study.", 
    "52": "The effects of labetalol on the secretion of prostacyclin and plasma-renin activity (PRA) were evaluated, relative to a control group in 24 patients undergoing hip osteotomy. They were randomly assigned to two groups (G-I and G-II) with 12 patients each. Patients allocated to both groups received standard anaesthesia (thiopentone, pancuronium, fentanyl and nitrous oxide). Patients belonging to Group II were given labetalol at a dose of 0.8 mg kg-1. The stable metabolite of PGI2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was quantified from urine samples by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Cortisol, PRA and aldosterone were determined from blood samples. A significant increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha elimination was observed in G-I. Labetalol administration partially but significantly inhibited this increase. We believe that prostacyclin is involved not through the beta 1 but through the alpha 1 receptors in the secretion of renin.", 
    "53": "We measured red blood cell Na+-K+ pump, Na+-Li+ countertransport and Na+-K+ cotransport activities, together with intraerythrocyte sodium content before and after 3 months therapy with captopril and two other antihypertensive drugs (atenolol and canrenoate potassium) in subjects suffering from essential hypertension. All patients discontinued any previous treatment at least 3 months before the basal evaluation of cell membrane activities. All three drugs significantly lowered blood pressure but only captopril and canrenoate potassium induced significant modifications in red blood cell parameters. After three months of captopril therapy intraerythrocyte Na+ content was significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) without any detectable change in cation transport system activity. After 3 months of canrenoate potassium therapy we also observed a significant decrease in internal Na content (P less than 0.01), together with a significant increase in Na+-K+ pump (P less than 0.02) and Na+-Li+ countertransport (P less than 0.05) activities.", 
    "54": "Aldehyde fixation of hybridoma cells during active production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) resulted in the formation of an insoluble phase because a large number of immunologically active antibody molecules were immobilized on the fixed hybridoma cells. Such MAb preparations specific to large protein molecules and small haptens were used for the development of a homogeneous immunoassay concept.", 
    "55": "In a double blind, cross over study the haemodynamic effects of an i.v. infusion of adrenaline during concomitant administration of atenolol, pindolol, propranolol or placebo were examined in 7 healthy volunteers. During coadministration with placebo, adrenaline caused an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 26 mm Hg and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 20 mm Hg. Heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV) were increased by about 20-30%. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) fell significantly. When the subjects were pretreated with atenolol, the adrenaline increased SBP by 16 mm Hg, the DBP did not change, HR and SV increased by 19 and 30%, and TPR fell. During concomitant administration of the non-selective betablocker pindolol, which has strong intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), adrenaline increased SBP by 11 mm Hg and DBP by 17 mm Hg. This pure pressor response led to a significant reduction in HR and SV and an increase in TPR, probably mediated through the baroreceptors. The haemodynamic response to adrenaline during coadministration of propranolol was very similar to that seen after pindolol. It is concluded that a beta1-selective blocker interferes very little with the haemodynamic response to adrenaline, whereas it is changed to a pure pressor response during coadministration of a non-selective betablockers. ISA did not significantly modify the pressor response.", 
    "56": "ICI 141,292 is a beta-blocker with beta 1-selective partial agonist activity. To study its cardioselectivity in humans, comparable beta-blocking doses of 200 mg ICI 141,292 and 100 mg atenolol were given to 12 patients with stable bronchial asthma. Both drugs significantly reduced the midexpiratory flow rate at 50% of vital capacity, whereas no significant reduction in FEV1 or peak expiratory flow rate were observed. It is concluded that the cardioselectivity of ICI 141,292 did not differ significantly from that of atenolol. Since they both had a measurable effect on respiratory mechanics, they should probably not be prescribed in bronchial asthma, or only with the greatest possible caution.", 
    "57": "In a double-blind, single oral dose, cross-over study, the effects of bufuralol (60 mg) on heart rate, blood pressure, and peripheral vascular responses were compared with those of propranolol (160 mg), pindolol (10 mg), and placebo in a group of 12 healthy volunteers. All three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists reduced exercise tachycardia, but at the doses chosen the effects of bufuralol were less than those of propranolol. Forearm blood flow was reduced by propranolol and pindolol, but not by bufuralol. The antihypertensive and peripheral vascular effects of bufuralol (30-60 mg bd) were also compared with those of propranolol (40-80 mg bd) in a double-blind crossover study in 10 patients with mild hypertension. Propranolol and bufuralol produced comparable reductions in systemic blood pressure over a two-week period, but the decreases in forearm and finger blood flow were greater with propranolol. These studies suggest that bufuralol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with antihypertensive properties, and that it produces less peripheral vasoconstriction than propranolol or pindolol.", 
    "58": "The hypertensive effect of urapidil, a new antihypertensive agent that acts via central and peripheral alpha-adrenoceptors, has been compared with that of metoprolol in 40 patients with mild essential hypertension. Blood pressure was significantly reduced by both drugs, while the heart rate was reduced only after metoprolol. The increases in systolic blood pressure and heart rate caused by three progressive work loads of bicycle exercise were not affected during urapidil, whereas both were reduced by metoprolol. A slight reduction in forced expiratory volume was observed in some patients during treatment with the beta-blocker. There was no case of orthostatic hypotension during urapidil administration, despite its alpha1-blocking action. Side-effects were rare and negligible with both drugs.", 
    "59": "The aim of this investigation was to study central haemodynamics in initially uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with respect to natural history, relation to enzyme estimated infarct size, mortality and effects of metoprolol. A total of 212 patients with AMI but without clinical signs of serious heart failure or hypotension and with a mean delay from onset of pain to study entry of about 7 hours were studied. They were randomised to placebo or metoprolol (15 mg i.v. + 50 mg orally q.i.d.) treatment. Central pressures and cardiac output were evaluated by repeated measurements over 24 hours by means of pulmonary artery catheters. The pharmacokinetics of metoprolol were studied in further 20 patients with AMI. The natural history, as reflected by the placebo group, was observed to be a gradual significant fall in systemic artery pressures, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP; 13.6-10.5 mmHg) and stroke volume, while heart rate increased, leaving cardiac output unchanged. The decrease in PCWP was confined to the group with baseline pressure above the median of 13 mmHg and was of equal magnitude in the group given concomitant medication to that of those who required no such therapy. Significant but weak correlations between the peak serum aspartate aminotransferase level and the baseline PCWP (r = 0.28) and stroke volume (r = 0.22) were found. Non-survivors had a significant baseline depression of cardiac output and stroke volume, while PCWP was increased. However, the overlap with survivors was large. The dosage of metoprolol used resulted in mean plasma levels of about 200 nmol/l, which should induce a rapid and sustained degree of beta-blockade. The patients randomised to placebo or metoprolol were assessed according to initial heart rate. The haemodynamic changes induced by metoprolol were similar but were more pronounced in patients with high heart rate compared to those with low rate. In patients with heart rate greater than 65 beats/min, the metoprolol treated group, in comparison to the placebo group, was characterised by a decrease of 10-20% in systolic artery pressure and heart rate, suggesting a decreased myocardial oxygen consumption. Cardiac index (2.9-2.2 l/min/m2) and stroke volume index (36-32 ml/beat/m2) decreased to a minimum after 30 minutes and gradually rose thereafter. The PCWP increased from 13.7 to 15.4 mmHg, 30 minutes after the injection of metoprolol. This increase was confined to the group with baseline low pressure and the difference compared to the placebo group disappeared after 8 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "60": "The Stockholm Metoprolol Trial is a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled postmyocardial infarction study of 301 patients treated with metoprolol, 100 mg b.i.d., or matching placebo for three years. From this study we have retrospectively evaluated the outcome in patients with a history of treatment for hypertension prior to the index infarction. There were 41 such patients in the placebo group and 35 in the metoprolol group. Blood pressures during follow-up were nearly identical in the two groups. During the three years 11 patients died in the placebo group and 7 in the metoprolol group. Corresponding figures for nonfatal events such as reinfarction, coronary artery bypass surgery, cerebrovascular events and lower limb amputation were 12 vs. 1 (p less than 0.005), 3 vs. 0, 4 vs. 0 and 1 vs. 0, respectively. The numbers of patients with fatal and nonfatal events were 24 vs. 8 (p less than 0.01). In a retrospective subgroup analysis the results must always be interpreted with caution. The present results may, however, imply that postinfarction treatment with metoprolol reduces nonfatal atherosclerotic complications, especially nonfatal reinfarctions, in patients with a history of hypertension.", 
    "61": "The airway and cardiovascular effects of separate single oral doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg of bucindolol were compared to those of placebo in a double-blind trial in 16 patients with mild to moderately severe asthma. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume in one second (FEV1), maximum expiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity (FEF50) and maximum expiratory flow at 75% of expired vital capacity (FEF75) were measured before and at intervals for 4h, when salbutamol (200 micrograms) was inhaled and the measurements repeated 15 min later. There was an interval of at least 4 days between each drug treatment day. Four of the 16 patients developed clinically significant bronchoconstriction with 50 mg (3) or 100 mg (1) of bucindolol and were withdrawn from the study. The remaining patients showed impaired bronchodilator response to salbutamol for each bucindolol dose as compared to placebo. No significant BP or HR effects were measured. Two patients withdrew because of circumstances unrelated to bucindolol induced bronchoconstriction. The development of bucindolol induced bronchoconstriction in this group of mild to moderate asthmatics was not predicted by the level of baseline pulmonary function, or the level of histamine responsiveness. However, there was a weak relationship between bucindolol induced bronchoconstriction and salbutamol induced bronchodilation. There are no definitive asthmatic characteristic to predict the likelihood of significant bucindolol induced bronchoconstriction in this asthmatic population.", 
    "62": "Eight hundred and forty-nine patients with confirmed myocardial infarction were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS, Solu-Medrol Sterile Powder, The Upjohn Company) for reduction of morbidity and mortality following an acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular failure. Two study groups were prospectively defined based on time from onset of chest pain to administration of investigational therapy. Study Group 1 received investigational therapy before 6 hours had elapsed while Study Group 2 was treated 6 to 12 hours from the onset of chest pain. Both study groups were randomized to receive either a 30 mg/kg i.v. dose of MPSS (3 g maximum) or a matching placebo at the time of study admission, to be followed by an identical dose three hours later. Definitive electrocardiograms were available for 814 patients at admission. The mortality rates at 28 days and 6 months for the anterior transmural and nontransmural infarctions did not differ significantly with regard to time to treatment or investigational therapy. For the inferior/posterior transmural infarctions, however, there was a 92% relative reduction in mortality at 28 days in the MPSS treatment arm of Study Group 2 (1/83 [1.2%] for patients given MPSS versus 15/97 [15.5%] for those given placebo; p less than 0.001). This significant difference persisted at the 6 month follow-up evaluation (3/82 [3.6%] for patients on MPSS versus 17/96 [16.6%] for those on placebo, P less than 0.01). Site-specific efficacy has been reported for the anterior infarction groups of the major beta-blocker trials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Ethnic differences in responsiveness to certain antihypertensive agents have been demonstrated between blacks and whites. Whites exhibit a greater average fall in blood pressure following beta adrenergic blocking drugs and converting enzyme inhibitors than do blacks. On the other hand, the blood pressure of blacks is more responsive to diuretics. While the causes for these ethnic differences are unknown several explanations have been offered. The plasma renin activity of whites tends to be higher than that of blacks. More whites have high or normal plasma renin activity as opposed to blacks who have mostly low renin hypertension. ACE inhibitors and beta blockers may be more effective in whites because these drugs reduce the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Blacks, on the other hand, are more responsive to diuretics possibly because they have more of a volume dependent hypertension and tend to retain sodium longer than whites.", 
    "64": "There are speculations that beta-adrenergic blocking agents are useful in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Clinically, propranolol, an agent of this group, has been investigated in the treatment of various clinical disorders including schizophrenia, other psychoses, anxiety disorders, and stress reactions. This paper critically evaluates its efficacy in these disorders and provides a useful clinical perspective. In addition, propranolol produces a number of psychiatric side effects which are due to its central action or due to the peripheral receptor blockade. In addition, idiosyncratic reactions as well as withdrawal effects have also been reported to produce psychiatric side effects. It is important that the physician who wishes to use this drug know the existing knowledge of its usefulness in the treatment of psychiatric disorders as well as its psychiatric side effects.", 
    "65": "It has been found that smoking stimulates the production of hepatic microsomal enzymes which greatly affect drug metabolism in the human body. Many compounds contained in tobacco smoke enhance the activity of this enzyme system; polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons exhibit the most pronounced action. Diabetics who smoke require on the average 15 - 20% more insulin; and up to 30% more in heavy smokers. This may be due to increased catecholamine concentration during smoking. Patients who smoke and take propanolol have significantly higher metabolic clearance of the compound and absorb higher propanolol doses than non-smokers. Theophylline was found to be metabolized more rapidly in smokers; use of normal, effective theophylline doses doses does not yield the required results. The free fraction of lignocaine in the serum of smokers is much lower than in nonsmokers. The 19% increase in fixation of lignocaine with plasma proteins is due to higher concentration of alpha1-glycoprotein. In smokers to whom phenylbutazone was administered, the period of semiduration of the drug was much shorter and clearance of this compound was considerably higher. In women taking oral contraceptives who also smoke, the circulatory mass of erythrocytes increases, leading to higher concentration of hemoglobin, hematocrit and number and volume of erythrocytes in peripheral blood. This raise blood viscosity and impairs its flow through vessels, especially those with a small cross section. The ability of erythrocytes to deform is also reduced.", 
    "66": "We evaluated the effects of defibrotide (D), a natural profibrinolytic and antithrombotic agent with endogenous PGI2-stimulating properties, on acute lethal and nonlethal myocardial ischemia (L-AMI and NL-AMI) in the cat. The coronary artery was occluded at 12-14 mm from its origin. In L-AMI, 12 of 15 control cats developed ventricular fibrillation and died; D (32 mg kg-1, bolus intravenously plus infusion) provided total protection against death and showed protective effects on plasma and myocardial creatine phosphokinase (CPK), hemodynamics and ECG. In NL-AMI, pretreatment of cats with D at the same dosage (intravenous infusion) reduced AMI-ST segment increases and AMI changes in hemodynamics. AMI-induced changes in lactate adenosine triphosphate and CPK in ischemic tissues were prevented by D. The beneficial effects of D in NL-AMI could be partly attributed to its stimulatory effect on vascular PGI2 release; the mechanism of the impressive protection by D observed in L-AMI has still to be elucidated.", 
    "67": "The efficacy of bromocriptine in the treatment of hypertension was assessed in a double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study preceded by a dose titration phase. A diuretic and/or a beta-blocker were administered concomitantly in constant dosage to 11 of the 20 patients who received bromocriptine. A wide range of doses of bromocriptine was tolerated. Side-effects of vomiting and postural hypertension did not occur, possibly due to the gradual increase in the administered doses. Plasma prolactin was not raised in this population of hypertensives. In the dose titration phase (n = 20), a small fall in diastolic but not in systolic blood pressure occurred with bromocriptine, but only with the patient standing and after exercise. In the double-blind phase (n = 9), there was no significant difference in blood pressure between the bromocriptine and placebo treatments. It is concluded that bromocriptine was not effective in lowering blood pressure in the present patients with essential hypertension."
