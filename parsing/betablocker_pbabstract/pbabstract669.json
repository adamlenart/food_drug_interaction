    "0": "The effect of short-term beta blockade with the nonselective antagonist propranolol and with the cardioselective antagonist metoprolol on arterial blood pressure, heart rate, serum renin activity, plasma thromboxane (Tx) B2 (the stable metabolite of TxA2). and plasma and urinary prostaglandin (PG) E2 and F2 alpha levels were examined in 11 normal subjects. After propranolol (160 mg by mouth), supine and standing mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell from 82 +/- 2 and 88 +/- 4 mm Hg to 71 +/- 3 (P less than 0.001) and 78 +/- 3 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) within 13 hr. MAP fell from 78 +/- 2 and 88 +/- 3 mm Hg to 72 +/- 2 (P less than 0.025) and 80 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) after metoprolol (200 mg by mouth). These blood pressure effects were associated with beta blockade; both drugs induced reduction in heart rate and serum renin activity and the reductions were of the same order. Propranolol and metoprolol also reduced plasma TxB2 levels by 33% (P less than 0.005) and 46% (P less than 0.05), but plasma and urinary PGE2 and PGF2 alpha levels were not changed by either drug. These findings suggest that changes in PGE2 or PGF2 alpha levels are unlikely to contribute to the short-term hypotensive effects of propranolol or metoprolol in normal subjects. Alterations in the synthesis or metabolism of the potent vasoconstrictor and proaggregatory drug TxA2, however, may be involved in the hypotensive, cardioprotective, and antiplatelet effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists.", 
    "1": "1 Upright tilting in normal volunteers caused increases in plasma active and total renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone; a slight but significant fall in inactive renin accompanied these changes. 2 The alterations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on tilting took up to 1 h upright to become fully established. 3 Large intravenous doses of propranolol or metoprolol attenuated, without abolishing, the rises in active renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone; the attenuation was most evident soon after tilting and was largely overcome by 1 h upright. Inactive renin did not fall significantly after beta-adrenoceptor blockade. 4 Intravenous frusemide caused immediate rises in plasma active, total and inactive renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone, which then declined over 2 h despite increasing cumulative sodium losses. 5 Intravenous propranolol or metoprolol attenuated, without abolishing, these early increases in the components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system after frusemide. 6 Prior oral metoprolol or propranolol, while significantly slowing the heart, did not limit the early rise in plasma angiotensin II following intravenous frusemide. 7 Thus in contrast to previous workers, we did not find that propranolol eliminated the response of the renin-angiotensin system to upright tilting; in part this difference appeared to be due to the longer tilt we employed. 8 Also in contrast to earlier work, we found attenuation by both intravenous propranolol and metoprolol of the immediate rise in renin after intravenous frusemide.", 
    "2": "Human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase and the plasma cholinesterase variants are not only inhibited by propranolol but have been found to show stereospecificity for its isomers. The erythrocyte enzyme has a greater affinity for the L-isomer than either the racemate or the D-isomer. In contrast the plasma cholinesterases have greater specificity for the D-isomer than the other isomer or racemate. The usual enzyme shows greater stereospecificity than the atypical enzyme and these findings present additional evidence that these enzyme variants differ in structure at the catalytic active site. Neither Na+ + K+ -ATPase nor Mg2+-ATPase show stereo-specificity for the isomers of propranolol although both enzymes are inhibited by the drug. The action of the drug on the four enzymes in blood samples obtained from patients having Huntington's disease was found to be identical to those observed on the enzymes in blood samples from healthy controls.", 
    "3": "Destruction of noradrenergic neurons by 6-hydroxydopamine or chronic blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol increased the density of beta 1-adrenergic receptors two-fold in rat cerebellum but had no effect on the density of beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The results suggest that even through beta 1 receptors comprise only 5-10% of the total number of Beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebellum they are the receptors specifically innervated by noradrenergic neurons and they may thus be the physiologically important receptors.", 
    "4": "This study was made to investigate the mechanisms of the changes in serum potassium during a period of insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The following experiments were performed: I) A relationship was observed between the amount of insulin dosage and the levels of serum potassium, blood sugar, and plasma cyclic AMP or plasma cyclic GMP in normal controls and rats. In humans, regular insulin (0.025 approximately 0.15 U/kg) was injected intravenously, and blood samples drawn at intervals were used for estimation. Regular insulin (0.1 approximately 1.0 U/kg) was injected into Wistar strain male rats and blood was drawn at intervals. II) A relationship was observed between those items mentioned above in patients with thyroid diseases or diabetes mellitus. They were injected with regular insulin (0.1 U/kg). III) An effect of spironolactone was observed on the levels of the above mentioned items. Regular insulin (0.075 U/kg) was injected into normal controls after the ingestion of spironolactone. IV) An effect of non-selective beta-blocker was observed on the levels of the above mentioned items. Regular insulin (0.1 U/kg) was injected into normal controls and patients with hyperthyroidism after the ingestion of 20 mg of propranolol. The results obtained were as follows: 1) There was a significant logarithmic dose-response relationship between insulin dose and maximum per cent decrease in serum potassium, and maximum per cent increase in plasma cyclic AMP. (p less than 0.02 approximately 0.01) 2) A significant positive correlation was observed between the maximum per cent decrease in serum potassium and the maximum per cent increase in plasma cyclic AMP during the period of insulin-induced hypoglycemia. (p less than 0.001) 3) The changes in serum potassium and plasma cyclic AMP were significantly greater in patients with hyperthyroidism who were possibly in a hyperdynamic beta-adrenergic circulatory state, and these changes were smaller in patients with hypothyroidism than in the normal controls. When their thyroid functions were normalized by the treatment, the changes in serum potassium and plasma cyclic AMP behaved in the same manner as those in the normal controls. 4) Spironolactone had no effect on any change observed in this study. 5) Neither per cent decrease of serum potassium nor per cent increase of cyclic AMP were influenced by propranolol at 15 minutes, but they decreased 30 minutes after the insulin injection. These results may indicate that a decrease of serum potassium levels during the period of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in both the early and late phases is caused by different mechanisms. The change in serum potassium was accompanied by an increase of plasma cyclic AMP, and furthermore this change was inhibited by beta-blocker. It was suggested that beta-adrenoreceptor play a role in a decrease of serum potassium, especially 30 minutes after a injection of insulin.", 
    "5": "Specific [125I] hydroxybenzylpindolol binding (33 fmol/mg protein) was detected in tracheal tissues from middle aged (417 g) and old (757 g) guinea pigs but binding was not measurable in tracheal tissues from young (118 g) animals. Similarly, receptor density increased in bronchial and parenchymal tissues during development but receptor affinity did not change. For any age, the receptor densities were parenchyma greater than bronchi greater than trachea (20/7/1); receptor affinities were identical. The potency of l-isoproterenol in relaxing bronchial muscle was reduced during development. In vivo, salbutamol reduced airway reactivity to histamine and was most potent in animals exhibiting airway hyperreactivity. In addition, l-propranolol sensitized airway muscle to the bronchoconstrictor effects of histamine in young guinea pigs; in old guinea pigs of the same airway reactivity, l-propranolol did not affect the induced bronchoconstriction. Our data suggest that there is a reduced sensitivity of airway muscle to catecholamines during development which may be due, in part, to increased density of beta-adrenoceptors which are not involved in eliciting the physiological response.", 
    "6": "Anaesthetized guinea-pigs were intoxicated with an intravenous infusion of ouabain. This infusion induced a marked pressor response which was reduced in bilaterally adrenalectomized or pithed animals. Ouabain produced initial bradyarrhythmias in 60% of guinea-pigs. Bilateral vagotomy or pretreatment with atropine abolished the bradyarrhythmias and sensitized the animals to the arrhythmic effects of ouabain. Pithing or beta-adrenoceptor blockade reduced the potency of ouabain for producing arrhythmias, but bilateral adrenalectomy did not give protection. Preferential alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation with clonidine (10-300 micrograms . kg-1 i.v.) also reduced the arrhythmogenic effects of ouabain, whereas no protection was found with St 91, a clonidine related compound which does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The effect of clonidine was antagonized by piperoxan. Preferential alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade with piperoxan (6 mg . kg-1 i.v.) did not change the pressor response to ouabain, but sensitized the animals to the arrhythmogenic effects of ouabain. In contrast, the preferential alpha 1-antagonistic agent AR-C 239 (0.3 mg . kg-1 i.v.) abolished the pressor response to ouabain and in addition increased the dose of ouabain required to produced ventricular premature beats and ventricular fibrillation. These experiments indicate: (i) that ouabain produces in guinea-pigs a pressor response which seems to be due to catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla probably by an action on the central nervous system; (ii) that the ventricular arrhythmias induced by ouabain are due in part to stimulation of the central nervous system leading to an increase in beta-adrenoceptor activity; (iii) that central alpha-adrenoceptors appear to be involved in the arrhythmogenic effects of ouabain, as clonidine reduced these effects. On the other hand piperoxan, a preferential alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist did not change the pressor response to ouabain and increased the arrhythmogenic effects whereas AR-C 239 had opposite effects.", 
    "7": "The addition of propranolol to monolayers of chick embryo liver cells caused a rapid increase in cellular heme, followed by an equally rapid decrease. Subsequently the concentration of heme rose at a relatively slower rate. About 10 hr after addition of propranolol to the medium a plateau level was reached at +/- 35% above control values. Changes in the activity of delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) were negatively correlated with those of cellular heme. Cycloheximide prevented the above phenomenon. ALAS activity was not clearly correlated with the rapid, partial inhibition of protein synthesis, caused by propranolol. These observations are related to the beneficial influence of administration of hemin or of propranolol to patients with acute attacks of hepatic porphyria.", 
    "8": "Studies on the relationship between thyroid hormone and the beta-adrenergic catecholamines have been carried out in the turkey erythrocyte. Conditions of thyroid hormone excess and deficiency were examined with respect to their effects on the beta receptor itself, as well as to their effects on associated biochemical and physiological indices of beta receptor function, including agonist stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, cellular cyclic AMP generation, and catecholamine-induced stimulation of potassium ion influx. Erythrocytes obtained from hypothyroid turkeys showed a marked (approximately 50%) reduction in beta receptor number without any change in receptor affinity for agonists or antagonists. Catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity and cellular cyclic AMP levels were similarly reduced. The sensitivity of these cells to agonist-stimulated potassium influx was significantly decreased, but maximal agonist-stimulated transport rate was unchanged. Analysis of the quantitative relationship between beta receptor number, agonist concentration, and level of catecholamine-stimulated potassium influx indicates that, at any given absolute level of receptor occupancy, the level of agonist-stimulated potassium influx is identical in hypothyroid and normal erythrocytes, and that the diminished physiological sensitivity of the hypothyroid cell is attributable in its entirety to a reduction in beta receptor number per se. The results obtained in the hyperthyroid turkey erythrocyte were strikingly different. Here, beta receptor number, binding affinity for agonists and antagonists, catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity, and maximal cyclic AMP levels were all unchanged. In contrast, maximal agonist-stimulated potassium ion transport was markedly reduced, while the concentration of isoproterenol required for half-maximal stimulation was only slightly increased. Analysis of the relationship between beta receptor number, agonist concentration, and catecholamine-stimulated potassium influx rate indicates that, at all absolute levels of beta receptor occupancy, the stimulation of monovalent cation influx is markedly blunted in the hyperthyroid cell. In contrast to the findings in the hypothyroid cell, where decreased physiologic sensitivity to catecholamines is directly attributable to a reduction in beta receptor number, the primary abnormality responsible for diminished catecholamine responsiveness in the hyperthyroid cell would appear to be located at a point \"distal\" to the beta receptor itself.", 
    "9": "We have studied the effect of a new beta-adrenergic blocker, carteolol, on platelet function, blood coagulation and viscosity in 10 healthy male volunteers. Following carteolol (5 mg orally) we were able to demonstrate significant inhibition of platelet aggregation to ADP (p less than 0.05) and adrenaline (p less than 0.01) after 5 hours, but not at 2 or 24 hours. This maximum inhibition of platelet aggregation corresponded to peak plasma concentrations of carteolol measured. The platelet release reaction, as measured by plasma levels of the platelet specific protein beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) was unaltered and there was no significant effect on a panel of coagulation tests or on blood viscosity.", 
    "10": "The radioactive beta-adrenergic antagonist [3H] dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binds to particulate preparations of human myometrium in a manner compatible with binding to the beta-adrenergic receptor. The binding of DHA is rapid (attaining equilibrium in 12 minutes), readily reversible (half time = 16 minutes), high affinity (KD = 0.50 nM), low capacity (Bmax = 70 fmoles/mg of protein), and stereoselective ([-]-propranolol is 100 times as potent as [+]-ipropranolol in inhibiting DHA binding). Adrenergic agonists competed for DHA binding sites in a manner compatible with beta-adrenergic interactions and mirrored beta 2 pharmacologic potencies: isoproterenol greater than epinephrine much greater than norepinephrine. Studies in which zinterol, a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, competed for DHA binding sites in human myometrial particulate indicated that at least 87% of the beta-adrenergic receptors present are beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Binding of DHA to human myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors provides a tool which may be used in the examination of gonadal hormonal modification of adrenergic response in human uterus as well as in the analysis of beta-adrenergic agents as potentially useful tocolytic agents.", 
    "11": "A beta-blocker (pindolol) and a diuretic (clopamide) were given in different dosages, singly and in two different combinations, to 71 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The trial design was such that patients took both drugs singly and in combination, and in different doses, according to a set plan. The best regimen for each patient was determined by taking into account not only blood pressure but also resting heart-rate, body-weight, serum potassium, and serum urate. For 19 patients (27%) monotherapy was best--pindolol for 16 and clopamide for 3. For the remaining patients, a combination of pindolol 10 mg and clopamide 5 mg was best for 39, and in 35 of these one tablet daily was sufficient. All patients reached the preset target blood-pressure. The differences in proportions responding best to the following pairs of regimens compared--monotherapy vs combination, and combination of clopamide 5 mg and pindolol 5 mg vs combination of clopamide 5 mg and pindolol 10 mg--were significant (2p less than 0.01). The process by which the best treatment is chosen according to this study design resembles much more closely that followed in general medical practice, than does the process in the conventional hypertension trial, in which only average effects are reported and compared.", 
    "12": "The hormonal regulation of glycogen synthase has been studied with isolated perfused hearts that were depleted of 85% of their endogenous glycogen. Glycogen depletion alone promoted a 3-fold activation of glycogen synthase and magnified by 3-fold the response to insulin. Glycogen depletion also facilitated the detection of epinephrine-promoted glycogen synthase inactivation. Hormonal effects on glycogen synthase have been correlated with changes in phosphorylase, phosphorylase kinase, and tissue cAMP levels. Insulin activation of glycogen synthase was observed within 90 s of hormone addition and was maximal by 4 min. A half-maximum effect was obtained at an insulin concentration of 100 microunits/ml. Insulin-dependent activation is reversed by beta-adrenergic agonists, alpha-adrenergic agonists, and glucagon. Each promote the same degree of inactivation and the maximum extent of inactivation produced by each is independent of whether or not the tissue has been stimulated with insulin. beta-Adrenergic agonists and glucagon act via cAMP, alpha-agonists most likely act via intracellular Ca2+ translocation, and insulin action would appear to be independent of either cAMP or Ca2+. The action of epinephrine on cardiac glycogen synthase is mediated by interaction with both alpha- and beta-receptors. As indicated by dose-response curves, receptor occupancy of each occurs to an almost equal extent at suboptimal epinephrine concentrations. Regulation of cardiac glycogen synthase by epinephrine thus is mediated by two second messenger systems which converge to produce the end physiological response.", 
    "13": "Histamine produced a dose-dependent relaxation of uterine strips obtained from the estrogen-primed rat uterus. The responses to histamine were blocked competitively by metiamide (10(-8)-10(-8) M), a specific H2-receptor antagonist. Propranolol, a selective beta-receptor blocker also produced competitive antagonism of the responses to histamine in the same dose range (10(-8)-10(-6) M). The pA2 value obtained for metiamide (8.9) was not significantly different from that obtained for propranolol (8.6). Nialamide (2.2 X 10(-6) M), the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and cocaine (4.3 X 10(-6) M), the selective noradrenaline uptake blocker, potentiated the responses to histamine. However bretylium (2.4 X 10(-5) M), and adrenergic neuron blocker inhibited the responses to histamine. The combined effect of tyramine and histamine was found to be additive. Our data suggest that the histamine-induced relaxation of rat uterus may be produced through the stimulation of presynaptic H2-receptors which causes the release of noradrenaline. The released noradrenaline acts on the postsynaptic beta-receptors and produces relaxation of the rat uterus.", 
    "14": "The therapeutic control of blood pressure and heart rate throughout the 24 hour period, was assessed in ten hypertensive patients, following the administration of placebo, conventional metoprolol 100 mg twelve hourly, and the slow release formulations of metoprolol (metoprolol S.A.) and oxprenolol (oxprenolol S.R.), given once daily. Good blood pressure control at rest was observed at two hours post dose following the three drug regimes. Analysis of blood pressure and heart rate values in response to exercise showed no difference between conventional and metoprolol S.A. at either two hours or 12/24 hours post dose. However, at 24 hours, metoprolol S.A. gave better clinical control of the systolic blood pressure and heart rate than oxprenolol S.R. with metoprolol inhibiting exercise induced tachycardia by 29% at 2 hours and 20% at 24 hours (oxprenolol 24% and 11% respectively). In this study, metoprolol S.A. was effective in the control of hypertension throughout the 24 hours period, both at rest and during exercise. The control at 24 hours by oxprenolol S.R. was poor and suggests that the present formulation should be reconsidered.", 
    "15": "On the basis of 47 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma, the administration of 0.1% timolol-maleate eye-drops was investigated in the form of a controlled long-term study over a period of 56 weeks. It was found that in a remarkable proportion of chronic glaucoma cases, this low concentration had an adequate, long-term effect, reducing IOP by 24-27%. The results obtained give sufficient grounds for the assumption that in the initial stages of glaucoma, the 0.1% solution is just as effective as solutions of a higher concentration, provided that a satisfactory degree of responsiveness to timolol-maleate is present from the outset. The local and systemic side-effects are relatively slight and therefore also fewer than with higher concentrations. Since in over 50% of patients with chronic glaucoma, 0.1% timolol-maleate eye-drops reduce IOP adequately over a considerable period of time, the 0.1% solution is to be recommended at all events for the initial treatment of glaucoma patients.", 
    "16": "The effect of dantrolene sodium on transmembrane potential and contractile force was examined in electrically driven right ventricular papillary muscles of guinea-pigs. Dantrolene sodium (2 x 10(-4) M) shortened the action potential and increased overshoot and the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax), without changing the resting potential. Contractile force was increased by the drug. The dantrolene sodium-induced changes could be antagonized with pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker. Dantrolene sodium exerted a negative inotropic effect in papillary muscles of guinea-pigs pretreated with reserpine. The drug increased the amplitude and Vmax of slow action potentials. Pindolol was able to abolish this action. The results suggest that the positive inotropic effect of dantrolene sodium may be due to catecholamine release, whereas the drug has a negative inotropic effect by itself.", 
    "17": "\"Synaptic\" ribbon (SR) populations in the rat pineal gland were analyzed morphometrically at various ages from birth to early adulthood. The rats were born and raised in continuous light or continuous darkness. SR numbers were high irrespective of the presence or absence of light during the early neonatal period. However, SR numbers decreased substantially during the second neonatal week of continuous light, remaining low at subsequent ages, including early adulthood. In contrast, SR numbers apparently remained elevated during continuous darkness at various ages from the early neonatal period to early adulthood. Stimulation of pineal adrenergic receptors with L-isoproterenol during continuous light resulted in an acute, reversible increase in SR numbers; blockade of these receptors with L-propranolol during continuous darkness resulted in an acute decrease in SR numbers. These results indicate that light-mediated changes in SR populations were 1) age related and 2) related to some component of the pineal beta-adrenergic receptor mechanism. A hypothesis that SR formation may be related to beta-adrenergic receptor-associated membrane turnover is presented.", 
    "18": "The effects of propranolol on the turnover of thyroxine (T4), 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), and 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) were determined by a noncompartmental analysis in seven normal men. Fourteen normal subjects were treated with 0.2 mg T4 daily, and half of this group (seven) received in addition 80 mg propranolol daily. Fifteen days of propranolol treatment did not alter serum T4 concentration or T4 turnover. However, it lowered serum T3 concentration from 173 to 102 ng/dl (P = 0.001); T3 clearance was unchanged. Propranolol treatment elevated serum rT3 concentration from 54 to 69 ng/dl (P = 0.05); rT3 metabolic clearance rate fell from 105 to 90 liters/day but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The rT3 disposal rate was unchanged by propranolol. The fractional T4 disposal which was degraded via the deiodinative pathways was reduced from 82.0 per cent in the control subjects to 65.5 per cent in the propranolol treated subjects. Therefore, propranolol appears to be a potent inhibitor of 5'-deiodination. The interpretation of serum T3 measurements in patients treated with propranolol requires caution.", 
    "19": "A clinical comparison of the sustained release form of metoprolol, consisting of a 200 mg metoprolol durule, with 100 mg conventional metoprolol twice daily, has been carried out to assess the therapeutic control of ten patients with stable angina pectoris. Objective measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG recordings were assessed during exercise on a bicycle ergometer. Ten patients completed the 8-week double-blind study. There were similar changes in heart rate and blood pressure at rest and during exercise, both at 2 h and at 12 and 24 h postdose. Although similar exercise tolerance was achieved on both regimes, there was significantly less ST-segment depression at 24 h post durule, in comparison with the 12 h post conventional metoprolol reading, suggesting that metoprolol durules produce a more effective reduction in the degree of myocardial ischemia.", 
    "20": "We studied the effect of placing serum within a segment of trachea on secretion into its lumen in the cat. A segment of cervical trachea was isolated from the rest of the airway in situ. Secretions were radiolabeled biosynthetically by the administration of two radiolabeled precursors: [35S]sodium sulphate and [3H]glucose. Autologous serum placed in the segment at a dilution of 1 in 8 increased the output of radiolabeled macromolecules: [35S] by 80% and [3H] by 159% (p less than 0.001). At a dilution of 1 in 24, serum still increased the output of both isotopes. At dilutions of 1 in 48 and 1 in 80 the increases were significant for [35S] but not for [3H]. Heating the serum to 90 degrees C diminished its effects. Fractionating the serum by dialysis and gel filtration showed that the components of molecular weight less than about 13,000 daltons had no effect on secretion, whereas three higher molecular weight fractions all increased secretion. Two alien proteins (horseradish peroxidase and bovine serum albumin) stimulated secretion but a large molecular weight carbohydrate (carboxymethyl cellulose) did not. Atropine and propranolol, at doses that greatly reduced the effect of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve activity, did not diminish the effects of serum, which therefore appeared to be independent of nerve activity. Gel filtration of the secretions elicited by serum showed that the predominant component was excluded even by Sepharose CL-2B and thus had a high molecular weight. We conclude that there are several components of serum that promote the secretion of mucus glycoproteins into the cat trachea. The relevance of these findings to diseases of human airways is considered.", 
    "21": "First-pass lung uptake of propranolol was studied in 10 patients with normal lungs, 8 patients with severe pulmonary emphysema, and 1 patient with primary pulmonary hypertension. Propranolol uptake was measured by comparing the ratio of [14C]propranolol (0.5 mg) to indocyanine green (5 mg) injected into the right atrium with the ratio of their concentrations in arterial blood collected over the duration of the first-pass dye outflow curve. Mean uptake was 69 +/- 4% (n = 18) in patients with normal lungs; 55 +/- 7% (n = 13) in patients with emphysema (p less than 0.001), and 51% in the patient with primary pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac index in the normal group (2.78 +/- 0.48 L/min/M2, n = 16) was not significantly different from the group with emphysema (2.90 +/- 0.48, n = 12). There was no correlation between lung uptake and conventional lung function indexes in patients with emphysema. We conclude that propranolol uptake is reduced when the pulmonary vascular bed is damaged. This may have pharmacologic consequences, and it is possible that other pharmacokinetic functions of the lung may similarly be impaired in pulmonary disease. The method is relatively simple, and may be suitable for assessing pulmonary endothelial function in patients with lung disease.", 
    "22": "The smooth musculature of the Fallopian tube is important for normal ovum transport, fertilization and implantation. Little is known about the factors controlling the motor activity of the isthmic sphincter. Studies were performed on smooth muscle preparations from the human tube in vitro. Electrical field stimulation of the nerves in the isthmic region reduced the motor activity, particularly in the circular muscle. The response was unaffected by adrenergic and cholinergic antagonists, but blocked by tetrodotoxin, suggesting a neural involvement. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) was considered a likely candidate for the neural mediation of this response in view of the high density of VIP-containing nerve fibres in this region, and in view of the fact that exogenous VIP causes a marked reduction of the tubal motor activity. To test whether VIP might be the endogenous mediator of this effect, nerve stimulation was carried out in the presence of large amounts of exogenous VIP in order to occupy all VIP receptors; the motor inhibitory action of VIP was counteracted by vasopressin. Under these conditions, nerve stimulation failed to reduce isthmic motor activity. This was not due to vasopressin since reduction occurred in the presence of this peptide alone. The results suggest that VIP is responsible for the neurogenic inhibition of motor activity in the isthmus region of the human Fallopian tube.", 
    "23": "Tetanus toxicity was induced in dogs by injecting the toxin subcutaneously in the groin. On developing generalised toxic symptoms, these dogs were characterised by signs of increased sympathetic discharge to the cardiovascular system as evidenced by high basal values of blood pressure, heart rate and LV dP/dt max. Mild to moderate hypoxia induced by ventilation with 10% O2 in N2 had no appreciable effect on the cardiovascular variables. However, moderate to severe hypoxia induced by ventilation with 7% O2 in N2 further increased the sympathetic discharge to the heart and blood vessels resulting in increases in heart rate, LV dP/dt max and blood pressure. These responses were abolished by adrenergic blockers. The responses in the tetanus dogs were identical to those seen in dogs without tetanus toxicity. Atropine or moderate lactic acidaemia did not alter the responses to hypoxia. Beta-adrenergic blockers appear to be useful drugs in the control of tetanus patients who show evidence of increased sympathetic activity or who develop hypoxaemia.", 
    "24": "The long-term electrocardiographic effects of sotalol, a beta blocker tha prolongs the cardiac repolarization time in animals, were investigated in ten hypertensive patients and compared to ten matched hypertensive patients treated with diuretics. An electrocardiogram was recorded before and during an exercise test on a bicycle. Heart rate was lower at rest and throughout exercise in the sotalol-treated patients. The PR and QT intervals of the ECG were significantly longer at rest and after exercise in the sotalol group, whereas QRS widths were similar in both groups. The QTC interval in the sotalol group was 0.41 +/- 0.02 s and 0.47 +/- 0.01 s, at rest and after exercise, respectively, which was not significantly different from 0.42 +/- 0.01 s and 0.43 +/- 0.02 s, respectively, in the diuretic group. These findings were discussed in relation to observations made with other beta blockers.", 
    "25": "1 In a placebo-controlled study, the respective anti-hypertensive effects of hydrochlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide plus the beta-adrenoceptor blocker acebutolol were assessed in 18 patients with moderately severe essential hypertension. 2 Hydrochlorothiazide 100 mg daily decreased the mean supine blood pressures from 163/107 mmHg to 150/103 mmHg. Addition of acebutolol in a single-blind fashion in doses up to 800 mg daily reduced mean supine pressure to 137/95 mmHg. Further increases in acebutolol dosage to a maximum of 2000 mg daily in 13 patients whose hypertension was not well controlled on lower doses resulted in a mean supine blood pressure of 132/92 mmHg.", 
    "26": "1. Previous studied have shown that non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade attenuates the blood glucose recovery rate after hypoglycaemia in type I diabetes. Apart from possible effects on hepatic glycogenolysis propranolol also inhibits the release of the important gluconeogenic substrates lactate and glycerol. 2. To determine whether the effect of non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade on glucose recovery could be associated with diminished availability of gluconeogenic substrates, lactate and glycerol were infused during hypoglycaemia in four insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Comparisons were made of the blood glucose recovery on placebo, propranolol and propranolol combined with the infusion. 3. The blood glucose recovery rate after hypoglycaemia was less on propranolol than with placebo but was significantly improved and not different from placebo when propranolol treatment was combined with lactate and glycerol infusions. Thus, at least for type I diabetic patients, in whom gluconeogenesis is proportionally greater than in healthy subjects, non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade attenuates the glucose recovery rate from hypoglycaemia mainly by reducing the availability of gluconeogenic substrates.", 
    "27": "A new alpha- and beta-blocking agent, labetalol, was used to treat 50 hypertensive patients, 34 of them with refractory hypertension. A significant reduction in hypertension was achieved with relatively few adverse reactions. The combination of alpha and beta blockers in labetalol with their mutually opposing characteristics offers an interesting and promising approach to the control of hypertension.", 
    "28": "We used a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the effect of acetazolamide alone and timolol maleate alone and of the two in combination on the rate of aqueous humor flow in 21 normal subjects. The rate of aqueous flow was measured by fluorophotometry over an eight-hour period. Timolol decreased the flow by 33%, acetazolamide by 27%, and the drug combination by 44%, compared to the placebo treated eye (P less than .01). Timolol produced a 26% decrease in intraocular pressure. Timolol decreased the intraocular pressure in the fellow eye by 16%, acetazolamide by 21%, and the two drugs together by 35% (P less than .01). Neither drug significantly affected the anterior chamber volume, the endothelium's permeability, or the estimated endothelial pump rate.", 
    "29": "The interrelationships of glucagon and insulin with the sympathetic system on glucose turnover during exercise were examined in sheep. Six sheep were run for 45 min on a treadmill with and without alpha- and/or beta-adrenergic blockade. The exercise-induced increase in glucose appearance, as assessed by infusion of [2-3H]glucose, was reduced during the first 25 min of exercise by phentolamine administration. The metabolic clearance rate of glucose also was greater during exercise with phentolamine treatment than without. Phentolamine was associated with a rise in insulin concentrations and appeared to delay the exercise-induced rise in glucagon. Propranolol administration had no effect on glucose turnover and plasma glucagon and insulin. Nor did it have any effect on the changes in glucose, insulin, or glucagon induced by phentolamine administration. These observations are consistent with the alpha-adrenergic mediation of the sympathetic influences on insulin and glucagon secretion, which may account in part for the glucose adaptations to exercise in sheep. However, direct affects of circulating catecholamines on and increased stimulation of sympathetic innervation to the liver cannot be ruled out.", 
    "30": "In a double-blind cross-over clinical trial, flutonidin (2-4 mg daily) was compared with timolol (20-40 mg daily) in the treatment of mildly or moderately hypertensive patients who concomitantly received fixed diuretic treatment. Each drug was administered for 1 month, with an interval of 2 weeks between the two monthly periods. During administration of flutonidin, blood pressure initially fell but returned to baseline values at the end of treatment. Heart rate was not affected by the drug. Timolol significantly reduced both blood pressure and heart rate. Its effect becomes evident during the 1st week and increases throughout the treatment period. Side effects were more frequent during flutonidin administration than during timolol administration. No significant modifications of the laboratory findings were observed during either flutonidin or timolol treatment.", 
    "31": "A double-blind study of pindolol eye drops 0.5% was carried out on 24 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. Pressures were taken once weekly during three 3-week periods. In one of the periods placebo was given in both eyes, during another pindolol was given in one eye, and during another it was given in the other eye. A drop in pressure averaging 2.79% was found in eyes receiving pindolol compared with the period when they were receiving saline. Substantial placebo effects were found when in-trial pressures were compared with pretrial, but the placebo effects were avoided in the analysis of the pindolol effect. Blood pressure and pulse rates were not significantly affected. There was slight evidence of pindolol in one eye affecting the contralateral eye but little evidence of persistence of hypotensive effects after cessation of treatment.", 
    "32": "1 Twelve-week courses of oxprenolol and methyldopa were administered in a randomised, double-blind cross over study to ten insulin dependent hypertensive diabetics. 2 Prior to treatment, and at the end of each period of drug administration, fasting levels of high density lipoprotein, triglycerides, free fatty acids and cholesterol were measured. 3 Neither preparation altered levels of high density lipoprotein and cholesterol, but both drugs significantly reduced the free fatty acids. 4 Whereas oxprenolol did not alter triglyceride levels, methyldopa significantly elevated triglycerides above pre-treatment values. 5 Oxprenolol does not appear to influence lipoprotein fractions affecting the relative risks of coronary heart disease, but methyldopa seems to have potentially detrimental effects of triglyceride levels.", 
    "33": "Primary hyperparathyroidism has become a relatively common endocrine disorder. Greater recognition of this disease has led to earlier detection. Consequently, primary hyperparathyroidism is now characterized frequently by asymptomatic mild hypercalcemia rather than by the more classical presentation with bone or renal involvement. Patients who have hypercalcemia and signs or symptoms should undergo neck surgery and removal of the abnormal parathyroid tissue. For the growing population of asymptomatic patients, however, indications for surgery are not as clear. The natural history of primary hyperparathyroidism is variable, and predicting who will develop complications of this disorder is not possible. Alternatives to surgery are careful and regular observation combined with various general and specific approaches currently receiving attention. Available information on the medical management of asymptomatic, mild primary hyperparathyroidism is summarized.", 
    "34": "In order to evaluate survival patterns in patients with left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease, 1492 patients with LMCA disease admitted to the U. S. Collaborative Study on Coronary Artery Surgery (CASS) were followed up. Of the 1492 patients, 1183 (79%) underwent coronary artery bypass (CABG) with an operative mortality of 4.2% and an average of 2.7 grafts/patient inserted. Allocation to surgery was by patient and physician preference and not random. Surgical patients generally had more severe angina, a higher prevalence of beta blocker usage, worse ventricular function and more severe LMCA stenosis than medically treated patients. Overall (4 years) survival of the surgical group was 88% compared to 63% in the medical group (p less than 0.001). Other independent predictors of mortality included angiographic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction score, age, % LMCA stenosis, hypertension, dominance, and presence of significant right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis greater than or equal to 50%. CABG was not shown to significantly improve survival in women, in LMCA patients with left dominant circulation, in LMCA patients with non-diseases dominant or balanced RCA circulation or in LMCA patients with greater than or equal to 50% RCA stenosis but good LV function. These data indicate that CABG prolongs life in most patients with left main coronary artery disease, particularly those with severe LMCA narrowing or severe LV dysfunction, however, subgroups of LMCA patients are identifiable who may fare with medical treatment alone.", 
    "35": "In isolated dog coronary arteries contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha, tyramine in concentrations of 10(-6) and 5 x 10(-6) M caused relaxations, but it produced contractions at 2 x 10(-5) M or higher. The relaxant response to tyramine was attenuated, but the contractile response was enhanced at the second trial as compared with the responses at the first. Relaxations induced by low concentrations of tyramine were reversed to contractions by treatment with propranolol (10(-6) M) or sotalol (10(-5) M), and were abolished by cocaine (3 x 10(-6) M) or bretylium (2 x 10(-5) M). In coronary arteries isolated from reserpine (0.5 mg/kg)-pretreated dogs, tyramine produced only a contraction. Under resting conditions, contractions induced by tyramine (5 x 10(-6) to 2 x 10(-3) M) were potentiated by cocaine and propranolol, and were inhibited by phentolamine. Norepinephrine produced a dose-dependent relaxation in the arteries contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha. In the presence of propranolol, the arteries under resting conditions were contracted by norepinephrine, the contraction being suppressed by treatment with phentolamine. It may be concluded that relaxations of dog coronary arteries induced by tyramine are mediated by liberation of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves which stimulates beta-adrenoceptors in the smooth muscle. It seems likely that the tyramine (2 x 10(-5) M or higher)-induced contraction is not mediated by norepinephrine released, but it is partly due to a direct action on alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "36": "The effects of oral propranolol and oral indomethacin on the normal response to inhaled PGE2 has been studied in 8 human volunteers. Inhalation dose-response curves to PGE2 in doses from 10 to 400 micrograms were constructed on three separate occasions. Either 80 mg or propranolol, 50 mg of indomethacin or identical placebo tablets were ingested 1 1/2 hours before PGE2 inhalation in random order and double blind. Propranolol had no effect of PGE2 induced bronchodilatation. In most subjects indomethacin caused a small baseline bronchodilatation and enhancement of PGE2 effect. In 2 subjects, however, indomethacin caused almost complete suppression of PGE2 bronchodilatation.", 
    "37": "The 24-h urinary excretion of prostaglandins (PG) E2 and F2 alpha, which reflects the renal synthesis of these substances, was measured by radioimmunoassay in 10 patients with essential hypertension before and after treatment with propranolol. In addition, changes in the urinary excretion of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha after furosemide injection were also studied before and after propranolol treatment. The urinary excretion of PGE2 was significantly increased after propranolol treatment, whereas that of PGF2 alpha did not change. An enhanced response in PGE2 excretion after furosemide injection was observed after propranolol treatment. In contrast PGF2 alpha increased in response to furosemide before, but not after, propranolol treatment. Changes in renal hemodynamics induced by propranolol seem to be the main factor in PGE2 alpha increase. However, an indirect effect of beta-blockade or a direct effect on the enzymes governing renal PG synthesis cannot be ruled out.", 
    "38": "Tics are the most common movement disorder of childhood. The single tic, or habit spasm, is benign and self-limited. Complex tic disorders include other features such a multiple tics, vocal tics, and complex stereotyped movements. Tourette syndrome represents the most-severe end of a spectrum of tic disorders. The basic features are multiple tics and vocalizations with a changing repertoire over time. Severity waxes and wanes spontaneously. Treatment with haloperidol is effective but associated with a high incidence of side effects. Some cases undergo remission in late adolescence. There is a strong genetic component. Sympathomimetic drugs may precipitate the syndrome. Tremors are less common in children. Essential tremor is a benign but troublesome condition which frequently is familial. Treatment with propranolol is effective. The majority of tremors in the pediatric age group are due to underlying metabolic, endocrine, or heredodegenerative disorders. Treatment is that of the underlying biochemical abnormality.", 
    "39": "We have examined the inhibitory effect of atropine and sodium cromoglycate (SCG) on the bronchial response to sulphur dioxide (SO2) in groups of normal and asthmatic subjects. Eleven normal subjects were premedicated with propranolol (100 mg orally) one hour before each experiment. After baseline measurements of specific airways conductance (sGaw) the subject inhaled an aerosol from a Wright nebuliser for five minutes. In separate experiments this contained water (control), atropine methonitrate (0 . 2%), or SCG (1%). Fifteen minutes later sGaw was remeasured and the subject then breathed SO2 (8 ppm) for three minutes through the mouth. Specific airways conductance was measured for the duration of the subsequent response. Intervals between experiments on any one subject were one week or more. After control SO2 inhalation sGaw decreased in all subjects (mean 34 +/- 17 (SD)%). Atropine and SCG significantly inhibited the SO2 response (p less than 0 . 01 for both). After atropine the mean decrease in sGaw was 13 +/- 24%; after SCG 16 +/- 12% (range -3- + 55%). With atropine the degree of inhibition was inversely related to the subject's responsiveness to the control SO2 inhalation (r = 0 . 75; p less than 0 . 01). In four asthmatics (without beta-blockade and with lower SO2 exposure) atropine did not inhibit the SO2 response; SCG had a similar effect to that seen in normal subjects. Therefore, vagal efferent mechanisms are involved in the bronchial response to SO2 in normal subjects, but the lack of inhibition caused by atropine in hyperreactive normal and asthmatic subjects suggests that vagal mechanisms are not important in the causation of hyperreactivity to SO2. The mechanism of inhibition with SCG is unknown.", 
    "40": "Bepridil, a new anti-anginal drug, increases coronary blood flow and reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. The comparative effects of bepridil (2.5 mg.kg-1), nitroglycerin (40 microgram/.kg-1) and propranolol (0.5 mg.kg-1) on myocardial performance, were studied in anesthetized dogs. All drugs were injected intravenously within 60 sec. Continuous recordings of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, peripheral arterial pressure and external ventricular dimensions were made during a 31 min period following drug administration. Similarly, several contractility indices were calculated during the phase of isovolumic contraction. Bepridil was found to decrease left ventricular work, by 14.3 +/- 4.4% while increasing aortic blood flow by 24 +/- 6%. In addition, this compound weakly and only briefly decreased contractility, but reduced the afterload more markedly by 34.2 +/- 3.8%. The external ventricular circumference was only slightly increased. Nitroglycerin reduced aortic flow, ventricular dimensions together with the pre- and afterloads. Propranolol reduced aortic flow while considerably increasing ventricular dimensions and preload. Thus, in the anesthetized dog, the intravenous administration of bepridil decreases left ventricular work while increasing aortic blood flow. Both effects occur during mild and prolonged bradycardia.", 
    "41": "Xylazine (rompun) has sedative, analgetic and myorelaxative effects; in addition to this, it also influences the homeostasis of glucose in the organism. The changes in glucose tolerance were studied in young rats after the administration of xylazine in combination with the blockers of adrenergic receptors. Xylazine caused hyperglycaemia and glucose intolerance in young rats and the administration of the beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) prolonged this diabetogenic effect. On the other hand, glucose tolerance after the administration of xylazine with alpha-adrenergic blocker (phentolamine) is close to the normal level. It is supposed on the basis of our results that xylazine-induced glucose intolerance and hyperglycaemia are mediated by the stimulation of the alpha-adrenergic system. Besides inhibition of insulin secretion, hepatic glycogenolysis probably also increases.", 
    "42": "First-pass lung uptake of propranolol in catheterized ambulant dogs was measured by comparison the difference between the ratios of [14C]propranolol to indocyanine green (ICG) before and after a single passage through the pulmonary circulation. Uptake was 56 +/- 5, 53 +/- 8, and 61 +/- 10% (mean +/- SD) when 0.02, 0.2, and 2.0 mg of propranolol were injected, respectively. There was a negative though unimportant correlation between percent uptake and cardiac output. Analysis of paired propranolol and ICG outflow curves confirmed the lack of saturation with increasing dose and suggested the involvement of simple diffusion. In four dogs uptake fell from 4.76 +/- 6.8 to 40.4 +/- 8.2% (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.025) during partial occlusion of the pulmonary circulation by a Swan-Ganz catheter balloon and rose again to 51.2 +/- 6.4% after relief of the occlusion. Propranolol uptake, measured serially in five dogs with indwelling catheters, was initially 55% but fell linearly to 30% over 2 wk (r = -0.59, P less than 0.001), and necropsy showed pathological features of shock lung. A similar study performed on three dogs within 4 days of catheterization showed no change in uptake of the drug. Propranolol uptake appears to reflect both quantitative and qualitative changes in the pulmonary endothelium. This method may therefore be valuable in studying the pulmonary endothelium in health and disease.", 
    "43": "Intraportal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was used to produce selective hepatic sympathectomy in the dog. Previously reported techniques for 6-OHDA induced hepatic sympathectomy in rats and cats were modified considerably using alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents to prevent the otherwise intense and fatal sympathomimetic response which has prevented adaptation of the intraportal 6-OHDA injection for dogs. After 6-OHDA injection, histofluorescent staining demonstrated loss of hepatic adrenergic nerves with preservation of normal adrenergic innervation in the heart and pancreas. Tyramine iv was used to further document functional integrity of peripheral sympathetic mechanisms. This technique provides a useful model for evaluation of sympathetic nervous system mediated changes in hepatic metabolic function associated with the neuroendocrine response to hemorrhage in the classic dog model.", 
    "44": "Using a double-blind protocol, we investigated the use of propranolol in patients with coronary artery spasm as assessed by subjective and objective variables. Both low-dose (40 mg every 6 hours) and high-dose (160 mg every 6 hours) propranolol were administered. At both doses, the duration of angina attacks was significantly prolonged but the frequency was not. We conclude that propranolol at doses up to 160 mg every 6 hours as single therapy is frequently detrimental in angina pectoris due to coronary artery spasm and should not be used as the sole treatment of this disorder.", 
    "45": "The effects of long-term sodium repletion and timolol maleate treatment on the zona glomerulosa of dexamethasone- and ACTH-administered rats were investigated. Morphometry showed that both treatments induced a noticeable atrophy of the zona glomerulosa and its parenchymal cells, which is mainly due to the decrease in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondrial compartment. Radio-immunological studies indicated that in the treated rats the plasma aldosterone concentration was significantly decreased. Combined sodium repletion and timolol maleate administration provoked more intense effects than the single treatments. These data confirm the contention that both Na/K balance and the renin-angiotensin system are involved in the maintenance of the growth and steroidogenic capacity of the rat zona glomerulosa, with interfering without the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal axis.", 
    "46": "A doubly transformed rat glioma cell line, designated C6V-1, was obtained from rat glioma C6 cells by infection with a rat-adapted variant of Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV-M-os). The C6V-1 cells show karyotypic changes in chromosome number (43) and structure, while C6 cells possess a normal male karyotype. C6V-1 and C6 cells were employed for characterization of a receptor-adenylate cyclase system of the surface membrane. C6V-1 cells showed lower adenylate cyclase activity than that of C6 cells, though the apparent Km for ATP in both types of cells was the same. The maximal stimulation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol was significantly reduced, and Kact for isoproterenol was approximately 18-fold lower in C6V-1 cells. When the concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors was measured by various concentrations of [3H] dihydroalprenolol (DHA), the maximal binding sites of C6 and C6V-1 cells were 760 and 230 fmol/mg protein, respectively, without any changes in the association constant for DHA. The concentration of isoproterenol required for 50% displacement of the [3H] DHA binding (Kd) was the same (around 1.5 X 10(-6)M) in both cells, measured in the presence of GTP. Thus the 19-fold drop in the Kd/Kact ratio in C6V-1 cells suggests an incomplete coupling of beta-receptors to adenylate cyclase. Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity and cAMP content in C6V-1 were lower than in C6 cells. Mitochondrial monoamine oxidase and cytosomal enolase activities, however, were somewhat higher in C6V-1 cells. The results indicate that a set of changes in the receptors and in the cyclic AMP system of C6V-1 is one of the specific alterations by transformation, even though those may not be the cause of cell transformation.", 
    "47": "If beta-adrenergic relaxation of smooth muscle is partly mediated by the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) system, then beta-stimulation should be correlated to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cPK). Studies were performed with bovine coronary arterial strips to identify isozymic forms of cPK and to determine if beta-relaxation is correlated to activation of cPK (reflected by elevated ratios of cPK activity without cAMP to cPK activity with cAMP). Both ion exchange chromatography and a new electrophoretic technique revealed two cPK isozymes (types I and II). No change in cPK activity occurred in strips contracted with 30 mM KCl. In contrast, dose- and time-dependent relaxation during beta-stimulation with isoproterenol was highly correlated to parallel increases in cPK activity. Increased cPK activity was inhibited in assays performed with a specific inhibitor of cPK. Both relaxation and activation of cPK were abolished during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Relaxation by KCl removal or the ionophore R02-2985, unlike beta-mediated relaxation, did not increase cPK activity. These findings show that beta-mediated relaxation of isolated coronary arterial strips specifically activates cPK, and they support the hypothesis that beta-induced relaxation of vascular smooth muscle involves the cAMP system.", 
    "48": "Progesterone depressed rapidly (50% at 1 min) and persistently cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration that had been elevated by cholera toxin in Xenopus laevis oocytes. cAMP remained below 1 pmol per oocyte (mean basal level) for approximately 1 hr and thereafter rose to approximately 120% of control values, while germinal vesicle (nucleus) breakdown did not occur. In the absence of cholera toxin, progesterone treatment for 6 hr maintained cAMP concentration below the basal level (but not lower than 80%), and germinal vesicle breakdown occurred. Experiments in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors suggested that progesterone modulates adenylate cyclase activity. The maturation promoting factor, which is formed after 3-5 hr of progesterone treatment and provokes germinal vesicle breakdown after its injection into untreated oocytes, also decreased cAMP concentration, an observation that may explain its \"autoamplification.\" Nonsteroidal inducers of meiosis reinitiation (e.g., propranolol, methoxyverapamil, mersalyl) diminished the cholera toxin-mediated accumulation of cAMP, in contrast to compounds devoid of meiotic-inducing capacity and antagonist to progesterone action, such as gammexane (an inositol analogue) and 5'-deoxy-S-(2-methylpropyl)-5'-thioadenosine (a methylase inhibitor), that increased the nucleotide level. The fine control, suggested by the effects of small changes in cAMP levels, gives evidence of great sensitivity to a critical determinant governing meiotic cell division.", 
    "49": "Radioligand binding assays were used to demonstrate the presence of alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta receptors in rat spinal cord. Specific and saturable binding was exhibited for [3H]-WB 4101 (alpha 1), [3H]-aminoclonidine (alpha 2) and [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (beta). Binding was of high affinity and the total number of binding sites (Bmax) were: alpha 1, 66.5 +/- 1.0 fmol/mg protein; alpha 2, 20.0 +/- 0.6 fmol/mg protein; beta, 10.2 +/- 0.3 fmol/mg protein. The data confirms the existence of adrenergic receptors in spinal cord and provides further evidence of the role of catecholaminergic neurons in regulating spinal cord physiology.", 
    "50": "The effect of chronic ACTH administration on the growth and aldosterone secretion of the zona glomerulosa of sodium-loaded timolol maleate-treated rats was investigated by stereological and radioimmunological techniques. Combined sodium loading and timolol maleate administration induced a significant atrophy of the zona glomerulosa and its cells. The plasma concentration of aldosterone was significantly decreased, while that of corticosterone did not vary. ACTH administration completely reversed zona glomerulosa atrophy, and the plasma concentration of corticosterone was noticeably enhanced, whereas that of aldosterone underwent a further decrease. This data suggests that in the absence of the other adrenoglomerulotrophic factors, ACTH stimulates the growth of the zona glomerulosa, but transforms its parenchymal elements to a functional fasciculata cell type.", 
    "51": "The ability of 10 muM epinephrine or isoproterenol to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation was decreased in hepatocytes isolated from hyperthyroid (triiodothyronine treated) as compared to euthyroid rats. In the presence of methylisobutylxanthine, epinephrine or isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation was approximately 65% lower in hyperthyroid as compared with euthyroid rat hepatocytes. The ability of glucagon to stimulate a cyclic AMP response was also decreased in the hyperthyroid state, when assayed in either the absence or presence of a methyl xanthine. The character of the catecholamine-stimulated cyclic AMP response was beta adrenergic in both the hyperand euthyroid states. No evidence for an alpha(2) adrenergic mediated component of catecholamine action on cyclic AMP levels was noted. Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity of hepatocyte homogenates was not altered in the hyperthyroid state. Hormone-stimulated, guanine nucleotide- and fluoride-activatable adenylate cyclase activity was reduced in subcellular fractions obtained from hyperthyroid as compared with euthyroid rat hepatocytes. Beta adrenergic receptor binding was reduced approximately 35% and glucagon receptor binding reduced approximately 50% in the hyperthyroid as compared with euthyroid rat hepatocyte membrane fractions. The status of the regulatory components of adenylate cyclase were examined by in vitro treatment of subcellular fractions with cholera toxin. The ability of cholera toxin to modulate adenylate cyclase was not altered by hyperthyroidism. Cholera toxin catalyzed AD[(32)P]ribosylation of hyperthyroid and euthyroid rat hepatocyte proteins separated electrophoretically displayed nearly identical autoradiograms. Studies of the reconstitution of adenylate cyclase activity of S49 mouse lymphoma cyc(-) mutant membranes by detergent extracts from rat hepatocyte membranes, indicated that hyperthyroidism was associated with a reduced capacity of regulatory components to confer fluoride, but not guanine nucleotide activatability to catalytic cyclase. Thyroid hormones regulate the hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase system of rat hepatocytes at several distinct loci of the system.", 
    "52": "In brown adipose tissue of the rat, chemically or surgically induced hypothyroidism caused the following effects. A large decrease of the magnitude of the metabolic response to electrical nerve stimulation. The deactivation half-time of the response was reduced to 70% of the control value, with no change in catechol O-methyltransferase activity. Pre-incubation of tissues with norepinephrine, 10(-5) M, increased the response to subsequent nerve stimulation almost to that of the controls. The catecholamine analogue dose-response curves were shifted to the right. The shift was very pronounced for isoproterenol (K50 426 nM versus 2 nM), somewhat less marked for norepinephrine (7373 nM versus 194) and very slight for phenylephrine (2803 nM versus 1649); there was almost no change in Emax values. An increase of octanoate oxidative capacity. A decrease of the capacity of the stereoselective binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol of the high-affinity (Kd 2.0 nM) sites to a fourth of the control value and an increase by a factor of 2.9 of the Kd of the low-affinity binding sites. This decrease of binding to the beta-receptors was not sufficient quantitatively to explain the decrease in the metabolic response, suggesting the existence of an additional defective reaction which could occur between the binding to the beta-receptors and the activation of the triglyceride lipase. These results show that the sharp decrease of the metabolic response of brown adipose tissue to nerve stimulation has multiple causes. The findings are discussed in the context of the drastic decrease of cold resistance in hypothyroid rats.", 
    "53": "beta-Receptor number, norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and lipolysis, octanoate-induced NAD(P) redox changes, and heat production were studied in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of lean and obese (ob/ob) mice. beta-Receptor number was increased 1.54-fold in purified brown adipocyte plasma membrane of ob/ob mice compared to that in lean controls. This increase was reversed by cold adaptation (5 C). Basal and norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase values were not different in the two groups. Norepinephrine stimulated lipolysis at 10 nM in BAT of lean mice, but only at 10 microM in BAT ob/ob mice. Octanoate produced an increase in the NAD(P) redox state in BAT of lean mice, but it did not modify the NAD(P) redox state in BAT of ob/ob mice. Concomitantly, octanoate increased heat production 3-fold in BAT of lean mice, but did not promote any significant increase in heat production in BAT of ob/ob mice. These two parameters were restored toward values observed in lean mice when the ob/ob mice were adapted to a cold environment. The data indicate that BAT of ob/ob mice exhibits three alterations; one at the level of the beta-receptor, one at the level of the lipolytic response to norepinephrine, and one at the level of fatty acid activation and/or beta-oxidation.", 
    "54": "A range of membrane-active drugs were tested for their ability to prevent beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 release from freshly collected blood platelets. While all the drugs tested could inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation, only a few, notably procaine and the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, camoquine and quinacrine (mepacrine), effectively prevented the alpha-granule release reaction.", 
    "55": "A randomized double-blind crossover trial was undertaken in 20 volunteers to evaluate the effects of acebutolol and sustained release quinidine sulfate. The patients had an average of 10 or more premature ventricular complexes/hour on two 24 hour electrocardiographic recordings, or 10 or more/min during two cycle stress tests, or any number of complex forms of ventricular ectopic activity on either test. The 24 hour recordings yielded greater detection of complex forms than did stress tests and manifested similar relative variability in frequency of ventricular ectopic beats. The extent of variability from hour to hour within the 24 hour monitoring periods tended to have an increasing relation with frequency of ectopic beat activity regardless of the presence or absence of treatment. Within-patient variability among periods with equivalent treatment status also tended to have such an increasing relation with frequency of ectopic beat activity. About 35 percent of the variation was among subjects, 20 percent among months within subjects, 20 percent among days in months and 25 percent among hours in days. Acebutolol, 300 mg three times daily, produced effective beta receptor blockade and was better tolerated than sustained release quinidine sulfate in identical doses and had equal suppressant effects. The results of the variability studies provide guidelines for the design of adequate clinical trials testing suppressant interventions."
