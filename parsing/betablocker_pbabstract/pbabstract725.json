Smooth reduction of arterial pressure was achieved in twelve subjects; one remained resistant to labetalol up to 160 mg/h; a sudden fall in pressure occurred in the remaining six. No serious complications were encountered. Blood pressure control was accompanied by slight byt significant reduction in heart rate and in plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations. 3. The administration of labetalol in this way appears to be a useful technique in patients requiring rapid reduction of arterial pressure, although close and continuous supervision is necessary.", 
    "1": "The exercise tests of 26 male patients with significant left main disease were compared with those of 51 patients with three-vessel disease and 38 patients with two-vessel disease. Exercise-induced ischaemia (chest pain and/or greater than 1 mm ST segment change) occurred in 100 per cent of left main, 69 per cent of three-vessel, and 45 per cent of two-vessel disease patients. Though the mean peak work load was significantly higher in the two-vessel disease group than in those with three-vessel of left main disease, there was a wide overlap between groups. No intergroup differences were found in mean peak heart rates. In patients taking propranolol, no differences in mean peak work loads and heart rates were seen. The study showed that the absence of an exercise-induced abnormal electrocardiographic response virtually excludes left main disease. As judged by exercise performance, the presence of left main disease did not correlate with the severity of the patient's symptomatology. Propranolol did not influence the frequency of an ischaemic response in patients with left main or three-vessel disease.", 
    "2": "Two neonates with arrhythmias and the long QT syndrome are described. The arrhythmias were detected in utero and both infants were apparently well after birth. The first infant, although well, had a bradycardia for the first 9 days of life. A normal heart rate was documented at 10 days but a prolonged QT interval was not appreciated on the ECG. He was discharged from hospital but died suddenly and unexpectedly 3 days later. A post-mortem examination failed to find a cause for his death which therefore fell into the category of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). A retrospective analysis of the perinatal electrocardiogram showed a probable junctional rhythm with 2:1 conduction to the ventricle; the QT interval was prolonged at 0.52 seconds (QTC = 0.63). The second infant had a QT interval of 0.52 seconds (QTC = 0.54) and frequent ventricular premature beats on a 24-hour electrocardiogram. She was treated with propranolol and remains well 2 years later. Sudden infant death has often been described in the siblings of children with the long QT syndrome and one other report described a case of SIDS which was said to have had a prolonged QT interval on the perinatal ECG. This report, however, provides unquestionable evidence, in one case, of an association between the long QT syndrome and SIDS.", 
    "3": "The vascular steal phenomenow, that is, the shunting of blood from ischemic to normally perfused areas, is commonly observed during exercise in the affected limbs of patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency. Propranolol was administered to 18 arteriopathic patients before the exercise to ascertain whether the reverse situation can be induced. The results indicate that before propranolol administration, Jantsch's index (used to quantify the plethysmographic waves) decreased from 0.53 +/- 0.05 to 0.33 +/- 0.04 (P less than 0.001) at 1 minute, and to 0.38 +/- 0.04 (P less than 0.001) at 5 minutes after the end of the exercise. When the exercise was repeated after propranolol, Jantsch's index did not change. These findings indicate that propranolol can inhibit exercise-induced vascular steal.", 
    "4": "Arrhythmias often complicate the course of patients with severe respiratory disease; the frequency of arrhythmias in patients with this condition approaches that seen with acute myocardial infarction. No one rhythm disturbance predominates, but rapid atrial and ventricular rhythms are characteristic. In the setting of acute respiratory failure, several conditions may predispose to arrhythmias. Hypoxemia, a serum pH that is too high or too low, and a low serum potassium may produce arrhythmias by disturbing the myocardial cellular milieu. Drugs such as digitalis, epinephrine, and theophylline may also act as myocardial irritants. The first step in therapy is to careful examination, it is helpful to note the specific effect of the arrhythmia on the patient. Some rhythm disturbances are well tolerated, while others are associated with serious problems in ventilation and perfusion. In many cases the control of respiration, correction of pH and electrolyte imbalance, and provision of bronchial hygiene will restore a normal sinus rhythm. Such measures are essential even when antiarrhythmic drugs or cardioversion are needed.", 
    "5": "Symptomatic superficial punctate keratitis associated with complete corneal anesthesia occurred in three patients after they had been taking timolol maleate for glaucoma. After discontinuation of the timolol maleate and substitution of conventional antiglaucomatous collyria, the keratitis gradually cleared with restoration of normal corneal sensitivity. Corneal sensitivity, measured in 25 additional patients taking timolol maleate, was markedly diminished in four patients, all of whom were elderly and had been using the drug for a minimum of three months. Timolol maleate does appear to have some local anesthetic properties in human cornea after chronic use by susceptible individuals.", 
    "6": "Adverse effects involving one or more organ systems occurred in 38 of 165 patients with various types of glaucoma when timolol was added to their glaucoma therapy. It was necessary to discontinue timolol because of these side effects in 15 (9%) of the patients. Double-masked studies will be necessary to clarify the relationship of these adverse effects to the use of timolol.", 
    "7": "1 The effects of a newly developed dopamine-xanthine derivative, 7-propyl-theophylline-dopamine (D4975), have been examined in cats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone. When administered intravenously (in doses as low as 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/kg) it increased systemic arterial pressure, left ventricular (LV) dP/dtmax, dP/dt at fixed ventricular isovolumic pressures and cardiac output. Heart rate effects were minimal. 2 D4975 was about 5 times more active than dopamine or dobutamine in elevating LV dP/dtmax or dP/dt at common peak isovolumic pressures (CPIP) and about 10 times more active than dopamine at increasing systemic arterial blood pressure. The effects of D4975 were also more prolonged than those of the other two agents. 3 The effects of D4975 on LV dP/dtmax were greatly reduced by the prior administration of propranolol. D4975 has no effect on peripheral beta 2-adrenoceptors. 4 It is suggested that the effects of D4975 on the myocardium involve both beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation and inhibition of phosphodiesterase and that the marked and prolonged pressor response is due to resistance to enzymatic breakdown by monoamine oxidase. 5 The results suggest that D4975 might prove valuable in the treatment of the hypotension and reduced myocardial contractility of shock, especially as it is possible to select a dose that increases LV dP/dtmax without increasing either heart rate of systemic arterial pressure.", 
    "8": "The effect of bilateral carotid sinus denervation (CSD) on the ECG and on the monophasic ventricular action potential (MAP) was studied in 28 and 4 rats, respectively. After CSD, T wave changes, similar to those seen in man after carotid endarterectomy, were observed and mean Q-T prolongations of 19 ms were recorded (P less than 0.001). Mean MAP increased by 10 ms (P less than 0.02). P-QRS and heart rate remained stable. Propranolol, 10 mg/kg iv, before CSD and 10 mg.kg-1.day-1 iv for 2 days prevented all ECG abnormalities. Atropine, 1 mg/kg iv, before CSD and 2.5 mg.kg-1.day-1 iv for 2 days had no effect. Isoproterenol, 0.02-0.06 microgram iv, after CSD produced further lengthening of the MAP and Q-T interval. Blood gases and electrolytes remained unchanged, and cardiac histology was unremarkable. These results suggest that CSD produces alterations in cardiac sympathetic activity in the rat leading to MAP and Q-T prolongations and to changes in the T wave form. Similar mechanisms may be operative after carotid endarterectomy in man.", 
    "9": "The antihypertensive effects of atenolol and propranolol were compared in a double-blind crossover study of 19 patients with essential hypertension (World Health Organization, I and II) who were receiving long-term diuretic treatment (chlorthalidone, 50 mg daily) during the study. After a 3-wk placebo period, a beta-adrenergic antagonist was administered once daily (atenolol, 50 mg daily, or propranolol, 80 mg daily) for a week. If the MAP was more than 108 mm Hg at the end of the week, dosage of the beta-blocker was doubled the following week; when necessary, doubling was repeated to a maximum dose of 640 mg propranolol and 400 mg atenolol daily. Fifty milligrams atenolol had a greater effect than 80 mg propranolol and was as effective as 160 mg propranolol. The dose-response curve flattened off after 160 mg propranolol and 50 mg atenolol daily. The two highest doses of atenolol lowered MAP more than the highest doses of propranolo. Heart rate slowing was the same for both drugs and did not correlate with the fall in blood pressure. PRA was suppressed by all doses of propranolol, whereas atenolol suppressed PRA only at the 2 highest doses, (200 and 400 mg daily). With the lower propranolol doses, the percent MAP change correlated weakly with the percent PRA change (80 mg--r = 0.41, p less than 0.1; 160 mg--r = 0.64, p less than 0.05). Side effects were minimal, and were noted only with 640 mg propranolol; with this exception, the percentage of patients with no complaints rose when placebo was replaced by beta-blockers.", 
    "10": "A patient with severe narcolepsy and cataplexy had been treated with a high dosage of methylphenidate hydrochloride, but the drug was not effective. To relieve the patient's cardiac arrhythmia, which was assumed to be secondary to drug therapy, we withdrew methylphenidate therapy and started propranolol hydrochloride therapy. When the dosage of propranolol was increased to a level consistent with maximum beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, the attacks were eliminated.", 
    "11": "We have previously reported that 25 micrograms/kg of intravenous (i.v.) delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) produces marked increases in heart rate, prolongation of left ventricular ejection time corrected for heart rate (LVETc), and a shortening of the pre-ejection period in normal volunteers. Beta-adrenergic blockade partially attenuates these responses. To elucidate further the mechanism of action of delta-9-THC, we gave 10 normal volunteers 0.1 mg/kg of i.v. propranolol and 2 mg of i.v. atropine before they received 25 micrograms/kg of i.v. delta-9-THC. Systolic time intervals were compared in the denervated subjects before and after delta-9-THC. Post delta-9-THC responses were measured at a time approximating peak psychologic high. Mean +/- SEM heart rate before and after delta-9-THC was 89 +/- 4 and 87 +/- 3 beats/min (NS); mean +/- SEM pre-ejection period before and after delta-9-TCH was 107 +/- 5 and 109 +/- 4 ms (NS); and mean +/- SEM LVETc before and after delta-9-THC was 433 +/- 6 and 429 +/- 6 ms (NS). Since previous denervation of our subjects with atropine and propranolol totally abolished changes in heart rate and systolic time intervals, the cardiac effects of delta-9-THC appear to be mediated totally via the autonomic nervous system, probably reflecting direct central nervous system stimulation.", 
    "12": "The natural history of variant angina is described in a patient with multiple exacerbations and remissions over a period of several years. Constant in-hospital electrocardiographic monitoring for 26 days documented 569 episodes of ST elevation, 89% of which were asymptomatic. Episodes ranged in duration from 15 seconds to 11 1/2 minutes, with 4% of episodes associated with premature ventricular contractions. Over the course of hospitalization, the episodes of ST elevation decreased in frequency and length, as did episodes of pain. During this period, a number of therapeutic agents, including propranolol, indomethacin, and chlorpheniramine were evaluated using double-blind crossover trials. No agent had a significant beneficial effect on the course of the disease, and there was an increase in the length of episodes with high doses of propranolol. Because of the great variability in the course of this disease, only double-blind crossover trials should be allowed to dictate the efficacy of therapeutic agents.", 
    "13": "Chronic, low-grade, unexplained increases of total serum bilirubin concentration were observed in 16 of 132 (12%) chronic dialysis patients. Cessation of antihypertensive medication in four patients resulted in disappearance of hyperbilirubinemia. Propranolol was the only antihypertensive drug common to all 16 patients. Daily dosage varied among the patients, but the mean dose was 308 mg (+/- 51 SEM). Serial determinations of sera from individual patients given different doses and from the group as a whole demonstrated a linear relationship between propranolol dose and apparent total serum bilirubin concentration with continuous-flow analysis. When serum specimens from uremic patients receiving propranolol were treated with diazotized fulfanilic acid and examined spectrophotometrically, an absorbance peak distinct from but overlapping that of bilirubin was consistently demonstrated. The material producing the peak disappeared when the drug was stopped, did not dialyze, and was not reproduced by the in vitro addition of propranolol to uremic serum. We postulate that a metabolite(s) of propranolol is retained in uremic serum and interferes with the bilirubin determination.", 
    "14": "The antiarrhythmic efficacy of propranolol was evaluated in 32 patients with chronic high frequency ventricular arrhythmias in a placebo-controlled protocol. After a placebo control period, propranolol was begun and the dosage increased sequentially until arrhythmia suppression was achieved, side effects appeared, or a maximum dosage of 960 mg/day was reached. Computerized analysis of ambulatory recordings was used to quantify the arrhythmias. Twenty-four patients had 70--100% arrhythmia suppression at plasma levels ranging from 12--1100 ng/ml (end of dosing interval). Eight patients in this group had frequent episodes of ventricular tachycardia that were totally suppressed at or below the dosage that produced greater than or equal to 70% suppression of ventricular ectopic depolarizations (VEDs). A biphasic dose-response curve was seen in five patients who responded with a decrease in arrhythmia frequency in the lower ranges of dosages but had increased frequency of ectopic rhythms as the dosage was increased above the optimal level. Only one-third of patients responded at doses less than or equal to 160 mg/day. However, with dosages of 200--640 mg/day, an additional 40% responded. Propranolol appears to control ventricular arrhythmias safely and effectively in many patients. The finding that the antiarrhythmic effect in many patients required plasma concentrations greater than those that produce substantial beta-adrenergic blockage raises a question whether blockade of cardiac beta receptors can directly account for all of the antiarrhythmic actions of propranolol.", 
    "15": "The abundance of membrane cholesterol is an important determinant of the functional properties of biomembranes. To determine whether arterial smooth muscle acquires altered contractile properties in a high cholesterol environment, isolated canine coronary arteries were exposed to cholesterol in stable aqueous solution. Cholesterol, 10(-12) to 10(-10) M, was an efficacious vasoconstrictor, as maximum contractions equaled those obtained with 15 mM KCl. Antiadrenergic interventions, including chemical sympathectomy in vivo with 6-hydroxydopamine and alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine and L-propranolol (both 10(-6 M), did not significantly attenuate the contractions. However, responses to cholesterol were abolished completely by (+/-)-verapamil (10(-6) M). Cholesterol in picomolar concentration enhanced the constrictor effects of CaCl2 and KCl, both in the presence and absence of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade. Increases in tone in response to graded elevations in the CaCl2 concentration (0-2 mM) were augmented up to 1.5-fold by 10(-12) M cholesterol (P less than 0.01). Results indicate that cholesterol sensitizes isolated coronary arteries to external Ca2+ by a nonadrenergic mechanism. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that acquisition of membrane cholesterol may alter the contractile properties of coronary arterial smooth muscle, a phenomenon that could play a role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic heart disease.", 
    "16": "Left renal artery stenosis increased and timolol maleate chronic administration decreased systolic blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone concentration, in adult male rats. In the hypertensive animals the volume of the zona glomerulosa, the volume and number of zona glomerulosa cells, as well as the volume of the mitochondrial compartment and the surface area of SER and mitochondrial cristae, were significantly increased. The volume of the lipid compartment was reduced, and several clumps of electron-dense granules appeared at the juxta-sinusoidal pole of the cells. Opposite results were found in the zona glomerulosa of the hypotensive rats, with the exception that the volume of the lipid compartment showed no significant change. These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in the maintenance and stimulation of the growth in the zona glomerulosa. Since in the hypertensive rats the increase in the volume density of electron-dense granules fits well with that in the intracellular concentration of aldosterone, the working hypothesis is that these granules are aldosterone-containing secretory organelles.", 
    "17": "The beta 2 adrenergic agonist Salbutamol was infused intravenously in doses of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/kg-min in conscious dogs with gastric fistulae. Salbutamol inhibited meal-stimulated acid (measured with intragastric titration) by up to 82%. Salbutamol produced dose-related inhibition of acid stimulated by pentagastrin (up to 88%) and by histamine (up to 52%). Pepsin secretion in response to histamine (but not pentagastrin) was also inhibited by salbutamol. The salbutamol infusion caused a marked tachycardia, an increase in pulse pressure, slight hyperkalaemia and hyperglycaemia. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol augmented pentagastrin-stimulated acid and inhibited meal-stimulated secretion. Propranolol abolished salbutamol - induced tachycardia, and blocked the inhibition by salbutamol of pentagastrin-stimulated acid. Salbutamol inhibition of acid in the dog provides further support for the hypothesis that there are beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the stomach.", 
    "18": "The hemodynamic effect of timolol maleate in open angle glaucoma was studied rheo-oculographically. Increase in the ocular pulse which reaches maximal amplification 2 h after the instillation of the drug was observed. The maximal pressure lowering effect appeared 3 h after instillation, as if the hemodynamic effect were the trigger for the pressure lowering effect.", 
    "19": "Patients with unstable angina should first be medically managed with the maximally effective drug regimen. Cardiac catheterization is called for if the angina continues. Surgical intervention may be more effective if preceded by intensive medical management. You should be aware, however, that patients with unstable angina and significant left main coronary disease require immediate coronary bypass surgery.", 
    "20": "The effect on work performance of a single oral dose of the cardio-selective beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, metoprolol, was compared with an equipotent dose of the non-selective agent, propranolol, in the same subjects. A number of biochemical and physiological variables including heart rate, oxygen consumption, ventilation, lactate, free fatty acid and glucose levels were measured. Following exercise in the presence of both active drugs, subjects complained of excessive leg fatique. For the group there was a significant reduction in the total work performed and the maximum heart rate achieved on both drugs. There was a significant correlation between plasma levels of metoprolol, reduction in total work performed and reduction in maximum heart rate. By contrast, after propranolol, there was a wide variation in work performed at a time when the reduction in maximum heart rate was similar for all subjects. This suggests for propranolol that a reduction in heart rate alone is an inappropriate guide to the impairment of work performance. There was a fail in the circulating level of free fatty acids at the end of exercise in the presence of both drugs and it is possible that this biochemical variable contributed to the decrease in work performance.", 
    "21": "Convulsant doses of pentylenetetrazol (100 mg/kg) increase levels of both cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP in mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In animals pretreated with reserpine, propranolol, or aminophylline, pentylenetetrazol seizures were more severe, cyclic AMP elevations were attenuated or blocked, and cyclic GMP increases were unaffected or augmented. These data indicate that norepinephrine, adenosine, and perhaps other biogenic amines have a regulatory effect on cyclic AMP, but not cyclic GMP, levels in epileptic brain. An increased level of cyclic AMP in brain tissue may have an antiepileptic effect leading to seizure attenuation or termination. By contrast, elevated levels of cyclic GMP may have an epileptogenic effect in initiating or maintaining seizure activity.", 
    "22": "The beta-adrenergic receptors were studied in vitro in lymphocytes obtained from patients with major affective disorders and controls. Specific L-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding was decreased in both depressed and manic patients compared to controls and euthymic patients. Isoproterenol-stimulated, but not prostaglandin El-stimulated, cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate production was decreased in manic and depressed patients. These results suggest decreased lymphocyte beta-receptor functioning in depression and mania. This decrease may be an index of changes in brain beta-receptors in mania and depression, or may simply reflect homeostatic regulation of peripheral beta-receptors in response to stress-induced increases in circulating catecholamines.", 
    "23": "Desensitization of catecholamine stimulated adenylate cyclase (AC) activity is demonstrated in membranes derived from turkey erythrocytes pre-treated with isoproterenol. Membranes from desensitized cells had a loss in maximal catecholamine stimulated adenylate cyclase activity of 104 +/- 13 (pmols/mg protein/10', p less than .001) compared with controls. When adenylate cyclase was maximally stimulated with NaF or Gpp(NH)p, the decrements were 84 +/- 19 (p less than .005) and 92 +/- 32 (p less than .05) pmol/mg protein/10' respectively. There was no change in beta-adrenergic receptor number in membranes derived from treated cells. While the molecular mechanism accounting for the desensitization is uncertain, the data is consistent with the hypothesis that there is a lesion distal to the beta-adrenergic receptor, possibly involving the nucleotide site or the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase, causing the desensitization in the isoproterenol treated cells.", 
    "24": "Autoradiographic localization of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat skeletal muscle in vivo was achieved utilizing [125I]-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol, a potent beta-adrenergic blocker with high affinity and specificity for those receptors. In normal muscle the beta-adrenergic receptors were localized mainly to blood vessels, arterioles greater than venules, with much less concentration of grains over the fascicles of muscle fibers. One week after denervation there was an increase in binding both to blood vessels and muscle fibers, more so in soleus and gactrocnemius than in extensor digitorum longus. While these results parallel in vitro biochemical studies, they dictate caution when inferring cellular localization of beta-adrenergic receptors (and other molecules) solely on the basis of biochemical techniques applied to subcellular fractions of whole-organ homogenates.", 
    "25": "Although propranolol and furosemide are used together for hypertension, the effects of furosemide on plasma levels and beta-blocking action of propranolol are not known. Ten healthy subjects received propranolol 40 mg orally; the mean plasma propranolol levels in 60, 90, 180, and 300 min were 85 +/- 16, 90 +/- 7, 82 +/- 8, and 58 +/- 8 ng/ml. Propranolol was then given together with furosemide (25 mg orally) and the propranolol blood level was measured. Mean propranolol plasma levels were 106 +/- 11 ng/ml at 60 min, 120 +/- 12 ng/ml at 90 min (p less than 0.01), 102 +/- 8 ng/ml at 180 min (p less than 0.05), and 78 +/- 8 ng/ml at 300 min (p less than 0.01). Six additional subjects were given an infusion of 1 microgram/min isoproterenol increased by 0.5 microgram/min every 2 min until the heart rate rose by 25% after oral administration of furosemide 25 mg. This procedure was repeated after propranolol (40 mg orally) and propranolol with furosemide (25 mg orally). The amount of isoproterenol which raised the heart rate by 25% was 2.6 +/- 0.3 micrograms after furosemide alone and 17.7 +/- 2 micrograms after propranolol (p less than 0.01). After propranolol with furosemide the dose of isoproterenol required to elevate heart rate by 25% was 109 +/- 15 micrograms (p less than 0.001).", 
    "26": "The aims of this study were to describe the pharmacokinetics of propranolol in the cat, to compare pharmacokinetic parameters for propranolol in the cat with those of four other species and to apply the two-step infusion method of Wagner (Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 16, 691-700, 1974) in order to attain a rapid steady-state level for propranolol in plasma. Seven healthy adult cats received propranolol either as an I.V. bolus or by the two-step I.V. infusion method. The latter method was very effective in rapidly attaining and maintaining steady-state plasma propranolol levels. Pharmacokinetic parameters for propranolol in the cat are as follows: plasma clearance, 31.3 ml/(kg x min); volume of distribution, 1.57 L/kg; elimination half-life, 35 min. When compared with other species, the order of plasma clearances for propranolol were: rat greater than dog greater than cat greater than man greater than monkey. A plot of total area under the plasma propranolol concentration-time curve versus dose was not linear at the lower doses, but was linear at doses greater than 0.242 mg/kg.", 
    "27": "Clonidine (10-40 microgram/kg) produced a dose-dependent reduction of fear as measured by the potentiated startle effect (increased acoustic startle in the presence of a cue which had been previously paired with shock). The reduction of potential startle could not be accounted for entirely by a general depressant effect of clonidine on startle nor by an acceleration of extinction. Piperoxane and yohimbine, which are associated with anxiety in humans, increased potentiated startle, whereas propranolol and WB-4101 did not. These results provide further evidence that the potentiated startle paradigm in the rat is sensitive to drug that alter anxiety in humans. Moreover, they support the hypothesis that norepinephrine transmission is important for the expression of fear or anxiety.", 
    "28": "Fifty-four patients with variant angina are described. They are divided into patients without hemodynamically (less than 50%) important coronary artery lesions (Group 1), patients with intermediate (greater than or equal to 50% and less than 90%) fixed obstruction (Group 2A), and patients with high grade (greater than or equal to 90%) fixed obstruction (Group 2B). Inferior ischemia occurred significantly more often in Group 1 (90% versus 33%. p less than 0.001), and exertional angina was more frequent in Group 2 (70% versus 36%, p less than 0.05). Maximum medical therapy with propranolol and nitrates failed to control angina in 55% of Group 1, 69% of Group 2A, and 63% of Group 2B. Twelve patients underwent intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP), and in 10 there was complete control of variant angina. A total of 35 Group I patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with a 2.9% mortality rate in patients without preoperative cardiogenic shock. Of these patients, 55% in Group 2A and 73% in Group 2B experienced marked improvement in their angina status. Therefore, we currently recommend bypass grafting for medically intractable variant angina in those patients with severely stenotic, fixed atherosclerotic lesions.", 
    "29": "We developed a new beta-adrenergic blocking, antiarrhythmic compound S-596 and compared the findings with those of propranolol or practolol. S-596 antagonized the positive chronotropic and inotropic actions of adrenaline in isolated guinea-pig atria, and blocked the relaxant response to adrenaline of isolated guinea pig tracheal strips. In anesthetized mongrel dogs, S-596 given intravenously inhibited increases in heart rate and myocardial contractile force and decreases in systemic blood pressure induced by isoproterenol. In conscious dogs, the oral administration of S-596 reduced the isoproterenol induced tachycardia and the maximal effect was attained one hour after administration. In this regard S-596 was about 5 times more potent than propranolol, and S-596 was significantly longer-acting than propranolol. Thus, S-596 has greater beta-blocking activity than propranolol. S-596 has a lesser degree of myocardial depressant action than propranolol in spontaneously contracting rat or guinea pig atria and no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity in reserpinized rats. S-596 also has a weaker local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic activity than propranolol, as determined in guinea pigs and rabbits.", 
    "30": "Oxygen uptake and amylase output in rat submandibular gland slices were measured by utilizing adrenergic agonists. Adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoproterenol significantly stimulated the oxygen uptake and amylase output. In the presence of propranolol or phenoxybenzamine, adrenaline-stimulated oxygen uptake was obviously blocked. Adrenaline-stimulated amylase output was inhibited by propranolol, but was not inhibited by phenoxybenzamine. The increase in oxygen uptake by nornol-stimulated oxygen uptake and amylase output were strongly inhibited by propranolol. The oxygen uptake due to isoproterenol was little affected by phenoxybenzamine. These results suggest that the increase in oxygen uptake seen with adrenergic agonists is mediated by both alpha- and beta-receptors, and that the amylase output is evoked through the stimulation of beta-receptors.", 
    "31": "Two atopic subjects with previously trivial asthma developed severe wheezing after receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents. These drugs were discontinued but severe airways obstruction was still present more than 18 months later.", 
    "32": "Dynamic adaptation of cardiac activity to respond to various physiological and pathological situations involves the autonomic nervous systems by means of negative feed-back. Beta-blocking drugs are very effective in changing cardiocirculatory regulation equilibria by altering the intensity of the negative feed-back mechanism, or by converting positive feed-back into negative feed-back. A strict and specific indication for the use of these powerful drugs is therefore required. Treatment should also take the form of courses, and be limited in terms of time wherever possible.", 
    "33": "A double-blind cross-over study was undertaken to compare the effects of ordinary metoprolol tablets (tablets) 0.1 g b.i.d. and metoprolol slow-release tablets (Durules) 0.2 g once daily in 16 patients with angina pectoris. Initially, the patients were treated with placebo for 2 weeks, and then during the cross-over periods with either 1 tablet morning and evening or 1 Durules in the morning and 1 placebo in the evening. Standardized bicycle ergometer exercise tests with heart rate and blood pressure measurements were performed 2 hours after placebo, 2 hours after tablets and Durules, 12 hours after tablets and 24 hours after Durules. The patients kept diaries of their anginal attacks throughout the study. There were no statistically significant differences in total work between tablets and Durules when the values at 12 hours and 24 hours were compared. However, total work was significantly greater at 2 hours and at 12 hours after tablets and 24 hours after Durules than after placebo. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure during exercise were significantly decreased 24 hours after Durules compared to placebo. The heart rate was, however, lower 12 hours after tablets than 24 hours after Durules (p less than 0.05), although this slight difference in the degree of beta-blockade did not seem to be of clinical importance in these patients.", 
    "34": "The effects of acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, on the systolic blood pressure and heart rate were investigated in conscious Kyoto Wistar normotensive rats (WKY), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and DOCA-NaCl hypertensive rats (DOCA rats) and the results compared with those of propranolol and practolol. In WKY and DOCA rats, the intraperitoneal administration of acebutolol, propranolol and practolol (0.5 approximately 20 mg/kg) produced a hypotensive action, however, these effects were observed only with restricted doses and there was no evidence of a dose-dependency. The heart rate was decreased by acebutolol and propranolol, but was increased by practolol which possesses an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. In SHR, propranolol produced a dual action, a slight rise followed by a slight fall, the change not being significant, while practolol induced a slight hypertension. On the other hand, acebutolol in high doses induced a dose-dependent hypotensive action. The heart rate was markedly and dose-dependently decreased by these three agents. Thus, while propranolol and practolol produced hypotensive effects in WKY and DOCA rats, acebutolol produced hypotensive effects in WKY, SHR and DOCA rats. These results suggest that acebutolol is a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent which possesses hypotensive activity in hypertensive rats.", 
    "35": "Interactions of (+/-)-propranolol HCl with various narcotics were determined in albino rats. The 24-h intraperitoneal (i.p.) LD50 of morphine sulfate + saline was 15--16 times greater than for morphine + propranolol in both sexes although morphine was nearly twice as toxic to males as to females. The potency ratios for LD50's with saline vs. with propranolol were: codeine, 1.9, (+/-)-methadone, 6.0; (-)-alpha-acetylmethadol, 2.8 (72 h). The toxicity of levorphanol also was greatly increased with propranolol, but the dose-effect relationship showed non-parallelism vs. levorphanol + saline. Albino mice and mongrel dogs also showed synergism between morphine and propranolol. Mortality after morphine and propranolol was antagonized by naloxone or naltrexone in rats and mice. The potency ratio in rats for morphine + saline vs. morphine + practolol was 3.5. However, the synergism between propranolol and the narcotics probably was unrelated to beta-adrenergic blocking effects of propranolol because of the apparent equivalence of (+)-, (-)- and (+/-)-propranolol in rats for synergism with morphine.", 
    "36": "Age-related changes in cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate levels in response to norepinephrine (NE) in the rectum of postnatal rats and the localization of cyclic AMP in the rectum were studied. During the first 2 weeks after birth, the basal levels of cyclic AMP were high, NE responses to cyclic AMP contents were minimal and thereafter, the basal cyclic AMP levels rapidly declined, while NE response significantly increased compared to those seen in tissues from adult rats. Furthermore, cyclic AMP immunofluorescence was visualized in smooth muscle and postganglionic neurons of the myenteric plexus. NE application produced an increase of cyclic AMP immunofluorescence in smooth muscle. These results indicate that NE response to cyclic AMP levels in rat rectum is age-dependent and suggest that the majority of beta-adrenoceptors associated with cyclic AMP generating system are localized in the smooth muscle of rat rectum.", 
    "37": "The plasma levels and the beta-blocking effect of metoprolol and its active metabolite alpha-hydroxymetoprolol have been studied after i.v. bolus injections of the substances to dogs. For both substances the beta-blockade increased with the dose, and there was a linear relationship between percent reduction in exercise heart rate and the logarithm of plasma concentration. The dose of the metabolite, however, had to be 5 times higher than that of metoprolol to induce the same degree of beta-blockade. Because of differences in the volume of distribution, 2.0 liters/kg for alpha-OH-metoprolol and 3.5 liters/kg for metoprolol, the 5 times higher dose of alpha-OH-metoprolol resulted in 10 times higher plasma levels of the metabolite than of metoprolol. alpha-OH-Metoprolol was more slowly eliminated (t1/2 approximately 7.0 hr, total body clearance approximately 3.5 ml-kg-1-min-1) than metoprolol (t 1/2 approximately 2.0 hr, total body clearance approximately 20.0 ml-kg-1-min-1). Approximately 5% of an i.v. dose of metoprolol was metabolized to alpha-OH-metoprolol. The half-life of the endogenously formed metabolite was the same as after an i.v. dose of the compound.", 
    "38": "H80/62, recently introduced as a beta 1-selective adrenoceptor agonist, caused a long-lasting flow of saliva from parotid and submaxillary glands of the rat. The effect of H80/62 was prevented by propranolol or a beta 1-selective blocker. The drug did not exert its effect via the sympathetic postganglionic nerves; and it was not taken up by the neuronal amine pump. Sympathetically decentralized or denervated glands acquired a supersensitivity of the postjunctional type to H80/62.", 
    "39": "In isolated perfused guinea-pig hearts, digoxin produced a concentration dependent release of creatine kinase (ATP-creatine-transphosphorylase; CK). A corresponding decrease of the CK activity in the myocardium was obtained. The enzyme release seems to be a sign of glycoside intoxication, as its extent paralleled the severity of digoxin induced arrhythmias. Especially high CK activities were liberated when ventricular fibrillation occurred. Likewise, electrically induced fibrillation, in control hearts, led to enzyme release. However, the digoxin effect was not matched. Reserpine pretreatment antagonized the CK release by electrical fibrillation, whereas it increased excessively the enzyme liberating effect of higher digoxin concentrations. Also, propranolol decreased the enzyme release due to electrical fibrillation. The glycoside induced CK liberation, however, was not diminished, although the ventricular fibrillation was prevented. Increase of the potassium concentration of the perfusion fluid prevented the glycoside induced fibrillation, and reduced the enzyme release. The significance of the enzyme loss from the myocardium, and the mechanisms of enzyme release are discussed.", 
    "40": "Several 1-(4-substituted phenoxyl)-2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropanes and 1-(4-substituted phenoxy)-2-hydroxy-3-[3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl]aminopropanes were synthesized for possible beta-adrenergic receptor blockage. The compounds were synthesized by reaction of the 4-substituted phenol with epichlorohydrin and subsequent opening of the resulting epoxide with either N-isopropylamine or N-3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine. Preliminary biological testing indicated a decrease in the beta-blocking potency and the duration of action.", 
    "41": "Intravenous infusions of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) at doses of 20, 40 or 80 micrograms/kg min-1 for 30 min produced dose-related decrements in blood pressure in conscious rats fitted with indwelling aortic and vena caval catheters. Immediately upon termination of SNP infusions, blood pressure rebounded to levels which were significantly above pre-SNP control values. The following evidence indicates that the rebound increase in blood pressure was due to increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system: (1) plasma renin activity was increased approximately four-fold by SNP, (2) rebound did not occur in nephrectomized rats, (3) rebound was markedly attenuated in animals treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ14225, (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline) and (4) beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol reduced the rebound response. In addition, the magnitude of the rebound following SNP infusions was directly related to the dose of SNP infused. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that renin accumulates during SNP infusion more rapidly than it is metabolized. Consequently, the accumulated renin elicits a hypertensive response when SNP treatment is withdrawn.", 
    "42": "1. The cardiovascular responses to handgrip exercise have been studied in ten patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension in a randomized crossover study of propranolol and prazosin. 2. Isometric handgrip exercise was performed with a calibrated strain gauge dynamometer at 30% of maximum voluntary contraction for 3 min. 3. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured in the supine position at rest and in the last 10 s of the exercise period. 4. These exercise studies were undertaken at the end of a run-in period and at the end of 1 month's optimal therapy with the two drugs. 5. The active treatment periods were separated by a 2 weeks placebo washout period. 6. Both drugs lowered the supine and standing systolic and diastolic pressures and there was no difference between these drugs in their effect on these variables. 7. Propranolol lowered the resting heart rate and neither drug suppressed the pressor response to isometric exercise. 8. The degree of pressure rise was similar with both drugs but propranolol suppressed isometric exercise-induced tachycardia.", 
    "43": "pA2 values for atenolol (beta 1-selective) and alpha-methylpropranolol (beta 2-selective) have been determined on isolated atria of cat and guinea-pig using noradrenaline (beta 1-selective) and fenoterol (beta 2-selective) as agonists. On guinea-pig atria, the pA2 values did not vary with the agonist used. On cat atria the pA2 for atenolol was greater with noradrenaline than with fenoterol and the pA2 for alpha-methylpropranolol was greater with fenoterol than with noradrenaline. Fenoterol was 20 times more potent on cat than on guinea-pig atria whereas noradrenaline was approximately equipotent in the two species. The results have been intrepreted as suggsesting that both cat and guinea-pig atria contain one receptor type in common (beta 1) but that only cat atria contain beta 2-adrenoceptors as well."
