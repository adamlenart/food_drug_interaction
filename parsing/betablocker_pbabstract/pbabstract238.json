An ultrasonic standing wave trap (USWT) can hold small particles in a medium-flowing system. This study investigated the conditions for holding HepG2 spheroids in an USWT and its relevance to use in toxicity testing. It can take many hours to reach a detectable end point of cell damage in a standard cellular in vitro toxicant assay and the process might be accelerated through increased sample flow past the spheroid. A USWT was employed here to levitate and hold HepG2 spheroids stationary against a flow of 3 mm s(-1) when the acoustic pressure amplitude is 1.9 MPa. The ultrasonic drive frequency was 1.64 MHz. Acoustic microstreaming in the standing wave chamber generated 1 mm s(-1) flow past a levitated spheroid-scale (80 microm diameter) latex particle in the absence of sample through-flow. The conditions required to form aggregates of cells of a HepG2 cell line in a single half wavelength ultrasonic standing wave mini-chambers are also described here. It is argued that the manipulation capabilities demonstrated may have potential in increasing the efficiency of in vitro toxicant detection by spheroids. Preliminary, visual (unquantified) fluorescence microscopy observations of spheroids levitated in the standing wave in the presence of the toxicant DL-propranolol do suggest accelerated loss of viability compared with controls.", 
    "1": "The aim of the present study was to investigate body fat-suppressive effects of green tea in rats fed on a high-fat diet and to determine whether the effect is associated with beta-adrenoceptor activation of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. Feeding a high-fat diet containing water extract of green tea at the concentration of 20g/kg diet prevented the increase in body fat gain caused by high-fat diet without affecting energy intake. Energy expenditure was increased by green tea extract which was associated with an increase in protein content of interscapular brown adipose tissue. The simultaneous administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol(500 mg/kg diet) inhibited the body fat-suppressive effect of green tea extract. Propranolol also prevented the increase in protein content of interscapular brown adipose tissue caused by green tea extract. Digestibility was slightly reduced by green tea extract and this effect was not affected by propranolol. Therefore it appeared that green tea exerts potent body fat-suppressive effects in rats fed on a high-fat diet and the effect was resulted in part from reduction in digestibility and to much greater extent from increase in brown adipose tissue thermogenesis through beta-adrenoceptor activation.",

    "3": "To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topiramate as adjunctive prophylactic therapy for migraine.", 
    "4": "A prospective trial involving patients with more than 3 migraine attacks per month was performed. Patients continued their usual prophylactic treatment. Baseline analgesic use and frequency and duration of migraine attacks were recorded. A 4-point visual analog scale evaluated severity. Laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were performed before study entry. After informed consent was obtained, patients were instructed to take 25 mg of topiramate per day, with 25- to 50-mg weekly increments to a maximum of 100 mg per day. Safety was assessed at the first month; tolerability and efficacy were assessed every week for the first month and then every month for 3 months. Effectiveness was assessed by comparing baseline and on-treatment migraine status, and data were analyzed by the Fisher exact test.", 
    "5": "Twenty-five women and 11 men (mean age, 44 years) were evaluated. Existing prophylactic treatment was either propranolol or flunarizine (or both) in 80% of the patients. At 3 months of therapy with topiramate, headache frequency decreased from 17 to 3 episodes per month, headache duration from 559 to 32 minutes, and intensity from 9 to 1 by visual analog scale (P <.001). Improvement in frequency and severity of migraine was observed in 83% of patients. Slight or no changes in headache were observed in 6 patients. Tolerability was good in 30 patients. The most common side effects were acroparesthesias, weight loss, sleepiness, and headache worsening. No adverse interaction with propranolol or flunarizine was observed.", 
    "6": "These results suggest that topiramate is efficacious and safe as an adjunctive treatment in patients with migraine whose prior response to prophylactic management has been less than satisfactory.",

    "8": "A cross-section study was conducted by six hospitals in Sichuan Province. The prevalence and severity of sexual dysfunction were assessed by SCASF microsoft among patients with chronic renal disease. Logistic regression was used to examine and test the association between sexual dysfunction and other medical conditions.", 
    "9": "The prevalence of sexual dysfunction was wider in patients with CRI than in those without. The main manifestations in male patients were decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. Stratified analysis in uremia showed that the prevalence and severity of sexual dysfunction were similar between patients on haemodialysis(HD) and those on peritoneal dialysis(PD). The patients receiving no replacement treatment suffered more decreased libido and performance anxiety than dialyzed patients (HD and PD) and transplantation patients(Tx). The patients receiving no replacement treatment and dialysis suffered more erectile dysfunction than Tx men. A multivariable analysis demonstrated that the duration, creatinine clearance(Ccr), parathyroid hormone (PTH), albumin(Alb) were not associated with sexual dysfunction. The use of beta-blocker, anemia and depression were risky factors for decreased libido, and increasing age was a risky factor for erectile dysfunction. The use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor(ACEI)/angiotention receptor antagonist (ARB) and recombinant human erythropoietin(r-HuEpo) were protective factors for erectile dysfunction.", 
    "10": "The main manifestations of sexual dysfunction in male patients with CRI are decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. The replacement therapy, especially transplantation, can decrease the prevalence or severity of sexual dysfunction.

    "11": "We have evaluated the safety and efficacy of routine beta-blockade for the prevention of cardiac complications in a comprehensive series of patients undergoing major vascular surgery and amputation for atherosclerotic arterial disease. From 1 December 2001 to 31 May 2002, patients received perioperative beta-blockade by atenolol. Outcomes in this period were compared to the immediately antecedent 6 months. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of cardiac complications. Fifty-three patients underwent surgery in the first period and 54 in the second. After introduction of routine beta-blockade, only one patient suffered cardiac complications compared to 10 in the first period (P=0.01). There were eight deaths in the first and two in the second period (P=0.052). On multivariate analysis, treatment with beta-blockers was the only variable significantly associated with a decrease in cardiac morbidity (OR=0.12; 95% CI=0.002-0.66; P=0.014). Two patients suffered bronchospasm leading to discontinuation of atenolol. Routine perioperative beta-blockade was safe and reduced the occurrence of cardiac complications after vascular surgery.",

The ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight (LVW/BW), mRNA expressions of calcium handling proteins and endothelin receptors were determined. The alterations of maximum binding capacity (Bmax) and equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values of cardiac endothelin receptors (ETR) and its subtypes were detected.", 
    "14": "Compared with those of normal control, blood pressure, and LVW/BW in the DCM rats were elevated. Sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) mRNA expression and SERCA activity decreased in the left ventricle. The ETR Bmax decreased, especially the endothelin receptor A. Endothelin converting enzyme activity and expression were elevated, and mRNA expressions of beta1-adrenoreceptor and inositol-3-phosphate receptor in some hearts increased as well. The administration of perindopril and bisoprolol could reverse myocardial hypertrophy and restore the imbalance of calcium handling proteins and endothelin system.",

    "16": "Heart failure is a common, costly, and generally fatal condition that most often results from coronary artery disease or hypertension. All patients with heart failure need education about the importance of sodium restriction and daily weight monitoring. Most patients with heart failure require combination therapy that includes a diuretic, an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and digoxin. Selected patients may benefit from alternative or additional medications, such as anticoagulants in individuals with atrial fibrillation or ARBs in those who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitor therapy. Investigational medications and devices for heart failure are under active study.", 
    "17": "The antihypertensive drug classes that have reduced cardiovascular events safely either in large placebo-controlled trials or in comparison with other effective antihypertensive drugs in large morbidity trials are diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Although control of blood pressure (BP) is a primary goal of therapy, evidence from several clinical trials suggests that certain antihypertensive agents provide clinical benefits independent of their effect on BP. In the recently reported Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), an ACE inhibitor, a CCB, and an alpha-blocker reduced coronary events and mortality to a similar extent as a thiazide-type diuretic, but the diuretic reduced one or more major cardiovascular events, especially heart failure, more than the other agents. In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) trial, the ARB losartan reduced cardiovascular morbidity (primarily stroke) more than the beta-blocker atenolol. Although an ARB has not yet been compared with a diuretic in a morbidity trial, as most patients require more than one drug to control BP, and a diuretic plus an ARB is a very effective and well-tolerated combination, this uncertainty applies to a minority of patients. A primary goal in treating hypertension should be to reach a patient's goal BP, but initial selection of drugs based on hypertension morbidity study results and other compelling indications should be given priority.", 
    "18": "Previous studies demonstrate that indirect activation of monoamine receptors by antidepressant treatment increases neurotrophic factors that activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade; however, it is also possible that these monoamine receptors influence the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway independent of neurotrophic factors. The influence of norepinephrine on the phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated protein kinase is characterized.", 
    "19": "Primary cerebral cortical cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 rat brains and were subsequently incubated with norepinephrine in the absence or presence of agents acting as noradrenergic receptors or as intracellular signaling proteins. Levels of phosphorylated extracellular-regulated protein kinase were determined by immunoblot.", 
    "20": "The results demonstrate that incubation with norepinephrine produces a time- and dose-dependent activation of phosphorylated extracellular-regulated protein kinase and that this increase is dependent on activation of alpha(2)- and beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes. In addition, the results demonstrate that norepinephrine activation of phosphorylated extracellular-regulated protein kinase is dependent on a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, a receptor tyrosine kinase, and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.", 
    "21": "The findings suggest that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by norepinephrine can occur via a tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathway but independent of classical second-messenger or Src-dependent kinases.", 
    "22": "Tracheal epinephrine (adrenaline) has been associated with two major deletorious side effects: increased heart rate (HR) and an initial decrease of blood pressure (BP). This prospective randomized animal study compared the haemodynamic responses to tracheally administered epinephrine or norepinephrine (nor adrenaline) alone versus each after pretreatment with propranolol for ameliorating those two untoward effects associated with epinephrine administration. Five anaesthetized mongrel dogs underwent 25 experiments of tracheal epinephrine or norepinephrine (0.02 mg/kg diluted with normal saline to 5 ml total volume) with or without an I/V non-selective beta-blocker (propranolol 0.1 mg/kg) pretreatment, and served as their own controls. Tracheal epinephrine alone produced a rise in both diastolic and mean arterial BP and an increase of HR. Tracheal norepinephrine alone produced the largest increase of diastolic and mean BP but this change was associated with a significant tachycardia (from 37 to 72/m, P<0.001). While both epinephrine or norepinephrine after pretreatment with propranolol produced a significant increase in both diastolic (from 106 to 166 mmHg and from 118 to 169 mmHg, respectively) (P<0.01) and mean BP (from 122 to 183 mmHg and from 133 to 188 mmHg, respectively) (P<0.01), only propranolol-pretreated tracheal epinephrine yielded a significant decrease in HR (from 52 to 33/m, P=0.002). Pretreatment with a beta-blocker protected against the deleterious tachycardia associated with epinephrine or norepinephrine and, by doing so, may improve the myocardial oxygen supply-and-demand balance. At the same time, the pretreatment augmented the relatively mild diastolic BP increase associated with the beta-adrenergic effect of epinephrine.", 
    "23": "Both alpha1- and beta-adrenergic agonists increase the severity of global myocardial ischemic injury. We hypothesized that combined beta- and alpha1-adrenergic blockade would improve initial resuscitation and postresuscitation myocardial and neurological functions. We further hypothesized that the resulting alpha2-actions of relatively brief duration would favor improved functions compared with the more prolonged effect of nonadrenergic vasopressin.", 
    "24": "Three groups of 5 male domestic pigs weighing 37+/-3 kg were investigated. Ventricular fibrillation was untreated for 7 minutes before the start of precordial compression, mechanical ventilation, and attempted defibrillation. Animals were randomized to receive central venous injections of equipressor doses of (1) epinephrine, (2) epinephrine in which both alpha1- and beta-adrenergic effects were blocked by previous administration of prazosin and propranolol, and (3) vasopressin during CPR. All but 1 animal were successfully resuscitated. After injection of epinephrine, significantly better cardiac output and fractional area change, together with lesser increases in troponin I, were observed after alpha1- and beta-adrenergic blockade. Postresuscitation neurological function was also improved after alpha1- and beta-block in comparison with unblocked epinephrine and after vasopressin.", 
    "25": "Equipressor doses of epinephrine, epinephrine after alpha1- and beta-adrenergic blockade, and vasopressin were equally effective in restoring spontaneous circulation after prolonged ventricular fibrillation. However, combined alpha1- and beta-adrenergic blockade, which represented a predominantly selective alpha2-vasopressor effect, resulted in improved postresuscitation cardiac and neurological recovery.", 
    "26": "Arrhythmia risk stratification with regard to prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy is a completely unsolved issue in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).", 
    "27": "Arrhythmia risk stratification was performed prospectively in 343 patients with IDC, including analysis of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and size by echocardiography, signal-averaged ECG, arrhythmias on Holter ECG, QTc dispersion, heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and microvolt T-wave alternans. During 52+/-21 months of follow-up, major arrhythmic events, defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or sudden death, occurred in 46 patients (13%). On multivariate analysis, LV ejection fraction was the only significant arrhythmia risk predictor in patients with sinus rhythm, with a relative risk of 2.3 per 10% decrease of ejection fraction (95% CI, 1.5 to 3.3; P=0.0001). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter was associated with a trend toward higher arrhythmia risk (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9 to 3.3; P=0.11), whereas beta-blocker therapy was associated with a trend toward lower arrhythmia risk (RR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.2; P=0.13). In patients with atrial fibrillation, multivariate Cox analysis also identified LV ejection fraction and absence of beta-blocker therapy as the only significant arrhythmia risk predictors.", 
    "28": "Reduced LV ejection fraction and lack of beta-blocker use are important arrhythmia risk predictors in IDC, whereas signal-averaged ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, and T-wave alternans do not seem to be helpful for arrhythmia risk stratification. These findings have important implications for the design of future studies evaluating prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in IDC.", 
    "29": "Although beta-adrenergic receptor (AR) blockade therapy is beneficial in the treatment of heart failure, little is known regarding the transcriptional mechanisms underlying this salutary action.", 
    "30": "In the present study, we screened mice overexpressing Gsalpha, beta1AR, beta2AR, or protein kinase A to test if a common genomic pathway exists in different models with enhanced beta-adrenergic signaling. In mice overexpressing Gsalpha, differentially expressed genes were identified by mRNA profiling. In addition to well-known markers of cardiac hypertrophy (atrial natriuretic factor, CARP, and beta-myosin heavy chain), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a protein involved in the control of mitochondrial membrane potential, and four-and-a-half LIM domain protein-1 (FHL1), a member of the LIM protein family, were predicted to be upregulated. Upregulation of these genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction at all time points tested during the development of cardiomyopathy in mice overexpressing Gsalpha. In mice overexpressing beta1AR, beta2AR, or protein kinase A, increased UCP2 and FHL1 expression was also observed at the onset of cardiomyopathy. BetaAR blockade treatment reversed the cardiomyopathy and suppressed the increased expression of UCP2 and FHL1 in mice overexpressing Gsalpha.", 
    "31": "UCP2 and FHL1 are important candidate genes that correlate with the development of betaAR-induced cardiomyopathy in different mouse models with enhanced betaAR signaling. In addition to preserving cardiac function, betaAR blockade treatment also prevents the genomic regulation that correlates with the onset of heart failure.", 
    "32": "5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) has been postulated to play a proarrhythmic role in the human atria via stimulation of 5-HT4 receptors. The aims of this study were to examine the effects of 5-HT on the L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL) action potential duration (APD), the effective refractory period (ERP) and arrhythmic activity in human atrial cells, and to assess the effects of prior treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Isolated myocytes, from the right atrial appendage of 27 consenting patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were in sinus rhythm, were studied using the whole-cell perforated patch-clamp technique at 37 degrees C. 5-HT (1 nm-10 microm) caused a concentration-dependent increase in ICaL, which was potentiated in cells from beta-blocked (maximum response to 5-HT, Emax=299+/-12% increase above control) compared to non-beta-blocked patients (Emax=220+/-6%, P<0.05), but with no change in either the potency (log EC50: -7.09+/-0.07 vs -7.26+/-0.06) or Hill coefficient (nH: 1.5+/-0.6 vs 1.5+/-0.3) of the 5-HT concentration-response curve. 5-HT (10 microm) produced a greater increase in the APD at 50% repolarisation (APD50) in cells from beta-blocked patients (of 37+/-10 ms, i.e. 589+/-197%) vs non-beta-blocked patients (of 10+/-4 ms, i.e. 157+/-54%; P<0.05). Both the APD90 and the ERP were unaffected by 5-HT. Arrhythmic activity was observed in response to 5-HT in five of 17 cells (29%) studied from beta-blocked, compared to zero of 16 cells from the non-beta-blocked patients (P<0.05). In summary, the 5-HT-induced increase in calcium current was associated with a prolonged early plateau phase of repolarisation, but not late repolarisation or refractoriness, and the enhancement of these effects by chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade was associated with arrhythmic potential.", 
    "33": "A practical, sensitive, selective and efficient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method is reported for the determination of two commonly used antihypertensive drugs, furosemide and propranolol hydrochloride. The drugs were eluted through a Nucleosil C(18) column with a mobile phase composed of 0.02 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate and acetonitrile (80:20, v/v) adjusted to pH 4.5 and the effluent from the column was monitored at 235 nm. The present method enabled simple and isocratic HPLC with UV detection of these drugs in raw materials and in pharmaceutical formulations. These procedures were also applied for the assay of furosemide in rabbits' plasma, using propranolol hydrochloride as an internal standard. The linear concentration range of the assay was 0.1-200 and 5-200 microg ml(-1) for furosemide and propranolol hydrochloride, respectively. The inter and intra-day assay precision and accuracy showed reproducibility and good linearity (r(2)>0.99). The method retained its accuracy and precision when applying the standard addition technique. The results obtained by applying the proposed method was statistically analysed and compared with those obtained by the reported methods.",

More than 50% of the hypertensive patients with heart disease (heart failure, ischemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation) showed values of systolic blood pressure which are equal or greater than 140 mmHg. 90% of the patients with ischemic cardiopathy showed values of LDL cholesterol higher than 100 mg/dl and 65% higher than 130 mg/dl. 54.8% of the patients with heart failure was receiving treatment with an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme; 27.2% of the patients with ischemic cardiopathy received treatment with a beta-blocker, and 32% of the patients with atrial fibrillation received anticoagulants.", 
    "37": "The heart failure, the ischemic cardiopathy, and the atrial fibrillation are associated with great frequency to hypertension. Control of the blood pressure in the hypertensive patients with heart disease is very limited. The utilization of drugs of obligatory use in hypertensives with heart disease is limited.

    "38": "In conditioned taste aversion (CTA), a subject learns to associate a novel taste (conditioned stimulus, CS) with visceral malaise (unconditioned stimulus, US). Considerable evidence indicates that the noradrenergic system in the amygdala plays an important role in memory consolidation for emotionally arousing experiences. The specific aim of the present set of experiments was to determine the involvement of noradrenergic activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during the US presentation and consolidation of CTA as well as during the consolidation of a nonaversive/incidental gustatory memory. Selective bilateral microinfusions of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol administered into the BLA immediately before intraperitoneal (i.p.) lithium chloride (LiCl) injections disrupted CTA memory. Additionally, propranolol infused into the BLA immediately after a pre-exposure to the saccharin (CS) significantly attenuated latent inhibition. The present findings indicating that alterations in noradrenergic function in the BLA affect taste memory formation, provide additional evidence that the BLA plays a critical role in modulating the consolidation of memory and that the influence is mediated by interactions with other brain regions that support memory for different kinds of experiences.",

Apical and basal sides of the chamber were filled with buffer solutions. Drugs were applied to the apical side as powder, suspension, or solution, and then, the permeated amounts into the basal side were monitored for 2 h. At the same time, dissolved amounts of drugs at the apical side were detected. The amount of drug applied to the D/P system was based on its in vivo clinical dose.",

Drug claims and physician diagnoses were used to determine the prevalence of the following contraindications to the use of beta-blockers (including warnings and precautions): asthma or chronic bronchitis, diabetes, dysrhythmia and heart failure, all in the year preceding the initiation of therapy; or use of systemic beta-blockers at the time glaucoma therapy was started. The observation period was divided into 2 phases: the time during which newer agents were on the restricted-drug list (first-line use being limited to patients with contraindications to the use of beta-blockers; January 1997 to March 1999) and the time during which these agents were on the generally available drug list (that is, after reimbursement restrictions were relaxed; April 1999 to June 2000).",

(4) Patients using the timolol + latanoprost combination are exposed to the adverse effects of both latanoprost (especially ocular irritation and brown iris discoloration) and the betablocker. (5) It is not known whether the once-a-day dosing of the timolol + latanoprost combination is a significant advantage, especially in terms of adherence to treatment.

The mean age of study population was 7.6 +/- 4.2 years, 45 percent being females. The mean duration of follow-up under therapy was 5.2 +/- 2.5 years. Among the patients with intrahepatic portal hypertension, 29 received propranolol + sclerotherapy, 12 received only propranolol and 5 received only sclerotherapy. There was no significant decrease in bleeding episodes during propranolol or sclerotherapy. However patients under propranolol + sclerotherapy, showed significant decrease in bleeding episodes during therapy (23/29 before therapy, 15/29 during therapy, p < 0.05). Rebleeding index in patients with IHPH was significantly long in the group treated by propranolol + sclerotherapy (p = 0.0001) compared with before therapy. Because the numbers of patients in the groups are small, Kaplan Meier estimation suggest that propranol treatment is more effective. But there isn't significant difference when the results were compared with those of before therapy, except in the combined treatment group.",

Under a long-term administration of a beta-adrenoblocking agent no suppression has been seen of the contractile capability of the myocardium; there is noted an improvement in hemorheologic disturbances and a significantly greater improvement in the clinical course of the illness--it has been found out the therapy prevents transformation of angina of high effort to angina of low effort.",

A total of 47 patients (27 men and 20 women) with functional class II-III ChCI by the classification of the New-York Association of Cardiologists and the left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% were examined. The use of betaxolol in the conventional therapy of ChCI has been shown to be of significant clinical benefit in the above patient population, with the improvement in hemodynamic status, the functional class exercise-induces angina alleviated, the left ventricular ejection fraction significantly became greater.

    "62": "A promising development in tumor therapy is the application of non-toxic prodrugs from which the active cytostatic is released by endogenous enzymes such as beta-glucuronidase (beta-gluc). Regulation of beta-gluc expression is one crucial factor modulating bioactivation of prodrugs. Recent experiments in rats indicate regulation of beta-gluc activity by the calcium channel blocker verapamil. To further explore this phenomenon, we investigated the effect of verapamil on beta-gluc enzyme activity, protein (western blot) and mRNA expression (RT-PCR) as well as the underlying mechanisms (effects of verapamil metabolites; promoter activity) in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Treatment of HepG2 cells with verapamil revealed down-regulation of beta-gluc activity, protein, and mRNA level down to 50% of the control with EC(50) values of 25 microM. Effects were similar for both enantiomers. Moreover, it was demonstrated that reduced promoter activity contributes to the observed effects. In summary, our data demonstrate regulation of human beta-glucuronidase expression by verapamil. Based on our findings we hypothesize that coadministration of verapamil may effect cleavage of glucuronides by beta-glucuronidase.", 
    "63": "Cardiac remodeling is a complex process, which involves genetic, molecular and cellular changes in cardiomyocytes and the interstitium, leading to progressive structural and functional alterations, including cardiac dilatation, interstitial fibrosis, and a reduction in contractility and relaxation. As cardiac function worsens, ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and end-stage heart disease are the ultimate consequences. Underlying mechanisms include myocardial stretch and neurohormonal and cytokine activation. Consequently, therapies aiming counteracting these mechanisms have proven successful in attenuating or even preventing cardiac remodeling. In particular, ACE inhibition, beta-blockade and aldosterone antagonism have proven to be effective in modulating the process of remodeling and in reducing the occurrence of adverse events in heart failure. Of interest, although several other antagonists of neurohormonal, including endothelin, or of cytokine activation have been shown to effectively modulate remodeling, studies thus far have been negative in terms of event reduction in heart failure. Whereas insight in cardiovascular remodeling has already significantly contributed to existing management strategies in heart failure, further studies in different mechanisms may provide additional therapeutic measures.", 
    "64": "Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a powerful neurohormonal marker of left ventricular function and prognosis. Amiodarone either has no effect or improves the haemodynamics in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, but its effect on BNP is unknown. This study evaluated the effect of amiodarone on plasma BNP level in patients with heart failure and ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Plasma BNP level was studied in 46 patients with heart failure ventricular tachyarrhythmia, before (baseline) and at week 2 and months 1, 3 and 6 of amiodarone treatment. In addition, 21 patients with heart failure and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, who received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, but not amiodarone, were studied on the same schedule. All patients had previously received potent vasodilator and beta-blocker therapy. Echocardiography and Holter monitoring were also performed. Amiodarone significantly decreased plasma BNP levels at week 2 to month 6 during therapy. Heart rates and frequencies of premature ventricular complexes were markedly reduced by amiodarone. Echocardiographic findings did not show a change in left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions, despite a slight increase in fraction shortening at month 6 during amiodarone therapy. The above parameters showed no change in patients without amiodarone. The effect of heart rate, premature ventricular complexes, fraction shortening, serum creatinine or thyroid stimulating hormone level was not significantly associated with decrease in BNP level during amiodarone therapy by a multivariate analysis. Among amiodarone-treated patients, mortality was higher in 24 with BNP levels >/=100 pg/ml at month 6 than in 22 with BNP levels <100 pg/ml during a mean follow-up period of 31 months. Amiodarone appears to have a decreasing effect on plasma BNP level, as well as an antiarrhythmic effect, in patients with heart failure and ventricular tachyarrhythmia.", 
    "65": "Post-operative atrial fibrillation is very common. It is associated with increased length of ICU and hospital stay, and costs of post-operative care of patients after cardiac surgery. More then seventy trials on the pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions were conducted since 1970's. Meta-analysis of these trials, together with detailed analysis of the largest of these trials suggested that conventional beta-blockers, sotalol, amiodarone and bi-atrial overdrive pacing are effective in prevention of post-operative atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone and bi-atrial pacing may decrease the length of hospital stay.", 
    "66": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a frequent complication of cardiac surgery. The optimal treatment strategy has not been established. Retrospective studies have suggested that a primary rate-control strategy may be equivalent to a strategy that restores sinus rhythm. Fifty patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation were randomly assigned to a strategy of antiarrhythmic therapy +/- electrical cardioversion or ventricular rate control. Anticoagulation with heparin overlapped with coumadin was administered to both arms. The primary endpoint of the study was time to conversion to sinus rhythm analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The effects of strategy on hospital length of stay was examined as well as the incidence of recurrent AF. This study demonstrated no significant difference between an antiarrhythmic conversion strategy (n = 27) and a rate-control strategy (n = 23) in time to conversion to sinus rhythm (11.2 +/- 3.2 vs. 11.8 +/- 3.9 hours; p = 0.8). With Cox multivariate analysis to control for the effects of age, sex, beta-blocker usage, and type of surgery, the conversion strategy showed a trend toward reducing the time from treatment to restoration of sinus rhythm (p = 0.08). The length of hospital stay was reduced in the antiarrhythmic arm compared with the rate-control strategy (9.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 13.2 +/- 2.0 days; p = 0.05). In hospital relapse rates in the antiarrhythmic arm were 30% compared with 57% in the rate-control strategy (p = 0.24). At the termination of the study, 91% of the patients in the rate-control arm were in sinus rhythm compared with 96% in the antiarrhythmic arm. In conclusion, this pilot study shows little difference between a rate-control strategy and a strategy to restore/maintain sinus rhythm. Regardless of the strategy, majority of patients will be in sinus rhythm after two months. A larger randomized, controlled study is needed to assess the impact of restoration of sinus rhythm on length of stay.",

    "75": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common complication of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), usually occurring on the second or third post-operative day. Post-operative AF is associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased costs. In several randomized trials, prophylactic oral beta-blocker reduced the incidence of post-operative AF. Theoretically, intravenous beta-blocker regimen with its rapid onset of action and ease of dose titration should be more efficacious than oral beta-blocker. We conducted an open-label randomized controlled pilot study, compared the efficacy of intravenous esmolol and an oral beta-blocker regimen for prevention of post-operative AF. Fifty patients at high-risk of developing post-operative AF (P wave duration >140 ms on signal averaged (SA) ECG) were randomized to either 24-hours of intravenous esmolol treatment post-CABG followed by oral beta-blocker or standard oral beta-blocker treatment. Seven (26%) out of 27 patients in the esmolol group and 6 (26%) out of 23 patients in the oral beta-blocker group developed post-operative AF (p = NS). The day of onset and duration of AF was similar between the two groups. In the esmolol group, 11 (41%) patients developed adverse effects, mostly hypotension, compared to only one patient (4%) in the oral beta-blocker group (p = 0.006). The result of this pilot study showed that intravenous esmolol compared to oral beta-blocker offers no advantage in preventing post-operative AF and is associated with increased adverse events. Thus, all patients without contraindication should receive oral beta-blocker before and after cardiac surgery to prevent post-operative AF.", 
    "76": "Atrial overdrive pacing has been commonly practiced after cardiac surgery in hopes of suppressing atrial ectopy and postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, several studies show inefficacy with AAI pacing and some suggest a potential for proarrhythmia. In a study of AAI right atrial pacing after cardiac surgery, atrial ectopy was increased with no effect on atrial fibrillation suppression. Undersensing and loss of capture were observed not infrequently. Best efficacy for prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation from other studies suggest that biatrial or Bachmann's bundle pacing, triggered mode pacing, atrial overdrive algorithms, or concomitant beta-blocker use might be more effective than single site right atrial pacing in the AAI mode. However, even with biatrial pacing, proarrhythmia has been reported, and this potential risk for increased atrial ectopy or atrial fibrillation should be recognized. Proarrhythmia may be precipitated by inappropriate sensing or loss of pacing associated with pacing through temporary wires.", 
    "77": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common complication following cardiac surgery and is associated with significant increases in postoperative morbidity, length of stay and cost of care. In a randomized study we assessed the impact of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (off-pump, n = 100), compared to conventional (on-pump, n = 100) CABG, on the frequency of postoperative AF. Arrhythmias were detected using an automated arrhythmia detector for the first 72 hours following surgery and by four hourly clinical observations thereafter. AF was defined as an irregular narrow complex rhythm (in the absence of bundle branch block) with absence of discrete P waves lasting greater then 10 minutes. There was a significant reduction in the incidence of postoperative AF in the off-pump group (11% versus 45%, P < 0.001) in addition to significant reductions in blood usage, postoperative pneumonia, inotrope requirements, and hospital and intensive care unit stay. Univariate analysis identified all these variables as risk factors for AF, however multivariate regression analysis identified CPB and cardioplegic arrest as the only independent predictor of postoperative AF (OR 7.4; 95% CI 3.4 to 17.9). This study therefore suggests that the inflammatory response to bypass, myocardial ischaemia and atrial cannulation are significant contributory factors to the development of AF following cardiac surgery. In the light of more recent trials it is apparent that this benefit may be most marked in patients with multiple perioperative risk factors for postoperative AF.", 
    "78": "The principal stakes of depression treatment are to accelerate and enhance the clinical effects of antidepressant drug. The onset of antidepressant action of Serotonin (5HT) selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was attributed in part to the decrease in firing activity of serotonin neurons produced by the activation of raphe 5HT1A autoreceptors at the time of treatment initiation. Pindolol, an antagonist at somatodendritic pre-synaptic 5HT1A receptors has been investigated as a potential accelerator or potentialisator of antidepressant response. Six open label studies and 12 controlled studies were identified for revue. The first open-label pilot study was conducted by Artigas et al. They showed promising results with pindolol, both in the acceleration of antidepressant response and in improving the efficacy of antidepressant. On the basis of these results five open-label studies were conducted. The open label studies suggest that pindolol accelerate the antidepressant response of serotoninergics therapeutics. The augmentation of antidepressant response was not clearly demonstrated by these studies particularly in the treatment of refractory depression. For example, Dinan et Scott that found the addition of pindolol in association with SSRI therapy had a poor efficacy. In the twelve controlled studies, 4 tried to underscore the shortening of the onset and the augmentation of efficacy of SSRI by pindolol [Berman et al., Maes et al., Perez et al., Tome et al. ], 3 tried to underscore shortening of the onset [Bordet, Zanardi ] and 3 tried to underscore the augmentation of efficacy [Maes et al., Moreno et al., Perez et al. ]. One study tried to underscore the augmentation of efficacy of sleep deprivation by pindolol and another one the shortening of the onset of ECT. Six studies included depressive resistant patients. Three studies were carried out with fluoxetine, 1 with fluvoxamine, 3 with paroxetine, 1 with trazodone. Two -studies were investigated with several antidepressant treatments. The results of the studies indicate one acceleration of antidepressant response in 6 studies, one augmentation of efficacy in 5 studies. Two studies clearly demonstrate that pindolol may -augment and accelerate antidepressant response. Three studies did not confirm these observations. Several points can be examined. For pindolol: 3 authors have demonstrated that the effect of pindolol did not rely upon small antidepressant effect mediated by b-blockers properties, because anxiety was not predominantly improved by pindolol plus SSRI while depressive symptoms were clearly improved. On the basis of data issues from recent positron emission tomography (PET) studies, several authors suggested that the dose of pindolol used in most clinical trials (3 yen 2,5 mg day-1) might be insufficient to induce a substantial occupancy of 5-HTA receptors (Rabiner et al. It is possible that higher doses will show a more evident benefit. On the whole, pindolol seemed to be well tolerated. Adverse effects most commonly reported were increased irritability, insomnia and nausea. Pindolol had poor adverse effects in cardiovascular functions. The variation of the results of the controlled studies can be explained by different points: Firstly by difficulty to determine good criterion of resistance. The most simplistic definition of treatment resistance is the failure to achieve and sustain euthymia with adequate antidepressant treatment. Secondly by the fact that depressive patients who present antecedents of depressive illness seem to be worst responders to the association pindolol/serotoninergic antidepressant than patients suffering of first episode of depression. We observed one antecedent of depression in the group of resistant patients who were good responders to the association pindolol/antidepressant therapy. We observed three anterior episodes of depression in negatives studies of the association pindolol/antidepressant therapy. Thirdly by the fact that the failure of the antidepressant treatment at the time of earlier (or actual) episode seems to be a criterion for less responsiveness to the association of this antidepressant treatment with pindolol. In fact, the open label studies who demonstrated efficacy of the association between pindolol and serotoninergic therapy in major resistant depression were realized with new antidepressant molecule for the episode. Other controlled trials could confirm these facts. Most of the studies failed to retrace clearly the historicity of depression, and it may be interesting in future investigations to analyze the response of the association -compared to the status of the patient with the antidepressant therapy. Further perspective could be envisaged especially in the utilization of pindolol for the treatment of pathologies which are usually treated with a serotoninergic antidepressant -therapy. For example, the antagonist 5HT(1A) Way 100635 was experimented with success in animals in order to augment the efficacy of clomipramine in the treatment of chronic pain. In other respects several psychopharmacogenetics studies could be investigated to examine, for instance, the role of the 5-HT transporter and its implication in the response to pindolol and antidepressant association. In summary, pindolol accele-rates, and in some cases enhances the clinical action of antidepressant drugs. It appears that this augmentation strategy has more limited effect on treatment resistant patient but there is experimental evidence for using higher doses in future augmentation trial.", 
    "79": "This review addresses open questions about the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in cardiac function and failure. Cardiomyocytes express all three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes-beta1, beta2, and, at least in some species, beta3. The beta1 subtype is the most prominent one and is mainly responsible for positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of catecholamines. The beta2 subtype also increases cardiac function, but its ability to activate nonclassical signaling pathways suggests a function distinct from the beta1 subtype. In heart failure, the sympathetic system is activated, cardiac beta-receptor number and function are decreased, and downstream mechanisms are altered. However, in spite of a wealth of data, we still do not know whether and to what extent these alterations are adaptive/protective or detrimental, or both. Clinically, beta-adrenergic antagonists represent the most important advance in heart failure therapy, but it is still debated whether they act by blocking or by resensitizing the beta-adrenergic receptor system. Newer experimental therapeutic strategies aim at the receptor desensitization machinery and at downstream signaling steps.", 
    "80": "The influence of the composition of soft contact lenses on the achievement of a significant increase in drug loading and control release capability was evaluated. Four types of timolol imprinted lenses were prepared by UV irradiation of N,N-diethylacrylamide (DEAA), 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), 1-(tristrimethyl-siloxysilylpropyl)-methacrylate (SiMA) and N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA) (50:50 v/v), or methylmethacrylate (MMA) and DMAA (50:50 v/v) solutions, to which functional monomer, methacrylic acid (MAA, 100 mM), cross-linker, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA, 140 mM), and timolol maleate (25 mM) were previously added. Non-imprinted systems were synthesized in the same way but with the omission of timolol. Timolol did not interfere in the polymerization process and all lenses were optically clear and, once wet, showed adequate mechanical properties; nevertheless, the lenses significantly differed in temperature of glass transition (estimated by differential scanning calorimetry and oscillatory rheometry), equilibrium water content and drug loading and release properties. Regarding timolol overall affinity (SK), estimated after fitting the Langmuir equation to the adsorption isotherms obtained in water at 37 degrees C, the lenses ranked in the order HEMA>SiMA-DMAA>MMA-DMAA>DEAA. The highest imprinting effect, i.e. the greatest relative increase in overall affinity (SK) respect to non-imprinted systems, was obtained for the last two systems. These results are explained by interaction capability with timolol, conformational features and hydrophilic character of the lenses. Although all lenses (imprinted and non-imprinted) showed sustained release in 0.9% NaCl solution, the values of diffusion coefficients confirmed that timolol molecules move out easily from hydrophilic networks that present low affinity for the drug; i.e. MMA-DMAA and SiMA-DMAA lenses. The results obtained indicate that modulating the composition of the lenses it is possible to adapt the drug loading and release behavior of the lenses to the treatment requirements of specific pathological processes.", 
    "81": "Leptin was initially proposed to be the antiobesity hormone. Now it is realised that leptin is more a signal molecule that communicates nutritional status to the brain, and that it is involved in bone formation by having an antiosteogenic action.", 
    "82": "Recently, Florent Elefteriou and colleagues (Endocrinology 2003; 144: 3842-47) found that hypothalamic neurons control bone mass. These researchers used monosodium glutamate to obliterate neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Previously, this group (Cell 2002; 101: 305-17) had shown that leptin inhibits bone formation by modulating the sympathetic nervous system. Although leptin influences both energy balance and bone mass by acting on the hypothalamus, the two processes involve different proteins and neurons. WHERE NEXT? Leptin has antiosteogenic activity in mice, mediated by hypothalamic nervous pathways and the sympathetic nervous system. Yet some human studies dispute leptin's antiosteogenic role. Large clinical studies are necessary to consolidate leptin's role in the physiology of human bone. In mice the beta blocker propranolol, a widely used drug with no major deleterious effects, significantly increases bone formation and bone mass without affecting bodyweight, a finding that may provide novel opportunities to design efficient bone-forming drugs for human beings.",

ARB-based regimens reduced the risks of total major cardiovascular events (10%; 4-17) compared with control regimens. There were no significant differences in total major cardiovascular events between regimens based on ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, or diuretics or beta blockers, although ACE-inhibitor-based regimens reduced blood pressure less. There was evidence of some differences between active regimens in their effects on cause-specific outcomes. For every outcome other than heart failure, the difference between randomised groups in achieved blood pressure reduction was directly related to the observed difference in risk.",

    "91": "In the rat subthalamic nucleus, which plays a critical role in the control of motor behaviour, specific binding of [3H]-prazosin was detected by radioligand binding to homogenates and by autoradiography in slices. [3H]-Prazosin binding to homogenates (Bmax 71 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein; Kd 0.27 +/- 0.05 nM) was competed for by alpha1-antagonists. In subthalamic nucleus slices and in the presence of 10 mM LiCl, noradrenaline (100 microM) produced a modest, but consistent, stimulation of [3H]-inositol phosphate accumulation (146 +/- 6% of basal), reversed by the alpha1-antagonist prazosin (1 microM). Extracellular single-unit recordings in slices showed that in a subpopulation (61 out of 94 cells) of rat subthalamic neurones with regular, single-spike firing pattern, noradrenaline induced a concentration-dependent increase in the firing rate (EC50 2.5 +/- 0.2 microM, maximum effect 272 +/- 33% of basal). The action of noradrenaline was mimicked by the selective alpha1-agonist phenylephrine but not by selective alpha2- or beta-agonists, and was blocked by the alpha1-antagonist prazosin but not by alpha2- or beta-antagonists. The excitatory effect of noradrenaline was not prevented by perfusion with low Ca2+/high Mg2+ solution. In four out of 11 neurones perfusion with 3 microM noradrenaline resulted in a shift from bursting to regular firing. Taken together, our results indicate that rat subthalamic neurones express alpha1-adrenoceptors responsible for noradrenaline-induced stimulation of the firing rate of a subpopulation of neurones. By modulating the spontaneous activity of STN neurones, noradrenergic pathways might have a significant role in regulating basal ganglia function and thus motor activity.",

On day 6, a single 200-mg dose of celiprolol was administered orally. The plasma concentrations of celiprolol and the excretion of celiprolol into urine were measured up to 33 h after its dosing. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were recorded in a sitting position before the administration of celiprolol and 2, 4, 6, and 10 h later. MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) genotype was assessed with respect to polymorphisms in exon 21 (G2677T/A) and in exon 26 (C3435T).",

The median peak plasma concentration, the time of peak concentration, and the elimination half-life of celiprolol were not significantly changed by rifampicin. During the rifampicin phase, the median amount of celiprolol excreted into urine was decreased by 47% ( P<0.05) and celiprolol renal clearance increased by 19% ( P<0.05) compared with the placebo phase. There were great inter-individual differences in the extent of rifampicin-celiprolol interaction. However, no association was found between the MDR1 polymorphisms and the degree of interaction between rifampicin and celiprolol. No significant differences were observed in hemodynamic parameters between the phases.",

    "96": "Although the enteric reflex pathway triggered by volume distension is known to depend on an adrenergic nerve, it is not known whether the slowing of intestinal transit by fat or peptide YY (PYY) also depends on an adrenergic pathway. The aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that the slowing of transit by fat or PYY may depend on a beta-adrenergic pathway, and this adrenergic pathway may act via the serotonergic and opioid pathways previously observed for the slowing of transit by fat. Eighteen dogs were equipped with duodenal and midgut fistulas. The small intestine was compartmentalized into the proximal and distal half of gut. The role of adrenergic, serotonergic, and opioid pathways was then tested in the slowing of intestinal transit by fat, PYY, and norepinephrine. Intestinal transit results were compared as the cumulative percent marker of recovery over 30 min. We found that the slowing of transit by fat, PYY, or norepinephrine was reversed by propranolol. In addition, the slowing effect of fat was reversed by metoprolol (beta1-adrenoreceptor antagonist) but not phentolamine (alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist). Furthermore, norepinephrine-induced slowing of transit was reversed by ondansetron (5-HT3 receptor antagonist) or naloxone (opioid receptor antagonist). Extending these physiological results, we also found by immunohistochemistry that beta1-adrenoreceptors are expressed by neurons of the intrinsic plexuses of the small intestine. We conclude that the slowing of intestinal transit by fat or PYY depends on a beta-adrenergic pathway and that this adrenergic pathway acts on serotonergic and opioid pathways.", 
    "97": "Pathologic hemorheological parameters and increased platelet aggregation in association with other risk factors significantly increase the possibility of the development of myocardial ischemia. Hemorheological parameters and platelet aggregation were investigated in 157 patients (mean age: 65+/-12 years) with acute coronary syndromes and in 68 healthy subjects (mean age: 36+/-6 years). Plasma fibrinogen, plasma and whole blood viscosity, red blood cell aggregation and filterability and platelet aggregation were measured in the hospital phase (after admission, on 2nd and 6th days) and monitored after discharge (at 1, 6 and 12 months). After admission all these parameters were significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (p<0.01) and almost all of them remained in the pathologic range at discharge. Some of the rheologic parameters showed a slight improvement after 1 month, but hematocrit and whole blood viscosity were higher than those after admission and of control subjects (p<0.05). After 6 and 12 months these parameters showed a small, but significant increase. Pathologically altered hemorheological parameters could be observed in patients with classical cardiovascular risk factors and significant improvement was found after elimination of them. Antiplatelet therapy was efficient in about half of the treated patients after admission; and despite a significant improvement, the proportion of ineffectively treated patients was still considerable during the follow-up. Our results support the role of abnormal hemorheological parameters in the development of myocardial ischemia and draw attention to the rheologic risk of these patients. The results of platelet aggregation measurements show the insufficiency of antiplatelet therapy at some cases and confirm the importance of guided secondary prevention.", 
    "98": "In the studies reported here, the ability of atomoxetine hydrochloride (Strattera) to inhibit or induce the metabolic capabilities of selected human isoforms of cytochrome P450 was evaluated. Initially, the potential of atomoxetine and its two metabolites, N-desmethylatomoxetine and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, to inhibit the metabolism of probe substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A was evaluated in human hepatic microsomes. Although little inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activity was observed, inhibition was predicted for CYP3A (56% predicted inhibition) and CYP2D6 (60% predicted inhibition) at concentrations representative of high therapeutic doses of atomoxetine. The ability of atomoxetine to induce the catalytic activities of CYP1A2 and CYP3A in human hepatocytes was also evaluated; however, atomoxetine did not induce either isoenzyme. Based on the potential of interaction from the in vitro experiments, drug interaction studies in healthy subjects were conducted using probe substrates for CYP2D6 (desipramine) in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer subjects and CYP3A (midazolam) in CYP2D6 poor metabolizer subjects. Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of desipramine (single dose of 50 mg) were not altered when coadministered with atomoxetine (40 or 60 mg b.i.d. for 13 days). Only modest changes (approximately 16%) were observed in the plasma pharmacokinetics of midazolam (single dose of 5 mg) when coadministered with atomoxetine (60 mg b.i.d. for 12 days). Although at high therapeutic doses of atomoxetine inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A was predicted, definitive in vivo studies clearly indicate that atomoxetine administration with substrates of CYP2D6 and CYP3A does not result in clinically significant drug interactions.", 
    "99": "Osmotic swelling of cardiac myocytes and other types of cells activates an outwardly rectifying, tamoxifen-sensitive Cl- current, ICl,swell, but it is unclear whether Cl- currents also are activated by direct mechanical stretch. We tested whether specific stretch of beta1-integrin activates a Cl- current in rabbit left ventricular myocytes. Paramagnetic beads (4.5-microm diameter) coated with mAb to beta1-integrin were applied to the surface of myocytes and pulled upward with an electromagnet while recording whole-cell current. In solutions designed to isolate anion currents, beta1-integrin stretch elicited an outwardly rectifying Cl- current with biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to those of ICl,swell. Stretch-activated Cl- current activated slowly (t1/2 = 3.5 +/- 0.1 min), partially inactivated at positive voltages, reversed near ECl, and was blocked by 10 microM tamoxifen. When stretch was terminated, 64 +/- 8% of the stretch-induced current reversed within 10 min. Mechanotransduction involved protein tyrosine kinase. Genistein (100 microM), a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor previously shown to suppress ICl,swell in myocytes, inhibited stretch-activated Cl- current by 62 +/- 6% during continued stretch. Because focal adhesion kinase and Src are known to be activated by cell swelling, mechanical stretch, and clustering of integrins, we tested whether these tyrosine kinases mediated the response to beta1-integrin stretch. PP2 (10 microM), a selective blocker of focal adhesion kinase and Src, fully inhibited the stretch-activated Cl- current as well as part of the background Cl- current, whereas its inactive analogue PP3 (10 microM) had no significant effect. In addition to activating Cl- current, stretch of beta1-integrin also appeared to activate a nonselective cation current and to suppress IK1. Integrins are the primary mechanical link between the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton. The present results suggest that integrin stretch may contribute to mechano-electric feedback in heart, modulate electrical activity, and influence the propensity for arrhythmogenesis.", 
    "100": "Data are sparse regarding long-term outcomes after hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris (UAP) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), as defined by contemporary criteria. We extended follow-up in a preexisting database of unselected patients with primary UAP and NSTEMI admitted by way of the emergency department from 1991 to 1992. Stepwise Cox models were used to identify multivariate predictors of long-term mortality. There were 275 patients (mean age 66 +/- 12 years, 33% women) who survived to hospital discharge; 134 patients (49%) died during follow-up (median 9.4 years). Significant multivariate predictors of long-term mortality were: age (hazard ratio [HR] per decade 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 1.9); prior MI (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.5); diabetes (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.4); congestive heart failure (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.4); elevated creatinine (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.8); elevated leukocyte count (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.5); systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg at presentation (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.6); lack of coronary revascularization during the index hospitalization (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.0); and lack of discharge beta-blocker therapy (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.2). A clinical prediction rule was generated by assigning weighted point scores for the presence of each significant covariate. Long-term mortality increased markedly with each quintile of score; for quintiles 1 to 5, mortality rates were 8.5%, 29.4%, 47.6%, 75.0%, and 91.5%, respectively (p value for trend <0.001). These data are among the first assessments of long-term mortality after hospitalization for primary UAP and NSTEMI, as defined by contemporary guideline criteria. Easily obtained clinical covariates provide excellent prediction of long-term mortality up to 10 years after hospitalization for primary UAP and NSTEMI.",

Evidence-based medicine provides clinicians with the best armamentarium to provide high quality and cost-effective care to patients diagnosed with this chronic, progressive, and debilitating condition. A multidisciplinary approach to care can be instrumental in the management of these complex patients. Further studies are warranted in elderly patients to provide the evidence for optimal therapies in this frail population.",

Although earlier trials suggested a possible adverse interaction when an angiotensin receptor blocker was added to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a beta-blocker, a recent study and newly analysed mechanistic data indicate that the triple combination provides modest additional inhibition of angiotensin that can further slow progression of disease.", 
    "103": "The beta-blocker (-)-pindolol produces intrinsic sympathomimetic activity manifested clinically by cardiostimulation, but the beta-adrenoceptor subtype, which mediates these effects, is unknown. Recent work indicates the existence of a (-)-propranolol-resistant site of the cardiac beta(1)-adrenoceptor and we propose that it mediates the cardiostimulation evoked by (-)-pindolol. We compared the interaction of (-)-pindolol both with human atrial myocardium and with recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptors. The effects of (-)-pindolol on paced human atrial trabeculae were studied in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; 20 microM). (-)-Pindolol caused small negative and positive inotropic effects at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations respectively, which were unaffected by N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 10 microM), inconsistent with an involvement of nitric oxide. (-)-Pindolol, in the presence of (-)-propranolol, increased atrial contractile force and cAMP through recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptors with identical potency (-logEC(50)M=6.5). The positive inotropic effects of (-)-pindolol were resistant to blockade by L-748,337 (100 nM), a beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist. (-)-CGP12177, known to act through the (-)-propranolol-resistant site of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor, also increased with similar potency atrial contractile force (-logEC(50)M=7.6) and cAMP at recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptors (-logEC(50)M=7.7). (-)-Pindolol blocked the effects of (-)-CGP12177 in human atrium and recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptors with similar equilibrium dissociation constants (pK(B)=6.5 and 6.3). Thus, stimulant potency and blocking potency of (-)-pindolol against (-)-CGP12177 agree. In contrast, (-)-pindolol was 200-400 times more effective at blocking the effects of a catecholamine than the effects of (-)-CGP12177 in both human atrium (pK(B)=9.1) and at recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptors (pK(B)=8.6). We conclude that the cardiostimulant effects of (-)-pindolol in human atrial myocardium are mediated through a (-)-propranolol-resistant site of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor with low affinity for (-)-pindolol. In contrast, (-)-pindolol blocks the effects of catecholamines through a high-affinity site of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor. beta(3)-Adrenoceptors are not involved in the atrial effects of (-)-pindolol.", 
    "104": "Ephedrine is a mixed adrenergic agonist, stimulating both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. The effects of ephedrine use include increases in heart rate, cardiac output, peripheral resistance, and blood pressure, and its use is associated with serious cardiovascular events such as stroke, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction. The vascular endothelium plays a fundamental role in the regulation of vascular tone by releasing vasoactive factors such as nitric oxide (NO). The loss of NO bioactivity, often referred to as endothelial dysfunction, is characterized by the loss of endothelium-dependent vasodilation and is thought to be a common pathway for cardiovascular events such as vasospasm, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. Since endothelial dysfunction is characterized by loss of NO activity, and since ephedrine and endothelial dysfunction may be associated with similar cardiovascular events, the current study was undertaken to determine the effect of inhibition of NO production on responses to ephedrine in the rat. A sodium nitroprusside (SNP) infusion procedure was used to restore baseline vascular parameters to pre-L-NAME levels, allowing for direct comparison of agonist responses before and after NOS inhibition. The results demonstrate that the vascular response to ephedrine in the rat is modulated by NO and that NO production in response to ephedrine may be secondary to beta 2-receptor stimulation.",

The time constant of LV pressure isovolumic decay (tau) was prolonged in placebo MI rats, significantly shortened by eplerenone, and normalized by eplerenone/trandolapril. Increased collagen type I gene expression and collagen content in the noninfarcted LV myocardium from MI placebo rats was attenuated by trandolapril, but almost completely prevented by eplerenone and eplerenone/trandolapril. The addition of eplerenone to ACE inhibition prevented sarcoplasmic-reticulum calcium ATPase downregulation and the increases in LV gene expression of beta-MHC and atrial natriuretic factor more effectively than either monotherapy. Furthermore, combination treatment attenuated the increase in myocardial angiotensin II type 1 receptor expression and increased phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein levels.",

    "125": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. The favorable effects of inhibitors of this system are mainly due to a decrease of the production of angiotensin II. Usual association between angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIA) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors results of a mutual action on the RAS, but important differences exist. ACE inhibitors demonstrated major benefits in heart failure and in post-infarction. In diabetic patients, ACE inhibitor treatment is associated with nephroprotective effects. In four main studies ACE inhibitors didn't demonstrated superior effect on primary outcome compare to standard antihypertensive treatment (diuretics or beta-blockers). However, in HOPE and PROGRESS studies, ACE inhibitors decrease myocardial infarction incidence, even after arterial pressure adjustment. Can we expect the same effects with the AIIA? Of course a direct comparison would be preferable, but some differences emerge. In a main study, AIIA treatment was compared to a standard antihypertensive treatment. The LIFE trial demonstrated superior benefits with losartan than with beta-blocker atenolol for the same degree of blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Losartan had particularly strong effect on risk for stroke and prevented new-onset diabetes. So we have some data to emit the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors decrease the incidence of myocardial infarction and AIIA the incidence of stroke.",

    "130": "Some hypertension treatment guidelines published in the late 1990's recommended that diuretics and betha-blockers be used as 1st line drugs for treating uncomplicated hypertension, reserving new antihypertensive drugs for special indications. This recommendation is predicated on the fact that large trials showing cardiovascular protection with antihypertensive drugs used betha-blockers and diuretics. Other guidelines suggested all antihypertensives are equal and that drug selection should be individualized. These disparate guidelines arise from the controversy over \"are all antihypertensives created equal?\" Since these guidelines, many large hypertension trials have been conducted. This paper will review the recent hypertension trials, the meta-analyses of some of these trials, highlight some of the flaws inherent in the trials that making interpretation difficult, and finally outline a rationale approach to initial treatment of the uncomplicated hypertensive patient. It will provide a rationale for 1) using diuretic and not beth-blocker as the 1st line agent in treating uncomplicated hypertension, 2) switching to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should side effects occur on diuretic, 3) reserving calcium channel blocker, betha-blocker, and alpha-blocker for 2nd or 3(rd) line therapy, 4) employing a diuretic in combination with any other antihypertensive class, and 5) considering use of lower doses of 2 or more antihypertensives to limit side effects while optimizing blood pressure control. If the incidence of de novo diabetes is indeed higher with diuretics and cost-analysis confirm long-term savings with using a more expensive but less diabetogenic drug to treat hypertension, then the recommendation may shift to using an antihypertensive that acts on the renin-angiotensin axis.",

The use of a beta-blocker and aspirin was associated with better survival for patients with maximum serum troponin concentrations > or =2 microg/L.", 
    "137": "Moderate elevations of serum troponin I, which are below the threshold required to diagnose overt myocardial infarction, may reflect ongoing myocardial injury in the critically ill and are associated with a higher mortality rate and longer hospital and intensive care unit length of stays. The use of beta-blockers and aspirin is associated with better outcomes for this subset of patients.", 
    "138": "We have recently shown that TGF-beta3, in the presence of estradiol, increases the release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) from folliculostellate (FS) cells in the pituitary. We determined the interactive effects of TGF-beta3 and estradiol on bFGF production and release from FS cells, and the role of the MAPK pathway in TGF-beta3 and estradiol interaction. We found that TGF-beta3 and estradiol alone moderately increased cell content and release of bFGF from FS cells; but together, they markedly increased the peptide. Estradiol and TGF-beta3 alone moderately activated MAPK p44/42; together they produced marked activation of MAPK p44/42. Pretreatment of FS cells with an MAPK kinase 1/2 inhibitor or with protein kinase C inhibitors suppressed the activation of MAPK p44/42, bFGF release, and protein level increases, all of which were induced by TGF-beta3 and estradiol. Estradiol and TGF-beta3, either alone or in combination, increased the levels of active Ras. Furthermore, bFGF induction by TGF-beta3 and estradiol was blocked by overexpression of Ras N17, a dominant negative mutant of Ras p21. Estrogen receptor blocker ICI 182,780 failed to prevent estrogen's and TGF-beta3's effects on bFGF. These data suggest that an estradiol receptor-independent protein kinase C- activated Ras-dependent MAPK pathway is involved in the cross-talk between TGF-beta3 and estradiol to increase bFGF production and/or release from FS cells.", 
    "139": "Drugs acting on beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors are widely used for the clinical management of a large number of cardiovascular and respiratory pathologies. In the last decade, the discovery of the third subtype of beta receptors, the beta(3)-adrenoceptor, gave a further pharmacological target for the development of new selective drugs. Initially, a potential therapeutic use of beta(3)-selective agents seemed to be restricted to agonists, for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, urinary frequency and incontinence. More recently, some interesting theories about a negative role played by the cardio-depressant activity of myocardial beta(3)-adrenoceptors in heart failure, seemed to justify a clinical use of beta(3)-antagonists in the last phases of this cardiac disease. Following the indications deriving from previous experimental work, the beta-antagonist properties of newly-synthesised (R,S)-(E)-oximeethers of 2,3-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine and of 2,3-dihydrothiopyrano[2,3-b]pyridine were evaluated, in order to identify some useful structure-activity relationships, which might account for selectivity towards the three beta-subtypes and, in particular, the beta(3)-adrenoceptor. Among the various observations regarding possible structure-activity relationships, able to explain the pharmacodynamic patterns of the synthesised compounds on the three subtypes of beta-adrenoceptors, the most significant data derived from the evaluation of the beta(3)-blocking properties of some oximeethers of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives. In these molecules, although the presence of the large substituents in position 7, such as 4-chloro-phenoxy- or 4-t-butyl-phenoxy groups determined a dramatic decline in both the beta(1)- and beta(2)-activities, this structural characteristic had a modest influence on the beta(3)-affinity, which was only slightly lower. Hence, this last structural requirement of oximeethers of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives seems to represent a useful expedient to induce an appreciable selectivity towards the beta(3)-receptor, through a markedly negative effect on the beta(1)- and beta(2)-activities rather than an increase in the beta(3)-affinity.", 
    "140": "The aim of this study of experimental subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and exclusion of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in rabbits was to find out if changes in the central noradrenergic areas of the hypothalamus and brain stem could be ascertained, in parallel with measurement of the intensity of chronic cerebral vasospasm in the basilar arteries.", 
    "141": "Histologic specimens were prepared by perfusion fixation on day 8 after the SAH. The spastic effect of experimentally induced SAH in New Zealand rabbits was investigated: firstly, using our previously developed method for measuring the corrugation coefficient (CC) of the vessel intima on precisely defined locations of the basilar artery (BA) with the aid of computer image analysis; and secondly, by immunohistochemical assessment of the concentration and localization of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), using anti-DBH, at precisely defined sites of the hypothalamus and brain stem of the same rabbit.", 
    "142": "The intima of the BA, assessed by CC, was significantly less corrugated and had significantly less DBH in group A (the control group without SAH and without additional interventions; mean CC = 1.192, P = 0.004; median DBH = 0.50, P = 0.044), in group C (SAH and alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine; mean CC = 1.142, P = 0.000; median DBH = 0.75, P = 0.001), and in group D (SAH and cervical gangliectomy; mean CC = 1.210, P = 0.003; median DBH = 0.50, P = 0.002) compared with group B (rabbits with SAH and without medication). Group B showed a significantly more intensive accumulation of DBH (median DBH = 1.15) and, according to the CC (mean CC = 1.369), more intensive corrugation of the intima of BA than all other groups. The correlation between CC and DBH for all the rabbits (groups A, B, C and D together) was significantly positive (Spearman Rho = 0.470; p = 0.010).", 
    "143": "The results of this study demonstrated: firstly, an intensive excitatory influence of SAH on the quantity of DBH in central noradrenergic areas in the hypothalamus and brain stem; secondly, a very effective influence of peripheral and systemic sympathetic exclusion on lowering the quantity of central sympathetic DBH; thirdly, that the changes in the BA of individual rabbits occur simultaneously with corresponding changes in DBH-containing neurons, thus suggesting the likelihood of SNS involvement in the pathogenesis of post-SAH vasospasm in rabbits.", 
    "144": "The study revealed that beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (0.40 mg/100 g/day, s.c.) in adult male DA rats: (i) increased the thymocyte proliferation and apoptosis, (ii) caused disturbances in kinetics of T cell differentiation leading to distinguishable changes in relative proportion of thymocytes at distinct maturational steps and to an expansion of the most mature single positive (CD4+, CD8+) thymocyte pool, (iii) affected the relative proportion of neither CD4+ nor CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and (iv) augmented the relative number of CD8+CD25+ cells. Thus, the results suggest the role of beta-adrenoceptors in fine-tuning of T cell maturation, and, possibly, distribution and activation of distinct PBL subsets.", 
    "145": "Beta-blockers, as determined by four landmark placebo-controlled studies, impart a significant survival advantage to the chronic heart failure population. What ancillary benefits might be expected from beta-blockade, in terms of symptom relief and improvement in exercise capacity, is less clear. This situation in part reflects the heterogeneity of tools used to quantify quality of life and exercise performance as well as factors concerning the statistical handling of symptom and exercise data. In this review we explore the methodology and results of over 20 trials of carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol where quality of life and measures of exercise capacity were end-points. A consistent message relating to a benefit from beta-blockade on these outcomes was elusive but the finding that patients on beta-blockers did at least as well as patients prescribed placebo was a unanimous verdict. There remains a dearth of data to help identify those patients that are at high risk of adverse events from beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "146": "The pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of atenolol, a antihypertensive, were studied to determine the feasibility of enhanced transdermal delivery of atenolol from the ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) matrix system containing polyoxyethylene-2-oleyl ether as an enhancer in rabbits. The atenolol-EVA matrix (20 mg/kg) was applied to abdominal skin of rabbits. Blood samples were collected via the femoral artery for 32 h and the plasma concentrations of atenolol were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters was calculated using Lagran computer program. The area under the curve (AUC) was significantly higher in the enhancer group (12,402+/-3061 ng/ml.h) than that in the control group (8507+/-2092 ng/ml.h), showing about 46% increased bioavailability (P<0.05). The average C(max) was increased in the enhancer group (1361+/-340 ng/ml) compared with the control group (1168+/-293 ng/ml), but not significantly. The T(max) was significantly decreased in the enhancer group (1.3+/-0.36 h) compared with the control group (2.0+/-0.51 h). The elimination time (t(1/2)) and mean residence time were significantly increased in the transdermal group compared with the IV group. The absolute bioavailability was 19.7% in the control group, 28.6% in the enhancer group and 77.4% in the oral administration group compared with IV the group. As the atenolol-EVA matrix containing polyoxyethylene-2-oleyl ether as an enhancer and tributyl citrate as a plasticizer was administered to rabbits via the transdermal routes, the relative AUC% increased about 1.46-fold compared to the control group, showing a relatively constant, sustained blood concentration with minimal fluctuation. The results of this study show that atenolol-EVA matrix could be developed as a transdermal delivery system providing sustained plasma concentration.", 
    "147": "Surgical procedures on geriatric patients are not always benign, but postoperative mortality and morbidity is improving. Optimal care depends on our ability to recognize potential risk factors and intervene in a positive manner. Not all the data are complete, and we are missing several key randomized trials, but investigators have identified many areas for possible intervention. Hopefully, in the near future, more concrete recommendations can be given for this very large and important topic of perioperative anesthetic issues in the elderly.", 
    "148": "The influence of primary hyperlipidemia on the pharmacokinetics of lipophilic propranolol and hydrophilic atenolol was studied. Thirty patients with hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and mixed hyperlipidemia and healthy subjects were enrolled. A single dose of 80 mg propranolol or 100 mg atenolol was administered orally using a cross-over study design. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated according to the noncompartmental open model. The results reflect the general tendency to altered pharmacokinetics of lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs in patients with disorders of lipid metabolism. In the case of lipophilic propranolol, the most pronounced changes were observed in mixed hyperlipidemia, with a tendency to reduced steady state distribution volume, decrease in the elimination rate constant and total body clearance. In conclusion, the present study revealed an influence of lipid disorders on the pharmacokinetics of beta-blockers, with the most significant alterations seen in mixed hyperlipidemia. The dosage of beta-blockers should be modified in patients with an abnormal lipid profile in serum.", 
    "149": "In time-varying covariate analysis of clinical survival data, it is often of interest to estimate the proportion of treatment effect (PTE), along with its confidence intervals, explained by a surrogate marker. The conventional procedure for such an analysis fits data into two working models separately to estimate the treatment effects before and after adjustment of the covariate. The construction of confidence intervals for the PTE under the conventional procedure lacks support by standard statistical software such as SAS, and could be very computationally demanding even after the support is available in the future. To overcome this problem, we propose a new procedure to simplify the computation. Under the new procedure, the treatment effects before and after adjustment of the covariate are simultaneously estimated from a single model. More important than saving computational effort, the new procedure can also be effectively applied to multiple-covariate models for the decomposition of overall treatment effect and for the comparison of PTE among several surrogate markers. The new procedure is applied to the motivating data example from the LIFE study, and demonstrates flexibility that the conventional procedure currently lacks.", 
    "150": "A facile system for obtaining electrocardiograms from conscious animals was used to conduct studies on 12 animals studied both conscious and anesthetized, on 4 conscious animals given vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) and QT-lengthening test articles, and on 6 animals given test articles thought to not lengthen QTc. In 12 animals whose ECGs were monitored via a bipolar transthoracic ECG, heart rates were slowed with 1.0 mg/kg zatebradine, while they were conscious in their slings, and after being anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. The following regression equations were obtained relating QT to RR: QT = 44.7 ln RR - 132.9, r2 = 0.7, for conscious animals; QT = 79.4 ln RR - 287.4, r2 = 0.8 for anesthetized animals, with RR intervals varying between 150 and 550 ms. The anesthetic increases QT at all RR intervals (p < 0.001), but does not change the slope of the relationship between QT and RR when compared with the conscious guinea pig. The Fridericia method was best for correcting QT for RR interval in conscious guinea pigs, but the Bazett method was best for correcting in anesthetized animals. QTc lengthened significantly in all conscious guinea pigs given, orally, cisapride, ketoconazole, and sotalol (positive test articles) and did not change with methylcellulose (the vehicle) or with propranolol, verapamil, or enalapril (negative controls). These techniques and relationships demonstrate that this methodology may be useful in exploring torsadogenic effects of novel pharmacological entities.", 
    "151": "Widened pulse pressure is an independent predictor of cardiovascular outcomes in older persons. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between antihypertensive medication class and the magnitude of pulse pressure among persons receiving treatment for hypertension in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.", 
    "152": "We analyzed cross-sectional data on 1429 subjects aged 60 years or older who reported receiving one or two hypertensive drugs from the following medication classes: beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The sample represented about 9 million people in the noninstitutionalized U.S. population.", 
    "153": "For the sample as a whole, no significant pulse pressure difference was found for any medication class when compared with the referent beta-blocker group after adjustment for covariates, including mean arterial pressure. In a subgroup analysis stratified by median age, mean pulse pressure was lower in subjects older than 72 years who used diuretics alone (difference = -7 mm Hg, P <0.05) or in combination with beta-blockers (difference = -7 mm Hg, P <0.01) than in those who used beta-blockers alone.", 
    "154": "Older hypertensive subjects who used diuretics alone or in combination with beta-blockers had lower mean pulse pressure as compared with those using beta-blockers alone. These findings lend support to recommendations for use of diuretics in older hypertensive patients.", 
    "155": "A novel HERG channel blocker was isolated from the venom of the scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch, sequenced and characterized at the pharmacological level after chemical synthesis. According to the determined amino acid sequence, the cDNA and genomic genes were then cloned. The genomic gene consists of two exons interrupted by an intron of 65 bp at position -6 upstream from the mature toxin. The protein sequence of this toxin was completely identical with that of a known A-type K+ current blocker BmTx3, belonging to scorpion alpha-KTx subfamily 15. Thus BmTx3 is the first reported alpha-KTx peptide also showing HERG-blocking activity, like gamma-KTx peptides. Moreover, different from classical alpha-KTx peptides, such as charybdotoxin, BmTx3 cannot block Shaker -type K+ channels. Phylogenetic tree analysis reveals that this toxin takes an intermediate position between classical alpha-KTx and gamma-KTx toxins. From a structural point of view, we propose that two separate functional faces might exist on the BmTx3 molecule, responsible for the two different K+-current-blocking functions. Face A, composed of Arg18 and Lys19 in the alpha-helix side, might correspond to HERG blocking activity, whereas Face B, containing a putative functional dyad (Lys27 and Tyr36) in the beta-sheet side, might correspond to A-type blocking activity. A specific deletion mutant with the disrupted Face B, BmTx3-Y36P37del, loses the A-type current-blocking activity, but keeps a similar HERG-blocking activity, as seen with the wild-type toxin.", 
    "156": "LEOPARD syndrome is a rare congenital disease characterized by seven features. Besides the original clinical manifestations, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was reported as an additional laboratory finding recently. We gave general anesthesia to a child of this syndrome, and encountered ECG changes during emergence from anesthesia. The diagnosis was made in her infancy, and had been receiving beta-blocker treatment ever since. The preoperative examination showed remarkable right axis deviation in ECG, and asymmetric ventricular septal hypertrophy in echocardiography. After the operation, several kinds of arrhythmia (i.e. atrioventricular junctional rhythm, atrioventricular dissociation, etc), were observed and they continued for a few minutes. Careful planning for the perioperative management of this syndrome is mandatory. The cardiomyopathy must be examined beforehand. We made an effort to prevent the extreme changes of pre- and after-load during the general anesthesia."
