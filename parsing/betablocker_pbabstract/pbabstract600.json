    "0": "Although beta-blockers are structurally closely related, there are marked differences in the extent of metabolism, related mainly to relative lipophilicity. Lipophilic beta-blockers are metabolized by C-oxidative pathways and glucuronidation. Metabolism of lipophilic beta-blockers is important in determining pharmacokinetics, formation of active metabolites, stereoselectivity and isomer preference, and interphenotypic variation. The oxidative clearance of metoprolol, timolol and bufuralol is regulated/influenced by the debrisoquine hydroxylation gene locus. The metabolism of these lipophilic beta-blockers thus exhibits polymorphic characteristics, there being significant interphenotype differences in pharmacokinetics (bioavailability, peak plasma level, plasma terminal t1/2) between the poor and extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine. There are similar interphenotype differences in beta-blocker pharmacodynamics in terms of beta-blockade. A number of adverse effects of lipophilic beta-blockers have been hypothesized to predominate in the poor metabolizer phenotype including unacceptable bradycardia, loss of cardioselectivity, greater CNS side-effects, and interactions with drugs metabolized by the same polymorphic systems. However, objective evidence for this is lacking.", 
    "1": "Previous investigations have suggested that hydrophilic beta-blockers, which appear at low concentrations in brain tissue, are less likely to produce CNS-related side-effects than are lipophilic beta-blockers, which occur at higher concentrations in the brain. The validity of this hypothesis was tested in a double-blind crossover study in which the hydrophilic beta-blocker atenolol was compared with the lipophilic agents metoprolol and propranolol, in 14 patients with a previous history of nightmares or hallucinations when treated with lipophilic beta-blockers. Nightmares or hallucinations were reported by all patients receiving lipophilic beta-blockers but by only three patients receiving atenolol. The total number of episodes was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) for patients receiving atenolol (8) than for those receiving lipophilic beta-blockers (54). It is concluded that atenolol is significantly less likely to provoke nightmares and hallucinations than are the lipophilic beta-blockers, metoprolol and propranolol. It seems likely that this finding is due to the differences in hydrophilicity amongst these drugs.", 
    "2": "The effects on sleep of four beta-blockers, atenolol, propranolol, metoprolol and pindolol, were studied in a placebo-controlled trial. Drugs were administered in random order to 10 female volunteers who acted as their own controls. Subjects were tested five times, each test period lasting 10 nights (2 baseline, 2 low dose, 4 high dose, and 2 withdrawal). A questionnaire concerning subjective appreciation of the quality of the previous night's sleep was completed each morning. Night recordings of muscle tension, eye movement, heart rate and electroencephalogram were recorded on paper and magnetic tape. Analysis of the subjective questionnaires showed that recollection of dreaming and awakening in the night was increased by the three lipophilic drugs, propranolol, metoprolol, and pindolol. These results confirm reports in the literature but are contrary to those expected from considering the effects of noradrenaline on sleep. Analysis of physiological records confirmed subjects' reports that waking was increased by the lipophilic drugs. Dreaming (rapid eye movement sleep, REM) was reduced, as predicted from knowledge of the effect of noradrenaline on sleep. Increased awakening leads to an increase in remembered dreaming which explains the otherwise paradoxical results. Although atenolol had no effect on subjective measures of sleep this hydrophilic drug also reduced REM frequency, suggesting that either it has some central effect, or that REM reduction is due to a peripheral 'shielding' effect.", 
    "3": "beta-Adrenoreceptor antagonists are liable to produce behavioural side-effects such as drowsiness, fatigue, lethargy, sleep disorders, nightmares, depressive moods, and hallucinations. These undesirable actions indicate that beta-blockers affect not only peripheral autonomic activity but also some central nervous mechanisms. In experimental animals beta-blockers have been found to reduce spontaneous motor activity, to counteract isolation-, lesion-, stimulation- and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, and to produce slow-wave and paradoxical sleep disturbances. Furthermore, central effects such as tranquilizing influences are used for the treatment of conditions such as anxiety. Several different mechanisms of action could be responsible for these CNS effects: Centrally mediated specific actions on centrally located beta-adrenergic receptors, known to exist downstream from, and at the terminals of, 'vigilance-enhancing' central noradrenergic pathways. Centrally mediated specific actions on centrally located receptors of the non-adrenergic type; an affinity of some beta-blockers towards 5-HT-receptors is well documented. Centrally mediated non-specific actions on centrally located neurones, owing to the membrane-stabilizing effects of beta-blockers. Peripherally mediated actions whereby beta-blockers induce changes in the autonomic activity in the periphery, which are relayed to the CNS to induce changes in activity of a variety of central systems. It can be assumed that with any one of the beta-blockers all these mechanisms come into play, yet with varying degrees depending on characteristics of the drugs such as lipophilicity and hydrophilicity, the ratio of antagonist versus (partial) agonist properties, affinity to 'alien' receptor sites, strength of membrane-stabilizing activity, stereospecific affinity, and potency.", 
    "4": "The effects of the beta-blocker atenolol on vigilance, concentration, and psychophysiological condition were determined by measuring visual reaction time and choice reaction time in volunteers subjected to combined physical and mental stress. Atenolol 50 mg or placebo were administered for three days in a double-blind crossover design. Forty male subjects aged 26 +/- 6 years with a mean blood pressure of 126/79 mmHg and increased activity of the sympatheticus nerve were admitted to the first study. Physical workload was imposed using a training ergometer for ten minutes and mental workload was introduced by asking the subjects to calculate additions and subtractions on mechanical equipment. Electrooculography was used to measure visual reaction time. Fifty subjects aged 32 +/- 9 years with a mean blood pressure of 141/90 mmHg were admitted to a second study. The same crossover design was followed, but a different mental workload was imposed; subjects were required to respond to coloured light signals which were presented at intervals of 0.8 seconds, by pressing the appropriate buttons. In this second study visual reaction time was also assessed by electrooculography whereas choice reaction time was defined as the time between the lighting of a signal (in one of five colours on 1-25 different places on a screen) and its extinction by pressing an appropriate coloured button. As expected, blood pressure and heart rate decreased with atenolol. In the first study, in both periods, visual reaction time was higher with placebo than with atenolol. The effect of treatment was small but highly significant (p = 0.004).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "The effects of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists on psychometric tests including vehicle handling, choice reaction time, and kinetic visual acuity (KVA), are reviewed. The beta-blockers had little effect on the performance tests, with the unexplained but reproducible effect of enhanced KVA performance with atenolol. Although the beta-blockers had little effect on performance tests they were shown to have psychotropic effects in normal volunteers. The reasons for the conflicting evidence concerning the effect of these drugs on performance tests is discussed in relation to the present experiments and to variables that may influence response. It is concluded that one should use tests that are as independent as possible from potentially confounding variables. The use of evoked potentials in the electroencephalogram is one such test. A preliminary study is described in which the effects of beta-blockers were detected using visual evoked responses on the electroencephalogram.", 
    "6": "Tests of psychometric function were performed in young, normal volunteers taking several beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. With single doses of atenolol, a cardioselective hydrophilic beta-blocker, dose-dependent effects were apparent and were maximal at a dose of 200 mg. The lipophilic non-selective beta-blocker, propranolol, also produced significant impairment of psychomotor tests but these were inversely related to dose, the longest effects being at a dose of 40 mg but with little effect at 320 mg. Subsequently, a multisubject comparison of propranolol and atenolol confirmed these findings and showed the effects to be of the same order of magnitude as those produced by diazepam. Chronic administration of atenolol 100 mg, nadolol 80 mg and diazepam 5 mg daily for seven days showed some effects with all drugs during the test period; however, these were sporadic rather than persistent. Overall, beta-blockers do appear to have central effects in man which can be demonstrated by psychomotor tests. However, the relevance of these central effects to maintenance therapy and skilled performance is unclear.", 
    "7": "Tests of performance emphasizing alertness, psychomotor speed, and reaction time are widely used in testing the effect of beta-blockers on the central nervous system. However, this aspect of brain function is only one of many that are amenable to psychometry. This paper is presented from the stand-point of psychiatry and provides an overview of psychometric testing that highlights the points of contact with general medicine and psychiatry, and with research in both these areas. The applications of psychometry in defining relatively stable individual differences such as intelligence or personality, and in distinguishing morbid from normal states, are discussed. The use of psychometry in detecting performance changes relevant to pharmacological research is reviewed. Interpretation of all test results depends upon an understanding of the structure of the test itself. The confidence that may be placed on interpreting results depends on adequate reliability. For any inference to be drawn there must be both normative data and criterion validity, i.e. discovery of the score point at which there are demonstrable changes in day-to-day function other than those detected within the confines of the test. Unfortunately many psychometric tests fall short on these data and, therefore, inferences from their use should be made cautiously.", 
    "8": "Much of our knowledge about the CNS control of blood pressure is derived from animal studies using techniques such as intracerebroventricular administration of drugs, stereotactic ablation of specific brain nuclei, and biochemical analysis of these nuclei. These methods have identified numerous specific brain nuclei in the brain stem and a meshwork of interconnecting neurones involved in cardiovascular control. The main neurotransmitter involved is noradrenaline but recent interest has focused on several laterally situated nuclei which are capable of synthesizing adrenaline. Centrally acting antihypertensive drugs are thought to act by stimulating central alpha 2-adrenoceptors either by the parent drug itself (clonidine) or via the formation of an active metabolite (alpha-methyldopa). This leads to decreased peripheral sympathetic activity and a hypotensive response but the latter is often attained at the expense of central side-effects such as drowsiness or dry mouth. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of beta-blockers remains uncertain although the balance of evidence is against a central effect. The central administration of propranolol causes decreased peripheral sympathetic activity in animals, but plasma catecholamine levels are little altered by beta-blockers in man. In equipotent antihypertensive doses, central alpha-agonists cause a much greater reduction in plasma noradrenaline than beta-blockers.", 
    "9": "Previous studies have shown that ECG changes following a subarachnoid haemorrhage are associated with increased catecholamine levels, necrotic myocardial lesions, and a poor prognosis. Furthermore, beta-blockade using propranolol reverses some of the ECG changes and prevents necrotic myocardial lesions. This study was established to assess the affects of adrenergic blockade on morbidity and mortality following subarachnoid haemorrhage. Patients were admitted to the randomized double-blind between-patients study if they presented at the neurosurgical unit within 48 hours of a subarachnoid haemorrhage confirmed by lumbar puncture. Of 224 patients, the first 118 received an alpha-blocker, phentolamine 20 mg three-hourly, and either the beta-blocker propranolol 80 mg eight-hourly, or placebo. The last 106 patients received either propranolol or placebo. Treatment was continued for three weeks. Assessment at four weeks revealed significant improvements in the treated group for neurological deficit (p = 0.003) and death (p = 0.02). More treated patients underwent operation and those that did had a better outcome (p = 0.01). Assessment at one year showed that although patients had improved in both groups, patients in the treated group had significantly fewer neurological deficits (p = 0.003). There were fewer deaths in the treated group but this difference was not significant (p = 0.09). Possible mechanisms for this protective effect of propranolol may include a reduction in plasma renin activity, a reduction in pulmonary oedema, prevention of myocardial infarcts, and a reduction in cerebral oxygen requirements. It is concluded that early beta-blockade benefits patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage, in terms of fewer neurological deficits, for up to one year.", 
    "10": "Patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) have been shown to benefit from beta-blockade. SAH patients who came to surgery were investigated if they had been receiving chronic (approximately one week) oral treatment with either hydrophilic atenolol (100 mg/day) or one of the following lipophilic beta-blockers: propranolol (80 mg b.i.d.), oxprenolol (80 mg b.i.d.), or metoprolol (100 mg b.i.d.). Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of beta-blockers did not reflect their concentrations in the brain. Brain concentrations of the three lipophilic beta-blockers were 10-20 times higher than those of atenolol. The approximate brain/plasma concentration ratios were 26 for propranolol, 50 for oxprenolol, 12 for metoprolol, and 0.2 for atenolol. The brain is thus buffered from peak blood concentrations of atenolol, and this may account for the low incidence of CNS-related side-effects with this hydrophilic beta-blocker.", 
    "11": "The penetration of beta-adrenoceptor blockers into the cerebrospinal fluid and into brain tissue is related to the lipophilicity of these drugs, as reflected by the partition coefficients between octanol and aqueous buffers. However, experimental techniques in animal models show no obvious relationships between the degree of brain penetration and the acute central antihypertensive effect of certain beta-blockers. This discrepancy is demonstrated convincingly by comparative experiments with atenolol and metoprolol. Both drugs are beta 1-selective blockers, and atenolol is highly polar, whereas metoprolol is lipophilic. Both these beta-blockers penetrate the CNS but to differing degrees. The experiments performed with these compounds support other studies described in the literature and do not suggest that there is a central mechanism which underlies the antihypertensive activity of beta-blockers.", 
    "12": "Acute i.v. administration of 15 mg/kg acebutolol in normotensive (WKY), Okamoto (SHR) and Okamoto stroke-prone (SHR-SP) awake rats resulted in weak effects on blood pressure and in bradycardia more marked in SHR-SP. Thirty minutes after i.v. administration, lung and renal uptake of [14C]acebutolol was reduced in SHR compared to other rats. Muscle uptake was higher in SHR and blood concentration was higher in SHR-SP. Brain levels were low and similar in all rats. Plasma protein binding was identical in all rats. These results are discussed according to the characteristics of the three strains studied.", 
    "13": "Cardiac responses to alpha and beta adrenergic drugs have been studied in the eel firstly at atmospheric pressure (1 ATA), secondly at 101 ATA per se hydrostatic pressure. The exposure of treated eels for 1 hr at 101 ATA cancels the propranolol effect, increases the clonidine effect and induces paradoxal effects (reversal effect) of isoproterenol, phentolamine and phenylephrine. The highly significant interaction (P less than 0.001) between drugs and HP at 101 ATA is discussed and interpreted as effects of hydrostatic pressure inducing a change in receptor function.", 
    "14": "Pretreatment with acebutolol or propranolol at high concentrations had an inhibitory effect on the contractile response to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in most vascular smooth muscles such as rabbit aorta and basilar, mesenteric, renal, femoral arteries and cat coronary artery. The inhibitory actions of both agents were generally greater than on the responses to excess Ca2+ and potassium. In rabbit renal arteries, acebutolol had no effect on the response to 5-HT but inhibited the responses to excess Ca2+ and potassium. Propranolol had a marked inhibitory effect on the response to 5-HT. In all preparations used, the contractions induced by norepinephrine (NE) and histamine showed a much greater resistance to the effect of acebutolol and propranolol than the contractions induced by 5-HT, Ca2+ and potassium. Nifedipine had no inhibitory effect on the response to 5-HT in most of the preparations. Nifedipine inhibited the response to 5-HT only in the basilar arteries. The inhibitory actions of propranolol on the response to 5-HT was greater than that of acebutolol. The inhibitory action of acebutolol and propranolol on the response to 5-HT may be related to mechanisms other than the beta-adrenoceptor blocking action of the drugs. The possible mechanisms of inhibitory action of both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on 5-HT are discussed.", 
    "15": "When the opiate antagonist naloxone is administered to anesthetized dogs subjected to hemorrhagic shock, there is a transient decrease in heart rate and sustained increases in mean arterial pressure, maximum left ventricular dp/dt, and cardiac output. Surgical cardiac denervation and pharmacologic blockade of autonomic receptors were employed to investigate the mechanisms of these two responses. The transient bradycardia was prevented by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade or cardiac denervation. The sustained response was unaffected by cardiac denervation, attenuated by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, and potentiated by cholinergic receptor blockade. Naloxone had no significant effect on plasma catecholamines. The sustained hemodynamic response to naloxone appears to have two components: there is an increase in parasympathetic stimulation which modestly attenuates the adrenergic component of the response. The adrenergic stimulation of the heart after naloxone administration appears to result from potentiation of existing adrenergic stimulation and not from increased sympathoadrenal discharge. These sustained sympathetic and parasympathetic responses appear to result from the action of naloxone at a myocardial site.", 
    "16": "The influence of plasmin on blood coagulation in fishes has been studied. The plasmin administration in dose 250 conditional units has been shown to evoke hypercoagulation already on the 5th minute after injection. This defence reaction on the plasmin excess in blood flow was excluded by the preliminary administration of alpha- as well as beta-adrenoblocators. Subtle differentiation of adrenoreceptors is supposed to be absent in fishes, nevertheless they play a definite role in regulation of hemostasis system.", 
    "17": "The beta-adrenergic effect on the release of immunoregulatory cells from the spleen was investigated by physical stress testing (bicycle ergometry up to submaximal work capacity) in 19 normal subjects (15 males, median 21 years) and in 10 male patients splenectomized for trauma (median 29 years). It was repeated in 6 subjects of each group during beta-blockade with 80 mg oxprenolol. Blood samples for leucocyte analysis were taken before and at the end of the test. Leucocyte subpopulations were analyzed in a cytofluorograph after staining of buffy coat cells by direct (B cells) or indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies directed against the phenotypes of T- (Leu-1), T helper- (Leu-3a), T suppressor/cytotoxic (Leu-2a) cells and natural killer (OKM1+ lymphocytes) cells. In the controls all leucocyte subsets increased at ergometry, but B-, Leu-2a- and OKM1-cells increased more than Leu-3a cells. During beta-blockade the leucocyte changes reached only 50% of the value without treatment; the B- and Leu-2a cell mobilization was reduced more than the Leu-3a-, OKM1 cell- and monocyte changes. In splenectomized patients the proportional cellular changes were only half of those found in normal subjects, except for the Leu-3a cells which were not released. Beta-blockade during ergometry had no effect on Leu-3a cells, a similar effect on B- and Leu-2a cells as in normal subjects and a stronger effect on granulocytes, monocytes and OKM1 cells than in controls. In conclusion, the B- and Leu-2a cell mobilization from the spleen (50%) was beta-adrenoceptor dependent, while the one from other lymphoid organs was beta-adrenoceptor independent. The strongly spleen dependent Leu-3a cell changes were not beta-adrenoceptor mediated. Granulocyte-, monocyte- and OKM1 cell changes were only partly spleen dependent. The spleen independent changes however were strongly beta-adrenoceptor dependent.", 
    "18": "Intermittent claudication has been claimed to be a side-effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. The confounding effect of coronary heart disease has not been controlled in earlier studies. In this case-control study, the cases were selected from a hospital material of patients with verified intermittent claudication and the controls from a nationwide health survey. The pool of potential cases and controls consisted of persons who had been treated with antihypertensives, but did not have coronary heart disease. The controls and cases were matched for age, sex, place of residence and time of examination. Comparison of current or previous use of beta-blocking drugs among our 55 case-control pairs revealed no association between intermittent claudication and beta-blockade. beta-Blockade is not a risk factor for intermittent claudication.", 
    "19": "Gastrointestinal (GI) motility is centrally controlled through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, sympathetic effects being partly mediated by beta adrenoceptors. Although beta adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists are widely used for different disorders, little is known about the influence of these agents on GI motility. The present study was initiated to investigate whether there is a physiological, beta adrenergic influence on human GI motility and to describe the effects of selective beta adrenoceptor stimulation on motility in the proximal and distal parts of the GI tract. Esophageal peristalsis was measured in healthy subjects using electronic catheters. Distal colonic motility was measured with an open-tipped, water-perfused catheter in the sigmoid colon and from an air-filled balloon in the rectum in healthy subjects and in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In one study, colonic motility was stimulated with continuous infusion of the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-OP). Esophagus: Peristaltic amplitude was increased in the distal smooth muscle part of the esophageal body after infusion of both the nonselective beta blocker propranolol and the beta-1 selective blocker metoprolol. After infusion of the beta-1 agonist prenalterol and the beta-2 selective agonist terbutaline, a profound decrease in esophageal peristaltic amplitude was seen. Pretreatment with metoprolol selectively blocked the response to a moderate dose of prenalterol but did not block the response to terbutaline. The latter response was blocked by propranolol. Peristaltic velocity in the proximal part of the esophagus was decreased by beta-1 stimulation and in the distal part by beta-2 stimulation. Distal colon: In healthy subjects the sigmoid motility index showed a dose-dependent increase after metoprolol and propranolol, respectively. The increase was more marked after propranolol infusion. Terbutaline decreased the sigmoid motility index both in healthy subjects and in patients with the IBS. Furthermore, the rectal motility index was decreased in the group of healthy subjects. The effects of prenalterol on rectal and sigmoid motility did not differ from those of placebo. The IBS patient group showed larger intraindividual variations in sigmoid motility from day to day and also lower rectal motility indices than the healthy subjects. Infusion of CCK-OP increased the sigmoid motility index compared to non-stimulated conditions. No effects on CCK-OP stimulated motility were seen after either terbutaline, prenalterol or placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "20": "Multiclinic controlled studies have shown that enalapril alone 10 to 40 mg/day orally is effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. Enalapril has been compared with thiazides and beta-blockers (propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol). The effect on systolic blood pressure has been greater with enalapril than with beta-blockers. The proportion of patients who respond to enalapril alone with a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (greater than or equal to 10mm Hg) is around 70%. When a thiazide is added to the treatment, the proportion is above 90%. Enalapril improves the signs and symptoms associated with congestive heart failure. Patients increased their exercise tolerance by an average of 148 sec and improved in their NYHA cardiac status and prognosis classification. The overall incidence of side effects is similar to that seen in the placebo control groups. Side effects such as agranulocytosis, taste loss, rash, proteinuria were not characteristic of enalapril. This supports the hypothesis that the improved safety profile of enalapril is the result of being a nonsulphydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The most common side effects reported were dizziness, headache and asthenia. Abnormalities in electrolytes, uric acid, glucose or in lipids have generally not been associated with enalapril.", 
    "21": "This study was undertaken to determine whether it was possible to use a multivariate discriminant function analysis to assess the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with angina pectoris. One hundred and forty-three patients diagnosed as having angina pectoris who formed a 'learning group' were subjected to an exercise test on a treadmill using a Bruce protocol. The items of data from the test least likely to be influenced by beta blockade were considered for the analysis along with two discrete variables (the gender and the use of beta blockers). All the patients subsequently underwent coronary angiography and the severity of the coronary artery disease was graded according to a scoring system. In addition, patients in 'learning group' were classified into two 'Groups', (I) those with normal vessels or with disease in one or two of the major arteries, (II) those with disease in the left main stem or in all three major arteries. The multivariate analysis yielded a score based upon 4 factors: (i) gender, (ii) percentage increase in double product at the highest level of exercise achieved, (iii) duration of ST depression in the recovery period and (iv) the summation of the ST depression in the standard electrocardiogram excluding lead aVR. There was a significant overall correlation between the discriminant function score and the coronary artery score for severity of the disease. In addition, it was found that, of patients having discriminant function score below 0, 96% (69/72) were in Group I. The post-test risk of a positive test was 0.005.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "Human and animal studies link social and environmental factors to hypertension and ischemic heart disease. Job stress and undesirable life events may precede the development of raised blood pressure. Hypertension and ischemic heart disease vanquished many of the survivors of the seige of Leningrad. Specific behavior patterns of some patients with ischemic heart disease and the psychological ambience of others with hypertension have been associated with raised neural tone as reflected by levels of plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine. Sympathoneural hypertonicity is a factor in left ventricular hypertrophy and the latter has been a prophet for sudden cardiac death. Sympathoadrenal surges may contribute to both reduced coronary reserve in hypertensives and increased vulnerability to ventricular dysrhythmia. The \"coronary epidemic\" of our modern times appears related in part to outdated survival mechanisms, not suitable to human behavior in our urban milieu. Beta receptor blocking agents are effective antidotes providing protection from adrenomedullary overdrive and even perhaps, modification of that behavior. Stress and the sympathetic nervous system are important co-conspirators in hypertension and sudden cardiac death.", 
    "23": "Rats were trained over 40 days to lever-press for food reward under a schedule of differential reinforcement of low rates of response with a 20-s criterion (DRL 20), following seven sessions of continuous reinforcement. The effect of injecting a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol (5 mg/kg IP), before and at two different delays after each daily session of DRL were investigated. In Experiment I, rats drugged 5-8 min before every session earned fewer reinforcements compared to controls, and showed impaired temporal discrimination. In Experiment II, this result was not replicated, but similar effects were clear in animals drugged pre-session from the 15th day of acquisition. By contrast, an improved temporal discrimination, and increased number of reinforcements were seen in rats drugged 5-8 min after every session. In Experiment III, the post-session effects were replicated and found also in rats drugged 4-5.5 h after each session. These results suggest that propranolol has an acute effect on DRL responding which resembles that of anxiolytics, and a chronic effect which opposes the acute one.", 
    "24": "A randomized cross-over trial was undertaken on 21 occupationally active persons who had a stable mild or moderate hypertension with the purpose of comparing the effect of a beta-adreno-receptor blocking agent (atenolol) with that of a calcium channel inhibitor (nifedipine). The doses recommended by the manufactures were used. Atenolol (100 mg) given once a day resulted in a marked hypotensive effect at rest as well as during exercise, the compliance was satisfactory, and the hemodynamic changes were not reflected in unfavourable side effects during muscular exercise or in the subjects own personal assessment of fatigue during the exercise tests which ranged in energy expenditure from about three to six times the resting level. However, unfavourable, modest side effects occurred in two subjects during atenolol medication to the extent that they wanted to terminate the study. Nifedipine therapy with doses of 10 mg, three times a day, resulted in a modest, but statistically insignificant reduction in arterial blood pressure, which contrasts with previous published results. It is suggested that the modest effect is caused or related to the poor compliance and a daily dose that was quantitatively too small. No unfavourable side effects were seen during muscular efforts when the subjects were on nifedipine medication.", 
    "25": "Prenalterol was administered as an intravenous infusion at three incremental rates (60, 120 and 240 nmol/min) to five patients with severe cardiac failure. Haemodynamic, hormonal and metabolic variables were measured at the same time as plasma prenalterol concentrations, and the pharmacokinetics of the drug were studied by following plasma concentrations and urinary excretion during and after the infusion. Concentration-dependent increases in cardiac index, stroke index and stroke work index were observed without increases in arterial pressure, heart rate or myocardial oxygen demand. The reninangiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated, although the extent of stimulation varied among patients. No strong correlations were found between the logarithm of the plasma prenalterol concentration and effect. Plasma clearance of the drug was lower in cardiac patients than in normal volunteers, but a large decrease in renal clearance was partially balanced by an increase in nonrenal clearance. Over the observed range of concentrations, no deviation from linearity was evident, and plasma concentrations of about 150 nmol/l were effective in improving cardiac function without significant side-effects.", 
    "26": "The disposition of the beta adrenoceptor blocking drug 1-(2-cyclohexylphenoxy)-3-isopropylamino-2-propanol, exaprolol, in organs of the rat has been studied. After i.v. administration of 3H-exaprolol a transient extremely high accumulation of the drug in lungs was observed with a peak of 7.7% of dose/g 30 min post-administration. The disposition pattern in heart, kidneys and liver may be characterized by a tissue to plasma ratio about ten. Lower exaprolol tissue levels were observed after oral administration. The tissue to plasma ratios showed an initial increase followed by constant levels. The distribution of exaprolol in organs of the rat is discussed in the light of the previously determined pharmacokinetic parameters.", 
    "27": "The purpose of the study was to determine a direct vascular effect of beta-blockers on isolated glomeruli of rat kidney. The glomeruli were isolated by sieving and their diameters measured with a micrometer before and after addition of each of three beta-blockers. The diameter of the glomeruli increases (6,7%) with verapamil, a calcium inhibitor, but remains unchanged in the same experimental conditions as well with propranolol, drug which decreases renal plasma flow, than with nadolol and tertatolol, drug increasing renal haemodynamics. The location and the mechanism of the glomerular vasoactivity of these different beta-blockers are discussed.", 
    "28": "The action of nicardipine on cardiac volume, both at rest and during exercise-induced angina, was evaluated in 12 patients with angiographically-proven coronary artery disease. Nicardipine given to patients at rest reduced systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure and increased heart rate and cardiac index. The left ventricular filling pressure, ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were unchanged. During supine bicycle exercise, the reduction in systemic arterial blood pressure following nicardipine increased cardiac and stroke index and attenuated the rise in left ventricular filling pressure observed in the control exercise. The effects of nicardipine on EF, end-diastolic and end-systolic cardiac volumes were dependent on the baseline cardiac reserve. In patients with EF less than 50%, nicardipine improved EF and left ventricular exercise volumes.", 
    "29": "The effects of intravenous nicardipine (2.5 mg) on the left ventricular (LV) inotropic state, LV metabolism, and coronary haemodynamics were analysed in 22 patients with angina pectoris. Measurements were made at fixed heart rate (atrial pacing), under basal state, and during a cold pressor test. After nicardipine, coronary blood flow and oxygen content in the coronary sinus increased significantly. The indices of inotropic state increased slightly, and the rate of isovolumic LV pressure fall improved. Myocardial oxygen consumption was unchanged despite the significant reduction in pressure-rate product, but LV lactate uptake increased, particularly during the cold pressor test. When nicardipine was administered after propranolol, the indices of inotropic state were unaffected. The lack of direct effect of nicardipine on LV inotropic state was further confirmed by intracoronary injection of 0.1 and 0.2 mg in a separate group of 10 patients. It is concluded that the nicardipine-induced coronary dilatation seems to improve perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischaemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption.", 
    "30": "The pharmacokinetic properties of adimolol (MEN 935), a new antihypertensive agents with predominantly beta-receptor blocking and additional alpha-adrenolytic activity were investigated in healthy volunteers. Study A subjects (n = 6) received single intravenous doses of 5 mg adimolol and single oral doses of 200 mg capsules, 200 mg tablets and 100 mg tablets on four occasions separated by at least two weeks. Study B subjects (n = 6) were given single intravenous doses of 5 mg and single oral doses of 100 mg of the 14C-labelled drug on two different occasions. Study C subjects (n = 6) were administered multiple oral doses of 100 mg adimolol daily for five days, and three weeks later 50 mg daily for five days. Adimolol plasma concentrations were assayed over seven days following each single dose using a specific and sensitive high-pressure liquid chromatographic method. The plasma concentration data obtained from the single i.v. dose studies were individually fitted to an open four-compartment model. To describe mathematically the single oral dose plasma level data, two compartments were added to the model to take care of the absorption. Irrespective of the route of administration, the doses and formulations given, all plasma concentration curves could be described with similar pharmacokinetic parameters. Plasma concentration curves predicted by the open four-compartment model were fully confirmed by the actual data obtained after chronic oral administration. The terminal half-life averaged 12 h following intravenous and 15 h after oral administration. The peak plasma concentration was reached on average 4 h following oral administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

It was found out that 10 compounds have no effect on the glucose transport and that their lipophilicities are very low. The inhibition constants and the inhibition kinetics of the glucose uptake of the other 5 beta-receptor blockers were estimated. No correlation exists between their affinities to the glucose transport sites and the partition coefficients.", 
    "32": "N-(2,5-Dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-6-(4-morpholinyl)-3-pyridazinamine hydrochloride (MDL-899) is a new long-acting antihypertensive vasodilator which reduces the blood pressure of conscious hypertensive rats and dogs to normal levels. The oral doses that reduce blood pressure by 50 mmHg are: 4.4 mg/kg in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), 18 mg/kg in conscious Milan hypertensive strain (MHS) and 1.7 mg/kg in conscious renal hypertensive dog (RHD). The i.v. doses are 1.26, 3.2 and 0.9 mg/kg. The reduction in blood pressure is slow (peak effect at 3 h) and long-lasting (more than 7 h) after p.o. or i.v. administration. Tolerance to MDL-899 is seen to develop in hypertensive dogs, whereas in hypertensive rats this phenomenon never occurs. The compound antagonizes the development of hypertension when given to SHR between days 25 and 88. The haemodynamic study in conscious normotensive rats (labelled microspheres) demonstrated that the fall in blood pressure is accompanied by increases in heart rate and cardiac output and a decrease in total peripheral resistance. The lack of alpha-blocking activity, in the rat caudal artery \"in vitro\"; beta 2-stimulating activity, in SHR pretreated with propranolol, and prostaglandin (PG) release activity, in SHR pretreated with indomethacin, excludes the possibility that the hypotension is due to one of these mechanisms. MDL-899 given orally to rats has no important depressant effects on the CNS at hypotensive or higher doses and induces no adrenergic system stimulation symptoms (midriasis, exophthalmus). In comparison with hydralazine, it is slower in onset and longer lasting, devoid of adrenergic system stimulation, less toxic and nonmutagenic. They are equipotent after p.o. treatment.", 
    "33": "The aim of inotropic therapy is to increase the force of myocardial fibre shortening by improving the availability of calcium to the contractile proteins. Digitalis remains the most widely used drug, but its positive inotropic effects are weak and the therapeutic index is low. Dobutamine is the most useful catecholamine because the most cardioselective and it induces the least increase in myocardial oxygen consumption. There are three groups of new inotropic agents: sympathomimetics: pirbuterol and prenalterol are effective in the short term but tolerance is usually observed within a few weeks. Salbutamol and terbutaline have only been assessed in acute studies, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (MDL 17043, MDL 19025) are powerful inotropic agents in the short and medium term. ARL 115 has mainly been studied by parenteral administration, Amrinone has a largely unknown mode of action, but is a very effective positive inotropic drug; its side-effects limit it as age. However, its derivative, milrinone, seems to be more inotropic and less toxic. The new inotropic drugs currently under assessment are active in the short term but their long-term efficacy and side-effects are still little known. The ideal inotropic agent remains to be discovered.",

There is a markedly increased risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease and central nervous system in such patients. The hemodynamics in hypertension of the elderly differs in a number of parameters from hypertension in the younger patient. In addition, drug metabolism is markedly altered by the aging process. This combination of factors requires a selective choice of agents for the management of hypertension in the elderly. The role of various drug modalities and their efficacy is reviewed in this presentation.",

    "36": "A beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, befunolol, which is clinically used in the treatment of glaucoma in Japan, was found to have intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in isolated right atria, trachea and taenia caecum of guinea pig (intrinsic activities are 0.22-0.28). The pD2-values of befunolol estimated in the isolated organs were significantly different from its pA2-values against isoprenaline. A possible explanation of our findings would to be as follows: befunolol interacts with the beta-adrenoceptor where there may be two different sites: one site for agonistic action and the other for competitive antagonistic action. Both sites are supposed to be mutually exclusive through unknown mechanisms. The intrinsic activity of befunolol may be equal to its selectivity for both the sites.", 
    "37": "Insulin hypoglycemia or epinephrine release may lead to adverse increases in blood pressure in the presence of non-cardioselective beta-blockers. However, increases in blood pressure have not been observed in beta-blocker treated patients during physical exercise, handgrip tests, or during infusions with the alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine. In this study we have further evaluated the role of adrenergic stimuli in the etiology of these responses of blood pressure during beta-blocker therapy. These data do not support a direct role for beta 2 receptors or norepinephrine in pressor responses observed during beta-blocker therapy. Blockade of beta 1 receptors or, more likely, a facilitating effect of propranolol upon the alpha-adrenergic receptors might explain the enhanced pressor responses found after administration of the alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine. However, high doses of phenylephrine seem needed to elicit such pressor responses.", 
    "38": "The stimulation of the adenylate cyclase activity of isolated rat renal glomeruli by isoproterenol decreased during kidney maturation. A potentiation of the isoproterenol response by GTP was demonstrated in young and adult animals. Both KF and GPP(NH)P enhanced the enzyme activity under basal conditions in young and adult glomeruli. GTP had no significant effect upon the basal activity of the adenylate cyclase in glomeruli of 14-day old rat kidney while it had one in 21-day old and adult kidneys.", 
    "39": "During infusion with adrenaline in healthy subjects there was a more than 50% reduction in serum myoglobin concentrations. This effect appeared to be specific for beta-adrenergic stimulation, since no changes were seen after prior IV beta-blockade with propranolol, nor did noradrenaline affect the serum myoglobin levels. Oral beta-blockade with propranolol raised the basal serum levels of myoglobin and enhanced the exercise-related rise in serum myoglobin concentrations during ergometer cycling to exhaustion. These observations thus indicate that the beta-adrenergic system affects serum myoglobin concentrations. This should be kept in mind in the evaluation of myoglobin measurements for clinical purposes, and might reflect a physiologically relevant mechanism.", 
    "40": "Cardiac adrenergic receptors in snakes were examined using an isolated atria preparation of Naja naja and Ptyas korros. Treatments included an examination of the atrial responses to selective alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. In both species, both phenylephrine and isoproterenol produced dose-dependent increases in the atrial beating rate and tension. Phenylephrine-induced increases were characterized with a high affinity and low affinity components. These positive chronotropic and inotropic effects produced by phenylephrine and isoproterenol were abolished with propranolol and in the phenylephrine-induced response phentolamine also attenuated the low affinity response and blocked the high affinity response. With catecholamines depletion via 6-OH dopamine or reserpine, the high affinity component in the phenylephrine-induced response was no longer observed. It is concluded that beta-adrenoceptors are the predominant post-synaptic adrenoceptors in snake atria. Stimulatory presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors for modulating noradrenaline release may also be present.",

These receptors do not appear to belong to the beta 1-subtype.", 
    "42": "In 5-6-week-old cockerels the circulating corticosterone concentration was significantly increased in birds i.m. injected 30 and 60 min previously with adrenaline (0.33 mg/kg), noradrenaline (0.33 mg/kg) or a beta-adrenergic agonist (isoprotorenol, 1 mg/kg), but was reduced in birds pretreated with an alpha-adrenergic agonist (phenylephrine, 1 mg/kg). The stimulation of corticosterone secretion induced by a 30 min period of forced exercise (0.04 km/hr; 0 degree incline) was potentiated by noradrenaline, isoprotorenol and phentolamine pretreatment. In response to exogenous adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH, 8 i.u./kg), administered i.v., the increase in the plasma corticosterone concentration was elevated above that in the controls in birds pretreated with adrenaline, noradrenaline, isoprotorenol or phentolamine (an alpha antagonist administered at 1 mg/kg). The corticosterone response to ACTH was suppressed by phenylephrine pretreatment. These results demonstrate that both basal and stimulated levels of adrenocortical activity may be subtly regulated by adrenergic mechanisms acting at a site(s) within the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.", 
    "43": "Actions of the adrenergic beta-2 agonists, salbutamol and terbutaline, and the beta-1 antagonists, metoprolol and atenolol, were examined on denervated melanophores and leucophores of a teleost, Oryzias latipes. Beta-2 agonists depressed the pigment-aggregation response of melanophores to norepinephrine, while beta-1 antagonists inhibited the dispersion response of leucophores to isoproterenol but not the melanophore response. These findings suggest that adrenergic receptors mediating pigment dispersion in melanophores are beta-2 and those of leucophores are beta-1. The possible relations between receptor mechanisms and the responses of chromatophores are discussed.", 
    "44": "The Intrinsic Sympathetic Activity (ISA) of the beta-1-adrenoceptor blocker celiprolol was tested in a series of pharmacological and clinical investigations. Celiprolol shows much more pronounced positive chronotropic effects in spontaneously beating atria of cats than in those of guinea-pigs and rats. Positive inotropic effects of celiprolol are much pronounced in the left kitten atrium, but scarcely demonstrable in the kitten papillary muscle. Celiprolol has no influence on the adenylyl cyclase activity of the dog heart. In reserpinized rats and reserpinized, adrenalectomized, vagotomized cats celiprolol increases the heart rate to the same extent as the beta-blocker pindolol. In ganglion-blocked dogs celiprolol distinctly increases heart rate and left ventricular contraction force. Celiprolol relaxes isolated human arterial and venous strips and induces a transient increase of the femoral arterial blood flow in anaesthetized dogs. Celiprolol relaxes isolated bovine tracheal muscle preparations and reduces the airway resistance in anaesthetized cats infused with serotonin. The intrinsic chronotropic effects of celiprolol in cat atria in vitro and in reserpinized rats in vivo and the relaxing effects of celiprolol in isolated bovine tracheal muscles are antagonized by propranolol, and therefore these actions may be explained by the ISA of celiprolol. However the vascular relaxing effects of celiprolol in vitro and in vivo and the bronchodilating effects in the serotonin-infused cat are not blocked by propranolol. In order to obtain a more precise characterization of these surprising effects, further pharmacological investigations were done. In the isolated femoral artery of the dog the concentration-response curve of calcium chloride is not influenced by celiprolol while it is antagonized by verapamil. A serotonin antagonistic effect cannot be demonstrated for celiprolol either in receptor binding studies or on the blood pressure of anaesthetized dogs. Celiprolol inhibits the methacholine bronchospasm in rats and the prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced bronchoconstriction in cats. The histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in dogs is scarcely affected by celiprolol while it is enhanced by propranolol. In radioligand studies celiprolol shows a tenfold higher affinity for alpha-2 in comparison to alpha-1 receptors. Celiprolol enhances the inhibitory effect of clonidine in the electrically stimulated vas deferens of the rat in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "45": "Subconjunctival injection of 0.2 ml of the following solutions was carried out once a day for two weeks in the albino and pigmented rabbit: commercial 0.5% timolol or 1% befunolol ophthalmic solutions, both containing benzalkonium chloride, and also these drug solutions containing no preservative, ophthalmic base solutions containing benzalkonium chloride, physiological saline solution or phosphate buffer solution. One week after daily injections of the commercial drug solutions or base solutions with benzalkonium chloride, the electroretinogram (ERG) showed a marked reduction in the a- and b-wave amplitudes in the pigmented rabbit, but the ERG changes were slight in the albino rabbit. After two weeks of injections, histological studies of the pigmented rabbit eyes revealed retinal detachment, visual cell loss and atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid; the changes in the albino rabbit eyes were minimal. Injections of the beta-blockers containing no benzalkonium resulted in no significant changes in the ERG or in the tissue structures of all rabbits. Injections of only physiological saline or phosphate buffer had no deleterious effects. Therefore, the ocular toxicity of the beta-blockers was thought to be minor and the toxic effects seen in this study were thought to be due to benzalkonium chloride, which possibly accumulates in the ocular pigments.",

The ligands examined are selective for the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. Of the ligands examined, the results indicate that only (R) 3H-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) localized in the pancreas by the receptor-mediated mechanism. The % dose/g tissue, the pancreas-to-blood and pancreas-to-liver ratios are such that a 18F-labeled derivative of QNB should provide images of the pancreas.",

The pharmacokinetics of bufuralol were studied in 10 healthy subjects (7 extensive and 3 poor metabolizers of debrisoquine) after oral and intravenous administration. In extensive metabolizers the systemic availability of bufuralol was 43%. Poor metabolizers were characterized by a considerable increase in systemic availability due to a corresponding decrease in hepatic first-pass metabolism. After oral administration of bufuralol non-linear kinetics may occur.", 
    "48": "The clinical drug armamentarium has been markedly expanded in recent years providing the physician with an increasing choice of antiarrhythmic agents to treat the needs of particular patients. Individually guided therapy is still the hallmark in the use of antiarrhythmic drugs, particularly with the wide variability of efficacy and toxicity and differing mechanisms of pharmacoelectrophysiological actions. The newest of the class I antiarrhythmic agents, the so-called: 'cainides' (Ic) appear to be particularly useful in testing the hypothesis that stabilisation of electrical instability may be an important goal if the high rate of sudden cardiac death is to be prevented. From the new tools available to the investigator (electrophysiological and Holter models, and many new antiarrhythmic agents), new approaches to the prevention of sudden death will emerge (Horowitz and Morganroth, 1982).", 
    "49": "The sympathomimetic amines tested, including those of alpha and beta type, were all ineffective in arousing melanosome aggregation within dermal and epidermal melanophores of the siluroid catfish, Parasilurus asotus. Conversely, these amines unfailingly gave rise to a dispersion of the pigment. While alpha-adrenergic blocking agents had only a little influence, beta agents exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on the pigment-dispersing action of the amines. Electrical nervous stimulation failed to bring about a melanosome dispersion. It was concluded that the adrenoceptors possessed by dermal and epidermal melanophores of this species seemed to be solely of the beta-adrenergic type, mediating the pigment dispersion, and that the endogenous amines involved in the darkening reaction of animals may originate in adrenal chromaffin cells, and thus are not derived from the peripheral nervous elements.", 
    "50": "The effects of two-week treatment periods with indenolol (I) and metoprolol (M) were examined by 24-hour mean blood pressure (BP) monitoring in control conditions and during exercise stress test in 7 patients with essential hypertension, using the Oxford method. Both drugs induced a significant reduction in mean BP and heart rate (HR) as compared to pretreatment values (mean BP: from 117 +/- 3 mmHg to 106 +/- 4 after I, p less than 0.05 and to 102 +/- 3 after M, p less than 0.01; HR: from 78 +/- 2 bpm to 66 +/- 2 after I, p less than 0.01 and to 67 +/- 2 after M, p less than 0.01). I and M induced a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic BP throughout the day and most of the night. During bicycle ergometer the basal and peak values of systolic and diastolic BP were significantly lower after both treatments as compared to the pretreatment values (both p less than 0.01). Our data suggest that I once a day possesses a substantial and consistent antihypertensive action, effective over most of the 24 hours.", 
    "51": "The present paper reviews our recent studies set up to define the role of sympathetic and vagal nervous influences on blood pressure variability. Blood pressure and its variability was measured in men by Arteriosonde or by Portometer (the latter recording 12 hours ambulatory blood pressure) and in the dog by intraarterial recordings. It was shown that sympathetic nerves do not influence variability as no change was seen with drugs acting on either beta (atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol) or alpha adrenergic receptors (prazosin, phentolamine, guanfacine). Also no correlation was found with plasma catecholamines or sympathetic function tests. By contrast, clear inhibition was demonstrated with atropine indicating an important role of vagal nerves on variability. However, in men, inhibition was not complete with atropine; thus, also other mechanisms play a role but these are, at present, largely unknown.", 
    "52": "The affinities of drugs for the postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the dog saphenous vein were examined and compared with those in human platelets or in rat brain. The pA2 or pD2 values in the vein were determined in the presence of phenoxybenzamine. The pKi values (dissociation constant) of drugs for binding to alpha 2-adrenoceptors in human platelets or in rat brain were determined by radioligand binding assay using 3H-yohimbine (YOH) or 3H-clonidine (CLO) as ligands. The binding of agonists to 3H-YOH binding sites was carried out in the presence of GTP. The pA2 or pD2 values in the vein had a good correlation with pKi values for YOH sites but not with those for CLO sites in rat brain. The pKi values for YOH sites in human platelets had a good correlation with those for YOH sites in the brain or with pA2 or pD2 values in the vein. These results suggested that the affinities of adrenergic drugs for postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the dog saphenous vein are similar to those in brain and in platelets, and it is probable that the adrenergic drugs produce their alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated effects on vascular tissues primarily through binding to a low-affinity form of the alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "53": "The cardioselectivity and specificity of diacetolol, the major metabolite of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug acebutolol, was studied in the isolated right atrium of the guinea-pig and rat and the papillary muscle and trachea of the guinea-pig. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking potency of diacetolol is about ten times lower than that of acebutolol. Like acebutolol, diacetolol was a more effective isoprenaline antagonist in the heart than in the trachea, thus showing relative cardioselectivity. The high water solubility of diacetolol and acebutolol led to a much faster disappearance of the beta-blockade after washout than the blockade by the lipid soluble agents propranolol and penbutolol. Like acebutolol, diacetolol had a weak intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Cardiac depressant effects, e.g. decrease of maximum upstroke velocity and duration of the action potential and reduction in force of contraction, occurred with concentrations 100-1000 times higher than those needed for beta-blockade, thus indicating relative specificity.", 
    "54": "Assessment of optimal beta blockade in treating patients with angina pectoris remains a challenge. Reduction in resting heart rate is a poor guide to therapy; the dose response curves are flat and drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may not lower resting heart rates despite their efficacy. Log plasma concentrations of beta blockers correlate with reduction in exercise tachycardia but not with improvement in exercise tolerance of reduction in myocardial ischaemia. Although useful, reduction in frequency of anginal attacks and nitroglycerin consumption during therapy is a poor guide in assessing optimal beta blockade. The best way to assess optimal therapy is to demonstrate maximum increase in exercise performance in association with reduction in myocardial ischaemia and adequate suppression of exercise-induced increase in heart rate and blood pressure. This requires repeated exercise testing at multiple work loads after various doses of the drug until there is no further increase in exercise duration or reduction in heart rate. When given in optimal and equipotent doses all beta blockers are equally effective antianginal agents and can be prescribed twice daily.", 
    "55": "Beta adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the symptomatic management of angina pectoris. This paper examines critically the possible influence of the ancillary properties of beta 1 selectivity, partial agonism and membrane-stabilizing action on the response in anginal patients. The response is categorized according to experimental, pharmacological and clinical endpoints, placing emphasis on the possible errors which may arise from extrapolation from the former to the latter. It is concluded: That selective beta adrenoceptor antagonism confers limited, but tangible advantages over non-selective antagonists in regard to patients with reversible airways obstruction, and also in the metabolic and haemodynamic response to acute hypoglycaemia. Cardioselectivity does not influence the central haemodynamic response to exercise, but lessens adrenaline-mediated hypertensive responses to smoking and hypoglycaemia. Non-selective partial agonists cause less reduction in resting ventricular function, but their effects on cardiac output during exercise are indistinguishable from full antagonists. Membrane stabilizing properties have a marked influence on the tolerability of these agents in terms of unwanted, nonspecific central nervous system symptoms. Unresolved questions relate to the influence of partial agonism on fatigue, metabolic responses, especially blood lipids and glucose, and the possibility of lesser efficacy in angina compared to full antagonists.", 
    "56": "Thyroid gland volume, ultrasonically determined, and thyroid function were investigated in 40 patients with chronic renal failure (33 of these on hemodialysis) and 40 sex-, age- and weight-matched healthy controls. None had thyroid autoantibodies or a clinically detectable goiter. The median thyroid gland volume was significantly elevated in the uremic patients: 24 ml (range 8-43 ml) compared with the healthy controls 17 ml (range 10-22 ml) (p less than 0.005). The serum concentrations of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine index (FT4I) and free triiodothyronine index (FT3I) were significantly decreased in uremic subjects compared with the controls. The serum concentration of thyrotropin did not differ significantly between patients and controls. None of the thyroid function variables correlated with thyroid gland volume. In conclusion, thyroid gland volume was increased in patients with chronic renal failure. The alterations in thyroid hormone concentrations could, however, not explain this finding.", 
    "57": "Four effects of nomifensine were studied in interaction with a dopamine receptor blocker (pimozide) and a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker (propranolol). The effects of nomifensine were divided into two categories: 1. Psychomotor stimulant effect a) Stimulation of locomotor activity in mice b) Stereotyped behavior in rats 2. Antidepressant effect a) Antagonism of hypothermia caused by reserpine in mice b) Potentiation of yohimbine-induced toxicity in mice. The psychomotor stimulant effects were antagonized by pimozide but not by propranolol. The antidepressant effects were antagonized by propranolol but not by pimozide. Our results support the hypothesis that nomifensine acts via both dopaminergic and noradrenergic mechanisms subserving distinct behavioral effects, psychomotor stimulant and antidepressant, respectively.", 
    "58": "In 49 untreated essential hypertensives the effects of the loop diuretic, piretanide, in a dose of 12 mg daily (n = 14) and of 6 mg daily (n = 18) as well as of beta blockers (pindolol, metipranolol, atenolol, n = 17) on blood pressure, intracellular Ca++ and Na+ activity in red blood cells were examined. Intracellular ion activities were measured by ion-selective electrodes. The higher dose of piretanide caused a decrease of intracellular Ca++ activity and an increase of intracellular Na+ activity. Under the lower dose of piretanide there was a comparable decrease of intracellular Ca++ activity but no significant change of intracellular Na+ activity. Beta blockers decreased intracellular Ca++ activity but left intracellular Na+ activity unchanged. It is concluded that intracellular free Ca++ plays an important role in the regulation of vascular tone in essential hypertension. There seems to be no direct relation between intracellular free Na+ and blood pressure under antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "59": "Acebutolol and propranolol were compared in forty-five Black African patients in a double-blind randomized trial carried out at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital in Kaduna, Nigeria. After a wash-out period of 6 weeks, including placebo administration for the last 4 of those weeks, twenty-seven patients were given acebutolol once daily and eighteen were given propranolol twice daily for 12 weeks, followed by a tapering-off period of 2 weeks, making a total of 14 weeks on active treatment. The two beta-receptor blocking drugs were effective in controlling hypertension with final daily doses ranging from 160 to 320 mg in the propranolol group and 400 to 800 mg in the acebutolol group. The supine systolic blood pressure responses with acebutolol were statistically significant and better than those elicited by propranolol. Acebutolol produced less (resting) bradycardia than did propranolol; this may be related to acebutolol's intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The only unpleasant side-effects reported in this study were slight dizziness in two patients treated with propranolol and slight tiredness in one patient treated with acebutolol. No significant abnormal changes were noted in laboratory tests or chest X-rays. Electrocardiography detected supraventricular tachyarrythmia in five patients: this disappeared by the end of the study. Acebutolol was shown to be a safe, effective and reliable antihypertensive drug, at least comparable to and probably slightly better than, propranolol in the treatment of hypertension in Black Nigerians. It has the added advantage of a once-daily dose schedule.",

    "62": "51 hypertensive outpatients, whose diastolic blood pressure exceeded 100 mmHg after a 2-week period on atenolol alone (100 mg once daily) participated in this long-term study. They received, in addition to atenolol, the vasodilator cadralazine (ISF 2469; 10 to 30 mg once daily) for a standard period of 24 weeks, according to an open design. Cadralazine caused a progressive and important decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, from 173/111 mmHg (end of atenolol alone) to 154/99 mmHg (12th week, p less than 0.01/p less than 0.01; mean dose, 24.5 mg/day). At this time a diuretic was added as a third-step drug in 15/51 initial patients (29%), and final blood pressure in all patients was 150/96 mmHg (p less than 0.01/p less than 0.01), with positive results in 88% of the cases. During cadralazine treatment, heart rate was always significantly lower than before atenolol alone; the most common side effects, many of which were already present during treatment with atenolol alone, included headache, asthenia, dizziness, palpitation and flushing, and tended to disappear spontaneously as therapy progressed. Routine laboratory tests did not show important changes; sodium excretion was not reduced. In conclusion, the therapeutic efficacy of cadralazine, its low or absent salt and water retention effects, its good tolerability, and the high compliance obtained with once daily administration allowed the use of this vasodilator as a second-step drug for long-term treatment of hypertension.", 
    "63": "For further elucidation of the effect of various beta-adrenoceptor blockers on metabolism during exercise investigations on the influence of 5 beta-adrenoceptor blockers were carried out in healthy subjects. The 5 beta-adrenoreceptor blockers (acebutolol, metoprolol, penbutolol, pindolol, propranolol) were different regarding cardioselectivity and intrinsic activity (ISA). Each substance was given in 4 different dosages corresponding to 10:20:40:80 mg propranolol. Exercise was performed as bicycle ergometer test over 1 hour. In order to find out different effects during long-term application a medium dosage corresponding to 40 mg propranolol was applied for 4 weeks after the acute trials. The following parameters were measured: heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, parameters of carbohydrate metabolism (glucose, lactate) as well as lipid metabolism (free fatty acids (FFA), cholesterol, triglycerides etc.), serum concentration; for three beta-adrenoceptor blockers hormonal concentrations (catecholamines, insulin, human growth hormone (HGH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH] were assessed. The different beta-adrenoceptor blockers demonstrated a varying relation between dosage and effect which was mostly pronounced for propranolol. All beta-adrenoceptor blockers caused a nearly complete blockade of energy release from FFA, and serum glucose concentration decreased. These changes were smaller under the effect of a low dosage of the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker metoprolol. The hormonal concentrations demonstrated a more pronounced increase of epinephrine during beta-blockade in contrast to only small changes by norepinephrine. Whereas there was no effect to be found on ACTH, HGH increased significantly under beta-blockade but independent of cardioselectivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Clinicians should therefore be knowledgeable and attentive to early signs and symptoms of toxicity in order to optimize the risk:benefit ratio when using this class of drugs. A number of pharmacokinetic interactions with specific implications for digitalis toxicity have recently been delineated. Serious cardiac rhythm disturbances should initially be treated with lidocaine or phenytoin. Digitalis toxicity resistant to conventional measures may now be treated with digoxin-specific Fab fragments.", 
    "65": "In summary it appears that beta 2-blockade does not lower high blood pressure. Beta 1-blockade seems to be the necessary feature for the antihypertensive effect. Beta 1 ISA may attenuate the blood pressure lowering efficacy. Finally beta 2 ISA causes a favourable hemodynamic pattern in which the blood pressure lowering occurs mainly through vasodilatation. The ideal beta-blocker for hypertension should cause beta 1-blockade. It should not cause beta 2-blockade and it should possess relatively pronounced beta 2 ISA.", 
    "66": "Carvedilol (BM14190) is a new compound with combined properties of nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade, devoid of ISA, and precapillary vasodilatation. Its acute hemodynamic effects were studied with invasive technique (dye-dilution using Cardio-Green) in 10 patients taking 25 mg orally and noninvasive (fore-arm plethysmography) in 10 patients taking 25 mg and in 10 patients taking 50 mg orally, all with essential hypertension. Significant reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p less than 0.05 - 0.001) were observed in all groups. TPR did not change acutely whereas resistance in the fore-arm was reduced by 16% (p less than 0.05). When a comparison with propranolol (80 mgx2) was made in a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial comprising 30 patients with essential hypertension, carvedilol acutely reduced blood pressure significantly 13/6 mm Hg (25 mg) and 17/10 mm Hg (50 mg) in contrast to propranolol. Resistance in the fore-arm (plethysmography) fell significantly with carvedilol 50 mg whereas propranolol caused a significant rise. After 4 weeks both compounds had reduced blood pressure significantly and to the same extent. Blood flow was still reduced with propranolol in contrast to the findings with carvedilol. We conclude that carvedilol given orally has a useful antihypertensive effect both acutely and during prolonged treatment. It has an attractive hemodynamic profile.", 
    "67": "The effect of somatostatin on pepsin secretion was determined in six dogs with gastric fistulas during stimulation with bethanechol. Somatostatin inhibited dose-dependently the stimulated pepsin secretion, with a dose of 0.3 micrograms/kg/h being 35% inhibitory during stimulation with bethanechol, 80 micrograms/kg/h. Continuous infusion of somatostatin for 3 h did not cause any signs of tachyphylaxis. Withdrawal of somatostatin produced a return to the control level. The dose-response kinetics with five doses of bethanechol with and without somatostatin showed inhibition of a noncompetitive type. The effects of somatostatin were not altered by using adrenergic, dopaminergic, or serotonergic blocking drugs.", 
    "68": "The metabolic and circulatory consequences of activation of the muscarinic receptor(s) were investigated by local administration of acetylcholine and its three analogues (bethanechol, carbachol and methacholine) into beating and KCl-arrested perfused rat hearts. Acetylcholine and the three other choline esters caused vasoconstriction in both types of preparations and this vasoconstriction was accompanied by a decrease in oxygen consumption. In most cases the dose-response curves were biphasic and changes in coronary flow paralleled those in oxygen consumption. Both phenomena were abolished by administration of atropine and either removal of calcium or infusion of verapamil but were unaffected by addition of the adrenergic alpha-blocker, prazosin, and the adrenergic beta-blocker, propranolol. Infusions of low concentrations of the cholinergic agonists were accompanied by increases in the myocardial phosphorylation state ratio [( ATP]free/[ADP]free[Pi]) which correlated with the simultaneous decreases in oxygen consumption and coronary flow. It is suggested that muscarinic receptors responsible for vasoconstriction in perfused rat heart are located not only on coronary vessels but also on the cardiac muscle cells. Activation of the former receptors induces vasoconstriction by direct action on the vascular smooth muscle while activation of the latter receptors induces vasoconstriction indirectly by decreasing cardiac work and increasing the myocardial [ATP]free/[ADP]free[Pi] ratio. The results also show that stimulation of muscarinic receptor(s) and the consequent metabolic and vasoregulatory responses are coupled to calcium movements.", 
    "69": "Hemodynamic studies have demonstrated a significantly reduced beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulating effect of prenalterol compared to dobutamine suggesting a partial agonism on the receptor. In order to prove this hypothesis we administered 80 micrograms/kg of prenalterol within 5 minutes in 8 healthy volunteers during a continuous infusion of dobutamine (15 micrograms/kg/min). In addition to heart rate, blood pressure and the double product, the systolic time intervals QS2I, PEP and LVET and the echocardiographically determined parameters FS and Vcf were measured for evaluation of ventrical function. The injection of prenalterol caused a distinct attenuation of the cardiostimulating effects of dobutamine: there was a prompt fall in heart rate and systolic blood pressure and a typical negative inotropic effect on the parameters of left ventricular function. In the experimental conditions selected, the effects of prenalterol were those of a beta-sympatholoytic agent. Prenalterol should therefore be classified as a partial beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist or as a beta-blocking agent with pronounced intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The beta 1-stimulating potency of prenalterol amounts to about 60% of a full agonist.", 
    "70": "In the present study the effect of methoxamine and its modification by several adrenergic antagonists is described in the isolated oestrogenized rat uterus. Methoxamine produced a dose-related increase in uterine activity, prazosin produced a rightward displacement of the dose-response curve of methoxamine reaching the same maximal effect. Yohimbine abolished the contractile response to methoxamine. propranolol or reserpine failed to modify the effect of methoxamine. Pretreatment with reserpine abolished the inhibitory effect of yohimbine. These results suggest the presence of excitatory alpha-adrenoceptors in the rat uterus.", 
    "71": "Nine normotensive healthy females received timolol 5 mg daily for a 4-day period and subsequently 20 mg daily for another 4-day period. None of the two dosages of timolol caused significant changes in serum uric acid or 24-h urinary fractional excretion of uric acid. Thus the increments of serum uric acid previously found in hypertensive patients is not likely to be caused by beta-adrenoceptor blockade per se.", 
    "72": "Ten healthy subjects whose genetic oxidative phenotype had been determined (6 extensive and 4 poor metabolizers of the debrisoquine-sparteine type of polymorphism) received single oral doses of 3 beta-blockers: atenolol, bopindolol and metoprolol. The plasma concentrations and the extent of the decrease in exercise-induced tachycardia were determined. The oxidative polymorphism was only significant for substances that had a high hepatic first pass metabolism, such as metoprolol. The metabolic pathway under genetic control was highly stereoselective. This observation must be taken into account when assessing the relation between the plasma concentration and effect of these drugs, which are often administered as racemic mixtures."
