    "0": "The Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) Trial is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, parallel-group, two-arm, actively controlled, multicenter, international 5-year clinical trial involving 15,000 patients. CONVINCE will compare the incidence of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular-disease-related death in two antihypertensive treatment regimens. One treatment arm begins with controlled onset-extended release (COER)-verapamil, which has its major antihypertensive effect 6-12 hours after administration. The other arm (standard of care (SOC)) begins with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or atenolol, one of which is preselected by the investigator for an individual patient prior to randomization. Secondary objectives include comparisons of the regimens for each of the components of the primary endpoint (separately), death or hospitalization related to cardiovascular disease, efficacy in lowering blood pressure to goal, primary events occurring between 6 am and noon, all-cause mortality, withdrawals from blinded therapy, cancer, and hospitalizations due to bleeding. Patients may be enrolled if they are hypertensive and at least 55 years of age and have an established second risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Initial medications include COER-verapamil (180 mg/d), HCTZ (12.5 mg/d), or atenolol (50 mg/d). Initial doses are doubled if blood pressure (BP) does not reach goal (systolic BP < 140 mm and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If BP is not controlled by the higher dose of the initial medication, HCTZ is added to COER-verapamil, or the SOC choice not initially selected is added in the SOC arm. An ACE-inhibitor is recommended (although nearly any open-label medication is allowed) as the third step for patients whose BP is not adequately controlled or who have a contraindication to one of the two SOC medications. Patients take two sets of tablets daily, one in the morning and one in the evening. Although most patients switch from an established antihypertensive medication to randomized treatment, untreated patients with stages I-III hypertension (SBP between 140 and 190 or DBP between 90 and 110 mm Hg) are eligible. Outcomes are monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Enrollment began during the third quarter of 1996, and follow-up is to be completed in the third quarter of 2002.", 
    "1": "Although we have several established in vitro systems for studying the vasoactive properties of the ocular vasculature, the restricted availability of human donor tissue has forced us to rely predominantly on animal studies.", 
    "2": "The present paper describes, for the first time, a controlled-rate cryopreservation technique capable of maintaining vasoactive function in human retinal arteries after extended storage.", 
    "3": "The response to constrictive (endothelin-I) and vasodilatory agents (nimodipine and betaxolol) was comparable with that in fresh pig vessels. It is now possible to obtain multiple segments of retinal artery from a single donor eye and to preserve them for detailed pharmacological assessment.", 
    "4": "The purpose of the present study was to describe patterns of glaucoma medication use among people who self-report a history of glaucoma in a population-based study of age-related eye disease.", 
    "5": "The present study was comprised of a population-based cluster stratified sample of 5000 Victorians aged 40 years and older. Participants completed an interview regarding demographic characteristics, medical history and use of medications. Participants also completed orthoptic and dilated fundus examinations, including measurement of intra-occular pressure (IOP) and visual fields. Glaucoma history and use of glaucoma medication was self reported. Glaucoma disease status was confirmed by a specialist consensus group.", 
    "6": "The most common glaucoma medications used were beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (63%), followed by sympathomimetics (18%) and cholinergic agents (16%). There were no differences in glaucoma medication use by gender, age, years since diagnosis, rural or urban residence or a history of glaucoma surgery. Among participants using medication, 16.1% exceeded 21 mmHg IOP.", 
    "7": "The high prevalence of the use of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent medication reflects the shift from the use of pilocarpine over the past 20 years. The prevalence of IOP greater than 21 mmHg highlights the difficulty in managing high IOP.", 
    "8": "Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and premature cardiovascular death. Even mild elevations of blood pressure (i.e., diastolic blood pressure >90 and <110 mm Hg) yield increased risk. In fact, mild-to-moderate hypertension is more common than severe hypertension and accounts for a greater proportion of the deaths and serious nonfatal vascular events. The treatment goal is to make optimal use of antihypertensive drug therapy while encouraging patients to implement lifestyle changes such as weight loss, sodium restriction, decreased alcohol intake, and increased exercise. Pharmacologic therapy of mild-to-moderate hypertension can significantly reduce the incidence of stroke, MI, coronary artery disease, vascular mortality, and total mortality. Beta blockers and diuretics should continue to be used as first-line therapy until there is direct and reliable evidence from large-scale randomized trials with clinical endpoints for newer agents such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "9": "To assess levels of compliance in elderly patients on timolol eyedrops for glaucoma.", 
    "10": "A postal questionnaire was sent from the general practitioner to 86 patients over 55 years of age on repeat prescriptions for timolol eyedrops. The questionnaire asked details about the duration of treatment, family history, the level of understanding of the disease and the importance of treatment, other regular medication, side-effects attributed to the drops and how often patients omitted their drops. A search of practice and local hospital dispensing data was carried out to assess how frequently monthly repeat prescriptions for timolol eyedrops were dispensed over a 12 month period. This allowed a total volume to be calculated for each patient.", 
    "11": "Twenty-four per cent of patients admitted to omitting eyedrops either occasionally or frequently. Fifty-one per cent were found to have had insufficient drops dispensed to comply with treatment as prescribed. In non-complaint patients the mean period without drops was 85 days of the year, with a maximum of 165 days.", 
    "12": "Compliance with treatment is poor and patients underestimate their level of defaulting when questioned.", 
    "13": "Brain death-induced haemodynamic collapse in rats is not caused by intrinsic myocardial damage as shown in the accompanying paper. We investigated whether this collapse could be caused by the withdrawal of the basal adrenergic tone.", 
    "14": "Heart rate and blood pressure variability was studied in rats before and after brain death. The effect of high doses of phentolamine, propranolol or their combination administered before or after brain death was assessed.", 
    "15": "Heart rate variability in the respiratory frequency range significantly increased, whereas in the low-frequency range it tended to decrease after brain death. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure variability up to 0.18 Hz largely disappeared, but stayed unchanged in the respiratory frequency range. High-dose combined phentolamine and propranolol pretreatment induced a haemodynamic picture comparable to the situation seen after brain death without pharmacological intervention. Brain death did not further deteriorate the haemodynamic situation after combined pretreatment. On the other hand, once the haemodynamic collapse after brain death had settled, adrenergic blockade had no important influence any more.", 
    "16": "We conclude that the haemodynamic situation seen after brain death is one of profound sympathetic withdrawal.", 
    "17": "A peptide with neurotoxic effect on mammals, purified from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, was studied regarding its primary structure and its effects on voltage-gated calcium channels. The peptide, named \u03c9-phonetoxin-IIA, has 76 amino acids residues, with 14 Cys forming 7 disulphide bonds, and a molecular weight of 8362.7 Da. The neurotoxicity is a consequence of the peptide\u2019s blocking effects on high-voltage-activated (HVA) calcium channels. N-type HVA calcium channels of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons are blocked with affinity in the sub-nanomolar concentration range. The toxin also blocks L-type channels of rat \u03b2 pancreatic cells, with an affinity 40 times lower. Although not studied in detail, evidence indicates that the toxin also blocks other types of HVA calcium channels, such as P and Q. No effect was observed on low-voltage-activated, T-type calcium channels. The significant homologies between \u03c9-phonetoxin-IIA and the peptides of the \u03c9-agatoxin-III family, and the overlapping inhibitory effects on calcium channels are discussed in terms of the structure-activity relationship.", 
    "18": "No data are available for the direct effect of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) on atrioventricular (AV) conduction in mammalian hearts. Thus we studied the dromotropic effects of CNP-22 injected into the AV node artery in autonomically decentralized hearts in open-chest, anesthetized dogs. CNP decreased AV interval (AV conduction time) in a dose-dependent manner with increase in coronary artery blood flow rate in six anesthetized dogs. Isosorbide dinitrate did not affect AV interval, but it increased coronary artery blood flow rate. A guanylyl cyclase-linked natriuretic peptide receptor antagonist, HS-142-1, inhibited the decreases in AV interval and the increases in coronary blood flow rate in response to CNP, whereas propranolol did not affect the positive dromotropic response to CNP. These results demonstrate that CNP decreases AV interval and increases coronary artery blood flow rate mediated by a guanylyl cyclase-linked natriuretic peptide receptor, but not beta-adrenoceptor, in the dog heart.", 
    "19": "The translocation mechanisms involved in the alpha1-adrenoceptor-stimulated efflux of the potassium analog 86Rb+ were studied in isolated rat hearts. Phenylephrine (in the presence of a beta-blocker) increased the efflux of 86Rb+ and 42K+, and the Na-K-2Cl (or K-Cl) cotransport inhibitor bumetanide reduced the response by 42 +/- 11%. Furosemide inhibited the response with a lower potency than that of bumetanide. The bumetanide-insensitive efflux was largely sensitive to the K+ channel inhibitor 4-aminopyridine. Inhibitors of the Na+/H+ exchanger or the Na+-K+ pump had no effect on the increased 86Rb+ efflux. The activation of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter was dependent on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subgroup of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family. Phenylephrine stimulation increased ERK activity 3.4-fold. PD-98059, an inhibitor of the ERK cascade, reduced both the increased 86Rb+ efflux and ERK activity. Specific inhibitors of protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II had no effect. In conclusion, alpha1-adrenoceptor stimulation increases 86Rb+ efflux from the rat heart via K+ channels and a Na-K-2Cl cotransporter. Activation of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter is apparently dependent on the MAP kinase pathway.", 
    "20": "The electrophysiology of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with and without hypertrophy has not been characterized. The alpha1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine induced hypertrophy in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. After 48 h of exposure to 20 microM phenylephrine, cell surface area of hypertrophied myocytes was 44% larger than control. Action potential duration was significantly longer in hypertrophy than in control. There was an increase in L-type Ca2+ current in control after 48 h in culture, but current density was significantly less in hypertrophy (-4.7 +/- 0.8 hypertrophy vs. -10.7 +/- 1.2 control pA/pF, n = 22, P < 0.05). T-type Ca2+ current density was not different. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist prazosin blocked the hypertrophy and the chronic effect of phenylephrine on L-type Ca2+ current. Transient outward K+ current density was decreased 70% in hypertrophy and was blocked with 4-aminopyridine. No change in Na+ current density was observed. Staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, eliminated the hypertrophy and the effect on L-type Ca2+ current. These studies showed that phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy occurred via the alpha1-adrenergic pathway and caused electrophysiological changes and effects on ion channel expression.", 
    "21": "The objectives of this study were 1) to determine whether ANG II-induced myocardial damage (ANG Dam) is mediated via the beta1-adrenergic receptor, 2) to elucidate whether adrenal medulla or cardiac sympathetic neuron catecholamines are responsible for ANG Dam, and 3) to determine whether the lack of damage after 3 days of elevated ANG II levels is due to beta1-receptor downregulation. To this end, ANG II was administered to rats 1) that were treated with a beta-receptor blocker, 2) after adrenal medullectomy and/or cardiac sympathectomy, and 3) for 3 or 8 days. ANG II caused both myocyte necrosis and coronary vascular damage after adrenal medullectomy but not after cardiac sympathectomy. There was a 38 and 55% decrease in beta-receptor density after 3 and 8 days, respectively, of ANG II infusion, and an upregulation to control levels 5 days after a 3-day ANG II infusion was stopped. We conclude that cardiac sympathetic neuron catecholamines are responsible for ANG Dam and that the acute nature of this damage is associated with a downregulation of beta1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "22": "To report a case of glaucomatocyclitic crisis (Posner-Schlossman syndrome) in a child.", 
    "23": "Case report. A 13-year-old boy presented with decreased vision, photophobia, halos, and pain in the right eye.", 
    "24": "Findings in this child were consistent with a diagnosis of Posner-Schlossman syndrome.", 
    "25": "Glaucomatocyclitic crisis can occur in a child and must be included in the differential diagnosis of uveitis and glaucoma in pediatric patients.", 
    "26": "The prehypertrophic state of hypertensive heart disease is characterized by morphologic changes (interstitial fibrosis, increase in intramyocardial arteriolar wall thickness) as well as by functional alterations (diastolic dysfunction, decrease in coronary reserve). These changes most probably represent the earliest cardiac end-organ lesions that can clinically be detected. In cardiac hypertrophy, long-term (9-12 months) pharmacotherapy with beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or ACE inhibitors reverses left ventricular hypertrophy by 8% to 14%, whereas marked improvement in coronary reserve and diastolic dysfunction is achieved by calcium blocker and preferably by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "27": "In spontaneously beating, isolated guinea pig sinus-atria, veratramine (2.44 microM) slowed the rate of spontaneous depolarization of sinoatrial node cells throughout diastole, markedly slowed the frequency, and often (especially in the presence of high extracellular Ca2+) induced a periodic rhythm. This rhythm consisted of periods of complete inactivity (inactive phases) alternating with periods of apparently normal beating (active phases), with a rising and falling (parabolic) frequency pattern like that of neuronal burst firing. Slight mechanical deformation of the sinoatrial node markedly attenuated the effects of veratramine, and periodic rhythm could not be produced when the sinoatrial node was pinned down for immobilization. During the active phase of periodic rhythm, the rate of spontaneous diastolic depolarization (pacemaker potential) in pacemaker cells rose and fell with the frequency, while contrariwise, the maximum rate of depolarization fell and then rose. The last beat in the active phase was followed by a small transient afterdepolarization, which had the appearance of an abortive pacemaker potential that failed to reach threshold for triggering an action potential. The effects of various programs of electrical stimulation and pacing indicated that activity of the sinoatrial node, whether spontaneous or driven, has two effects on the amplitude of afterdepolarization, a short-lasting cumulative facilitory effect and a long-lasting cumulative inhibitory effect. Veratramine periodic rhythm arises from the interplay of these two effects, with abrupt cessation of beating whenever the afterdepolarization amplitude falls below the threshold for triggering an action potential. It is suggested that the inhibitory effect may be due to inactivation of the slow inward current and the facilitory effect may be due to one or more of the depolarizing currents activated by intracellular Ca2+.", 
    "28": "The goal of treating hypertension is to maximize therapeutic efficacy without untoward side effects. The accepted approach is to start treatment with a low dose of a single drug and then titrate it upward as needed to achieve a better therapeutic effect. However, higher doses of administered individual drugs increase the frequency and severity of side effects. A rational combination of individual drugs administered in low doses is preferable because it is associated with a high degree of efficacy, low incidence or severity of side effects, and high patient compliance. The most commonly used drug combinations are as follows: (1) diuretics with potassium-sparing agents; (2) beta-adrenergic blockers with diuretics; (3) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with diuretics; (4) angiotensin II receptor blockers with diuretics; and (5) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with calcium-channel blockers.", 
    "29": "Biotransformation of metoprolol to alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (HM) and O-demethylmetoprolol (ODM) is mediated by CYP2D6. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are known to inhibit CYP2D6. The aim was to study in vitro the potential inhibitory effect of SSRIs on metoprolol biotransformation.", 
    "30": "Using microsomes from two human livers, biotransformation of metoprolol to alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (HM) and O-demethylmetoprolol (ODM) as a function of the concentrations of the SSRIs and of some of their metabolites was studied.", 
    "31": "The kinetics of the formation of both metabolites are best described by a biphasic enzyme model. The estimated values of Vmax and kM for the high affinity site are for the alpha-hydroxylation in human liver HL-1 32 pmol mg(-1) min(-1) and 75 micromol x l(-1) respectively, and in human liver HL-9 39 pmol mg(-1) x min(-1) and 70 micromol x l(-1) respectively; for the O-demethylation in HL-1 131 pmol mg(-1) min(-1) and 95 micromol x l(-1) respectively, and in HL-9 145 pmol mg(-1) min(-1) and 94 micromol x l(-1) respectively. Quinidine is for both pathways a potent inhibitor of the high-affinity site, with K(i) values ranging from 0.03 to 0.18 micromol x l(-1). Fluoxetine, norfluoxetine and paroxetine are likewise potent inhibitors, with Ki values ranging from 0.30 to 2.1 micromol x l(-1) fluvoxamine, sertraline, desmethylsertraline, citalopram and desmethylcitalopram are less potent inhibitors, with K(i) values above 10 micromol x l(-1).", 
    "32": "The rank order of the SSRIs for inhibition of metoprolol metabolism is comparable to that reported in the literature for other CYP2D6 substrates, with fluoxetine, norfluoxetine and paroxetine being the most potent. These findings need further investigation to determine their clinical relevance.", 
    "33": "The present study was conducted to identify in vitro the cytochrome P450(CYP) isoform involved in the metabolic conversion of reduced haloperidol to haloperidol using microsomes derived from human AHH-1 TK +/- cells expressing human cytochrome P450s. The inhibitory and/or stimulatory effects of reduced haloperidol or haloperidol on CYP2D6-catalyzed carteolol 8-hydroxylase activity were also investigated.", 
    "34": "The CYP isoform involved in the oxidation of reduced haloperidol to haloperidol was CYP3A4. CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1 were not involved in the oxidation. The kM value for the CYP3A4 expressed in the cells was 69.7 micromol x l(-1), and the Vmax was 4.87 pmol x min(-1) x pmol(-1) P450. Troleandomycin, a relatively selective probe for CYP3A enzymes, inhibited the CYP3A4-mediated oxidation of reduced haloperidol in a dose-dependent manner. Quinidine and sparteine competitively inhibited the oxidative reaction with a k(i) value of 24.9 and 1390 micromol x l(-1), respectively. Carteolol 8-hydroxylase activity, which is a selective reaction probe for CYP2D6 activity, was inhibited by reduced haloperidol with a k(i) value of 4.3 micromol x l(-1). Haloperidol stimulated the CYP2D6-mediated carteolol 8-hydroxylase activity with an optimum concentration of 1 micromol x l(-1), whereas higher concentrations of the compound (> 10 micromol x l(-1)) inhibited the hydroxylase activity.", 
    "35": "It was concluded that CYP3A4, not CYP2D6, is the principal isoform of cytochrome P450 involved in the metabolic conversion of reduced haloperidol to haloperidol. It was further found that reduced haloperidol is a substrate of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of CYP2D6, and that haloperidol has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on CYP2D6 activity.", 
    "36": "The efficacy of beta-adrenergic blocking agents and acetylsalicylic acid in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction has been well recognized since the beginning of the 1980s. In a previous paper, however, we reported a lower than expected use of these drugs during the period 1982 1988. In 1989 the results of this survey were presented and discussed with the prescribing physicians. In the present paper we describe the prescription patterns for the same indication and in the same centre over the following 6 years (1989-1994). We also describe the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for which efficacy in certain subgroups has been recently shown.", 
    "37": "Random samples of patients discharged from our hospital between 1989 and 1994 with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction with Q-wave were studied. Information about diagnoses, other clinical variables and treatments prescribed at discharge was obtained from the hospital discharge forms. The results were compared with those obtained in the previous study.", 
    "38": "We studied 514 patients (80% men) with a median age of 59 years (range 31-89). The proportions of patients prescribed beta-adrenergic blocking agents and acetylsalicylic acid increased from 34% and 28%, respectively, in 1986-1988, to 62% and 75% in 1989 1991. In 1994 they had reached a steady state (63% and 71%). In addition, a continued decrease in the use of calcium channel blockers was noted, from 36% in 1986-1988 to 17% in 1994. The increase in the prescription of beta-adrenergic blocking agents was especially remarkable in the subgroups for which a larger underuse was recorded in the previous study, such as the elderly. The proportion of patients prescribed an ACE inhibitor increased from 14% in 1989-1991 to 23% in 1994. In a multivariate analysis the prescription of ACE inhibitors was associated with female gender, hypertension during admission, heart failure during admission, and previous myocardial infarction. A substantial increase in the prescription of beta-adrenergic blocking agents and acetylsalicylic acid and a decrease in the prescription of calcium channel blockers was recorded between 1982 and 1994. The prescription rate of beta-adrenergic blocking agents has increased substantially in certain subgroups where underuse had been previously recorded. Most of the changes occurred in 1989-1991, and reached a steady state in 1994. In 1994 an increase in the prescription of ACE inhibitors was also recorded.", 
    "39": "The present study tested the hypothesis that changes in pancreatic islet blood flow correlate with the difference in diabetes incidence between male and female nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. The blood flows were determined by a microsphere technique. In animals aged 10 and 14 weeks, the islet blood perfusion was 3-fold higher in female NOD mice compared with that in either age-matched male NOD mice or age- and sex-matched control ICR mice. At 5 weeks of age islet blood flow was similar in all groups. No differences between male and female NOD mice in whole pancreatic, duodenal, ileal, or colonic blood flows were observed at any time point. Administration of a bolus dose of aminoguanidine (a blocker of inducible nitric oxide synthase) to 10-week-old animals selectively and markedly decreased islet blood flow in female NOD mice, whereas islet blood flow in ICR mice and male NOD mice remained unaffected. Aminoguanidine did not affect mean arterial blood pressure or whole pancreatic blood flow in any of the groups. Injection of N(G)-methyl-L-arginine, an unspecific inhibitor of both constitutive and inducible nitric oxide synthase, markedly decreased whole pancreatic and islet blood flow to the same level in both male and female NOD mice. These combined findings suggest that diabetes-prone female NOD mice have an increased islet blood flow, which is mediated by an excessive production of nitric oxide formed by inducible nitric oxide synthase. The islet blood hyperperfusion may augment homing to the pancreatic islets of inflammatory cells and soluble factors involved in beta-cell destruction during the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in this animal model. The presently observed gender difference in the blood flow response could, therefore, at least partially explain why female NOD mice are more prone to develop hyperglycemia than the males.", 
    "40": "1. Burn injury stimulates ubiquitin-dependent protein breakdown in skeletal muscle. The 20S proteasome is the proteolytic core of the 26S proteasome that degrades ubiquitin conjugates. We examined the effects of the proteasome inhibitors N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinal-L-norleucinal (LLnL), lactacystin and beta-lactone on protein breakdown in muscles from burned rats. 2. A full-thickness burn of 30% total body surface area was inflicted on the back of rats. Control rats underwent a sham procedure. After 24 h, extensor digitorum longus muscles were incubated in the absence or presence of 20S proteasome blocker and protein turnover rates and ubiquitin mRNA levels were determined. 3. LLnL resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of total protein breakdown in incubated muscles from burned rats. Lactacystin and beta-lactone blocked both total and myofibrillar muscle protein breakdown. In addition to inhibiting protein breakdown, LLnL increased ubiquitin mRNA levels, possibly reflecting inhibited proteasome-associated RNase activity. 4. Inhibited muscle protein breakdown caused by LLnL, lactacystin and beta-lactone supports the concept that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a central role in burn-induced muscle proteolysis. Because the proteasome has multiple important functions in the cell, in addition to regulating general protein breakdown, further studies are needed to test the role of proteasome blockers in the treatment or prevention of muscle catabolism.", 
    "41": "Psychiatric comorbidity complicates the accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults. This paper examines the influence of comorbidity on treatment responsiveness in ADHD adults, the neurobiological underpinnings of comorbidity, and the potential of different pharmacologic agents to address comorbid states in ADHD. A categorical schema for neurobiological classification of ADHD subtypes is integrated with literature associating specific neurotransmitters with corresponding neurobehavioral abnormalities. Dopamine, for example, is one of several neurotransmitters implicated in bipolar disorder. Serotonin and norepinephrine are implicated in major depression and anxiety disorders, while self-medication for dopamine dysfunction may relate to substance abuse. Norepinephrine and serotonin have each been linked to aggression and impulsive antisocial behaviors. The effective treatment of ADHD with comorbid psychiatric disorders requires knowledge of the neurochemical underpinnings of each disorder and expertise in the application of appropriate pharmacologic tools. Controlled studies assessing treatment outcomes for both comorbid disorders will assist in the development of improved treatment strategies for adults with complicated ADHD.", 
    "42": "Recent reports have suggested that excessive amounts of endogenous NO may contribute to the myocardial dysfunction and injury in heart failure. In the present report, we investigate the cellular expression and activity of endothelial (eNOS) and inducible (iNOS) NO synthase in failing human hearts with special reference to the underlying lesion and drug therapy.", 
    "43": "Myocardial tissues were obtained from 28 failing human hearts with various pathogeneses and 4 nonfailing hearts as controls. Only weak or focal expression of both eNOS and iNOS was seen in ventricles of nonfailing hearts. In failing hearts, immunoreactivity and hybridization signals for eNOS were increased only in cardiac myocytes of subendocardial areas. Signals for iNOS in cardiac myocytes were consistently seen in heart failure of various pathogeneses and were apparent in both infarcted and noninfarcted regions of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Apparent signals for iNOS were also seen in infiltrating macrophages in infarcted regions of ischemic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and septic hearts. The expression of eNOS but not iNOS in the myocytes was intimately associated with beta-adrenergic therapy before the operation, being more abundant in patients on beta-blockers compared with diminished presence in patients on beta-agonists. In contrast to immunohistochemical data, iNOS activity was more variable than constitutive NOS activity and correlated significantly with the density of infiltrating macrophages.", 
    "44": "These results suggest that whereas increased eNOS and/or iNOS expression in failing cardiac myocytes may in general contribute to myocardial dysfunction, myocyte injury or death associated with inflammatory lesions may be caused in part by abundant iNOS expression within infiltrating macrophages rather than cardiac myocytes.", 
    "45": "Antiarrhythmic drugs play a major role in the management of the most common types of arrhythmias. The margin between the beneficial and toxic effects of these drugs is often narrow. Thus, a precise knowledge of dosages, drug-target tissue interactions, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of antiarrhythmic drugs is needed to better predict how effective a particular drug will be in the treatment of a specific arrhythmia in a given patient. Despite the large amount of information that is available on the electrophysiological and pharmacological effects of antiarrhythmic drugs, we still do not know enough about their true mechanism of action in individual patients. The results of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) firmly established that the use of class I drugs is potentially dangerous in a specific subset of patients. Additionally, several meta-analyses have reported that quinidine has severe proarrhythmic effects in patients with atrial fibrillation. The management of arrhythmias in elderly patients is difficult because of age-related factors that may influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "46": "The effect of the serotonin1A (5-HT1A) agonist alnespirone (S-20499) on the secretion of both oxytocin and vasopressin was examined in the same conscious, unrestrained male rats. The dose-response and time-course effects on the secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin revealed that alnespirone stimulated oxytocin in a dose-dependent manner, but did not increase vasopressin secretion. Time of maximal effect following injection of alnespirone (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was as early as 15 min postinjection, with significant stimulation persisting for 30 min. Pretreatment with a low dose of the 5-HT1A/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)-pindolol (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.), 30 min prior to injection of alnespirone (0, 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) shifted the dose-response curve to the right and inhibited the effect of alnespirone on plasma oxytocin concentration. Furthermore, pretreatment with a low or a high dose of the 5-HT1A/2A/dopamine D2 antagonist spiperone (0.01 or 3 mg/kg, s.c.) dose dependently shifted the alnespirone dose-response curve effect of alnespirone to the right. None of these drugs, alone or in combination, altered plasma vasopressin levels. These studies suggest that 5-HT1A receptor mechanisms mediate the effect of alnespirone on the secretion of oxytocin. Furthermore, these studies suggest that 5-HT1A receptor mechanisms do not participate in the serotonergic regulation of vasopressin secretion.", 
    "47": "The ocular hypotensive and vasodilative effects of vaninolol and eugenolol, two beta-adrenergic blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, were tested in rabbits and their pharmacologic mechanisms were also studied in vitro.", 
    "48": "Intraocular pressure was measured in ocular hypertonic rabbits which were induced by infusing 20% NaCl or 5% glucose solution. The rabbit's ocular blood flow was determined using the colored microsphere technique. The concentrations of cAMP were evaluated in porcine ciliary body and cultured A7r5 smooth muscle cells by radioimmunoassay. Ca+2 concentration was measured in A7r5 cells by spectrofluorometry after loading cells with Fura-2-AM.", 
    "49": "It was found that 0.5% eugenolol and vaninolol could suppress the intraocular pressure in glucose-induced ocular hypertensive rabbits and delay the intraocular pressure recovery in NaCl-induced ocular hypertensive rabbits. In addition, both agents improved the ocular blood flow in the iris, ciliary body, retina and choroid. Vaninolol and eugenolol of 10 microM inhibited the basal cAMP accumulation from 23.9 +/- 2.0 of control to 8.7 +/- 0.4 and 2.4 +/- 0.1 respectively and inhibited the isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation from 154.3 +/- 13.6 to 120.6 +/- 8.3 and 74.2 +/- 6.1 respectively in the porcine ciliary body. The cellular cAMP concentration was significantly increased from 10 +/- 1 of control to 96 +/- 5 (vaninolol) and 38 +/- 3 (eugenolol) in cultured A7r5 smooth muscle cells. Both agents also increased the intracellular calcium concentration in A7r5 cells.", 
    "50": "These results indicate that the lowering of intraocular pressure by vaninolol and eugenolol may be due to cAMP suppression in the ciliary body by beta-antagonist and/or alpha2-agonist activities. Both agents cause vasodilation via beta2-agonist action that increase the smooth muscle cellular cAMP level more than vasoconstriction via alpha-agonist activity by increasing an influx of extracellular Ca+2.", 
    "51": "It has been shown that beta-adrenergic blocking agents may reduce the rate of aortic root dilation and the development of aortic complications in patients with the Marfan syndrome. This may be due to beta-blocker-induced changes in aortic stiffness, of which distensibility and pulse wave velocity are in vivo measurable derivatives. We studied changes in distensibility at 4 levels of the aorta and pulse wave velocity along the entire aorta after 2 weeks of beta-blocker therapy in 6 Marfan syndrome patients and in 6 healthy volunteers, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with brachial artery blood pressure measurements. In both groups, mean blood pressure decreased significantly (Marfan: 86 +/- 6 vs 78 +/- 5 mm Hg, p <0.05; control: 80 +/- 8 vs 73 +/- 3 mm Hg, p <0.05) (all data expressed as mean +/- 1 SD). At baseline, the Marfan syndrome patients exhibited decreased distensibility at the level of the ascending aorta (2 +/- 1 vs 6 +/- 2 10(-3)mm Hg(-1), p <0.01) and increased pulse wave velocity (6.2 +/- 0.4 vs 3.9 +/- 0.4 ms(-1), p <0.01) compared with control subjects. Only the Marfan syndrome patients had a significant increase in aortic distensibility at multiple levels and a significant decrease in pulse wave velocity after beta-blocker therapy (ascending aorta distensibility: 2 +/- 1 vs 4 +/- 1 10(-3)mm Hg(-1), p <0.05; abdominal aorta distensibility: 5 +/- 2 vs 8 +/- 3 10(-3)mm Hg(-1), p <0.05; pulse wave velocity: 6.2 +/- 0.4 vs 5.0 +/- 1.0 ms(-1), p <0.05). Thus, aortic stiffness in Marfan syndrome, together with mean blood pressure, is reduced by beta-blocker therapy, and MRI is well suited to detect these changes by measuring distensibility and pulse wave velocity.", 
    "52": "Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular disorders. The knowledge, characterisation and comparison of the different antioxidant properties of some cardiovascular drugs might lead to new therapeutic approaches. Blood constituents are biological products easier to obtain. Their oxidative damage is accepted to be involved in several pathogenic pathways such as atherogenesis. Blood products can be utilised as in vitro models of macromolecular and cellular oxidative damage. It is well known that transition metals catalyse the generation of more damaging reactive oxygen species. We studied the antioxidant effect of four beta-adrenergic blocking agents (pindolol, propranolol, atenolol and metoprolol) and of one calcium channel antagonist (nifedipine), on the plasma oxidative damage induced by copper. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by measuring fluorescent substances. We added the drugs to the assay system, before and after the induction of peroxidation by copper, to elucidate their ability to prevent and/or block lipid peroxidation. We observed that pindolol, propranolol and nifedipine have antioxidant properties, in the assay system, when added 15 min before the addition of copper. This effect is demonstrated by the delay in initiation and decrease in formation of lipid peroxidation products. Nifedipine also has a remarkable chain breaking effect. We compared the drugs with ascorbic acid in their relative antioxidant effect: nifedipine > ascorbate > pindolol > propranolol.", 
    "53": "Abnormal beta2-adrenergic receptor coupling to Gs protein is implicated in depressive disorders. Steroid hormones and antidepressants modulate beta-adrenergic receptor coupling, which may relate to the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants. We examined beta2-adrenergic receptors in 18 patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), in 15 control subjects during the follicular phase and in 12 patients during late luteal phase. Antagonist-measured receptor density, agonist-measured receptor density in the high- and low-conformational states and agonist affinity to both states were measured. Coupling indices to Gs protein were determined from agonist-displacement experiments. Follicular beta2-adrenergic receptor density was higher in patients than in control subjects, with a trend for higher receptor density in the high-conformational state. The phase of menstrual cycle had no effect on beta2-adrenergic receptor regulation in PMDD. Exploratory correlations showed that the K(L)/K(H) ratio was related to anxiety ratings in control subjects and %R(H) was correlated with symptom severity in patients. In patients, follicular beta2-adrenergic receptor binding measures were correlated with luteal symptom severity. These findings suggest abnormal beta2-adrenergic receptor regulation in PMDD. Further exploration of the role of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, sex steroid hormones and antidepressants on beta-adrenergic receptor regulation in PMDD is warranted.", 
    "54": "This study investigated the effects of myocardial infarction (MI)-induced cardiac failure and treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (2 mg/kg/day) on rat beta-adrenoceptor (beta-ar) subtypes in anatomically defined regions of infarcted left ventricular (LV) free wall and noninfarcted tissue from right ventricle (RV) by using autoradiography. After 5 weeks of MI, rats with large MI size (>42%) had developed cardiac failure and beta1-ars were significantly decreased (-59%; p < 0.01) in the border region of the infarcted LV and almost abolished in the infarcted area (-90%; p < 0.005) compared with normal LV from sham-operated controls. The beta-ar changes were not found in the noninfarcted area of the same LV or in RV. MI did not significantly alter the number of beta2-ar subtypes in any region of the ventricles. Perindopril treatment for 4 weeks reduced mean cardiac region weights but did not affect beta-ar density in any cardiac region in either sham-operated or MI rats. These results indicate that cardiac failure due to MI causes significant downregulation of beta1-ars only in border and infarcted regions of rat LV and no change in beta2-ar in any area. It also suggests that the improved response of the infarcted rat heart to isoprenaline stimulation after ACE inhibitors does not result from changes in the numbers of cardiac beta-ars.", 
    "55": "Prior studies on the effects of propranolol on human ventricular refractoriness have yielded occasionally inconsistent results. Most prior studies have examined refractory periods at a single stimulus intensity and without using continuous pacing; thus, the effects of propranolol on repolarization may have not been completely defined. The purpose of the present study was to reevaluate the effects of beta blockade on the human ventricular effective refractory period.", 
    "56": "Strength-interval curves were performed in duplicate in a group of 10 patients to demonstrate their reproducibility. Strength-interval curves were performed before and after intravenous propranolol administration in a second group of 10 patients who had no evidence of structural heart disease.", 
    "57": "Propranolol increased the absolute refractory period from 208 +/- 9 milliseconds to 212 +/- 10 milliseconds (p = 0.01). However, propranolol decreased the coupling interval at which the strength-interval curve began to show an increase in the stimulus intensity required for capture from 236 +/- 8 milliseconds to 232 +/- 9 milliseconds. This resulted in a decrease of the width of the strength-interval curve from 28.0 +/- 5.1 milliseconds to 20.4 +/- 5.5 milliseconds (p < 0.005). Propranolol also significantly increased the slope of a logarithmic fit of the strength-interval curves.", 
    "58": "Propranolol exerts complex effects on human ventricular refractoriness. Propranolol decreases the width and increases the slope of human strength-interval curve, rather than increasing or decreasing the refractory period. These results have potential implications for antiarrhythmic effects of propranolol.", 
    "59": "Carvedilol has been shown to be effective in systemic hypertension and coronary artery disease in patients with end-stage renal disease, on maintenance hemodialysis. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of carvedilol on ventricular arrhythmias in these patients. Ninety-eight uremic patients maintained on hemodialysis, with complex ventricular arrhythmias (class III, IV and V of Lown's classification), not only during dialysis, were included in the study. They were divided into two groups, with mild-to-moderate hypertension or coronary artery disease. The efficacy and safety of carvedilol (50 mg/day) was compared to placebo in a 6-week randomized, double-blind study. Carvedilol significantly reduced, in both hypertensive and ischemic patients, total ventricular premature contractions (82.7 +/- 11.3 vs 358.1 +/- 73.9, p < 0.001; 88.3 +/- 24.4 vs 369.9 +/- 77.8, p < 0.001), repetitive ventricular premature contractions (1.3 +/- 1.3 vs 6.3 +/- 3.5, p < 0.001; 1.2 +/- 0.7 vs 6.9 +/- 2.6, p < 0.001) and episodes of ventricular tachycardia (1.1 +/- 1.2 vs 11.8 +/- 7.5, p < 0.001; 1.4 +/- 1.2 vs 14.0 +/- 8.3, p < 0.001). In placebo-treated patients, instead, these parameters were not significantly changed (329.1 +/- 76.5 vs 361.7 +/- 71.7, NS, and 324.6 +/- 79.7 vs 359.3 +/- 58.1, NS; 6.2 +/- 3.7 vs 7.3 +/- 3.7, NS, and 4.9 +/- 2.2 vs 6.1 +/- 3.2, NS; 9.8 +/- 6.3 vs 13.3 +/- 8.0, NS, and 9.0 +/- 6.2 vs 12.4 +/- 7.8, NS). Carvedilol confirmed a significant effect on myocardial ischemia and systemic hypertension. No significant side effects were reported. Ventricular arrhythmias are frequent in patients with end-stage renal disease maintained on hemodialysis. They are often due to an underlying cardiac disease, namely systemic hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary artery disease. The results of our study show that the antiarrhythmic effect of carvedilol is linked, at least partly, to an improvement of the underlying cardiac disease. Uremic patients have a chronic increase in adrenergic tone, with a direct correlation between norepinephrine plasmatic concentration and frequence of premature ventricular contractions. Beta-blockers are very important in these patients because of their modulation on the adrenergic system. They also reduce potassium flow, from extracellular to intracellular fluid. Therefore carvedilol can affect the sudden hypokalemia occurring in the first phase of hemodialysis treatment, that may be an important cause of intradialytic arrhythmias.", 
    "60": "The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that prolonged treatment of mild to moderate hypertension with low-dose thiazide diuretics or beta blockers does not induce any of the major untoward biochemical changes, such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricemia and electrolyte imbalances. The effect of these drugs was analyzed in 100 outpatients (52 males and 48 females) aged 52.0 +/- 7.9 years with mild to moderate hypertension, in a prospective 6-month study. After an appropriate workup, the patients were randomized to either 25 mg chlorthalidone (40 patients), 120 mg propranolol (30 patients), or 2 mg per day bopindolol (30 patients). A significant reduction of approximately 10% in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was recorded in all the groups. At the end of the 6th month, in the chlorthalidone group triglycerides increased to 3.0 +/- 2.1 mmol/l from 2.8 +/- 1.6 mmol/l, while cholesterol after an initial increase to 6.6 +/- 1.6 from 6.4 +/- 1.6 mmol/l returned to the baseline level. Uricemia and serum potassium concentration decreased by 4%. The body weight was reduced to 83.8 +/- 13.4 kg from 86.1 +/- 13.4 kg. There was no change in serum glucose level. In the propranolol group, as expected, heart rate decreased by 20%, but there were no significant changes in glucose and potassium plasma concentration. Triglycerides did not change significantly, while cholesterol, after a small increase, returned to the initial levels. Similar results were obtained in the bopindolol group, apart from the triglycerides, which increased significantly (to 2.5 +/- 1.1 from 2.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l), probably because of the lower baseline concentration. We conclude that in prolonged treatment, chlorthalidone, propranolol and bopindolol do not induce significant untoward biochemical changes that alone might increase cardiovascular risk.", 
    "61": "Laryngomicroscopy is a short-lasting procedure, which causes considerable hemodynamic and ECG changes. Therefore it sets specific demands on anesthetic care. In this double-blind randomized work, we studied hemodynamic and ECG changes in patients during laryngomicroscopy in jet ventilation under propofol-alfentanil anesthesia with and without esmolol, a short-acting beta1-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Forty ASA class I-II patients were allocated to receive either esmolol 1 mg.kg-1 + 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (the esmolol group) or saline (the control group) (mean age +/- SD 36 +/- 12 yrs in the esmolol group and 39 +/- 9 yrs in the control group). The heart rate and arterial pressure were measured non-invasively and ECG was analyzed with the aid of a microcomputer. In the control group, neither the heart rate nor the QTc interval of the ECG did change significantly when compared with the baseline values. In the presence of esmolol, the heart rate decreased and the QTc interval shortened during the procedure. Arterial pressure increased in the control group, but not in the esmolol group, when compared with the baseline values. No cardiac arrhythmias occurred in either of the groups. On the basis of the present study, propofol-alfentanil anesthesia combined with esmolol is a satisfactory method to meet specific demands of laryngomicroscopy in young and middle-aged ASA I-II patients. However, a combination of propofol and esmolol showed a tendency to decrease both the heart rate and arterial pressure and a caution is necessary when the combination were used in elderly patients.", 
    "62": "Beta-adrenergic agonists are widely used for preterm labor treatment, but their effectiveness may be limited by desensitization. We thus investigated the effects of a beta-agonist, isoproterenol, on the myometrial beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR)/adenylyl cyclase pathway after administration in vivo to late-pregnant rats (8 mg/kg, twice-daily injections). One hour after the first injection, isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was reduced by 37%. This was associated with a rapid and transient uncoupling of the beta2-ARs (53% reduction of high-affinity receptors). After prolonged isoproterenol treatment (76 h), adenylyl cyclase activity was desensitized not only to isoproterenol but also to guanosine triphosphate and forskolin. Such treatment induced 1) a selective decrease of beta2-ARs as assessed by 125I-cyanopindolol binding, which was reversed by 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate and thus probably did not involve irreversible loss of receptors, and 2) a rapid alteration of their transcript levels. Prolonged isoproterenol treatment also led to myometrial Gi2alpha and Gi3alpha increase (44% and 70%) as assessed by Western blotting. Furthermore, pertussis toxin pretreatment of membranes abolished the decrease in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Thus, we demonstrated that myometrial adenylyl cyclase desensitization after beta-agonist treatment results mainly from beta2-AR uncoupling and increase in Gi activity.", 
    "63": "Experiments performed either in decerebrate cats or in intact rabbits have shown that functional inactivation of the cerebellar anterior vermis or the flocculus decreased the basic gain of the vestibulospinal or the vestibulo-ocular reflex, respectively. These findings were attributed to the fact that a proportion of the vermal or floccular Purkinje cells, which are inhibitory in function, discharge out of phase with respect to the vestibulospinal or the vestibulo-ocular neurons during sinusoidal animal rotation, thus exerting a facilitatory influence on the gain of the vestibular reflexes. Intravermal injection of a beta-noradrenergic agonist slightly increased the gain of the vestibulospinal reflex, whereas the opposite result was obtained after injection of beta-antagonists. Similarly, intrafloccular injection of a beta-noradrenergic agonist slightly facilitated the gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in darkness (but not in light), whereas a small decrease of the reflex occurred after injection of a beta-antagonist. It was postulated that the noradrenergic system acts on Purkinje cells by enhancing their amplitude of modulation to a given labyrinth signal, thus increasing the basic gain of the vestibular reflexes. The Purkinje cells of the cerebellar anterior vermis and the flocculus also exert a prominent role on the adaptation of vestibulospinal and vestibulo-ocular reflexes, respectively. In particular, intravermal or intrafloccular injection of beta-noradrenergic antagonists decreased or suppressed the adaptive capacity of the vestibulospinal and vestibulo-ocular reflexes that always occurred during sustained out-of-phase neck-vestibular or visual-vestibular stimulation, whereas the opposite result was obtained after local injection of a beta-noradrenergic agonist. The noradrenergic innervation of the cerebellar cortex originates from the locus coeruleus complex, whose neurons respond to vestibular, neck, and visual signals. It was postulated that this structure acts through beta-adrenoceptors to increase the expression of immediate-early genes, such as c-fos and Jun-B, in the Purkinje cells during vestibular adaptation. Induction of immediate-early genes could then represent a mechanism by which impulses elicited by sustained neck-vestibular or visuovestibular stimulation are transduced into long-term biochemical changes that are required for cerebellar long-term plasticity.", 
    "64": "Nine cases of symptomatic bradycardia are presented in which treatment with intravenous glucagon was administered when atropine failed to improve the patient's condition significantly. Although the cause often was not obvious at presentation, all nine subjects took oral medications that could have contributed to the development of symptomatic bradycardia. Eight of nine patients demonstrated clinical improvement 5 to 10 min after glucagon administration, which was consistent with its peak clinical action. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin were ultimately thought to have contributed to the majority of these presentations. This report suggests that glucagon may have a role in the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, particularly in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade and perhaps calcium channel blockade. Furthermore, the results in these cases suggest that future clinical trials should not be limited to drug-induced symptomatic bradycardia.", 
    "65": "The results of studies on the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) are discordant. The aim of this study was to verify whether chronic beta-adrenergic blockade is capable of increasing RSA, and therefore vagal outflow, and to analyze whether the mechanism of action is central or peripheral.",

    "67": "After 1 week of therapy, a spectral analysis was made of the variability in heart rate and systolic BP during controlled breathing at 16 breaths/min. The high-frequency component was calculated for the RR interval (measure of RSA) and systolic pressure, and the squared coherence and phase functions were assessed between RR and systolic pressure fluctuations in the respiratory band; a negative phase means that RR changes follow systolic pressure changes. The gain in the relationship between the two signal fluctuations was also calculated.", 
    "68": "Both beta-blockers increased the mean (+/-SD) RR interval (placebo=808+/-21, nadolol=1,054+/-30, metoprolol=1,031+/-27 ms; p<0.0001), RSA (placebo=542, nadolol=1,177, metoprolol=1,316 ms2; p=0.002), and the gain (placebo=13.6+/-1.5, nadolol=21.9+/-2.8, metoprolol=24.5+/-3.6 ms/mm Hg; p<0.002), and both modified the phase function (placebo=-21.1+/-5.3, nadolol=-1.8+/-4.9, metoprolol=-2.9+/-4.2 degree; p<0.0001). No difference was found between nadolol and metoprolol.", 
    "69": "Chronic beta-adrenergic blockade enhanced both RSA and baroreflex gain and reduced the phase between the RR interval and systolic pressure oscillations. Since no difference was found between the hydrophilic and the lipophilic beta-blockers, these changes seem to be due to a peripheral effect.", 
    "70": "In order to investigate the possible mechanisms for caffeine-induced ocular hypertension, the intraocular pressure (IOP) and the outflow through the trabecular meshwork were measured in beagle dog eyes after dosing with intravenous caffeine (30 mg/kg) alone or in combination with the topical beta-blocker befunolol [applied as 100 microliters of a 1% (w/v) solution] which inhibits aqueous humor formation in the ciliary body. Intravenous injections of caffeine significantly increased the IOP at 0.25 and 1 hr after a single dose. The ocular hypertension recovered within 2 hr following dosing. Over time, there were no differences in the outflow between the caffeine and control groups. The instillation of befunolol lowered outflow and produced ocular hypotension. The levels of the IOP and outflow in dogs treated with caffeine and befunolol in combination were almost the same as those in dogs treated with befunolol alone. Single-dose and combination-dose studies demonstrate that intravenous caffeine increases the IOP in normal beagle dogs possibly by increasing aqueous humor formation and not by the inhibition of aqueous humor drainage through the trabecular meshwork.", 
    "71": "The goals of stable angina pectoris treatment are: (i) symptom relief and increase in angina-free walking time; and (ii) reduction of mortality and adverse outcome. Strategies used for plaque stabilisation resulting in a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are: smoking cessation; aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid); blood pressure control; lipid lowering agents when low density lipoprotein cholesterol is elevated despite dietary therapy; coronary bypass surgery in patients with left main stem disease or triple vessel coronary disease and diminished left ventricular function; and use of estrogen in postmenopausal women. For symptom relief and to increase angina-free walking time, long acting nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and potassium channel openers can be used. Drugs from these 3 classes are all effective when used optimally and choice of initial therapy should consider the presence of concomitant disease and underlying left ventricular function. However, none of the long acting nitrates provide continuous prophylaxis because nitrate tolerance develops during long term therapy. In patients with uncomplicated stable angina, nitrates, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are all effective. Intermittent nitrate therapy is not associated with tolerance, but headache is a common adverse effect and the patient is unprotected at night and in the early hours of the morning. Concomitant treatment with a beta-blocker may be beneficial if the patient experiences withdrawal or early morning angina. For patients with stable angina and hypertension, therapy with a beta-blocker or a calcium antagonist rather than nitrate is indicated. beta-Blockers are preferred in patients who have had a myocardial infarction, or in those with a history of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. beta-Blockers may produce excessive slowing of the heart rate, fatigue and bronchospasm in susceptible patients. Calcium antagonists are indicated as initial therapy when beta-blockers are either not tolerated or contraindicated. beta-Blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists should not be used in patients with sinus bradycardia and those with greater than first degree atrioventricular (AV) block because of the possibility of further slowing of heart rate and/or the development of high grade AV block. When monotherapy with one class is ineffective or associated with adverse effects, the patient should be switched to another class rather than given an additional drug. Optimal monotherapy is often as effective as combination therapy. If maximum monotherapy is only partially effective, a combination therapy which is not additive in terms of adverse effects should be chosen. Triple therapy may be deleterious and no more effective than dual therapy.", 
    "72": "Stimulating cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors with oxyfedrine causes dilatation of coronary vessels and positive inotropic effects on the myocardium. beta 1-adrenergic agonists increase coronary blood flow in nonstenotic and stenotic vessels. The main indication for the use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors pamrinone, mirinone, enoximone and piroximone is acute treatment of severe congestive heart failure. Theophylline is indicated for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, apnea in preterm infants ans sleep apnea syndrome. Severe arterial occlusive disease associated with atherosclerosis can be beneficially affected by elcosanoids. These drugs must be administered parenterally and have a half-life of only a few minutes. Sublingual or buccal preparations of nitrates are the only prompt method (within 1 or 2 min) of terminating anginal pain, except for biting nifedipine capsules. The short half-life (about 2.5 min) of nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) makes long term therapy impossible. Tolerance is a problem encountered with longer-acting nitric oxide donors. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of vasodilating drugs can prevent a too sudden and severe blood pressure decrease in patients with chronic hypertension. In considering the administration of a second dose, or another drug, the time necessary for the initially administered drug to reach maximal efficacy should be taken into account. In hypertensive emergencies urapidil, sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, hydralazine and phentolamine are the drugs of choice, with the addition of beta-blockers during catecholamine crisis or dissecting aortic aneurysm. Childhood hypertension is most often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium antagonists, primarily nifedipine. Because of the teratogenic risk involved with ACE inhibitors, extreme caution must be exercised when prescribing for adolescent females. The propagation of health benefits to breast-fed infants, combined with more women delaying pregnancy until their fourth decade, has entailed an increase in the need for hypertension management during lactation. Low dose hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, nifedipine and enalapril or captopril do not pose enough of a risk of preclude breastfeeding in this group. The most frequently used antihypertensive agents during pregnancy are methyldopa, labetalol and calcium channel antagonists. Methyldopa and beta-blockers are the drugs of choice for treating mild to moderate hypertension. Prazosin and hydralazine are used to treat moderate to severe hypertension and hydralazine, urapidil or labetalol are used to treat hypertensive emergencies. The use of overly aggressive antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy should be avoided so that adequate uteroplacental blood flow is maintained. Methyldopa is the only drug accepted for use during the first trimester of pregnancy.",

    "82": "1. Experiments were carried out in 30 chronically catheterized foetal sheep (128-144 days; term 150 days) and in seven of these foetuses before, during and after acute hypoxaemia. The extent to which changes in sympathoadrenal activity and cardiac vagal activity affected the foetal cardiac response to hypoxaemia was measured. Three measurements were used: foetal heart rate (FHR), heart rate variability (HRV; measured as the coefficient of variation in pulse interval) and power spectral density (PSD; measured over the frequency ranges of 0.04-1.3 Hz). Cardiac vagal activity was blocked by atropine, beta-adrenoceptor activity was blocked by propranolol. 2. Under normoxaemic conditions, cardiac vagal blockade caused a rise in mean arterial pressure (MAP; P < 0.001), an increase in FHR (P < 0.001), a decrease in HRV (P < 0.001) and a decrease in PSD (P < 0.001). beta-adrenoceptor blockade caused a rise in MAP (P < 0.001), a fall in FHR (P < 0.01), a decrease in HRV (P < 0.001) but no change in PSD. 3. During mild hypoxaemia (PO2 = 12-14.5 mmHg) and moderate hypoxaemia (PO2 = 10-11.9 mmHg), foetal MAP (P < 0.001, P< 0.001), HRV (P < 0.01, P < 0.001) and PSD in the frequency range 0.04-0.45 Hz increased (P < 0.05-P < 0.001). Foetal heart rate decreased when foetuses became moderately hypoxaemic (P < 0.001). 4. After cardiac vagal blockade, hypoxaemia was associated with an increase in FHR compared with non-blocked hypoxaemic foetuses (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). The increase in HRV was abolished (P < 0.001, P < 0.001) as was the increase in PSD (P < 0.01-P < 0.001). 5. After beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the bradycardia that occurred during hypoxaemia was enhanced (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), the increase in HRV was not affected and neither was the increase in PSD. 6. As FHR and HRV of normoxaemic foetal sheep were affected both by atropine and propranolol, it would seem that both cardiac vagal and sympathoadrenal activity modulate the foetal heart under resting conditions. The lack of any effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on PSD under these conditions suggests that power spectral analysis (PSA) is not as sensitive as the other two methods in detecting sympathetically mediated modulation of the heart. 7. Because the hypoxaemia induced bradycardia and increase in HRV and in PSD were abolished by atropine (P < 0.01-P < 0.001), it is concluded that during hypoxaemia foetal HRV is mainly modulated by changes in cardiac vagal tone. Propranolol had no effect on foetal HRV, although it reduced it under normoxaemic conditions; therefore, it is concluded that cardiac sympathetic neural activity was not increased in acute hypoxaemia uncomplicated by acidosis. However, there was strong evidence of increased sympathoadrenal tone on the foetal heart in hypoxaemia, that is, there was a rise in FHR in hypoxaemic atropinized foetuses and a greater fall in FHR in beta-adrenoceptor blocked hypoxaemic foetuses. Therefore, this increased sympathetic influence on the foetal heart during hypoxaemia must be predominantly the result of increased adrenomedullary secretion of catecholamines. 8. Maintenance of foetal cardiac output depends on the chronotropic and ionotropic effects of catecholamines. Therefore, this adrenomedullary influence on the foetal heart during hypoxaemia is important to offset the opposing effects of increased cardiac vagal tone.", 
    "83": "1. The influence of hypoxia on the time course of regional myocardial accumulation and elimination of the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol was investigated by a spontaneously beating rat isolated perfused heart preparation. 2. Myocardial metoprolol content was maximal at 2 min in the left and right ventricles and atria. Neither the extent nor the time of maximal myocardial metoprolol content was significantly influenced by the induction of hypoxia. However, maximal myocardial metoprolol content in both atria and right ventricles was significantly higher than that in the left ventricular samples (P < 0.02; one-factor analysis of variance, 17 d.f.). 3. Elimination of metoprolol (as indicated from residual myocardial metoprolol content at 10 min) was impaired in hypoxic left ventricles (P < 0.01 vs normoxia; unpaired t-test, 10 d.f.) but not in right ventricles or atria. This variation in myocardial metoprolol disposition was not apparent from examination of serial metoprolol concentrations in coronary perfusate. 4. Hypoxia selectively impaired the elimination of metoprolol from the left ventricle, but not the process of drug accumulation, by any region of myocardium. It remains to be determined whether this reflects regional variation in the extent of microcirculatory impairment associated with hypoxia.",

Metabolic indices measuring glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity were derived from minimal model analysis of the glucose and insulin profiles measured during the IVGTT. Indices of first- and second-phase insulin release were also calculated from the IVGTT insulin response. Atenolol had different metabolic effects on normal subjects and syndrome X patients. Despite the fact that the drug was found to be effective in relieving symptoms of chest pain, it induced a significant (p < 0.05) worsening of insulin resistance in syndrome X patients. No such effect was observed in control subjects. On the other hand, atenolol produced a marked reduction (40%, p < 0.05) of first-phase insulin release in control subjects, but no significant change of the same index in syndrome X patients.",

She was being treated for hypertension with atenolol and chlorthalidone, but until 6 weeks before the onset of the described symptoms she had only taken the beta blocker, at which time the diuretic was added because the hypertension was inadequately controlled. Other than slightly impaired general condition and nocturnal fever up to 39.5 degrees C physical examination was unremarkable.",

However, a significant number of patients fail to respond and have further haemorrhage. It has been suggested that measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient response to long-term drug therapy may allow early selection of non-responders. We aimed to test this hypothesis in 63 patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding treated with propranolol+/-isosorbide mononitrate.",

Overall, there was no difference in rebleeding rates between the two groups: responders 43%, non-responders 25%. However, rebleeding was uncommon in compliant patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, in whom the hepatic venous pressure gradient fell to less than 12 mmHg (9%).",

    "96": "Diabetes-associated alterations in resting heart rate and blood pressure have been demonstrated in clinical studies and in animal models of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). These alterations may result from changes in the heart, vasculature or autonomic nervous system control. Using the streptozotocin- (STZ-) treated rat model of IDDM, the current study was designed to: (1) monitor changes in heart rate and blood pressure continually during a 10-week period in conscious unrestrained animals; and (2) determine if observed alterations in heart rate were mediated by changes in sympathetic and/or parasympathetic nervous control. Biotelemetry techniques were used. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded 24 h a day at 10 min intervals before and after induction of diabetes. Diabetes was induced by i.v. administration of 50 mg/kg STZ. Resting autonomic nervous system tone was estimated by chronotropic responses to full-blocking doses of nadolol (5 mg/kg i.p.) and atropine (10 mg/kg i.p.). STZ-induced diabetes was associated with time-dependent reductions in heart rate and its circadian variation. Diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure did not differ significantly when compared between control and STZ-treated animals; however, pulse pressure was diminished in diabetic rats. Chronotropic responses to both nadolol and atropine were blunted significantly in diabetic animals suggesting that resting levels of both vagal and sympathetic nervous tone to the heart were diminished. Heart rate in the presence of both nadolol and atropine was also decreased in diabetic rats. All effects observed following administration of STZ were reversed, at least in part, by insulin treatment. These results suggest that IDDM is associated with time-dependent reductions in resting heart rate and autonomic nervous control of cardiac function.", 
    "97": "Previous studies indicate that there may be differences in the protein composition of the aqueous humor in normal and glaucomatous human eyes. These differences in protein composition and concentration may be due to the topical antiglaucoma medications used to treat glaucoma. These differences should be distinguished from any possible protein composition changes due to glaucoma. In order to study the effects of topical antiglaucoma medications on aqueous humor protein composition, we analyzed the aqueous humor of rabbit eyes topically treated with various antiglaucoma medications (timolol, pilocarpine, and dipivefrin). One eye of each rabbit was treated with the experimental drug, and the fellow eye was treated with saline solution (control). Thirty-six aqueous humor samples from 18 rabbits were obtained after 24 hours and 36 samples were obtained from 18 additional rabbits after 7 days of topical drug treatment. The protein composition of the aqueous humor samples was analyzed by sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Significant protein differences in aqueous humor samples were found between the eyes treated with timolol and the control eyes, whereas no significant differences were found between the eyes treated with pilocarpine or dipivefrin and the controls. These protein differences ranged from 14,000 to 18,000 daltons in molecular weight.",

Therapy was performed on 32 eyes affected by POAG (primary open-angle glaucoma) and 16 eyes affected by NTG (normal-tension glaucoma). Two preparations of betaxolol were utilized: betaxolol hydrochloride 0.50% (Betoptic) was administered to 15 POAG and 7 NTG eyes; betaxolol hydrochloride 0.25% ophthalmic suspension (Betoptic S) was administered to 17 POAG and 9 NTG eyes. IOP measurements were taken every two hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. IOP was measured before therapy and at 12 hours, 30 days, and 3 months of therapy. Betaxolol hydrochloride 0.50% was more effective at lowering IOP during the day. Diurnal pressure peaks, which are a risk factor concerning the maintenance of visual field in glaucoma patients, were also reduced using 0.50% betaxolol hydrochloride.",

Thus, treatment should be based on the use of drugs with a low risk of such potentially serious side effects as proarrhythmia, which is well documented for class I and III drugs in children. We studied all pediatric patients with a first manifestation of SVT between 1988 and the end of 1995 who were seen for a follow-up examination, including Holter monitoring, during 1996. The minimum follow-up period was 12 months. Fifty children met study entry criteria. Mean patient age at first presentation was 2 years (median 1 month), with 33 of the patients (66%) having experienced their first episode of tachycardia in their first year of life. Of 39 patients initially treated with either digoxin or a beta blocker, SVT in 29 (75%) responded favorably to this treatment. There were no adverse effects. Of the 10 children whose disease did not respond to these first-line agents, 9 (23% of those treated) required class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs. Thus, first-line antiarrhythmic long-term prophylaxis using drugs with a favorable risk profile, such as digoxin and beta blockers, resulted in successful disease management in a large proportion of unselected children, avoiding the need for chronic use of class I or class III antiarrhythmic drugs.",

Widespread idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins produces intestinal ischemia in otherwise healthy individuals. This report describes a 42-year-old woman who died suddenly and unexpectedly while attending a ball game. She had hypertension treated with propranolol and no other clinically apparent disorders. Autopsy revealed mild mesenteric venous myointimal hyperplasia and segmental jejunal infarction. Recent clinical and experimental studies are used to propose possible mechanisms for this death which combine the effects of propranolol and mesenteric venous myointimal hyperplasia.", 
    "102": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the atrioventricular AV nodal physiology and the inducibility of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) under pharmacological autonomic blockade (AB). Seventeen consecutive patients (6 men and 11 women, mean age 39 +/- 17 years) with clinical recurrent slow-fast AVNRT received electrophysiological study before and after pharmacological AB with atropine (0.04 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.2 mg/kg). In baseline, all 17 patients could be induced with AVNRT, 5 were isoproterenol-dependent. After pharmacological AB, 12 (71%) of 17 patients still demonstrated AV nodal duality. AVNRT became noninducible in 7 of 12 nonisoproterenol dependent patients and remained noninducible in all 5 isoproterenol dependent patients. The sinus cycle length (801 +/- 105 ms vs 630 +/- 80 ms, P < 0.005) and AV blocking cycle length (365 +/- 64 ms vs 338 +/- 61 ms, P < 0.005) became shorter after AB. The antegrade effective refractory period and functional refractory period of the fast pathway (369 +/- 67 ms vs 305 +/- 73 ms, P < 0.005; 408 +/- 56 ms vs 350 +/- 62 ms, P < 0.005) and the slow pathway (271 +/- 30 ms vs 258 +/- 27 ms, P < 0.01; 344 +/- 60 ms vs 295 +/- 50 ms, P < 0.005) likewise became significantly shortened. However, the ventriculoatrial blocking cycle length (349 +/- 94 ms vs 326 +/- 89 ms, NS) and effective refractory period of retrograde fast pathway (228 +/- 38 ms vs 240 +/- 80 ms, NS) remained unchanged after autonomic blockade. Pharmacological AB unveiling the intrinsic AV nodal physiology could result in the masking of AV nodal duality and the decreased inducibility of clinical AVNRT.", 
    "103": "Involvement of the central adrenergic system in stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by carbachol, a cholinergic muscarinic agonist, was assessed indirectly through corticosterone secretion. Carbachol (2 micrograms) given intracerebroventricularly or intraperitoneally evoked a dose-related increase in serum corticosterone levels. On a molar basis, carbachol given i.c.v. was considerably more active than when injected i.p., indicating its central site of action. The corticosterone response to i.c.v. carbachol was significantly reduced by pretreatment of rats 15 min earlier with prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Pretreatment with yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonists, did not significantly affect the carbachol-induced corticosterone response. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, given i.c.v. or i.p. significantly impaired the carbachol-elicited corticosterone secretion. The selective noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4 (50 mg/kg) given i.p. 8 days before the experiment, also potently diminished the carbachol-induced rise in serum corticosterone levels. Carbachol markedly increased, while DSP-4 significantly diminished the hypothalamic noradrenaline levels. Likewise, DSP-4 significantly impaired the carbachol-induced rise in hypothalamic noradrenaline levels. Our present results indicate that the central adrenergic system is involved in the cholinergic muscarinic stimulation of the pituitary-adrenocortical response. Both hypothalamic noradrenaline and adrenergic alpha 1- and beta-receptors are significantly involved in the carbachol-induced HPA response.", 
    "104": "The objective of this study was to determine whether endogenous EFG released after submaximal physical exercise, affects platelet-endothelium interactions. Sixteen healthy male volunteers, aged 23-26 years, were submitted to a submaximal bicycle ergometry test. Blood for determination of EGF concentrations, platelet function studies (concentrations of beta-TG, PF4 and TXB2) and endothelium activity (LTC4 and endothelin-1,2 concentrations) was taken via an intravenous catheter before starting exercise and 15, 30 and 60 min after. A similar scheme was followed to investigate changes in the same parameters induced by a slow intravenous infusion of 0.3 mg/kg b.w. phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic blocker) before exercise. Plasma concentrations of EGF and the markers of platelet function-beta-TG and PF4 as well as LTC4 concentrations increased only 15 min following exercise. The concentrations of TXB2, and endothelium-1,2 were almost unchanged 15 min after the submaximal bicycle ergometry test. Phentolamine markedly decreased the EGF concentrations in plasma (15 min following exercise) while at 30 and 60 min after exercise it had no effect on this parameter. No significant changes in concentrations of beta-TG, PF6, LTC4 and endothelin-1,2 after phentolamine infusion were found. These results show that increase of plasma EGF following exercise was accompanied with increase of beta-TG, PF4 and LTC4 concentrations. Inhibition of alpha-adrenergic receptors with phentolamine abolished the exercise-induced increase in plasma EGF concentration. The findings suggest that endogenous EGF may affect the platelet function and changes the reactivity of the vascular endothelium.",

The manufacturer voluntarily withdrew mibefradil on June 8, 1998. We describe 4 cases of cardiogenic shock in patients taking mibefradil and beta-blockers who began taking dihydropyridine CCBs. One case resulted in death; the other 3 survived episodes of cardiogenic shock with intensive support of heart rate and blood pressure.

Compared with tedisamil, stroke volume was reduced by esmolol [at rest and max. workload: -9% (NS)] and gallopamil [rest: -6% (NS), max. exercise: -2% (NS)]. Of the indirect parameters of ventricular function, that is, mean capillary wedge pressure (PCWPm) and right ventricular ejection fraction, only PCWPm demonstrated significant differences between tedisamil and gallopamil (+18% and -6% at rest, +17% and -21% during exercise, respectively; p < 0.001). Compared with gallopamil, both tedisamil and esmolol were superior in their effects on rate-pressure product, myocardial oxygen consumption, and ST-segment depression, whereas plasma lactate concentration was more reduced by tedisamil and gallopamil. Tedisamil led to a fall in norepinephrine levels in particular.",

Forty patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery were randomized to receive either desflurane or isoflurane as the primary anaesthetic agent. After premedication, fentanyl and thiopentone were administered i.v.. Anaesthesia was increased up to 1.0 MACET in O2 via controlled mask ventilation and maintained at 1.0 MAC before tracheal intubation. Maintenance consisted of N2O, O2 and desflurane or isoflurane for 10 min. During the study, HR and arterial BP were continuously measured, as were ECG ST-segments and ventricular dysrhythmias using a 3-channel Holter ECG recorder. Left ventricular global and regional function were measured using precordial echocardiography. Serial plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured.",

Use of beta blockade during induction was higher in the desflurane (7/20 = 35%) than in the isoflurane group (1/20 = 5%), P = 0.04. The plasma norepinephrine concentrations progressively increased in the desflurane group but not in the isoflurane group. Four patients in the desflurane and three in the isoflurane group developed transient worsening of regional function but no change in mean left ventricular ejection fraction area and no ECG ischaemia occurred during anaesthetic induction.",

    "121": "The present study was undertaken to examine the role of the benzodiazepine/GABA and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) systems in the convulsive effect of cocaine in mice. When cocaine (3.5 mg/ml) solution was infused into the tail vein at a rate of 0.3 ml/min, mice showed clonic and tonic convulsions. These seizures were not affected by low doses of bicuculline or picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist and a Cl ion channel blocker, respectively. Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a GABA deaminase inhibitor, and phenobarbital, a Cl ion channel activator, and baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, also had no effect on these convulsions. Benzodiazepine inverse agonist beta-DMCM, at a dose which by itself had no convulsive effect lowered the convulsive threshold of cocaine. This lowered convulsive threshold was reversed by flumazenil, a benzodiazepine inverse antagonist, and diazepam, a benzodiazepine full agonist, which by themselves did not inhibit cocaine seizure. It is likely that cocaine seizure involves a benzodiazepine (beta-carboline) recognition site other than the benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor-Cl ionophore complex system. CPP and MK-801, competitive and noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, respectively, inhibited cocaine seizures. The inhibitory effects of CPP on cocaine convulsion were reversed by a low dose of NMDA, which by itself did not induce seizure. A dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 enhanced both clonic and tonic convulsions, while a dopamine D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine inhibited these convulsions. These stimulatory and inhibitory effects were reversed by the D1 and D2 receptor antagonists, SCH23390 and haloperidol, respectively. These results suggest that the cocaine-induced convulsion may involve an activation of the NMDA-Ca ionophore complex system, which is mediated by the dopaminergic system, and a beta-carboline recognition site other than the benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor-Cl ionophore complex system.",

The receptor model was used to examine receptor interactions of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), (S)pindolol and of the tetrapeptide Leu-Ser-Ala-Leu (LSAL), which recently has been shown to interact specifically with the 5-HT1B receptor. We have assumed that the NH3(+)-LSAL-COO- form of the tetrapeptide is the biologically active, and propose that a negatively charged residue conserved among various species homologues of the 5-HT1B receptor may act as a counter-ion for the positively charged N-terminus of the tetrapeptide. The strongest LSAL-receptor interactions were obtained after molecular dynamics simulations that were started with the N-terminus of LSAL positioned close to Asp352 in transmembrane helix 7. The model suggests that Asp352 in transmembrane helix 7 may act as a counter-ion for the positively charged N-terminus, and that the side chains of Tyr109 (transmembrane helix 2) and Trp125 (transmembrane helix 3) may form hydrogen bonds with the negatively charged C-terminus of LSAL.",

The distribution and density of beta-adrenoceptors was assessed autoradiographically on cryostat tissue sections using [3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA). Binding sites were localised in all ages and experimental situations examined and showed the following intensity of labelling: endometrial epithelium > longitudinal muscle layer > circular myometrial layer > endometrial stroma. Competition experiments with the selective antagonists ICI 118,551 and atenolol, showed that most of the beta-adrenoceptors in the uterus belong to the beta(2) receptor subclass. In prepubertal animals, the density of [3H]-DHA binding sites was extremely low. Following puberty the density of binding sites showed a generalised increase. Acute administration of oestradiol at the end of the prepubertal period provoked an increase in the density of [3H]-DHA binding sites in all uterine regions, but the levels of labelling were lower than in peripubertal animals at proestrus and oestrus. Following chronic oestrogen treatment during postnatal development, oestradiol increased further the density of [3H]-DHA binding sites.

After the washout of previous ocular hypotensive drugs, patients with IOP > or = 23 mm Hg in at least one eye at 10 AM or 4 PM on study day 1 were randomly allocated to receive one of the study treatments. Throughout the study, IOP was measured 2 and 8 hours after instillation of study medication for the morning peak effect (hour 2) and afternoon trough effect (hour 8). After 12 weeks of therapy, the mean change in IOP was not significantly different between the dorzolamide and betaxolol treatment groups at hour 8 (-3.6 mm Hg in both groups) or hour 2 (-5.4 vs -5.3 mm Hg, respectively). The differences between treatments (and 95% CIs associated with these differences) in mean IOP changes from baseline were 0.02 mm Hg (-0.870 to 0.901) for hour 8 and -0.14 mm Hg (-0.959 to 0.685) for hour 2. The ocular adverse experience (AE) most frequently reported by patients was ocular burning and/or stinging, and the most frequently reported nonocular AEs were taste perversion, upper respiratory infection, and headache. Only the incidence of taste perversion was significantly different between treatment groups (14.6% for the dorzolamide group and 0.0% for the betaxolol group). Two percent of patients in each treatment group discontinued the study due to AEs. This study confirmed the similar IOP-lowering effect of 2% dorzolamide and 0.5% betaxolol.

    "146": "Isoproterenol (IPR) and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cyclic AMP (cpt-cAMP) enhanced carbachol (CCh)-induced fluid secretion from rat parotid glands, but had no effect by themselves. The enhancement by IPR was blocked by propranolol. In dispersed parotid acinar cells, IPR and cpt-cAMP potentiated CCh-induced K+ and Cl- currents (IK and ICl). IPR at the concentration of 0.1 microM significantly potentiated the CCh-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), but 1 mm cpt-cAMP did not. The incidence of the potentiation by IPR in CCh-induced Mn2+ entry was 31% and that by cpt-cAMP was 21%. The potentiation by IPR in the ionic currents and the [Ca2+]i was suppressed by propranolol. These results suggest that the CCh-induced fluid secretion from rat parotid glands is enhanced by IPR through the potentiation of IK and ICl mainly by the increased cyclic AMP level and partially by the potentiated Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]i increase, and that IPR is more effective than cpt-cAMP in the enhancement of the CCh-induced [Ca2+]i increase.",

In vitro studies showed that within minutes catecholamines trigger the secretion of interleukin-10 from unstimulated monocytes through a beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated, cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent pathway. We found that in a rat model of acute brain injury, the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol prevented the increase of interleukin-10 plasma levels. Rapid monocytic interleukin-10 release after sympathetic activation may represent a common pathway for immunodepression induced by stress and injury.",

The interaction of ion channels activated by nicotinic receptor agonists with ion channels gated by extracellular ATP (i.e. P2X receptors) was studied on sympathetic neurons acutely dissociated from coeliac ganglia of the guinea-pig.

At the whole cell level, the specific nicotinic receptor agonists nicotine (5-100 microM) or cytisine (50-75 microM) and the P2X receptor agonists ATP (0.1-7 microM) or alpha,beta-methylene ATP (6 microM) were examined separately and in the presence of the other receptor activator. When a nicotinic and P2X receptor agonist were applied together, mutually occlusive effects were generally observed. This occurred even with concentrations of agonists that in themselves generated little to no inward current. 3. The occlusive effects of nicotinic agonists on ATP-gated currents were blocked by the nicotinic receptor/ion channel blocker hexamethonium (150 microM). The occlusive effects of ATP analogues on inward currents generated by nicotinic agonists were blocked by the P2X receptor antagonist suramin (100 microM). 4. Mutual occlusion of the effects of nicotinic agonists and ATP analogues were also observed when currents through single channels were studied in excised (outside-out) patches. 5.

    "150": "Antihypertensive therapy is indicated for reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that accompanies arterial hypertension. Usually, pharmacological treatment is started as monotherapy, which, if unsuccessful, is followed by sequential monotherapy, or by combination therapy. Recent data indicate that combination therapy is required in more than 50% of the hypertensive population when the goal is to reduce blood pressure to below 140/90 mm Hg. The choice and doses of drugs used in combination therapy should be such that their synergistic effect on blood pressure is maximized, the tolerability of the drugs is maintained and side-effects are minimized. The combination of a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a beta-blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is one of the most commonly used combination therapies. Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies compared the antihypertensive effects of the dihydropyridine, barnidipine, with the beta-blocker, atenolol (n = 247), and the ACE inhibitor, enalapril (n = 155). The efficacy and tolerability of barnidipine in combination with either atenolol or enalapril was also investigated. Monotherapy with barnidipine was as effective in reducing blood pressure as monotherapy with either atenolol or enalapril. Combining barnidipine with either atenolol or enalapril reduced blood pressure further, and significantly increased the percentage of patients attaining the required reduction in blood pressure. When patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled by enalapril monotherapy were switched to barnidipine monotherapy, the majority then achieved the desired reduction in blood pressure. These results indicate that if barnidipine monotherapy fails to lower blood pressure to the desired values, its combination with either a beta-blocker or an ACE inhibitor is effective and well tolerated.",

Application of acetylcholine (10 microM) or epinephrine (1 microM) each produced small increases in intracellular Ca2+, but in combination they produced a Ca2+ increase of more than 10-fold. This synergistic Ca2+increase was a result of activation of muscarinic and alpha2-adrenergic receptors because a specific alpha2-adrenergic agonist could substitute for epinephrine in producing the response. The response could be blocked by a specific alpha2-antagonist and a muscarinic antagonist. An alpha1-agonist could not substitute for epinephrine in producing a synergistic increase nor could the synergism be blocked by alpha1- or beta-antagonists. The Ca2+ increase was largely produced by release from internal stores, because the peak amplitude of the response was nearly the same in the external solution containing a low Ca2+ concentration; however, the influx of Ca2+ into the cell was responsible for maintenance of a steady component of the Ca2+ increase during maintained drug stimulation and for refilling the internal stores.",

    "160": "Ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) was determined with trains of diastolic stimuli of 100 ms duration delivered by a subepicardial electrode inserted in the area subjected to ischaemia. Ischaemia was obtained by the complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, either near its origin during brief but increasing periods (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300 s), or half-way from its origin for a much longer time (more than 60 min).", 
    "161": "During transient proximal occlusion and isoprenaline infusion (0.25 microgram/kg/min), propranolol (50 micrograms/kg plus 2 micrograms/kg/min) attenuated both tachycardia and the fall in VFT to 0 mA. The shortening of MAP duration accompanying depolarization of the fibres was concurrently slowed down, and time to fibrillation prolonged (122 +/- 15 to 262 +/- 14 s, p < 0.001). In the absence of isoprenaline infusion, propranolol exerted similar effects, but to a lesser degree, in proportion to heart rate dependent on sympathetic activity. In contrast, it became unable to raise VFT before and during ischaemia, when heart rate was kept constant by pacing. After persistent midportion occlusion, significant differences in VFT were found only at the 5th min, depending on whether heart rate was accelerated by isoprenaline (0.8 +/- 0.2 mA), left normal (1.8 +/- 0.3 mA) or slowed down by propranolol (1.6 +/- 0.3 mA). Later on, especially after 15 and 25 min of ischaemia, VFT, which was below 1.0 mA, did not appear to be influenced by the activation or blockade of beta-ARs: spontaneous fibrillations were observed in the same number in this period with or without the administration of propranolol. Beyond 30 min after occlusion, the rise in VFT, subsequent to the first irreversible cell damage, also occurred in the same way.", 
    "162": "The prevention of ischaemic ventricular fibrillation by a beta-AR antagonist, judged from VFT, is easily checked experimentally when ischaemia is only transitory, especially if sympathetic activity is high. The maintenance of VFT at a relatively high level is essentially related to the depressant effect on the sinus rate. The same animal model does not give support to an effective protection in the first hour of infarction. However, the control of heart rate may also be beneficial in these circumstances by attenuating systemic haemodynamic disorders.", 
    "163": "All-trans-retinoic acid (RA), one of the active metabolites of vitamin A, can increase the expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) gene. To determine whether RA stimulates brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and modulates leptin gene expression in vivo, 6-month-old, vitamin-A sufficient, F344 x BN rats were administered a single dose of RA (7.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or the beta 3-adrenergic receptor (beta 3AR) specific agonist, CGP 12177 (0.75 mg/kg). Levels of UCP1 mRNA in BAT and leptin mRNA in perirenal white adipose tissue (WAT) were examined 5 h after treatment. mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were also examined in BAT and perirenal WAT. Administration of CGP 12177 caused the expected increase in UCP1 mRNA levels. RA treatment also significantly increased UCP1 mRNA levels but to a lesser extent than CGP 12177. In contrast, there was no acute effect of RA on whole body oxygen consumption, one measure of BAT thermogenesis. Both CGP 12177 and RA treatment decreased levels of leptin mRNA to a similar extent. RA treatment had no effect on mRNA levels of LPL in BAT or perirenal WAT. There were no changes in total DNA content, total protein content, or in the levels of beta-actin mRNA in either BAT or perirenal WAT upon administration of RA or CGP 12177. Thus, the acute effects of RA paralleled the effects of the beta 3AR specific agonist, CGP 12177, on UCP1 and leptin gene expression. This involvement of RA in positive regulation of UCP1 mRNA and negative regulation of leptin mRNA suggests a contrasting role for RA in energy homeostasis.",

Both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been reported to increase vagal modulation of heart rate and baroreflex sensitivity, but the relations between the antihypertensive and vagal cardiac effects of these drugs have remained unclear in essential hypertension. In the present study we evaluated the effects of a 4-week crossover monotherapy with metoprolol and ramipril on spectrum analysis indices of heart rate variability in the supine rest and head-up tilted positions, baroreflex sensitivity (phenylephrine method), and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in 12 formerly untreated stage 1-2 essential hypertensive patients. Compared to the pretreatment values, both drugs decreased BP similarly and significantly. However, the drugs showed different effects on cardiac vagal activity: metoprolol increased significantly mean R-R interval, R-R interval total, and high-frequency variability at supine rest and baroreflex sensitivity, but ramipril did not significantly affect these variables. The metoprolol-induced decrease in ambulatory BP correlated with the prolongation of the R-R interval and the increase of high-frequency variability at supine rest. The present data show that 4-week treatment with metoprolol increases tonic and reflex vagal cardiac activity, whereas ramipril does not affect vagal cardiac control in essential hypertension. Increase in vagal activity may contribute to the BP-lowering effect of metoprolol in hypertensive patients.",

The potency of 5-hydroxypropafenone to block fast sodium channels is comparable to that of its parent. We report the positive correlation between plasma concentrations and electrocardiographic changes in a patient with severe oral self-poisoning. Serial ECG changes were measured and plasma concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The initial plasma concentrations of propafenone were in the toxic range and correlated with the widening of the QRS-complex. The slow decline in concentration during this first phase might relate to saturation of the isoenzyme CYP2D6. The half-life of propafenone, calculated from the second phase, was approximately 3 hours, defining the patient as a fast metabolizer. The initial concentrations of the metabolite N-depropylpropafenone were surprisingly higher than those of 5-hydroxypropafenone which may also be due to saturation of CYP2D6.",

The mean percentage of relative standard deviation (RSD) of the experimental concentrations (C), were less than 4.29% for proportionality and less than 3.68% for precision for any of the drugs, which allowed the quantitation of beta-blockers assayed at concentrations in the range 25-0.78 micrograms.ml-1. The error structures for the HPLC analysis were: SD (micrograms.ml-1) = 5.02 x 10(-2) C for atenolol, SD (micrograms.ml-1) = 4.55 x 10(-2) + 0.63 x 10(-2) C - 7.58 x 10(-6) C3 for metoprolol and SD (micrograms.ml-1) = 2.73 x 10(-2) C - 3.49 x 10(-4) C2 for propranolol.

    "169": "There are no available data on the direct effect of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) on the myocardial contractility in mammalian hearts. Thus we studied the inotropic and chronotropic effects of CNP-22 and BNP-32 compared with those of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-28 using the isolated, blood-perfused canine right atrial or left ventricular preparations. CNP increased the atrial contractile force in a dose-dependent manner with a small increase in sinus rate in isolated atria, whereas neither ANP nor BNP changed atrial force and rate. CNP but not BNP also increased the ventricular contractile force in isolated ventricles. Pretreatment with a high dose (3 nmol) of CNP attenuated the positive inotropic response to CNP at a low dose (1 nmol) but not to norepinephrine. A guanylyl cyclase-linked natriuretic peptide receptor antagonist, HS-142-1, inhibited the increases in atrial contractile force and sinus rate in response to CNP, but it did not affect the positive cardiac responses to norepinephrine. Propranolol did not block the positive cardiac responses to CNP. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine in rates of 0.6 to 1.3 mumol/ min attenuated the CNP-induced positive inotropic responses, when it potentiated the positive inotropic response to norepinephrine. On the other hand, parasympathetic nerve stimulation attenuated the positive cardiac responses to CNP and norepinephrine. These results demonstrate that CNP increases myocardial contractile force with a small increase in sinus rate mediated by guanylyl cyclase-linked natriuretic peptide receptors, probably type B receptors in the dog heart, and suggest that the positive inotropic response to CNP is influenced by the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent signal transduction.",

The inhibitory responses to SIN-1 and the cGMP analogs were not influenced by the K+ blockers apamin, charybdotoxin, iberiotoxin, or glibenclamide, whereas relaxations induced by alpha,beta-methylene-ATP were abolished by apamin and tetraethylammonium. The NO-donor SIN-1 and the cGMP analogs were able to inhibit contractions induced by activation of L-type Ca2+ channels (BAY-K-8644), by carbachol (CCh), and by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), a blocker of sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase. However, the inhibition of the combined CPA and CCh response was reduced and the dose-response curve of SIN-1 shifted to the right. Intracellular Ca2+ stores were emptied by incubation in Ca2+-free buffer and repetitive stimulation with CCh or BAY-K-8644. After restoration of extracellular Ca2+, the inhibitory effect of SIN-1 and pCPT-cGMP was only attenuated, whereas in the additional presence of CPA, the inhibitory effect of SIN-1 was blocked and the effect of 8-BrcGMP reduced. Thus depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores attenuated the effect of SIN-1 and 8-BrcGMP, suggesting an involvement of functional Ca2+ stores.",

Fixed-dose combination therapy with two different classes of antihypertensive agents will achieve goal pressures in more than 70%. The sixth Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure has suggested that the use of combination therapy is appropriate as initial treatment. The advantages of combinations include: 1) greater blood pressure decrease and response rates than monotherapy; 2) fewer side effects with small doses of two drugs than with large doses of one agent; 3) improved adherence to treatment; and 4) possibly lower cost of therapy. Many different combinations of diuretics and beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, as well as ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are available. Two of these, Ziac and Capozide, have been approved as initial therapy. It is possible that the number of hypertensive individuals controlled at goal blood pressure levels will be increased if combination therapy is used as initial treatment.",

    "178": "Systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher in the UFF patients than in the controls (p = 0.006, p = 0.028, p = 0.013). Beta-blockers were used by 12 of the UFF patients, but only 2/ 18 controls (p < 0.0001). There was no intergroup difference in number of women, patient age or weight, incidence of diabetes or previous peritonitis, duration of PD, serum levels of albumin, creatinine, iron, or ferritin, or dosage of erythropoietin. Correlation was found between the daily amount of glucose instilled into the abdomen and serum triglycerides (r = +0.72, p < 0.001), total cholesterol (r = +0.56, p = 0.008), and HbA1C (r =-0.41, p = 0.039). Many patients were high absorbers of dialysis glucose.",

    "180": "A 47-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of general fatigue and dyspnea. She had been diagnosed with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) when she was 39 years of age, on the basis of Raynaud's phenomenon, proximal sclerosis, and pigmentation of the skin. On admission, her blood pressure was 206/128 mmHg. Funduscopy revealed grade III (Keith & Wagener) hypertensive retinopathy. Laboratory data showed positivity for anti-nuclear antibody and anticardiolipin beta 2 glycoprotein I antibody, and the plasma level of renin activity (PRA) was abnormally high. Chest X-ray and UCG revealed massive pericardial effusion. On the second hospital day, she was operated on for pericardiodiaphragmatic fenestration. The volume of pericardial effusion amounted to more than 2000 ml. Post operative malignant hypertension persisted. Laboratory data showed thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and acute renal failure. We diagnosed scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. Following the initiation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) combined with calcium antagonist and alpha-one blocker, her blood pressure and PRA decreased. She also had been treated with aspirin 81 mg daily. These therapies were effective in recovering the platelet count and stopped the progression of anemia and renal failure. Although either the finding of large pericardial effusion or SRC is associated with poor prognosis in PSS, this case has had a good clinical course. In this case, the findings suggested that anti-phospholipid antibody may have contributed to the pericarditis and SRC.", 
    "181": "A case is presented of an 18-year-old male who had been resuscitated following an episode of sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation. The patient was noted to have an abnormal deflection in the terminal QRS on surface ECG and an abnormal signal-averaged ECG demonstrating a late potential coincident with the terminal QRS abnormality on the ECG. The patient had easily inducible polymorphic ventricular tachycardia during electrophysiologic study, which was suppressed by quinidine but not by procainamide or beta blockers. The surface ECG and signal-averaged ECG also were normalized by quinidine but not by procainamide or beta blockers. The patient had no further arrhythmias on quinidine for 6 years until he inexplicably discontinued his medication and died suddenly shortly thereafter. The present case may represent a unique familial sudden death syndrome or possibly a variant of the sudden death syndrome associated with right bundle branch block and ST elevation in V1 through V3. Currently available data suggest that, in such patients, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator may provide better protection from sudden death than does antiarrhythmic drug therapy."
