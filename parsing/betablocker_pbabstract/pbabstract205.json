In order to discard unspecific drug-actions on general activity, all treatments studied in the anxiety paradigms were also analyzed in the open field test. Results showed that A. cherimolia induced anxiolytic-like actions at the doses of 6.25, 12.5, 25.0 and 50.0 mg/kg. Picrotoxin (0.25 mg/kg), a GABA-gated chloride ion channel blocker, antagonized the anxiolytic-like actions of A. cherimolia, while a sub-effective dose of muscimol (0.5 mg/kg), a selective GABA(A) receptor agonist, facilitated the effects of a sub-optimal dose of A. cherimolia (3.12 mg/kg). Thus, the involvement of the GABA(A) receptor complex in the anxiolytic-like actions of A. cherimolia hexane extract is suggested. In addition the extract was also able to enhance the duration of sodium pentobarbital induced sleeping time. Taken together, results indicate that the hexane extract of A. cherimolia has depressant activity on the Central Nervous System and could interact with the GABA(A) receptor complex. On the other hand, the chromatographic separation of this extract led to the isolation of palmitone, and beta-sitosterol as major constituents. In addition a GC-MS study of some fractions revealed the presence of several compounds such beta-cariophyllene, beta-selinene, alpha-cubebene, and linalool that have been reported to show effects on behavior that could explain some of the extract effects.",

    "3": "Eight hundred eighteen patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting between November 2002 and August 2004. Seven hundred thirty-seven (90%) received insulin. Fifty-seven percent did not have a preoperative diagnosis of diabetes. The trigger for insulin initiation was decreased sequentially from 150 mg/dL to 110 mg/dL, but the measure of good control remained the same: glucose less than 130 mg/dL. The factor most highly predictive of glucose being well controlled was the protocol with the 110 mg/dL trigger for insulin (p < 0.001). Patient factors such as age, ejection fraction, preoperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or beta-blocker use, or time on cardiopulmonary bypass were not significantly associated with glucose control. During the course of the protocols, the rate of mediastinitis decreased from 1.6% to 0%.",

Six chiral drugs, such as anisodamine, ketoconazole, propranolol, promethazine, adrenaline and chlorphenamine enantiomers, belonging to different classes of compounds of pharmaceutical interest were resolved. The chiral resolution (R(S)) was strongly influenced by the concentrations of the cyclodextrin derivative, the background electrolyte, and the pH of the background electrolyte. Under the conditions of 50 mmol/L tris-phosphate buffer at pH 2.5 containing 5 mmol/L 2-O-(2-hydroxybutyl)-beta-CD, the baseline separation of enantiomers, such as anisodamine (R(S) = 3.10), ketoconazole (R(S) = 3.01), propranolol (R(S) = 3.87), promethazine (R(S) = 3.63), adrenaline (R(S) = 3.42) and chlorphenamine (R(S) = 2.96), could be achieved.", 
    "6": "Recently the guideline committee of the Dutch College of General Practitioners advocated the use of metoprolol instead of atenolol in patients with an indication for beta-blockers. This recommendation was based on a recent meta-analysis in The Lancet in which no effect was observed in favour ofatenolol compared with placebo on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and myocardial infarction. Atenolol also had a higher total mortality and stroke risk compared with other antihypertensive agents. Apart from the presence of statistical heterogeneity and the inappropriate use of a fixed-effect model, the studies referred to in this meta-analysis were also clinically heterogeneous. Furthermore, in most studies, only older patients were included. In older patients with hypertension, it is known that beta-blockers are less effective than diuretics or calcium antagonists. Comparative trials between atenolol and metoprolol in the treatment of hypertension have not been performed with regard to cardiovascular endpoints. We conclude that there is no evidence that atenolol is better or worse than metoprolol in the treatment of the hypertensive patient. For the treatment of patients with heart failure, however, lipophilic beta-blockers such as metoprolol may be preferred, as these drugs have been more thoroughly evaluated for this indication.",

One hundred and twenty patients with common migraine (migraine without aura) aged from 3 to 15 years who met the defined criteria enrolled into the study. Randomly the patients were divided in two groups of A and B, treating with sodium Valproate and Propranolol, respectively. Three phases of baseline period (phase I), titration and adjustment period (phases II) and fixed -dose treatment period (phase III) have been designed. A total of 57 patients in group A, and 58 patients in group B completed all phases of the trial. Seventy two percent of patients in group A and 69% of patients in group B have responded to Sodium Valproate and Propranolol, respectively, as a reduction of more than 50% in headache frequency per month. Further more both drugs have shown efficacy in reducing the severity and duration of headache and also better response to rescue medications (p value <0.01). There was no significant difference in all previously mentioned therapeutic effects between two groups (p value <0.05).",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible hypothalamic antihypertensive effect of metoprolol and its action on aminergic neurotransmission in sham-operated (SO) rats and aortic coarctated (ACo) rats at a chronic hypertensive stage using the microdialysis technique. 2. Hypothalamic metoprolol concentrations and their cardiovascular effects were measured after the intravenous administration of 3 mg/kg metoprolol. Based on metoprolol concentrations reached in the anterior hypothalamus, in a second experiment the anterior hypothalamus of SO and ACo animals was perfused with Ringer's solution containing approximately 7.5 microg/mL metoprolol. The cardiovascular effects of metoprolol perfusion and changes in hypothalamic dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 5-hydroxyindol acetic acid (5-HIAA) levels were measured during the perfusion. 3. After i.v. administration of metoprolol, a greater hypotensive effect was observed in ACo rats than in SO animals (Delta mean arterial pressure (MAP) -23.8 +/- 2.1 vs-13.8 +/- 1.3 mmHg, respectively; n = 5 for both groups). Metoprolol rapidly reached the central nervous system (CNS) in both groups of rats and its levels were similar in SO and ACo rats. Intrahypothalamic perfusion with metoprolol induced a significative decrease in blood pressure in ACo animals (DeltaMAP -13.3 +/- 1.5 mmHg; n = 5; P < 0.05 vs Ringer perfusion), but not in SO rats (DeltaMAP 3.4 +/- 2.7 mmHg; n = 5). Metoprolol perfusion reduced hypothalamic levels of DOPAC in ACo rats (65 +/- 7% of basal levels; n = 5; P < 0.05 vs Ringer perfusion), but not in SO animals (87 +/- 5% of basal levels; n = 5). There were no changes in hypothalamic concentrations 5-HIAA observed in either experimental group. 4. In conclusion, metoprolol exerts a greater hypotensive effect in chronic ACo animals, suggesting a participation of beta-adrenoceptors in the maintenance of the hypertensive stage. Metoprolol distribution in the CNS is not affected by ACo. The hypotensive effect of metoprolol perfusion in ACo rats suggested that hypothalamic beta-adrenoceptor blockade is part of the antihypertensive effect of metoprolol in chronic ACo rats. The effects of metoprolol on DOPAC levels suggest a reduction of dopamine turnover in hypertensive animals, but not in SO rats.",

The convince dosing regimen, once-daily, higher efficacy and higher systemic safety profile seen with PGA compared with beta-blockers caused that these agents have been approved by regulatory bodies for both the first-line and adjunctive therapy. Short, retrospective analysis of the medical treatment of glaucoma in the Ophthalmology Clinic of Military Health Service Institute in Warsaw, in 2003-2004, was presented.", 
    "16": "Published guidelines recommend continuing beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in patients undergoing stress testing. We evaluated the role of pharmacological versus exercise stress testing in achieving target heart rate (THR) among patients on beta-adrenergic blockade. We compared data from 140 patients who underwent dobutamine stress echo (DSE) and 143 patients who underwent exercise treadmill testing (ETT). In both groups, beta-adrenergic blocker was continued at the time of stress testing. Overall, patients undergoing DSE achieved THR more frequently than ETT. With beta-adrenergic blockade, DSE patients met THR more frequently than ETT patients (p < 0.001). Without beta-adrenergic blockade, there was no difference between either modality in achieving THR. In both DSE and ETT patients, absence of beta-adrenergic blockade increased the odds of achieving THR [odds ratio (OR): 2.46, p = 0.042 and OR: 7.44, p < 0.001, respectively]. Atropine use with DSE increased the odds of achieving THR (OR: 3.76, p = 0.006). In conclusion, pharmacological stress testing appears to be superior to exercise stress testing in achieving THR among patients on beta-adrenergic blockade.",

Achieved systolic BP reduction favored losartan over atenolol by -1.8 mm Hg in LRG (P=NS) and -0.7 mm Hg (P=0.001) in HRG, but no significant differences occurred in diastolic or mean BP in either group. In conclusion, losartan compared with atenolol reduces the risk of stroke, new-onset diabetes, and new-onset atrial fibrillation in the LRG and the HRG.", 
    "56": "The effects of IV anesthetics are enhanced by increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) because of a greater delivery of drugs to the brain. In contrast, mathematical simulations suggest that a decrease in CBF, by increasing regional drug uptake and decreasing drug washout, enhances the efficacy of intraarterial drugs. We hypothesized that administrating intracarotid anesthetics during cerebral hypoperfusion will significantly prolong the duration of electroencephalographic (EEG) silence. We tested our hypothesis on New Zealand White rabbits. In the first group of 7 animals, we observed that decreasing CBF by approximately 70% attenuated, but did not abolish, EEG activity. Subsequently, 9 animals received 3 intracarotid injections of 3 mg of thiopental (thiopental-1, thiopental + hypoperfusion, and thiopental-2). The first and third injections were made under physiological conditions. The second drug injection was made during cerebral hypoperfusion. Compared with injection of thiopental-1 and -2, thiopental + hypoperfusion resulted in a profound increase in EEG silence (from 45 +/- 5 and 67 +/- 27 s, to 206 +/- 46 s, respectively, n = 9, P < 0.0001). The EEG recovery profile was similar during all three thiopental challenges. The study suggests that modulation of CBF is an important tool for enhancing intraarterial drug delivery to the brain.", 
    "57": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of latanoprost monotherapy on the aqueous humour concentrations of TGF-beta1, MMP-2, TIMP-2, MMP-9 and gelatinolytic activity in patients treated for exfoliative glaucoma (XFG). Aqueous samples from 50 XFG patients treated with latanoprost and 50 age-matched XFG patients treated with timolol were collected during phacoemulsification cataract surgery. The concentrations of TGF-beta1, MMP-2, TIMP-2, MMP-9 and gelatinase activity were determined by commercial immunoassays. The mean active TGF-beta1 concentration in the aqueous was significantly lower in XFG patients treated with latanoprost compared with those treated with timolol (3.1 +/- 0.65 vs 13.4 +/- 1.5 pg ml(-1)); (P = 0.0014). The mean total MMP-2 concentration was lower in latanoprost treated patients (31.75 +/- 3.8 vs 81.5 +/- 7.2 ng ml(-1)); (P < 0.0001). The TIMP-2 concentration was also lower in XFG-latanoprost treated patients (73.8 +/- 6.81 vs 101.28 +/- 7.29 ng ml(-1)); (P = 0.0096). Latanoprost monotherapy has a marked effect on the aqueous concentration of TGF-beta1, MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in XFG patients. A better understanding of its effect on the pathobiology of the disease may lead to its earlier use in the disease process to prevent progression from XFS to XFG.", 
    "58": "Forty percent to 50% of patients with chronic heart failure have normal or relatively normal left ventricular ejections fractions. These are much more frequently women and tend to be older than those with reduced ejection fractions. In most, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction plays a major role in the genesis of heart failure. Until recently, these patients have been systematically excluded from heart failure trials, so that there are no proven treatments for this group. This article reviews the recent and ongoing trials in patients with diastolic heart failure, which hopefully will lead to improved treatment and outcomes.", 
    "59": "There is little objective to guide the therapy of patients with diastolic heart failure. Because of the similarities of pathophysiology abnormalities in diastolic and systolic heart failure, it is a reasonable inference to suggest that the proven therapy for systolic heart failure may also be of benefit in patients with diastolic heart failure. Treatment of underlying or exacerbating conditions in diastolic heart failure, such as hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemia, diabetes, anemia, obesity and pulmonary disease is an important means of managing diastolic heart failure. Control of systolic blood pressure is effective in improving and preventing the development of diastolic heart failure. Treatment of diastolic heart failure is most effective when it is associated with hypertension. Production of systolic arterial pressure acutely reduces pulmonary congestion, ischemia, and chronically may lead to regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with diastolic heart failure in the absence of hypertension are very difficult to treat.",

In addition to treating the culprit lesion mechanically, admission for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for coronary artery disease (CAD) gives an opportunity for the interventional cardiologist to optimize medical therapy. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current medical literature pertaining to cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction and vascular event prevention in the setting of PCI, with emphasis on antiplatelet therapies, beta-blockers, HMG-Co A reductase inhibitors (statins) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with regard to therapy optimization during PCI and for chronic CAD.

    "65": "A liquid chromatography stationary phase containing immobilized membranes obtained from a cell line that expresses the human organic cation transporter (hOCT1-IAM) has been used to study the binding of the enantiomers of propranolol, atenolol, pseudoephedrine, and alpha-methylbenzylamine to the immobilized hOCT1. Frontal displacement chromatography was used to determine the binding affinities (K(d) values), and the data demonstrate that there was an enantioselective difference in the K(d) values of the enantiomers of propranolol, atenolol, and pseudoephedrine, while alpha-methylbenzylamine did not significantly bind to the transporter. Competitive inhibition studies with the cell line used to create the chromatographic column demonstrated that, for the enantiomers of propranolol, the ratio of the chromatographically determined K(d) values [K(d (+)-(R)-propranolol)/K(d (-)-(S)-propranolol) = 2.98] reflected an enantioselective difference in the functional activity of the two enantiomers [IC(50 (+)-(R)-propranolol)/IC(50 (-)-(S)-propranolol) = 2.75]. The chromatographically determined K(d) values were used to construct an initial pharmacophore which contains a hydrogen bond donating site that appears to be responsible for the observed enantioselectivity.", 
    "66": "1 Recent evidence supports additional subtypes of vasodilator beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) besides the 'classical' beta(2). The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of beta-ARs in the wall of rat mesenteric resistance artery (MRA), to establish the relative roles of beta-ARs in smooth muscle and other cell types in mediating vasodilatation and to analyse this in relation to the functional pharmacology. 2 We first examined the vasodilator beta-AR subtype using 'subtype-selective' agonists against the, commonly employed, phenylephrine-induced tone. Concentration-related relaxation was produced by isoprenaline (pEC(50): 7.70+/-0.1) (beta(1) and beta(2)). Salbutamol (beta(2)), BRL 37344 (beta(3)) and CGP 12177 (atypical beta) caused relaxation but were 144, 100 and 263 times less potent than isoprenaline; the 'beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist' CL 316243 was ineffective. 3 In arteries precontracted with 5-HT or U 46619, isoprenaline produced concentration-related relaxation but salbutamol, BRL 37344, CGP 12177 and CL 316243 did not. SR 59230A, CGP 12177 and BRL 37344 caused a parallel rightward shift in the concentration-response curve to phenylephrine indicating competitive alpha(1)-AR antagonism, explaining the false-positive 'vasodilator' action against phenylephrine-induced tone. Endothelial denudation but not L-NAME slightly attenuated isoprenaline-mediated vasodilatation in phenylephrine and U 46619 precontracted MRA. 4 The beta-AR fluorescent ligand BODIPY TMR-CGP 12177 behaved as an irreversible beta(1)-AR antagonist in MRA and bound to the surface and inside vascular smooth muscle cells in intact vascular wall. Beta-ARs in smooth muscle cells were observed in a perinuclear location, consistent with the location of Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. 5 Binding of BODIPY TMR-CGP 12177 was inhibited by BAAM (1 microM) in all three vascular tunics, confirming the presence of beta-ARs in adventitia, media and intima. Binding in adventitia was observed in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Lack of co-localisation with a fluorescent ligand for alpha-ARs confirms the selectivity of BODIPY TMR-CGP 12177 for beta-ARs over alpha-ARs. 6 Our results support the presence of functional vasodilator beta(1)-ARs and show that they are mainly located in smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, we have demonstrated, for the first time, the usefulness of BODIPY TMR-CGP 12177 for identifying beta-AR distribution in the 'living' vascular wall.", 
    "67": "We report a fetus at 33 weeks of gestation with supraventricular tachycardia, which was successfully managed by transplacental administration of an antiarrhythmic agent. Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) revealed supraventricular tachycardia of the long RP' tachycardia type. Transplacental administration of sotalol, instead of digoxin, was selected as the first-line drug, and it successfully converted supraventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm. The diagnosis of the type of supraventricular tachycardia was confirmed by electrocardiography after birth. Sotalol was also effective after birth to maintain sinus rhythm. This case demonstrates that fMCG is potentially useful for prenatal differentiation of the type of supraventricular tachycardia and for prenatal treatment of fetal tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "68": "Between Dec 12, 2002 and Aug 22, 2004, 84 operative patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) were subjected to AF ablation with microwave energy. Of these, 49 patients were female; their ages ranged between 20 and 72 years (mean, 43.1 years). Most patients suffered from mitral disease, accompanied in over one third of cases with tricuspid insufficiency. Thirteen patients had aortic valve disease, mostly with mitral involvement. Three patients had coronary artery disease, three had atrial septal defect and one had a left atrial (LA) myxoma. Seventy-two patients underwent endocardial ablation and 12 patients underwent epicardial ablation. Operative mortality was 4 (4.8%), and there were no major untoward postoperative events. Fifty seven patients (71.3%) had their AF converted to sinus rhythm immediately after surgery. Amiodarone or sotalol was used in all postoperative patients for 6 months, except in 8 who had bradycardia. Electrical defibrillation was utilized in cases of atrial flutter or persistent AF. Seventy patients were followed for at least 6 months. In total, 52 of them (74.3%) are still in sinus rhythm. We believe microwave ablation is a satisfactory and safe method of AF ablation, and because it is brief, it can be added to surgical procedures without undue risk to the patient.", 
    "69": "Compared to the currently available therapeutic drugs for peripheral vascular diseases, agents that are selective for relaxing pulmonary circulation are scarce. The present study was undertaken, using isometric tension change measurement and whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology methods, to evaluate the vascular relaxation effect and the underlying mechanisms involved of two naturally found alkaloids: paeonol (2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-acetophenone), acetovanillone (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone) and the non-substituted analogue acetophenone on pulmonary artery of Sprague-Dawley rats. Cumulative administration (3 microM-1 mM) of acetophenone analogues resulted in a concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine (1 microM) pre-contracted pulmonary artery. A relative order of inhibitory potency, estimated by comparing the concentration at which a 50% relaxation of phenylephrine-induced contraction observed was: acetovanillone > paeonol > acetophenone. Endothelial denudation and inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (with 20 microM N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl-ester) only moderately suppressed (17.6 +/- 4.2%) acetovanillone- but not paeonol- or acetophenone-mediated maximum relaxation. Glibenclamide (3 microM, an ATP-sensitive K(+) (IK(ATP)) channel blocker) markedly attenuated all acetophenone analogues-mediated endothelium-independent relaxation. Neither cis-N-(2-phenylcyclopentyl)azacyclotridec-1-en-2-amine (MDL 12330A, 10 microM), iberiotoxin (300 nM), 4-aminopyridine (3 mM), (+/-)-propranolol (1 microM, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker) nor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) (3 microM, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor) altered endothelium-independent relaxation. In electrophysiological experiments using single pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, acetovanillone, paeonol, acetophenone and cromakalim activated glibenclamide-sensitive, IK(ATP) channels. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that acetophenone analogues caused pulmonary artery relaxation through opening of IK(ATP) channels. In addition, acetovanillone-mediated pulmonary artery relaxation is partly depended on nitric oxide released from endothelium.", 
    "70": "The role of phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor at serine-2808 (RyRS2808) in congestive heart failure (CHF) is controversial, and effects of RyRS2808 phosphorylation on contraction are unclear. It has been reported that diastolic sarcomere length (SL) fluctuations accompany propagating contractile waves due to propagating SR Ca2+ release in trabeculae from rats with CHF. Here, we studied the influence of RyR destabilization by FK506 and isoproterenol on twitch force (Ftw) and SL fluctuations in right ventricular (RV) trabeculae. We measured phosphorylation of RyRS2808 in rats with myocardial infarction (MI) with or without beta-blockade and in rats during isoproterenol stimulation in order to assess the role of RyRS2808 phosphorylation in SL fluctuations in failing hearts.", 
    "71": "Five groups of male Lewis Brown-Norway rats were studied 3 months after MI: i) Sham; ii) MI with CHF (cMI); iii) MI without CHF; iv) metoprolol-treated MI, with and without CHF. The root mean square (RMSSL) of SL fluctuations in RV trabeculae was calculated.", 
    "72": "RMSSL increased strongly both following a short train of stimuli at 2.5 Hz and following catecholamine activation in trabeculae from MI with CHF, resulting in a decrease in Ftw in proportion to RMSSL. RyRS2808 phosphorylation was increased significantly in the left ventricle (LV; approximately 58%, P<0.05) but not in the RV (n.s.) in MI rats with CHF. FK506 tripled high frequency stimulation-induced RMSSL in nonfailing trabecula but did not further enhance RMSSL in failing trabecula. Isoproterenol increased RMSSL in nonfailing trabeculae only modestly despite a substantial increase in RyRS2808 phosphorylation in the RV (approximately 60%, P<0.05). Isoproterenol induced SL fluctuation without an increase in RV-RyRS2808 phosphorylation in failing trabeculae. Chronic beta-blockade decreased high frequency and catecholamine stimulation-induced RMSSL while RyRS2808 phosphorylation in the RV was indistinguishable from that in cMI.", 
    "73": "Acute RyRS2808 phosphorylation by itself does not cause spontaneous contractile waves owing to RyR2 destabilization. Spontaneous contractile waves in CHF are not caused by RyRS2808 phosphorylation alone, suggesting that factors other than RyRS2808 phosphorylation affect RyR function.", 
    "74": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is released from the gut in response to nutrient ingestion. Intravenous (iv) administration of GLP-1 (50 pmol-20 nmol) elicited dose-dependent increases in the rate of whole-body O2 consumption (VO2), an index of energy expenditure, and heart rate of urethane-anesthetized rats. The body core (colonic) temperature increased up to 0.3 degrees C without accompanying alteration of tail skin temperature. Intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of GLP-1 induced a slower and smaller increase in VO2 than the intravenous administration. The injection of glucagon-like peptide-2 (iv or icv) had no effect on VO2, body temperatures, or heart rate. Decerebration had no effect on the thermogenic responses induced by the iv administration of GLP-1, suggesting that the forebrain is not essential for these responses. However, cervical spinal transection greatly attenuated the responses, suggesting the critical involvement of the lower brainstem. Adrenalectomy or pretreatment with an autonomic ganglion blocker, hexamethonium, or a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, also significantly attenuated the thermogenic response. However, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or celiac-superior mesenteric ganglionectomy had no effect. Rats made insulin-deficient by pretreatment with streptozotocin also exhibited the normal thermogenic response to GLP-1. These results suggest the involvement of the GLP-1 in postprandial energy expenditure, mediated by the lower brainstem and sympathoadrenal system.", 
    "75": "Recently, single-dose drug packaging systems, allowing the administration of multiple drugs in a single pill, have become popular for the convenience of the patient. The quality of drugs and an accurate measurement of their photostabilities within this system, however, have not been carefully addressed. Drugs that are unstable in light should be carefully handled to protect their potency and ensure their safety. Propranolol (1), a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, is widely used for angina pectoris, arrhythmia, and hypertension. Due to its naphthalene skeleton, this drug may be both light unstable and a photosensitizing agent. In this study, we isolated three photodegraded products of propranolol (1): 1-naphthol (2), N-acetylpropranolol (3), and N-formylpropranolol (4). The structures of these compounds were determined by spectroscopic methods and chemical syntheses. We also examined the acute toxicities of these substances in mice and their binding to beta-adrenergic receptors using rat cerebellum cortex membranes. Although the photoproducts isolated in this study did not exhibit any acute toxicity or significant binding to beta-adrenergic receptors, these results serve as a warning to single-dose packaging systems, as propranolol (1) must be handled carefully to protect the compound from light-induced degradation.", 
    "76": "Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity at the time of acquisition is associated with human memory. However, rather than SNS activity per se, it may be afferent baroreflex feedback that is responsible for this effect. A pharmacological design was employed to unload (SNP, sodium nitro-prusside) and load (norepinephrine) baroreceptors. In addition to two placebo periods, epinephrine and esmolol (a peripherally acting beta1-blocker) served as control conditions for altered cardiac perception. During drug infusion blood pressure, heart rate, and perception of heartbeat were tested. Twenty-four healthy men were participated. The participants viewed emotional slides while their electromyographic eye blink responses to random noise bursts were measured (affective startle modulation paradigm) to determine potential drug impact on emotional processing. Subjects were not informed that memory testing would take place after 4 weeks. Drugs did not impact startle, thus indicating unbiased emotional processing at the time of acquisition. Norepinephrine had no effect on heartbeat perception, but improved (p = .002) recognition memory. SNP (p = .0001) increased heartbeat perception but impaired (p = .038) recognition memory. Epinephrine, on the other hand, increased heartbeat perception (p = .0001) yet did not impair but partially improve memory (effect on high arousing pictures only: p = .05). Heartbeat perception in the placebo condition did not correlate with recognition memory (p's > .5). We suggest that baroreflex unloading, with subsequent feedback activation of the SNS, impairs long-term incidental visual recognition memory in humans while baroreflex loading enhances it. Further, we propose that these memory effects are neither secondary to cardiac sensations that accompany SNS activation nor to altered emotional picture processing at the time of acquisition.", 
    "77": "A simple, extraction-free spectrophotometric method is proposed for the analysis of some beta-blockers, namely atenolol, timolol and nadolol. The method is based on the interaction of the drugs in chloroform with 0.1% chloroformic solutions of acidic sulphophthalein dyes to form stable, yellow-coloured, ion-pair complexes peaking at 415 nm. The dyes used were bromophenol blue (BPB), bromothymol blue (BTB) and bromocresol purple (BCP). Under the optimum conditions, the three drugs could be assayed in the concentration range 1-10 microg ml(-1) with correlation coefficient (n = 5) more than 0.999 in all cases. The stoichiometry of the reaction was found to be 1:1 in all cases and the conditional stability constant (K(F)) of the complexes have been calculated. The free energy changes (DeltaG) were determined for all complexes formed. The interference likely to be introduced from co-formulated drugs was studied and their tolerance limits were determined. The proposed method was then applied to dosage-forms the percentage recoveries ranges from 99.12-100.95, and the results obtained were compared favorably with those given with the official methods.", 
    "78": "The effects of AJ-9677 on metabolic parameters were examined in rats that had or had not been chronically treated with this beta3-adrenoceptor agonist. A challenge administration of AJ-9677 increased both the temperature of brown adipose tissue and energy expenditure in both groups of rats. However, whereas the former effect was subject to desensitization, the latter effect was augmented by prior chronic administration of AJ-9677. Whereas a challenge administration of AJ-9677 induced a decrease in the respiratory quotient that persisted for at least 15 h in rats pretreated with vehicle, the initial decrease in this parameter lasted for only 4 h in rats pretreated with AJ-9677. These results suggest that, in rats subjected to chronic treatment with AJ-9677, a challenge administration of this drug increased energy expenditure by stimulation not only of fat oxidation but also of glucose oxidation.", 
    "79": "Both EVL and drug therapy are effective in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. Comparisons between the two modalities are few, and only in cirrhotics. This prospective randomized controlled trial compared EVL with drug therapy (propranolol + ISMN) in the prevention of rebleeds from esophageal varices in cirrhotic and noncirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) patients. One hundred thirty-seven variceal bleeders were randomized to EVL (Group I; n = 71) or drug therapy (Group II; n = 66). In Group I, EVL was done every 2 weeks till obliteration of varices. In Group II, propranolol (dose sufficient to reduce heart rate to 55 bpm/maximum tolerated dose) and ISMN (incremental dose up to 20 mg BD) were administered. Group I and II patients had comparable baseline characteristics, follow-up (12.4 vs. 11.1 months), cirrhotics and noncirrhotics [50(70.4%) and 21(29.6%) vs. 51(77.3%) and 15(22.7%)] and frequency of Child's A (35 vs. 27), B (26 vs. 28), and C (9 vs. 11). The mean daily dose was 109 +/- 46 mg propranolol and 34 +/- 11 mg ISMN and was comparable in cirrhotic and NCPH patients. Upper GI bleeds occurred in 10 patients in Group I (5 from esophageal varices) and in 18 patients in Group II (15 from esophageal varices) (P = 0.06). The actuarial probability of rebleeding from esophageal varices at 24 months was 22% in Group I and 37% in Group II (P = 0.02). The probability of bleed was significantly higher in Child's C compared to Child's A/B cirrhotics (P = 0.02). On subgroup analysis, in NCPH patients, the actuarial probability of bleed at 24 months was significantly lower in Group I compared to Group II (25% vs 37%; P = 0.01). In cirrhotics, there was no difference in the probability of rebleeding between patients in Group I and those in Group II (P = 0.74). In Group II, 25.7% patients had adverse effects of drug therapy and 9% patients had to stop propranolol due to serious adverse effects, none required stopping ISMN. There were 10 deaths, 6 in Group I (bleed related, 1) and 4 in Group II (bleed related, 1); the actuarial probability of survival was comparable (P = 0.39). EVL and combination therapy are equally effective in the prevention of variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients. EVL is more effective than drug therapy in the prevention of rebleeds in patients with NCPH and, hence, recommended. However, in view of the small number of NCPH patients, further studies are needed before this can be stated conclusively.", 
    "80": "The objective of lowering the intraocular pressures remains the main-stay of therapy in the management of glaucoma, and may be achieved by medication, laser, or surgery. For many years the pharmacotherapy available, while quite effective, were few in number; principally timolol, pilocarpine, and oral acetazolamide. Through extensive research in glaucoma treatment, ophthalmologists now have access to a dozen different medications to treat glaucoma. This has invariably led to a decrease in the need for laser or surgery to control the intraocular pressures, and the number of glaucoma operations performed has progressively declined over the past few years. However, aviation medicine practitioners need to be aware of the potential adverse effects of these medications as some of these undesirable side effects may render the drugs unsuitable for aircrew.", 
    "81": "ANG II applied to the interstitial space influences carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in a tissue-specific fashion. Thus endogenous ANG II may have a tonic effect on tissue metabolism that could be reversed with ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade, particularly during adrenergic stimulation. We studied 14 obese men. They were treated for 10 days with the AT1 receptor blocker irbesartan or with placebo in a double-blind and crossover fashion. At the end of each treatment period, we assessed skeletal muscle and adipose tissue metabolism using the microdialysis technique. The ethanol dilution technique was applied to follow changes in tissue blood flow. Measurements were obtained at baseline and during application of incremental isoproterenol concentrations through the microdialysis catheter. Blood pressure decreased from 133 +/- 3/84 +/- 3 to 128 +/- 3/79 +/- 2 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood, respectively (P = 0.02 and 0.006, respectively) with AT1 receptor blockade. Isoproterenol perfusion caused a dose-dependent increase in dialysate glycerol in adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle. Irbesartan slightly reduced the isoproterenol-induced glycerol response in adipose tissue (P < 0.05 by ANOVA). Ethanol ratio, interstitial glucose supply, and lactate production in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were similar with placebo and irbesartan. We conclude that AT1 receptor blockade in obese men does not reveal a major tonic ANG II effect on interstitial glucose supply, lipolysis, or glycolysis in skeletal muscle, either at rest or during beta-adrenergic stimulation. Endogeneous ANG II may slightly increase adipose tissue lipolysis. The mechanism may promote the redistribution of triglycerides from adipose tissue toward other organs.", 
    "82": "Novel interpenetrating polymeric network microspheres of gellan gum and poly(vinyl alcohol) were prepared by the emulsion cross-linking method. Carvedilol, an antihypertensive drug, was successfully loaded into these microspheres prepared by changing the experimental variables such as ratio of gellan gum:poly(vinyl alcohol) and extent of cross-linking in order to optimize the process variables on drug encapsulation efficiency, release rates, size, and morphology of the microspheres. Formation of interpenetrating network and the chemical stability of carvedilol after preparing the microspheres was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry and x-ray diffraction studies were made on the drug-loaded microspheres to investigate the crystalline nature of the drug after encapsulation. Results indicated a crystalline dispersion of carvedilol in the polymer matrix. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the spherical nature and smooth surface morphology of the microspheres produced. Mean particle size of the microspheres as measured by laser light scattering technique ranged between 230 and 346 microm. Carvedilol was successfully encapsulated up to 87% in the polymeric matrices. In vitro release studies were performed in the simulated gastric fluid or simulated intestinal fluid. The release of carvedilol was continued up to 12 h. Dynamic swelling studies were performed in the simulated gastric fluid or simulated intestinal fluid, and diffusion coefficients were calculated by considering the spherical geometry of the matrices. The release data were fitted to an empirical relation to estimate the transport parameters. The mechanical properties of interpenetrating polymeric networks prepared were investigated. Network parameters such as molar mass between cross-links and cross-linking density for interpenetrating polymeric networks were calculated.",

    "95": "The epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) regulates Na(+) homeostasis in cells and across epithelia. Four homologous ENaC subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) have been isolated in mammals. Combination of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits or delta-, beta-, and gamma-subunits forms fully functional channels. Amiloride is a well known blocker of the ENaC family that inhibits both channel complexes. However, no specific antagonists are currently known that distinguish them. Here, we show that Evans blue, a diagnostic aid for the measurement of blood volume and vascular permeability, inhibits the activity of the delta-subunit expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The inward currents at a holding potential of -60 mV in human ENaCdeltabetagamma-expressing oocytes were inhibited by the application of Evans blue in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 143 muM. Evans blue markedly inhibited the delta-subunit current but did not block the alpha-subunit current. In conclusion, Evans blue is the first known delta-subunit-specific antagonist of ENaC. This finding provides us with a key compound for elucidating the physiological and pathological functions of ENaCdelta in humans and for drug development in the ENaC family.", 
    "96": "In this study, we have investigated the dependence of Na+ transport regulation on membrane cholesterol content in A6 renal epithelia. We continuously monitored short-circuit current (Isc), transepithelial conductance (GT), and transepithelial capacitance (CT) to evaluate the effects of cholesterol extraction from the apical and basolateral membranes in steady-state conditions and during activation with hyposmotic shock, oxytocin, and adenosine. Cholesterol extraction was achieved by perfusing the epithelia with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (mbetaCD) for 1 h. In steady-state conditions, apical membrane cholesterol extraction did not significantly affect the electrophysiological parameters; in contrast, marked reductions were observed during basolateral mbetaCD treatment. However, apical mbetaCD application hampered the responses of Isc and GT to hypotonicity, oxytocin, and adenosine. Analysis of the blocker-induced fluctuation in Isc demonstrated that apical mbetaCD treatment decreased the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) open probability (Po) in the steady state as well as after activation of Na+ transport by adenosine, whereas the density of conducting channels was not significantly changed as confirmed by CT measurements. Na+ transport activation by hypotonicity was abolished during basolateral mbetaCD treatment as a result of reduced Na+/K+ pump activity. On the basis of the findings in this study, we conclude that basolateral membrane cholesterol extraction reduces Na+/K+ pump activity, whereas the reduced cholesterol content of the apical membranes affects the activation of Na+ transport by reducing ENaC Po.",

Anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) from the right sinus of Valsalva (RSOV) represents a small fraction (1.3%) of these anomalies, with an overall prevalence of 0.017% to 0.03% in angiographic studies. The high incidence of sudden cardiac death associated with this specific anomaly during or immediately after vigorous physical exercise makes identification and appropriate surgical intervention critical. We present a case report of a 14-year-old patient with an LMCA arising from the RSOV with an initial intramural course, presenting with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as the first indication of the anomaly. Transthoracic echocardiogram suggested this anomaly, which was confirmed by cardiac catheterization and transesophageal echocardiogram.", 
    "99": "Earlier ideas that sympathetic nervous system activity is low in human obesity, contributing to weight gain through absence of sympathetically mediated thermogenesis, can now be discounted. The application of sympathetic nerve recording techniques and isotope dilution methodology quantifying neurotransmitter release from sympathetic nerves has established that the sympathetic outflows to the kidneys and skeletal muscle vasculature are activated in obese humans. The cause remains unclear. The adipocyte hormone, leptin, stimulates the sympathetic nervous system in rodents, but whether this applies in humans is uncertain. Cross-sectional studies suggest a quantitative link exists between regional sympathetic nervous tone (most notably in the kidneys) and rates of leptin release, but definitive studies documenting that leptin administration activates the human sympathetic nervous system have not been done. What might be the clinical implications of these new findings? The demonstration that the suppressed sympathetic tone characterizing many experimental models of obesity does not exist in human obesity weakens the case for the use of beta3-adrenergic agonists as thermogenic agents to facilitate weight loss. Although the neurogenic character of obesity-related hypertension is now established, whether antiadrenergic antihypertensive drugs are the preferred agents for blood pressure reduction has not been adequately tested. Multiple site central venous sampling, disclosing release of leptin into the internal jugular veins, led to the demonstration that the leptin gene is also expressed in the brain, in addition to adipocytes. Brain resistance to leptin has been inferred in human obesity, given that overweight is accompanied by high plasma leptin levels. The fact that the genes for leptin and its receptors are normally expressed in the brain in human obesity, and that release of leptin from the brain is actually increased, argues against this. Brain leptin release has the potential to override the peripheral, adipocyte leptin system.",

In the hospital discharge cohort, 73 patients (3% of the 2640 patients with ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and 1% of all 9096 patients with heart failure discharged alive) met trial eligibility criteria: LVEF< or =0.35, QRS > or =120 ms, sinus rhythm, and NYHA class III or IV symptoms despite the treatment with ACE-inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker and beta-blocker. In the specialty clinic cohort, 54 patients (21% of the 263 patients with ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and 17% of all 309 patients with heart failure) met these criteria. If persistent symptoms despite taking spironolactone were required for CRT eligibility, then the proportions qualifying dropped to 1% in the hospital discharge cohort and 18% in the specialty clinic cohort.",

    "103": "Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) interfere with the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in a different way. Theoretically, one might expect beneficial effects when they are used in combination, as a more complete suppression of the RAS can be achieved. But can this additional effect still be seen in patients on full-dose ACE-inhibition? Several controlled trials demonstrated that combination therapy can have additional benefits in hypertensive patients, in chronic heart failure patients, and in both diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy patients. However, the clinical benefit was not always as pronounced as expected and not every patient will benefit from dual blockade of the RAS. There is some evidence of a less pronounced effect of combination therapy when a full dose of the ACE-inhibitor is given. However, it is well known that ACE-inhibitors cannot completely suppress the formation of angiotensin II, in particular, when the RAS is activated. Indeed, clinical trials indicated that add-on therapy with an ARB was especially of use when the RAS remained activated despite full-dose ACE-inhibitor treatment. In summary, combination of a full-dose ACE-inhibitor and an ARB can be a rational choice in selected patients.",

Reasons for rate control include reduction of symptoms and the prevention of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy; yet, evidence-based definitions of optimal rate control are lacking. This article examines an approach to rate control that includes serial assessment of heart rate and symptoms, both at rest and with exertion, and the use of therapy tailored to the individual and modified over time (as no single therapy demonstrates clear superiority). Often, multidrug regimens including digoxin and a calcium channel blocker or beta-blocker are required, and in a minority of patients atrioventricular nodal ablation and pacing are necessary.

    "115": "Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is the main component of senile plaques which characterize Alzheimer's disease and may induce neuronal death through mechanisms which include oxidative stress. To date, the signalling pathways linking oxidant stress, a component of several neurodegenerative diseases, to cell death in the CNS are poorly understood. Melastatin-like transient receptor potential 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca(2+)-permeant non-selective cation channel, which responds to increases in oxidative stress levels in the cell and is activated by oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. We demonstrate here that Abeta and hydrogen peroxide both induce death in cultured rat striatal cells which express TRPM2 endogenously. Transfection with a splice variant that acts as a dominant negative blocker of TRPM2 function (TRPM2-S) inhibited both hydrogen peroxide- and Abeta-induced increases in intracellular-free Ca(2+) and cell death. Functional inhibition of TRPM2 activation by the poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase inhibitor SB-750139, a modulator of intracellular pathways activating TRPM2, attenuated hydrogen peroxide- and Abeta-induced cell death. Furthermore, a small interfering RNA which targets TRPM2, reduced TRPM2 mRNA levels and the toxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide and Abeta. These data demonstrate that activation of TRPM2, functionally expressed in primary cultures of rat striatum, contributes to Abeta- and oxidative stress-induced striatal cell death.",

A total of 1535 patients (mean age: 64 years, 79% men), 321 after coronary surgery and 1214 after percutaneous coronary intervention, were included. Of them 37% still described anginal symptoms (Canadian class 1 in 80% of them); 38% still had elevated blood pressure (> or = 140 mm HG systolic and/or > or = 90 mmHg diastolic) and 27% of previous smokers still smoked after the procedure. All classes of secondary prevention medications were more often prescribed after than before intervention, antiplatelet agents (63.5 to 89%), beta-blockers (53 to 73.5%), statins (51 to 3%), ACE inhibitors (27 to 39%) and nicorandil (14 to 21%). Factors associated with the prescription of the different classes of medications were both expected (such as hypertension for ACE inhibitors or statins in hyperlipidemic patients) or unsupported by scientific evidence (less beta-blockers in diabetic patients). Overall this survey shows that myocardial revascularisation constitutes a key point in the management of patients with coronary disease, and that cardiologists consider that treatment of the atherosclerotic process is as important as the treatment of focal coronary artery stenoses.",

    "118": "Propranolol-HCl-loaded calcium alginate (ALG) beads, propranolol-resin complex (resinate)-loaded calcium alginate (RALG) beads and polyethyleneimine (PEI)-treated RALG (RALG-PEI) beads were prepared by ionotropic gelation/polyelectrolyte complexation method. The beads were evaluated and compared in respect of drug entrapment efficiency (DEE) and release characteristics in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, 0.1(N) HCl, pH 1.2) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, phosphate buffer, pH 6.8). DEE of RALG beads was considerably higher than that of ALG beads containing unresinated drug. However, DEE of RALG beads decreased with increase in both gelation time and concentration of the gel forming Ca2+ ions due to drug displacement from resinate. PEI treatment of RALG beads further decreased DEE as the polycation also displaced the drug from the resinate. The release of drug from all the beads was slow and incomplete in SGF owing to considerably less swelling of the beads and the decrease in drug release from the beads followed the order: RALG-PEI<RALG<ALG. In contrast to rapid discharge of the drug by ALG beads in SIF, RALG beads provided marginal prolongation in drug release as both ALG and RALG beads swelled and eroded rapidly although at different rates. On the other hand, drug release from RALG-PEI beads in SIF was considerably prolonged for different periods of time depending upon the conditions of PEI treatment. Interaction of the polycation with alginate resulted in the formation of polyelectrolyte complex membrane as evident from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies. The membrane having reduced swelling and erosion properties behaved as a physical barrier to drug release. Kinetics of the drug release also confirmed the formation of physical barrier as anomalous transport type of release associated with.

    "122": "Several studies have suggested that increased cell levels of cAMP result in decreased rates of collagen synthesis. Oestrogen treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) has been shown to cause increased levels of cAMP and decreased rates of collagen synthesis. Beta-adrenergic agonists are also known to increase cellular levels of cAMP in VSMCs, although the effect of beta-adrenergic agonists on collagen synthetic rates in VSMCs is unknown. Since beta-agonists and oestrogens are commonly used clinical agents these studies were conducted to determine the potential of these agents to have an additive effect on cell cAMP levels and inhibition of collagen synthetic rates. When VSMCs were treated with both oestrogen and isoproterenol there was an additive effect on cellular cAMP levels although the observed decrease in collagen synthetic rates was the same as observed in cells treated with just oestrogen. Treatment of VSMCs with propranolol inhibited isoproterenol-induced changes in cAMP but had no effect on either oestrogen-induced increases in cAMP levels or inhibition of collagen synthesis. The cellular location of cAMP following beta-adrenergic agonist treatment was different from the distribution of cAMP in control or oestrogen-treated VSMCs. This difference in cellular distribution of cAMP may partially explain the absence of collagen synthesis inhibition following beta-adrenergic agonist treatment of VSMCs.",

During a mean period of 4.43 years' follow-up, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and Killip's status > or =II were more frequent among patients with subsequent cardiac events (all P-values <0.05). The frequency of 5A allele of stromelysin-1 gene was significantly higher among event group (P = 0.01). Smoking cessation after MI, use of beta-blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) could improve outcome (all P-values <0.05). After multivariate analysis, we found that DM was an independent risk factor for survival [Hazard ratio (HR) 2.45, P = 0.01]. Successful smoking cessation and therapy with ACEI could have a protective effect (HR 0.33 and 0.09, P = 0.01 and <0.01, respectively). The stromelysin-1 5A gene polymorphism was also an independent survival predictor (HR 2.51, P = 0.03).

    "127": "The mechanisms underlying the blunted contractile response to beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulation in heart failure (HF) are incompletely understood, especially with regard to beta-AR subtype-specific regulation of L-type Ca2+ channels. We evaluated the impact of HF induced by pacing tachycardia on beta-AR regulation of L-type Ca2+ channels in a canine model. To evaluate changes in the relative subcellular distribution of beta-AR subtypes, left ventricular membranes enriched in surface sarcolemma and T-tubular sarcolemma were prepared. Radioligand binding using [(125)I]cyanopindolol revealed that HF resulted in a comparable decrease in the density of beta1-ARs in both surface and T-tubule sarcolemma (55+/-4%, n=7, P<0.001; and 45+/-10%, n=7, P<0.01, respectively), but no significant change in beta2-AR density was observed. Whole-cell patch clamp studies demonstrated a markedly blunted increase in I(Ca,L) in response to saturating concentrations of the nonselective beta-AR agonist isoproterenol (0.1 micromol/L) in failing myocytes compared with control (129+/-20%, n=11, versus 332+/-35%, n=7; P<0.001). Experiments testing beta1-AR- and beta2-AR-selective stimulation showed that the major component of the blunted response to nonselective beta-AR stimulation in HF was caused by beta2-AR activation, resulting in a pertussis toxin-sensitive, Gi-mediated inhibition of the beta1-AR-induced increase in I(Ca,L). In conclusion, canine HF results in the following: (1) a uniform reduction in beta1-AR density in surface and T-tubule membrane fractions without a change in beta2-AR density; and (2) the emergence of distinct Gi-coupling to beta2-ARs resulting in accentuated antagonism of beta1-AR-mediated stimulation of I(Ca,L). These results have implications for optimizing the use of beta-AR drugs in HF.", 
    "128": "Protein kinase C (PKC) is able to phosphorylate several cellular components that serve as key regulatory components in signal transduction pathways of nociceptor excitation and sensitisation. Therefore, the present study attempted to assess some of the mechanisms involved in the overt nociception elicited by peripheral administration of the PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), in mice. The intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of PMA (16-1600 pmol/paw), but not its inactive analogue alpha-PMA, produced a long-lasting overt nociception (up to 45 min), as well as the activation of PKCalpha and PKCepsilon isoforms in treated paws. Indeed, the local administration of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X completely blocked PMA-induced nociception. The blockade of NK1, CGRP, NMDA, beta1-adrenergic, B2 or TRPV1 receptors with selective antagonists partially decreased PMA-induced nociception. Similarly, COX-1, COX-2, MEK or p38 MAP kinase inhibitors reduced the nociceptive effect produced by PMA. Notably, the nociceptive effect promoted by PMA was diminished in animals treated with an antagonist of IL-1beta receptor or with antibodies against TNFalpha, NGF or BDNF, but not against GDNF. Finally, mast cells as well as capsaicin-sensitive and sympathetic fibres, but not neutrophil influx, mediated the nociceptive effect produced by PMA. Collectively, the results of the present study have shown that PMA injection into the mouse paw results in PKC activation as well as a relatively delayed, but long-lasting, overt nociceptive behaviour in mice. Moreover, these results demonstrate that PKC activation exerts a critical role in modulating the excitability of sensory neurons.", 
    "129": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic progressive disease that results in microvascular and macrovascular complications. Diabetes is a significant independent risk factor for heart failure, and there are a substantial number of patients with diabetes and heart failure. Neurohormonal activation plays an important pathophysiologic role in insulin resistance, diabetes, cardiovascular events, and progression of heart failure. Pharmacologic intervention in these neurohormonal systems (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibition, aldosterone antagonism, and beta-adrenergic blockade) has been shown to decrease the morbidity and mortality of diabetes and of heart failure. Despite this knowledge, ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and beta-blockers are grossly underutilized, and deaths and hospitalizations due to heart failure have steadily increased. Guidelines for the management of heart failure recommend the use of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in patients with mild, moderate, and severe heart failure with or without diabetes. Aldosterone antagonists are recommended in severe heart failure and recent data also support their use in mild to moderate heart failure. Concerns about increased incidence of hypoglycemia, worsening dyslipidemia, and decreased insulin sensitivity with beta-blockers may be preventing physicians from prescribing these agents for their patients with diabetes who have heart failure.

In patients with NSTEMI/UA, beta-blockers, nitrates and calcium antagonists will improve chest pain, and invasive management of ACS is indicated in < 48 h, if risk factors are present. In patients without risk factors, stress studies and conservative treatment are mandatory. In patients with STEMI, nitrates, aspirin, heparin, and beta-blockers are required, and therapy of first choice is reperfusion with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Acute ascending aortic dissection has a poor prognosis with mortality rates of 60% within 24 h, 75% within 1 week, and 90% within 3 months. Immediate surgical management of acute type A aortic dissection is necessary, whereas conservative treatment is preferred in acute type B aortic dissection. Both types require adequate therapy of hypertension. Acute pericarditis is caused by several factors; cardiac tamponade with pericarditis or pericardial effusion is associated with circulatory compromise and may be life-threatening. Acute pericarditis generally takes a benign course after empirical treatment with nonsteroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Immediate percutaneous pericardiocentesis is required, if cardiac tamponade is present.",

Some of them, as differences in repolarization between males and females have been explained by direct effect of estrogen on delayed rectifier K+ channels and Ca2+ channels.

On the other hand, all three PCOs induced similar negative chronotropic action in hearts obtained from male control group (Emax was between -40 and -70 bpm, respectively). After two weeks of treatment with 17-beta-estradiol, pinacidil failed to significantly decrease heart rate in males however, tamoxifen-pretreated female group responded by decrease in automatism in the presence of rising concentration of pinacidil (Emax=-45+/-6 bpm, not significantly different from Emax in male control=-40+/-5 bpm, n=7). Interestingly, we observed lower blood concentration of the heart form of lactate dehydrogenase (H-LDH) in female than in male control group. Moreover, H-LDH concentration increased in tamoxifen-pretreated female group and decreased in 17-beta-estradiol-treated male group.",

    "150": "Floating matrix tablets of atenolol were developed to prolong gastric residence time and increase drug bioavailability. Atenolol was chosen as a model drug because it is poorly absorbed from the lower gastrointestinal tract. The tablets were prepared by direct compression technique, using polymers such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K15M, K4M), guargum (GG), and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (SCMC), alone or in combination, and other standard excipients. Tablets were evaluated for physical characteristics viz. hardness, swelling index, floating capacity, thickness, and weight variation. Further, tablets were evaluated for in vitro release characteristics for 8 hr. The effect of effervescent on buoyancy and drug release pattern was also studied. In vitro release mechanism was evaluated by linear regression analysis. GG- and SCMC-based matrix tablets showed significantly greater swelling indices compared with other batches. The tablets exhibited controlled and prolonged drug release profiles while floating over the dissolution medium.", 
    "151": "Modifications in chylomicron metabolism caused by antihypertensive drugs were investigated in hypertensive subjects because previous studies had indicated that diuretics and beta-blockers modify the plasma lipid concentrations through mechanisms that were not fully understood. A triglyceride-rich emulsion resembling lymph chylomicrons, labeled with (3H) triolein and (14C) cholesteryl oleate, was infused intravenously into mildly hypertensive patients after 8 weeks on placebo and subsequently on hydrochlorothiazide (n = 10) or propranolol (n = 8). The residence time of both radioactivities in plasma was utilized for the simultaneous calculation of the particle remnant removal rate and of the lipoprotein lipase activity expressed as a delipidation index = 1 - [(3H) triolein residence time/(14C) cholesteryl oleate residence time]. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide diminished the delipidation rate value whereas propranolol mildly increased the removal rate of the remnant particle. These alterations of the chylomicron kinetics were not accompanied by changes in plasma triglycerides, glucose, and insulin concentration as measured in the fasting state. The impairment of the lipoprotein lipase activity by thiazides and the faster removal rate of the whole particle by propranolol could explain the reason why in previous clinical studies the simultaneous use of these drugs does not aggravate the hyperlipidemia known to be induced by thiazides alone.", 
    "152": "Effective blood pressure lowering is essential for prevention of complications of arterial hypertension. Most current guidelines indicate diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers as main antihypertensive drugs. Genetic polymorphisms underlie pathophysiology of diseases and can affect efficacy of therapy. Method of investigation of pharmacogenetic interrelationships is based on analysis of genes encoding enzymes responsible for metabolism and transport of drugs as well as genes encoding main targets of drug action (receptors). Those polymorphic genes that encode elements of the system of metabolism, adsorption, transport, elimination of drugs, and main receptor systems are considered to be main gene-candidates for pharmacogenetic studies. Some drugs have well known genotypes determining efficacy of therapy as for instance alpha-adducin gene for diuretics. Data on other classes of drugs (e.g. calcium channel blockers) are scanty. Existing information on pharmacogenetic properties of antihypertensive drugs is presented in this review.",

Preliminary human studies are underway, yet no studies have demonstrated efficacy in combination with standard medical therapy, i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers. Nude rats underwent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation to induce MI. Animals were randomised to receive no treatment (MI, n = 5), quinapril 200 mg/L + metoprolol 2 g/L (ACE/BB, n = 5), two million EPCs intravenously (EPC, n = 5)or both (ACE/BB + EPC [n = 5]), then sacrificed after two weeks treatment. ACE/BB resulted in a 75% reduction in fibrosis in the region remote from the MI (p < 0.05), but EPC therapy had little effect here. Conversely, EPC therapy induced neovascularisation at the peri-infarct rim, thereby preventing peri-infarct apoptosis by 81% (p < 0.05). Acting via different but complementary mechanisms, the combination of ACE/BB + EPCs resulted in a greater overall improvement in LV function on echocardiography than either therapy alone. Clinical trials using stem cell therapy in conjunction with standard medical treatment are warranted.", 
    "160": "Calcium channel and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists are common pharmaceutical agents with multiple overlapping clinical indications. When used appropriately, these agents are safe and efficacious. In overdose, however, these agents have the potential for serious morbidity. Calcium channel blockers and beta blockers share similar physiological effects on the cardiovascular system, such as hypotension and bradycardia, in overdose and occasionally at therapeutic doses. The initial management for symptomatic overdose of both drug classes consists of supportive care measures. Other therapies including administration of glucagon, calcium, catecholamines, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and insulin have been used with varying degrees of success. In addition, intra-aortic balloon pump and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation techniques have been successfully utilized in refractory cases. This article reviews beta blocker and calcium channel blocker pharmacological principles and updates current management strategies.", 
    "161": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors interfere with several key events of vascular inflammation resulting in impressive reductions in coronary vascular events. However, in human arteries ACE inhibitors block the production of angiotensin II (AngII) incompletely because of the involvement of alternative pathways in local AngII formation. Therefore, our study concentrated on the presumed modulation by ACE inhibition of local AngII-mediated inflammatory actions by a mechanism independent of blockage of AngII formation. We analyzed the effect of the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat on AngII-dependent cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expression and adhesion of monocytic THP-1 cells to endothelial cells. AngII induced upregulation of P-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on endothelial cells via activation of AT 1, which was correlated with enhanced THP-1 adhesion in flow chamber assays. Both enhanced adhesion and adhesion molecule expression were significantly reduced by pretreatment with ramiprilat. Ramiprilat reduced AT 1 expression on endothelial cells and decreased the AngII-induced p65 translocation into the nucleus. Diminished AT 1 expression and adhesion molecule expression in response to ramiprilat treatment were partially reversed after incubation with a bradykinin 2 receptor antagonist, suggesting that elevated bradykinin levels under ACE inhibition may be involved in the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors. Thus, modulation of the local AngII system by ramiprilat may at least in part contribute to the benefits of ACE inhibition in the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases.", 
    "162": "We have documented a pre-junctional beta-2 adrenoceptor mediated reduction in cardiac norepinephrine spillover (CNES) in heart failure patients receiving chronic beta-blockade. Our present objective was to ascertain the consequence of this decrease for vagal heart rate (HR) regulation by determining CNES, arterial baroreflex sensitivity for HR (BRS) and arterial baroreflex modulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) before and upon 4 months of beta-blockade with either carvedilol or metoprolol. In 19 heart failure patients in sinus rhythm (age: 55+/-2 [mean+/-S.E.]; ejection fraction: 20+/-2%), beta-blockade increased BRS from 4.8+/-0.9 to 7.9+/-1.3 ms/mm Hg (P<0.005) but had no effect on arterial baroreflex modulation of MSNA. Changes in CNES and BRS were inversely related (r=-0.52; n=16, P<0.05). Chronic beta-blockade in heart failure augments reflex vagal control of HR at an efferent site of interaction involving blockade of cardiac sympathetic pre-junctional beta-2 adrenoceptors that facilitate NE release.", 
    "163": "Surveys of prescribing patterns in both hospitals and primary care have usually shown delays in translating the evidence from clinical trials of pharmacological agents into clinical practice, thereby denying patients with heart failure (HF) the benefits of drug treatments proven to improve well-being and prolong life. This may be due to unfamiliarity with the evidence-base for these therapies, the clinical guidelines recommending the use of these treatments or both, as well as concerns regarding adverse events. ACE inhibitors have long been the cornerstone of therapy for systolic HF irrespective of aetiology. Recent trials have now shown that treatment with beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and angiotensin receptor blockers also leads to substantial improvements in outcome. In order to accelerate the safe uptake of these treatments and to ensure that all eligible patients receive the most appropriate medications, a clear and concise set of clinical recommendations has been prepared by a group of clinicians with practical expertise in the management of HF. The objective of these recommendations is to provide practical guidance for non-specialists, in order to increase the use of evidenced based therapy for HF.

The fixed combination of travoprost/timolol significantly lowered IOP by 7 to 9 mm, similar to the IOP reductions observed with concomitant therapy.

    "169": "Cardiac adverse events are a major cause of complications in noncardiac surgery. The benefit of preventive coronary artery revascularisation in stable patients before noncardiac surgery has recently been clarified: in the short-term there is no reduction in the number of postoperative myocardial infarction, deaths or hospital length of stay. Coronary artery revascularisation should be limited to these patients who have a well-defined need for the procedure, independent of the need of noncardiac surgery. Optimising medical therapy remains the best option for reducing perioperative complications in stable patients: the addition of statin therapy in candidates for noncardiac surgery with known or strongly suspected coronary disease may be conceived. There is compelling evidence for the use of beta-blockers in reducing cardiac risk. This review presents the studies that support the beneficial effect of beta-blockers, pharmacological effects and some practical aspects in noncardiac surgery. In the management of most of these patients, the use of beta-blockers can aid in the avoidance of a preoperative stress test. The remaining problem to solve is the cost-effective identification of the small group of patients in which the protective effect of beta-blocker therapy is insufficient and a cardiac revascularisation should be considered.", 
    "170": "The recommended dose for endotracheal adrenaline (0.02 mg/kg) causes a pronounced initial decrease in diastolic blood pressure which is detrimental at the initial phase of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This effect was previously attributed to an early and preferential stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptors causing vasodilatation unopposed by an alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that inhibition of the beta2-adrenoreceptors is responsible for prevention of the deleterious initial decrease in blood pressure that takes place following endotracheal administration of adrenaline.",

IL-1beta was administered subcutaneously daily to timed-pregnant guinea pigs for 3 days with and without simultaneous cortisol synthesis inhibition by metyrapone. At day 3, oxytocin was administered, and fetuses were delivered by abdominal hysterotomy at 61 and by oxytocin-induced birth at 68 days gestation. Delivered fetuses were instilled with isosmolar 5% albumin into the lungs, and lung fluid movement was measured over 1 h by mass balance. Lung fluid absorption was induced in 61-day and stimulated in 68-day gestation lungs by IL-1beta. Labor induction by oxytocin augmented IL-1beta-induced/-stimulated lung fluid absorption. Metyrapone pretreatment did not affect oxytocin-induced/-stimulated lung fluid absorption, while completely blocking IL-1beta-induced/-stimulated fluid absorption. Fetal lung fluid absorption, when present, was always propranolol and amiloride sensitive, suggesting that beta-adrenoceptor stimulation and amiloride-sensitive sodium channels were critical for fluid absorption. Epithelial sodium channel and Na-K-ATPase subunit expressions were both increased by IL-1beta, but not further by oxytocin. Our results indicate that IL-1beta release into the maternal blood circulation positively affects lung maturation due to the IL-1beta-induced release of cortisol and thus prepares the lungs for the epinephrine surge associated with labor.",
