    "0": "1. The role of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in the relaxation produced by isoprenaline in muscle strips from the oestrogen dominated rabbit uterus has been investigated. 2. Isoprenaline 2 times 10- minus 8 M produced an inhibition of the mechanical activity but no increase in cyclic AMP. Isoprenaline 2 times 10- minus 6 M produced both inhibition of mechanical activity and increase in cyclic AMP. 3. The increase in cyclic AMP, but not the inhibition of mechanical activity, was blocked by propranolol 3.4 X 10-MINUS 6 M. 4. Dibutyryl-ccylic AMP produced a relaxation which mimicked that produced by isoprenaline, in that the longitudinal strips were more sensitive than the circular ones. 5. It is concluded that cyclic AMP may be a mediator of the beta-adrenergic effect in the oestrogen dominated rabbit myometrium. However, it seems not to be an obligatory link between stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors and relaxation. Other mechanisms may also exist.", 
    "1": "The effect of 1-norepinephrine on cyclic nucleotide levels was studied in rat ductus deferens. Norepinephrine (0.01-0.3 mM) increased cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Cyclic GMP was increased by about two-fold and cyclic AMP by 30%-40% by 0.1 mM norepinephrine after 3 min. Phenylephrine (0.1 mM) increased cyclic GMP levels about twofold without affecting cyclic AMP. Cyclic GMP was maximally increased by norepinephrine or phenylephrine after 3-10 min, but was not significantly changed after 20 sec, when contraction was fully developed. Atropine did not affect the norepinephrine-induced changes in cyclic nucleotide levels; phentolamine blocked the effect of norepinephrine on cyclic GMP, and propanolol blocked that on cyclic AMP. These findings indicate that in the ductus deferens alpha-adrenergic receptors are involved in the effect of catecholamines on cyclic GMP, and beta-adrenergic receptors are involved in the effect on cyclic AMP levels. The presence of Ca-2+ was required for the effect of norepinephrine on cyclic GMP, but not on cyclic AMP.", 
    "2": "The divalent cation ionophore A-23187 caused a Ca-2+-dependent increase in alpha-amylase release from slices of rat parotid gland. The effect of A-23187 on alpha-amylase release was not caused by release of endogenous agonists since l-propranolol, phentolamine, and atropine had no effect. The magnitude of alpha-amylase release caused by A-23187 was small compared to the effect of isoproterenol. In this respect it more closely resembles the action of cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic agonists on alpha-amylase release. A-23187 inhibited the increase in the level of parotid adenosine 3,5'-monophosphate caused by isoprotrenol. The inhibitory effect required incubation of the slices with the ionophore before the addition of isoproterenol. The ionophore also caused a Ca-2+-dependent increase in the level of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP). Theophylline enhanced the effect of A-23187 on the level of cyclic GMP. These results emphasize the role of Ca-2+ in the regulation of parotid cyclic nucleotide levels. Since the effects of the ionophore depended on the presence of Ca-2+, it is possible that some of the effects of agonists on parotid gland physiology are secondary to an action on intracellular Ca-2+ distribution.", 
    "3": "Gluconeogenesis from lactate, pyruvate, fructose, alanine, and other substrates was accelerated by glucagon or epinephrine in hepatocytes isolated from rat liver. Glucagon and epinephrine also increased cyclic AMP accumulation by rat hepatocytes. Isoproterenol increased cyclic AMP but not gluconeogenesis, while phenylephrine accelerated gluconeogenesis. The activation of gluconeogenesis by epinephrine was unaffected by propranolol but blocked by dihydroergotamine. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP added to hepatocytes stimulated gluconeogenesis at concentrations as low as 1 muM. Exogenous cyclic GMP (0.1- muM) inhibited gluconeogenesis due to either glucagon or epinephrine without affecting basal gluconeogenesis. However, carbamylcholine did not affect gluconeogenesis by hepatocytes. Basal gluconeogenesis and the increases due to all agents were inhibited by removal of extracellular calcium or the presence of A-23187, D-600, or tetracaine. In contrast, added 0.1 muM cyclic GMP, 2 mM NH-4-Cl, and 10 muM phenethylbiguanide inhibited glucagon- or epinephrine-stimulated gluconeogenesis without affecting basal values. Studies with hepatocytes indicate that the hormonal activation of gluconeogenesis is not limited to substrates entering prior to triose phosphate formation. Glucagon may act by increasing cyclic AMP which acts via unknown mechanisms to increase gluconeogenesis. In contrast, epinephrine acts via a cyclic AMP-independent mechamism which does not appear to involve cyclic GMP, Ca-2+ flux, of K+ flux.", 
    "4": "Cultured human epidermoid carcinoma (HEp-2) cells were found to contain a highly responsive, catecholamine-sensitive adenyl cyclase activity in cellfree preparations. By contrast, cyclic AMP levels in intact HEp-2 cells were at best only marginally increased by catecholamines under a variety of conditions. The lack of an intact cell response could not be accounted for by escape of cyclic AMP to the medium, excessive phosphodiesterase activity, inactivation of the catecholamine, or by unusual kinetics of the system. However, in the presence of 1-methyl,3-iso-butylxanthine (MIX), a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor, a moderate catecholamine response was observed in the intact cells. A significant elevation of cyclic AMP levels in the presence of MIX was observed at 0.3 muM epinephrine, and maximal levels occurred at 10 muM. Norepinephrine was much less effective than either epinephrine or isopropylnorepinephrine at 10 muM concentrations. In addition, intact cells slowly but steadily released cyclic AMP into the incubation medium over the course of 60-min incubations in the presence of MIX and epinephrine; maximum intracellular levels were reached by 5 min.", 
    "5": "The characteristics of the effects of catecholamines, prostaglandins, and adenosine on the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) content of human astrocytoma cells are described. Catecholamines interact with a typical beta-adrenergic receptor, i.e., the order of potency of catecholamines is isoproterenol larger than or equal to epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than dopamine, and propranolol is an inhibitor but phentolamine is not. The prostaglandins interact with a receptor that recognized PGE-1, PGE-2, and PGA-1 but not PGF-2-alpha. The effects of PGE-1 are blocked by 7-oxa-13-prostynoic acid, indomethacin, and meclofenamic acid in a rapid, reversible manner. The cells contain another adenylate cyclase-linked receptor that recognizes adenosine and the adenine nucleotides but not guanosine, deoxyadenosine, or adenine. Theophylline and other methylxanthines are competitive inhibitors of the effect of adenosine. Each class of effector appears to stimulate adenylate cyclase by interacting with a structure-specific receptor. This follows from the observation that the effect of each class of agonists can be blocked selectively by the various inhibitors and is consistant with the observation that co-addition of different agonists results in additive effects on accumulation of cAMP. The magnitude of the effect of any of the classes of agonists can be influenced by a variety of factors, some of which may be related to the peculiarities of growth in culture: (1) The cells secrete cAMP into the medium, and the magnitude of this secretion for a given rise in intracellular cAMP is different for different agonists. (2) The exposure of the cells to catecholamines or prostaglandins leads to a loss of responsiveness to a subsequent challenge by the same agonist. The magnitude of the agonist-induced loss of responsiveness is dependent on the concentration of the agonist and the time of exposure. The process is at least partially agonist specific in that exposure of cells to isoproterenol can lead to greater than 90% loss in catecholamine responsiveness with less than 20% loss in responsiveness to prostaglandins. (3) The responsiveness of the cells also changes as a function of the age of the culture and as a function of cell density. (4) Finally, it can be demonstrated that cells maintained in culture for prolonged periods (months to years) may lose responsiveness to specific agonists while responsiveness to other agonists remains unchanges or actually increases. The advantages and disadvantages of the use of cells in culture for studies of the regulation of cAMP metabolism are discussed.", 
    "6": "Chronic administration of ethanol to rats, either in liquid diets as the only source of food or by gastric intubation while the animals are fed ad libitum, leads to the development of a hypermetabolic state of the liver. This hypermetabolic condition of the liver can be observed independently of the feeding state of the animals. The calorigenic effects produced by ethanol in the liver, as measured in liver slices, could be reproduced by a single large dose of epinephrine. Oxygen consumption by liver slices of animals given a 2-mg/kg dose of epinephrine bitartrate increased by 40 to 50 percent. In these livers all the extra oxygen consumption, but not the basal respiration, could be abolished by ouabain, an inhibitor of the sodium pump. Dinitrophenol did not affect the respiratory rate in the liver of epinephrine-treated animals while markedly increasing that in controls. In the liver of treated animals, the activatory effect of dinitrophenol could be recovered in the presence of ouabain. The calorigenic effect of epinephrine in the liver was found to be completely abolished by phentolamine (alpha adrenergic blocker) but was not modified by DL-propranolol (beta adrenergic blocker). Also, the calorigenic effects produced by epinephrine could not be seen in thyroidectomized animals or by incubating the liver slices in a calcium-free medium. Thyroidectomy and administration of phentolamine markedly reduced and adrenalectomy completely abolished the hypermetabolic state produced in the liver of rats by chronic administration of ethanol.", 
    "7": "The blood flow through the anterior wall of the left ventricle has been studied during electrical stimulation of the left stellate ganglion of anesthetized dogs. The flow was continuously monitored by heated cross-thermocuple. Ganglion stimulation caused a significant increase in the flow through the outer half while producing relative ischemia of the inner half of the wall. Pretreatment with propranolol reduced regional difference of flow changes. Significantly augmented non-uniform flow changes, however, were produced by ganglion stimulation during hypertension caused by aortic constriction or by methoxamine. The results indicate non-uniform blood flow distribution which can be produced by sympathetic nerve excitation.", 
    "8": "In acute experiments staged on dogs subject to investigation was collateral coronary circulation studied by registering the retrograde blood flow and the pressure in the ligated coronary artery. It is shown that atropinization (0.05 mg/kg) does not change the positive action of papaverine and diethyphen (2 mg/kg) on the inflow of blood into the area of myocardial ischemia and enhances the beneficial effect on euphylline (4 mg/kg). Preliminary introduction of octadine (5 mg/kg) had no material influence on the nature of the diethyphen action, but greatly weakened that of euphylline and reduced the effect of papaverine. The vasodilating agents attenuated for a short while a pituitrin-induced (0.5 U/kg) spasm of the collaterals and vessels in the ischemic area of the myocardium.", 
    "9": "A comparative study was carried out of passive sensitization of the lungs, bronchi, small and large intestine by the blood sera of patients sensitive to ambrosia pollen. Passive sensitization and subsequent anaphylactic contraction were reproduced on the isolated bronchi, lungs and the ileum. Development of this reaction was less constant in the large intestine, jejunum and the appendix. The value of anaphylactic reaction of human smooth muscle displayed significant changes with the treatment of the muscles by agents selectively acting on the beta-adrenergic receptors of these organs.", 
    "10": "Bencyclan (Fludilat), used therapeutically as a vasodilator drug, exerts a distinct negative inotropic and chronotropic action on myocardium, in contrast to papaverine. It prolongs the functional refractory period in the isolated heart preparation. In isolated myocardial mitochondria it decreases the velocity of oxidative phosphorylation and the rate of calcium uptake. These results indicate that heart function should be checked if bencyclan is applied at high dosage, especially if other cardio-depressive substances such as narcotics, antidepressive and antiarrhythmic agents as well as beta-adrenergic blockers are used at the same time. On the other hand, the results suggest that bencyclan should be tested for possible use in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease as well as ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia.", 
    "11": "Information on the incidence of adverse drug reactions is essential for rational drug therapy. Accurate information of this type is almost entirely derived from intensive surveillance of hospital patients and may not reflect the situation in general practice. In a sutdy of oxprenolol (Trasicor) in the treatment of angina in general practice, a simple non-comparative assessment of efficacy indicated complete or substantial relief of symptoms in nearly 80 percent of patients. Side effects, which were principally related to beta-blockade and were all reversible, occured in 16.6 percent of patients but necessitated stopping treatment in only 10 percent. Simple studies of this nature may yeild valuable evicence about the benefit-to-risk ratio of drugs used under general practice conditions.", 
    "12": "Isoproterenol stimulates cellular accumulation of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and produces a 2- to 4-fold increase in bidirectional potassium fluxes in turkey erythrocytes. Ouabain, which does not alter catecholamine-stimulated cellular cyclic AMP, inhibits potassium influx by 50 to 70%, does not alter potassium outflux or isoproterenol-stimulated potassium influx, but increases isoproterenol-stimulated potassium outflux. Stimulation of potassium transport by isoproterenol can be reproduced by adding cyclic AMP to the medium and is inhibited by propranolol or dichloroisoproterenol but not by phentolamine. Theophylline at concentrations which inhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in isolated turkey erythrocyte plasma membranes by greater than 90%, does not augment isoproterenol stimulation of cellular cyclic AMP or of potassium transport but does potentiate stimulation of potassium influx produced by adding cyclic AMP to the medium. Isoproterenol-stimulated cellular cyclic AMP increases steadily for at least 2 hours. Potassium transport, however, increases rapidly, becomes maximal after 20 to 30 min of incubation, and thereafter decreases progressively so that after 2 hours of incubation potassium fluxes are only slightly greater than for the control. Ouabain prolongs the duration of catecholamine-stimulated potassium influx and potassium outflux, reflecting its ability to relieve the refractoriness developed by turkey erythroyctes to endogenous cyclic AMP.", 
    "13": "The role of Ca2+ on insulin release has been studied by the use of ionophore A23187. The ionophore complexes divalent cations and permits Ca2+ entry into cells by acting as a carrier in the plasma membranes. Cultured cells obtained by enzymatic digestion of pancreases from newborn rats were studied on the 3rd day of culture. With Ca2+ in the incubation medium the ionophore induced sustained insulin release even in the absence of glucose. Optimal effects of the ionophore were observed at 3 and 10 mug per ml in the presence of 0.3 to 1.0 mM Ca-2+. Under these conditions the insulin release was greater than that caused by 16.7 mM glucose. A graded response was observed to changes in Ca-2+ concentration from 0.1 to 1.0 mM Ca-2+. Higher Ca-2+ concentrations caused a large amount of insulin to be released promptly, but the release was not sustained. Mg-2+ and Sr-2+ were not found to substitute for Ca-2+. Ba-2+ at 0.3 mM stimulated insulin release even in the absence of ionophore. Cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate was able to increase ionophore-induced insulin release. The alpha-adrenergic effect of epinephrine to inhibit insulin release was not observed in the presence of Ca-2+ and the ionophore, and a stimulatory effect of epinephrine was seen. This unusual stimulatory effect of epinephrine was blocked by propranolol indicating a beta-adrenergic mechanism for epinephrine. It is concluded that Ca-2+, which plays an essential role in the stimulus-secretion coupling, can alone initiate and cause sustained insulin release.", 
    "14": "A number of pathogenetic moments have been identified in primary or essential hypertension in recent years. Marked variations have been noted in plasma volume, cardiac output, neurosympathetic tone, the renin-angiotensin system, and the aldosterone-adrenal neurosympathetic regulation system. Biological and clinical studies have underscored the action of the individual hypotensive drugs at present available commercially and their synergic or, in some instances, antagonist effects when associated. The fact that the disease has different stages and that different points of attack can be chosen is an ecouragement to the combination and simultaneous employment of two or more hypotensive drugs. Known associations, such as reserpine (with or without sympathicoplegics) or vasodilators and the diuretics, are examined, together with more recent combinations, such as propranolol, hydralgine and the diuretics, and spirolactone and the diuretics.", 
    "15": "Low and high doses of a dopamine blocking agent had effects on lever pressing for intravenous amphetamine reward which resembled the effects of reward reduction and reward termination, respectively. Noradrenaline blockade had no such effects. A role in central mediation of reward perception is suggested for dopamine but not for noradrenaline.", 
    "16": "Five female rhesus monkeys were treated with natural estrogens, 5 mg/day for three weeks, after which ovarian contractility was studied in vitro in one of the ovaries. Estrogen treatment was followed by progesterone, 25 mg/day for three weeks, after which the contractility of the remaining ovary was similarly measured. Responses to autonomic agents and prostaglandins were studied in both groups. Spontaneous ovarian contractility and ovarian contractile responsiveness to prostaglandins and norepinephrine were found to be enhanced after progesterone treatment. Cholinergic agonists had a stimulatory effect after progesterone and an inhibitory effect after estrogens. Our results suggest that ovarian contractile responsiveness is modified by the local steroid environment, perhaps through intracellular changes in cyclic AMP.", 
    "17": "Highly significant (P smaller than 0.0025) increases in adenylate cyclase activity were seen at all fetal age periods (5-17 weeks) whenever sodium fluoride (5-10 mM) was added to the enzyme prepared from human myocardium. Norepinephrine (NE) at 10-4 M significantly elevated adenylate cyclase activity commencing at 6-7 weeks (P smaller than 0.01). Beginning at 8-9 fetal weeks, glucagon (6x10-6 M) effectively activated adenylate cyclase. Other hormonal agents, namely, histamine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol at 10-4 M, demonstrated an ability to activate the enzyme (P smaller than 0.025) by as early as 6-7 weeks and continued to act in this manner throughout the remainder of the developmental periods investigated. The beta blocking agents, propranolol, significantly inhibited (P smaller than 0.25) the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by NE throughout the 8-15 fetal week periods.", 
    "18": "Stone heart or ischemic myocardial contracture is a complication of cardiopulmonary bypass characterized by contracture of the myocardium and inability to obtain cardiac output on manual massage. Stone heart has occurred only during aortic valve replacement and/or coronary artery bypass procedures. Predisposing factors are chronic congestive heart failure and myocardial hypertrophy with fibrosis secondary to longstanding aortic valve disease and/or coronary artery occlusive disease. Although the condition is rare, the outcome is usually fatal. Because of the biochemical and physiological implications of this syndrome, its prevention has been challenging. On the basis of our current concepts, prevention has been afforded by topical and general hypothermia and pretreatment with a small i.v. bolus of propranolol just prior to aortic occlusion. These measures have been utilized in potentially high-risk patients with the predisposition for stone heart and, thus far, the results have been satisfactory. The stone heart syndrome is an entity which should be recognized by all cardiac surgeons. Preventive measures must be aimed at protection of the myocardium during anoxic cardiac arrest.", 
    "19": "Renal artery constriction in the unilaterally nephrectomized, trained dog, with maintained renal arterial hypotension, produces a prompt increase in systemic renin activity and blood pressure. The hypertension normally induced by renal artery stenosis is prevented by prior treatment with the nonapeptide Pyr-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro (SQ 20, 881), which blocks conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Constant intravenous infusion of the inhibitor over several days of renal artery constriction prevents the development of chronic renovascular hypertension. Furthermore, a single injection of the nonapeptide restores blood pressure to normal in the early phase of renovascular hypertension, but becomes progressively less effective as salt and water retention occurs in the chronic stage when plasma renin activity returns to control levels. These data provide strong evidence that the renin-angiotensin system is responsible for the initiation of renovascular hypertension in the one-kidney Goldblatt dog, but that other factors become increasingly important in chronic renovascular hypertension.", 
    "20": "The report is based on a four-centre study on 25 patients with coronary insufficiency (ECG signs). In random sequence the following were given to each patient: a nitrate (isosorbide dinitrate), carbocromene, practolol, and oxyphedrine. The initial criterion for inclusion was S-T depression of 0.2 mV on stepwise exercise (bicycle ergometry). S-T depression, systolic blood pressure and heart rate changes were used as criteria. For each drug there was an acute test and a long-term test of 12 days. The Friedman test was used for the statistical evaluation of the results. Isosorbide dinitrate decreased the extent of S-T depression in the acute tests while practolol did so in the long-term test. Practolol reduced systolic pressure on long-term administration, with no difference in the acute experiment. Heart rate was reduced by practolol both acutely and long-term. These results give no indication for any possible differential treatment of coronary insufficiency, but this may be due to the selection of patients in this study.", 
    "21": "Cell-free preparations from superior and inferior colliculi of very young rats (1-3 days old) contained adenylate cyclase systems which were highly responsive to serotonin. The response to serotonin declined markedly during early development and was very low at maturity. Adenylate cyclase activity in the 10,000 times g particulate fraction from colliculi of newborn rats was significantly stimulated by 0.05 muM serotonin. Half-maximal activation was produced with less than 1 muM serotonin. Maximal stimulation of collicular adenylate cyclase was about 80% above basal enzyme activity and occurred with approximately 50 muM serotonin. Tryptamine and several derivatives of serotonin produced responses which were comparable to that obtained with serotonin; 5-methoxytryptamine was uniformly the most active compound tested. Norepinephrine or dopamine produced much smaller increases in adenylate cyclase activity. Stimulation of collicular adenylate cyclase by serotonin was significantly but incompletely blocked by serotonin antagonists, including d-lysergic acid diethylamide (d-LSD), 2-bromo-d-lysergic acid diethylamide, methysergide, 1-methyl-8 beta-carbobenzyloxy-aminomethyl-10 alpha-ergoline and cyproheptadine. Chlorpromazine also produced partial blockade. In contrast, l-lysergic acid diethylamide, haloperidol, propranolol, phenoxybenzamine and morphine were ineffective as serotonin blocking agents. Of the compounds which produced a partial blockage of serotonin action, d-LSD, cyproheptadine and chlorpromazine were themselves capable of stimulating adenylate cyclase activity. These results are consisent with the existence of multiple receptors in rat brain which are capable of interacting with indoleamines.", 
    "22": "1 The degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia has been determined in three healthy volunteers after the administration of single oral doses of acebutolol, practolol or propranolol. 2 Plasma levels of these drugs were determined either colorimetrically (acebutolol and practolol) or fluorimetrically (propranolol). The colorimetric assay of acebutolol in plasma is fully described but the other drugs were assayed by published methods. 3 The degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade and the plasma level for acebutolol and practolol were well correlated, whereas in the case of propranolol correlation was poor, due in part to the presence in plasma of active metabolites not detected by the fluorimetric assay. The plasma levels of practolol and propranolol are in agreement with those previously reported. 4 The maximum cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade achieved in this study with the respective single oral doses of acebutolol (300 mg), practolol (400 mg) or propranolol (40 mg) were similar in each of the three subjects. Therefore the beta-adrenoceptor blocking potencies of these drugs against isoprenaline-induced tachycardia are inversely related to these doses; indicating that propranolol is 7-8 times more potent than acebutolol and the latter slightly more potent than practolol.", 
    "23": "The propranolol-test was inaugurated as a simple method for the differentiation, whether repolarisation disturbance in the ECG is based on an organic or a functional cause. In order to determine the value of this test, in this study ECG-strips were done at rest and under bicycle exercise before and after assessment of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on 41 patients with organic heart disease (most of them with chronic ischaemic heart disease [CIHD]) and 20 patients which had no evidence of heart disease. 19 of 26 patients with heart disease and ST-segment changes already in the ECG at rest had a false positive propranolol-test. Ischaemic ECG-responses under exercise conditions were diminished by the beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, too. These results are in coincidence with findings that give evidence of considerable sympathetic component in the multifactorial origin of coronary insufficiency and of protective therapeutic efficiency of beta-adrenolytic substances. It is concluded that the propranolol-test brings no further information--at least with regard to CIHD--whether repolarisation changes in the ECG are organic or not.", 
    "24": "The clinical and haemodynamic findings in a patient with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and severe left ventricular outflow obstruction are presented. Treatment with an increasing dose of orally administered practolol up to a maximum of 1200 mg a day, resulted in symptomatic improvement, and abolition of the resting gradient when the patient was recatheterized six months later.", 
    "25": "Thirty-nine patients with a variety of diseases, including essential tremor, Parkinson's Disease, olivopontocerebellar degeneration, ataxia telangiectasia, and cervical cord injury with action tremor, were evaluated for the effect of one ounce of absolute alcohol ingestion. Tremor significantly subsided in 61.9% of E.T.; 46.6% of P.D.; one patient with A.T.; and one patient with C6 lesion. The tremor became worse in one patient with O.P.C.D. Twenty of these patients were treated with propranolol, an average dose of 92 mgm. per day, and re-evaluated three to six months later. All those who improved on alcohol improved on propranolol and the one whose tremor accentuated with alcohol had a similar response to propranolol. It is concluded that the tremorilytic effect of alcohol is neither specific for, nor limited to, essential tremor and is of no value in differentiating various neurological disorders which manifest as action tremor. It is recommended that one ounce of absolute alcohol by mouth be used as an office procedure to predict the response of patients' tremor to propranolol.", 
    "26": "The acute effects of the intravenous administration of large doses of furosemide on the left ventricle were studied in a controlled open-chest dog preparation. The data revealed that there was no direct effect of furosemide on the ventricular myocardium. This suggests that any acute cardiovascular effects seen clinically after the use of furosemide would most likely be due to changes in the effective circulating blood volume, direct effects upon certain vascular beds, electrolyte alterations, and possible secondary reflex cardiovascular effects rather than to any direct cardiac effects.", 
    "27": "Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia with left bundle branch block was found in a six-year-old girl. After prophylactic treatment with digitalis and with beta-adrenergic blocking agents, intermittent left bundle branch blocks appeared frequently. Thereby one could see repeatedly the pattern of a dependent Wenckebach phenomenon not yet described in childhood. Dependent Wenckebach phenomenon means the gradual development of a complete bundle branch block depending on the increasing atrial frequency drugin respiratory sinusarrhythmia. Immediately after complete bundle branch block, when the atrial frequency decreases significantly, the conductiondisturbance again normalized. Contrary to this, preexisting left bundle branch block disappeared when the frequency was increased by Orciprenalininfusions and be exercise. An evident explanation for this contrary behaviour cannot be given.", 
    "28": "Both sphincter and dilator muscle preparations of the cat iris contract to prostaglandins; F-2alpha and E-2 are the most potent and A-1 and B-1 the least. Ciliary muscle strips relax to PG'S provided that the strips are precontracted. E-1, E-2 and often F-2alpha are more potent relaxants than the remaining PG's. The effects of PG'S ARE NOT ALTERED BY ALPHA OR BETA BLOCKADE NOR BY ATROPINE; HOWEVER, PROPRANOLOL BLOCKS THE PG induced relaxation of the ciliary muscle. The effects of PG's on the sphincter are antagonized by catecholamines; but the latter act synergistically in contracting the dilator and in relaxing the ciliary muscle. Indomethacin markedly potentiates the effects of PG's on all three muscle preparations.", 
    "29": "A study was made of the possible mechanism(s) underlying minoxidil-induced increase in plasma renin activity (PRA). 10 patients with essential hypertension were treated with minoxidil and subsequently with a combination of minoxidil plus propranolol. Minoxidil lowered mean arterial pressure 31.6 plus or minus 3.3 mm Hg, mean plus or minus SEM. There was an associated increase in both PRA, 6.26 plus or minus 2.43 NG/ML/H, and heart rate, 21.4 plus or minus 2.7 beats/min. The changes in PRA and heart rate were positively correlated, r, 0.79. Addition of propranolol reduced mean arterial pressure by a further 10.1 plus or minus 1.5 mm Hg and returned heart rate to control levels. Propranolol reduced PRA significantly but not to control levels. Control PRA positively correlated with PRA on minoxidil, r, 0.97, and with PRA on minoxidil plus propranolol, r, 0.98. We conclude that control PRA is a major determinant of change in PRA with minoxidil. Minoxidil increased PRA by at least two mechanisms: (a) an adrenergic mechanism closely related to change in heart rate and blocked by propranolol, and (b) a mechanism(s) not sensitive to propranolol and possibly related to decrease in renal perfusion pressure.", 
    "30": "The correlation between the beta receptor blocking activity of pindolol and plasma level was studied in 8 subjects after a 10-mg oral dose. Exercise tachycardia was markedly reduced over a period of at least 6 hr. Significant effects were recorded 30 min after the drug. For each individual there was a close correlation between log plasma level and beta blockade. The regression lines were parallel as shown by analysis of covariance; the intercepts, however, were significantly different. It can be concluded that there is a correlation between plasma level and beta adrenergic blockade by pindolol, but the data failed to establish in different individuals the blood levels necessary to achieve effective adrenergic blockade.", 
    "31": "Injection of epinephrine into Mugil capito adapted to seawater is followed by a 40-60% inhibition of the Na and Cl effluxes. Simultaneously the Na influx is decreased by 30%, the overall result being a reduction of the net sodium extrusion rate by the gill. The change in Na influx is in part explained by a 75-80% decrease of the oral ingestion of seawater. This branchial adrenergic response is sensitive to alpha-blockade by phentolamine and tolazoline and insensitive to beta-blockade by propranolol. Both alpha-blockers are ineffective when injected alone. Propranolol injected alone mimics epinephrine while simultaneous injection of phentolamine blocks the response to propranolol. Rapid transfer experiments suggest that epinephrine inhibits the branchial Cl pump and its associated Na/K exchange mechanism. The leak pathway for these ions remains insensitive to epinephrine.", 
    "32": "Arterial blood pressure (ABP) responses to graded hemorrhage and passive head-up tilt were studied in restrained, anesthetized, and unanesthetized iguanas. The ABP fell slowly in response to hemorrhage up to a critical deficit of 35 plus or minus 19% of the estimated blood volume; the rate of ABP fall then increased nearly 40-fold to continued hemorrhage. Increased heart rate and decreased femoral arterial blood flow accompanied progressive hemorrhage. Propranolol (2-3 mug/kg) did not appreciably alter arterial pressure-hemorrhage curves but hemorrhage-induced increases in heart rate were diminished nearly 50%. Atropine had little effect on either the blood pressure or heart rate changes induced by hemorrhage. During passive tilts of 0-90 degrees carotid arterial pressure fell 33% before returning to control levels (2 min). Heart rate increased and femoral arterial blood flow and central venous pressure fell in response to head-up tilts. It is concluded that hemorrhage and passive head-up tilting can induce reflex cardiovascular changes that assist ABP regulation in iguanas.", 
    "33": "Halothane and other volatile anesthetics were found to relax uteri maximally contracted by oxytocin and to enhance the relaxant effect of propranolol and other agents (tetracaine, quinidine and chlorpromazine) with local anesthetic properties. Concentration-effect curves for inhibition by propranolol or tetracaine were shifted to the left by halothane. Methoxyflurane, chloroform and diethyl ether also increased the effect of propranolol. The tissue/medium ratio for propranolol was increased by halothane. The uptake of propranolol was saturable and was decreased at 2.5 degrees C, suggesting an active transport mechanism. The increased uptake of propranolol in the presence of halothane was probably insufficient to account for the synergism noted. Inhibition by propranolol and tetracaine was inversely related to the concentration of calcium in the medium. The inhibitory effect of propranolol, tetracaine, quinidine and chlorpromazine appeared to be related to their ability to inhibit calcium transport.", 
    "34": "Cumulative concentration-effect curves of oxytocin alone and with various antagonists were obtained in vitro on uteri from estrogen-treated rats. Graded concentrations of salbutamol, isoproterenol, papaverine, theophylline, thioglycollate, and MgCl2 produced a decrease in the maximal effect of oxytocin and a shift of the concentration-effect curves to the right. Salbutamol and isoproterenol appeared to act as functional antagonists of oxytocin in which agonist and antagonist each interacted with its own specific receptor to produce a decreased combined effect on a common effector. Antagonism by papaverine or theophylline was increased by prior or simultaneous treatment with salbutamol, isoproterenol, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. The potentiation had a rapid onset, was partially blocked by propranolol, persisted for at least 85 minutes following washout of salbutamol, and was not due to a residual effect of salbutamol. This interaction could result from phosphodiesterase inhibition by papaverine and the accumulation of higher levels of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate brought about by adenyl cyclase activation with the sympathomimetic amines.", 
    "35": "Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of propranolol in the dog, cat and rabbit produces a significant fall in arterial pressure. In the following experiments, regional brain propranolol concentrations and changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) have been measured in the rabbit after central and peripheral administration of the drug and the results compared to human brain/plasma levels. In the conscious rabbit, ICV injection of l-propranolol (500 mug) produced a prolonged fall in MAP, maximal at 105 minutes (16.8 plus or minus 5.9 mm Hg below base line). The regional brain propranolol concentrations after ICV injection of 14C-dl-propranolol (530 mug) were determined and the levels compared to those achieved following i.v. infusion of the unlabeled drug (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg/hr). The propranolol concentrations in the hypothalamus, medulla pons and midbrain after i.v. infusion were similar to the propranolol content in these areas at 60 and 120 minutes after ICV injection. Intravenous infusion of propranolol also resulted in significant falls in MAP between 60 and 120 minutes. In control studies, infusions of d-propranolol (1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg/hr), which is virtually devoid of beta adrenoceptor blocking activity, produced only slight reductions in MAP. Postmortem studies in patients treated with prolonged i.v. infusions of d-propranolol as part of the treatment of paraquat poisoning indicate that the brain/plasma concentration of propranolol in man is similar to that observed in the rabbit. Propranolol is therefore highly concentrated in human brain tissue and comparable brain levels in the rabbit result in a hypotensive response.", 
    "36": "The cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent practolol was used in the management of ventricular and supraventricular dysrhythmias associated with acute myocardial infarction in 134 patients, and in the management of these dysrhythmias in 19 atients with acute myocardial ischemia. Practolol was frequently effective in controlling ventricular dysrhythmias which occurred within the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. It was also effective in controlling the ventricular dysrhythmias which occurred after resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation. It was of particular value when therapeutic doses of lidocaine had been ineffective. Practolol was much less effective in controlling ventricular dysrhythmias which occurred more than 24 hours after acute infarction. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter were infrequently abolished by practolol in undigitalized patients after acute myocardial infarction. There was no correlation between the effectiveness of practolol and the blood concentration of the drug. One adverse effect of practolol was the occurence of sinus bradycardia with or without an increase in the frequency of ventricular ectopic beats. Bradycardia was sometimes accompanied by hypotension. Severe hypotension occasionally occurred in the absence of bradycardia.", 
    "37": "Seven children with idiopathic PVT ranging in age from one day to 18 yr, have been observed during the past three years. The presenting complaints and frequency of paroxysms varied greatly. Three patients presented with syncope; four were asymptomatic. Lidocaine was effective in terminating acute symptomatic attacks; procaine amide and propranolol were effective in long-term control of the arrhythmia. Monitoring of the dynamic ECG was invaluable in establishing the diagnosis, characterizing the arrhythmia, and evaluating the effects of activity and therapy.", 
    "38": "Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate (HR) were measured in unanesthetized squirrel monkeys trained to sustain for 20 seconds a forceful downward pull on an inverted T-bar. The MABP change during the strong static contraction of skeletal muscles involved in the pull was polyphasic, consisting of a brief initial rise and fall followed by a rise to a level above resting values which was sustained. At the end of the pull, the pressure fell transiently below the resting level. HR was elevated throughout the pull, returning towards the resting value in the minute following the pull. After hexamethonium, which reduced the resting MABP from about 120 mm Hg to about 80 mm Hg, the fall in MABP following the initial rise was enhanced, the level sustained through the pull was less than the resting level, and MABP fell still lower following the end of the pull. Phentolamine caused similar changes. Hexamethonium reduced the resting HR and abolished the HR changes during pulling. Raising the MABP after hexamethonium with phenylephrine further enhanced the falls in pressure during and following the pull. It is concluded that the polyphasic MABP changes to pulling involve direct mechanical effects of contracting skeletal muscle (responsible for the initial rise and contributing to the sustained rise), sympathetic vasoconstrictor discharge (contributing to the sustained rise and opposing the falls in MABP during and after the pull) and vasodilatation in active skeletal muscle (opposing the sustained rise during the pull and causing the fall after the pull). Although the participation of these factors in cardiovascular responses to exercise are generally well recognized, comparison of the patterns of response in rhesus and squirrel monkeys reveals large quantitative differences in the contributions of different factors and emphasizes again the caution that should be exercised in inferring direct environmental, emotional or conditioning effects on cardiovascular function.", 
    "39": "The effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents administered i.v. on the blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), renal hypertensive rats (RHR) and normotensive Wistar strain rats (NR) were studied. dl-Propranolol and dl-YB-2, 1 mg/kg i.v., caused a sustained rise in blood pressure in SHR and RHR. The maximum response of each beta-blocking agent after phentolamine, 10 mg/kg i.v., in SHR and RHR was significantly larger than that in NR. The potency ratio for the hypertensive activities of the 1- and d-isomers of propranolol and YB-2 was similar to the ratio of their beta-blocking activities. The pressor effects of the beta-blocking agents after phentolamine were significantly inhibited by adrenalectomy, reserpinization and pretreatment with hexamethonium. The results suggest that the pressor effect of the beta-blocking agents may be due to their beta-blocking activities and the unmasking of alpha-receptor activities of the blood vessels. Furthermore, the greater pressor effect of the agents observed in hypertensive rats is attributed to a greater activity of the sympathetic nervous system in these rats as compared to normotensive rats.", 
    "40": "1 The in vitro action of oestradiol-17-beta (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mug/ml) and progesterone (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mug/ml) on the spontaneous activity of the portal veins in female rats at different stages of gestation was studied. 2 Progesterone caused the spontaneous mechanical activity in the rat portal vein to decrease in amplitude and increase in frequency. This action was dose-dependent and the sensitivity of the tissue decreased throughout pregnancy. 3 Oestradiol-17-beta had a biphasic effect on spontaneous mechanical activity in the rat portal vein. At 0.1 mug/ml the vessel was stimulated while a similar effect to progesterone occurred with higher concentrations. The tissue was more sensitive to oestradiol at 7 days of gestation than at either the 10-14 or 17-21 day periods of gestation. 4 These effects of oestradiol and progesterone were still seen after blockade of the beta-adrenoceptors. 5 Hydrocortisone (10 mug/ml) had no inhibitory effect on the spontaneous mechanical activity of the vein. 6 The veins from the 17-21 days pregnant animals showed a smaller amplitude of contraction than comparable non-pregnant females.", 
    "41": "1 The actions of five beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, chosen because of reported differences in their selectivities, were compared using the positive chronotropic, vasodepressor and bronchodilator responses to isoprenaline in anesthetized dogs. 2 Propranolol was a potent antagonist of the isoprenaline responses in all three systems. 3 Practolol and acebutolol (M & B 17,803) blocked the positive chronotropic responses to isoprenaline to a greater extent than the vasodepressor or bronchodilator responses. 4 Butoxamine and alpha-methyl dichloroisoprenaline showed the opposite selectivity, blocking the vasodepressor and bronchodilator responses to isoprenaline to a greater extent than positive chronotropic responses. However, both drugs were considerably less potent than the other antagonists studied and their selectivities were less clear-cut than those of practolol or acebutolol. 5 All the antagonists lowered the resting heart rate and to a lesser extent the diastolic blood pressure. The effects of propranolol, practolol and acebutolol on heart rate probably result from cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade. With butoxamine and alpha-methyl dichloro isoprenaline, however, the effects on heart rate probably result from a direct cardiodepressant action. 6 The relevance of the results to the problem of the sub-classification of beta-adrenoceptors is discussed.", 
    "42": "1 Aminophylline inhibits the coronary vasodilator actions of adenosine. Our previous studies suggested that low dose infusions of aminophylline reduce coronary blood flow in the isolated heart. In the present study we investigated the actions of aminophylline on coronary blood flow and myocardial contractility in a transplanted heart model. Drugs were given by close coronary arterial infusion. 2 Aminophylline in low doses (200 mug/min) reduced coronary blood flow by 21 plus or minus 2% (mean plus or minus s.e. mean) but did not alter myocardial contractility or heart rate. Higher doses (500 and 1000 mug/min) increased coronary blood flow and myocardial contractility without changing heart rate. 3 Alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine did not affect the response to a low dose of aminophylline (200 mug/min). 4 Propranolol in doses of 10 and 30mug/min blocked beta-adrenoceptors but did not change coronary blood flow. The higher dose reduced myocardial contractility. 5 The effects of a high dose of aminophylline (1000 mug/min) on coronary blood flow were not changed by either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor blockade, although propranolol (30 mug/min) reduced the augmentation in myocardial contractility. 6 The results show that when given in doses which do not alter myocardial contractility, aminophylline reduces coronary blood flow in the isolated heart and that this is not mediated through an alpha-adrenoceptor mechanism. They also show that the increases in coronary blood flow and positive inotropic effects obtained with higher doses of aminophylline are not mediated through catecholamines and suggest that higher doses of aminophylline have a small direct coronary vasodilator action. The low dose vasoconstrictor response may be produced by inhibition of the coronary vasodilator action of locally produced adenosine.", 
    "43": "In various kinds of hypertension clonidine induced a decrease in urinary catecholamines, plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone, concommitant with a fall in blood pressure and pulse rate in both short term and chronic studies. Furthermore, clonidine lowered the plasma levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline but a postural increase in upright position still occurred. The capacity to increase renin during salt restriction seemed mainatined. When clonidine was withdrawn all parameters returned to pretreatment levels but in some cases a marked rebound increase in catecholamine production was seen. --During clonidine the increase in catecholamines and renin after insulin induced hypoglycemia was largely abolished. Under basal conditions oral penbutolol induced a decrease of pule rate and blood pressure but no change in plasma or urinary catecholamines. During treatment plasma renin was suppressed at rest and after exercise. A work load, which led to only minor changes in blood catecholamines before treatment, was associated with a marked increase during penbutolol. Medication with penbutolol reduced the response in plasma catecholamines after hypoglycemia and renin activity remained low. Clonidine seems to act mainly by central inhibtion of symapthetic tone. Penbutolol probably acts mainly peripherally but may also have a central effect.", 
    "44": "The antihypertensive effect of the new beta-blocker, ICI 66,082 was studied in 37 patients with renal or essential hypertension. A daily dose of 75 mg produced a significant antihypertensive effect and a further blood pressure decrease was obtained by increasing the daily dose up to 300 mg; at this treatment level, the antihypertensive effect averaged 29.4/24.0 mm Hg. Increasing the dose from 300 to 600 mg daily did not produce a significant additional blood pressure decrease. Six of the 37 patients retained fluid, producing a loss in the antihypertensive effect. No significant correlation was found between the percentage systolic blood pressure fall and the following parameters determined before therapy: systolic blood pressure and its variability, heart rate (at rest and after stimulation by exercise or isoproterenol), cardiac output and total peripheral resistance, renin concentration (at rest and after stimulation) and urinary excretion of catecholamines and derivates.", 
    "45": "Some pharmacodynamic properties of an oxypropanolamine substituted novel heterocyclic compound are described. Initial studies involve comparison of the racemic mixture, dl-timolol maleate, with the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent propranolol in the rat, dog and cat. dl-Timolol maleate is shown to be a potent inhibitor of cardiovascular beta-adrenergic receptors activated by isoproterenol or adrenergic nerve stimulation. Blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors is not observed even after extremely high doses. The compound is approximately 3 times more potent than propranolol in suppressing isoproterenol-induced cardioacceleration by the i.v. route of administration. dl-Timolol maleate is also extremely well absorbed when given orally, being then about 10 times more active than propranolol. Unlike propranolol, neither dl-timolol maleate nor its optical isomers possess demonstrable local anesthetic activity. Similar to propranolol and other beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents, activity of the compound resides predominantly in the l-isomer (timolol maleate.", 
    "46": "The influence of the new antiarrhythmic agent Propafenon on cardiac conduction and sinus node function was studied by using His-bundle recordings and atrial stimulation in 14 patients with normal and diseases conduction system. Intravenous administration of Propafenon in therapeutic dose (1-2 mg/kg) produced a significant prolongation of the atrioventricular conduction time. Increase of the A-H interval was observed in 13 of 14 subjects during sinus rhythm. Second degree A-V block (Wenckebach form) during atrial stimulation occurred at lower frequencies after administration of the drug. The impulse propagagion within the His-Purkinje system was depressed significantly (H-V interval in 8, H-S interval in 10 of 14 subjects). Propafenon did not cause any alteration in intraatrial conduction, but depression of the sinus node automaticity was noted. Total reversal of the drug induced prolonged atrioventricular conduction and a decrease of the sinus rate was seen after administration of orciprenaline. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking and local anaesthetic direct membrane actions are discussed as possible cause of the prolongation of atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction.", 
    "47": "Psychotropic drugs are discussed under the descriptive categories of antipsychotic, antidepressive, antimanic, anti-anxiety, and cognitive acting. In the antipsychotic classification, special attention is given to side effects (extrapyramidal motor signs, tardive dyskinesias, akathisis) and to dosage for the elderly. The section on congenitive acting drugs includes some pertinent observations on cognitive ability in the aging, the importance of correct diagnosis, and therapeutic strategy. The aged are a population at risk for not only disease, but iatrongenic illness due to direct and indirect drug action. Rational therapy involves understanding the underlying dynamics of the disease and thus the selection of the most effective treatment. Psychotropic drugs in an appropriate program are valuable therapeutic assets.", 
    "48": "Vasodilating antihypertensive drugs induce hypotension with reflex tachycardia, renin release, and fluid and electrolyte retention. Propranolol can impair this renin release. The studies described here were designed to determine the hemodynamic role of vasodilatory drug-induced renin release and inhibition thereof by propranolol in two animals models, the unanesthetized, normotensive and the unanesthetized, genetically hypertensive rat. In studies with normotensive rats, propranolol impaired renin release and tachycardia resulting from hydralazine and minoxidil and potentiated their hypotensive action. Two additional interventions against the renin-angiotensin system were used in evaluating the mechanism of this potentiation. One was removal of the renin source by nephrectomy, and the second was blockade of angiotensin's vasoconstrictor action using a selective angiotensin antagonist, saralasin (1-Sar-8-Ala-angiotensin II (previously known as P113)).. Both interventions potentiated vasocilatory drug hypotension, as did propranolol, but did not prevent reflex tachycardia. When combined with saralasin propranolol did not add to protentiation by this peptide. A similar pattern of blood pressure decrement and potentiation was seen in genetically hypertensive rats when propranolol or saralasin treatment preceded hydralazine. Propranolol was demonstrated to block hydralazine-induced increases in serum renin activity in genetically hypertensive rats. We conclude that hypotensive potentiation of vasocilating drugs by propranolol in these animal models is mediated to a large extent by impairment of renin release. Persistence of hypotensive tachycardia after nephrectomy and after saralasin in normotensive rats suggests the irrelevance of angiotensin's central nervous system stimulation to this cardiac effect. Clinical studies are underway to quantify the potential importance of this beneficial drug interaction in man.", 
    "49": "We studied the effects of i.v. 2 mg/kg morphine sulfate (MS) on coronary blood flow and resistance, left ventricular (LV) diameter and pressure (P), rate of change of pressure (dP/dt), and dP/dt/P in conscious dogs. An initial transient reduction in coronary vascular resistance, associated with increases in heart rate, dP/dt, dP/dt/P, and reductions in LV end-diastolic and end-systolic size were observed. This was followed by a prolonged increase in mean coronary vascular resistance, lasting from 5 to 30 min, while heart rate, arterial pressure, and LV end-diastolic diameter returned to control levels and dP/dt/P remained slightly but significantly above control. At 10 min, late diastolic coronary flow had fallen from 44 plus or minus 3 ml/min to a minimum level of 25 plus or minus 3 ml/min, while late diastolic coronary resistance had risen from 1.68 plus or minus 0.10 to 3.04 plus or minus 0.28 mm Hg/ml/min. Morphine also induced substantial coronary vasoconstriction when heart rate was held constant. Neither the MS-induced coronary vasoconstriction nor the positive inotropic response was abolished by bilateral adrenalectomy. The positive inotropic response of MS was reversed after beta blockade, but not the coronary vasoconstriction. Alpha receptor blockade abolished the late coronary vasoconstriction effects of morphine, and only dilatation occurred. In anesthetized dogs MS failed to produce late coronary vasoconstriction. Coronary after a respiratory-depressant dose of morphine, 10 mg/kg i.v. Smaller doses of MS, 0.25 mg/kg every 15 min, produced significant coronary vasoconstriction after a total dose of 0.75 mg/kg in the conscious dogs. The effects of morphine may differ in the normal dog and man and may vary depending upon the presence or absence of coronary artery disease. However, in the normal conscious dog, MS elicits a mild beta adrenergic increase in contractility and an important coronary vasoconstrictor effect, which is mediated through alpha adrenergic receptors.", 
    "50": "Catecholamine stimulation of adenyl cyclase in plasma membranes from rat myometrium was typical of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. Thus, isoproterenol was the most potent followed by epinephrine and norepinephrine; phenylephrine, a pure alpha-agonist, did not activate the enzyme. The catecholamine-induced activation was potently inhibited by propranolol, whereas phenozybenzamine was without effect. The ED50 for 1-isoproterenol activation was 10- minus 7 M. Binding of [3H]-d-isoproterenol to the same preparations bore little resemblance to the pattern of 1-isoproterenol activation of adenyl cyclase. Propranolol, even at high concentrations, was without significant effect. The degree of binding was inversely rflated to the osmolarity suggesting that diffusion may have contributed to the binding. This contention was further supported by the time course of binding which was biphasic- the first component (smaller than 4 min) being less affected by osmolarity than the second (greater than 4 min). The optimum pH for binding was 7.4.", 
    "51": "Although many different beta blockers are now in clinical use, there is very little information concerning their relative efficacy, and it is still not clear what clinical importance should be attached to properties such as positive inotropic stimulation (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or ISA) and membrane stabilizing action (\"local anaesthetic effect\" or \"quinidine-like effect\"). In this report we compare the ability of patients with angina to exercise on a bicycle ergometer while receiving a series of commonly used beta blockers, and attempt to determine the importance of ISA. The investigation is in four parts with the drugs given orally or intravenously: statistical analysis of the results was carried out using standard methods, both parametric and non-parametric (Friedmann analysis of variance, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test) by two independent statisticians. The relevant properties of drugs included in this paper are summarized in Table I. Laboratory reports using many different animal preparations may differ from this assessment under specific conditions, and the Table is intended only as a guide to the generally accepted properties of these drugs when used clinically. Results for sotalol are included for reference in the first part of this paper but the drug was withdrawn from clinical use and was not studied further.", 
    "52": "A series of 1-amino-3-aryloxy-2-propanols has been synthesized and examined for cardioselective beta-blockade. The introduction of the (3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino group lead to the most cardioselective agents. Structure-activity relationships are discussed. Of the compounds tested 1-[(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino]-3-(m-tolyloxy)-2-propanol was selected for clinical trial because of optimal potency and selectivity.", 
    "53": "Previous studies have shown that exposure to high altitude results in an initial increase in heart rate, followed by a return to sea-level values within several days; circulating catecholamines rise progressively during this time. Nine conscious dogs were studied in normoxia (N) and after 10 days' exposure to 445 torr (CH). The mean (plus or minus SE) hematocrit was higher in CH (50 plus or minus 2 vs. 42 plus or minus 1%) while Pa-o2 (53 plus or minus 1 vs. 97 plus or minus 2 torr) and PaCO2 (27 plus or minus 1 vs. 35 plus or minus 1 torr) were lower than in N. A 3.5-fold increase in plasma norepinephrine above the N value was found in CH. Arterial pH, heart rate (HR), and mean femoral arterial pressure (MAP) did not differ significantly in N and CH. Isoproterenol (ISO), 0.5 mug/kg iv, produced an average increase in HR of 92 plus or minus 9 beats/min in N, but only 66 plus or minus 8 beats/min in CH (P smaller than .02). Reduction in MAP after ISO were similar. Pretreatment with propranolol, 0.15 mg/kg iv, reduced HR equally in N and CH without affecting MAP, but diminished the HR response to ISO significantly more in CH than in N. The attenuated chronotropic response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation following chronic hypobaric hypoxia suggests a relative cardiac refractoriness secondary to an increased level of sympathetic activity.", 
    "54": "Development of parasympathetic and sympathetic reflexes controlling heart rate, vascular pressures, and blood flows was investigated in fetal lambs weighing 300-5,800 g (65-165 days' gestation). Cardiovascular responses to veratridine injections, atrial stretching, bilateral cervical vagotomy, and cholinergic blockade with atropine were used to test parasympathetic activities. Responses to propranolol and phenoxybenzamine were used to test beta- and alpha-adrenergic activities. Autonomic ganglionic blockade and stimulation provided additional information on both cholinergic and adrenergic systems. Fetal responses to various tests were compared to those of the mother. Results show: a) little parasympathetic tone on resting heart rate and other circulatory functions exists prior to fetal maturity; b) despite the feeble resting tone, the parasympathetic system is capable of exerting significant control when stimulated in both premature and mature fetuses, the capability increases as fetus approaches term; c) alpha- and beta-adrenergic tone in control of resting heart rate and peripheral circulation exists in early fetal life and increases as the fetus reaches maturity, and both adrenergic receptors respond strongly to stimuli in immature, premature, and mature fetuses; d) in immature fetuses, veratridine does not elicit a vagally mediated reflex; instead, it produces a centrally mediated alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation; e) the fetal cardiovascular response to any given test is dampened by the existence of the various vascular shunts, the umbilicoplacental circulation and, possibly, by incomplete maturation of vasomotor tone.", 
    "55": "The pithed rat preparation has been used to study the sympathomimetic activity of 6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ). In this preparation, an increase in blood pressure is indicative of alpha stimulation, and an increase in heart rate is indicative of beta stimulation. Using this preparation, we have found that TIQ is approximately 3 orders of magnitude less potent than norepinephrine in evoking changes in blood pressure and heart rate. The activity of TIQ has also been studied in pithed animals which had been previously sympathectomized with 6-hydroxydopamine. Sympathectomy produced a marked reduction in cardiac norepinephrine, and it nearly abolished vascular responses to injected tyramine. Following sympathectomy, pithed animals were supersensitive to norepinephrine and subsensitive to TIQ. Similar results were obtained on pithed animals that had been pretreated with cocaine. It is concluded that TIQ is a weak sympathomimetic agent possessing both directly and indirectly acting properties. The data are discussed in terms of a proposal that TIQ may be a false adrenergic transmitter.", 
    "56": "1. Renal hypertensive dogs were treated with hydrochlorothiazide (8-2 mumol/kg or 33 mumol/kg daily for 7 days), or timolol (4-6 mumol/kg daily for 4 days), a potent beta-adrenergic blocking agent, or combinations of these drugs). Changes in mean arterial blood pressure and plasma renin activity were measured over the treatment period. 2. Neither drug significantly lowered arterial blood pressure when administered alone. Plasma renin activity, which did not change during treatment with timolol, was substantially elevated during treatment with hydrochlorothiazide. 3. When timolol was administered concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide, plasma renin activity was suppressed and blood pressure was significantly lowered. 4. These observations suggest that compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin system limits the antihypertensive activity of hydrochlorothiazide in renal hypertensive dogs and suppression of diuretic-induced renin release by timolol unmasks the antihypertensive effect of the diuretic.", 
    "57": "Levels of plasma prolactin were estimated in ovariectomized, estrogen-treated rats following the systemic administration of several neural blocking and stimulating drugs. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, at high doses, increased plasma prolactin. Phenotlamine, another alpha-adrenergic blocker, and propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, also increased prolactin but the responses were small and transient. Clonidine, an alpha-adrenergic stimulating drug, elevated prolactin levels whereas the beta-adrenergic stimulator isoproterenol had no effect. Dopaminergic blockade by pimozide increased levels of prolactin while stimulation of dopamine receptors by apomorphine decreased prolactin release. Atropine (a muscarinic chilinergic blocker), arecoline (a muscarinic stimulator) and nicotine (a nicotinic cholinergic stimulating drug) did not affect basal prolactin levels. Mecamylamine (a nicotinic blocker) produced a small transient elevation in plasma prolactin. Methiothepin, an alleged serotoninergic blocker, markedly increased prolactin secretion, as did serotonin. The data suggested the involvement of several neurotransmitters in the control of basal secretion of prolactin.", 
    "58": "Glucagon causes marked elevations of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in dogs when administered intravenously (i.v.) in small doses. The associated natriuresis is thought to be entirely due to increments in the filtered sodium load. In this study, renal denervation, thyroparathyroidectomy, and blockade of cholinergic, alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic and histaminergic receptors did not prevent the usual glucagon-induced elevations of GFR or rate of sodium excretion (UNaV). This effect of glucagon was not mediated through the release of cyclic AMP, or by plasma compositional changes of Ca-2+, K+, or amino acids. Pure porcine secretin, in doses of 5--10 mug/min delivered either i.v. or into the left renal artery did not alter GFR; clearance of the p-aminohippurate (CPAH) or UNaV in either hydropenic or saline-loaded dogs. Nor did this polypeptide, structurally very similar to glucagon, abolish the effect of glucagon on GFR. It did, however, partially inhibit the glucagon-induced natriuresis, presumably by preventing a previously undetected glucagon action on tubular reabsorption of sodium.", 
    "59": "Changes in the cardiac output and blood flow in the renal, superior mesenteric and carotid arteries in anesthetized dogs were observed, using the non-cannulating electromagnetic flow meter. Dibutyryl cyclic-AMP, 5 mg/kg body weight, was given intravenously and the following results were obtained: 1) Dibutyryl cyclic-AMP increased the stroke volume and the cardiac output, and slightly increased the heart rate. These effects appeared 3 to 5 min after administration of dibutyryl cyclic-AMP. 2) The mean systemic blood pressure as well as the central venous pressure fell slightly. 3) The renal and the superior mesenteric artery blood flow increased markedly, but the carotid artery blood flow did not change. 4) Distribution of the cardiac output to the renal and superior mesenteric arteries did not change but distribution to the carotid artery decreased. 5) Total peripheral resistance, renal artery vascular resistance and superior mesenteric artery vascular resistance decreased, and carotid artery vascular resistance decreased slightly. 6) The cardiac output and blood flow were enhanced by aminophylline (3 mg/kg), and were not blocked by propranolol (0.3 mg/kg).", 
    "60": "Chronic administration of ouabain (3 mg/Kg body weight, subcutaneously, once daily for consecutive 15 days) definitely inhibited epinephrine-induced increase of adrenal corticosterone secretion. The inhibition rate increased along with frequency of ouabain administration. Increase in adrenal corticosterone synthesis and secretion by ACTH (20-50 mU/rat) administration was partially suppressed by pretreatment with chronic ouabain administration. A slight but significant increase of adrenal corticosterone secretion caused by epinephrine administration in hypophysectomized rats was also inhibited by pretreatment with ouabain administration. Chronic administration of neither phentolamine (1 mg/rat, intraperitoneally, once daily for consecutive 15 days) nor propranolol (3 mg/Kg body weight, subcutaneously, once daily for consecutive 15 days) caused significant changes in adrenal corticosterone secretion in response to ACTH as well as to epinephrine. Chronic administration of ouabain in rats causes not only elevated secretion of ACTH from anterior pituitary but also functional change in adrenals leading to suppression of corticosterone secretion in response to ACTH or epinephrine administration.", 
    "61": "Trimepranol a beta adrenergic blocking drug released serotonin from rat isolated and plasma-rich thrombocytes in vitro. The release was time- and dose-dependent. With the same concentrations this drug inhibited the histamine release from isolated rat mast cells. Aggregation of isolated or plasma-rich thrombocytes induced by ADP was inhibited by Trimepranol. The inhibition was dose, time dependent and reversed by calcium ions.", 
    "62": "(1) The inhibition of potassium uptake by low concentration of norepinephrine (3 X 10-8 M) and of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP, 10 minus5 M) was studied in cardiac Purkyn\u0115 fibres. (2) The inhibitory action of DBcAMP on K uptake was abolished by the alpha blocker phentolamine. (3) Norepinephrine alone decreased K uptake and such inhibition was somewhat larger when DBcAMP was added. DBcAMP alone caused the usual decrease in K uptake but addition of norepinephrine abolished it. (4) The inhibition caused by norepinephrine reduced the increase in uptake caused by a high concentration (10 minus 3 M) of DBcAMP. (5) The inhibitory effect of norepinephrine was reversed in the presence of high concentration of magnesium (5.25 mM). (6) The inhibitory effect of norepinephrine was reversed by aminophylline and abolished by caffeine. (7) The inhibitory action of norepinephrine and BCcAMP was reversed or abolished, respectively, by imidazole. (8) It is concluded that the inhibition of potassium uptake by low concentration of DBcAMP is mediated by an alpha receptor mechanism and that possibly the \"receptors\" for this effect of norepinephrine and DBcAMP are located at different sites. Also it appears that DBcAMP may be acting at the membrane and that the action of methylxanthines and imidazole is not necessarily mediated only by a modification of phosphodiesterase activity.", 
    "63": "Ventilatory and bronchomotor responses to baroreceptor afferent stimulation were studied in anaesthetized rabbits breathing spontaneously. The stimuli used were either the increase in carotid sinus pressure or the electrical stimulation of the cut central end of the aortic nerve. Respiratory effects of aortic barodenervation were also studied. Normoxic, normocapnic steady state was verified by repeated measurement of PO2, PCO2 and pH in arterial blood. Stimulation of both aortic and carotid baroreceptors provoked an early decrease of tidal volume and total pulmonary resistances without change in respiratory frequency. Aortic nerve stimulation induced an important and slowly adapting ventilatory and bronchomotor effect, whereas changes in carotid sinus pressure produced slight variation in respiratory parameters. Aortic nerve section resulted in an early and prolonged increase of total pulmonary resistances. Surgical or chemical (atropine) vagotomy did not change the bronchodilation observed under stimulation of the carotid sinus; however this effect was suppressed by intravenous injection of propranolol. This observation shows the importance of the sympathetic outflow in the genesis of bronchomotor responses following baroreceptor stimulation. In conclusion the baroreceptor stimulation provokes simultaneous decrease of both ventilation and total pulmonary resistances; aortic nerves seemed to exert permanent control on bronchomotor tone.", 
    "64": "A 31-year-old woman with a ventricular parasystolic rhythm is described. The arrhythmia was always absent below a rate of 72 per minute, and always present over a rate of 106 per minute. Voluntary heart-rate control was learned using a biofeedback techinque, as a result of which she could increase her rate by 25 per minute and decrease it by 1-2 per minute. Both voluntary speeding and exercise brought on the arrhythmia, but later in the training she could reach a higher heart-rate before the arrhythmia appeared. Propranolol inhibited the arrhythmia only to the extent that is slowed the heart.", 
    "65": "Like mechanical stimulation, electrical stimulation can nearly always activate lipolysis, as evidenced by increased blood glycerol and NEFA. The interpretation of this phenomenon is discussed and importance is attached to catecholamine mediation, since administration of a beta-blocking agent is sufficient to cause a significant reduction in the extent of the phenomenon. Other mechanisms can possibly be sought in the muscle fibres present in subcutaneous tissue, whose contraction induces increases blood lymph flow. While electrical stimulation of adipose tissue fragments in vitro gave no appreciable results, it is still possible that electrical impulses act even more intimately by means of direct physical modification of the more elementary metabolic mechanisms.", 
    "66": "An analysis of the effect of the ordinary physical factors acting on living beings on the splitting of adipose tissue triglycerides is reported. Massage was usually responsible for activation of lipolysis, or at least for an increase in blood glycerol and NEFA. If carried out for some time and repeated over a period of days, it appears capable of maintaining chronically enhanced lipolysis. The possible causes of these effects are discussed and particular stress is laid on the release of catecholamines by tissue nerve endings. Partial confirmation of this can be seen in the fact that activation of lipolysis can be depressed by administering beta-blocking drugs. The data also suggest that non-neuroendocrine mechanisms may exert a more immediate action on cell metabolism. Such mechanisms are concerned with a sector of cell life about which little is yet known, wherein every biological process is the result of phenomenon dependent on molecular physics."
