The drugs studied included 5-HT antagonists, beta-adrenergic antagonists, and calcium channel blockers. At 5-HT1A sites labeled by 3H-8-hydroxy-2-(N,N-dipropylamino)-tetralin, (-)pindolol, alprenolol, (-)propranolol, methysergide, cyproheptadine, and pizotifen are similar in that they display affinities of approximately 100 nM for this receptor. By contrast, only methysergide displays relatively high affinity (120 +/- 60 nM), whereas all other drugs have affinities greater than 1,000 nM for non-5-HT1A sites labeled by 3H-5-HT in human cortex. Finally, at 5-HT2 receptors labeled by 3H-spiperone, cyproheptadine, methysergide, and pizotifen are extremely potent agents (affinity constants of 1 to 10 nM), whereas amitriptyline (23 +/- 4 nM), verapamil (140 +/- 50 nM), and nifedipine (320 +/- 80 nM) are moderately potent. All other drugs are inactive at concentrations below 1,000 nM. These data demonstrate that most antimigraine drugs display high affinity for the 5-HT1A and/or 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in human brain. However, antimigraine efficacy cannot be explained by drug interactions with a single 5-HT receptor subtype.", 
    "1": "The lingual serous glands of rat tongue, the Ebner glands, secrete a potent acid lipase that acts in the stomach where it initiates the digestion of dietary fat. The factors affecting its secretion were studied 'in vitro' on Ebner slices. The lipolytic activity was measured in the incubation medium using tributyrine as substrate and by titration at pH: 5.4. Cholecystokinin (10(-9) M) and carbachol (10(-5) M) efficiently stimulated lipase secretion (3 fold over basal rate). The parasympathetic agent triggered secretion involving a calcium dependent system. Atropin (10(-4) M) blocked this cholinergic effect by about 40%. Lipase secretion was stimulated by epinephrine and isoproterenol. Propranolol (beta-antagonist) inhibited the adrenergic stimulation, while phentolamine was ineffective. The inhibitory effect of the selective beta 1-antagonist (Betaxolol) and the lack of effect of the selective beta 2-antagonist (ICI 118551) suggest the participation of beta 1-adrenoceptors in the secretion mechanism.", 
    "2": "This study was undertaken to assess a clinical measurement (leg squats) in order to determine the adequacy of beta-adrenergic blockade (AdBB) utilizing the symptom-limited exercise test heart rate of less than 120 beats/min as the standard. Seventy subjects were tested, 35 receiving beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs in clinically determined maximal doses, and 35 subjects not receiving these agents. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and positive (Pv+) and negative (Pv-) predictive values were calculated for post-leg squat heart rates of less than or equal to 100, less than or equal to 110 and less than or equal to 120 beats/min. Other variables analyzed for AdBB were resting heart rates and post-leg squat heart rate increase greater than 50% over baseline. A cost-benefit analysis was also performed. It was concluded that: (1) Neither the resting heart rate or percent increase in heart rate compared to baseline reliably predicted AdBB. (2) In patients receiving beta-blocking drugs, a post-squat heart rate of less than or equal to 100 beats/min had a Se = .82, Sp = .67, Pv+ .70, and Pv- .80, values not high enough to be reliably used in many clinical situations. (3) If the post-squat heart rate was greater than 110 beats/min, however, AdBB is probably absent, since no subjects on beta blockers with maximum exercise test heart rate less than or equal to 120 beats/min had a post-leg squat heart rate greater than 110 beats/min. (4) For a reasonable range of cost and test performance estimates, utilization of the leg squat test as described here is favored on the basis of cost-benefit analysis.",

A better understanding of the pathogenesis of acute ischaemic syndromes and developments in interventional cardiology in the past decade have helped us rationalize our approach to this high-risk subset and achieve maximal myocardial salvage with its short- and long-term benefits.", 
    "4": "Sixty six patients with angina at rest were investigated by exercise electrocardiography, thallium scintigraphy, and coronary arteriography. A positive exercise electrocardiogram was highly predictive (93%) but poorly sensitive (52%) of coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis). Thallium scintigraphy was as predictive of the presence of coronary artery disease (91%) but was also highly sensitive (91%). The diagnostic contribution of the thallium scan was greatest in those patients with an inconclusive exercise electrocardiogram without Q waves.",

    "6": "To examine the role of chronic calcium entry blocking drug administration on perioperative myocardial ischemia and, specifically, the frequency of hemodynamically unrelated ischemia, the authors studied 444 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operations. Before induction of anesthesia, 119 patients who chronically took calcium entry blocking drugs received nifedipine 20 mg or diltiazem 60 mg orally, 74 received calcium entry and beta adrenergic blocking drugs, 71 received beta blocking drugs only, and 180 received neither. New ischemia occurred in 208 (46.8%) patients; 55 at arrival to the operating room, 86 only after induction, and 67 separately during both periods. Two-thirds of all ischemia was not related to extremes of heart rate or blood pressure; this type was not less frequent in patients receiving calcium entry blocking drugs. Ischemia did occur less frequently in the two patient groups receiving beta adrenergic blocking drugs (34% vs. 53%), a result of less tachycardia both on arrival (3.4% vs. 15.4%) and during anesthesia, when peak heart rate exceeded 109 bpm in only one of 145 beta-blocked patients compared to 29 of 299 not receiving beta blocking drugs. While ischemia appeared during anesthesia in 34.5% of all patients, its incidence was doubled (63%) when heart rate was greater than or equal to 110 bpm. At lower heart rates, the incidence of ischemia did not differ among groups. With respect to all types of ischemia, patients receiving calcium entry blocking drugs only were indistinguishable from those receiving no antianginal therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "We have investigated the effect of beta-blockade and beta-blockade + triiodothyronine (T3) administration on 86Rb (K) influx and [3H]-ouabain binding by human leucocytes and on plasma potassium concentrations. beta-blockade with nadolol (40 mg daily) for five days resulted in a significant decrease in 86Rb influx and [3H]-ouabain binding, as well as an increase in plasma potassium concentration. T3 administration thereafter caused a fall in plasma concentration and an increase in 86Rb influx. There was a tendency toward restoration of [3H]-ouabain binding to normal. The fact that beta-blockade inhibits 86Rb (K) influx and increases plasma potassium concentration implies that endogenous adrenaline exerts a tonic stimulatory effect upon 86Rb (K) influx and a suppressive effect on plasma potassium concentrations in vivo. T3 administration induces an increase in 86Rb (K) influx and a fall in plasma potassium concentrations. This suggests that either the effect of T3 is independent of beta-adrenoceptors or that the known increase in beta-adrenoceptor population secondary to T3 administration increases sensitivity to circulating adrenaline in spite of beta-blocker administration.", 
    "8": "Local neural circuitry in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) involved in cardiovascular control was studied by injecting nanoliter volumes of excitatory amino acids into the structure. Experiments were performed on urethane-anesthetized, artificially ventilated rats. Multibarrel micropipettes were used for pressure ejection of drugs or a dye for marking ejection sites. Ejected volumes, ranging from 200 pl to 25 nl, were directly monitored for every injection. Injections of as little as 200 fmol of L-glutamate in 200 pl into the medial and lateral NTS region rostral to the obex elicited marked, site-specific decreases in arterial pressure and heart rate. The majority of these responses were eliminated by blockade of parasympathetic and sympathetic neural outflow. At sites caudal to obex, in the commissural region of the NTS, L-glutamate injections produced marked elevations in heart rate and arterial pressure which were sympathetically mediated. Responses to L-glutamate were attenuated by concurrent injection of glutamic acid diethyl ester and DL-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate, or lidocaine. These results indicate a heterogeneity in the spatial organization of brain-stem circuitry underlying cardiovascular control that has not been previously described.", 
    "9": "L-653,328 is the acetate ester of L-652,698 ((S)-3-tert-butylamino-1-[4-[2(hydroxy)ethyl]phenoxy]2-propanol). The penetration of L-652,698 into the albino rabbit eye was enhanced when the compound was instilled as its prodrug acetate ester. The instillation (one drop of 50 microliter) of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1% solutions of L-653,328 significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner the elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) of alpha-chymotrypsinized rabbits by 3.2, 4.7 and 6.1 mm Hg, respectively. A 0.01% solution of L-652,698 failed to significantly lower IOP, whereas this dose of timolol (3.8 mm Hg) and betaxolol (3.3 mm Hg) was effective. L-652,698 was active at 0.05% and 0.1%. Extraocular beta-adrenoceptor blockade was quantified in ganglion-blocked, conscious rabbits by determining effects on heart rate and blood pressure changes to i.v. isoproterenol (0.5 microgram/kg). Doses of timolol blocking isoproterenol-induced hypotension and tachycardia by 50% were 0.0065% and 0.03%, respectively. The corresponding doses for betaxolol were greater than 3% (43% inhibition) and 0.3%. Heart rate and blood pressure changes to isoproterenol were blocked by 18 and 36%, respectively, after the instillation of a 3% solution of L-653,328. The reduced propensity of L-653,328 for extraocular beta-adrenoceptor blockade stems from the modest affinity of L-652,698, its active moiety, for beta-adrenoceptors. The Ki values of L-652,698 for displacement of 125I-iodocyanopindolol binding to beta 1-(left ventricle) and beta 2-binding sites (iris + ciliary body) in the rabbit were 5.7 microM and 7.3 microM, respectively. In marked contrast, the corresponding values for timolol were 12 nM and 1.8 nM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "Twenty-four men with mild essential hypertension were assigned randomly to receive propranolol (n = 9), atenolol (n = 7), or a placebo (n = 8). All subjects participated in a 12-week study and provided physiological and behavioral data four times during the study: after a medication-free baseline period (Session 1); after 2 weeks of medication, without exercise (Session 2); after 8 weeks of continued medication while participating in a program of aerobic exercise (Session 3); and after 2 weeks of maintenance exercise without medication (Session 4). Subjects' maximal oxygen uptake increased significantly between Sessions 2 and 3, and the magnitude of this increase did not vary across the drug groups. Subjects' resting heart rates varied as a function of the presence of beta-blocking medication, but there was in addition a reduction attributable to exercise training that did not vary across the drug groups. The decrease in blood pressure associated with beta-blockade (Session 2) was not decreased any further by exercise training (Session 3). Despite an increase in blood pressure following the withdrawal of active medication (Session 4), blood pressure remained significantly lower compared with the Session 1 baseline level. Performance in a reaction-time test of short-term memory functioning improved slightly for all three groups between Sessions 1 and 2 and remained constant thereafter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "Changes in cardiac performance in response to epinephrine administered by graded infusion were assessed by M-mode echocardiography in normotensive healthy subjects after pretreatment with placebo, the beta 1-selective blocker atenolol, or the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol. Epinephrine alone increased heart rate and left ventricular end diastolic dimension and decreased left ventricular end systolic dimension. Left ventricular performance as assessed by fractional shortening and systolic blood pressure/end-systolic volume (P/V) ratio was also increased. Atenolol pretreatment did not significantly affect the increase in heart rate by epinephrine. However, atenolol did prevent the effects of epinephrine on left ventricular dimensions and left ventricular performance at the lower infusion rates and significantly blunted these effects at the highest infusion rate. After propranolol, epinephrine significantly decreased left ventricular end diastolic dimension despite decreasing heart rate and left ventricular emptying (associated with a high afterload). P/V ratio remained unchanged. These results indicate that beta 2-receptors may play a major role in the increase in heart rate caused by epinephrine. In contrast, epinephrine's positive inotropic effect appears to be mediated primarily via beta 1-receptors and, at higher concentrations, possibly also through beta 2-receptors. The pattern of changes in left ventricular end diastolic dimension suggests that epinephrine increases venous return via both beta 1- and beta 2-receptor stimulation and that alpha-receptor stimulation (epinephrine after propranolol) may actually decrease venous return.", 
    "12": "The effects of four single oral doses of ICI 118,551 (a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking agent: doses 10, 20, 50, and 100 mg) have been compared with placebo in five normal, healthy volunteers on some cardiovascular responses to intravenous infusions of dobutamine. Increasing infusions of dobutamine produced reproducible dose-dependent reductions in systolic time intervals and increases in systolic blood pressures, these responses representing positive inotropic effects of dobutamine. These effects of dobutamine were unaffected 2 hours after administration by 10 mg ICI 118,551 and minimally by 20 mg; the 50 mg dose attenuated the systolic time interval effect whereas the 100 mg dose attenuated further the systolic time interval reduction and also the increase in systolic blood pressure. These results allow a conclusion that at unit doses of 50 mg and above, ICI 118,551 will produce demonstrable effects on beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "13": "This study examined the response to intra-arterial norepinephrine and sympathetic nerve stimulation on perfusion pressure of cannulated dog femoral and left circumflex coronary arteries perfused at constant flow rates. Sympathetic nerve stimulation was delivered through the decentralized inferior cardiac nerve and the lumbar sympathetic chain; beta-adrenergic blockade was maintained with propranolol. In the coronary artery, the vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine was blunted by alpha 1-adrenergic blockade with prazosin but was abolished by alpha 2-adrenergic blockade with rauwolscine, indicating postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction. In the femoral artery, prazosin decreased norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction by 20-40%; the subsequent addition of rauwolscine completely abolished vasoconstriction, indicating that both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors contributed to vasoconstriction. Sympathetic nerve stimulation produced frequency-dependent increases of perfusion pressure in both coronary and femoral vascular beds. Prazosin caused approximately 50% reduction in the vasoconstrictor response of the coronary vascular bed and approximately 30% reduction in the femoral bed. The addition of rauwolscine completely blocked the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation in coronary and femoral vascular beds. These studies demonstrate that postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated mechanisms participate in vasoconstriction in response to both exogenous norepinephrine and sympathetic nerve stimulation in the canine coronary and femoral vascular beds.", 
    "14": "We investigated the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the pulmonary vascular response to increasing cardiac index after a period of hypoperfusion (defined as reperfusion) in conscious dogs. Base-line and reperfusion pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots were generated by stepwise constriction and release, respectively, of an inferior vena caval occluder to vary Q. Surprisingly, after 10-15 min of hypoperfusion (Q decreased from 139 +/- 9 to 46 +/- 3 ml.min-1.kg-1), the pulmonary vascular pressure gradient (pulmonary arterial pressure-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) was unchanged over a broad range of Q during reperfusion compared with base line when the ANS was intact. In contrast, pulmonary vasoconstriction was observed during reperfusion after combined sympathetic beta-adrenergic and cholinergic receptor block, after beta-block alone, but not after cholinergic block alone. The pulmonary vasoconstriction during reperfusion was entirely abolished by combined sympathetic alpha- and beta-block. Although sympathetic alpha-block alone caused pulmonary vasodilation compared with the intact, base-line P/Q relationship, no further vasodilation was observed during reperfusion. Thus the ANS actively regulates the pulmonary circulation during reperfusion in conscious dogs. With the ANS intact, sympathetic beta-adrenergic vasodilation offsets alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction and prevents pulmonary vasoconstriction during reperfusion.", 
    "15": "The effects of time of sampling on plasma lipids and lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were investigated in 88 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. Patients with a myocardial infarction or major surgery within 6 weeks before catheterization were excluded. All subjects were sampled in the fasting state at the time of arteriotomy before systemic heparinization and at least 30 days after discharge from the hospital (mean 275 days) in the free living state. No statistically significant differences were noted in total cholesterol (220 +/- 51 vs 226 +/- 48 mg/dl), triglycerides (191 +/- 77 vs 191 +/- 113 mg/dl) and calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (149 +/- 46 vs 150 +/- 43 mg/dl). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol values were significantly lower (p less than 0.0001) in subjects sampled before catheterization than in the free living state (32 +/- 10 vs 37 +/- 10 mg/dl, mean change 14%). Moreover, the frequency of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 35 mg/dl was 77% before catheterization and 44% in the free living state. This effect was neither due to beta-adrenergic drugs nor to the length of time between samplings. In view of these findings, a screening lipid profile for patients with coronary artery disease should be performed in the free living state.", 
    "16": "In some patients with documented atrioventricular (AV) nodal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), the arrhythmia is not inducible during a standard stimulation protocol. In these patients the level of sympathetic activity may be an important factor. This study evaluates the influence of isoproterenol on anterograde and retrograde pathway properties in patients with AV nodal SVT and the mechanism by which this SVT is facilitated. Group 1 consisted of 8 consecutive patients, ages 23 to 85 years (mean +/- standard error, 57 +/- 8) who had no inducible AV nodal SVT during electrophysiologic testing until isoproterenol (0.5 to 3.0 micrograms/min) was infused. These patients were compared with 6 patients in the same age range (45 to 78 years, mean +/- standard error, 64 +/- 5) who had inducible AV nodal SVT without isoproterenol and who comprised group 2. In comparing group 1 (before isoproterenol) with group 2, there was no significant difference in the refractory periods of the anterograde slow and fast pathways, although the anterograde block cycle length was longer in group 1 patients (421 +/- 18 vs 362 +/- 14 ms, p less than 0.05). The retrograde block cycle length was also longer in 7 of the 8 group 1 (before isoproterenol) patients in whom it could be measured versus those in group 2 (411 +/- 14 vs 318 +/- 27 ms, p less than 0.05). During isoproterenol, the anterograde and retrograde block cycle lengths in group 1 were not different from group 2. Therefore, AV nodal SVT may not be inducible in some patients during routine electrophysiologic testing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "We performed a series of isotopic studies on the role of alpha- or beta-adrenergic activity in the regulation of glucose and protein metabolism in a group of surgical patients receiving total parenteral nutrition. We quantitated rates of glucose turnover and net protein breakdown by the primed constant infusion of 3H-glucose and 14C-urea, respectively. Basal measurements were first performed, and then the effect of either alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockade was assessed by means of the constant infusion of either phentolamine or propranolol. In addition, we assessed the effect of beta-stimulation by infusing the beta-agonist, salbutamol. The institution of alpha-adrenergic blockade did not significantly alter either the plasma glucose level or the rate of glucose production. However, the rate of net protein catabolism decreased significantly after alpha-adrenergic blockade. Before alpha-blockade the value for NPC was 0.88 +/- 0.27 gm/kg/day, and after alpha-blockade the corresponding value was 0.73 +/- 0.24 gm/kg/day (p less than 0.01). beta-Adrenergic blockade resulted in a decrease in the rate of glucose appearance from 38.2 +/- 6.1 mumol/kg/min to 35.1 +/- 5.7 mumol/kg/min, and the plasma glucose clearance increased from 5.0 +/- 0.8 ml/kg/min to 5.4 +/- 0.8 ml/kg/min. As a result of these changes the plasma glucose concentration decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) from 7.4 +/- 0.3 mumol/ml to 6.5 +/- 0.5 mumol/ml. beta-Adrenergic blockade did not significantly decrease the rate of net protein catabolism. beta-Stimulation with salbutamol resulted in a significant increase (p less than 0.05) in the rate of glucose production from 31.3 +/- 4.2 mumol/kg/min to 38.0 +/- 6.5 mumol/kg/min, and as a result the plasma glucose level increased significantly from 6.7 +/- 0.6 mumol/ml to 7.4 +/- 0.6 mumol/ml (p less than 0.04). We conclude from these studies that the role of the adrenergic nervous system in the promotion of endogenous glucose turnover in surgical patients receiving total parenteral nutrition is primarily a beta-adrenergic effect, whereas the promotion of protein catabolism is mainly an alpha-adrenergic effect.", 
    "18": "Thyroid hormone produces a prompt, plasma membrane-mediated increase in several metabolic functions in the rat thymocyte. These effects of thyroid hormone require calcium and are inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol. In the present study, the interrelationship between thyroid hormone and adrenergic agents, and the concept that calcium serves as the first messenger for the rapid action of thyroid hormone in the rat thymocyte are further examined. T3 produced a very rapid and dose-related increase in both 45 calcium accumulation and cytoplasmic free calcium concentration. These effects of T3, like its other calcium-dependent and prompt effects, were inhibited by beta-, but not by alpha-, adrenergic antagonists. Studies with selective beta-adrenergic agents revealed that the inhibitory effect was beta-1 in nature. In addition, beta-adrenergic agonists were found to promote additively T3 action, possibly through their beta-2 activity. Hence, the present study provides further support for the concept that calcium serves as the first messenger in the rapid, plasma membrane-mediated action of thyroid hormone in the rat thymocyte.", 
    "19": "A nonanemic chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient with nearly 500,000 lymphocytes/microL underwent leukapheresis when she presented with CNS symptoms and retinal vascular engorgement. Respiratory distress developed during the cell separator run, which led us to ask whether the procedure could have changed the adhesive properties of her cells. C5a desarginine, N-f-Met-Leu-Phe, adenosine diphosphate, and collagen all failed to aggregate her lymphocytes in vitro, but arachidonic acid, excess free calcium, and 4 mumol/L epinephrine did aggregate the cells. Arachidonate-induced aggregation appeared to be a toxic phenomenon: the ED50 for aggregation was statistically indistinguishable from that for cytotoxicity, and aspirin only mildly blunted the response. In contrast, epinephrine-induced aggregation was not associated with lactic dehydrogenase release or the loss of trypan blue exclusion and was blunted by propranolol; radiopindolol-binding studies confirmed the presence of a beta-adrenergic receptor. There were approximately 3,000 receptors/cell, with no statistically significant difference between normal and chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells or between B cells and T cells (separated by rosetting techniques). The Kd for the B cells' receptor, however, was less than that for T cells by a factor of ten (P less than .01). We conclude that B cells may aggregate when stimulated and that they--like T cells--have beta-adrenergic receptors. Adrenergically mediated changes in B cell adhesiveness may play a role in regulating lymphocyte traffic; in the rare patient with truly enormous B cell counts, we postulate that they may be an occasional cause of morbidity.", 
    "20": "We retrospectively identified 136 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) who were initially evaluated as outpatients. Twenty-seven of these patients met the following criteria for eligibility in the study: (1) roentgenographic documentation of an AAA larger than 3 cm, (2) at least two serial ultrasound size determinations over a minimum six-month interval, and (3) a documented medication history. Of these 27 patients, 12 received long-term beta-blockade, while 15 received no beta-blockade. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, initial aneurysm size, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and duration of follow-up (mean, 34 months). Among patients with beta-blockade, the mean growth rate was 0.17 cm/y. The rate for the controls was 0.44 cm/y. One patient of 12 (8%) in the beta-blocker group had a rate that exceeded the mean for the overall group compared with eight patients of 15 (53%) in the group with no beta-blockade. This difference was statistically significant. Thus, beta-blockade may be associated with a decreased AAA growth rate in this small, retrospective study.", 
    "21": "We have attempted to review the role of pharmacologic agents in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction for the purposes of limiting infarct size. At this time, the beta-blocking agents and nitroglycerin have been the most extensively studied in clinical trials and should be part of our overall pharmacologic approach to patients with acute myocardial infarction. Treatment, however, needs to be individualized, depending on the resources available within one's hospital and community. The early treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction is undergoing a revolution. Whereas a decade ago we were satisfied with simply monitoring patients for malignant arrhythmias, now we are aggressively attempting to limit infarct size and reperfuse myocardium. In all these proposed treatments for myocardial salvage, time is a crucial element. Therefore, emergency physicians and paramedics become a vital link to begin appropriate treatment leading to myocardial salvage and reperfusion. We must begin to think of all patients with symptoms of acute myocardial infarction as candidates for aggressive attempts at myocardial salvage. These attempts will only take place with well-coordinated, multidiscipline efforts involving cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, emergency physicians, paramedics, and critical care teams. Our challenge over the next few years will be to develop efficient systems so that all patients with acute myocardial infarction can receive optimal care.", 
    "22": "Most patients presenting to the Emergency Department with acute arrhythmias can be adequately treated with the available, conventional antiarrhythmics. Recent studies have taught us to use them with better understanding. In the future, several new antiarrhythmics look promising for use in the Emergency Department when given by the intravenous route; particularly, pirmenol, encainide, esmolol, amiodarone, sotalol, and magnesium. However, there have been few comparison studies between various antiarrhythmics, and experience must be gained for a full understanding of the benefits and risks of these agents.", 
    "23": "Open chest anesthetized dogs were given dopamine (DA) in intravenous (i.v., 2-16 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and intracoronary (i.c., 10-40 micrograms.min-1) infusions. The drug effect was analyzed using the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist oxprenolol (0.5 mg.kg, i.v.) and the nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1.0 mg.kg-1, i.v.). Coronary blood flow (CBF, electromagnetic flowmeter), arterial pressure and left ventricular contractile force (strain gauge) were measured. Coronary vascular responses were characterized by changes of CBF and calculated coronary vascular resistance (CVR). In the control state, DA-induced arterial hypertension (i.v. administration) and augmented inotropism (i.v. and i.c. administration) were accompanied by a dose-dependent coronary vasodilatation (increase of CBF and decrease of CVR). Oxprenolol converted coronary vasodilatation to vasoconstriction during DA infusions and blocked the inotropic action; the hypertensive DA effect remained unaffected. Similar alterations were observed after a transitory (45 min) regional myocardial ischemia, elicited by coronary occlusion. On the other hand, phentolamine-pretreatment potentiated the DA-induced coronary vasodilatation and converted hypertension to hypotension; the inotropic component of the DA action was not affected. After combined beta- and alpha-blockade, DA failed to increase CBF and decrease CVR during the infusion periods. Instead, the drug elicited a very slight coronary vasoconstriction. I.c. (but not i.v.) infusions of DA were regularly followed by a rebound-like, transient CBF increase, even after combined beta- and alpha-blockade. These results show that all of the multifactorial determinants of the direct, steady state coronary effects of DA can be ascribed to alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, whereas the hypothetical dopaminergic coronary vascular receptors do not seem to play a decisive role in these responses. However, undefined after-effects provoked by i.c. DA, may be connected with specific dopaminergic effects.", 
    "24": "We studied the mechanisms of pindolol-induced vasoconstrictions in isolated and perfused monkey coronary arteries. Phentolamine marginally reduced the vasoconstrictions, but bunazosin and DG 5128 did not. Diltiazem and methysergide significantly inhibited them, but atropine, diphenhydramine and cimetidine did not. Diltiazem significantly suppressed KCl-induced vasoconstrictions, but methysergide did not. These results suggest that pindolol-induced vasoconstrictions of monkey coronary arteries are mediated, at least partly, through 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, but not through alpha-adrenoceptors, and that these vasoconstrictions appear to be associated with an increase of Ca2+ entry into the smooth muscle cell.", 
    "25": "Age-related changes in beta-adrenergic receptor density in Fischer 344 rat brain were examined using in vitro 125I-pindolol (IPIN) binding and quantitative autoradiographic analysis. Localized protein concentrations were determined using a new quantitative histological technique, and these were used to normalize the densities of receptors. Saturation binding studies in brain sections revealed 40-50% decreases in beta-adrenergic receptor density in the thalamus of 23-25-month-old and the cerebellum and brainstem of both 18-19-month-old and 23-25-month-old compared to 4-6-month-old rats. The loss of cerebellar beta-adrenergic receptors may be correlated with reports of deficits in sensitivity to beta-adrenergic-mediated transmission in the cerebellum of aged rats. No changes in specific IPIN binding with age were observed in rat cortex or hippocampus. In all areas examined no age-related differences were observed in receptor affinity. No changes in protein concentration were found in any of the areas examined in the different aged animals. These results demonstrate a region-specific loss of beta-adrenergic receptors with age in the brain of Fischer 344 rats.",

The potency order was isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline, adrenaline with an ED50 for all three agonists within the range 1-5 x 10(-8) M. A dose-dependent increase in medium content of cyclic AMP was also observed. Secretion of cortisol in response to these catecholamines was specifically blocked by propranolol but unaffected by phentolamine. The beta-agonist effect on cortisol secretion was specifically and progressively reduced, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, by pre-incubation of the cells with adrenaline.", 
    "27": "The fluorescent 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazolyl (NBD) derivatives of alprenolol and pindolol bind irreversible to beta-adrenoceptors and non-receptor binding sites. This was established in functional experiments on the guinea pig right atrium and trachea smooth muscle, and by radioligand binding assay of beta-adrenoceptors on Chang liver cells in culture. The pD2'-values of alprenolol-NBD and pindolol-NBD for the beta-adrenoceptors on the right atrium were: 8.3 +/- 0.1 and 8.5 +/- 0.1; on the tracheal smooth muscle strip: 8.2 +/- 0.1 and 8.8 +/- 0.1; and its pKd on Chang liver cells: 8.5 +/- 0.1 and 8.9 +/- 0.1 respectively. The results indicated that no selectivity for the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes was introduced by the addition of NBD. The irreversible binding characteristic to beta-adrenoceptors and non-receptor binding sites of the fluorescent NBD derivatives of alprenolol and pindolol makes these drugs unsuitable to label beta-adrenoceptors specifically. As the irreversible binding is introduced by the coupling of the drug with NBD, it is concluded that NBD derivatives of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are not suitable to visualize the two-dimensional motion of beta-adrenoceptors during challenge with agonists.", 
    "28": "The activity of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, prenalterol, at beta adrenoceptors in the cerebral cortex of the rat and the effect of chronic intraperitoneal infusion of prenalterol on the biochemical responsiveness and density of cerebral cortical beta adrenoceptors was studied. Whereas isoproterenol caused a four-fold rise in the content of cyclic AMP in slices of cerebral cortex, prenalterol did not produce a significant increase in cyclic AMP. However, prenalterol inhibited the isoproterenol-stimulated increase in cyclic AMP in cortical slices in a concentration-dependent manner. Using an in vivo binding technique, prenalterol (3.8 mg/kg/hr) infused intraperitoneally through osmotic minipumps, penetrated the brain and significantly inhibited the binding of the beta adrenoceptor antagonist, [125I]iodopindolol (125I-IPIN), to cortical beta adrenoceptors. Infusion of prenalterol (3.8 mg/kg/hr) for 7 days resulted in a small (20%), but significant, reduction in the ability of isoproterenol to stimulate maximally the accumulation of cyclic AMP in slices of cerebral cortex. No alteration in the Bmax or KD of the binding of [125I]iodopindolol was observed in homogenates of cortex obtained from prenalterol-treated rats. Furthermore, no change was observed in the binding of the hydrophilic ligand [3H]CGP-12177 in homogenates of cortex. In this study, then, prenalterol exhibited properties in vitro of a beta adrenoceptor antagonist, but did cause modest desensitization of beta adrenoceptor responsiveness when administered continuously in vivo.", 
    "29": "A new conscious animal model for evaluating leukotriene antagonists is described. The model consists of monitoring the change in the respiratory pattern induced by aerosol administration of various airway constrictors in six guinea pigs secured in a plexiglass chamber by a neck yoke. The animals are pretreated with indomethacin (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and propranolol (5 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min prior to the challenge. After a 30-min stabilization period, the animals are challenged by various agonists delivered via a Monaghan ultrasonic nebulizer at a flow rate of 2.0 L/min for 5 min. The end point is defined as the onset of slow, labored abdominal breathing (dyspnea) measured in seconds. Peptide leukotrienes (LTs) (30 nM-60 microM) produced concentration-related decreases in time to dyspnea with a rank order of potency of LTD4 greater than LTC4 greater than LTE4. LTD4 was 1,000-fold more potent than histamine or carbachol. Pretreatment of the animals with either FPL55712 or LY171883 delayed the time to reach dyspnea induced by LTD4. In contrast, pyrilamine, cyproheptadine, and phenoxybenzamine failed to alter LTD4-induced dyspnea. The results indicate that this model is useful in assessing the efficacy of LT receptor antagonists in vivo.", 
    "30": "Signal-response coupling was studied in an exocrine female accessory sex gland (albumen gland) of the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Glands were incubated in vitro with Calfluxin (CaFl), a neuropeptide which stimulates the influx of Ca2+ into the mitochondria of the secretory cells. This influx, which is considered to reflect an increase of Ca2+ in the cytosol, was measured as the percentage mitochondria containing Ca deposits. Ca deposits. Ca deposits were visualized at the ultrastructural level with the pyroantimonate precipitation technique. The origin of the Ca2+ and the mechanism by which the Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol is elevated were investigated. The results indicate that CaFl stimulates the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and mobilizes intracellular Ca2+. The increase of the percentage of mitochondria containing Ca deposits is sensitive to Ca2+ channel blockers (D600, Co2+, La3+), indicating that Ca2+ channels are involved. Li+ ions suppress the CaFl response, which suggests that the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and thus the production of myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) is involved in the Ca2+ mobilization. The protein kinase-C (PKC) stimulator 4-beta-phorbol 12-beta-myrastate 13-alpha-acetate (PMA) mimicked the response to CaFl. The PKC inhibitors trifluoperazine (TFP) and chlorpromazine (CP) markedly decreased the CaFl-stimulated influx of Ca2+ into the mitochondria. The PMA-stimulated influx of Ca2+ into the mitochondria is not dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and is not sensitive to Ca2+ channel blockers. In PMA-stimulated glands, the Na+/H+ exchange blocker amiloride completely abolished the Ca2+ influx into mitochondria. In CaFl-stimulated glands the influx was partly blocked. Increasing the internal pH of the glandular cells with the Na+/H+ ionophore monensin or with NH4Cl mimicked the CaFl response. It is proposed that upon stimulation with CaFl, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ is mediated via the PKC-stimulated activation of the Na+/H+ exchange, thus leading to an increase of the internal pH. The role of IP3 in the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ is uncertain.", 
    "31": "The infusion of a solution containing triiodothyronine, amino acids, glucagon, and heparin (TAGH solution) triggered rat liver cell proliferation. It also induced a transient prereplicative surge of cytosolic calmodulin (between 6 and 20 hr postinfusion) similar to that observed in liver cells proliferatively activated by partial hepatectomy. The injection of the beta-adrenergic blocker dl-propanolol (20 mg/kg of body weight) at the time of the infusion prevented this transient rise of cytosolic calmodulin and also inhibited the early prereplicative surge of total liver cyclic AMP, which usually occurred between 1 and 4 hr after infusion. Propanolol also inhibited the early prereplicative surge of cyclic AMP and the increase of calmodulin in liver cells proliferatively activated by partial hepatectomy. The infusion of a solution containing cyclic AMP (5 mumoles) and theophylline (10 mg) into normal rats produced an increase of cytosolic calmodulin similar to that observed after infusion of TAGH solution or after partial hepatectomy. Thus it seems that the prereplicative rise of cytosolic calmodulin observed in proliferatively activated liver cells may be regulated by the early prereplicative surge of cyclic AMP.", 
    "32": "To supplement previous demonstration of angiotensin II and alpha-adrenergic binding sites, beta-adrenergic binding sites for dihydroalprenolol were demonstrated in vessel-free bovine neural retina (Kd = 2.5 nM) and bovine retinal vessels (Kd = 2.8 nM). By means of competition of 3H-dihydroalprenolol with betaxolol and ICI 118,551, approximately equal proportions of Beta 1 and Beta 2 subtypes were found in both the retinal vessels and the neural retina. Further studies are needed to determine the microanatomic location of the binding sites and the physiologic responses, if any, they mediate.", 
    "33": "Effects of 5-[2-[(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxypropylthio)-4-thiazolyl]-2- thiophenecarboxamide hydrochloride (arotinolol, S-596) on hemodynamic and adrenergically induced renin release and renal vasoconstriction were investigated in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs. Arotinolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) decreased systemic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR) and renin secretion rate without change in renal blood flow. Degree of hypotension induced by arotinolol and basal plasma renin activity prior to the injection of the drug showed significant correlation. Arotinolol (20 micrograms/min) produced significant suppression of renal nerve stimulation (RNS)-induced renin release and attenuated an increase in renal vascular resistance during RNS at 3 Hz. The same extent of inhibition in the renin secretion response to RNS was also obtained during the infusion of dl-propranolol (100 micrograms/min). The renal vasoconstriction induced by RNS and norepinephrine (NE) was inhibited dose-dependently during the infusion of arotinolol (10, 30 and 100 micrograms/min), phentolamine (3, 10 and 30 micrograms/min) or prazosin (1, 3 and 10 micrograms/min). Arotinolol and prazosin exerted a greater inhibitory effect on RNS- than NE-induced vasoconstriction, and the opposite was true of phentolamine. Arotinolol dose-dependently decreased SBP and HR in a dose range of 0.01 to 3.0 mg/kg. The greater reduction in HR was observed with arotinolol at a lower dose range (0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg) than with propranolol. Arotinolol produced larger reduction of SBP, and less increase in carotid, vertebral, renal and external iliac vascular resistances than propranolol. These results suggest that arotinolol posesses a- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties, which effectively contribute to the suppression of the adrenergically induced renin release and renal vasoconstriction, and to the hypotensive effect.", 
    "34": "To determine the influence of thyroid hormone on beta-adrenoceptors and Ca2+ channels, rats were treated with thyroxine (75 micrograms/100 g sc daily for 5 days) or propylthiouracil (0.05% in drinking water for 30 days). beta-Adrenoceptor density in ventricular tissue, measured by [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding, was significantly increased and decreased respectively, following thyroxine or propylthiouracil treatment to 124.7 +/- 7.11 fmol/mg protein and 71.98 +/- 5.37 fmol/mg protein from euthyroid (control) levels of 93.7 +/- 4.58 fmol/mg protein. Ca2+ channel density, measured by [3H]nitrendipine binding, was altered in the opposite direction; it was significantly decreased and increased to 324 +/- 24 fmol/mg protein and 691 +/- 31 fmol/mg protein from 562 +/- 35 fmol/mg protein after thyroxine or propylthiouracil treatment, respectively. No changes in affinity of either ligand were observed. Responses of isolated papillary muscles from propylthiouracil-treated animals accorded with changes seen in the binding studies. The geometric mean EC50 of isoproterenol increased from 9.5 x 10(-9) mol/l to 5.5 x 10(-8) mol/l, and the EC50 for calcium decreased from 3.16 x 10(-3) mol/l to 1.36 x 10(-3) mol/l; moreover, the responsiveness to the Ca2+ channel activator Bay K 8644 was increased. The corresponding responses in thyroxine-treated animals could not be examined because of prominent arrhythmic activity. As with papillary muscles the sensitivity of left atria to isoproterenol was decreased after treatment with propylthiouracil, with geometric mean EC50 values increasing from 3.21 x 10(-9) mol/l to 89.4 x 10(-9) mol/l.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "Cellular DNA and protein content were determined simultaneously in freshly isolated fibroblast-like rat cells by flow cytometry. After exposure to doxorubicin, nitrofurantoin, propranolol and practolol at a low, tissue like oxygen concentration (5% O2), drug-induced alterations in cell cycle kinetics, in the distribution of DNA and in the protein content of G1-phase cells (nucleus/cytoplasm ratio) were analysed. Optimal exposure time (5 or 24 h) and recovery interval (24 or 48 h) were determined. Variation in the exposure time and recovery period can affect cell cycle kinetics both qualitatively and quantitatively, whereas the distribution of DNA and protein content are affected quantitatively only. A 24-h exposure combined with a 24-h recovery period proved to be the most efficient approach. Each of the tested chemicals induced a specific, dose-dependent pattern of altered cellular DNA and protein content. Comparison with results obtained in other genotoxicity tests, and with data reported earlier, showed that this two-parameter protocol can be used to recognize and to characterize chemicals as clastogens, or as compounds with a combined cytostatic/clastogenic activity, or as spindle-poison-like compounds.", 
    "36": "The effects of isoproterenol, atropine, and metoprolol on atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction were studied in 30 normal dogs under pentobarbital anesthesia using percutaneously introduced catheters. The inducibility of AV junctional reentry was also assessed before and after drug administration. Resting AV conduction was normal in all dogs, but VA conduction was present in only 57%. Isoproterenol facilitated both antegrade and retrograde conduction, with a preferential effect on retrograde conduction. VA conduction was demonstrated after isoproterenol in 91% of dogs. After testing all drugs, VA conduction was demonstrable in at least one study in 97% of dogs. Atropine had less effect than isoproterenol, suggesting that basal vagal tone was not high in this model. Dual AV nodal pathways were detectable in the antegrade direction in four (13%) dogs, and in the retrograde direction in an additional four (13%) dogs. Single AV junctional echoes were inducible with atrial stimulation in one dog with dual antegrade pathways, but were inducible with ventricular stimulation in at least one study in 83% of dogs with intact retrograde conduction. Sustained AV junctional reentry was never induced before or after drug administration. In conclusion, VA electrical continuity is almost always intact in the normal dog, but its demonstration is significantly modified by the autonomic nervous system. Isoproterenol has preferential effects on retrograde conduction and may have selective influence on distal AV nodal conduction. Twenty-six percent of normal dogs have evidence of dual AV nodal pathways. Single AV junctional echoes are inducible with ventricular stimulation in the majority of dogs and are a normal finding. Sustained AV junctional reentry is not inducible in the normal intact dog heart.", 
    "37": "Although percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is a widely accepted form of therapy for coronary artery disease, there is a 30% restenosis rate associated with it. The pathobiological processes that are triggered following coronary angioplasty are related to platelet-vessel wall interactions, coagulation, endothelial injury and smooth muscle cell modulation and proliferation. These events are reviewed with respect to the role of platelets and the products they release at the site of endothelial injury. Various families of antiplatelet drugs are discussed with regard to the rationale for their use and the results reported in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The major conclusion is that a variety of processes are likely to be responsible for restenosis. Acetylsalicylic acid has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular disease conditions associated with thrombosis and may effect reductions in restenosis through its inhibition of this process. Current pharmacologic regimens do not significantly reduce the incidence of smooth muscle cell proliferation, an important feature of long term stenosis. The role of new, more specific antiplatelet drugs as well as innovations in instrumental technology may hold future promise in reducing rates of restenosis.", 
    "38": "The effects of bPTH-(1-34), a synthetic preparation of bovine parathyroid hormone containing the first 34 amino acids, on electromechanical activity of isolated rabbit sinus node cells and guinea pig papillary muscles were examined by microelectrode techniques. In sinus node cells, bPTH-(1-34) (10(-7) M) decreased the cycle length of spontaneous firing (SPCL) accompanied by an increase in the maximum upstroke velocity at phase 0 (dV/dtmax) without affecting the amplitude of the action potential (APA) or the maximum diastolic potential (MDP). All the effects of bPTH-(1-34) on sinus node cells were abolished by verapamil (5 X 10(-7) M), but not by pindolol (2 X 10(-7) M). In constantly driven guinea pig papillary muscles, bPTH-(1-34) caused a positive inotropic effect (+31%). The parameters of the action potential were not significantly affected. This inotropic effect of bPTH-(1-34) was inhibited by pretreatment with verapamil or a low calcium medium (0.12 mM), but was not affected by pindolol. In contrast, ryanodine (2 X 10(-6) M), an inhibitor of internal Ca2+ release, which decreased the contraction with a prolongation of the action potential duration augmented the inotropic effect of bPTH-(1-34). In papillary muscles depolarized by 26 mM [K+]O, bPTH-(1-34) enhanced the slow action potential. In voltage clamp experiments using a single sucrose-gap method, bPTH-(1-34) caused an increase in the peak amplitude of the slow inward current, while it did not affect the outward current.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) during treadmill exercise was studied in 9 healthy volunteers. Plasma ANP levels increased during exercise. The mean plasma ANP concentration on 12-min exercise (32.5 +/- 3.7 pg/ml, mean +/- SEM) was significantly higher than the control (16.7 +/- 1.0 pg/ml). After exercise, the levels decreased and the mean plasma ANP concentrations in the recovery period were higher in subjects in the sitting position than in subjects who kept standing. Prior administration of a long-acting propranolol, 160 mg daily for 3 consecutive days, augmented ANP release during exercise. The mean plasma ANP concentrations on 9- and 12-min exercise (34.5 +/- 3.1 and 64.9 +/- 15.0 pg/ml, respectively) were significantly higher than those in the corresponding exercise stage without propranolol. Plasma ANP levels in the recovery period also increased after the administration of propranolol and the subjects in the sitting position again had higher plasma levels than those in the standing position. These results suggest that increased central blood volume during exercise elevates atrial pressure to stimulate ANP secretion, and that greater atrial distension and pressure due to reduced ventricular contractility by beta-adrenergic blockade facilitates ANP release to a greater extent.", 
    "40": "The pharmacological profile of nebivolol (N), a chemically novel beta-adrenergic antagonist, was assessed in investigations on isolated tissues, awake spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), closed-chest anesthetized dogs, and humans. In vitro, N was found to be a potent antagonist of beta 1-adrenergic receptors (A2 value, 5.8 X 10(-9) M) and only a weak beta 2-adrenergic antagonist (A2 value, 1.7 X 10(-6) M). The selectivity for the beta 1-adrenergic receptor was higher for N than for any of the reference compounds. In dogs--similarly with atenolol--N was more potent in blocking the isoprenaline (I)-induced increases in left ventricular performance than the I-induced decrease in arterial pressure. In dogs, as compared with propranolol, N (0.025 and 0.01 mg.kg-1 i.v.) increased cardiac output and stroke volume, lowered systemic vascular resistance, and had no significant effect on the variables related to left ventricular contraction. In contrast to other beta-adrenergic antagonists, N acutely lowered arterial blood pressure in SHR (1.25 mg.kg-1 i.p.) and in hypertensive patients (1 oral dose of 5 mg) for several hours. In healthy volunteers N (5 mg) lowered systemic vascular resistance during daily oral treatment and did not negatively affect left ventricular function. In conclusion, N is a potent and selective beta 1-adrenergic blocking agent with an interesting hemodynamic profile. In hypertensive subjects and SHR, a single dose lowers arterial blood pressure for substantial periods of time.", 
    "41": "The selectivity of single oral doses of xamoterol, 200 mg, prenalterol, 50 mg, and salbutamol, 8 mg, was compared in eight healthy male volunteers by measuring their effects on sleeping heart rate, supine heart rate, blood pressure, forearm blood flow, finger tremor, and exercise heart rate in the presence and absence of the specific beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551, 25 mg. Xamoterol, 200 mg, increased sleeping heart rate and systolic blood pressure, decreased exercise heart rate, and had no effect on diastolic blood pressure, forearm blood flow, or finger tremor. The concurrent administration of ICI 118,551, 25 mg, did not alter these results. Supine heart rate was increased by xamoterol and did not differ from that for xamoterol with ICI 118,551. Prenalterol, 50 mg, increased sleeping heart rate, supine heart rate, systolic blood pressure, forearm blood flow, and finger tremor, decreased diastolic blood pressure, and had no effect on exercise tachycardia. The concurrent administration of ICI 118,551 with prenalterol reduced the increase in sleeping heart rate, supine heart rate, and forearm blood flow, and reduced the fall in diastolic blood pressure caused by prenalterol alone. The increase in finger tremor following prenalterol with ICI 118,551 tended to be less than that following prenalterol. Salbutamol, 8 mg, increased sleeping heart rate, supine heart rate, systolic blood pressure, forearm blood flow, finger tremor, and exercise heart rate, and caused a fall in diastolic blood pressure. When salbutamol, 8 mg, was administered with ICI 118,551, 25 mg, the only changes detected were a small initial increase in finger tremor and a small rise in diastolic blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "The effects of somatostatin on lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation were investigated in rats pretreated with haloperidol, bicuculline, phenoxybenzamine or propranolol. Somatostatin decreased the rate of self-stimulation. Halperidol, bicuculline and phenoxybenzamine potentiated the somatostatin-induced depression of self-stimulation behaviour. Propranolol had no effect. It is suggested that dopaminergic, GABAergic and noradrenergic systems are involved in the somatostatin-induced depression of self-stimulation.", 
    "43": "A new quantitative staining technique for the assay of protein in tissue sections using the dye Coomassie brilliant blue G 250 is discussed. This densitometric procedure uses commercially available hardware and software employed in the quantitation of receptor autoradiographs. Rather than assuming a homogeneous distribution of protein in the tissue section, regional levels of protein are measured in the same tissue slice used to produce the autoradiograph. Additionally, the process of staining tissue with Coomassie blue for protein is reversible; the tissue can be destained after the measurement of protein is complete and then restained with a standard histological stain such as Cresyl violet. This technique is a more reliable method for normalizing receptor densities by tissue protein levels and allows for a more accurate comparison between QAR and membrane binding techniques.", 
    "44": "In a large randomised trial of early beta-blockade in acute myocardial infarction (ISIS-1), almost all the reduction in mortality associated with the use of atenolol occurred on the day of admission or on the subsequent day. To help determine the mechanisms that might be responsible for this retrospective observation, case notes were obtained for British, Irish, and Scandinavian patients who died during this early period. Of 217 early deaths adequate records were available for 193 (79 allocated atenolol and 114 allocated control). In the atenolol group, necropsy had shown cardiac rupture in 5 patients, and a further 15 in whom necropsy had not been done had had electro-mechanical dissociation (total, 20 early deaths from these causes); among control patients the corresponding numbers were 17 and 37 (total, 54 such deaths). Electro-mechanical dissociation was probably a manifestation of acute rupture, and the observed difference in the numbers with this complication was responsible for much of the difference in early mortality. There was a slightly higher incidence of fatal ventricular fibrillation and aortic dissection in the control group, and of bradycardia/asystole in the atenolol group. The data did not indicate any substantial contribution from mechanisms such as limitation of infarct size or prevention of reinfarction or cardiac arrest.", 
    "45": "We studied seven cases of severe gram-negative microbial keratitis associated with the use of contaminated topical ocular medications. Five cases involved Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one involved Serratia marcescens, and one involved Proteus mirabilis. In each case the same organism was cultured from corneal scrapings and from the medication. Either prednisolone acetate (one case) or timolol maleate (seven cases) was implicated in all instances.", 
    "46": "Reduction of elevated blood pressure is effective in reducing morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease in general. Striking decreases in stroke, congestive heart failure, and renal impairment have been observed when blood pressure is reduced. However, the ability of traditional, diuretic-first, stepped-care therapeutic algorithms to reduce the occurrence of myocardial infarction or angina has been exceedingly difficult to demonstrate. An increased frequency of sudden death among hypertensive men with electrocardiographic abnormalities has been observed in some diuretic-based treatment trials. The failure of conventional therapy to reduce coronary artery disease and death has forced a re-appraisal of antihypertensive treatment. The risk factors for coronary disease are reviewed in detail with an emphasis on the impact of various classes of antihypertensive drugs on these factors. The emergence of effective antihypertensive agents that lower blood pressure without adversely affecting cardiovascular risk factors provides a new opportunity to further extend the benefit of treatment by reducing such risk.", 
    "47": "Chemotherapy of liver metastases is dependent on adequacy of tumor microcirculation. Attempts have been made, experimentally, to improve tumor blood flow with appropriate vasoactive agents. Capillary blood flow within intrahepatic Walker carcinosarcomas and normal liver were measured with a laser doppler needle probe. Tumor capillary blood flow increased briefly but significantly with intraportally administered epinephrine. This effect was blocked by phenoxybenzamine but not by propranolol. The response of capillary flow in normal liver to epinephrine was dose related, with decreased flow with higher doses, and slight increase with lower doses. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine produced brief increases in capillary flow in tumor and liver, and isoproterenol caused a decreased flow. In studies with injected silicone rubber (Microfil, Canton Bio-Medical Products, Boulder, CO) performed previously, and on electron microscopic examination, there was evidence of increased vascular filling within central areas of tumors after epinephrine. These studies suggest that the brief but potent effect of epinephrine on tumor capillary flow could be useful in improving delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to liver tumors.", 
    "48": "Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus arises from toxic side-effects of administration of hydralazine, isoniazid, procainamide and practolol. Hydralazine and isoniazid are nucleophilic drugs and inhibit the covalent binding reaction of complement components, C3 and C4, an effect likely to lead to deposition of immune complexes (a feature of systemic lupus erythematosus). Procainamide and practolol do not themselves inhibit C3 and C4. A range of metabolites and putative metabolites of procainamide and practolol were synthesized, and tested for their ability to inhibit the covalent binding reactions of C3 and C4. The highly nucleophilic hydroxylamine metabolite of procainamide was strongly inhibitory in both tests, as was a putative hydroxylamine metabolite of practolol. These studies indicate a potential role for the hydroxylamine metabolites in mediating the toxic side-effects of procainamide and practolol, and emphasize the need for adequate measurements of hydroxylamine metabolites in human tissue.", 
    "49": "Infusion of a phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), known to stimulate protein kinase C, caused a gradual, sustained increase in perfusate immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (IR-ANP) concentration and a more rapid increase in perfusion pressure in the isolated perfused rat heart. Administration of isoprenaline resulted in a rapid rise in IR-ANP release whereas methoxamine induced a sustained increase in IR-ANP secretion into the perfusion fluid. Methoxamine, when infused in combination with TPA, enhanced both IR-ANP secretion and the increase in perfusion pressure produced by phorbol ester. Isoprenaline also acted synergistically on TPA-induced IR-ANP release but attenuated the coronary vasoconstriction produced by phorbol ester. The TPA-induced increase in IR-ANP secretion was attenuated significantly by infusion of atenolol and slightly by infusion of prazosin, neither of which affected TPA-induced vasoconstriction. The vasoconstrictor response to infusion of phorbol ester was similar but the secretory response was attenuated in hearts from rats pretreated with reserpine. The results indicate that adrenoceptor stimulation interacts differentially with phorbol ester-induced ANP secretion and vasoconstriction in the perfused rat heart. Our results also suggest that the effect of TPA on perfusion pressure appears to be due to its direct action on vascular smooth muscle cells but that a part of the TPA effect on ANP secretion may be an indirect one.", 
    "50": "Intracellular recordings were made from neurons in bullfrog sympathetic ganglia. Orthodromic, intracellular and antidromic stimulations evoked recurrent depolarizing responses accompanied by a spontaneous firing of the action potential in type 2 neurons. The depolarizing response elicited by intracellular and antidromic stimulations was selectively blocked by propranolol (1 microM), but not by yohimbine and phenoxybenzamine. Propranolol did not block the 'nicotinic' fast excitatory postsynaptic potential evoked by orthodromic stimulation. These results suggest that excitatory beta-adrenoceptors mediate the recurrent synaptic facilitation of nicotinic transmission in type 2 neurons of bullfrog sympathetic ganglia.", 
    "51": "Rats (220-250 g) were bilaterally implanted with cannulae in the amygdala, trained on an inhibitory avoidance response and two weeks later, on a Y-maze discrimination response. Immediately following the training on each task, they were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) or intra-amygdally. Retention was tested one week after training for each task. Retention of the Y-maze task was assessed by discrimination reversal training. Naloxone administered i.p. (3.0 mg/kg) significantly facilitated retention of both tasks in unoperated control rats as well as in rats implanted bilaterally with amygdala cannulae. The memory-enhancing effect of naloxone i.p. was blocked by propranolol (0.3 or 1.0 microgram) injected in the amygdala, but not when this beta-noradrenergic antagonist was injected (0.3 micrograms) into either the caudate or the cortex dorsal to the amygdala. Further, intra-amygdala injections of the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol (0.3 or 1.0 microgram) and the beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker zinterol (0.3 or 1.0 microgram), in doses which were ineffective when administered alone, blocked naloxone-induced (3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) memory facilitation. In contrast, posttraining intra-amygdala administration (1.0 micrograms) of the alpha-antagonists prazosin (alpha 1) or yohimbine (alpha 2) did not attenuate the memory-enhancing effects of systemically administered naloxone. These findings support the view that naloxone-induced enhancement of memory is mediated by the activation of beta- but not alpha-noradrenergic receptors located within the amygdaloid complex.", 
    "52": "Peptide YY (PYY) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) are peptides of 36 amino acids that share structural homologies with pancreatic polypeptide (PP). PP is predominantly found in the endocrine pancreas. PPY is primarily found in mucosal endocrine cells of the distal ileum, colon, and rectum, whereas NPY is found in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Previous studies indicate that these peptides can interact with the autonomic nervous system. The objective of the present experiments was to study the effect of PYY on neurally stimulated insulin release [i.e., in response to 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a nonmetabolizable glucose analogue] in conscious dogs. Intravenous administration of PYY (100, 200, and 400 pmol.kg-1.h-1) reduced 2-DG-stimulated insulin release in a dose-dependent manner (P less than 0.05) without affecting plasma glucose levels. Administration of NPY (800 pmol.kg-1.h-1), but not PP (400 pmol.kg-1.h-1), reduced 2-DG-stimulated release of insulin (P less than 0.05). The inhibitory action of PYY on 2-DG-stimulated insulin release persisted in the presence of atropine or phentolamine treatment; however, hexamethonium alone or phentolamine plus propranolol treatment blocked the inhibitory action of PYY. Release of insulin stimulated by the beta-agonist isoproterenol was also inhibited by PYY (P less than 0.05). These results indicate that PYY can inhibit autonomic neurotransmission by a mechanism that may involve ganglionic or postganglionic inhibition of beta-adrenergic stimulation. Our findings suggest a role for PYY and NPY in the autonomic regulation of insulin release.", 
    "53": "Using quantitative biplane coronary arteriography, coronary vasomotion of normal and stenotic coronary artery segments was studied at rest and during supine bicycle exercise in 37 patients with coronary artery disease. Normal coronary arteries showed vasodilation during exercise, whereas stenotic arteries exhibited vasoconstriction. The occurrence of coronary stenosis narrowing during exercise can be explained either by a collapse of the free vessel wall due to an increase in coronary blood flow velocity (Venturi mechanism) or by insufficient production of the endothelium-derived vasorelaxing factor (endogenous nitrate). To explore further the nature of exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenotic coronary arteries, intracoronary nitroglycerin, diltiazem or propranolol was given to a subgroup of patients prior to the exercise test. Administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin or diltiazem prevented exercise-induced vasoconstriction, probably due to the direct vasorelaxing effect of the drug on the smooth vasculature. Intracoronary administration of propranolol also prevented exercise-induced vasoconstriction, either due to a reduction in trans-stenotic pressure gradient (local beta blockade with a decrease in local coronary blood flow or an increase in distal arteriolar tone due to unopposed alpha-constrictor tone) or because of a local anesthetic effect of propranolol with a decrease in calcium influx into the smooth vasculature.", 
    "54": "The effectiveness of oral propranolol and sclerotherapy in preventing recurrent bleeding after an endoscopically proven haemorrhage from oesophageal varices was compared in Pugh's grade B and C patients divided into two successive therapeutic groups. Group I patients (n = 32) were given oral propranolol, while sclerotherapy was performed in group II patients (n = 32), 23 of whom simultaneously received propranolol. There was no difference between groups I and II in the severity of the initial bleeding and liver failure (Groups I/II, B 19/18, C 13/14), in the withdrawal of alcohol (group I 25, group II 17) and in compliance with either treatment (group I 25, group II 27). Obliteration of the oesophageal varices was achieved in 69 p. 100 of group II patients within a median number of 4 courses and 46 days, and in 84 p. 100 of the patients of this group who survived for more than 3 months. One year after the beginning of treatment rebleeding had occurred in 43 p. 100 of either group I or group II patients. The 1-year survival rate was 72 p. 100 in group I and 62 p. 100 in group II (non significant). The causes of death were the same in both groups. Irrespective of the treatment assigned, death was 2.1 times more frequent (P = 0.02) and rebleeding was 1.2 time more frequent (P = 0.08) in grade C than in grade B patients.", 
    "55": "The diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of ACE inhibitors in patients with various forms of hypertension are discussed. The immediate blood pressure reduction after administration of an ACE inhibitor is significantly more marked in patients with renovascular than with essential hypertension. However, analysis of the individual blood pressure response after captopril does not allow a clear distinction between these two forms of hypertension. In patients with moderate hypertension the reduction of blood pressure with ACE inhibitors is similar to that with betablockers. Their use as a first step agent in moderate hypertension, however, is limited to selected patients. In severe drug-resistant hypertension treatment with ACE inhibitors is well established. Cases with renovascular hypertension may suffer a deterioration of renal function under ACE inhibitors. Other side effects are uncommon where renal function is normal or where the dose is adapted to the decreased glomerular filtration rate.", 
    "56": "3,5,3'-Triiodothyronine (T3) produced a rapid and transient increase in 45Ca uptake and cytoplasmic free calcium concentration in rat thymocytes, which is the most rapid effect of T3 in this system. This effect was manifested in cells suspended in medium containing 1 mM calcium. The T3 effect on 45Ca uptake was evident at 15-30 s, reached maximum at 30-60 s, and returned to control values at 5 min. The T3 effect on cytoplasmic free calcium concentration was seen after 30 s, reached maximum at 7 min, and returned to control values after 24 min. In cells suspended in Ca2+-free medium, T3 produced a similar rapid increase in 45Ca uptake, which was sustained for at least 60 min, but T3 failed to change cytoplasmic free calcium concentration. Alprenolol (10 microM) blocked the stimulatory effects of T3 on these two functions in a similar fashion. From these results, I suggest that in rat thymocytes T3 influences cellular calcium economy through a biphasic mechanism in which T3 first increases calcium uptake which, in turn, is followed by a release of calcium from intracellular pool(s), resulting in a further increase in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration and the activation of Ca2+ -regulated systems. Moreover, the present study provides further support for the postulate that in the rat thymocyte calcium serves as the first messenger for the plasma membrane-mediated stimulatory effects of T3 on several metabolic functions.", 
    "57": "alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptor properties of intact hepatocytes from adult male and female rats were evaluated in ligand binding studies using [3H]prazosin and [3H]CGP-12177 (4-(t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-[5,7-3H]benzimidazole-2-one-HCl), a hydrophilic beta antagonist. Prior work had suggested that the response of hepatocytes from males to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation was greater than that of cells from females. However, little sexual difference in prazosin affinity, number of binding sites or kinetics of association/dissociation with the cells was found. Epinephrine, [3H]prazosin competition for binding sites on intact cells was performed at 2 degrees C and 80-90% of agonist sites remained in a high affinity state with an epinephrine Kd comparable to that previously found in glucose release and phosphorylase alpha activation studies. Agonist Kd inferred from these competition experiments also showed no sexual dimorphism. These data suggest that the greater rise in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium and release of 45Ca from cells of males in response to epinephrine stimulation is not due to male/female alpha 1-receptor differences but, rather, may be a function of the previously observed sexual difference in cell calcium metabolism. [3H]CGP binding to hepatocytes from females was stereospecific, saturable and identified a single, high affinity site. Comparable sites were not found on cells from males, however, [3H]CGP binding to crude membrane preparations from both sexes was identical. This suggests that the loss of hepatic beta-receptor function in the adult male is due to an inaccessibility of beta-receptors at the external surface of the plasma membrane of the intact cell. Further studies with other beta-receptor ligands are being carried out to confirm these initial findings.", 
    "58": "The incidence of dysrhythmias during the prebypass period of coronary artery surgery has not been accurately reported. Using Holter monitoring of the electrocardiogram, this study was undertaken to determine the incidence of dysrhythmias and ischemia and their relationship to specific events during the prebypass period. The role of preoperative calcium entry blockers (CEB), beta-adrenergic blockers (BB), or both on the incidence of dysrhythmias and ischemia was also studied. One hundred thirty-eight patients were premedicated with morphine, scopolamine, and diazepam. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl or sufentanil followed by either pancuronium or vecuronium and maintained with sufentanil or enflurane. All 138 patients experienced a dysrhythmia during the prebypass period. Seventy-five percent of the patients had at least one episode of a supraventricular dysrhythmia (SVD), 39% had a sinus bradycardia, and 20% had a conduction abnormality. Ninety-two percent of the patients had premature ventricular contractions (PVC) and, surprisingly, 76% had non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. One patient developed ventricular fibrillation and one had ventricular tachycardia. The peak incidence of dysrhythmias occurred at insertion of the pulmonary artery (PA) catheter and at aortic dissection. The incidence of prebypass ischemia was 18%, but these patients did not have a higher incidence of ventricular dysrhythmias. Preoperative CEBs and BBs did not influence the incidence of ischemia or dysrhythmias with the exception of SVD; there was a significantly lower incidence at PA catheterization in patients taking CEBs preoperatively (P < .05). It can be concluded that dysrhythmias are very common during the prebypass period. The low rate of progression to life-threatening dysrhythmias may be related to the fact that the majority occurred during mechanical stimulation and that patients were chronically taking CEBs and/or BBs preoperatively.", 
    "59": "Effects of alismol, a sesquiterpenoid isolated from the rhyzome of Alisma orientale, on adrenergic mechanisms were examined in the isolated rabbit ear artery. Alismol (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) inhibited the contraction of isolated rabbit ear artery by electrical stimulation of the perivascular nerves. The inhibition was concentration-dependent; at a concentration of 10(-4) M, the inhibition was 90% (n = 8). Treatment with 10(-4) M alismol inhibited the increase in 3H-noradrenaline (3H-NAd) release induced by electrical stimulation by 63 +/- 6%. Alismol at 10(-4) M did not affect the neuronal uptake of 3H-NAd in the artery. Alismol at 10(-4) M slightly inhibited contractions induced by exogenously administered NAd. These results demonstrate that alismol inhibits the adrenergic neuro-effector mechanisms in rabbit ear artery, and they suggest that alismol acts primarily on nerve terminals and inhibits their responses to electrical stimulation by interfering with NAd release.", 
    "60": "The level of the ST-segment fluctuates transiently during treadmill exercise in some patients with angina pectoris. In the present study, the incidence and clinical significance of ST-segment fluctuation were studied before and after propranolol in 52 patients with angina pectoris. A transient greater than 0.5-mm (0.05 mV) upward shift of the ST-segment during a graded treadmill test was considered a significant fluctuation in leads without signs of previous myocardial infarction. The fluctuation was observed in three of 30 patients with rest or rest and effort angina pectoris before propranolol and in 14 of them after propranolol, while only one of 22 patients with effort angina alone showed fluctuation after the drug. Coronary arteriography revealed that in 15 patients showing ST-segment fluctuation with propranolol, seven patients had no significant coronary stenosis, six had one-vessel disease and two had two-vessel disease. In 24 patients with documented coronary artery spasm, ST-segment fluctuation was induced in two (8%) before propranolol and in 13 (54%) after propranolol. Our results suggest that ST-segment fluctuation during graded treadmill exercise may be related to transient coronary vasospasms exacerbated by propranolol.", 
    "61": "1. The roles of the sympathetic nerves in regulating lipid synthesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) were studied by measuring incorporation of 3H from 3H2O into glyceride glycerol and glyceride fatty acids in the interscapular BAT in anaesthetized rats. 2. When noradrenaline was infused intravenously at a total dose of 1-8 micrograms/100 g body weight over 30 min, 3H incorporation into glyceride glycerol increased whereas 3H incorporation into fatty acids did not change. Similar responses were found when the sympathetic nerves entering the interscapular BAT were stimulated continuously at 10 Hz. However, when electrical stimuli consisting of a much shorter train (2 s) were applied to the nerves at 3 min intervals at 10 Hz (stimulation in bursts). 3H incorporation into both glyceride glycerol and fatty acids was enhanced. Stimulation in bursts elicited more pronounced lipogenic responses than other patterns that were employed, and involved the delivery of precisely the same number of impulses over the whole period of stimulation. The lipogenic responses to nerve stimulation in bursts were increased by increasing the stimulus frequency over the range 4-40 Hz. 3. Simultaneous administration of propranolol and phenoxybenzamine had little effect on either the fatty acid or the glyceride glycerol response to nerve stimulation. In contrast, these blocking agents almost completely eliminated the responses to noradrenaline infusion. 4. Pre-treatment with guanethidine effectively abolished the lipogenic response to nerve stimulation but potentiated the response to noradrenaline infusion. 5. It is concluded that lipid synthesis in BAT is enhanced by direct electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerves only when they are stimulated in bursts. Sympathetic activation of lipogenesis in BAT is not solely attributable to the action of noradrenaline but involves some non-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "62": "The between-subject and within-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of labetalol at steady state were determined. Sixteen nonobese normal volunteers (mean age, 27 years) received five different formulations of labetalol orally on five different occasions every 12 hours for five doses. A 7-day washout separated each administration phase. Plasma concentration-time data for labetalol were obtained over the 24-hour period after the fifth dose in each phase. Labetalol concentrations in plasma were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pharmacokinetic parameters for each subject after each study phase were estimated. The mean V beta/F, Vdss/F, TBC/F, t1/2 beta, and AUC tau 0 for each subject ranged between 18.1 and 161.9 L/kg, 7.1 and 53.9 L/kg, 1.3 and 5.72 L/hr/kg, 6.9 and 11.0 hours, and 154 and 520 micrograms.hr/L, respectively, indicating large interindividual variability. Considerable intraindividual variability in each of the pharmacokinetic parameters was also observed. These data indicate that a larger number of subjects will be required to detect \"significant\" differences in the disposition of labetalol.", 
    "63": "Ten healthy male volunteers completed a study to determine the effect of cimetidine dose timing on the oral clearance of propranolol. Propranolol HCl 160 mg as tablets, was administered daily at 8 AM for 4 consecutive days on three occasions. In addition, cimetidine HCl 800 mg as tablets, was administered either simultaneously in the morning with propranolol (8 AM), at bedtime (10 PM), or not at all (control). Each treatment was separated by at least a 3-day washout. Propranolol and cimetidine serum samples were measured over the 24-hour dosing interval after the last propranolol dose. Cimetidine administration at 8 AM and 10 PM was associated with significant mean increases in the propranolol area under the serum concentration-time curve of 26% and 41%, respectively (P less than .002). The mean elimination half-life of propranolol was 6.3 hours during all three treatments. There was no significant difference in area under cimetidine serum concentration time curve between 8 AM and 10 PM dosing. Dosing cimetidine at bedtime 10 hours before propranolol does not diminish the magnitude of interaction.", 
    "64": "Twenty young (45 years or younger) and 20 older (55 years or older) adult patients with mild hypertension were enrolled in this study to compare the hemodynamic effects of labetalol versus placebo in two age groups. Ten patients in each group were randomly assigned to receive either a single oral dose of labetalol (200 mg) or placebo. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded immediately before and two hours after ingestion. Labetalol was more effective than placebo in significantly lowering systolic blood pressure (-11 versus + 5 mm Hg, -23 versus + 4 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (-9 versus + 2 mm Hg, -12 versus + 5 mm Hg), and total systemic resistance (-259 versus + 42 dynes-sec cm-5, -390 versus + 74 dynes-sec cm-5) in young and older hypertensive subjects, respectively. There was no significant changes in heart rate, stroke volume index, or cardiac index in either age group. These data indicate that labetalol lowers blood pressure in young an older hypertensives primarily by reducing peripheral resistance and that the antihypertensive effect may be somewhat greater in older patients.", 
    "65": "The reported study determined whether timolol would afford a protective effect by preventing the coronary occlusion-induced arrhythmias associated with the increase in plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E). Ten anesthetized cats received saline or timolol (5 mg/kg, IV) five minutes after coronary occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery 10 to 14 mm below its origin. Coronary occlusion produced arrhythmia in three of the cats that received saline and in four of the cats that received timolol. Three of the saline-treated cats died in cardiogenic shock; two were sacrificed six hours postocclusion. Four of the timolol-treated cats died in congestive heart failure postcoronary occlusion. There was a gradual increase in NE (P greater than .05) and E (P less than .05) in both groups after coronary occlusion. Death produced a significant increase in NE and E levels. Timolol did not modify the occurrence of arrhythmias and the associated increase in plasma NE and E that developed after coronary occlusion and at death.", 
    "66": "In a randomized double-blind postinfarction study 301 patients were treated with either metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. (n = 154) or placebo (n = 147) for three years. After the three-year treatment period the study preparation was gradually withdrawn over one week, followed by another 2-7 year follow-up. Mortality and morbidity data were studied both during the intervention period (reported elsewhere) and over the period following withdrawal of study therapy. During the period following the withdrawal of the trial preparation, there were 16 (14%) and 31 (24%) deaths in the previously placebo and metoprolol groups, respectively (P = 0.10). Corresponding figures for reinfarctions and cerebrovascular events were 15 (13%) vs. 12 (9%) and 14 (12%) vs. 9 (7%) (NS). From a Cox regression analysis taking 13 different variables into account, a model describing the risk for subsequent death was constructed. The model identified the following important variables: sex (relative risk (rr) = 2.4), beta-blocker withdrawal (rr = 2.1), performance on exercise test and digitalis treatment (rr = 2.3, P less than 0.05). The present results, as well as those from other studies, seem to favour continuous postinfarction beta blocker therapy provided that there are no severe side-effects from therapy. Digitalis therapy in postinfarction patients in sinus rhythm may have adverse effects on survival during long-term follow-up.", 
    "67": "The kinetics of hepatic elimination of the high-clearance drug propranolol has been interpreted in a previous study from our laboratory, in which propranolol protein binding was varied, to conform to the venous equilibrium model. In another study by a different group, in which perfusate flow was varied, propranolol kinetics was interpreted to conform to the sinusoidal model. In the present study, we investigated the possibility that this discrepancy is due to the use of the two different discriminants, flow and protein binding, in the two studies. In eight livers, perfused in a recirculating design, steady-state elimination of propranolol (infused at a rate of 22.8 micrograms/min) was examined at perfusate flow rates of 16 and 32 mL/min. Hepatic outflow concentration was independent of perfusate flow rate, while the logarithmic average concentration was significantly lower at the higher flow. These data conform to the venous equilibrium model and are not consistent with the sinusoidal model. This shows that the outcome of these modeling experiments does not depend on the experimental approach used, and reaffirms that the venous equilibrium model is appropriate for propranolol under the conditions studied.", 
    "68": "We describe the endocrine, psychiatric, and neuropsychological assessments of 10 untreated, newly diagnosed Graves' disease subjects who were studied longitudinally at three stages: hyperthyroid (stage 1), after 2 weeks of propranolol treatment (stage 2), and after 6 months of antithyroid treatment (stage 3). Major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and hypomania were diagnosed at stage 1. Elevations on psychiatric symptom rating scales and in motor activity monitoring at stage 1 were significantly decreased at stage 2 and again at stage 3. Psychiatric improvements paralleled improvements in endocrine symptoms. Neuropsychological improvements were noted on the more challenging memory and attention tasks at stage 3, whereas propranolol treatment was not associated with changes on attention tests. Results are discussed in relation to catecholamine-thyroid hormone interactions, in particular, the beta-adrenergic system.", 
    "69": "The effect of MCl-176 [2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenylmethyl)-3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-6- isopropoxy-4(3H)-quinazolinone hydrochloride], a novel calcium channel blocker, on ischemic myocardial acidosis was studied in the dog heart, in which the left anterior descending coronary artery was partially occluded for 90 min (partial occlusion). Myocardial pH (measured by a micro glass pH electrode) was about 7.60 in the nonischemic normal heart. The myocardial pH decreased rapidly in response to partial occlusion, and reached the steady state of about 6.85 within 30 min (i.e., the myocardial [H+] increased after partial occlusion). Saline or drug was injected i.v. 30 min after partial occlusion, and the drug effect was observed till the end of partial occlusion. Myocardial [H+], that had been increased by partial occlusion, restored slightly after the saline injection, and the restoration was about 30% 60 min after the injection. MCl-176 increased this spontaneous restoration of myocardial [H+] with a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate; the restoration induced by 0.1 mg/kg of MCl-176 was 74% 60 min after the injection. Even in the paced heart, MCl-176 (0.1 mg/kg) attenuated the ischemia-induced myocardial acidosis. Propranolol (1 mg/kg) also attenuated the myocardial acidosis, the restoration being 82%. These results indicate that MCl-176 attenuates the myocardial acidosis during ischemia as does propranolol, and that the mechanism of action of MCl-176 is not due primarily to a decrease in heart rate.", 
    "70": "The pharmacological specificity of adrenergic receptors in the plasma membrane of rat ascites hepatoma AH130 cells was compared with that in normal rat hepatocytes. The number of [125I]iodocyanopindolol-binding sites was much greater in AH130 cells than in the hepatocytes. We characterized the alpha-adrenergic receptor subtypes using the alpha 1-selective ligand [3H]prazosin and the alpha 2-selective ligand [3H]clonidine. AH130 cells had fewer prazosin-binding sites than the hepatocytes and about 8 times as many clonidine-binding sites of high affinity. The results showed that the adrenergic receptors in AH130 cells have pharmacological properties that are very different from those of the receptors in normal rat hepatocytes.", 
    "71": "The degree of enhancement in the ocular absorption of timolol afforded by its O-butyryl prodrug and the possibility of reducing its systemic absorption through a proportional reduction in its instilled dose were investigated in the pigmented rabbit. A reversed phase HPLC procedure was used to assay for timolol and O-butyryl timolol in the aqueous humor and plasma over 120 min post-instillation of 25 microliter of drug solutions. We found that the ocular absorption of the O-butyryl prodrug of timolol from a 15 mM solution was 5.5 times greater than that of the parent drug while the systemic absorption was comparable. When a lower concentration of the prodrug (3.75 mM) was used the therapeutic index as assessed by the ratio of aqueous humor to plasma concentrations seemed to improve fifteenfold. Therefore, it is possible to significantly reduce the systemic absorption of timolol without reducing its ocular absorption by using a low dose of its O-butyryl prodrug.", 
    "72": "beta-Adrenergic-inhibiting drugs are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension. These drugs have previously been found to influence a variety of psychologic and behavioral functions and have, in some cases, been associated with serious psychiatric side effects. The present study examined psychologic changes associated with beta-blockade therapy. Twenty-six men with mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90 to 110 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to receive either a selective beta 1-antagonist (atenolol), a nonselective beta 1- and beta 2-antagonist (propranolol), or a placebo. Both before and after a 2-week period of drug administration, subjects completed a comprehensive assessment of quality of life including measures of mood, memory performance, and side effects. In general, beta-blocker therapy was associated with relatively few adverse symptoms, particularly when compared with control subjects taking placebo. Reductions in negative emotional states (tension and anger) were observed for subjects receiving atenolol, and the largest improvements in memory performance were observed for subjects receiving propranolol. These results suggest that beta-blocker therapy is not invariably associated with negative side effects and that some behavioral functions may actually be improved."
