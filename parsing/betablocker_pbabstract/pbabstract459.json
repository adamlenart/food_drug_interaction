    "0": "The acute administration of cocaine (5-20 mg/kg) to rats produced a dose-dependent elevation in both serum corticosterone and plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). These elevations were maximal at 30 min and returned to basal values by 60 min. The dopamine (DA) uptake blockers GBR12909 and nomifensine, the norepinephrine uptake blocker desipramine, as well as the serotonin (5-HT) uptake blocker fluoxetine, also stimulated hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, whereas the local anesthetic procaine did not. Pretreatment with haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the elevations in corticosterone and ACTH elicited by cocaine, as well as the elevation in ACTH produced by GBR12909. Higher doses of haloperidol (1 or 3 mg/kg) also attenuated the HPA response to cocaine and GBR12909. Pretreatment with the D1 antagonist SCH23390, the D2 antagonist sulpiride, the D1/D2 antagonist fluphenazine, or the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin significantly decreased the ACTH elevations after cocaine. In contrast, neither the 5-HT antagonist cyproheptadine, the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin nor the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol attenuated the ACTH response to cocaine. The present results suggest an important stimulatory role for DA in regulation of HPA activity, and a role for both DA and 5-HT in the adrenocortical stimulation by cocaine. Both D1 and D2 receptors appear to be involved in the dopaminergic component of this response.", 
    "1": "The interference of nicardipine and diltiazem infused into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates, with the forearm vascular response to graded exogenous norepinephrine, was evaluated in hypertensive patients. Nicardipine (1 and 3 micrograms/dl forearm tissue/min in both absence and presence of propranolol) increased forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography) and antagonized dose dependently the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine, suggesting that functional alpha-antagonism may participate in the vasodilating and possibly the antihypertensive effect of the drug. On the contrary, no antagonism but rather potentiation of the responses to norepinephrine occurred after diltiazem (0.5 and 1 microgram/dl forearm tissue/min). Because intra-arterial propranolol abolished that potentiating action of the drug, whereas the local vasodilation to isoproterenol was clearly reduced, diltiazem probably interfered with beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasorelaxing mechanisms in human forearm arterioles. The data further stress the heterogeneity of calcium entry blockers in humans.", 
    "2": "Determination of the alpha-adrenergic blocking potency of drugs in humans is usually done by measuring the shift in the blood pressure versus logarithm of intravenous phenylephrine dose-response relationship. Change in blood pressure activates homeostatic reflexes that may change this relationship. This study examines the effect of autonomic (beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic, parasympathetic, and alpha-adrenergic) blockade on the dose versus blood pressure response relationship to sequential doses of phenylephrine in humans. Phenylephrine dose responses were conducted under controlled conditions, during propranolol and atropine infusion, during prazosin-induced alpha 1-adrenergic blockade, and during prazosin, propranolol, and atropine administration. Propranolol-atropine infusion decreased the threshold dose of phenylephrine required to increase mean blood pressure (p less than 0.00001), increased the slope of the phenylephrine dose versus increase in mean blood pressure relationship (p = 0.019), and and decreased the dose of phenylephrine required to increase mean blood pressure by 20 mm Hg (p less than 0.00001). Determination of the alpha-adrenergic blocking potency of prazosin was not affected by autonomic blockade with propranolol and atropine (dose ratio 5.2 before and 5.0 after autonomic blockade; p = 0.465). We conclude that beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic and muscarinic blockade increase sensitivity to phenylephrine by increasing the slope and decreasing the threshold dose of the phenylephrine dose-response curve, and that alpha-adrenergic-blocking potency of prazosin may be determined with or without blocking homeostatic blood pressure regulatory mechanisms in humans.", 
    "3": "The members of the Society of Perinatal Obstetricians were surveyed regarding management of preeclampsia, with focus on drug therapy, use of invasive monitors, and both general policies and treatment of hypothetical cases of preterm severe preeclampsia. There was agreement that magnesium sulfate should be given to all patients with preeclampsia during labor and postpartum and that blood pressure should be held to about 160/105 mmHg. The drugs of choice for control of blood pressure were hydralazine, alpha-methyldopamine, and cardioselective beta-blockers. Most perinatologists use invasive monitors only for specific indications, but a substantial minority use either arterial lines or central venous pressure monitors routinely in severe preeclampsia. There was no consensus with respect to management of preterm, severe preeclampsia, but even among the 49% of respondents who volunteered an unequivocal policy of \"deliver regardless of gestational age,\" over three fourths would hospitalize and observe in selected cases meeting American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria for severe preeclampsia.", 
    "4": "Daily treatment of Fischer-344 rats for 14 days with the beta 2-adrenergic agonist, clenbuterol, increased gastrocnemius muscle mass and protein content. Coadministration with the beta-adrenergic antagonist, nadolol, significantly reduced these anabolic effects of clenbuterol. Although clenbuterol treatment reduced food intake during the first 4 days, clenbuterol-treated rats were hyperphagic during the second week of drug administration. Nadolol treatment also blocked these effects of clenbuterol on feeding. In a second experiment, in vitro incubation of extensor digitorum longus muscles taken from post weaning food-deprived rats demonstrated decreased release of 3-methylhistidine by clenbuterol-treated rats, suggesting decreased breakdown of myofibrillar protein. Protein synthesis was not increased in vitro in the soleus muscles taken from these rats. These experiments demonstrate that the anabolic effect of clenbuterol is due in part to beta-adrenergic activity and may involve reduced myofibrillar protein degradation. These results appear to have direct application to nutrition and protein repletion in various catabolic diseases.", 
    "5": "Cocaine use in pregnancy is associated with a premature labor rate as high as 50%, but little is known about its effect on uterine contractility. To determine whether cocaine directly augments pregnant uterus contractility, uterine strips from 27-day pregnant New Zealand White rabbits (term, 31 days) were exposed to cocaine alone (30 mumol/L) or cocaine plus epinephrine (10(-9) to 10(-5) mol/L) or oxytocin (10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L). Cocaine alone produced no contractions, but increased the epinephrine sensitivity by 51% and the maximal response by 33%. When beta-adrenoceptors were blocked with DL-propranolol (2 mumol/L), the contractile response to epinephrine was increased, and cocaine's effect was blocked. In the presence of the stereoisomer D-propranolol (2 mumol/L) with no beta-adrenergic antagonist activity, the contractile response to epinephrine was unchanged, but the effect of cocaine was still blocked. We conclude that cocaine directly augments the alpha-adrenergic contractile response of the pregnant rabbit uterus by a mechanism that is blocked by the non-beta-adrenergic effects of propranolol.", 
    "6": "Vasovagally mediated hypotension and bradycardia are believed to be common, but difficult to diagnose, causes of syncope. Upright tilt-table testing has been proposed as a possible way to test for vasovagal episodes. This study investigated the clinical utility of this technique in the evaluation and management of patients with syncope of unknown origin.", 
    "7": "Twenty-five patients with recurrent unexplained syncope and six control subjects were evaluated by use of an upright tilt-table test for 30 minutes, with or without an infusion of isoproterenol (1 to 3 micrograms/minute given intravenously), in an attempt to provoke bradycardia, hypotension, or both. Of the 25 patients, there were 14 males and 11 females, with a mean age of 50 +/- 16 years. Six control patients with no history of syncope were also studied. All tilt-positive patients received therapy with either beta-blockers, disopyramide, transdermal scopolamine, or hydroflurocortisone, the efficacy of which was evaluated by another tilt-table test.", 
    "8": "Syncope occurred in six patients (24%) during the baseline tilt and in nine patients (36%) during isoproterenol infusion (total positives, 60%). None of the controls had syncope during the test. All patients who had positive test results eventually became tilt-table-negative by therapy, and over a mean follow-up period of 16 +/- 2 months no further episodes have occurred.",

    "10": "To examine the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on neurohormonal activation in patients with congestive heart failure, 15 men had assessments of hemodynamics and supine peripheral renin and norepinephrine levels before and after 3 months of oral therapy with bucindolol, a nonselective beta antagonist. At baseline, plasma renin activity did not correlate with any hemodynamic parameter. However, norepinephrine levels had a weak correlation with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01), stroke volume index (r = 0.61, p less than 0.02) and pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.54, p less than 0.05). Plasma renin decreased with bucindolol therapy, from 11.6 +/- 13.4 to 4.3 +/- 4.1 ng/ml/hour (mean +/- standard deviation; p less than 0.05), whereas plasma norepinephrine was unchanged, from 403 +/- 231 to 408 +/- 217 pg/ml. A wide diversity of the norepinephrine response to bucindolol was observed with reduction of levels in some patients and elevation in others. Although plasma norepinephrine did not decrease, heart rate tended to decrease (from 82 +/- 20 vs 73 +/- 11 min-1, p = 0.059) with beta-adrenergic blockade, suggesting neurohormonal antagonism at the receptor level. No changes in I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake occurred after bucindolol therapy, suggesting unchanged adrenergic uptake of norepinephrine with beta-blocker therapy. Despite reductions in plasma renin activity and the presence of beta blockade, the response of renin or norepinephrine levels to long-term bucindolol therapy did not predict which patients had improved in hemodynamic status (chi-square = 0.37 for renin, 0.82 for norepinephrine).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "When doxazosin was given to patients with hypertension not adequately controlled by beta-blockade, blood pressure was normalized in 94% of the 34 patients (blood pressure less than or equal to 140/85 mm Hg). This reduction in blood pressure was obtained with doxazosin in combination with metoprolol or oxprenolol at a mean final daily dose of 1.3 mg or pindolol or atenolol at 2.0 mg/day. Exercise-induced increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was also lower with combined beta-blocker and doxazosin therapy than with beta-blocker alone. After 12 weeks of treatment, the combination of doxazosin and beta-blocker significantly reduced total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. All side effects were mild and only one patient was withdrawn from therapy.", 
    "12": "The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of doxazosin (once daily) and prazosin (twice daily) were compared in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 95 to 114 mm Hg) not adequately controlled by diuretics and beta-blockers. Doxazosin produced significantly greater mean reductions in standing (p = 0.01) and supine (p = 0.04) DBP than did prazosin; there were no significant between-group differences in either mean systolic blood pressure or heart rate. The overall mean daily doses for efficacy-evaluable patients were 4.7 mg of doxazosin and 6.7 mg of prazosin. Sixteen patients (84.2%) treated with doxazosin and 13 patients (56.5%) treated with prazosin were considered therapeutic successes (decrease in standing DBP greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg or to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg with greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg reduction from baseline). Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with doxazosin, 15 (78.9%) showed improvement in the severity category of hypertension; an improvement in severity was reported in 14 patients (60.9%) treated with prazosin. Doxazosin produced a more favorable effect on serum lipid levels than did prazosin, although no statistically significant within- or between-group differences were observed. Most side effects experienced with either doxazosin or prazosin were mild or moderate and were tolerated or disappeared with continued treatment. The overall evaluation of toleration was excellent or good for 18 (90%) doxazosin- and 21 (91%) prazosin-treated patients. Clinical efficacy was rated as excellent or good for 16 patients (80%) treated with doxazosin and 15 patients (68%) treated with prazosin.", 
    "13": "Hypertension intervention trials, which have involved mainly the use of diuretics and beta-blockers, have demonstrated a disappointing benefit in terms of reduction of coronary heart disease (CHD). Rather than suggesting that elevated blood pressure and CHD are not causally related, these data suggest that the antihypertensive agents used were not optimal for the management of hypertension and a review of the currently recommended therapies is needed. Major risk factors for CHD, which include increased blood pressure, elevated serum cholesterol levels, and smoking, are highly prevalent in the general population and appear to cluster in patients with hypertension. Therefore the treatment of hypertension demands a multifactorial approach, one that takes into consideration all the risk factors for CHD. Diuretics and beta-blockers adversely affect the serum lipid profile, and this could negate some of the CHD benefit afforded by blood pressure reduction.", 
    "14": "To evaluate the ability of Doppler echocardiography to identify hemodynamic changes due to cardiac medications, 10 volunteers underwent Doppler examination at rest and immediately following vigorous treadmill exercise. Upon completion of the control test, each subject received moderate oral doses of propranolol, verapamil, pindolol, or nifedipine, and the same exercise protocol was repeated. During four control tests, values for peak acceleration and flow velocity integral were similar for each subject at rest and exercise. Following propranolol and pindolol, resting acceleration fell by 4.5 and 2 m/sec2, respectively p less than 0.05. Resting acceleration was unchanged by verapamil and increased following nifedipine by 1.7 m/sec2 (p less than 0.0001), but neither verapamil nor nifedipine altered either Doppler parameter. Flow velocity integral was increased by nifedipine at rest and by each of the beta-blockers during exercise (p less than 0.05). We conclude that (1) rest and exercise Doppler measurements are stable and reproducible, given stable cardiovascular status; (2) pindolol produced less hemodynamic depression as measured by Doppler echocardiography at rest relative to propranolol, but showed similar potency at maximal exertion; (3) nifedipine enhanced global cardiac performance at rest, but neither calcium antagonist affected Doppler measurements during exercise; and (4) Doppler echocardiography is a useful, noninvasive technique for evaluating hemodynamic effects of medication at rest and during vigorous exercise.", 
    "15": "To test alterations in plasma potassium and magnesium levels with maximal exercise, 15 sedentary, healthy men (mean age 29 years) participated in a double-blind crossover study for 11 weeks with propranolol, atenolol, and placebo. Maximal exercise tests were done at baseline and after placebo and beta-blockade phases. Blood for analysis was collected via indwelling brachial vein angiocatheters at baseline and during and after testing. Plasma potassium and magnesium levels increased at peak exercise with atenolol, propranolol, and placebo. There was no difference among groups in baseline recovery for magnesium (mean 28 minutes, range 24 to 30 minutes). Potassium levels returned to baseline more rapidly (compared with magnesium) in the placebo and atenolol groups (mean 10 minutes); however, recovery time was prolonged with propranolol (26 minutes) compared with placebo and atenolol (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, plasma magnesium and potassium levels increased significantly with maximal exercise and are unaffected by atenolol or propranolol beta-blockade. Propranolol, however (compared with atenolol and placebo), prolongs the time of return to baseline of plasma potassium after exercise.", 
    "16": "The effects of mechanical changes in loading conditions on the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR) were studied in nine open-chest dogs, including three dogs studied before and after beta-adrenergic blockade. Left ventricular pressure was measured with a micromanometer, and left ventricular volume was measured with a conductance catheter. ESPVRs were obtained by increasing left atrial inflow over wide volume ranges (as much as threefold) under three different conditions: control or high or low aortic impedance. High impedance was obtained by occlusion of the descending aorta, and low impedance was obtained by a shunt between the subclavian artery and the left atrium. In the unblocked animals in 21 of 28 runs, a second-order polynomial equation gave a better fit for the ESPVR than a linear relation. To quantify the effects of the changes in aortic impedance on the ESPVR, we calculated from the quadratic equation its volume intercept (V18) and its local slope (E18) at an end-systolic pressure (Pes) of 18 kPa. In the unblocked animals, a statistically significant difference was found in V18 between low impedance (21.50 +/- 6.27 ml) and high impedance (14.10 +/- 8.98 ml; p less than 0.005) and between control (19.14 +/- 9.58 ml) and high impedance (p less than 0.05). In most dogs, E18 was increased at high and decreased at low impedance, but not significantly. In the additional experiments with beta-blockade, the nonlinearity diminished somewhat, but the load dependency of the ESPVR remained present after beta-blockade because the same leftward shift of the ESPVR with high aortic impedance was found. Two other relations, namely, of dP/dtmax and of stroke work versus end-diastolic volume, were also investigated, which on the whole showed the same behavior as the ESPVR. These results indicate that the ESPVR and dP/dtmax-Ved and stroke work-end-diastolic volume relations, when studied over a wide volume range, are nonlinear and that changes in loading conditions influence indexes of contractility derived from these relations, especially the volume intercepts, in such a way that an increase in aortic impedance may be interpreted as an increase in contractility. Blocking the beta-adrenergic receptors did not influence the load dependency of the ESPVR but, in some cases, tended to decrease the nonlinearity in concordance with the relation between contractility and nonlinearity in isolated hearts.", 
    "17": "The propranolol effect on GABA synthesis rate in some brain structures using two different method was assessed. Both methods gave comparable results. Evaluation of the synthesis rate in vivo after inhibition of GABA degradation supplied more adequate information indicating that the availability of GABA precursor in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus is limited.", 
    "18": "We have previously established a link between magnesium-deficiency-induced cardiomyopathy and free radical injury. In the present study, golden Syrian male hamsters were placed on either magnesium-deficient or magnesium-supplemented diets. Animals from each group received either d,l-propranolol or d-propranolol (the non-beta-blocking form). After 14 days, the animals were sacrificed and their hearts isolated for morphological and morphometric analyses. Hematoxylin/eosin-stained sections were examined by a computer image analysis system for a morphometric determination of the severity of myocardial injury. Propranolol reduced both the density of lesions, from 0.32 to 0.06 lesions/mm2 (p < 0.01), and the area fraction of lesions, from 9.8 x 10(-4) to 2.5 x 10(-4) lesion area/mm2 (p < 0.01). In addition, d-propranolol was virtually equipotent to d,l-propranolol, indicating that part of the protective effect of propranolol, in this model, was attributable to its antioxidant properties.", 
    "19": "The muscarinic cholinoreceptors in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus were studied in a group of 12-week-old rats subjected to the effect of alcohol in utero and during the lactation period. The beta-adrenoreceptors in the same brain regions were investigated in another group of 8-week-old rats, likewise exposed perinatally to ethanol. The affinity of the muscarinic receptors was found to decrease in the hippocampus of the rats perinatally exposed to ethanol (increase of the Kd-value), and of the beta-adrenoreceptors to increase (decrease of the Kd-value) compared with the affinity of the respective receptors in the same brain structure of the control group of rats of the same age. The role of the changes induced by ethanol during the perinatal development in the muscarinic and beta-adrenoreceptors in the hippocampus, and especially the disturbed balance between these receptors, is examined as one of the factors responsible for the cognitive disturbances inherent to the rats with foetal alcohol syndrome.", 
    "20": "Brain noradrenergic (NA) systems have often been implicated in the regulation of desynchronized sleep (DS). The present experiments investigate the effects on DS of the microinjection, into the cat dorsal pontine tegmentum (DPT), of the alpha 2-agonist clonidine (CLON), the beta-agonist isoproterenol and the beta-antagonist propranolol. The DPT comprises most NA neurons belonging to the locus coeruleus (LC) complex, as well as other cell groups thought to be crucially involved in DS generation. Cats were implanted with standard electrodes (electroencephalogram, electrooculogram and electromyogram, PGO waves, hippocampal activity) and with guide tubes aimed at the DPT. Unilateral or bilateral injections (0.25 microliter) were performed by way of thin cannulae inserted through the guide tubes. Polygraphic activity was then recorded in daily sessions lasting 4 h and scored according to standard criteria. Bilateral injections of CLON into the DPT greatly reduced DS, while unilateral injections were much less effective. Since CLON is known to powerfully inhibit NA LC neurons, its effect was thus opposite to that expected on the basis of the reciprocal interaction model of DS generation, which postulates that NA neurons in the LC inhibit DS-executive cells located in the pontine reticular formation. Bilateral injections of the beta-agonist isoproterenol also reduced DS, while the beta-antagonist propranolol consistently enhanced it, the latter largely due to an increased number of DS episodes. These effects were dose-dependent and strictly site-specific, since injections in immediately neighboring structures were ineffective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "The role of the vesitibulo-cerebellum of the rabbit in the control of the vestibulo-ocular response (VOR) and optokinetic response (OKR) reflexes was investigated by bilateral microinjections, into the flocculus, of substances affecting GABAergic or noradrenergic neurotransmission. GABA, the main transmitter through which cerebellar interneurons inhibit Purkinje cells directly or indirectly, acts normally through GABAA receptors (mainly located in the granular layer) and GABAB receptors (predominantly located in the molecular layer). Despite this different distribution, floccular injections of the GABAA agonist muscimol and of the GABAB agonist baclofen had a similar effect, presumably by profound inhibition of Purkinje cells. This effect consisted of a reduction in the gain of the VOR (in darkness and in light) as well as of the OKR by at least 50%. This provides firm evidence that the net effect of normal Purkinje-cell activity in the flocculus is to enhance the VOR and OKR, rather than to inhibit these responses, as is sometimes supposed. Intrafloccular injections of the beta-noradrenergic agonist isoproterenol or the beta-noradrenergic antagonist sotalol did not affect the basic magnitude of the VOR and OKR. However, these substances markedly affected the adaptive processes, which cause the VOR and OKR to change its magnitude when this is no longer adequate in stabilizing the retinal image. By a suitable combination of vestibular and optokinetic stimuli, consistent upward changes in the gain of these reflexes could be reliably and reproducibly induced in uninjected animals. Floccular injections of sotalol impaired these adaptive changes markedly, whereas injections of isoproterenol enhanced the adaptation, particularly of the VOR measured in darkness. These findings strongly suggest that the effectuation of adaptive changes of vestibular, and possibly other, motor control systems is strongly facilitated by the noradrenergic innervation of the flocculus, which is normally provided by the locus coeruleus (LC), by way of the beta-receptor system, although the activity of this system does not directly affect the signal transmission supporting the basic reflexes as such.", 
    "22": "The effect of administration of estradiol benzoate on beta-adrenergic receptors of rat adenohypophyseal cells was studied. Twenty days' administration of estradiol benzoate was followed by an increase of adenohypophyseal weight and a decrease in specific binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA). In contrast to thyroid hormone treatment which induced an increase in 3H-DHA binding, thyroid hormone treatment decreased both the growth reaction and the reaction of beta-adrenergic receptors after estradiol. Although the relationship between the adenohypophyseal receptors and the growth reaction is unclear, changes in beta-adrenergic receptors after hormonal therapy can be one of pathophysiological conditions that may influence this reaction.", 
    "23": "An effort was made to determine whether the beta-blocking agents: timolol maleate and betaxolol hydrochloride could affect the activity of the plasma membrane, transport ATPases of corneal endothelial and epithelial cells grown in culture. It was found that both agents were able to inhibit the activity of Na+K+ATPase in endothelial cells in the concentration range from 10(-12) to 10(-4) M (47-77% inhibition with timolol and 24-78% inhibition with betaxolol). In concentrations of 10(-9) M or greater (for betaxolol) and 10(-12) M or greater (for timolol) the inhibition was highly significant (p less than .001). Timolol maleate also inhibited the activity of Na+K+ATPase in epithelial cells in the concentration range from 10(-12) to 10(-4) M (16-68%). The inhibition was significant to the p = .002 level at concentrations greater than 10(-11) M. Although the data suggested that both drugs caused inhibition of Mg+2ATPase through the same concentration ranges, none of the values were statistically different compared to the controls. This study may point to a minor inhibition of the deturgescent pump with the use of these agents. It may also indicate caution for usage in patients with metabolically stressed corneas.", 
    "24": "In conscious fasted rabbits, the iv infusion of salbutamol (3 micrograms/kg per min) and clonidine (2 micrograms/kg per min) induced a blood glucose increase amenable to blockade, respectively by ICI 118551 (1 micrograms/kg per min) and idazoxan (20 micrograms/kg per min). Amidephrine (10 micrograms/kg per min) and salbutamol mediated an increase in plasma lactate which was attenuated by prazosin (50 micrograms/kg, sc) and ICI 118551 respectively. Clonidine did not alter basal plasma lactate. The iv infusion of adrenaline (0.3 micrograms/kg per min) evoked an increase in plasma lactate more sensitive to blockade by ICI 118551 than by prazosin. ICI 118551 also shortened the hyperglycaemic response to adrenaline, 3-Mercaptopicolinic acid (25 mg/kg) reduced salbutamol- and adrenaline-mediated hyperglycaemia and increased at the same time the lactate/glucose ratio. Our data show that plasma lactate levels may be regulated by alpha 1- and beta 2-excitatory adrenoceptor stimulation. However, only the increase in blood lactate derived from beta 2-adrenergic stimulation seems to contribute to the overall catecholamine-mediated hyperglycaemia.", 
    "25": "The effects of moderate protein deficiency on the number and dissociation constant of beta-adrenergic receptors were investigated. One group of adult rats was fed a protein-deficient diet (5% protein), a control group was given a similar diet with 20% protein, and a third group was fed a standard pellet diet. After 21 days, the salivary glands were removed and the cell membranes were isolated. The binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol to cell membranes was measured, with or without the presence of timolol, a potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The rats fed the 5% protein diet had fewer beta-adrenoceptors in both the parotid and the submandibular glands than did the 20% protein group, which did not differ from the standard pellet group. The dissociation constant was not affected by protein deficiency. The rats fed the 5% protein diet had a significantly lower gain in body weight, less heavy submandibular glands but heavier parotids than the rats fed 20% protein. Thus the cellular conditions for protein secretion in the salivary glands are impaired during moderate protein deficiency in the adult rat.", 
    "26": "1. The role of adrenergic and cholinergic mediators in the regulation of salivary phospholipid secretion was investigated using rat sublingual acinar cells maintained in the presence of [3H]choline. 2. The release of [3H]choline containing phospholipids was enhanced by beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol to a greater extent than the cholinergic agonist, pilocarpine. 3. The effect of isoproterenol on phospholipid release was observed even after 5 min and by 30 min a 1.7-fold increase in secretion occurred, whereas pilocarpine evoked 1.2-fold increase by 30 min with no discernible effect in 5 min. The isoproterenol effect was blocked by alprenolol, and an inhibition of pilocarpine effect was observed with atropine. 4. In the absence of mediators, 82% of secreted labeled phospholipids were represented by phosphatidylcholine (PC), 4.3% by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and 12.1% by sphingomyeline (Sph), those secreted in the presence of isoproterenol showed significantly lower (37%) content of LPC, while those secreted in response to pilocarpine were substantially richer in LPC (2.5 times) and Sph (27%), and contained less (17%) PC. 5. The results provide first evidence for the involvement of adrenergic and cholinergic mediators in the regulation of salivary phospholipid secretion.", 
    "27": "3H-CGP 12177 and 3H-DHA binding to rat reticulocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors by using an excess of 1 x 10(-5) mol l-1 propranolol was evaluated by means of affinity spectra. To describe the 3H-CGP 12177 interaction with rat reticulocytes a binding isotherm valid for one single class of specific binding sites was found to be satisfactory. On the other hand, a more complex binding isotherm had to be used for the description of the 3H-DHA interaction with rat reticulocytes. This observation further supports the preferred application of 3H-CGP 12177 over 3H-DHA for radio-receptor assay of beta-adrenoceptor blockers.", 
    "28": "An extracorporeal circulation of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was utilized to continuously monitor the rapid and progressive effects of endogenous or exogenous catecholamines on blood respiratory/acid-base status, and to provide in vivo evidence for adrenergic retention of carbon dioxide (CO2) in fish blood (cf. Wood and Perry 1985). Exposure of fish to severe aquatic hypoxia (final PwO2 = 40-60 torr; reached within 10-20 min) elicited an initial respiratory alkalosis resulting from hypoxia-induced hyperventilation. However, at a critical arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) between 15 and 25 torr, fish became agitated for approximately 5 s and a marked (0.2-0.4 pH unit) but transient arterial blood acidosis ensued. This response is characteristic of abrupt catecholamine mobilization into the circulation and subsequent adrenergic activation of red blood cell (RBC) Na+/H+ exchange (Fievet et al. 1987). Within approximately 1-2 min after the activation of RBC Na+/H+ exchange by endogenous catecholamines, there was a significant rise in arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) whereas arterial PO2 was unaltered; the elevation of PaCO2 could not be explained by changes in gill ventilation. Pre-treatment of fish with the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine did not prevent the apparent catecholamine-mediated increase of PaCO2. Conversely, pre-treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol abolished both the activation of the RBC Na+/H+ antiporter and the associated rise in PaCO2, suggesting a causal relationship between the stimulation of RBC Na+/H+ exchange and the elevation of PaCO2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The developmental changes in the beta-adrenergic receptor/cyclic AMP generating system were examined using mouse cerebral cortical neurons in primary culture. During neuronal growth in vitro, the number of binding sites for [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) showed a tendency to increase (Bmax), while the affinity (Kd) for [3H]DHA did not show any noticeable changes. Basal and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities as well as the activation of adenylate cyclase by 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp), NaF and forskolin showed progressive and parallel increases during neuronal growth on a polylysine-coated surface. The treatment of primary cultured neurons with islet-activating protein (IAP), one of the pertussis toxins, attenuated the inhibitory effect of carbachol, a muscarinic agonist, on isoproterenol-induced activation of adenylate cyclase activity. These results indicate that primary cultured neurons possess a cyclic AMP generating system coupled with beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, which is regulated via stimulatory and inhibitory GTP-binding proteins, respectively. The results described above also suggest that the beta-adrenergic receptor, stimulatory and inhibitory types of GTP-binding proteins and adenylate cyclase may develop in a parallel fashion during neuronal growth on a polylysine-coated surface.", 
    "30": "The role of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in regulation of rat Harderian gland type II thyroxine 5'-deiodinase (5'-D) activity was investigated. Our results show that isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, and phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, elicited increases in Harderian gland 5'-D activity. The activation was dependent on the time and the dose of the drug. Other adrenergic agonists, i.e., norepinephrine, methoxamine or terbutaline, also clearly increased the enzyme activity. Moreover, administration of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, or prazosin, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, completely prevented the activation of the enzyme induced by norepinephrine. Results show a clear regulation by adrenergic mechanisms of 5'-D activity in the rat Harderian gland, where alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors appear to be involved.", 
    "31": "Employing the isolated rat portal vein for testing (+/-) dobutamine, and its (+) and (-) enantiomers, we have confirmed the results obtained by Ruffolo et al (1981, 1983) using different methods. In the rat portal vein, (-) dobutamine acts as an alpha agonist, less potent than noradrenaline. The racemate acts as an alpha-agonist with about half the potency of (-) dobutamine. The (+) isomer shows no effects. In the presence of the alpha blocker BE 2254, all compounds, (+/-), (+) and (-) dobutamine, showed dose-dependent beta effects. These were surely the result of the action on beta 2 adrenoceptors since they could be antagonized by the potent and specific beta 2 antagonist ICI 118-551. We have found that (+) dobutamine is, as a beta 2 agonist, 355 to 1,480 times less potent than isoprenaline and 12-16 times more potent than (-) dobutamine. The pA2 of ICI 118-551 against (+) dobutamine is 9.36 (+/- 0.04). This high value is further proof that the beta receptor population of the rat portal vein is beta 2.", 
    "32": "A non-tumorigenic keratinocyte cell line with complete epidermal differentiation capacity (HaCaT) was used in radioligand binding experiments to determine the number of beta-adrenoceptors. Intact cells were saturated with 3H-labelled (-)CGP-12177 (CGP), a hydrophilic non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist as radioligand. In order to investigate the beta-adrenergic subtype selectivity, displacement experiments were performed with different antagonists and agonists. Binding of CGP to keratinocytes has been shown to be reversible and saturable and to have high affinity (Bmax = 114.0 +/- 8.8 fmol/10(7) cells with 6866 receptors/cell, KD = 0.095 +/- 0.017 nmol/l; n = 11). Beta-adrenergic antagonists inhibited binding yielding monophasic displacement curves. IC50-values (nmol/l) were: propranolol (non-selective) 1.68; CGP-12177 (non-selective) 1.08; ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective) 2.92; bisoprolol (beta 1-selective) 1230; and CGP-20712 (beta 1-selective) 24,980. Agonists displaced CGP in the order isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline. We conclude that HaCaT cells express a high density of beta2-adrenoceptors providing a good model system to study adrenergic receptor mechanisms under reproducible experimental conditions in keratinocytes.", 
    "33": "The influence of anaprilin, oxprenolol, nonachlazine, prazosin and levodopa on the clinical course and haemodynamics was investigated in 138 patients with ischaemic heart disease in whom selective coronary angiography had revealed an up to 50 percent stenosis of one of coronary arteries. The clinical picture of IHD patients with a high tolerance of physical exercise was characterized by a preponderance of spontaneous angina pectoris accompanied by painless myocardial ischaemia. A certain role in the genesis of these disturbances is played by the relative increase in the activity of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors and decrease in beta-adrenoreceptor activity. Prazosin and nonachlazine in monotherapy reduced the number of anginal attacks and episodes of painless myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "34": "A study was made of changes in the amplitude and percentile contribution of respiratory waves and slow waves of heart rhythm (SW1 with a period of 8-14 s and SW2 with a period of 14-60 s) in 13 patients with panic attacks (PA) in the lying position after the 3-day monotherapy with the beta-blocker propranolol, alpha-blocker phentolamine and diazepam. Propranolol normalized baroreflex regulation of arterial pressure and raised SW1. Phentolamine, producing an analogous effect, enhanced sympathoadrenal activation and the rate of PA, reducing RW. The amplitude of SW2 that correlated with emotional tension and anxiety fell only as a result of the administration of diazepam. The latter drug did not influence the baroreflex (via SW1) and vagal (via RW) mechanisms of regulation.",

Measurements of beta 1-adrenoceptorblockade (reduction of exercise heart rate) and of beta 2-adrenoceptor-blockade (attenuation of isoprenaline induced finger tremor) were made after the first, eighth and fifteenth doses of each drug. Plasma concentrations showed dose related increases between 10 mg and 40 mg doses of betaxolol, and there was significant drug accumulation at steady state compared with after single dosing. The reduction in exercise heart rate (EHR) with B10 was less in comparison with all other treatments. There were no significant differences in effects between single and chronic-dosing for any of the treatments (% reduction EHR compared with placebo, on days 1 and 15): B10 (18.2, 19.0), B40 (28.6, 26.5); A100 (22.7, 23.1); N40 (26.6, 23.8). Dose-ratios for attenuation of isoprenaline-induced finger tremor (IT100) were significantly greater with B40 compared with B10 or A100 (no dose-ratio for finger tremor could be calculated for N40). There were no differences between single and chronic-dosing (IT100 dose-ratios on days 1 and 15): B10 (3.0, 2.5), B40 (4.4, 5.3); A100 (3.0, 3.0). The attenuation of isoprenaline-induced chronotropic response (IH25) by N40 was significantly greater in comparison with all other treatments. IH25 dose-ratios (on days 1 and 15) were as follows: B10 (2.8, 3.6), B40 (5.1, 5.8); A100 (3.6, 3.6); N40 (19.0, 17.4).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "Effect of verapamil, propranolol, chlorpromazine and carbisocaine on dynamics and/or order of liposomes (perturbation effect), prepared from different molar ratios of lecithin (PC) and rat brain total lipids (TL) was studied by EPR spectroscopy using spin probes 16-doxyl stearic acid and 14-doxyl phosphatidylcholine. The PC liposomes had higher dynamics and/or lower order than the TL liposomes. The perturbation effect of the drugs depended largely on the lipid composition of the liposomes. The drugs at the drug/lipid molar ratios from 0.1 to 1 increased membrane dynamics and/or decreased membrane order. The drugs had the most pronounced perturbation effect in the liposomes prepared from brain total lipids. The effect of the drugs decreased with decreasing the TL/PC ratio in the liposomes and was lowest, almost diminished, in the PC liposomes. Increasing concentration of the drugs decreased the difference between the dynamics and/or order of the PC and TL liposomes and so eliminated the influence of lipid composition on these membrane parameters. The results emphasize the role of lipid composition in studies concerning drug-lipid interactions in model and biological membranes.",

    "38": "There is increasing evidence that alpha-adrenoceptors also exist in the myocardium and that an increase in force of contraction may be produced by stimulation of these sites. This positive inotropism seems to be dependent either on an increased amount of Ca++ released into the cytosol with each action potential or on increased myofilament responsiveness. In contrast, beta-adrenergic stimulation reduces the sensitivity of the contractile proteins and the positive inotropic effect is due to the activation of L-type calcium channels on the sarcolemma. We used single, isolated, enzymatically dissociated, adult rat ventricular myocytes. Cells were loaded either with the ester derivative of the Ca++ probe Indo-1 or with the intracellular pH probe Snarf-1 and at the same time we measured the contractile parameters and monitored the fluorescence as an index of intracellular calcium concentration or pH value. The single cells (bicarbonate buffer continuously gassed with O2 95%, CO2 5%, Ca++ 1.5 mM, field stimulation 0.5 Hz) were exposed to phenylephrine (50 microM) and nadolol (1 microM). Alpha-adrenergic stimulation increased twitch amplitude (delta ES = 1.93 +/- 0.77, n = 8; p less than 0.05) and showed only a slight increase in Ca++ transient. On the other end, the positive inotropic effect (delta ES = 2.84 +/- 0.86, n = 4; p less than 0.02) obtained with beta-adrenergic stimulation (isoproterenol 50 nM, bicarbonate buffer, Ca++ 0.5 mM, field stimulation 0.2 Hz) was always associated with a large increase in intracellular Ca++ concentration. Isoproterenol did not change intracellular pH (delta pH = 0.006 +/- 0.006, n = 4; NS) while phenylephrine increased it significantly (delta pH = 0.055 +/- 0.011, n = 8; p less than 0.002). Moreover, there was a statistically significant correlation between delta ES and delta pH (R2 = 0.532; p less than 0.05) when phenylephrine was present. This alkalinization as well as the increased contractility was antagonized by treatment with ethyl isopropyl-amiloride (10 microM), a selective Na+/H+ inhibitor (delta ES = 0.09 +/- 0.07, n = 6; NS and delta pH = -0.001 +/- 0.011, n = 6; NS). Thus, alpha-adrenergic stimulation in isolated cardiac cells exerts a positive inotropic effect and this is associated with a significant intracellular pH alkalinization. In contrast, the marked inotropic action of beta-stimulation does not involve any intracellular pH modulation. Therefore, it seems likely that, in myocardial cells, an increased myofilament responsiveness due to the alkalinization could represent a possible mechanism for the positive inotropic effect mediated by alpha-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "39": "The effects of calcium antagonists on the amount of LDL-receptor (LDL-R) mRNA in cultured human fibroblasts was examined by hybridization with a fragment of LDL-R cDNA. In a 'Northern' blot the fragment hybridized to a 5,3-kilobase RNA, as expected for LDL-R mRNA. The concentration of this RNA was increased in preparations from cells that were treated with Verapamil or Diltiazem. The selectivity of the increase was established by using a probe for beta-actin mRNA. In dot-blot hybridization it was observed that the calcium antagonists cause 2-3-fold relative increase in the amount of LDL-R mRNA. The increase in the amount of LDL-R mRNA is paralleled by elevated high binding and uptake of [125J] LDL by cells pretreated with the calcium entry blocker. Studies in several types of animal models especially cholesterol-fed rabbits, have shown that calcium channel blockers can reduce the accumulation of atherogenic lesion components and thus apparently decrease the progression of lesions (Weinstein, D. B., 1988). Verapamil has been proposed to be effective in early stages of atherogenic lesion formation to decrease aortic lesion area in cholesterol fed rabbits (Sievers R., et al., 1987). There are essentially no effects of calcium antagonists on lipoprotein composition or concentrations (Trost et al., 1987). It does not appear, therefore, that calcium antagonists are working by reducing lipid levels. Interactions of calcium channel blockers, however, with lipoprotein metabolic pathways cannot be ignored as a major potential mechanism for altering cholesterol accumulation and the atherogenic state (Weinstein D. B., 1988). It could be shown that Verapamil and Diltiazem could decrease the rate of low density lipoprotein (LDL) degradation in human skin fibroblast cultures (Ranganathon S., et al., 1982) and that Verapamil increased receptor mediated clearance of LDL from cell surfaces but also caused a delay in lysosomal degradation of LDL (Stein O., et al. 1985). How does an calcium blocker lead to an increase of LDL-receptor activity in fibroblasts? We have suggested that calcium antagonists increase the LDL-receptor activity by eliciting an increase in the mRNA for LDL-receptors. It has now become possible to test this hypothesis through the use of cDNA probes for the LDL-receptor (Ma, et al., 1986). We have shown that both calcium entry blockers Verapamil and Diltiazem increase the apparent rate of the synthesis and the endocytic capacity of the LDL-receptors in human skin fibroblasts (Filipovic et al., 1986a).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "40": "1. The effect of chronic amineptine treatment (200mg/day) on beta-adrenoceptor density of intact mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) was examined in unmedicated major unipolar depressed patients. 2. Pretreatment parameters of (-)-[125I]-iodopindolol specific binding did not differ significantly from age- and sex-matched healthy controls as the patients were only moderately depressed. 3. All patients showed a highly significant clinical improvement as assessed by the AMDP-depression scale after one week of amineptine (D7), while 2 patients relapsed after one month of treatment (D28) and were considered to be non-responders. 4. The maximal density of beta-adrenoceptors (Bmax) was significantly decreased at D7 (by 33%) compared to pretreatment level (D0) in the treatment responders and remained lower at D28, although the difference was no longer significant. No alteration in beta-receptor affinity (Kd) was detected during the treatment. 5. These results indicate that treatment with amineptine, an antidepressant drug known to selectively inhibit the dopamine uptake system, can rapidly affect MNL beta-adrenoceptors. 6. Moreover, the present findings show that the reduction in MNL beta-adrenoceptor density, which is associated with a stable clinical improvement, may provide a predictive index for successful antidepressant treatment.",

    "42": "Noradrenaline (NA) has been implicated as a neuromodulator in plasticity, presumably facilitating adaptive processes. Since the flocculus receives noradrenergic afferents, and ablation of the flocculus interferes with the normal adaptive changes in the VOR gain, experiments were performed to find out whether bilateral injection of monoaminergic substances into the flocculus of rabbits could modify the adaptive changes of the VOR. The visual world surrounding the rabbit was oscillated in opposite direction to the platform on which the rabbit was mounted, which resulted in an adaptive increase in the VOR gain; this adaptation was measured either in light or in darkness. Floccular injection of the beta-agonist isoproterenol did not greatly affect the adaptation of the VOR measured in light. In darkness, however, the increase in gain after injection of isoproterenol was larger than during normal adaptation. The beta-antagonist sotalol reduced the adaptation of the VOR gain significantly in light as well as in darkness. In a control condition without pressure for adaptation (only intermittent testing of the VOR gain over a period of 2.5 h), the gain of the VOR was not significantly affected by similar injections of beta-adrenergic agents. We conclude that the noradrenergic system facilitates the adaptation of the VOR gain to retinal slip in rabbits without affecting the VOR gain directly. At least part of this influence is exerted through beta-receptors located in the cerebellar flocculus.", 
    "43": "The present work was undertaken to characterize the role of serotonin in the regulation of beta-adrenoceptors utilizing isoprenaline-induced water drinking in the rat. For this purpose, a serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (24.3 mg/kg/day, PO), the serotonin neuronal uptake blockers, trazodone (18.5 mg/kg/day, PO), or zimelidine (14.6 mg/kg/day, PO) or a serotonin agonist, quipazine (12.6 mg/kg/day, PO) were administered either alone or in combination with imipramine for a period of 4 days. While none of these drugs alone showed any significant effect in attenuating the effects of isoprenaline-induced water drinking, their co- administration with imipramine did produce a significant reduction in isoprenaline-induced drinking. Simultaneous injection of the serotonin synthesis inhibitor, p-chlorophenylalanine (200 mg/kg/day, IP), has resulted in blockade of this acceleration of desensitization of beta-adrenoceptors produced by the subacute co-administration of trazodone or quipazine with imipramine. The selective 5HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (4 mg/kg/day/ IP) significantly inhibited the attenuation of the isoprenaline-induced drinking attained by the co-administration of quipazine with imipramine, while methysergide (2 mg/kg/day, IP) which blocks both 5HT1 and 5HT2 receptors failed to produce a significant effect on this response. These results indicate that the inhibition of the synaptosomal uptake of serotonin by quipazine seems to be more pertinent than its serotoninergic agonistic effect in the desensitization of central beta-adrenoceptors in the rat. Thus, it can be concluded that noradrenaline and serotonin are both required for the process of the desensitization of central beta-adrenoceptor systems by antidepressants.", 
    "44": "Computer competition analysis of 3H-DHA (3H-dihydroalprenolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic radioligand) binding in the presence of unlabeled metoprolol (a beta 1-selective antagonist) indicates the existence of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes in the rat placenta and confirms previous reports that both beta-adrenoceptors are present in adult rat cortex. In the fetal brain (20th day of gestation), however, only beta 1-receptors were detected. Pregnant rats were chronically exposed to methadone from day 7 to day 20 of gestation via implanted osmotic minipumps (6.3-9.0 mg/kg/day). This treatment schedule did not induce a change in the affinity and density of either beta-receptor subtype in the placental, fetal and maternal brain homogenates. The results are discussed in terms of the reported monoaminergic and opiate receptor functional interactions.", 
    "45": "The effect of increasing doses of intravenously administered propranolol on electrophysiological features of heart was studied in 17 patients with untreated hyperthyroidism by using the transesophageal stimulation method. A positive and dose-dependent effect of propranolol on the studied parameters was found with the normalization of the majority of disturbances taking place after the administration of 6 mg of propranolol. This dose was safe and well tolerated by the patients. The sensitivity of the auriculo-ventricular junction to propranolol was less pronounced during the stimulated rhythm than during the sinus rhythm.", 
    "46": "An involvement of prostaglandin synthesis in reduced insulin secretion by interleukin-1 was investigated in adrenalectomized (ADX) rats. The recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) significantly reduced insulin secretion in ADX rats 2 and 4 hr after the injection, although IL-1 stimulated insulin secretion in intact rats. In ADX rat, IL-1 showed dose-dependent inhibition of pancreatic insulin secretion. In addition, insulin response to intravenous glucose loading was also attenuated in ADX rats with pretreatment by IL-1. At 4 hours after injection, ibuprofen (IBP; 0.5-50.0 mg/kg, ip), selective cyclooxygenase blocker, attenuated insulin inhibition by IL-1 in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that IL-1 may suppress in vivo insulin release at least in part through the mediation of prostaglandin synthesis in the absence of adrenal glands.", 
    "47": "Although diuretics and beta-blockers are efficient in treating high blood pressure and in decreasing the occurrence of strokes, these therapeutics have deleterious effects concerning lipidic metabolism, therefore worsening another cardiovascular risk factor. A comparative study evaluates the effects of prazosin and atenolol on plasmatic lipids of hypertensive patients. The results of this study confirm that prazosin can avoid an increase in plasmatic lipids. This therapy could therefore be prescribed to improve the ratio risk/benefit of the hypertensive therapy.", 
    "48": "We have shown previously that the major source of diglyceride (DG) formed following muscarinic receptor (mAChR) stimulation of 1321N1 astrocytoma cells is phosphatidylcholine (PC) rather than the phosphoinositides (Martinson, E. A., Goldstein, D., and Brown, J. H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14748-14754). We have also noted that there is a delay of several minutes before significant DG accumulation is observed. In the present work, we examine the time course and mechanism of PC hydrolysis in response to mAChR stimulation. Treatment of 1321N1 cells with carbachol results in increases in radiolabeled choline, phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylethanol (PEt), metabolites that are products of phospholipase D (PLD) action on PC. These products are all formed within 15 s of mAChR stimulation and reach a plateau within 30-60 s. The time course of PEt formation suggests that PLD is no longer activated after several minutes of mAChR stimulation. Thus there is a discrepancy between the rapid and transient activation of PLD and the delayed accumulation of DG. It appears that most of the DG is formed through the action of PLD, since propranolol (which inhibits the conversion of PA to DG) and down-regulation of protein kinase C (which prevents activation of PLD by carbachol) both markedly inhibit DG production. Using a protocol in which cells are stimulated with carbachol for only one minute (a period during which PLD and PA formation are maximally activated), we show that DG mass continues to increase following removal of agonist. We suggest that the rapid and transient activation of PLD results in delayed accumulation of DG due to the relatively slow conversion of PA to DG by PA phosphatase.", 
    "49": "To study the regulation of insulin gene expression by physiological regulators, primary cultures of rat islet cells were transfected with portions of the rat insulin I gene 5'-flanking sequence linked to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Incubation of the cells in increasing glucose concentrations led to a parallel increase in both CAT activity and CAT mRNA levels. Pretreatment of the cells with the beta-cell-specific toxin streptozotocin reduced CAT activity 97%. Beta-Cell-specific expression of CAT was also demonstrated by co-staining the transfected cells with antisera to both CAT and insulin. Experiments showing a reduction in the response to glucose in the presence of the calcium channel blocker verapamil suggest that calcium plays a role in the glucose response, possibly via regulation of factors interacting with this limited portion of the insulin gene.", 
    "50": "In studies performed on cells isolated from the subendothelial intimal layer of both normal and atherosclerotic human aortas, cells from atherosclerotic lesions retained atherosclerotic properties while in primary culture, including enhanced proliferative activity and high lipid level. The content and composition of lipids in cultured cells remained unchanged for the first 10 to 12 days in culture and corresponded to the respective indices in freshly isolated cells. When added to an atherosclerotic cell culture, the calcium antagonist verapamil reduced the total intracellular cholesterol level by threefold and inhibited proliferation and collagen synthesis by cultured cells within 48 hours. Of the 12 calcium antagonists tested, verapamil and nifedipine demonstrated the greatest antiatherosclerotic activity. In contrast, nitrates had no effect on atherosclerotic parameters, while beta blockers increased atherosclerotic manifestations of cultured cells. In studies in which plasma was added to cell cultures, 2 to 4 hours after patients received oral nifedipine or verapamil, their plasma prompted antiatherosclerotic responses from cell cultures by reduced intracellular cholesterol and inhibited atherosclerotic cell proliferation. Plasma of patients who received oral propranolol, however, demonstrated atherogenic characteristics. The atherogenic properties of propranolol were inhibited by nitroglycerin and nifedipine. Use of the atherosclerotic cell model allows the examination of the atherogenic and antiatherogenic properties of various drugs, thus possibly optimizing antiatherosclerotic therapy.", 
    "51": "Recent evidence indicates that a major fraction of diacylglycerol that is produced in hormonally stimulated cells arises by phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis via the sequential action of phospholipase D and phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP). We have previously reported that sphingoid bases stimulate phospholipase D activity in NG108-15 cells. The evidence presented here demonstrates that in sphingosine-treated NG108-15 cells, elevated phosphatidic acid levels are accompanied by a parallel, time- and dose-dependent decrease in diacylglycerol levels. DL-propranolol, a known inhibitor of PAP, exerted similar effects, suggesting that the action of sphingosine may have been due to inhibition of PAP activity. This prediction was confirmed in in vitro experiments in which it was demonstrated that sphingosine is as potent an inhibitor of both cytosolic and membrane-associated PAP activity as propranolol. The hypothesis that sphingoid bases may exert a dual action in diacylglycerol signal termination is proposed.", 
    "52": "A stimulation of glycogenolysis in astrocytes by adrenergic agonists has repeatedly been demonstrated in the literature. However, some confusion exists regarding which type of adrenergic receptor subtype is involved, and little information is available about rates of glycogenolysis and potencies of adrenergic agonists. In the present study, we have investigated these parameters using primary cultures of mouse astrocytes which constitute a reliable model for their in vivo counterparts. Antagonists as well as agonist studies revealed that noradrenaline acts both on a beta- and on an alpha 2-receptor. Isoproterenol and clonidine, agonists acting relatively specifically on only one of these receptor subtypes could, on their own, stimulate glycogenolysis and the effect by noradrenaline could be inhibited by alprenolol (beta-adrenergic antagonist) and/or yohimbine (alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist) but not by prazosin (alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist). Excess potassium also stimulated glycogenolysis but this effect was not antagonized by adrenergic antagonists, alone or in combination. The involvement of an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor in a homogeneous culture of astrocytes provides proof that not all alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in brain are presynaptic. The maximum rate of stimulated glycogenolysis was calculated to be 3-7 nmol/min per mg protein. Computer analysis showed that the EC50 values for noradrenaline, isoproterenol and clonidine were 4.6 x 10(-8) M, 3.0 x 10(-7) M, and 6.5 x 10(-7) M, respectively.", 
    "53": "In our previous report (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 165(3), 1221-1228, 1989), we have demonstrated the biphasic increase of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca++]i) induced by angiotensin II (ANG II) in isolated rat early proximal tubule (S1). The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of HgCl2 on ANG II-induced [Ca++]i increase using Fura-2. HgCl2 (10(-10) M2-10(-8) M) potentiated the [Ca++]i increase induced by ANG II (10(-11) M) in a dose-dependent manner. To determine the mechanism of stimulatory effect by HgCl2 on ANG II-induced [Ca++]i increase, nephron segments were pretreated with 10(-4) M propranolol, a phospholipase C inhibitor. The stimulatory effect by 10(-9) M HgCl2 in 10(-11) M ANG II-induced [Ca++]i increase was completely inhibited by propranolol. Moreover, 10(-4) M propranolol completely blocked the stimulatory effect of HgCl2 on ANG II-mediated IP3 production. This study suggests for the first time that HgCl2 stimulates the [Ca++]i increment induced by ANG II, possibly through an activation of phospholipase C.", 
    "54": "We have developed a replica filter assay that permits the direct identification of bacterial colonies expressing membrane receptors. E.coli transformed with appropriate phage or plasmid vectors containing human beta-adrenergic receptor cDNAs were grown on LB/agar plates. Bacterial colonies transferred onto nitrocellulose filters showed specific [125I]-iodocyanopindolol binding. beta-adrenergic receptors expressed in bacteria retained their pharmacological properties when transferred onto filters. This strategy, which is considerably simplified and more rapid compared to similar methods based upon expression of receptor genes in eukaryotic cells, may be a useful tool for cloning membrane receptors.", 
    "55": "The influence of Ca2+ on the activity of the taurine transport system was investigated in rabbit small intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles. Preincubation of the brush-border membrane vesicles with Ca2+ prepared by the Mg2(+)-aggregation method markedly decreased the NaCl gradient-dependent uptake of taurine in these vesicles. Uptake of glucose and alanine, both dependent on a Na+ gradient, were also decreased by Ca2(+)-treatment, but their reduction was very small compared with that of taurine uptake. The inhibitory effect of Ca2+ was dose- and time-dependent. The inhibition was reduced by the presence of ethylene glycol-bis(beta-amino ethyl ether)-N,N,N'-N'-tetraacetic acid during treatment of the membrane vesicles with Ca2+. Neomycin partially protected the taurine transporter activity from the Ca2(+)-induced inhibition, but indomethacin did not. 5-Nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoate, a Cl(-)-channel blocker, did not increase taurine uptake in the Ca2(+)-treated membrane vesicles. It is concluded that the Ca2(+)-induced inhibition of taurine uptake in rabbit intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles is not due to accelerated dissipation of the ion gradient driving forces across the membrane but rather to a direct effect on the transporter, most likely mediated by the activation of the membrane-bound phospholipase C.", 
    "56": "Analytical methods for the determination of betaxolol and two of its metabolites in blood and urine are described. Betaxolol, alpha-hydroxybetaxolol, and the acid metabolite were extracted, with over 65% efficiency, from biological samples by liquid-liquid extraction methods. Analysis was performed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection. N,N-Dimethyloctylamine (0.005 M) was used to improve the chromatography of betaxolol and alpha-hydroxybetaxolol, while acetic acid (1%) was used for the acid metabolite. An excitation wavelength of 200 nm was found to produce the best detector response. Linear standard curves were obtained for all three compounds with detection limits (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) varying between 1 and 10 ng/ml. The coefficients of variation of the determination for all three compounds in blood and urine varied between 3.0 and 8.7%. The metabolism of betaxolol was studied in twelve healthy male subjects. The amounts (mean +/- S.D.) of betaxolol, alpha-hydroxybetaxolol and the acid metabolite renally excreted in the first 48 h after intravenous administration of 10 mg of betaxolol hydrochloride are 17.1 +/- 6.2, 0.4 +/- 0.1 and 14.5 +/- 3.7%, respectively, of the administered dose.", 
    "57": "Isoproterenol is sometimes required for ventricular tachycardia (VT) induction. However, the role of beta-blockade for treatment of such VT has not been critically assessed. The use of beta-blockade was evaluated prospectively in 14 consecutive patients who required isoproterenol 2.4 +/- 1.3 (+/- S.D.) micrograms/min to induce sustained monomorphic VT (greater than 30 seconds, or requiring termination due to hemodynamic collapse) after a negative baseline study. The VT mechanisms were enhanced automaticity (group A, six patients), triggered automaticity (group B, three patients), and reentry (group C, five patients). Groups A and B had serial intravenous electropharmacologic tests with propranolol alone (0.2 mg/kg), verapamil alone (0.15 mg/kg), and propranolol plus verapamil, and group C had serial tests with propranolol alone, procainamide or quinidine (class Ia drug) alone, and propranolol plus a class Ia drug until VT could no longer be induced. All six patients in group A responded to propranolol alone. In group B, one patient responded to verapamil alone, and two patients responded to propranolol plus verapamil. In group C, three patients responded to propranolol alone, one patient responded to a class Ia drug alone, and one patient responded to propranolol plus a class Ia drug. During a follow-up of 7 to 37 (17.9 +/- 10.7) (+/- S.D.) months, VT has not recurred in any patient. Three patients treated initially with propranolol alone have required substitution of amiodarone due to refractory congestive heart failure. In patients requiring isoproterenol for VT induction, beta-blockade alone appears to be effective in preventing reinduction of VT caused by enhanced automaticity. A heterogeneous response occurs when the VT mechanisms are triggered automaticity or reentry.", 
    "58": "Basal and drug-induced levels of cAMP were determined in cortical slices from mice which were homozygous for the tottering (tg/tg) gene defect as well as from co-isogenic controls (+/+). Basal levels of cAMP were 77 +/- 16% higher in tg/tg slices compared to the controls. This difference was abolished by exposure of the slices to propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Both isoproterenol and veratridine stimulated cAMP formation, but only small differences were observed in the cAMP levels in tg/tg and +/+ slices after this treatment. Of the veratridine-dependent increase in cAMP, approximately 40% was blocked by propranolol treatment of slices from both strains. The results suggest that a higher level of endogenous norepinephrine release in tottering mice contributes to an elevation of basal cAMP levels.", 
    "59": "Gerbils treated with various noradrenergic compounds were pinealectomized (PINX) or sham-operated (SHAM) and observed for convulsive activity. Although declines in cortical and hypothalamic norepinephrine content were found after alpha-methylparatyrosine (alpha MPT) or PINX, treatment with alpha MPT did not produce convulsions in SHAM gerbils or in gerbils which were PINX one week earlier. Likewise, alpha MPT did not increase the number or severity of convulsions observed in acutely PINX gerbils. Treatment with propranolol or isoproterenol did not have any effect on convulsive activity of PINX gerbils, except that isoproterenol increased the excitability of all the gerbils. In conclusion, reducing catecholamine content or modifying beta-noradrenergic receptor activity was not able to alter the convulsive activity which occurs after acute PINX.", 
    "60": "We found that vanadate-induced 45Ca2+ uptake by red cells is maximal at 25 degrees C. At this temperature, the Cai-induced increase of the K+ permeability (the G\u00e1rdos effect) shows a lag (up to 8 min) which is not observed at 37 degrees C. This cannot be explained by the lack of availability of Ca2+ for the Ca2(+)-activated K+ channel, and suggests that its activation by Ca2+ is mediated by a temperature-dependent mechanism which remains unknown so far. The lag is not observed when the G\u00e1rdos effect was initiated by propranolol. This shows that the putative temperature-dependent step is different from chloride transport.", 
    "61": "The effects of isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, on cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in rat parotid acinar cells were examined using the fluorescent Ca2(+)-indicator fura-2. At concentrations up to 1 mM, ISO caused a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner, while addition of 1 microM ISO, which evokes the maximum amylase secretion, had only a slight effect on [Ca2+]i. There was no such increase in [Ca2+]i with the addition (2 mM) of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, a permeant cyclic AMP analogue. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine blocked the ISO-induced [Ca2+]i increase better than the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranol, and the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine. The IC50 value (the concentration which reduces the ISO-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by 50%) of phentolamine was estimated to be 7.6 nM, for propranolol 13.2 microM and for atropine 3.5 microM. The difference in potency between the three antagonists was similar to the difference in blocking the [Ca2+]i increase induced by phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist. These results suggest that the Ca2(+)-mobilization in response to high concentrations of ISO results from an activation of alpha-adrenoceptors rather than beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "62": "Selective 5-HT1A receptor agonists such as 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin), flesinoxan, 5-methylurapidil and others, increased locomotor behaviour in rats following s.c. injection. Unfortunately, all available 5-HT1A receptor antagonists are non-selective, a fact which severely hampers their use. The inhibitory effects of (+)- and (-)-pindolol (1-10 mg/kg, -45 min s.c.) on locomotion induced by 8-OH-DPAT were investigated in rats pretreated with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, ICI 118,551 and betaxolol (both 1 mg/kg, -45 min s.c.). ICI 118,551 and betaxolol significantly enhanced the response to 8-OH-DPAT. Co-administration of (-)-pindolol (2-10 mg/kg) dose dependently antagonised the hyperlocomotion whereas (+)-pindolol was weakly effective at 10 mg/kg. The partial agonists ipsapirone (1-10 mg/kg, -45 min s.c.) and buspirone (0.1-1 mg/kg, -45 min) antagonised the effects of 8-OH-DPAT. This inhibition may, however, be due to alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade and DA receptor antagonism, respectively. Finally, although spiroxatrine (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, -45 min s.c.) inhibited the response to 8-OH-DPAT, this inhibition may also be non-specific since spiroxatrine strongly reduced spontaneous locomotor activity. In conclusion, whilst much of our data is consistent with 8-OH-DPAT-induced locomotion being mediated by 5-HT1A receptors, only the data obtained with the pindolol enantiomers provide direct evidence for this. The results also suggest that, under normal circumstances, the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist effect of pindolol may be masked by the facilitating effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "63": "We examined the effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol and pindolol, on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction using isolated, blood-perfused dog lung lobes. Pindolol markedly inhibited the development of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, whereas propranolol had no effect. The different role of the drugs on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is discussed.", 
    "64": "Prescriptions and costs of pharmacotherapy for exertional angina pectoris were studied in males treated in 1975, 1980 or 1985 at the outpatient clinic of the university of Z\u00fcrich. Monotherapy was increasingly replaced by two drug regimens (1975 43%, 1980 59%, 1985 35%) or by triple therapy (1975 2%, 1980 10%, 1985 28%) respectively. In 1985 beta-blocking agents and calcium antagonists were more frequently used instead of nitrates in monotherapy. In combined treatment modalities, nitrates associated with calcium antagonists or calcium antagonists combined with beta blockers were used increasingly in 1985. The most used substances in 1985 were isosorbide dinitrate, atenolol and nifedipine. In 1985 nonselective beta blockers (propranolol, pindolol) were administered almost exclusively. The number of tablets administered per day decreased slightly over the years, while the doses of most commonly prescribed drugs increased. The cost per patient doubled during the observation period. Pharmacotherapy of stable angina calculated on the basis of 1985 pharmacy prices rose from 577 SFr. in 1975 to 1180 SFr. in 1985.", 
    "65": "The effects of MDL 73005EF (8-[2-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-2-yl)methylamino]-8- azaspiro[4,5]decan-7,9-dione methyl sulphonate), a novel selective 5-HT1A receptor ligand with putative anxiolytic properties, were explored using models of central pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor function in the male rat. MDL 73005EF dose dependently decreased the hippocampal 5-HT output measured by in vivo microdialysis in chloral hydrate-anaesthetised rats and this response was antagonised by the 5-HT1A/B receptor antagonist, pindolol. Local administration of MDL 73005EF had no effect on the hippocampal 5-HT output. MDL 73005EF failed to alter basal plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) levels but, in common with pindolol, attenuated the ACTH response to the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). In contrast to 8-OH-DPAT, MDL 73005EF significantly increased plasma prolactin but apparently not through a 5-HT receptor-mediated mechanism. The results indicate that MDL 73005EF possesses mixed 5-HT1A receptor agonist/antagonist properties, acting as an agonist at presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors controlling 5-HT release and as an antagonist at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors mediating ACTH release.", 
    "66": "Twenty patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (11 males and 9 females) aged from 14 to 54 (37.3 +/- 10.5) years were treated orally with metoprolol (dose 37.5 mg-100 mg/day, mean 91 +/- 18.6 mg/day) after a baseline hemodynamic study. On follow-up, all patients showed improvement in symptomatic status by at least one NYHA class within 2 to 4 weeks of the initiation of therapy. Repeat right heart study and left ventricular angiography (venous digital subtraction angiography) afer 3 to 6 months of treatment in 10 patients showed a fall in the mean pulmonary arterial wedge pressure from 24.4 +/- 9.6 to 12.8 +/- 7.7 mm Hg (P = 0.025), right ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 8.8 +/- 4.7 mm Hg to 4.5 +/- 1.9 mm Hg (P = 0.025) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure from 34.2 +/- 12.4 mm Hg to 25.9 +/- 10.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). There was no significant change in the left ventricular ejection fraction (18.7 +/- 1.6% vs. 22 +/- 0.48%, P = NS) or cardiac index (2.2 +/- 0.48 l/m/m2 to 2.12 +/- 0.68 l/m/m2, P = NS). These hemodynamic results indicate that the improvement in symptoms and congestive cardiac failure produced by treatment with metoprolol in patients having dilated cardiomyopathy is related to improvement in diastolic function of the myocardium.", 
    "67": "Felodipine, a new antihypertensive calcium antagonist, was compared with metoprolol, a beta-blocker, and hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, with respect to glucose tolerance in a randomized double-blind cross-over study consisting of 11 patients, of age range 50-70 years, who had developed diabetes during antihypertensive treatment. Each treatment period lasted for 10 weeks. The blood pressure was similar irrespective of treatment. Serum glucose levels during the oral glucose tolerance test were significantly lower when the patients were treated with felodipine than when they were taking hydrochlorothiazide. Serum insulin levels appeared to decrease at an earlier stage of the test when the patients were treated with felodipine, the calcium antagonist, than with the other two antihypertensive substances, which suggests that glucose tolerance is impaired to a lesser extent during treatment with the calcium antagonist. Glucose tolerance was never completely normalized with any of the drugs tested.", 
    "68": "Peripheral nerve from experimentally diabetic rats exhibits lowered levels of myo-inositol (MI) and decreased incorporation of [3H]MI into phosphatidylinositol (PI). There are indications that diminished PI turnover may be causally related to reduced Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity in diabetic nerve. We have investigated whether a metabolic compartment of MI that is essential for PI synthesis is decreased in this tissue. Sciatic nerve segments from streptozotocin-induced diabetic and age-matched normal rats were incubated in vitro with either 32Pi or [3H]cytidine in the presence of propranolol. This cationic amphiphilic agent redirected nerve phospholipid metabolism to produce enhanced 32P incorporation into PI and decreased labeling of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine. The accumulation of phosphatidyl CMP (CMP-PA) was also demonstrated by chromatographic and enzymatic means. The incorporation of [3H]cytidine into CMP-PA in normal nerve increased up to 15-fold when 0.6 mM propranolol was present. In diabetic nerve, the liponucleotide incorporated 2- to 3-fold more isotope and was more readily labeled at lower drug concentrations as compared to normal nerve. The buildup of [3H]CMP-PA was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of MI in the incubation medium at concentrations up to 3 mM. However, if MI was added after liponucleotide accumulation, preformed CMP-PA could not be utilized for PI synthesis. The difference in liponucleotide labeling between normal and diabetic nerve was nearly abolished at 0.3 mM medium MI, a concentration much less than the level of cyclitol in the tissue. These results strongly suggest the presence in nerve of a pool of MI that is not in equilibrium with the bulk of nerve MI and that is preferentially used for PI synthesis. This metabolic compartment is depleted in diabetic nerve but can be readily replenished by exogenous MI and may correspond to the MI pool that has been proposed to be required for the turnover of a portion of tissue PI involved in maintenance of normal Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity.", 
    "69": "The role of the central noradrenergic systems and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in modulating defensive withdrawal behavior was studied in rats. The apparatus consisted of a small chamber set on one side of a one-meter open field, into which the rat was placed to start the test. When rats were unfamiliar with the apparatus, they displayed species typical defensive withdrawal behavior with long latencies to emerge from and a high proportion of time spent in the small chamber. Intraperitoneal administration of clonidine (0.03 mg/kg), l-propranolol (2.5 micrograms/kg), prazosin (0.1 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5 mg/kg) each significantly decreased the latency to emerge from and the mean time spent in the small chamber (MTIC) and increased the number of chamber entries. When rats were familiar with the apparatus, prior restraint for 20 min significantly increased the latency and MTIC, and decreased the number of chamber entries and rears, but did not alter locomotor activity. Prazosin, clonidine, CDP, l-propranolol and the CRF-antagonist, alpha-helical CRF9-41 (25 micrograms i.c.v.), reversed the restraint-induced increase in the latency and MTIC. CRF (10-100 ng i.c.v.) dose-dependently induced defensive withdrawal behavior in rats familiar with the apparatus; the minimum statistically significant dose was 50 ng. dl-Propranolol (5 mg/kg) and CDP blocked the CRF-induced changes in the latency to emerge and the MTIC; whereas clonidine and prazosin significantly reduced the latency, but had no statistically significant effects on the MTIC. Phenylephrine (25-200 ng i.c.v.) dose-dependently induced defensive withdrawal behavior. This effect of phenylephrine (200 ng) was significantly antagonized by prazosin or alpha-helical CRF9-41 (25 or 50 mg i.c.v.), but not by CDP. Our results suggest that the hyperactivity of the central noradrenergic systems caused by exposure to the novel environment may stimulate the release of CRF, which through some unknown mechanism induces defensive withdrawal behavior in rats. Activation of beta adrenergic receptors may also induce defensive withdrawal.", 
    "70": "Labetalol, a drug with alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking effects, was used to attenuate hypertension and tachycardia associated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in a series of 11 elderly patients with refractory depression and cardiovascular disease in a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study design. As compared with placebo, labetalol was found to blunt mean arterial pressure (MAP) increase by up to 8.26% (p less than .001), heart rate increased by up to 26.07% (p less than .001), frequency of atrial arrhythmias by up to 100% (p less than .01), and premature ventricular contractions by 41.97%. No untoward side effects were observed, and no effect on treatment outcome was noted. Labetalol appears to be an effective and safe agent to use in decreasing hypertension, tachycardia, and possibly arrhythmias in high-risk medical patients with cardiovascular disease undergoing ECT.", 
    "71": "Propranolol and endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices are the two approaches currently used in prophylaxis of the first gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the cirrhotic patient. One hundred twenty-six cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices and no histories of bleeding were included in the trial regardless of the gravity of the cirrhosis or the size of the esophageal varices. Patients with hepatocarcinomas or other cancers, clearly impossible follow-up, previous treatment for portal hypertension or contraindication to beta-blockers were excluded. After randomization, 43 patients received propranolol twice daily at a dose reducing the heart rate by 25%; 42 patients were treated with intravariceal and extravariceal injections of Polidocanol; 41 control patients received vitamin K orally as placebo. The patients were seen at 3-mo intervals for 2 yr. On entry to the trial the three groups were comparable in terms of clinical and biological parameters, including size of esophageal varices (grade I = 51, grade II = 54, grade III = 17), Child-Pugh classification (A = 29, B = 61, C = 32) and the origin of cirrhosis (alcoholic in 79% of cases). Twenty-four patients bled (two bled in the propranolol group, nine bled in the endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices group and 13 bled in the placebo group). Actuarial estimates (Kaplan-Meier) of the time of onset of first bleeding showed that the differences were significant between propranolol and placebo (p less than 0.004) and between propranolol and sclerotherapy (p less than 0.03) but not between sclerotherapy and placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "To determine the extent of persisting hyperlipidemia in renal transplant recipients receiving modern maintenance immunosuppressive and antihypertensive therapy we compared plasma levels of total and high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride in 275 renal transplant recipients with stable graft function with age- and sex-matched groups from the local general population (n = 4055). Total cholesterol and triglyceride were higher in transplanted patients in all age groups, but the difference was much more striking in women. Plasma levels of HDL cholesterol were similar or slightly lower in transplanted patients. Association with parameters of graft function, immunosuppressive therapy, and antihypertensive therapy were studied within the transplanted population using multiple regression. Total cholesterol was significantly and independently associated with age, sex, diuretic therapy, and urinary protein. In 127/134 (95%) of patients the diuretic was a loop diuretic. None of the other classes of antihypertensive drug was independently associated with serum cholesterol. The only variables significantly associated with HDL cholesterol were sex and the plasma creatinine. Plasma triglyceride was significantly and independently associated with both diuretic therapy and beta-blocker therapy and with age, urinary protein excretion, and plasma albumin. Plasma cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were almost identical in patients receiving triple therapy (cyclosporine 3-5 mg/kg; prednisolone 7-10 mg o.d.; azathioprine 1-1.5 mg/kg) to those in patients receiving conventional immunosuppression (prednisolone 7-10 mg o.d.; azathioprine 2-2.5 mg/kg). Thus these results do not support the existence of a persisting long-term effect of cyclosporine on plasma cholesterol and triglyceride at these doses of the drug. The more striking abnormality of plasma cholesterol and triglyceride in females is unexplained but might be connected with greater sensitivity to low doses of corticosteroids.", 
    "73": "Successful pancreas transplantation in type I diabetic patients restores normal fasting glucose levels and biphasic insulin responses to glucose. However, virtually no data from pancreas recipients are available relative to other islet hormonal responses or hormonal counterregulation of hypoglycemia. Consequently, glucose, glucagon, catecholamine, and pancreatic polypeptide responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and to stimulation with arginine and secretin were examined in 38 diabetic pancreas recipients, 54 type I diabetic nonrecipients, and 26 nondiabetic normal control subjects. Glucose recovery after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in pancreas recipients was significantly improved. Basal glucagon levels were significantly higher in recipients compared with nonrecipients and normal subjects. Glucagon responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were significantly greater in the pancreas recipients compared with nonrecipients and similar to that observed in control subjects. Glucagon responses to intravenous arginine were significantly greater in pancreas recipients than that observed in both the nonrecipients and normal subjects. No differences were observed in epinephrine responses during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. No differences in pancreatic polypeptide responses to hypoglycemia were observed when comparing the recipient and nonrecipient groups, both of which were less than that observed in the control subjects. Our data demonstrate significant improvement in glucose recovery after hypoglycemia which was associated with improved glucagon secretion in type I diabetic recipients of pancreas transplantation.", 
    "74": "The purpose of this multicenter investigation was to determine the efficacy and safety of the alpha/beta-blocker labetalol versus the beta 1-selective beta-blocker atenolol in white and black patients with essential hypertension. Equal numbers of black and white patients were enlisted to form four treatment groups (white patients taking either labetalol or atenolol and black patients taking either labetalol or atenolol). Two hundred ninety-two patients (152 white and 140 black patients) with essential hypertension characterized by a standing diastolic blood pressure of 105 to 119 mm Hg (inclusive) were recruited for this trial. Patients were randomized to either labetalol (dosage titrated from 200 to 1600 mg/day) or atenolol (dosage titrated from 50 to 100 mg/day). The therapeutic goal was achievement of a standing diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less or a fall of 15 mm Hg in diastolic pressure from baseline value at the end of the placebo run in period. At the end of the study there were no significant differences in blood pressure or heart rate changes in the supine position between the labetalol and atenolol groups. In contrast, labetalol produced greater reduction in both the standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-12/-13 mm Hg, respectively) compared with atenolol (-7/-9 mm Hg; p less than 0.05; p less than 0.005, respectively). The greatest decrease in blood pressure was observed in white patients receiving labetalol. In black patients the decrease in blood pressure was greater in those treated with labetalol compared with atenolol, particularly with respect to the systolic blood pressure. We conclude that the alpha 1-blocking property of labetalol provides an additional lowering of the blood pressure over that seen with beta 1-blockade alone, especially in the standing position, and this enhanced efficacy is not confined to one radical group.", 
    "75": "The effect of selective blockade of cellular glucose transporters, Ca2+ influx, and mitochondrial oxygen consumption on thyroxine (T4)-stimulated oxygen consumption and glucose uptake was examined in human mononuclear blood cells. Blockade of glucose transporters by cytochalasin B (1 x 10(-5) mol/L) and of Ca2+ influx by alprenolol (1 x 10(-5) mol/L) and verapamil (4 x 10(-4) mol/L) inhibited T4-activated glucose uptaken and reduced T4-stimulated oxygen consumption by 20%. Uncoupling of mitochondrial oxygen consumption by azide (1 x 10(-3) mol/L) inhibited T4-stimulated oxygen consumption, but had no effect on glucose uptake. We conclude that T4-stimulated glucose uptake in human mononuclear blood cells is dependent on intact glucose transporters and Ca2+ influx, but not on mitochondrial oxygen consumption. However, oxygen consumption is, in part, dependent on intact glucose uptake.", 
    "76": "Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias are reported in up to 40% of patients early after coronary artery bypass graft operations. In a randomized study, we compared the efficacy and safety of the class III antiarrhythmic beta-blocking drug sotalol versus propranolol at low and high doses in the prevention of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in 429 consecutive patients after coronary artery bypass graft operations. Patients with severely depressed left ventricular function and other contraindications for beta-blockers were excluded. From the fourth hour up to the sixth day after coronary artery bypass, 74 patients received low-dose sotalol (40 mg every 8 hours), 66 patients low-dose propranolol (10 mg every 6 hours), 133 patients high-dose sotalol (80 mg every 8 hours), and 156 patients high-dose propranolol (20 mg every 6 hours). Baseline characteristics were comparable in all groups. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia was observed in 10 of 72 (13.9%) who received low-dose sotalol, 12 of 64 (18.8%) who received low-dose propranolol, 13 of 119 (10.9%) who received high-dose sotalol, and 19 of 139 (13.7%) who received high-dose propranolol (not significant). Drug-related adverse effects necessitating discontinuation of the drug occurred in four receiving low doses (2.9%) and in 31 receiving high doses (10.7%) (p less than 0.02). In conclusion, no medication was found to be superior, although supraventricular tachyarrhythmias tended to be less prevalent in patients treated with sotalol than in those treated with propranolol. Moreover, significantly fewer adverse effects were noted in both low-dose groups. Therefore, low-dose beta-blocking treatment, especially low-dose sotalol, seems preferable.", 
    "77": "We compared the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and a conventional antihypertensive regimen (hydralazine and metoprolol) on kidney function, albuminuria, and glomerular ultrastructure in hypertensive diabetic and nondiabetic rats. Diabetes was induced with streptozocin at 8 wk of age in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. Antihypertensive drugs were administered in drinking water from the time of induction of diabetes in all groups. Blood pressure reduction was equal in the diabetic and nondiabetic SHR rats receiving either enalapril or hydralazine plus metoprolol. In diabetic SHR rats, there was a rise in serum creatinine after 32 wk, which did not occur in diabetic rats treated with either antihypertensive regimen or in nondiabetic rats. Both drug regimens reduced albuminuria in diabetic and nondiabetic SHR rats to a similar degree. Enalapril and the combination of hydralazine and metoprolol were associated with decreased glomerular basement membrane thickness and glomerular volume in diabetic and nondiabetic SHR rats without significant effect on fractional mesangial volume. Thus, antihypertensive therapy retards the development of albuminuria, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and glomerular hypertrophy in the rat in the presence or absence of diabetes. No specific benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was observed in these hypertensive models of nephropathy. Human studies comparing the effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on kidney function, proteinuria, and glomerular morphology are warranted.", 
    "78": "The extent to which lipolysis is attenuated during prolonged submaximal exercise during beta blockade was determined in 12 normotensive endurance-trained and 12 hypertensive sedentary men using nonselective drugs with and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Initially, subjects performed a graded treadmill test to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). This was followed by 2-hour walks at 25 and 45% of the subject's VO2max under each of 3 treatments: pindolol (ISA), propranolol (non-ISA) and placebo. The distribution of medication was randomized and double blinded. Blood samples taken at rest and every 30 minutes during the 2-hour walks were analyzed to determine the concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol. On the basis of the respective changes in FFA, glycerols and the respiratory exchange ratio, beta-adrenergic blockade did not attenuate lipolysis in the untrained hypertensive subjects when compared with the placebo administration. However, beta blockade did demonstrate a tendency to attenuate lipolysis in the trained, normotensive subjects when compared with results after placebo administration. This was particularly evident at 30 minutes of exercise, when both glycerol and FFA concentrations were not increased above resting values under both conditions of beta blockade. No differences between pindolol and propranolol were observed. Therefore, a beta-blocking agent with ISA properties appears to have no clear benefit with respect to lipid metabolism during low and moderate intensity exercise. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that beta blockade does not inhibit exercise-induced lipolysis at low and moderate intensities of exercise as formerly believed, and is unlikely to be the cause of fatigue normally observed during work in patient populations taking beta-blocking medication.", 
    "79": "Persons with mental retardation sometimes exhibit behaviors that are difficult to control. Use of neuroleptic medications may be limited by side effects or ineffectiveness. Beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol have been shown to decrease aggressive and impulsive behaviors in some patients with mental retardation.", 
    "80": "This open, parallel-group study compares quinidine and sotalol treatment for maintenance of sinus rhythm after direct current conversion of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. The patients from 15 centers in Sweden were randomized to sotalol (98 patients) or quinidine (85 patients) after 2 hours of sinus rhythm after direct current conversion. According to primary efficacy assessment, 52% of the patients in the sotalol group and 48% of the patients in the quinidine group remained in sinus rhythm during the following 6-month treatment period (NS). Furthermore, 34% of the patients treated with sotalol and 22% of the patients treated with quinidine relapsed into atrial fibrillation (NS). Heart rate after relapsing into atrial fibrillation was higher in the patients treated with quinidine (109 beats/min) than in the patients treated with sotalol (78 beats/min, p less than 0.001). Patients treated with sotalol were found to be less symptomatic at the time of relapse compared with relapsing patients in the quinidine group. In terms of safety, more patients were withdrawn from quinidine than from sotalol treatment (26% vs. 11%, p less than 0.05), and sotalol was generally better tolerated than quinidine. Twenty-eight percent of the patients treated with sotalol and 50% of the patients treated with quinidine reported side effects (p less than 0.01). The difference was primarily a result of early (within the first month of treatment) gastrointestinal and skin side effects in the group of patients treated with quinidine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "Surgical reconstruction is the treatment for acute traumatic aortic rupture and should be accomplished immediately in most patients. In patients in whom concomitant injuries or the development of life-threatening complications preclude safe and successful aortic reconstruction, pharmacological intervention to reduce the risk of free aortic rupture may be considered. Surgical reconstruction can then be more safely performed under controlled elective circumstances.", 
    "82": "The aim of the present investigation was to study the effects of high thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA), including the cardiac sympathetic segments, on ischemic ST-segment changes and left ventricular global and regional wall motion abnormalities. Ten patients with a two- or three-vessel coronary artery disease, all treated with the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol because of severe stable angina pectoris, performed two identical exercise stress tests, the first without TEA (control exercise) and the second with TEA (TEA exercise). Before each stress test, intravenous metoprolol was given to achieve maximal or near maximal beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures (radial artery cannula), heart rate, and rate-pressure product, as well as global and regional ejection fractions, using equilibrium radionuclide angiography in the left anterior oblique projection, were measured at rest and during maximal exercise. ST-segment analysis (V3 or V5) was performed, and the regional wall motion score was calculated at control exercise and TEA exercise. Intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol plus TEA at rest did not cause any significant changes of any of the variables. During TEA exercise, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, and rate-pressure product, but not heart rate, were significantly lower compared to control exercise. The global and anterolateral ejection fractions were significantly higher (52.8% versus 46.5% and 53.2% versus 46.0%, respectively, P less than 0.05), and the regional wall motion score was significantly lower (8.8 versus 11.8, P less than 0.01) during TEA exercise than during control exercise. ST-segment depression was significantly lower during TEA exercise (-1.03 versus -1.84 mV, P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
