However, anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity is also well recognized and can compromise the long-term outcome in some patients. The challenge remains of how to balance the chemotherapeutic effects of anthracycline treatment with its potentially serious cardiovascular complications. Here, we review the pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, prevention, and treatment of anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity.", 
    "1": "Some risk factors and biomarkers associated with an increased probability of anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity have been identified. Modifying the structural forms and dosages of anthracyclines and coadministering cardioprotective agents may prevent some of these cardiotoxic effects. Cardiovascular complications have also been treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, and growth hormone replacement therapy. Cardiac transplantation remains the treatment of last resort.",

The objective of this study was to compare the frequency of relapses in long-term OP treatment with that of short-term OP treatment. This was a retrospective cohort study of 30 patients with complicated IHs who received treatment with OP. Patients were divided into two groups: OP treatment of 8 months or less and OP treatment of longer than 8 months. OP was started at 1 mg/kg/day in three doses every 8 hours for 1 week and increased to 1.5 to 4 mg/kg/day afterward. Ultrasound was used to objectively measure the response to treatment. Clinical and ultrasound assessment showed a decrease in IH size and resolution of complications in all patients (n = 30). In the short-term group (n = 10), nine patients (90%) relapsed after stopping treatment. In the long-term group (n = 20), the duration of treatment was 12 months in all patients, and only 1 patient out of the 20 treated (5%) showed relapse 2 months after finishing the full treatment (odds ratio = 18, 95% confidence interval 2.6, 123, p < 0.001.

Fluorescence detection at 2751305 nm for excitation and emission, respectively, was used. Plasma samples were purified using SPE on Oasis HLB cartridges. The calibration curves in plasma were linear over the range of 5-400 ng/mL (r = 0.999) for each enantiomer with an LOD of 1.0 ng/mL. The proposed method was validated in compliance with International Conference of Harmonization guidelines in terms of linearity, accuracy, precision, LOD, LOQ, and selectivity. The overall recoveries for S-(-)- and R-(+)-atenolol enantiomers from plasma were 95.0-99.5%; RSD ranged from 2.5 to 3.3%.

The proposed method utilized a fused silica capillary (55 cm x75 microm id) and the background electrolyte solution phosphate buffer (12.5 mM, pH 7.4)-methanol (95+5, v/v). The separation was achieved at 30 kV applied voltage and 24 degree C. Atorvastatin (80 microg/mL) was chosen as the internal standard.

The LOD values of CRV and HCT were 0.26 and 0.07 microg/mL, respectively. The validated CE method was successfully applied to the analysis of two commercial tablet dosage forms. Forced degradation studies were performed on bulk samples of the two drugs using thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic, and oxidative stress conditions, and the stressed samples were analyzed by the proposed method. Degradation products produced as a result of stress studies did not interfere with the determination of CRV and HCT; the assay could, therefore, be considered stability-indicating.",

The study investigated the in vitro reaction of rabbit aorta smooth muscle to ligands binding to beta-adrenergic receptors. The response of aortic strips to beta-adrenergic receptor agonists (dobutamine, isoproterenol, salbutamol) and the influence of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (propranolol, betaxolol) on contractile activity was determined. All tested agonists induced contraction of the rabbit abdominal aorta muscle in a concentration-dependent manner (dobutamine > isoproterenol > salbutamol). Enhanced reaction to low concentrations of agonists (dobutamine, isoproterenol) after administration of propranolol and inhibition of contractility in the presence of high concentrations thereof (dobutamine, salbutamol) was observed. Maximal reaction to agonists decreased after betaxolol pretreatment. The results indicate that all the substances with beta-agonist activity also possess contracting properties (presumably by acting at alpha-adrenergic receptors), but are much weaker in the case of isoproterenol and salbutamol than for dobutamine. Propranolol and betaxolol reduce the contractile response of smooth muscle using probably other mechanisms than those associated with adrenergic receptors.",

Our previous study found that anti-\u03b21-adrenergic receptor autoantibodies (\u03b21-AABs) could lead to cardiac dysfunction along with abnormalities in mitochondrial structure. The present study tested the hypothesis that \u03b21-AABs may induce the decline in mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) by suppression of cardiac autophagy, which contributed to cardiac dysfunction. Male adult rats were randomized to receive a vehicle or peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the \u03b21 adrenergic receptor (\u03b21-AAB group, 0.4 \u03bcg/g every two weeks for 12 weeks) and treated with rapamycin (RAPA, an autophagy agonist) at 5 mg/kg/day for two days before detection. At the 4th week, 8th week and 12th week of active immunization, the rats were sacrificed and cardiac function and the levels of cardiac LC3 and Beclin-1 were detected. \u0394\u03a8m in cardiac myocytes was determined by myocardial radionuclide imaging technology and JC-1 staining. In the present study, \u03b21-AABs caused cardiac dysfunction, reduced \u0394\u03a8m and decreased cardiac autophagy. Treatment with RAPA markedly attenuated \u03b21-AABs-induced cardiac injury evidenced by recovered \u0394\u03a8m. Taken together, these results suggested that \u03b21-AABs exerted significant decreased \u0394\u03a8m, which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction, most likely by decreasing cardiac autophagy in vivo. Moreover, myocardial radionuclide imaging technology may be needed to assess the risk in developing cardiac dysfunction for the people who have \u03b21-AABs in their blood.",

They may appear for the first time in pregnancy or have a recurring character An important risk factor related to their appearance is the presence of structural heart disease, which complicates < 1% of pregnancies. Generally the symptoms are mild and the treatment is not necessary but in some cases pharmacotherapy is necessary Pharmacotherapy must be a compromise between the potentially adverse effects of drugs on the fetus and the beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system of the mother. Due to the development of cardiac surgery many women with heart defects reach reproductive age and become pregnant. Therefore this problem will be faced more and more often in clinical practice. In addition to pharmacological methods some cardiac arrhythmias may require urgent, life-saving procedures. External electrical cardioversion is associated with the application of certain amount of energy via two electrodes placed on the thorax. It is used to treat hemodynamically unstable supraventricular tachycardias, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter Also in hemodynamically stable patients in whom drug therapy was ineffective elective electrical cardioversion can be use to convert cardiac arrhythmia to sinus rhythm. We present a case of a 33 years old patient with congenital heart disease surgically corrected in childhood who had first incident of atrial flutter in pregnancy. Arrhytmia occured in 26th week of gestation. The patient was hemodynamically stable and did not approve electrical cardioversion as a method of treatment therefore pharmacotherapy was started. Heart rate was controled with metoprolol and digoxin, warfarin was used to anticoagulation. Calcium and potassium were also given. Described therapy did not convert atrial flutter to sinus rhythm therefore in 33rd week of gestation after patient's approval electrical cardioversion was performed. Before cardioversion transesophageal echocardiogram was made to exclude the presence of thrombus inside atria. Energy of 50J was applied and sinus rhythm was restored. Cardiotocography during and after cardioversion did not show any significant fetal heart rate changes. Further pregnancy and puerperium were uneventful.

Pregnancy is a condition which predisposes to cardiac arrhytmias. It is associated with changes in cardiovascular system of pregnant women that appear physiologically They can be effectively treated with low risk for mother and fetus. Electrical cardioversion is an effective and safe method of therapy of supraventricular arrhytmias also during pregnancy The adaptation of the maternal hemostasis in pregnancy predisposes women to an increased risk of thromboembolism therefore anticoagulant therapy is essential to minimize the risk of embolic episodes and stroke during elective cardioversion.

Alcohol-cue associations may be strengthened by enhancing adrenergic activity with yohimbine or weakened by blocking adrenergic activity with propranolol. Alcohol-cue associations may also be weakened by long cue exposure sessions or strengthened by short cue exposure sessions. A useful treatment approach for alcoholism may combine adrenergic manipulation with cue exposure sessions of a specific duration. The present study sought to determine if cue exposure during long- or short-duration extinction sessions with post-session yohimbine or propranolol would alter alcohol cue-induced responding and self-administration. Rats were trained to respond for alcohol during sessions that included an olfactory cue given at the beginning of the session and a visual/auditory cue complex delivered concurrently with alcohol. Cue-induced responding was assessed before and after the repeated extinction sessions. Repeated alcohol extinction sessions of long duration (45 min) or short duration (5 min) were followed immediately by injections of saline, yohimbine, or propranolol. After the second set of cue-induced responding tests, reacquisition of operant alcohol self-administration was examined. To determine if the experimental procedures were sensitive to memory manipulation through other pharmacological mechanisms, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 was given 20 min prior to long-duration extinction sessions. Both the long- and short-duration extinction sessions decreased cue-induced responding. Neither yohimbine nor propranolol, given post-session, had subsequent effects on cue-induced responding or alcohol self-administration. MK-801 blocked the effect of extinction sessions on cue-induced responding but had no effect on self-administration. The present study shows that manipulation of the NMDA system in combination with alcohol cue exposure therapy during extinction-like sessions may be more effective than manipulation of the adrenergic system in reducing the strength of alcohol-cue associations in this specific model of alcohol relapse.",

Disrupting the process of fear memory reconsolidation was manipulated by administering the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol HCl either before or after memory retrieval. Trait anxiety uniquely predicted the fear-reducing effects of disrupting memory reconsolidation: the higher the trait anxiety, the less fear reduction. Vulnerable individuals with the propensity to develop anxiety disorders may need higher dosages of propranolol HCl or more retrieval trials for targeting and changing fear memory. Our finding clearly demonstrates that we cannot simply translate observations from fundamental research on fear reduction in the average organism to clinical practice.",

The most common strategy to control hypertension is the stepped-care approach with progressive addition of medications to eventually reach BP goal. An alternative approach includes the use of PRA measurements to guide both the addition and removal of drugs in an attempt to effectively control BP. At times, this has the potential to result in a drug regimen that is incongruous with current guidelines and practice recommendations. However, if this results in more effective BP control with the same, or fewer, number of medications, it may represent a reasonable alternative.",

Elevated transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 in kidney tissue is associated with podocyte damage that ultimately results in apoptosis and detachment. We investigated the proapoptotic mechanism of TGF-\u03b2 in immortalized mouse podocytes. Exogenous TGF-\u03b21-induced podocyte apoptosis through caspase-3 activation, which was related to elevated ROS levels generated by selective upregulation of NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4). In mouse podocytes, Nox4 was predominantly localized to mitochondria, and Nox4 upregulation by TGF-\u03b21 markedly depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential. TGF-\u03b21-induced ROS production and caspase activation were mitigated by an antioxidant, the Nox inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, or small interfering RNA for Nox4. A TGF-\u03b2 receptor I blocker, SB-431542, completely reversed the changes triggered by TGF-\u03b21. Knockdown of either Smad2 or Smad3 prevented the increase of Nox4 expression, ROS generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-3 activation by TGF-\u03b21. These results suggest that TGF-\u03b21-induced mitochondrial Nox4 upregulation via the TGF-\u03b2 receptor-Smad2/3 pathway is responsible for ROS production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, which may at least in part contribute to the development and progression of proteinuric glomerular diseases such as diabetic nephropathy.",

Nebivolol-mediated lipolysis was blocked by SR59230A, a specific \u03b23AR antagonist, suggesting that nebivolol acts through \u03b23AR in human adipocytes. Interestingly, in human adipocytes, nebivolol activated UCP1, PPAR\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) and cytochrome c (CYCS) gene expression in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. Using propranolol (\u03b21 and \u03b22 antagonist) together with nebivolol we showed that the induction of these genes was still present suggesting again \u03b23AR activation. Moreover, nebivolol significantly reduced the diameter of lipid droplets in cultured adipocytes.",

This study is a single-center, retrospective study and patients with HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of \u226445%, were consecutively enrolled. The study population of 685 patients was divided into two groups, namely, LVEF \u226435 (n=371) and LVEF 36-45% (n=314). The patients were followed up for a median of 31 months (range, 8-61 months) and during this period, 24% of patients receiving angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) treatment and 23% of those receiving \u03b2-blockers reached the maximum tolerated dose. Of the 191 total mortalities (28%), 127 were due to pump failure (19%) and 42 (6%) were sudden deaths. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to identify the variables associated with the risk of mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to compare the survival times of patients in the LVEF \u226435% and LVEF of 36-45% groups. The predictors of all-cause mortality were advanced age, body mass index, New York Heart Association functional class and lack of oral \u03b2-blockers at discharge.

    "130": "The therapeutic potential of molecular hydrogen (H\u2082) is emerging in a number of human diseases and in their animal models, including in particular Parkinson's disease (PD). H\u2082 supplementation of drinking water has been shown to exert disease-modifying effects in PD patients and neuroprotective effects in experimental PD model mice. However, H\u2082 supplementation does not result in detectable changes in striatal H\u2082 levels, indicating an indirect effect. Here we show that H\u2082 supplementation increases gastric expression of mRNA encoding ghrelin, a growth hormone secretagogue, and ghrelin secretion, which are antagonized by the \u03b21-adrenoceptor blocker, atenolol. Strikingly, the neuroprotective effect of H\u2082 water was abolished by either administration of the ghrelin receptor-antagonist, D-Lys(3) GHRP-6, or atenolol. Thus, the neuroprotective effect of H\u2082 in PD is mediated by enhanced production of ghrelin. Our findings point to potential, novel strategies for ameliorating pathophysiology in which a protective effect of H\u2082 supplementation has been demonstrated.",

The focus of this study was to examine the pharmacology of these antibodies to evaluate their mechanistic activity at \u03b21AR. Immunization with the \u03b21AR stabilized receptor yielded five stable hybridoma clones, four of which expressed functional IgG, as determined in cell-based assays used to evaluate cAMP stimulation. The antibodies bind diverse epitopes associated with low nanomolar agonist activity at \u03b21AR, and they appeared to show some degree of biased signaling as they were inactive in an assay measuring signaling through \u03b2-arrestin. In vitro characterization also verified different antibody receptor interactions reflecting the different epitopes on the extracellular surface of \u03b21AR to which the mAbs bind. The anti-\u03b21AR mAbs only demonstrated agonist activity when in dimeric antibody format, but not as the monomeric Fab format, suggesting that agonist activation may be mediated through promoting receptor dimerization. Finally, we have also shown that at least one of these antibodies exhibits in vivo functional activity at a therapeutically-relevant dose producing an increase in heart rate consistent with \u03b21AR agonism.",

Of the pharmacologic therapies utilized in patients with symptomatic disease, only angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (and to a lesser extent, angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs) have been shown to improve clinical outcomes among patients with ALVD. Although evidence to support the use of beta blockers in this setting has been primarily derived from retrospective studies or subgroup analyses, they are generally recommended in most patients with ALVD, especially those with ischemic etiology. Statins are associated with improvements in both major adverse cardiovascular events and heart failure events among patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction.

    "139": "\u03b2-blockers are widely used to improve symptoms and prolong life in heart disease primarily by inhibiting the actions of endogenous catecholamines at the \u03b21-adrenoceptor. There are two common naturally occurring polymorphisms within the human \u03b21-adrenoceptor sequence: Ser or Gly at position 49 in the N-terminus and Gly or Arg at position 389 in the C-terminus and some clinical studies have suggested that expression of certain variants may be associated with disease and affect response to treatment with \u03b2-blockers. The \u03b21-adrenoceptor also exists in two agonist conformations - a high affinity catecholamine conformation and a low affinity secondary agonist conformation. Receptor-effector coupling and intracellular signalling from the different conformations may be affected by the polymorphic variants. Here, we examine in detail the molecular pharmacology of the \u03b21-adrenoceptor polymorphic variants with respect to ligand affinity, efficacy, activation of the different agonist conformations and signal transduction and determine whether the polymorphic variants do indeed affect this secondary conformation. Stable cell lines expressing the wildtype and polymorphic variants were constructed and receptor pharmacology examined using whole cell binding and intracellular secondary messenger techniques. There was no difference in affinity for agonists and antagonists at the human wildtype \u03b21-adrenoceptor (Ser49/Gly389) and the polymorphic variants Gly49/Gly389 and Ser49/Arg389. Furthermore, the polymorphic variant receptors both have two active agonist conformations with pharmacological properties similar to the wildtype receptor. Although the polymorphism at position 389 is thought to occur in an intracellular domain important for Gs-coupling, the two agonist conformations of the polymorphic variants stimulate intracellular signalling pathways, including Gs-cAMP intracellular signalling, in a manner very similar to that of the wildtype receptor.",

Though the main criterion for combining drugs in a single dosage form is the rationale, but consideration like stability of formulation is equally important, due to an added aspect of drug-drug interaction. The objective of this study was to evaluate interaction among the drugs in an antihypertensive combination of nifedipine and atenolol. Nifedipine is a known light sensitive drug, which degrades via intra-molecular mechanisms to nitro- and nitroso-pyridine analogs, along with a few minor secondary products that are formed through inter-molecular interactions amongst primary degradation products and their intermediates. Atenolol is reasonably stable weakly basic drug that is mainly hydrolyzed at acetamide terminal amide moiety to its corresponding carboxylic acid. To the best of our knowledge, there is no known information on chemical compatibility among the two drugs. The present study involved subjecting of nifedipine, atenolol and their combination to a variety of accelerated and stress conditions. HPLC studies revealed formation of a new product in the mixture of two drugs (\u223c2%), which was also generated from nifedipine alone, but at trace levels (<0.1%). The product was isolated by preparative chromatography and subjected to indepth studies for its characterization. Ultra-violet, FT-IR, mass spectrometric and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies highlighted that the principal photo-degradation pathway of nifedipine was modified and diverted in the presence of atenolol. To verify the same, a study was conducted employing two other \u03b2-blockers with similar structures to atenolol, and the same product was formed in relatively higher quantity therein also. The new product is postulated to be produced as a result of rearrangement of hydroxylamine intermediate, known to be involved in the generation of nitro- and nitroso-pyridine photo-degradation products of nifedipine.",

SERT is a key target for many psychotherapeutic and abused drugs, therefore understanding how SERT activity and expression are regulated is of fundamental importance. A growing literature suggests that SERT activity is under regulatory control of the 5-HT1B autoreceptor. The present studies made use of mice with a constitutive reduction (5-HT1B+/-) or knockout of 5-HT1B receptors (5-HT1B-/-), as well as mice with a constitutive knockout of SERT (SERT-/-) to further explore the relationship between SERT activity and 5-HT1B receptor expression. High-speed chronoamperometry was used to measure clearance of 5-HT from CA3 region of hippocampus in vivo. Serotonin clearance rate, over a range of 5-HT concentrations, did not differ among 5-HT1B receptor genotypes, nor did [(3)H]cyanoimipramine binding to SERT in this brain region, suggesting that SERT activity is not affected by constitutive reduction or loss of 5-HT1B receptors; alternatively, it might be that other transport mechanisms for 5-HT compensate for loss of 5-HT1B receptors. Consistent with previous reports, we found that the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist, cyanopindolol, inhibited 5-HT clearance in wild-type mice. However, this effect of cyanopindolol was lost in 5-HT1B-/- mice and diminished in 5-HT1B+/- mice, indicating that the 5-HT1B receptor is necessary for cyanopindolol to inhibit 5-HT clearance. Likewise, cyanopindolol was without effect on 5-HT clearance in SERT-/- mice, demonstrating a requirement for the presence of both SERT and 5-HT1B receptors in order for cyanopindolol to inhibit 5-HT clearance in CA3 region of hippocampus. Our findings are consistent with SERT being under the regulatory control of 5-HT1B autoreceptors.

With regard to myocardial infarction, it was observed a relative reduction of 17% in men and 20% in women. According to EUROASPIREIII survey done in 8,966 patients with ischaemic heart disease in Europe, 17% of patients were still smokers, 35% were obese, 56% has uncontrolled blood pressure, 51% has raised blood cholesterol and 25% were diabetics.

Hemorrhagic detachment was detected by anterior and posterior segment examination, as well as B-scan ultrasonography. After the detachment, excessive increased intraocular pressure was controlled with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, cycloplegic and steroid therapy. After four months, visual acuity was 20/20 and the intraocular pressure was under control with 0.5% timolol maleate and 1% brinzolamide.

Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older, with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and on the same topical ocular therapy for at least 6 months. The following data were considered: sex, age, medication history and number of years on topical intraocular pressure-lowering therapy. All patients underwent an evaluation of the ocular surface which included: an interview using the Ocular Surface Disease Index\u00ae (OSDI\u00ae) questionnaire, break-up time, biomicroscopy, fluorescein corneal staining and rose Bengal ocular surface staining.",

    "165": "Resistant hypertension (RHTN) is an increasingly common clinical problem that is often heterogeneous in etiology, risk factors, and comorbidities. It is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure on optimal doses of three antihypertensive agents, ideally one being a diuretic. The definition also includes controlled hypertension with use of four or more antihypertensive agents. Recent observational studies have advanced the characterization of patients with RHTN. Patients with RHTN have higher rates of cardiovascular events and mortality compared with patients with more easily controlled hypertension. Secondary causes of hypertension, including obstructive sleep apnea, primary aldosteronism, renovascular disease, are common in patients with RHTN and often coexist in the same patient. In addition, RHTN is often complicated by metabolic abnormalities. Patients with RHTN require a thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and optimize treatment, which typically includes a combination of lifestyle adjustments, and pharmacologic and interventional treatment. Combination therapy including a diuretic, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist where warranted is the classic regimen for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists like spironolactone or eplerenone have been shown to be efficacious in patients with RHTN, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and primary aldosteronism. Novel interventional therapies, including baroreflex activation and renal denervation, have shown that both of these methods may be used to lower blood pressure safely, thereby providing exciting and promising new options to treat RHTN.",

Antimuscarinic drugs isolated or in combination with alpha-blockers improve storage symptoms without any harmful effect to the voiding function. PDE5i alone improve BPH/LUTS. Combination of PDE5i with alpha-blockers provides better symptomatic control than alpha-blockers alone. A recent head-to-head comparison of tadalafil 5\u200amg/day with tamsulosin 0.4\u200amg/day showed that these agents provided the same improvement in BPH/LUTS and, surprisingly, the same improvement in the urinary flow. In fact, previous studies with tadalafil had not shown any effect of tadalafil on flow. In addition, tadalafil but not tamsulosin improved sexual function. Mirabegron, the first \u03b23-adrenoreceptor agonist, while improving BPH/LUTS in men with bladder outlet obstruction, do not decrease urinary flow or detrusor pressure.",

This will challenge our concept of standard treatment for BPH/LUTS.", 
    "169": "A cellulose derivative-based chiral stationary phase (CSP) is considered one of the most widely applied CSPs due to its powerful enantioseparation ability. The high loading capacity and mechanical strength of CSPs are crucial for their application in preparative chromatography, such as a simulated moving bed. Compared to traditional cellulose-based CSPs that have been adsorbed onto chromatographic supports, organic-inorganic hybrid CSPs exhibit a potentially higher loading capacity and mechanical strength by increasing the density of chiral recognition groups. A hybrid cellulose 3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate chiral stationary phase (organic/inorganic: 70/30, w/w) was prepared via a sol-gel method and characterized with several analytical techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and (29)Si cross polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance ((29)Si CP/MAS NMR). In addition, the as-synthesized hybrid chiral silica spheres were treated with an end-capping process to mask the residual silica hydroxyl groups. Compared to a commercial Chiralpak IB column, better separation of \u03b2-blocker drugs, including pindolol (selectivity of 5.55), metoprolol (2.30), propranolol (1.96), bisoprolol (1.74) and atenolol (1.46), on the end-capped CSP was achieved using liquid chromatography, which suggests that the packing material synthesized in this work has sufficient chiral discriminating ability for the effective separation of \u03b2-blocker drugs.",

In addition, MT exhibits a cardioprotective effect because of NO-mimetic properties, increasing NO formation in myocardium via increasing general NOS activity and eNOS expression. MT normalizes iNOS expression in myocardium mitochondria and decreases nitrotyrosine (nitrosation stress marker) formation. At the same time, the reference preparation metoprolol did not exhibit NO-mimetic properties in myocardium of SHR rats.",

She needed to have an early scheduled coronay artery bypass grafting surgery, because percutaneous intervention for the left main coronary artery in support of intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) resulted in failure. Tachycardia and hyperthermia were observed at admission to the ICU, and hemodynamic parameters suggested high-output heart failure. Preoperative management using antithyroid drug, inorganic iodine, corticosteroid and propranolol stabilized her hemodynamic condition, and then CABG was performed on ICU day 3. Intraoperative and postoperative use of landiolol, a short acting beta blocker, was useful for maintaining hemodynamic stability. Surgery was uneventfully completed and she was extubated on postoperative day 1 following IABP withdrawal. Appropriate preoperative management and perioperative use of the short acting beta blocker were useful for management of the patient with uncontrolled hyperthyroid state.", 
    "172": "Several studies have reported the coupling of dopamine signaling to phospholipase C \u03b2 (PLC\u03b2) both in vitro and in vivo. However, the precise physiological relevance of this signaling pathway in mediating dopamine behaviors is still unclear. Here we report that stimulation of dopamine receptor signaling in vivo with systemic administration of apomorphine, amphetamine, and cocaine leads to increased production of inositol triphosphate (IP3) in the mouse striatum. Using selective antagonists and dopamine D1 and D2 receptor knock-out animals, we show that the production of IP3 is mediated by the D1 receptor, but not the D2 receptor. A selective blocker of PLC\u03b2, U73122, was used to assess the physiological relevance of D1-mediated IP3 production. We show that U73122 inhibits the locomotor-stimulating effects of apomorphine, amphetamine, cocaine, and SKF81297. Furthermore, U73122 also suppresses the spontaneous hyperactivity exhibited by dopamine transporter knock-out mice. Importantly, the effects of U73122 are selective to dopamine-mediated hyperactivity, as this compound does not affect hyperactivity induced by the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist MK801. Finally, we present evidence showing that an imbalance of D1- and D2-mediated signaling following U73122 treatment modifies the locomotor output of animals from horizontal locomotor activity to vertical activity, further highlighting the importance of the PLC\u03b2 pathway in the regulation of forward locomotion via dopamine receptors.",

    "193": "P2X3 receptors (P2XRs), as members of the purine receptor family, are deeply involved in chronic pain sensation and therefore, specific, competitive antagonists are of great interest for perspective pain management. Heretofore, Schild plot analysis has been commonly used for studying the interaction of competitive antagonists and the corresponding receptor. Unfortunately, the steady-state between antagonist and agonist, as a precondition for this kind of analysis, cannot be reached at fast desensitizing receptors like P2X3R making Schild plot analysis inappropriate. The aim of this study was to establish a new method to analyze the interaction of antagonists with their binding sites at the rapidly desensitizing human P2X3R. The patch-clamp technique was used to investigate the structurally divergent, preferential antagonists A317491, TNP-ATP and PPADS. The P2X1,3-selective \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene ATP (\u03b1,\u03b2-meATP) was used as an agonist to induce current responses at the wild-type (wt) P2X3R and several agonist binding site mutants. Afterwards a Markov model combining sequential transitions of the receptor from the closed to the open and desensitized mode in the presence or absence of associated antagonist molecules was developed according to the measured data. The P2X3R-induced currents could be fitted correctly with the help of this Markov model allowing identification of amino acids within the binding site which are important for antagonist binding. In conclusion, Markov models are suitable to simulate agonist antagonist interactions at fast desensitizing receptors such as the P2X3R. Among the antagonists investigated, TNP-ATP and A317491 acted in a competitive manner, while PPADS was identified as a (pseudo)irreversible blocker.",

    "198": "Androgens control growth of prostate epithelial cells and androgen deprivation induces apoptosis, leading to prostate involution. We investigated the effects of surgical stress on prostate involution induced by androgen ablation and determined the underlying mechanisms. Androgen ablation in mice was induced by surgical castration and administration of the anti-androgenic drugs bicalutamide and MDV3100. Surgical stress was induced by sham castration under isoflurane anesthesia. Surgical stress delayed apoptosis and prostate involution induced by anti-androgenic drugs. These effects of stress were prevented by administering the selective beta2-adrenoreceptor antagonist ICI118,551 and were also blocked in BAD(3SA/WT) mice expressing phosphorylation-deficient mutant BAD3SA. These results indicate that apoptosis and prostate involution in response to androgen ablation therapy could be delayed by surgical stress via the beta2-adrenoreceptor/BAD signaling pathway.

We hypothesized that long-term treatment of hypertension will lead to improvements in left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic function. We collected detailed cardiovascular phenotypic data on 1006 participants from a substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial. Patients randomized to either an amlodipine\u00b1perindopril-based or an atenolol\u00b1bendroflumethiazide-based regimen underwent conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography at time of control of blood pressure after randomization (\u22481.5 years; phase 1) and after a further 2 years of antihypertensive treatment (phase 2). There were no prerandomization data. Five hundred thirty-six patients had complete data collection at both phases. Left ventricular mass index regressed from phase 1 to 2 with no significant difference between treatment groups (amlodipine: 119.5-116.8; atenolol: 122.9-117.5; P<0.001 for both). Conversely, tissue Doppler diastolic indices did not change in the amlodipine\u00b1perindopril-based regimen (E/e', 7.5-7.6 cm/s; P=not significant), but deteriorated in the atenolol\u00b1bendroflumethiazide-based regimen (E/e', 8.0-8.5 cm/s; P<0.01). Despite regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, there was no associated improvement in diastolic function. In fact, long-term treatment with atenolol\u00b1bendroflumethiazide resulted in a progressive deterioration in E/e'.

Owing to repetitive and drug-refractory VF episodes, temporary atrial overdrive pacing was attempted with complete suppression of VF. In the following month, recurrence of ventricular arrhythmia was inversely related to the atrial pacing rate. Although antiarrhythmic drugs other than beta-blockers had been discontinued, neither PVCs nor ventricular arrhythmias recurred at one-month follow-up when the lower pacing rate was set at 60 bpm. In conclusion in these patients, ES was likely related to nerve sprouting after ischemic injury. This chaotic phenomenon occurs early after tissue damage and shows a peak seven days after acute MI with degeneration of superfluous axon branches. High pacing rates can reduce early after depolarizations and suppress PVCs, thus preventing ES. On these grounds, ES patients may be treated with temporary overdrive pacing rather than early radiofrequency ablation.", 
    "210": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a rare but often catastrophic event during pregnancy, delivery or puerperium, leading to a high mortality rate. It has different pathogenic mechanisms, such as atherosclerosis, vasospasm, thrombosis and coronary dissection. Although MI has been reported in pregnant women at all stages of pregnancy and postpartum, it occurs more commonly in the third trimester and most commonly involves the anterior wall. Evidence suggests that pregnancy itself is an independent risk factor for MI, conferring a three- to four-fold higher risk than that of nonpregnant women matched for age, possibly due to the unique physiological changes required to meet the demands of a growing foetus. We report a case of a 27-year-old woman with familial hyperlipidaemia presenting with myocardial infarction six days after caesarean delivery, secondary to severe left main coronary stenosis (LMCA), who was treated with emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).", 
    "211": "The treatment of essential hypertension is based essentially on the prescription of four major classes of antihypertensive drugs, i.e. blockers of the renin--angiotensin system, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and beta-blockers. In recent years, very few new drug therapies of hypertension have become available. Therefore, it is crucial for physicians to optimize their antihypertensive therapies with the drugs available on the market. In each of the classes of antihypertensive drugs, questions have recently been raised: are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors superior to angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)? Is it possible to reduce the incidence of peripheral oedema with calcium antagonists? Is hydrochlorothiazide really the good diuretic to use in combination therapies? The purpose of this review is to discuss these various questions in the light of the most recent clinical studies and meta-analyses. These latter suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARB are equivalent except for a better tolerability profile of ARB. Third generation calcium channel blockers enable to reduce the incidence of peripheral oedema and chlorthalidone is certainly more effective than hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular events in hypertension. At last, studies suggest that drug adherence and long-term persistence under therapy is one of the major issues in the actual management of essential hypertension.", 
    "212": "Carvedilol, a nonselective \u03b2-adrenoreceptor blocker with pleiotropic activities has been shown to exert neuroprotective effect due to its antioxidant property. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of carvedilol is still not fully uncovered. Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway is an important cellular stress response pathway involved in neuroprotection. Here we investigated the effect of carvedilol on oxidative stress-induced cell death (glutamate 2mM and H2O2 600 \u03bcM) and the activity of Nrf2/ARE pathway in HT22 hippocampal cells. Carvedilol significantly increased cell viability and decreased ROS in HT22 cells exposed to glutamate or H2O2. Furthermore, carvedilol activated the Nrf2/ARE pathway in a concentration-dependent manner, and increased the protein levels of heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1(NQO-1), two downstream factors of the Nrf2/ARE pathway. Collectively, our results indicate that carvedilol protects neuronal cell against glutamate- and H2O2-induced neurotoxicity possibly through activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.", 
    "213": "Silent ischemia is a common manifestation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Continuous ECG (cECG) monitoring is an effective tool for assessing the frequency and duration of silent ischemic episodes for patients with CAD and for risk stratifying asymptomatic patients or those after an acute coronary syndrome by identifying those at increased risk for future cardiovascular events or death. cECG also allows monitoring of the effectiveness of therapy in patients with CAD. Treatment strategies targeted toward the elimination of silent ischemia have shown that revascularization was better than medical therapy in eliminating silent ischemia, but large scale, prospective studies targeting silent ischemia as a treatment endpoint are still lacking. Future research is warranted to study the effects of newer medical agents or the selected use of revascularization in those patients with persistent silent ischemia despite current medical regiments.", 
    "214": "Heart rate (HR) variability has been extensively studied in cardiac patients, especially in patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and also in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The majority of studies have shown that patients with reduced or abnormal HR variability have an increased risk of mortality within a few years after an AMI or after a diagnosis of CHF/LV dysfunction. Various measures of HR dynamics, such as time-domain, spectral, and non-linear measures of HR variability have been used in risk stratification. The prognostic power of various measures, except of those reflecting rapid R-R interval oscillations, has been almost identical, albeit some non-linear HR variability measures, such as short-term fractal scaling exponent have provided somewhat better prognostic information than the others. Abnormal HR variability predicts both sudden and non-sudden cardiac death. Because of remodeling of the arrhythmia substrate after AMI, early measurement of HR variability to identify those at high risk should likely be repeated later in order to assess the risk of fatal arrhythmia events. Future randomized trials using HR variability/turbulence as one of the pre-defined inclusion criteria will show whether routine measurement of HR variability/turbulence will become a routine clinical tool for risk stratification of cardiac patients.", 
    "215": "The aim of our study was to establish the influence of \u03b22AR agonists and antagonists on Th1/Th2 subpopulation balance in intact and activated CD4+ T lymphocyte. Jurkat leukemic T cell line was used as a model for studying T cell activation conditions under the influence of \u03b22AR ligands. As follows from the results of our studies, after the influence of \u03b22AR agonist isoproterenol on intact Jurkat cells expression of IL-2 was not changed in comparison to control level. Under the PHA-stimulation level of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells increased significantly; isoproterenol caused decrease level of IL-2 expression in the PHA-stimulated Jurkat cells. Adding of \u03b22AR antagonist propranolol to the Jurkat cells pre-incubated with isoproterenol didn't change expression of IL-2. \u03b22AR antagonist propranolol induced slight increase of IL-2 expression in PHA-stimulated Jurkat cells pre-incubated with isoproterenol. Neither isoproterenol nor propranolol didn't change intensity of IL-10 expression in intact Jurkat cells. In the PHA-stimulated Jurkat cells level of IL-10 production decreased in comparison to control level. Isoproterenol induced sharp intensification of IL-10 expression in these cells. Propranolol prevented increase of IL-10 expression in the PHA-stimulated Jurkat cells pre-incubated with \u03b22AR agonist. It was concluded that \u03b22ARs in dose-dependent manner regulate cytokine profile in intact and mitogen activated CD4+ T lymphocyte and by this way induce dose-dependent alterations of lymphocyte proliferation and immune response. This indicated existence of a link among immune response and sympathetic nervous system activity.", 
    "216": "What is the central question of this study? Previous work has produced the counterintuitive finding that the vasoconstrictor neurotransmitters noradrenaline and neuropeptide Y are involved in vasodilatation. We aimed to discover whether sympathetic neurotransmitters are required for the sustained vasodilatation in response to local skin warming, as has been previously suggested, and to determine whether noradrenaline and neuropeptide Y are 'mediating' the sustained vasodilator response directly or acting to 'prime' (or kick-start) it. What is the main finding and its importance? We have found that noradrenaline and neuropeptide Y are required at the initiation of vasodilatation in response to local skin warming, if a complete vasodilator response is to be achieved; however, they are not required once vasodilatation has begun. In a three-part study, we examined whether noradrenaline, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were involved in the sustained vasodilatation in response to local skin warming. Forearm skin sites were instrumented with intradermal microdialysis fibres, local skin heaters and laser-Doppler flow probes. Local skin temperature (T(loc)) was increased from 34 to 42\u00b0C at a rate of 0.5\u00b0C (10 s)(-1). Laser-Doppler flow was expressed as cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC; laser-Doppler flow/mean arterial pressure). In part 1, three skin sites were prepared; two were treated with the study vehicle (lactated Ringer solution), while the third site was treated with yohimbine and propranolol to antagonize \u03b1- and \u03b2-receptors, and 10 min of baseline data were record at a T(loc) of 34\u00b0C. Receptor antagonism was confirmed via infusion of clonidine. The T(loc) was increased to 42\u00b0C at all sites. Once CVC had stabilized, site 2 was treated with yohimbine and propranolol to examine the effect of adrenergic receptor blockade on sustained vasodilatation of the skin. Receptor antagonism was again confirmed via infusion of clonidine. All sites were treated with sodium nitroprusside, and T(loc) was increased to 43\u00b0C to elicit maximal vasodilatation. In parts 2 and 3, the general protocol was the same, except that BIBP-3226 was used to antagonize Y(1)-receptors, NPY to test the efficacy of the antagonism, N(G)-amino-l-arginine to inhibit eNOS and ACh to test the adequacy of inhibition. Compared with control conditions, antagonism of \u03b1- and \u03b2-receptors, Y(1)-receptors and eNOS before local skin warming reduced the initial and sustained vasodilatation in response to increased T(loc). However, treatment with yohimbine and propranolol or BIBP-3226 after local skin warming did not affect the sustained vasodilatation [CVC, 90 \u00b1 3 versus 89 \u00b1 3%max (control vs. yohimbine and propranolol) and 88 \u00b1 5 versus 87 \u00b1 4%max (control vs. BIBP-3226); P > 0.05]. N(G)-Amino-l-arginine perfusion caused a large reduction in CVC during this phase (89 \u00b1 5 versus 35 \u00b1 4%max; P < 0.05). These data indicate that if their actions are antagonized after local warming and cutaneous vasodilatation has occurred, noradrenaline and NPY play little, if any, role in the sustained vasodilatation in response to local skin warming. However, eNOS contributes markedly to the sustained vasodilatation regardless of when it is inhibited."
