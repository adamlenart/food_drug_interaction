    "0": "Coronary flow, left ventricular circumference, and left ventricular pressure were observed in the isovolumically contracting, isolated canine heart supported with arterial blood from a donor. Systolic pressure, heart rate, and coronary perfusion pressure were held constant while the coronary bed was progressively embolized with either large (average 865 mu) or small (average 10 mu) polystyrene microspheres. During embolization with large microspheres, coronary flow diminished progressively. After sufficient embolization, decreased ventricular performance was indicated by a rise in end-diastolic pressure. During embolization with small microspheres, coronary flow initially increased, which suggests the effective release of a vasodilator substance. Return of coronary flow to control levels occurred only after the end-diastolic pressure rose, on the average, to above 30 mm Hg. After embolization with both sizes of microspheres, ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relationships showed decreased ventricular compliance. This was attributed, in part, to edema of the ventricular wall and, in part, to focal shortening of the sarcomeres where the circulation was compromised. Embolization with both sizes of microspheres ultimately caused a decrease in ventricular performance, although when the systolic pressure was increased the usual relationship between peak developed wall stress, and end-diastolic pressure showed less of a descending limb than that found in the nonembolized, isolated heart. It is felt that the data summarized above have bearing on ventricular performance and coronary flow in clinical situations where hearts are perfused through pump oxygenator systems and are thereby subject to embolization from aggregated clumps of platelets and fibrin.", 
    "1": "The 78,000 x g microsomal fraction of canine ventricular myocardium effected a 20-fold concentration of [(3)H]norepinephrine from a 10(-9) M solution. The [(3)H]norepinephrine bound was displaced by physiologic concentrations of the beta-adrenergic catecholamines isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, in that order, which is the order of effectiveness of their actions on the force and rate of cardiac contraction. Alpha-adrenergic compounds did not displace [(3)H]norepinephrine until concentrations four orders of magnitude greater were reached. The beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol displaced at 10(-6) M, whereas the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine was inactive. Metabolites of the catecholamines did not compete for this binding site. It is concluded that, on the basis of specificity and affinity of binding, these microsomal particles are likely to contain the beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "2": "1. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents antagonized the inhibitory (antianaphylactic) effect of isoprenaline on antigen-induced histamine release in isolated, passively sensitized, human lung and actively sensitized guinea-pig lung suggesting that the effect is exerted through beta-adrenoceptors. No antagonism was obtained with the human allergic leucocyte preparation.2. The antianaphylactic effect of isoprenaline was antagonized not only by propranolol but also by the ;selective' beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, practolol and butoxamine.3. The classification of beta-adrenoceptors is discussed. Certain similarities between antianaphylactic and lipolytic beta-adrenoceptors are noted.", 
    "3": "Nine patients who had recurrent ventricular fibrillation following acute myocardial infarction or angina were given bretylium tosylate in a dose of 5 mg./kg. intramuscularly every eight hours after other measures had proved ineffective. Provided the patients were not in shock or in heart failure, there was a considerable reduction in the episodes of ventricular fibrillation.A second group of nine patients who developed recurrent ventricular fibrillation following open heart surgery were given bretylium intravenously, which controlled the arrhythmia in every instance.Bretylium did not completely abolish ventricular premature beats but the latter did not initiate ventricular fibrillation even when they occurred on the T wave.", 
    "4": "The symptomatic, electrocardiographic, and haemodynamic effects of two adrenergic beta-blocking drugs, oxprenolol and propranolol, have been compared in equipotent intravenous doses in six patients with uncomplicated angina pectoris during treadmill exercise. The method of comparison included double-blind assessment and analysis with placebo control and randomized serial comparison in each patient. Both drugs produced an equal amelioration in symptoms in most of the patients. This was closely correlated with improvement in the electrocardiographic changes and a significant reduction in the exercising heart rate and systemic arterial pressure. This method of double-blind combined subjective and objective assessment carries distinct advantages in the comparative assessment of drug treatments in angina pectoris.", 
    "5": "1. Selective electrical stimulation of the paramedian reticular nucleus (PRN) in anaesthetized and decerebrate-anaesthetized cats elicited cardiac slowing which was shown to be due to inhibition of the sympathetic input to the heart.2. In decerebrate preparations stimulation of the PRN elicited cardioacceleration which was abolished by bilateral vagotomy.3. It is suggested that these changes in heart rate in opposite directions can be accounted for by an inhibitory influence of the PRN on both neural inputs to the heart. In the absence of vagal activity, demonstrated in anaesthetized and decerebrate-anaesthetized preparations, the response to stimulation of the PRN resulted in cardiac slowing. In contrast, when both sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways were active (decerebrate preparation) stimulation of the PRN resulted in cardio-acceleration, due to simultaneous inhibition of the two neural inputs to the heart.4. It is concluded that the two inhibitory functions of the PRN are probably mediated by two different populations of neurones and that the PRN plays an integrative role in the medullary control of heart rate.", 
    "6": "An in vitro system for perifusion of rat pancreas has been used to investigate the effects of diazoxide on glucose-induced insulin release. Administration of diazoxide with a stimulating concentration of glucose produced a dose-dependent suppression of insulin release. This effect was partly reversed by phentolamine. In the presence of nonstimulatory concentrations of glucose, diazoxide plus phentolamine, but neither alone, stimulated a biphasic release of insulin similar to that observed with 1-isopropyl norepinephrine. A prior period of perifusion with a low concentration of diazoxide enhanced the primary component of subsequent glucose-stimulated insulin release, an effect inhibited by addition of either phentolamine or propranolol to the diazoxide during this \"prestimulation\" period. These effects are similar to those observed with epinephrine. By contrast with epinephrine however, increasing the concentration of diazoxide during the period before glucose stimulation enhanced both the primary and secondary components of subsequent glucose-induced insulin release. These data suggest that at least some of the direct effects of diazoxide on the pancreas are mediated through alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor mechanisms."
