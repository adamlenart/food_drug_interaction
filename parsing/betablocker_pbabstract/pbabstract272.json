The authors hypothesized that the d,l-sotalol effects on cardiac repolarization are altered in canine dilated cardiomyopathy when compared to controls. Effects of d,l-sotalol were compared in seven dogs with tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy (CHF) and six control animals. In an open-chest model, contact monophasic action potential recordings were obtained from RV and LV endocardium/epicardium during and after two doses of d,l-sotalol (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, each over 20 minutes). Effects of d,l-sotalol on action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) were examined at pacing cycle lengths of 300-1,000 ms. Plasma d,l-sotalol levels were measured at baseline, 10, and 40 minutes following each dose. Prolongation of APD90 by d,l-sotalol, was significantly exaggerated in CHF animals versus controls (P < 0.05, ANOVA). These differences were magnified at slow heart rates (P < 0.05, ANOVA). There were no significant differences in plasma d,l-sotalol levels between the two groups. Effects of d,l-sotalol on cardiac repolarization are exaggerated in CHF without significant alterations in plasma drug levels. While using d,l-sotalol in heart failure, independent additional effects due to ventricular electrical remodeling may be a consideration.", 
    "1": "To assess the possibility of stimulating Ca2+-activated K+ channels, marine fish erythrocytes were incubated at 20-22 degrees C in saline containing a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor (orthovanadate), a Ca2+ ionophore (A23187), propranolol or Pb2+. Incubation of the cells for up to 2 h under control conditions or in the presence of 5 mM NH4VO3 and 1 mM Ca2+ did not affect the intracellular K+ and Na+ concentrations. About 50% cellular K+ was lost from erythrocytes incubated in the presence of 0.01 mM A23187, 1 mM EGTA and 0.4-1.0 mM Ca2+. There was a significant loss of cellular K+ after the addition of 0.05-0.2 mM propranolol to the incubation medium. The stimulatory effect of propranolol on the K+ efflux was independent of external Ca2+. Blockers of Ca2+ transport, verapamil and Co2+, caused only a small decrease in the K+ loss induced by propranolol. The treatment of erythrocytes with 1-2 microM Pb2+ led to a minor K+ loss, but at a Pb2+ concentration of 20-50 microM, about 70% cellular K+ was lost. The K+ efflux induced by propranolol or Pb2+ was completely blocked by 1 mM quinine. The induced K+ loss from the erythrocytes was accompanied by a slight increase in the intracellular Na+ concentration. These data indicate the possibility of inducing Ca2+- and Pb2+-activated potassium channels in erythrocytes of S. porcus. A distinctive feature of the cells is a high sensitivity to propranolol, which activates K+ channels in the absence of external Ca2+.", 
    "2": "A growing number of Japanese patients are being treated with ICDs. Efforts are warranted to minimize the rates of ICD shocks that cause discomfort and anxiety. The circadian distribution of ICD discharges was investigated in 80 patients (57+/-10 years of age, 69 men) from ten Japanese medical centers. The underlying heart disease was ischemic in 27 versus nonischemic in 53 patients. All patients had refractory VT or VF, and received appropriate shocks confirmed by stored data retrieved from the memory of the ICD. In the analysis of 354 appropriate shocks delivered in the overall population, a morning peak in VT or VF episodes was observed. However, subgroup analyses of the circadian distribution of ICD shocks revealed that the morning peak in VT or VF episodes was confined to patients with ischemic heart disease and was blunted by treatment patients with beta-adrenergic blockers. The absence of a morning peak in appropriate ICD shocks among patients with nonischemic heart disease remains unexplained and was unrelated to the use of beta-adrenergic blockers. In conclusion, the circadian pattern of appropriate ICD discharges was related to the underlying heart disease. In patients with ischemic heart disease, recurrences of VT or VF peaked in the morning. In contrast, in patients without ischemic heart disease, the episodes of VT or VF were evenly distributed during waking hours. Beta-adrenergic blockers appeared to blunt the morning peak in VT or VF among patients with ischemic heart disease.", 
    "3": "The stationary phases of octadecylsilica (ODS) coated with phospholipid have been developed as a model of artificial lipid membranes for liquid chromatographic columns. An ODS column coated with phospholipid can be readily prepared by recycling a solution containing L-alpha-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) through an ODS column in a closed loop. DPPC becomes absorbed on the ODS surfaces by hydrophobic interaction between the acyl group of DPPC and the octadecyl group of the ODS surfaces. The DPPC column was usable when a mobile phase containing 30% (v/v) acetonitrile was delivered without detachment of the DPPC from the ODS surfaces. The retention behavior of ionic solutes on the DPPC column suggested that the retention was based on both ionic and electrostatic interactions between the solutes and the stationary phase. The retention factors on the DPPC column correlated well with the partition coefficients in liposome systems for alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and beta-blockers, indicating that the partition of solutes between the coated phase and buffer was similar to that in the liposome/water system. The DPPC column can be used in screening studies to predict the binding properties of drugs onto lipid membranes.", 
    "4": "During thermoregulation in the bearded dragon Pogona barbata, heart rate when heating is significantly faster than when cooling at any given body temperature (heart rate hysteresis), resulting in faster rates of heating than cooling. However, the mechanisms that control heart rate during heating and cooling are unknown. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that changes in cholinergic and adrenergic tone on the heart are responsible for the heart rate hysteresis during heating and cooling in P. barbata. Heating and cooling trials were conducted before and after the administration of atropine, a muscarinic antagonist, and sotalol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist. Cholinergic and beta-adrenergic blockade did not abolish the heart rate hysteresis, as the heart rate during heating was significantly faster than during cooling in all cases. Adrenergic tone was extremely high (92.3 %) at the commencement of heating, and decreased to 30.7 % at the end of the cooling period. Moreover, in four lizards there was an instantaneous drop in heart rate (up to 15 beats min(-1)) as the heat source was switched off, and this drop in heart rate coincided with either a drop in beta-adrenergic tone or an increase in cholinergic tone. Rates of heating were significantly faster during the cholinergic blockade, and least with a combined cholinergic and beta-adrenergic blockade. The results showed that cholinergic and beta-adrenergic systems are not the only control mechanisms acting on the heart during heating and cooling, but they do have a significant effect on heart rate and on rates of heating and cooling.", 
    "5": "L-783,281, an antidiabetic fungal metabolite that has previously been shown to activate insulin signaling in CHO cells, was tested for its effect on intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) and insulin secretion in single mouse pancreatic beta-cells. Application of 10 micromol/l L-783,281 for 40 s to isolated beta-cells in the presence of 3 mmol/l glucose increased [Ca(2+)](i) to 178 +/- 10% of basal levels (n = 18) as measured by fluo-4 fluorescence. L-767,827, an inactive structural analog of the insulin mimetic, had no effect on beta-cell [Ca(2+)](i). The L-783,281-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) increase was reduced by 82 +/- 4% (n = 6, P < 0.001) in cells incubated with 1 micromol/l of the SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase) pump inhibitor thapsigargin and reduced by 33 +/- 6% (n = 6, P < 0.05) in cells incubated with 20 micromol/l of the L-type Ca(2+)-channel blocker nifedipine. L-783,281-stimulated [Ca(2+)](i) increases were reduced to 31 +/- 3% (n = 9, P < 0.05) and 48 +/- 10% (n = 6, P < 0.05) of control values by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitors LY294002 (25 micromol/l) and wortmannin (100 nmol/l), respectively. In beta-cells from IRS-1-/- mice, 10 micromol/l L-783,281 had no significant effect on [Ca(2+)](i) (n = 5). L-783,281 also resulted in insulin secretion at single beta-cells. Application of 10 micromol/l L-783,281 for 40 s resulted in 12.2 +/- 2.1 (n = 14) exocytotic events as measured by amperometry, whereas the inactive structural analog had no stimulatory effect on secretion. Virtually no secretion was evoked by L-783,281 in IRS-1-/- beta-cells. LY294002 (25 micromol/l) significantly reduced the effect of the insulin mimetic on beta-cell exocytosis. It is concluded that L-783,281 evokes [Ca(2+)](i) increases and exocytosis in beta-cells via an IRS-1/PI3-K-dependent pathway and that the [Ca(2+)](i) increase involves release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores.", 
    "6": "Nutrient augmentation of Ca(2+)-triggered insulin release occurs in an ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel--independent manner. Here, using rat islets, we explored the possibility of the K(ATP) channel-independent nutrient triggering of insulin release. In the presence of 250 micromol/l diazoxide, simultaneous application of forskolin and 16.7 mmol/l glucose strongly stimulated insulin release: fourfold and eightfold increases with 1 and 30 micromol/l forskolin, respectively. alpha-Ketoisocaproate (KIC) and 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) could be used in place of glucose and forskolin, respectively, to trigger insulin release in the presence of diazoxide. Triggering of insulin release by a combination of nutrients and forskolin was not attenuated by 10 micromol/l nifedipine (a blocker of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels) and 2 micromol/l thapsigargin (an inhibitor of intracellular Ca(2+)-ATPase), ascertaining independence of this phenomenon from Ca(2+) entry and from intracellular Ca(2+) liberation. As anticipated, the action of glucose and KIC was greatly (>80%) suppressed by inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism by 2 mmol/l sodium azide (NaN(3)). A combination of palmitate and dimethyl glutamate (a cell-permeable glutamate donor), but not either one alone, weakly but unequivocally triggered insulin release when applied simultaneously with forskolin. In this case, however, mitochondrial poisoning by azide was without effect. The finding suggests that a combination of induced palmitoylation and cytosolic glutamate accumulation partially reconstituted signaling beyond mitochondrial metabolism in the beta-cell upon glucose stimulation. In conclusion, a combination of cAMP signal and nutrients potently triggers insulin release under full activation of the K(ATP) channel, indicating the multiplicity of driving force for insulin exocytosis.", 
    "7": "We compared the potency of 11 clinically available beta-blockers as antagonists of the positive inotropic effects of (-)-isoprenaline and CGP12177 on ferret ventricular myocardium. (-)-CGP12177, (-)-pindolol and (-)-alprenolol were non-conventional partial agonists with intrinsic activity of 0.7, 0.2 and 0.1 respectively. All beta-blockers antagonized in a concentration-dependent and surmountable manner the positive inotropic effects of both (-)-isoprenaline and CGP12177. The potency of each beta-blocker was consistently higher against (-)-isoprenaline than against CGP12177. Two groups of beta-blockers were identified. In one group the difference between the pK(B) values of blockade against (-)-isoprenaline and CGP12177 was 1.1 - 1.6 log units ((-)-alprenolol, (-)-pindolol, (-)-bupranolol, nadolol and carvedilol). In the other group the pK(B) difference was of 2.1 - 3.0 log units ((-)-atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, sotalol, (-)-propranolol and (-)-timolol). The beta-blockers competed with (-)-[(125)I]-cyanopindolol for binding to ventricular beta(1)-adrenoceptors. The binding affinities correlated with the corresponding blocking potencies against (-)-isoprenaline. On average the pK(i) values were 0.5 log units smaller than the pK(B) values against (-)-isoprenaline but 1.6 log units greater than the pK(B) values against CGP12177. In ferret ventricle the effects of (-)-isoprenaline appear to be antagonized by beta-blockers through the state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor for which (-)-[(125)I]-cyanopindolol and beta-blockers have high affinity. The cardiostimulant effects of CGP12177 appear to be mediated through a low-affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor for which beta-blockers have low affinity.", 
    "8": "A series of xanthones and xanthonoxypropanolamines have been synthesized. The activity of compounds on cardiovascular system was evaluated. All the compounds tested exhibited effective hypotensive activity in anesthetized rats. An oxypropanolamine side chain substituted at the C-3 position of the xanthone nucleus significantly enhanced the hypotensive activity. In rat thoracic aorta, all the compounds tested significantly depressed the contractions induced by Ca(2+) (1.9mM) in high K+(80mM) medium and the phasic and tonic contractions caused by norepinephrine (3 microM). In the rat thoracic aorta, the phenylephrine- and high K+ -induced 45Ca(2+) influx were both inhibited by a selective xanthone derivative, 13. In addition to the previously reported result of 13, evaluated as beta adrenoceptor blocker, the depressor and bradycardia effects of 9 are independent of the parasympathetic passway. These results suggest that 13 showed inhibitory effects on the contractile response caused by high K+ and norepinephrine in rat thoracic aorta are mainly due to inhibition of Ca(2+) influx through both voltage-dependent and receptor-operated Ca(2+) channels. The vasodilating properties of 13 is due to its calcium channel and beta adrenergic blocking effects.", 
    "9": "Three methods are described for the simultaneous determination of dorzolamide hydrochloride (DORZ) and timolol maleate (TIM) in ophthalmic solutions. The first method is based on application of thin layer chromatographic separation of both drugs followed by the densitometric measurements of their spot areas. After separation on silica gel GF(254) plates, using methanol-ammonia 25% (100:1.5 v/v) as the mobile phase, the chromatographic zones corresponding to the spots were scanned at 253 and 297 nm, respectively. The calibration function was established in the ranges of 2-18 microg for DORZ and 0.5-4.5 microg for TIM. The second method depends on first derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometry, with zero-crossing measurement method. The first derivative values D(1) at 250.2 and 312.5 nm were selected for the assay of DORZ and TIM, respectively. Calibration graphs follow Beer's law in the range 10-64 and 2.5-16 microg ml(-1), respectively. The third method is based on ratio first derivative spectrophotometry. The signals in the first derivative of the ratio spectra at 244 and 306.2 nm were selected to determine DORZ and TIM in the mixture and calibration graphs are linear in the range of 5-40 and 5.0-17.5 microg ml(-1), respectively. The proposed methods were successfully applied to the determination of these compounds in synthetic mixtures and in pharmaceutical preparations. The proposed methods are simple, rapid and suitable for quality control application.", 
    "10": "The present study examined whether a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) causes glucose-insensitivity in beta-cells and whether it could be modulated by pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a pancreatic insulinotropin. Rat single beta-cells were cultured for 2 days with sustained increases in [Ca(2+)](i), followed by determination of the [Ca(2+)](i) response to glucose (8.3 mM) as monitored with fura-2. High K(+) (25 mM) produced sustained increases in [Ca(2+)](i) in beta-cells, which were inhibited by nifedipine, a Ca(2+) channel blocker. After culture with high K(+), the incidence and amplitude of [Ca(2+)](i) responses to glucose were markedly reduced. This glucose-insensitivity was prevented by the presence of nifedipine or PACAP-38 (10(-13) M and 10-9) M) in high K(+) culture. PACAP-38 attenuated high K(+)-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increases. In conclusion, sustained increases in [Ca(2+)](i) induce glucose-insensitivity (Ca(2+) toxicity in beta-cells) and it is prevented by PACAP possibly in part due to its Ca(2+)-reducing capacity.",

Catecholamines, neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI), renin activity, and N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic factor (N-ANF) were measured in venous plasma before discharge and after 3 months. Clinical and echocardiographic variables were assessed.", 
    "13": "N-ANF showed the closest correlations to clinical and echocardiographic measures of heart failure severity, e.g. NYHA functional class, furosemide dose, exercise tolerance, systolic and diastolic function. Plasma norepinephrine, dopamine and renin activity decreased after 3 months on both treatments, in contrast to a small increase in NPY-LI which was greater (by 3.9 pmol/l, 95% CI 1.2-6.6) in the metoprolol group. N-ANF increased on metoprolol, and decreased on xamoterol (difference: 408 pmol/l, 95% CI 209-607). Increase above median of NPY-LI (>25.2 pmol/l, odds ratio 2.8, P=0.0050) and N-ANF (>1043 pmol/l, odds ratio 2.8, P=0.0055) were related to long term (mean follow-up 6.8 years) cardiovascular mortality.", 
    "14": "Decreased neurohormonal activity, reflecting both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, was found 3 months after an acute myocardial infarction with heart failure treated with beta-receptor antagonists. The small increase in NPY-LI may suggest increased sympathetic activity or reduced clearance from plasma. The observed changes of N-ANF may be explained by changes in cardiac preload, renal function, and differences in beta-receptor mediated inhibition of atrial release of N-ANF. NPY-LI, and N-ANF at discharge were related to long term cardiovascular mortality.", 
    "15": "The dobutamine echocardiographic test (DET) is frequently used in coronary artery disease to detect viable myocardium, but few data are available about its role in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical role of DET and the prognostic implications of the 'contractile reserve' in patients with IDCM treated with optimal medical therapy, including beta-blockade (BB). A total of 51 patients with IDCM underwent DET at diagnosis. A positive response to DET (DET+) was judged to be a significant increase (> or =10 points) in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with a peak value > or =40%, and a reversed restrictive left ventricular filling pattern (RFP) if present at baseline study. Improvement at follow-up was defined according to combined clinical and echo-Doppler criteria. In all, 22 patients (43%) were classified as DET+. DET+ patients were less symptomatic (P<0.001), with lower heart rate (P<0.01), less enlarged left and right ventricles (P<0.0001 and P<0.05), higher LVEF (P=0.0001), less frequent RFP (P=0.01), and lower pulmonary pressure (P<0.01). At follow-up (34+/-16 months), 21 patients had improved, while four had died and seven had received a transplant. Among clinical data, NYHA classes I-II (OR=0.25, P=0.07) and BB dosage (OR=0.97, P<0.005) were significantly associated with higher transplant-free survival at multivariate analysis. The addition of DET+ (OR=0.34, P<0.05) showed a moderate but significant improvement of sensitivity, but the predictive power of the model remained low (sensitivity, 0.67; specificity, 0.55). Absence of left bundle branch block (OR=0.27, P<0.01) and BB dosage (OR=1.03, P<0.005), but not DET+, were predictive of improvement. In patients with IDCM, DET response is associated with a more favourable outcome, since it suggests an earlier stage of the disease. However, in the light of our data, the incremental prognostic power of DET response compared to clinical evaluation at enrollment, despite being significant, seems to be of limited clinical value. Further studies should be carried out in order to clarify the prognostic value of DET in IDCM patients.", 
    "16": "The anticonvulsive potential of classical antiepileptics co-administered with beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists against generalized tonic-clonic seizures was evaluated in the model of maximal electroshock (MES)-induced convulsions. Propranolol, acebutolol, metoprolol and atenolol were tested in the doses not affecting the electroconvulsive threshold. Propranolol and metoprolol lowered the ED(50) of valproate and diazepam. Acebutolol reduced valproate's but not diazepam's ED(50) value. In contrast, hydrophilic atenolol, not penetrating via blood-brain barrier, affected neither the action of valproate nor diazepam. None of the studied drugs changed the protective activity of carbamazepine and phenytoin against MES. beta-blockers per se did not alter the motor performance of mice. Moreover, propranolol and metoprolol did not influence diazepam-evoked impairment of locomotor activity. The free plasma and brain levels of antiepileptic drugs were not affected by beta-blockers. In conclusion, the use of certain beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as propranolol and metoprolol, might improve the antiepileptic potential of valproate and diazepam.", 
    "17": "Nebivolol, compared with classical beta-blockers, exerts a high selectivity for beta-adrenergic receptors and also reduces peripheral vascular resistance by modulating nitric oxide (NO) release. This dual mechanism of action leads to effective control of blood pressure at a low degree of beta-blockade and explains the lack of any interference with lipid metabolism. For the same reason, the tolerability profile of nebivolol is highly favorable compared with the classical beta-blockers, with less fatigue and dyspnea in hypertensive subjects, and with an improvement of functional capacity and exercise tolerance in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Furthermore, contrary to atenolol and propranolol, nebivolol does not diminish specific airway conductance. Compared with other first-line antihypertensive agents, nebivolol was shown to be better tolerated than nifedipine and enalapril, and to have a positive effect on general wellbeing. Among the currently available antihypertensive drugs, nebivolol therefore appears to have a most alteractive safety and tolerability profile, which can be attributed to its NO-mediated effects allowing effective control of hypertension at a lower degree of beta-blockade than with first-generation beta-blockers.", 
    "18": "Alterations in the function and structure of the blood vessel wall account for most clinical events in the coronary and cerebrovascular circulation such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Cardiovascular drugs may exert beneficial effects on the vascular wall both at the level of the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells. Therefore, endothelial mediators, in particular nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin (ET), are of special interest. Drugs can modulate the expression and actions of NO, a vasodilator with antiproliferative and antithrombotic properties, and of ET, a potent vasoconstrictor and proliferative mitogenic agent. The most successful drugs in this context are statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors. While statins increase the expression of NO synthase. ACE-inhibitors increase the release of NO via bradykinin-mediated mechanisms. Antioxidant properties of drugs are also important, as oxidative stress is crucial in atherosclerotic vascular disease. These properties may explain part of the effects of calcium antagonists and ACE-inhibitors. Indeed, angiotensin II stimulates NAD(P)H oxidases responsible for the formation of superoxide, which inactivates NO. ACE-Inhibitors thus increase the bioavailability of NO. Newer cardiovascular drugs such as nebivolol are able to directly stimulate NO release from the endothelium both in isolated arteries and in the human forearm circulation. ET receptor antagonists may exert beneficial effects in the vessel wall by preventing the effects of ET at its receptors and by reducing ET production. In summary, cardiovascular drugs have important effects on the vessel wall, which may be clinically relevant for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "19": "Hypertension is common and increases the risk of death from coronary artery disease and cerebral vascular disease. The reason for treating hypertension is to prevent the long-term complications of this disorder. Many studies of antihypertensive therapy have produced only modest reductions in coronary events; in particular, with the use of beta-blockers. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown a lesser effect of these drugs on primary prevention of coronary events, cardiovascular and total mortality with respect to other antihypertensive approaches based on the use of low-dose diuretic therapy, especially in the elderly, even if the reduction of stroke and heart failure (HF) were similar. New beta-blockers with vasodilating properties due to the capacity to enhance the release of endothelial nitric oxide, then lessening a contributory mechanism to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis as endothelial damage and dysfunction, seem to possess considerable potential in the treatment of hypertension, particularly in terms of improvement of cardiovascular outcome of patients. In HF, there is now considerable interest in the therapeutic use of beta-blockade. Some recent clinical trials have demonstrated conclusive evidence of the beneficial effects of beta-blocker therapy on survival in chronic HF. As a result of these data, beta-blocker therapy has become part of standard therapy for patients with chronic HF, in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors and diuretics. The treatment is, in general, well tolerated. There are, however, some unanswered questions. One is whether some beta-blockers may be better than others. The major mortality benefit is probably a class-effect of beta1-adrenoceptor blockade, but the differences between beta-blockers might be clinically relevant. For example, it is under debate whether ancillary properties of some beta-blockers, such as the capability of exerting antioxidant effects or enhancing the nitric oxide production, may contribute to the clinical effects of these drugs. Future clinical trials will report over the next few years and help to answer the question about differences in mortality effects among types of beta-blocking agents, thus correctly defining the precise role of these drugs in the wide spectrum of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "20": "Increased oxidative stress has been postulated as one of the main mechanisms underlying stunned myocardium, and may play an important role in and during development of heart failure. Pharmacological interventions may attenuate or prevent detrimental effects of oxygen free radicals on the myocardium. Nebivolol has been shown to attenuate contractile dysfunction in hydroxyl radical mediated injury, but the mechanism(s) remain unknown. It was investigated whether nebivolol could partly attenuate the contractile dysfunction through a direct effect on the myofilaments. In demembranized muscles from explanted human hearts, nebivolol induced a slight desensitization of the myofilaments to calcium. Therefore, during the calcium overload that occurs during reperfusion after an ischemic event, the contractile dysfunction is less severe in the presence of nebivolol. We conclude that the protection of nebivolol in hydroxyl radical induced contractile dysfunction is mediated in part through a direct effect on the myofilaments, in addition to the previously shown preservation of sarcoplasmic reticulum function.", 
    "21": "Nebivolol, a racemic mixture of (S,R,R,R) and (R,S,S,S) enantiomers, is the most beta1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist currently available for clinical use. However, its haemodynamic effects differ from those of classical beta-adrenoceptor antagonists as a result of a vasodilating action. Nebivolol is devoid of alpha-adrenergic antagonist actions, and the detailed mechanism of its vasodilator action is unknown. Nebivolol relaxes precontracted strips of canine coronary and carotid artery only if the endothelium is intact, and such relaxation is antagonized by inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, implicating the endothelial L-arginine/NO mechanism. Nebivolol and atenolol have been compared in phenylephrine preconstricted dorsal hand veins of 11 healthy men. Nebivolol caused venodilation, which was antagonized by N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (LNMMA), whereas atenolol did not, suggesting that such a mechanism could also operate in human veins. Venodilation could be functionally important in reducing cardiac pre-load. Beta2-adrenoceptor stimulation increases forearm blood flow (FBF) by activating the L-arginine/NO pathway but nebivolol lacks direct beta2-adrenoceptor agonist activity. Resistance vessel function has been studied by measuring FBF by venous occlusion plethysmography in healthy men during brachial artery infusions of racemic nebivolol and its enantiomers, atenolol, carbachol (a stable analogue of acetylcholine that vasodilates this vascular bed, in part by activating the L-arginine/NO pathway), nitroprusside (a NO donor that causes non-endothelium-dependent vasodilation through the same effector mechanism as endothelium-dependent agonists) and LNMMA. Nebivolol (354 microg/min) increased FBF by 91 +/- 18% (mean +/- SE, n = 8; p < 0.01), whereas an equimolar dose of atenolol had no significant effect. LNMMA inhibited responses to nebivolol and carbachol to a significantly greater extent than it reduced responses to nitroprusside. Antagonism of nebivolol by LNMMA was abolished by L-arginine. The (S,R,R,R) and (R,S,S,S) enantiomers caused similar increases of FBF. To determine whether brachial artery infusion of nebivolol causes vasodilation in the forearm resistance vasculature of patients with essential hypertension and to investigate the possible involvement of the L-arginine/NO pathway, we studied otherwise healthy volunteers with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Nebivolol (88.5, 177 and 354 microg/min, each dose for 6 min) caused similar vasodilatation as in normotensive subjects, and these responses were sensitive to inhibition by LNMMA. If acute effects of nebivolol on the L-arginine/NO pathway persist during chronic treatment of patients with hypertension or heart failure, this could reduce cardiac after-load as well as pre-load, improve organ perfusion and reduce atherogenesis and thrombosis.", 
    "22": "Heart failure is unique among the major cardiovascular disorders in that it alone is increasing in prevalence while there has been a striking decrease in other conditions. Some of this can be attributed to the aging of the U.S. and European populations. The ability to salvage patients with myocardial damage is also a major factor, as these patients may develop progression of left ventricular dysfunction due to deleterious remodelling of the heart. This process involves structural and conformational changes in the heart characterized by pathological hypertrophy and fibrosis. The net effect is deterioration in cardiac function and the onset of heart failure. Neurohormonal activation is known to be a major factor in promoting cardiac remodelling. Increased neurohormone levels systemically and within the heart lead to increased load on the heart. Many neurohormones involved also directly act as growth factors on cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. Due to its central role in remodelling, neurohormonal activation has emerged as an inviting target for therapeutic interventions. The use of agents to block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems has been shown to inhibit (and sometimes even reverse) cardiac remodelling and to improve the clinical course of patients with cardiac dysfunction. Neurohormonal activation is known to be widespread and there is evidence that additional agents such as endothelin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) may be involved in the remodelling process. Clinical trials evaluating the effects of blocking these agents are currently under way and should soon provide important information about therapy.", 
    "23": "The vascular endothelium synthesizes and releases a spectrum of vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide and endothelin. In atherosclerosis, the delicate balance between endothelium-derived factors is disturbed. Endothelin acts as the natural counterpart to endothelium-derived nitric oxide, which exerts vasodilating, antithrombotic and antiproliferative effects, and inhibits leukocyte adhesion to the vascular wall. Besides its blood pressure increasing effect in man, endothelin also induces vascular and myocardial hypertrophy, which are independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The derangement of endothelial function in atherosclerosis is likely to be caused in part by genetic factors, but is also due to cardiovascular risk factors. Endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerosis is crucial for the development of the disease process in the vasculature and is therefore an important therapeutic target. However, the efficacy of pharmacotherapy aimed at an improvement in endothelial function depends on the individual risk factor profile of the patient.", 
    "24": "We examined whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) prevent isoproterenol (ISO)-induced left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in dogs. The effects of a large dose of ISO, 1 microg/kg/min, 3 h infusion, were investigated in three groups with simultaneous infusion of an ACE inhibitor (quinaprilat), ARB (candesartan) or saline. ISO infusion significantly decreased LV dP/dt, LV ejection fraction and LV fractional shortening, and significantly increased tau, the time constant of isovolume relaxation of LV, and LV end diastolic pressure. All of these changes were significantly attenuated in both the ACE inhibitor and ARB groups, especially in the ARB group. Serum levels of creatinin kinase isoform MB, lactate dehydrogenase and lipid peroxide were significantly increased by ISO. However, the increases in these markers of myocardial damage were significantly diminished by simultaneous infusion of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, especially by ARB. In conclusion, an ACE inhibitor and ARB prevent LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as myocardial damage induced by excess beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "25": "The cardioprotective effects of bisoprolol were studied in a rat model of severe heart failure induced by autoimmune myocarditis. Twenty-eight days after immunization, Lewis rats were divided into four groups: 0.1 mg/kg/day bisoprolol (Group 0.1), 1.0 mg/kg/day bisoprolol (Group 1) and 10 mg/kg/day bisoprolol (Group 10), and vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose; Group V) (all groups, n = 13). After oral administration for 1 month, heart weight, mean blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, peak left ventricular pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, +/- dP/dt, and area of fibrosis were measured. Although bisoprolol reduced heart rate (399+/-11/min in Group V, 382+/-10/min in Group 0.1, 348+/-8/min in Group 1 and 302+/-9/min in Group 10) and increased survival (62% in Group V, 69% in Group 0.1, and 100% in Group 1 and Group 10) in a dose-dependent manner, this drug did not change heart weight, the area of myocardial fibrosis or hemodynamic parameters. These observations suggested that bisoprolol may improve survival independently of its effect on left ventricular function by reducing sudden death in patients with severe heart failure.", 
    "26": "Sudden cardiac death describes the unexpected natural death from cardiac cause within a short time period from the onset of symptoms (usually one hour) in a person without any prior condition that would appear fatal. The mechanism is generally a malignant ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation). Sudden death is a major public health problem as it accounts for 3 to 400,000 deaths annually in the United States. Risk factors, physiopathological mechanisms, disease states associated with sudden death, and primary and secondary prevention treatments are reviewed.", 
    "27": "Despite prospective randomized control trials showing that beta blockers, aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents improve survival rates after myocardial infarction (MI), these agents are routinely underutilized.", 
    "28": "Our aim was to determine the frequency with which cardiologists at a government, university-affiliated teaching hospital prescribe aspirin, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel blocking agents (CCBs), and lipid-lowering agents in patients post MI. The patients were followed by their primary care physicians in this hospital after discharge. We evaluated changes in patients' medical management at an average of 24 months after discharge from the acute event.", 
    "29": "Clinical data relative to long-term use of life-saving drugs in 156 survivors of definite MI (WHO criteria) at a government, university-affiliated teaching hospital were analyzed over a 24-month follow-up period.", 
    "30": "Over 90% of patients with acute MI were given aspirin and beta blockers at discharge. About 50% of these patients were given ACE inhibitors, only 25% were prescribed CCBs, and 21% were given lipid-lowering agents. At 24 months of follow-up, the percentage of patients receiving aspirin, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors had fallen to 88% (p = 0.0408), 71% (p < 0.0001), and 43% (p = 0.1122), respectively, whereas use of lipid-lowering agents slightly increased (p = 0.4277). Use of CCBs had also fallen (p = 0.0001). Nonetheless, the use of aspirin, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors was higher than that in the National Registry of similar patients at discharge (p < 0.0001).", 
    "31": "Patients at a government, university-affiliated teaching hospital are likely to receive life-saving therapy at discharge, in accordance with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines. There is a modest decrease in intake of these life-saving drugs during the follow-up period. As documented earlier, cardiologists in a teaching institution are more likely to prescribe established life-saving drugs than do primary care physicians. However, full-time primary care physicians at a university-affiliated teaching hospital continue to use these therapies at a higher rate than do those outside academic medicine.", 
    "32": "Recent genetic and molecular technology have shown that genetic abnormalities related to the cardiac ion channels can be a cause of some hereditary arrhythmic diseases. Until now, advanced analysis has proceeded especially in congenital long QT syndrome, and six different subtypes have been identified in Romano-Ward syndrome and 2 subtypes in Jervell & Lange-Nielsen syndrome. Since the mechanism of QT interval prolongation in each subtype is based on the malfunction of different cardiac ion channels, the same pharmacological treatment may show different antiarrhythmic effects for each subtype. In this paper, we review some of the hereditary arrhythmic diseases and discuss the possibility of gene-specific treatment in such diseases.", 
    "33": "The beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) plays an important role in the regulation of heart function and has been extensively studied in recent decades. In vitro studies have shown down-regulation of beta-AR density in heart failure and cardiac conditions that may lead to heart failure. As in vitro measurements on cardiac tissue samples do not allow longitudinal and regional assessment of myocardial beta-ARs in humans, new methods are being developed to measure beta-ARs in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). Studies using PET and the radioligand [(11)C]CGP 12177 have shown promising results that are in agreement with those of in vitro studies. However, the radiochemical synthesis of [(11)C]CGP 12177 is very demanding, preventing its widespread use. Hence, new radioligands are being developed using simpler methods of radiochemical synthesis. ( S)-[(11)C]CGP 12388 has been presented as a promising new radioligand. So far, in vivo measurements of beta-AR density using PET have mainly been performed to confirm in vitro studies. Using the full potential of PET, performance of regional measurements and longitudinal studies might add further knowledge on the pathophysiological role of the beta-AR in cardiac disease and the effect of interventions. Furthermore, PET might gain a role in the clinical management of patients with abnormalities of cardiac contractile function.", 
    "34": "Genetically defined strains of the yeast Hansenula polymorpha were constructed from a clone of H. polymorpha CBS4732 with very low mating and sporulation abilities. Mating, spore viability, and the percentage of four-spore-containing asci were increased to a level at which tetrad analysis was possible. Auxotrophic mutations in 30 genes were isolated and used to construct strains with multiple markers for mapping studies, transformation with plasmid DNA, and mutant screening. Various other types of mutants were isolated and characterized, among them mutants that displayed an altered morphology, methanol-utilization deficient mutants and strains impaired in the biosynthesis of alcohol oxidase and catalase. Also, the mutability of H. polymorpha CBS4732 vs H. polymorpha NCYC495 was compared. The data revealed clear differences in frequencies of appearance and mutational spectra of some mutants isolated. Many of the mutants isolated had good mating abilities, and diploids resulting from their crossing displayed high sporulation frequencies and high spore viability. Most of the markers used revealed normal Mendelian segregation during meiosis. The frequency of tetratype spore formation was lower than in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggesting a lower frequency of recombination during the second meiotic division. The properties of genetically defined strains of H. polymorpha CBS4732 as well as their advantages for genetics and molecular studies are discussed.", 
    "35": "Emotional arousal has been shown to enhance memory, an effect that is blocked by propranolol suggesting that the noradrenergic system is important in the mechanism action. Because PTSD has as prominent features heightened arousal and distressing memories, the current study was undertaken to examine whether PTSD subjects differed from controls in emotional enhancement of memory. Seventeen subjects with PTSD and 21 controls received either placebo or 40 mg of propranolol prior to exposure to either an emotionally arousing or emotionally neutral, narrated slide story. Recall, measured 1 wk later, for the arousing story was enhanced and this effect was reduced by propranolol. PTSD and control subjects did not differ in the acquisition and retention of memories under emotionally arousing or emotionally neutral conditions, nor were differential effects of propranolol observed between the two groups.", 
    "36": "Five groups of drugs are presently available to reduce the symptoms associated with angina pectoris: beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists, nitrates, potassium channel agonists and trimetazidine. beta-blockers remain the drugs of first strategy since they are unique in reducing major cardiac events. Angiogenesis and gene therapy are still in the field of research. The second therapeutic goal is to reduce cardiovascular morbi-mortality. Inhibitors of platelet aggregation, hypolipemic agents and converting enzyme inhibitors have proved their efficacy in these fields. Conversely, vitamins C, E and B, antibiotics against intra-cellular germs and substitutive hormonotherapy of post-menopausal women must yet prove their efficacy.", 
    "37": "Dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of diverse causes. Untreated, this condition will likely progress to advanced heart failure, sudden death, or both. There have been a number of significant advances in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Treatments that counteract ventricular remodeling with neurohumoral blockade have substantially improved the outcome for many patients. Although cardiac transplantation is of benefit to patients with advanced disease, the growing donor heart shortage limits this option. New treatments are clearly needed, and many are being actively investigated. As the genetic and cellular derangements that result in dilated cardiomyopathy are better understood, new therapeutic targets will be identified in the quest to restore normal cardiac structure and function.", 
    "38": "Functional mitral regurgitation is usually neglected during the course of dilated cardiomyopathies. However, functional mitral regurgitation is a sensitive marker of decreased survival. Recent development of treatments such as new surgical approach, permanent biventricular pacing and beta-blockade therapy lead to assess and treat more specifically the accompanying functional mitral regurgitation in congestive heart failure.", 
    "39": "Understanding precisely how the heart can recognize and respond to many different extracellular signalling molecules, such as neurotransmitters, hormones and growth factors, will aid the identification of new therapeutic targets through which cardiovascular diseases can be combated. In recent years, we have learned more about the complex interactions that occur between the receptors and the signalling pathways of the heart and its environment. Most of these discoveries have focused on the most common type of cardiac receptor - the seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor or G-protein-coupled receptor.", 
    "40": "Aminoglycosides remains the mainstay in the treatment of gram-negative infections despite their potential oto-and nephrotoxicity although alternatives with equal or better efficacy are available. Several approaches were investigated to decrease aminoglycosides nephrotoxicity. Among them, only the once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides has been brought to the clinic and physicians are now increasingly adopting this approach to reduce the toxicity of these agents. The incidence of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity can be further reduced in view of the recent data on the circadian variations of their nephrotoxicity. In fact, it has been clearly demonstrated in both experimental animals and humans that the toxicity is maximal when the drug is injected during the rest period compared with the activity period. Thus, injecting aminoglycosides once-daily at the time of the lowest toxicity is actually the most interesting and clinically applicable approach to reduce aminoglycosides toxicity.", 
    "41": "Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. In the United States, there are more than 5 million patients with heart failure and over 500,000 newly diagnosed cases each year. Numerous advances have been made in our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms contributing to sodium and water retention in this condition. Important alterations in the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have been described in heart failure, allowing the use of mechanism-specific treatments such as beta-adrenergic receptor antagonism and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. As our understanding of the roles of the natriuretic peptides and the arginine vasopressin-aquaporin-2 system in the pathophysiology of heart failure evolves, treatments directed toward the alterations in these systems in heart failure can be further developed.", 
    "42": "We recently reported that cardiomyocytes could be differentiated from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in vitro by 5-azacytidine treatment. In native cardiomyocytes, adrenergic and muscarinic receptors play crucial roles in mediating heart rate, conduction velocity, contractility, and cardiac hypertrophy. We investigated whether these receptors are expressed in differentiated CMG cells, and if so, whether they have downstream signaling systems.", 
    "43": "Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that CMG cells had already expressed alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, and alpha(1D)-adrenergic receptor mRNA before 5-azacytidine treatment, whereas expression of beta(1)-, beta(2)-adrenergic and M(1)-, M(2)-muscarinic receptors was first detected at 1 day. Phenylephrine dose-dependently induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which was completely inhibited by prazosin, and significantly increased cell size. Isoproterenol augmented cAMP by 38-fold, which was fully inhibited by propranolol. Isoproterenol (10(-7) mol/L) increased the spontaneous beating rate by 47.6% (basal, 127+/-16 bpm), and propranolol and CGP20712A (beta(1)-selective blocker) reduced it by 79.0% and 71.0%, respectively, whereas ICI118551 (beta(2)-selective blocker) induced slight reduction. Cell motion, percent shortening, and contractile velocity were increased by 37.5%, 26.9%, and 50.6%, respectively, in response to isoproterenol. Phenylephrine and isoproterenol augmented ANP and BNP gene expressions. Carbachol increased IP(3) by 32-fold, which was markedly inhibited by atropine as well as AFDX116 (M(2)-selective blocker) measured by radioimmunoassay.", 
    "44": "These findings indicate that CMG cells expressed alpha(1A), alpha(1B), and alpha(1D) receptors before differentiation and expressed beta(1), beta(2), M(1), and M(2) receptors after they obtained the cardiomyocyte phenotype. These receptors had functional signal transduction pathways and could modulate cell function.", 
    "45": "Ventricular tachycardia occurs infrequently in patients without structural heart disease. These tachycardias commonly originate from the right ventricular outflow tract. However, the presence of more than one arrhythmogenic substrate in a patient without structural heart disease is rare. We report such a 48-year old patient with no structural heart disease who presented with three morphology wide QRS tachycardia. A brief review of the pathophysiology and management is discussed.", 
    "46": "We conducted a nested case-control study to evaluate the relationship between antihypertensive agent class and the incidence of initial cardiovascular events. A total of 7.443 patients being treated with an antihypertensive agent in 1985-1986 were enrolled for follow-up of up to 5 years. A total of 362 patients (186 males and 176 females) developed cardiovascular events. Age (5-year interval) and sex-matched controls were then randomly selected. A Multiple logistic regression analysis was done to control for the effects of confounding factors. The results showed that the use of diuretics and beta-blockers was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events (odds ratio [OR] =0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-0.86, and OR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.56-1.02, respectively), against a significantly raised risk associated with the use of calcium antagonists (OR=1.34, 95% CI: 1.03-1.80). However, as far as stroke was concerned, there was no significant association of risk with the use of any agent. The control group was found to be similar to the case group with respect to the changes in the treatment program during the follow-up period. The results suggest that the calcium antagonists used in Japan during the period of 1985-1990 constituted a potential risk for the occurrence of cardiovascular events.", 
    "47": "Ulcerative colitis is characterized by dysfunctional motility. Our main objective in this investigation was to study the effect of an acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis on the expression and function of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in the rat colon. Inflammation was induced by administering acetic acid intrarectally into rats. Levels of myeloperoxidase activity and beta(3)-adrenoceptor mRNA were measured in colon samples taken following acetic acid administration. Relaxation responses to beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists were also studied. Ulcerative colitis was associated with significantly elevated levels of myeloperoxidase activity in the colon segments. Levels of beta(3)-adrenoceptor mRNA as well as the relaxation responses to isoprenaline and BRL 37344 were however not significantly different between inflamed and control tissue. Acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats was not associated with changes in the expression and/or function of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in the rat colon. Therefore, the dysfunctional motility that is characteristic of ulcerative colitis, is not likely to be due to changes in beta(3)-adrenergic mechanisms in this model.",

    "59": "The blood pressures of hypertensive patients living in the southeastern region of the United States are less responsive to several classes of antihypertensive medications. Birth weights are lower among blacks and those living in the Southeast, and evidence suggests that this developmental difference increases blood pressure. As an initial step in addressing the possibility that birth weight influences response to antihypertensive therapy, we examined the relationship between birth weight and class of antihypertensive medication among 3236 Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina with high blood pressure. Birth weight, obtained from birth certificates, was not related to use of either diuretics or beta blockers. However, among black women, there was an inverse association between birth weight and use of calcium channel antagonists (P=0.03), which persisted after adjustment for the number of antihypertensive medications. Among white men, low and high birth weights were associated with greater use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors than in men of normal birth weight (P=0.002 for quadratic trend [U-shaped]). This association remained after adjustment for comorbid conditions, including congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus, which were associated with birth weight and for which angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended. The findings indicate that birth weight is associated with use of calcium channel antagonists in black women and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in white men. These observations suggest that further study of the relationship between birth weight and blood pressure responses to various antihypertensive medications may help elucidate pathophysiological factors contributing to geographic and racial disparities in therapeutic efficacy.",

Both intravenous and oral sotalol led to bradycardia, decreased in cardiac index, increased in left ventricular filling pressure as well as in systemic vascular resistance. The stroke volume increased significantly after sotalol intravenous, but not changed at peak action after oral sotalol. During a follow-up of 3 to 6 months, oral sotalol prevented the recurrent of arrhythmias in 12 of 16 patients who were response to electrophysiology testing.

    "65": "To address this gap in our knowledge, transmembrane action potentials (APs) from epicardial, M, and endocardial cells were recorded simultaneously, together with a transmural ECG from arterially perfused canine left ventricular wedge preparations exposed to combined I(Kr) (d-sotalol; 100 micromol/L) and I(Ks) (chromanol 293B; 30 to 60 micromol/L) block. Under baseline conditions, the T wave was typically upright; epicardium repolarized first, coinciding with the peak of the T wave, and the M cells repolarized last, coinciding with the end of the T wave (T(end)). Complex (inverted, biphasic, and triphasic) T waves developed following combined I(Kr) and I(Ks) block. M and epicardial APs prolonged dramatically, so that the endocardial AP was now the earliest to repolarize, coinciding with the first nadir of the complex T wave. In the case of biphasic/triphasic or inverted T waves, Tend coincided with repolarization of either M or epicardial cells, whichever was the last to repolarize. QT intervals prolonged from 286+/-13 msec up to 744+/-148 msec and transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) increased from 33+/-10 msec up to 244+/-71 msec. Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) developed in M and epicardial cells, evoking extrasystoles that precipitated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Acceleration-induced EADs and T wave alternans also were observed.", 
    "66": "Combined I(Kr) and I(Ks) block gives rise to inverted, biphasic, and triphasic T wave morphologies, a dramatic increase in TDR, and a high incidence of EADs. The diversity of T wave morphologies derives from a preferential AP prolongation of different transmural layers leading to variation in the predominance of voltage gradients on either side of the M cell region. Our study provides direct evidence linking EADs that arise in ventricular epicardial and M cells to the triggered beats that precipitate polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Our results also suggest possible guidelines for the estimation of TDR from complex T waves appearing in the precordial leads of the surface ECG.",

    "69": "The effects of isoproterenol, which was administered into the lateral ventricle, hippocampus, frontal cortex, or amygdala, were determined in rats under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) 72-s schedule. The effects of beta adrenergic antagonists on the actions of isoproterenol also were determined.", 
    "70": "When injected bilaterally into the hippocampus, isoproterenol (1-30 microg/side) decreased response rate and increased reinforcement rate in a dose-dependent manner. The minimum dose of isoproterenol required for changing DRL behavior was 6 microg (i.e., 3 microg bilaterally), compared to 10 microg for intracerebroventricular and 60 microg (30 microg bilaterally) for administration into the frontal cortex or amygdala. These effects of isoproterenol were blocked by the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol. In addition, the effects of isoproterenol injected intrahippocampally also were antagonized dose-dependently by the beta-1 selective antagonist betaxolol and the beta-2 selective antagonist ICI 118,551. The relative potency of these antagonists for blocking the effects of isoproterenol suggested predominant mediation by beta-1 adrenergic receptors.",

    "72": "We investigated the mechanism by which acetylcholine (ACh) regulates insulin secretion from rat pancreatic beta-cells. In an extracellular solution with 5.5 mM glucose, ACh increased the rate of insulin secretion from rat islets. In islets treated with bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), a PKC inhibitor, ACh still increased insulin secretion, but the increment was lower than that without BIM. In the presence of nifedipine, an L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, on the other hand, ACh did not increase insulin secretion. In isolated rat pancreatic beta-cells, ACh caused depolarization followed by action potentials. This ACh effect was observed even in cells treated with BIM. In the presence of nifedipine, ACh caused only depolarization. These ACh effects were prevented by atropine. In the perforated whole-cell configuration, ramp pulses from -90 to -50 mV induced membrane currents mostly through ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (K(ATP)). These currents were reduced in size by ACh in cells either treated or untreated with BIM; whereas the loading of cells with U-73122 (a phospholipase C inhibitor) or BAPTA/AM (a Ca(2+) chelator) abolished the ACh effect. In the standard whole-cell configuration, ACh reduced the currents through K(ATP) with 0.5 mM EGTA, but not with 10 mM EGTA, in the pipette solution. Intracellular application of GDPbetaS or heparin also inhibited the ACh effect. In the inside-out single-channel recordings, elevation of the Ca(2+) concentration inside the membrane from 10 nM-10 microM decreased K(ATP) activity only in the presence of ATP. The affinity of ATP to K(ATP) became 4.5 times higher with the higher concentration of Ca(2+). These results suggest that Ca(2+) from ACh receptor signaling modulates the sensitivity of K(ATP) to ATP. A positive-feedback mechanism of intracellular Ca(2+)-dependent Ca(2+) influx was also demonstrated.", 
    "73": "Because many antihypertensive drugs can affect airway function, the treatment of hypertension in patients with airway dysfunction is complex. For example, the worsening or precipitation of asthma by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is well-recognized, but beta(1)-adrenoceptor blockers that exert mild beta(2)-agonist effects, and those that modulate the endogenous production of nitric oxide, affect airway function to a lesser extent. Therapy with selective alpha(1)-blockers is not contraindicated in cases of chronic airway obstruction. Conversely, alpha(2)-agonists must not be given to asthmatic subjects because they can adversely affect the bronchi. Calcium channel blockers do not exert severe side effects on the airways. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may cause cough and exacerbate or even induce asthma; however, angiotensin II type I (AT(1)) antagonists do not cause cough. 5-Hydroxytryptamine modifiers such as urapidil are a treatment option for patients with chronic airway obstruction. In patients with airway dysfunction, we suggest treatment with thiazide diuretics as the initial drug choice, and calcium channel blockers if the response is poor. In the case of no response, calcium channel blockers alone must be used. However, there is no strict rule because individual patients may respond differently to individual drugs and drug combinations. Consequently, it is important to adopt a flexible approach. For patients who are unresponsive to the aforementioned drugs, AT(1) receptor antagonists, newer beta(1)-adrenoceptor-blocking agents with ancillary properties (eg, celiprolol or nebivolol), and/or vasodilators can be considered.",

A mother and son with functional abdominal pain unresponsive to conventional treatment had complete resolution of symptoms with treatment directed at the autonomic dysfunction identified by testing. The authors recommend autonomic testing in patients with functional abdominal pain and suggest that autonomic dysfunction plays a direct and intrinsic role in the mechanism of these disorders and their symptoms.",

    "80": "The treatment of thoracic or abdominal aorta aneurysms with endoprostheses or aortic stents consists of placing the stents within the aorta to exclude the aneurysm, followed by inflation of a balloon inserted through the vessel in order to fix the stent to the vascular walls. The procedure is minimally invasive, causes little pain, and is performed by femoral arteriotomy or puncture. Absolute immobility of the lower limbs is required if lesions are to be avoided and the duration can not be foreseen. Patients are usually elderly, have severe vascular disease, hypertension, ischemic heart disease and sometimes also have renal dysfunction that may deteriorate with the use of iodine contrast media. Epidural anesthesia is preferred for placement of an abdominal stent, with general anesthesia used if epidural anesthesia is contraindicated. Surgery is performed in an angio-radiologic operating theater that is specially prepared for emergency laparotomy or thoracotomy. General anesthesia is used for thoracic aneurysms. When the endoprosthesis is implanted, it is important to prevent distal migration of the stent caused by heart beat and arterial pressure generated by the root of the aorta. A sympathic block provides adequate mean blood pressure (approximately 70-80 mmHg) for preventing migration. Five minutes before release of the stent, esmolol (0.5 mg/kg) is given along with nitroglycerine (titrated to dose-response) in perfusion, and upon release of the stent and sufflation of the balloon, a Valsalva maneuver is carried out obtain a heart rate of 40 to 50 beats/min and a mean arterial pressure of 40 to 45 mmHg. Postoperative recovery occurs in a special observation ward in the first few hours after surgery, with strict monitoring of diuresis and hydration. Analgesic requirements are minimal and intravenous metamizol or ketorolac are adequate. In conclusion, stent implant is a complex procedure in patients with severe associated disease who require strict and full monitoring during surgery and in the first few hours afterwards.", 
    "81": "Ultra-short-acting beta-blockers play an important role in perioperative control of blood pressure, particularly in situations requiring rapid reversibility of effects. Esmolol seems to offer many desirable effects of beta-blockers, in addition to a short half-life and rapid finalization of effect. Combined therapy with vasodilators provides optimum hemodynamic control in most cases.Ultra-short action beta-blockers have proven effective for the control of arrhythmias, particularly for tachycardias of the narrow complex. The future may bring applications such as desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors, associated with reaction to stress during cardiac surgery. The role of beta-blockers in primary myocardial protection against ischemic lesions is being investigated.", 
    "82": "When faced with a patient with exercise-induced syncope, it is important to exclude heart disease. Nevertheless, neurally-mediated syncopes should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis and the tilt table test is essential to establish this diagnosis. We report the case of an 11-year-old boy, who presented recurrent exercise-induced fainting. The results of cardiac and neurologic tests were negative. The tilt table test with pharmacological challenge with isoproterenol infusion induced arterial hypotension and presyncope, and a diagnosis of neurally-mediated syncope was made. After initiating beta-blocker treatment, the patient has remained asymptomatic during a follow-up of 10 months.",

During a mean follow-up of 9.4 months, there were 49 cardiac deaths (DD, n = 4; ID, n = 26; II, n = 19). The DD genotype was significantly associated with a lower mortality than the other genotypes (p = 0.0363) by Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, site of myocardial infarction, Killip functional class, reperfusion therapy during acute phase, ACE inhibitor use, and beta-blocker use.",

    "95": "It is not completely understood whether nitric oxide donors and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have anti-atherosclerotic effects. The anti-atherosclerotic effects of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists and nitric oxide donors on severe atherosclerosis induced by cholesterol and inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis were determined. Six groups of New Zealand white male rabbits were treated for 10 weeks, under the following regimens: group I: high-cholesterol diet (HCD) (standard diet plus 0.5% cholesterol); group II: HCD plus N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase; group III: HCD plus L-NAME and isosorbide dinitrate; group IV: HCD plus L-NAME and nitroglycerin; group V: HCD plus L-NAME and nipradilol (beta-blocker with nitric oxide-releasing action); and group VI: HCD plus L-NAME and atenolol (beta-blocker). Serum lipid levels did not differ among the six groups. Blood pressure and heart rates were slightly decreased in groups V and VI. The atherosclerotic area and aortic cholesterol increased in L-NAME-treated animals but not in animals in group V. The endothelium-dependent relaxations and basal nitric oxide release were impaired in the L-NAME treatment group, though not in group V, in comparison with those in group I. cGMP in the aorta was increased in groups III, IV, and V as compared with that in group II. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA was decreased in the aortae of L-NAME-treated rabbits and increased in aortae in group V, in comparison with that in group I. Conclusively, nipradilol, beta-blocker with nitric oxide-releasing action, in contrast to the other beta-blockers and nitric oxide donors, showed a successful anti-atherosclerotic effect through the restoration of nitric oxide bioavailability and possible interaction with oxygen radicals.", 
    "96": "The proarrhythmic effects of four antiarrhythmic agents were examined during alpha1-adrenoceptor stimulation in chloralose-anesthetized rabbits. Each dose of almokalant (26, 88, and 260 microg/kg), D-sotalol, quinidine, or amiodarone (each 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) was infused i.v. over 5 min and there was a 20-min interval between each infusion. D-sotalol and almokalant evoked torsade de pointes (TdP) and other arrhythmics, frequently. The incidences of TdP were 0, 50, and 40% after administering the first, second, and third doses of the nonselective I(Kr) inhibitor D-sotalol, respectively. Similarly, these values were 20, 40, and 33% after administering the first, second, and third doses, respectively, of the selective I(Kr) inhibitor almokalant. Quinidine elicited only a few arrhythmics, but not TdP. Quinidine, D-sotalol, and almokalant evoked conduction blocks in a dose-related manner (p < 0.05) and prolonged QT and QT(c) intervals (p < 0.05). Amiodarone neither prolonged QT and QT(c) nor evoked ventricular tachyarrhythmias, blocks, or other proarrhythmias. In conclusion, these results show no direct correlation between the occurrence of TdP and the infusion rate or dose of anti-arrhythmics. Furthermore, the lack of TdP with quinidine warns of false-negative results in the applied model.", 
    "97": "The effects of SMP-300, an orally active, potent, and selective Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor, were evaluated and compared with those of nifedipine, propranolol, and nicorandil on three experimental angina models and on myocardial infarction in rats. SMP-300 (0.1-1 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced isoproterenol-induced ST segment depression in a dose-dependent manner. Its maximal effect was comparable to that reported for propranolol and greater than that of nifedipine. SMP-300 (0.3-1 mg/kg) reduced vasopressin-induced ST segment depression in a dose-dependent manner, and its maximal effect was comparable to those of nifedipine and nicorandil. SMP-300 (0.3-1 mg/kg, p.o.) and propranolol (100 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited coronary artery occlusion-induced T-wave elevation, but nifedipine (3 mg/kg, p.o.) did not. SMP-300 (1 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced myocardial infarct size after 40 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion, but nifedipine (3 mg/kg, p.o.) or propranolol (100 mg/kg, p.o.) did not. This study provides support for the future use of a Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor as an anti-anginal drug with a novel mode of action.", 
    "98": "The effects of propranolol and atenolol were investigated on arterial hypertension, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and ventricular ischaemic lesions induced by an 8-week treatment with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 20 mg/rat per day) in Wistar rats. Propranolol and atenolol (30 mg/rat per day each) were given in the drinking water concomitantly to L-NAME. Treatment with L-NAME induced marked arterial hypertension and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, both of which were significantly reduced by propranolol and atenolol. A marked repairing fibrosis was also observed in L-NAME-treated rats and this was significantly attenuated in animals receiving the beta-blockers. In L-NAME group, 33% mortality was observed, whereas all the animals from the other groups survived. Our study demonstrates that propranolol and atenolol reduce arterial hypertension, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis induced by L-NAME, suggesting that beta-blockers are of beneficial value in treatment of vascular and cardiac alterations caused by chronic nitric oxide deficiency.", 
    "99": "The signaling impact of a human beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1 AR) polymorphism at residue 49 of the aminoterminus (Ser-to-Gly substitution) was studied by recombinantly expressing each receptor. The two receptors displayed identical agonist and antagonist binding affinities. Furthermore, basal and agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were the same for these receptors as assessed in both cell types. Although short-term agonist exposure resulted in similar degrees of receptor internalization, long-term agonist-promoted downregulation was greater for Gly49 compared with Ser49. The Gly49 receptor underwent a 24 +/- 3% loss of receptor density after exposure to isoproterenol for 18 h, whereas Ser49 underwent no such loss. In studies in which receptor synthesis was inhibited, agonist-promoted downregulation for Gly49 was 55 +/- 3% compared with 36 +/- 5% for Ser49. In the absence of agonist, degradative turnover of each receptor was the same. Immunoblotting revealed that some of the Ser49 receptor exists as a highly N-glycosylated form (approximately 105-kD molecular mass), which is not present with Gly49. Thus the phenotype of the Gly49 polymorphic receptor is that of wild-type coupling with enhanced agonist-promoted downregulation, which is associated with altered N-glycosylation. Based on this cellular phenotype, the beta1 AR Gly49 polymorphism may impart a beneficial effect in chronic heart failure.", 
    "100": "ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) represent effective drugs more and more widely used in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, in post AMI patients and mainly, today, in CHF patients.A complete review of the scientific literature and of all the randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), where ACE-I have been tested directly or in association with other drugs, have been performed. ACE-I effects on total mortality (TM) and arrhythmic mortality (AM) and other composite clinical endpoints have been evaluated. It is well known that frequent ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and a high incidence of sudden death (SD) can be documented in CHF patients; nevertheless a direct relationship between VA, TM, and AM has not been clearly demonstrated; neither beneficial effects, on the same endpoints, of the treatment and suppression of ambient VA in CHF. Conversely, sometimes clear negative effects on both TM and AM have been observed. According to individual studies and two recent complete and large metanalysis, ACE-I were unable to reduce AM, but they reduced TM. Furthermore, they can affect and modify many, if not all, of the triggering factors of VA and SD in this context. Differently from ACE-I, betablockers (BB) have been clearly associated with a reduction in TM and AM, in the same context. Thus, at present time, ACE-I, with or without BB, should be considered the standard therapy in all patients with CHF, if not contraindicated. Angiotensin II antagonists (AII-a) probably represent a comparably effective treatment, in all CHF patients and mainly in those patients, suffering from side effects or showing intolerance to ACE-I, but we are still lacking definitive data from RCTs. In many RCTs, conducted with traditional antiarrhythmic drug therapy (ADT), these drugs have been widely used, contributing probably, in a consistent way, to some of the positive results of these studies. All primary and some secondary implantable defibrillators (ICD) RCTs, in the prevention of SD, have included these drugs as the standard treatment of the underlying cardiac disease, with or without CHF. The same therapeutical strategy is regularly applied in all biventricular pacing (BP) RCTs, with or without the ICD. These trials are supposed to assess the reduction in TM and AM, preventing deterioration or progression of CHF and improving the quality of the patients' s life.Finally, according to these clinical evidences, in the last part of the review, we stress the need for a more widespread implementation of ACE-I and AII-a in treating CHF patients.", 
    "101": "The management of chronic heart failure in elderly patients is often complicated by the presence of multiple comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, psychosocial and financial concerns, and difficulties with adherence to complex medication and dietary regimens. In addition, few patients over 80 years of age have been enrolled in clinical trials, so that the efficacy of current heart failure therapies remains uncertain in this age group. Taken together, these factors contribute to the persistently high hospitalization and mortality rates as well as the poor quality of life associated with chronic heart failure in the elderly. In this article, nonpharmacologic aspects of care and the pharmacotherapy of systolic heart failure in elderly patients are reviewed. Optimal management requires a systematic approach comprising 5 key elements: coordination of care across disciplines, patient and caregiver education, enhancement of self-management skills, effective followup, and the judicious use of medications. However, it must be recognized that even with \"best practice\" interventions, the prognosis for established heart failure remains poor. Future research must therefore be directed at developing more effective strategies for the prevention of heart failure in our aging population.", 
    "102": "A new K(+)-channel blocking peptide identified from the scorpion venom of Tityus cambridgei (Tc1) is composed of 23 amino acid residues linked with three disulfide bridges. Tc1 is the shortest known toxin from scorpion venom that recognizes the Shaker B K(+) channels and the voltage-dependent K(+) channels in the brain. Synthetic Tc1 was produced using solid-phase synthesis, and its activity was found to be the same as that of native Tc1. The pairings of three disulfide bridges in the synthetic Tc1 were identified by NMR experiments. The NMR solution structures of Tc1 were determined by simulated annealing and energy-minimization calculations using the X-PLOR program. The results showed that Tc1 contains an alpha-helix and a 3(10)-helix at N-terminal Gly(4)-Lys(10) and a double-stranded beta-sheet at Gly(13)-Ile(16) and Arg(19)-Tyr(23), with a type I' beta-turn at Asn(17)-Gly(18). Superposition of each structure with the best structure yielded an average root mean square deviation of 0.26 +/- 0.05 A for the backbone atoms and of 1.40 +/- 0.23 A for heavy atoms in residues 2 to 23. The three-dimensional structure of Tc1 was compared with two structurally and functionally related scorpion toxins, charybdotoxin (ChTx) and noxiustoxin (NTx). We concluded that the C-terminal structure is the most important region for the blocking activity of voltage-gated (Kv-type) channels for scorpion K(+)-channel blockers. We also found that some of the residues in the larger scorpion K(+)-channel blockers (31 to 40 amino acids) are not involved in K(+)-channel blocking activity.", 
    "103": "Microcapsules were prepared by interfacial cross-linking of beta-cyclodextrins (beta-CD) with terephthaloylchloride (TC) as described previously. Complexation assays were conducted with propranolol HCl. After 1 h incubation of 50 mg lyophilized microcapsules in 10 ml propranolol solution, the amounts of fixed drug were 507.5+/-8.6 micromol and 811.2+/-16.0 micromol per g lyophilized microcapsules with 1 mM and 2 mM solutions, respectively. A dialysis experiment was then performed. After 1 h incubation of microcapsules (10 or 50 mg) in 10 ml of 2 mM propranolol solution, the suspension was dialysed against a phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 37 degrees C. The drug diffusion was all the more retarded that the amount of added beta-CD microcapsules was higher. Finally, double microcapsules were prepared using a suspension of beta-CD microcapsules (10-100 mg) in a solution of methylene blue in an acetate buffer pH 7.4. After adding human serum albumin (HSA), the suspension was emulsified in cyclohexane and double microcapsules were obtained by cross-linking the HSA with TC. In vitro release studies showed that the incorporation of beta-CD microcapsules resulted in a decrease in release rate of methylene blue, the decrease being related to the amount of encapsulated beta-CD microcapsules. The study then suggests interesting applications of beta-CD microcapsules for modulating the release rate of drugs through semi-permeable membranes.", 
    "104": "This study was conducted to investigate whether there are differences in the autonomic nervous system function of chickens from lines selected for high (HWS) or low body weight (LWS). The cardiovascular response to various pharmacological agents was used as an indicator of autonomic nervous system response. Ten individuals from each line and sex were used in the study. Catheters were introduced into the left brachial artery and vein and connected to a MP100-BIOPAC system to record blood pressure and heart rate (HR). Chickens were injected with phenylephrine, atropine, propranolol, and tetraethylammonium chloride (TEAC). The LWS birds exhibited a greater increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and a lesser increase in HR than the HWS birds following atropine. The response to atropine showed a line and sex interaction in which male birds had a greater increase in HR than females and LWS females had a lower increase in HR than the HWS females. Injection of phenylephrine following pretreatment with atropine caused a baroreceptor reflex in which males showed a greater decrease in HR than females. In response to the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol, females displayed a greater decrease in MABP than males and LWS birds had a greater decrease in HR than HWS birds. In response to the autonomic ganglionic blocker TEAC, MABP and HR decreased equally in both lines. The percentage of adrenal and sympathetic impact on regulation of HR showed that LWS females required greater adrenal activity than those from the other subclasses. Although changes in HR and MABP ratios in response to phenylephrine were different between lines, these responses were not different when phenylephrine was given following atropine. This pattern of response suggested that HWS birds had greater parasympathetic nervous system activity in order to maintain cardiovascular function. These results demonstrate that selection for HWS or LWS has resulted in greater parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system tone in birds from the HWS and LWS birds, respectively, and suggest that differences between the lines could be at the level of the chromaffin tissue in the adrenal gland.", 
    "105": "Pheochromocytomas cause the most dramatic, life-threatening crises in all of endocrinology. Pheochromocytoma is an explosive clinical syndrome characterized by severe hypertension associated with cardiac complications, hypotension, or even shock and sudden death. The key to diagnosing pheochromocytoma is to suspect it, then confirm it. The cases reported in this review illustrate how the diagnosis can be easily missed and definitive treatment delayed. An appreciation of the wide range of clinical manifestations, based on clear understanding of the mechanisms of catecholamine action and the pathophysiology of pheochromocytoma, and the availability of simple and accurate diagnostic tests should lead to earlier detection of these tumors. Advances in localization techniques and availability of various treatment modalities have made successful management more promising than ever before.", 
    "106": "The recently published American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction stress 3 major points: (1) the prehospital phase from the onset of symptoms to definitive therapy in the emergency department must be shortened by 50% in order to reduce further the estimated 30% mortality rate for all patients in the community who suffer an acute myocardial infarction; (2) a more widespread use of thrombolytic agents is warranted because of the demonstrated, extremely time-dependent benefit to survivorship: the sooner it is given, the better the outcome; and (3) the administration of aspirin (160-325 mg) daily for an indefinite period is perhaps the most important therapy for a patient with acute myocardial infarction. Long-term therapy with lipid-lowering Statin drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor agents are gaining increasing evidence-based data to support their perpetual use as well.",

After a 21-day wash-out period patients were randomized to 14 days treatment with latanoprost or with timolol, in a cross-over fashion. The following parameters were evaluated on days 0 and 14: number of white blood cells, ferning test, conjunctival impression cytology, subjective symptoms, and objective ocular changes.", 
    "109": "Latanoprost caused: (a) an increase in eosinophils in both groups and reduction in lymphocytes only in the group with a history of AC; (b) alterations in ferning test and impression cytology only in AC patients; and (c) development of subjective symptoms and objective signs only in non-AC glaucomatous subjects. Timolol therapy was responsible only for the occurrence of subjective symptoms and objective signs in non-AC patients.", 
    "110": "Latanoprost treatment induces ocular surface changes which are more evident in POAG patients who are also affected by AC. These findings are probably related to the very high latanoprost concentration of benzalkonium chloride and to its bedtime administration, which further amplifies the toxicity.",

There was no significant difference in refusal of angiography or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty between black patients and white patients, or in crude rates of either of these procedures. There was also no difference overall in the percentage of patients who refused coronary artery bypass graft surgery. However, black patients were less likely than white patients to undergo bypass surgery (6.9% vs. 12.5% by 90 days; P <0.001). Black patients remained less likely to undergo bypass surgery even when high-risk specific coronary anatomy subgroups were examined. There was no difference in mortality in the two groups.", 
    "121": "In this integrated health care system, no significant racial disparities in use of noninterventional therapies, diagnostic coronary angiography, or short- or long-term mortality was found. Disparities in use of thrombolytic therapy and coronary artery bypass surgery existed, however, even after accounting for differences in clinical indications for treatment and patient refusals. Further work should assess the role of the medical interaction and physician behavior in racial disparities in use of health care.", 
    "122": "To investigate the effects of repeated atropine injection on heart rate (HR) variability in resting Thoroughbred horses, two microg/ kg of atropine as parasympathetic nervous blockade was injected intravenously every 6 min to a total of 8 microg/kg after intravenous administration of 0.2 mg/kg of propranolol as sympathetic nervous blockade. We recorded electrocardiograms and obtained the HR, then evaluated variation in HR from the power spectrum in terms of low frequency (LF, 0.01-0.07 Hz) power and high frequency (HF, 0.07-0.6 Hz) power. Administration of atropine decreased parasympathetic nervous activity in a dose-dependent manner, affecting first the LF power, then the HF power and finally HR. These responses may provide valuable information for evaluating autonomic nervous activity in Thoroughbred horses.", 
    "123": "An acute open angle glaucoma of the right eye was diagnosed in an 8-year-old male Yorkshire terrier which was presented with anorexia, depression, and trembling. Abnormal findings of the right eye on admission included elevated intraocular pressure (IOP; 40 mmHg), the presence of fibrin and flare in the anterior chamber, and immature cataract. Morphological abnormalities of the iridocorneal angle were not detected, and an open angle was seen in the eye. Although an elevated IOP was observed at one year after admission, lowering IOP (< or = 24 mmHg) was maintained with medical therapy using dichlorphenamide (DCPA) and timolol maleate, DCPA alone, or no-treatment for 1973 days. This case suggests that lower IOP can be maintained with medical therapy alone for a long period in a patient with open angle glaucoma.", 
    "124": "Nebivolol (Nobiten, Menarini) is a new beta-blocker recommended for the management of essential hypertension, at a dose of 5 mg once daily. It is administered as a racemic mixture of equal proportions of d- and l-enantiomers. As a lipophilic agent, it is metabolised in the liver and transformed in several active metabolites, essentially via the CYP 2D6, an isoform of cytochrome P450 characterized by a genetic polymorphism. Nebivolol is highly specific for beta-1 adrenergic receptors; it is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilising activity. Interestingly enough, it appears to have nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatory effects which might explain its favourable haemodynamic profile. Several comparative trials demonstrated an antihypertensive activity that was similar or slightly superior to that observed with various other reference antihypertensive agents. Nebivolol has an additive antihypertensive effect in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. All studies reported that the drug has a good clinical and biological tolerance profile. Therefore, nebivolol may be recommended as an alternative first-line treatment option for the management of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.",

(2) Effect of echocardiogram: ultrasound cardiogram showed that the left ventricular diastolic diameter in Group C was less significantly than that in Group A and B (P < 0.05). (3) The eject fraction in Group C was higher than that in the other two groups (P < 0.05). (4) The 24 hours dynamic electrocardiogram demonstrated a significant lowering occurrence of ventricular premature contraction in Group C in comparing with that in Group A and B (P < 0.05).",

    "129": "Left ventricular (LV) relaxation is crucial for LV function, especially during exercise. We compared the effects of increasing doses of ivabradine, a selective inward hyperpolarization-activated current inhibitor, and atenolol on the rate and extent of LV relaxation (best fit method: time constant tau(BF), pressure asymptote P(BF)) at rest and during exercise. Eight dogs were chronically instrumented to measure LV pressure and LV wall stresses. During exercise under saline, heart rate increased from 108 +/- 5 to 220 +/- 6 beats/min and tau(BF) was significantly reduced from 22 +/- 1 to 14 +/- 2 ms. At rest, atenolol but not ivabradine increased tau(BF). For similar heart rate reductions during exercise, atenolol impeded the shortening of tau(BF) (23 +/- 2 ms) whereas ivabradine had no effect (15 +/- 2 ms). The extent of the relaxation process (P(BF)) at peak exercise was increased by ivabradine, and to a greater extent by atenolol, compared with saline. Thus, for a similar reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, ivabradine, in contrast with atenolol, does not exert any negative lusitropic effect.", 
    "130": "We hypothesized that nitric oxide (NO), in addition to beta-adrenergic effects, may contribute to exercise-induced coronary responses after alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade. Data were analyzed as relationships between coronary sinus (CS) O(2) saturation (CS O(2)sat) or coronary blood flow (CBF) and myocardial O(2) consumption (MVO(2)). As MVO(2) increased, CS O(2)sat fell more (P < 0.05) after N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; slope = -2.9 +/- 0.4 x 10(-2) %saturation. microl O(2) x min(-1) x g(-1)) than before (slope = -2.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(-2) %saturation. microl O(2). min(-1) x g(-1)). The slope of CBF versus MVO(2) was not altered. After blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors alone (phentolamine), CS O(2)sat failed to decrease as MVO(2) increased (slope = -0.1 +/- 0.5 x 10(-2) %saturation. microl O(2) x min(-1) x g(-1)) x L-NAME given after phentolamine led to substantial decreases in CS O(2)sat (P < 0.01) as MVO(2) increased (slope = -2.1 +/- 0.4 x 10(-2) percent saturation. microl O(2)(-1) x min(-1) x g(-1)). CBF responses to exercise were smaller (P < 0.01) after phentolamine + L-NAME (slope = 6.1 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) ml/microl O(2)) than after phentolamine alone (slope = 6.9 +/- 0.2 x 10(-3) ml/microl O(2)). Thus a significant portion of exercise-induced coronary responses after alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade involves NO formation.", 
    "131": "Acetylcholine released on parasympathetic stimulation slows heart rate through activation of muscarinic receptors on the sinus nodal cells and subsequent opening of the atrial muscarinic potassium channel (K(ACh)). K(ACh) is directly activated by G protein betagamma-subunits. To elucidate the physiological role of Gbetagamma for the regulation of heart rate and electrophysiological function in vivo, we created transgenic mice with a reduced amount of membrane-bound Gbeta protein by overexpressing nonprenylated Ggamma(2)-subunits in their hearts using the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. At baseline and after muscarinic stimulation with carbachol, heart rate and heart rate variability were determined with electrocardiogram telemetry in conscious mice and in vivo intracardiac electrophysiological studies in anesthetized mice. Reduction of the amount of functional Gbetagamma protein by >50% caused a pronounced blunting of the carbachol-induced bradycardia as well as the increases in time- and frequency-domain indexes of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity that were observed in wild types. In addition, sinus node recovery time and inducibility of atrial arrhythmias were reduced in transgenic mice. Our data demonstrate in vivo that Gbetagamma plays a crucial role for parasympathetic heart rate control, sinus node automaticity, and atrial arrhythmia vulnerability.", 
    "132": "The regulation of triglyceride mobilization by catecholamines was investigated in the teleost fish Oreochromis mossambicus (tilapia) in vivo and in vitro. In vitro experiments were carried out with adipocytes that were isolated for the first time from fish adipose tissue. For the in vivo experiments, cannulated tilapia were exposed to stepwise decreasing oxygen levels (20, 10, and 5% air saturation; 3.9, 1.9, and 1.0 kPa PO(2), respectively), each level being maintained for 2 h. Blood samples were taken at timed intervals and analyzed for plasma lactate, glucose, free fatty acids, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol. Hypoxia exposure did not change plasma epinephrine levels. In contrast, the plasma norepinephrine concentration markedly increased at all hypoxia levels. Over the same period, plasma free fatty acid levels showed a significant continuous decrease, suggesting that norepinephrine is responsible for the reduced plasma free fatty acid concentration, presumably through inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue. To elucidate the mechanism, adipocytes were isolated from mesenteric adipose tissue of tilapia and incubated with 1) norepinephrine, 2) norepinephrine + phentolamine (alpha(1),alpha(2)-antagonist), 3) isoproterenol (nonselective beta-agonist), 4) isoproterenol + timolol (beta(1),beta(2)-antagonist), 5) norepinephrine + timolol, and 6) BRL-35135A (beta(3)-agonist). The results demonstrate for the first time that norepinephrine and isoproterenol suppress lipolysis in isolated adipocytes of tilapia. The effect of norepinephrine is not mediated through alpha(2)-adrenoceptors but, like isoproterenol, via beta-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, this study provides strong indications that beta(3)-adrenoceptors are involved.", 
    "133": "OBJECTIVES; We present a meta-analysis based on three recent, substantial, randomized outcome trials and several smaller trials that compared calcium channel blockers (CCBs) with conventional therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers) or with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.", 
    "134": "There is continuing uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of CCBs in the treatment of hypertension. Previous meta-analyses conflict and suggest that CCBs increase myocardial infarction (MI) or protect from stroke.", 
    "135": "Standard procedures for meta-analysis were used to analyze three major trials on 21,611 patients and another three lesser studies to a total of 24,322 patients.", 
    "136": "Calcium channel blockers have a strikingly similar risk of total and cardiovascular mortality and of major cardiovascular events to conventional therapy. Calcium channel blockers give a lower risk of nonfatal stroke (-25%, p = 0.001) and a higher risk of total MI (18%, p = 0.013), chiefly nonfatal (18%). After performing the Bonferroni correction for multiplicity, these p values become 0.004 and 0.052, respectively. When compared with ACE inhibitors in 1,318 diabetic patients, CCBs had a substantially higher risk of nonfatal (relative risk [RR] = 2.259) and total MI (RR = 2.204, confidence interval 1.501 to 3.238; p = 0.001 or 0.004 with Bonferroni correction). Total and cardiovascular mortality rates are similar. To confirm the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors are superior to CCBs in diabetic patients requires more trial data, especially with renal end points.", 
    "137": "Mortality (total and cardiovascular) and major cardiovascular events with CCBs were apparently similar to those events seen with conventional first-line therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers). Stroke reduction more than balanced increased MI. In diabetics, CCBs may be less safe than ACE inhibitors.", 
    "138": "Resting measurement of only left ventricular systolic function, is not enough sufficient parameter that predicts exercise capacity in patients with cardiac disease. Therefore, left ventricular filling shortly after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was prospectively studied to determine whether it could predict subsequent exercise time. Consecutive AMI patients underwent Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography within 48 hours of infarction. The study group consisted of 63 participants: 33 patients with an uncomplicated AMI who had undergone symptom-limited stress testing during recovery and 30 healthy subjects. Systolic function was evaluated by wall motion score index (WMSI), and diastolic one was assessed by the peak transmitral Doppler velocity in early diastole (E) and atrial systole (A), then by their ratio (E/A), normalized E/A ratio, and by diastolic filling period (DFP). Myocardial infarction (MI) size was measured electrocardiographically, using Selvester's QRS scoring system (QRSSI) and then expressed in percentages. Healthy participants and patients were compared, through common parameters. The patients receiving BB treatment at the time of exercise testing, had a lower resting pulse, and achieved a lower maximal pulse, yet their exercise time was similar incomparison to that of the group not receiving BB therapy. Our results have shown a strong positive correlation between exercise time and WMSI (r = 0.77, p < 0.001) DFP (r = 0.56, p < 0.001), respectively weak negative correlation with QRSSI (r = -0.17, p < 0.001) and better negative correlation with normalized E/A ratio (r = -0.56, p < 0.001). This correlation was not influenced by beta-blokers (BB) at the time of stress testing. Normalized E/A ratio and DFP are the only diastolic function parameters, which predict exercise capacity during recovery, measured soon after an uncomplicated AMI.", 
    "139": "Mutation scanning of the beta1-adrenoceptor gene has identified a polymorphism, G389R, that markedly affects G-protein coupling of the receptor and resulting cAMP production. We have investigated the effect of this functionally active polymorphism on clinical response to beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Two cohorts of untreated hypertensive patients randomly assigned to a beta1-selective beta-blocker at the start of antihypertensive therapy were studied retrospectively to see if the G389R polymorphism influenced the response in terms of blood pressure and heart rate. The blood pressure and heart rate responses to treatment were assessed 4 weeks later and compared with the G389R genotype, ascertained by PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphism. The falls in blood pressure and heart rate for the first group (n = 92) by genotype were: GG, 20.1 +/- 3.5/13.9 +/- 2.7 mmHg (systolic/diastolic blood pressure), 18.4 +/- 2.2 beats/min; GR, 20.0 +/- 2.2/15.0 +/- 1.3 mmHg, 16.5 +/- 1.5 beats/min; RR, 20.8 +/- 2.3/13.4 +/- 1.1 mmHg, 16.0 +/- 1.4 beats/min. For the second group (n = 55) the corresponding falls were: GG, 17.0 +/- 4.3/11.2 +/- 3.4 mmHg, 12.0 +/- 3.5 beats/min; GR, 16.6 +/- 1.8/14.4 +/- 1.1 mmHg, 13.1 +/- 2.1 beats/min; RR, 18.0 +/- 1.6/13.0 +/- 1.4 mmHg, 14.4 +/- 1.4 beats/min. The G389R genotype also failed to have a significant effect on pretreatment blood pressure or heart rate in either group. These data suggest that, despite clear functional differences between the G389R receptor variants expressed in vitro, the polymorphism does not affect the haemodynamic response of hypertensive subjects to chronic beta1-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "140": "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality among diabetic women. However, studies devoted to cardiovascular disease in women, and particularly diabetic women, are scarce. Diabetes erases the natural protection of premenopausal women against cardiovascular disease. Risk of death from coronary artery disease is higher in diabetic women than in diabetic men. Diabetic women might be more exposed to some risk factors. Non invasive diagnostic tools of coronary artery disease are less accurate in women, and women are less likely than men to undergo catheterization or revascularization. The lower diameter of coronary artery might contribute to these reluctances. Nevertheless, long-term outcome of the revascularization procedures (thrombolysis, bypass graft, angioplasty) are similar in men and women, although peri-procedural risks might be higher in women. Finally, secondary prevention treatments, particularly beta-blockers, are underused in women. Gender differences in cardiovascular risk among diabetics are partly explained by discrepancies in terms of coronary artery anatomy or lack of reliable non invasive tests. But the longer delay to treatment and the lack of scientific information about the particular features of coronary heart disease in women probably contribute to the increased risk in diabetic women.", 
    "141": "1. beta-adrenoceptors mediate relaxation of bladder detrusor smooth muscle. This study investigates the contribution of beta(3)-adrenoceptors to relaxation of the pig urinary bladder. 2. Cell membranes were prepared from detrusor muscle of the pig bladder dome and competition experiments with [(3)H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA), a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist was used as a specific radioligand to determine the presence of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. In functional experiments, isolated detrusor muscle strips were used to determine the potency of agonists and the affinity of antagonists. 3. In competition binding experiments, CGP20712A (beta(1)-adrenoceptor selective) displaced [(3)H]-DHA from a single binding site with a low affinity. In contrast, displacement data for ICI 118551 (beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) and SR59230A (beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist) best fitted a two-site model suggesting a predominant (70%) population of beta(3)-adrenoceptors. 4. In functional studies, isoprenaline and salbutamol (beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist) relaxed KCl precontracted muscle strips with high potency (pEC(50) 7.7 and 7.2, respectively), whilst CGP12177 and BRL37344 (beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists) had low potency and were partial agonists. CGP20712A and atenolol (beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists) antagonised responses with a low affinity. ICI118551 antagonized responses to isoprenaline and salbutamol with a high affinity (pK(B)=7.8 and 8.7, respectively), but the Schild slopes were low suggesting that responses were mediated by more than one beta-adrenoceptor. The Schild plot for SR59230A was biphasic, apparent pK(B) values for 3 - 10 nM SR59230A being 8.6 and those for 30 nM - 1 microM being 7.7. 5. These data suggest that beta(3)-adrenoceptors are the predominant beta-adrenoceptor subtype present in the pig bladder and that beta-adrenoceptor mediated responses of this tissue are mediated via both the beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor subtypes."
