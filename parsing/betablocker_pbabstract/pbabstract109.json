The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Tongxinluo, a traditional Chinese medicine, on no-reflow and the infarction area after emergency PCI for STEMI.", 
    "1": "A total of 219 patients (female 31, 14%) undergoing emergency PCI for STEMI from nine clinical centers were consecutively enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial from January 2007 to May 2009. All patients were randomly divided into Tongxinluo group (n = 108) and control group (n = 111), given Tongxinluo or placebo in loading dose 2.08 g respectively before emergency PCI with aspirin 300 mg and clopidogrel 300 mg together, then 1.04 g three times daily for six months after PCI. The ST segment elevation was recorded by electrocardiogram at hospitalization and 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 hours after coronary balloon dilation to evaluate the myocardial no-flow; myocardial perfusion scores of 17 segments were evaluated on day 7 and day 180 after STEMI with static single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to determine the infarct area.",

Except for one with frequent ventricular premature beat before operation, the others had no previous history of ventricular arrhythmia. Of the 4 patients, 3 had dilated cardiomyopathy and 1 had ischemic cardiomyopathy, and tachycardia occurred within 3 days after operation. Sustained, refractory VT and subsequent VF occurred in one patient, frequent nonsustained VT in two patients and nonparoxysmal atrioventricular junctional tachycardia in one patient. VT was managed by amiodarone in two patients, amiodarone together with beta-blocker in one patient, and junctional tachycardia was terminated by overdrive pacing. During over 12-month follow-up, except for one patient's death due to refractory heart and respiratory failure in hospital, the others remain alive and arrhythmia-free.",

    "8": "Alkaloid containing plants represent a heterogeneous group both taxonomically and chemically, a basic nitrogen being the unifying factor for the various classes. As most alkaloids are extremely toxic, organisms containing them do not feature strongly in medicine but they have always been important in the allopathic system. Typical alkaloids are derived from plant sources, they are basic, they contain one or more nitrogen, and they usually have marked physiological actions in humans or other mammalian species. This review will present various alkaloids generated by cyanobacteria, highlighting their complex structures, powerful bioactivities, and pharmacological properties. The main groups of cyanobacterial alkaloids include the neuromuscular transmission blocker anatoxins, the ion channel blocker saxitoxins, the degenerated amino acid \u03b2-methylamino-L-alanine, the protein synthesis inhibitor guanidine alkaloid cylindrospermopsins, and cyanobacterial indol alkaloids with antiviral, antifungal, and cytotoxic activity.", 
    "9": "Heart failure is frequently associated with comorbidities, either because of the etiology of heart failure, either because the prevalence of this disease is high in older age groups, who are affected by various pathologies. Hypertension, diabetes and renal failure are the most frequent comorbidities. They worsen the prognosis of heart failure, so their management should be precise. In all these situations, besides the specific treatment of the disease, the use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system is imperative, due to their proven efficacy in heart failure but also because they have beneficial effects on these co-morbidities. However, their use must be strictly monitored, clinically and biologically. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, beta-blockers can be tried and their dose adjusted according to clinical tolerance; they are contraindicated in patients with asthma. Finally, and especially in older patients, the risk of drugs interactions is harmful and should be constantly looking for.", 
    "10": "Medical management of systolic heart failure is standardized and based on international guidelines. They promote the use of combination therapy based on neurohormonal blockade targeting both the renin-angiotensin system (with ACE inhibitors or ARB) and sympathetic nervous system (i.e., beta blockers). Drugs have to be titrated at the maximum tolerated level. In symptomatic patients, loop diuretics remain the treatment of choice with dosage adaptation according to symptoms and fluid management. Aldosterone antagonists are indicated in patients with severe heart failure (i.e., NYHA class 3 or 4) and creatinine clearance above 30 ml/min. Their combination with RAS blockers warrants strict biological follow up.",

    "17": "Negative inotropic agents are often administered to decrease the left ventricular (LV) pressure gradient in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). Little information is available regarding comparisons of the effects on LV pressure gradient among negative inotropic agents. The present study compared the decrease in the LV pressure gradient at rest in patients with obstructive HC after treatment with pilsicainide versus treatment with disopyramide or cibenzoline. The LV pressure gradient and LV function were assessed before and after the intravenous administration of each drug. In 12 patients (group A, mean pressure gradient 90 \u00b1 24 mm Hg), the effects of disopyramide, propranolol, and verapamil were compared. In another 12 patients (group B, mean pressure gradient 98 \u00b1 34 mm Hg), a comparison was performed among disopyramide, cibenzoline, and pilsicainide. In group A, the percentage of reduction in the LV pressure gradient was 7.7 \u00b1 9.9% with verapamil, 19.0 \u00b1 20.2% with propranolol, and 58.6 \u00b1 15.0% with disopyramide, suggesting that disopyramide was more effective than either verapamil or propranolol. In group B, the percentage of reduction in the LV pressure gradient was 55.3 \u00b1 26.6% with disopyramide, 55.3 \u00b1 20.6% with cibenzoline, and 54.7 \u00b1 15.4% with pilsicainide, suggesting an equivalent effect on the LV pressure gradient for these 3 agents. In conclusion, these results indicate that the acute efficacy for the reduction of the LV pressure gradient at rest by pilsicainide (a pure sodium channel blocker) was equivalent to that of disopyramide or cibenzoline (combined sodium and calcium channel blockers). Accordingly, sodium channel blockade might be more important for reducing the LV pressure gradient at rest in patients with obstructive HC than calcium channel blockade or \u03b2 blockade.", 
    "18": "Beta-blocker therapy is recommended after ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) in current guidelines, although its efficacy in those patients who have undergone primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been adequately evaluated. Of 12,824 consecutive patients who underwent sirolimus-eluting stent implantation in the J-Cypher registry, we identified 910 patients who underwent PCI within 24 hours from onset of STEMI. Three-year outcomes were evaluated according to use of \u03b2 blockers at hospital discharge (349 patients in \u03b2-blocker group and 561 patients in no-\u03b2-blocker group). Patients in the \u03b2-blocker group more frequently had hypertension, low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), a left anterior descending artery infarct, and statin use than those in the no-\u03b2-blocker group. No difference was observed between the \u03b2-blocker and no-\u03b2-blocker groups in mortality (6.6% vs 6.6%, p = 0.85; propensity score adjusted hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.90, p = 0.70) or in incidence of major adverse cardiac events (all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and heart failure hospitalization, 13.5% vs 12.1%, p = 0.91; hazard ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.66, p = 0.53).

    "19": "The revised practice guideline 'Atrial fibrillation' from the Dutch College of General Practitioners provides the general practitioner with guidelines for diagnosis and management of patients with atrial fibrillation. To find patients with atrial fibrillation, it is advised to check cardiac rhythm at every blood pressure measurement. In patients over 65 years old, acceptance of atrial fibrillation with control of ventricular rate is preferred to sinus rhythm normalisation. In therapy with beta-blockers, slow release metoprolol is the drug of choice. An important goal of treatment is the prevention of thrombo-embolic complications. The choice between anticoagulants such as aspirin and coumarin derivatives is based on the CHADS2 score and determined by age (above 75 years) and comorbidity including cardiac failure, diabetes, hypertension, and previous transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or cardiovascular accident (CVA). The adequacy of antithrombotic treatment should be reassessed yearly.",

The bimatoprost group had the highest levels of hyperemia before treatment when compared with the latanoprost as well as the travaprost group and had the greatest reduction in hyperemia after treatment (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Regarding IOP, all 3 groups had a significant reduction (P\u2009<\u20090.001), but the bimatoprost group had a lower pretreatment IOP when compared with the travaprost and latanoprost groups.",

Therefore, we evaluated the characteristics of MH and WCH in Korean patients receiving medical treatment for hypertension. We enrolled 1019 outpatients (56 \u00b1 10 y, 488 males) with diagnosed hypertension who had not changed oral anti-hypertensive medication for 6 months. Clinic blood pressure (CBP) was checked by a nurse and doctor twice per visit. Home BP (HBP) was checked every morning and evening for 1 week. In the MH patients, mean CBP was 130/80 mmHg, whereas HBP was 137/86 mmHg. In the WCH patients, mean CBP was 149/86 mmHg by physician and 143/85 mmHg by nurse and mean HBP was 124/75 mmHg. Age and gender did not differ between the groups. Waist and hip circumferences and the level of fasting glucose were higher in patients with MH than in patients with WCH (p = 0.008, 0.016, 0.009, respectively). Metabolic risk factors were more frequent in patients with WCH, MH, and uncontrolled hypertension than in patients with controlled hypertension. The incidence of metabolic risk factors, however, did not differ between patients with WCH and MH. Heart damage was more frequent in MH than in WCH (p = 0.03). The incidence of metabolic risk factors did not differ between patients with WCH and those with MH. Target organ damage was more closely related to MH than to WCH. Home BP measurement was a useful tool for discriminating WCH and MH in patients with hypertension.", 
    "28": "The effect of NO-metoprolol, that is, 3-nitrooxypivaloyl metoprolol-amide, a novel NO-releasing derivative of the \u03b21-blocking drug metoprolol was investigated in A.CA/SnJ mice infected with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and compared to metoprolol and placebo. Daily treatment of mice with the respective drug started immediately (experiment A) or 3 days after virus infection (experiment B) and was continued until day 13 post-infection (p.i.). Two doses of NO-metoprolol were administered. Body mass differences, viral load, and histopathological signs of myocarditis were compared between the several groups. As a result, NO-metoprolol diminished significantly the body weight loss, the viral load and the histopathology, whereas metoprolol treatment led solely to a significant attenuation of myocardial damage. In experiment A, low dose NO-metoprolol decreased significantly enteroviral copy numbers. Both doses of NO-metoprolol had a significant effect on reduction of myocardial infiltrates and fibrosis. The data suggest that delayed drug administration might more advantageous. Both doses of NO-metoprolol reduced significantly the scores of four tested parameters compared to placebo. Body weight loss, virus titers, plus-strand as well as minus-strand enteroviral RNA levels, infiltration and fibrosis scores were diminished significantly when NO-metoprolol was given 3 days p.i. In addition, a significant difference regarding the enteroviral copy numbers was observed between low dose NO-metoprolol- and metoprolol-treated mice. Treatment with metoprolol reduced insignificantly the viral load and body weight loss (experiment A and B) but led to a significant reduction of myocardial histopathology in experiment A. The results indicate that NO-metoprolol treatment has a greater therapeutic benefit than metoprolol.", 
    "29": "Continued gambling to recover losses--'loss chasing'--is a prominent feature of social and pathological gambling. However, little is known about the neuromodulators that influence this behavior. In three separate experiments, we investigated the role of serotonin activity, D(2)/D(3) receptor activity, and beta-adrenoceptor activity on the loss chasing of age and IQ-matched healthy adults randomized to treatment or an appropriate control/placebo. In Experiment 1, participants consumed amino-acid drinks that did or did not contain the serotonin precursor, tryptophan. In Experiment 2, participants received a single 176 \u03bcg dose of the D(2)/D(3) receptor agonist, pramipexole, or placebo. In Experiment 3, participants received a single 80 mg dose of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, or placebo. Following treatment, participants completed a computerized loss-chasing game. Mood and heart rate were measured at baseline and following treatment. Tryptophan depletion significantly reduced the number of decisions made to chase losses, and the number of consecutive decisions to chase, in the absence of marked changes in mood. By contrast, pramipexole significantly increased the value of losses chased and diminished the value of losses surrendered. Propranolol markedly reduced heart rate, but produced no significant changes in loss-chasing behavior. Loss chasing can be thought of as an aversively motivated escape behavior controlled, in part, by the marginal value of continued gambling relative to the value of already accumulated losses. Serotonin and dopamine appear to play dissociable roles in the tendency of individuals to gamble to recover, or to seek to 'escape' from, previous losses. Serotonergic activity seems to promote the availability of loss chasing as a behavioral option, whereas D(2)/D(3) receptor activity produces complex changes in the value of losses judged worth chasing. Sympathetic arousal, at least as mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, does not play a major role in laboratory-based loss-chasing choices.", 
    "30": "Myocardial bridging (MB) is a congenital anomaly characterized by systolic compression of the tunnelled arterial segment. MB may cause myocardial ischaemia due to abnormal coronary blood flow. We report a case of MB in which transthoracic Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate the long-term effect of beta-blocker therapy on abnormal coronary blood flow. In this case, beta-blocker therapy with bisoprolol (5.0 mg/day) for 1 month eliminated the patient's symptoms and normalized coronary blood flow through the tunnelled arterial segment.", 
    "31": "Blood pressure (BP) reduction to 140/90 mm Hg or lower using renin-angiotensin-system blockers reportedly provides the greatest left ventricular (LV) mass regression; \u03b2-blockers have less effect. This study examined whether combination antihypertensive therapy would provide greater benefit. With a double-blind, parallel-group design, the effects of 3 different combinations, carvedilol controlled-release (CR)/lisinopril, atenolol/lisinopril, and lisinopril, on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were assessed by MRI after 12 months. Patients were treated to achieve guideline-recommended BP (<140 mm Hg/<90 mm Hg; diabetes: <130 mm Hg/<80 mm Hg). Sample size was calculated to achieve 90% power to detect a 5 g/m(2) difference in mean change from baseline in LVMI between the carvedilol CR/lisinopril group and each of the other treatment groups. Of 287 patients randomized, more than 50% were titrated to maximum dosage; 73% reached targeted BP. At month 12 (last observation carried forward \u2265 month 9) for 195 evaluable subjects, mean BP was similar in all groups (carvedilol CR/lisinopril: 128.8/77.9; atenolol/lisinopril: 128.7/76.5; lisinopril: 126.3/80.3 mm Hg). Compared with baseline, mean LVMI decreased to a similar extent in all groups (carvedilol CR/lisinopril: -6.3; atenolol/lisinopril: -6.7; lisinopril: -7.9 g/m(2)). Achievement of targeted BP control is more important than treatment regimen in achieving LV mass reduction.", 
    "32": "The potential for xenobiotic compounds to bioconcentrate is typically expressed through the bioconcentration factor (BCF), which has gained increased regulatory significance over the past decade. Due to the expense of in vivo bioconcentration studies and the growing regulatory need to assess bioconcentration potential, BCF is often calculated via single-compartment models, using K(OW) as the primary input. Recent efforts to refine BCF models have focused on physiological factors, including the ability of the organism to eliminate the compound through metabolic transformation. This study looks at the ability of in vitro biotransformation assays using S9 fractions to provide an indication of metabolic potential. Given the importance of the fish gill and liver in metabolic transformation, the metabolic loss of ibuprofen, norethindrone and propranolol was measured using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) gill and liver S9 fractions. Metabolic transformation rates (k(M)) were calculated and integrated into a refined BCF model. A significant difference was noted between BCF solely based on K(OW) and BCF including k(M). These studies indicate that the inclusion of k(M) in BCF models can bring predicted bioconcentration estimates closer to in vivo values.",

Calcium channel blocker (CCB) was the most frequently prescribed drug (61.0%), followed by angiotensin II receptor blockers (56.4%), centrally acting anti-hypertensive agent (26.4%), beta blockers and alpha, beta-blockers (14.0%). The control rate of hypertension in those hemodialysis people was aggravated by the existence of coronary artery disease. The patients who need more kinds of antihypertensive agents have a poorer control rate of hypertension. The hypertension control rate elevated significantly with the adequate hemodialysis.",

No patient in either group developed significant side effects related to the study drugs, and none have been sensitized to alloantigens. All have stable renal function.", 
    "48": "These two novel immunosuppressive regimens are effective, well tolerated, and the first calcineurin inhibitor/steroid-sparing islet protocols resulting in long-term insulin independence. Although EFA is no longer available for clinical use, these early results demonstrate that a regimen using BELA may be an effective alternative to improve graft function and longevity while minimizing renal and \u03b2-cell toxicity.", 
    "49": "Patients who experience acute ischemic stroke may develop hyperglycemia, even in the absence of diabetes, but the exact mechanisms are still unclear. Adipose tissue secretes numerous proinflammatory cytokines and is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. This study aimed to determine the effects of acute stroke on adipose inflammatory cytokine expression. In addition, because sympathetic activity is activated after acute stroke and catecholamines can regulate the expression of several adipocytokines, this study also evaluated whether alterations in adipose proinflammatory cytokines following acute stroke, if any, were medicated by sympathetic system. Acute ischemic brain injury was induced by ligating the right middle cerebral artery and bilateral common carotid arteries in male adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Adipose tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA and protein levels were determined by RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunoassay, respectively. The stroke rats developed glucose intolerance on days 1 and 2 after cerebral ischemic injury. The fasting blood insulin levels and insulin resistance index measured by homeostasis model assessment were higher in the stroke rats compared with the sham group. Epididymal adipose TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 mRNA and protein levels were elevated one- to twofold, in association with increased macrophage infiltration into the adipose tissue. When the rats were treated with a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol, before induction of cerebral ischemic injury, the acute stroke-induced increase in TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 was blocked, and fasting blood insulin concentration and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance were decreased. These results suggest a potential role of adipose proinflammatory cytokines induced by the sympathetic nervous system in the pathogenesis of glucose metabolic disorder in rats with acute ischemic stroke.", 
    "50": "As one of the most common malignancies, colon cancer is initiated by abnormal activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Although the treatment options have increased for some patients, overall progress has been modest. Thus, there is a great need to develop new treatments. We have found that bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid tetrandrine (TET) exhibits anticancer activity. TET is used as a calcium channel blocker to treat hypertensive and arrhythmic conditions in Chinese medicine. Here, we investigate the molecular basis underlying TET's anticancer activity. We compare TET with six chemotherapy drugs in eight cancer lines and find that TET exhibits comparable anticancer activities with camptothecin, vincristine, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin, and better than that of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and carboplatin. TET IC\u2085\u2080 is \u22645 \u03bcM in most of the tested cancer lines. TET exhibits synergistic anticancer activity with 5-FU and reduces migration and invasion capabilities of HCT116 cells. Furthermore, TET induces apoptosis and inhibits xenograft tumor growth of colon cancer. TET treatment leads to a decrease in \u03b2-catenin protein level in xenograft tumors, which is confirmed by T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor and c-Myc reporter assays. It is noteworthy that HCT116 cells with allelic oncogenic \u03b2-catenin deleted are less sensitive to TET-mediated inhibition of proliferation, viability, and xenograft tumor growth. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that the anticancer effect of TET in colon cancer may be at least in part mediated by targeting \u03b2-catenin activity. Therefore, TET may be used alone or in combination as an effective anticancer agent.",

After screening for enrollment, to 40 patients (79 eyes with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension), new fixed combination travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% was prescribed once a day in the evening (PM). Patients were enrolled according to each investigator decision on indication for travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination once a day, without washout period after previous medication. Intraocular pressure was measured at 9 AM at all time control points: at baseline, after 1 month, after 3 months and after 6 month. After 1 month, screening for nonresponders (criteria: 20% intraocular pressure lowering) and subjects with major side effects was performed. At second control visit, after 3 months PM dosing, intraocular pressure was measured and patients were instructed to continue once a day the same medication, but in the morning (AM) for consequent 3 months. After 1 month, reduction in mean intraocular pressure value was 21.66%. At the visit after 3 month, the mean intraocular pressure was 15.67 +/- 2.17 mm Hg (reduction 21.14%). 3 month after dosing regimen changed to AM (6 month after beginning of travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% combination therapy), reduction in intraocular pressure value was 19.86%. The differences (mean +/- standard deviation) in intraocular pressure values after 1, 3 and 6 month were all highly statistically significant compared to baseline values. The tolerability was evaluated in five steps (Likert scale) ranging from unsatisfactory to excellent by both patient and investigator--taken at 3 and 6 month control visit. 95% of patients and 100% of investigators were satisfied with the possibility of choosing dosing regimen for travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination. Travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination proved sufficient intraocular pressure control dosed either PM or AM with no statistically significant difference between two dosing regimens.

    "69": "Ventricular arrhythmia in chronic heart failure (CHF) is considered to be associated with stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs). Three classes of \u03b2-ARs have been identified; importantly, distinct from \u03b21 and \u03b22 subtypes, \u03b23-AR could inhibit arrhythmia. Intracellular Ca2+ is considered as a predominant effecter of arrhythmia during heart failure. However, the exact role of \u03b23-AR in arrhythmia and Ca2+ regulation in CHF is not clear yet. Therefore, we studied the effect of BRL37344, a specific \u03b23-AR activator, on CHF-related ventricular arrhythmia and cellular Ca2+ transport. Rabbits with CHF induced by combined aortic insufficiency and aortic constriction were treated with BRL37344 in the presence or absence of \u03b21-AR and \u03b22-AR stimulation. We then evaluated the current produced by sodium calcium exchanger (INCX), an electrical marker of abnormal Ca2+ removal through ion transporter protein sodium calcium exchanger (NCX), Ca2+ transient, a sign of Ca2+ entering the cell, concentration of Ca2+ in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (SR Ca2+ load) and its abnormal release (SR Ca2+ leak). After treatment with BRL37344, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias induced by infusion of a \u03b21-AR or \u03b22-AR activator decreased significantly. Similarly, \u03b23-AR stimulation remarkably inhibited increase of INCX, Ca2+ transient, SR Ca2+ load and leak induced by activation of \u03b21-AR or \u03b22-AR. SR59230A, a specific \u03b23-AR blocker, abolished the inhibitory effects of BRL37344. These results suggest that \u03b23-AR activation could inhibit ventricular arrhythmia through regulating intracellular Ca2+. Thus, \u03b23-AR is a feasible therapeutic target that holds promise in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias in CHF.",

Microglia are activated by aggregated forms of amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2), usually demonstrated in vitro by stimulating microglia with micromolar concentrations of fibrillar A\u03b2, a major component of amyloid plaques in AD brains. Here we report that amyloid-\u03b2 oligomer (A\u03b2O), at 5-50 nm, induces a unique pattern of microglia activation that requires the activity of the scavenger receptor A and the Ca(2+)-activated potassium channel KCa3.1. A\u03b2O treatment induced an activated morphological and biochemical profile of microglia, including activation of p38 MAPK and nuclear factor \u03baB. Interestingly, although increasing nitric oxide (NO) production, A\u03b2O did not increase several proinflammatory mediators commonly induced by lipopolyliposaccharides or fibrillar A\u03b2, suggesting that A\u03b2O stimulates both common and divergent pathways of microglia activation. A\u03b2O at low nanomolar concentrations, although not neurotoxic, induced indirect, microglia-mediated damage to neurons in dissociated cultures and in organotypic hippocampal slices. The indirect neurotoxicity was prevented by (i) doxycycline, an inhibitor of microglia activation; (ii) TRAM-34, a selective KCa3.1 blocker; and (iii) two inhibitors of inducible NO synthase, indicating that KCa3.1 activity and excessive NO release are required for A\u03b2O-induced microglial neurotoxicity. Our results suggest that A\u03b2O, generally considered a neurotoxin, may more potently cause neuronal damage indirectly by activating microglia in AD.",

    "105": "Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for atherosclerosis-related mortality and morbidity. In this document, the Hypertension Committee of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology provides new guidelines for hypertension management. The key messages are as follows. (1) The life-time risk for hypertension is 90%. (2) Both the increase in the prevalence rate and the relative risk of hypertension for causing cardiovascular events are higher in Asians than in Caucasians. (3) The control rate has been improved significantly in Taiwan from 2.4% to 21% in men, and from 5% to 29% in women in recent years (1995-2002). (4) Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) = 130/80 mmHg are thresholds of treatment for high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, stroke, established coronary heart disease, and coronary heart disease equivalents (carotid artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm). (5) Ambulatory and home BP monitoring correlate more closely with end-organ damage and have a stronger relationship with cardiovascular events than office BP monitoring, but the feasibility of home monitoring makes it a more attractive alternative. (6) Patients with masked hypertension have higher cardiovascular risk than those with white-coat hypertension. (7) Lifestyle changes should be encouraged in all patients, and include the following six items: S-ABCDE (Salt restriction; Alcohol limitation; Body weight reduction; Cessation of smoking; Diet adaptation; Exercise adoption). (8) When pharmacological therapy is needed, physicians should consider \"PROCEED\" (Previous experience of patient; Risk factors; Organ damage; Contraindication or unfavorable conditions; Expert or doctor judgment; Expense or cost; Delivery and compliance) to decide the optimal treatment. (9) The main benefits of antihypertensive agents are derived from lowering of BP per se, and are generally independent of the drugs being used, except that certain associated cardiovascular conditions might favor certain classes of drugs. (10) There are five major classes of drugs: thiazide diuretics; \u03b2-blockers; calcium channel blockers; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs); and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Any one of these can be used as the initial treatment, except for \u03b2-blockers, which are only indicated in patients with heart failure, a history of coronary heart disease, and hyperadrenergic state. (11) A standard dose of any one of the five major classes of antihypertensive drugs can produce an \u223c10-mmHg decrease in systolic BP (rule of 10) and a 5-mmHg decrease in diastolic BP (rule of 5), after placebo subtraction. (11) Combination therapy is frequently needed for optimal control of BP, and the amount of the decrease in BP by a two-drug combination is approximately the same as the sum of the decrease by each individual drug (\u223c20 mmHg in systolic BP and 10 mmHg in diastolic BP) if their mechanisms of action are independent, with the exception of the combination of ACEIs and ARBs. (13) An ACEI or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or a diuretic (A + C or A + D) are reasonable two-drug combinations, and A+C + D is a reasonable three-drug combination, unless patients have special indications for \u03b2-blockers. (14) Single-pill (fixed-dose) combinations that contain more than one drug in a single tablet are highly recommended because they reduce pill burden and cost, and improve compliance. (15) Very elderly patients (> 80 years) should be treated without delay, but BP should be reduced gradually and more cautiously. Finally, these guidelines are not mandatory; the responsible physician's decision remains most important in hypertension management.", 
    "106": "Glutamate in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a significant role in several mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, addiction and anxiety. Previous studies on PFC glutamate-mediated function have used techniques that raise questions on the neuronal versus astrocytic origin of glutamate. The present studies used enzyme-based microelectrode arrays to monitor second-by-second resting glutamate levels in the PFC of awake rats. Locally applied drugs were employed in an attempt to discriminate between the neuronal or glial components of the resting glutamate signal. Local application of tetrodotoxin (sodium channel blocker), produced a significant (\u223c 40%) decline in resting glutamate levels. In addition significant reductions in extracellular glutamate were seen with locally applied \u03c9-conotoxin (MVIIC; \u223c 50%; calcium channel blocker), and the mGluR(2/3) agonist, LY379268 (\u223c 20%), and a significant increase with the mGluR(2/3) antagonist LY341495 (\u223c 40%), effects all consistent with a large neuronal contribution to the resting glutamate levels. Local administration of D,L-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate (glutamate transporter inhibitor) produced an \u223c 120% increase in extracellular glutamate levels, supporting that excitatory amino acid transporters, which are largely located on glia, modulate clearance of extracellular glutamate. Interestingly, local application of (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine (cystine/glutamate antiporter inhibitor), produced small, non-significant bi-phasic changes in extracellular glutamate versus vehicle control. Finally, pre-administration of tetrodotoxin completely blocked the glutamate response to tail pinch stress. Taken together, these results support that PFC resting glutamate levels in rats as measured by the microelectrode array technology are at least 40-50% derived from neurons. Furthermore, these data support that the impulse flow-dependent glutamate release from a physiologically -evoked event is entirely neuronally derived.", 
    "107": "In chronic experiments with dogs with gastric fistulas the influence of amino acid taurine on the gastric secretion was investigated. We showed that taurine did not cause acid gastric secretion out of digestion, but increased the gastric secretion stimulated by histamine, increased the contents of gastric acid and pepsine in gastric secretes. When administered either 15 minutes or two hours prior histamine injection, taurine affected the Na+ and K+ concentrations in gastric juice. The greatest changes in the basic indices of gastric secretion were observed 14 hours after administration of taurine. In these experiments the contents of total proteins and components of adenile system in gastric secretes was increased also. Blockade of cholinoreceptors by atropine, benzohexonium and IEM-1678 decreased the effects of taurine on gastric secretion stimulated by histamine. Blockade of a-adrenoreceptors by phentolamine did not prevent the taurine-induced effects on histamine-stimulated gastric secretion. It is established that under conditions of the blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors by obsidane, taurine does not manifest entirely its potentiating influence on the gastric secretion stimulating by histamine. The data obtained indicate that taurine affects gastric secretion stimulated by histamine and realization of this effect occurs through M- and N-cholino- and B-adrenoreceptors.",

However, it remains unknown which subtype of \u03b2-adrenoceptors, \u03b2(1)- or \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor, is primarily responsible for the detrimental effects of propranolol on anaphylactic hypotension. Effects of \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists were therefore determined on the survival rate and systemic hypotension in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats that suffered from anaphylactic shock. Mean arterial pressure and portal venous pressure were simultaneously measured. The control rats showed a decrease in mean arterial pressure and an increase in portal venous pressure, but did not die within 48h after an injection of ovalbumin antigen. The survival rate of the rats pretreated with propranolol (1mg/kg; n=7), the selective \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (0.5mg/kg; n=7), or adrenalectomy (n=7) was significantly smaller than that with the selective \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (2mg/kg; n=7). However, the changes in mean arterial pressure and portal venous pressure were similar for 10min after antigen among any groups, although propranolol and atenolol attenuated the antigen-induced increase in heart rate. Furthermore, bolus injections of epinephrine (3\u03bcg/kg) at 3 and 5min after antigen prevented the death of the atenolol-pretreated rats, but only marginally prolonged the survival rates for the ICI 118,551- or propranolol-pretreated and adrenalectomized rats. In conclusion, in rat anaphylactic shock, inhibition of \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor causes more detrimental effects than that of the \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptor. These \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists may exert detrimental effects on rat systemic anaphylaxis via inhibiting beneficial actions of catecholamines endogenously released from the adrenal gland.", 
    "142": "Although the potent anti-parkinsonian action of the atypical D\u2081-like receptor agonist SKF83959 has been attributed to the selective activation of phosphoinositol(PI)-linked D\u2081 receptor, whereas the mechanism underlying its potent neuroprotective effect is not fully understood. In the present study, the actions of SKF83959 on neuronal membrane potential and neuronal excitability were investigated in CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices. SKF83959 (10-100 \u00b5M) caused a concentration-dependent depolarization, associated with a reduction of input resistance in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The depolarization was blocked neither by antagonists for D\u2081, D\u2082, 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors and \u03b1\u2081-adrenoceptor, nor by intracellular dialysis of GDP-\u03b2-S. However, the specific HCN channel blocker ZD7288 (10 \u00b5M) antagonized both the depolarization and reduction of input resistance caused by SKF83959. In voltage-clamp experiments, SKF83959 (10-100 \u00b5M) caused a concentration-dependent increase of Ih current in CA1 pyramidal neurons, which was independent of D\u2081 receptor activation. Moreover, SKF83959 (50 \u00b5M) caused a 6 mV positive shift in the activation curve of Ih and significantly accelerated the activation of Ih current. In addition, SKF83959 also reduced the neuronal excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, which was manifested by the decrease in the number and amplitude of action potentials evoked by depolarizing currents, and by the increase of firing threshold and rhoebase current. The above results suggest that SKF83959 increased Ih current through a D\u2081 receptor-independent mechanism, which led to the depolarization of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. These findings provide a novel mechanism for the drug's neuroprotective effects, which may contributes to its therapeutic benefits in Parkinson's disease.", 
    "143": "Right heart function is the main determinant of prognosis in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). At present, no treatments are currently available that directly target the right ventricle, as we will demonstrate in this article. Meta-analysis of clinical trials in PAH revealed that current PAH medication seems to have limited cardiac-specific effects when analysed by the pump-function graph. Driven by the hypothesis that \"left\" and right heart failure might share important underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, we evaluated the clinical potential of left heart failure (LHF) therapies for PAH, based on currently available literature. As in LHF, the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotension-aldosterone system are highly activated in PAH. From LHF we know that intervening in this process, e.g. by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or \u03b2-blockade, is beneficial in the long run. Therefore, these medications could be also beneficial in PAH. Furthermore, the incidence of sudden cardiac death in PAH could be reduced by implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Finally, pilot studies have demonstrated that interventricular dyssynchrony, present at end-stage PAH, responded favourably to cardiac resynchronisation therapy as well. In conclusion, therapies for LHF might be relevant for PAH. However, before they can be implemented in PAH management, safety and efficacy should be evaluated first in well-designed clinical trials.",

CTGF induction was determined in a rat PO model, and olmesartan, hydralazine or saline was continuously administered. The effects of olmesartan on CTGF induction, myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis were evaluated. The effect of olmesartan on cardiac function was also examined in CTGF- and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21)-infused rats.

Despite higher age (51 years vs. 38 years, p < 0.0001) and more severe head injury (head Abbreviated Injury Scale score 4.14 vs. 3.81, p < 0.0001), there was no difference in mortality (15% vs. 16%). Multivariable logistic regression identified BB as protective in patients sustaining head injury (odds ratio, 0.347; confidence interval, 0.246-0.490), when compared with those who did not receive BB, reducing mortality by 65%.",

Thirty healthy persons were studied as controls. Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-10 in CD4+ T lymphocytes were quantified by three-color flow cytometry. cAMP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were tested by radioimmunoassay at baseline and 6 months after treatment.", 
    "203": "The levels of lymphocyte cAMP in CHF patients were significantly lower than in normal controls (p < 0.01). The IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 ratio was significantly higher in CHF patients (p < 0.01). The levels of cAMP, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 among CHF patients with different pathogenic factors displayed no significant differences (p > 0.05). The lymphocyte cAMP level was negatively correlated with the IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 ratio (p < 0.01). After treatment with metoprolol and carvedilol, the IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 ratio in the CHF patients was dramatically decreased (p < 0.01 for each drug) and lymphocyte cAMP was remarkably increased (p < 0.01 for each drug).",

    "205": "N-type (Ca(v)2.2) voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) play an important role in presynaptic neurotransmitter release in the autonomic nervous system and may be clinically relevant in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The physiological impact of N-type VDCC ablation on cardiac function, stimulus-release coupling and cardiac autonomic regulation was studied using mice deficient in the \u03b1(1B) subunit of the N-type channel (N-type-/-).The positive inotropic effect (increase in +dP/dt) secondary to high frequency field stimulation (HFFS), mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, was decreased by 33 \u00b1 12.6% in N-type-/- versus 89 \u00b1 11.4% in Wild-Type (WT)(P<0.01), whereas the negative inotropic response (decrease in +dP/dt) following HFFS in the presence of propranolol, mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system, was similar to that in Wild-type (WT) animals 34 \u00b1 5.0% and 35 \u00b1 5.4%, respectively. There were no changes in the postsynaptic \u03b2-adrenergic responsiveness, \u03b2-adrenoreceptor density or adenylyl cyclase activity. N-type-/- hearts demonstrated an increased contractile response to \u03b1(1)-adrenoreceptor (\u03b1(1)-ADR) stimulation with 10(-5)M phenylephrine in the presence of the \u03b2-blocker propranolol, which might be attributed to an increased expression of PLC\u03b21. Protein abundance of other signal transducers for \u03b1(1) ADR transduction protein was not changed in the N-type-/- hearts. These results suggest that selective impairment of sympathetic inflow does not modulate postsynaptic \u03b2-adrenergic responsiveness, but causes increased functional response to \u03b1(1)-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "206": "Beta-blockers are a highly promising treatment modality for complicated infantile hemangiomas (IH). However, data on propranolol as first-line treatment, objective outcome measures and impact on hemodynamics in young infants is limited. We retrospectively evaluated a homogenous group of infants with proliferating complicated IH treated with propranolol (2 mg/kg/day). Outcome was assessed by blinded evaluation of clinical photographs by visual analogue scale (VAS), ultrasound examination and ophthalmological review (if appropriate). Tolerance and hemodynamic variables were recorded over time, including a 2-day in-patient observation at the initiation of therapy. Twenty-five infants (median age 3.6 (1.5-9.1) months) were included in the study. The median follow-up-time was 14 (9-20) months and 14 patients completed treatment at a median age of 14.3 (11.4-22.1) months, after a duration of 10.5 (7.5-16) months. In all patients, there was significant fading of colour (with a VAS of -9 (-6 to -9) after 7 months) and significant decrease in size of the IH (with a VAS of -8 (-3 to -10) after 7 months). Median thickness of the lesions assessed by ultrasound at baseline and after 1 month was 14 (7-28) mm and 10 (5-23) mm, respectively (p < 0.01). In children with periocular involvement, astigmatism and amblyopia resolved rapidly within 8 weeks. The overall tolerance of propranolol was good, and no relevant hemodynamic changes were noted.",

    "208": "Baroreflex failure syndrome is a rare disorder seen after bilateral carotid body tumor resection. Iatrogenic injuries to the baroreceptor reflex arc cause fluctuations in blood pressure with hypertensive attacks or hypotensive episodes. A 43-year-old woman underwent bilateral carotid body tumor resection with one-week interval for a hypervascular tumor, 78 x 50 x 45 mm in size, at the right carotid artery bifurcation and a smaller tumor (50 x 30 x 20 mm) in the contralateral neck. Blood pressure of the patient became significantly unstable after excision of the second tumor, with hypertensive attacks up to 220/140 mmHg, accompanied by episodes of severe frontal headache, nausea, vomiting, skin flushing, and synchronous sinus tachycardia of 130 beats/min. Intermittent episodes of hypotension and bradycardia were also noted. The patient was clinically diagnosed as having baroreflex failure syndrome. The symptoms of the patient improved with medical therapy including clonidine, low dose beta-blocker, metoprolol, and a sedative. During 10 months of follow-up, she was generally well with residual episodes of hypertension about twice a month. In patients with bilateral carotid body tumors, unilateral excision of the greater tumor and a conservative approach for the contralateral tumor seem to be a more convenient approach to prevent baroreflex failure.",

Coronary slow flow was determined by the TIMI frame count method. Patients with SCF received nebivolol treatment (5 mg/day) for six months. Blood samples were analyzed for malondialdehyde (MDA) and serum nitric oxide (NO) levels, and erythrocyte catalase (CAT) and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the control group and, in SCF patients, at baseline and after six months of nebivolol treatment.",

TIMI frame counts measured from the left anterior descending, circumflex, and right coronary arteries were significantly higher in the SCF group (p < 0.0001). Baseline MDA and NO levels, and SOD and CAT activities were significantly different between the two groups, with significantly increased MDA (p < 0.0001), and significantly decreased SOD (p < 0.0001), CAT (p < 0.001), and NO (p < 0.001) in the SCF group. After six months of nebivolol treatment, all oxidative stress parameters showed significant improvements compared to the baseline values (p < 0.0001 for MDA, SOD, CAT, and NO) and approximated to the values of the control group.",

The 2,708-patient \u03b2-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) originally determined hospitalization type via investigator case report forms (CRFs), which captured whether a hospitalization was due to worsening heart failure (HF). Recently, the BEST End Points Committee (EPC) completed a blinded adjudication of all hospitalizations, allowing a comparison of the CRF method to the EPC method of determining hospitalization type. We sought to compare the investigator-determined mode of hospitalizations with the adjudicated events, to quantify the degree of agreement, and to compare the clinical trial results by method of event classification.",

    "217": "Citrus lemon (CL) belongs to Rutaceae family and is popularly known in Brazil as lim\u00e3o siciliano. The phytochemical analysis of CL fruit bark essential oil showed two majority components, limonene (LIM) and \u03b2-pinene (PIN). This study aimed to evaluate the gastroprotective mechanism of action from CL, LIM and PIN in ethanol- and indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers and its in vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori activity. After ethanol-induced gastric ulcer, the ulcer area was measured and the stomachs were destined to histology (HE and PAS), immunohistochemistry for HSP-70 and VIP and glutathione (GSH) measurement. The involvement of nitric oxide (NO) and sulfhydryl (SH) compounds was determined. The ulcer area for indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers was measured. PGE\u2082 concentration was biochemically measured. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against H. pylori was determined in vitro. In ethanol model, CL and LIM demonstrated 100% of gastroprotection, while PIN did not exert effective gastroprotection (53.26%). In the indomethacin model, CL and LIM offered effective gastroprotection but PIN did not show gastroprotective effect. The gastric ulcer area of rats pretreated with NO-synthase inhibitor or SH-blocker was decreased in comparison to the control group. The MIC obtained for CL was 125 \u03bcg/mL, for LIM was 75 \u03bcg/mL and for PIN was 500 \u03bcg/mL. The gastroprotective effect of CL and LIM was involved with increasing in mucus secretion, HSP-70 and VIP, but not with GSH, NO or SH compounds. CL gastroprotective mechanism is involved with PGE\u2082. PIN did not present gastroprotective activity.", 
    "218": "Organic solvents are traditionally added to micellar mobile phases to achieve adequate retention times and peak profiles, in a chromatographic mode which has been called micellar liquid chromatography (MLC). The organic solvent content is limited to preserve the formation of micelles. However, at increasing organic solvent contents, the transition to a situation where micelles do not exist is gradual. Also, there is no reason to neglect the potentiality of mobile phases containing only surfactant monomers instead of micelles (high submicellar chromatography, HSC). This is demonstrated here for the analysis of \u03b2-blockers. The performance of four organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and acetonitrile) was compared in mobile phases containing the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate in the MLC and HSC modes. The association of the organic solvent molecules with micelles gives rise to a significant loss in the elution strength of the organic solvent; whereas upon disruption of micelles, it tends to that observed in the hydro-organic mode. The elution behaviour of the \u03b2-blockers was modelled to predict the retention times. This allowed the detailed exploration of the selectivity and resolution of the chromatographic systems in relatively wide ranges of concentration of surfactant and organic solvent. The best performance in terms of resolution and analysis time was achieved using HSC with acetonitrile, being able to base-line resolve a mixture of eight \u03b2-blockers. Ethanol also provided a good separation performance, significantly improved with respect to methanol and 1-propanol. In contrast, the hydro-organic mode using acetonitrile or any of the short-chain alcohols could not succeed with the separation of the \u03b2-blockers, owing to the poorer selectivity and wider peaks.", 
    "219": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs), which alter the intracellular calcium concentration by modifying calcium flux across cell membranes and affect various intracellular signaling processes, have been long and widely used to treat essential hypertension and certain types of cardiac diseases such as angina pectoris. Among five subtypes of calcium channels, only specific agents for L-type calcium channels have been used as therapeutics. Animal experiments have indicated that topical application of CCBs, especially verapamil, caused significant intraocular pressure (IOP) reductions, while ocular hypotensive effects in humans were not substantial. Although the results obtained for nifedipine and nimodipine were not always consistent, CCBs generally dilate isolated ocular vessels and increase ocular blood flow in experimental animals, normal humans, and patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG). Several single-centered, hospital-based, prospective studies have suggested that nimodipine, brovincamine, and nilvadipine had beneficial effects on visual function not only in normal humans but also in patients with OAG, while the results of population-based and case-controlled studies were not always consistent with those obtained in hospital-based studies. In vitro studies showed that CCBs exerted neuroprotective effects on neurons undergoing apoptosis and necrosis. Although the neuroprotective effects of CCBs have been well documented in experimental cerebral ischemia models, no controlled studies have shown the clinical efficacy of CCBs in stroke or cerebral ischemia. Neuroprotective effects also were documented in retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors in experimental animals. Some ophthalmic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, especially betaxolol, interact with L-type calcium channels and show calcium channel-blocking activity, which may be partly responsible for the neuroprotective effects of these drugs reported in experimental animals. Based on the reported findings of CCBs and that the results of clinical studies in acute cerebral ischemia may not be directly applicable to a chronic neurodegenerative ocular disorder, such as OAG, CCBs deserve future study to investigate strategies that are additive or synergetic to ocular hypotensive therapy for OAG, especially in patients with lower IOP.", 
    "220": "Catecholamines released by the orthosympathetic system play a major role in the short- and long-term regulation of cardiovascular function. Beta1- and beta2-adrenoreceptors (ARs) have classically been considered as mediating most of their effects on cardiac contraction. After their initial cloning and pharmacologic characterization in the late 1980s, beta3-ARs have been mostly thought of as receptors mediating metabolic effects (e.g., lipolysis) in adipocytes. However, definitive evidence for their expression and functional coupling in cardiovascular tissues (including in humans) has recently initiated a re-examination of their implication in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. Distinctive pharmacodynamic properties of beta3-AR, e.g., their upregulation in disease and resistance to desensitization, suggest that they may be attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. They may substitute efficient vasodilating pathways when beta1/2-ARs are inoperative. In the heart, their contractile effects, which are functionally antipathetic to those of beta1/2-AR, may protect the myocardium against adverse effects of excessive catecholamine stimulation and perhaps mediate additional ancillary effects on key aspects of electrophysiology or remodeling. Longitudinal studies in animals and patients with different stages of heart failure are now needed to identify the optimal therapeutic scheme using specific combinations of agonists or antagonists at all three beta-ARs.", 
    "221": "Heart rate (HR) is determined by the pacemaker activity of cells from the sinoatrial node (SAN), located in the right atria. Spontaneous electrical activity of SAN cells results from a diastolic depolarization (DD). Despite controversy in the exact contribution of funny current (I(f)) in pacemaking, it is a major contributor of DD. I(f) is an inward Na(+)/K(+) current, activated upon hyperpolarization and directly modulated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate. The f-proteins are hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, HCN4 being the main isoform of SAN. Ivabradine (IVA) decreases DD and inhibits I(f) in a use-dependent manner. Under normal conditions IVA selectively reduces HR and limits exercise-induced tachycardia, in animals and young volunteers. Reduction in HR with IVA both decreases myocardial oxygen consumption and increases its supply due to prolongation of diastolic perfusion time. In animal models and in human with coronary artery disease (CAD), IVA has anti-anginal and anti-ischemic efficacy, equipotent to classical treatments, \u03b2-blockers, or calcium channel blockers. As expected from its selectivity for I(f), the drug is safe and well tolerated with minor visual side effects. As a consequence, IVA is the first inhibitor of I(f) approved for the treatment of stable angina. Available clinical data indicate that IVA could improve the management of stable angina in all patients including those treated with \u03b2-blockers. As chronic elevation of resting HR is an independent predictor of mortality, pure HR reduction by inhibition of I(f) could, beyond the control of anti-anginal symptoms, improve the prognosis of CAD and heart failure; this therapeutic potential is currently under evaluation with IVA.", 
    "222": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of Raman spectroscopy as a Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tool for the in-line determination of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) concentration and the polymer-drug solid state during a pharmaceutical hot-melt extrusion process. For in-line API quantification, different metoprolol tartrate (MPT)--Eudragit\u00ae RL PO mixtures, containing 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% MPT, respectively, were extruded and monitored in-line in the die using Raman spectroscopy. A PLS model, regressing the MPT concentrations versus the in-line collected Raman spectra, was developed and validated, allowing real-time API concentration determination. The correlation between the predicted and real MPT concentrations of the validation samples is acceptable (R(2)=0.997). The predictive performance of the calibration model is rated by the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), which is 0.59%. Two different polymer-drug mixtures were prepared to evaluate the suitability of Raman spectroscopy for in-line polymer-drug solid state characterization. Mixture 1 contained 90% Eudragit\u00ae RS PO and 10% MPT and was extruded at 140\u00b0C, hence producing a solid solution. Mixture 2 contained 60% Eudragit\u00ae RS PO and 40% MPT and was extruded at 105\u00b0C, producing a solid dispersion. The Raman spectra collected during these extrusion processes provided two main observations. First, the MPT Raman peaks in the solid solution broadened compared to the corresponding solid dispersion peaks, indicating the presence of amorphous MPT. Second, peak shifts appeared in the spectra of the solid dispersion and solid solution compared to the physical mixtures, suggesting interactions between Eudragit\u00ae RS PO and MPT, most likely hydrogen bonds. These shifts were larger in the spectra of the solid solution. DSC analysis confirmed these Raman solid state observations and the interactions seen in the spectra. Raman spectroscopy is a potential PAT-tool for in-line determination of the API concentration and the polymer-drug solid state during pharmaceutical hot-melt extrusion.", 
    "223": "The behaviour of \u03b2-blockers in a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (RPLC) column with mobile phases containing a short-chain alcohol (methanol, ethanol or 1-propanol), with and without the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), was explored. Two surfactant-mediated RPLC modes were studied, where the mobile phases contained either micelles or only surfactant monomers at high concentration. Acetonitrile was also considered for comparison purposes. A correlation was found between the effects of the organic solvent on micelle formation (monitored by the drop weight procedure) and on the nature of the chromatographic system (as revealed by the retention, elution strength and peak shape of \u03b2-blockers). When SDS is added to the mobile phase, the free surfactant monomers bind the C18 bonded chains on the stationary phase, forming an anionic layer, which attracts strongly the cationic \u03b2-blockers. The retention is modified as a consequence of the solving power of the organic solvent, micelles and surfactant monomers. The molecules of organic solvent bind the micelles, modify their shape, and may avoid their formation. They also bind the monomers of surfactant, desorbing them from the stationary phase, which affects the retention. The remaining surfactant covers the free silanols on the siliceous support, avoiding the interaction with the cationic solutes. The retention of \u03b2-blockers results from a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, the latter being weaker compared to the hydro-organic system. The peak efficiencies and asymmetries are excellent tools to probe the surfactant layer on the stationary phase in an SDS/organic solvent system. The peaks will be nearly symmetrical wherever enough surfactant coats the stationary phase (up to 60% methanol, 40% ethanol, 35% 1-propanol, and 50% acetonitrile).", 
    "224": "Management of systolic heart failure can be particularly challenging in patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those who are not yet receiving dialysis. Few clinical trials have been performed in this particular population, so management is directed by evidence from studies of patients with limited or no renal impairment. Their heightened risk for many treatment complications mandates additional considerations regarding drug selection, dosing, and monitoring. Subspecialty consultation is driven by patient instability or disease progression, intolerance of standard treatment, or need for device placement.", 
    "225": "Antibiotic and non-antibiotic sulphonamides are often prescribed. Although chemical differences make cross-reactivity rare, reactions may be severe in patients allergic to sulphur. Adverse reactions are common with sulphonamides but low platelets and skin changes are rarely associated with eye-drops for glaucoma. A woman treated with dorzolamide and timolol presented with disseminated eruption. On admission, her physical examination was unremarkable except for the skin changes and severe thrombocytopaenia was detected. Skin biopsy showed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, perivascular and periadnexal infiltrates with no vasculitis. After discontinuation of eye-drops, the eruption improved but low platelets persisted. Skin changes reappeared with use of dapsone which suggested sulphonamide cross-reactivity."
