    "0": "Clinical outcomes of patients with unstable angina are variable. We sought to identify predictors of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with unstable angina and to investigate whether these factors would predict the magnitude of benefit achieved with platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. We analyzed 20 variables in the 1,915 patients enrolled in the Platelet Receptor Inhibition for Ischemic Syndrome Management in Patients Limited by Unstable Signs and Symptoms trial. Five independent predictors were identified: age >65 years, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, antecedent aspirin use, antecedent beta-blocker use, and ST depressions on the presenting electrocardiogram. A risk score system was created using these predictors in which patients were assigned 1 point for the presence of each risk factor. There was a progressive increase in the rate of the composite end point of death, myocardial infarction, or refractory ischemia at 7 days with an increasing number of risk factors. For patients treated with heparin alone, the composite end point event rate was 6.5% in the group with 0 or 1 predictor, 14.6% in the group with 2 predictors, 22.7% in the group with 3 predictors, and 37.1% in the group with 4 or 5 predictors (p <0.00001). When dividing patients into low- (0 or 1 point), medium- (2 or 3 points), and high-risk (4 or 5 points) groups, the addition of tirofiban to heparin therapy was associated with no significant benefit in the low-risk group, a 5.2% absolute reduction in the medium-risk group (p = 0.05), and a 16% absolute reduction in the high-risk group (p = 0.0055). Thus, we have developed a risk score system using 5 variables that can be used to identify patients at high risk for death and cardiac ischemic events and who experience the greatest benefit from the addition of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor to their treatment regimen.", 
    "1": "Congestive heart failure is a common and serious complication in patients undergoing chronic dialysis. However, there have been no studies on preferential medical therapies to improve left ventricular function in haemodialysis patients. Beta-blocker treatment is known to improve left ventricular function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy; moreover, plasma levels of noradrenaline and natriuretic peptides are sensitive markers of left ventricular dysfunction. The present study investigated whether beta-blocker treatment could improve left ventricular function in haemodialysis patients with a dilated left ventricle. Our study group comprised 14 haemodialysis patients with a dilated left ventricle, who had undergone maintenance haemodialysis for a mean of 11 years. The following haemodynamic parameters were evaluated before and after 4 months of treatment with the beta-blocker metoprolol: left ventricular dimension at end-systole and end-diastole, and fractional shortening. Plasma levels of noradrenaline, atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide were also determined. Dry body weight and haemoglobin concentration showed no significant change after compared with before treatment with metoprolol. Heart rate decreased significantly, from 79+/-9 beats/min to 69+/-9 beats/min, but systolic blood pressure remained unchanged. The left ventricular dimension both at end-systole and at end-diastole was decreased, and fractional shortening increased significantly. Plasma levels of noradrenaline did not change significantly, but those of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide decreased markedly [from 100+/-89 pg/ml to 46+/-29 pg/ml (P=0.0051) and from 549+/-516 pg/ml to 140+/-128 pg/ml (P=0.0035) respectively]. In conclusion, beta-blocker therapy with metoprolol can markedly attenuate left ventricular remodelling and decrease the plasma levels of natriuretic peptides in haemodialysis patients with a dilated left ventricle.", 
    "2": "There is accumulating evidence of cross-regulation between stimulatory G-protein (G(s))-coupled receptors in human atrium. Chronic beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist treatment can sensitize beta(2)-adrenoreceptors, 5-HT(4) receptors, histamine H(2) receptors and possibly beta(4)-adrenoreceptors. To investigate the mechanism of such cross-talk between G(s)-coupled receptors, we have measured the mRNA expression of the cardiac adenylate cyclases (types IV, V, VI and VII) and of beta-adrenoceptor kinase 1 in human atria using TaqMan quantitative PCR, and compared expression between patients chronically receiving a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist and non-treated patients. The results showed no difference in gene expression between the two groups of patients; however, significant positive correlations of gene expression between adenylate cyclase subtypes were found. We conclude that beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists do not change the absolute levels of gene expression of adenylate cyclase subtypes in human atrium. The co-ordinate regulation among adenylate cyclase subtypes and the influence of beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists need to be investigated further.", 
    "3": "Spectral analysis of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) oscillations has traditionally concentrated on spectral power, although a shift in spectral frequency characterises the variability better than power in some cases. Experimental data were obtained from 14 healthy males in control and pharmacological blockade conditions. When parasympathetic control was reduced, LF oscillations of HR and BP tend to shift towards lower frequencies. Three parameters were compared to estimate the spectral shift within the low frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) band in HR and BP variability: mean (fmean), median (fmed), and central frequency (fc). Parameter variance (pSTD) and sensitivity to noise were also estimated using realistic HR, systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) data. fmean showed the lowest parameter variance both for an autoregressive (AR) method (SBP pSTD 3.1 vs 4.8 vs 4.7 mHz for fmean, fmed and fc, respectively; p<0.001) and an FFT method (SBP pSTD 4.7 vs 7.7 mHz for fmean and fmed, respectively; p<0.001). Furthermore, fmean was least sensitive to noise. fc showed the poorest performance being especially sensitive to noise. To analyse the spectral shift, fmean is preferred, since it performs better than fc, which has been used in most previous studies. To quantify the frequency of oscillations in cardiovascular signals, the mean frequency is recommended, with analyses across different spectral bands.", 
    "4": "A new Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE) procedure for determination of esmolol, an ultra-short-acting beta-blocker, in serum was developed. Dichloromethane was applied as a deproteination agent and it was used also for the inactivation of erythrocytal esterase and in the same time for the extraction of esmolol from blood. The re-extraction of esmolol from organic phase to water phase was performed by 0.01 M HCl. An aliquot of 200 ml of acid aqueous phase was used for the injection and analysis. CZE determination was done in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH=8.0) with detection at 222 nm. The concentration detection limit of esmolol in serum was 0.051 microg/ml. This method was applied in an extensive heart surgery experiment on pigs (Sus scrofa).", 
    "5": "Experimental evidence suggests that substances able to interact with voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) might be beneficial in glaucoma management. It was therefore of significance to show that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists used in glaucoma directly interact with L-type VDCCs. In the present study, the affinity of several antiglaucoma drugs (betaxolol, carteolol, levobunolol, timolol, brimonidine, dorzolamide, latanoprost and pilocarpine) for these and other VDCCs was investigated using radioligand binding assays. Experiments were also carried out to assess the effect of antiglaucoma drugs on the NMDA-stimulated Ca2+ influx into isolated rat retinas.",

    "7": "Only beta-adrenoceptor antagonists significantly interacted with radioligand binding to L-type VDCCs, with betaxolol displaying the highest potency. None of the antiglaucoma drugs tested showed any significant affinity for either N- or P/Q-type VDCCs. Only beta-adrenoceptor antagonists attenuated the NMDA-stimulated 45Ca2+ influx into isolated rat retinas, with betaxolol exhibiting at least 10 times higher potency than timolol. Brimonidine, dorzolamide, latanoprost and pilocarpine did not elicit any significant effect on the NMDA-stimulated 45Ca2+ influx. Additional experiments strongly suggested that the effect of betaxolol on the NMDA-stimulated 45Ca2+ resulted from inhibition of L-type VDCCs.", 
    "8": "Of the antiglaucoma drugs investigated, betaxolol displays the greatest L-type VDCC-blocking activity and this may be of clinical relevance. Such a characteristic could account for some of its described ocular actions.", 
    "9": "We defined risk factors for a clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) among subjects of the population-based Massachusetts Male Aging Study. In 1987-89 1709 men aged 40-70 provided baseline risk factor data and were followed for a mean of 9 years; 1019 men without prostate cancer provided follow-up data. We classified men with clinical BPH at follow-up if they reported (1) frequent or difficulty urinating and were told by a health professional that they had an enlarged or swollen prostate or (2) if they reported having surgery for BPH. At follow-up the prevalence of clinical BPH was 19.4%, increasing from 8.4% of men aged 38-49 years to 33.5% of men aged 60-70 years (P < 0.001 for trend). Elevated free PSA levels (age- and total PSA-adjusted OR, top vs. bottom quartile ng/mL 4.4, 95% CI 1.9-10.5), heart disease (age-adjusted OR 2.1, CI 1.3-3.3), and use of beta-blocker medications (OR 1.8, CI 1.1-3.0) increased odds for BPH, while current cigarette smoking (OR 0.5, CI 0.3-0.8) and high levels of physical activity (top vs. bottom quartile kcals/day OR 0.5, CI 0.3-0.9) decreased odds of BPH. All but the medication effects persisted in fully adjusted multivariable models. Total or fat calorie intake, sexual activity level, alcohol intake, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, diastolic blood pressure, a history of diabetes, hypertension, vasectomy, or serum levels of androgens or estrogens did not individually predict clinical BPH. We conclude that physical exercise and cigarette smoking appear to protect against development of clinical BPH. Elevated free PSA levels predict clinical BPH independent of total PSA levels. Risk associated with heart disease does not appear to be due solely to detection bias or to effects of heart disease medications. A wide variety of other characteristics appear to have no influence on risk for clinical BPH.", 
    "10": "Psychotic symptoms in different neuropsychiatric disorders are treated by neuroleptic drugs. Neuroleptics are known to block dopamine (DA) neurotransmission, however, cell types mediating their actions have not been determined. Recently, astrocytes have been demonstrated to express D1- and D2-DA receptors, whose activation leads to transient increases in intracellular calcium concentration. We show here that DA-sensitivity of cortical and striatal rat astroglial cultures, as monitored by calcium imaging, is reduced by a 12-h exposure to the atypical antipsychotic agents Clozapine (>1 nmol/liter), Olanzapine (>100 nmol/liter), and Risperidone (>1 nmol/liter), but not by classical neuroleptics Haloperidol and Sulpiride. These effects could not be reverted by the receptor-specific antagonists SCH23390, Sulpiride, L745 870, Ergotamine, and Propranolol. In addition, RT-PCR and Western blot analyses concerning the effects of Clozapine, Olanzapine, and Risperidone on DA receptor expression in cortical and striatal astroglial cells revealed no alterations in mRNAs and immunoreactive protein of D1- and D2-DA receptor subtypes. These results provide the first evidence that atypical but not classical neuroleptic drugs reduce astroglial DA-sensitivity, a mechanism that may be important for a better understanding of differences in effects and side effects between atypical and classical neuroleptic drugs.",

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either brimonidine or betaxolol BID. Morning IOP was measured at baseline and at weeks 1 and 4 using Goldmann applanation. Efficacy was determined by reduction in IOP from baseline. Patients experiencing a > or =20% reduction in IOP were considered to have a successful IOP-lowering response. The Glaucoma Disability Index questionnaire was administered at week 4 to assess quality-of-life factors and the incidence of adverse events. Ophthalmic examinations were conducted at each visit.",

The majority were white (77.4%) and female (61.6%), and had a diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma (56.0%). After 4 weeks of treatment, both brimonidine and betaxolol effectively lowered IOP from baseline (mean IOP reductions: brimonidine, 5.96 mm Hg; betaxolol, 5.07 mm Hg; P = NS). However, a significantly higher percentage of brimonidine patients (52/81 [64.2%]) than betaxolol patients (37/78 [47.4%]) had a > or =20% reduction in IOP (P = 0.033). No serious adverse events were reported with either study medication.

    "19": "Nebivolol and atenolol similarly reduced (P< 0.001) clinic and ambulatory blood pressure by approximately 15/10 mmHg, systolic and diastolic. Clinic and ambulatory heart rate was reduced to a greater extent (P < 0.01) by atenolol than nebivolol. Atenolol was associated with an approximately 20% reduction in insulin sensitivity (insulin-induced glucose disposal rate/mean insulin concentration ratio, P < 0.01) and an approximately 10% reduction in glucose disappearance rate (K-value, P < 0.05), whereas these variables were not significantly modified with nebivolol. Cardiac output was reduced similarly (P < 0.05) by both drugs at rest but forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance or total peripheral resistance were unaffected. A significant inverse correlation coefficient between cardiac output and insulin sensitivity was found at baseline, suggesting that a compensatory increase in systemic blood flow occurs in hypertensive patients with progressively more marked insulin resistance. This relationship was unaffected by nebivolol but was lost with atenolol.", 
    "20": "These results indicate that insulin sensitivity was not modified significantly by nebivolol, whereas it was reduced by atenolol, although blood pressure was decreased to the same extent by both drugs. Neither drug induced systemic or forearm vasodilatation but the inverse relationship between cardiac output and insulin sensitivity was preserved with nebivolol but not with atenolol.", 
    "21": "Essential hypertension is associated with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation caused by oxygen free radical-induced nitric oxide (NO) breakdown.

Hypertensive patients were randomized to a 12-week treatment with lacidipine (4-6 mg/daily) or atenolol (50-100 mg/daily) (n = 10 each group). Lacidipine but not atenolol increased the vasodilation to acetylcholine and bradykinin and restored the inhibiting effect of L-NMMA on endothelium-dependent vasodilation, without affecting the response to sodium nitroprusside. Moreover, lacidipine reduced circulating markers of oxidative stress including plasma and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) hydroperoxides, the susceptibility of LDL to Cu2+-induced oxidation and the reactive oxygen species generated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells after incubation with LDL derived from plasma of the patients.",

    "25": "To improve the retention time of tilisolol in the precorneal area or vitreous body, we prepared liposomes incorporating the O-palmitoyl prodrug of tilisolol. O-Palmitoyl tilisolol was completely incorporated in the liposomes. After topical administration of O-palmitoyl tilisolol liposomes to the rabbit eye, O-palmitoyl tilisolol rapidly disappeared from the tear fluid. The inclusion of 2% carmellose sodium slightly prolonged the retention of O-palmitoyl tilisolol in the tear fluid. After intravitreal injection of O-palmitoyl tilisolol liposomes, there was a relatively prolonged retention of O-palmitoyl tilisolol in the vitreous body. At 24 and 48 h after intravitreal injection of O-palmitoyl tilisolol liposomes, the tilisolol concentration in the vitreous body was significantly higher compared with the concentration after intravitreal injection of tilisolol liposomes.", 
    "26": "Inflammatory pain, characterized by a decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold (hyperalgesia), arises through actions of inflammatory mediators, many of which sensitize primary afferent nociceptors via G-protein-coupled receptors. Two signaling pathways, one involving protein kinase A (PKA) and one involving the epsilon isozyme of protein kinase C (PKCepsilon), have been implicated in primary afferent nociceptor sensitization. Here we describe a third, independent pathway that involves activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2. Epinephrine, which induces hyperalgesia by direct action at beta(2)-adrenergic receptors on primary afferent nociceptors, stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in cultured rat dorsal root ganglion cells. This was inhibited by a beta(2)-adrenergic receptor blocker and by an inhibitor of mitogen and extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), which phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2. Inhibitors of G(i/o)-proteins, Ras farnesyltransferases, and MEK decreased epinephrine-induced hyper-algesia. In a similar manner, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was also decreased by these inhibitors. Local injection of dominant active MEK produced hyperalgesia that was unaffected by PKA or PKCepsilon inhibitors. Conversely, hyperalgesia produced by agents that activate PKA or PKCepsilon was unaffected by MEK inhibitors. We conclude that a Ras-MEK-ERK1/2 cascade acts independent of PKA or PKCepsilon as a novel signaling pathway for the production of inflammatory pain. This pathway may present a target for a new class of analgesic agents.", 
    "27": "Presynaptic ATP P2X receptors have been proposed to play a role in modulating glutamate release from the first sensory synapse in the spinal cord. Using spinal cord slice preparations and patch-clamp recordings from dorsal horn neurons in lamina V of the rat spinal cord, we showed that the activation of P2X receptors by alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (alphabetam-ATP) resulted in a large increase in the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) and miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). The increases in mEPSC frequency by alphabetam-ATP were not blocked by the Ca(2+) channel blocker, 30 microm La(3+), but were abolished in a bath solution when Ca(2+) was omitted. The increases in mEPSC frequency by alphabetam-ATP were blocked completely by the P2 receptor antagonist pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS) at 10 microm. Furthermore, the EPSCs evoked by dorsal root stimulation were potentiated by alphabetam-ATP as well as by the ecto-ATPase inhibitor ARL67156 and were depressed in the presence of P2 receptor antagonists PPADS (10 microm) and suramin (5 microm). The effects of these compounds on the evoked EPSCs were associated with the changes in glutamate release probability of primary afferent central terminals. Our results indicate that alphabetam-ATP-sensitive P2X receptors play a significant role in modulating excitatory sensory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord, and the potential role of endogenous ATP is suggested.", 
    "28": "The rodent pineal gland is the end point of several peripheral and central fibers innervating the superficial and deep parts of the gland. Up to now, only the sympathetic transmitter norepinephrine is thought to regulate melatonin synthesis, although numerous biochemical experiments have reported in vitro effects of various transmitters on melatonin synthesis. To find out whether there is non-noradrenergic regulation of in vivo pineal metabolism, the mRNA encoding the enzyme arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase was studied using the highly sensitive technique of in situ hybridization. The existence of a marked nocturnal increase of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase mRNA in the superficial pineal gland was confirmed. Interestingly and for the first time, a similar daily variation was observed in the deep pineal. After removal of superior cervical ganglia, the daily rhythm in arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase mRNA was abolished in both the superficial and deep pineal indicating that the rhythm is driven by sympathetic input in the entire pineal complex. Interestingly, the remaining arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase mRNA level in the pineal of day- and night-time ganglionectomized rats was significantly higher than in the pineal of day-time intact animals. These data reveal a sympathetic-dependent day-time inhibition of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase gene expression. In addition, the day-time pineal arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase mRNA expression in ganglionectomized rats persisted after adrenal gland removal but was reduced by 50% after propranolol injection. These results indicate that arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase mRNA in ganglionectomized rats is not induced by circulating catecholamines and may be caused by both a centrally originated norepinephrine, as already suggested, and other non-adrenergic transmitter(s). In conclusion, this work shows that norepinephrine drives the nocturnal increase of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase gene expression both in the superficial and deep pineal and strongly suggests that other neurotransmitters are involved in day-time inhibition and night-time stimulation of pineal metabolism.", 
    "29": "We have compared the formation of pores in rat submandibular acinar cells in response to 2',3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (Bz-ATP) and maitotoxin. Bz-ATP (100 microM) permeabilized the cells to ethidium bromide. The uptake of ethidium increased to 29+/-1% of maximal uptake in 10 min. DL-Propranolol (300 microM) inhibited the Bz-ATP-induced uptake of ethidium bromide by 40% without affecting the P2X(7)-gated cation channel. The inhibitory effect of DL-propranolol on the formation of pores by Bz-ATP was reproduced by D-propranolol, an optical isomer with very poor beta-blocking activity. Tenidap, an antiinflammatory drug, enhanced the permeabilization in response to Bz-ATP. Propanolol inhibited the response to tenidap plus Bz-ATP. The effect of propranolol was reproduced by labetolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist with membrane-stabilizing properties, but not by atenolol, which blocks beta-adrenergic receptors but has no effect on the stability of the membrane. In the presence of extracellular calcium, maitotoxin also increased the uptake of ethidium bromide. Tenidap had no effect on this response, which was delayed by propranolol. In conclusion, we have shown that propranolol, in a range of 10-300 microM, inhibits the pore-forming activity of the P2X(7) receptor without affecting the opening of the cation channel coupled to this receptor. This inhibition is not related to its beta-adrenergic blocking activity but rather to its membrane-stabilizing properties. Propranolol also delays the uptake of ethidium bromide in response to maitotoxin. This is in agreement with the current view that P2X(7) agonists and maitotoxin share a common pore.", 
    "30": "beta(2)-adrenoceptors (beta(2)AR) are polymorphic at amino acid 164 (Thr or Ile) of the fourth transmembrane domain. In transfected fibroblasts, six agonists commonly used in the treatment of bronchospasm were studied. Isoproterenol, albuterol, metaproterenol, terbutaline, formoterol, and salmeterol displayed decreased binding affinities (K(i)s were 1.2-3.0-fold higher) and a significant degree of impaired maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase ( approximately 40%), was observed with all agonists for the Ile164 receptor. The ratios of signal transduction efficiencies (Tau function, Ile164/Thr164) varied from a low of 0.17 for terbutaline to 0.49 for salmeterol. In addition, Ile164 bound salmeterol at the exosite, as delineated in perfusion washout studies, at a decreased level (31+/-4.8% vs. 49+/-4.4% retained salmeterol, respectively, P=0.02). In cAMP production studies under perfusion conditions, this decreased exosite binding caused a approximately 50% decrease in the duration of action of salmeterol at Ile164 (t(1/2)=21.0+/-3.6 vs. 46.8+/-4.1 min for Thr164, P=0.001). The durations of action for isoproterenol and formoterol under similar perfusion conditions were not different between the two receptors. These in vitro results indicate the Ile164 polymorphic receptor represents a pharmacogenetic locus for the most commonly utilized agonists in the treatment of asthma with a unique phenotype for salmeterol.", 
    "31": "Although hypotension during dobutamine stress echocardiography has been reported, the mechanism of this response is still controversial. In two patients, a 72-year-old woman and 64-year-old man, with exercise-induced ST-T change, continuous-wave Doppler examination of the left ventricular cavity was performed at baseline and peak dobutamine infusion. No echocardiographic abnormalities at rest or angiographic coronary lesions were observed in either patient. The intracavitary pressure gradient at peak dosage of dobutamine for both patients was 121 mm Hg and 100 mm Hg, and was reproducibly confirmed by cardiac catheterization. During dobutamine infusion, echocardiography or left ventriculography revealed that papillary muscle motion was dramatically augmented by dobutamine and mid-left ventricular obstruction was produced at the systolic phase. Although blood pressure response improved following beta-blocker treatment, intracavitary pressure gradient during dobutamine infusion remained the same. A hypotensive response during dobutamine stress echocardiography may be produced by the development of dynamic intraventricular obstruction and a vasodepression reflex. The exercise-induced electrocardiographic changes may have been related to the systolic pressure augmentation in the mid-to-apical left ventricular cavity.", 
    "32": "If hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus type II is not adequately controlled by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i), a beta-blocker is frequently added as second-line therapy. Recently, large randomized trials demonstrated the beneficial effect of second-generation dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers in these patients. These compounds are increasingly being used to replace beta-blockers. Withdrawal of beta-blockers may influence diabetic control and may cause rebound hypertension. Any rebound hypertension from beta-blocker withdrawal may not occur if the beta-blocker is replaced with a calcium-channel blocker. A calcium-channel blocker will influence vascular resistance (VR) and blood pressure differently than a beta-blocker. Thirty-four patients with diabetes mellitus type II and a resting diastolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg despite enalapril 10 mg daily (or equipotent dosages of other ACE-i) for at least 3 months were treated in an open label sequential comparison with the same ACE-i in combination with the beta-blocker metoprolol 100 mg for 3 months, and, subsequently for 3 more months with the same ACE-i in combination with the dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker lercanidipine 10 mg once daily. After 6 weeks, patients with a diastolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg were titrated up to 200 mg metoprolol or 20 mg lercanidipine once daily. Patients were examined every 6 weeks during the trial, and after 2 weeks while receiving lercanidipine. In addition to blood pressure measurements, VR was measured by iridium strain gauge plethysmography and expressed in units (1 unit = 1 mm Hg/mL blood/100 mL tissue per minute). Two of 34 patients did not complete the protocol because of non-compliance with the lercanidipine treatment in the first 2 weeks of treatment. Their data are included in the analysis. No rebound hypertension 14 days after the change-over of therapies was observed. (Mean arterial pressures [MAPs] were not significantly different from the point of withdrawal of the beta-blockers.) However, heart rate rose from 69+/-7 to 94+/-10 beats/min (p < 0.001). After 3 months on lercanidipine, MAP fell by 6+/-10 mm Hg (p = 0.002) compared to the point of withdrawal of the beta-blocker. Vascular resistance fell by 6.28+/-11.91 units (p<0.01), while glucosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) rose by 0.4+/-0.5% (p<0.001) and body weight rose by 0.6+/-0.6 kg (p < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis revealed significant associations between decrease in VR, increase in HbAlc, and decrease in MAP, and partial dependence of these variables on one another. In hypertensive patients with diabetes type II, replacement of ACE-i and metoprolol with ACE-i and lercanidipine does not appreciably influence metabolic control and does not cause rebound hypertension. Lercanidipine was more effective than metoprolol as a second-line antihypertensive drug in these patients. At least two mechanisms may be involved: withdrawal of a pressor effect from the beta-blocker, and calcium-channel-mediated vasodilation.", 
    "33": "Here, we tested the hypothesis that receptor-G protein and agonist may form an irreversible complex in the absence of guanine nucleotides. We used the beta-adrenoceptor-G(s) system of guinea pig lung parenchymal membranes as a model. Two groups of membranes were used in the experiments: (1) washed with nucleotide-free buffer in the presence of isoproterenol (isoproterenol-treated), and (2) washed with buffer alone or with agonist+GDP (both were treated as control). Results were as follows: (1) the iodopindolol binding capacity of isoproterenol-treated membranes was reduced by about 30%. (2) No such reduction was observed in control membranes. (3) Addition of GDP to the isoproterenol-treated membranes completely restored the pindolol binding capacity. We interpreted this result as indicating irreversible agonist-receptor complex is formed when the receptor interacts with nucleotide-free G(salpha). (4) We observed a single peak of beta(2)-adrenoceptor activity in the control group by size-exclusion chromatography of the solubilized membranes. Inclusion of isoproterenol in the washing buffer led to an additional (heavier) peak of beta(2)-adrenoceptor activity. This peak disappeared when GDP was added to the detergent extract before high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Western blot analysis of these HPLC fractions showed that the agonist-induced heavier peak contained significantly more G(salpha) protein than did the other fractions. We interpreted this result as indicating that a practically irreversible complex of receptor and G protein is formed in the absence of GDP. We suggest that the tightly bound (nucleotide-free) receptor-G protein complex also contains the agonist, and that this complex can be reversed only by the addition of nucleotides. The implications of these results are also discussed.",

Because of inadequate compensation of the basic disease dorsolamide was added and the patients were followed up for a 12-month period. All combinations decreased significantly the intraocular pressure during the long-term follow up. The greatest decrease was recorded after a combination of a prostaglandin analogue and dorsolamide.", 
    "35": "In this contribution the activity of antiglaucomatics--2% pilocarpine (pH 5.98), 0.5% timoptol (pH 6.58) and 0.005% xalatan (pH 6.83) is emphasized from the view of pH values and changes of the pH values of the rabbit aqueous humor in vitro after their application. The rabbit's aqueous humor pH is 7.59--similar to the human healthy eye (7.5-7.6). We observed that these antiglaucomatics decrease the aqueous humor pH to the acid levels in the following order: 2% pilocarpine > 0.5% timoptol > 0.005% xalatan. The most significant decrease was measured immediately after the application. From the view of speed of response and effectivity in time achieving the pH of the normal aqueous humor we constate the following order: 0.005% xalatan > 0.5% timoptol > 2% pilocarpine. The changes in pH of the aqueous humor after application of these antiglaucomatics are directly connect with their physiologic function in the eye. Moreover, they also point out the importance of the pH dependence of the antiglaucomatics applicated into the conjunctival sac in the treatment of the glaucoma disease.",

    "39": "As expected (R)- and (S)-FCZ had high affinities for beta-adrenergic receptors (Ki values=0.08-0.45 nM) and negligible affinities (Ki values>100 nM) for nearly all other tested receptors and transporters with the exception of the h5-HT1A receptor for which (S)-FCZ had high affinity (Ki=34 nM). Interestingly, (R)-FCZ had low affinity for the h5-HT1A receptor (Ki=342 nM).", 
    "40": "The high affinity of (S)-FCZ for the h5-HT1A receptor is not likely to interfere with studies of peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors, since 5-HT1A receptors are expressed at very low levels outside the central nervous system. Indeed, computer simulations predict that even at low ligand concentrations, 5-HT1A binding in brain regions like hippocampus are likely to be substantial. Thus, (S)-FCZ may not be a suitable PET ligand for studies of central nervous system beta-adrenergic receptors unless the contribution by 5-HT1A sites can be shown to be negligible.", 
    "41": "In the study of epithelial cell biology, primary cell cultures or cell lines grown to confluency offer considerable advantages compared with isolated cells and cell clusters. This is due mainly to the development of appropriate cell-to-cell contacts that are a prerequisite for cell polarity and thus vectorial solute transport. On the other hand, electrical coupling via gap junctions in most instances significantly hinders the use of voltage-clamp techniques for electrophysiological analysis of transport processes in single cells. In the present study we employed the gap junctional blocker 18-beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (BGA) to reduce electrical cell-to-cell coupling in confluent primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. In current-clamp experiments, 40 micromol/l BGA reversibly increased apparent cell input resistance approximately tenfold. Due to this partial electrical isolation of cells, two-channel voltage-clamp experiments became feasible and, for the first time, the hypertonicity-induced Na+ conductance of rat hepatocytes could be analysed quantitatively. In ion substitution experiments, however, it became obvious that BGA, while leaving Na+ and K+ conductances virtually unchanged, completely blocked cell membrane Cl- conductance. This additional effect of BGA necessitates independent control experiments to ensure that the transport process under consideration is itself not changed by the compound. Nevertheless, BGA may serve as a powerful tool for the quantitative electrophysiological study of epithelial cells that are in quasi physiological contact with their neighbours.", 
    "42": "Surveys of prescribing in both hospitals and primary care have shown delays in translating improved survival data from clinical trials into clinical practice thereby denying patients the benefits of proven treatments, such as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. This may be due to unfamiliarity with clinical guidelines and concerns about adverse events. Recent trials have shown that substantial improvements in survival are associated with spironolactone and beta-blocker therapy. In order to accelerate the uptake of these treatments, and to ensure that all eligible patients should receive the most appropriate medications, a clear and concise set of clinical recommendations has been prepared by a group of clinicians with practical expertise in the management of heart failure. The objective of these recommendations is to provide practical guidance for non-specialists in order to support the implementation of evidenced-based therapy for heart failure.

A pragmatic study design has been chosen that does not attempt to conceal allocation from investigators or patients because it is impossible to guarantee maintenance of blinding for the duration of the study. The end-points committee will adjudicate events in a blinded fashion. Since cardiac resynchronisation may alter other aspects of the management of the patient, as would occur in clinical practice, the study should be considered a comparison of strategies rather than simply of a device. The primary end-point is all-cause mortality or unplanned cardiovascular hospitalisation. The study should complete recruitment during 2002 and report in 2004.",

However, its efficacy in patients in whom beta-blockers have traditionally been contraindicated or caution has been advised has not been clearly determined. Therefore, analyses in high-risk subgroups of patients taking part in CIBIS II have been performed to investigate the effect of bisoprolol in elderly patients, in patients with type 2 diabetes, with renal failure, NYHA functional class IV or concomitantly treated with digitalis, aldosterone antagonists or amiodarone.",

Benefit was shown for the primary endpoint all cause mortality, as well as for the secondary endpoints.",

    "55": "Fourteen digitalised patients diagnosed with heart failure (NYHA Functional class II) with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in chronic established atrial fibrillation were administered carvedilol in addition to their anti-heart failure medications in an attempt to improve their heart rate control. Fourteen matched patients who did not receive carvedilol acted as control subjects. Patients treated with carvedilol showed significantly reduced resting heart rates (10-36%), maximal heart rates on exercise (5-20%) and an increased exercise time (2-30%) on treadmill stress tests (all P=0.001). Ventricular ectopic activity was also diminished. This was associated with symptomatic improvement in effort intolerance and palpitations. NYHA functional class, left ventricular dimensions and ejection fractions did not improve during the study period of 3 months. Thus, addition of carvedilol to digoxin had a beneficial effect on exercise tolerance in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in atrial fibrillation by virtue of an improved heart rate control both at rest and on exercise. Carvedilol was well tolerated despite impaired myocardial function.", 
    "56": "Cytochrome P450 (P450) 2D6 was first identified as the polymorphic human debrisoquine hydroxylase and subsequently shown to catalyze the oxidation of a variety of drugs containing a basic nitrogen. Differences in the regioselectivity of oxidation products formed in systems containing NADPH-P450 reductase/NADPH and the model oxidant cumene hydroperoxide have been proposed by others to be due to an allosteric influence of the reductase on P450 2D6 (Modi, S., Gilham, D. E., Sutcliffe, M. J., Lian, L.-Y., Primrose, W. U., Wolf, C. R., and Roberts, G. C. K. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 4461-4470). We examined the differences in the formation of oxidation products of N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine, metoprolol, and bufuralol between reductase-, cumene hydroperoxide-, and iodosylbenzene-supported systems. Catalytic regioselectivity was not influenced by the presence of the reductase in any of the systems supported by model oxidants, ruling out allosteric influences. The presence of the reductase had little effect on the affinity of P450 2D6 for any of these three substrates. The addition of the reaction remnants of the model oxidants (cumyl alcohol and iodobenzene) to the reductase-supported system did not affect reaction patterns, arguing against steric influences of these products on catalytic regioselectivity. Label from H(2)18O was quantitatively incorporated into 1'-hydroxybufuralol in the iodosylbenzene- but not in the reductase- or cumene hydroperoxide-supported reactions. We conclude that the P450 systems utilizing NADPH-P450 reductase, cumene hydroperoxide, and iodosylbenzene use similar but distinct chemical mechanisms. These differences are the basis for the variable product distributions, not an allosteric influence of the reductase.", 
    "57": "The beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) kinase (betaARK1) is a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) that controls cardiac betaAR signaling via receptor phosphorylation, leading to desensitization. We have observed in mice that chronic isoproterenol administration results in increased myocardial levels of betaARK1 activity, suggesting that adrenergic activation can regulate cardiac betaARK1 expression. Thus, we evaluated left ventricular (LV) betaARK1 levels and activity in response to 3 weeks of a low-sodium (0.05%) diet, which is known to chronically activate the sympathetic nervous system. Wistar-Kyoto rats were subjected to either low or regular sodium (2%) intake. To prove the association of betaARK1 expression and low sodium-induced adrenergic activation, a group of rats was subjected to atenolol treatment (1 mg/kg per day) during the low-sodium diet. LV betaARK1 expression was assessed by protein immunoblotting and betaARK1 activity by in vitro GRK phosphorylation assays. We verified the LV protein levels of GRK5, which is abundantly expressed in the heart. A low-sodium diet reduced body weight and cardiac size so that the heart-to-body weight ratio did not change. On the contrary, low-sodium diet increased by 50% both LV betaARK1 protein (densitometry units: normal sodium, 26.5+/-0.9; low sodium, 35.7+/-1.6; P<0.05) and activity (fmol/mg per minute: normal sodium, 6.49+/-1.17; low sodium, 9.15+/-0.93; P<0.05). Atenolol treatment prevented the increase in both protein expression (low sodium plus atenolol, 27.6+/-5.33, P=NS versus normal sodium) and activity (6.54+/-1.19, P=NS versus normal sodium). GRK5 expression was not affected by a low-sodium diet (17.2+/-0.2 versus 18.4+/-0.4, P=NS). Our data indicate that cardiac betaARK1 is regulated by sympathetic action on betaARs as tested by reducing dietary salt and betaAR blockade.", 
    "58": "Neurochemical, neuroautonomic and neuropharmacological assessments carried out on all our myasthenia gravis (MG) patients showed that they presented a neural sympathetic deficit plus excessive adrenal-sympathetic activity. These abnormalities were registered during the basal (supine-resting) state, as well as after several stress tests (orthostasis, exercise, oral glucose and buspirone). In addition, MG patients showed increased levels of free-serotonin (f5HT) in the plasma, supposedly associated with the increased platelet aggregability which we found in all MG patients. As the above trio of neurochemical disorders (low noradrenergic-activity + high adrenergic-activity + increased f-5HT plasma levels) is known to favor Th-1 immunosuppression + Th-2 predominance, we outlined a neuropharmacological strategy for reverting the above neurochemical disorder. This treatment provoked sudden (acute), and late sustained improvements. Acute effects have been attributed to the increase of alpha-1 activity at the spinal motoneuron level. Late improvements always paralleled a significant normalization of immunological disorders. Complete normalization was registered only in non-thymectomized MG patients.", 
    "59": "The sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) influences renal sodium excretion via activation of adrenergic receptors. The thick ascending limb (THAL) possesses both alpha-2 and beta-adrenergic receptors. However, the role(s) different adrenergic receptors play in how isolated THALs respond to NE are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that both alpha-2 and beta-adrenergic receptors are responsive to NE in the isolated THAL, with alpha-2 receptors inhibiting and beta-receptors stimulating chloride flux (J(Cl)). THALs from male Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused in vitro, and the effects of 1) incremental NE, 2) the alpha-2 agonist clonidine, and 3) the beta-agonist isoproterenol on J(Cl) were measured. Low concentrations (0.1 nM) of NE decreased J(Cl) from a rate of 114.2 +/- 8.1 to 93.5 +/- 14.6 pmol. mm(-1). min(-1) (P < 0.05), with the nadir occurring at 1 nM (67.7 +/- 8.8 pmol. mm(-1). min(-1); P < 0.05). In contrast, greater concentrations of NE significantly increased J(Cl) from the nadir to a maximal rate of 131.0 +/- 28.5 pmol. mm(-1). min(-1) at 10 microM (P < 0.05). To evaluate the adrenergic receptors mediating these responses, the THAL J(Cl) response to NE was measured in the presence of selective antagonists of beta- and alpha-2 receptors. A concentration of NE (1 microM), which alone tended to increase J(Cl), decreased THAL J(Cl) (from 148.9 +/- 16.4 to 76.2 +/- 13.6 pmol. mm(-1). min(-1); P < 0.01) in the presence of the beta-antagonist propranolol. In contrast, a concentration of NE (0.1 microM), which alone tended to decrease J(Cl), increased THAL J(Cl) (from 85.5 +/- 20.1 to 111.8 +/- 20.1 pmol. mm(-1). min(-1); P < 0.05) in the presence of the alpha-2 antagonist rauwolscine. To further clarify the role of different adrenergic receptors, selective adrenergic agonists were used. The alpha-2 agonist clonidine decreased J(Cl) from 102.4 +/- 9.9 to 54.0 +/- 15.7 pmol. mm(-1). min(-1), a reduction of 49.1 +/- 11.0% (P < 0.02). In contrast, the beta-agonist isoproterenol stimulated J(Cl) from 95.3 +/- 11.6 to 144.1 +/- 15.0 pmol. mm(-1). min(-1), an increase of 56 +/- 14% (P < 0.01). We conclude that 1) the sympathetic neurotransmitter NE exerts concentration-dependent effects on J(Cl) in the isolated rat THAL, 2) selective alpha-2 receptor activation inhibits THAL J(Cl), and 3) selective beta-receptor activation stimulates THAL J(Cl). These data indicate the response elicited by the isolated rat THAL to NE is dependent on the neurotransmitter concentration, such that application of NE in vitro biphasically modulates J(Cl) via differential activation of alpha-2 and beta-adrenergic receptors in a concentration-dependent manner.", 
    "60": "A C825T polymorphism was recently identified in the gene for the G-protein beta3 subunit, the T-allele being associated with hypertension. To better understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, we compared the haemodynamics of young healthy males with and without the T-allele. In three studies, subjects were investigated with regard to cardiac and vascular function at rest and following intravenous administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, and the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, alpha-methylnoradrenaline, and with regard to local venous vasoconstriction in the dorsal hand vein in situ following infusion of the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, azepexol. alpha2-Adrenoceptor agonists were chosen as vasoconstrictor drugs since alpha2-adrenoceptors couple to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G-proteins and since in-vitro studies have demonstrated enhanced signal transduction of PTX-dependent pathways in the presence of the T-allele. Total peripheral resistance was determined as a parameter of vasoconstrictor tone and heart rate, stroke volume and systolic time intervals for cardiac function. T-allele carriers had a significantly elevated stroke volume and lower total peripheral resistance at baseline. After propranolol, their fall in stroke volume was significantly greater. During alpha-methylnoradrenaline infusion, elevation of total peripheral resistance was not increased relative to controls. Similarly, the constriction response of the dorsal hand vein to azepexol was not different. Our study does not support the idea of increased vasoconstrictor tone in T-allele carriers either at rest or during stimulation of alpha2-adrenoceptors. However, this allele may be associated with elevated cardiac stroke volume.", 
    "61": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor activation on levcromakalim-induced relaxation was investigated in myograph-mounted rat mesenteric arteries. The nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol (at a concentration causing approximately 30% relaxation of methoxamine-induced tone) potentiated relaxation to levcromakalim; higher concentrations exerted no additional effect. The modulatory and relaxant effects of isoproterenol were inhibited by the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol, but the ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel inhibitor glibenclamide did not inhibit relaxations to isoproterenol. The protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate triethylamine (Rp-cAMPS) inhibited the ability of isoproterenol to modulate levcromakalim relaxation. However, neither Rp-cAMPS nor N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-6-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89) (another protein kinase A inhibitor) markedly reduced isoproterenol-induced relaxation, although Rp-cAMPS inhibited relaxations induced by forskolin (an adenylyl cyclase activator). Iberiotoxin (50 nM), an inhibitor of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BK(Ca)), attenuated isoproterenol relaxation. Moreover, both Rp-cAMPS and H-89 caused inhibition of the effects of isoproterenol in the presence of iberiotoxin, whereas glibenclamide did not. We conclude that isoproterenol modulates the actions of levcromakalim through beta(1)-adrenoceptors and protein kinase A, even though K(ATP) channels do not contribute to its relaxant effects. However, the major relaxant mechanism for isoproterenol appears to be protein kinase A-independent activation of BK(Ca), with cyclic AMP-dependent mechanisms only being unmasked when the BK(Ca) mechanism is inhibited. Although direct G protein-mediated activation of BK(Ca) has been demonstrated previously in electrophysiological studies of single smooth muscle cells, this is the first time that such a mechanism has been shown to be functionally important in an intact blood vessel preparation.", 
    "62": "This study tested the hypothesis that increased nitric oxide (NO) inactivation and concurrent peroxynitrite formation is responsible for endothelial dysfunction in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHRSP). In SHRSP, the aortic vasorelaxation to acetylcholine (ACh) was decreased (p < 0.05), but NO production was unchanged. Nitrotyrosine staining, a footprint of peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) formation, was detected. Exposure of SHRSP to a high-salt, high-fat diet (SFD) further exacerbated hypertension and accelerated end-organ disease. A severe endothelial dysfunction [maximal ACh relaxation: 49.8 +/- 2.1 versus 94.5 +/- 1.8% in Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), p < 0.01], increased basal NO production (482 +/- 17 versus 356 +/- 21 nM, p < 0.01), decreased ACh-stimulated NO production (57 +/- 6 versus 112 +/- 6 nM, p < 0.01), extensive inducible NO synthase and nitrotyrosine staining, elevated nitrotyrosine content (21-fold increase over WKY), and a high percentage of cells with DNA damage were observed in the aortic tissues from these animals. Treatment of SHRSP on SFD with carvedilol restored ACh-induced vasorelaxation and NO production, inhibited nitrotyrosine formation, reduced vascular cell DNA damage, and reduced end-organ injury. These data demonstrate that endothelial dysfunction was caused by increased NO inactivation alone (SHRSP) or in combination with decreased NO production from endothelial NO synthase (SHRSP on SFD). Antioxidant treatment with carvedilol exerted significant vascular protective effects, attenuated end-organ damage, and decreased mortality under these conditions.", 
    "63": "We have shown elsewhere that equine-2 influenza virus (EIV; subtype H3N8) induced pronounced cell death in infected cells through apoptosis as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation assay and a combined TUNEL and immunostaining scheme. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of EIV-mediated cytotoxicity on a permissive mammalian epithelial cell line, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. EIV infection increased the cellular levels of oxidative stress and c-Jun/AP-1 protein (which is known to be affected by oxidative stress), as well as its DNA binding activity. Increased production of TGF-beta1, an inducer of c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) activation, was also detected in EIV-infected MDCK cells. It has been reported that TGF-beta may initiate a signaling cascade leading to JNK/SAPK activation. Addition of c-Jun antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), JNK/SAPK inhibitor carvedilol, or TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody effectively blocked c-Jun/AP-1 upregulation and TGF-beta1 production mediated by EIV infection. These treatments also attenuated EIV-induced cytopathogenic effects (CPE) and apoptosis. Our results suggest that a stress-activated pathway is involved in apoptosis mediated by EIV infection. It is likely that EIV infection turns on the JNK/SAPK cascade, which modulates the activity of apoptosis-promoting regulatory factor c-Jun/AP-1 and epithelial growth inhibitory cytokine TGF-beta.", 
    "64": "Inhibition or reversal of ventricular remodelling in heart failure patients is regarded as of prime importance in the treatment of heart failure and in determining long term outcome. Recent studies have demonstrated that the addition of carvedilol to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and other routine heart failure therapy results in a valuable improvement in the clinical status and life expectancy of mild, moderate and severe heart failure patients. ACE inhibitors have become the cornerstone of heart failure therapy. Also, carvedilol in combination with standard therapy (including ACE inhibitors) has demonstrable beneficial effects on left ventricular remodelling. Each new treatment has to be added, this quickly leads to polypharmacy, which may not be necessary and even unwanted in the individual patient, as the pharmacological profile of carvedilol compares favourably to ACE inhibitors, this suggests that it could challenge ACE inhibitors as first-line treatment for heart failure. The CARMEN trial (Carvedilol and ACE-Inhibitor Remodelling Mild Heart Failure EvaluatioN) was designed to compare the effects of carvedilol alone and of carvedilol plus an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) with the effect of an ACE inhibitor alone on different parameters of left ventricular remodelling as well as morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic mild heart failure, thereby allowing conclusions on whether combination therapy may be replaced by the multiple action adrenergic inhibitor carvedilol in the future.",

Drug influences on Doppler-derived parameters from the cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity wave form were evaluated in a randomized, double blind, cross-over, placebo controlled study.

Also, the cerebrovascular resistance index decreased similarly after both drugs (2.26 +/- 0.35 on placebo vs 1.68 +/- 0.42 on perindopril p<0.01 and 1.7 +/- 0.36 on acebutolol p<0.01). The calculated CBF index increased significantly after each drug (25.23 +/- 7.99 on placebo vs 33.98 +/- 11.23 p<0.01 on perindopril and 30.90 +/- 8.04 on acebutolol p<0.01). However, perindopril augmented the CBF index more effectively than acebutolol (p<0.05).", 
    "68": "Among patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension both acebutolol and perindopril beneficially decreased cerebrovascular resistance and increased the CBF index in comparison with placebo. The increase of CBF index was greater after perindopril than acebutolol, which suggests a more significant improvement in cerebral perfusion by perindopril. The non-invasive transcranial Doppler ultrasonography method of CBF velocity measurement may contribute to choosing optimal antihypertensive therapies and to monitor their effect.",

    "72": "The beta-adrenergic antagonist timolol reduces ciliary epithelial secretion in glaucomatous patients. Whether inhibition is mediated by reducing cAMP is unknown. Elemental composition of rabbit ciliary epithelium was studied by electron probe X-ray microanalysis. Volume of cultured bovine pigmented ciliary epithelial (PE) cells was measured by electronic cell sizing; Ca(2+) activity and pH were monitored with fura 2 and 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, respectively. Timolol (10 microM) produced similar K and Cl losses from ciliary epithelia in HCO/CO(2) solution but had no effect in HCO/CO(2)-free solution or in HCO/CO(2) solution containing the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide. Inhibition of Na(+)/H(+) exchange by dimethylamiloride in HCO/CO(2) solution reduced Cl and K comparably to timolol. cAMP did not reverse timolol's effects. Timolol (100 nM, 10 microM) and levobunolol (10 microM) produced cAMP-independent inhibition of the regulatory volume increase (RVI) in PE cells and increased intracellular Ca(2+) and pH. Increasing Ca(2+) with ionomycin also blocked the RVI. The results document a previously unrecognized cAMP-independent transport effect of timolol.

    "73": "Mechanical alternans has been observed in patients with severe congestive heart failure, and the phenomenon is considered to be a terminal sign. Therapeutic strategies for chronic heart failure have significantly developed, but it is uncertain whether patients with mechanical alternans can be effectively treated or not. Seventeen consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were enrolled: 11 were treated with beta-blockers on conventional therapeutic regimens and 6 patients were not indicated for or were unable to continue beta-blockade. Mechanical alternans was detected during cardiac catheterization in the patients under physiologic tachycardia (110 beats/min) and stepwise dobutamine loading. In the initial study, mechanical alternans occurred in 70.6% of the patients: 8 of the 11 being treated with beta-blockers and 4 of the 6 without beta-blockade therapy. In the second study, none of the patients taking beta-blockers showed mechanical alternans under the same protocol; the occurrence of mechanical alternans did not change in the patients who were not being treated with beta-blockers. The left ventricular ejection fraction increased in patients whose mechanical alternans could not be induced during the follow up, but decreased in the patients in whom mechanical alternans was repeatedly inducible. It is concluded that mechanical alternans is associated with the failing myocardium and may be potentially correctable.", 
    "74": "In experimental studies and/or human body surface mapping, the activation-recovery interval (ARI) is used as a parameter to estimate local repolarization. However, it has not been clarified whether the ARI calculated from the intracardiac unipolar electrogram of humans reasonably represents the local effective refractory period (ERP). Measurement of ARIs at multiple ventricular sites can be helpful in assessing the dispersion of ventricular refractoriness of humans, so we examined the relationship between ERP and ARI in the control state and under treatment with dl-sotalol during clinical electrophysiologic studies (EPS). Of 19 patients, an EPS was performed in the control state in 12 and during treatment with dl-sotalol in the other 7. Quadripolar electrode catheters with an interelectrode distance of 5 mm were placed at the right atrium and in the right ventricle. Using atrial pacing, the heart rate was increased incrementally by 10 beats/min, and ERP and ARI were measured for each pacing rate. The ERP at the right ventricle was measured by single extrastimulation between the first and third distal electrodes of the catheter in the right ventricle, and the ARI was calculated from the second distal unipolar electrode of the same catheter as the interval between the minimum derivative of the intrinsic deflection and the maximum derivative of the T wave. In all patients, the unipolar electrogram was stable during the entire EPS, and 83 data points in the control group and 50 in the dl-sotalol group were analyzed. At each pacing rate, the beat-to-beat difference of ARI was less than 10 ms. As the atrial pacing rate increased, the ERP and ARI were progressively shortened, and linear regression analysis revealed an excellent correlation between ERP and ARI. At the same pacing rate, the ERP and ARI in the dl-sotalol group were longer than those in the control group, but no difference was observed in the slope (close to 1.0) and in the intercept of the regression lines between ERP and ARI. In the human ventricle, the ARI calculated from the intracardiac unipolar electrogram represents the local ERP both in the control state and under treatment with dl-sotalol. The ARI can be used as a parameter of local refractoriness and used to study the distribution of refractoriness in the human ventricle.",

Compared to those usually reported in the early postoperative period, this arrhythmia is delayed in onset and is often a cause of re-hospitalization. Post-discharge AF has never been characterized in the literature.", 
    "76": "We retrospectively analyzed post-discharge AF occurring within 30 days of coronary artery bypass graft or of valvular procedures in 376 patients referred to an early postoperative rehabilitation program. To investigate the probability of the persistence of post-discharge AF, we prospectively examined 232 patients who had undergone valvular procedures.", 
    "77": "An arrhythmia was recognized in 61/376 patients (16%), resulted in worsening of the NYHA functional class in 27 (44%) and in life-threatening hemodynamic effects requiring urgent cardioversion in 5 (8%). Events were predicted by the occurrence of postoperative AF (6-fold higher risk), left ventricular hypertrophy, an enlarged left atrium and valvular pathology (3-fold) and by the lack of beta-blocker protection (5-fold). AF persisted in 20/232 (9% of the study population, 18% of patients who had post-discharge AF) and had a relevant impact on the patient's clinical status. Predictors of events were older age, an enlarged left atrium and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "78": "Post-discharge AF following open-heart surgery is frequent in patients undergoing valvular procedures and often persists over time. The clinical impact of the arrhythmia is relevant, it might cause re-hospitalizations in many circumstances and, consequently, may have an impact on hospital resources. Events are much less frequent in patients taking beta-blockers than in those who do not, and they can be predicted by simple variables observed in the early stages after surgery.", 
    "79": "A rapid and sensitive high performance, thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method has been developed for the measurement of celiprolol in human plasma and its use in pharmacokinetic studies has been evaluated. Detection and quantitation were performed without using an internal standard. A simple extraction procedure was followed for extracting celiprolol from plasma and a known amount of the extract was spotted on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates using a Camag Linomat IV autosampler. Celiprolol was quantitated using a Camag TLC Scanner 3. The average recovery of authentic analytes (20 to 200 ng/mL) added to plasma was 72.06 +/- 2.8% and the lowest amount of celiprolol that could be detected was 10 ng/mL. The method provides a direct estimate of the amount of celiprolol present in plasma. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 2 marketed preparations have also been determined after oral administration to 12 healthy human volunteers.", 
    "80": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been reported to modulate bone metabolism both in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ET-1 on inorganic phosphate (Pi) transport in osteoblast-like cells, which is now considered to be important for the initiation of bone matrix calcification. ET-1 time- and dose-dependently stimulated Na-dependent Pi transport in mouse calvaria-derived osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells, and this effect was dependent on transcriptional and translational process. Kinetic analysis indicated that the change in Pi transport activity induced by ET-1 was due to alteration in the number of the Pi transporter. BQ123, a selective antagonist for ET(A) receptor, suppressed the ET-1-induced Pi transport, but BQ788, a selective antagonist for ET(B) receptor, had no effect. The inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by phospholipase C (PLC) partially attenuated the Pi transport by ET-1. Propranolol, which inhibits phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, also suppressed ET-1-induced Pi transport. On the contrary, indomethacin did not affect the stimulatory effect of Pi transport by ET-1. Calphostin C, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, significantly blunted the stimulatory effect of ET-1 on Pi transport. Combined effect of PMA and ET-1 on Pi transport was not additive. Pi transport induced by ET-1 was also suppressed in PKC down-regulated cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells, ET-1 acting through ET receptor links to a stimulation of Pi transport via activation of PKC through both phosphoinositide and phosphatidylcholine hydrolyses.",

Co-infusion with enalaprilat decreased +dP/dt to 26 +/- 12% and Ecs to -2 +/- 17% above baseline (p < 0.05), and this anti-adrenergic effect was reversed by L-NMMA co-infusion (p < 0.05 vs. enalaprilat). In addition, intracoronary enalaprilat reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), but not left ventricular end-diastolic volume, consistent with increased left ventricular distensibility. Infusion with L-NMMA before enalaprilat in patients with DCM (n = 5) prevented the reduction in +dP/dt, Ecs and LVEDP. In patients with normal left ventricular function (n = 5), enalaprilat did not inhibit contractility or reduce LVEDP during dobutamine infusion.",

Exercise-induced changes in LV dimensions and LV peak systolic pressures were similar in both groups. However, the maximum first derivative of LV pressure was greater and the LV pressure half-time was shorter in group II than in group I at a similar peak exercise heart rate. The biphasic changes in LVEDP disappeared by pretreatment with propranolol. The LV hypertrophy scores were higher in group I than in group II.

    "99": "Left ventricular beta AR density and affinity were identical in brain-dead and sham-operated animals. Labetalol-treated pigs exhibited a significant decrease of Bmax and an increase of Kd as compared with brain-dead pigs. Bmax decrease was due to the persistence of labetalol in the membrane preparations. Increased Kd was too low to be biologically significant. Therefore, beta AR number and affinity can be considered as unchanged after adrenergic blockade with labetalol.",

The results are as follows. L-glu induced a significant increase of artery pressure (AP), perfusion pressure of muscles (PPm) and perfusion pressure of kidney (PPk), which was markedly attenuated by prior injection of phentolamine or propranolol to the bilateral pressor area. These results indicate that the vascular roles of CPA were mainly mediated via alpha- and/or beta-receptors.",

(1) Taurine microinjected into AHA decreased blood pressure markedly. (2) The depressor response of taurine in AHA could be antagonized by propranolol, but not by phentolamine. (3) After microinjection of taurine into AHA, the content of norepinephrine in hypothalamus increased significantly. The above results suggest that taurine in AHA attenuates blood pressure by increasing the content of norepinephrine, probably mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "103": "Celiprolol enantiomer was resolved directly by using normal-phase HPLC with urea derivative as chiral stationary phase (CSP). The resolution condition was optimized by varying the content of ethanol and 1, 2-dichloroethane in the mobile phase. The effects of the two components on stereoselectivity factor (alpha) and stereochemical resolution factor (Rs) are demonstrated. The higher the 1,2-dichloroethane content the faster the elution of solute is, but the lower the values of alpha and Rs are. For a suitable content of ethanol in mobile phase, the maximum resolution factor (Rs) can be obtained. Ethanol is a strong proton-donor and proton-acceptor. Its strong hydrogen bond interaction with solute and CSP is important for the direct resolution. In order to obtain both the low retention time and a high Rs, we chose the mobile phase with n-hexane:1,2-dichloroethane:ethanol (V/V/V) = 77:21:2. Other organic modifiers such as methanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol and acetonitrile were also used. Iso-propanol, methanol and n-butanol showed longer retention time and lower values of alpha and Rs than ethanol. Acetonitrile is only a proton-acceptor and has weak hydrogen bond interaction with solute and CSP, so resolution wasn't obtained. The elution order of enantiomer was also discussed. We thought that the hydrogen bond interaction between solute and the (S)-val component of CSP may mainly control the chiral recognition. The interaction strength is different between (R)- and (S)-celiprolol, so the celiprolol enantiomer was resolved. And the elution order is S, R.", 
    "104": "In September, 2000, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health called an early halt to the amlodipine arm of the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) trial after careful deliberation by an independent data and safety monitoring board. An interim analysis of the AASK at 3 years revealed a renoprotective effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril as compared to the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP-CCB) amlodipine in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. This differential effect was independent of the blood pressure (BP) levels reached and was evident in proteinuric patients and suggestive in patients with baseline proteinuria < 300 mg/d, but was not conclusive. The AASK trial data suggest that DHP-CCBs should be used cautiously in the presence of mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Judgment should be reserved for the use of other CCBs, such as verapamil or diltiazem, since these are fundamentally different CCBs with the potential for a different impact on hypertensive nephrosclerosis. The blinded observation period for AASK will be completed at the end of September, 2001, at which time additional, clinically useful information is expected to become available.

    "105": "Beta blockers are frequently used to treat hypertension because of their well established safety and efficacy. Large clinical trials yield a 12%--20% decline in cardiovascular end points in hypertensive patients treated with beta blockers. However, beta blockers account for only 11% of antihypertensive prescriptions, and their use appears to be declining as newer agents with fewer side effects become available. The metabolic side effects of beta blockers have recently been examined. While they may raise triglycerides, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, induce glucose intolerance, and possibly unmask diabetes, these effects have not been shown to impact their clinical effectiveness. For hypertension, beta blockers are still recommended as first-line therapy in many patients, particularly those at high risk for cardiovascular disease. They are also indicated for other cardiovascular disorders, such as congestive heart failure and postmyocardial infarction, in which mortality reductions exceed that seen with hypertension treatment in patients without cardiovascular complications.

    "106": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of doxazosin in the treatment of hypertensive patients who are being treated on another antihypertensive drug. The open-labeled, noncomparative, multicenter study was carried out in 2363 male hypertensive outpatients > 40 years of age, under reasonable control with single antihypertensive drug treatment (diastolic blood pressure < 95 mm Hg), and diagnosed with benign prostatic hypertrophy. Doxazosin was started at a dose of 1 mg/day, which was increased at 2-week intervals to 2 mg/day and 4 mg/day. The study lasted 14 weeks. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured at each of the visits. At baseline and after 14 weeks of treatment, prostatism symptoms were quantified with the International Prostate Symptom Score and quality of life was determined with the American Urology Association Committee Guidelines. Adverse effects were recorded. At the fourth visit, when the patients were taking 4 mg of doxazosin, the blood pressure reduction was 10.7 +/- 3/7.1 +/- 7.1 mm Hg. The decrease in diastolic blood pressure was significantly more marked in patients treated with beta blockers than in patients on calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. For systolic blood pressure, decreases were larger in patients treated with diuretics than with calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Prostatism symptoms decreased from 15 +/- 5.8 points to 7.9 +/- 4.3 points (p is less than 0.001) and quality of life improved. Tolerability was good, with only a 4.4% cumulative incidence of adverse effects related to doxazosin. The patients who experienced adverse effects were older and their final blood pressures were lower. The results of this open-label study suggest that the addition of doxazosin to another antihypertensive drug in hypertensive patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy is well tolerated and leads to a reduction in prostatic symptoms. The additional beneficial effects on blood pressure suggest that the use of doxazosin may provide a rational approach to this category of patients.(c)2001 Le Jacq Communications, Inc.",

NEB, BUC, MET and CAR did not not exert an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) as determined by measurements of force development in forskolin (0.3 micromol l(-1)) pre-treated left ventricular trabeculae, nor by measuring adenylate cyclase activity in forskolin (0.3 micromol l(-1))-stimulated assays (crude membranes). This also holds true for radioligand binding assays with or without guanine nucleotide guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). 5. Although all studied beta-adrenoceptor antagonists lack intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), they differ in the beta(1)-selectivity as well as in their direct negative inotropic action. These differences as well as the mode of extracardiac action may have an impact on outcome of patients treated with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.",

He was treated with 131I and b-adrenergic blocking agents and scheduled for follow-up as an outpatient. Two weeks later, the patient presented in acute respiratory failure. The neurology team was reconsulted because of suspected myasthenic crisis.

Neurological examination was unremarkable with no evidence of muscle weakness. Serum creatine kinase level was slightly increased. Echocardiography showed severe left ventricular dysfunction. Coronary angiography showed no abnormalities. Left ventriculography showed generalized hypokinesis and left ventricular ejection fraction was 28%. Dystrophin immunostaining of the skeletal muscle biopsy specimen showed a mosaic pattern. The dystrophin negative fibers were scattered among positive fibers.

    "117": "Remodeling of large and small arteries in hypertension contributes to elevation of blood pressure, and may participate in the complications of hypertension. Large arteries exhibit increased lumen size, thickened media with increased collagen deposition, and decreased compliance, which contributes to raised systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure. In small (resistance) arteries smooth muscle cells are restructured around a smaller lumen, without true hypertrophy, particularly in milder forms of hypertension, whereas in severe forms and in secondary hypertension hypertrophic remodeling has been reported. Endothelial dysfunction occurs in many patients, with prevalence similar to that of left ventricular hypertrophy. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor subtype 1 antagonists and long-acting calcium channel blockers has corrected changes in large and small arteries in hypertensive patients. Treatment with beta-blockers did not modify either structure or function of small arteries. Improved outcomes were reported in clinical trials with drugs that exert vascular protective effects, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor subtype 1 antagonists, as well as with those that do not appear to improve vascular structure or function. Recent trials suggest that these different drugs may provide similar benefits essentially through blood pressure lowering, although some minor differences between drugs have been noted. For example, the alpha-blocker doxasozin has been associated with worse outcomes (heart failure) than have diuretics. That hard end-point clinical trials have not demonstrated any advantages of agents with vasculoprotective properties may relate in part to the relatively short duration of some of these multicenter trials (3-5 years). Another contributing factor may be the low number of events with each drug class in the longer trials. Thus, current evidence does not support the rational expectation that vasculoprotective antihypertensive agents will be associated with better outcomes in hypertensive patients, possibly because of limitations of these trials.",

    "121": "A total of 75 patients were switched from amlodipine (n = 25), felodipine (n = 25), and nifedipine-GITS (n = 25) to amlodipine/benazepril. Twenty-eight of the 75 patients (37%) were taking either a beta-blocker or a diuretic in addition to the high-dose calcium channel blocker prior to the switch. Blood pressure control, side effects and the cost of the therapeutic interchange were evaluated in the year following the therapeutic interchange.", 
    "122": "Sixty-six of the 75 (88%) patients were successfully switched with maintenance of blood pressure control and without the development of new dose-limiting side effects. Reasons for treatment failure after the therapeutic interchange included loss of blood pressure control in five patients and the development of new dose-limiting side effects in four patients. These side effects included cough in three patients and rash in one patient. After accounting for differences in drug acquisition cost and costs related to the switch (clinic and emergency room and laboratory tests), a cost savings of $16030 for all 75 patients was realised in the first year. The per patient-per year cost savings was $214.",

    "124": "The store-operated pathway for Ca(2+) entry was studied in individual mouse pancreatic beta-cells by measuring the cytoplasmic concentrations of Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) and Mn(2+) ([Mn(2+)](i)) with the fluorescent indicator fura-2. Influx through the store-operated pathway was initially shut off by pre-exposure to 20 mM glucose, which maximally stimulates intracellular Ca(2+) sequestration. To avoid interference with voltage-dependent Ca(2+) entry the cells were hyperpolarized with diazoxide and the channel blocker methoxyverapamil was present. Activation of the store-operated pathway in response to Ca(2+) depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum was estimated from the sustained elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) or from the rate of increase in [Mn(2+)](i) due to influx of these extracellular ions. Increasing concentrations of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonist carbachol or the sarco(endo)plasmatic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) cause gradual activation of the store-operated pathway. In addition, the carbachol- and CPA-induced influx of Mn(2+) depended on store filling in a graded manner. The store-operated influx of Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) was inhibited by Gd(3+) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate but neither of these agents discriminated between store-operated and voltage-dependent entry. The finely tuned regulation of the store-operated mechanisms in the beta-cell has direct implications for the control of membrane potential and insulin secretion.", 
    "125": "The effect of formoterol, alone and in combination with budesonide, upon tumour necrosis factor-alpha stimulated (10 ng x mL(-1)) human bronchial epithelial cells was investigated. Addition of formoterol (> or = 10(-10) M) reduced granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) levels, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, by 40-50% and increased interleukin (IL)-8 levels by approximately 50%. The effects of formoterol were long lasting (23 h). Budesonide (10(-8) M) reduced the amounts of both cytokines (GM-CSF and IL-8) by 40%. Simultaneous addition of formoterol and budesonide reduced GM-CSF levels approximately 75%, while IL-8 levels were decreased approximately 40%, similar to the reduction obtained with budesonide alone. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU486 did not influence the effect of formoterol, suggesting no involvement of the GR. Formoterol rapidly induced an elevation in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which was reduced in the presence of propranolol. In addition, the alterations in cytokine secretion induced by formoterol could be fully blocked by propranolol, demonstrating that these effects are beta2-receptor mediated. In conclusion, the combination of budesonide and formoterol reduces the secretion of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor to basal levels and counteracts the capacity of formoterol alone to induce interleukin-8 production, modulations which may facilitate improved asthma control.", 
    "126": "We have recently shown that continuous coronary perfusion with warm blood enriched with the ultra-short acting beta-blocker Esmolol (ES) improves functional and structural myocardial protection during coronary artery surgery as compared with conventional cardioplegia (CP). The purpose of the present study was to compare both myocardial protection techniques in terms of patient outcome. We retrospectively analyzed the charts of 150 consecutive patients subjected to coronary artery surgery using the ES-technique; 150 patients matched for age, gender, preoperative left ventricular function, history of renal failure, and history of neurological symptoms undergoing surgery with conventional CP during the same time period served as control group. There were no significant differences between both groups with respect to perioperative myocardial infarction rate, need for positive inotropic medication, need for mechanical circulatory support, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of intensive care unit stay, time of mobilization, postoperative renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, neurological symptoms, infections or in-hospital mortality. ES-patients were less frequently readmitted to the intensive care unit (ES: 3/150; 2.2% [95% confidence interval: 0-4.2%] vs. CP: 13/150; 8.7% [4.2-13.2%]; P=0.010) and total hospital stay was shorter (ES: 12.3+/-4.8 days [95% CI: 11.5-13.0] vs CP: 13.5+/-3.8 [12.9-14.1] days; P=0.0013), thus saving 159 patient days on the normal ward. Procedural costs were less for the ES-technique (US$ 60 per patient) as compared to the cardioplegia technique (US$ 120 per patient). These data suggest that myocardial protection using the ES-technique does not improve clinical outcome in patients subjected to routine coronary artery surgery, but may save costs.",

    "132": "The further metabolism of N-desisopropylpropranolol (NDP), a side-chain metabolite of propranolol (PL), was investigated in isolated rat hepatocytes. Propranolol glycol (PGL) was generated from NDP as a major metabolite. Naphtetrazole (NTE), a potent inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), significantly retarded the disappearance of NDP from the incubation medium, suggesting the involvement of MAO in the deamination of NDP to an aldehyde intermediate. In a reaction mixture of rat liver mitochondria and cytosol with NADPH, phenobarbital, a specific inhibitor of aldehyde reductase, and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-NBA), a substrate inhibitor of aldehyde reductase, decreased the formation of PGL from NDP. 4-NBA was a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme responsible for the PGL formation. The optimal pH for the formation of PGL from NDP in the reaction mixture was approximately 8.0. Based on these results, we propose the possibility that, in the rat liver, MAO catalyzes the oxidative deamination of NDP to an aldehyde intermediate and the formed aldehyde intermediate is subsequently reduced to PGL by aldehyde reductase. Furthermore, the enantioselective metabolism of NDP to PGL was examined. In isolated rat hepatocytes, the amount of PGL formed from S-NDP [S(-)-form of NDP] was larger than that of PGL formed from R-NDP [R(+)-form of NDP].", 
    "133": "Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) produces multiple effects in cortical neurons, resulting in the emergence of network activities including epileptiform discharges. The cellular mechanisms underlying such network responses are largely unknown. We examined the properties of group I mGluR-mediated cellular responses in CA3 neurons and attempted to determine their role in the generation of the network activities. Group I mGluR stimulation causes depolarization of hippocampal neurons. This depolarization is primarily mediated by two sets of conductance change: the opening of a voltage-dependent cationic conductance (mediating I(mGluR(V))) and the closing of a voltage-independent (background) K(+) conductance. I(mGluR(V)) was no longer elicited by group I mGluR agonists in the presence of U73122, a phospholipase C (PLC) blocker. Also, the current could not be activated in hippocampal CA3 neurons from PLCbeta1 knock-out mice. In contrast, suppression of PLC signaling did not affect the group I mGluR-mediated suppression of background K(+) conductance. Thus, the suppression of the background K(+) conductance occurred upstream to PLC activation, whereas the generation of I(mGluR(V)) occurred downstream to PLC activation. Group I mGluR agonists normally elicited rhythmic single cell and population burst responses in the CA3 neurons. In the absence of an I(mGluR(V)) response, CA3 neurons in slices prepared from PLCbeta1-/- mutant mice could no longer generate these responses. The results suggest that I(mGluR(V)) expression in CA3 hippocampal neuron is PLCbeta1-dependent and that I(mGluR(V)) plays a necessary role in the generation of rhythmic single cell bursts and synchronized epileptiform discharges in the CA3 region of the hippocampus.", 
    "134": "It has been suggested that losartan, an angiotensin II (A-II) type 1 receptor blocker, may have a pronounced portal pressure reducing effect, far greater than that of propranolol. This randomized controlled trial compared the hemodynamic and renal effects of continued 6-week administration of losartan (n = 25) vs. propranolol (n = 15) in portal hypertensive patients with cirrhosis treated endoscopically after a variceal bleeding episode.",

    "136": "Losartan did not reduce HVPG (-2% +/- 12%, NS) but significantly decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP, -8% +/- 10%, P = 0.001). On the contrary, propranolol significantly reduced HVPG (-10% +/- 11%, P = 0.003) and cardiac output (-16% +/- 12%, P = 0.001) but did not modify MAP (2.5% +/- 10%, NS). Losartan increased A-II levels, reduced aldosterone, and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in Child B patients. Propranolol did not modify renal function. Adverse events related to therapy were mild and similar in both groups.", 
    "137": "Unlike propranolol, long-term losartan administration does not significantly reduce HVPG in patients with cirrhosis treated after a variceal bleeding episode, and it caused hypotension and reduced GFR in patients with moderate liver failure. Therefore, losartan is not an alternative to propranolol in preventing variceal rebleeding.", 
    "138": "N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are small, diffusible signalling molecules, employed by Gram-negative bacteria to coordinate gene expression with cell population density. Recent in vitro findings indicate that AHLs may function as virulence determinants per se, through modification of cytokine production by eukaryotic cells, and by stimulating the relaxation of blood vessels. In the present study, we assessed the influence of AHLs on cardiovascular function in conscious rats, and draw attention to the ability of the N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL), a signal molecule produced by P. aeruginosa, to cause marked bradycardia. This bradycardic effect was blocked by atropine and atenolol, and did not occur in vitro. Furthermore, modification of the acyl side chain length resulted in the loss of activity, whereas removal of the homoserine lactone ring, did not. The bradycardic effect of 3-oxo-C12-HSL was also observed in endotoxaemic animals, albeit attenuated. In normal rats, 3-oxo-C12-HSL caused initial mesenteric and hindquarters vasoconstriction, but only slight, and delayed signs of vasodilatation in the renal and mesenteric vascular beds. Furthermore, administration of 3-oxo-C12-HSL (pre-treatment or 2 h post-treatment) together with LPS, did not modify the established regional haemodynamic effects of the LPS, 6 h after the onset of its infusion. Our observations do not provide any clear evidence for an ability of 3-oxo-C12-HSL to modify the haemodynamic responses to LPS infusion. However, they are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that some of the cardiovascular sequelae of bacterial infection may be modulated by an influence of bacterial quorum sensing signalling molecules on the host.", 
    "139": "The effect of quinapril and nifedipine on platelet aggregation, vascular endothelial function and coagulation system activity, was compared in a parallel-group, investigator-blind study carried out on patients with mild to moderate hypertension but no other diseases or receiving medication which might affect platelet function, vascular endothelium or coagulation. Forty patients (two groups of 20 patients each) and 20 control subjects were recruited. Patients were randomised to receive either quinapril or nifedipine retard and the dose escalated to control hypertension. Platelet aggregation studies were assessed serially and beta-thromboglobulin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), von Willebrand factor (vWF) coagulation factors VIIIc, XII and fibrinogen were measured at the beginning and end of the 12-week period. Blood pressure was adequately controlled in all patients in both groups. Platelet function was impaired in certain parameters (slope of the reaction with ADP and collagen and maximum aggregation with collagen) in the patient group compared to controls before treatment and this improved in patients on quinapril but not on nifedipine; likewise beta-thromboglobulin was higher in the patient group and fell significantly in the quinapril group but not those on nifedipine. Measurements of endothelial function and coagulation were normal before treatment and showed no alteration during the study, except in the expected fall in plasma ACE in the quinapril group. The results indicate that the ACE inhibitor, quinapril, has a beneficial effect on platelet function unlike the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine.", 
    "140": "The epididymal portion of the rat vas deferens produced prostaglandins (PG) E(2), F(2alpha)and 6-keto F(1alpha). Electrical stimulation (ES, 0.1 Hz, 1 ms) increased such production by 100%, and similar results were obtained in the presence of 1.0 microM bradykinin (Bk). When both stimuli were applied simultaneously, the increases in PG production were 1100% for PGE(2), 800% for PGF(2alpha)and 400% for PG6-keto F(1alpha). Prazosin abolished the effect of ES on PG production. A selective Bk B(2)-receptor antagonist abolished the increase in PG production induced by Bk, both in non-stimulated and in ES tissues. Bk (1.0 microM) elicited contractile responses in non-stimulated as well as in ES tissues, responses that were not modified in the presence of 10 microM indomethacin. In conclusion, the effects of Bk on prostaglandin production appears to depend on the activation of B(2) receptors, while the increase in prostaglandin release induced by ES, and the effects observed with both stimuli simultaneously, should be mediated by the release of noradrenaline and the subsequent activation of alpha(1) adrenoceptors.", 
    "141": "A sensitive and stereoselective high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for the determination of the enantiomers of metoprolol (R- and S-) and the diastereoisomers of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (IIA, IIB) in plasma is reported. Chromatography involved direct separation of enantiomers using a Chirobiotic T bonded phase column (250 x 4.6 mm) and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-methanol-methylene chloride-glacial acetic acid-triethylamine (56:30:14:2:2, v/v). Solid-phase extraction using silica bonded with ethyl group (C2) was used to extract the compounds of interest from plasma and atenolol was used as the internal standard. The column effluent was monitored using fluorescence detection with excitation and emission wavelengths of 225 and 310 nm, respectively. S-Metoprolol, R-metoprolol, IIB and IIA eluted at about 5.9, 6.7, 7.3 and 8.2 min without any interfering peaks. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 0.5 to 100 ng/ml for each isomer of metoprolol and 1 to 100 ng/ml for each isomer of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (IIA & IIB). The mean intra-run accuracies were in the range of 96.2 to 114% for R-metoprolol, 94.0 to 111% for S-metoprolol, 90.2 to 110% for IIA, and 94.6 to 106% for IIB. The mean intra-run precisions were all in the range of 2.2 to 12.0% for R-metoprolol, 2.1 to 11.1% for S-metoprolol, 1.9 to 14.5% for IIA, and 3.2 to 11.0% for IIB. The lowest level of quantitation for the enantiomers of metoprolol was 0.5 ng/ml and 1.0 ng/ml for alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (IIA and IIB). The absolute recoveries for each analyte was > or = 95%. The validated method accurately quantitated the enantiomers of parent drug and metabolite after a single dose of an extended release metoprolol formulation.", 
    "142": "A large variety of drugs is available for treatment of hypertension. Moreover, many randomised controlled trials with clinically relevant endpoints (morbidity, mortality, quality of life) do exist in the cardiovascular field, providing for sufficient evidence to choose the appropriate agent in most circumstances. For diuretics and betablockers a large body of evidence in terms of beneficial effects on outcome does exist, for ACE-inhibitors in some special indications only. These drugs are therefore recommended as first-line treatments. For calcium-channel blockers (with the exception of isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly) and AT1-receptor-antagonists the results of endpoint-studies are still awaited. These results will have to be considered for revised versions of currently available guidelines.", 
    "143": "The antiarrhythmic agent propafenone and its primary electropharmacologically active metabolite, 5-hydroxypropafenone, are known inhibitors of cardiac myocyte repolarizing currents. We recently documented potent propafenone inhibition of the transient outward potassium current (Ito) in human atrial myocytes from patients in the newborn and infant age range. In the current study we characterized ventricular Ito inhibition by propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone in neonatal myocytes enzymatically isolated from 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in ventricular myocytes kept in primary culture for 1-4 days, we observed comparably potent Ito inhibition by both agents, yielding 50% maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 2.1 +/- 0.5 and 1.5 +/- 0.2 microM for propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone, respectively. Ito blockade by both of these agents was time, concentration, and voltage dependent, but use independent. There was no drug effect on steady-state voltage dependence of Ito inactivation, or on the time course of Ito recovery from inactivation. These findings are consistent with an open channel-blocking mechanism as suggested by other models. We conclude that both propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone are potent Ito inhibitors in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, with potencies exceeding those demonstrated for propafenone in adult rat ventricular myocytes or in human atrial myocytes from patients of all ages.", 
    "144": "Cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) show exaggerated growth compared with cells from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Calcium antagonists have recently been reported to have an in vivo antiproliferative effect on hypertensive cardiovascular organs. We investigated the effects of the calcium antagonist cilnidipine that blocks both L- and N-type calcium channels on the growth of VSMC from SHR. Cilnidipine (1 and 10 microM) significantly inhibited basal DNA synthesis in VSMC from both rat strains; the inhibition was significantly larger in VSMC from SHR than in cells from WKY rats, and was significantly greater than effects of nifedipine. Cilnidipine (1 microM) significantly inhibited serum-stimulated DNA synthesis in VSMC from both rat strains. The inhibition was more marked in VSMC from SHR than in cells from WKY rats. Angiotensin II, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA, and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate dose-dependently increased DNA synthesis in VSMC from SHR but not in cells from WKY rats. Cilnidipine (1 microM) significantly suppressed this increase in DNA synthesis in VSMC from SHR. Expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor-beta1, and PDGF A-chain mRNAs was markedly greater in VSMC from SHR than in cells from WKY rats. Cilnidipine (1 microM) significantly inhibited the expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA in VSMC from SHR but not in cells from WKY rats. These findings suggest that cilnidipine exerts its antiproliferative effects through the inhibition of DNA synthesis induced by growth-promoting factors and by inhibiting the expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA in VSMC from SHR.", 
    "145": "We examined the effects of beta-blockers on the associations between heart rate and number of premature ventricular beats (PVBs) and on heart rate variability and myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary heart disease. After 2 weeks of run-in placebo treatment, 18 patients with coronary artery disease were randomized to a 7-day treatment with either propranolol (40 mg) three times a day or placebo. During run-in and after 7 days of treatment, patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring and exercise tests. We analyzed the 24-hour Holter recordings with customized software that computes the correlation between heart rate and occurrence of PVBs. We also computed spectral measures of heart rate variability on the same recordings. Propranolol caused a significant decrease in the log-transformed total number of PVBs recorded over 24 hours and during the day. The number of PVBs was much lower during the night than during the day both after placebo and after propranolol. There were no differences between the two treatments. During the day, there was a positive correlation between heart rate and the number of PVBs in all 18 patients. The mean correlation coefficients between heart rate and number of PVBs increased significantly after propranolol treatment both during the 24-hour monitoring (p < 0.05) and during the day (p < 0.05). The night-recorded correlation coefficients between heart rate and number of PVBs were not significantly different in the placebo versus propranolol group. Propranolol significantly increased the total power during the day. Placebo caused a significant decrease in the low-frequency band (LF) and a significant increase in the high-frequency band (HF) during the night compared with the day. During the day, propranolol significantly reduced LF power and increased HF power, with respect to placebo. After propranolol treatment, the values of LF and HF power during the day were comparable to those recorded at night. The LF/HF ratio decreased significantly after propranolol treatment with respect to placebo in the day and became similar to that recorded during sleep. Propranolol significantly reduced heart rate and systolic blood pressure at rest and at peak exercise and reduced signs of myocardial ischemia. Propranolol administration reduces PVBs in patients with coronary artery disease and severe ventricular arrhythmias possibly through an improvement of cardiac autonomic regulation and through anti-ischemic effects, antiarrhythmic effects, or both.", 
    "146": "These studies were designed to determine the consequences of constitutive overexpression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in the heart. Induction of ODC is known to occur in response to agents that induce cardiac hypertrophy. However, it is not known whether high ODC levels are sufficient for the development of a hypertrophic phenotype. Transgenic mice were generated with cardiac-specific expression of a stable ODC protein using the alpha-myosin heavy-chain promoter. Founder lines with >1000-fold overexpression of ODC in the heart were established, resulting in a 50-fold overaccumulation of putrescine, 4-fold elevation in spermidine, a slight increase in spermine and accumulation of large amounts of cadaverine compared with littermate controls. Despite these significant alterations in polyamines, myocardial hypertrophy, as measured by ratio of heart to body weight, did not develop, although atrial natriuretic factor RNA was slightly elevated in transgenic ventricles. However, stimulation of beta-adrenergic signalling by isoproterenol resulted in severe hypertrophy and even death in ODC-overexpressing mice without further altering polyamine levels, compared with only a mild hypertrophy in littermates. When beta1-adrenergic stimulation was blocked by simultaneous treatment with isoproterenol and the beta1 antagonist atenolol, a significant, although reduced, hypertrophy was still present in the hearts of transgenic mice, suggesting that both beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors contribute to the hypertrophic phenotype. Therefore these mice provide a model to study the in vivo co-operativity between high ODC activity and activation of other pathways leading to hypertrophy in the heart.", 
    "147": "The aims of the present study were to establish if myocardial ischemia/reperfusion is associated with altered eNOS activity and if myocardial eNOS detection depends on its activity. We determined detectable eNOS in (1) myocardium of isolated perfused rat hearts subjected to either global or regional ischemia and (2) in left ventricular biopsies from patients undergoing two different methods of myocardial protection (i.e., intermittent cold blood cardioplegia and continuous coronary perfusion with warm, beta-blocker-enriched blood) during coronary artery surgery. NOS detection was performed by NADPH-d staining and three eNOS-antibodies against different eNOS epitopes. In addition, activity dependent alteration of detectable eNOS was proofed by bradykinin treatment for 2 to 10 min. Ischemic and receptor mediated eNOS activation increased NADPH-d reactivity and eNOS immunoreaction as measured by antibodies against either amino acids of a central bovine eNOS domain or the human eNOS N-terminal end. In contrast, the antibody against the human eNOS C-terminal end exhibited no alteration of eNOS immunoreaction. The transient eNOS activation was associated with increased cGMP content. In human myocardium subjected to ischemia during cardiac surgery we found that early reperfusion increases eNOS activity. These data demonstrate a strong association between myocardial ischemia/reperfusion and increased eNOS activity as measured by immunocytochemical staining against specific eNOS epitopes. It appears that eNOS activation and subsequent NO release may act as a regulatory system to counter balance the potentially deleterious effects of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion.", 
    "148": "We have investigated in rabbits whether overfeeding and weight gain, which lead to hypertension, are associated with changes in circadian rhythm of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, and whether the sympathetic nervous system is involved in these changes. In adult male rabbits, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored by telemetry 22 h a day. Daily MAP and HR records were divided into four equal intervals and used to calculate day-night differences. After a 1-week control period, animals were switched to a high-fat (HFD) ad libitum diet for 8 weeks. HFD increased whole day MAP and HR, and rapidly abolished the normal diurnal rhythm of MAP and HR. Since HFD abolished the nocturnal dip in MAP, but had little effect on daytime values, the loss of dipping appears to account for most of the hypertension in this model of obesity. In a separate set of rabbits, alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade (terazosin + propranolol) prevented HFD-induced hypertension and attenuated the increase in HR by more than half. Adrenergic blockade alone abolished the diurnal rhythm of MAP, chiefly by preventing daytime elevation of MAP. The addition of HFD ad libitum did not further modify daily MAP or its circadian pattern. The diurnal rhythm of HR was relatively unaffected by alpha + beta blockade alone, but was abolished after switching to HFD. In conclusion, rabbits fed an HFD ad libitum develop hypertension and tachycardia associated with a loss of the normal diurnal rhythm of MAP and HR. The hypertension appears to be sympathetically mediated.",

    "150": "A 40-year-old Hispanic woman with well-controlled chronic hypertension and diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus was treated with valsartan and atenolol until pregnancy was diagnosed at 24 weeks' gestation. An ultrasound examination revealed normal fetal growth and anatomy but anhydramnios (amniotic fluid index 0). Valsartan was discontinued, and amniotic fluid volume normalized within two weeks. Intrauterine fetal death was documented at 33 weeks' gestation. Labor was induced, with the delivery of a stillbom female fetus with small, hypoplastic lungs (weight 41% of expected) and an extremely small, 148-g placenta (weight 48% of the 10th percentile for gestational age).", 
    "151": "The use of valsartan, a selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARA), in human pregnancy has not been reported, but this class of agents would be expected to cause fetal toxicity similar to that observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. This toxicity includes reduced perfusion of the fetal kidneys, resulting in anuria, oligohydramnios, and subsequent pulmonary hypoplasia. The small hypoplastic lungs and very small placenta were probably a consequence of valsartan and atenolol combination therapy.", 
    "152": "Resolution of anhydramnios after discontinuing valsartan is evidence for ARA-induced fetal toxicity. The pulmonary hypoplasia observed in the stillbom infant was a direct result of the severe oligohydramnios. The cause of fetal death nine weeks later is uncertain, but because the woman's chronic hypertension and diabetes were well controlled, we believe the primary cause was chronic placental insufficiency resulting from the previous combination of valsartan and atenolol.",

    "154": "We conducted an economic evaluation alongside the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program, which consisted of four concurrent, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials; the mean duration of follow-up across these four trials was 6.5 months (the program was terminated prematurely based on a finding of a 65% mortality benefit). Using data from these trials, we examined the cost-effectiveness of carvedilol in terms of the estimated cost per death averted among patients randomized to such therapy versus those receiving placebo. Attention was focused on the cost of carvediol therapy plus the cost of cardiovascular-related inpatient care. Costs of care were estimated by combining infomation on healthcare utilization from the clinical trials with secondary sources of cost data.",

As mortality alsowas lower among carvedilol patients, the estimated cost per death averted was negative. The probability that carvedilol would both increase survival and decrease costs of cardiovascular-related care over a 6.5-month period was estimated to be 0.98.",
