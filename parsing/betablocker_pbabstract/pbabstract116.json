However, data concerning use of beta-blockers in patients with acute heart failure are limited, and only recently have emerged to help guide therapy. In this review, we provide an overview of when to stop and when to start beta-blockers in patients with acute heart failure.", 
    "1": "Although the benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in selected patients with heart failure is well established, its effect on mortality in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV patients remains unclear. Our study evaluated the effect of CRT on urgent transplant-free survival in NYHA class IV patients treated with CRT, compared with medication-only treatment.",

No significant differences were found between the groups in left ventricular diastolic diameter (71 +/- 6 vs. 73 +/- 9 mm), left ventricular systolic diameter (58 +/- 7 vs. 61 +/- 11 mm), and left ventricular ejection fraction (23 +/- 5 vs. 22 +/- 6%). Mean follow-up was 13.2 +/- 9.5 months for the CRT group and 17.3 +/- 11.6 months for the OPT group. Time to all-cause death or urgent transplantation [hazard ratios (HR), 1.29; 95% CI: 0.59-2.83; P = 0.52] or to cardiovascular death or urgent transplantation (HR, 1.53; 95% CI: 0.64-3.67; P = 0.34) was not reduced significantly in patients treated with CRT.",

RA subjects were matched to non-RA subjects on age, gender, history of coronary artery bypass grafting, date of PCI, and interventional cardiologist. We compared cardiac risk factors, presentation, treatment, and outcomes.",

Seventy-four percent of subjects with RA compared with 67% of those without RA presented with an acute coronary syndrome before PCI (P = 0.48). All subjects in this cohort undergoing PCI had at least 1 stenosis in a major epicardial vessel and similar percentages of subjects with RA (44%) and without RA (40%) had multi-vessel CAD (P = 0.66). The administration of cardiac medications both at PCI and at hospital discharge was not different among subjects with RA compared with matched non-RA subjects.",

The current standard of practice for the use of perioperative beta-blockade in preoperative patients is outlined in the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. Findings differ as to the risk and benefit of using beta-blockers perioperatively to reduce cardiac events. Further research is needed to support the ACC/AHA recommendations. It is essential that the decision to use beta-blockade be made on a case-by-case basis with adequate risk stratification as part of the criteria.",

A body of evidence support the notion that KATP channels interact with endogenous opioids. Whether H2S-induced analgesia involves opioid receptors is unknown.", 
    "15": "The perception of painful sensation induced by colorectal distension (CRD) in conscious rats was measured by assessing the abdominal withdrawal reflex. The contribution of opioid receptors to H2S-induced analgesia was investigated by administering rats with selective mu, kappa and delta opioid receptor antagonists and antisenses. To investigate whether H2S causes mu opioid receptor (MOR) transactivation, the neuronal like cells SKNMCs were challenged with H2S in the presence of MOR agonist (DAMGO) or antagonist (CTAP). MOR activation and phosphorylation, its association to beta arrestin and internalization were measured.", 
    "16": "H2S exerted a potent analgesic effects on CRD-induced pain. H2S-induced analgesia required the activation of the opioid system. By pharmacological and molecular analyses, a robust inhibition of H2S-induced analgesia was observed in response to central administration of CTAP and MOR antisense, while kappa and delta receptors were less involved. H2S caused MOR transactivation and internalization in SKNMCs by a mechanism that required AKT phosphorylation. MOR transactivation was inhibited by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, and glibenclamide, a KATP channels blocker.",

The interface fluid resolved and the cornea and flap became clear. Slit-lamp examination identified a small area of epithelial ingrowth recurrence, which has remained stable for 3 years. Patient 2 was successfully retreated with epithelial debridement followed by fibrin tissue adhesive application. Five months after debridement and fibrin tissue adhesive, no recurrence of epithelial ingrowth or interface fluid accumulation was noted.",

    "22": "Commercial spaceflight participants on orbital flights typically are older than career astronauts and they often have medical conditions that have not been studied at high g or in microgravity. This is a case report of a 56-yr-old orbital spaceflight participant with essential tremor and frequent premature ventricular contractions that occurred at rates up to 7000 per day. Before training and spaceflight, he was required to complete extensive clinical investigations to demonstrate normal cardiac structures and the absence of cardiac pathology. The evaluation included signal averaged ECG, transthoracic stress echocardiography, exercise tolerance tests, electrophysiological studies, cardiac MRI, electron beam CT, Holter monitoring, and overnight oximetry. While no cardiac pathology was demonstrated, the Russian medical team required that the PVCs be treated prior to training and spaceflight. For the initial flight, a selective beta-1 receptor beta blocker was used and for the second a calcium channel blocker was used in combination with a nonselective beta blocker for tremor control. Analogue environment testing assured that this combination of medications was compatible.", 
    "23": "The spaceflight participant's PVCs were incompletely suppressed with a low-dose selective beta-1 blocker, but were well suppressed by a calcium channel blocker. He tolerated in-flight periodic use of a nonselective beta blocker in combination with a calcium channel blocker. In-flight ECG and blood pressure monitoring results were normal, and an ECG obtained midmission and on landing day showed successful PVC suppression. He did not have any cardiac difficulty with launch, on-orbit operations, entry, or recovery", 
    "24": "The sympathetic nervous system is involved in regulating various cardiovascular parameters including heart rate (HR) and HR variability. Aberrant sympathetic nervous system expression may result in elevated HR or decreased HR variability, and both are independent risk factors for development of cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. Epidemiologic studies have established that impaired HR control is linked to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. One successful way of decreasing HR and cardiovascular mortality has been by utilizing beta-blockers, because their ability to alter cell signaling at the receptor level has been shown to mitigate the pathogenic effects of sympathetic nervous system hyperactivation. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that beta-blocker-mediated HR control improvements are associated with decreased mortality in postinfarct and heart failure patients. Although improved HR control benefits have yet to be established in hypertension, both traditional and vasodilating beta-blockers exert positive HR control effects in this patient population. However, differences exist between traditional and vasodilating beta-blockers; the latter reduce peripheral vascular resistance and exert neutral or positive effects on important metabolic parameters. Clinical evidence suggests that attainment of HR control is an important treatment objective for patients with cardiovascular conditions, and vasodilating beta-blocker efficacy may aid in accomplishing improved outcomes.", 
    "25": "Hypertension is the number one diagnosis made by primary care physicians, placing them in a unique position to prescribe the antihypertensive agent best suited to the individual patient. In individuals with diabetes mellitus, blood pressure (BP) levels>130/80 mmHg confer an even higher risk for cardiovascular and renal disease, and these patients will benefit from aggressive antihypertensive treatment using a combination of agents. beta-blockers are playing an increasingly important role in the management of hypertension in high-risk patients. beta-blockers are a heterogeneous class of agents, and this review presents the differences between beta-blockers and provides evidence-based protocols to assist in understanding dose equivalence in the selection of an optimal regimen in patients with complex needs. The clinical benefits provided by beta-blockers are only effective if patients adhere to medication treatment long term. beta-blockers with proven efficacy, once-daily dosing, and lower side effect profiles may become instrumental in the treatment of hypertensive diabetic and nondiabetic patients.", 
    "26": "Use of combination therapy whether fixed dose or separate pill combinations is becoming more prevalent. Physicians are not routinely trained in using combinations of different antihypertensive medicines.", 
    "27": "Recent outcome trials as well as smaller studies document that meaningful combinations of pharmacologically additive agents help achieve blood pressure (BP) goals faster and reduce outcomes. Clinical trials demonstrate that drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system, that is, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, combined with either calcium antagonists or thiazide-like diuretics and used as first-line antihypertensive therapy in patients whose BP is more than 20/10 mmHg above goal achieve BP goal faster than sequential monotherapy. Additionally, certain combinations may provide better cardiovascular outcomes than other combinations. Lastly, combination therapy has a clear role in helping to reduce cardiovascular and renal risk, when used.", 
    "28": "This review provides an update of current evidence regarding the associations of BP control with use of combination antihypertensive therapy to achieve BP goals. A rationale for initial single pill and fixed-dose combination therapy is reviewed. Only one trial with cardiovascular outcome has been performed using a fixed-dose combination and this revealed differences from other trials, including the greatest number of people achieving goal BP and difference in outcomes based on combination used.", 
    "29": "P-Glycoprotein (PGP) is nonuniformly distributed along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; however, the data regarding regional differences in PGP function in the intestine are controversial. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of PGP efflux in region-specific absorption of talinolol from the GI tract in rats. Plasma talinolol concentrations were measured after several modes of administration, including high (40 mg/kg) and low (4 mg/kg) dose levels, to different segments of the GI tract (stomach versus colon), and codosing with PGP inhibitors (verapamil or cyclosporine). The bioavailability (F) of talinolol after high-dose administration to the stomach was significantly greater than that achieved by the low dose (approximately 18 versus 2%). Coadministration of low-dose talinolol with cyclosporine increased F by approximately 5-fold (p < 0.01). For the high dose, codosing with PGP inhibitors did not increase the extent of absorption. Talinolol demonstrated poor colonic absorption that was significantly increased by coadministration with cyclosporine (F = 0.76 versus 8.1%). Oral verapamil significantly increased systemic clearance and the steady state volume of distribution of intravenous talinolol. A semiphysiological model was developed that successfully captured the pharmacokinetic profiles of talinolol after various modes of administration. PGP-mediated efflux appears to be a major factor responsible for GI region-specific absorption of talinolol in rats, and gastroretentive dosage forms may provide an advantage in the delivery of talinolol and PGP substrate drugs.", 
    "30": "National guidelines recommend a team model of care to facilitate adherence to evidence-based practices; however, previous studies suggesting benefit may have limited generalizability. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of advanced practice nurse (APN) and physician assistant (PA) staffing on the delivery of guideline-recommended therapies for outpatients with heart failure (HF). The Registry to Improve the Use of Evidence-Based Heart Failure Therapies in the Outpatient Setting (IMPROVE HF), a prospective cohort study, enrolled 167 cardiology practices to characterize outpatient management of 15,381 patients with chronic HF and left ventricular ejection fractions < or =35%. Adherence to guideline-recommended HF therapies was recorded, and the presence of APN and PA staffing was assessed by survey. Multivariate models identified contributions to the delivery of guideline-recommended HF therapies. Of cardiology outpatient practices, 66.0% had APNs and PAs. Practices with 0, >0 to <2, and > or =2.0 APN and PA staffing had similar adherence to the 7 guideline-recommended HF therapies. After adjustment, staffing with > or =2 APNs or PAs was associated with greater conformity with 2 of 7 measures (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy and delivery of HF education, p < or =0.01 for both) and similar conformity to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy, beta-blocker therapy, aldosterone antagonist therapy, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, and cardiac resynchronization therapy. In conclusion, staffing with APNs and PAs varied in cardiology outpatient practices. Compared to no APNs or PAs, > or =2.0 APNs or PAs per cardiology practice was associated with the greater use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy and delivery of HF education and equivalent use of drug and cardiac resynchronization therapies.", 
    "31": "A 27-day-old male infant with diffuse hemangiomatosis of the skin and liver was treated with oral propranolol at a dosage of 2 mg/kg per day. Five months later skin and liver hemangiomas regressed almost completely. After 160 days of onset of propranolol, the patient presented with seizures on waking up. Laboratory examinations showed blood glucose of 15 mmol (n.v. 50-110) and increased ketone bodies. Propranolol was recommenced at a lower dosage the day after the crisis and then withdrawn when the baby was aged ten months. Hypoglycemia is the most frequent and insidious side effect of propranolol, mainly occurring in circumstances with diminished oral intake. Although the risk appears small, increased vigilance for hypoglycemia in children on chronic propranolol treatment who have decreased caloric intake for any reason seems prudent.", 
    "32": "Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) occurs as a complication of cirrhotic or non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Although the pathogenesis of PHG is not completely understood, evidence suggests that the key factor for the development of PHG is portal hypertension. PHG is clinically important because it may cause acute (and even) massive or insidious, blood loss. The diagnosis of PHG is (only) made endoscopically; it is most often characterized by an abnormality of the gastric mucosa described as a mosaic-like pattern resembling 'snake-skin', with or without red spots and the endoscopic pattern is key its diagnosis. Unfortunately, standardization of the endoscopic diagnostic criteria for PHG is poor and consensus is generally lacking, resulting in a wide range of reported prevalence. Pharmacological therapies, presumably reducing portal pressure and gastric blood flow, have been used to treat acute bleeding; propanolol, a non-selective beta-blocker (24-480 mg/day), has been used most frequently. Endoscopic treatment for PHG bleeding plays a small, if any, role in the treatment of PHG. TIPS and shunt surgery have not been extensively analysed as a treatment for acute or chronic PHG bleeding, but they appear to lessen the severity of PHG. Secondary prophylaxis of PHG bleeding with non-selective beta-blockers is recommended. There is not enough evidence to support the use of beta-blockers in primary prophylaxis of PHG bleeding, even in cases of severe PHG (however, non-selective beta-blockers are recommended if varices are present). Further studies are needed to clarify the role of PHG in suspected chronic gastrointestinal bleeding.",

During follow-up, 43 patients (35%) experienced rebleeding, 34 (27.5%) died and 10 (8%) were transplanted. Follow-up beta-blocker dose (HR 0.993, 95% CI 0.987-0.998, P=0.027) and alcohol abstinence (HR 0.324, 95% CI 0.152-0.691, P=0.004) were independent rebleeding predictors.

The method is based on the measurements of effective molecular diffusion coefficient of the ligand during Poiseuille flow through a long (approximately 25 m), thin (0.254 mm +/- 0.05 mm ID) capillary with and without the selector. The data are analyzed using the Taylor dispersion theory. Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and cyclodextrin (CD) were taken as model selectors. We have tested our method on the following selector-ligand complexes: BSA with warfarin, propranolol, noscapine, salicylic acid, and riboflavin, and cyclodextrin with 4-nitrophenol. The results are in good agreement with data from the literature and with our own results obtained within classical chromatography. This method works equally well for uncharged and charged compounds.", 
    "38": "Multiple trials over the past several years have examined indications for angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the treatment of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, both acutely after myocardial infarction and in chronic heart failure (CHF). However, the effects of telmisartan, an ARB in rats with CHF after experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) have not yet been analyzed. CHF was elicited in Lewis rats by immunization with cardiac myosin, and 28 days after immunization, the surviving Lewis rats were divided into two groups and treated with either telmisartan (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) or vehicle. After 4 weeks of treatment, we analyzed the effects of telmisartan on cardiac function, proinflammatory cytokines and cardiac remodeling in EAM rats. Myocardial functional parameters measured by hemodynamic and echocardiographic studies were significantly improved by telmisartan treatment in rats with CHF compared with those of vehicle-treated rats with CHF. Telmisartan significantly reduced levels of cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy and its marker molecules (LV mRNA expressions of transforming growth factor beta 1, collagen I and III, and atrial natriuretic peptide), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor--gamma protein expression compared with those of vehicle-treated rats. CHF-induced increases in myocardial mRNA expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and -9) were also suppressed by the treatment with telmisartan. Moreover, the plasma level of angiotensin-II was significantly elevated in telmisartan-treated rats. Our results indicate that telmisartan treatment significantly improved LV function and ameliorated the progression of cardiac remodeling in rats with CHF after EAM.",

Outcome measures were percentage availability, price ratios to international reference prices and number of day's wages needed by the lowest-paid unskilled government worker to purchase one month of chronic treatment. Patient prices were adjusted for inflation and purchasing power, procurement prices only for inflation. Data were analyzed for both generic and originator brand products and the public and private sector and summarized by World Bank Income Groups.", 
    "41": "For all measures, there was great variability across surveys. The overall availability of cardiovascular medicines was poor (mean 26.3% in public sector, 57.3% private sector). Procurement prices were very competitive in some countries, whereas others consistently paid high prices. Patient prices were generally substantially higher than international references prices; some countries, however, performed well. Chronic treatment with anti-hypertensive medication cost more than one day's wages in many cases. In particular when monotherapy is insufficient, treatment became unaffordable.",

    "49": "Although in hypertension beta-adrenoreceptor activation promotes the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to pump dysfunction, the use of beta-blockers is controversial. As adrenergic activation may mediate adverse effects on the heart through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, we evaluated the effects of the aldosterone receptor blocker, spironolactone (SPIRO), on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced changes in left ventricular cavity size and pump function and the determinants thereof in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). ISO administered for 4.5 months resulted in increases in left ventricular dimensions and a decrease in pump function in SHR but not in normotensive rats, changes that, without affecting blood pressure, were abolished by SPIRO. In SHR, 4-5 days of ISO increased myocardial matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity, which was associated with matrix metalloproteinase-2 but not tissue inhibitor of MMP expression; persisted at 4.5 months; and was prevented by SPIRO. Moreover, after 4.5 months, ISO increased non-cross-linked myocardial collagen concentrations in SHR, which was abolished by SPIRO. Although after 4.5 months, ISO was not associated with increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, an early (4-5 days) ISO-induced apoptotic effect was noted, which was prevented by SPIRO. Hence, aldosterone receptor blockade may be sufficient to prevent those adverse effects of beta-adrenoreceptor activation responsible for the transition from concentric cardiac hypertrophy to pump dysfunction in hypertension.", 
    "50": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a major role in blood pressure regulation and is thus an important therapeutic target in the management of hypertension. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which interrupt RAAS overactivity by blocking a specific receptor that mediates the pathogenic activity of angiotensin II, represent a major addition to the clinician's armamentarium for the management of hypertension. A solid body of clinical evidence demonstrates that ARBs are effective in the management of hypertension as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Although comparable to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other major classes of antihypertensive agents in the treatment of hypertension, the favorable tolerability profile of ARBs make them an attractive alternative for many patients. Recent evidence suggests that treatment persistence with ARB therapy during a 12-month period is typically higher than with other antihypertensive classes, a finding perhaps driven by fewer treatment-limiting side effects. The combination of clinical efficacy and tolerability should render ARBs as a major treatment alternative for hypertension.",

Practitioners can minimize the risk of interactions by using an aspirating syringe, which reduces the likelihood of the local anaesthetic being administered directly into a blood vessel. Adhering to the dosage recommendations in the product literature will also minimize the risk. This paper will explore the clinical significance of potential interactions between dental local anaesthetic preparations used in primary care and other medicines as listed in the BNF and SmPCs.These are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.",

We wondered about the types of injury seen and about the cardiac risks factors that predispose to worse outcomes in these patients. Our hypothesis is that significant cardiac comorbidity is associated with adverse trauma outcomes.", 
    "58": "We reviewed 10,144 trauma admissions to the University of Kentucky during a 5-year period (2002-2007) in patients 21 years or older. The types and extent of injuries were characterized, and risk factors for poor outcome were assessed. Propensity analysis assessed variable interaction and adjusted for important multivariate cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "59": "Of the 10,144 adult trauma patients, there was adequate cardiovascular history before emergency treatment in 5,971 patients (58.9%). Of the 700 trauma deaths, 236 (33.7%) had adequate medical history to allow accurate assessment of cardiovascular disease. Significant multivariate predictors of trauma-related death included older age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.938), injury severity score (OR = 0.893 per unit score), major burn (OR = 5.907), assault with a weapon (OR = 3.205), systolic blood pressure divided by Glasgow coma score (OR = 0.958 per score unit), and female (OR = 1.629). In the cohort of 236 deaths with adequate medical history, severe head and chest injuries caused death in 187 patients (79.2%). Significant propensity-adjusted cardiovascular risks of trauma death included preinjury warfarin use (OR = 2.309, p = 0.001), congestive heart failure (CHF) (OR = 2.060, p = 0.011), and preinjury beta-blocker use (OR = 2.62, p = 0.001). The highest mortality rates occurred in patients with combinations of these cardiovascular risk factors. For example, patients on warfarin with CHF had a 26.3% mortality rate, whereas patients on warfarin and beta-blocker had a 27.3% mortality rate.",

The goal of this article is to review the prevalence of PVD and its major impact upon prognosis in patients with known CAD and in turn to review the impact of CAD upon the prognosis of patients with PVD. This review will also highlight issues related to the peri-operative evaluation and management of patients going to vascular surgery, including medical optimization as well as the performance and timing of coronary revascularization.",

We analysed 846 VT occurred in 100 patients. The ATP success rate was 84%. Upon classification of the events into three groups (IDE-BB = 0, IDE-BB < 55, and IDE-BB > or = 55), the frequency of effective ATP increased with the IDE-BB: 75 vs. 83 vs. 92% (P < 0.001).

Western-blot analysis followed by quantitative analysis of respective immunoblot data for both the proteins revealed that photo-induced expression of each protein was stimulated by cholinergic (both nicotinic and muscarinic) agonists and a dopaminergic antagonist, inhibited by both cholinergic antagonists and a dopaminergic agonist, but not affected by any agonists or antagonists of adrenergic (alpha(1), alpha(2) and beta(1)) receptors. Moreover, expression of each protein was stimulated by voltage gated L type calcium channel blocker, adenylate cyclase inhibitor and phosphodiesterase activator; but suppressed by the activators of both calcium channel and adenylate cyclase, and by phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Collectively, we report for the first time that both cholinergic and dopaminergic signals play an important, though antagonistic, role in the photo-induced expression of photoreceptor proteins in the fish pineal through activation of a signal transduction pathway in which both calcium and cAMP may act as the intracellular messengers.", 
    "70": "The beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers) constitute a class of drugs that have well-established roles in treatments of various cardiovascular diseases. Despite a 50 year history, there are two clinically important subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors (betaARs) called beta(1)AR and beta(2)AR that still are promising drug targets. Our study maps the interactions between nebivolol-one of the most efficient beta-blocking agents-and the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor by simulating two optical isomers of nebivolol: ssss-nebivolol and srrr-nebivolol. The srrr-configuration binds preferentially to beta(1)AR and beta(2)AR. The ssss-form has much lower binding affinity to both of them. Our work indicates that water is a very important component of the binding site of the beta(2)AR receptor. We found that the higher stereoselectivity of the srrr-configuration is due to interactions with water molecules, which extensively hydrate the binding site of beta(2)AR. By lowering the energy of binding, water enhanced the affinity of the srrr-form to beta(2)AR. We also address the problem of beta(1)AR/beta(2)AR selectivity. At higher concentrations, all beta-blocking agents lose their specificity and bind nonselectively, causing many adverse effects. Our simulations indicate that PHE194, TYR308, and ILE309 of the beta(2)AR and the corresponding residues of the beta(1)AR receptor may be important determinants of beta(1)AR versus beta(2)AR selectivity.",

Pharmacogenetic customization of HF therapy may provide an important opportunity to improve the treatment of HF. Common genetic variations exist in genes related to most classes of HF drugs, many of which have known functional consequences for or established relationships with drug response.

This hypothesis stemmed mainly from rodent studies showing that propranolol interferes with the reconsolidation of Pavlovian fear conditioning (FC). However, subsequent investigations in humans have produced controversial evidence about the effect of propranolol on fear memories and an effect on PTSD symptomatology has yet to be reported. Thus, it remains to be established whether propranolol interferes with the reconsolidation of fear memories at large. To address this question, we tested the effect of systemic injections of propranolol administered before or after the retrieval of an inhibitory avoidance (IA) memory elicited with different footshock intensities. In parallel, the same treatment was tested on the reconsolidation of Pavlovian FC. Propranolol showed no effect on the reconsolidation of IA, although the pre-retrieval administration resulted in a significant retrieval impairment. This impairment was transient, and memory returned to control levels at later times. In agreement with previous studies, we found that systemic administration of propranolol disrupts the reconsolidation of Pavlovian FC and that its injection following a retrieval elicited by cue exposure also interferes with the reconsolidation of contextual FC. Hence, propranolol disrupts the reconsolidation of Pavlovian FC, but has no effect on the reconsolidation of IA. The results indicate that the efficacy of systemic administration of propranolol in disrupting the reconsolidation of fear memories is limited.",

    "113": "In this paper we present the flow research of the development of receptor bronchial system in the first month of extra-uterine life up to the sixth month of development, performed by tracking the reactions of isolated tracheal rings in acetylcholine (Ach), propranolol (P), histamine (Hist), and prostaglandin (PGF2-alfa) in concentrations of: 10-4, 10-3, 10-2 and 10-1 mol/dm3; in piglets of ages: 1 month, 2 months, 4 months and 6 months. Results shows that Ach causes reaction of smooth muscles from the first month of extra-uterine life (p < 0.01) and that Propranolol (P) significantly emphasizes the effect of Ach (p > 0.1), while histamine and PGF2-alpha do not cause constriction (histamine up to 4 months of age, PGF2-alfa up to 6 months of extra-uterine life). This shows that cholinergic and adrenergic system in piglet airways is developed during intrauterine life and reaction can be registered in the first month of extra-uterine life, while other receptor systems are developed in later periods of extra-uterine life. This suggests that lack of reaction of tracheal smooth musculature (TSM) comes as a result of sufficient non-maturity of mast cells from which chemical mediators, with local functioning, are released.",

Median follow-up period was 85 days. Anti-cTnI was measured using an experimental assay (Abbott Diagnostics) and is expressed as a relative value unit (RVU) in relation to the mean value of a low-level control sample. Anti-cTnI values in CHF patients were also compared with measurements taken in a normal reference population of 300 healthy individuals (50% male). Cardiac troponin I and NT-proBNP levels were measured using routine assays (Architect Abbott Diagnostics and Roche Diagnostics). Median anti-cTnI was 0.53 and 0.56 RVU in healthy and CHF subjects, respectively (P = n.s.), and increased significantly to 0.67 RVU (P < 0.001) after beta-blocker titration.

However, it has been suggested that hepatic atrial pressure gradient (HAPG)--the gradient between wedge hepatic venous pressure and right atrial pressure (RAP)--might better reflect variceal hemodynamics. The aim of this study was to (1) investigate whether HAPG with nonselective beta-blockers correlates with prognosis in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension at baseline and during treatment; (2) compare the prognostic value of HAPG with that of HVPG; and (3) investigate the agreement between portoatrial gradient (PAG) and portocaval gradient (PCG) in patients with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). We included 154 cirrhotic patients with varices with a complete hemodynamic study at baseline and on chronic treatment for primary (n = 71) or secondary (n = 83) prophylaxis for bleeding and 99 patients with TIPS. All patients were followed for up to 2 years; portal hypertensive-related bleeding and bleeding-free survival were analyzed. HVPG was equal or lower than HAPG in all patients (-3.2 mm Hg; P < 0.001). Agreement between HAPG and HVPG was modest, especially in patients with increased intra-abdominal pressure. One hundred two patients were HVPG nonresponders and 52 patients were HVPG responders to nonselective beta-blockers, whereas 101 patients were HAPG nonresponders and 53 patients were HAPG responders (k = 0.610). HVPG response revealed an excellent predictive value for bleeding risk and bleeding-free survival; HAPG did not. In our TIPS patients, 20% had a PCG < or =12 mm Hg and a PAG >12 mm Hg, which may have induced unnecessary overdilation of the TIPS.",

We investigated the association between predischarge cTnT elevation and coexistent pathophysiology in patients with decompensated HF. Plasma cTnT levels were determined before discharge in 170 patients with decompensated HF. We divided the patients into a group that was positive for cTnT [cTnT(+) group, n = 40] and a group that was negative for cTnT [cTnT(-) group, n = 130]. Multivariate analysis showed that use of beta-blocker therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.236, P = 0.003), an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level (OR = 3.731, P = 0.006), a high brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level (OR = 3.570, P = 0.007), diabetes (OR = 3.090, P = 0.018), and anemia (OR = 2.330, P = 0.047) were independently associated with cTnT positivity. During a mean follow-up period of 441 days after discharge, total mortality (P < 0.001), cardiac death (P < 0.001), and exacerbation of HF requiring hospitalization (P = 0.007) were all more common in the cTnT(+) group than in the cTnT(-) group. Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that cTnT positivity was an independent predictor of total mortality (hazard ratio = 5.008, P = 0.004) in an age- and gender-matched model. Elevation of cTnT during convalescence was associated with lack of beta-blocker therapy, a high hsCRP level at discharge, a high BNP level at discharge, diabetes, and anemia, and a worse clinical outcome in patients with decompensated HF.", 
    "126": "We have previously shown that a newly developed calpain inhibitor, SNJ-1945 (SNJ), with good aqueous solubility prevents the heart from KCl arrest-reperfusion injury associated with the impairment of total Ca(2+) handling by inhibiting the proteolysis of alpha-fodrin as a cardioplegia. The aim of the present study was to investigate certain actions of this calpain inhibitor, SNJ, on left ventricular (LV) mechanical work and energetics in cross-circulated excised rat hearts undergoing blood perfusion with 40 microM SNJ. Mean end-systolic pressure at midrange LV volume and systolic pressure-volume area (PVA) at mLVV (a total mechanical energy/beat) were significantly increased by SNJ perfusion (P < 0.01). Mean myocardial oxygen consumption per beat (Vo(2)) intercepts (Vo(2) for the total Ca(2+) handling in excitation-contraction coupling and basal metabolism) of Vo(2)-PVA linear relations were significantly increased (P < 0.01) with unchanged mean slopes of Vo(2)-PVA linear relations. Pretreatment with the selective beta(1)-blocker landiolol (10 microM) blocked these effects of SNJ perfusion. There were no significant differences in mean basal metabolic oxygen consumption among normal, 40 microM SNJ, and 10 microM landiolol + 40 microM SNJ groups. Our results indicate that water-soluble SNJ exerted positive actions on mechanical work and energetics mediated via beta(1)-adrenergic receptors associated with the enhancement of total Ca(2+) handling in excitation-contraction coupling and with unchanged contractile efficiency. In clinical settings, this pharmacological action of SNJ is beneficial as an additive agent for cardioplegia.", 
    "127": "This work aims at studying the possible alteration of renal renin secretion after human ischemic stroke and correlating it to the post stroke neurological and renal function alterations using angiotensin II type 1(AT1) receptor blocker (ARB), candesartan, and beta 1 adrenoreceptor blocker atenolol, which inhibits renin secretion, in Wistar rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. Methods . This study comprised 21 patients with cerebral ischemic stroke. Seventeen normal persons were used for comparison. Recumbent and standing plasma renin activity (PRA), reflex plasma renin sensitivity, plasminogen activator inhibitor and creatinine clearance (Ccr) were estimated at admission and two weeks later. Moreover, 60 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups SHAM and ischemic. Each of the two groups was further subdivided into three subgroups, non-treated, atenolol treated, and candesartan treated. In all rats, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), heart rate (HR), neurobehavioral evaluation, Ccr, PRA, and infarct size were measured. Results . Together with the significant deterioration of the neurological score, focal cerebral ischemia in rats resulted in increased PRA and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In ischemic stroke patients, GFR was significantly decreased at admission and two weeks later, PRA increased at admission and two weeks later while plasma renin reflex secretion sensitivity had decreased significantly at admission relative to controls, but it increased significantly 2 weeks later. Atenolol caused significant improvement of the neurobehavioral score and renal function and decrease infarct size of rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia whereas candesartan caused significant improvement of the neurobehavioral score and decreased infarct size with no significant change in GFR. Neither atenolol nor candesartan caused significant change in MAP, SBP, DBP, PP and HR Conclusion . (1) Ischemic stroke seems to be associated with a postischemic increase of the plasma renin secretion, which may increase the infarct size in the brain and may induce acute renal insufficiency. (2) This study confirms that Atenolol and ARBs could benefit ischemic stroke patients without altering blood pressure.", 
    "128": "Symptom-limited exercise test with peak oxygen consumption measurement possesses a strong prognostic value in chronic heart failure. This parameter allowing notably the selection of patients for heart transplant. Nevertheless, sub maximal effort and beta blocker therapy tend to limit its prognostic value. The ventilatory response evaluated by the minute ventilation - carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2) linear regression slope during effort is generally considered to be a significant predictor of mortality and hospitalizations in HF population. An enhanced ventilatory response is correlated with a poorer prognostic. In addition, this parameter is not influenced by the intensity of the effort neither by the betablocker therapy. But, physiological determinants are not clear yet. Aim of our study is to confirm the important place of the (VE/VCO2) slope in HF patient's evaluation.",

In the present study we determined the effect of propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on long-term potentiation (LTP) induced in vivo in rat occipital cortex by tetanizing stimulation of corpus callosum and observed a dose-dependent inhibition of LTP. We further administered propranolol through mini-osmotic pumps during 3 days, and observed the performance of rats in a complex operant conditioning learning paradigm and assessed the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the occipital cortex. Propranolol exposure depressed both the number of reinforced responses in the operant conditioning task and BDNF expression in occipital cortex. Taken together, our results suggest that propranolol impairs memory formation by inhibiting cortical LTP induction and associated BDNF expression.",

Carvedilol treatment was associated with enhancement of RV fetal gene reactivation, increased protein kinase G (PKG) activity, and a reduction in capillary rarefaction and fibrosis. Metoprolol had similar but less pronounced effects in the SU5416 and hypoxia model. Cardioprotective effects were noted of both carvedilol and metoprolol in the monocrotaline model.

Mean blood pressure (MBP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal blood flow (RBF), and renal sodium excretion (UNaV) were measured. In study 1, MBP rose by 12.8%, UNaV decreased by 68%, and GFR and RBF also fell (p < 0.001 for all). In study 2, GFR and RBF fell as in study 1, but the rise in MBP and the fall in UNaV were accentuated [+20.0%, analysis of variance (ANOVA), p < 0.02 versus study 1 and -80.0%, p < 0.05, respectively].

Icatibant accentuated AngII-induced changes in MBP and UNaV. Previous AT1R blockade prevented any systemic and renal effects of AngII, but significant changes in MBP and UNaV still followed AngII plus icatibant even after AT1R blockade.

Images of ocular fundus were captured with an original high-resolution digital fundus camera in vivo. The retinal vascular responses were evaluated by measuring diameter of retinal blood vessels contained in the digital images. Both systemic blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were continuously recorded. The beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist CL316243 (0.3-10 microg/kg/min, i.v.) increased diameter of retinal arterioles (at 10 microg/kg/min, a 31% increase) and decreased mean blood pressure (at 10 microg/kg/min, a 21% decrease) in a dose-dependent manner. CL316243 produced a small but significant increase in HR (at 10 microg/kg/min, a 9% increase). Both SR59230A (1 mg/kg, i.v.) and L-748337 (50 microg/kg, i.v.), beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonists, significantly prevented CL316243-induced retinal vasodilator responses. Similar observations were made with another beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL37344. The beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol also increased diameter of retinal arterioles (at 10 microg/kg/min, a 43% increase), whereas the drug produced greater decrease in blood pressure (at 10 microg/kg/min, a 46% decrease) and increase in HR (at 10 microg/kg/min, a 16% increase), compared with beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists. The retinal vasodilator responses to CL316243 and BRL37344 observed under blockade of beta(1)/beta(2)-adrenoceptors with propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.v. bolus followed by 100 microg/kg/min infusion) were unaffected 2 weeks after induction of diabetes by the combination of streptozotocin treatment and D: -glucose feeding. On the other hand, the vasodilator responses to salbutamol of retinal arterioles were significantly reduced in diabetic rats. These results suggest that stimulation of beta(3)-adrenoceptors causes the vasodilation of retinal arterioles in vivo and the vasodilator responses are unaffected at the early stage of diabetes.",

Our goal was to determine the effect of propranolol on functional connectivity in ASD during a verbal decision making task as compared to nadolol, thereby accounting for the potential spurious fMRI effects due to peripheral hemodynamic effects of propranolol. Ten ASD subjects underwent fMRI scans after administration of placebo, propranolol or nadolol, while performing a phonological decision making task.

Cynomolgus monkey CYP2D17, highly homologous to human CYP2D6, has been identified and characterized. Here, we report characterization of another CYP2D, CYP2D44, identified in cynomolgus monkey liver. The CYP2D44 cDNA contained an open reading frame of 497 amino acids sharing high sequence identity (87-93%) with other primate CYP2Ds. CYP2D44 mRNA was predominantly expressed in liver, similar to CYP2D17 mRNA. CYP2D17 and CYP2D44 form a gene cluster in the genome, similar to human CYP2Ds. Metabolic assays of the CYP2D17 and CYP2D44 proteins heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli indicated that CYP2D44 metabolized human CYP2D6 substrates, bufuralol and dextromethorphan (bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation) but to a lesser extent than CYP2D17. Kinetic analysis of dextromethorphan metabolism indicated that the apparent K(m) and V(max) of CYP2D17 and CYP2D44 catalyzed O-demethylation were similar, and, the V(max) values of CYP2D17 and CYP2D44 catalyzed N-demethylation (which human CYP2D6 catalyzes much less effectively) were similar, but the apparent K(m) of the CYP2D44 reaction was higher. Western blot analysis showed that CYP2D proteins were expressed in cynomolgus and rhesus monkey liver as well as in human and marmoset liver. Similar to CYP2D6, CYP2D44 copy number varied among the eight cynomolgus monkeys and four rhesus monkeys used in this study. These results indicated that CYP2D44, together with CYP2D17, had functional characteristics similar to those of human CYP2D6 but measurably differed in dextromethorphan N-demethylation, suggesting its importance for CYP2D-dependent drug metabolism in macaque.",

A model of myocardial infarction (MI) by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery was established. Propranolol was given 1 h or daily for 3 months, whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were used to measure I(to). Kv4.2 and PKA levels were analyzed by Western blot and cAMP level was determined by radioimmunoassay. The results showed that propranolol decreased the incidence of arrhythmias induced by acute ischemia and mortality in 3 month MI rats. Propranolol restored the diminished I(to) density and Kv4.2 protein in MI hearts. In addition, neonatal cardiomyocyte pretreatment with propranolol or administrated after hypoxia can resume I(to) density. cAMP/PKA was enhanced in acute MI, the reason of decreased Kv4.2 expression. Treatment with propranolol prevented the increased cAMP/PKA in 1 h MI, whereas propranolol had little effect on decreased cAMP/PKA in 3 months MI.

BNP, BMI, and other biomarkers were measured at baseline and 3 months. A total of 131 subjects, 56 with coronary heart disease (CHD) and 75 at high risk, with > or =3 CHD risk factors and/or diabetes mellitus, were enrolled. At 3 months, the mean BMI had decreased (34.4 to 31.7 kg/m(2), p <0.001), BNP had increased (median 18 to 28 pg/ml, p <0.001), and low-density lipoprotein, C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B (all p <0.002), and angina frequency (p = 0.017) and severity (p = 0.052) had decreased. The subjects' physical limitations had decreased and their physical functioning had improved (all p <0.001). The percentage of change in BNP was inversely associated with the percentage of change in insulin (r = -0.339, p = 0.005, n = 63 nondiabetics). It was also inversely associated with the percentage of change in BMI (r = -0.28, p = 0.002, n = 116), and this association remained significant (p = 0.029) in multiple regression analyses controlling for age, gender, CHD, diabetes mellitus, percentage of change in lifestyle index, and beta-blocker use. The metabolic changes related to adipose tissue lipolysis could explain these findings. In conclusion, BNP increased in subjects experiencing weight loss while following a lifestyle intervention, and angina pectoris, physical limitations, and other CHD risk factors decreased. Therefore, in this context, increasing BNP might not indicate worsening disease or a worsening prognosis. Thus, the proposed use of BNP in monitoring disease progression should take into account changes in the BMI during the same period.",

    "203": "Isoflurane-anesthetized rats submitted to a closed head injury (CHI) display a significant decrease of their blood glutamate levels. Having demonstrated that a decrease of blood L-glutamate (glutamate) causes an increase of the driving force for a spontaneous brain-to-blood glutamate efflux, and consequently affords brain neuroprotection, we investigated here the possible mechanisms which can affect blood glutamate levels. Reasoning that the spontaneous decrease of blood glutamate levels post CHI could be part of a stress response, we observed that the stress involved in tail artery catheterization under isoflurane anesthesia does not affect blood glutamate levels. Investigating in na\u00efve rats the stress effectors, we found that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) significantly decreased blood glutamate levels. Pretreatment with antalarmine (a selective type-1 CRF receptor antagonist) occludes the CRF-mediated decrease in blood glutamate levels. In contrast, the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) did not affect blood glutamate levels. Investigating the effectors of the sympathetic/adrenomedullary system, we observed that in na\u00efve rats, adrenaline but not noradrenaline decreased blood glutamate levels. Confirming the role of adrenaline, propranolol pretreatment (a non-selective beta-antagonist) prevented the spontaneous decrease of blood glutamate observed post CHI. On the strength of these results, we further observed that isoproterenol (a beta(1/2)-selective adrenoreceptor agonist) produced a marked sustained decrease in blood glutamate levels. These results suggest that stress induces a decrease of blood glutamate levels partly via the activation of peripheral CRF receptors and the activation of the beta-adrenoreceptors. We propose that this newly identified component of the stress response could be a peripherally mediated defense mechanism of the injured brain against the deleterious effects of excess glutamate.", 
    "204": "It is well established that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) has anticonvulsant properties. However, NE may also have proconvulsant properties under some conditions, both in animal epilepsy models and in humans. This paper examines the hypothesis that this neurotransmitter has proconvulsant properties, where much of the pharmaceutical evidence comes from rodent models. In assessing the elevated NE epilepsy hypothesis, the following seven lines of evidence are examined that include studies of: (1) antidepressants that raise the level of NE; (2) clonidine and other alpha 2 adrenergic agonist drugs that lower the level of NE; (3) prazosin and other drugs that affect alpha adrenoceptors; (4) propranolol and other drugs that affect beta adrenoceptors; (5) pheochromocytoma, which is a rare cancer of the adrenal glands that can boost NE levels; (6) comorbidity of epilepsy with bipolar disorder, hypertension, and obesity, where all four conditions may involve elevated NE; and (7) psychological stress, which is associated with increased release of NE. The body of evidence supporting the NE proconvulsant hypothesis is consistent with the notion that elevated, endogenous noradrenergic transmission is an etiological factor in some cases of epilepsy.", 
    "205": "The beneficial effects of beta-blocker therapy on the clinical outcomes of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) are attributed to the improvement in ejection fraction (EF) and left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling. Previous studies only reported the beta-blocker therapy-induced improvement of diastolic function accompanied by the increase in EF in HFREF patients. This retrospective study aimed to elucidate whether beta-blocker therapy improves diastolic function even without an increase in EF. Out of the consecutive 11,830 echocardiographic reports, HFREF patients without an increase in EF following long-term beta-blocker therapy comprised the study subjects (n=19). During the mean follow-up of 17 months, beta-blocker therapy significantly decreased peak mitral E-wave velocity (70\u00b125-50\u00b118 cm/s, p<0.01) and ratio of peak mitral E- to A-wave velocities (E/A ratio) (1.4\u00b10.8-0.9\u00b10.4, p<0.05), prolonged deceleration time of the mitral E-wave velocity (DcT) (167\u00b154-206\u00b161 ms, p<0.05), and improved New York Heart Association functional class (2.3\u00b10.7-1.8\u00b10.4, p<0.01) without changes in LV volume. Because DcT and E/A ratio are well known to correlate with LV filling pressures in patients with reduced EF, our results indicate a reduction in LV filling pressures without changes in LV volume, suggesting a reduction in LV stiffness. Thus, long-term beta-blocker therapy is likely to improve diastolic function even without a concomitant increase in EF in HFREF patients, which may be also responsible for the beta-blocker-induced improvement of their symptoms of heart failure.",

Invasive measurements of CO were performed using indicator dilution technique (CO(I)) and simultaneous measurements of CO were recorded with the Finometer (CO(F)). In six patients, measurements of CO were performed with invasive technique and the Finometer both before and after beta-blockade using 80 mg of propranolol and the changes in CO (DeltaCO(I) and DeltaCO(F) respectively) were calculated to evaluate the Finometers ability to detect relative changes in CO. Mean CO(I) was 6.1 +/- 1.6 [3.9;9.7] l min(-1) (mean +/- SD [range]) compared to mean CO(F) of 7.2 +/- 2.3 [3.1;11.9] l min(-1). There was a mean difference between CO(F) and CO(I) of 1.0 +/- 1.8 [-2.1;4.0] l min(-1) and 95% confidence interval of [0.2;1.8], P<0.001.
