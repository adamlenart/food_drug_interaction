To study the influence of the formulation factors (amount of coating polymer, plasticizer percentage in film coating and swelling agent percentage in mini-tablets), a Box-Behnken design of experiment (DoE) was used. To evaluate the influence of the studied factors on the sigmoid shape of the dissolution profile, piecewise function parameters were used as the responses of DoE. The results show that higher concentrations of coating polymer and higher concentrations of plasticizer polymer led to a thicker and more elastic polymeric film, which led to a delay in drug release. Using the parameters of the piecewise function as DoE responses, an optimum formulation with a sigmoid shape dissolution profile and a 2.5-h lag time followed by rapid drug release were obtained.",

    "2": "We followed an outpatients cohort of CHF patients secondary to left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, who were free of AF at baseline. All patients underwent clinical evaluation, comprehensive echocardiography, and blood drawing in the same morning. Aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), a measure of aortic stiffness, was determined by Doppler echocardiography. A total of 77 patients (age 63 \u00b1 9 years; 79% male) with mean LVEF (34 \u00b1 8%) formed the study population. Fifteen patients developed incidental AF. At baseline, CHF patients who developed AF during follow-up had higher E-wave velocity (75 \u00b1 2 cm/sec vs. 60 \u00b1 2 cm/sec; P = 0.02), higher difference duration between mitral and pulmonary vein A velocity (A'-A), (10 \u00b1 35 msec vs. 43 \u00b1 44 msec P = 0.02), aPWV (7.1 \u00b1 2.6 vs. 5.3 \u00b1 1.9 m/sec P = 0.004), and furosemide dosage (110 \u00b1 145 mg vs. 49 \u00b1 48 mg P = 0.01) than those remaining free from AF. The two groups of patients did not significantly differ in terms of NYHA, LV volumes, ejection fraction, left atrial volume, creatinine, hemoglobin, renin, epinephrine, amino-terminal propeptide of type III and I procollagens, ACE inhibitor, and \u03b2-blocker dose (P > 0.1 for all). Notably, higher aPWV (P = 0.01) and longer A-A' duration (P = 0.04) were associated with an increased incidence of AF, independently of potential confounders.",

In addition, a recently published study documented azithromycin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. This study aimed to justify the exact cardiovascular events accompanying azithromycin administration in rats, focusing on electrocardiographic, biochemical, and histopathological changes. In addition, the underlying mechanisms were studied regarding reactive oxygen species production, cytokine release, and apoptotic cell-death. Finally, the supposed protective effects of both carvedilol and vitamin C were assessed. Four groups of rats were used: (1) control, (2) azithromycin, (3) azithromycin + carvedilol, and (4) azithromycin + vitamin C. Azithromycin resulted in marked atrophy of cardiac muscle fibers and electrocardiographic segment alteration. It increased the heart rate, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, interleukin-1 beta (IL1-\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-\u03baB), and caspase-3. It decreased reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. Carvedilol and vitamin C prevented most of the azithromycin-induced electrocardiographic and histopathological changes. Carvedilol and vitamin C decreased lactate dehydrogenase, malondialdehyde, IL1-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB, and caspase-3. Both agents increased glutathione peroxidase. This study shows that both carvedilol and vitamin C protect against azithromycin-induced cardiotoxicity through antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and antiapoptotic mechanisms.", 
    "10": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a pleiotropic connective tissue disease inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, due to mutations in the FBN1 gene encoding fibrillin 1. It is an important protein of the extracellular matrix that contributes to the final structure of a microfibril. Few cases displaying an autosomal recessive transmission are reported in the world. The FBN1 gene, which is made of 66 exons, is located on chromosome 15q21.1. This review, after an introduction on the clinical manifestations that leads to the diagnosis of MFS, focuses on cardiovascular manifestations, pharmacological and surgical therapies of thoracic aortic aneurysm and/or dissection (TAAD), mechanisms underlying the progression of aneurysm or of acute dissection, and biomarkers associated with progression of TAADs. A Dutch group compared treatment with losartan, an angiotensin II receptor-1 blocker, vs no other additional treatment (COMPARE clinical trial). They observed that losartan reduces the aortic dilatation rate in patients with Marfan syndrome. Later on, they also reported that losartan exerts a beneficial effect on patients with Marfan syndrome carrying an FBN1 mutation that causes haploinsufficiency (quantitative mutation), while it has no significant effect on patients displaying dominant negative (qualitative) mutations. Moreover, a French group in a 3-year trial compared the administration of losartan vs placebo in patients with Marfan syndrome under treatment with beta-receptor blockers. They observed that losartan decreases blood pressure but has no effect on aortic diameter progression. Thus, beta-receptor blockers remain the gold standard therapy in patients with Marfan syndrome. Three potential biochemical markers are mentioned in this review: total homocysteine, serum transforming growth factor beta, and lysyl oxidase. Moreover, markers of oxidative stress measured in plasma, previously correlated with clinical features of Marfan syndrome, may be explored as potential biomarkers of clinical severity.",

The significance of specific blockade of \u03b11 subunit of N-type calcium channel, Cav2.2, in diabetic nephropathy, however, remains to be clarified. To examine functional roles, we mated Cav2.2(-/-) mice with db/db (diabetic) mice on the C57BLKS background. Cav2.2 was localized in glomeruli including podocytes and in distal tubular cells. Diabetic Cav2.2(-/-) mice significantly reduced urinary albumin excretion, glomerular hyperfiltration, blood glucose levels, histological deterioration and systolic blood pressure (SBP) with decreased urinary catecholamine compared to diabetic Cav2.2(+/+) mice. Interestingly, diabetic heterozygous Cav2.2(+/-) mice also decreased albuminuria, although they exhibited comparable systolic blood pressure, sympathetic nerve activity and creatinine clearance to diabetic Cav2.2(+/+) mice. Consistently, diabetic mice with cilnidipine, an N-/L-type calcium channel blocker, showed a reduction in albuminuria and improvement of glomerular changes compared to diabetic mice with nitrendipine. In cultured podocytes, depolarization-dependent calcium responses were decreased by \u03c9-conotoxin, a Cav2.2-specific inhibitor. Furthermore, reduction of nephrin by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in podocytes was abolished with \u03c9-conotoxin, cilnidipine or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor. In conclusion, Cav2.2 inhibition exerts renoprotective effects against the progression of diabetic nephropathy, partly by protecting podocytes.",

We also calculated the magnitude and duration of WCE. These analyses were also performed separately in patients off anti-hypertensive treatment (n\u00a0=\u00a0156), and on treatment with and without the inclusion of beta-blockers (respectively n\u00a0=\u00a0113 and 151).",

The substances were injected intravenously 5 min before reperfusion. The results indicate that activation of \u03b2-adrenoceptors and opening of L-type Ca(2+)-channels promote the development of cardiac reperfusion injury, while blockage of \u03b2-adrenoceptors and/or L-type Ca(2+)-channels prevents reoxygenation-induced myocardial injury.

    "18": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by severe angiogenic remodeling of the pulmonary artery wall and right ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, there is an increasing need for novel biomarkers to dissect disease heterogeneity, and predict treatment response. Although \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR) dysfunction is well documented in left heart disease while endothelial cell-derived microparticles (Ec-MPs) are established biomarkers of angiogenic remodeling, methods for easy large clinical cohort analysis of these biomarkers are currently absent. Here we describe flow cytometric methods for quantification of \u03b2AR density on circulating white blood cells (WBC) and Ec-MPs in urine samples that can be used as potential biomarkers of right heart failure in PAH. Biotinylated \u03b2-blocker alprenolol was synthesized and validated as a \u03b2AR specific probe that was combined with immunophenotyping to quantify \u03b2AR density in circulating WBC subsets. Ec-MPs obtained from urine samples were stained for annexin-V and CD144, and analyzed by a micro flow cytometer. Flow cytometric detection of alprenolol showed that \u03b2AR density was decreased in most WBC subsets in PAH samples compared to healthy controls. Ec-MPs in urine was increased in PAH compared to controls. Furthermore, there was a direct correlation between Ec-MPs and Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) in PAH patients. Therefore, flow cytometric quantification of peripheral blood cell \u03b2AR density and urinary Ec-MPs may be useful as potential biomarkers of right ventricular function in PAH.",

Here, a live stem cell derived embryoid body (EB) based cardiac cell syncytium served as a biorecognition element coupled to the microcantilever probe from atomic force microscope thus providing reliable micromechanical cellular biosensor suitable for whole-day testing. The biosensor was optimized regarding the type of cantilever, temperature and exchange of media; in combination with standardized protocol, it allowed testing of compounds and conditions affecting the biomechanical properties of EB. The studied effectors included calcium , drugs modulating the catecholaminergic fight-or-flight stress response such as the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol and the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Arrhythmogenic effects were studied using caffeine. Furthermore, with EBs originating from patient's stem cells, this biosensor can help to characterize heart diseases such as dystrophies.",

They were termed N-Cel and C-Cel, respectively. Despite their smaller retention factors on a C-Cel column, the enantioseparation factors and resolution of \u03b2-blockers, propranolol, alprenolol, oxprenolol and pindolol, were similar with N- and C-Cel columns. In addition, C-Cel was prepared using aminopropyl-silica gels, whose nominal particle diameters were 5 and 3, and 2.1\u03bcm, respectively. A C-Cel column prepared with 2.1-\u03bcm aminopropyl-silica gels gave the highest enantioselectivity and column efficiency among three C-Cel columns. Furthermore, the influence of N,N-dimethyl-n-octylamine (DMOA) or cellobiose concentrations on the retentivity and enantioselectivity for \u03b2-blockers on a C-Cel column was investigated. The results indicate that single-site competition of \u03b2-blockers with DMOA or cellobiose on the catalytic binding site of Cel and the further bindings at the secondary site in a non-competitive fashion could occur. Furthermore, the enantioselective bindings of \u03b2-blockers could occur at the catalytic biding cite of Cel and at the secondary binding site.",

It predominantly occurs in post-menopausal women and is commonly associated with emotional or physical stress. Patients commonly present with chest pain and electrocardiographic evidence of ST segment elevation or T-wave-mimicking acute coronary syndrome, but with an absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary disease. The exact cause is unknown, but potential contributors include catecholamine excess and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity. There is no consensus on pharmacological treatment of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Based on the suspected pathophysiology of the disease, adrenergic blockade using beta-blocker therapy is employed. Near complete resolution of left ventricular wall motion dyskinesis occurs in the majority of takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients within a month. Although the prognosis is generally favorable, there are reports of complications during the acute phase, including cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, ventricular tachycardia, apical thrombus formation, and death.

Understanding of the diagnostic and risk stratifying role of LQTS genetics is also discussed. At least 14 LQTS genes are now thought to be responsible for the disease. High-risk individuals may have multiple mutations, large gene rearrangements, C-loop mutations in KCNQ1, transmembrane mutations in KCNH2, or have certain gene modifiers present, particularly NOS1AP polymorphisms. In regards to treatment, nadolol is preferred, particularly for long QT type 2, and short acting metoprolol should not be used. Thoracoscopic left cardiac sympathectomy is valuable in those who cannot adhere to beta blocker therapy, particularly in long QT type 1.

Beta 1-selective intravenous injection are routinely used, but long-term administration is difficult due to cost-performance- or management-related issues. A bisoprolol patch, a beta-blocker to be percutaneously absorbed, recently became commercially available in Japan. As it may facilitate effective absorption and a mild elevation of the blood concentration, we retrospectively analyzed 16 patients with atrial fibrillation-related tachycardia who were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Hitachi General Hospital Emergency and Critical Care Center, and underwent switching therapy from landiolol to a bisoprolol patch. For switching, the bisoprolol patch (4\u00a0mg) was attached to each patient. The bisoprolol patch was introduced 88\u00a0h after the start of landiolol administration, when the rate was approximately 3\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/min.

The dysfunction is located at the level of the coronary microcirculation with vessel diameters <\u2009500\u00a0\u00b5m and structural as well as functional alterations have been described. The underlying mechanisms are diverse, frequently overlap and are still incompletely understood. Among others, conditions such as chronic inflammation, estrogen deficiency and a genetic familial predisposition have been reported. A common and often underdiagnosed clinical manifestation of CMD is found in patients who have symptoms of angina pectoris but no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease or myocardial disease. The CMD can be diagnosed using non-invasive procedures, such as the combination of coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography and cardiac stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or coronary CT and positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, invasive coronary vasomotor assessment is also suitable. Very little evidence is available regarding the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment of CMD. The current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on the management of stable coronary artery disease from 2013 recommend using acetylsalicylic acid (ASS) and a statin as well as beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers. Patients with CMD have an elevated risk for coronary events and death of approximately 1.7\u2009% per year.

(2) \u03b2\u2083-AR was expressed in both endothelial and smooth muscle layer in thoracic aorta sections of rats. (3) PRA did not block the effect of BRL on the thoracic aorta. The relaxation actions of BRL could be antagonized by pre-incubating the thoracic aorta with SR. (4) L-NNA (a NOS inhibitor) and H-89 (a PKA inhibitor) reversed the relaxation effect of BRL on vascular smooth muscle. (5) The effect of BRL was decreased after application of Ibriotoxin (IBTX), a large conductance calcium dependent potassium channel blocker.",

The relaxation action of \u03b2\u2083-AR on smooth muscle of rat thoracic aorta was related to activation of NOS and PKA signaling pathway. Large conductance Ca\u00b2\u207a-K\u207a channels were involved in the relaxation action of \u03b2\u2083-AR activation on rat thoracic aorta smooth muscle.",

Propranolol, as a non selective beta-adrenergic blocker, has been extensively used for treatment of many cardiovascular problems such as arrhythmias and heart malfunction. In addition anti-inflammatory effects of propranolol have been revealed. In this study the propranolol effect on T helper type 1 cytokine profile in human leukemic T cells has been assessed in vitro.",

The cells were then incubated with different concentrations of propranolol (0.03- 30 \u00b5M) in the presence or absence of PHA (10 \u00b5g/ml) for 48 hours. The supernatants of cell culture media were collected and used for cytokines assay.",

    "46": "Our data showed a dose dependent inhibitory effect of propranolol on the IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 production in human leukemic Molt-4 and Jurkat cells. The anti- inflammatory effect of propranolol reported by other investigators may be in part due to its suppressive effect on production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3. So, propranolol along with its chronic long-term usage in cardiovascular problems may have potential implication in treatment of inflammatory-based disorders.",

    "48": "Our preclinical study demonstrated that esmolol produces early regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in arterial hypertension. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of short-term esmolol therapy on the regression of left anterior descending artery remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and to determine whether the asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)/dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) pathway, a regulator of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, accounted for this regression. Fourteen-month-old male SHRs were treated intravenously with vehicle (SHR, n=15) or esmolol (SHR-E, n=20) (300\u2009\u03bcg\u2009kg(-1)\u2009min(-1)). Age-matched, vehicle-treated male Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY, n=15) served as controls. SHRs were also treated with nitroglycerin (SHR-N, n=5). After 48\u2009h, the left anterior descending artery structure and morphology were assessed, and dose-response curves for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 10(-9)-3 \u00d7 10(-5) mol\u2009l(-1)) were constructed. ADMA concentrations in plasma and left ventricle and DDAH activity in tissue were analyzed. Wall thickness and cross-sectional area were significantly lower after treatment with esmolol in SHR-E than in SHR. Media thickness and smooth muscle cell count were lower in SHR-E than in SHR. Esmolol induced a significant reduction in adventitial cell count in SHR-E. The area under the concentration-response curves was significantly higher in SHR than in SHR-E, as were the esmolol normalized coronary artery contracting responses to 5-HT. We found significantly lower ADMA levels and significantly higher DDAH activity in the ventricle in SHR-E than in SHR. The protective effect of esmolol on the regression of left anterior descending artery remodeling may be related to the reduction in ADMA levels.", 
    "49": "The success of oral propranolol for treatment of infantile hemangiomas (IHs) has led practitioners to use topical \u03b2-blockers.

Two of these infants were full term; weighed more than 3,000 g; and had rare, brief, asymptomatic episodes unrelated to the timing of the timolol application. The other two infants had symptomatic bradycardia while on timolol and were the only two babies that weighed less than 2,500 g at initiation of therapy. Both were young (postmenstrual age [PMA] 34 and 37 wks) at initiation and had a timolol dose above the average exposure for the cohort.", 
    "52": "In this cohort of at-risk infants, topical timolol appeared to provide safe treatment for IHs in full-term infants receiving a dose of less than 0.2 mg/kg/day, but infants with a PMA of less than 44 weeks and weight at treatment initiation of less than 2,500 g may be at risk of adverse events, including bradycardia, hypotension, apnea, and hypothermia. We recommend close monitoring of temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate in premature and low-birthweight infants with IHs at initiation of and during therapy with topical timolol.", 
    "53": "In hypoglossal motoneurons, a sustained anionic current, sensitive to a blocker of \u03c1-containing GABA receptors, (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA) and insensitive to bicuculline, was previously shown to be activated by gabazine. In order to better characterize the receptors involved, the sensitivity of this atypical response to pentobarbital (30\u03bcM), allopregnanolone (0.3\u03bcM) and midazolam (0.5\u03bcM) was first investigated. Pentobarbital potentiated the response, whereas the steroid and the benzodiazepine were ineffective. The results indicate the involvement of hybrid heteromeric receptors, including at least a GABA receptor \u03c1 subunit and a \u03b3 subunit, accounting for the pentobarbital-sensitivity. The effects of the endogenous \u03b2 amino acids, taurine and \u03b2-alanine, which are released under various pathological conditions and show neuroprotective properties, were then studied. In the presence of the glycine receptor blocker strychnine (1\u03bcM), both taurine (0.3-1mM) and \u03b2-alanine (0.3mM) activated sustained anionic currents, which were partly blocked by TPMPA (100\u03bcM). Thus, both \u03b2 amino acids activated \u03c1-containing GABA receptors in hypoglossal motoneurons. Bicuculline (20\u03bcM) reduced responses to taurine and \u03b2-alanine, but small sustained responses persisted in the presence of both strychnine and bicuculline. Responses to \u03b2-alanine were slightly increased by allopregnanolone, indicating a contribution of the bicuculline- and neurosteroid-sensitive GABAA receptors underlying tonic inhibition in these motoneurons. Since sustained activation of anionic channels inhibits most mature principal neurons, the \u03c1-containing GABA receptors permanently activated by taurine and \u03b2-alanine might contribute to some of their neuroprotective properties under damaging overexcitatory situations.", 
    "54": "Rifampicin, a member of rifamycin sub-class of antibiotics which belongs to the naphthalenic ansamycin class of antibiotics, has a characteristic ansa structure, i.e., a ring structure or chromophore spanned by an aliphatic chain. The present work was designed to evaluate its potential as a chiral selector (CS) as its structure consisting of nine stereogenic centers, an aromatic moiety and several functional groups (i.e., one imine, one amide, one acetoxy residue, two aliphatic hydroxyl and three phenolic hydroxyl groups) was expected to instigate multiple enantioselective interactions, namely, hydrogen bonding and inclusion complexation with chiral analytes, and therefore resulting in efficient enantioseparations. Systematic experiments were performed to investigate the effects of concentration of CS, composition of background electrolyte (BGE) and applied voltage on chiral separation. Enantiomers of propranolol and metoprolol were baseline resolved using a BGE consisting of 20mM CS and 50/50 (v/v) iso-propanol/phosphate buffer (100mM, pH 7.0) whereas for enantiomers of sertraline, a BGE consisting of 23mM CS and 40/60 (v/v) iso-propanol/phosphate buffer (100mM, pH 7.0) resulted in baseline resolutions.", 
    "55": "Entorhinal-hippocampal network is one of the earliest circuits which is affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are numerous data providing the evidence of synaptic deficit in the dentate gyrus (DG) of AD animal model. However, there is little known about how entorhinal cortex (EC) amyloidophaty affects each excitatory and/or inhibitory transmission in the early stage of AD. On the other hand, it is believed that calcium dyshomeostasis has a critical role in the etiology of AD. Here, the effect of the EC amyloid pathogenesis on excitatory or inhibitory post synaptic currents (EPSC and IPSC, respectively) in the DG granule cells and then the possible neuroprotective action of L-type calcium channel blockers (CCBs), nimodipine and isradipine, were examined. The amyloid beta (A\u03b2) 1-42 was injected bilaterally into the EC of male rats and one week later, synaptic currents in the DG granule cells were assessed by whole cell patch clamp. EPSCs were evoked by stimulating the perforant pathway. Voltage clamp recording showed profound decrease of evoked EPSC amplitude and paired pulse facilitation in the DG granule cells of A\u03b2 treated rats. Furthermore, AMPA/NMDA ratio was significantly decreased in the A\u03b2 treated animals. On the other hand, amplitude of IPSC currents was significantly increased in the DG granule cells of these animals. These modifications of synaptic currents were partially reversed by daily intracerebroventricular administration of isradipine or nimodipine. In conclusion, our results suggest that A\u03b2 in the EC triggers decreased excitatory transmission in the DG with substantial decrement in AMPA currents, leading to a prominent activity of inhibitory circuits and increased inhibition of granule cells which may contribute to the development of AD-related neurological deficits in AD and treatment by CCBs could preserve normal synaptic transmission against A\u03b2 toxicity.",

In all, 15% reported CV disease before therapy with a higher incidence of CV disease in survivors more than 5 years from diagnosis (20% >5 years versus 10% <5 years of survivorship, P = 0.05). The reported use of beta blockers (9%) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (9%) was rare despite the high incidence of CV disease. Only one-fourth of survivors were offered CV screening during treatment, whereas 36% of survivors had unanswered questions about CV symptoms from therapy. The CV symptoms adversely affected lifestyle in 27% of CS. One-fifth of survivors received exercise counseling even though half would have liked counseling.",

    "60": "Liver metastases are a major cause of colorectal cancer death, and the perioperative period is believed to critically affect the metastatic process. Here we tested whether blocking excess release of catecholamines and prostaglandins during surgical procedures of different extent can reduce experimental liver metastasis of the syngeneic CT26 colon cancer in female and male BALB/c mice. Animals were either treated with the beta-blocker, propranolol, the COX-2 inhibitor, etodolac, both drugs, or vehicle. The role of NK cells in controlling CT26 hepatic metastasis and in mediating the effect of the drugs was assessed by in vivo depletion or stimulation of NK cells, using anti-asialo GM1 or CpG-C, respectively. Surgical extent was manipulated by adding laparotomy to small incision, extending surgical duration, and enabling hypothermia. The results indicated that combined administration of propranolol and etodolac, but neither drug alone, significantly improved host resistance to metastasis. These beneficial effects occurred in both minor and extensive surgeries, in both sexes, and in two tumor inoculation approaches. NK cell-mediated anti-CT26 activity is involved in mediating the beneficial effects of the drugs. Specifically, CpG-C treatment, known to profoundly activate mice marginating-hepatic NK cytotoxicity, reduced CT26 hepatic metastases; and NK-depletion increased metastases and prevented the beneficial effects of the drugs. Overall, given prevalent perioperative psychological and physiological stress responses in patients, and ample prostaglandin release by colorectal tumors and injured tissue, propranolol and etodolac could be tested clinically in laparoscopic and open colorectal surgeries, attempting to reduce patients' metastatic disease.",

Dystrophinopathies include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as DMD and BMD female carriers. The primary presenting symptom in most dystrophinopathies is skeletal muscle weakness. However, cardiac muscle is also a subtype of striated muscle and is similarly affected in many of the muscular dystrophies. Cardiomyopathies associated with dystrophinopathies are an increasingly recognized manifestation of these neuromuscular disorders and contribute significantly to their morbidity and\u00a0mortality. Recent studies suggest that these patient populations would benefit from cardiovascular therapies, annual\u00a0cardiovascular imaging studies, and close follow-up with cardiovascular specialists.

We used propranolol (a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker) to compare the results. Rats were given intraperitoneal injections of histidine (40 mg kg(-1)) and vitamin C (40 mg kg(-1)) alone and combined daily for 21 days. Propranolol (10 mg kg(-1)) was orally administered daily for 10 days (from day 11 to day 21). Myocardial infarction was induced by subcutaneous injections of 150 mg kg(-1) of isoproterenol at an interval of 24 hr on days 20 and 21. Blood and tissue samples were taken for histopathological and biochemical evaluations following electrocardiography recording on day 21. Isoproterenol elevated ST segment, increased heart weight, heart rate, serum activities of aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase-MB and heart tissue content of malondialdehyde, and decreased R wave amplitude and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities of heart tissue. Necrosis, edema and inflammatory cells infiltration were observed in myocardial tissue sections. Our results indicated that histidine and vitamin C alone, and especially in combination prevent isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity and have similar protective effects with propranolol. Cardioprotective effects of histidine and vitamin C may be associated with their ability to reduce free radical-induced toxic effects.",

We show that locally expressed colon GH is abundant in conditions predisposing to colon cancer and in colon adenocarcinoma-associated stromal fibroblasts. Administration of a GH receptor (GHR) blocker in acromegaly patients induced colon p53 and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), reversing progrowth GH signals. p53 was also induced in skin fibroblasts derived from short-statured humans with mutant GHR. GH-deficient prophet of pituitary-specific positive transcription factor 1 (Prop1)(-/-) mice exhibited induced colon p53 levels, and cross-breeding them with Apc(min+/-) mice that normally develop intestinal and colon tumors resulted in GH-deficient double mutants with markedly decreased tumor number and size. We also demonstrate that GH suppresses p53 and reduces apoptosis in human colon cell lines as well as in induced human pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal organoids, and confirm in vivo that GH suppresses colon mucosal p53/p21. GH excess leads to decreased colon cell phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), increased cell survival with down-regulated APC, nuclear \u03b2-catenin accumulation, and increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition factors and colon cell motility. We propose that GH is a molecular component of the \"field change\" milieu permissive for neoplastic colon growth.",

These guidelines update and replace the previous ESC guidelines on the management of stable angina pectoris, issued in 2006. There are several new aspects in the 2013 ESC guidelines compared with the 2006 version. This opinion paper provides an in-depth interpretation of the ESC guidelines with regard to these issues, to help physicians in making evidence-based therapeutic choices in their routine clinical practice. The first new element is the definition of stable coronary artery disease itself, which has now broadened from a 'simple' symptom, angina pectoris, to a more complex disease that can even be asymptomatic. In the first-line setting, the major changes in the new guidelines are the upgrading of calcium channel blockers, the distinction between dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and the presence of important statements regarding the combination of calcium channel blockers with beta-blockers. In the second-line setting, the 2013 ESC guidelines recommend the addition of long-acting nitrates, ivabradine, nicorandil or ranolazine to first-line agents. Trimetazidine may also be considered. However, no clear distinction is made among different second-line drugs, despite different quality of evidence in favour of these agents. For example, the use of ranolazine is supported by strong and recent evidence, while data supporting the use of the traditional agents appear relatively scanty.",

The aim of the present study was to characterize the cytotoxicity of carteolol to HCEP and its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms using an in vitro model of HCEP cells. After HCEP cells were treated with carteolol at concentrations varying from 2% to 0.015625%, the cytotoxicity, apoptosis-inducing effect and pro-apoptotic pathway was investigated, respectively. Our results showed that carteolol at concentrations above 0.03125% induced time- and dose-dependent growth retardation, cytopathic morphological changes and viability decline of HCEP cells. Moreover, carteolol induced G1 phase arrest, plasma membrane permeability elevation, phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation of HCEP cells. Furthermore, carteolol also induced activation of caspase-9 and -3, disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, up-regulation the cytoplasmic amount of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor, and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bad, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. In conclusion, carteolol above 1/64 of its clinical therapeutic dosage has a time- and dose-dependent cytotoxicity to HCEP cells, which is achieved by inducing apoptosis via triggering Bcl-2 family protein-mediated mitochondrial pro-apoptotic pathway.",

It would provide a theoretical basis for the development of new combined antihypertensive therapy program after iptakalim is applied to the clinic. Amlodipine besylate, hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol were chosen as clinical first-line antihypertensive drugs. Blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and cardiac functions were observed in anesthetized normal rats by an eight-channel physiological recorder. The results showed that iptakalim monotherapy in a low dose could produce significant antihypertensive effect. There was no interaction between iptakalim and amlodipine on the maximal changes of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), the left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) (P > 0.05). However, the effects of combination iptakalim/amlodipine on the maximal changes of SBP, DBP, MABP, LVSP and LVEDP were more obvious than those of iptakalim or amlodipine monotherapy. And there was strong positive interaction between iptakalim and amlodipine on the maximal changes of HR (P>0.05). According to the maximal changes of DBP, MABP, LVSP and LVEDP (P < 0.05) of combination iptakalim with hydrochlorothiazide, there was strong positive interaction between them. But there was no interaction between iptakalim and hydrochlorothiazide on the maximal drop of SBP and HR (P > 0.05). According to the maximal drops of DBP, MABP of combination iptakalim with propranolol, there was strong positive interaction between them (P < 0.05). But there was no interaction between iptakalim and propranolol on the maximal changes of SBP, LVSP, LVEDP and HR (P > 0.05). In conclusion, it was the first time to study the effects of amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol, which had different mechanisms of action from iptakalim, on cardiovascular effects of iptakalim in anesthetized normal rats. This study proved that the combination of iptakalim with hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol respectively had significant synergism on lowering blood pressure, while the combination of iptakalim/amlodipine had additive action on lowering blood pressure. Meanwhile the antihypertensive effect was explicit, stable and long-lasting. Iptakalim thus appears suitable for the clinical treatment of hypertensive people who need two or more kinds of antihypertensive agents.",

However, Syt-7's precise exocytotic actions in \u03b2-cells remain unknown. We show that Syt-7 is abundant in human \u03b2-cells. Adenovirus-short hairpin RNA knockdown (KD) of Syt-7 in human islets reduced first- and second-phase GSIS attributed to the reduction of exocytosis of predocked and newcomer insulin secretory granules (SGs). Glucose stimulation expectedly induced Syt-7 association in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner with syntaxin-3 and syntaxin-1A soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes known to mediate exocytosis of newcomer and predocked SGs, respectively. However, Syt-7-KD did not disrupt SNARE complex assembly. Instead, electron microscopy analysis showed that Syt-7-KD reduced the recruitment of SGs to the plasma membrane after glucose-stimulated depletion, which could not be rescued by glucagon-like peptide 1 pretreatment. To assess the possibility that this new action of Syt-7 on SG recruitment may involve calmodulin (CaM), pretreatment of islets with CaM blocker calmidazolium showed effects very similar to those of Syt-7-KD. Syt-7 therefore plays a novel more dominant function in the replenishment of releasable SG pools in human \u03b2-cells than its previously purported role in exocytotic fusion per se.", 
    "108": "During the last decade, hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems (SNS and RAAS, respectively) has repeatedly been related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and PAH-related right ventricular failure (PAH-RVF), raising the question of whether neurohormonal inhibition may be indicated for these conditions. Experimental data indicate that the RAAS may be involved in pulmonary vascular remodeling, which is in fact halted by RAAS antagonism. Favorable actions of \u03b2-blockers on the pulmonary vasculature have also been described, even if information about \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in PAH is lacking. Furthermore, the available evidence suggests that stimulation of the pressure-overloaded RV by the SNS and RAAS is initially compensatory, but becomes maladaptive over time. Consistently, RV reverse remodeling has been shown in PAH animal models treated with either \u03b2-blockers or RAAS inhibitors, although important differences with human PAH may limit the translational value of these findings. Only few observational studies of neurohormonal antagonism in PAH and PAH-RVF have been published. Nonetheless, \u03b2-blockers on top of specific therapy appear to be safe and possibly also effective. The combination of mineralocorticoid receptor and endothelin-A receptor antagonists may result in an additive effect because of a positive pharmacodynamic interaction. While neurohormonal inhibitors cannot be recommended at present for treatment of PAH and PAH-RVF, they are worth being further investigated.",

Nebivolol is a newer generation \u03b2-blocker, which is thought to avoid this side effect via its vasodilating property. However, the effects of nebivolol on skeletal muscle perfusion during exercise have not been determined in hypertensive patients. Accordingly, we performed contrast-enhanced ultrasound perfusion imaging of the forearm muscles in 25 untreated stage I hypertensive patients at rest and during handgrip exercise at baseline or after 12 wk of treatment with nebivolol (5-20 mg/day) or metoprolol succinate (100-300 mg/day), with a subsequent double crossover for 12 wk.

Metoprolol significantly attenuated the increase in microvascular blood volume (MBV) during handgrip at 12 and 20 repetitions/min by 50% compared with baseline (mixed-model P < 0.05), which was not observed with nebivolol. Neither metoprolol nor nebivolol affected microvascular flow velocity (MFV). Similarly, metoprolol and nebivolol had no effect on the increase in the conduit brachial artery flow as determined by duplex Doppler ultrasound. Thus our study demonstrated a first direct evidence for metoprolol-induced impairment in the recruitment of microvascular units during exercise in hypertensive humans, which was avoided by nebivolol. This selective reduction in MBV without alteration in MFV by metoprolol suggested impaired vasodilation at the precapillary arteriolar level.",

Angiotensin II components of the RAS have also been identified in the brain.

Moreover, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models, where neuroinflammation occurs, increased levels of cortical AT1Rs have been shown. Still, the precise role of RAS in neuroinflammation is not completely clear. The overall aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of RAS in the modulation of glial functions and AD pathology. To reach this goal, the specific aims of the present study were a. to investigate the long term effect of telmisartan (AT1R blocker) on tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1-\u03b2 (IL1-\u03b2) and nitric oxide (NO) release from glial cells. b. to examine the effect of intranasally administered telmisartan on amyloid burden and microglial activation in 5X familial AD (5XFAD) mice.

Resuscitation was achieved according to Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocol. Post-event echocardiography showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with asymmetrical septal thickening, an under-filled left ventricle, dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction, and severe mitral regurgitation related to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Laboratory analysis showed a tryptase level of 209 ng/mL. After multispecialty evaluation, it was concluded that the patient's arrest was due to vancomycin anaphylaxis in the setting of previously undiagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy leading to acute left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. After medical optimization of the patient's cardiomyopathy and an evaluation of potential intraoperative allergic triggers, the patient underwent a successful hip reimplantation without incident. This case presents a novel combination of events leading to intraoperative cardiac arrest. Rapid identification and an understanding of the cause(s) of cardiac arrest in this setting are critical for effective perioperative care.",

[In vitro] staten's seruminstitut rabbit corneal cells were exposed to 0.005% latanoprost for 30s, followed by either phosphate buffered saline (control), 0.1% brimonidine, 0.5% timolol, 1% dorzolamide, or 1% brinzolamide. The number of viable cells was counted at 8, 15, and 30min. [In vivo] Albino rabbits were administered one drop of 0.005% latanoprost, followed 5min later by one drop of an agent from the in vitro trial. This was repeated every 15min for a total of three times. The change in corneal barrier function was assessed by measuring the corneal resistance at 2 and 30min after the final administration. [In vitro] At 8min, the viable cell count in the latanoprost+dorzolamide group was significantly lower than in the control group. At 15 and 30min, all treatment groups, except the latanoprost+brimonidine group, demonstrated significantly lower viable cell counts than the control group. [In vivo] At 2min after the final eye drop, the latanoprost+timolol group and the latanoprost+brinzolamide group demonstrated significantly lower corneal resistance than did the latanoprost+brimonidine group. No significant difference was observed between the agents at 30min. In conclusion, when combining latanoprost containing benzalkonium chloride with other classes of antiglaucoma drugs, brimonidine may cause the least corneal damage, and the number of drug administrations may be an important factor.", 
    "150": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder of connective tissue that affects the cardiovascular, skeletal, ocular, pulmonary, and nervous systems and is usually caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes fibrillin-1. MFS is traditionally considered to result from the structural weakness of connective tissue. However, recent investigations on molecular mechanisms indicate that increased transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) activity plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MFS and related disorders, such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), which is caused by mutation in TGF-\u03b2 signaling-related genes. In addition, recent studies show that angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) signaling enhances cardiovascular pathologies in MFS, and the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan has the potential to inhibit aortic aneurysm formation. However, the relationship between TGF-\u03b2 and AT1R signaling pathways remains poorly characterized. In this review, we discuss the recent studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular manifestations of MFS and LDS and the ensuing strategies for management.", 
    "151": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are expressed in pancreatic beta-cells. G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) contributes to medium- or long-chain fatty acid-induced amplification of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and GPR40 agonists are promising therapeutic targets in type 2 diabetes. Recently, we demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide 1, a ligand of pancreatic GPCR, activates a class of nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) and enhances GSIS. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the GPR40 signal interacts with NSCCs. A GPR40 agonist (fasiglifam) potentiated GSIS at 8.3 and 16.7\u2009mM glucose but not 2.8\u2009mM glucose. The NSCC current was activated by fasiglifam at 5.6\u2009mM glucose with 100\u2009\u03bcM tolbutamide (-70\u2009mV), and this activation was prevented by the presence of pyrazole-3 (transient receptor potential canonical; a TRPC3 channel blocker). Inhibitors of phospholipase C or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibited the increases in GSIS and the NSCC current induced by GPR40 stimulation. The present study demonstrates a novel mechanism for the regulation of insulin secretion by GPR40 agonist in pancreatic beta-cells. The stimulation of the GPR40-PLC/PKC-TRPC3 channel pathway potentiates GSIS by the depolarization of the plasma membrane in pancreatic beta-cell.",

The two most common forms of glaucoma, primary open-angle glaucoma and primary angle-closure glaucoma, affect more than 2 million Americans and are increasing in prevalence. Many patients with glaucoma are asymptomatic and do not know they have the disease. Risk factors for primary open-angle glaucoma include older age, black race, Hispanic origin, family history of glaucoma, and diabetes mellitus. Risk factors for primary angle-closure glaucoma include older age, Asian descent, and female sex. Advanced disease at initial presentation and treatment nonadherence put patients with glaucoma at risk of disease progression to blindness. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has concluded that the evidence is insufficient to assess the potential benefits and harms of screening for glaucoma in the primary care setting. Regular eye examinations for adults are recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, with the interval depending on patient age and risk factors. Diagnosis of glaucoma requires careful optic nerve evaluation and functional studies assessing a patient's visual field. The goal of treatment with eye drops, laser therapy, or surgery is to slow visual field loss by lowering intraocular pressure. Family physicians can contribute to lowering morbidity from glaucoma through early identification of high-risk patients and by emphasizing treatment adherence in patients with glaucoma.", 
    "166": "Cucurbita ficifolia Bouch\u00e9(C. ficifolia) is a plant used in Mexican traditional medicine to control type 2 diabetes (T2D). The hypoglycemic effect of the fruit of C. ficifolia has been demonstrated in different experimental models and in T2D patients. It has been proposed that D-chiro-inositol (DCI) is the active compound of the fruit. Additionally, it has been reported that C. ficifolia increases the mRNA expression of insulin and Kir 6.2 (a component of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(+)ATP) channel, which is activated by sulphonylurea) in RINm5F cells. However, it remains unclear whether C. ficifolia and DCI causes the secretion of insulin by increasing the concentration of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i) through K(+)ATP channel blockage or from the reservoir in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).", 
    "167": "The aqueous extract of C. ficifolia was obtained and standardized with regard to its DCI content. RINm5F pancreatic \u03b2-cells were incubated with different concentrations (50, 100, 200 and 400\u03bcM) of DCI alone or C. ficifolia (9, 18, 36 and 72\u00b5g of extract/mL), and the [Ca(2+)]i of the cells was quantified. The cells were preloaded with the Ca(2+) fluorescent dye fluo4-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) and visualized by confocal microscopy. Insulin secretion was measured by an ELISA method. Subsequently, the effect of C. ficifolia on the K(+)ATP channel was evaluated. In this case, the blocker activator diazoxide was used to inhibit the C. ficifolia-induced calcium influx. In addition, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-receptor-selective inhibitor 2-amino-thoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) was used to inhibit the influx of calcium from the ER that was induced by C. ficifolia.", 
    "168": "It was found that DCI alone did not increase [Ca(2+)]i or insulin secretion. In contrast, treatment with C. ficifolia increased [Ca(2+)]i 10-fold compared with the control group. Insulin secretion increased by 46.9%. In the presence of diazoxide, C. ficifolia decreased [Ca(2+)]i by 50%, while insulin secretion increased by 36.4%. In contrast, in the presence of 2-APB, C. ficifolia increased [Ca(2+)]i 18-fold, while insulin secretion remained constant, indicating an additive effect. Therefore, C. ficifolia was not found to block the K(+)ATP channel. However, it did exert an effect by increasing [Ca(2+)]i from the ER, which may partly explain the insulin secretion observed following treatment with C. ficifolia.", 
    "169": "The hypoglycemic properties of C. ficifolia can be explained in part by its effect as a secretagogue for insulin through an increase in [Ca(2+)]i from the calcium reservoir in the ER. Therefore, the mechanism of action of C. ficifolia is different to those of the currently used hypoglycemic drugs, such as sulfonylureas. These results support that C. ficifolia may be a potential natural resource for new agents to control T2D.", 
    "170": "It is generally regarded that E-cadherin is downregulated during tumorigenesis via Snail/Slug-mediated E-cadherin transcriptional reduction. However, this transcriptional suppressive mechanism cannot explain the failure of producing E-cadherin protein in metastatic breast cancer cells after overexpressing E-cadherin mRNA. Here we reveal a novel mechanism that E-cadherin is post-transcriptionally regulated by Slug-promoted miR-221, which serves as an additional blocker for E-cadherin expression in metastatic tumor cells. Profiling the predicted E-cadherin-targeting miRNAs in breast cancer tissues and cells showed that miR-221 was abundantly expressed in breast tumor and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells and its level was significantly higher in breast tumor or MDA-MB-231 cells than in distal non-tumor tissue and low-metastatic MCF-7 cells, respectively. MiR-221, which level inversely correlated with E-cadherin level in breast cancer cells, targeted E-cadherin mRNA open reading frame (ORF) and suppressed E-cadherin protein expression. Depleting or increasing miR-221 level in breast cancer cells induced or decreased E-cadherin protein level, leading to suppressing or promoting tumor cell progression, respectively. Moreover, miR-221 was specifically upregulated by Slug but not Snail. TGF-\u03b2 treatment enhanced Slug activity and thus increased miR-221 level in MCF-7 cells. In summary, our results provide the first evidence that Slug-upregulated miR-221 promotes breast cancer progression via reducing E-cadherin expression.", 
    "171": "Sympathetic innervations exist in mammalian CL. The action of catecholaminergic system on luteal cells has been the focus of a variety of studies. Norepinephrine (NE) increased progesterone secretion of cattle luteal cells by activating \u03b2-adrenoceptors. In this study, murine luteal cells were treated with NE and isoprenaline (ISO). We found that NE increased the viability of murine luteal cells and ISO decreased the viability of luteal cells. Both NE and ISO promoted the progesterone production. Nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol reversed the effect of ISO on cell viability but did not reverse the effect of NE on cell viability. Propranolol blocked the influence of NE and ISO on progesterone production. These results reveal that the increase of luteal cell viability induced by NE is not dependent on \u03b2-adrenergic activation. \u03b1-Adrenergic activation possibly contributes to it. Both NE and ISO increased progesterone production through activating \u03b2-adrenergic receptor. Further study showed that CyclinD2 is involved in the increase of luteal cell induced by NE. 3\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, LHR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and PGF2\u03b1 contribute to the progesterone production induced by NE and ISO.",

In \u03b1-chloralose-anesthetized cats, non-nociceptive reflex bladder activity was induced by slowly infusing saline into the bladder, whereas nociceptive reflex bladder activity was induced by replacing saline with 0.25% acetic acid (AA) to irritate the bladder. PNS was applied at multiple threshold (T) intensities for inducing anal sphincter twitching.

In conclusion, the effects of carvedilol may reduce conjunctivitis clinical scores through inflammation, NGF and VEGF in LPS-induced rat models.",

    "191": "A heart failure inception cohort of patients aged 20-89 years without atrial fibrillation or cancer (N\u200a=\u200a14\u200a457) from 2000 to 2005 was identified from The Health Improvement Network primary care database in the United Kingdom and followed for a mean of 2.67 years. First ever cases of atrial fibrillation were identified and controls (N\u200a=\u200a3000) were frequency matched to cases by age and sex. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression.", 
    "192": "One thousand four hundred and eighty-nine patients (10.3%) developed a first episode of atrial fibrillation: incidence rate 27.3/1000 person-years. A three-fold increased risk of atrial fibrillation was seen in the first 6\u200amonths after heart failure diagnosis, OR 3.62 (95% CI: 2.97-4.42) with the risk decreasing thereafter. Other risk factors were excessive alcohol consumption (OR 2.91, 1.60-5.30) and valvular heart disease (OR 1.98, 1.63-2.40) and use of oral steroids (OR 1.76, 95% CI: 1.40-2.22). Reduced risks of atrial fibrillation were found with use of statins (OR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.56-0.76) and \u03b2-blockers (OR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.91).", 
    "193": "The incidence of first ever atrial fibrillation among newly diagnosed heart failure patients is high, especially in the first 6 months after diagnosis. This time relationship, together with the identified risk factors for atrial fibrillation, warrants consideration in the medical care of patients with heart failure.", 
    "194": "To analyse the effect of the early coadministration of ivabradine and beta-blockers (intervention group) versus beta-blockers alone (control group) in patients hospitalised with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF).", 
    "195": "A comparative, randomised study was performed to compare the treatment strategies of beta-blockers alone versus ivabradine and beta-blockers starting 24hours after hospital admission, for acute HF in patients with an left ventricular ejection fraction (EF)<40%, sinus rhythm, and a heart rate (HR)>70bpm.", 
    "196": "A total of 71 patients were examined, 33 in the intervention group and 38 in the control group. No differences were observed with respect to their baseline characteristics or standard treatment at discharge. HR at 28days (64.3\u00b17.5 vs. 70.3\u00b19.3bpm, p=0.01) and at 4months (60.6\u00b17.5 vs. 67.8\u00b18bpm, p=0.004) after discharge were significantly lower in the intervention group. Significant differences were found with respect to the EF and brain natriuretic peptide levels at 4months. No differences in clinical events (rehospitalisation/death) were reported at 4months. No severe side effects attributable to the early administration of ivabradine were observed.", 
    "197": "The early coadministration of ivabradine and beta-blockers during hospital admission for acute HFrEF is feasible and safe, and it produces a significant decrease in HR at 28days and at 4months after hospital discharge. It also seemed to improve systolic function and functional and clinical parameters of HF patients at short-term.", 
    "198": "The objective of the present work was to develop Immediate Release (IR) tablets of Metoprolol Tartrate (MT) and to compare trial formulations to a reference product. Six formulations (F1-F6) were designed using central composite method and compared to a reference brand (A). Two marketed products (brands B and C) were also evaluated. F1-F6 were prepared with Avicel PH101 (filler), Crospovidone (disintegrant) and Magnesium Stearate (lubricant) by direct compression. Pharmacopoeial and non-pharmacopoeial methods were used to assess their quality. Furthermore, drug profiles were characterized using model dependent and independent (f(2)) approaches. Brands B and C and F5 and F6 did not qualify the tests for content uniformity. Moreover, brand B did not meet weight variation criteria and brand C did not satisfy requirements for single point dissolution test. Of the trial formulations, F2 failed the test for uniformity in thickness while F4 did not disintegrate within time limit. Only F1 and F3 met all quality parameters and were subjected to accelerated stability testing without significant alterations in their physicochemical characteristics. Based on AIC and r(2)(adjusted) values obtained by applying various kinetic models, drug release was determined to most closely follow Hixson-Crowell cube root law. F1 was determined to be the optimized formulation.", 
    "199": "Although sinus node dysfunction (SND) and atrial arrhythmias frequently coexist and interact, the putative mechanism linking the 2 remain unclear. Although SND is accompanied by atrial myocardial structural changes in the right atrium, atrial fibrillation (AF) is a disease of variable interactions between left atrial triggers and substrate most commonly of left atrial origin. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of the genetic and pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the development and progression of SND and AF. Although some patients manifest SND as a result of electric remodeling induced by periods of AF, others develop progressive atrial structural remodeling that gives rise to both conditions together. The treatment strategy will thus vary according to the predominant disease phenotype. Although catheter ablation will benefit patients with predominantly AF and secondary SND, cardiac pacing may be the mainstay of therapy for patients with predominant fibrotic atrial cardiomyopathy. This contemporary review summarizes current knowledge on sinus node pathophysiology with the broader goal of yielding insights into the complex relationship between sinus node disease and atrial arrhythmias.", 
    "200": "To assess the effect of allopurinol use on the risk of incident atrial fibrillation (AF) in the elderly.", 
    "201": "We used the 5% random Medicare Claims data from 2006 to 2012 to examine the association of allopurinol use and incident AF in a cohort of patients with an absence of AF at baseline (at least 365\u2005days). Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses compared allopurinol exposed and non-exposed periods for the risk of AF, controlling for age, sex, race, Charlson-Romano comorbidity index and use of statins, diuretics, ACE inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers. HR with 95% CIs was calculated. Sensitivity analyses considered a longer baseline period (365 days vs 183\u2005days) and individual comorbidities.", 
    "202": "There were 9244 episodes of incident allopurinol use in 8569 beneficiaries, of which 1366 episodes (14.8%) had incident AF. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, allopurinol use was associated with an HR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.93) for incident AF. In a separate multivariable-adjusted model, compared with no allopurinol use, longer allopurinol use durations were associated with a lower HR of AF: 180\u2005days-2\u2005years, 0.85 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.99) and >2\u2005years, 0.65 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.82). Other factors significantly associated with a higher hazard of AF were: age 75-<85 years and \u226585 years, higher Charlson index score and current \u03b2-blocker use. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings with minimal/no attenuation of HRs.", 
    "203": "Allopurinol use was associated with a reduced risk of incident AF in the elderly, especially its use for >6\u2005months duration. Future studies should assess the mechanisms underlying this beneficial effect of allopurinol.", 
    "204": "Modulation of myometrial spontaneity by cadmium (Cd) and its regulatory pathways was studied in rat uterus in the absence and presence of blockers of different signaling pathways. Isometric tension in myometrial strips, under a resting tension of 1 g, mounted in organ bath containing Ringer-Locke solution (RLS) continuously aerated with carbogen, was measured using data acquisition system-based physiograph and Lab Chart Pro V7.3.7 software. Mean integral tension was measured for 8 min. Cd (1 nM-0.1 mM) not only produced concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on rat myometrium but it (10 \u00b5M) also significantly ( p < 0.05) inhibited calcium chloride and BAY K-8644-induced myometrial contraction. Glybenclamide (10 \u00b5M), 4-aminopyridine (1 mM), and propranolol (10 \u00b5M) failed to significantly attenuate Cd-induced inhibitory responses, while L-NAME (0.1 mM), 1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 25 \u00b5M), and 9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine (SQ 22536; 1 \u00b5M) significantly ( p < 0.05) produced inhibitory effects on Cd-induced myometrial relaxation. Phenylephrine (1 nM-10 \u00b5M) and salbutamol (0.01 nM-0.1 \u00b5M)-induced relaxant effects on rat myometrium were significantly potentiated by 10 \u00b5M Cd. Thus based on the results of present functional study, it may be inferred that inhibitory effects of Cd on rat myometrium are mediated through blockade of L-type calcium channels and activation of NOS-NO-sGC and/or AC-cAMP pathways.", 
    "205": "Anaphylaxis is an acute, life-threatening, multisystem syndrome resulting from the sudden release of mediators derived from mast cells and basophils. Food allergens are the main triggers of anaphylaxis, accounting for 33%-56% of all cases and up to 81% of cases of anaphylaxis in children. Human anaphylaxis is generally thought to be mediated by IgE, with mast cells and basophils as key players, although alternative mechanisms have been proposed. Neutrophils and macrophages have also been implicated in anaphylactic reactions, as have IgG-dependent, complement, and contact system activation. Not all allergic reactions are anaphylactic, and the presence of the so-called accompanying factors (cofactors or augmenting factors) may explain why some conditions lead to anaphylaxis, while in other cases the allergen elicits a milder reaction or is even tolerated. In the presence of these factors, allergic reactions may be induced at lower doses of allergen or become more severe. Cofactors are reported to be relevant in up to 30% of anaphylactic episodes. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and exercise are the best-documented cofactors, although estrogens, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, and alcohol have also been involved. The mechanisms underlying anaphylaxis are complex and involve several interrelated pathways. Some of these pathways may be key to the development of anaphylaxis, while others may only modulate the severity of the reaction. An understanding of predisposing and augmenting factors could lead to the development of new prophylactic and therapeutic approaches.", 
    "206": "Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) is an important member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily, with 57 CYP2C9 allelic variants being previously reported. Recently, we identified 22 novel alleles (*36 -*56 and N418T) in the Han Chinese population. This study aims to assess the catalytic activities of wild-type (CYP2C9*1) and 36 CYP2C9 allelic variants found in the Chinese population toward phenytoin (PHT) in\u00a0vitro. Insect microsomes expressing CYP2C9*1 and 36 CYP2C9 variants were incubated with 1-200\u00a0\u03bcM phenytoin for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Then, these products were extracted and the signal detection was performed by HPLC-MS/MS. The intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) values of all variants, with the exception of CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*11, CYP2C9*23, CYP2C9*29, CYP2C9*34, CYP2C9*38, CYP2C9*44, CYP2C9*46 and CYP2C9*48, were significantly different from CYP2C9*1. CYP2C9*27, *40, *41, *47, *49, *51, *53, *54, *56 and N418T variant exhibited markedly larger values than CYP2C9*1 (>152.8%), whereas 17 variants exhibited smaller values (from 48.6% to 99.9%) due to larger Km and/or smaller Vmax values than CYP2C9*1. The findings suggest that more attention should be paid on subjects carrying these infrequent CYP2C9 alleles when administering phenytoin in clinic.", 
    "207": "Reactive astrogliosis is widely considered to contribute to pathogenic responses to stress and brain injury and to diseases as diverse as ischemia and neurodegeneration. We previously found that expression of the intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (KCa3.1) involved in TGF-\u03b2-activated astrogliosis. In the present study, we investigated whether migration of cortical astrocytes following mechanical scratch injury involves the KCa3.1 channel, which contributes to Ca(2+)-mediated migration in other cells. We found that scratch injury increased the expression of KCa3.1 protein in reactive astrocytes. Application of the KCa3.1 blocker TRAM-34 decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression and slowed migration in a concentration-dependent manner. Application of the Ca(2+) chelators, EGTA and BAPTA-AM, also slowed the migration of astrocytes. Blockade or genetic deletion of KCa3.1 both slowed and dramatically reduced the scratch injuries induced the sharp rise in astrocytes Ca(2+) concentrations. The scratch injury-induced phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun proteins was also attenuated both by blockade of KCa3.1 with TRAM-34 and in KCa3.1(-/-) astrocytes. Using KCa3.1 knockout mice, we further confirmed that deletion of KCa3.1 reduced expression of GFAP in an in vivo stab wound model. Taken together, our findings highlight a novel role for KCa3.1 in phenotypic modulation of reactive astrocytes and in astrocyte mobilization in response to mechanical stress, providing a potential target for therapeutic intervention in brain injuries.", 
    "208": "There is a growing weight of evidence to suggest that myocardial contractility is an important parameter to assess as part of IND enabling studies in addition to standard assessments as per the ICH S7A and S7B guidelines. Historically, assessments of contractility have been limited to snap-shot echocardiography or single housed telemetry assessments of left ventricular pressure. There is a growing number of studies showing that social housing conditions in large animals are beneficial, do not impact the integrity of the data collected and improve animal welfare. With current advances in cardiovascular technology it is now feasible to conduct cardiovascular assessments under group housing conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate baseline hemodynamic parameters, within a group housed environment, and to demonstrate that the model retains the sensitivity of the traditional assessments.", 
    "209": "Four animals were instrumented with DSI HD-L21 implants for continuous 24-hour assessment of systemic arterial pressures, left ventricular pressures, heart rate and electrocardiogram intervals in group housed conditions. The animals were administered either Atenolol (0.3, 1 and 3mg/kg), a known negative inotrope, or Pimobendan (0.1, 0.3 and 1mg/kg), a known positive inotrope.", 
    "210": "The results showed that group housing had no influence on baseline hemodynamic assessments as compared to historical data from single housed animals. The administration of Atenolol and Pimobendan induced the expected changes in cardiovascular parameters.", 
    "211": "The baseline hemodynamic parameters remained within physiological ranges and were not influenced by group housing conditions. The model retained sensitivity to detect the expected changes in contractility in line with known effects of Atenolol and Pimobendan in dogs. In conclusion, the use of social housing conditions in dogs provides an enriched environment, compliant with animal welfare recommendations, and is in line with the ICH S7A safety pharmacology guidelines, while retaining sensitivity to detect changes in myocardial contractility."
