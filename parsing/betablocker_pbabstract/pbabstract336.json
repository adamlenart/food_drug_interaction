    "2": "Treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, angiotensin receptor antagonists and novel beta blockers such as carvedilol, has been shown to result in regression of the altered structure of small arteries in different vascular beds, in addition to improved endothelium-dependent relaxation. Several studies in hypertensive patients have now shown that treatment with some ACE inhibitors (cilazapril and perindopril) or extended release calcium channel antagonists (nifedipine GITS) induces similar effects in small arteries obtained from gluteal subcutaneous biopsies: both structure and endothelium-dependent relaxation improve under treatment. In contrast, hypertensive patients with equally well-controlled blood pressure but treated with the beta blocker atenolol did not in any of three studies exhibit any improvement in the structure of small arteries or in endothelial function.", 
    "3": "Although treatment for at least one year with some ACE inhibitors and extended release calcium channel antagonists corrects the structure and endothelium-dependent relaxation of gluteal subcutaneous small arteries, it still remains to be determined whether this apparently beneficial effect beyond blood pressure lowering of these and other agents with vascular protective properties will result in reduced morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients.", 
    "4": "Arterial hypertension used to be the most common cause of congestive left ventricular failure. With the availability and common use of antihypertensive treatment the incidence and prevalence of hypertension-induced left ventricular failure has gradually declined. Today congestive heart failure due to underlying coronary heart disease is by far more common than the hypertension-induced variety. The effect of treatment of left ventricular failure in recent years, in particular with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and carvedilol, has been impressive.", 
    "5": "The effects of chronic treatment with the beta 3-adrenergic receptor agonist CGP-12177 on uncoupling protein (UCP) synthesis in interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT), various white fat depots and skeletal muscle have been examined in the mouse (daily injection for 15 days at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg). The treatment increased the IBAT UCP content and led to the expression of UCP in inguinal white adipose tissue. The increase in IBAT UCP content took place in the absence of tissue hypertrophy, and despite the increase in total body UCP content, no changes in body weight were observed after the treatment. The results confirm that ectopic expression of UCP in non-BAT tissues can be induced after chronic adrenergic stimulation.",

    "8": "Low measures of standard deviation of normal R-R intervals, standard deviation of the mean R-R intervals of 5 minutes, and two spectral components of heart rate variability were found in patients who had had an event compared with patients with no event. Adjusted for severity of angina, the presence of a previous myocardial infarction, and the use of beta-blockers in a logistic regression model this relation remained statistically significant for SDNN. Healthy volunteers appeared to have the highest measures of heart rate variability.",

    "10": "We developed a method for measuring left ventricular maximal isovolumetric pressure (LVMIP) in intact rats and applied it in the presence of acutely administered antihypertensive drugs and in experimental diabetes mellitus. The combination of a 2 French Fogarty arterial embolectomy balloon catheter with a new ultra-thin shaft (0.25 mm diameter) Millar ultra-miniature pressure tip catheter was used. Closed-chest, thiopental anaesthetized female Sprague-Dawley rats received the beta-adrenoceptor blocker metoprolol (1 mg/kg/h), the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin (0.1 mg/kg/h), and the calcium antagonist nifedipine (0.5 mg/kg/h). They were applied as continuous i.v. infusion for 30 minutes. The angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist losartan (3 mg/kg) was applied as bolus i.v. injection. Diabetes mellitus was induced by a single tail vein injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) five weeks prior to hemodynamic measurements. Under control conditions, left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) was 136.5 +/- 3.7 mmHg and increased to 263 +/- 5.4 mmHg when the balloon was inflated (LVMIP). LVSP was significantly lower in the presence of prazosin, metoprolol, nifedipine, and in diabetic rats. However, LVMIP was significantly reduced only in the metoprolol-treated and diabetic rats. Both LVSP and LVMIP did not change significantly in losartan-treated rats. The degree of the increase in left ventricular maximal isovolumetric pressure during balloon inflation (LVMIP-LVSP) was not significantly different in any experimental condition. These results suggest that the mechanism for evoking LVMIP is not dependent on the acute stimulation of cardiac alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, on calcium channels, nor on the AT1 receptors. In addition, the intrinsic mechanism for the generation of LVMIP seems not to be influenced in the diabetic state.",

    "12": "Experiments were carried out during the dark phase, in conscious rabbits conditioned to a schedule of alternating 12-hour periods of light and dark. The blood-aqueous barrier permeability and the aqueous flow rate were determined fluorophotometrically. The effect on outflow to general blood circulation and uveoscleral outflow were determined by using the fluorophotometric Diamox technique, and the effect on the uveoscleral outflow was further assessed by using the anterior chamber perfusion method. The ONH circulation was estimated by using the laser speckle method.", 
    "13": "Unilateral topical administration of 0.25% nipradilol solution lowered intraocular pressure (IOP) with relatively weak contralateral effects in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum reduction of 6 mm Hg and an effect duration of 6 hours. Twice-daily instillation for 14 days showed no attenuation of the effects. Single instillation of 0.25% nipradilol showed no significant effect on blood-aqueous barrier permeability and decreased aqueous flow rate in the treated eye (17%; P < 0.01) and in the contralateral eye (9%, P < 0.05). Nipradilol produced no significant effect on outflow facility to general blood circulation, whereas it substantially increased uveoscleral outflow. Twice-daily 0.25% nipradilol instillation increased ONH tissue blood velocity by 13% (P < 0.01), which was probably attributable to locally penetrating drug.", 
    "14": "Because of its ability to lower IOP and to increase uveoscleral outflow and optic nerve head circulation in rabbits, further studies are warranted to determine whether nipradilol has potential as an antiglaucoma agent in humans.", 
    "15": "This article reviews the information derived from various large-scale multicentre studies, summarizes current concepts concerning the mechanisms of action of beta-blockers in heart failure and recalls their modalities of use in this indication. A beneficial effect of beta-blockers on survival has not yet been formally demonstrated. However, the promising results of preliminary trials and progress in the concepts concerning the mechanism of action of beta-blockers suggest that ongoing studies will eliminate any doubts concerning this favourable effect. The action of beta-blockers in heart failure has not yet been entirely elucidated. The multiple mechanisms proposed are situated at various levels, from the organ itself to the subcellular and molecular level. Recent ideas concerning reverse remodelling of the ventricle, correction of altered genetic expression and protection against apoptosis are interdependent and particularly fascinating. The practical use of beta-blockers in this indication is specific and implementation of this treatment requires compliance with several rules, the most important of which are to start treatment at very low doses and to increase the dosage only very gradually.",

    "20": "At the end of each treatment period the 24 hour heart rate variability, heart rate variability power spectra during head up tilt and mental stress, baroreflex sensitivity, and exercise performance were evaluated.", 
    "21": "During daytime activity and during orthostatic and mental stress, both heart rate and the ratio between the low and high frequency spectral components of the heart rate variability were significantly lower with atenolol. Conversely, there was no difference between treatments in baroreflex sensitivity and resting plasma catecholamines. Exercise duration and peak oxygen consumption did not differ between treatments, but the heart rate during submaximal and peak exercise was significantly lower with atenolol.", 
    "22": "At the doses used in this study, atenolol achieved greater beta(1) adrenergic blockade than metoprolol CR and this was associated with significant inhibition of vagal withdrawal during stress. This suggests that peripheral blockade of beta(1) adrenergic receptors may be more important than central blockade in preventing stress induced vagal withdrawal in patients after myocardial infarction.", 
    "23": "Numerous developments in our knowledge of arrhythmias during the past decade or so have had a major influence on antiarrhythmic drug therapy. It has become increasingly evident that arrhythmias merit treatment not only for the relief of symptoms, with improvement in quality of life, but also for the prolongation of survival by decreasing arrhythmic deaths. No longer can mere suppression of arrhythmias, symptomatic or asymptomatic, be equated with prolonged survival. We now know that antiarrhythmic drugs that act by blocking sodium channels can increase mortality and that the most important determinants of arrhythmia mortality are the degree and nature of ventricular dysfunction. To these considerations must be added the advances in nonpharmacologic approaches to controlling cardiac arrhythmias. There has been a shift to the use of implantable devices and of drugs with alternative modes of action, such as beta blockers and class III drugs (e.g., sotalol, amiodarone). However, the side-effect profiles of these 2 classes of compounds have led to the synthesis and characterization of agents that act simply by blocking > or = 1 membrane ion channels. The isolated block of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) has been associated with potent antifibrillatory activity in the atria, with a neutral (e.g., with dofetilide) or deleterious (with d-sotalol) effect on mortality in postinfarct survivors. Therefore, the focus now is on compounds that can block > 1 ion channel (e.g., tedisamil and azimilide). Azimilide is the first of the class III agents that blocks both components of the delayed rectifier potassium current. The drug's overall action is associated with a spectrum of electrophysiologic properties that hold promise in the control of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, with potential for improving survival in patients at risk for cardiac arrest.",

    "26": "Twenty six cirrhotic patients were given either 80 mg propranolol, 20 mg ISMN, or a combination of the two drugs. Unilateral renal blood flow (RBF), azygos blood flow (AZBF), hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded prior to and one hour after drug administration.", 
    "27": "Propranolol caused a reduction in HR (p < 0.005), AZBF (p < 0.01), and HVPG (p = 0.05), but no change in MAP or RBF (454.1 (77.3) versus 413.9 (60.3) ml/min). ISMN reduced MAP (p < 0.005) and HVPG (p < 0.01), but had no effect on HR, AZBF, or RBF (302.5 (49.4) versus 301.7 (58.8) ml/min). Combined treatment reduced MAP (p < 0.005), AZBF (p < 0.05), and HVPG (p = 0.002), but HR and RBF (419.2 (62.6) versus 415.1 (61.1) ml/min) remained unchanged.",

No significant difference in subjective tolerance, corneal aesthesiometry, punctuate keratitis, Schirmer's test, intraocular pressure (IOP) decrease (about 25% in the two groups at 3 hours, 10% after 3 days of treatment), resting cardiac frequency, or blood pressure was observed. However, break up time was significantly reduced from baseline by preserved carteolol both at 3 hours (10.40 (5.9) seconds to 6.15 (3.9) seconds, p = 0.001) and after 3 days (7.72 (5.5) seconds, p = 0.04). Preservative free carteolol did not significantly change the break up time (baseline 9.08 (5.7) seconds; 3 hours = 7.88 (5.5) seconds, not significant; day 3 = 8.35 (5.8), non-significant).", 
    "32": "These results confirm that carteolol is well tolerated, either with or without preservative. The preservative free group showed better stability of the tear film, without loss of effect on IOP. This difference, although mild in the healthy young subjects in the present study could be much more relevant in those patients treated long term, older patients, and/or those suffering from ocular surface disorders. In such instances, preservative free drugs could be of potential benefit to protect the lacrimal fluid integrity and corneoconjunctival surface.", 
    "33": "In order to assess additional anti-ischaemic effects of amlodipine (AML) on coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with beta-blockers, 32 patients with CAD, verified on angiograms, and stable angina were randomized to receive 5 mg/day of AML or placebo, increasing to 10 mg/day after 2 weeks. Baseline recording of 24-h ambulatory ECG and blood pressure, echocardiography and bicycle exercise test was repeated after treatment for 2 weeks and for 6 weeks. Reduction of ambulatory ischaemia was not significantly greater with AML than with placebo. In exercise tests the time to 0.1 mV ST segment depression and the total exercise time remained unaltered. Blood pressure was reduced by 10 mg AML. The total variability and the very low frequency component of heart rate were reduced after both doses. The clinical significance of the possible unfavourable change in autonomic modulation of the heart in CAD patients is not known.", 
    "34": "It has been proposed that the arylalkylamine, (-)pindolol, potentiates the therapeutic action of antidepressant drugs in humans by blockade of 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Its interactions at human 5-HT1A receptors have not, however, been directly characterized. Herein, we demonstrate that (-)pindolol exhibits nanomolar affinity at human 5-HT1A receptors expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO-h5-HT1A; Ki = 6.4 nmol/L). In a functional test of receptor-mediated G-protein activation (stimulation of [35S]-GTP gamma S binding) (-)pindolol displays an efficacy of 20.3% relative to the endogenous agonist, 5-HT (= 100%). (-)Pindolol also antagonizes 5-HT (100 nmol/L)-stimulated [35S]-GTP gamma S binding, reducing it to 19.8% of control binding. These data indicate that (-)pindolol acts as a (weak) partial agonist at CHO-h5-HT1A receptors and that it blocks the action of 5-HT at these sites.", 
    "35": "When humans ascend to high altitude (ALT) their plasma volume (PV) and total blood volume (BV) decrease during the first few days. With continued residence over several weeks, the hypoxia-induced stimulation of erythropoietin increases red cell production which tends to restore BV. Because hypoxia also activates the beta-adrenergic system, which stimulates red blood cell production, we investigated the effect of adrenergic beta-receptor inhibition with propranolol on fluid volumes and the polycythemic response in 11 healthy unacclimatized men (21-33 years old exposed to an ALT of 4300 m (barometric pressure 460 Torr) for 3 weeks on Pikes Peak, Colorado. PV was determined by the Evans blue dye method (PVEB), BV by the carbon monoxide method (BVCO), red cell volume (RCV) was calculated from hematocrit (Hct) and BVCO, and serum erythropoietin concentration ([EPO]) and reticulocyte count, were also determined. All determinations were made at sea level and after 9-11 (ALT-10) and 19-20 (ALT-20) days at ALT. At sea level and ALT, six men received propranolol (pro, 240 mg x day[-1]), and five received a placebo (pla). Effective beta-blockade did not modify the mean (SE) maximal values of [EPO] [pla: 24.9 (3.5) vs pro: 24.5 (1.5) mU x ml(-1)] or reticulocyte count [pla: 2.7 (0.7) vs pro: 2.2 (0.5)%]; nor changes in PVEB [pla: -15.8 (3.8) vs pro: -19.9 (2.8)%], RCVCO [pla: +7.0 (6.7) vs pro: + 10.1 (6.1)%], or BVCO [pla: -7.3 (2.3) vs pro: -7.1 (3.9)%]. In the absence of weight loss, a redistribution of body water with no net loss is implied. Hence, activation of the beta-adrenergic system did not appear to affect the hypovolemic or polycythemic responses that occurred during 3 weeks at 4300 m ALT in these subjects.", 
    "36": "To examine the direct effects of serotonin (5-HT) on the release and synthesis of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), 5-HT was microinjected just onto the bilateral PVN of conscious rats. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels peaked at 30 min and returned to the basal levels in 90 min. Northern blot analysis revealed that the CRF messenger RNA (mRNA) level in the PVN as well as the proopiomelanocortin mRNA level in the anterior pituitary significantly increased 120 min after the 5-HT injections (50-250 nmol/side). Pretreatment with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of pindobind 5-HT1A (5 nmol) or LY-278584 (500 nmol) completely abolished the 5-HT-induced ACTH response, whereas LY-53857 (100 nmol) was without effect. These results suggest that 5-HT stimulates CRF release, which has interactions with 5-HT1A and 5-HT3 receptors on CRF neurons in the PVN, and activates CRF synthesis in conscious rats.", 
    "37": "1. The present study was designed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of relaxation induced by the nitric oxide (NO) donor, GEA 3175 (a 3-aryl-substituted oxatriazole derivative) on bovine bronchioles (effective lumen diameter 200-800 microm) suspended in microvascular myographs for isometric tension recording. 2. In segments of bovine bronchioles contracted to 5-hydroxytryptamine, GEA 3175 (10(-8)-10(-4) M) induced concentration-dependent reproducible relaxations. These relaxations were slow in onset compared to other NO-donors such as 3-morpholinosydonimine-hydrochloride (SIN-1) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). 3. In 5-hydroxytryptamine-contracted preparations the order of relaxant potency (pD2) was: salbutamol (7.80) > GEA 3175 (6.18) > SIN-1 (4.90) > SNAP (3.55). In segments contracted to acetylcholine, the relaxant responses were reduced and GEA 3175 relaxed the bronchioles with pD2 = 4.41 +/- 0.12 and relaxations of 66 +/- 10% (n = 4), while SNAP and salbutamol caused relaxations of 19 +/- 6% (n = 4) and 27 +/- 6% (n = 8) at the highest concentration used, respectively. 4. Oxyhaemoglobin (10(-5) M), the scavenger of nitric oxide, caused rightward shifts of the concentration-relaxation curves to GEA 3175 and NO. 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, 3 x 10(-6) M) and LY 83583 (10(-6) M), the inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase, also reduced the relaxations induced by GEA 3175 and nitric oxide. However, ODQ did not affect salbutamol-evoked relaxation in the bovine small bronchioles. 5. GEA 3175-induced relaxations were reduced in potassium-rich (60 mmol l(-1) K+) solution. Glibenclamide (10(-6) M) markedly inhibited the relaxations induced by the opener of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, levcromakalim (3 x 10(-8)-10(-5) M), but it did not modify the relaxations induced by GEA 3175 or salbutamol. Apamin (5 x 10(-7) M), a blocker of the small Ca2+-activated K+-channels did not affect the relaxations to GEA 3175. In contrast, blockers of large Ca2+-activated K+-channels, charybdotoxin (3 x 10(-8)-10(-7) M) and iberiotoxin (10(-8) M), did inhibit the relaxations to GEA 3175. The combination of apamin and charybdotoxin did not induce an additional inhibitory effect on the relaxations to GEA 3175 compared to charybdotoxin alone. 6. In preparations where a concentration-response curve to GEA 3175 or NO was first obtained in the presence of LY 83583, incubation with charybdotoxin (10(-7) M) did produce an additional inhibitory effect of the relaxations. However. in the presence of ODQ (3 x 10(-6) M), iberiotoxin (10(-8) M) did not produce additional reduction of the NO- or GEA 3175-induced relaxations. 7. The present results suggest that the slow-releasing NO-donor GEA 3175 is more potent than the traditional NO donors in inducing relaxations of bovine bronchioles. GEA 3175, as for exogenously added NO, elicits relaxations through a cyclic GMP-dependent mechanism followed by opening of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+-channels.", 
    "38": "We compared the dose-response relationship and the neuromuscular blocking effects of mivacurium during infusions of esmolol in 40 anaesthetised rabbits. Train-of-four stimuli were applied every 10 s to the common peroneal nerve and the force of contraction of the tibialis anterior muscle was measured. Plasma cholinesterase activity decreased by 13% after esmolol infusion. The ED95 of mivacurium increased significantly from 29 (4.8) micrograms.kg-1 with placebo to 61 (9.8) micrograms.kg-1 during esmolol 100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, 49 (8.2) micrograms.kg-1 during esmolol 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 and 54 (7.3) micrograms.kg-1 during esmolol 500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, respectively (p < 0.001). The duration of neuromuscular block with mivacurium 0.16 mg.kg-1 was prolonged by 30% with esmolol due to diminished plasma cholinesterase activity (p < 0.05). Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 15% with esmolol (p < 0.05). The results of this study show that, in rabbits, esmolol decreased plasma cholinesterase activity, antagonised the neuromuscular blocking potency of mivacurium and prolonged its neuromuscular blocking effect.", 
    "39": "OBESITY AND RISK OF MORBIDITY: Obesity is becoming an increasingly important factor in the pathogenesis of hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes, which together with hyperinsulinemia comprise the deadly quartet of the insulin resistance syndrome. Obesity in the absence of these other factors is only a minor risk factor, but most obesity is accompanied by one or more of these, worsening the prognosis. The presence of obesity complicates the management of hypertension, probably in large part because of the concomitant insulin resistance which adds to the pathogenetic mechanisms and subtracts from the therapeutic efficacy of many antihypertensive regimens. Unfortunately, some of the agents used to reduce obesity may further aggravate the problem through their stimulation of sympathetic nervous activity. Nonetheless, in the treatment of hypertension in most obese patients who have relatively little excess risk, attempts to reduce body weight should be attempted first, through sensible dietary restrictions, increased aerobic exercise and judicious use of non-hypertensinogenic appetite suppressants. Thereby, additional motivation to lose weight may be provided by the potential of escaping or at least delaying antihypertensive drug therapy. TREATMENT OF HIGHER-RISK OBESE INDIVIDUALS: Those obese hypertensive individuals at greater risk should be immediately started on antihypertensive drug therapy along with attempts to reduce the obesity. The choice of initial and subsequent therapy should take the patient's individual needs into account. For those with dyslipidemia or diabetes, diuretics and beta-blockers should be avoided unless there are specific indications for their use (e.g. reactive sodium retention or postmyocardial infarction). In such patients, an alpha-blocker, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or a calcium antagonist may be more appropriate. If the first drug is not sufficient, combination therapy should be considered. A diuretic may be needed to overcome reactive sodium retention. Because most obese hypertensive individuals will not be able to lose much weight, effective antihypertensive drug therapy will usually be indicated.",

Left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.58 +/- 0.13. Medical treatment, coronary by-pass surgery and percutaneous myocardial revascularization were chosen in 36, 24 and 40% of cases, respectively. Coronary angioplasty was performed in our center in 58 (73%) of 80 patients at 6.8 +/- 5.6 days after admission and stents were used in 42 cases (74%). Overall hospital stay was 10.4 +/- 4 days.

    "44": "Transition from placental to pulmonary oxygenation at birth depends on a rapid removal of fetal lung fluid from the developing alveoli. Alveolar fluid clearance was examined in ventilated, anesthetized developing guinea pigs of the ages newborn, 2-d-old, 5-d-old, 30-d-old, and 60-d-old (adult). An isosmolar 5% albumin solution was instilled into the lungs of the guinea pigs; the guinea pigs were then studied for 1 h. Alveolar fluid clearance was measured from the increase in alveolar protein concentration as water was reabsorbed. Newborn guinea pigs had a very high alveolar fluid clearance rate that declined rapidly within the first 5 postnatal days towards adult levels. The high alveolar fluid clearance at birth was apparently mediated by the beta-adrenergic system as demonstrated by the elevated plasma epinephrine levels and the increased sensitivity to inhibition by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol immediately after birth. Surprisingly, exogenous addition of epinephrine was not able to stimulate alveolar fluid clearance in the newborn lung, but exogenous epinephrine stimulation increased over time to adult levels. The elevated alveolar fluid clearance at birth was associated with a significantly greater amiloride sensitivity in the newborn guinea pig lung. Northern blot analysis of distal lung tissue as well as isolated alveolar epithelial type II cells showed and confirmed higher levels of the alpha-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel mRNA in the newborn lung that rapidly tapered off toward adult levels. In conclusion, these data demonstrate the importance of the beta-adrenergic system and amiloride-sensitive sodium transporting pathways for clearance of fetal lung fluid at birth.",

Use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was generally unrelated to cancer overall or individual cancers, but both were associated with kidney cancer (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5; and RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0, respectively).",

    "53": "New Zealand White female rabbits were randomly divided into three groups, each contained six rabbits, i.e. thyroidectomized and untreated rabbits (group 1), thyroidectomized rabbits treated by the Yang tonifying herbs (group 2) and sham thyroidectomized rabbits as controls (group 3). The myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density (Bmax) and affinity (Kd) of each group of rabbits were determined by radioligand binding assay technique on the thirtieth postoperative day and the data were handled by using a computer program of the Woolf plot with weight regression. Moreover, the serum levels of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) of each group of rabbits were measured by radioimmunoassay technique and their heart rates (HR) were also recorded on the preoperative and thirtieth postoperative day. The results showed that the Bmax, T4, T3 and HR in group 1 were lower significantly than that in group 3 (P < 0.01-0.001), but the change of Kd in group 1 was not significant; the deviation of the indices from the normal value in group 2 was less remarkably than in group 1 other than T4.",

    "58": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors for improving the in vitro buoyancy and the drug release characteristics of floating minitablets containing either piretanide or atenolol as model drugs. The buoyancy of the minitablets was achieved either by the swelling of the excipient or by incorporation of the gas-generating agent sodium bicarbonate. Resultant-weight kinetics were performed in order to evaluate the buoyancy. The release rate of the poorly soluble drug piretanide was enhanced by increasing its solubility or by promoting the erosion of the minitablets. For the sparingly soluble drug atenolol, the minitablets were coated with different ratio of insoluble polymer in order to diminish the release rate of this drug. The swelling of a hydrophilic excipient was not sufficient to obtain floating minitablets. The buoyancy of the minitablets containing either piretanide or atenolol was greatly improved by adding sodium bicarbonate as well as by a wet granulation. The most satisfactory improvement in the release rate of piretanide was achieved using a solid dispersion with povidone, thus increasing the drug solubility concomitantly with the increase of the minitablets' erosion. Regarding atenolol, minitablets containing 7% sodium bicarbonate and coated with Eudragit NE30D:RS 70:30 gave satisfactory results concerning buoyancy and drug release rate. This study showed that it was possible to produce minitablets containing either piretanide or atenolol, which have a positive resultant-weight during more than 6 hr and satisfactory release profiles.",

    "60": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is present in post-ganglionic vagal nerve fibers in the coronary arteries and right ventricle but no significant amounts are found in the left ventricle. We determined the effects of VIP, released endogenously from cardiac vagal nerves, on the circumflex mean coronary artery pressure and on right and left ventricular (RV and LV) contractility (dP/dtmax) and relaxation (dP/dtmin). In 20 anesthetized, open chest mongrel dogs, the cervical vagus nerves and cardiac sympathetic ansa subclaviae were isolated and transected. Electrodes were applied to the cardiac segments of the right and left vagus nerves for subsequent stimulation. The muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked with atropine and propranolol, respectively. The heart rate was controlled by either producing atrioventricular node block in 10 dogs and pacing the ventricles (series 1) or by right atrial pacing in 10 separate dogs (series 2). Coronary artery blood flow was controlled by perfusing the circumflex coronary artery in each dog with femoral arterial blood at a controlled flow rate. Coronary artery pressure, ventricular and aortic pressures and dP/dt were continuously measured. Experiments were performed prior to and after the administration of [4Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP, a sensitive and selective VIP antagonist. Vagal nerve stimulation at 20 Hz (0.5 ms, 20 V) for 5 min significantly decreased the circumflex mean coronary artery pressure by 17% from the control value of 95+/-2 mmHg in series 1 and by 13% from the control value of 109+/-2 mmHg in series 2 (both p < 0.005). Aortic, LV and RV systolic and end-diastolic pressures, LV dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin, and the EKG did not change. In contrast, RV dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin increased by 22% (p < 0.04) and 23% (p < 0.02), respectively, in series 1 and by 26% (p < 0.02) and 33% (p < 0.01), respectively, in series 2. The VIP antagonist, [4Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP, directly injected into the left circumflex coronary artery, had no effect on coronary, aortic or ventricular pressures, ventricular dP/dt or the EKG. However, 20 Hz vagal stimulation in the presence of the VIP antagonist did not decrease circumflex mean coronary artery pressure. In addition, vagal stimulation, in the presence of the VIP antagonist, had no effect on LV pressures or dP/dt but increased RV dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin. RV dP/dtmax increased by 16% (p < 0.01) and RV dP/dtmin increased by 22% (p < 0.04), respectively, in series 1 and by 27 and 24%, respectively, in series 2 (both p < 0.01). Vagal nerve stimulation during muscarinic and beta-adrenergic blockade releases VIP or a 'VIP-like' substance that significantly decreases circumflex coronary artery vascular resistance and increases RV dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin.", 
    "61": "The sympathetic nervous system has been implicated in mediating stress-induced alterations in NK cell activity, particularly through stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. However, because catecholamines induce time-dependent alterations in the distribution of NK cells, the impact of beta-adrenergic stimulation on individual NK cell cytotoxicity is not clear, nor are its implications regarding host resistance to metastatic spread. To address these issues, we used the beta-adrenergic agonist, metaproterenol (MP), in F344 rats. The number of blood NK cells doubled within 10 min of MP administration and returned to baseline levels within 1 h. By this time, MP suppressed blood NK activity in a dose-dependent manner. Two beta-adrenergic antagonists, propranolol, which crosses the blood-brain barrier, and nadolol, which does not, blocked this suppression. Corresponding findings were obtained using an NK-sensitive tumor model, the MADB106. MP caused an up to 10 times increase in the number of tumor cells retained in the lungs 1 day after inoculation and a similar rise in the number of consequent lung metastases detected 3 wk later. These effects were dose dependent and nadolol reversible. NK cells appear to play a central role in mediating the tumor-enhancing effects of MP because their selective depletion nearly abolished this effect. Overall, our findings suggest that independent of the transitory increase in numbers of blood NK cells, in vivo beta-adrenergic stimulation suppresses NK activity in the rat. This suppression is induced peripherally and can compromise host resistance to NK-sensitive tumors. Homologies to studies in humans and clinical relevance are discussed.", 
    "62": "To determine whether there are differences in cardiac beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness, isoprenaline affinity constants and fractional beta-adrenoceptor occupancy-response relationships for isoprenaline in the early stages of established hypertension, we studied the effects of bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM) and ([3,5-diamino-6-chloro-N-(1[N-beta-(2-hydroxyl-3-alpha-naphthoxypropy lamino)ethylcarbamoyl]-1-methylethyl)-pyrazine-2-carboxamide (ICI 147 798), slowly reversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, on the isoprenaline responses of the left ventricular papillary muscle and the left and right atria of 6-month-old Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The papillary muscles, but not the right and left atria, of the SHR were less responsive to isoprenaline than those of the WKY. The isoprenaline pD2 values (the negative logarithms of the molar concentrations of agonist producing 50% of the maximum response) were 7.72 and 8.00 on the SHR and WKY papillary muscles, respectively. On the WKY papillary muscle the isoprenaline KA values were 2-3 x 10(-6) M, which is as expected for isoprenaline at beta1 or beta2-adrenoceptors. Isoprenaline had 100-fold greater affinity on the WKY and SHR left atria than on the papillary muscles; the isoprenaline KA values were 2-4 x 10(-8) M. On the WKY papillary muscle and left atrium, isoprenaline had to occupy 3-4% of the beta-adrenoceptors to produce a 50% maximum response; on the WKY papillary muscle and left atrium isoprenaline had to occupy 25-35% and 55%, respectively, of the beta-adrenoceptors to produce a 90% maximum response. The SHR papillary muscles and left atrium had smaller beta-adrenoceptor reserves for isoprenaline than did the WKY tissues. We were unable to obtain isoprenaline KA values on the WKY right atrium. The isoprenaline KA value on the SHR right atrium was 1-4 x 10(-8) M. Because the isoprenaline KA values for the left and right atria are markedly different from those previously reported for isoprenaline at beta1 or beta2-adrenoceptors, we suggest that atypical beta-adrenoceptors might be present on the atria of WKY and SHR. We have also demonstrated a lower beta-adrenoceptor reserve on SHR papillary muscle and atria in the early stages of established hypertension.",

    "65": "Cyclic nucleotides are known to modify voltage-gated (L-type) Ca2+ channel activity in vascular smooth muscle cells, but the exact mechanism(s) underlying these effects is not well defined. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the modulatory role of the cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA and PKG, respectively) pathways in Ca2+ channel function by using both conventional and perforated-patch-clamp techniques in rabbit portal vein myocytes. The membrane-permeable cAMP derivative, 8-bromo cAMP (0.1 to 10 micromol/L), significantly increased (14% to 16%) peak Ba2+ currents, whereas higher concentrations (0.05 to 0.1 mmol/L) decreased Ba2+ currents (23% to 31%). In contrast, 8-bromo cGMP inhibited Ba2+ currents at all concentrations tested (0.01 to 1 mmol/L). Basal Ca2+ channel currents were significantly inhibited by the PKA blocker 8-Bromo-2'-O-monobutyryladenosine-3',5'-monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer (Rp 8-Br-MP cAMPS, 30 micromol/L) and enhanced by the PKG inhibitor beta-Phenyl-1,N2-etheno-8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer (Rp-8-Br PET cGMPS, 10 nmol/L). In the presence of Rp 8-bromo PET cGMPS (10 to 100 nmol/L), both 8-bromo cAMP (0.1 mmol/L) and 8-bromo cGMP (0.1 mmol/L) enhanced Ba2+ currents (13% to 39%). The excitatory effect of 8-bromo cGMP was blocked by Rp 8-bromo MB-cAMPS. Both 8-bromo cAMP (0.05 mmol/L) and forskolin (10 micromol/L) elicited time-dependent effects, including an initial enhancement followed by suppression of Ba2+ currents. Ba2+ currents were also enhanced when cells were dialyzed with the catalytic subunit of PKA. This effect was reversed by the PKA blocker KT 5720 (200 nmol/L). Our results suggest that cAMP/PKA stimulation enhances and cGMP/PKG stimulation inhibits L-type Ca2+ channel activity in rabbit portal vein myocytes. Our results further suggest that both cAMP and cGMP have a primary action mediated by their own kinase as well as a secondary action mediated by the opposing kinase.", 
    "66": "The normal pancreatic beta-cell population exhibits intercellular differences in its responsiveness to glucose. This cellular heterogeneity allows glucose to regulate, in a dose-dependent manner, total rates of insulin synthesis and release. It may also predispose to intercellular differences in susceptibility to dysregulating agents. The present study examines whether this is the case for interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), which is known to suppress glucose-induced insulin synthesis and release. The effects of the cytokine were compared on beta-cell subpopulations with, respectively, high and low sensitivity to glucose. These subpopulations were separated on the basis of differences in the cellular metabolic responsiveness to an intermediate glucose concentration (7.5 mmol/liter) and then cultured for 20 h at 5 or 20 mmol/liter with or without IL-1beta. The suppressive action of IL-1beta (0.1 ng/ml) occurred predominantly in glucose-activated beta cells, reducing their high rates of insulin synthesis and release by more than 80%. Glucose-unresponsive cells became subject to a similar inhibition after their activation during culture at 20 mmol/liter glucose. On the other hand, IL-1beta induced or enhanced the expression of several noninsulin proteins in both subpopulations. The IL-1beta-stimulated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and heat shock protein 70 was more marked in the glucose-responsive subpopulation; that of heme oxygenase and Mn superoxide dismutase was comparable in the two subpopulations. Exposure to IL-1beta resulted in 10-fold higher medium nitrite levels in both subpopulations; this effect was prevented by the iNOS blocker, N(G)-methyl-L-arginine, which also prevented the IL-1beta-induced suppression in the glucose-responsive subpopulation. This study demonstrates that the cellular heterogeneity in glucose responsiveness predisposes to intercellular differences in the IL-1-induced suppression of insulin synthesis and release. While the cytokine induces the expression of noninsulin proteins such as iNOS in both glucose responsive and unresponsive cells, the subsequent nitric oxide production appears to predominantly affect glucose-stimulated functions in the glucose-activated cells.", 
    "67": "Until recently, clinical management of congestive heart failure was purely palliative. The drugs used in patients with failing hearts--digoxin, vasodilators, and positive inotropic agents--improved contractility, reversed hemodynamic abnormalities, and enhanced functional status, but they failed to confer a survival benefit. Indeed, the use of inotropic agents often resulted in excess mortality--a paradox explained in part by the pharmacological properties of these agents, which increase production of cAMP, the intracellular messenger for the beta-adrenergic system. The short-term pharmacological benefits of these drugs may be offset by deleterious long-term biological effects on the heart muscle itself. The use of beta-blockers in heart failure is counterintuitive, given that their initial pharmacological effect is to reduce heart rate and contractility in a faltering heart, thus producing an effect diametrically opposed to that of inotropic agents. However, it is becoming more clear that beta-blocker therapy in patients with heart failure not only improves left ventricular function, but may actually reverse pathological remodeling in the heart. Accumulating clinical evidence indicates that these beneficial changes are the result of secondary biological changes in the myocardium rather than a response to the pharmacological effects of the drugs themselves. Mounting evidence suggest that these agents may prolong survival in patients with heart failure, and ongoing clinical trials may soon confirm these preliminary findings.",

Calcium antagonists and oral nitrates are also widely prescribed for patients with coronary disease, but their effect on presentation of acute myocardial ischemia is unknown. We retrospectively examined the effects of prior aspirin and anti-ischemic medical therapy on clinical events in 410 patients hospitalized for unstable angina. Ischemic pain occurred at rest for a duration of 5 to 60 minutes. During hospitalization, 97% of patients received aspirin and all received the direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin for at least 72 hours. Despite being older and more likely to have risk factors for coronary disease and poor outcome, patients receiving aspirin before admission were less likely to present with non-Q-wave AMI (5% vs 14% in patients not on aspirin, p = 0.004). Prior beta blocker, calcium antagonist, or nitrate administration did not appear to modify presentation as unstable angina or non-Q-wave AMI. In a multivariate model, the combined incidence of death, AMI not present at enrollment, or recurrent angina was best predicted by age (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 2.38 [1.14 to 3.98]) and presence of electrocardiographic changes with pain on presentation (adjusted odds ratio 2.83 [1.50 to 5.35]) but was not related to prior or in-hospital medical therapy. Thus, aspirin but not anti-ischemic therapy before hospitalization of patients with unstable angina was associated with a decreased incidence of non-Q-wave AMI on admission.", 
    "83": "Ample experimental evidence indicates that acute beta-amyloid infusion into the nucleus basalis of rats elicits abrupt degeneration of the magnocellular cholinergic neurons projecting to the cerebral cortex. In fact, involvement of a permanent Ca2+ overload, partially via N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, was proposed as a pivotal mechanism in beta-amyloid-induced neurodegeneration. A definite measure of NMDA receptor-mediated processes and subsequent Ca2+ entry is the induction of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in nerve cells. In the present account we therefore assessed activation of nNOS in correlation with cholinergic decline after beta-amyloid(1-42) or beta-amyloid(25-35) infusion into the rat nucleus basalis. The results demonstrate the beta-amyloid conformation-dependent enhancement of cortical nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Furthermore, chronic application of the polyamine site NMDA receptor blocker ifenprodil effectively attenuated beta-amyloid neurotoxicity. We propose that nNOS activation reflects the degree of beta-amyloid-induced excitotoxic injury in a proportional manner. Moreover, Ca2+-mediated processes via NMDA receptors, or direct binding of beta-amyloid to this receptor may be a critical step in the neurotoxic mechanisms in vivo.", 
    "84": "The hypothalamic neural mechanisms that are involved in the facilitatory effects of the amygdala (AMG) on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis have been investigated in rats. Stimulation of the central AMG nucleus caused a depletion of hypothalamic CRF-41, presumably due to its release into the portal circulation, and a subsequent rise in plasma ACTH and corticosterone (CS) levels. These effects were inhibited in rats in which hypothalamic norepinephrine (NE) or serotonin (5-HT) was depleted by catecholamine or serotonin neurotoxins, respectively. Furthermore, the administration of prazosin, an alpha1, but not of atenolol, which is a beta-blocker, as well as administration of the 5-HT2 blocker ketanserin inhibited the ACTH and CS responses to AMG stimulation. These results indicate that the facilitatory effects of the AMG on the HPA axis are mediated by hypothalamic NE via alpha1 receptors and by 5-HT via 5-HT2 receptors, as well as by CRF-41 in the paraventricular nucleus.", 
    "85": "Racemic albuterol has been one of the most widely used beta2-adrenoceptor agonists for the relief of the symptoms of asthma, yet the use of beta2 agonists has been known to induce bronchial hyperresponsiveness. To probe a possible role of the S-enantiomer for hyperresponsiveness, we determined the effects of (S)-albuterol on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in dissociated bovine tracheal smooth muscle cells. Both (S)-and (R,S)-albuterol increased [Ca2+]i at concentrations of >10 pM and 1 nM, respectively, with a maximal response by 150 and 100 nM, respectively. (S)-Albuterol (1 and 10 muM) induced Ca2+ oscillations, reaching 1-2 muM [Ca2+]i. This response is in a stark contrast to that of (R)-albuterol, which decreased [Ca2+]i. The increase in [Ca2+]i was blocked by 100 nM atropine or 500 nM 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine but was insensitive to the beta2 antagonist ICI 118,551 (10 muM). (S)-Albuterol (10 muM) increased inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate levels by 213 +/- 34.4% (p < 0.05, four experiments) in cells exposed for 30 sec. The sustained phase of the Ca2+ increase was absent in Ca2+-free solution, suggesting that Ca2+ influx was responsible for the sustained Ca2+ response. The results also suggest that (S)-albuterol may cross-react with muscarinic receptors. As a Ca2+ agonist in airway smooth muscle, (S)-albuterol may have profound clinical implications because 50% of prescribed racemic albuterol is composed of (S)-albuterol.", 
    "86": "The goal of this study was to examine whether chronic administration of propranolol offers protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury and whether it induces any change in the myocardial endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities and their gene expression. Rats were treated with propranolol (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for either 6 or 18 days. Forty-eight h after the last propranolol injection, isolated hearts were subjected to 60 min of global ischemia and 40 min of reperfusion. Resting tension in the control and treated groups after ischemia was 385+/-30 and 150+/-15%; and upon reperfusion was 140+/-11 and 49+/-6%, respectively, as compared to the pre-ischemic values. Recovery of the contractile function in globally ischemic hearts upon reperfusion was about 35% in the treated group as compared to about 16% in the control group at 10 and 20 min. A positive response to catecholamine was observed in hearts from propranolol group (C, 3.41+/-0.36; epi, 6.03+/-0.47 g/g) and was comparable to control hearts (C, 3.55+/-0.31; epi, 6.48+/-0.42 g/g). Myocardial antioxidants, catalase and glutathione peroxidase enzyme activities, in the treated group, prior to ischemia-reperfusion were increased by 67+/-9 and 45+/-11%, respectively, over those in controls. Superoxide dismutase activity did not show any change. The mRNA expression for the three antioxidant enzymes did not change in the hearts of the treated group as compared to control. Lipid peroxidation, both before and after the ischemia-reperfusion episode, was significantly reduced in the propranolol-treated hearts compared to the control group. Hearts studied at the end of reperfusion showed no difference in enzyme activities between treated and control groups. These data show that propranolol treatment of the animals protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury in isolated hearts in the absence of beta-blockade. Increased endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities due to propranolol treatment may have a role in this protection.",

These changes were significantly correlated with calculations of preload-adjusted maximal power using aortic flow (r = 0.90, SEE 10.5 mW/cm4) and load-independent measures of end-systolic elastance from pressure-area loops (r = 0.90, SEE 10.6 mW/cm4). Calculations of normalized preload-adjusted maximal power using arterial pressure were also closely correlated with similar calculations using LV pressure (r = 0.99, SEE 3%).", 
    "91": "Preload-adjusted maximal power using echocardiographic ABD can predict LV contractile state relatively independent of loading conditions and has potential for clinical application.", 
    "92": "Glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis are common morphological correlates of many end-stage kidneys. There is ample evidence that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays a major role in these alterations by directly stimulating synthesis of many extracellular matrix components and reducing collagenase production, finally leading to renal scarring. Although many factors may induce TGF-beta expression in the kidney, one very interesting aspect is the link between angiotensin II (ANG II) and TGF-beta. Originating from observations in vascular smooth muscle cells, there are now several additional studies showing that ANG II stimulates TGF-beta expression in the kidney. Although cell culture studies have convincingly demonstrated that the vasoactive peptide directly stimulates transcription as well as bioactivation of TGF-beta, the in vivo evidence is more indirect. Nevertheless, there are several pathophysiological situations including unilateral ureteral obstruction, chronic cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity, various models of hypertension, and probably diabetic nephropathy in which ANG II-mediated TGF-beta induction has been demonstrated to play an important role in the progression of the disease. The fascinating aspect of this relationship between ANG II and TGF-beta is the fact that hemodynamic changes as well as structural changes are linked together generating a unifying model of progression of chronic renal failure with ANG II as the key player. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and the more recently introduced AT1-receptor blocker may be potential drugs to interfere with this ANG II-mediated TGF-beta expression. Therefore, these drugs should not only be considered as antihypertensive medications, but should rather be viewed as renoprotective substances influencing renal remodeling by preventing local TGF-beta expression.", 
    "93": "The present study was conducted to investigate if personality traits can be usefully related to serotonergic vs. dopaminergic action of the 5-HT1a-antagonist +/- pindolol. Forty healthy male volunteers (aged between 20 and 30 years) were randomly assigned to a placebo or a +/- pindolol (30 mg, oral dose) group in a double blind trial. Blood samples were drawn and analyzed for PRL concentrations. In addition, the subjects completed questionnaires on personality. The results indicated that +/- pindolol decreases PRL concentrations depending on personality. While subjects high on impulsivity and related traits (aggression and disinhibition) show lower PRL decreases, well-being and personality traits frequently related to dopaminergic activity were not correlated with changes in PRL. Since reduced (blunted) PRL-responses after 5-HT challenge tests have been reported for impulsives, the present results favor the involvement of primarily serotonergic and probably only secondarily dopaminergic control of +/- pindolol induced PRL decreases.", 
    "94": "The importance of the adrenergic nervous system in support of hemodynamics in patients with congestive heart failure has been known for a long time. Thus, when beneficial effects of beta-blocker therapy in patients with resistant congestive heart failure were reported more than two decades ago, such an approach was deemed counterintuitive. Despite the skepticism, numerous reports, including well-planned, randomized studies, confirmed the beneficial effects of various beta-blockers on congestive heart failure. Recently, a new generation of beta-blocker, carvedilol (Coreg), which combines nonselective beta-blocking and vasodilating properties, was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of congestive heart failure. This article is a brief historical review of the literature regarding the use of beta-blockers for the treatment of congestive heart failure.", 
    "95": "Four antihypertensive agents - amlodipine, verapamil, propranolol and perindoprilat - were studied in human cell cultures. Antiatherogenic activity was investigated using uninvolved human aortic smooth muscle intima cells and atherogenic serum obtained from patients with coronary atherosclerosis. Amlodipine and verapamil significantly inhibited serum-induced increases in cholesterol content, cell-proliferative activity and protein synthesis in the cultured cells. Propranolol increased all three parameters, while perindoprilat had no effects. In addition, amlodipine and verapamil significantly lowered the intracellular cholesterol content of smooth muscle cells derived from atherosclerotic plaque and inhibited cell proliferation and protein synthesis. Propranolol increased all of these parameters, while perindoprilat produced no effects. The antiatherogenic and antiatherosclerotic actions of verapamil and amlodipine were confirmed in an ex vivo model. These studies demonstrated a beneficial antiatherosclerotic effect of amlodipine that was greater than that of verapamil. Perindoprilat had a neutral effect on atherosclerotic parameters, while the action of propranolol appeared to be potentially detrimental.", 
    "96": "Beta-blockers reduce sympathetic tone, increase vagal tone and improve prognosis in ischaemic heart disease. Nitroglycerin, being a vasodilator, may theoretically have an opposite effect and worsen the prognosis. The purpose of the present study was to analyse heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects autonomic tone, in angina patients on isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) and/or metoprolol.", 
    "97": "Thirty-two patients (32-81 years old), with recently developed angina (median duration: 3 months), showing no other disease and on no drugs, were Holter-monitored 24-48 h at baseline and after 4-5 days on IS-5-MN (mean daily dose: 33 mg), on metoprolol (mean daily dose: 184 mg) and on the combined treatment. Recordings were analysed on the Marquette Series 8000 Holter scanner. Both IS-5-MN and metoprolol significantly reduced myocardial ischaemia (ST integral) and ventricular tachycardias. Metoprolol induced significant changes in the following parameters (baseline versus metoprolol): high-frequency peak 9 +/- 4 versus 11 +/- 4 ms (p < 0.001), low-to-high frequency ratio 2.5 +/- 0.6 versus 1.9 +/- 0.6 (p < 0.0001), root mean square of RR interval difference 23 +/- 7 versus 31 +/- 9 ms (p < 0.0001), RR intervals differing more than 50 ms from the preceding one 4.8 +/- 3.9 versus 10.0 +/- 7.0% (p < 0.0001), mean of all 5-min standard deviations 50 +/- 12 versus 56 +/- 11 ms (p < 0.001) and mean RR interval 819 +/- 90 versus 1,019 +/- 120 ms (p < 0.00001). The combined treatment caused approximately the same HRV changes as metoprolol alone. IS-5-MN had no significant effect on any HRV parameter, neither alone nor in combination with metoprolol.", 
    "98": "A clinically effective dose of metoprolol had potentially positive effects on HRV with increase in vagal and decrease in sympathetic tone while IS-5-MN had no effect on HRV, neither positive nor negative, neither alone nor in combination with metoprolol.", 
    "99": "The plasma concentrations and urinary excretions of bisoprolol enantiomers in four Japanese male healthy volunteers after a single oral administration of 20 mg of racemic bisoprolol were evaluated. The AUC(infinity) and elimination half-life of (S)-(-)-bisoprolol were slightly larger than those of (R)-(+)-bisoprolol in all subjects. The metabolic clearance of (R)-(+)-bisoprolol was significantly (P < 0.05) larger than that of (S)-(-)-bisoprolol (S/R ratio: 0.79+/-0.03), although the difference was small. In contrast, no stereoselective in vitro protein binding of bisoprolol in human plasma was found. An in vitro metabolic study using recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms indicated that oxidation of both bisoprolol enantiomers was catalyzed by the two isoforms, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. CYP2D6 metabolized bisoprolol stereoselectively (R > S), whereas the metabolism of bisoprolol by CYP3A4 was not stereoselective. The S/R ratio of the mean clearance due to renal tubular secretion was 0.68, indicating a moderate degree of stereoselective renal tubular secretion. These findings taken together suggest that the small differences in the pharmacokinetics between (S)-(-)- and (R)-(+)-bisoprolol are mainly due to the stereoselectivity in the intrinsic metabolic clearance by CYP2D6 and renal tubular secretion.",

    "101": "Excised HCC tissues were immediately placed in Krebs solution and kept at 4 degrees C until use (never > 24 h after removal). HCC was cut in strips of approximately 2 cm, suspended in a cascade system and superfused with oxygenated and warmed Krebs solution at 5 mL/min. After equilibration for approximately 90 min, noradrenaline (3 micromol/L) was infused to induce a submaximal contraction of the HCC strips. The release of cyclo-oxygenase products was prevented by infusing indomethacin (6 micromol/L). HCC strips were calibrated by injecting a single bolus of the nitrovasodilator glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and the sensitivity of the tissues adjusted electronically to be similar. The agonists (kinins, histamine and acetylcholine) were injected as a single bolus (up to 100 microL) and the relaxation of HCC expressed as a percentage of the submaximal relaxation induced by GTN.", 
    "102": "Bradykinin, Lys-BK and Met-Lys-BK significantly relaxed the HCC tissues; on a molar basis, there was no statistical difference among the degrees of relaxation induced by these peptides. The B1 kinin receptor agonist des-Arg9-bradykinin had no effect on the HCC. The infusion of the B2 kinin receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (50 nmol/L) virtually abolished the relaxation induced by BK, Lys-BK and Met-Lys-BK without affecting those induced by acetylcholine and histamine. The infusion of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased the tone of the HCC tissues and significantly reduced (P < 0.01) the relaxation induced by BK (74%), Lys-BK (90%), Met-Lys-BK (87%) and acetylcholine (89%) without affecting those induced by GTN. The subsequent infusion of L-arginine (300 micromol/L) partially reversed the increased tone and significantly (P < 0.01) restored the relaxation induced by BK, Lys-BK and Met-Lys-BK. The results were similar with the novel guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo[4,3,-alquinoxalin-1-one] which reduced by > 95% (P < 0.01) the relaxation induced by BK, Lys-BK, Met-Lys-BK, acetylcholine and GTN. The infusion of the sodium-channel blocker tetrodotoxin had no significant effect on the BK-, GTN- and acetylcholine-induced relaxation of HCC.", 
    "103": "This study clearly showed the existence of functional B2 kinin receptors in human erectile tissues that when activated lead to the release of NO and hence relaxation of the HCC tissues. As tetrodotoxin failed to affect the kinin-induced relaxation of HCC strips, it is likely that these peptides release NO from the endothelium of sinusoidal capillaries rather than from neuronal sources supplying the cavernosal tissue. Although tissue kallikreins and their components have been found in the male reproductive system, the physiopathological importance of these findings has yet to be elucidated.", 
    "104": "A new formulation (HYA) based on timolol hyaluronate and pilocarpine hyaluronate salts has been shown to improve the bioavailability of the drugs and to extend the duration of their action. Extent of the intraocular pressure lowering effect, duration of action and aqueous bioavailability of timolol and pilocarpine of HYA were compared with a commercial preparation. Ocular hypertension in the rabbit was induced by alpha-chymotrypsin or by water loading. The hypotensive effect of HYA treatment was significantly greater and longer than that observed in rabbit eyes treated with the commercial preparation both in the normotensive and in the hypertensive animals. Furthermore, we evaluated the miotic response; due to pilocarpine, normotensive rabbits showed a greater miotic response and an extended duration when the eyes were treated with HYA. The new formulation increased the aqueous availability of timolol and pilocarpine compared to the commercial preparation as determined by HPLC. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of HYA indicate an increase in efficacy and duration of action along with an increase in bioavailability of timolol and pilocarpine in comparison with the commercial preparation.", 
    "105": "This study evaluated the effect of peripheral injections of a beta3 adrenergic agonist, BRL-37,344 on food intake and whether this inhibition could be blocked by a nonspecific beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, given peripherally or into the central nervous system. When BRL-37,344 was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into lean and obese Zucker rats, food intake was decreased. The reduction of food intake by BRL-37,344 was attenuated when propranolol was administered i.p. prior to giving the beta adrenergic agonist. When propranolol was administered into the third cerebral ventricle, it increased food intake in lean rats, but not the fatty rats. Propranolol administered into the third cerebral ventricle attenuated the effect on food intake of i.p. injection of BRL-37,344. These studies support the hypothesis that there are peripheral beta-3 adrenergic receptors that can reduce food intake and that there are central beta2 or beta3 adrenergic receptors that mediate the peripheral effect of the beta3 agonist.", 
    "106": "Electrical stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex caused glutamate release in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of freely moving animals. Cathodal stimulation was given through monopolar electrodes in 0.1-ms pulses at an intensity of 300 microA and frequencies of 4-120 Hz. Glutamate was measured in 10-min perfusate samples by HPLC coupled with fluorescence detection following precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde/beta-mercaptoethanol. The stimulation-induced glutamate release was frequency dependent and was blocked by the infusion of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (10 microM) through the dialysis probe. The stimulation also induced bilateral Fos-like immunoreactivity in ventral tegmental neurons, with a significantly greater number of Fos-positive cells on the stimulated side. These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the medial prefrontal cortex regulates dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens via its projection to dopamine cell bodies in the VTA.", 
    "107": "The positive chronotropic effect of bradykinin was investigated in the pithed rat preparation. Cumulative treatment with bradykinin (0.20 nmol/kg-6.59 mumol/kg, intravenous [i.v.]) caused a dose-dependent increase in heart rate (HR) by a maximum of 80 +/- 3.3 beats min-1. In contrast, the active metabolite of bradykinin and selective bradykinin B1-receptor agonist, [des-Arg9]-bradykinin did not influence the spontaneous frequency of beating. Propranolol alone reduced the bradykinin-induced increase in HR and a combination of propranolol with prazosin abolished the chronotropic effect of bradykinin. The selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. Hoe 140, dose-dependently shifted the dose-response curves of bradykinin to the right, whereas the bradykinin B1 receptor antagonist, des-Arg10-[Leu9]-kallidin proved ineffective. From our experiments it may be concluded that bradykinin induces tachycardia in the pithed rat primarily by stimulating the sympathetic ganglia leading to the release of noradrenaline, which subsequently activates cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors. The bradykinin-induced chronotropic effect is mediated by bradykinin B2-receptors, whereas B1-receptors appear not to be involved.",

    "109": "Primary rabbit corneal epithelial cells grown in DMEM-F12 were seeded on Transwell-COL inserts coated with fibronectin. The epithelial barrier integrity was evaluated, based on measurements of 14C-mannitol and 3H-PEG900, and their transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Ultrastructure evaluation was based on scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, which were performed 8 days after seeding. Measurements of beta adrenergic antagonist permeability were performed to assess transcellular permeability.", 
    "110": "Eight days after seeding, the TEER reached a peak of 144 omega.cm2 and the 14C-mannitol and 3H-PEG900 permeabilities were 6.8 x 10(-6) and 2.9 x 10(-6) cm/sec, respectively. Ultrastructural analysis revealed a multilayered structure with numerous microplicae and typical cytoplasmic organelles along with desmosomes. The relationship between permeation of beta-blockers and lipophilicity resembled the intact isolated cornea.", 
    "111": "This is the first description of cultured RCEC grown on permeable support. Many of its properties mimic those described in the intact corneal epithelium. Even though its electrical tightness is less than that of the intact cornea, the transcellular permeability to lipophilic beta-antagonists is comparable to the isolated preparation. Therefore, this model will facilitate characterization of ocular permeation mechanisms of hydrophobic drugs whose route of permeation is transcellular.", 
    "112": "Although abortive treatment and nonpharmacologic interventions are effective for many if not most patients' occasional migraine attacks, patients who have frequent and/or severe attacks may benefit from preventive pharmacotherapy. This is particularly critical for those patients whose migraines are not treated effectively by acute-care medications because lack of pain control may lead to overuse syndromes that complicate further treatment. Inappropriate use of acute-care medication may contribute to chronic daily headache, tolerance to symptomatic medication, and headache refractory to all treatment. In addition, patients who increase use of acute-care medication due to lack of effect may suffer ergotism, GI problems, liver toxicity, analgesic nephropathy, drug induced-headache, and withdrawal symptoms when overused agents are withdrawn. Finally, overuse of acute-care medication may interfere with the effectiveness of preventive medication. The remainder of this article will focus on when to treat with preventive medication and which medications are currently available for prevention of migraine.", 
    "113": "We hypothesized that a previously observed exercise-induced suppression of alveolar macrophage antiviral resistance results from increases in corticosterone and/or epinephrine. Mice (CD-1) were run to fatigue on a treadmill (exercise), or placed in Plexiglas lanes above the treadmill (control). The role of corticosterone was assessed by further dividing mice into groups receiving one of the following treatments; sham surgery, adrenalectomy, or adrenalectomy plus corticosterone replacement. Macrophage antiviral function was suppressed in the exercised mice compared to the control mice. However, macrophage antiviral function was not suppressed in the exercised mice that underwent adrenalectomy or adrenalectomy plus corticosterone replacement. We tested whether another adrenal factor (epinephrine) may be involved by dividing mice into exercise and control groups treated with either saline or propranolol. Macrophage antiviral function was again suppressed in the saline-treated exercised mice compared to saline-treated control mice, but no differences were found between the exercised mice receiving propranolol, control mice receiving propranolol, or saline-treated control mice. Isoproterenol, when added to alveolar macrophages in culture, also suppressed antiviral resistance. These findings suggest that decreased macrophage antiviral function following exercise may be due to increased release of adrenal catecholamines.", 
    "114": "The power of delta and theta frequency bands of the EEG in the posterior hypothalamus of the rat fluctuates according to an ultradian rhythm. To investigate, whether catecholamine receptor ligands influence the ultradian EEG rhythm, drugs were applied intracerebroventricularly into the lateral ventricle of anaesthetized rats. Injection of the alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist (+/-)-methoxamine (150 nmol) abolished, while 25 nmol of the compound prolonged the cycle duration of the rhythmic changes in the delta and theta frequency bands. Injected into the lateral ventricle, the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists 6-ethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-oxazol[4,5-d] azepin-2-amine (B-HT 933) or clonidine (150 nmol each) prolonged the duration of the cycles of both frequency bands. The beta1/2-receptor agonists (+/-)-orciprenaline (300 nmol) and (R)-(-)-isoprenaline (150 nmol) slowed down the cycle durations of both frequency bands. The beta1-receptor agonist (+/-)-xamoterol (300 nmol) also prolonged the cycle durations of the delta and theta frequency bands. The beta1-receptor antagonist (S)-(-)-atenolol was ineffective (150 and 300 nmol). The beta2-receptor agonist (+/-)-salbutamol (300 nmol) shortened the duration of the ultradian rhythm in the two frequency bands, while the beta2-receptor antagonist (+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1 H-inden-4-yl) oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol (ICI 118,551) (300 nmol) exerted the opposite effect. On the other hand, the D1 receptor agonist (+/-)-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H)-3-benzazepine-7,8-diol (SKF 38393) and the D2 agonist (4aR,8aR)-(-)-quinpirole (150 nmol each) slowed down the frequency of the ultradian rhythm. The powers of alpha and beta frequency bands were not significantly influenced by the catecholamine receptor ligands used in this study. The findings suggest that, in the posterior hypothalamus, the ultradian rhythm of the delta and theta frequency bands are prolonged when beta1-receptors are stimulated and shortened on stimulation of beta2-adrenoceptors. Endogenous catecholamines released from their neurons seem to shorten the duration of the rhythmic fluctuations by stimulating beta2-receptors and to slow down the frequency of the cyclic fluctuations by stimulating alpha2-adrenoceptors. The ultradian rhythm is also slowed down on stimulation of D1 and D2 receptors by endogenous dopamine. Together with previous observations, the results indicate that the ultradian EEG rhythm is susceptible to modulatory mechanisms mediated by catecholaminergic neurons.", 
    "115": "We previously observed in vivo that a neonatal thymus grafted into old mice can correct age-related changes such as occurrence of hepatocyte tetraploid nuclei and impaired isoproterenol-induced DNA synthesis in submandibular glands. The aim of the present paper was to study the influence of age and thymus on basal and beta-adrenergic-stimulated DNA synthesis using primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes. In the absence of any adrenergic agents, cells from young mice show peak DNA synthesis between 36 and 48 h; old mice show a similar time course, but the peak is significantly reduced statistically. The main result is represented by the behavior of hepatocytes from old thymus-grafted mice, which recover the levels of [3H]-thymidine incorporation toward young-like values. Grafted animals also show a correction of total DNA content that is increased in old mice. The addition of isoproterenol does not modify the DNA synthetic pattern, whereas the antagonist propranolol causes a slight but statistically significant decrease.", 
    "116": "Many pathophysiological processes are activated in patients with congestive heart failure, and several of these have been implicated in the progression of the disease. The most important processes to be activated in heart failure are the neurohormonal systems, which include the reninangiotensin system, the sympathetic nervous system and the endothelin system. In addition to the neurohormonal systems, the formation of reactive oxygen free radicals is increased in congestive heart failure. It has been proposed that the activation of neurohormonal pathways and the formation of oxygen free radicals ultimately lead to the activation of a family of transcription factors that are involved in cardiac and vascular remodelling which are hallmarks of congestive heart failure. In addition, the formation of oxygen free radicals has been implicated in the process of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which may contribute to the continued loss of myocardial cells resulting in progressive decreases in left ventricular function, while at the same time contributing to the cardiac remodelling process which subsequently creates a pro-arrhythmic environment in the myocardium. Carvedilol is a novel multiple-action neurohormonal antagonist that has been shown to be effective in the management of congestive heart failure. Carvedilol also possesses a number of additional activities which may inhibit many of the chronic pathophysiological processes that are involved in the progression of congestive heart failure.", 
    "117": "We have recently reported the time course of acute myocardial drug uptake and simultaneous pharmacodynamic effects for metoprolol (4 mg; n = 12) and sotalol (20 mg; n = 10) in patients with ischemic heart disease. The acute pharmacodynamic effects of the two drugs included reductions in both spontaneous heart rate and the contractile index peak positive rate of left ventricular pressure rise and prolongation of the electrocardiographic PR interval, all of which exhibited an equilibration delay compared with myocardial drug content. The objective of the current study was to analyze the relationship between myocardial drug content and effect for both metoprolol and sotalol using an effect compartment model, to examine the potential for the two drugs to share a common subsite of action in the myocardium. The time course of myocardial drug content was best described by a one-compartment model for metoprolol and a two-compartment model for sotalol. A linear pharmacodynamic model, relating the amount of drug at the effect-site (Ae) with each of the three effects, was used in the effect compartment modeling. The slope of each of these effects as a function of Ae was considerably flatter for sotalol than for metoprolol, reflecting the relative beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic potencies of the two drugs. The exit rate constant from the effect compartment (K(eo)) did not differ significantly from each other or from the exit rate constant from the \"peripheral\" compartment (K21) for sotalol. The results suggest that the effect compartment within the myocardium for both drugs may correspond to a \"peripheral\" compartment, even though a \"peripheral\" pharmacokinetic compartment for myocardial metoprolol content was not apparent. Thus, the effect compartment for many cardioactive drugs may correspond to a pharmacokinetically \"peripheral\" compartment, irrespective of localization of effect to a small (e.g. sinoatrial node) or large (e.g. ventricular myocardium) region of the heart.", 
    "118": "Clinical observations indicate that diabetes leads to micro- and macroangiopathy involving endothelial dysfunction. Because recent studies indicate an antiangiopathic effect of celiprolol, but not of metoprolol, in type 1 diabetes, we investigated the direct influence of exposure to high D-glucose concentrations on endothelial cells and the possible effects of both beta-blockers. Nine different chronic treatments were carried out on cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells: 1) 5 mmol/l D-glucose (\"normoglycemic\" cells), 2) 5 mmol/l D-glucose plus 15 mmol/l L-glucose (osmotic control), 3) 5 mmol/l D-glucose plus 0.5 micromol/l celiprolol, 4) 5 mmol/l D-glucose plus 0.05 micromol/l metoprolol, 5) 5 mmol/l D-glucose plus 0.5 micromol/l celiprolol plus 5 micromol/l propranolol, 6) 20 mmol/l D-glucose (\"hyperglycemic\" cells), 7) 20 mmol/l D-glucose plus 0.5 micromol/l celiprolol, 8) 20 mmol/l D-glucose plus 0.05 micromol/l metoprolol, and 9) 20 mmol/l D-glucose plus 0.5 micromol/l celiprolol plus 5 micromol/l propranolol. Using the Fura-2 technique, application of either 1 nmol/l bradykinin or 1 micromol/l ATP to the normoglycemic endothelial cells led to a significant increase in intracellular calcium, whereas the hyperglycemic cells showed significantly less reactivity to both agents. Exposure of endothelial cells to L-glucose did not show any difference to normoglycemic controls. Coadministration of 20 mmol/l glucose and celiprolol demonstrated that the alteration of the calcium signal induced by high D-glucose concentrations could be significantly antagonized with celiprolol. In contrast, coincubation with metoprolol failed to normalize the calcium signal. This effect of celiprolol was completely abolished in the presence of propranolol. In normoglycemic cells, none of the beta-blockers influenced the intracellular calcium response to bradykinin or ATP. These results indicate that chronic treatment with high D-glucose concentrations leads to an impairment of calcium signaling, which might be ameliorated by celiprolol.", 
    "119": "The results of both experimental studies and clinical trials indicate that prolonged activation of the sympathetic nervous system can adversely affect the course of heart failure, and that this deleterious effect can be attenuated with the use of beta-blocking agents. Studies with beta-1 selective agents such as metoprolol and bisoprolol, have demonstrated that beta-blockers can reduce the risk of worsening heart failure but have shown little or equivocal effect on survival. In contrast, recent trials with non-selective vasodilating beta-blockers (i.e. carvedilol) have reported a reduction in the risk of both death and hospitalization. It is uncertain, however, whether these survival effects represent a class effect of beta-blockers or a specific effect of carvedilol. Carvedilol antagonizes several biological mechanisms (not blocked by metoprolol or bisoprolol) that may be important in mediating the progression of heart failure. In three meta-analyses, the survival effects of non-selective vasodilating beta-blockers (primarily carvedilol) were greater than those of beta-1 selective non-vasodilating beta-blockers. A clear answer to the question as to whether mortality reduction is a class effect of beta-blockers will be provided by several large-scale survival trials, which are currently in progress.", 
    "120": "Several targets for heart failure therapy may be met through different mechanisms which are not necessarily associated. In the Australia/New Zealand Heart Failure Research Collaborative Group Study, patients with chronic stable heart failure of ischaemic aetiology on treatment including ACE inhibitors were randomized to treatment with either the vasodilator beta-blocking drug carvedilol or placebo. At 12 months, symptoms and exercise performance were unchanged, but ejection fraction increased significantly with carvedilol treatment; at 20 months, the rate of death and hospitalization was also significantly reduced in the carvedilol-treated group. In a sub-study using two dimensional echocardiography, progressive left ventricular (LV) dilatation occurred in the placebo group, compared with significant reductions in LV volumes with the carvedilol treatment group. An overview of all available carvedilol trial data showed the odds of death reduced by one-half with treatment (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.77, 2P = 0.0014). Thus, improved LV remodelling occurs with carvedilol treatment in heart failure and is associated with improved long-term outcomes including survival. Improved LV function may, in part, mediate the survival benefit of carvedilol and provide a reliable surrogate for long-term outcomes.", 
    "121": "Increased mortality and reduced functional capacity are the two main characteristics of chronic heart failure. Activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic systems has a primary role in the progressive worsening of heart failure and increased mortality of patients. In addition, both systems may be important in the pathogenesis of exercise intolerance, although there is only a weak relationship between neurohormonal activation and exercise capacity. While neurohormonal antagonists, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers, consistently improve the prognosis of patients with heart failure, their effects on exercise tolerance have often been less significant. This problem has been emphasized by the introduction of beta-blockers for the therapy of heart failure. Beta blockade results in a significant improvement in left ventricular function during rest and exercise. However, the reduction in chronotropic response to exercise as well as the metabolic changes caused by these agents in skeletal muscle may result in an apparent lack of change in maximal functional capacity. This effect is particularly important with the new third generation non-selective beta-blockers. The pronounced anti-adrenergic activity of these compounds accounts for their greater negative chronotropic effect and relates to the lack of improvement in peak oxygen consumption (VO2). Submaximal exercise testing can be used to assess changes induced by these agents. However, even the six-minute walk test may act as an almost maximal test in patients with advanced heart failure: moreover, the measurement of submaximal exercise duration may be sensitive enough to detect changes in single-centre trials, but not in multicentre trials. To date, direct assessment of symptoms by both patient and physician is still the most sensitive tool to monitor changes in functional status with non-selective beta-blockers. Thus, an accurate method of measuring patients' symptoms, in addition to the clinical examination, is still necessary when neurohormonal antagonists are used in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "122": "The aim of this study was to determine the kinin responses on human umbilical artery (HUA) and to characterise the kinin receptors present on this tissue. The HUA was found to constrict in response to both the B2 receptor agonist, bradykinin (BK), and the B1 receptor agonist, des-Arg9-BK. The presence of indomethacin (2.79 microM) was found to have no significant effect on the responses to BK and des-Arg9-BK. The presence of the B2 receptor antagonist, HOE-140 (+2.79 microM indomethacin), resulted in a concentration-related rightward displacement of the concentration-effect curves to BK. The antagonism of the constrictor responses to BK by HOE-140 was found to be competitive (pA2 = 7.5). The responses to BK were not significantly affected by the B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg9(leu8)BK. The presence of des-Arg9(leu8)BK (+2.79 microM indomethacin) resulted in a concentration-related rightward displacement of the concentration-effect curve to des-Arg9-BK. The antagonism of the response to des-Arg9-BK by des-Arg9(leu8)BK was found to be competitive (pA2 = 5.9). The responses to des-Arg9-BK were not significantly affected by HOE-140. The results of the present study suggest that the products of the cyclooxygenase pathway are not involved in the kinin constrictor response on HUA and indicate the presence of B1 and B2 receptors on this tissue.", 
    "123": "Cross-regulations between Gs and Gi mediated pathways controlling the adenylyl cyclase activity have been clearly demonstrated in vitro. To elucidate whether activation of the beta-adrenergic pathway in the pregnant myometrium might affect Gi proteins and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors (ARs), we treated late pregnant rats from day 18 to day 21 with twice-daily administration of isoproterenol (8 mg/kg). This treatment increased myometrial cAMP levels and led after 76 h to a significant and maximal rise in the immunoreactive amount of myometrial Gi alpha 2 and Gi alpha 3 proteins (1.4- and 1.7-fold respectively) associated with a parallel increase of the steady-state levels of both Gi alpha 2 and Gi alpha 3 mRNA (1.6- and 1.9-fold respectively). Propranolol antagonized this response indicating the implication of the beta-adrenergic pathway. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that isoproterenol enhanced respectively by 1.3- and 1.2-fold the transcription rate of the Gi alpha 2 and Gi alpha 3 genes. Quantification of myometrial alpha(2)-ARs by [3H]rauwolscine binding revealed that the total number of receptors was also increased at 76 h by 1.7-fold when compared with controls, with no change in the affinity of the alpha(2)-ARs for the ligand. This effect was antagonized by propranolol. Quantification of both alpha(2A)- and alpha(2B)-subtypes by Northern blotting analysis demonstrated that this elevation was due to a selective increase of the alpha(2A)-subtype mRNAs. The present results indicate that in vivo stimulation of the beta-adrenergic pathway by isoproterenol increases both Gi alpha 2/Gi alpha 3 and alpha(2A)-AR expression in the pregnant rat myometrium. The possible contribution of such a mechanism in pregnancy-related changes of both entities is discussed.", 
    "124": "ATP-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release was studied in [3H]AA-prelabeled cultured astrocytes. To characterize the P2 purinoceptor-mediated effect of ATP, the subtype-specific agonists 2-methylthio ATP (2-MeSATP) and UTP were compared. ATP, UTP, or 2-MeSATP induced a dose-dependent increase of [3H]AA release, with EC50 values of 22.7 microM, 29.4 microM, and 1.68 microM, respectively; alpha,beta-methyleneATP and adenosine had no effect. The order of potency was ATP = UTP > or = 2-MeSATP, indicating that ATP interacted with both P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors to mediate AA release in astrocytes. The effect of ATP, UTP, or 2-MeSATP was markedly inhibited by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. Ca2+ ionophore-A23187 and PKC activator-TPA mimicked the effects of these three agonists to stimulate AA release. ATP, UTP, and 2-MeSATP induced a rapidly initial rise of [Ca2+]i and a sustained [Ca2+]i increase. The AA release was blocked in the external Ca2+ free in condition the sustained [Ca2+]i increase was abolished. Both A23187- and TPA-induced AA release were also blocked in this condition. Furthermore, inorganic Ca2+ channel blocker Co2+ inhibited ATP, UTP, or 2-MeSATP induced AA release as well. Long-term (24 h) treatment of cells with TPA resulted in an attenuation of three agonists, TPA or A23187 response. Similarly, ATP or TPA promoted AA release was inhibited by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade inhibitor PD 98059. ATP, TPA, or A23187 induced an increase in the activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK, as well as a molecular weight shift, consistent with phosphorylation, of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). ATP- and TPA-stimulated activation of p42 MAPK activity and tyrosine phosphorylation were inhibited by long-term TPA treatment, while A23187-stimulated effects were completely blocked. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of p42 MAPK and mobility shift of cPLA2 induced by A23187 were reversed in the absence of external Ca2+, suggesting the involvement of PKCalpha in MAPK activation and mobility shift of cPLA2. Taken together, ATP-stimulated AA release was secondary to the activation of P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors/PLC pathway. Ca2+ and PKC interact to regulate this response. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+, the mechanism involving extracellular Ca2+ influx, might act partly through PKCalpha activation and in turn MAPK might be activated, leading to cPLA2 phosphorylation and AA release.", 
    "125": "The four stereoisomers of the combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist labetalol were separated and quantified at therapeutic concentrations by normal-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase and fluorescence detection. Drug in plasma or urine was recovered by solid-phase extraction with 83+/-5% efficiency. Limits of detection from biological samples (3 ml) were between 1.5-1.8 ng ml(-1). Intra-day and inter-day variation at 25 ng ml(-1) were < or = 2.7% and < or = 5.80% respectively for all stereoisomers. The assay was applied to an examination of the disposition of labetalol stereoisomers after a single oral dose of racemate to a human volunteer. Labetalol appears to undergo enantioselective metabolism leading to relatively low plasma concentrations of the pharmacologically active enantiomers.", 
    "126": "Beta2-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) density on peripheral blood lymphocytes has been used as an index to reflect the betaAR state of the body. Lymphocytes betaARs are unequally distributed among lymphocyte subpopulations, with the highest density on CD8+ cells and the lowest on CD4+ cells. Thus, the measurement of peripheral blood lymphocyte betaAR density could vary with changes in CD4+ and CD8+ cell concentrations. We examined the individual and intersubject variance of betaAR density and lymphocyte subpopulations over time in 10 normal subjects, studied on 3 to 5 different d always at approximately 9:00 A.M. over a 4- to 12-wk period. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated and beta2-adrenergic receptor density was determined by specific binding of [125I]-(-)iodopindolol, and lymphocyte subpopulations were measured by flow cytometry. Average receptors per lymphocyte were 776 +/- 183. Whereas the absolute values of CD4+% and CD8+% cell concentrations varied little in individual subjects (coefficient of variation 9.5% and 11.1%, respectively), the individual betaAR variance was greater (coefficient of variation 22.4%). However there was a significant correlation between betaAR and CD4+% and CD8+% cell concentration (correlation coefficients: -0.58, p < 0.001; +0.51, p < 0.001, respectively). This information is relevant to interpretations of changes in peripheral betaAR in humans.", 
    "127": "Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis is an interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. Since pulmonary fibrosis is a recognized, if rare, complication of certain drug exposures, including antidepressants, betablockers, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), we tested the hypothesis that exposure to these drugs might contribute to the etiology of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis. Lifetime drug exposure data were collected from general practitioner records for 141 cases of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and 246 age-, sex-, and community-matched control subjects from the Trent region of England. Additional data on lifetime smoking habits were obtained by postal questionnaire. The odds of disease in relation to ever exposure to antidepressants, betablockers, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and NSAIDs were calculated by conditional logistic regression. For drug groups significantly associated with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, subset analyses were performed to investigate the effects of individual drugs. Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis was associated with exposure to antidepressants (odds ratio [OR] 1.79 [95% CI 1.09-2.95], p = 0.022) and specifically to imipramine (OR 4.79 [1.50-15.3], p = 0.01), dothiepin (OR 2.37 [0.99-5.69], p = 0.05), and mianserin (OR 3.27 [1.11-9.61], p = 0.03). The magnitude of the overall effect of antidepressants was not changed by excluding all drug exposures within the 5 yr preceding the diagnosis of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (OR 1.62 [0.94-2.77], p = 0.081), nor were the strong individual effects of imipramine (OR 5.72 [1.54-21.2], p = 0.009) and dothiepin (OR 5.58 [1.12-27.8], p = 0.036). These estimates were not appreciably affected by controlling for smoking history. The attributable risk for antidepressant exposure was in the region of 9-14%. No significant association was noted between cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and the four other drug groups in the primary hypothesis. The results of this study suggest that some antidepressant drugs can cause cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis.", 
    "128": "We have previously reported that 5-\u00bf3-[((2S)-1,4-benzodioxan-2-ylmethyl)amino]propoxy\u00bf-1,3-be nzodioxole (MKC-242), a potent and selective serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor agonist, exerts anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in animal models and that the antidepressant-like effect may be mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. The present study, using a microdialysis technique, was undertaken to characterize in vivo the effect of MKC-242 on cholinergic neurons. Subcutaneous injection of MKC-242 (0.5-1.0 mg/kg), like the typical 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), increased extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the rat cerebral cortex. The increase in ACh release by MKC-242 was also observed in the hippocampus. The effect of MKC-242 on cortical ACh release was attenuated by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists (10 mg/kg, s.c.) propranolol and N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-phenylpropana mide. The increase in cortical ACh release by MKC-242 was blocked by lesion of serotonergic neurons with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, whereas that by 8-OH-DPAT was not. Lesion of noradrenergic neurons with N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine did not affect the MKC-242-induced increase in ACh release. These results suggest that systemic injection of MKC-242 facilitates in vivo ACh release via an activation of somadendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, and that MKC-242 and 8-OH-DPAT affect cholinergic neurons in the rat cerebral cortex via different mechanisms.", 
    "129": "1. Whole cell and single channel recordings of ATP-sensitive K+ current (I(K,ATP)) were carried out in ventricular myocytes isolated from neonatal rat hearts. 2. (+/-)-Propranolol, a commonly used beta-blocker, inhibited the whole cell I(K,ATP) in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-maximal concentration (IC50) of 6.7 +/- 1.4 microM, whereas it blocked the inward rectifier K+ current (I(K,I)) only at much higher concentrations (IC50 = 102.4 +/- 20.2 microM). The inhibition was time- and voltage-independent. 3. In the outside-out patch configuration, (+/-)-propranolol inhibited I(K,ATP) (IC50 = 9.8 +/- 2.9 microM) by decreasing the open probability of the channel without inducing additional noise in the open-channel current or a decrease of single channel conductance. The single channel current of I(K,I) was also blocked by (+/-)-propranolol in the same way as I(K,ATP). 4. (+)-Propranolol, an optic isomer having no beta-blocking effect, inhibited I(K,ATP) (IC50 = 5.8 +/- 1.0 microM), whilst atenolol, a selective beta1-blocker had no effect. Neither GDPbetaS (1 mM) nor GTPgammaS (200 microM) included in the pipette solution modulated the inhibitory effect of (+/-)-propranolol. 5. We concluded that the inhibitory effect of (+/-)-propranolol was not via the beta-adrenergic signal transduction pathway, but by direct inhibition of I(K,ATP) channels.", 
    "130": "In an attempt to explore the possible involvement of venodilator beta-adrenoceptors in the constrictor response of the human dorsal hand vein to noradrenaline, we examined the ability of nadolol, a non-selective beta1/beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, and bisoprolol a selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist, to potentiate the response.",

In each session nadolol (40 mg), bisoprolol (5 mg) or placebo was ingested, and (-) noradrenaline acid tartrate (0.33-33.33 ng min ) was infused locally into the dorsal hand vein 2 h after the ingestion of the drugs. Changes in vein diameter were monitored with the dorsal hand vein compliance technique. Subjects were allocated to treatments and sessions according to a double-blind balanced cross-over design.

    "134": "The beta2-adrenoreceptor (beta2AR) couples to the G-protein Gs to mediate adenylyl cyclase activation. The splice variants of Gsalpha differ by a 15-amino acid insert between the Ras-like domain and the alpha-helical domain. The long splice variant of Gsalpha (GsalphaL) binds GDP with lower affinity than the short splice variant (GsalphaS), but the impact of this difference on the interaction of Gsalpha with the beta2AR is not known. We studied the beta2AR/Gsalpha interaction using receptor/G-protein fusion proteins (beta2ARGsalphaS and beta2ARGsalphaL) expressed in Sf9 cells. Fusion of the beta2AR to Gsalpha promotes efficient coupling as shown by high-affinity agonist binding and GTPase and adenylyl cyclase activation and ensures fixed stoichiometry between receptor and G-protein. Importantly, fusion does not change the fundamental properties of the beta2AR or Gsalpha. The beta2AR in beta2ARGsalphaL showed hallmarks of constitutive activity (increased potency and intrinsic activity of partial agonists, increased efficacy of inverse agonists, and increased basal GTPase activity) compared with the beta2AR in beta2ARGsalphaS. The apparent constitutive activity of the beta2AR in beta2ARGsalphaL may be due to the lower GDP affinity of GsalphaL compared with GsalphaS, i.e. GsalphaL is more often nucleotide-free than GsalphaS and, therefore, more frequently available to stabilize the beta2AR in the active (R*) state. This study demonstrates that subtle structural differences between closely related G-protein alpha-subunits can have important consequences for the functional properties of a G-protein-coupled receptor.", 
    "135": "The kinetics of propranolol enantiomers are stereoselective when high doses of the racemic drug are given po. To document whether the dose and/or the route of administration determines the stereoselective kinetics of propranolol enantiomers, conscious rabbits received 40, 80, or 120 mg/kg po or 0.5 or 10 mg/kg iv doses of racemic propranolol, and serial blood samples were obtained to assay propranolol enantiomers. At low po and iv doses, the kinetics of the propranolol enantiomers were identical. After the 120 mg/kg po dose, the kinetics of the enantiomers were stereoselective, i.e. the AUC0-->infinity for (S)-(-)-propranolol was greater than the AUC0-->infinity for (R)-(+)-propranolol (p < 0.05). The iv injection of 10 mg/kg generated zero-order kinetics, and (S)-(-)-propranolol was eliminated faster than the antipode. Propranolol enantiomer plasma protein binding was not stereoselective. In vitro, after the incubation of 5.8 or 58 microM (RS)-propranolol with cells of the intestinal mucosa or the liver, (R)-(+)-propranolol was more rapidly metabolized than (S)-(-)-propranolol at both concentrations in the intestine and at the higher concentration in the liver. Incubation of the individual enantiomers (2.9 and 29 microM) showed that in the intestine the intrinsic clearance of (R)-(+)-propranolol was greater than that of (S)-(-)-propranolol but in the liver there was preferential saturation of (S)-(-)-propranolol clearance. In conclusion, at low po or iv doses the kinetics of (RS)-propranolol are not stereoselective because the liver overshadows the effect of the intestine, and at high po doses the kinetics of propranolol enantiomers are stereoselective because of hepatic saturation of (S)-(-)-propranolol clearance.", 
    "136": "The history of the use of beta-blockers for congestive heart failure, beginning with the innovative seminal study by the Swedish group in 1975 to studies in 1995, is reviewed and shows that almost all trials favored the use of beta-blockers. They tended to demonstrate an increase in ejection fraction, a decrease in left ventricular mass, and in some studies, even a decrease in mortality. Even after the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, additional improvement in function and mortality was observed. Patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy derived more benefit from beta-blockers than did patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Least likely to benefit were patients treated for <2 months, patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and those with marked intercellular fibrosis. Although the starting dose of metoprolol, the most common beta-blocker used, may have to be as low as 2.5 mg/d, mortality analysis failed to show a decrease in sudden death unless the dose was raised to about 300 mg/d, a dose at which beta-selectivity is generally not expected to be present. The non-beta-specific bucindolol or carvedilol may ultimately be preferred to metoprolol because they are better tolerated initially due to a slight vasodilatation effect. Initial studies with carvedilol showed remarkable promise in reducing mortality. However, these agents cannot yet be said to have been studied adequately.", 
    "137": "Interaction between sphingomyelin metabolism and cyclic nucleotide synthesis in rat pinealocytes was investigated by determining the effect of ceramide on adrenergic-stimulated cAMP and cGMP accumulation. Although C2-, C6-, and C8-ceramide had no effect on basal, isoproterenol-, or norepinephrine-stimulated cAMP and cGMP accumulation, they inhibited the potentiation caused by depolarising concentrations of K+ or BayK 8644. Similar inhibition was observed when ceramide metabolism was inhibited by a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor. In contrast, the potentiation of cAMP and cGMP accumulation caused by other intracellular Ca(2+)-elevating agents such as ionomycin or thapsigargin or by an activator of protein kinase C was not affected by ceramide. Taken together, our results suggest that ceramide selectively inhibits cyclic nucleotide synthesis when the nucleotide synthesis is potentiated by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ through L-type Ca2+ channels and that the sphingomyelin cycle probably plays an important role in the regulation of these channels.", 
    "138": "We examined the relationship between acute hypertension following cerebral embolization and subsequent hemorrhagic transformation (HT) in a rabbit embolic stroke model. We have shown previously that the likelihood and severity of hemorrhage were significantly correlated with the magnitude of an acute hypertensive response to embolization. It was not clear, however, whether hypertension actually caused hemorrhage or was merely a marker of more severe stroke. In the current studies, we attempted to clarify the relationship between acute hypertension and HT by either pharmacologically inducing or attenuating the brief hypertensive response to embolization in rabbits. Under halothane anesthesia, two catheters were implanted in the right carotid arteries of male New Zealand white rabbits, one oriented toward the heart and one toward the brain. The animals were allowed to awaken and were embolized using blood clot emboli injected into the middle cerebral artery. Blood pressure was monitored via the second carotid catheter. In the first experiment, hypertension was induced with angiotensin II, administered at the time of embolization or 1 h later. In the second experiment, we attempted to attenuate the hypertensive response using intravenous labetalol. The animals were sacrificed 18 h after embolization and the brains evaluated for hemorrhage. In the first experiment, administration of angiotensin II immediately after embolization did not increase the hypertensive response to embolization further than that spontaneously occurring, and no angiotensin II-related HT was observed. In contrast, an additional angiotensin-II-induced hypertensive episode 1 h after embolization significantly increased the number of 5-mm serial brain sections displaying HT, from 3.0 +/- .3 (mean +/- SE) in Controls to 5.4 +/- .8 in treated animals. In the second experiment, administration of labetalol (15 mg/kg) significantly reduced the number of brain sections with visible HT, from 3.2 +/- .5 in controls to 1.6 +/- .4 in treated animals. Acute hypertension during the first hour after cerebral embolization promotes HT in this rabbit embolic stroke model. Labetalol prevents blood pressure elevation and reduces the extent of HT in the same model.", 
    "139": "Time courses of beta-adrenoceptor-blocking actions of ONO-1101, a new cardioselective beta-blocker, were compared with those of esmolol and propranolol by using the isolated, blood-perfused sinoatrial node (SAN) and papillary muscle (PM) preparations of dogs. ONO-1101 per se given intraarterially (i.a.) in each nutrient artery did not affect basal sinoatrial rates (SARs; 99 +/- 2 beats/min, n = 7) in the SAN and developed tension (DT; 3.2 +/- 0.7 g, n = 7) of the PM preparations. Norepinephrine (NE) injected i.a. into the each artery induced increases in SAR (42 +/- 6 beats/min at 0.051 +/- 0.014 microg) and PMDT (2.9 +/- 0.4 g at 0.048 +/- 0.011 microg). The i.a. injections of NE were repeated every 3 min after i.v. bolus injections of ONO- 1101 into the support dog. NE-induced increases in SAR and PMDT were maximally inhibited 3 to 6 min after the i.v. injections of ONO-1101. Maximal percentage inhibitions by ONO-1101 of NE-induced increases in SAR were 54 +/- 6, 78 +/- 3, and 96 +/- 2% at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg of the drug, respectively. Similarly, maximal percentage inhibitions by ONO-1101 of NE-induced increases in PMDT were 50 +/- 12, 93 +/- 2, and 100% +/- 0, respectively. The inhibition was quickly recovered; times required for 50% recovery (RT1/2) were 12 +/- 3. 17 +/- 3, and 32 +/- 10 min in the SAN preparation, and 13 +/- 3, 16 +/- 2, and 39 +/- 11 min in the PM preparations, after i.v. injections of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg of ONO-1101, respectively. In comparison, maximal percentage inhibitions by esmolol of NE-induced increases in SAR were 45 +/- 5, 79 +/- 6, and 96 +/- 2%, and those in PMDT were 34 +/- 4, 75 +/- 5, and 97 +/- 1%, whereas the RT1/2 values were 11 +/- 2, 15 +/- 4, and 40 +/- 12 min in the SAN preparation, and 10 +/- 2, 16 +/- 7, and 27 +/- 6 min in the PM preparations, after i.v. injections of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg of esmolol, respectively. In contrast, the maximal percentage inhibitions by an i.v. bolus injection of 0.1 mg/kg of propranolol of NE-induced increases in SAR and PMDT were 77 +/- 18% and 87 +/- 13% (n = 4). respectively. The maximal inhibitions were obtained 6-15 min after injections of propranolol and then slowly recovered only by 21% in the SAN and 8% in the PM preparations, even after 60 min. These results clearly demonstrate that ONO-1101 is an ultrashort-acting beta-blocker, but the recovery time is dose dependent, and that the beta-blocking action of ONO-1101 is almost similar to or slightly more potent (or both) than esmolol.", 
    "140": "Several agents have been used to treat cocaine-related cardiovascular complications and toxicity occurring in sensitive individuals, yet the causes of hemodynamic responsiveness and differential sensitivity to cocaine are unknown. In this study, we sought to examine the role of different mediators in a model of variable cardiovascular responses to cocaine. As noted previously in conscious rats, cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) responses to cocaine (5 mg/kg, i.v.) varied widely. Twenty of 34 rats exhibited cocaine-induced decreases in CO of > or =8% and large increases in SVR (designated vascular responders). The remaining rats with little change or an increase in CO and smaller increases in SVR were named mixed responders. Pretreatment with propranolol (1 mg/kg) or metoprolol (1 mg/kg) reduced heart rate. In mixed responders, propranolol or metoprolol reversed the cocaine-induced increase in CO and stroke volume and enhanced the increase in SVR, making these rats respond like vascular responders. Nicardipine (25 microg/kg) reduced the pressor response and selectively reversed the CO responses in vascular responders. N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 2.7 mg/kg) increased arterial pressure by increasing SVR. Cocaine induced greater pressor and SVR responses apparently because of a shift in baseline values elicited by L-NAME alone. Therefore, differences in hemodynamic responses patterns may be the result of differences in beta-adrenergic activation or subsequent calcium channel activation or both. We predict that calcium channel antagonists may be useful to treat cocaine-induced cardiovascular complications, whereas beta-adrenergic antagonists are not likely to be beneficial.", 
    "141": "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of adrenoceptor agonists on the intracellular calcium activity ([Ca2+]i), membrane voltage (Vm), and ion conductances (Gm) in differentiated mouse podocytes. [Ca2+]i was measured by the Fura-2 fluorescence method in single podocytes. Noradrenaline and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine induced a reversible and concentration-dependent biphasic increase of [Ca2+]i in podocytes (EC50 approximately 0.1 microM for peak and plateau), whereas the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14.304 did not influence [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i response induced by noradrenaline was completely inhibited by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (10 nM). In a solution with a high extracellular K+ (72.5 mM), [Ca2+]i was unchanged and the [Ca2+]i increase induced by noradrenaline was not inhibited by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine (1 microM). Vm and Gm were examined with the patch-clamp technique in the slow whole-cell configuration. Isoproterenol, phenylephrine, and noradrenaline depolarized podocytes and increased Gm. The order of potency for the adrenoceptor agonists was isoproterenol (EC50 approximately 1 nM) > noradrenaline (EC50 approximately 0.3 microM) > phenylephrine (EC50 approximately 0.5 microM). The beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118.551 (5 to 100 nM) inhibited the effect of isoproterenol on Vm. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin mimicked the effect of isoproterenol on Vm and Gm (EC50 approximately 40 nM). Isoproterenol induced a time- and concentration-dependent increase of cAMP in podocytes. The effect of isoproterenol was unchanged in the absence of Na+ or in an extracellular solution with a reduced Ca2+ concentration, whereas it was significantly increased in an extracellular solution with a reduced Cl- concentration (from 145 to 32 mM). The data indicate that adrenoceptor agonists regulate podocyte function: They increase [Ca2+]i via an alpha 1-adrenoceptor and induce a depolarization via a beta 2-adrenoceptor. The depolarization is probably due to an opening of a cAMP-dependent Cl- conductance.",

The barrier function of corneal epithelial cells in vivo was not impaired by treatment with PGF2 alpha, but it was significantly suppressed by timolol. The result of cell proliferation assay of human corneal cells showed that the 0.12% PGF2 alpha ophthalmic solution caused greater suppression of cell proliferation and acuter cell toxicity than 0.5% timolol ophthalmic solution. Further study showed that not the vehicle but the PGF2 alpha itself was responsible for these deleterious effects. We conclude that the 0.12% PGF2 alpha ophthalmic solution affects cell migration and proliferation but not the barrier effects of the ocular surface. These results suggest that the corneal epithelial defect of glaucoma patients may be caused by these two independent mechanisms, namely suppression of cell proliferation by PGF2 alpha and the destruction of the barrier function of the ocular surface by timolol.",

Considering the issue of therapeutic agents, medication should be based on drugs with proven efficacy for the treatment required, i.e., evidence-based medicine. Consideration of pharmacotherapy of ischemic heart disease in Japan from the aspect of improvement of long-term prognosis shows that calcium antagonists and nitrates, for which there is no evidence of improved long-term mortality, are commonly prescribed, whereas the use of beta-blockers, for which there is clear evidence of improvement, lags well behind Western countries. In the 1980s, when the efficacy of beta-blockers was proven in Western countries, calcium antagonists first appeared. Of course both patients and physicians tended to use these antagonists because of the excellent effects. Possibly the continuous marketing of new calcium antagonists has led to negative attitudes among physicians toward beta-blockers. In Japan close attention has never been paid to the FDA's advisory notice about nitrates issued in 1993. When a drug proves effective, then it becomes widely used. However, if a report demonstrates no efficacy of a drug, such evidence is not widely publicized in Japan even if the trial was internationally approved such as GISSI-3 (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico) and ISIS-4 (Fourth International Study of Infarct Survival). We should learn from the number of excellent megatrials conducted in Western countries. In treating patients, drugs with evidence of verified efficacy from those megatrials should be selected. The problems we have experienced with the short-acting calcium antagonists and Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) studies must not be repeated.",

Imipramine possesses such characteristics and is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the CYP2D6 enzyme. Possible synthetic strategies to avoid interaction with the enzyme have been investigated, including: attenuation of basicity; and alteration of rigidity and length of the alkyl chain. Imipramine inhibited the 1'-hydroxylation of bufuralol (10 microM), an in vitro marker of CYP2D6 activity, in a CYP2D6 cell line (IC50 = 2.4 microM). Inhibitory potency was attenuated by the removal of the basic centre; imipramine N-oxide had no inhibitory effect on bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation. However, removal of this basic centre, as a strategy to decrease CYP2D6 interaction, may well have a detrimental effect on pharmacological efficacy. Both an increase and decrease in the N-N carbon chain length [2C,4C] caused a reduction in inhibitory potency. In addition, introduction of a carbonyl adjacent to the amino dibenzyl moiety into 2C, 3C and 4C compounds brought about a further reduction in inhibitory potency. These data demonstrate that changes to the molecule, distal to the basic centre, can attenuate the affinity of the molecule for CYP2D6 and are in keeping with the known characteristics of the enzyme.", 
    "145": "To compare the effect of four drug groups on the ambulatory circadian blood pressure (BP) pattern, amiloride hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, nifedipine, and perindopril (5/50 mg/d, 100 mg/d, 40 mg/d, and 4 mg/d respectively, for 14 days) were alternated in each of 20 essential hypertension patients. Diuretics induced the largest (P < 0.05) drop in mean 24-hour systolic BP (-12 mmHg, P < 0.001). Atenolol reduced only its standard deviation, and nifedipine reduced only the mean daytime systolic BP (P < 0.05). The mean 24-hour diastolic BP was equally reduced by all drugs except nifedipine, which only reduced (P < 0.05) the mean daytime value. The mean 24-hour heart rate was decreased by atenolol (P < 0.001), increased by diuretics (P < 0.05), and unchanged with perindopril, while nifedipine increased (P < 0.05) only its night-time value. In conclusion, diuretics were the strongest agents in reducing systolic BP, atenolol the only agent that reduced variability, perindopril the only agent that did not affect the heart rate, and nifedipine reduced only daytime BP values.",

The most frequently prescribed medications were calcium channel blockers (26.1%), followed by diuretics (25.3%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (24.3%), and beta-blockers (20.0%). Other agents made up the remaining 4.3% of prescriptions. The proportions were similar for patients without complications who received one medication.",

Independent variables were age and sex of patients, duration of hypertension, total number of visits and number of visits for hypertension, number of physicians consulted at the clinic, associated medical conditions, diagnosis of target organ damage, blood pressure readings, and associated medications.", 
    "157": "Diuretics were prescribed most frequently (45.9%). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors ranked second (28.4%), followed by calcium channel blockers (26.2%) and beta-blockers (18.0%). Age, sex, duration of hypertension, and blood pressure readings were not associated with medications. Prescription of beta-blockers was strongly associated with previous myocardial infarction, but not with diagnosis of angina pectoris. Patients with contraindications to beta-blockers were less likely to receive them and more likely to receive calcium channel blockers. Only 32% of diabetic patients received ACE inhibitors.",
