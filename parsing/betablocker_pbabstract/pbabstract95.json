Seven patients had pre-existing vasopressor therapy, and all were tapered off vasopressors while on insulin. Two patients experienced pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest prior to high-dose insulin therapy. Intravenous fat emulsion was given to two patients. The mean maximum insulin infusion rate was 8.35 U/kg/h (mean = 8.35, SD 6.34). The mean duration of insulin infusion was 23.5 h (SD 19.7). The mean duration of glucose infusion post-insulin was 25.2 h (SD 17.7). The primary toxins were \u03b2-blocker in five, calcium channel blocker in two, combined \u03b2-blocker/calcium channel blocker in two, tricyclic antidepressant in one, and polydrug in 2. CLINICAL OUTCOMES: Eleven of 12 patients survived. One patient expired 9 h into insulin therapy from cardiac arrest shortly after the insulin was stopped and a vasopressor re-initiated (protocol deviation).",

ADVERSE SEQUELAE: Necrotic digits occurred in one patient with known clotting disorder after receiving high-dose norepinephrine and INR reversal with fresh frozen plasma prior to insulin therapy. One patient was discharged with mild anoxic injury thought due to pulseless electrical activity arrest prior to insulin therapy. Three of these 12 patients have been previously described in published case reports.",

Prior to implantation, she had experienced uncontrollable life-threatening arrhythmia in spite of high-dose administration of mexiletine. An ICD coil lead for transvenous use was placed in the intrapericardial and retrocardial space and was connected to a generator placed in front of the posterior sheath of the right abdominal rectal muscle. Administration of a beta-blocker in addition to atrial pacing almost completely eliminated the patient's life-threatening arrhythmia attacks. Intrapericardial and retrocardial implantation of ICD coil leads might be useful for children.", 
    "7": "Recent studies have shown that visit-to-visit blood pressure variability is a powerful risk factor for stroke, is reduced by calcium channel blockers and diuretics, and increased by \u03b2-blockers. However, it is unknown whether these effects are dose-dependent and persist in combination with other drugs.", 
    "8": "Cochrane and Medline databases were searched for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs. Eligible trials randomized all patients to a combination of drug classes or different doses of the same drug. Baseline and follow-up data for mean (SD) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure were extracted. Differences in interindividual variance (SD2) in blood pressure were expressed as a ratio (VR). Estimates were pooled by random-effects meta-analysis.",

Adding other agents to calcium channel blockers did not significantly affect SBP variability (VR, 1.06; 0.83 to 1.34; P=0.65; 12 trials; 1460 patients) despite a 5.8-mm Hg reduction in mean SBP. Randomization to a higher dose of calcium channel blockers reduced SBP variability (VR, 0.84; 0.74 to 0.94; P=0.004; 25 trials; 2179 patients), whereas randomization to a higher dose of \u03b2-blockers increased SBP variability (VR, 1.31; 1.01 to 1.69; P=0.034; 6 trials; 486 patients).",

    "13": "Thirty-six patients (28 men, 55 \u00b1 9 years) were included before undergoing catheter ablation. In the 24 hours preceding the procedure, 20 patients were in AF (group 1) and 16 were in sinus rhythm (SR, group 2). With 2 decapolar catheters, 1 in the right atrium (RA) and 1 in the left atrium (LA), 20 unipolar electrograms were simultaneously recorded during a 100-second AF-period (in group 2 after induction of AF). After atropine and metoprolol administration, a second 100-second AF-period was recorded 30 minutes later. Five patients of group 2 served as controls and did not receive atropine and metoprolol prior to the second recording. CFAEs were assessed and the prevalence of CFAEs was expressed as percentage of the recording time.", 
    "14": "The prevalence of CFAEs was greater in group 1 than in group 2 in both RA and LA (P = 0.026, P < 0.001, respectively). Atropine and metoprolol significantly reduced CFAEs in group 1 (P < 0.001) and prevented the time-dependent increase of CFAEs in group 2.",

    "16": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis occurs episodically in an ultradian manner approximately every 80-100 min during the waking phase of the circadian cycle, together with highly correlated increases in brain and body temperatures, suggesting that BAT thermogenesis contributes to brain and body temperature increases. We investigated this in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats by determining whether inhibition of BAT thermogenesis via blockade of beta-3 adrenoceptors with SR59230A interrupts ultradian episodic increases in brain and body temperatures and whether SR59230A acts on BAT itself or via sympathetic neural control of BAT. Interscapular BAT (iBAT), brain, and body temperatures, tail artery blood flow, and heart rate were measured in unrestrained rats. SR59230A (1, 5, or 10 mg/kg ip), but not vehicle, decreased iBAT, body, and brain temperatures in a dose-dependent fashion (log-linear regression P < 0.01, R(2) = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.4, respectively, n = 10). Ultradian increases in BAT, brain, and body temperature were interrupted by administration of SR59230A (10 mg/kg ip) compared with vehicle, resuming after 162 \u00b1 24 min (means \u00b1 SE, n = 10). SR59230A (10 mg/kg ip) caused a transient bradycardia without any increase in tail artery blood flow. In anesthetized rats, SR59230A reduced cooling-induced increases in iBAT temperature without affecting cooling-induced increases in iBAT sympathetic nerve discharge. Inhibition of BAT thermogenesis by SR59230A, thus, reflects direct blockade of beta-3 adrenoceptors in BAT. Interruption of episodic ultradian increases in body and brain temperature by SR59230A suggests that BAT thermogenesis makes a substantial contribution to these increases.", 
    "17": "It is proposed that intracellular amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), before extracellular plaque formation, triggers cognitive deficits in Alzheimer disease (AD). Here we report how intracellular A\u03b2 affects neuronal properties. This was done by injecting A\u03b2 protein into rat and mouse neocortical pyramidal cells through whole-cell patch pipettes and by using 3xTg AD model mice, in which intracellular A\u03b2 is accumulated innately. In rats, intracellular application of a mixed A\u03b2(1-42) preparation containing both oligomers and monomers, but not a monomeric preparation of A\u03b2(1-40), broadened spike width and augmented Ca(2+) influx via voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels in neocortical neurons. Both effects were mimicked and occluded by charybdotoxin, a blocker of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels, and blocked by isopimaric acid, a BK channel opener. Surprisingly, augmented Ca(2+) influx was caused by elongated spike duration, but not attributable to direct Ca(2+) channel modulation by A\u03b2(1-42). The A\u03b2(1-42)-induced spike broadening was blocked by electroconvulsive shock (ECS), which we previously showed to facilitate BK channel opening via expression of the scaffold protein Homer1a. In young 3xTg and wild mice, we confirmed spike broadening by A\u03b2(1-42), which was again mimicked and occluded by charybdotoxin and blocked by ECS. In Homer1a knock-out mice, ECS failed to block the A\u03b2(1-42) effect. Single-channel recording on BK channels supported these results. These findings suggest that the suppression of BK channels by intracellular A\u03b2(1-42) is a possible key mechanism for early dysfunction in the AD brain, which may be counteracted by activity-dependent expression of Homer1a.", 
    "18": "The postictal state is generally followed by antinociception. It is known that connections between the dorsal raphe nucleus, the periaqueductal gray matter, and the locus coeruleus, an important noradrenergic brainstem nucleus, are involved in the descending control of ascending nociceptive pathways. The aim of the present study was to determine whether noradrenergic mechanisms in the locus coeruleus are involved in postictal antinociception. Yohimbine (an \u03b1(2)-receptor antagonist) or propranolol (a \u03b2-receptor antagonist) was microinjected unilaterally into the locus coeruleus, followed by intraperitoneal administration of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a noncompetitive antagonist that blocks GABA-mediated Cl(-) influx. Although the administration of both yohimbine and propranolol to the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus area resulted in a significant decrease in tonic or tonic-clonic seizure-induced antinociception, the effect of yohimbine restricted to the locus coeruleus was more distinct compared with that of propranolol, possibly because of the presynaptic localization of \u03b1(2)-noradrenergic receptors in locus coeruleus neurons. These effects were related to the modulation of noradrenergic activity in the locus coeruleus. Interestingly, microinjections of noradrenaline into the locus coeruleus also decrease the postictal antinociception. The present results suggest that the mechanism underlying postictal antinociception involves both \u03b1(2)- and \u03b2-noradrenergic receptors in the locus coeruleus, although the action of noradrenaline on these receptors causes a paradoxical effect, depending on the nature of the local neurotransmission.", 
    "19": "Increased serum resistin was found in rodent models of obesity and insulin resistance, whereas contradictory results have been obtained in human studies. In humans, resistin is primarily released by monocytes/macrophages, suggesting that soluble levels may be associated with macrophage activation. Here, systemic and monocyte-released resistin levels were found to be similar in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients, overweight controls and normal-weight controls. When adjusted for body mass index and age, serum resistin modestly correlated with gamma-glutamyltransferase levels, fasting glucose and interleukin-6. Systemic resistin was marginally increased in T2D patients treated with beta-blockers or urate-lowering drugs and was considerably higher in patients treated with loop diuretics. Monocyte-released resistin was even reduced by the loop diuretic furosemide, excluding the possibility that this drug may directly stimulate resistin synthesis. In summary, the current data indicate that changes accompanying renal dysfunction but not obesity or type 2 diabetes are associated with increased serum resistin.", 
    "20": "Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), an endogenous \"gasotransmitter\", exists in the central nervous system. However, the central cardiovascular effects of endogenous H(2)S are not fully determined. The present study was designed to investigate the central cardiovascular effects and its possible mechanism in anesthetized rats. Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of NaHS (0.17~17 microg) produced a significant and dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) (P < 0.05) compared to control. The higher dose of NaHS (17 microg, n = 6) decreased BP and HR quickly of rats and 2 of them died of respiratory paralyse. Icv injection of the cystathionine beta-synthetase (CBS) activator s-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM, 26 microg) also produced a significant hypotension and bradycardia, which were similar to the results of icv injection of NaHS. Furthermore, the hypotension and bradycardia induced by icv NaHS were effectively attenuated by pretreatment with the K(ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide but not with the CBS inhibitor hydroxylamine. The present study suggests that icv injection of NaHS produces hypotension and bradycardia, which is dependent on the K(ATP) channel activation.", 
    "21": "Children with burn injuries receive a broad range of medications, from analgesics to antipsychotics, but how utilization of these drugs differs from one pediatric burn center to another is unclear. This study examined utilization patterns of six categories of medication administered acutely to burned children as a first step in creating evidence-based practice guidelines. Six medications administered to pediatric patients enrolled in a multicenter study were recorded from patient charts using a standardized chart review template. The medication categories included opiates, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, beta-blockers, two different anesthetics, and antipsychotics. Data were analyzed by \u03c7 and logistical regression analysis. Analysis of data from three sites and 470 patients revealed significant differences in prescription patterns across hospitals for all medication groups except opiates. Differences were significant for benzodiazepines and antidepressants (\u03c7 = 7.3; P < .01 for both) controlling for age, gender, race, language, burn size, and length of stay. Differences in prescribing patterns for beta-blockers and the anesthetics ketamine and propofol failed to reach statistical significance; however, the results did trend in that direction (\u03c7 = 3.8 and 3.4, respectively; P < .10 for both). The pharmacotherapeutic agents described in this study are an integral part of acute pediatric burn care, and yet there is variation in use of these medications among the centers. The differences in prescribing indicate that, for certain drugs, a range of approaches to pharmacotherapeutics is being used and suggest that evidence-based guidelines for administration of these agents need to be developed.",

Additionally, the spectrum of drugs prescribed is constantly changing, particularly with cardiovascular diseases and it is not necessarily the case that drugs that had shown safety earlier will always show safety. Clinicians are encouraged to develop their knowledge of CYP-mediated DDIs so that they can choose safe drug combination regimens, adjust drug dosages appropriately and conduct therapeutic drug monitoring for drugs with narrow therapeutic indices.", 
    "29": "Oral propranolol has become a promising treatment of capillary hemangiomas (CHs) despite concerns of side effects associated with systemic beta-blockers. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of propranolol in periocular tissues and in plasma after topical application of propranolol as compared with intravenous and oral administration of propranolol.",

    "31": "After topical instillation of 1.5 mg propranolol, high amounts of propranolol were rapidly delivered to the eyelids and extraocular muscles (4-32 \u03bcg/g at 1 h after dosing). The drug in these tissues was slowly cleared, and significant amounts of the drug (>0.4 \u03bcg/g) were still present at 24 h after the topical application. After oral administration of a clinically relevant dose of 5 mg propranolol, the drug concentrations in the periocular tissues were relatively low (<0.4 \u03bcg/g) at 1 h after dosing and generally undetectable at 8 h after dosing. After an intravenous injection of 1.5 mg propranolol, the drug concentrations in the eyelids and extraocular muscles were in the range of 0.2-1 \u03bcg/g at 1 h after dosing. The plasma concentration of the drug after the intravenous injection was significantly higher than that after topical application of the same dose. The higher drug concentrations in the periocular tissues of the treated eyes as compared with untreated eyes suggest direct penetration of the drug into the periocular tissues from the administration site after topical application.",

Psychosocial and clinicofunctional features typical for elderly people of behavioral type A and with diagnosed CHD and ways for treatment optimization and disease prophylaxis are being under consideration. We studied the clinical efficiency and influence of Anaprilin, Metoprolol, Phenazepam, non-medical methods on psychoendocrine parameters in CHD elderly patients with behavioral type A. In addition to positive changes in the anginal syndrome sleep, decreases in hot temper, irritability, anxiety, phobic manifestations, hypochondrial trends, and neurotic asthenization, increased working and social orientation were improved. During Anaprilin, Metoprolol, Phenazepam therapy, cardialgias reduced or disappered, the incidence of arrhythmia decreased. There was a reduction in the personality profile in the neurotic triad and psychoasthenia scales, the reactive anxiety diminished significantly, and levels of aldosterone, cortisol, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine in the blood decreased. Thus, supplementation of Anapriline, Metoprolol, Phenazepam to the combined therapy for patients with CHD of behavioral type A positively effected to the clinical course of the disease.

Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, which is considered a doping agent in shoot practice, so that its determination in urine can be required for monitoring the drug. Loss of trilinearity due to analyte-background interactions which may vary between samples, as well as inner filter effects, precludes the use of methods like parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) that cannot handle trilinearity deviations, and justifies the employment of U-PLS. Successful analysis required to include the background in the calibration set. Unexpected components appear in new urine samples, different from those used in calibration set, requiring the second-order advantage which is obtained from a separate procedure known as residual bilinearization (RBL). Satisfactory results were obtained for artificially spiked urines, and also for real urine samples. They were statistically compared with those obtained applying a reference method based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).",

The effects of three concentrations of aqueous-ethanolic extract, carvacrol, 10 nm chlorpheniramine, and saline on histamine (H(1) ) receptors were tested on three groups of guinea-pig tracheal chains as follows: incubated trachea with (i) indomethacin (n = 9), (ii) indomethacin, propranolol, and atropine (n = 7), and (iii) indomethacin and propranolol (n = 6). The EC(50) (effective concentration of histamine causing 50% of maximum response) obtained in the presence of chlorpheniramine for all concentrations of the extract and carvacrol in all three groups was significantly higher than that of saline (P < 0.001 for all cases). The EC(50) obtained in the presence of all concentrations of extract in groups 2 and 3 was lower than group 1 and in group 3 lower than group 2 (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001). However, EC(50) obtained in the presence of all concentrations of carvacrol in group 3 and two higher concentrations in group 2 was higher than that of group 1 (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the maximum response obtained in the presence of different concentrations of extract and carvacrol between three groups. There was a parallel rightward shift in concentration-response curves obtained in the presence of all concentrations of the extract and carvacrol in all three groups. These results indicated an inhibitory effect of Z. multiflora and its constituent carvacrol on histamine H(1) receptors.", 
    "48": "ATP is thought to be released to the extracellular compartment by neurons and astrocytes during neural activation. We examined whether ATP exerts its effect of promoting pial arteriolar dilation (PAD) directly or upon conversion (via ecto-nucleotidase action) to AMP and adenosine. Blockade of extracellular direct ATP to AMP conversion, with ARL-67156, significantly reduced sciatic nerve stimulation-evoked PADs by 68%. We then monitored PADs during suffusions of ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine in the presence and absence of the following: 1) the ecto-5'-nucleotidase inhibitor \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene adenosine 5'-diphosphate (AOPCP), 2) the A(2) receptor blocker ZM 241385, 3) the ADP P2Y(1) receptor antagonist MRS 2179, and 4) ARL-67156. Vasodilations induced by 1 and 10 \u03bcM, but not 100 \u03bcM, ATP were markedly attenuated by ZM 241385, AOPCP, and ARL-67156. Substantial loss of reactivity to 100 \u03bcM ATP required coapplications of ZM 241385 and MRS 2179. Dilations induced by ADP were blocked by MRS 2179 but were not affected by either ZM 241385 or AOPCP. AMP-elicited dilation was partially inhibited by AOPCP and completely abolished by ZM 241385. Collectively, these and previous results indicate that extracellular ATP-derived adenosine and AMP, via A(2) receptors, play key roles in neural activation-evoked PAD. However, at high extracellular ATP levels, some conversion to ADP may occur and contribute to PAD through P2Y(1) activation.",

Multivariate analysis was performed and the adjusted odds ratio for 28-day mortality for an infarction occuring in 2005 (compared with 1995) was 0.62 (95% confidence interval: 0.44-0.88) whereas the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality at 6 months was 0.40 (95% confidence interval: 0.24-0.67). Other variables independently associated with lower mortality at 28 days were: reperfusion therapy, and the use of anti-thrombotic treatment, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The 28-day-6-month period had an independent protective effect on the following therapies: coronary reperfusion, and prescription of antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers and lipid lowering drugs upon discharge.",

    "53": "Bovine follicular cysts (FCs) are a common cause of economic loss in modern dairy herds. Their aetiopathogenesis is not completely understood, even though an inadequate hypothalamic release of GnRH at the time of ovulation is considered to be their main cause. Much evidence, however, suggests a role for adrenergic innervation in ovarian functions, such as follicular development, steroid hormone secretion, and follicular contractility, the latter being an event important for ovulation. Moreover, in humans, polycystic ovary syndrome, a disease very similar to bovine follicular cysts, is characterised by increased density of adrenergic nerves. Given these premises, the aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness and mode of action of a novel strategy for the treatment of bovine follicular cysts. In the in vivo experiment, 170 Friesian cows diagnosed with follicular cysts were assigned to four groups (groups A, B, C, and D) to assess the effects of epidural administration of a \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist (carazolol) alone or in combination with a GnRH analogue (lecirelin). The four groups underwent the following treatments: Group A was administered lecirelin in combination with carazolol; Group B was administered carazolol; Group C was administered lecirelin; and Group D was administered only normal saline solution. In the in vitro experiment, strips of the walls of cystic follicles recovered post-mortem were suspended in an organ bath, connected to an isometric force transducer and exposed to increasing doses of epinephrine or to the same treatment after exposure to carazolol for 15 min (n = 10). The amplitude and frequency of the contractile activity were recorded. None of the control cows was observed in oestrus or was submitted to AI. The combination of lecirelin and carazolol induced a significant increase in the number of cows in oestrus (88%) compared to lecirelin alone or to carazolol alone (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The combination of lecirelin and carazolol and lecirelin alone were significantly more efficacious than carazolol alone (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). In the in vitro experiment, epinephrine increased the amplitude of the contractions of the strips in a dose-dependent manner. This response was significantly enhanced in strips pre-treated with carazolol. The treatments had no effect on the frequency of contractions. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that the epidural administration of a GnRH analogue and a \u03b2-adrenergic blocker is an effective means of treating cows with cystic ovarian disease. Moreover, it confirms, from a clinical point of view, that alterations of the adrenergic system and of the contractility of the follicular wall can be considered aetiopathogenic factors involved in the development of FCs. The results of this study lay the basis for a new therapeutic approach to FCs.", 
    "54": "Drug screening on sodium currents of native myofibers by means of voltage-clamp recordings is predictive of pre-clinical anti-myotonic activity in vivo and ex vivo. By this approach we identified the N-benzylated beta-proline derivative of tocainide (To10) as the most potent use-dependent blocker of Nav1.4 so far. We tested novel analogs with modifications on the pharmacophore groups of To10. The substitution of the proline cycle with less planar piperidine or piperazine rings disclosed the importance of a two carbon atom distance and/or an additional nitrogen atom for potency. Structural changes on the xylididic group corroborated the role of a proper electronic cloud for hydrophobic interactions with the binding site. The N-benzylated moiety lead to a stereoselective behavior only in the rigid alpha-proline analog To11 vs. To10 and N-benzylated tocainide (To12). The results confirm the strict structural requirements of Nav1.4 blockers and allow to refine the drug design toward novel anti-myotonic drugs.",

Patients with prior iPVI, compared with those without a prior iPVI, were more likely to be women (32 vs 41%; P = .04), less likely to have tissue loss (52% vs 63%; P = .02), more likely to require arm vein conduit (16% vs 5%; P = .001), and more likely to be on statin (71% vs 54%; P = .01) and beta blocker therapy (92% vs 81%; P = .01) at the time of their bypass procedure. Other demographic factors were similar between these groups. Prior PVI or bypass did not alter 30-day MAE and 1-year mortality after the index bypass. In contrast, 1-year major amputation and 1-year graft occlusion rates were significantly higher in patients who had prior iPVI than those without (31% vs 20%; P = .046 and 28% vs 18%; P = .009), similar to patients who had a prior ipsilateral bypass (1 year major amputation, 29% vs 20%; P = .022; 1 year graft occlusion, 33% vs 18%; P = .001). Independent multivariate predictors of higher 1-year amputation and graft occlusion rates were prior iPVI, prior ipsilateral bypass, dialysis dependence, prosthetic conduit and distal (tibial and pedal) bypass target.",

    "59": "Acute \u03b2-blockade with metoprolol has been associated with increased mortality by undefined mechanisms. Since metoprolol is a relatively high affinity blocker of \u03b2(2)-adrenoreceptors, we hypothesized that some of the increased mortality associated with its use may be due to its abrogation of \u03b2(2)-adrenoreceptor-mediated vasodilation of microvessels in different vascular beds. Cardiac output (CO; pressure volume loops), mean arterial pressure (MAP), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF; laser Doppler), and microvascular brain tissue Po(2) (G2 oxyphor) were measured in anesthetized mice before and after acute treatment with metoprolol (3 mg/kg iv). The vasodilatory dose responses to \u03b2-adrenergic agonists (isoproterenol and clenbuterol), and the myogenic response, were assessed in isolated mesenteric resistance arteries (MRAs; \u223c200-\u03bcm diameter) and posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs \u223c150-\u03bcm diameter). Data are presented as means \u00b1 SE with statistical significance applied at P < 0.05. Metoprolol treatment did not effect MAP but reduced heart rate and stroke volume, CO, rCBF, and brain microvascular Po(2), while concurrently increasing systemic vascular resistance (P < 0.05 for all). In isolated MRAs, metoprolol did not affect basal artery tone or the myogenic response, but it did cause a dose-dependent impairment of isoproterenol- and clenbuterol-induced vasodilation. In isolated PCAs, metoprolol (50 \u03bcM) impaired maximal vasodilation in response to isoproterenol. These data support the hypothesis that acute administration of metoprolol can reduce tissue oxygen delivery by impairing the vasodilatory response to \u03b2(2)-adrenergic agonists. This mechanism may contribute to the observed increase in mortality associated with acute administration of metoprolol in perioperative patients.", 
    "60": "Acid/base mobile phase modifiers affect enantioseparations in ways that are not fully understood yet, for the lack of systematic studies. This makes chiral analysis of some pharmaceuticals difficult to reproduce. Once a column has been exposed to a modifier, the selectivity of certain pairs of enantiomers may change, for the better or the worse. We study the behavior of five enantiomeric pairs, three which are highly sensitive to the addition of certain modifiers and two that have little sensitivity to these modifiers. Their use permits the determination of the extent of the memory effect response on individual columns. The selectivity of 4-chlorophenylalanine methyl and ethyl ester, and of ketoprofen improve as a solution of ethanesulfonic acid is percolated through the column. As a result, these pairs are most useful for the determination of the extent of acid memory effect on a column. The selectivity of propranolol HCl and, to a lesser degree, Tr\u00f6ger's base increases as a solution of diisopropylethylamine is percolated through the column. The separation of each one of these five pairs is inversely affected by the percolation of the opposite acid/base solution. We used trans-stilbene oxide (TSO) as a 'standard' to determine the column stability because no memory effect is observed for it (its retention, enantioselectivity, and resolution remain constant). Understanding whether a column is under the influence of the memory effect is critical to both the analysis of pharmaceutical ingredients and to the development of preparative purification techniques for racemic mixtures. Thus, columns that were unreliable for method development and method transfer, due to the memory effect and a lack of proper solvent exposure records, can now be used.",

    "62": "Hypoxia is a naturally occurring environmental challenge for embryonic reptiles, and this is the first study to investigate the impact of chronic hypoxia on the in ovo development of autonomic cardiovascular regulation and circulating catecholamine levels in a reptile. We measured heart rate (f(H)) and chorioallantoic arterial blood pressure (MAP) in normoxic ('N21') and hypoxic-incubated ('H10'; 10% O(2)) American alligator embryos (Alligator mississippiensis) at 70, 80 and 90% of development. Embryonic alligator responses to adrenergic blockade with propranolol and phentolamine were very similar to previously reported responses of embryonic chicken, and demonstrated that embryonic alligator has \u03b1 and \u03b2-adrenergic tone over the final third of development. However, adrenergic tone originates entirely from circulating catecholamines and is not altered by chronic hypoxic incubation, as neither cholinergic blockade with atropine nor ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium altered baseline cardiovascular variables in N21 or H10 embryos. In addition, both atropine and hexamethonium injection did not alter the generally depressive effects of acute hypoxia - bradycardia and hypotension. However, H10 embryos showed significantly higher levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline at 70% of development, as well as higher noradrenaline at 80% of development, suggesting that circulating catecholamines reach maximal levels earlier in incubation for H10 embryos, compared to N21 embryos. Chronically elevated levels of catecholamines may alter the normal balance between \u03b1 and \u03b2-adrenoreceptors in H10 alligator embryos, causing chronic bradycardia and hypotension of H10 embryos measured in normoxia.",

Also, intra-tracheal administration of E121 resulted in a significant inhibition of both the citric acid-induced cough response and airway obstruction compared to vehicle-pretreated animals. By contrast, i.c.v. administration had no effect. Finally, E121 significantly inhibited carbachol-induced airway smooth muscle contractions, an effect that was reduced by both glibenclamide and propranolol. Interestingly, E121 enhanced histamine-induced cAMP release in human eosinophils although it did not directly elevate cAMP levels.",

    "99": "This was a retrospective cohort study of patients attending an HF Disease Management Programme with mean follow-up of 2.9 \u00b1 2.4 years. Chart review confirmed B2A use, dose and duration of use, and documented pulmonary function evaluation. The primary endpoint was the effect of B2A use compared with no B2A use on mortality using unadjusted and adjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Data were available for 1294 patients (age 70.6 \u00b1 11.5 years) of whom 64% were male and 22.2% were taking B2As. \u03b22-Agonist users were older, more likely to be male, to have smoked, to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, and less likely to take beta-blockers. Multivariable associates of mortality included: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), coronary artery disease, age, and beta-blocker use. Unadjusted mortality rates for B2A users were found to be significantly higher than non-B2A users [hazard ratio (HR) 1.304, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.030-1.652, P= 0.028]. However, when adjusted for age, sex, medication, co-morbidity, smoking, COPD, and BNP differences, overall mortality rates were similar [HR 1.043, 95% CI (0.771-1.412), P= 0.783].",

    "101": "Inhibitory interneurons across diverse brain regions commonly exhibit spontaneous spiking activity, even in the absence of external stimuli. It is not well understood how stimulus-evoked inhibition can be distinguished from background inhibition arising from spontaneous firing. We found that noradrenaline simultaneously reduced spontaneous inhibitory inputs and enhanced evoked inhibitory currents recorded from principal neurons of the mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Together, these effects produced a large increase in signal-to-noise ratio for stimulus-evoked inhibition. Surprisingly, the opposing effects on background and evoked currents could both be attributed to noradrenergic silencing of spontaneous spiking in glycinergic interneurons. During spontaneous firing, glycine release was decreased due to strong short-term depression. Elimination of background spiking relieved inhibitory synapses from depression and thereby enhanced stimulus-evoked inhibition. Our findings illustrate a simple yet powerful neuromodulatory mechanism to shift the balance between background and stimulus-evoked signals.",

    "107": "This study examined the role of sympathetic nerves in the control of cerebral hemodynamics during air-jet stress. In adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, blood flow velocity (pulsed Doppler) was measured in both internal carotid arteries 1 week after excision of one superior cervical ganglion. Blood pressure (BP) and carotid blood flows (CBFs) were simultaneously recorded during exposure to air-jet stress. In 5 out of 13 rats, stress was applied after \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor blockade with ICI 118551 (0.4 mg/kg, then 0.2 mg/kg/h, i.v). Stress evoked an immediate rise in BP, CBFs, and vascular conductances. Vasodilatation was much larger on the denervated side than on the intact side (mean \u00b1 SEM: 78 \u00b1 7 versus 19 \u00b1 4%; P < 0.02) and lasted about 10 s. Thereafter, blood flows returned to or near normal and showed parallel variations while BP remained elevated. There was, therefore, a net vasoconstriction on both sides. In ICI 118551-treated rats, the initial vasodilatation was not significantly reduced on the denervated side (64 \u00b1 4%), but the subsequent vasoconstriction was enhanced (P < 0.05) on both sides. In conclusion, air-jet stress evokes an immediate, short-lasting vasodilatation through a mechanism unrelated to \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation. Sympathetic nerves powerfully limit this phenomenon, and thus contribute to protect the cerebral circulation from stress-induced BP surges.", 
    "108": "Severe injury is accompanied by sympathetic stimulation that induces bone marrow (BM) dysfunction by both suppression of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) growth and loss of cells via HPC mobilization to the peripheral circulation and sites of injury.

Propranolol (10 mg/kg) was given either prior to or immediately after HS. Blood pressure, heart rate, BM cellularity, and death were recorded. Bone marrow HPC growth was assessed by counting colony-forming unit-granulocyte-, erythrocyte-, monocyte-, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), and colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) cells.",

Beta-blockade given after HS increased the growth of CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-E significantly and improved BM cellularity compared with HS alone. The mortality rate was not increased in the groups receiving BB.", 
    "111": "Administration of propranolol either prior to injury or immediately after resuscitation significantly reduced post-shock BM suppression. After HS, BB may improve BM cellularity by decreasing HPC mobilization. Therefore, the early use of BB post-injury may play an important role in attenuating the BM dysfunction accompanying HS.", 
    "112": "To overcome the limitations of common eye drops, the study developed a novel timolol mealate (TM) liposomal-hydrogel to enhance drug permeability and prolong residence time in the precorneal region, which achieved more effective local glaucomatous therapeutic effect. Firstly, TM liposome was prepared by an ammonium sulfate gradient-pH regulation method, which its entrapment efficiency reached up to 94% and its averaged particle size is 187\u2009nm with narrow distribution. The corneal permeability through isolated rabbit cornea was measured by modified Franz-type diffusion cells. The results of trans-corneal penetration exhibited that the apparent permeability coefficients (P(app)) and the flow rates of steady state (J(ss)) of TM liposome was 1.50-fold higher than that of the commercialized eye drop, while TM liposome with 0.02% transcutol P was 2.19 times. In order to increase the retention time and improve the stability of liposome, we further developed a TM liposomal-hydrogel formulation by adding 1.0% HPMC K4M in TM liposome. The results showed an stability during a 120 days storage period than TM liposome. Precorneal retention study in vivo indicated that the optimal liposomal-hydrogel formulation had improved bioavailability and its retention time on rabbit corneal surface were significantly longer than that of pure liposomes or eye-drops. No obvious irritations to rabbit eyes were observed by histopathology microscopy after 7 days exposure.. Comparing to the eye drops, the TM liposomal-gel displayed prolonged therapeutic effect in cornea and greatly lowered the intraocular pressure IOP on the eyes of normal and glaucomatous pigmented rabbits.",

After 5 years, although there was no difference in number of glaucoma medicines prescribed between groups (1.0 PTGs and 1.1 timolol, P=0.41), the timolol group demonstrated a higher intraocular pressure (17.7\u00b12.9 vs. 16.5\u00b13.0 mm Hg, P<0.001), more medication changes (P=0.01), greater incidence of glaucomatous progression (P=0.04), and less patients persistent on original monotherapy (P<0.001) than the PTG cohort.",

Vincristine has emerged as an alternative to interferon for steroid-resistant cases because of interferon's adverse effects, especially neurotoxicity. \u03b2-Blockers are now the preferred first-line therapy for problematic cases. There is increasing evidence that infantile hemangioma is a disorder of aberrant proliferation and differentiation of primitive mesoderm-derived neural crest phenotypic cells.

Effective management of patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina should consist of therapy aimed at symptom control and reduction of adverse clinical outcomes. Therapeutic options for angina include antianginal drugs: nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ranolazine, and myocardial revascularization. Recent trials have shown that although revascularization is slightly better in controlling symptoms, optimal medical therapy that includes aggressive risk factor modification is equally effective in reducing the risk of future coronary events and death. On the basis of the available data, it seems appropriate to prescribe optimal medical therapy in most patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina, and reserve myocardial revascularization for selected patients with disabling symptoms despite optimal medical therapy.",

    "132": "Disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), which are the foundation of multiple sclerosis (MS) care, reduce clinical exacerbations (relapses) and slow disease progression; however, improving quality of life (QOL) is an unmet need for many individuals with MS. DMTs, including interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, and fingolimod, reduce the rate and severity of relapses, the accumulation of brain and spinal cord lesions as shown on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and disability progression. Many studies link diminished QOL with specific MS symptoms (fatigue, impaired mobility, spasticity, etc). Even in patients already receiving DMTs, symptoms and QOL may improve with additional agents that treat specific symptoms, thereby improving patient function and ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Patients have reported that mobility impairment is one of the worst aspects of MS. Almost half of patients treated with DMTs reported no improvement in mobility. However, blocking the voltage-dependent potassium channels on the surface of demyelinated nerve fibers may improve signal conduction. Dalfampridine, a potassium channel blocker, received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for all forms of MS specifically to improve walking, which was demonstrated by increased walking speed. By improving walking in some patients with MS, the effects of dalfampridine may complement those of DMTs and address the stated priorities of many patients.", 
    "133": "Based on stability studies on the drugs atenolol and propranolol and some of their derivatives it is believed that increasing the lipophilicity of the drug will lead to an increase in the stability of its aqueous solutions and will provide a prodrug system with the potential for releasing atenolol in a controlled manner. Using DFT theoretical calculations we have calculated an intramolecular acid catalyzed hydrolysis in nine maleamic (4-amino-4-oxo-2butenoic) acids (Kirby's N-alkylmaleamic acids), 1-9. The DFT calculations confirmed that the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis mechanism in these systems involves: (1) a proton transfer from the hydroxyl of the carboxyl group to the adjacent amide carbonyl carbon, (2) an approach of the carboxylate anion toward the protonated amide carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral intermediate; and (3) a collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate into products. Furthermore, DFT calculations in different media revealed that the reaction rate-limiting step depends on the reaction medium. In aqueous medium the rate-limiting step is the collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate whereas in the gas phase the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate is the rate-limiting step. Furthermore, the calculations establish that the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis efficiency is largely sensitive to the pattern of substitution on the carbon-carbon double bond. Based on the experimental t(1/2) (the time needed for the conversion of 50% of the reactants to products) and EM (effective molarity) values for processes 1-9 we have calculated the t(1/2) values for the conversion of the two prodrugs to the parental drug, atenolol. The calculated t(1/2) values for ProD 1-2 are predicted to be 65.3 hours and 11.8 minutes, respectively. Thus, the rate by which atenolol prodrug undergoes cleavage to release atenolol can be determined according to the nature of the linker of the prodrug (Kirby's N-alkylmaleamic acids 1-9).", 
    "134": "The objective of this study was to study the effect of four different bile salts, cholate (C), deoxycholate (DC), taurocholate (TC), monoketocholate (MKC), on the membrane binding of a cationic model drug, propranolol, using capillary electrophoresis. The apparent distribution coefficient of propranolol in a buffer/liposome system, in the absence and presence of various concentrations of the bile salts, was measured using capillary electrophoresis frontal analysis. At bile salt concentrations which did not disrupt the liposomes, the bile salts increased the apparent distribution coefficient of propranolol in a concentration-dependent manner, to various extents (DC>C>TC>MKC). The mechanisms for these increases were inferred from studies of ion pairing between bile salts and propranolol using mobility shift affinity capillary electrophoresis and from zeta potential measurements. The bile salts ion-paired with propranolol to different extents as indicated by the estimated complexation constants (K range: 30-58 M(-1)). This was found to have a minor effect on the membrane distribution of propranolol only. The major effect is proposed to be due to the insertion of bile salt into the liposomal membranes leading to a more negatively charged membrane surface thereby providing stronger electrostatic interactions with the positively charged propranolol.",

Clonidine or moxonidine effects on cue-induced reinstatement were reversed by the selective \u03b1(2) receptor antagonist RS-79948, indicating a role for \u03b1(2) receptors. Prazosin and propranolol, antagonists at the \u03b1(1) and \u03b2 receptor, respectively, reduced cue-induced reinstatement only when administered in combination. Finally, the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 antagonist CP-154,526 reduced cue-induced reinstatement, as previously observed for stress-induced reinstatement, indicating possible overlap between stress and cue mechanisms.",

Progressive reduction sensitivity and/or reactivity of beta-adrenoreceptor may be induced by changing structural sensitivity, reducing their number, or depletion of intracellular ATP; it may involve in pathogenesis of age-related hypertension, heart failure, type II diabetes and other diseases, The findings suggests that the erythrocyte could be a new therapeutic marker in the treatment different diseases.", 
    "153": "How drugs bind to their receptors--from initial association, through drug entry into the binding pocket, to adoption of the final bound conformation, or \"pose\"--has remained unknown, even for G-protein-coupled receptor modulators, which constitute one-third of all marketed drugs. We captured this pharmaceutically critical process in atomic detail using the first unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in which drug molecules spontaneously associate with G-protein-coupled receptors to achieve final poses matching those determined crystallographically. We found that several beta blockers and a beta agonist all traverse the same well-defined, dominant pathway as they bind to the \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptors, initially making contact with a vestibule on each receptor's extracellular surface. Surprisingly, association with this vestibule, at a distance of 15 \u212b from the binding pocket, often presents the largest energetic barrier to binding, despite the fact that subsequent entry into the binding pocket requires the receptor to deform and the drug to squeeze through a narrow passage. The early barrier appears to reflect the substantial dehydration that takes place as the drug associates with the vestibule. Our atomic-level description of the binding process suggests opportunities for allosteric modulation and provides a structural foundation for future optimization of drug-receptor binding and unbinding rates.",

    "155": "This review describes the pathogenic mechanisms of blood pressure (BP) regulation and long-term control in thyroid disorders. Variations from the euthyroid status affect virtually all physiological systems but the effects on the cardiovascular system are particularly pronounced. Thyroid disorders induce several hemodynamic changes leading to elevated BP as a consequence of their interaction with endothelial function, vascular reactivity, renal hemodynamic and renin-angiotensin system. However, in thyroid disorders, the regulation of BP and the development and maintenance of variable forms of arterial hypertension (HT) are different. Hyperthyroidism results in an increased endothelium-dependent responsiveness secondary to the shear stress induced by the hyperdynamic circulation, and contributes to reduce vascular resistance. Conversely, hypothyroidism is accompanied by a marked decrease in sensitivity to sympathetic agonists with an increase of peripheral vascular resistance and arterial stiffness. Furthermore in animal models, hypothyroidism reduces the endothelium-dependent and nitric oxide-dependent vasodilatation. HT due to thyroid disorders is usually reversible with achievement of euthyroidism, but in some cases pharmacological treatment for BP control is required. In hyperthyroidism, \u03b2-blockers are the first-choice treatment to control BP but when they are contraindicated or not tolerated, ACE-inhibitors or calcium-channel blockers (CCB) are recommended. Hypothyroidism is a typical low rennin HT form showing a better antihypertensive response to CCB and diuretics; indeed in hypothyroidism a low-sodium diet seems further to improve BP control. Randomized clinical trials to compare the efficacy on BP control of the antihypertensive treatment in thyroid disorders are needed.",

    "160": "The therapeutic arsenal for hemangiomas in early childhood can now be considered to include oral \u03b2-blockers, mainly propranolol. These drugs are thought to act as vasoconstrictors, regulating angiogenic pathways and inducing apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells. Although infantile hemangioma is not among the approved indications for \u03b2-blockers, many specialized clinics will prescribe propranolol before resorting to corticosteroids. A dosage of 2 mg/kg/d, is usually employed with a dosing interval of 8 hours. Propranolol is safe, causing few side effects, although cases of hypoglycemia, hypotension, diarrhea, reflux, cold hands and feet, bronchospasm, and hyperkalemia have been described. Generally, these adverse effects have not had serious consequences. Prescription in PHACE syndrome is controversial. In all cases, a cardiologist should assess the patient before treatment begins, blood pressure should be monitored, and pediatric follow-up should be scheduled. This review covers our current understanding of the indications, clinical response, and adverse effects of propranolol, a drug has revolutionized our attitude toward infantile hemangioma and the way we approach therapy. Clinical trials under way are also reviewed.", 
    "161": "The pacemaker channel isoforms are encoded by the hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) gene family and are responsible for diverse cellular functions including regulation of spontaneous activity in sino-atrial node cells and control of excitability in different types of neurons. Four channel isoforms exist (HCN1-HCN4). The hyperpolarization-activated cardiac pacemaker current (I(f)) has an important role in the generation of the diastolic depolarization in the sino-atrial node, while its neuronal equivalent (I(h)) is an important contributor to determination of resting membrane potential, and plays an important role in neuronal functions such as synaptic transmission, motor learning and generation of thalamic rhythms. Ivabradine is a novel, heart rate-lowering drug which inhibits the pacemaker (I(f)) current in the heart with high selectivity and with minimal effect on haemodynamic parameters. Ivabradine is beneficial in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris equally to beta receptor blocker and calcium channel antagonist drugs. There is increasing interest to apply this drug in other fields of cardiology such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhyhtmias. Heart rate reduction might improve clinical outcomes in heart failure. HCN upregulation presumably contributes to increased (I(f)) and may play a role in ventricular and atrial arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. In the nervous system the HCN channels received attention in the research areas of neuropathic pain, epilepsy and understanding the mechanism of action of volatile anaesthetics. This article delineates that the pharmacological modulation of cardiac and neuronal HCN channels can serve current or future drug therapy and introduces some recently investigated HCN channel inhibitor compounds being potential candidates for development.",

The percentage of patients reaching target IOP (\u226418 mmHg) after treatment with TTFC was 69.2% (P<0.001). Patients judged stinging/burning to be less severe with TTFC than with prior therapy (P=0.029); all other symptom frequencies and severities were similar for both treatments. Patients preferred TTFC over bimatoprost/timolol (fixed and unfixed) at a ratio of more than 4:1 (81.4% vs. 18.6%; P<0.001), and investigators reported a nearly five-fold preference for TTFC (83.3% vs. 16.7%; P<0.001).

    "166": "The aim of the present study is to review the literature and discuss nifekalant's potential use as a first aid drug in an emergency care setting. The PubMed database was used to identify papers, using keywords nifekalant, MS-551, amiodarone and lidocaine. Nifekalant hydrochloride, formally known as MS-551, is a class III antiarrhythmic agent which acts only by increasing the time course of myocardial repolarization. It was developed and is currently being used only in Japan for the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. It is a non-selective K(+) channel blocker without any \u03b2-blocking actions. Administration of nifekalant suppressed sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias in acute coronary syndrome patients, and in cardiac arrest victims as well as during or after cardiac surgery. The major adverse effect of nifekalant is QT interval prolongation and occurrence of torsades de pointes which requires frequent monitoring of the QT interval during nifekalant infusion with adequate dose adjustment. Nifekalant is a possible effective antiarrhythmic agent for refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Further clinical studies are required before nifekalant is routinely used in the emergency care setting.", 
    "167": "Transducers of regulated cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) activity (TORC) are coactivators that can increase CREB transcriptional activity, suggesting that TORC may regulate the transcription of Aanat, a CREB-target gene. In the present study, we focused on the regulation of TORC2 and its role in Aanat transcription in the rat pineal gland. Although there was no endogenous Torc2 mRNA rhythm in the rat pineal gland and treatment of cultured pinealocytes with norepinephrine (NE) had no effect on the mRNA level of Torc2, the phosphorylation state and intracellular distribution of TORC2 protein were regulated by NE. Immunoblot analysis combined with cytosolic/nuclear fractionation or phosphatase treatment showed that TORC2 protein was rapidly dephosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus after NE stimulation in rat pinealocytes. Similar dephosphorylation of TORC2 also occurred nocturnally in the rat pineal gland. The NE-mediated TORC2 dephosphorylation was blocked by cotreatment with propranolol (a \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist) but not prazosin (an \u03b1(1)-adrenergic antagonist) and mimicked by dibutyryl cAMP, indicating the participation of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor/cAMP pathway. Studies with protein phosphatase inhibitors showed that only okadaic acid and calyculin A were effective in blocking the NE-mediated TORC2 dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of protein phosphatase 2A in this dephosphorylation. Moreover, TORC2 overexpression had an enhancing effect on NE-stimulated Aanat transcription. Together, these results indicate that NE stimulation causes nuclear translocation of TORC2 by dephosphorylating the protein through a \u03b2-adrenoceptor/cAMP mechanism and that nuclear localization of TORC2 appears to regulate Aanat transcription by NE in the rat pineal gland.", 
    "168": "Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels generate the rhythmic beating of mammalian hearts. We identified an HCN homolog in the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, a nonvertebrate chordate which possesses a tubular heart that beats bidirectionally. Contractions initiate at one end of the heart and travel across the length of the organ, and these periodically reverse, suggesting the presence of two pacemakers, one on each side. We find that HCN expression is highly enriched in cells scattered throughout the myocardium. We functionally analyzed the role of HCN channels in heartbeat using the antagonists Cilobradine and Zatebradine, which decreased the heartbeat in a reversible manner. We also assessed the role of \u03b2-adrenoreceptors in regulating HCN function using the antagonist Metoprolol, which lowered heartbeat rate (HR), as well as the agonist Isoproterenol, which did not alter HR, but caused simultaneous beating, analogous to a fibrillation. Measurements of direction and velocity of blood flow by making use of a novel system to study heart function in model systems amenable to live imaging revealed a significant correlation between heartbeat arrhythmia and drug treatment, similar to that observed with the same drugs in vertebrates. These results suggest that the heart pacemaker in tunicates may be homologous to that in their vertebrate counterparts in both development and function.",

    "170": "Long-term memory (LTM) consolidation requires the synthesis of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs). In addition, we have shown recently that LTM formation also requires the setting of a \"learning tag\" able to capture those PRPs. Weak training, which results only in short-term memory, can set a tag to use PRPs derived from a temporal-spatial closely related event to promote LTM formation. Here, we studied the involvement of glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic inputs on the setting of an inhibitory avoidance (IA) learning tag and the synthesis of PRPs. Rats explored an open field (PRP donor) followed by weak (tag inducer) or strong (tag inducer plus PRP donor) IA training. Throughout pharmacological interventions around open-field and/or IA sessions, we found that hippocampal dopamine D1/D5- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors are specifically required to induce PRP synthesis. Moreover, activation of the glutamatergic NMDA receptors is required for setting the learning tags, and this machinery further required \u03b1-Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and PKA but not ERK1/2 activity. Together, the present findings emphasize an essential role of the induction of PRPs and learning tags for LTM formation. The existence of only the PRP or the tag was insufficient for stabilization of the mnemonic trace.",

From immunization until disease outbreak, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) has a proinflammatory influence which is converted into an anti-inflammatory influence after disease outbreak. This study investigated the influence of neuronally released neurotransmitters on IFN-\u03b3, KC (CXCL1), IL-6, and TGF-\u03b2 in spleen of mice shortly after outbreak of collagen type II-induced arthritis.",

The adrenergic influence via \u03b2-adrenoceptors stimulated release of IL-6 and, particularly, TGF-\u03b2. However, catecholamines inhibit release of IL-6 via \u03b11-adrenergic pathways but without any effect on TGF-\u03b2. The co-transmitter adenosine stimulated IL-6 release via A1-adenosine receptors but no influence was recognized on TGF-\u03b2.",

Blockade of I(Kr) by sotalol, blockade of I(Kur)/I(to) by AVE0118, and amiodarone did not affect NTP-induced AERP shortening, although they prolonged the AERP during normal breathing. Atropine given after amiodarone completely inhibited NTP-induced AERP shortening.

    "180": "Reconsolidation is the process by which memories require restabilisation following destabilisation at retrieval. Since even old, well-established memories become susceptible to disruption following reactivation, treatments based upon disrupting reconsolidation could provide a novel form of therapy for neuropsychiatric disorders based upon maladaptive memories, such as drug addiction. Pavlovian cues are potent precipitators of relapse to drug-seeking behaviour and influence instrumental drug seeking through at least three psychologically and neurobiologically distinct processes: conditioned reinforcement, conditioned approach (autoshaping) and conditioned motivation (pavlovian-instrumental transfer or PIT). We have previously demonstrated that the reconsolidation of memories underlying the conditioned reinforcing properties of drug cues depends upon NMDA receptor (NMDAR)- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR)-mediated signalling. However, it is unknown whether the drug cue memory representations underlying conditioned approach and PIT depend upon the same mechanisms.",

    "184": "Flufenamic acid (FFA) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It has anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. In addition, it modulates multiple channel activities. The mechanisms underlying the pharmacological actions of FFA are presently unclear. Given that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has both anti-inflammatory and channel-regulating functions, we examined whether FFA induces AMPK activation. 1) Exposure of several different types of cells to FFA resulted in an elevation of AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation at Thr172. This effect of FFA was reproduced by functionally and structurally similar mefenamic acid, tolfenamic acid, niflumic acid, and meclofenamic acid. 2) FFA-induced activation of AMPK was largely abolished by the treatment of cells with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator) or depletion of extracellular Ca(2+), whereas it was mimicked by stimulation of cells with the Ca(2+) ionophore 5-(methylamino)-2-({(2R,3R,6S,8S,9R,11R)-3,9,11-trimethyl-8-[(1S)-1-methyl-2-oxo-2-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)ethyl]-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undec-2-yl}methyl)-1,3-benzoxazole-4-carboxylic acid (A23187) or ionomycin. 3) FFA triggered a rise in intracellular Ca(2+), which was abolished by cyclosporine, a blocker of mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Cyclosporine also abolished FFA-induced activation of AMPK. 4) Inhibition of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase \u03b2 (CaMKK\u03b2) with 7-oxo-7H-benzimidazo[2,1-a]benz[de]isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid acetate (STO-609) or down-regulation of CaMKK\u03b2 with short interfering RNA largely abrogated FFA-induced activation of AMPK. 5) FFA significantly suppressed nuclear factor-\u03baB activity and inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression triggered by interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. This suppression was also largely abrogated by STO-609. Taken together, we conclude that FFA induces AMPK activation through the Ca(2+)-CaMKK\u03b2 pathway. Activation of AMPK is a presently unrecognized important mechanism underlying the pharmacological effects of FFA.", 
    "185": "Acidic phospholipid binding plays an important role in determining the tissue distribution of basic drugs. This article describes the use of surface plasmon resonance to measure binding affinity (K(D)) of three basic drugs to phosphatidylserine, a major tissue acidic phospholipid. The data are incorporated into mechanistic tissue composition equations to allow prediction of the steady-state volume of distribution (V(ss)). The prediction accuracy of V(ss) using this approach is compared with the original methodology described by Rodgers et al. (J Pharm Sci 94:1259-1276), in which the binding to acidic phospholipids is calculated from the blood/plasma concentration ratio (BPR). The compounds used in this study [amlodipine, propranolol, and 3-dimethylaminomethyl-4-(4-methylsulfanyl-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonamide (UK-390957)] showed higher affinity binding to phosphatidylserine than to phosphatidylcholine. When the binding affinity to phosphatidylserine was incorporated into mechanistic tissue composition equations, the V(ss) was more accurately predicted for all three compounds by using the surface plasmon resonance measurement than by using the BPR to estimate acidic phospholipid binding affinity. The difference was particularly marked for UK-390957, a sulfonamide that has a high BPR due to binding to carbonic anhydrase. The novel approach described in this article allows the binding affinity of drugs to an acidic phospholipid (phosphatidylserine) to be measured directly and demonstrates the utility of the binding data in the prediction of V(ss).",

Pretraining intra-IC infusion of the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist propranolol disrupted subsequent IA retention and impaired latent inhibition of IA, but had no effect on formation of memory for an inert context (termed incidental memory). These results indicate that IC \u03b2-adrenergic receptors are necessary for memory acquisition of an aversive, but not an inconsequential, context. Nevertheless, subsequent association of a familiar and hitherto inconsequential context with an unconditioned stimulus (US) does require activation of these receptors during its initial acquisition.",

Data were compared with those of 30 normoxemic cirrhotic controls (matched for age, gender, body mass index, etiology and severity of liver disease, smoking habits, hemoglobin level, and beta-blocker therapy). Resting cardiopulmonary parameters were within normal range in both groups except carbon monoxide lung transfer (TLCO, 60.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9 vs 74.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8% in controls, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004) and P(A-a)O(2) (28.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 vs 15.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg in controls, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

The maximal dose of study treatment was more frequently tolerated in patients receiving ivabradine (36/41) than in those receiving carvedilol (18/38) or combination therapy (32/42) (P<0.01 ivabradine versus carvedilol). Heart rate was reduced in all three groups, but to a greater extent by the combination. The distance walked on the 6-min walking test and the exercise time on MVO(2) test significantly improved in the ivabradine and combination groups (both P<0.01 versus baseline), as did peak VO(2) and VAT (P<0.01 for ivabradine and P<0.03 for combination versus carvedilol, respectively). No changes in these parameters were found with carvedilol.
