This study was undertaken to find out if early postoperative high-dose infusion of the selective beta 1-blocking agent metoprolol tartrate has additional effects on metabolic variables related to myocardial energy supply/demand balance compared with those obtained with a late preoperative oral dose. The study included 21 male patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting. All patients received an oral dose of metoprolol before the operation. After the operation, patients were randomized to a control group or a group receiving intravenous infusion of metoprolol. Myocardial uptake of oxygen and substrates was determined before and during atrial pacing. Metoprolol reduced arterial concentrations of free fatty acids, reduced myocardial uptake of free fatty acids, and enhanced myocardial uptake of lactate. During paced tachycardia, the metoprolol concentration correlated negatively with myocardial uptake of free fatty acids (r = -0.80; p < 0.001) and positively with myocardial uptake of lactate (r = 0.53; p < 0.05). It is concluded that postoperative infusion of metoprolol induces myocardial metabolic changes compatible with an improved energy supply/demand balance.", 
    "1": "We have previously shown that cardiovascular anomalies, such as hypertension and tachycardia, develop in Ca(2+)-deficient, shell-less (SL) chick embryos cultured ex ovo, accompanied by elevated circulating catecholamines and higher alpha-adrenergic sensitivity of cardiovascular functions. Results described in the preceding work, using erythrocytes as an experimental system, show that cellular Ca2+ handling properties are also altered as a result of long-term calcium deficiency. To examine the relevance of these findings to cells of the cardiovasculature, we have analyzed and compared the Ca2+ handling characteristics of the heart cells of SL and normal (NL) embryos. For this study, isolated and cultured ventricular myocytes of SL and NL embryos were loaded with Fura-2 via transient membrane damage with glass beads. Compared to Fura-2/AM, bead loading yielded similar values and kinetic profiles of [Ca2+]i-dependent differential fluorescence and, in addition, did not affect cell viability and beating activity. The Fura-2 loaded ventricular myocytes were washed in Ca(2+)-free buffer and then analyzed by ratiometric fluorescence (350 nm/380 nm) microscopy for kinetic changes in [Ca2+]i (R350/380 values) as a function of [Ca2+]o and adrenergic modifiers. At 0.5 and 1.0 mM [Ca2+]o, SL cells showed significantly higher [Ca2+]i, higher beating rates, and faster rate of increase in [Ca2+]i compared to NL cells. At higher [Ca2+]o (3.5 mM), there was no significant difference in [Ca2+]i and beating rate between NL and SL cells. Treatment with norepinephrine (NE; 0.01-1 microM) at 1 mM [Ca2+]o substantially increased [Ca2+]i in both NL and SL cells. In the former, the NE effect was completely inhibited by beta-blockade (1 microM propranolol). In contrast, in SL cells, NE remained effective after beta-blockade, and combined alpha-blockade (1 microM prazosin) and beta-blockade was needed to inhibit completely the NE effect. In both NL and SL cells, treatment with NE substantially increased beating rates in a similar manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ca2+ handling and adrenergic regulation of the heart cells are significantly altered in the SL embryos, and that these alterations may be related to the development of impaired cardiovascular functions resulting from systemic Ca2+ deficiency.", 
    "2": "Thyroxine has been shown in vitro to stimulate erythropoiesis by two mechanisms: a direct, beta 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of red cell precursors, and an indirect, erythropoietin-mediated mechanism. Clinical reports have suggested that excess thyroxine also exerts depressive effects on thrombocytopoiesis, but the most sensitive methods of assessing platelet production, i.e., percentage of 35S incorporation into platelets and determination of megakaryocyte size and number, are not appropriate for analysis of platelet production in human patients. The purpose of this study was to use a mouse model to investigate the effects of the hyperthyroid state on erythropoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis, and to assess in vivo the two mechanisms by which thyroxine has been described to stimulate erythropoiesis in vitro. We found that thyroxine administration significantly depressed platelet production and stimulated erythropoiesis in mice. Both the D- and L-isomers of thyroxine in appropriate doses produced this depression of thrombocytopoiesis, and the effect was dose dependent for both isomers. Daily administration of thyroxine:increased blood volume; decreased the peripheral platelet count, total circulating platelet count and mass, percentage of 35S incorporation into platelets, and megakaryocyte number and size; and concurrently increased indices of red cell production (packed cell volume, red blood cell count, total circulating red blood cell count and mass, and reticulocyte count). Additionally, propranolol, a nonspecific beta-blocker, partially reversed the suppression of platelet production by L-thyroxine, lending credence to the assertion that the direct, beta 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of the erythroid cell line by thyroxine reported to exist in vitro may also be important in vivo.", 
    "3": "Purified preparations of the inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) contain alpha and beta subunits, which share homologous primary structures and a common transmembrane topology with other members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. Here, a beta subunit-specific antiserum was shown to precipitate the [3H]strychnine binding sites localized on alpha subunits from membrane extracts of both rat spinal cord and mammalian cells co-transfected with alpha and beta cDNAs. Further, inhibition of alpha homo-oligomeric GlyRs by picrotoxinin, a non-competitive blocker of ion flow, was reduced 50- to 200-fold for alpha/beta hetero-oligomeric receptors generated by cotransfection. Site-directed mutagenesis identified residues within the second predicted transmembrane segment (M2) of the beta subunit as major determinants of picrotoxinin resistance. These data implicate the M2 segment in blocker binding to and lining of the GlyR chloride channel.", 
    "4": "The molecular basis of myocardial adaptation to ischemia and reperfusion is poorly understood. It is thought that nuclear proto-oncogenes act as third messengers, converting cytoplasmic signal transduction into long-term changes of gene expression. We studied the expression of six nuclear proto-oncogenes (Egr-1, c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, and c-myc) in myocardium subjected to ischemia and reperfusion in anesthetized pigs. Stunning was achieved by two 10-minute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusions separated by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Hearts were excised after the first occlusion, after the first reperfusion, and at 30, 120, 150, and 210 minutes of reperfusion after the second occlusion. Total RNA was prepared from stunned as well as normally perfused myocardial tissue and subjected to Northern blotting. The response of the six nuclear proto-oncogenes varied.fosB gene expression was never detected. The c-myc gene was expressed, but its level was unchanged by ischemia. c-jun expression was slightly increased by ischemia (3.1 +/- 0.6-fold). The c-fos, Egr-1, and junB genes were highly induced, being fivefold to sevenfold higher in experimental than in control tissue. In three animals pretreated with the beta 1-antagonist metoprolol and then subjected to the above experimental protocol, the induction of proto-oncogenes was similar to that in nonblocked controls. Our results show that the myocardial adaptive response to ischemic stress includes the induction of at least four transcription factors that may be further operative in repair processes and angiogenesis.", 
    "5": "Previous studies have shown that activation of the 5-HT1A receptor subtype enhances rat plasma ACTH concentration. Such receptors have been suggested to be located on CRH neuronal cell bodies in the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus (PVN). In this report, microinjection of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a selective 5-HT1A agonist, into the PVN increased rat plasma ACTH concentration in a dose-related manner. Similar responses were observed when two other 5-HT1A agonists, busipirone and gepirone, were used. (+/-)-Pindolol, known to have 5-HT1A antagonist properties, blocked the effect induced by an optimal dose of 8-OH-DPAT after injection into the PVN. This same dose of 8-OH-DPAT also induced a decrease of hypothalamic CRH concentration, which was completely antagonized as well by pretreatment injection of (+/-)-pindolol into the PVN. A significant inverse correlation was found between hypothalamic CRH and plasma ACTH levels. These results confirm that elevation of the plasma ACTH concentration induced by 5-HT1A receptor subtype activation is mediated by the release of CRH from the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus in rats, but do not exclude other mechanisms.", 
    "6": "Atrial fibrillation is a daily cardiological problem which poses three types of questions, which, though old, are only partially mastered: anticoagulation, reduction and prevention of recurrence. It is a potent source of embolism. The risk is the greatest in patients with rheumatic valvular disease when the fibrillation is recent and when underlying cardiac disease is uncompensated. Long term anticoagulation is mandatory when the cause is rheumatic heart disease. In other pathologies, though anticoagulation has not been shown to reduce mortality, it significantly reduces the number of cerebrovascular accidents, including in the elderly and with low-dose vitamin K antagonist drugs. The efficacy of anticoagulation in preventing arterial embolism has not been established. Reduction of atrial fibrillation is not essential if the arrhythmia is well tolerated, chronic, especially in elderly patients and when several recurrences have occurred despite preventive therapy. In other cases, medical reduction is to be preferred to cardioversion if the fibrillation is recent and well tolerated. Of the oral and injectable preparations, amiodarone seems to be the drug with best benefit/risk ratio. Prevention of recurrence of fibrillation is unnecessary for many after a first episode, especially when idiopathic. In other cases, there are many available drugs but results are uncertain except in those observed in atrial fibrillation related to the autonomic nervous system. Strictly controlled and statistically exploitable studies show comparable efficacy of quinine and other Class I drugs. Beta-blockers are not very useful and the excellent long term results with amiodarone require confirmation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "There is increasing evidence for the existence of a third atypical beta-adrenergic receptor (beta 3-adrenoceptor) in various tissues including adipocytes, cardiac myocytes and intestinal smooth muscle preparations. In the present study, to determine whether beta 3-adrenoceptors also exist in the airway smooth muscle, we studied isolated bronchial segments from dogs under isometric conditions in vitro. Application of beta-adrenoceptor agonists produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of tissues precontracted with 10(-5) M acetylcholine, the order of potency being isoproterenol (1) > or = salbutamol, a beta 2-selective adrenoceptor agonist (0.95) > or = BRL 37344, a beta 3-selective adrenoceptor agonist, (0.83) > norepinephrine (0.10). Under the condition in which alpha- and beta 1-adrenoceptors had been blocked by phentolamine and ICI 89406, respectively, the relaxant response to salbutamol was competitively antagonized by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551, and the pA2 value was 7.01 +/- 0.25 (mean +/- SE), whereas the response to BRL 37344 was resistant, with of apparent pA2 value of 5.66. However, cyanopindolol, an antagonist atypical beta-adrenoceptors, antagonized BRL 37344-induced relaxation in a competitive fashion with a pA2 of 6.74 +/- 0.11. This pA2 value was lower than that when salbutamol was used as an agonist (p < 0.05). These results indicate that beta 3-adrenoceptors probably exist in canine bronchial smooth muscle, and that stimulation of this type of receptors produces potent bronchodilation. Therefore, a specific agonist for beta 3-adrenoceptors could be valuable in the treatment of asthma.", 
    "8": "Alterations in the physiological balance to maintain the pulmonary circulation at a normal low pressure level result in an elevation in pulmonary vascular tone. Pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses were analyzed under some experimental conditions, which included microembolism, administration of vasoactive agents, hypoxia, and monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. It is widely accepted that these responses are highly localized and complex. In the present study, excised canine lung lobes, rat lungs, and pulmonary arterial rings from the rat were employed according to the particular experimental design. The mechanism of the initial rapid elevation followed by a gradual decline in perfusion pressure in microembolism was considered to be related not only to the size of the emboli, but to the degree of mechanical injury of the endothelium. The main sites of constriction of the pulmonary vasculature by several drugs were determined in the pulsatile perfused canine lung lobes, according to the degree of decrease in inflow wave amplitude during antegrade or retrograde perfusion. Further, by applying the same method it was confirmed that the site of hypoxic vasoconstriction is located in the peripheral pulmonary vascular bed between the muscular arteries and veins, which are constricted mainly by serotonin and histamine, respectively. A cross perfusion system was set up, employing two lobes from the same dog, in which normoxic blood was perfused into the hypoxic ventilated lobe and vice versa. As a result, the pulmonary vessels showed a response to ventilation hypoxia that was far more sensitive than that to perfusion hypoxia. The effects of a beta-agonist (isoproterenol) and beta-antagonists (propranolol, pindolol) on hypoxic vasoconstriction were observed. Although pindolol (a vasodilatory beta-blocker) abolished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which was similar to the effect of isoproterenol, the mechanism of action of pindolol was suggested to be different from that of isoproterenol. The importance of the K+ channel of vascular smooth muscle and also the endothelium in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction were stressed. In isolated pulmonary artery segments of the monocrotaline-treated rat, the augmentation of sensitivity of the vascular smooth muscle to Ca2+ preceded the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension. Similarly, hyperreactivity to KCl and serotonin was also observed. It was clarified that the hyperreactivity induced by monocrotaline is modified by endothelium-dependent relaxation. Extensive cellular and molecular biological investigations are essential for further progress in this field.", 
    "9": "Variceal bleeding is the most important complication of portal hypertension. Mortality due to the first variceal bleeding is very high (50%) and of those surviving a variceal bleeding episode, up to 80% may rebleed. Proper management of the acute variceal bleeding episode, the prevention of rebleeding and primary prophylaxis for variceal haemorrhage are therefore mandatory in order to improve the morbidity and mortality of cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding. Injection sclerotherapy would be the treatment of choice for acute variceal bleeding. Drug treatment in the form of either a combined vasopressin-nitroglycerin regimen or somatostatin may be used as an alternative. Patients not responding to these treatments should be referred for surgery. For the prevention of variceal rebleeding, non-selective beta-blockers should be tried first, reserving long-term injection sclerotherapy for patients with contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers or in whom beta-blocker therapy has failed. Surgical rescue in the form of either shunt surgery or lever transplantation should be considered if either treatment fails. A new technique, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPSS) may replace shunt surgery in the future. Beta-blockers is the treatment of choice for primary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage and has a role in preventing acute and chronic bleeding from congestive gastropathy. However, the above sequential approach from the least invasive to the more invasive therapeutic options may not be appropriate for all cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding.", 
    "10": "The release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the median eminence (ME) in cyclic rats was stimulated to a significant extent by the selective muscarinic antagonists 11[(2)(diethylamino)methyl][-1-piperidinyl]-acetyl-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX-116) and methoctramine, and to a lesser extent also by other ligands selectively antagonistic to m1 and m3 receptors. Such stimulation was estrous-cycle-dependent and was not achieved by muscarinic agonists. We suggest that the effect is induced via the m4 receptor subtype. Attempts to block the muscarinic-antagonist-induced stimulation of GnRH release with a variety of drugs were successful only in the presence of prazosin, an antagonist to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. One possible explanation for this muscarinically mediated stimulation of GnRH release is that it results from cross-talk between the muscarinic and the alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, i.e., muscarinic agonists might inhibit the release induced by alpha 1-agonists, and muscarinic antagonists, by cancelling this inhibitory effect, might thus allow the endogenous alpha 1-agent, norepinephrine, to induce the release of GnRH.", 
    "11": "The therapeutic approach to cardiac arrhythmias is constantly evolving due to our improved understanding of their mechanisms and clinico-prognostic implications, even if uncertainties and controversies continue to be a marked feature of this sector, perhaps more than in any other field of medicine. The frequent finding of cardiac arrhythmias in the healthy and cardiopathic population justifies the importance which the question of the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac rhythm disorders has now assumed, even if, as far as the latter is concerned, the aggressive approach has been considerably modified over the past years. This has occurred in view of the still unproven value of indiscriminate anti-arrhythmic treatment for the purposes of prolonging life. This treatment has only been demonstrated to be of value in a few studies in selected subgroups of high-risk patients. In addition, it should be underlined that it has been reported that anti-arrhythmic drugs may possible aggravate or induce new arrhythmia. This potential pro-arrhythmic effect has become increasingly recurrent due to the widespread use and diffusion of this category of drugs. Such considerations should therefore encourage greater caution in the use of these drugs. Cardiac arrhythmias may be benign or life-threatening, symptomatic or asymptomatic; they may be a warning sign of sudden death, or be the cause or effect of heart failure, be the expression of an acute or chronic heart disease, or the clinical manifestation, at a cardiac level, of an extracardiac pathology. Within this broad-ranging clinical context, arrhythmia often gives rise to therapeutic dilemmas which must be resolved with extreme rationality, taking into account the results of all available clinical trials. The results of the Cardiac Arrhythmias Suppression Trial (CAST) showed that clinical judgements of therapeutic efficacy, made in the absence of carefully controlled studies, are often incorrect. On the basis of these findings beta-blocking drugs may find increasing use, since while they are not anti-arrhythmic drugs in the strict sense of the term, they are safer due to their negligible pro-arrhythmic effect, the lower incidence of collateral effects and their proven efficacy in post-infarction. The role of beta-blockers in the treatment of manifest heart failure should not be over-looked, since by countering the deleterious effect of increased catecholamines they may improve the prognosis, thus reducing the incidence of sudden death.", 
    "12": "C6 rat glioma cells were utilized as a model system to probe the 'serotonin/norepinephrine link' at the level of preproenkephalin (PPE) gene expression. The beta adrenoceptor mediated increase in PPE mRNA was attenuated by the selective beta 1 adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol which blocked the isoproterenol induced cyclic AMP generation by 97%. The subtype nonspecific antagonist propranolol blocked both the isoproterenol induced increase in cyclic AMP and the increase in the PPE mRNA steady-state levels. Serotonin (5-HT) had no effect on the density of beta adrenoceptors or their down-regulation by isoproterenol and did not alter the PPE gene expression in the absence of the beta signal. However, 5-HT significantly deamplified the beta signal mediated enhancement of the PPE mRNA thus indicating that the aminergic link occurs beyond the beta adrenoceptor.",

    "14": "Virtually all levels and elements of the sympathetic nervous system can be modulated by drugs in such a manner that elevated blood pressure is lowered, for instance with the use of central alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (clonidine, alpha-methyldopa), ganglioplegic drugs, peripheral adrenergic neurone blockers, and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The beta-blockers have been maintained as a very major group of antihypertensive therapeutics. Among alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, only the selective alpha 1-blockers are useful as antihypertensive drugs, although some interest has developed in newer alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists which are selective for postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors.",

Inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase will cause an accumulation of endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide, and hence lower blood pressure by counteracting several effects of the renin-angiotensin-system.

    "19": "Thromboxane B2 (TXB2) formation in isolated, thrombin-stimulated rat platelets was time dependent and appeared after 5 s of incubation. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking (BAB) drugs inhibited thrombin-stimulated TXB2 formation in the following rank order of potency: metipranolol approximately alprenolol approximately propranolol > oxprenolol > practolol. Atenolol was ineffective in inhibiting TXB2 production in stimulated platelets. The inhibition of thrombin-stimulated TXB2 formation by BAB drugs correlated with their inhibitory effect on thrombin-stimulated platelet aggregation, arachidonic acid liberation from membrane phospholipids and with their membrane fluidization. The higher was the liposolubility of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs investigated, the higher was their inhibition of stimulated TXB2 formation. Hydrophilic, selective atenolol and practolol revealed slight or no inhibitory effect on stimulated thromboxane production.",

    "21": "The present study was undertaken to determine whether befunolol (BFE 60, CAS 39543-79-8) a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, improves post-hypoxic contractile and metabolic recovery of perfused hearts. Isolated rat hearts were perfused for 20 min under hypoxic conditions, followed by 45-min reoxygenation. Hypoxia/reoxygenation induced less than 5% post-hypoxic recovery of cardiac contractile force, incomplete return of resting tension of hearts, accumulation of tissue calcium, and release of purine nucleosides and bases, and creatine kinase from the heart. When hypoxic hearts were treated with 500 mumol/l befunolol from 0 to 10 min of hypoxic perfusion, marked recovery of contractile force (more than 50% of the pre-hypoxic value), complete suppression of the tissue calcium accumulation and significant suppression of the increase in creatine kinase activity of the perfusate were seen after reoxygenation. This treatment also significantly prevented the release of purine nucleosides and bases during hypoxia. These results suggest that treatment with befunolol during hypoxic perfusion is beneficial for post-hypoxic recovery of cardiac function and myocardial metabolism, probably through a mechanism of suppression of transmembrane flux of substrates, ions and enzymes. Cardiac contractile force upon the onset of hypoxia declined more rapidly and myocardial high-energy phosphate content after 10 min of hypoxia was significantly higher in befunolol-treated hearts than in hearts without treatment. Thus, energy-sparing effects may also contribute to the beneficial post-hypoxic recovery of cardiac function and metabolism.", 
    "22": "The records of 214 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admitted to Soroka Medical Center in 1989 were reviewed to assess the quality of medical treatment after AMI. Medical treatment was reviewed with respect to administration, indications, and contraindications of specific drugs. Sixty-nine percent of patients received suboptimal treatment with respect to aspirin and beta blockers, which was almost always due to undertreatment rather than overprescription. Only 23% of patients with mural thrombi, as shown by echocardiography and without contraindications to anticoagulants, received coumadin. Patients hospitalized in the Intensive Coronary Care Unit received somewhat better medical care with regard to aspirin, beta blockers and coumadin. Appropriate decisions whether to give or withhold thrombolytic therapy were made in 81% of the cases and it was given to 29% of the patients. We conclude that during the period of this study there was a considerable gap between: a) recommendations in the medical literature, and b) the quality of care provided to AMI patients with regard to medications prescribed by physicians for preventive medical therapy.", 
    "23": "Certain drugs have been reported to precipitate or to exacerbate psoriasis. These cases occur mostly in patients with a history of psoriasis, although occasionally the new onset of psoriasis has followed treatment with certain drugs. The suspect drugs include lithium, beta adrenergic antagonists, antimalarials, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in addition to various miscellaneous agents, including tetracycline. Evidence for these reports must be critically examined based on clinical and histological data, time course between drug intake and psoriasis exacerbation or resistance to psoriasis therapy, and response to drug rechallenge when available. The clinical context must be taken into consideration, including effects of concomitant antipsoriatic therapy, and the possible role of other triggering factors, such as infection. Controlled, prospective studies of the use of NSAID in patients with psoriasis may help to clarify their varied cutaneous effects. Further knowledge of the mechanisms involved in drug exacerbation of psoriasis may help to elucidate the etiopathogenesis of this chronic skin disorder.", 
    "24": "We recently showed that acute administration of nicotine in the rat decreases bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation and that adrenal medullary-derived epinephrine, acting at a beta 2-adrenergic receptor, mediates the nicotine effect. Since agents which decrease bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation have been associated with increased joint injury in a rat model of chronic inflammation (experimental arthritis induced by subcutaneous injection of Mycobacterium butyricum) we examined the effect of chronic nicotine on both plasma extravasation and the severity of joint injury. In normal rats, bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation was decreased after nicotine administered both by repeated injection (10(-2) mg/kg, s.c., once per h for 4 h) and by continuous long-term infusion (subcutaneous mini-osmotic pump; 1.5 x 10(-3) mg/kg per h for 30 days). Nicotine-induced inhibition of bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation did not show tachyphylaxis. In rats with arthritis, chronic administration of nicotine also produced a decrease in bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation. This effect of chronic nicotine in the arthritic rats was antagonized by co-administration of hexamethonium (a nicotinic receptor antagonist), by surgical removal of the adrenal medulla, or by co-administration of ICI-118,551 (a beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist). Chronic administration of nicotine decreased the latency to the onset of arthritis and, in a dose-dependent manner, led to an increase in the radiographic joint injury score.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Changes in ligand binding to adrenoceptors ([3H]prazosin to alpha 1-receptors, [3H]idazoxan to alpha 2-receptors and [125I]cyanopindolol to beta-receptors) following transient cerebral ischemia were investigated using autoradiographic methods. The binding was quantified in brain sections from control rats, rats subjected to 15 min of 2-vessel occlusion ischemia, and rats with recirculation times of 1 h, 1 week or 4 weeks after ischemia. No significant change in alpha 1-receptor binding was observed during and immediately following ischemia, but a decrease was noted in the vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region following 1 week's survival. In the parietal cortex, the ligand binding to alpha 1-receptors increased at 4 weeks. A reduced [3H]idazoxan binding was observed 1 h after ischemia in the temporal cortex and amygdala. No change in ligand binding to beta-receptors was seen in the early phase postischemia, but a marked increase had occurred in the hippocampal CA1 region at 1 and 4 weeks after ischemia (+163% and +142%, respectively), presumably due to accumulation of macrophages expressing beta-receptors. The early postischemic changes in receptor binding may represent downregulation of the adrenoceptors by processes activated during ischemia, while neuronal degeneration, compensatory mechanisms in surviving neurons and proliferation of non-neuronal cells may account for the subsequent changes.", 
    "26": "The ultimate aim in treating hypertension is to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, especially from coronary heart disease and strokes. In several long-term trials this goal has been achieved with antihypertensive therapy in the form of diuretics. Subsequently, diuretics and betablockers, compared as single agents or with the addition of other agents, did not appear to affect overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality differentially. Therefore, recommended first-line therapy for hypertension was initially diuretics, followed later by beta blockers as alternatives. Recently, calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors have been accepted as equally valuable in the treatment of hypertension because they similarly lower blood pressure, lack any adverse metabolic effects and may be more beneficial than diuretics or beta-blockers on the long-term prognosis of hypertensive patients. Such recommendations are, however, highly speculative and are not supported by trials using cardiovascular mortality and morbidity as endpoints. In order to solve the conflict between proven facts and sound theory, long-term trials comparing older (mainly diuretics) and newer (calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, alpha-adrenoceptor blockers) antihypertensive agents are needed. Until such trials are completed, the debate surrounding first-line drugs for antihypertensive treatment will not be resolved.", 
    "27": "Metipranolol is a beta-blocker that has been used in ophthalmology and in systemic therapy for about 10 years. Reports about reversible uveitis under the product Glauline (metipranolol-containing eye drops) in England were the reason for extensive studies with metipranolol-containing eye drops produced with different methods. Analytical studies concerning the influence of irradiation sterilization on the drug containers, studies on the toxicity of the ophthalmic drug on tissue cultures, and prospective and retrospective clinical studies on 2,800 glaucoma patients were performed. Irradiation sterilization leads to the formation of free radicals on the surface of the containers and, depending on the radiation dose, to a decrease in the pH of the drug solution. In prospective studies involving 1,516 glaucoma patients, no intraocular side effects due to metipranolol-containing eye drops were found. In the retrospective examination including 1,306 glaucoma patients, 19 cases of uveitis were found. Thirteen cases of recurring iritis were diagnosed, which had already been observed before the onset of glaucoma therapy. In 2 cases the iritis led to secondary glaucoma and was treated with metipranolol. In 2 cases glaucoma was treated with pilocarpine (and dipivefrin) and metipranolol concomitantly. One case of rubeosis iridis was incorrectly classified as iritis. One case is possibly related to metipranolol despite the assessment to the contrary by the ophthalmologist in question. Following the results of these studies, an accumulation of cases of uveitis caused by metipranolol can be excluded.", 
    "28": "The aim of the study was to determine whether the antagonism with pindolol, mepindolol and bopindolol at the beta 1-adrenoceptor of the rat left atria, a tissue with plenty of spare beta 1-adrenoceptors for isoprenaline maximum responses, was readily reversible or not. The effects of these drugs were compared to those of metoprolol, a readily reversible, and of ICI 147,798, an irreversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. Metoprolol at 10(-7) and 10(-6) M, ICI 147,798, pindolol, bopindolol (all at 10(-8) and 10(-7) M) and mepindolol at 10(-9) and 10(-8) M inhibited the cardiac stimulation responses to a small extent, which is indicative of membrane stabilizing activity, and also caused surmountable antagonism of isoprenaline responses. The inhibitory effects on the isoprenaline responses of metoprolol and pindolol were readily reversible, that of mepindolol was slowly reversible and those of ICI 147,798 and bopindolol were not reversed in 3 h. The inhibitory effects on isoprenaline responses of metoprolol at 10(-6) M, pindolol and bopindolol at 10(-7) M and mepindolol at 10(-8) M were at equilibrium, which is indicative of reversible, whereas the inhibitory effects of ICI 147,798 were increased, which is indicative of irreversible antagonism, when the beta-blocker treatment time was increased from 1 to 2 h. We conclude that the antagonism with pindolol at the beta 1-adrenoceptors of the rat left atria is readily reversible, that of mepindolol is slowly reversible and that of bopindolol is very slowly reversible.", 
    "29": "To determine whether the age-associated decline in resting left ventricular diastolic filling persists during aerobic exercise, rest and bicycle exercise filling indexes were measured from gated radionuclide blood pool scans in 88 healthy men aged 22-82 yr. To evaluate the effect of physical conditioning status on these age-related changes, a subset of the subjects consisted of endurance-trained senior athletes with a maximal O2 consumption of 50.5 +/- 5 compared with 32.6 +/- 7 ml.kg-1 x min-1 in age-matched controls. The contribution of beta-adrenergic stimulation to exercise-induced changes in filling was also evaluated by the administration of intravenous propranolol to another subset before testing. Peak filling rate increased progressively at all ages with increasing exercise work loads. The peak filling rates at rest, 50% maximal exercise, and maximum exercise inversely correlated with age (r = -0.64, -0.53, -0.64, respectively). Rest and exercise filling indexes in senior athletes were similar to those of sedentary older subjects. Propranolol decreased exercise peak filling rates in young (37.2 +/- 7.5 yr) but not in older (62.1 +/- 6 yr) subjects. Therefore, filling rates increase with exercise in both young and older healthy men, but age differences persist at comparable relative work loads. This decline is not secondary to a decline in physical conditioning status but appears to be related to a decrease in beta-adrenergic responsiveness in older individuals.", 
    "30": "We studied how changes in afterload affect regional contraction in the anterior wall of the left ventricular after circumflex coronary arterial (CFX) occlusion and subsequent beta-adrenergic blockade in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized cats. Regional function was determined by orthogonal sonomicrometry. CFX occlusion produced nonuniform hyperkinesis in the nonischemic anterior wall; shortening of circumferential segments increased from 10.1 to 14.1% (P < 0.001), whereas shortening of longitudinal segments increased from 3.0 to 9.6% (P < 0.001). Hyperkinesis of longitudinal segments was influenced neither by changes in afterload over a pressure range of +/- 30 mmHg nor by beta-adrenergic blockade, indicating that hyperkinesis of longitudinal segments does not rely on increased inotropic state or resistance to ventricular emptying. Hyperkinesis of longitudinal segments occurred at end-diastolic lengths equal to preocclusion conditions, whereas hyperkinesis of circumferential segments was dependent on activation of the Frank-Starling mechanism. Furthermore, shortening of circumferential segments decreased with increments in afterload, particularly after CFX occlusion and subsequent beta-adrenergic blockade. In conclusion, CFX occlusion alters the contraction pattern of the nonischemic anterior wall. The postocclusion contraction is sensitive to increased afterload in the cardiac minor axis direction. These initial alterations may well direct the following remodeling process in infarcted hearts.", 
    "31": "Acute respiratory failure in pregnancy is an important cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Causes include: ARDS, venous air embolism, beta-adrenergic tocolytic therapy, asthma, thromboembolic disease, pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum. The most common predisposing diseases for ARDS complicating pregnancy are sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, and amniotic fluid embolism. Knowledge of normal maternal-fetal physiology and determinants of fetal oxygen delivery (uterine blood flow, placental transfer, fetal circulation) can help sustain normal fetal development, usually without compromising maternal care. The increased microvascular permeability seen in ARDS is likely mediated by neutrophils, proinflammatory mediators (e.g., tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, arachidonic acid metabolites) and activation of the complement cascade. Treatment of respiratory failure in pregnancy is largely supportive, including mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support, nutrition, and prophylaxis against thromboembolism. No specific therapy has as yet been proven effective for ARDS, other than treating the underlying cause. Respiratory failure from status asthmaticus is treated with vigorous bronchodilator therapy, high-dose glucocorticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and careful ventilator management. Occasionally, more experimental therapies (e.g., isoproterenol infusion, halothane anesthesia) are indicated. Certain strategies can help prevent respiratory failure from aspiration of gastric contents, beta-adrenergic tocolytic therapy, and thromboembolic disease.", 
    "32": "Studies investigating mechanisms of mucociliary clearance have suggested that beta 2-adrenergic agents may significantly influence ciliary activity of epithelial cells and therefore play a vital role in the maintenance of functional integrity of the airways. We have cultured human bronchial epithelial cells, from surgical explants and investigated the effects of salbutamol and salmeterol, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, on the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of these cells. Prior to and at several times after exposure to either salbutamol (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) or salmeterol (10(-8) to 10(-4) M), the epithelial cells were monitored for CBF and on the basis of data obtained from these studies, the effect of 10(-6) M propranolol was investigated in the presence of optimal concentrations of salbutamol and salmeterol. Salbutamol was optimally active at a concentration of 10(-4) M and caused a transient but significant increase in the CBF from baseline level of 8.6 +/- 0.4 to 9.6 +/- 0.5 Hz (P < 0.05), after 2 h incubation. In contrast, salmeterol was maximally active at a concentration of 10(-6) M and caused a significantly rapid and prolonged increase in CBF from a baseline value of 9.2 +/- 0.4 to 10.9 +/- 0.6 Hz (P < 0.02) and 10.6 +/- 0.8 Hz (P < 0.05) after 15 min and 24 h incubation, respectively. Propranolol (10(-6) M) abrogated the salbutamol- but not the salmeterol-induced increases in CBF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "Positron emission tomography is a non-invasive radionuclide imaging technique which enables in vivo assessment of regional cardiac function. When used with appropriate radiotracers and kinetic models, it can provide quantitative measurements of myocardial perfusion, metabolism and pharmacology. The development of quantitative measurements should help to decrease much of the ambiguity in the interpretation of data that often occurs. The short half-life of the radionuclides used allows the imaging of more than one function to be performed conveniently within the same scanning session with a low radiation dose to the subject. This integrated approach provides a means for investigating in vivo the physiology and pathophysiology of the human heart.", 
    "34": "The present experiments were performed to investigate the potential role of central adrenergic neurons in regulating occurrence of yawning in rats. Intraperitoneal injection of tacrine (THA) or 9-amino-2,3,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-1H-cyclopenta(b)-quinoline monohydrate HCl (NIK-247), cholinesterase inhibitors, induced yawning, which was markedly increased by pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, pindolol. The yawning evoked by tacrine or NIK-247 given alone or in combination with pindolol was inhibited by pretreatment with scopolamine but not by mecamylamine or spiperone. Treatment with tacrine or NIK-247 increased acetylcholine content of the striatum, but this effect was not enhanced by pindolol, which per se did not affect basal acetylcholine content. Moreover, pretreatment with the central adrenaline synthesis inhibitors, (+-)-2,3-dichloro-alpha-methylbenzylamine HCl (LY-78335) and 2-cyclooctyl-2-hydroxyethylamine HCl (UK-1187A), increased tacrine-induced yawning. Subcutaneous injection of talipexole (B-HT 920), a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, evoked yawning, which was also increased by pindolol, LY-78335, and UK-1187A. These receptors antagonists and synthesis inhibitors per se did not cause yawning responses. The results suggest that the beta-adrenoceptor blockade and the inhibition of adrenaline synthesis facilitate the occurrence of yawning induced by cholinergic and dopaminergic agonists, and thus the central adrenergic neuronal systems may be implicated in the regulation of yawning responses.", 
    "35": "Administration of a single dose of angiotensin II (AII) has been shown to induce a state of hyperhydration in rats that can last from 6-10 h depending upon the route of administration and the dose. The objective of the present study was to determine whether another dipsogenic agent, isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, could also induce a state of hyperhydration. The results indicate that a single SC dose of ISO can induce a hyperhydration that lasts from 4-6 h depending upon the dose administered. Administration of graded doses of either AII or ISO induced graded increases both in the time of hyperhydration and change in accumulative mean fluid exchange, (delta FE, fluid exchange of treated less fluid exchange of control). These two parameters were related linearly and directly for each drug, although the slopes, but not the intercepts, of the relationship for each drug differed significantly. Because the objective of optimal hyperhydration should be to achieve the longest duration of positive fluid balance with the least amount of ingested fluid (i.e., delta FE), the slopes of the two lines provide a convenient way to compare the hyperhydration induced by AII and ISO. By this criterion, it would appear that AII provides a more optimal hyperhydration than ISO.", 
    "36": "1. Nebivolol (a new beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking drug) has particular effects on the cardiovascular system, i.e. it induces hypotension without affecting cardiac function or increasing peripheral vascular resistances. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of nebivolol and its stereoisomers on the actions of adrenaline (AD) at the cardiovascular level as well as at the prejunctional level (as ascertained by modification of noradrenaline (NA) and dihydroxyphenylglycol (DOPEG) plasma levels in the anaesthetized dog. 2. AD infusion (0.1 micrograms kg-1 min-1) did not induce statistically significant changes in mean blood pressure and heart rate; it caused a pronounced and sustained rise of AD levels, no significant alterations in NA levels and a marked, progressive and sustained increase in DOPEG levels. 3. Mean blood pressure was not affected by any of the nebivolol isomers. d- and dl-nebivolol in the two doses used (0.3 and 0.03 mg kg-1 in 15 min) caused a significant and dose-dependent decrease in heart rate. Plasma levels of AD and NA were not changed by any of the nebivolol isomers tested. However, all of them significantly reduced the increase in plasma levels of DOPEG induced by adrenaline infusion. 4. We conclude (1) that AD infusion in the dog facilitates NA release and that DOPEG is a good index of this effect; and (2) nebivolol appears to act at the prejunctional level, reducing the increase in NA release induced by adrenaline, as shown by the effect on DOPEG plasma levels.", 
    "37": "The presence of a beta-3 adrenoceptor (in addition to the classical beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors) and its involvement in the control of heart rate was investigated in the dog. Experiments were carried out in conscious normal and sinoaortic denervated dogs (i.e. animals deprived of baroreceptor pathways). In normal dogs, infusion of isoproterenol, BRL 37344 (4-[-[(2-hydroxy-(3-chlorophenyl) ethyl)-amino]propyl]phenoxyacetate) (a beta-3 adrenergic agonist) or CGP 12177 (4-[3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy]benzimidazol-2- one) (a beta-1 beta-2 adrenergic antagonist reported to act as an agonist for the beta-3 adrenergic receptor) increased heart rate with an order of potency: BRL 37344 > isoproterenol > CGP 12177. [125I]Cyanopindolol binding (2-2000 pM) was saturable and Scatchard analysis indicated the presence of an homogenous population of binding sites. KD was 12.8 +/- 18.5 pM and maximum binding was 94.2 +/- 12.5 fmol/mg of protein. Competition binding studies on dog heart membranes using 150 pM [125I] cyanopindolol indicated an order of potency (CGP 12177 > isoproterenol > BRL 37344) different from that observed in cardiovascular studies. Isoproterenol stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in heart membranes from normal dogs, whereas CGP 12177 and BRL 37344 were without any stimulating action. The positive chronotropic effects of isoproterenol, BRL 37344 and CGP 12177 were accompanied with a reduction in arterial blood pressure. In sinoaortic denervated animals, isoproterenol infusion provoked tachycardia and hypotension. BRL 37344 and CGP 12177 were without any significant effect on heart rate but induced a rapid and dramatic hypotension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "Differing effects of labetalol and dilevalol on cardiovascular preparations have been reported. I have studied the effects of labetalol and dilevalol on the contractile responses of the rat and guinea-pig left atria and rat portal vein. On the guinea-pig left atria low concentrations of labetalol (> or = 10(-8) M) and of dilevalol (> or = 10(-7) M) inhibited to a small extent the responses to electrical cardiac stimulation, which is indicative of membrane stabilizing activity. Labetalol (> or = 3 x 10(-8) M) and dilevalol (> or = 10(-8) M) caused surmountable antagonism of the isoprenaline responses of the atria and the pA2 values were 8.60 and 8.98 at the beta 1-adrenoceptors of the rat left atria and 7.90 and 8.31, respectively, on the guinea-pig left atria which has functional beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Labetalol and dilevalol (both at > or = 10(-7) M) attenuated the spontaneous contractile activity of the rat portal vein and the attenuation to labetalol at 10(-6) M was abolished by ICI 118,551 which illustrates that the labetalol-induced attenuation is beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated. The isoprenaline attenuation responses of the portal vein were inhibited by labetalol and dilevalol (both at > or = 10(-7) M) and the pA2 value for the labetalol at beta 2-adrenoceptors was 7.59. It is concluded that labetalol and dilevalol are beta 1-adrenoceptor selective antagonists.", 
    "39": "1. We have studied the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on both phasic peristaltic activity and basal tone of the isolated intravesical ureter of the pig by means of isometric techniques in vitro. 2. Spontaneous phasic activity was exhibited by 21% of pig intravesical ureter preparations manifested as rhythmic contractions with average frequency and amplitude of 2.54 +/- 0.18 min-1 and 1.48 +/- 0.16 g (n = 31), respectively. 3. Adrenaline, noradrenaline and phenylephrine induced concentration-dependent increases in both phasic activity and basal tone of ureteral preparations, all three agonists being more potent in modifying ureteral phasic activity than baseline tone. B-HT 920, B-HT 933 and clonidine had no significant effect. 4. Phentolamine (10(-9)-10(-7) M) and prazosin (3 x 10(-11)-3 x 10(-8) M) significantly inhibited increases in both frequency of phasic activity and baseline tone induced by a submaximal dose of noradrenaline. Rauwolscine (10(-9)-10(-7) M) affected only the tone evoked by noradrenaline and higher concentrations of this antagonist were needed to block phasic activity. 5. Pretreatment of ureteral strips with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (10(-6) M), significantly increased the maximum contraction evoked by noradrenaline. After incubation with phentolamine (10(-6) M), noradrenaline (10(-7)-10(-6) M) decreased phasic activity induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha (10(-5) M). Isoprenaline and salbutamol also abolished PGF2 alpha-induced phasic activity. Pafenolol (10(-6) M) and butoxamine (10(-6) M) blocked the inhibitory effect of noradrenaline, isoprenaline, and salbutamol on PGF2 alpha-induced phasic activity. 6. These results suggest that noradrenaline may modulate both phasic peristaltic activity and basal tone of pig intravesical ureter through both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.",

We have investigated the effects of various classes (I-IV) of antiarrhythmic drugs on this KRN2391-induced response. 2. All class I antiarrhythmic drugs (Na+ channel blockers) tested concentration-dependently suppressed KRN2391-induced responses with the rank order of potency (IC50 in microM), disopyramide (17.8) > aprindine (29.5) > propafenone (63.1) > ajmaline (145) > quinidine (151). Flecainide, SUN1165, lignocaine, mexiletine and procainamide were much less potent (IC50, 450- > 1000 microM) than quinidine. 3. The class II antiarrhythmic drugs (beta-blockers), timolol, (-)- and (+/-)- propranolol, and (+)- propranolol (a non-beta-blocker) inhibited KRN2391-induced K+ currents in a concentration-dependent manner with values for IC50 (microM) of 79, 131, 151 and 129, respectively, whilst butoxamine, oxprenolol, alprenolol, pindolol, nadolol, metoprolol and acebutolol were either weak (IC50, 300 microM-600 microM) or virtually inactive (IC50, > 1000 microM). 4. The class III antiarrhythmic drugs, amiodarone and (+)-sotalol scarcely affected KRN2391 responses. 5.

    "41": "1. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were cultured in vitro, and shown to release both prostacyclin (PGI2; Kact = 24.1 nM) and endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF, NO; Kact = 0.7 nM) in a concentration-dependent manner when exposed to bradykinin. 2. The bradykinin-dependent release of PGI2 (but not EDRF) was inhibited by 1 microM isoprenaline or 5 microM forskolin, and the inhibitory effect of isoprenaline could be reversed by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551. In contrast, isoprenaline had no capacity to inhibit PGI2 release stimulated by exogenous arachidonic acid. 3. Exposure of cells to bradykinin increased the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ ions ([Ca2+]i; Kact = 4.8 nM), and the effect was inhibited by both 1 microM isoprenaline and 5 microM forskolin. 4. In similar experiments, exposure of cells to ionomycin also increased [Ca2+]i and the values of [Ca2+]i were calibrated in terms of the ionomycin concentration. In subsequent experiments involving exposure of endothelial cells to selected concentrations of ionomycin, it was possible to show that the biosynthesis of NO was triggered at ionomycin concentrations about one tenth of the required for PGI2 biosynthesis and that these corresponded to a [Ca2+]i threshold of 350 nM for PGI2 release while that for EDRF release was less than 200 nM. 5. These differences in Ca2+ ion sensitivity explain the selective inhibition of bradykinin-stimulated PGI2 biosynthesis (to the exclusion of NO biosynthesis) by isoprenaline or forskolin, both of which attenuate bradykinin-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i.", 
    "42": "The oxidative modification of LDL in vivo may have an important role in atherogenesis. To determine whether LDL fatty acid, anti-oxidant composition and sensitivity to oxidation in vitro is different in subjects with established atherosclerosis we compared 20 men with angiogram proven coronary disease with 25 controls without clinical evidence of arterial disease. LDL-cholesterol, total triglycerides and LDL fatty acid composition did not differ significantly between the groups. LDL oxidation lag time and oxidation rate in coronary patients (132 min, 0.02 absorbance units/min) and controls (140, 0.017) were not significantly different. However coronary disease subjects taking beta-blockers had evidence for reduced LDL oxidizability (lag time 148 +/- 7 min; oxidation rate 0.017 +/- 0.002 abs units/min) compared with those not on beta-blockers (lag time 114 +/- 7 min, rate 0.025 +/- 0.003, P < 0.005). LDL beta-carotene was significantly lower in coronary patients (0.92 mumol/mmol LDL cholesterol; controls 1.58; P = 0.001). LDL alpha-tocopherol appeared lower in coronary patients (2.8 mumol/mmol LDL cholesterol; controls 3.3; P = 0.056) and was significantly lower in smokers (2.56; non-smokers 3.24; P = 0.04).

    "43": "Systolic time intervals and brachial circulation, evaluated by pulsed Doppler in terms of arterial diameter, blood velocity and flow, and vascular resistance, were studied in 12 hyperthyroid patients and in 12 normal controls. In patients, arterial circulation was studied before and during mechanical exclusion of the hand, and hemodynamic measurements were repeated after beta-blocker treatment and after obtainment of euthyroid state. Compared with controls, patients had higher heart rate (P < 0.001), lower systolic time intervals (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), and higher blood velocity (P < 0.05). Beta blockade decreased heart rate (P < 0.05, P < 0.001) but did not change systolic time intervals and arterial circulation. Euthyroid state decreased heart rate (P < 0.01), preejection period (P < 0.01), and blood velocity (P < 0.01) and flow (P < 0.05). The decreases in velocity and flow before hand exclusion when euthyroid state was obtained were correlated with hyperthyroid values of velocity and flow respectively (r = 0.85, r = 0.90, P < 0.01, P < 0.001). Vascular resistance during hand exclusion was correlated negatively with serum T3 level during hyperthyroid and euthyroid states. Thus, thyroid hormones but not beta-adrenoreceptors participate in the peripheral hyperkinesia of hyperthyroidism.",

These data were compared to those found under similar conditions in the brain of rats and guinea pigs, species which are known to possess 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors, respectively. In the presence of 100 nM 8-OH-DPAT and mesulergine, the regional distribution of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine binding sites was very similar in the brain of all species investigated; densest labelling was observed in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra and superior colliculus. In all species, 5-carboxamidotryptamine competed for the labelled sites in a biphasic manner and metergoline displayed a subnanomolar affinity. In contrast, the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (-)propranolol, (-)pindolol, and (+/-)SDZ 21009 were potent displacers only in the rat, hamster and opossum brains.

Aspirin and other anticoagulants are beneficial through their antiplatelet effects. Cardiac rehabilitation methods and aggressive management of lipids levels are also useful.", 
    "50": "The molecular pharmacology of a new putative long-acting bronchodilator TA 2005 (8-hydroxy-5-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2-[N-[(1R)-2-(p-methoxy-phenyl)- 1-methylethyl]amino]ethyl]carbostyril hydrochloride) has been compared with that of the reference compounds isoprenaline and salbutamol in both methacholine (3 x 10(-6) M) precontracted guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle relaxation and in bovine trapezium muscle binding experiments. TA 2005 appeared very potent compared with isoprenaline and salbutamol (pD2 values of 9.29 vs. 7.65 and 7.10 respectively). For isoprenaline and salbutamol a shallow displacement curve was observed and addition of the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) gave a rightward shift (pKd,high and pKd,low values of 7.3 and 6.1 vs. 7.0 and 5.4 respectively). For TA 2005 a steep displacement curve was found with only one binding state even without GppNHp (pKd,high value of 8.2). The long duration of action of TA 2005 might be explained by tight binding of this compound to the beta 2-adrenoceptor. The extent of tight binding for TA 2005 was extremely large. The molecular basis of the tight agonist binding phenomenon for TA 2005 seems to be of different origin than for isoprenaline. It is hypothesized that a different mechanism of activation of the beta 2-adrenoceptor may be involved for TA 2005.", 
    "51": "We previously reported that insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH) induces a large increase in plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels in the developing rat during the stress hyporesponsive period and that this effect is mediated, at least partially, by arginine vasopressin (AVP), but not corticotropin-releasing factor. Nevertheless, ACTH secretion in response to IIH in rats immunoneutralized against AVP was still stimulated, suggesting that other regulatory factors participate in the stimulation of ACTH secretion during IIH. It has been suggested that, in the adult rat, during profound hypoglycemia, epinephrine may act at the pituitary level through beta 2-adrenergic receptors to stimulate ACTH secretion. In this report, we studied the effect of the blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors on the pituitary-adrenal axis response to IIH. Rats (20 or 8 day old) were pretreated with saline or 2.5 mg/kg propranolol (a beta-adrenergic receptors antagonist) and subsequently injected with 3 IU/kg insulin. In 20-day-old rats, insulin injection induced a large increase of plasma ACTH concentrations that were unaffected by propranolol pretreatment. In 8-day-old rats, the IIH-induced increase of plasma ACTH levels was significantly reduced by propranolol pretreatment. Pretreatment of 8-day-old rats with 5 mg/kg CGP 20712A (a selective beta 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist) did not change the plasma ACTH response to insulin injection, while pretreatment with 2.5 mg/kg ICI 118551 (a selective beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) resulted in a significant decrease of the IIH-induced stimulation of ACTH secretion. We next studied the effect of the blockade of circulating AVP and/or beta-adrenergic receptors on the pituitary response to IIH. Pretreatment of 8-day-old rats with antiserum anti-AVP or propranolol was followed by a significant reduction of IIH-induced increase of plasma ACTH concentrations. No additive effect was found after pretreatment with both antiserum anti-AVP and propranolol, suggesting that the stimulatory effect of catecholamines during IIH in 8-day-old rats is mediated through a modulation of hypothalamic AVP secretion.", 
    "52": "The mechanisms of succinylcholine-induced cardiac effects have not been fully elucidated. Accordingly, we studied the effects of succinylcholine on atrial rate and contractile force in the isolated canine atrium perfused with donor blood. The sinus node artery was perfused with heparinized blood from the common carotid artery of the donor dog at a constant pressure of 100 mm Hg. When succinylcholine in a dose range of 30-1000 micrograms was injected directly into the sinus node artery of the isolated atrium, increases in atrial rate and contractile force were observed in a dose-related manner. The atrial rate and contractile force were increased to 10.5% +/- 1.8% (mean +/- SEM) and 56.8% +/- 8.5% above the control values after the administration of 1000 micrograms of succinylcholine, respectively. After treatment with propranolol, the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of succinylcholine and norepinephrine were significantly suppressed. Hexamethonium or tetrodotoxin pretreatment inhibited the cardiac effects of nicotine but did not modify the succinylcholine-induced cardiac effects. The succinylcholine-induced effects were significantly inhibited by treatment with imipramine, which also suppressed the tyramine-induced effects. We conclude that succinylcholine has cardioexcitatory properties mediated by release of catecholamine due to a tyraminelike action.",

This study involved 229 patients enrolled in the Multicenter Diltiazem Post-infarction Trial who died during 2-year follow-up and had quantitative information on the chronology of the terminal event. Thirty-two percent of the cardiac deaths occurred instantaneously. Patients who died instantaneously were more likely (p < 0.05) to be men, to have a baseline ejection fraction < 0.40, and to have frequent (> or = 10/hour) and repetitive (> or = 3 in a row) ventricular ectopic complexes (VECs) on an ambulatory electrocardiogram than those who did not die instantaneously. Patients who died instantaneously received more digitalis and class IA antiarrhythmic agents and less beta blockers in the week before death than those dying noninstantaneously. Logistic regression analysis identified 3 independent factors that differentiated instantaneous from noninstantaneous death (relative risk; 95% confidence interval): frequent VECs (2.15; 1.11 to 4.17); digitalis (2.57; 1.31 to 5.06); and no beta blocker medication (2.90; 1.09 to 7.75). Instantaneous death (within 1 minute) was responsible for almost one third of the cardiac deaths that occurred in this postinfarction population. Frequent VECs, digitalis, and absence of beta-blocker therapy distinguished patients who died instantaneously from those who died noninstantaneously.", 
    "54": "In a randomized double blind study 100 men (mean age 46 (22-64) years) with mild to moderate hypertension were followed every 3rd month for one year. Fifty were randomized to atenolol 50 mg and 50 to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg+amiloride 5 mg (co-amiloride) once daily. The doses were doubled at 3 or 6 months if diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remained > or = 95 mmHg. If DBP was > or = 95 mmHg even at 6 or 9 months, patients were classified as non-responders, and nifedipine 20 mg b.i.d. was added. After one year 31/50 randomized to atenolol and 17/50 randomized to co-amiloride had responded to monotherapy (p < 0.05). Neither clinical findings nor haemodynamic measurements by Doppler at baseline could distinguish between co-amiloride responders and non-responders. Conversely, non-responders to atenolol as compared with atenolol responders had higher body weight (p = 0.02), higher systolic BP (p = 0.03), higher DBP (p = 0.009), stroke volume (p = 0.04), and cardiac output (p = 0.0002) combined with lower total systemic vascular resistance (p = 0.02). This suggests that some were apparent non-responders due to too low dosing of atenolol rather than true non-responders. Measurements of haemodynamics may be of importance in the assessment of optimal antihypertensive therapy according to baseline and follow-up haemodynamic aberrations.", 
    "55": "The importance of sympathetic innervation changed significantly during sexual maturation and in the course of the oestrous cycle in females. Basal secretion of progesterone is partly dependent on constant beta-adrenergic stimulation since local infusion of propranolol (beta-blocker) into the ovary decreased progesterone secretion by 20-30% of pre-treatment value. Noradrenaline given into the abdominal aorta in the moderate doses affected very quickly and dramatically the secretory function of the corpus luteum during the luteal phase in cattle and also in other species. Thus short-lasting mobilization stress protects and even supports corpus luteum function. This effect is exerted through the stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors which then activates specific intracellular enzymes. Additionally noradrenaline acts upon vascular alpha-receptors and increase ovarian blood flow allowing utilization of serum-derived lipoprotein as a source of cholesterol for steroidogenesis. The highest amount of specific beta-receptors in luteal membranes was found in the newly-formed corpus luteum which does appear to require noradrenergic support especially at that stage of its development. The mechanism of noradrenaline influence upon luteal cells resulting concomitant progesterone and ovarian oxytocin secretion is, however, obscure. It is suggested that intracellular second messengers (cAMP, Ca2+) involved in noradrenaline action can simultaneously affect the secretion of both these hormones and this indicates some functional relationship between them. The presented results are focused mainly upon cattle due to the importance of this species among other domestic animals. Nevertheless for comparison data from other species are also quoted.", 
    "56": "The effect of the fixed combination of 0.5% timolol maleate with 2% pilocarpine hydrochloride given twice a day and 0.5% timolol with 4% pilocarpine given twice a day was tested in a long-term, multicenter study. A total of 360 patients with open angle glaucoma were included; they were defined as those who had intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg while receiving single, topical antiglaucoma therapy. Primarily, the purpose of the study was to investigate the efficacy of 0.5% timolol-2% pilocarpine, and second, to see to what extent an increase in concentration to 0.5% timolol-4% pilocarpine would further lower intraocular pressure in those patients with an intraocular pressure of greater than 21 mm Hg while taking 0.5% timolol-2% pilocarpine. The cohort of 228 patients went through the examinations for a total of 48 weeks. A mean decrease in intraocular pressure from 24.7 +/- 2.8 to 21.0 +/- 3.8 mm Hg was observed. During the trial, approximately 33% of the patients required an increase in concentration to 0.5% timolol-4% pilocarpine after the week 8 examination. At week 12, in those using 0.5% timolol-4% pilocarpine, an additional 2.2 mm Hg lowering of intraocular pressure was observed. Side effects were minor and temporary and did not necessitate withdrawal from the study.", 
    "57": "1. It has been reported that catecholamines affect intracellular pH (pHi) in a number of tissues, generally by altering the kinetics of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger. We postulated that catecholamines might affect pHi in cardiac tissue. We tested this in resting sheep cardiac Purkinje fibres by measuring transmembrane potential and pHi with standard and H(+)-sensitive microelectrodes. 2. Adrenaline and the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline, both 5.0 x 10(-6) M, resulted in depolarization and intracellular acidification (adrenaline, 0.03 +/- 0.01 pH units, n = 8, P = 0.005; isoprenaline, 0.08 +/- 0.01 pH units, n = 17, P = 0.0001). The alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, at concentrations up to 200 microM, had no significant effect on membrane potential or pHi. 3. Isoprenaline significantly attenuated the half-time (t0.5) for pHi recovery from intracellular acidification induced via the NH4Cl pulse technique. Isoprenaline also attenuated the hyperpolarization that is normally seen at the onset of pHi recovery. Phenylephrine slightly reduced the t0.5 for recovery, although the reduction did not reach statistical significance. 4. Forskolin, 7.5-10 x 10(-5) M, an agent that raises intracellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), also induced depolarization and acidification, similar to that induced by adrenaline and isoprenaline. 5. In the presence of the Na(+)-H+ exchange blocker 5-dimethyl amiloride, 2-6 x 10(-5) M, isoprenaline-induced acidification was blunted but not abolished. When administered in Na(+)-free Tyrode solution, isoprenaline-induced acidification was also not abolished. Buffering power, tested using the NH4Cl method, was not decreased by isoprenaline, but rather, was slightly increased. Reversal of H+ driving force across the cell membrane from the normally inward direction to outward (achieved by increasing pHo to 8.3-8.5 and depolarizing the membrane with 10 mM K+ solutions) did not prevent intracellular acidification from occurring in the presence of isoprenaline. When glycolysis was inhibited by a 60 min exposure to glucose-free solution containing 5.5 mM 2-deoxyglucose, acidification by isoprenaline was nearly abolished. 6. We conclude that, in resting sheep Purkinje fibres, beta- but not alpha-adrenergic stimulation results in intracellular acidification and depolarization, probably mediated via an increase in cyclic AMP. beta- but not alpha-adrenergic stimulation slows the rate of recovery from intracellular acidification and blunts the hyperpolarization associated with this recovery. 7. The intracellular acidification appears to be due both to partial inhibition of Na(+)-H+ exchange and to stimulation of glycolysis by beta-adrenergic agents.",

    "61": "After 2-months' single-drug therapy, all four active drugs were found to be equally effective in reducing diastolic blood pressure (DBP). However, there were differences in their efficacy in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP); the diuretic was significantly more effective than the beta-receptor blockers. The results of a series of multiple linear regression analyses showed that the observed differences in effect on SBP could not be explained by the different effects of the drugs on heart rate. More than two-thirds of the patients were given supplementary treatment, most of them already by the 2-month visit, after which there was no significant difference in blood pressure among the treatment regimens. The changes in laboratory values and in the prevalence of symptoms were minor for all four regimens.",

There were differences in their efficacy in reducing SBP, the diuretic being more effective than the beta-blockers. After addition of supplementary treatment (beta-blocker to diuretic, or vice versa) there were no significant differences in blood pressure reduction among the groups. The changes in laboratory values and in the prevalence of symptoms were minor for all active treatment regimens. Thus, the satisfactory effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was not impaired by low tolerability of the drugs.", 
    "63": "Two phenylalkylamine Ca2+ channel ligands, (+/-)-[3H]verapamil ((+/-)-[3H]V) (-)-[3H]desmethoxyverapamil ((-)-[3H]DV), were employed in whole cell binding assays to characterize the specific high affinity binding sites on Ca2+ channels, their cooperativity and modulations induced on cultured human embryonal vascular smooth muscle preparation (VSM) by: 1) Beta-adrenergic stimulation of the cell, 2) exposure to high K+ concentration, 3) exposure to high concentration of Mg2+ ions, 4) the presence of a benzothiazepine Ca2+ channel antagonist and modulator d-cis-diltiazem, and 5) guanylylimidodiphosphate. The total amounts of specific (+/-)-[3H]V and (-)-[3H]DV binding sites present on VSM cells increased significantly after beta-adrenergic receptor activation, following cell membrane depolarization induced by high concentrations of K+, in the presence of Ca2+ chelator Na3EDTA, and after incubation of VSM cells with a benzothiazine-type Ca2+ channel blocker d-cis-diltiazem. A marked reduction of (-)-[3H]DV binding was observed after permanent G-protein activation by a nonhydrolyzable analog of guanylylimidodiphosphate, after incubation of the cells with norepinephrine, and after incubation of VSM cells with millimolar concentration of Mg2+. The results suggest the existence of multiple modulations of specific (-)-[3H]DV binding sites on Ca2+ channel corresponding to the way of activation of the cell and also to the immediate \"state\" of the membrane bound Ca2+ channels present on VSM cells, the positive heterotropic interaction after beta-adrenergic stimulation, the homotropic positive allosteric interaction induced by d-cis-diltiazem and pure noncompetitive inhibition induced by guanylylimidodiphosphate. The presence of high concentrations of Mg2+ inhibited whereas the presence of Ca2+ chelator, of ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid sodium salt, significantly increased the total number of specific high affinity (-)-[3H]DV binding sites on VSM cells.", 
    "64": "Several lines of evidence suggest that catecholamines are involved in the regulation of the development of the testis. We have therefore investigated the ability of testicular parenchyma (decapsulated pieces of testes) from 18 to 20-day-old golden hamsters to respond to catecholaminergic stimuli in vitro. Norepinephrine and epinephrine, as well as the beta-receptor agonist isoproterenol and the alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine were able to significantly stimulate testicular testosterone production. Dopamine and serotonin were not effective. The stimulatory action of norepinephrine on testosterone production was dependent on the concentration. In incubations of testes with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and norepinephrine, no synergistic effects on testosterone release were observed. The stimulatory effect of norepinephrine could be partially blocked by incubation with beta-receptor antagonist propranolol, or with alpha-receptor antagonist prazosin, while a combination of propranolol and prazosin completely inhibited the norepinephrine-induced testosterone production. Moreover, isoproterenol and phenylephrine in combination stimulated testosterone more than either drug did alone. Measurements of concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine in testicular homogenates revealed higher values for these catecholamines than in the plasma, implying that catecholamine levels in the interstitial spaces of the testis might be in the range of concentrations effectively stimulating testosterone production in vitro. This suggests that in the immature testis of the golden hamster, catecholamines acting through both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors may be potent physiological stimulators of testosterone production.", 
    "65": "The functional role of alpha-adrenoceptors was investigated in different parts of the rabbit heart. Phenylephrine (PE) caused a marked increase in force of contraction (Fc) and a prolongation of the action potential (AP) in preparations from the left atrium and the right ventricle. The response was less pronounced in the right atrium and in the left ventricle, whereas APs of spontaneously beating sinoatrial preparations remained completely unchanged. Phentolamine as well as the diesters phorbol 12,13 dibutyrate (PDBu) or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) eliminated the effects of PE. The contribution of alpha-adrenoceptors to the effects of adrenaline (Adr) and noradrenaline (NA) on Fc was determined in preparations from the right ventricle. Phentolamine and the phorbol diesters reduced the effects of Adr and NA by about 30 to 60%; the remaining response was abolished by propranolol. It can be derived from our experiments that, in some parts of the rabbit heart, a considerable amount of the effects of Adr and NA is due to the stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors. The present findings therefore support the view that, in the rabbit heart, the maximally effective drive of the heart requires the stimulation of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. The inhibitory effects of phorbol diesters on the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated response indicate that the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) specifically uncouples alpha-adrenoceptors from the effector system, whereas the response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation remains unchanged.", 
    "66": "The voltage-dependent sodium channel has been proposed as a specific target for the actions of the anticonvulsant drug phenytoin. Working at 0-4 degrees, we previously reported the existence of specific [3H]phenytoin binding sites in rat brain membranes. In the present study, the binding of [3H]phenytoin was assessed at 22 degrees, a temperature favorable to the binding of sodium channel ligands. At 22 degrees, the site had a Kd of 1.5 microM, which is in the relevant therapeutic concentration range for anticonvulsant activity (1-10 microM), and a calculated Bmax of 4.5 pmol/mg of protein, which is similar to previous estimates of sodium channel concentration in brain membranes. In competition experiments, specific [3H]phenytoin binding was found to be inhibited by drugs that interact with the sodium channel, including antiarrhythmics, local anesthetics, anticonvulsants, and site-specific neurotoxins (the steroidal alkaloid activators, beta-scorpion venoms, and brevetoxin-3). Diazepam, used clinically in the management of tonic-clonic status epilepticus, and flunarizine, a calcium channel blocker with anticonvulsant activity, potentiated [3H]phenytoin binding at micromolar concentrations. Other drugs and ligands, including neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and ligands for other ion channels, had no effect. Depolarization with KCl showed [3H]phenytoin binding to be voltage sensitive. Experiments with batrachotoxin (a specific site 2 toxin) and anticonvulsants demonstrated that the interactions between these compounds and the [3H]phenytoin binding site are allosteric in nature. These results provide direct evidence that phenytoin interacts with the voltage-dependent sodium channel and indicate that such interactions take place at therapeutic concentrations. They support previous proposals, based on toxin-binding and electrophysiological studies, that the therapeutic effects of phenytoin result from a selective inhibition of voltage-dependent sodium flux.", 
    "67": "beta-Hexosaminidases, potent mitogens in bovine tracheal myocytes (BTM), stimulate a rapid and transient increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation. The objective of this study was to elucidate the contribution of cAMP in hexosaminidase-induced airway muscle proliferation. Rate of DNA synthesis was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation in quiescent cells prepared by a low-serum treatment (0.4%) for 48 h after reaching confluency in microtiter wells. cAMP accumulation was measured in acetylated cell extracts in the presence of isobutyl methylxanthine (100 microM) by radioimmunoassay using 125I-cAMP as tracer. Exposure of quiescent cells to purified human placental hexosaminidase B (5 micrograms/ml, 50 nM) caused a significant transient increase in cAMP accumulation (49 to 107 fmol/micrograms protein, or a 20- to 70-fold increase from basal level). Maximum increase occurred at 15 min followed by a rapid decline in cAMP accumulation within 30 min after exposure to hexosaminidase. Similar results were obtained in cells treated with neoglycoprotein mannose bovine serum albumin (100 to 500 nM). The increase in cAMP accumulation was inhibited by mannan (mannose receptor blocker, 0.1 mg/ml), as well as phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA; A1 receptor agonist that inhibits adenylyl cyclase, 0.1 to 1.0 microM). The increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation induced by hexosaminidase B was also inhibited by mannan and PIA. Exposure to 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (cpt-cAMP; a cell-permeable analog of cAMP, 100 microM) or forskolin (a direct activator of catalytic subunit of adenylyl cyclase, 24 microM) up to 6 h enhanced 3H-thymidine incorporation. In contrast, a prolonged exposure (18 to 30 h) to these agents inhibited 3H-thymidine incorporation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "Bis(benzylisoquinoline) alkaloids block Ca2+ uptake through the L-type Ca2+ channel and modulate binding of ligands to four distinct sites (dihydropyridine, benzothiazepine, aralkylamine, and (diphenylbutyl)piperidine) in the Ca2+ entry blocker receptor complex of the channel. These alkaloids are structural analogs of tetrandrine, which has previously been demonstrated to block the L-type Ca2+ channel through interaction at the benzothiazepine (diltiazem) site (King et al., 1988). Different alkaloid conformational classes display either alpha-beta, beta-alpha, alpha-alpha, or beta-beta stereochemistry at the two chiral isoquinoline carbons. Compounds from all four classes were tested for their ability to interact with Ca2+ entry blocker ligands. All analogs completely inhibit diltiazem binding, but many only partially inhibit D-600 and fluspirilene binding. For dihydropyridine binding, the compounds show either stimulation or inhibition or exhibit no effect. This profile is quite different from the interaction displayed by diltiazem or tetrandrine. Scatchard analyses show effects predominantly on Kd for diltiazem, D-600, and PN200-110 binding. Representative conformers do not effect diltiazem dissociation rates but alter dissociation kinetics of ligands which bind to the other three sites. A correlation of the ability of these compounds to inhibit Ca2+ uptake through the L-type Ca2+ channel in GH3 cells exists only with their inhibition of diltiazem binding but not with inhibition of binding of ligands representing other classes of Ca2+ entry blockers. These data, taken together, indicate that a variety of bis(benzylisoquinoline) congeners act to block the L-type Ca2+ channel by binding to the benzothiazepine site on the channel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The effect of alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation on the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) was examined in isolated guinea pig ventricular cells by use of the patch-clamp method. IK was evoked by a 3-second depolarizing pulse from a holding potential of -30 mV in a Na(+)- and K(+)-free solution containing 3 microM nifedipine. Phenylephrine (30 microM) in the presence of propranolol (1 microM) produced an increase in IK. In five cells, phenylephrine increased the tail current of IK by 23 +/- 5%. This effect of phenylephrine was blocked by prazosin (0.3 microM), a selective alpha 1-blocker. Phenylephrine produced only a small effect on the voltage and time dependence of IK. Pretreatment with 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7, 10 microM) abolished the phenylephrine-induced increase in IK. In addition, pretreatment with a maximally effective concentration of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (100 nM) abolished the phenylephrine-induced increase in IK. In conclusion, alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation increases IK in guinea pig cardiomyocytes. This alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated response may be related to an activation of protein kinase C. The increase in IK may explain a shortening of action potential duration observed after alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation in guinea pig cells.", 
    "70": "Arrhythmia was produced by the rapid intravenous injection of ouabain 200 micrograms/kg in anesthetized guinea-pigs. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation (V.F.) induced by the ouabain challenge was significantly decreased by the pretreatment with prostaglandin (PG) E1 5 micrograms/kg or propranolol 0.5 mg/kg, but not with prostacyclin (PGI2) 0.5 or 5 micrograms/kg. Also, a significant number of animals treated with PGE1 or propranolol, but not PGI2, showed recurrent reversion to sinus or ventricular rhythm from V.F. and survived more than 20 min after the ouabain challenge. On the other hand, almost all animals treated with PGI2 produced V.F., which converted to cardiac arrest within 20 min after the ouabain challenge. The finding shows that PGI2 has no protective action on V.F. induced by ouabain in anesthetized guinea-pigs. Involvement of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerve terminals in ouabain-induced V.F. was assumed.", 
    "71": "68 urethan-anesthetized rabbits were prepared for registration of changes of respiration, arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) due to stimulation of area postrema (AP) by rectangular pulse trains each lasting for 4 s for every 30 s. During 40 min of such a stimulation paradigm the venous blood samples were collected for radioimmunoassay of plasma renin activity (PRA) (both pre- and post-stimulation), RSNA registered and processed by a computer. Animals were divided into three groups: (1) with AP stimulation only (n = 47); (2) AP stimulation after bilateral renal denervation (n = 13); (3) AP stimulation after propranolol injection (n = 8). In Group I, a 91% increase in PRA, an augmentation of RSNA, a rise of BP and a decrease of HR were observed, while respiration did not show obvious change. In Group II, hemodynamic and RSNA response was similar to that in Group I, but PRA was not changed significantly. In Group III, the effects on BP, HR, respiration and RSNA showed no remarkable changes compared with Group I, but significant inhibition of the response of PRA [from 0.65 +/- 0.07 ng/(ml.h-1) to 0.72 +/- 0.10 ng/(ml.h-1), P > 0.05] was observed. The results mentioned above suggested that electrical stimulation of AP may induce an increase in renin release and renal sympathetic nerve activity and hemodynamic changes in rabbits.", 
    "72": "1. Intracellular pH (pHi) was recorded ratiometrically in isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes using the pH-sensitive fluoroprobe, carboxy-SNARF-1 (carboxy-seminaphthorhodafluor). 2. Following an intracellular acid load (10 mM NH4 Cl removal), pHi recovery in HEPES-buffered Tyrode solution was inhibited by 1.5 mM amiloride (Na(+)-H+ antiport blocker). In the presence of amiloride, switching from HEPES buffer to HCO3-/CO2 (pHo of both solutions = 7.4) stimulated a pHi recovery towards more alkaline levels. 3. Amiloride-resistant, HCO(3-)-dependent pHi recovery was inhibited by removal of external Na+ (replaced by N-methyl-D-glucamine), whereas removal of external Cl- (replaced by glucuronate, leading to depletion of internal Cl-), removal of external K+, or decreasing external Ca2+ by approximately tenfold had no inhibitory effect. These results suggest that the amiloride-resistant recovery is due to a Na(+)-HCO3- cotransport into the cell. 4. The stilbene derivative DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid, 500 microM) slowed Na(+)-HCO(3-)-dependent pHi recovery. 5. Intracellular pH increased in Cl(-)-free solution and this increase still occurred in Na(+)-free solution indicating that it is not caused via Na(+)-HCO3- symport and is more likely to be due to Cl- efflux in exchange for HCO3- influx on a sarcolemmal Cl(-)-HCO3- exchanger. The lack of any significant pHi recovery from intracellular acidosis in Na(+)-free solution suggests that this exchanger does not contribute to acid-equivalent extrusion. 6. Possible voltage sensitivity and electrogenicity of the co-transport were examined by using the whole-cell patch clamp technique in combination with SNARF-1 recordings of pHi. Stepping the holding potential from -110 to -40 mV did not affect amiloride-resistant pHi recovery from acidosis. Moreover, following an intracellular acid load, the activation of Na(+)-HCO3- co-influx (by switching from HEPES to HCO3-/CO2 buffer) produced no detectable outward current (outward current would be expected if the coupling of HCO3- with Na+ were > 1.0). 7. Intracellular intrinsic buffering power (beta i) was assessed as a function of pHi (beta i computed from the decrease of pHi following reduction of extracellular NH4 Cl in amiloride-containing solution). beta i in the ventricular myocyte increases roughly linearly with a decrease in pHi according the following equation: beta i = -28(pHi) +222.6. 8. Comparison of acid-equivalent efflux via Na(+)-HCO3- symport and Na(+)-H+ antiport showed that, following an intracellular acidosis, the symport accounts for about 40% of total acid efflux, the other 60% being carried by the antiport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "73": "Calcitonin gene related peptide has been shown to relax vascular and intestinal smooth muscle. This study examines the effects of calcitonin gene related peptide on cholecystokinin-induced contraction of guinea pig gallbladder strips in vitro. Calcitonin gene related peptide was found to cause a dose-dependent relaxation of cholecystokinin-induced tension, which was blocked by the calcitonin gene related peptide receptor antagonist human calcitonin gene related peptide. Previous studies demonstrated that calcitonin gene related peptide acted directly on guinea pig gallbladder smooth muscle to inhibit acetylcholine- or KCl-induced contraction. The present results further confirm that calcitonin gene related peptide acts directly on the smooth muscle. In addition, the use of L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester, glibenclamide, and other agents strongly suggests that calcitonin gene related peptide also acts by way of the nonadrenergic noncholinergic nervous system, to induce the relaxation of cholecystokinin-induced contraction observed in the guinea pig gallbladder strips.", 
    "74": "To assess the effects of age on responsiveness of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) release, and the possible contribution of cardiac sympathetic activity, in young (n = 8) and older normotensives (n = 7), the effects of cardiac volume load on plasma ANF, central venous pressure, and general hemodynamics were evaluated. Studies were performed after pretreatment with placebo or 80 mg propranolol. Cardiac volume loading increased central venous pressure by 3-5 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa); beta-blockade did not affect this response. Cardiac volume load caused significant increases in heart rate (10-15 beats/min) and cardiac index (by 0.7-0.8 L.min-1.m-2) and decreases in plasma catecholamines. Propranolol attenuated the increases in heart rate and cardiac index. These hemodynamic responses did not differ significantly between the two groups of subjects. Cardiac volume load significantly increased plasma ANF, by 87 +/- 21 pg/mL in the young normotensives and by 212 +/- 33 pg/mL in the older normotensives (p < 0.01, young vs. older). beta-Blockade did not affect this different response. Our results show that the plasma ANF response to volume loading is potentiated by aging. Although differences in atrial stretch cannot be excluded, this effect may relate to the decrease in clearance of plasma ANF occurring with aging.", 
    "75": "Effects of nanomolar to submillimolar carteolol, a non-selective beta-antagonist, on the evoked release at 1 Hz and the spontaneous release in the absence and presence of uptake1 and uptake2 blockers were studied in pulmonary arteries, isolated from guinea pigs, and then preloaded with [3H]noradrenaline. dl-Carteolol at 10(-8), 10(-7) and 10(-6) M applied at the increasing concentrations inhibited the evoked [3H]-release in untreated arteries and in desipramine and corticosterone-treated arteries. The spontaneous [3H]-release slightly but significantly increased or tended to increase in untreated arteries. dl-Carteolol at 10(-5) and 10(-4) M clearly and concentration-dependently increased the spontaneous [3H]-release in untreated and cocaine-treated arteries. This increase was markedly inhibited by further pretreatment with normetanephrine. The evoked [3H]-release was not altered by dl-carteolol at 10(-5) M, but increased at 10(-4) M. This increase was not modified by cocaine and by cocaine and normetanephrine. d-Carteolol at 10(-5) and 10(-4) M produced effects similar to those of dl-carteolol. Nanomolar to micromolar dl-carteolol inhibits the evoked [3H]-release, which supports our previous conclusion that this inhibition is due to blockade of tonically functioning presynaptic beta 2-adrenoceptors. Carteolol at the higher concentrations seems to become a substrate for an uptake2 mechanism and to produce an unknown sympathomimetic activity in guinea pig pulmonary arteries.",

    "77": "The elderly constitute a high-risk group in which the benefit of treatment of hypertension is now obvious. The initial drug should be a low-dose diuretic, followed by a beta-blocker. At present there are no data favoring the use of an ultra low-dose diuretic, such as 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide, unless there is coexisting prediabetes or gout.", 
    "78": "Forty eight neonates, born to mothers suffering from pregnancy induced hypertension and receiving labetalol for control of blood pressure, were studied for the possible adverse effects of the drug. These were compared with eighty one neonates matched for gestation and weight and born to mothers with pregnancy induced hypertension treated with drugs other than labetalol. Incidence of birth asphyxia and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in the study population was 10.4 and 22.9%, respectively and in the control group 5 and 19.7%, the difference between two groups was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). However, the incidence of hypoglycemia was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the study group (47.9%) as compared to the control group (17.2%). Two-thirds of the hypoglycemic babies in the study population were asymptomatic and they were managed with sugar-fortified milk feeds. In the study population, the symptomatic hypoglycemic babies had hypoglycemia for prolonged duration of 43.3 +/- 23.3 hours as compared to 11.5 +/- 6.3 hours in symptomatic hypoglycemic babies of the control group (p < 0.01). The mothers of the symptomatic babies in the study group received higher doses of labetalol in the range of 287.6 +/- 142.3 mg/day while rest of the mothers in the same group whose babies had either asymptomatic hypoglycemia or normal blood glucose levels, received 239.5 +/- 118.5 mg/day, though the difference was not statistically significant. It is concluded that maternal labetalol therapy is associated with increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia.", 
    "79": "The effects of six weeks of treatment with the selective peripheral alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker terazosin, or the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol on blood pressure, exercise performance and blood lipid profile were compared in a single-blind, randomized, crossover study of 17 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Although both drugs significantly reduced blood pressure at rest, atenolol caused a larger fall in supine blood pressure (11/11 and 7.5/7.0 mmHg, atenolol and terazosin, respectively; p < 0.001). Both treatments controlled the pressor response to exercise, although a greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure was observed at the end of exercise on terazosin (74.0 +/- 5.7 and 91.6 +/- 4.0 mmHg, terazosin and atenolol, respectively; p < 0.01). Alpha 1-blocker therapy was not associated with any measurable improvement or deterioration in cardiopulmonary performance and exercise duration. Unlike atenolol, terazosin therapy had the potentially beneficial effect of reducing serum total cholesterol levels and increasing the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol/low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio.", 
    "80": "Despite the availability of numerous antihypertensive agents, a concerted research effort to develop new approaches to hypertension treatment is necessary. Published results of large multicenter trials emphasize the benefits of available treatments in highly selected patients. A critical look at the results shows that treatment failure is frequent and side effects are common. In the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, 28 to 35% of patients did not reach the goal blood pressure, 13% stopped treatment because of side effects, and 21% required medication other than a diuretic and a beta-blocker. Basic research may bring forth novel concepts of treatment, such as neutral endopeptidase inhibition, renin inhibition, or new techniques such as gene therapy. In the meantime, among many other lines of research, type 1 angiotensin II-receptor antagonists represent a promising new group of agents for the vast majority of hypertensive patients who are renin-dependent. A different global approach to hypertension management is also needed. Because hypertension is a heterogeneous disease, individual sequential monotherapy or the \"N of 1\" trial aim to select the most effective drug for each patient. To achieve the accurate assessment of drug efficacy that is a prerequisite for this approach, the number of blood pressure measurements before and during drug administration must be increased. For this purpose, self-blood pressure measurement and teletransmission of results to the physician will provide a major treatment advance.", 
    "81": "The aim of this study was to assess the influence of antihypertensive agents on arterial wave reflections (AWR) and carotid pulse pressure (PP) in humans. Twenty patients with hypertension (predominantly systolic) were studied. After one month of placebo therapy they were randomly assigned to atenolol (At) 50 mg/day or to nitrendipine (Ni) 40 mg/day. Carotid pressure waveform was recorded noninvasively by applanation tonometry using a Millar micromanometer-tipped probe. Arterial wave reflections were quantified as the ratio of the height of the late systolic peak (delta P) to the total height of carotid pulse pressure wave as an augmentation index (delta P/PP). Travel time of the reflected wave (delta tp) was timed from the foot of the pressure wave to the foot of the late systolic peak. Atenolol and Ni were equally effective in reducing sphygmomanometric brachial artery blood pressure (BP). Whereas At (p < 0.05) and Ni (p < 0.01) reduced the carotid PP, Ni (p < 0.01) but not At significantly reduced delta P/PP. Both agents increased the delta tp (p < 0.01) and decreased aortic PWV (p < 0.01). Nitrendipine was associated with a decrease in left ventricular ejection time (LVET) (p < 0.01), while At increased heart period (p < 0.01) and LVET. The LVET/delta tp ratio decreased after Ni (from 3.25 +/- 0.77 to 2.42 +/- 0.73; p < 0.01) but did not change after At. The study shows, that for the same effect on peripheral BP, Ni has a more pronounced effect on pressure wave in central arteries, resulting from an improvement in the timing between the ventricular ejection and AWRs.", 
    "82": "In patients in whom monotherapy does not control blood pressure a second agent is required. Common combinations in clinical practice are a beta-blocker plus a diuretic, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus a diuretic, a beta-blocker plus a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, and an ACE inhibitor plus a calcium antagonist. Since both ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are metabolically inert and exert favorable effects on target organ disease, their combination is of particular interest. When combined, these two drug classes have additive effects on antihypertensive efficacy, reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy, and protection of the renal circulation. However, whether or not these favorable pathophysiologic changes induced with combination therapy of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists will translate into a reduction of morbidity and mortality remains to be documented.", 
    "83": "It is now recognized that left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), often associated with hypertension, is itself a risk factor for coronary disease in the elderly. Although many agents are capable of controlling blood pressure, the ability of these agents to induce regression of left ventricular (LV) mass, and the effect of regression on diastolic relaxation and contractile indices in the elderly are less well known. Our study compared the ability of the calcium blocker, verapamil, and the beta-blocker, atenolol, to both control blood pressure (BP) and to induce regression of LV mass in older hypertensives. In addition, the influence of regression on resting diastolic filling and on cardiac output and ejection fraction during rest and mild upright bicycle exercise were determined. Forty-two hypertensives 60 years of age or above, without evidence of ischemic disease underwent 2-D echocardiographic evaluation of LV mass and gated blood pool scan determination of early diastolic filling, cardiac output and ejection fraction. They were then randomized to receive verapamil or atenolol during a four-week titration period so as to achieve a BP of less than 160/90 mm Hg. If BP was not controlled with either agent, chlorthalidone was added. Individuals whose BP was controlled continued on the protocol for six months. At that time, the echocardiographic and gated blood pool studies were repeated both on and after subsequent withdrawal of the study medications. Twenty-one patients were randomized to receive verapamil and 21 patients to receive atenolol. Blood pressure control was achieved with verapamil alone in 18 patients, but with atenolol alone in only 8 patients (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "84": "In order to further define clinical and angiocardiographic predictors of long-term survival after myocardial infarction we followed 616 consecutive male patients under 60 years of age, survivors of a first (N = 455) or recurrent (N = 161) myocardial infarction, for 8.8 +/- 2.9 years. Patients had angiocardiography at 4-8 weeks after infarction; none had thrombolysis, but 33% had cardiac surgery, 14% on a clinical trial basis. Left ventricular end-systolic volume was the most powerful predictor of cardiac mortality; ejection fraction and end-diastolic volume added no further information. Myocardial score, a measure of the severity of coronary stenoses in relation to the amount of myocardium supplied, was of only borderline predictive value on multivariate analysis, possibly because any effect had been negated by coronary surgery. Administration of beta-blocker drugs had an independent effect of improving prognosis, while continued cigarette smoking worsened it. Age, status of index infarction (first or recurrent) and serum cholesterol did not affect survival. A trial of surgery, carried out in a subset of 200 of these patients who were relatively asymptomatic but had severe coronary disease, showed no survival advantage for intended surgical over non-surgical management. We conclude that a high left ventricular end-systolic volume remains the most important adverse prognostic factor after recovery from myocardial infarction.", 
    "85": "We compared the blood pressure (BP) measurements obtained with a random-zero sphygmomanometer and an ambulatory BP monitor in older persons with isolated systolic hypertension at one site of the multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial, the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) randomized clinical trial. The subjects were community-dwelling elderly participants with isolated systolic hypertension enrolled in the SHEP study and already receiving stable doses of double-blind medication (n = 35 for active treatment group; n = 32 for placebo group). We measured seated (clinic) BP obtained with a random-zero sphygmomamanometer, pulse rate, and BP and heart rate measurements obtained with an ambulatory BP monitor (average 24 h, daytime, and nighttime BP and heart rate). Across treatment groups clinic and ambulatory systolic BPs were not significantly different, but the placebo group had higher ambulatory, but not clinic, diastolic BPs. Within each treatment group (active treatment and placebo) there were no significant differences between clinic and average 24 h, daytime, or nighttime ambulatory systolic BPs. There were also no significant differences between clinic diastolic BP and average 24 h, daytime, or nighttime ambulatory diastolic BPs in the active treatment group, but in the placebo group average 24 h diastolic BP obtained by the ambulatory monitor was 4.6 mm Hg higher than clinic diastolic BP (P = .001). The average 24 h heart rate was 6 to 7 beats/min higher as measured by the ambulatory monitor compared to clinic pulse (P < .01). In the placebo group of this study, average 24 h ambulatory diastolic BPs were consistently higher than clinic diastolic BPs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "The treatment of chronic ventricular arrhythmias depends on the severity and tolerance of the arrhythmia. Extrasystoles, even repetitive, in the healthy heart, are usually respected when asymptomatic or treated with betablockers in first intention when symptomatic. These drugs should also be proposed for patients with ischemic heart disease and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, a situation in which Class I antiarrhythmics should be avoided. The prevention of sustained ventricular tachycardial may be empirical, with betablockers and/or amiodarone, or guided by the results of pharmacological tests during endocavitary electrophysiological studies.", 
    "87": "The aim of our study was to correlate betablocker effects on premature ventricular beats (PVBs) with different patterns between PVB frequency and cardiac cycle. The computer program we used correlates each PVB to the preceding cycle length in a 24-hour electrocardiogram recording. The arrhythmic patterns obtained were defined as tachycardia-dependent, indifferent and bradycardia-dependent. We selected 51 patients (39 males, 12 females, mean age 52 years) with different cardiac diseases, all in sinus rhythm, with > 25 PVBs/h, characterized by PVB stability and reproducible pattern in 2 Holter monitoring recorded at a 3-5 day interval. A tachycardia-dependent pattern (TDP) was demonstrated in 20 patients; 22 patients showed an indifferent pattern (IP) and 9 a bradycardia-dependent pattern (BDP). A third Holter monitoring was performed 4-5 days after nadolol administration (80 mg/day). Nadolol caused a 87.7% PVB suppression in TDP patients (p < 0.001), a 34.8% PVB reduction in IP patients (p < 0.01) and a 36.3% increase in BDP patients (NS). The different effect of nadolol on these groups was highly significant (chi 2 30.9; p < 0.0001). These results indicate that pattern definitions is useful in identifying PVB subsets which are likely to be improved, or not, by betablockers.", 
    "88": "Syncope in apparently healthy subjects is usually attributed to a vasovagal reaction. However, a vagal cardio-inhibitory component is not always associated with a vasodepressor component in causing syncope: in fact, increases in heart rate, arterial pressure and plasmatic levels of catecholamines frequently precede loss of consciousness.", 
    "89": "Prolonged 60 degrees head-up tilt table test (HUTT) was performed in 50 healthy subjects (27 male, 23 female - mean age 37.2 years) with recurrent syncope of vasodepressor or unknown origin. The upright-tilt test lasted 45 minutes: every minute of HUTT we measured heart rate (HR) and systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP); at set intervals we took a blood sample to determine epinephrine (EP) and norepinephrine (NEP) levels.", 
    "90": "In patients with positive HUTT (42%) we observed a vaso-vagal response (10 patients) characterized by a sharp drop in SBP and DBP (> 50% of the basal values) and bradycardia (< 40 bpm) and/or sinus node arrests, and a hyperchronotropic-vasodepressor response (11 patients) characterized by a considerable increase in HR (> 60%) and simultaneous drop in SBP and DBP (> 30% of the basal values), and a large increase in plasmal EP (+881.9%).", 
    "91": "According to the Authors, vasovagal response is mainly due to a reflex reaction originating from the cardiac stretch-receptors, whereas hyperchronotropic-vasodepressor response is mainly due to psychic stress and anxiety provoked by prolonged and forced posture during HUTT. The high levels of adrenergic activity and plasmal EP cause the excessive chronotropic response and the vasal effects of the syndrome. Due to the induction of a state of anxiety and its postural effects, HUTT is a useful provocative tool for complete evaluation of young patients with syncope of vasodepressor origin. We treated the patients differently, depending on how they responded to HUTT. Those with a vaso-vagal response were treated with alpha-sympathomimetic agents (ethylephrine or mydodrine) and those with a hyperchronotropic-vasodepressor response received non-selective beta-blockers. None of our patients had syncope recurrences during a mean follow-up of 12.3 months. Only two patients complained of dizziness; in one of them, symptomatology was abolished by an alpha-sympathomimetic beta-blocker association.", 
    "92": "alpha-Chloralose is an anesthetic commonly used in cardiovascular research. Using a chronically instrumented neonatal lamb model, we previously determined that chloralose has important effects on basal hemodynamics and arterial oxygen tension as compared with those of paired conscious control lambs. We wished to determine whether beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation accounted for chloralose-induced hemodynamic effects and to investigate the influence of chloralose and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonism on oxygen metabolism. In paired studies, five lambs were given chloralose intravenously (30 mg/kg i.v.) after propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) or saline control. The group pretreated with propranolol had reduced heart rate (HR 206 +/- 12 vs. 244 +/- 10 beats/min, p = 0.04) and cardiac output (CO 253 +/- 29 vs. 302 +/- 40 ml/min/kg, p = 0.005) 30 min after chloralose as compared with control; pretreatment with propranolol also attenuated the systemic hypertensive response to chloralose (77 +/- 8 vs. 89 +/- 5 mm Hg, p = 0.055). No difference in the response of stroke volume (SV), atrial or pulmonary arterial pressures, or pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances (PVR, SVR) were observed between treatment groups. No differences between propranolol and saline treatment groups were observed in arterial and mixed venous oxygen contents, arteriovenous (A-V) oxygen difference, oxygen extraction, or oxygen consumption; a reduction in oxygen delivery observed after propranolol as compared with saline was not altered by chloralose. We conclude that tachycardia and increase in CO induced by chloralose in lambs probably are mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, which may be direct or indirect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "93": "Sympathetic stimulation with epinephrine (EPI) combined with parasympathetic blockade with atropine was studied in 10 healthy volunteers premedicated with placebo or three different beta-adrenoceptor blockers: atenolol (62.5 micrograms/kg, beta 1-selective), propranolol (62.5 micrograms/kg, nonselective), and pindolol (7.5 micrograms/kg, nonselective with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, ISA). EPI infusion (0.06 microgram/kg/min) after placebo increased heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and decreased diastolic BP (DBP). Pretreatment with atenolol reduced the HR increase, and caused similar changes in BP. In contrast, pretreatment with propranolol and pindolol decreased HR and increased BP. Combined EPI and atropine (15 micrograms/kg) after placebo increased HR by 40% without causing BP changes. Similar HR changes were observed after administration of all beta-adrenoceptor blockers, but whereas a marked pressor response was observed after propranolol and pindolol a blunted response was observed after atenolol. Propranolol and pindolol reduced myocardial oxygen demand estimated by the HR x BP product after EPI, but this response was abolished by atropine. Serum potassium decreased from 3.9 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.3 mM after EPi and atropine. This effect was less after atenolol, and potassium increased after premedication with propranolol and pindolol. Our results show that nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade has a favorable effect on potassium homeostasis and oxygen demand parameters during EPI infusion but causes a marked pressor response, contrary to a beta 1-selective agent, during combined sympathetic stimulation and parasympathetic blockade. They also highlight the importance of the vasodilator cholinergic system as a defense mechanism in such situations.", 
    "94": "Using cardiac microdialysis, we studied release of the adenine nucleotide breakdown products (ANBP) adenosine (ADS), inosine (INS), and hypoxanthine (HYP) into the interstitium of canine myocardium during 20- and 40-min occlusion of the anterior descending coronary artery and reperfusion. Dialysate ANBP concentrations reached maximum values not at the end of ischemia but in the first 10 min of reperfusion. The effect was more pronounced after 20-min ischemia. Further reperfusion led to an ANBP decrease that was more prolonged after 40-min ischemia. Pretreatment with DL-propranolol (0.5 mg/kg, intravenously, i.v.) given 40 min before coronary occlusion had no effect on adenine nucleotide catabolism rate during 20- and 40-min ischemia, but it facilitated washout of ANBP from ischemic zone immediately after the start of reperfusion. A similar effect was elicited by a D-stereoisomer of propranolol with no beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. Results suggest that the reperfusion injury and probably the no-reflow phenomenon were the cause of enhanced adenine nucleotide catabolism at the beginning of reperfusion and prolonged ANBP washout from the ischemic zone. Reduction of reperfusion injury by propranolol could be related to the membrane stabilizing and antioxidant activity of this agent. Examination of DL-propranolol kinetics in arterial and coronary venous blood plasma showed that drug accumulation in the myocardium was almost maximum at the start of ischemia; therefore, the efficiency of cardio-protection with DL-propranolol was not limited by pharmacokinetic causes. Insertion of an additional microdialysis probe in the myocardium allowed monitoring of extracellular propranolol concentrations.", 
    "95": "Previous studies in isolated ventricular myocytes showed that WAY-123,398 is a selective blocker of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK). In this report, we studied the electrophysiological and hemodynamic effects of WAY-123,398 in open-chest anesthetized dogs. WAY-123,398 prolonged atrial and ventricular refractoriness without affecting conduction; WAY-123,398 was as effective as UK-68798, E-4031, and dl-sotalol, but less potent than UK-68798 and E-4031. The increase in atrial refractoriness was approximately twice as large as the ventricular increase with all compounds. The hemodynamic effects of WAY-123,398 were similar to those of UK-68798; at the ED20 for increasing ventricular refractoriness, WAY-123,398 did not affect the mean arterial pressure and decreased the heart rate by 20%. In a different series of experiments, all four compounds produced large and comparable increases in the ventricular fibrillation threshold in anesthetized dogs; WAY-123,398 and UK-68798 induced defibrillation and restoration of sinus rhythm in two of six dogs each and E-4031 in one of six dogs. No episodes of drug-induced restoration to sinus rhythm were observed in dogs treated with sotalol or vehicle. In conclusion, WAY-123,398 is an effective Class III agent without Class I actions and with a favorable hemodynamic profile.", 
    "96": "We examined the electromechanical effects of two class III antiarrhythmic agents, dofetilide (UK-68,798) and D-sotalol, in acidic myocardium. Right ventricular papillary muscle preparations isolated from guinea pigs were divided into three groups (n = 6 per group): (a) drug-free, (b) dofetilide (10 nM), and (c) D-sotalol (30 microM). At normal extracellular pH (pH = 7.32 +/- 0.01), dofetilide and D-sotalol lengthened action potential duration (APD) to a similar extent, i.e., by 18-20%. Effective refractory period (ERP) increased in parallel, whereas membrane diastolic potential (MDP), action potential amplitude (APA), maximum velocity of depolarization (Vmax), and developed force (DF) were not significantly affected. Metabolic acidosis (pH = 6.78 +/- 0.01) was simulated by reducing the bicarbonate concentration of the Tyrode's solution from 20 to 6 mM. Superfusion with acidic solution alone for 30 min markedly decreased Vmax and DF, whereas APD and ERP were lengthened slightly. The acidosis-induced decreases in Vmax and DF were not affected by pretreatment with dofetilide or D-sotalol. In acidic superfusate, both agents still significantly increased APD and ERP to the same extent that they did at normal pH. The results indicate that metabolic acidosis, a major component of myocardial ischemia, does not attenuate the class III antiarrhythmic action of dofetilide and D-sotalol.", 
    "97": "In a randomized, cross-over, double-blind study, the effects of nifedipine were compared with those of diltiazem in 20 patients with severe stable angina pectoris and multivessel coronary artery disease treated with nitrates and beta-blockers. The comparison was performed by bicycle ergometry, clinical evaluation, and ambulatory 24-h ECG monitoring for 7-8 weeks. As compared with placebo, both nifedipine and diltiazem significantly reduced the daily number of anginal attacks and nitroglycerin consumption; prolonged exercise duration, time to 1-mm ST segment depression, and to onset of angina; and reduced the sum of ST segment depressions at maximal identical load in ergometry. In ambulatory ECG monitoring, only nifedipine significantly diminished the duration of asymptomatic ST segment depression as compared with placebo. Antianginal and antiischemic effects of nifedipine and diltiazem were similar. Both nifedipine and diltiazem significantly increased the effects of treatment with nitrates and beta-blockers. Administration of nifedipine was safer because at night diltiazem caused significant bradycardia despite careful titration of optimum doses of the drug. Although the maximum well-tolerated doses of conventional medication suppressed anginal symptoms in some patients, they did not abolish ischemia either at ergometry or in daily life.", 
    "98": "The interaction of naftopidil with adrenoceptors was studied in comparison to standard drugs. Naftopidil binds specifically to alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The Ki values are 58.3 nM for naftopidil, 0.43 nM for prazosin, and 197 nM for urapidil. The affinities of naftopidil to alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptor sites are very low (> 6,000 and > 2,500 nM). Naftopidil relaxes aortic strips precontracted with norepinephrine concentration-dependently, and it shifts the concentration-response curve of norepinephrine in a parallel manner to the right. The pA2 values are 7.10 for naftopidil, 8.85 for prazosin, and 6.25 for urapidil. In pithed rats, naftopidil shifted the dose-response curve of methoxamine at equipotent hypotensive doses to the same extent to the right as does prazosin, but both drugs barely affected (in contrast to phentolamine) the response to norepinephrine. In concentrations that are about 10 times higher than those required for alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade, naftopidil relaxes (in contrast to prazosin) aortic strips depolarized with K+, and it shifts Ca2+ concentration-response curves to the right (pA2 value of 5.90), thus suggesting Ca(2+)-channel-blocking activity. Both alpha-adrenoceptor and Ca(2+)-blocking activities are exerted to nearly the same extent by both stereoisomers. Naftipidil does not affect the response to isoprenaline-induced effects, indicating that the compound does not possess beta-blocking properties.", 
    "99": "Sotalol is a unique beta-blocker that prolongs repolarization. Its use in 626 patients with complex ventricular ectopic activity, as reported in the literature, resulted in suppression of arrhythmia in 50 to 60% of treatment attempts. Detailed analysis of data on arrhythmias in 356 patients that were entered prospectively into a database revealed a median reduction in ventricular premature beats of 76%, compared to a median suppression of repetitive ventricular ectopic activity of 91% and of episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia of 97% (p = 0.002 vs reduction of ventricular premature beats). This marked antiarrhythmic potency of sotalol in repetitive ventricular arrhythmias is thought to be due to its class III activity. Drug efficacy was independent of age, sex, the presence or absence of organic heart disease and the degree of sotalol-induced prolongation of corrected QT interval. Evaluation of left ventricular function in 215 patients treated with the drug demonstrated that depression of left ventricular ejection fraction occurred far less frequently than expected with conventional beta-blockers. Even patients with severely depressed pump function tolerated sotalol surprisingly well. There is a propensity of the drug to aggravate arrhythmia, which resulted in serious proarrhythmic events in 30 (3.5%) of 853 patients. These often consisted of torsades de pointes (9 of 30 patients). Proarrhythmia occurred primarily within the first 3 days of dosing, and exhibited a dose-dependence. In conclusion, sotalol is an effective and well-tolerated antiarrhythmic drug in patients with complex ventricular ectopic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "100": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NGF are both expressed by neurons in the hippocampus. In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that both BDNF and NGF mRNA levels are regulated by neuronal activity. Upregulation is predominantly regulated by the glutamate (NMDA and non-NMDA receptors); downregulation, predominantly by the GABA system (Zafra et al., 1990, 1991). In neuronal cultures of the rat hippocampus, potassium depolarization and kainic acid-mediated increases in BDNF and NGF mRNA were eliminated in a dose-dependent manner by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine. Conversely, calcium ionophores (Bay-K8644 and ionomycin) augmented BDNF and NGF mRNA levels by a calmodulin-mediated mechanism. In view of the fact that many potential modulators (conventional transmitters and neuropeptides) of neuronal and astrocytic BDNF and NGF mRNA synthesis may act via the adenylate cyclase system, we studied the effect of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. Indeed, forskolin enhanced the effects of calcium ionophores and kainic acid on BDNF and NGF mRNA levels. Cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and transforming growth factor-beta 1, which have previously been shown to increase NGF mRNA markedly in astrocytes, were without effect on neuronal BDNF and NGF mRNA levels. In contrast to neuronal cultures, where the regulation of BDNF and NGF mRNA was generally very similar, the regulation in astrocytes was distinctly different. All the cytokines that produce a marked increase in NGF mRNA were without effect on astrocyte BDNF mRNA levels, which under basic conditions were below the detection limit. However, norepinephrine produced a marked elevation of BDNF mRNA in astrocytes, an effect that was further enhanced by glutamate receptor agonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "101": "Binding of GTP induces alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins to take on an active conformation, capable of regulating effector molecules. We expressed epitope-tagged versions of the alpha subunit (alpha s) of Gs in genetically alpha s-deficient S49 cyc- cells. Addition of a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope did not alter the ability of wild type alpha s to mediate hormonal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase or to attach to cell membranes. The HA epitope did, however, allow a mAb to immunoprecipitate the recombinant protein (HA-alpha s) quantitatively from cell extracts. We activated the epitope-tagged alpha s in intact cells by: (a) exposure of cells to cholera toxin, which activates alpha s by covalent modification; (b) mutational replacement of arginine-201 in HA-alpha s by a cysteine residue, to create HA-alpha s-R201C; like the cholera toxin-catalyzed modification, this mutation activates alpha s by slowing its intrinsic GTPase activity; and (c) treatment of cells with the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, which promotes binding of GTP to alpha s, thereby activating adenylyl cyclase. Both cholera toxin and the R201C mutation accelerated the rate of degradation of alpha s (0.03 h-1) by three- to fourfold and induced a partial shift of the protein from a membrane bound to a soluble compartment. At steady state, 80% of HA-alpha s- R201C was found in the soluble fraction, as compared to 10% of wild type HA-alpha s. Isoproterenol rapidly (in < 2 min) caused 20% of HA-alpha s to shift from the membrane-bound to the soluble compartment. Cholera toxin induced a 3.5-fold increase in the rate of degradation of a second mutant, HA-alpha s-G226A, but did not cause it to move into the soluble fraction; this observation shows that loss of membrane attachment is not responsible for the accelerated degradation of alpha s in response to activation. Taken together, these findings show that activation of alpha s induces a conformational change that loosens its attachment to membranes and increases its degradation rate.", 
    "102": "The effect of interferon-alpha on Daudi lymphoma cells either sensitive or resistant to the action of this cytokine has been analysed in terms of phospholipase C (PLC) and D (PLD) activities. Results have shown a combined modulation of PIP2-specific phospholipase C and phospholipase D. In particular, a decreased activity of PIP2-specific PLC has been found, concomitant to a PLD-mediated phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, suggesting that the intracellular signalling activated by interferon in Daudi cells involves a phospholipase D/phosphohydrolase pathway.",

High-risk patients may require revascularization by angioplasty or bypass surgery, whereas low-risk patients can be managed medically. It is important to consider the impact of various anti-ischemic drugs on the myocardial demand-supply equation. A recent study indicated that the combination of a beta blocker plus isosorbide mononitrate is more effective in increasing exercise duration than is either the combination of a beta blocker and a calcium antagonist or triple therapy. In patients with single-vessel disease, angioplasty has been shown to be more effective than medical therapy in relieving symptoms, but the incidence of restenosis and the associated costs are high. Surgery favorably affects mortality in patients with left main coronary artery disease or 3-vessel disease with left ventricular impairment. New evidence suggests that endothelial dysfunction may play a more important role in chronic stable angina pectoris than has been appreciated and that such dysfunction may be treated with nitrates.", 
    "104": "The human 5-HT1D beta serotonin receptor and its rat homolog (also called the 5-HT1B receptor) share 93% amino acid identity, yet display markedly different pharmacological specificities. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences among these and other recently cloned receptors suggested that this phenotypic difference might be attributable to a single human threonine355/rat asparagine351 amino acid difference in the putative seventh membrane spanning regions. We now report that Thr355Asn mutagenesis of the human 5-HT1D beta receptor alters the binding characteristics of the recombinant receptor in [3H]5-HT binding assays to a profile very similar to that of the rat 5-HT1B binding site. These results confirm that this single amino acid difference is responsible for the majority of the known pharmacological discrepancies between human and rat observed for 5-HT1D beta (5-HT1B) receptors.", 
    "105": "The influence of the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor subtype-selective antagonist (+)-niguldipine on the alpha 1-mediated positive inotropic effect was assessed in the isolated rabbit ventricular myocardium. (+)-Niguldipine displaced the specific binding of [3H]prazosin to a membrane fraction derived from rabbit ventricular muscle with high (Ki = 64.6 pmol/l; RH = 23%) and low (Ki = 7.08 nmol/l) affinity. (+)-Niguldipine displaced specific [3H]CGP-121177 binding only at very high concentrations (Ki = 118 nmol/l). (+)-Niguldipine at 0.1 pmol/l and higher shifted the concentration-response curve for the alpha 1-mediated positive inotropic effect downwards, but at higher concentrations (up to 10 and 100 nmol/l) it did not cause a further shift of the curve. (+)-Niguldipine (1-100 nmol/l) did not affect the beta-mediated positive inotropic effect and the basal force of concentration. (-)-Niguldipine also showed a selective inhibitory action on the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic effect, but its affinity and potency were approximately 1-2 log units lower than those of (+)-niguldipine. The present results indicate that the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor subtype is involved in the alpha 1-mediated positive inotropic effect. (+)-Niguldipine (or (-)-niguldipine with lower affinity) is able to antagonize selectively the cardiac alpha 1A-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic effect. The magnitude of the alpha 1A-mediated inotropic effect, however, may be much less than that mediated by the alpha 1B-subtype in the rabbit ventricular myocardium.", 
    "106": "The effects of pretreatment with the potent and selective 5-HT1A receptor ligand, MDL 73005EF, on the cardiovascular responses to administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n- propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), flesinoxan and 5-methylurapidil were studied in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and compared with those of putative 5-HT1A receptor antagonists. MDL 7300EF (0.1-3 mg/kg) induced a dose-dependent but transient decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Pretreatment with doses of 1 or 3 mg/kg MDL 73005EF significantly inhibited the hypotensive and bradycardiac effects of 8-OH-DPAT (0.03-1 mg/kg). Pretreatment with 1 mg/kg MDL 73005EF similarly reduced the hypotensive actions of flesinoxan (0.3-1 mg/kg) and 5-methylurapidil (0.1 mg/kg). In contrast, MDL 73005EF did not significantly affect the decrease in blood pressure induced by administration of 0.01 mg/kg clonidine, 0.3 mg/kg hydralazine or 0.2 mg/kg nifedipine. The effect of 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg) on MAP was also reduced by pretreatment with 1 mg/kg BMY 7378, buspirone or pindolol, but not NAN 190 or spiperone. BMY 7378, NAN 190, pindolol and spiperone induced a significant decrease in blood pressure. To rule out the possibility that the reduced baseline may have influenced responses to 8-OH-DPAT, we showed that pretreatment with the vasodilator, hydralazine (0.3 mg/kg), had no effect on the MAP response to 8-OH-DPAT although it significantly reduced MAP. We conclude that MDL 73005EF acts as a mixed agonist/antagonist at 5-HT1A receptors since it caused a decrease in blood pressure, but also reduced the cardiovascular responses to the 5-HT1A receptor agonists, 8-OH-DPAT, flesinoxan and 5-methylurapidil."
