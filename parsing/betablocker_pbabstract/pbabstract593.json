    "0": "The effect of metoprolol on mortality and morbidity after 15 days, was compared with that of placebo in a double-blind randomised international trial (the MIAMI trial) in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Treatment with intravenous metoprolol (15 mg) or placebo was started shortly after the patient's arrival in hospital within 24 h of the onset of symptoms, and then oral treatment (200 mg daily) was continued for the study period (15 days). Of the 5778 patients included, 2901 were allocated to placebo and 2877 to metoprolol. Definite AMI was confirmed in 4127 patients. There were 142 deaths in the placebo group (4.9%) and 123 deaths in the metoprolol group (4.3%), a difference of 13 per cent with 95 per cent confidence limits of -8 to +33 per cent, not statistically significant (P = 0.29). Previously recorded risk indicators of mortality were analysed in retrospect. These indicated that there was a category which showed higher risk which contained approximately 30% of all randomized patients. In these, the mortality rate in the metoprolol treated group was 29% less than in the placebo group. In the remaining lower risk categories there was no difference between the treatment groups. This subset analysis must be interpreted with caution in view of the findings from other similar studies. Positive effects were observed on the incidence of definite AMI and on serum enzyme activity in patients treated early (less than 7 h). There was no significant effect on ventricular fibrillation but the number of episodes tended to be lower in the metoprolol treated patients during the later phase (6-15 days; 24 vs 54 episodes). The incidence of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, the use of cardiac glycosides and other antiarrhythmics, and the need for pain-relieving treatment were significantly diminished by metoprolol amongst all randomised patients. Adverse events associated with metoprolol were infrequent, expected, and relatively mild.", 
    "1": "S-32-468, a recently synthesized aryloxymethyl beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, was tested for its ability to inhibit activation of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in rabbit and human ciliary process, heart and lung. In both species, S-32-468 was a potent inhibitor of ocular beta-adrenoceptors, with a 9-12 fold selectivity over inhibition of beta-adrenoceptors in cardiac tissue. When applied topically, S-32-468 was more effective than timolol in decreasing intraocular pressure in normal albino rabbits.", 
    "2": "The effect of locus coeruleus lesions, DSP-4 neurotoxin, intraventricular propranolol and dorsal or median raphe lesions on ethanol-induced elevations of corticosterone and NEFA were examined in rats. Locus coeruleus lesions, DSP-4 and propranolol attenuated ethanol-induced elevations of NEFA, but not corticosterone. Dorsal raphe lesions attenuated the action of ethanol on corticosterone but not NEFA. It is hypothesized that ethanol's action on NEFA levels is mediated by a central noradrenergic system, whereas, its action on corticosterone levels involves the central serotonergic system.", 
    "3": "Effects of nipradilol (K-351) on cardiac performance and myocardial oxygen consumption were investigated in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Nipradilol 0.1 mg/kg i.v. induced falls in systolic and diastolic aortic blood pressure and left ventricular pressure, and decreases in cardiac output, coronary sinus outflow, left ventricular dP/dt and heart rate. Stroke volume was transiently increased and left ventricular stroke work index was significantly decreased, while left ventricular mechanical efficiency was not significantly changed. Myocardial oxygen consumption was significantly decreased. Total peripheral vascular resistance and coronary vascular resistance were persistently increased. Left ventricular enddiastolic pressure was not significantly changed. These results suggest that nipradilol has a possible antianginal property through a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption due to a fall in aortic blood pressure and a decrease in heart rate.", 
    "4": "The synthesis of beta-dialkylaminoethyl ethers (II a-f) and gamma-dialkylaminopropyl ethers (II g-i), as well as of aryl carbamates (III 1, m), starting from (+)-1,3,3-trimethyl-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-6-hydroxyimine (I), is described. beta-Dimethylaminoethyl ether (II a) showed a remarkable hypotensive and bradycardic activity in rats; moreover, nearly all compounds (II) and (III) exhibited a weak antiarrhythmic activity in rats. Infiltration anesthesia in mice, beta-blocking activity in dogs and antiacetylcholine activity in vitro are also reported.", 
    "5": "Heart rate and the role of the autonomic nervous system in hypertensive conscious rats by subtotal nephrectomy were studied. Heart rate is significantly higher in the hypertensive rats. Sympathetic blockade with an intravenous injection of propranolol produces a higher decrease in heart rate of hypertensive rats than in control rats. Intravenous injection of atropine produces an increase in heart rate in both groups of animals. It is significantly higher in the control rats than in hypertensive animals. When the autonomic nervous system is blocked with atropine and propranolol, intrinsic heart rate is similar in both groups of animals. Similar results are obtained after blocking ganglionic transmission with hexamethonium. No significative differences are observed in heart rate after intracerebroventricular injection of hemicholinium-3 between both groups of rats. Results show an increased cardiac sympathetic tone, reduced parasympathetic activities, no alterations in the pacemaker activity and implications of central acetylcholine. These alterations in the autonomic nervous system have an important role in the maintenance of elevated heart rate in this experimental model of arterial hypertension.", 
    "6": "In the perfused stomach preparation of the anaesthetized rat the cholinergic agonists acetylcholine (ACh) and bethanechol stimulated gastric acid secretion. Both agonists produced similar maximal acid output (70 mumols/15 min) when infused intravenously. However, bethanechol was more potent, eliciting half maximal stimulation at 1.98 mumols/kg/h, while the corresponding dose of ACh was 10.95 mumols/kg/h. Secretory responses to either agonist were antagonized in a dose related fashion by blockade of muscarinic receptors with atropine. In contrast, inhibition of nicotinic receptors with hexamethonium produced a striking potentiation of ACh stimulated secretion whilst the bethanechol elicited secretion remained unaffected. In the presence of full nicotinic receptor blockade the ACh response curve was shifted to the left sixfold, half maximal stimulation being produced at 1.79 mumols/kg/h. Cimetidine partially inhibited the secretory responses elicited by either ACh or bethanechol while blockade of adrenoceptors (alpha and beta) did not affect acid output induced by cholinergic agonists. Secretion elicited by ACh is interpreted as being the composite effect of pro-secretory action and an inhibitory mechanism due to the activation of nicotinic receptors. Hexamethonium, through nicotinic receptor blockade, inhibits the restricting mechanism and thus reveals the full stimulatory action of ACh.", 
    "7": "The present investigation was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the experimentally determined degree of supersensitivity to an agonist caused by inhibition of a site of loss depends on the ratio \"Km of the site of loss/ED50 of the agonist\". The influence of inhibition of neuronal uptake by cocaine on the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated effect of noradrenaline was studied on the dog saphenous vein; the influence of inhibition of COMT by U-0521 on the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effect of isoprenaline was studied on the dog saphenous vein and on the guinea-pig trachea; the influence of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by physostigmine on the effect of acetylcholine was studied on the guinea-pig ileum. To further extend the range of values of the ratio \"Km/ED50\", several concentrations of phentolamine, propranolol or atropine were used to \"increase the ED50\" of the respective agonist. It was thus possible to determine the degree of supersensitivity caused by inhibition of a site of loss over a range of \"Km/ED50\" values of 0.02 to 2,307. In seven situations the ratio \"Km/ED50\" was higher than 10. In all of these cases the supersensitivity caused by inhibition of the site of loss was maximal. In eleven situations the ratio \"Km/ED50\" was less than 10 and higher than 0.1 and the supersensitivity obtained was sub-maximal but was closer to the maximum, the closer the ratio was to 10. In two situations the ratio was less than 0.1 and no supersensitivity was obtained. The results confirm the hypothesis.", 
    "8": "In this study 74 men, 40-60 years old, with incapacitating angina pectoris and angiographically verified coronary artery disease (CAD) were compared to an equal number of randomly sampled healthy men matched for age, occupation and place of living. Obesity and smoking were more common in patients than in controls. The patients had elevated cholesterol (C), triglycerides (TG), and phospholipid (PL) levels dependent on raised concentrations of these lipids in the VLDL and LDL. The C and PL levels in the HDL fraction were decreased. Obesity had a significant influence on the VLDL and HDL levels. Also after taking this influence into account, the CAD patients had higher VLDL and LDL levels and a lower HDL concentration than the controls. Furthermore, regardless of the influence of the TG concentration, the HDL level was reduced in the patients. Smoking habits had no significant influence on the lipoprotein levels. Treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs was not associated with any significant alteration of the VLDL or the HDL level. The results strengthen the importance of lipoprotein aberrations as risk factors for coronary heart disease also if observed in association with obesity, smoking and treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs.", 
    "9": "Ca2+ channel blocking agents have proven to be one of the most exciting groups of drugs for management of many cardiovascular diseases and as potentially first-line agents for treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension. Unlike beta blockers, they can directly relax coronary and peripheral arteries and, therefore, reduce total peripheral resistance and improve tissue perfusion. Ca2+ channel blockers are drugs of choice for patients with Prinzmetal's angina and should be first-line drugs for mixed angina, and can be used alone or with beta blockers for classic angina. These drugs as a group have many potential clinical indications, especially in diseases in which vascular or smooth muscle spasm seems to cause the disease. Although all three Ca2+ channel blockers have a common mechanism of action, their cardiac and hemodynamic effects are different, nifedipine being the least depressant to cardiac function. In choosing the right agent, careful consideration should be given to the patient's characteristics in order to derive maximum benefit with minimal risks.", 
    "10": "The treatment of hypertension must be based on pathophysiologic grounds. The drugs that have been used in the classic stepped-care approach are still useful, but the rationale for their usage should not be based on the presumption that all hypertension is mediated by salt and water. Thus, the adolescent obtains greater benefits from a beta-adrenergic blocking drug or a centrally acting antihypertensive. The individual with heart failure may benefit more from a converting enzyme inhibitor than a vasodilator. In cerebrovascular disease with hypertension, dosage must be reduced owing to the enhanced sensitivity of response. New drugs are discussed, and their place in the armamentarium is evaluated.", 
    "11": "This article discusses generalized anxiety disorder in terms of its defining characteristics, its relationship to other psychiatric disorders, its psychobiology, and its treatment. Although generalized anxiety disorder is frequently encountered in general practice, it has been less systematically investigated than the more dramatic forms of anxiety disorders such as panic disorder and phobias. It is concluded that although not as sharply defined as implied by DSM-III, generalized anxiety disorder appears to be a useful diagnostic category.", 
    "12": "A series of controlled studies have demonstrated an antianxiety effect of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs in patients with anxiety. Also, in certain performance situations, beta-blocking drugs may block the autonomic response to stress and reduce anxiety. However, because these drugs are less effective than the benzodiazepines, their role in the treatment of anxiety and phobic disorders appears to be limited.", 
    "13": "In a previous study, a high dosage (2.0 micrograms) of arginine vasotocin (AVT), following 10 micrograms of dichloroisoproterenol, induced oviposition in Anolis carolinensis at the end of the breeding season. The present study determined if a lower dosage of AVT (0.25 microgram), comparable to that effective in other lizard species, would induce oviposition in cycling A. carolinensis. Only a high dosage of AVT (2.0 micrograms), following 10 micrograms of dichloroisoproterenol 15 min beforehand, induced oviposition. These results suggest that uterine smooth muscle of A. carolinensis is relatively insensitive to AVT.", 
    "14": "A recent study, identifying several sulfate conjugates, appears to have led to a full qualitative account of propranolol metabolism in man. The objective of the present investigation was to determine the quantitative fate of propranolol, including the relationship between the primary metabolic pathways, i.e. glucuronidation, side-chain oxidation and ring oxidation. Single 80-mg oral doses of propranolol together with [3H]propranolol were administered to seven normal subjects. Urinary metabolites were determined by HPLC with radiometric detection after hydrolysis of glucuronic acid conjugates and fractionation by solvent extraction. About 90% of the dose was recovered in urine. Twelve metabolites accounted for 91% of the recovered dose. When examining the metabolites based on the primary metabolic pathways, 17% of the dose (range, 10-25%) was going through glucuronidation, 41% (range, 32-50%) through side-chain oxidation, and 42% (range, 27-59%) through ring oxidation. These data show that the net elimination of propranolol is largely due to oxidative metabolism. The relative contribution of the primary pathways is well reflected by the four major propranolol metabolites, i.e. propranolol glucuronide, naphthoxylactic acid, and the glucuronic acid and sulfate conjugates of 4'-hydroxypropranolol. These observations should greatly facilitate future studies of the biochemical mechanisms of propranolol disposition.", 
    "15": "The recently developed, operational model of pharmacological agonism defines the efficacy of agonists by tau = [Ro]/KE, where [Ro] is the total functional concentration of receptors and KE is the concentration of agonist-occupied receptors for half-maximal effect. Theoretically, variations in [Ro] and KE affect tau and in turn, E/[A] curve profiles similarly. Using the beta-adrenoceptor mediated chronotropic responses of the guinea-pig isolated right atrial preparation we have investigated the consequences of experimental [Ro] and KE variation. Bromoacetylalprenolol menthane (M-75) produced displacements of isoprenaline and dichloroisoprenaline E/[A] curves consistent with [Ro] reduction. Cholera toxin produced displacements consistent with decreases in KE. The operational model provides a simple conceptual framework for the prediction and interpretation of changes in E/[A] curve profile resulting from experimental interventions at the post-receptor (KE) level as well as at the receptor ([Ro]) level.", 
    "16": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of atenolol and timolol were studied in six extensive and four poor metabolisers of debrisoquine. There was a significant correlation between the debrisoquine to 4-hydroxydebrisoquine ratio and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) for timolol (rs = 0.75, P less than 0.02). The mean of the AUC values for timolol was significantly greater in the poor metabolisers than in the extensive metabolisers (P less than 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the debrisoquine to 4-hydroxydebrisoquine ratio and beta-adrenoceptor blockade 24 h after dosing with timolol (rs = 0.66, P less than 0.05). The mean degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade was significantly greater in the poor metabolisers than in the extensive metabolisers 24 h after dosing with timolol (P less than 0.01). There was no relation between the debrisoquine to 4-hydroxydebrisoquine ratio and the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of atenolol.", 
    "17": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of Ro31-1118 were examined in groups of healthy volunteers. In three subjects given 10 mg of [14C]-Ro31-1118 orally, peak levels of radioactivity (84 +/- 5 ng/ml) were 16 times those of the parent drug (approximately 5 ng/ml). Very little parent drug was recovered in the urine, although recovery of total radioactivity was nearly 80% in the urine by day 5. In five subjects studied after both oral and intravenous administration of 20 mg Ro31-1118 the average bioavailability was 57% (range 41-73%). Following intravenous infusion the apparent volume of distribution for the five subjects averaged 590 1 (range 510-700 1). The elimination half-life averaged 18 h (range 17-26 h). In eight subjects who received 40, 80, 160 and 320 mg of Ro31-1118 orally there was a linear relationship between dose and plasma concentration (r = 0.999) and between dose and AUC (r = 0.996). Ro31-1118 had no effect on resting heart rate whereas atenolol reduced resting heart rate up to 6 h after all doses. The maximum reduction of an exercise tachycardia after Ro31-1118 (320 mg) was 23.13 +/- 0.7% and compared with atenolol (100 mg) was 28.2 +/- 1.25%. At 24 h the percentage reduction after Ro31-1118 was 21.5 +/- 1.7%, while after atenolol the percentage inhibition had decreased to 11.1 +/- 1.6%. In three subjects Ro31-1118 (160 mg) orally had no effect on resting heart rate, forearm blood flow and systolic blood pressure, while atenolol (50 mg) reduced all three parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "Hybridoma cells bearing monoclonal antibody against the beta-adrenergic ligand alprenolol were used as an immunogen to raise monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies. Of six anti-idiotypic antibodies, which inhibit ligand binding, three were able to recognize beta-adrenergic receptors. One of them, mAb2B4, an IgM that could be amplified into ascites, binds to the beta-adrenergic catecholamine receptors of intact epidermoid A431 cells and precipitates receptors solubilized from plasma membranes by digitonin. This antibody identifies the beta 2-adrenergic receptor of A431 cells as a single 55-kDa protein and stimulates adenylate cyclase activity. This stimulation is inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol.", 
    "19": "We have used a combination of a beta-blocker and verapamil to treat 42 consecutive patients with angina resistant to either agent alone. Patients with heart failure, heart block or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. The mean duration of follow-up was 6.5 months. Thirty-six patients (81%) reported an improvement and the number of angina attacks was reduced from 17/week to 5/week. Side effects necessitated withdrawal of one or both drugs in 6 patients, 2 of whom developed bradyarrhythmias not solely related to drug treatment. The most common complication was mild left ventricular failure (6) treated by reducing or stopping the beta-blocker. The data suggest that the combination of verapamil and a beta-blocker may be used in a relatively unselected group of patients with difficult angina. However, as dosage adjustment and close observation may be necessary to minimise side effects, the use of this combination should be limited to hospital practice.", 
    "20": "The responses of helically cut strips of arteries isolated from five different sites in the body of dogs to relatively selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists and the antagonism exerted on these responses by relatively selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockers have been studied. On all arteries (renal, splenic, cranial mesenteric, jejunal and femoral) phenylephrine was a full agonist whereas UK-14,304 was a partial agonist causing maximal contractions of 49, 30, 27, 27 and 10% of the maximum, respectively. Phenylephrine was more potent than UK-14,304, being 9 times more potent in the renal artery and up to 42 times more potent in the cranial mesenteric artery. In the dog saphenous vein, where there are both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, it has been previously shown that UK-14,304 is 530 times more potent than phenylephrine. Prazosin in low concentrations displaced concentration-response curves for both phenylephrine and UK-14,304 (pA2 values of 8.16-8.43 and 8.13-8.79, respectively) whereas yohimbine was much less potent (pA2 values of 6.53-6.88 and 6.50-7.20, respectively). The results suggest that the alpha-adrenoceptors of all arteries studied are predominantly, if not exclusively, of the alpha 1-subtype.", 
    "21": "The effect of low (50 micrograms) and high (1 mg) doses of the histamine H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine and ranitidine on the first pass extraction of propranolol was studied in the rat isolated perfused liver. Both low and high dose cimetidine increased the area under the perfusate propranolol concentration time curve (AUC) 4 to 5-fold. Although low dose ranitidine did not alter propranolol AUC, high dose ranitidine increased it to the same extent as cimetidine. These results indicate that ranitidine has a clear propensity for microsomal inhibition, but one which is unlikely to be manifest at therapeutic dosage.", 
    "22": "The effect of clinically used equipotent doses of nonselective (beta 1/beta 2; propranolol) and selective (beta 1; atenolol) beta-adrenoceptor blockers on thermoregulation was studied during prolonged exercise in the heat. Oral propranolol (160 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg/day) or matching placebo were taken for 6 days each by 11 healthy young adult caucasian males. Subjects participated in 2 h of block-stepping at a work rate of 54 W in an environmental chamber with a temperature of 33.2 +/- 0.3 degree C dry bulb and 31.7 /+- 0.3 degree C wet bulb, 2 h after ingestion of the final dose of each drug. Both active agents produced similar marked (P less than 0.001) increases in subjective perception of effort, the mechanism of which was not immediately evident from changes in serum electrolytes, blood glucose, blood lactate, or ventilatory parameters. Propranolol did, however, cause a greater rise in serum K+ than placebo (P less than 0.02) and atenolol (P = NS) after exercise. Although rectal and mean skin temperatures were insignificantly altered by beta-adrenoceptor blockade, an increased total sweat production was noted with propranolol (P less than 0.01 vs. placebo) and to a lesser degree atenolol (P = NS vs. placebo) therapy. Analysis of the time course of sweat production showed the propranolol-mediated enhancement of sweating to ensue largely during the initial hour of block-stepping and to be transient in nature. The scientific and clinical implications of this observation will be dependent upon the precise underlying mechanism, a factor not identified by the present study.", 
    "23": "After successful intracoronary thrombolysis of an acute myocardial infarction in 145 patients subsequent intervention procedures were evaluated. In 48 of 62 patients (43%), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed successfully (success rate 77%), 41 patients (28%) were operated on and 56 patients (39%) were treated only medically. During the hospital phase in the angioplasty group, 4 reinfarctions were noted and 3 repeat angioplasties were required, while 41 of the 48 successfully treated patients (85.4%) remained clinically stable. In the surgical group, one cardiac failure occurred, while 40 patients (97.6%) were without cardiac event. In the medical group, 5 patients died (8.9%), 8 patients (14.3%) had a reinfarction, and 76.8% were clinically stable. During the follow-up period in the surgical group of 6 months 37 patients (90.2%) were clinically stable, all in functional classes I and II. In the angioplasty group 33 patients were stable (68.8%), and in the medical group 26 patients were stable (46.6%). In the whole group of 145 patients the hospital mortality together with that in the 6 months follow-up period was 9.7% with a reinfarction rate of 22.8%.", 
    "24": "To determine the importance of the direct and the indirect pressor and vasoconstrictor actions of angiotensin II (ANG II), experiments were conducted in conscious dogs 2 to 8 weeks after instrumentation with aortic catheters and aortic electromagnetic flow probes to measure arterial pressure and cardiac output. Total peripheral resistance was calculated by an on-line digital computer. Pretreatment with propranolol eliminated complicating inotropic effects of norepinephrine, released by the indirect actions of ANG II. The pressor and vasoconstrictor responses after ganglionic blockade, in either the presence or absence of arterial baroreceptor nerves, were considered to be the direct effects of ANG II. In conscious dogs, systemically administered ANG II (32 ng/kg bolus) increased mean arterial pressure by 38 +/- 3 mm Hg, total peripheral resistance by 37 +/- 2 mm Hg/L/minute, and decreased heart rate by 15 +/- 2 beats/minute. After arterial baroreceptor denervation, administration of ANG II increased mean arterial pressure by 88 +/- 7 mm Hg, total peripheral resistance by 54 +/- 4 mm Hg/L/minute, and heart rate by 12 +/- 2 beats/minute. After arterial baroreceptor denervation and ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium, administration of ANG II increased mean arterial pressure by 53 +/- 8 mm Hg, total peripheral resistance by 27 +/- 3 mm Hg/L/minute, and left heart rate unchanged. These results indicate that in the conscious dog without baroreflex buffering nearly one-half of the pressor and vasoconstrictor actions of angiotensin are not direct, but are mediated by the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "25": "We studied the cardiovascular effects of esmolol, a newly synthesized beta-adrenocepter antagonist, in anesthetized humans. Forty patients (four groups of 10 each) with ischemic heart disease and normal ventricular function were anesthetized with diazepam, pancuronium, and N2O in O2. Esmolol was given by continuous infusion in cumulative doses of 1100 micrograms/kg (group 1), 2000 micrograms/kg (group 2), and 2700 micrograms/kg (group 3); a control group received no esmolol. Infusion of esmolol was begun 3 min prior to and ended 4 min after tracheal intubation. All three doses of esmolol significantly (P less than 0.001) attenuated the heart rate responses to intubation. Rate-pressure products were significantly (P less than 0.001) lower in esmolol-treated patients than in controls after intubation, but ST-segment changes compatible with ischemia occurred in one patient in each group. Increases in heart rate were associated with significant increases in plasma norepinephrine levels (r = 0.45, P = 0.02) in the control group, but not in esmolol-treated patients, a demonstration that esmolol antagonizes the beta-adrenergic effects of norepinephrine. The effect of esmolol on heart rate was absent 5 min after cessation of infusion, and plasma levels of esmolol were undetectable in 26 of 30 treated patients 15 min after the termination of esmolol infusion. Esmolol has a rapid onset and short duration of effect. It can be used safely during anesthesia in patients with normal ventricular function to attenuate cardiac response to sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "26": "Patients with hypertension or ischemic heart disease are often treated with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, yet the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade has rarely been studied in relation to anesthesia. We have constructed isoproterenol dose-response curves in four groups of patients under general anesthesia: group I, 27 elderly normotensive patients not receiving drugs; group II, 14 hypertensive patients treated with cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists; group III, 15 hypertensive patients receiving nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists; group IV, 13 patients receiving an infusion of labetalol at 0.15 mg X kg-1 X hr-1. Geometric mean CD25, the dose of isoproterenol required to increase the heart rate by 25 beats/min was 4.4 micrograms (3.5-5.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean) in group I, and 27 micrograms (19-38, 95% CI), 39 micrograms (29-52, 95% CI), and 95 micrograms (62-147, 95% CI) in groups II, III, and IV, respectively. All differences were significant (P less than 0.01), except those between groups II and III (P less than 0.1). No signs of myocardial ischemia and only a few transient arrhythmias were observed. Isoproterenol dose-response curves are a safe means to assess the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade during anesthesia and the postoperative period.", 
    "27": "Long-term beta blockade for perhaps a year or so following discharge after an MI is now of proven value, and for many such patients mortality reductions of about 25% can be achieved. No important differences are clearly apparent among the benefits of different beta blockers, although some are more convenient than others (or have slightly fewer side effects), and it appears that those with appreciable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may confer less benefit. If monitored, the side effects of long-term therapy are not a major problem, as when they occur they are easily reversible by changing the beta blocker or by discontinuation of treatment. By contrast, although very early IV short-term beta blockade can definitely limit infarct size, more reliable information about the effects of such treatment on mortality will not be available until a large trial (ISIS) reports later this year, with data on some thousands of patients entered within less than 4 hours of the onset of pain. Our aim has been not only to review the 65-odd randomized beta blocker trials but also to demonstrate that when many randomized trials have all applied one general approach to treatment, it is often not appropriate to base inference on individual trial results. Although there will usually be important differences from one trial to another (in eligibility, treatment, end-point assessment, and so on), physicians who wish to decide whether to adopt a particular treatment policy should try to make their decision in the light of an overview of all these related randomized trials and not just a few particular trial results. Although most trials are too small to be individually reliable, this defect of size may be rectified by an overview of many trials, as long as appropriate statistical methods are used. Fortunately, robust statistical methods exist--based on direct, unweighted summation of one O-E value from each trial--that are simple for physicians to use and understand yet provide full statistical sensitivity. These methods allow combination of information from different trials while avoiding the unjustified direct comparison of patients in one trial with patients in another. (Moreover, they can be extended of such data that there is no real need for the introduction of any more complex statistical methods that might be more difficult for physicians to trust.) Their robustness, sensitivity, and avoidance of unnecessary complexity make these particular methods an important tool in trial overviews.", 
    "28": "Coronary artery occlusion produces myocardial acidosis, which can be attenuated by propranolol or sotalol. The present study was undertaken to determine which beta adrenoceptors, beta-1 or beta-2, contribute to the ischemic myocardial acidosis. Dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital were used. In the first series of experiments, blood flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery was reduced by an occluder to about one-third of the original flow. Myocardial pH was measured by means of a micro pH electrode inserted into the left anterior descending coronary artery area at the depth of about 8 mm. The myocardial pH decreased from 7.44 to 7.55 to 6.73 to 6.89, 30 min after partial occlusion being the time immediately before an i.v. injection of drugs. Atenolol (1 mg/kg) attenuated significantly the decrease in myocardial pH that had been induced by partial occlusion, whereas IPS 339 (360 micrograms/kg) and ICI 118,551 (300 micrograms/kg) did not. The pH effect of atenolol was confirmed even in the paced heart. In the second series of experiments, the antagonistic action of these drugs on the isoproterenol-induced increase in heart rate and myocardial contractile force and the decrease in diastolic blood pressure was investigated. By this experiment, it was confirmed that atenolol has the beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonistic action, and the IPS 339 and ICI 118,551 have the beta-2 antagonistic action. These results suggest that the activation of beta-1 adrenoceptors contribute to the myocardial acidosis during ischemia.", 
    "29": "The peripheral vascular actions of i.v. administered ASL-7022 were investigated in anesthetized, open-chest dogs and in isolated hindlimbs of normal, acute baroreceptor-denervated and spinal dogs. ASL-7022 decreased diastolic arterial blood pressure in open-chest dogs, an effect which was inhibited by ganglion blockade (hexamethonium bromide, 10 mg/kg i.v.). In hindlimbs from control animals, ASL-7022 produced vasodilation. Propranolol (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) reduced but did not eliminate vasodilation in these preparations but combined beta adrenergic and ganglion blockade converted responses to vasoconstriction. ASL-7022 induced greater vasodilation in hindlimbs from acute baroreceptor-denervated animals than in control animals. In acute baroreceptor-denervated preparations ganglion blockade eliminated vasodilation, propranolol partially blocked vasodilation and combined beta adrenergic and ganglion blockade converted responses to vasoconstriction. In spinal dogs i.v. infusion of low doses of ASL-7022 induced small increases in perfusion pressure; higher doses produced small decreases in perfusion pressure. The compound caused only vasoconstriction in propranolol-pretreated hindlimbs and caused only vasodilation in phentolamine-pretreated hindlimbs. ASL-7022 also dose dependently inhibited vasoconstrictor responses to electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic chain and to exogenously administered norepinephrine. The data suggest that ASL-7022 blocks sympathetic vasoconstriction by either inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system or by inducing postsynaptic alpha adrenoceptor blockade. The compound also produces beta adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation and, under appropriate pharmacological conditions, can be demonstrated to produce alpha adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction.", 
    "30": "From this discussion, several conclusions can be drawn. First, with advancing age there is a decrease in cardiovascular responsiveness and, more specifically, there is a decrease in catecholamine-stimulated chronotropic and inotropic responses. This decreased function has its biochemical correlate in the observation that cyclic AMP levels are decreased in response to isoproterenol infusion in cells or tissues derived from aged organisms. Second, although most work on human circulating cells suggests that beta-adrenergic receptor densities are unchanged, measurements of beta-adrenergic receptor concentrations in various cells from various animals (predominantly rats) have yielded conflicting results. Some of this disparity could be due to the observation that local concentrations of norepinephrine, such as those found intramyocardially, may be very different from those in circulating plasma. Indeed, whereas circulating norepinephrine levels tend to rise with age, the intramyocardial norepinephrine levels tend to fall with senescence. Thus, circulating lymphocytes may or may not be an appropriate model to reflect the catecholamine milieu to which other tissues may be exposed. Accordingly, a note of caution must be entered in terms of extrapolating findings regarding the levels of human lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors and cyclic AMP activity to those found, for example, in the human heart. Furthermore, it is likely that age-related changes in adrenergic function may be the result of changes in coupling of receptors to the adenylate cyclase system, as suggested by Feldman and co-workers, and/or changes in steps distal to cyclase activation, as suggested by Guarnieri and colleagues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "beta-Adrenergic blockade after single, oral doses of labetalol or propranolol was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study by an isoproterenol sensitivity test and handgrip exercise in 10 healthy men. The tests were performed with subjects resting in a supine position. At the doses used, there was no effect on heart rate and blood pressure in either the resting position or in the isometric exercise phase. It is possible that exercise-induced changes in blood pressure and heart rate were reduced by higher vagal tone in this young group tested in the supine position. Isoproterenol increased heart rate and reduced diastolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The dose of isoproterenol at which heart rate increased 25 bpm above the resting rate (CD25; 1.36 +/- 0.18 microgram) was of the order of that at which diastolic blood pressure fell 25 mm Hg from baseline (HD25; 1.07 +/- 0.07 microgram). There was a significant positive correlation between CD25 and HD25 in the 10 subjects. Propranolol and labetalol induced a dose-dependent, parallel shift to the right in the dose-response curves of isoproterenol effects on heart rate and diastolic blood pressure, indicating that both drugs are nonselective, competitive antagonists of beta-adrenergic receptors. On the average, propranolol was 17 and 19 times more potent than labetalol in antagonizing the chronotropic and hypotensive actions of isoproterenol, respectively.", 
    "32": "In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, the effects of intravenous pinacidil, 0.2 mg/kg, were compared with those of hydralazine, 0.3 mg/kg, before and after beta-adrenoceptor blockade in six subjects with hypertension. Both drugs equally reduced total peripheral resistance by about 40%. Pinacidil reduced mean blood pressure by an average of 30 mm Hg, while the reduction after hydralazine was 10 mm Hg. The difference in antihypertensive effect resulted from greater increases in heart rate, cardiac contractility (systolic time intervals), and cardiac index (thermodilution) after hydralazine. These effects after hydralazine could not be fully abolished by beta-blockade, as could the effects after pinacidil. Pinacidil decreased pulmonary blood pressure, whereas there was a slight rise in pulmonary blood pressure after hydralazine. Forearm blood flow (venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography) increased equally after both drugs; thus pinacidil decreased forearm vascular resistance more than hydralazine did. Serum concentrations of both drugs were within the therapeutic range and correlated with the fall in mean blood pressure. Five subjects complained of side effects after hydralazine, but none were reported after pinacidil. Hydralazine increased myocardial oxygen consumption (as estimated from the rate-pressure product) by 35%; there was no change after pinacidil. It is suggested that hydralazine has direct cardiostimulatory effects that limit its antihypertensive effectiveness. These effects increase myocardial oxygen consumption and may be responsible for the common and sometimes severe cardiovascular side effects of hydralazine.", 
    "33": "The effects of atenolol (2-5 mmol/l), sotalol (1-2 mmol/l) and pamatolol (0.1-1 mmol/l), together with N-tertiary butyl phenoxypropanolamines with o-methyl (D-2T: 50-100 mumol/l) m-methyl (D-3T: 50-100 mumol/l) and p-methyl (D-4T: 100-200 mumol/l) group as well as with o,p-methyl groups (D-24T) (50-100 mumol/l) on action potentials (APs) were investigated in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscles. All the drugs in these concentrations produced a concentration-dependent reduction of the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax). The reduction of Vmax in premature APs induced by stimuli interpolated between the basic driving rate of 0.25, 0.1 or 0.027 Hz decayed exponentially during diastolic intervals. The time constants of these decay processes tau for atenolol, pamatolol and sotalol ranged between 260-541 ms, those for D-3T and D-4T between 655-1,166 ms, and D-2T and D-24T between 1,565-1,931 ms. A drug which provided larger tau values caused the reduction of Vmax in a wider range of the frequency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "We examined the effects of antianginal drugs on myocardial uptake of glutamate and release of alanine in patients with chronic effort angina. Thirty-three patients underwent two periods of atrial pacing, the second preceded either by no medication (controls) (n = 8), 0.1 mg/kg i.v. propranolol (n = 8), 30 mg nifedipine sublingually (n = 9) or 0.75 mg glyceryl trinitrate sublingually (n = 8). Before, during, and after each pacing period, coronary sinus blood flow (CSBF), oxygen uptake, and arteriocoronary sinus differences (ACs) of plasma glutamate and alanine were determined. In all groups of patients, arterial alanine concentration fell during the second test. Except for this fall, no metabolic change was seen in controls. Propranolol increased circulating arterial concentration and ACs values of glutamate throughout the test. Nifedipine did not change arterial glutamate concentration but decreased ACs glutamate before and after pacing. Glyceryl trinitrate decreased CSBF, oxygen uptake, and net myocardial uptake of glutamate before pacing despite unchanged arterial level and ACs values. Alterations of myocardial glutamate uptake after drugs may reflect metabolic effects of propranolol primarily exerted on extracardial sites and of nifedipine exerted on the myocardium itself, whereas changes after glyceryl trinitrate seem to be secondary to its cardiac unloading effect. Alterations in myocardial release of alanine were too small and inconsistent to be taken as drug effects.", 
    "35": "The effects of hypoxia on the transmembrane potential of dog Purkinje cells in isolated, superfused fiber bundles pretreated with ouabain were studied. Cells stimulated electrically at 93/min were exposed to ouabain, 2.1 X 10(-7) M, until the magnitude of phase 4 depolarization increased to 7-12 mV. Arrhythmias did not occur. Following a 10-min washout period, hypoxic solution (PO2 = 15-50 mm Hg) was applied for 2-5 min. This caused decreases in maximum diastolic potential, overshoot, rising velocity of phase 0, and duration of the action potential. The slope of depolarization during phase 4 increased markedly. Arrhythmias characterized by escape rhythms or single and multiple bursts of premature excitations occurred in greater than 90% of the experiments. None of these changes was noted when identical levels of hypoxia were applied for a similar period to normal cells. Blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol, 0.3 mg/L, did not alter the response of ouabain-pretreated cells to hypoxia in any manner, ruling out release of endogenous catecholamines as essential for the observed effects. These results suggest that ouabain and hypoxia have a synergistic effect directly on the cells and produce the observed changes in membrane potential. The ventricular arrhythmias observed in digitalized humans or animals that become hypoxemic may result either from the induction of oscillatory after potentials in Purkinje cells causing triggered spontaneous excitations or from reentry of excitation.", 
    "36": "We examined the effects of adrenaline on the noradrenaline release rate and plasma catecholamine levels in the pithed rabbit with electrically stimulated sympathetic outflow (3 Hz). Adrenaline (0.06 micrograms/kg/min) increased the rate of noradrenaline release into the plasma. This increase was prevented by propranolol (0.2 mg/kg + 0.1 mg/kg/h) and probably involves activation of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors. A higher dose of adrenaline (1.0 micrograms/kg/min) significantly reduced the noradrenaline release rate. The reduction was \"reversed\" to a facilitatory effect by phenoxybenzamine (4 mg/kg). Propranolol alone slightly inhibited the noradrenaline release rate. After pretreatment with desipramine (1.0 mg/kg + 0.2 mg/kg/h), the inhibitory effect of propranolol on noradrenaline release was more pronounced and blood pressure was also lowered. However, in rabbits pretreated with captopril (1 mg/kg) in addition to desipramine, the sympathoinhibitory effect of propranolol was not observed. These results suggest that adrenaline can activate either presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors to increase noradrenaline release or, in higher doses, presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors to inhibit noradrenaline release in vivo. The decrease in the noradrenaline release rate produced by propranolol alone may not be due to blockade of facilitatory presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors, but rather to depression of renin secretion. This would decrease angiotensin II formation and hence decrease the presynaptic release-enhancing effect of angiotensin II.", 
    "37": "The serum concentrations and beta-blockade after dermal application of timolol ointment were evaluated in six healthy men (21-31 years old; 74-82 kg). Two patches (25 cm2) containing placebo and either 30 (n = 2) or 60 mg (n = 4) timolol base were randomly applied to the chest for 30 h. Serial serum concentrations of timolol were measured by a radioligand receptor assay. Bicycle ergometry, at a predetermined workload, was performed before and at 3, 8, 24, and 48 h after patch application; mean +/- SD heart rates (beats/min) at these times were 167 +/- 2, 158 +/- 7, 125 +/- 7, 120 +/- 5, and 150 +/- 5 (last 3 values: p less than 0.05 from pretreatment), and beta-blockade was evident in all subjects. Measurable serum concentrations in the therapeutic range were achieved in all subjects. The change in exercise-induced heart rate (y) was closely related to log timolol serum concentration (x) (y = -36 X - 5.3; r = -0.92; p less than 0.001). Based on the amount of timolol in the residual ointment, 50-60% of the original timolol dosage was delivered from the patch. Skin irritation under the patch compared with placebo was minimal. Further studies are warranted to assess the potential clinical utility of transdermal timolol.", 
    "38": "We evaluated the role of chronic cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade in left ventricular (LV) function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Commencing at 4 weeks of age, the animals were injected twice daily (20 mg/kg) with atenolol and were studied at either 10 or 16 weeks of age, to compare the stages of developing and established hypertension in SHR. Both blood pressure and LV mass were attenuated in the treated SHR. Ventricular function-evaluated by increasing preload (infusion of Tyrode solution) and recording indices of peak cardiac output, i.e., cardiac index (CI), stroke index (SI), and acceleration of flow-was similar in SHR and WKY at both 10 and 16 weeks of age. At 10 weeks, peak CI and SI were not significantly different in treated and non-treated SHR. By 16 weeks, however, atenolol treatment was associated with a significant decrease in peak CI (20%) attributable mainly to a lower SI. LV end-diastolic and systolic pressures were not affected by chronic treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. It is concluded that, when prolonged atenolol treatment is initiated during early postnatal life, peak LV function in SHR is compromised.", 
    "39": "The effects of acebutolol, a new investigational cardioselective beta blocker, and propranolol on ventricular arrhythmias were compared in 14 patients with more than 30 premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) per hour. Each patient served as their own control, receiving both drugs and placebo in random sequence and in double-blind fashion, with an intervening one-week, drug-free period. Each drug was given for a two-month period, the maximum acebutolol dosage reaching 600 mg tid and the maximum propranolol dosage 80 mg tid. Seventy-two-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring assessed arrhythmia frequency for each study period. Mean PVC counts did not significantly differ during the two control periods. Acebutolol decreased mean PVC count by 65% (P less than .02), with eight patients exhibiting a 70% or greater decrease. Only three patients exhibited a similar decline with propranolol. The incidence of PVCs was not significantly decreased by propranolol. Acebutolol reduced the number of couplets by 70% (P less than .04), whereas propranolol did not significantly affect couplets. At the dosage of 600 mg tid, acebutolol was well tolerated, effectively suppressed total PVCs and couplets, and appeared to be more effective than propranolol administered at 80 mg tid.", 
    "40": "Radioligand binding techniques have demonstrated the existence of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) binding subtypes: 5-HT2, 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B. These techniques have also indicated that certain drugs appear to show sub-type specificity: 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin(8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT1A agonist; 5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)1-H indole (RU 24969), a 5-HT1B agonist; and ritanserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist. (-)-Propranolol is a 5-HT1 antagonist of uncertain sub-type specificity. An examination has been made in mice and rats of the behavioural and biochemical effects of these drugs to determine whether the binding sites have physiological functions and further characterise the behavioural models. Administration of carbidopa (25 mg kg-1) plus 5-hydroxytryptophan (100 mg kg-1) produced head-twitch behaviour in mice which was antagonized by ritanserin (ED50 = 65 micrograms kg-1) but not (-)-propranolol (20 mg kg-1). 8-OH-DPAT (1-10 mg kg-1 s.c.) and RU 24949 (5 mg kg-1 i.p.) did not produce head-twitch behaviour. 8-OH-DPAT decreased 5-HTP- but not 5-methoxy-N-N-dimethyltryptamine (5 mg kg-1)-induced head-twitch by a (-)-propranolol-insensitive mechanism. Locomotor activity produced in mice by RU 24969 (3 mg kg-1) was antagonized by (-)-propranolol (20 mg kg-1) but not the (+)-isomer. (-)-Propranolol did not antagonize the behaviour induced in rats. In mice, both 8-OH-DPAT and RU 24969 markedly inhibited whole brain 5-HT synthesis and this effect was not antagonized by (-)-propranolol. In rats, 8-OH-DPAT (3 mg kg-1 s.c.) produced all the behavioural changes seen after quipazine (25 mg kg-1). (-)-Propranolol inhibited the behaviour changes produced by both agonists, while ritanserin antagonized the behaviour produced by quipazine but not 8-OH-DPAT. It is concluded, therefore, that the 5-HT1A receptor exists between the 5-HT2 receptor and the behavioural effectors. 8-OH-DPAT (at 20 degrees C ambient temperature) rapidly decreased rat body temperature, an effect antagonized by (-)-propranolol but not ritanserin. Quipazine (at 27 degrees C ambient temperature, but not 20 degrees C) increased body temperature but the effect was not blocked by either antagonist. Ritanserin does not antagonize apomorphine-induced locomotion in either species. 9 We suggest that 5-HT-induced head-twitch behaviour in mice is a useful 5-HT2 receptor model and the temperature change following 8-OH-DPAT injection in rats may be a 5-HT,A model. While (-)- propranolol antagonizes 8-OH-DPAT effects in rat, it does not inhibit 8-OH-DPAT effects in mice, and instead antagonizes RU 24969-induced locomotion. Its status as a 5-HT, antagonist remains illdefined.", 
    "41": "This study was performed to investigate spontaneous variability in VPC frequency, to determine standards for distinguishing antiarrhythmic efficacy from the spontaneous variability, and to compare the effectiveness of disopyramide, mexiletine, aprindine, propranolol, and diltiazem. Holter ECG techniques were used for this study and the population studied consisted of 182 patients having more than 1000 VPCs/day. Forty patients had ischemic heart disease, 52 had miscellaneous heart disease and 90 were free of heart disease (idiopathic VPCs). Circadian variability of VPCs can be divided into 4 types; Type D (VPCs increasing during waking hours), Type DN (small VPC changes between waking and sleeping hours), Type N (VPCs increasing during sleeping hours) and Type Ir (irregularly occurring VPCs). The incidence of Type D, DN, N and Ir was 45%, 29%, 12% and 14%, respectively. VPC frequency in the first and second recordings at a 7 up to 21 day interval was highly reproducible (r = 0.951). The percent reduction in VPC frequency necessary to distinguish true drug response from spontaneous VPC variability, corresponded to 57% with 95% confidence level, and 67% with 99% confidence level. VPCs were reduced by at least 57% in 19 out of 33 patients (58%) with disopyramide, 9 of 15 (60%) with mexiletine, 11 of 18 (61%) with aprindine, 9 of 24 (38%) with propranolol and 8 of 22 (36%) with diltiazem.

    "43": "Effects of substance P (SP) on gastric acid secretion and mucosal blood flow (MBF) were examined in anesthetized Wistar rats. Intravenous infusion of graded doses of SP (5 and 10 nmol/kg/min) had no effects on either the basal gastric acid secretion or on the MBF. When gastric acid secretion was increased by giving a supramaximal dose of bethanechol (10 micrograms/kg/min), a muscarinic parasympathetic stimulant, SP had no effect on the gastric acid secretion but did decrease the MBF. On the other hand, when gastric acid secretion was increased by left cervical vagus nerve stimulation (0.5 mA, 3 Hz, 0.5 msec duration), SP inhibited both acid secretion and MBF, in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effects of SP on the vagally stimulated gastric responses were not affected by pretreatment with phentolamine (5 mg/kg i.m.), propranolol (10 mg/kg i.m.), mepyramine (20 mg/kg i.m.) or indomethacin (30 mg/kg i.v., followed by 4 mg/kg/hr). These findings suggest that SP acts directly on the gastric vascular system and decreases gastric MBF, and that this substance also acts on the parasympathetic neurons in the gastric wall and inhibits the vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion. The inhibitory effects of SP on the gastric acid secretion do not appear to be mediated by adrenergic or by histamine H-1 receptor-, prostaglandin-involved mechanisms.", 
    "44": "In so-called essential hypertension, at least three different subsets of pathophysiologic findings can be identified: mild hypertension in nonobese juvenile subjects characterized by elevated cardiac output, normal peripheral resistance, increased sympathetic activity as measured by norepinephrine and plasma renin activity; hypertension in the elderly with a low cardiac output, often with left ventricular hypertrophy, elevated total peripheral resistance, nephrosclerosis contracted intravascular volume, and low plasma renin activity; and obese hypertensive patients with a high cardiac output, expanded intravascular volume, and a normal total peripheral resistance. Although there is often an overlap among these three entities, antihypertensive treatment can easily be adapted accordingly. A beta-adrenoreceptor blocker is the step-one drug to be used in mild hypertension with an elevated cardiac output. The drug's negative inotropic and chronotropic properties will bring the elevated cardiac output and heart rate back to normal. In the elderly hypertensive patient, an arteriolar and venous vasodilator, such as an antiadrenergic agent, slow channel calcium blocker, or a converting enzyme inhibitor, will lower total peripheral resistance and unburden the left ventricle. In the obese patient and also in most black subjects, the first-step antihypertensive agent remains a thiazide diuretic. Labetalol, an agent with both beta- and alpha-adrenoreceptor properties, shows promise for the treatment of hypertension in the young as well as in the older patient. It seems to be the agent of choice in patients with established essential hypertension who are concomitantly suffering from coronary artery disease.",

Course is fatal at five months old. On the occasion of this probable intoxication, a brief recall about pharmacology and physiopathology of transplacental passage of B- during pregnancy is done. Then, are enumerated the experimental repercussion of B blockers and their more often theoretical than real undesirable effects, on the fetus. Sotalol is possibly a B-specially aggressive, when it is prescribed abusively, on account of its excellent diffusibility and of its high tissular impregnation.", 
    "46": "Acute assays were carried out using broiler chickens in which a reentry catheter had previously been placed chronically in the main pancreatic duct. Samples of pancreatic juice were collected after manoeuvres of blockage and stimulation with different neurotransmitters and blocking agents, both cholinergic and adrenergic, as well as electrical stimulation of the left vagosympathetic trunk. Stimulation of the vagus nerve induced a marked increase in the pancreatic flow but with no changes in the enzyme content. Acetylcholine was seen to cause a slight but significant increase in pancreatic flow and a non-significant increase in amylase activity. The drop in the flow of pancreatic juice in response to adrenaline was not very sensitive to adrenergic blockers. The effect of adrenaline on pancreatic secretion cannot be attributed to vascular changes.", 
    "47": "Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of compound 48/80 (3.0 mg/kg) to conscious rats produced a time-dependent long-lasting increase of plasma renin activity (PRA). A dose-related increase of the hematocrit was also observed after injection of compound 48/80. The onset of the hematocrit increase preceded that of PRA increase. Pretreatment with a dose of more than 20 mg/kg of histamine H1-receptor antagonists such as tripelennamine or diphenhydramine prior to the injection of compound 48/80 (3.0 mg/kg s.c.) attenuated or abolished the effects of compound 48/80 on PRA, hematocrit and plasma extravasation. Pretreatment with cimetidine (histamine H2-receptor antagonist, 40 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect on these plasma variables. The increase of PRA caused by s.c. administration of compound 48/80 was not affected by the pretreatment with propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg i.p.), which completely inhibited the isoproterenol (0.5 mg/kg s.c.)-induced PRA increase. Administration of compound 48/80 did not induce a significant PRA increase in the nephrectomized rats although the increase of hematocrit following s.c. administration of compound 48/80 persisted despite the absence of kidneys. S.c. administration of compound 48/80 (3.0 mg/kg) led to a significant decrease of histamine content at the site of injection and to a significant increase in plasma histamine concentration without affecting arterial blood pressure. The present data suggest that s.c. administration of compound 48/80 stimulates the release of histamine from cutaneous mast cells, which cause an increase in vascular permeability to plasma protein via the stimulation of histamine H1-receptors, then leads to hypovolemia. The resulting hypovolemia may directly stimulate the juxtraglomerular cells of the kidney to release renin.", 
    "48": "Preganglionic sympathetic nerve activity, blood pressure, heart rate and femoral arterial conductance were recorded in anaesthetised, paralysed cats. Cumulative dose (0.01-1 mg kg-1) response curves were constructed for the alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine, WY 26392 and idazoxan. Low doses of these drugs caused increases in preganglionic sympathetic nerve activity, heart rate and mean blood pressure, and decreases in femoral arterial conductance. In contrast, at the highest dose, all three drugs caused falls in mean blood pressure, decreases in heart rate and no further increases in preganglionic sympathetic nerve activity. The decreases in heart rate appeared to be due to increases in vagal tone since they were reversed by atropine methonitrate. These results demonstrate that low doses of alpha 2 adrenoceptors antagonists increase central sympathetic tone and blood pressure and are consistent with the hypothesis that central alpha 2 adrenoceptors are under a tonic input which is inhibitory to central sympathetic tone.", 
    "49": "Brain tissues from aged rats have an impaired ability to increase beta-adrenergic receptors in response to reduced noradrenergic input, but can down-regulate these receptors in response to repeated administration of desmethylimipramine (DMI). In this study we compared the ability of brain tissues from young (3-month) and aged (20- to 26-month) rats to restore their density of beta-adrenergic receptors following desmethylimipramine (DMI)-induced receptor subsensitivity. Either DMI or saline was administered i.p. twice daily for 7 days to groups of young and aged rats. At various times after drug administration [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding was determined in homogenates of pineal gland and cerebral cortex. Four hours after the last dose of DMI there was a decrease in DHA binding in both brain areas of young and aged rats. In young rats DHA binding in these tissues returned to control levels by 2 days after DMI administration. In contrast, in aged rats it took 8 and 16 days for DHA binding to recover in cerebrum and pineal, respectively. The concentration and half-life for the disappearance of DMI from serum and cerebrum were significantly greater in aged rats than in young rats, but the differences do not entirely explain the delayed recovery of beta-receptors in the aged rats. The results suggest that beta-adrenergic receptors of brain tissues from aged rats cannot recover from beta-receptor subsensitivity as readily as those from young rats. If this recovery process requires the synthesis of new receptors, then this synthetic mechanism may be impaired with age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We have observed \"paradoxical\" myocardial ischemia in ten patients with refractory angina (seven receiving combined beta-blocker and nitrate therapy, and three receiving nitrate treatment alone) in whom nifedipine (mean dosage, 92 mg/day; range, 60 to 120 mg/day) induced a decrease in blood pressure, angina pectoris (10/10 patients), and ischemic ECG changes (7/10 patients). These ten patients, all of whom regularly reported angina within 20 to 30 minutes of nifedipine ingestion, were prospectively studied before and after usual nifedipine dose administration, while blood pressures, heart rate, and ECGs were recorded. Mean systolic BP fell from 109 to 94 mm Hg after nifedipine (P less than .001, paired t test); mean heart rate increased from 64 to 68 beats per minute (P less than .05); seven patients developed transient ECG changes (five with ST-T wave depression and two with ST-T wave elevation) during the hypotensive period.

    "51": "Cytochalasin D altered the kinetics of peroxidase and radiolabeled protein discharge from rat exorbital lacrimal glands in vitro, in response to various secretagogues. The changes were different with each inducer. The discharge due to isoproterenol was immediately inhibited by 95%; the discharge evoked by noradrenaline via alpha-adrenergic receptors was progressively reduced and was inhibited by 50% after 30 min, whereas that evoked by carbachol was not influenced during the initial discharge period and was diminished by only 30% after 30 min. When calcium was removed from the incubation medium, the secretory responses were lowered and the inhibitory effect of cytochalasin D was still observed. The rate of protein discharge inhibition was related to the dose and was maximal with 2 X 10(-6) M cytochalasin D when the discharge resulted from cholinergic, alpha- or beta-adrenergic or dibutyryl cAMP stimulation. Cytochalasin D did not impair cellular energetics nor other stimulations induced through muscarinic or adrenergic receptors. Cytochalasin D effects could be related to interaction with actin, leading to the inhibition of the release of proteins into the incubation medium following the activation of the adrenergic system.", 
    "52": "Rat saliva contains a cobalamin-binding protein that binds cobalamin as well as cobinamide. The protein binds cobalamin with an affinity constant of 8 X 10(10) l X mol-1, and it binds cobalamin over a more narrow pH range (pH 7.5-10) than does human haptocorrin. It has a Stokes radius of 2.45 nm as compared to the Stokes radius of 4.50 nm for human haptocorrin. Upon isoelectricfocusing it dissociates into four strong bands with pI between 7 and 8, while human haptocorrin dissociates into acid isoproteins. Since human haptocorrin binds to concanavalin A while rat haptocorrin does not, we suggest that rat haptocorrin lacks carbohydrate. The substance concentration of rat saliva haptocorrin is 0.04-12.9 nmol X l-1 (median 7.5 nmol X l-1, n = 9) for control animals. After stimulation with isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agent, the substance concentration is 46.4-96.6 nmol X l-1 (median 69.7 nmol X l-1, n = 8). Immunohistochemical studies show haptocorrin in the secretory acini of the submandibular and parotid glands of the rat. In the human submandibular gland, the protein is detected both in the mucous secretory acini and in the intercalated ducts.", 
    "53": "In two different medical centers, a total of 24 normal individuals (mean age, 31 years) participated in a double-masked, three-way crossover single-instillation comparison of betaxolol 1%, timolol 0.5%, and placebo. After each ocular treatment, cardiovascular characteristics were measured during ten-minute treadmill exercise periods. No significant differences in heart rate or double product (heart rate X systolic pressure) were seen between treatment with betaxolol and administration of placebo. However, when the same subjects were treated with timolol, they demonstrated significant (P less than .05) reductions in these values at various measurement times compared with placebo and betaxolol treatments. No significant differences in mean arterial pressure were detected after any of the treatments.", 
    "54": "The electrophysiologic effects of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine and the modification of these effects by atropine, propranolol, vagotomy, dipyridamole and aminophylline were studied in a canine model. Both ATP and adenosine exerted transient, dose-dependent negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, respectively. At all doses tested, the effects of ATP were more pronounced. Treatment with either atropine or propranolol plus bilateral cervical vagotomy attenuated the effects of ATP but not of adenosine. In the presence of propranolol plus vagotomy, both the negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects of ATP and adenosine were enhanced and attenuated in a similar manner by dipyridamole and aminophylline. Thus, when ATP and adenosine are injected rapidly into the right atrium of the intact canine heart, vagal involvement in the mechanism of action of ATP but not of adenosine is mainly responsible for the difference in the magnitude of the electrophysiologic effects of these 2 compounds, and only a small part of the electrophysiologic effects of ATP are the result of its degradation to adenosine.", 
    "55": "Incubation of rat adipocytes with the same range of noradrenaline concentrations that stimulate lipolysis caused a rapid and stable decrease in the activity of fatty acyl-CoA synthetase. Corticotropin, glucagon and dibutyryl cyclic AMP also decreased the activity of the enzyme. The effect of noradrenaline was apparent over a wide range of concentrations for the three substrates of the enzyme. A novel fluorescence assay of fatty acyl-CoA synthetase using (1,N6-etheno)-CoA is described. The effect of noradrenaline was not abolished by inclusion of albumin in homogenization buffers, persisted through subcellular fractionation and isolation of microsomes (microsomal fractions) and even survived treatment of microsomes with Triton X-100. The effect of noradrenaline was rapidly reversed within cells by the subsequent addition of insulin or propranolol. The inclusion of fluoride in homogenization buffers did not alter the observed effect of noradrenaline. Additions of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase to adipocyte microsomes caused considerable phosphorylation of microsomal protein by [gamma-32P]ATP, but did not affect the activity of fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.", 
    "56": "Estrogen has been shown to enhance the beta-adrenergic-receptor sites in rabbit lung tissue. Because of the possible relationship beta-adrenergic receptor and surfactant maturation, we studied the electron microscopic changes in type II cells of lung tissue of control as well as estrogen-treated developing rat fetuses. The amniotic sacs of 31 gravid rats, at day 15 to 21 of a 22-day pregnancy, were injected with either estradiol phosphate or saline solution or were not injected. The contralateral horn pregnancies acted as controls. In the noninjected and saline solution-injected controls multilamellar bodies started to be visible on day 18 and increased in number as well as size on days 18 and 19. On day 20, the process of release of the phospholipids into the alveolar cavities became apparent. After 48 hours of exposure to estradiol, there was a marked enhancement of the development of lamellar bodies, which were visible on day 17. The increase was both in number and in complexity. In the estradiol-injected animals, the release of the contents of the lamellar bodies into the alveolar cavity started 1 to 2 days earlier than in the control animals. There is an indication that propranolol injection decreases both the formation and the release of the phospholipids. We conclude that estrogen stimulates both the formation and the release of surface-active phospholipids in rat fetal lung tissue.", 
    "57": "Tritium-labeled dihydroalprenolol was used to quantify beta-adrenergic-receptor sites in day 28 fetal rabbit lung tissue. Each of the amniotic sacs of pregnant New Zealand White rabbits on day 26 of gestation was injected in vivo with estrogen (estradiol phosphate, 1.6 micrograms) in one horn and normal saline solution in the contralateral one. The animals were put to death 48 hours later and the fetal lung tissues were assayed. Estrogen increased the number of beta-adrenergic-receptor sites in the treatment group compared to the control group (216 versus 163 fmol/mg of protein, p less than 0.02 by paired t test). In the presence of estrogen, beta-adrenergic-receptor activity is enhanced in the preterm fetal rabbit. This effect may be implicated in the beta-adrenergic mediation of phospholipid synthesis and release in fetal alveolar cells.", 
    "58": "Addition of norepinephrine to primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes stimulates the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in a dose-dependent manner. This effect has been observed in serum-free medium containing epidermal growth factor and insulin. Stimulation of DNA synthesis by norepinephrine was strongly antagonized by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin but not by an alpha 2 antagonist or by a beta-adrenergic blocker. The beta agonist isoproterenol did not stimulate significant DNA synthesis. These results indicate that catecholamines interact with the alpha 1 adrenoreceptor to stimulate DNA synthesis in hepatocytes. Since alpha 1 receptors are present in most cells, this receptor may be important in cell growth regulation.", 
    "59": "Inhibition of rat liver lysosomal phospholipases is one of the main events that leads to accumulation of tissue phospholipids during drug-induced phospholipidosis. Drug inhibition of lysosomal phospholipase A may occur by direct effects of drugs on the enzyme (or substrate) or by drug-induced increases in intralysosomal pH. Although beta-adrenoceptor blockers have not been reported to cause lipid storage, they do inhibit lysosomal phospholipase A. To investigate the structural requirements for drug inhibition, we studied the effects of six beta-adrenoceptor blockers on purified rat liver lysosomal phospholipase A1. The agents studied include: propranolol, timolol, metoprolol, practolol, atenolol and the combined alpha and beta adrenoceptor blocking agent, labetalol. The drugs varied by two logs in their abilities to inhibit phospholipase A1 activity. The relative inhibitory potencies were propranolol greater than labetalol much greater than timolol greater than metoprolol much greater than practolol greater than atenolol. Our studies identify drug hydrophobicity as a key determinant for phospholipase A1 inhibition. A strong negative correlation was noted between the octanol/water partition coefficients and IC50 for phospholipase inhibition (r = -0.91). The ability of propranolol to inhibit phospholipase A1 was identical for the d, l and the d and l stereoisomers.", 
    "60": "In recent research a new series of specific drugs, one of which is guanabenz (GBZ, 2,6(dichlorobenzyliden)-aminoguanidine) has been introduced into the clinical treatment of centrally mediated hypertension. Guanabenz (GBZ) is considered to be among the most specific alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, acting similarly to clonidine by decreasing the sympathetic outflow from the brain to the peripheral circulatory system. In the present report we show that GBZ displays a significant affinity for beta-adrenoceptors. In displacement studies of the iodinated beta-antagonist [125I]cyanopindolol (CYP) from turkey erythrocyte membranes, the dissociation constant of GBZ was 3.8 microM. Inhibition of the (-) epinephrine induced adenylate cyclase activity by GBZ is competitive, with an apparent dissociation constant of 30 microM. A similar value was obtained by studies of GBZ's effect on the (-) epinephrine-induced [3H]cAMP accumulation in intact turkey erythrocytes. In view of its unexpected affinity for beta-adrenoceptors, we examined the three-dimensional structure of crystalline GBZ. In these studies substantial differences between clonidine and GBZ were observed, despite their strong structural resemblance. These dissimilarities (angle of rotation phi = 39.7 degrees as compared to 76 degrees in clonidine, and the rotational restriction of clonidine as compared to the greater mobility in rotation of GBZ) could explain the difference of specificity between these two compounds.", 
    "61": "Infarction was produced in male albino rats by left coronary artery ligation and infarct size was measured using NBT staining. Imidazole significantly decreased the myocardial infarct. The effect did not appear to be mediated through the thromboxane synthetase inhibitory property of imidazole because dazoxiben (a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor) failed to produce a similar effect. Propranolol pretreatment decreased the infarct size but treatment after coronary ligation increased it. Reserpine treatment did not alter the infarct size significantly.", 
    "62": "In isolated right atrial and stilboestrol-pretreated uterine preparations from both guinea-pigs and rats, pindolol elicited propranolol-sensitive positive chronotropic and smooth muscle relaxant actions. Although the pD2 values for pindolol (8.4-9.2) and (-)-isoprenaline (ISO, 8.4-8.7) fell within the same range in these preparations, the maximum responses to pindolol were less than 15% of those to the catecholamine. Thus, pindolol did not display any selectivity for agonistic actions at beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors. In uteri taken from progesterone-pretreated rats, the pD2 value for (-)-isoprenaline was 9.5 and that of pindolol 8.5. In these preparations the maximal relaxant effect of pindolol (approximately 50% Emax ISO) was greater than that found in oestrogen-pretreated uteri. Thus, it appears that the maximal response of pindolol in vitro can be related to the pD2 value for (-)-isoprenaline. In anesthetized cats, intravenous pindolol elicited non-beta-adrenoceptor-mediated increases in heart rate and decreases in soleus muscle contractility. The mechanism(s) underlying the latter actions are unknown.", 
    "63": "The present study investigated the possible involvement of central noradrenergic neurons in mediating the excitatory effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on the acoustic startle response in rats. Experiment 1 assessed the effects of intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of adrenergic antagonists on apomorphine-enhanced startle. The excitation of startle produced by apomorphine (1.0-3.0 mg/kg i.p.) was blocked by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists prazosin (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) and WB-4101 (1.0 mg/kg). Prazosin was very potent in this regard, having an ED50 of 0.03 mg/kg. Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol (20 mg/kg) or blockade of peripheral alpha-adrenergic receptors with phentolamine (10 mg/kg) failed to alter the effect of apomorphine. Prazosin did not block the enhancement of startle produced by other drugs (5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, strychnine), nor did it alter the entry of apomorphine into the brain. The alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists piperoxane (0.03 mg/kg), yohimbine (0.03 mg/kg) or RX781094 (0.07 mg/kg) markedly potentiated apomorphine excitation. These data indicated that specific blockade of central alpha 1-adrenergic receptors prevents apomorphine-enhanced startle. In contrast to the effects of alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists, Experiment 2 found that other drugs that produce an acute (clonidine, 0.040 mg/kg) or chronic (intraventricular 6-hydroxydopamine, 2 X 200 micrograms; DSP4, 50 mg/kg i.p.) disruption of noradrenergic transmission failed to affect apomorphine excitation. Thus, the ability of alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists to block apomorphine's excitation of startle cannot be explained by a simple dopamine-norepinephrine interaction. Alternative hypothesis are discussed.", 
    "64": "The binding of three adrenergic ligands ([3H]prazosin, [3H]clonidine, [3H]dihydroalprenolol) was studied in the frontal cortex of human brain. alpha 1-Receptors, labeled by [3H]prazosin, predominated. [3H]Clonidine bound to two classes of sites, one of high affinity and one of low affinity. Guanosine triphosphate appeared to lower the affinity of [3H]clonidine for its receptor. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol bound to three classes of sites: the beta 1-receptor, the beta 2-receptor and a receptor with low affinity which represented about 40% of the total binding, but which was probably a non-specific site; the beta 1/beta 2 ratio was 1/2.", 
    "65": "Mediobasal hypothalamus tissue (MBH) from adult male rats was incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium (KRB). KRB was changed at 15 min intervals and the concentration of immunoreactive beta-endorphin (beta-ENDi) in the medium was measured by radioimmunoassay. Incubation of MBH tissue in normal KRB resulted in a constant release rate of beta-ENDi of approximately 1% of the tissue content per h. KRB containing 45 mM K+ causes a two fold increase in the release rate of beta-ENDi which was Ca2+ dependent. Dopamine (0.01-1.0 microM) inhibits both the spontaneous and the K+-stimulated release of beta-ENDi in a dose related manner. The dopamine receptor blocking agent haloperidol prevents this inhibitory effect of dopamine. The selective D-1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 does not affect the release rate of beta-ENDi; whereas the selective D-2 receptor agonist LY 141865 inhibits both the spontaneous and K+-stimulated release of beta-ENDi. The effects of LY 141865 can be blocked by (-)-sulpiride, a selective D-2 receptor antagonist. Norepinephrine only weakly inhibits the K+-stimulated release of beta-ENDi, an effect that can be blocked by haloperidol but not by the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine. At concentrations tested (0.01-1.0 microM), isoproterenol, 5-hydroxytryptamine, carbachol and 8-Br-cAMP (1.0 microM) do not affect beta-ENDi release. It is concluded that dopamine can inhibit the release of beta-ENDi from hypothalamic neurons via a D-2 receptor mechanism.", 
    "66": "The mechanisms of tachycardia in hyperthyroidism were investigated by means of Holter recordings of heart rate in 45 patients, 33 of whom had sinus rhythm and were left untreated. In the remaining 12 patients, recordings were taken after 3 days of treatment with either propranolol (120 mg/day; 6 patients) or pindolol (15 mg/day; 6 patients). Propranolol is a beta-blocker devoid of intrinsic sympathetic activity whereas pindolol possesses such activity. Changes in heart rate under the influence of each of these drugs were compared with those observed in 96 controls similarly treated. The difference in baseline heart rare between day and night was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in patients with hyperthyroidism (17 +/- 1 QRS/min) than in controls (13 +/- 1 QRS/min). Day and night heart rates were increased by pindolol, the increase in night heart rate being significantly greater (p less than 0.05) in patients with hyperthyroidism (23.4 +/- 4.9%) than in controls (11.6 +/- 2.6%). These results suggest that sinus tachycardia in hyperthyroidism is related to an increase in the number of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors. They also indicate that thyrotoxicosis should not be treated with beta-blockers possessing intrinsic sympathetic activity.", 
    "67": "Although commonly prescribed for hypertension, nonpharmacologic treatments have, at best, a minor adjunctive role to play. Current Canadian recommendations call for either a diuretic or beta blocker. If the diastolic blood pressure does not fall below 90 mmHg, a beta blocker or diuretic, respectively, should be added. Medications should be carefully adjusted until the BP is well controlled without adverse effects. About one-third of patients will experience side effects from a medication, but these often subside with time or can be overcome by switching medications. In the long run, antihypertensive therapy does much more good than harm for most patients. Optimizing the cost/benefit ratio for individual patients is the most important challenge.", 
    "68": "The authors report one case of biventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a 23 year old female patient with severe localized obstruction of the right ventricle (105 mm Hg gradient, almost complete angiographic disappearance of the middle and apical portions of the right ventricle during systole). Echocardiography, hemodynamic findings, and angiography demonstrated nonobstructive involvement of the left ventricle. Among other family members, only her father was noted to have minimal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A favorable response to therapy was obtained over 14 months with 320 mg of propranolol given daily (disappearance of palpitations and ventricular tachycardia which had previously been noted on a continuous 24 hour recording before treatment). Other very rare similar cases in the literature are analyzed. It is not possible to distinguish these cases from those with predominantly left ventricular involvement by clinical and radiological findings alone. However, the ECG can often demonstrate right ventricular involvement (right ventricular hypertrophy and/or right bundle branch block). Lastly, it appears that biventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathies in young patients can initially be localized to only the right ventricle.", 
    "69": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are usually administered in 2 or 3 different concentrations in the treatment of glaucoma. Arguments for varying the dose are dose-dependent decompression, the onset of symptoms similar to tachyphylaxis, and the incidence of systemic side-effects which may be influenced by modification of the dose. The present author's results, however, appear to contradict these arguments; therefore, this paper discusses whether there is any advantage to be gained by administering beta blockers in different concentrations.", 
    "70": "The effects of verapamil on the chronotropic response to vagal stimulation in young pigs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally) was evaluated. After bilateral vagotomy, the administration of verapamil (loading dose of 100 micrograms/kg, followed by 2 micrograms/kg/min infusion) resulted in a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure. Cardiac frequency responses to vagal stimulation were obtained by stimulating the distal end of the right vagus nerve at selected frequencies (5, 10, 15, and 20 Hz) with supramaximal voltage (10 to 15 V) and constant duration (2 ms). The HR was measured after 15 s at each level of stimulation. The slopes of decrease in HR to the frequency of vagal stimulation were significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced after verapamil as compared with its controls. After atropine (0.5 mg/kg), the vagally induced tachycardia was partially attenuated by verapamil, but was completely eliminated by beta blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg). These findings indicated that verapamil may influence the parasympathetic control of the heart in young pigs.", 
    "71": "The acute corneal anaesthetic potency of 0.5% pindolol eye drops was compared with that of 2% lidocaine and placebo solutions in 10 rabbits. Pindolol produced a rapid-onset anaesthetic effect similar to that of lidocaine, whereas placebo drops were without effect. The chronic effect of 0.25% pindolol, 0.5% timolol and placebo eye drops on corneal sensitivity were evaluated weekly for 1 month in rabbits. None of the solutions affected the basal corneal sensitivity, but pindolol eye drops caused a slight corneal anaesthesia, when tested at 10 min after application, especially during the first weeks of therapy. The effect of timolol was qualitatively similar, but much weaker and not statistically significant.", 
    "72": "Topical unilateral application of timolol reduces the IOP (intraocular pressure) of both the treated and the untreated eye. For this reason, a cental mechanism of action, in addition to the local one, has been suggested for the reduction of IOP by this drug. In this study timolol concentrations in the iris-ciliary body of the treated and untreated rabbit eyes were compared with pharmacologically active in vitro timolol concentrations. The drug concentration in the untreated eye too was found to be high enough to exert a local action.", 
    "73": "In order to study left ventricular contraction parameters of L-penbutolol and D-penbutolol (isopenbutolol) we evaluated TM-echocardiograms of 12 healthy volunteers at 30 and 60 minute intervals for 8 hours after oral administration of 40 mg L- and D-penbutolol and placebo. Three different observers determined end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions, left ventricular shortening fraction (SF) as well as mean-, peak- and rate corrected circumferential fiber shortening (VCF) and calculated at each measuring point the difference from the control value (Delta). L-penbutolol demonstrated a typical beta-blocking effect with a significant (p less than 0.001) decrease of systolic (11.1 +/- 8.6 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (6.7 +/- 4.6 mm Hg) and heart rate (10.0 +/- 7.4 bpm) as well as a significant (p less than 0.001) negative inotropic effect expressed by a decrease of SF (6.5 +/- 4.2%) and VCF-mean (0.40 +/- 0.15 circ/s), VCF-peak (1.04 +/- 0.61 circ/s) and rate corrected VCF (0.28 +/- 0.08 circ/s). However, we saw a similar but less distinct negative inotropic and chronotropic effect of D-penbutolol as compared to placebo. HR decreased by 5.3 +/- 6.2 bpm (p less than 0.001), SF decreased maximally by 5.0 +/- 3.2% (p less than 0.05), VCF-mean by 0.27 +/- 0.08 circ/s (p less than 0.001), VCF-peak by 0.71 +/- 0.31 circ/s (p less than 0.001) and rate corrected VCF by 0.22 +/- 0.04 circ/s (p less than 0.001). By means of TM echocardiography it was therefore possible to document a strong beta-blocking effect of L-penbutolol as well as a negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effect by the D-isomer of penbutolol.", 
    "74": "The beta-blocker propranolol was studied for its effects on basal pulmonary functions and on bronchoconstrictor responses to methacholine and histamine in mechanically ventilated guinea pigs and rats. Using doses that blocked the antibronchoconstrictor (bronchodilator) effects of the beta 2-agonist salbutamol, propranolol had no measurable effect on basal airway resistance and dynamic lung compliance in both guinea pigs and rats. However, bronchoconstrictor responses to methacholine and histamine were augmented by propranolol in guinea pigs. In contrast, propranolol did not change bronchoconstrictor responses to methacholine in rats. These results are discussed in terms of the functional role of pulmonary beta-receptors in guinea pigs and rats.", 
    "75": "To assess the influence of chronic atenolol therapy on the cardiovascular responses to isometric exercise, we evaluated the behavior of blood pressure, heart rate and double product in 75 hypertensive patients treated with atenolol 100 mg once daily for 6 months. During the 1st month of treatment, both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increases rose more than before treatment. SBP increase to handgrip became lower than before treatment on the 2nd months of therapy (p less than 0.05) and fell even more afterwards (p less than 0.01 on the 6th month). On the contrary, DBP increase subsequently steadied on levels not significantly different from those before treatment. Double product increase was inferior to that recorded before atenolol administration; the difference became significant after 2 months and reached its apex after 6 months of treatment. The conclusion was that chronic atenolol therapy affected some cardiovascular responses to handgrip although to a different extent depending on treatment length; it would seem sensible to pay attention to how long a patient has been on beta-blocker when evaluating the response to isometric exercise.", 
    "76": "The drugs used were methamphetamine, reserpine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, propranolol, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, pilocarpine and atropine. Each drug except for reserpine (days 7-13 and 14-19 of gestation) was administered subcutaneously to dams from day 7 to 19 of gestation. The body weight gain of dams receiving reserpine (days 7-13) and haloperidol was inhibited during the gestation period. Two out of 9 dams receiving methamphetamine died on day 21 of gestation period; However, no effect was observed in dams given other drugs. The body weight gain of pups was inhibited in methamphetamine and haloperidol treated groups. The mortality of pups was comparable in all groups. The behavioral development of the righting reflex, cliff drop avoidance and negative geotaxis of pups given reserpine (days 7-13), norepinephrine, chlorpromazine and haloperidol was significantly retarded in comparison with that of control pups. The spontaneous motor activity of pups measured by Animex was increased in reserpine (days 7-13) and epinephrine treated groups and decreased in the chlorpromazine treated group on day 28 postpartum, but comparable in all groups on day 56 postpartum. The conditioned avoidance responses using the shuttle box revealed deficits of avoidance learning of pups in the reserpine (days 7-13), norepinephrine and atropine treated groups. These findings suggest that the prenatal exposure to drugs acting on the autonomic nervous system may produce adverse effects on the behavioral development of pups; However, the adverse effects were more apparent by postnatal exposure than by prenatal exposure."
