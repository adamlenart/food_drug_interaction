Antihypertensive combination therapy was used in approximately half of the elderly. No significant difference in BP was found in elderly hypertensives treated either with monotherapy or combination therapy. As regards mono- and overall drug utilization, beta-blockers were the most frequently prescribed drugs in hypertensives, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in diabetic hypertensives. Diuretics and calcium channel blockers, the preferred antihypertensives for the elderly, were less often prescribed, particularly in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.",

    "8": "This study examines the action of the beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A [3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1,S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronapth-1-ylamino]-2S-2-propanoloxalate] at cloned mouse beta(3)-adrenoceptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1-beta(3)) or endogenously expressed in 3T3-F442A adipocytes or ileum. SR59230A displayed partial agonist properties compared with the beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist CL316243 [(R,R)-5-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino]-propyl]1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate] in CHO-K1-beta(3) with the intrinsic activity increasing with the level of receptor expression. Functional affinity values for SR59230A at each level of receptor expression were in agreement with pK(I) values determined by binding. In cytosensor microphysiometer studies, SR59230A was a full agonist for increases in extracellular acidification rates (ECARs) at all levels of receptor expression, and antagonist actions were measurable only in medium- or low-expressing cells. In 3T3-F442A adipocytes, SR59230A antagonized CL316243-mediated increases of cAMP and had no agonist actions. However, in the cytosensor micro-physiometer, SR59230A (acting via beta(3)-adrenoceptors) was an agonist with an intrinsic activity greater than CL316243. In mouse ileum, SR59230A relaxed smooth muscle, although concentration-response curves were biphasic. Relaxant effects were produced by concentrations that did not affect cAMP levels. Differences in tissue responses to SR59230A were not caused by major differences in expression of Galphas. ECAR responses were not affected by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin, indicating that signaling did not involve Gi. Therefore, SR59230A displays agonist and antagonist actions at the mouse beta(3)-adrenoceptor. Because SR59230A only antagonized accumulation of cAMP in 3T3-F442A adipocytes yet in the same cells was an agonist for ECAR, cAMP-independent signaling pathways must mediate part of the agonist actions in the microphysiometer.", 
    "9": "Migraine is a common, debilitating condition affecting up to 15% of the population. The ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus relays trigeminal sensory input to the primary somatosensory cortex. In vivo electrophysiological recordings were made from the cell bodies of thalamocortical relay neurons in rats. We investigated whether microiontophoretic ejection of beta antagonists could inhibit thalamocortical activity in response to superior sagittal sinus (SSS) stimulation. We also studied 'postsynaptic' actions of these drugs through their modulatory actions on L-glutamate-evoked third order neuronal firing. Propranolol inhibited responses to SSS stimulation (P < 0.001) and L-glutamate ejection (P < 0.001). This was due to an action on beta receptors as it could be partially reversed by co-ejection of isoproterenol (SSS, P = 0.02; L-glutamate, P = 0.006). Serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonism did not contribute to propranolol's action since the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, (S)-WAY 100135 (P = 0.2), and the 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist, GR127935 (P = 0.6), did not affect L-glutamate-evoked neuronal firing. Atenolol inhibited both responses (SSS, P = 0.003; L-glutamate, P < 0.001). The beta2 antagonist ICI 118,551 had no effect (SSS, P = 0.9; L-glutamate, P = 0.4), nor did the beta2 agonist procaterol (SSS, P = 0.6; L-glutamate, P = 0.9). SR 59230A (beta3 antagonist) also produced no significant inhibition (SSS, P = 0.7; L-glutamate, P = 0.2), indicating an inhibitory role for beta1 antagonists only. beta Blockers therefore may exert some of their therapeutic effects in migraine through beta1 adrenoceptor antagonist actions in the thalamus. Thalamic involvement in migraine is attractive given the complex and widespread nature of the sensory disturbance.",

The Tei index decreased significantly from 0.87 +/- 0.17 to 0.53 +/- 0.29 (p <0.03). Conversely, the ejection fraction and transmitral Doppler flow analysis did not show significant improvement, despite a trend toward the amelioration of the ejection fraction, the E-/A-wave ratio, and atrial contribution.

    "35": "For many patients optimal perioperative care may require little or no additional medical management beyond that given by the anaesthetist and surgeon. However, the continued existence of a group of surgical patients at high risk for morbidity and mortality indicates an ongoing need to identify such patients and deliver optimal care throughout the perioperative period. A group of patients exists in whom the risk for death and serious complications after major surgery is in excess of 20%. The risk is related mainly to the patient's preoperative physiological condition and, in particular, the cardiovascular and respiratory reserves. Cardiovascular management of the high-risk surgical patient is of particular importance. Once the medical management of underlying disease has been optimized, two principal areas remain: the use of haemodynamic goals to guide fluid and inotropic therapy, and perioperative beta blockade. A number of studies have shown that the use of goal-directed haemodynamic therapy during the perioperative period can result in large reductions in morbidity and mortality. Some patients may also benefit from perioperative beta blockade, which in selected patients has also been shown to result in significant mortality reductions. In this review a pragmatic approach to perioperative management is described, giving guidance on the identification of the high-risk patient and on the use of goal-directed haemodynamic therapy and beta blockade.", 
    "36": "Prophylactic drug trials in migraine are long-lasting and expensive and require long-term toxicology information. A human migraine model would therefore be helpful in testing new drugs. Immediate headache and delayed migraine after glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) has been well characterized. We have recently shown that sodium valproate has prophylactic effect in the GTN model. Here we report our experience with propranolol in this model. Nineteen subjects with migraine without aura and 16 sex- and aged-matched healthy subjects were included in a two-centre randomized double-blind cross-over study. Fourteen migraine subjects and 14 healthy subjects completed the study and results from comparison of the 28 subjects are reported. Randomly propranolol 160 mg or placebo were each given daily for 14 days to both migraine and healthy subjects. A 20-min intravenous infusion of GTN 0.25 microg/kg per min was administered on a study day at the end of both pretreatment periods. Headache was registered for 12 h after GTN infusions. Its intensity was scored on a numerical verbal rating scale from 0 to 10. Fulfilment of International Headache Society (HIS) criteria was recorded for 24 h. Radial and superficial temporal artery diameters and blood velocity of both middle cerebral arteries were measured. All migraine subjects developed headache after GTN. No reduction of overall peak headache was found after propranolol (median 5, range 0-7) compared with placebo (median 5, range 0-10) (P = 0.441). Eight of the 14 completing migraine subject developed IHS 1.1 migraine after GTN, two subjects on both days, three subjects only after placebo, and three subjects only after propranolol. No reduction of GTN-induced migraine was found after propranolol compared with placebo (5 vs. 5, P = 1.000). All healthy subjects developed headache after GTN. No reduction of overall peak headache was found after propranolol (median 2, range 1-5) compared with placebo (median 1, range 1-7) (P = 0.315). Two subjects fulfilled IHS criteria 1.1 for migraine without aura after propranolol but not after placebo. The fulfilment was short lasting and did not require rescue medication. Headache after GTN was more pronounced in migraine subjects than in healthy subjects both with (P = 0.003) and without pretreatment with propranolol (P = 0.017). We found that 2 weeks of propranolol constricted the radial artery in healthy subjects but not in migraine subjects. GTN-induced vasodilatation abolished this difference. Mean maximum blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery was higher in healthy subjects than in migraine patients (P = 0.003-0.033) and unaffected by propranolol. We observed no effect of propranolol on GTN-induced headache and migraine. This could indicate that GTN induces migraine at a deeper level of the pathophysiological cascade of migraine than the prophylactic effect of propranolol. Propranolol does not constrict cerebral arteries, which therefore cannot be part of its mechanism of action in migraine.", 
    "37": "The basic principles of treatment for phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas are to block the effects of high catecholamines and make the patient safe for surgical removal of the tumour. The traditional preoperative medical preparation uses the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine and a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol. Other agents have been used effectively, including selective alpha-adrenoceptor blockers, doxazosin and prazosin, and calcium channel antagonists. There have been no trial comparing regimens and there is some controversy as to the best regimen. Major advances have been made in laparoscopic and laparoscopic-assisted surgery. Cortical-sparing adrenalectomy has been used in some centres for familial phaeochromocytomas. High-dose [(131)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy and combined [(131)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine and chemotherapy are promising new developments for the malignant disease. All patients should be followed indefinitely because the recurrence or malignancy rate is >or= 10% over a prolonged follow up.", 
    "38": "We compared the cardiac inotropic, lusitropic, and chronotropic responses to the Na(+) channel enhancer LY-368052 in conscious dogs before and after development of congestive heart failure (CHF). We also examined the effect of LY-368052 on baroreflex sensitivity and the efferent neural mechanisms of the bradycardic response in heart failure. Dogs were chronically instrumented, and heart failure was induced by right ventricular pacing at 240 beats/min for 3-4 wk. LY-368052 dose-dependently increased left ventricular contractile performance before and after the development of CHF to a similar extent. The inotropic effect of LY-368052 in heart failure was not altered by either ganglionic or beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. LY-368052 improved cardiac relaxation and induced bradycardia in dogs with heart failure but not in normal dogs. The negative chronotropic effect of LY-368052 was eliminated by ganglionic blockade but not beta-adrenergic blockade, suggesting that the bradycardia was mediated by the autonomic nervous system via enhanced parasympathetic tone. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed as the pulse interval-mean arterial pressure slope in response to temporary pharmacological (nitroglycerin or phenylephrine) and mechanical (brief occlusion of inferior vena cava) alterations of arterial pressure in conscious dogs before and after development of heart failure. Baroreflex sensitivity was significantly depressed in heart failure and restored completely by acute treatment with LY-368052. Thus the Na(+) channel enhancer LY-368052 maintains its beta-receptor-independent inotropic effect in chronic CHF and specifically improves ventricular relaxation and depressed baroreflex function.",

Unintended injury to normal adrenal tissue during RFA of adrenal tumors can lead to hypertensive crisis, a potentially catastrophic complication. Hemodynamic consequences of RFA of primary or metastatic adrenal masses have not been reported. We report a case of hypertensive crisis (249/140 mm Hg), tachycardia, and ventricular arrhythmia in an 82-yr-old woman undergoing RFA of renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the adrenal gland. Anesthesiologists should be aware of this potentially catastrophic complication.

After controlling for participant baseline characteristics and medication used, the authors studied the association of emotional upset, physical activity, and meteorologic parameters with occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 457 Croatian participants aged 11-88 years consecutively assigned to undergo continuous 24-hour Holter monitoring. In 2001, multivariate analysis of possible VT precipitators was performed separately for men, women, those aged <65 years, and those aged >64 years. A U-shaped pattern of wind speed (either very weak or very strong), rising relative air moisture, falling atmospheric pressure, and emotional upset were independent predictors of VT episodes in all participant subgroups. Positive association of VT with higher atmospheric temperature or pressure was observed in women and elderly. After adjustment for external triggers, a circadian variation in VT episodes persisted in women (p = 0.01) and those aged <65 years (p < 0.0001) only. A protective effect of beta-blockers and anxiolytics was especially apparent for men and elderly, as well as an adverse effect of digitalis in women. Results suggest that meteorologic and emotional stress could be considered external triggers of VT, with age- and sex-dependent susceptibility.", 
    "50": "Purine nucleotides and their analogs increase insulin secretion through activation of pancreatic beta-cell P2Y receptors. The present study aimed at determining the role of glucose metabolism in the response to P2Y agonists and whether ATP-activated K+ channels (KATP channels) are involved in this response. The experiments were performed in the rat isolated pancreas, perfused with a Krebs-bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 2 g/l bovine serum albumin under dynamic glucose conditions from 5 mmol/l baseline to 11 mmol/l. ADPbetaS (0.5 micromol/l) was selected as a stable and selective P2Y agonist. This compound, ineffective on the 5 mmol/l glucose background, induced a significant threefold increase in insulin release triggered by the glucose challenge. The effect of ADPbetaS was markedly reduced (P <0.001) in the presence of an inhibitor of glucose metabolism. In addition to glucose, the ADP analog also amplified the beta-cell insulin response to 15 mmol/l methyl pyruvate (P <0.05), but it was ineffective on the insulin response to 2.5 mmol/l methyl succinate. A nonmetabolic stimulus was applied using tolbutamide (185 micromol/l). Insulin secretion induced by the KATP channel blocker was strongly reinforced by ADPbetaS (P <0.001), which prompted us to check a possible interplay of KATP channels in the effect of ADPbetaS. In the presence of diazoxide 250 micromol/l and 21 mmol/l KCl, ADPbetaS still amplified the second phase of glucose-induced insulin secretion (P <0.001). We conclude that P2Y receptor activation is able to promote insulin secretion through a mechanism, involving beta-cell metabolism and a rise in intracellular calcium; this effect does not result from a direct inhibitory effect on KATP channels.", 
    "51": "Patch-clamp recordings and glucagon release measurements were combined to determine the role of plasma membrane ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) in the control of glucagon secretion from mouse pancreatic alpha-cells. In wild-type mouse islets, glucose produced a concentration-dependent (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]=2.5 mmol/l) reduction of glucagon release. Maximum inhibition (approximately 50%) was attained at glucose concentrations >5 mmol/l. The sulfonylureas tolbutamide (100 micromol/l) and glibenclamide (100 nmol/l) inhibited glucagon secretion to the same extent as a maximally inhibitory concentration of glucose. In mice lacking functional KATP channels (SUR1-/-), glucagon secretion in the absence of glucose was lower than that observed in wild-type islets and both glucose (0-20 mmol/l) and the sulfonylureas failed to inhibit glucagon secretion. Membrane potential recordings revealed that alpha-cells generate action potentials in the absence of glucose. Addition of glucose depolarized the alpha-cell by approximately 7 mV and reduced spike height by 30% Application of tolbutamide likewise depolarized the alpha-cell (approximately 17 mV) and reduced action potential amplitude (43%). Whereas insulin secretion increased monotonically with increasing external K+ concentrations (threshold 25 mmol/l), glucagon secretion was paradoxically suppressed at intermediate concentrations (5.6-15 mmol/l), and stimulation was first detectable at >25 mmol/l K+. In alpha-cells isolated from SUR1-/- mice, both tolbutamide and glucose failed to produce membrane depolarization. These effects correlated with the presence of a small (0.13 nS) sulfonylurea-sensitive conductance in wild-type but not in SUR1-/- alpha-cells. Recordings of the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) revealed that, whereas glucose lowered [Ca2+]i to the same extent as application of tolbutamide, the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin, or the Ca2+ channel blocker Co2+ in wild-type alpha-cells, the sugar was far less effective on [Ca2+]i in SUR1-/- alpha-cells. We conclude that the KATP channel is involved in the control of glucagon secretion by regulating the membrane potential in the alpha-cell in a way reminiscent of that previously documented in insulin-releasing beta-cells. However, because alpha-cells possess a different complement of voltage-gated ion channels involved in action potential generation than the beta-cell, moderate membrane depolarization in alpha-cells is associated with reduced rather than increased electrical activity and secretion.", 
    "52": "In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and severe congestive heart failure, immunoadsorption (IA) and subsequent IgG substitution leads to an acute and prolonged hemodynamic improvement. Goal of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of immunoadsorption on morbidity.",

Inclusion criteria were DCM, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35%, NYHA classes II-III. The average time after immunoadsorption was 3.0 years (median 2.3 years). Both groups did not differ concerning sex, age, duration of disease, medication, baseline ejection fraction and NYHA class.", 
    "54": "In patients who have received immunoadsorption (IA) the days of hospitalisation for congestive heart failure per year could be significantly reduced in contrast to the control patients (17.2 days prior to IA, 4.3 days after IA). Even if the procedural days for immunoadsorption were included there was still a significant reduction of hospitalisation if IA therapy was longer than 2.5 years ago. The days of hospitalisation increased gradually with time during the follow up period. IA induced an acute increase in EF (19.8-25.7%, p<0.01 vs. baseline).",

    "58": "Before myectomy the mean LV outflow gradient was 67 +/- 44 mm Hg, and at dismissal the mean LV outflow gradient was 12 +/- 13 mm Hg (p < 0.004). We found a significant decrease in the LV mass and LV mass index that occurred early after operation and persisted beyond 2 years follow-up. The early decrease in LV mass was greatest in patients younger than 50 years, but patients of all ages benefited from extended septal myectomy with decrease in LV hypertrophy.",

We analized the effects of a selective beta 1 betablocker: bisoprolol (B) on cardiovascular reactivity in our subjects (s). We studied 42 s, but only 30 (21 females and 9 males) were included who were hyperreactives. The mean age was 42.5 years. The higher values of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during the mental stress (MS) were taken as a measure of reactivity considering hyperreactive response an increase of 30 mm Hg or more and/or 15 mm Hg or more respectively. A prospective, randomized and double blind study on the effects of an oral daily doses of B (5 mg) vs placebo (P) was performed. Statistical analysis was realized with the Fisher exact test. In the results, we could observed a lower sensitivity of ARE and ST vs SCWCT. The 15 s who recieved P followed hyperreactives but 6 of 15 s treated with B were non reactives (p<0.017). B showed a beneficial effect on the hyperreactivity in a significant number of s in relation with P and it could be useful for the prevention of a future hypertension.", 
    "61": "This article reports the solution structure of BmTx3B (alpha-KTx16.2), a potassium channel blocker belonging to the subfamily alpha-KTx16, purified from the venom of the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch. In solution, BmTx3B assumes a typical CSalphabeta motif, with an alpha-helix connected to a triple-stranded beta-sheet by 3 disulfide bridges, which belongs to the first structural group of short-chain scorpion toxins. On the other hand, BmTx3B is quite different from other toxins (such as ChTx and AgTx2) of this group in terms of the electrostatic and hydrophobic surface distribution. The functional surface (beta-face) of the molecule is characterized by less basic residues (only 2: Lys28 and Arg35) and extra aromatic residues (Phe1, Phe9, Trp15, and Tyr37). The peptide shows a great preference for the Kca1.1 channel over the Kv channel (about a 10(3)-fold difference). The model of BmTx3B/Kca1.1 channel complex generated by docking and dynamic simulation reveals that the stable binding between the BmTx3B and Kca1.1 channel is favored by a number of aromatic pi-pi stacking interactions. The influences of these structural features on the kinetic behavior of the toxin binding to Kca1.1 channel are also discussed.", 
    "62": "Kazinol B, a natural isoprenylated flavan, stimulated the [Ca(2+)](i) elevation in the presence or absence of Ca(2+) in the medium. Treatment with chymotrypsin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to shedding of L: -selectin had no effect on subsequent kazinol B-induced Ca(2+) response. Upon initial cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) treatment in the absence of external Ca(2+), the subsequent [Ca(2+)](i) rise followed by challenge with kazinol B was greatly diminished. The ryanodine receptor blockers, 8-bromo-cyclic ADP-ribose and ruthenium red did not affect kazinol B-evoked Ca(2+) release from internal stores. However, the inhibitors of sphingosine kinase, dimethylsphingosine, but not dihydrosphingosine, inhibited kazinol B-induced Ca(2+) release. Kazinol B-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rise was not affected by two nitric oxidase inhibitors, N-(3-aminomethyl)benzylacetamidine (1400W) and 7-nitroindazole, cytochalasin B and Na(+)-deprivation. This response was slightly attenuated by 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate (2-APB), a D: -myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptor blocker, and by genistein, a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, the Ca(2+) response was greatly diminished by two actin filament reorganizers, calyculin A and jasplakinolide, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY 294002), an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, N-(3-aminomethyl)benzylacetamidine (SB 203580), the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, 1-[6-[17beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U-73122), the inhibitor of phospholipase C-coupled processes, and by 0.3 mM La(3+) or Ni(2+). Kazinol B did not evoke any appreciable Ba(2+) and Sr(2+) entry into cells. The Ca(2+) entry blockers, 1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole (SKF-96365), but not cis-N-(2-phenylcyclopentyl)azacyclotridec-1-en-2-amine (MDL-12,330A), inhibited a kazinol B-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rise. Kazinol B had no effect on the pharmacologically isolated plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. In a Ca(2+)-free medium, kazinol B inhibited the subsequent Ca(2+) addition, resulting in robust entry in CPA- and formyl peptide-activated cells. Kazinol B produced a concentration-dependent reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential. These results indicate that kazinol B stimulates Ca(2+) release from internal Ca(2+) store, probably through the sphingosine 1-phosphate and IP(3) signaling, and activates external Ca(2+) influx mainly through a non-store-operated Ca(2+) entry (non-SOCE) pathway. Inhibition of SOCE by kazinol B is probably attributable to a break in the Ca(2+) driven force of mitochondria.",

    "64": "A randomized, prospective, multicenter, open, parallel-group clinical trial was undertaken with 73 patients with chronic glaucoma treated with latanoprost and a timolol maleate gel-forming solution. In 36 patients, the previous regimen was substituted by nonpreserved timolol given instead of timolol maleate gel for 3 months. The changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) were recorded as well as local and systemic tolerance and patient compliance.", 
    "65": "At 3 months, both regimens were found equivalent in maintaining IOP control between D0 and D84. The difference with baseline was -0.08 +/- 2.22 mmHg and -0.38 +/- 2.41 mmHg in the nonpreserved timolol group and in the timolol maleate gel-forming solution group, respectively (CI 95% [-0.79; 1.38]). After 84 days of treatment, blurred vision (5.9%) and eyelid deposits (5.9%) were reduced in the preservative-free timolol group compared to the other group (respectively, 33.3% and 24.2%). These differences were statistically significant for both signs (blurred vision: p < 0.0001 and for eyelid deposits: p = 0.03).",

This prospective single-center study evaluated the predictors of clinical variables in determining favorable outcomes in treating chronic heart failure patients with carvedilol. The relation between clinical variables and maintenance doses of carvedilol was also determined. Seventy chronic heart failure patients (mean age, 62.2 years, 50 males and 20 females) with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% and functional class II-III were enrolled in the study. The patients were clinically followed-up for at least 24 months. Patients were considered to have a favorable outcome if they had no decreases in functional class or quality-of-life score, an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction>5%, were not admitted to hospital due to worsening heart failure, and free of cardiac mortality. Patients with favorable outcomes had a younger age (P = 0.021), higher baseline systolic blood pressure (P = 0.080), better baseline functional class (P = 0.001), and a higher tolerated dose of carvedilol (P = 0.026) than those in the unfavorable group. In this primarily Chinese cohort of chronic heart failure patients, those with favorable outcomes were likely to be young, have a high baseline systolic blood pressure, and good baseline functional class.", 
    "68": "We previously demonstrated that the severity of arrhythmias is reflected by circulating brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations in patients without signs of congestive heart failure. In the present study, we evaluated the relationships between the severity of the arrhythmia, BNP concentration, and echocardiographic findings. The subjects consisted of 52 patients with ventricular premature contractions (VPC) but no manifestations of heart failure and no digoxin or beta-blocker therapy. Patients underwent Holter monitoring, plasma sampling for BNP measurement, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). We scored the motion of 16 left ventricular segments, deriving a wall-motion score index (WMSI) by totaling the scores and dividing by the number of segments scored. Twenty-three patients with Lown grade I to II arrhythmias constituted group A while group B consisted of 29 Lown III to IV patients. Group B had BNP concentrations triple those in group A (57.2 versus 18.1 pg/mL, P < 0.01). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was similar in groups A and B (65.2% versus 62.1%, NS). Although left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) was normal in both groups, group B exhibited a larger LVEDD than group A (50 versus 46 mm, P < 0.005). The correlation (r) between BNP and interventricular septum thickness (IVST) was 0.27 (P = 0.013) in group A and 0.37 (P < 0.0001) in group B. Between BNP and posterior wall thickness (PWT), the correlation was 0.23 (P = 0.014) in group A versus 0.33 (P < 0.0001) in group B. The WMSI in group B was higher than in group A (1.34 versus 1.11, P < 0.05). We believe that besides the changes in echocardiographic parameters, the BNP elevation in group B could be a response to abnormal wall stress from the severe ventricular arrhythmias.",

The authors observed major cardiac rhythm disturbances in 11 patients aged 10 to 18 years. Tachyarrhythmic events were more frequent than impulse conduction disorders. Wide variations in CTG expansion were observed among the population. Since physical exercise was a prominent arrhythmogenic factor, systematic exercise tests with EKG monitoring may be indicated in young patients with DM1.",

TFC is a LC technique used for rapid extraction of compounds directly from complex matrices. It can be easily coupled to HPLC and MS for automation of an extraction/analysis procedure. Spherical MIP beads were produced using a suspension polymerisation technique and silica/MIP composite beads by grafting MIP to spherical silica particles using a surface-bound initiator species. Synthesis of both beaded and silica-grafted MIPs was more practical than using the traditional grinding method and yields of spherical particles of the required size between 80 and 100% were routinely achieved. Under HPLC conditions, beaded and ground MIP materials showed a degree of chiral separation for all of the nine beta-blockers tested. The beaded MIP, however, showed much better flow properties and peak shape than the ground material. Silica-grafted MIP showed some separation in five of the drugs and a large improvement in peak shape and analysis times compared with both ground and beaded MIPs. The materials prepared were also used in extraction columns for Turbulent Flow Chromatography (TFC). Although no imprinting effect was observed under typical TFC conditions, beaded polymer materials showed promise for use as TFC extraction columns due to the good flow properties and clean extracts obtained.",

    "83": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in western society. It is now widely accepted that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and, in particular, angiotensin II (A-II) play a key role in the pathophysiology of CHF. Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated that inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the principal enzyme responsible for A-II production, improve symptoms and survival in patients with CHF. This enzyme is also responsible for the breakdown of the vasodilator hormone bradykinin. Administration of ACE inhibitors is associated with increased plasma bradykinin levels and this is thought to contribute to the vascular changes associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. However, RAAS inhibition with ACE inhibitors remains incomplete because ACE inhibitors do not block the non-ACE-mediated conversion of angiotensin I to A-II. Angiotensin receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers; ARBs) antagonize the action of A-II at the A-II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor, whilst allowing the potentially beneficial actions of A-II mediated via the A-II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor. Evidence that the clinical benefit demonstrated with ACE inhibitors in patients with CHF may extend to ARBs has only emerged recently. Combination therapy with both an ACE inhibitor and an ARB has a number of potential advantages and has been investigated in several large-scale clinical trials recently. In patients with CHF, first-line therapy should include an ACE inhibitor and a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The addition of an ARB provides symptomatic relief but has not been shown to improve survival. Where an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated, treatment with an ARB would seem an appropriate alternative. There is insufficient data to support the routine use of ARBs as first-line therapy in the management of CHF.",

Patients (age 18-74 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension were enrolled in this multinational, open-label, centrally randomized, prospective parallel group study. Previous antihypertensive treatment, with either an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a Ca2+ channel blocker or a diuretic, was maintained for a run-in period of 4 weeks and was then substituted at the baseline visit where patients were randomized into two groups to receive either candesartan cilexetil 8 mg (n = 985) or 16 mg (n = 982) once daily for an 8-week treatment period. Blood pressure (BP) reduction was the primary endpoint after 4 weeks of therapy and the secondary endpoint after 8 weeks of therapy. Results of the first 4 weeks of therapy are presented here. A total of 1,967 patients were included: 985 received candesartan cilexetil 8 mg and 982 candesartan cilexetil 16 mg once daily; 1,879 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The percentages of patients receiving an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a Ca2+ channel blocker or a diuretic as previous antihypertensive treatment were 44.7, 18.8, 30.6 and 5.9%, respectively. After 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil 8 and 16 mg, sitting diastolic and systolic BP were reduced (mean +/- SD): -7 +/- 10 and -14 +/- 17 mmHg, and -8 +/- 10 and -16 +/- 16 mmHg, respectively. The percentage of patients who were still borderline hypertensive or hypertensive after 4 weeks of substitute treatment was lower in the candesartan cilexetil 16 mg group than in the 8 mg group: 7.1 and 5.3%, respectively, versus 9 and 7.4%, respectively.

    "90": "The role of alpha1-adrenoceptor activation on glucose uptake in L6 cells was investigated. The alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine [pEC50 (-log10 EC50), 5.27 +/- 0.30] or cirazoline (pEC50, 5.00 +/- 0.23) increased glucose uptake in a concentration-dependent manner, as did insulin (pEC50, 7.16 +/- 0.21). The alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine was without any stimulatory effect on glucose uptake. The stimulatory effect of cirazoline was inhibited by the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, but not by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. RT-PCR showed that the alpha1A-adrenoceptor was the sole alpha1-adrenoceptor subtype expressed in L6 cells. Cirazoline- or insulin-mediated glucose uptake was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002, suggesting a possible interaction between the alpha1-adrenoceptor and insulin pathways. Cirazoline or insulin stimulated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity, but alpha1-adrenoceptor activation did not phosphorylate Akt. Both cirazoline- and insulin-mediated glucose uptake were inhibited by protein kinase C (PKC), phospholipase C, and p38 kinase inhibitors, but not by Erk1/2 inhibitors (despite both treatments being able to phosphorylate Erk1/2). Insulin and cirazoline were able to activate and phosphorylate p38 kinase. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and the calcium ionophore A23187 produced significant increases in glucose uptake, indicating roles for PKC and calcium in glucose uptake. Down-regulation of conventional PKC isoforms inhibited glucose uptake mediated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, but not by insulin or cirazoline. This study demonstrates that alpha1-adrenoceptors mediate increases in glucose uptake in L6 muscle cells. This effect appears to be related to activation of phospholipase C, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, p38 kinase, and PKC.",

Retrospectively ECG-gated images were reconstructed at preselected phases (50% and 80%) of the cardiac cycle. A 3D voxel-based approach with cardiac phase weighting was used for reconstruction. Testing for correlation between heart rate, cardiac phase reconstruction window, and image quality was performed with Kruskal-Wallis analysis. Image quality (freedom from cardiac motion-related artifacts) was referenced against findings at conventional angiography in a secondary evaluation step. Regression analysis was performed to calculate heart rate thresholds for future beta-blocker application.",

    "96": "Adriamycin (ADR) is a widely used drug for the treatments of cancers. This study evaluates the effects of moxonidine and metoprolol on cardiac hemodynamics and survival in ADR-induced left ventricular dysfunction (total dose of 20 mg/kg in a 4-week regimen). Rats were treated with the centrally acting I(1)R agonist sympatho-inhibitor, moxonidine, or with the non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist, metoprolol, during 1 month or until death. Treatments began 1 week after the onset of the ADR administration. Low doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day) of moxonidine and metoprolol (10 mg/kg/day) improved cardiovascular function. High doses of moxonidine (3 mg/kg/day) and metoprolol (150 mg/kg/day) were cardiodepressive. Moxonidine and metoprolol both failed to improve survival. These data indicate that a treatment with these sympatho-inhibitors can reduce the left ventricular dysfunction induced by ADR. Moreover, these cardioprotective effects where obtained even when ADR was used at a dose regimen usually employed for its antineoplastic effects in rodents. Nevertheless, in this particular cardiomyopathy, we did not find any association between improvements of functional parameters and survival whatever the drug and the dose used. This problem points out the difficulty to prevent, at least with sympatho-inhibitory drugs alone, the mortality linked to the chronic cardiotoxicity of ADR.",

This study was designed to investigate the effects of carvedilol (CVD), an antihypertensive drug in I/R-induced renal failure in rats. The protective effect of CVD against the damage inflicted by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during renal I/R was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats using histopathological and biochemical parameters. In one set of experiments, animals were unilaterally nephrectomized, and subjected to 45 min of left renal pedicle occlusion and in another set both the renal pedicles were occluded for 45 min followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Carvedilol (2 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered twice, 30 min prior to ischemia and 12 h after the reperfusion period. At the end of the reperfusion period, rats were killed. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were determined in renal tissue. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations were measured for the evaluation of renal function. Ischemic control animals demonstrated severe deterioration of renal function, renal morphology and a significant renal oxidative stress. Pretreatment of animals with CVD markedly attenuated renal dysfunction, morphological alterations, reduced elevated TBARS levels and restored the depleted renal antioxidant enzymes. The findings imply that ROS play a causal role in I/R-induced renal injury and CVD exerts renoprotective effects probably by the radical scavenging and antioxidant activities.", 
    "98": "There is extensive evidence that several neurotransmitter systems within the basolateral amygdala (BLA) influence memory consolidation. The present study investigated the influence of dopamine (DA) in the BLA on the consolidation of memory for inhibitory avoidance (IA) training. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 300 g) were trained on a step-through IA task and, 48 h later, tested for retention as indexed by their latencies to enter the shock compartment on the test day. Drugs were infused into the BLA or central amygdala nucleus (CEA) immediately or 3 h after training via bilateral cannulae. DA infused into the BLA immediately after training enhanced retention, whereas DA infused into the BLA 3 h after training or into the CEA did not affect retention. Infusions of the dopaminergic antagonist cis-Flupenthixol together with DA blocked the DA-induced memory enhancement. Immediate post-training intra-BLA infusions of the D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 or the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride impaired retention. beta-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonists coinfused into the BLA with DA blocked the memory enhancing effects of DA. These findings indicate that dopaminergic activation within the BLA modulates memory consolidation and that the modulation involves activation of both D1 and D2 receptors and concurrent activation of beta-adrenergic and cholinergic influences within the BLA.",

    "112": "Beta-receptor down-regulation has been described as a common biochemical effect of chronic treatment with many but not all antidepressant drugs. Beta-receptor activation leads to elevated intracellular levels of cAMP followed by the activation of several protein kinases which in turn activate various transcription factors. One of those, CREP has received increasing interest as an relevant component within the antidepressant drug modulated signal cascade as it represents a down-stream signal not only of the beta-receptor but also of serotonin receptor activation. Chronic treatment with many antidpressant drugs has been shown to alter CREP levels in several brain regions. While beta-receptor down-regulation by chronic antidepressant treatment has been a consistent finding, alterations of CREP levels have been observed in both direction. Similarly divergent findings have been reported for BDNF a major gene targeted of CREB, where most but not all findings suggest up-regulation at least at the message level following chronic antidepressant treatment.",

Fluorescence patterns of rhodamine 123, an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), were analyzed for period and amplitude of oscillations using two methods: CLUSTER7 and fast Fourier transform (FFT). The period of DeltaPsim oscillations was greater in islets (271 +/- 21 s, n = 34) compared to dispersed beta cells (180 +/- 10 s, n = 54) by FFT analysis (p < 0.0005). CLUSTER7 confirmed differences in period and also detected oscillatory amplitude differences between beta cells (12.0 +/- 0.8) and islets (7.1 +/- 2.3% of baseline fluorescence, p < 0.0001). Depolarizing responses to the mitochondrial poison NaN3 were reduced in beta cells (35 +/- 4%) vs islets (58 +/- 9%), and hyperpolarizing responses to the calcium channel blocker nifedipine were enhanced in beta cells (15 +/- 4%) vs islets (8 +/- 1%), suggesting that mitochondria in dispersed beta cells were less energized than those in intact islets (p < 0.005), possibly due to elevated intracellular calcium. These findings suggest that individual beta cells possess the proper machinery to generate metabolic oscillations. Differences in oscillatory period, DeltaPsim, and nifedipine response suggest that incorporation into islets provides beta cells with additional modulatory influences.", 
    "117": "Drug/metabolite ratios (MRs) are used as in vivo markers of enzyme activity. The ratios are potentially confounded by the renal clearance of the drug (urine-based MRs) or metabolite (plasma-based MRs). The authors have investigated the relative sensitivity of urinary MR of 3 in vivo probe substrates of CYP2D6 debrisoquine (DB), dextromethorphan (DM), and metoprolol (MP) to changes in urine pH. Three groups of healthy volunteers each comprising 12 individuals were given DB (10 mg), DM (25 mg), or MP (100 mg) on 3 occasions. In 1 study arm, urine was acidified by the oral intake of ammonium chloride; in another, it was alkalinized by intake of sodium bicarbonate; and in the third, urine pH was uncontrolled. Urinary MP/alpha-hydroxy-MP, DM/dextrorphan, and DB/4-hydroxy-DB ratios were calculated. The mean(geo) MR for DB was not significantly different in any of the study arms, whereas those for MP and DM were significantly different under acidified and alkalinized urine conditions compared to uncontrolled urine pH (P < .01) and were correlated with urine pH (P < .001). Without control of urine pH, in vivo estimates of CYP2D6 metabolic activity are likely to be less precise using DM or MP as probe substrates compared to DB. Although this is unlikely to cause any problem in distinguishing the large functional differences in CYP2D6 in poor metabolizer (PM) and extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotypes, this may contribute to difficulties in differentiating in vivo metabolic activity among allelic variants within the overall CYP2D6 EM phenotype using MP or DM. However, because DB is not available in many countries (eg, United States), alternative in vivo markers of CYP2D6 with low sensitivity to urine pH should be sought.",

The addition of aldosterone antagonists to the digoxin, diuretic, ACE, and beta-blocker combination appears to offer benefit and the use of the new less toxic eplerone will become more frequently employed in selected patients. Sudden death is also an important contributor to mortality in CHF patients. Use of a amiodarone and ICD's have both been reported to offer benefit.

Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, percent functional shortening, and rates of intraventricular pressure rise were significantly changed by carvedilol infusion as compared with the basal values in group N (normal rats), but not in group F. The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was elevated, corresponding to the enhancement of the plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration caused by carvedilol infusion, in group N. The enhancement of the plasma NE concentration induced by carvedilol administration in group F was higher than that in group N. The value for the maximal hypertensive effect of NE intravenous infusion (Emax) was decreased, and the plasma NE concentration at half-maximal effect (EC50) was increased in group F as compared with the values in group N. These results indicate that the SNS (presynaptic) activity is increased and that the SNS receptor sensitivity in the cardiovascular regulation system is decreased in heart failure.", 
    "148": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) has been implicated in beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR)/G(i)-mediated compartmentation of the concurrent G(s)-cAMP signaling, negating beta2-AR-induced phospholamban phosphorylation and the positive inotropic and lusitropic responses in cardiomyocytes. However, it is unclear whether PI3K crosstalks with the beta1-AR signal transduction, and even more generally, with the cAMP/PKA pathway. In this study, we show that selective beta1-AR stimulation markedly increases PI3K activity in adult rat cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 significantly enhances beta1-AR-induced increases in L-type Ca2+ currents, intracellular Ca2+ transients, and myocyte contractility, without altering the receptor-mediated phosphorylation of phospholamban. The LY294002 potentiating effects are completely prevented by betaARK-ct, a peptide inhibitor of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 (betaARK1) as well as G(betagamma) signaling, but not by disrupting G(i) function with pertussis toxin. Moreover, forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, also elevates PI3K activity and inhibition of PI3K enhances forskolin-induced contractile response in a betaARK-ct sensitive manner. In contrast, PI3K inhibition affects neither the basal contractility nor high extracellular Ca2+-induced increase in myocyte contraction. These results suggest that beta1-AR stimulation activates PI3K via a PKA-dependent mechanism, and that G(betagamma) and the subsequent activation of betaARK1 are critically involved in the PKA-induced PI3K signaling which, in turn, negates cAMP-induced positive inotropic effect via inhibiting sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx and the subsequent increase in intracellular Ca2+ transients, without altering the receptor-mediated phospholamban phosphorylation, in intact cardiomyocytes.", 
    "149": "A LC-MS method using clenbuterol as internal standard was developed and validated for three b-blockers (BB) (atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol) in rabbit postmortem matrices: heart, lung, kidney, liver, brain, blood, vitreous humor, gastric liquid, and urine. The BB were extracted from 2.0 mL of biofluids or 200 mg of solid tissues (after grinding and homogenization) by liquid-liquid extraction using Extrelut columns. Chromatographic separation involved a Nucleosil C18 (150 mm x 1-mm i.d., 5 microm) column together with a gradient of acetonitrile in 2mM, pH 3 ammonium formate. The compounds were ionized in the ionspray source of the atmospheric pressure mass spectrometer and fragmented by in-source collisions. The fragment ions were detected in the positive selected ion monitoring mode, targeting one quantitation and two confirmation ions per compound. The extraction recovery ranged between 10 and 40%, depending on the matrices. The limits of quantitation were 50 ng/g in tissues, 50 microg/L in blood and urine, and 10 microg/L in vitreous humor. Indeed, as preliminary results in one rabbit administered 5 mg/kg of each BB showed that BBs were more concentrated in some postmortem organs, validation was performed in the relevant concentration area in these particular tissues. The technique was found to be linear between 50 ng/g and 5000 ng/g for heart and liver, between 50 microg/L and 5000 microg/L for urine extracts, between 1000 ng/g and 50 000 ng/g for lung and kidney, and between 500 microg/L and 5000 microg/L for gastric content. A quadratic equation best fitted the calibration curve in blood between 50 microg/L and 5000 microg/L, as well as in brain between 50 ng/g and 40,000 ng/g. The correlation coefficients were all higher than 0.997. Intra- and interassay precision and accuracy fulfilled the international requirements. This simple and sensitive assay was applied to the determination of three BB in the biofluids and tissues of a rabbit as part of a preliminary step of a postmortem redistribution study and is also suitable for the routine determination of BB in forensic investigations.", 
    "150": "Social phobia (also known as social anxiety disorder) is still not clearly understood. It was not established as an authentic psychiatric entity until the diagnostic nomenclature of the American Psychiatric Association DSM III in 1980. In recent years, increasing attention among researchers has contributed to provide important information about the genetic, familial and temperamental bases of social phobia and its neurochemical, neuroendocrinological and neuroanatomical substrates, which remain to be further investigated. Up to date, there have been several findings about the possible influence of variables, including particularly genetic, socio-familial and early temperamental (eg behavioral inhibition) factors that represent risk for the later development of social phobia. Clinical neurobiological studies, based on the use of exogenous compounds such as lactate, CO2, caffeine, epinephrine, flumazenil or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin to reproduce naturally occurring phobic anxiety, have shown that patients with social phobia appear to exhibit an intermediate sensitivity between patients with panic disorder and control subjects. No difference in the rate of panic attacks in response to lactate, low concentrations of CO2 (5%), epinephrine or flumazenil was observed between patients with social phobia and normal healthy subjects, both being less reactive compared to patients with panic disorder. However, patients with social phobia had similar anxiety reactions to high concentrations of CO2 (35%), caffeine or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin than those seen in patients with panic disorder, both being more intensive than in controls. Several lines of evidence suggest specific neurotransmitter system alterations in social phobia, especially with regard to the serotoninergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Although no abnormality in platelet serotonin transporter density has been found, patients with social phobia appear to show an enhanced sensitivity of both post-synaptic 5HT1A and 5HT2 serotonin receptor subtypes, as reflected by increased anxiety and hormonal responses to serotoninergic probes. Platelet 5HT2 receptor density has also been reported to be positively correlated to symptom severity in patients with social phobia. During anticipation of public speaking, heart rate was elevated in patients with social phobia compared to controls. Norepinephrine response to the orthostatic challenge test or to the Valsalva maneuver was also greater in patients with social phobia. While normal beta-adrenergic receptor number was observed in lymphocytes, a blunted response of growth hormone to clonidine, an a2-adrenergic agonist, was reported. This suggests reduced post-synaptic a2-adrenergic receptor functioning related to norepinephrine overactivity in social phobia. Decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid have also been observed. There are relatively few reports of involvement of the adrenal and thyroid functions in social phobia, and all that has been noted is that patients with social phobia show an exaggerated adrenocortical response to a psychological stressor. Recent advances in neuro-imaging have contributed to find low striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding or low dopamine transporter site density in patients with social phobia. They have also demonstrated the involvement of the cortico-limbic pathways, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, which show an increased activity in different experimental conditions. These brain regions have extensively been reported to play an important role in the cognitive appraisal in determining the significance of environmental stimuli, in the emotional and mnemonic integration of information, and in the expression of contextual fear-conditioned behaviors, which might be disrupted in the light of the phenomelogical aspects of social phobia. A substantial body of literature based on case reports, open and placebo-controlled trials, has now clearly examined the efficacy of major classes of psychotropic agents including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, beta-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines in social phobia. Until recently, irreversible non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors, of which phenelzine was the most extensively evaluated, were considered as the most efficacious treatment in reducing the symptomatology associated with social phobia in 50-70% of cases after 4 to 6 weeks. However, side effects and dietary restrictions limit their use. This led to the development of reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A, for which careful dietary monitoring is not required. Moclobemide has been the most widely studied but produced unconvincingly therapeutic effects on social phobic symptoms. To date, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be considered as a reasonable first-line pharmacotherapy for social phobia. There is growing evidence for the efficacy of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline. They have beneficial effects with response rates ranging from 50 to 80% in social phobia. It has been recommended that the treatment period should be extended at least 6 months beyond the early improvement achieved within the first 4 to 6 weeks. The overall advantages include tolerability with a low risk of adverse events. The benzodiazepines clonazepam and alprazolam have also been proposed for the treatment of social phobia. Symptomatic relief occurred in 40 to 80% of the cases with a relatively rapid onset of action within the first two weeks. Untoward effects, discontinuation-related withdrawal symptoms and abuse or dependence liability constitute major concerns about the use of benzodiazepines, so they should be reserved for cases unresponsive to the safer medications cited above. Beta-blockers such as atenolol and propanolol have commonly been employed in performance anxiety, decreasing autonomic symptoms (eg, tachycardia, sweating and dry mouth). However, they are not effective in the generalized form of social phobia. Other pharmacologic alternatives seem helpful for the management of social phobia, including venlafaxine, gabapentin, bupropion, nefazodone or augmentation with buspirone. Preliminary studies point to promising effects of these agents. Larger controlled clinical trials are now needed to confirm their potential role in the treatment of social phobia.", 
    "151": "Treatment of portal hypertension is evolving based on randomised controlled trials. In acute variceal bleeding, prophylactic antibiotics are mandatory, reducing mortality as well as preventing infections. Terlipressin or somatostatin combined with endoscopic ligation or sclerotherapy is the best strategy for control of bleeding but there is no added effect of vasoactive drugs on mortality. Non-selective beta-blockers are the first choice therapy for both secondary and primary prevention; if contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers are present then band ligation should be used. Novel therapies target the increased intrahepatic resistance caused by microcirculatory intrahepatic deficiency of nitric oxide and contraction of activated intrahepatic stellate cells.", 
    "152": "The neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) has been shown to modulate cerebellar-dependent learning and memory. Lesions of the nucleus locus coeruleus or systemic blockade of noradrenergic receptors has been shown to delay the acquisition of several cerebellar-dependent learning tasks. To date, no studies have shown a direct involvement of cerebellar noradrenergic activity nor localized the post-synaptic response to cerebellar beta-noradrenergic receptor signaling. Using ipsilateral, localized infusions into cerebellar lobule HVI and interpositus (IP), we have established that blocking beta-noradrenergic receptors with propranolol significantly impairs acquisition of conditioned responses. Furthermore, interrupting activation of cAMP-dependent PKA in the cerebellum using Rp-cAMPS completely prevents acquisition. However, neither blocking beta-adrenergic receptors nor blocking PKA activation significantly interferes with performance of established conditioned responses when administered after the learned response is formed.", 
    "153": "Increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have been associated with several of the components of the metabolic syndrome, but the direct influence of diet and lifestyle factors on CRP levels remains largely unknown. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between CRP and diet and lifestyle factors. Plasma CRP levels were determined by a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 760 participants in the beta-Blocker Cholesterol-Lowering Asymptomatic Plaque Study (BCAPS). In accordance with previous findings, increased levels of CRP were associated with high body mass index (BMI) (P = .012), triglycerides (P = .001), systolic blood pressure (P = .019), cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (P = .009), and low HDL cholesterol (P = .001). CRP was also increased in smokers (P = .023) and in subjects with a low vitamin C intake (P = .018). When men and women were analyzed together, there were no significant associations between CRP and dietary intake of total calories, total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber, vitamin E, carotene, or selen, or in physical activity. However, in the female subgroup weak inverse relations were observed between CRP and the intake of total fat (r = -0.13, P = .011), saturated fat (r = -0.13, P = .011), monounsaturated fat (r = -0.13, P = .010), polyunsaturated fat (r = -0.14, P = .007), and n-3 PUFA (r = -0.14, P = .004). Stratified factor analyses in smoking subgroups, obese, and in under-reporters of energy, largely confirmed the results although in male never-smokers a combination of high fiber vitamin C/beta carotene intake was associated with low CRP levels. These observations suggest that CRP levels are only marginally associated with individual dietary and lifestyle factors. Surprisingly, a higher intake of fat tended to be associated with lower CRP values among women.",

The authors also examine physician and patient-related factors associated with guideline adherence in a subset of patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. Among members with high blood pressure alone, only 38 percent were on a diuretic, while less than a third were prescribed a beta-blocker, the JNC VI recommended first-line antihypertensives for essential hypertension. Approximately half of individuals with high blood pressure and certain comorbidities received non-first-line interventions.

    "191": "Individuals with thicker corneas had smaller measured IOP responses to ocular hypotensive medication than those with normal or thin corneas. We believe that CCT measurements may be useful in patient management and in interpreting clinical trials of ocular hypotensive medication.", 
    "192": "Studies using genetic manipulation to investigate mechanisms of control of physiologic function often necessitate mouse models. However, baseline functional analysis of murine small intestinal motility has not been well defined. Our aim was to define nitrergic mechanisms regulating mouse small intestinal longitudinal muscle. Endogenous nitric oxide (NO) is an important neuroregulatory substance mediating inhibition of contractile activity in murine small bowel. Full-thickness muscle strips of jejunum and ileum from C57BL/6 mice (n > or =6 mice) cut in the direction of longitudinal muscle were studied. Numerous conditions of electrical field stimulation (EFS) and effects of exogenous NO and NO donors were studied in the absence or presence of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and 1H-[1,2,4]-oxadiazaolo-[4,3-a]-quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a downstream inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase. EFS induced a frequency-dependent inhibition of contractile activity in both jejunum and ileum (P < 0.05). As the voltage of EFS was increased, inhibition turned to excitation in the jejunum; in contrast, the ileum demonstrated a voltage-dependent increasing inhibition (P < 0.05 each). EFS-induced inhibition was blocked by NOS inhibitors and ODQ. NO donors inhibited spontaneous contractile activity abolished by ODQ. NO appears to be an endogenous inhibitory neurotransmitter in murine longitudinal small bowel muscle. Nitrergic mechanisms mediate inhibitory control of murine longitudinal small intestinal muscle. Differences exist in neuroregulatory control between jejunum and ileum that may be related to their known difference in motor patterns."
