    "1": "In a double masked randomized design, one eye of each subject (n = 9) received two drops of 0.5 % timolol or 2 % cartelol or 0.5 % betaxolol ophthalmic solution and a separate group of nine rabbits received two drops of placebo consisting of physiological saline in both eyes to serve as control. Using hydrogen clearance method, ciliary body blood flow (CiBF), choroidal blood flow (CBF), and retinal blood flow (RBF) were measured. IOP and systemic mean arterial pressure (MAP) of each subject were measured under same condition before and after the administration of respective drugs to calculate the ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) and vessel resistance.", 
    "2": "In timolol- and carteolol-treated eyes significant reduction was observed in IOP (p < 0.01), CiBF (p < 0.01), CBF (p < 0.01) and RBF (p < 0.01) compared to control eyes. However, in betaxolol-treated eyes a marginal reduction in IOP was observed accompanied by significant increase in CiBF (p < 0.01) and RBF (p < 0.05). The non-selective beta-blocker-treated eyes tended to have increased vessel resistance, whereas, selective beta-blocker-treated eyes tended to have decreased vessel resistance.", 
    "3": "Our current results comparing non-selective and selective beta-blockers suggest that the selective beta-blocker betaxolol may be more appropriate for maintenance of retinal blood flow in situations with low perfusion. Currently the mechanism for regulation of IOP is unclear; however, the findings from this study indicate that decreased CiBF may contribute to reduction in IOP.",

    "5": "After removal of vitreous, lens, retina and choroid from freshly enucleated rabbit eyes, the anterior segment and attached sclera was chilled in cold buffer containing the non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Then ciliary processes were excised and homogenized in ice cold trichloro-acetic acid (TCA) 2.5 min after IBMX treatment. Increased cyclic AMP in response to PDE inhibition was measured in ciliary processes at six times during the circadian cycle, after preganglionic section of the cervical sympathetic trunk (decentralization, DX), and after topical instillation of hydroxyamphetamine, timolol, brimonidine, rauwolscine or a soluble derivative of forskolin.", 
    "6": "The increase of rabbit ciliary process cyclic AMP levels in response to PDE inhibition with IBMX was enhanced at night. Much of the enhanced nocturnal increase persisted in constant dark and was blunted by DX. Topical instillation of hydroxyamphetamine enhanced the increase during the day; whereas, timolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, or brimonidine, an alpha2-adrenergic agonist, blunted the IBMX induced increase. Neither instillation of rauwolscine, an alpha2-adrenergic antagonist, nor the soluble forskolin derivative enhanced the increase of cyclic AMP after IBMX.",

    "10": "In 1981, while diuretics were the first treatment in both populations (53% in diabetics vs 60% in non-diabetics, non significant), central inhibitors (31 vs 16% respectively, p<0.001) were the second agent among diabetic patients instead of beta blockers in non-diabetic patients (13 vs 22% respectively, p<0.05). In 1992, beta blockers were also less used in diabetics (21 versus 33%, p=0.001). In contrast, ACE inhibitors were more used (43 versus 35%, p=0.06). In both surveys and populations, other classes (reserpin, vasodilator and alpha blockers) had minor place in the strategy. The frequency of combinations of antihypertensive drugs was similar in both surveys and populations. The preferred combination treatment was in both populations reserpin with diuretics in 1981 (7 vs 9%, non significant) and ACE inhibitors with diuretics in 1992 (18 vs 18%).",

Current CT technology offers a temporal resolution of 250 ms. In case of heart rates (HRs) >65 beats/min (bpm), however, the reconstruction software switches from a single-phase algorithm (using data from one heart cycle only) to a biphase algorithm using image data of two consecutive heart cycles, improving temporal resolution to down to 125 ms. Thus, it was the aim of the present study to evaluate the influence of the patients' (pts) HR on image quality expressed by vessel segment visibility.", 
    "13": "MSCT scans (Somatom VZ) were performed in 94 pts. Ten coronary segments were analyzed in each patient with regard to image quality (RCA: segments [sgts] 1-4, LMS: sgt 5, LAD: sgts 5-8, LCX: sgts 11, 12). A total of 697 of 940 (74.1%) sgts were accurately visualizable (RCA: 244/376 [64.9%], LMS: 94/94 [100%], LAD: 232/283 (82.3%), LCX: 146/188 [77.7%]). Beta-blocker therapy had a significant influence on mean HR (65 pts on beta-blocker, HR 65.1+/-10.7 bpm vs. 29 pts, HR 71.6+/-12.2 bpm, P=.01). A significant inverse correlation between HR and segmental visibility was found (r=-.48, P<.0001), with best visibility in pts with lower HRs (n=14 pts with 10 analyzable sgts, HR 60+/-10.1 vs. n=8 pts with 4 analyzable sgts, HR 79.9+/-6.9, P<.0001).", 
    "14": "Our results indicate that vessel visibility is highly dependent on the pts HR. Best vessel visibility was found in pts with HR <65 bpm with single-phase image reconstruction.

Compared with placebo treatment, beta-blocker use is associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients with class II and III heart failure.", 
    "21": "Tested in more than 10,000 patients, beta-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in class II through IV heart failure. Along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, beta-blockers have strengthened the armamentarium to improve clinical outcomes of heart failure patients. The science supporting beta-blockers must be translated into practice safely and rationally if the agents are to achieve their full potential.", 
    "22": "The antioxidant and lysosomotropic properties of a fluorescent analogue of propranolol, 9-amino-acridine-propranolol (9-AAP) were compared to those of propranolol. Using isolated microsomal membranes exposed to a superoxide and hydroxyl radical generating system, 9-AAP was found to be at least 10-fold more potent than propranolol (and about 50% as potent as vitamin E) in inhibiting lipid peroxidation. In cultured endothelial cells, 9-AAP afforded moderate protective effect against acute loss of glutathione but potent cytoprotective activity against free radical-mediated loss of viability/survival. Intracellular localization of 9-AAP was examined by fluorescent microscopy and compared with two known fluorescent lysosomal markers: acridine orange and Lysosensor. All three agents appeared to localize to similar peri-nuclear vesicles, presumably lysosomes or pre-lysosomes. Lysosensor fluorescence was not observable in the presence of 9-AAP, foreclosing the possibility of a direct dual labeling experiment. We employed the pH sensitivity of acridine orange to determine if it labels the same vesicles as 9-AAP. When the endothelial cells were preloaded with acridine orange, washed and resuspended in buffer containing 9-AAP, the dark orange-labeled vesicles observed with acridine orange alone became increasingly lighter with time. Since the fluorescence of acridine orange is altered by pH change, this spectral shift in fluorescence emission is consistent with the indication that added propranolol (or the analog) leads to lysosomal alkalization. In conclusion, 9-AAP is both a strong antioxidant and a lysosomotropic agent that is remarkably insensitive to photobleaching. These properties may contribute to the enhanced endothelial cytoprotective effects against free radical-induced injury.",

    "25": "The main risk factors of the hypertensive patients were in the order as: disorder of lipometabolism, smoking, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and Diabetes mellitus. Sixty point nine percent of the inpatients were followed up. The incidences of compliance were 63.4% in the inpatients, 77.3% when being discharged, and 43.7% in the outpatients. The cause of uncompliance were as follows: side-effect of the medication, failure to control BP, financial problems, etc. Data gathered during follow up period, it was found the side effect of the calcium antagonist and the diuretics improved palpably. Those compliers controlled their BP well, while little fluctuation of BP was observed. However, the uncompliers showed different pictures, and the range of fluctuation of BP was large.",

A graphic method was previously proposed and used by several groups. However, this approach was not completely validated. The purpose of this study was to improve and confirm the validity of this approach through a better knowledge of the associated ligand-receptor model, estimated for the first time using the multiinjection approach.", 
    "28": "The concentration of beta-adrenergic receptor sites was estimated for mini pigs using 2 methods. The first was the usual multiinjection approach, which permits estimation of all model parameters, including receptor concentration. However, this approach needs a complex protocol, including blood sampling, thereby making it difficult to use for studies on patients. The second method was the CGP 12177 graphic method. This approach permits the estimation of only receptor concentration but has the advantage of not requiring blood sampling. Another advantage is the ability to generate parametric images easily.", 
    "29": "Using the multiinjection approach, we obtained for the first time a complete model describing interactions between CGP 12177 and beta-adrenergic receptors. Knowledge of all parameters of this model permitted good validation of the assumptions included in the graphic method. The concentration of beta-adrenergic receptor sites in mini pigs was estimated at 15.2 +/- 3.4 pmol/mL.", 
    "30": "The graphic method has been improved by taking into account various phenomena, such as protein binding and the nonlinearity between plasma concentration and injected dose. This method is now usable for patient studies and offers the ability to estimate the beta-adrenergic receptor concentration from a single PET experiment without blood sampling. Parametric imaging will enable screening of the receptor site location and observation of potential anomalies in patients.", 
    "31": "Five percent of all hospital medical admissions are patients with heart failure. The incidence is about one new case per 1000 of the general population per year, increasing to >10 per 1000 in those aged >or=85 years. Although the evidence that beta-blockers reduce mortality by about 36% when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is overwhelming, clinicians are still reluctant to use beta-blockers in heart failure, especially in older patients. Here, we examine the evidence for the use of beta-blockers in heart failure in older people and explore the practicalities of their use.", 
    "32": "In beta-cells activation of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-signaling cascade stimulates c-fos mRNA expression, which involves cAMP- and Ca(2+)-mediated mechanisms. To delineate potential crosstalk between both pathways at the transcriptional level we simultaneously measured c-fos promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression and cytosolic free calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) in single beta-cells (HIT-T15). Forskolin stimulated a rapid rise in cellular cAMP and in [Ca(2+)](i) through activation of voltage-sensitive Ca(2+)-influx and enhanced wild-type c-fos promoter-driven EGFP (pF711d2EGFP) expression about 4-fold after 6 h. The voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel (VSCC)-blocker nifedipine, which completely blocked the forskolin-induced rise in [Ca(2+)](i), partially inhibited the forskolin-induced increase in pF711d2EGFP expression, while it was completely abolished in Ca(2+)-free medium. VSCC-dependent Ca(2+)-influx per se when stimulated by K(+) (45 mM) increased pF711d2EGFP expression only minimally. No correlations could be delineated between the forskolin-induced amplitude of the Ca(2+) signal and the expression of pF711d2EGFP at the single cell level, which may indicate that small rises in [Ca(2+)](i) are sufficient to fully activate the Ca(2+)-dependent pathways required for cAMP-dependent c-fos promoter regulation. In experiments with various deletion constructs of the c-fos promoter, it could be shown that cAMP-mediated activation of the c-fos promoter involves both the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) and the serum-responsive element (SRE). While nifedipine completely abrogated the cAMP-dependent activation of c-fos transcription via the SRE, the CRE-mediated effect of cAMP on the c-fos promoter remained unaffected by nifedipine. Thus, cAMP and Ca(2+) are required for full c-fos promoter activation by the cAMP-signaling pathway in beta-cells. cAMP-dependent Ca(2+)-influx through VSCC is crucial for c-fos gene transcription via the SRE, whereas cAMP-mediated activation of the CRE demands Ca(2+)-influx, which is distinct from voltage-sensitive Ca(2+)-influx. This indicates a complex interplay between cAMP and Ca(2+) in controlling c-fos gene transcription and suggests that the mode of Ca(2+) entry may differentially act on signaling pathways leading to gene transcription in beta-cells.",

    "34": "To test whether angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion aggravates or ameliorates an acute glomerulonephritis, the peptide was infused (200 ng/min by osmotic minipump) in rats with an anti-thymocyte antibody-induced glomerulonephritis (ATS).", 
    "35": "Ang II significantly increased blood pressure. Following injection of the antibody, similar glomerular binding of rabbit IgG and rat complement C3 was detected in ATS and Ang II+ATS rats, indicating no differences in delivery and binding of the antibody. Ang II infusion, however, induced a significant reduction in glomerular monocyte infiltration, cell proliferation and matrix expansion in nephritic rats compared to rats with nephritis without Ang II. The antiproliferative effect of Ang II was inhibited by the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker irbesartan, but not by the AT2 receptor blocker PD 123319, indicating that this effect was likely transduced by AT1 receptors. Norepinephrine infusion (600 ng/min) produced a similar degree of hypertension, but did not affect glomerular proliferation in nephritic rats. Ang II induced the glomerular expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27KIP1 and of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and inhibited expression of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1).", 
    "36": "Ang II surprisingly ameliorates glomerular monocyte infiltration, proliferation and matrix expansion in ATS nephritis. Ang II-mediated induction of cyclin kinase inhibitors and TGF-beta may contribute to the protection of the glomerulus from inflammatory injury by inducing cell cycle arrest and attenuating activation of local and recruited cells. Alternatively, Ang II might protect the kidney at least in part by less inflow of disease activators due to reduction of renal blood flow. Therefore, activation of the renin-angiotensin system may have protective effects in certain pathophysiological situations.", 
    "37": "Previous studies have shown that five human cancer cell lines, LS180, MKN-1, MMG-1, C32 and LX-1, induced remarkable weight loss in tumor-bearing nude mice. With the aim of identifying novel molecules involved in lipid catabolism, conditioned media of these cancer cell lines were analyzed in terms of lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-inhibiting or lipolytic activities. All conditioned media from the five cell lines significantly suppressed LPL activity in 3T3-L1 cells, while media from LX-1 and C32 promoted lipolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner. RT-PCR and ELISA demonstrated that the major factors responsible for LPL inhibition and lipolysis were not IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-11, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1 or LIF in all the cancer cell lines except for MMG-1 cells. Preliminary biochemical analysis showed that the LPL-inhibiting factor produced by LX-1 cells was approximately 65 kD and vulnerable to heat, whereas the lipolytic factor was less than 1 kD and heat stable. These results suggested that unknown factors are partially involved in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia in tumor-bearing nude mice and further purification will be needed.", 
    "38": "As exemplified by the two classes of substance beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, the question is considered as to when new developments within a drug family can be termed innovations and when they must be seen purely as plagiarisms (\"me-too\" preparations). It is noted that in principle no innovations are to be expected from generics, since these substances are are not the subject of specific research. Although large-scale clinical studies in recent years have identified a new indication--cardiac insufficiency--for the beta blockers metoprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol, this must not be considered an innovation in the sense of a new development. The translatability of the study results to uninvestigated substances is uncertain. In contrast to the beta blockers, the indications for the ACE inhibitors have long been known, but again, the new generic preparations that have come onto the market are not innovations.",

The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the relationship between acute results obtained by catheter ablation and long-term outcome in a homogeneous population of patients with post-myocardial infarction ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "40": "One hundred and twenty-four consecutive patients with recurrent, drug-refractory, haemodynamically tolerated ventricular tachycardia were included in the study. This population accounted for 30% of the patients with post-myocardial infarction ventricular tachycardia admitted between April 1992 and September 1997 to the investigating centres. The ablation was successful in eliminating sustained ventricular tachycardia in 91 of them (73%); a partial result was obtained in 21 (17%) and failure in 12 (10%). Low dose amiodarone and/or beta-blockers were maintained in 86% of the patients. Over a median follow-up of 41.5 months (interquartile range 30.5-59.5 months), there were 15 deaths (12%), three of which were sudden (2.4%); the 12 remaining patients died of heart failure. Event-free survival analysis showed a significantly lower ventricular tachycardia recurrence rate in patients with a successful procedure as compared to those with failure or a partial result (19% vs 53% at one year and 27% vs 60% at 3 years, P=0.003). A repeat procedure was performed in 15 patients with early recurrences and was followed in all by long-term success. Of those who submitted to a second procedure, 93/124 patients (75%) are free of ventricular tachycardia recurrences.

All fetuses were treated prenatally. The main outcome measurement was fetal response to therapy as assessed by the rate of prenatal SVT reduction and by the mean time interval to sinus rhythm restoration.",

Stress in rats is also known to provoke increases in body temperature resulting in part from sympathetically mediated activation of brown fat. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of microinjection of BMI into the DMH on core body temperature and temperature of brown fat in rats. In anesthetized preparations, microinjection of BMI 10 pmol/50 nl into the DMH and adjoining posterior hypothalamus elicited marked and rapid increases in temperature in interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) and lesser delayed elevations in rectal temperature. Similar injections into the paraventricular nucleus or ventromedial hypothalamus had no effect on either parameter. Peak increases in IBAT were significantly correlated with both peak increases in core temperature and maximal increases in heart rate that accompanied these changes, and all of these effects were abolished by systemic treatment with propranolol 1 mg/kg. In conscious rats instrumented for telemetry, microinjection of BMI 10 pmol/100 nl into the DMH evoked marked increases in core temperature as well as heart rate, locomotor activity, and plasma ACTH. The increase in core temperature occurred with a delayed time course similar to that seen in anesthetized preparations. These results indicate that activation of neurons in the DMH provokes increases in body temperature resulting in large part from sympathoadrenally-mediated activation of brown fat.", 
    "53": "1. We found previously that propranolol augments hyperpnoea-induced bronchoconstriction (HIB). This study was performed to investigate the underlying mechanism of this aug- menting action of propranolol. 2. In the first series, 45 young Hartley guinea-pigs were divided into five groups: control; propranolol; adrenalectomy; metoprolol and reserpine. Each animal underwent three periods: baseline, hyperpnoea, and recovery. For each animal 1 ml of arterial blood was sampled during the baseline and recovery periods. 3. Treatments of propranolol, metoprolol, and reserpine caused significant decreases in both dynamic respiratory compliance (Crs) and forced expiratory volume in 0.1 s (FEV0.1) during the baseline period. Hyperpnoea caused slight but not significant decreases in Crs, FEV0.1, and maximal expiratory flow at 50% total lung capacity (TLC) (V(max50)) during the recovery period in the control group. Propranolol, but not other treatments, significantly augmented these decreases (indicating HIB). Plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline levels in the reserpine group were not detectable. The above treatments or hyperpnoea did not induce any significant effect on the plasma noradrenaline level. Plasma adrenaline level of the control group was higher than that of either adrenalectomy or reserpine group during the baseline and the recovery periods. 4. In the second series, we avoided repeated blood samplings. Forty-eight animals were evenly divided into two groups: control and propranolol. Each group was again evenly divided into three subgroups: baseline; hyperpnoea, and recovery. Five minutes into the recovery period, we demonstrated HIB in the control group. In terms of V(max50), this HIB was significantly augmented by propranolol. Plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline levels, however, were not significantly altered by either hyperpnoea or propranolol. 5. Taken together, these data suggest that propranolol-augmented HIB has no direct relationship with decreased catecholamine activity.",

As the prevalence and incidence of the disease are increasing, there is a clear need to improve the management of heart failure patients. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring with an implanted device is technically feasible and safe. It provides reliable information on central hemodynamic parameters and allows for analysis of long-term hemodynamic trends. It has been suggested that continuous hemodynamic monitoring might improve the management of patients with chronic heart failure. This article describes the technical details of the monitoring system and presents possible clinical applications, with a focus on beta-blocker therapy, diuretics, and volume management.

    "59": "50 patients with postinfarction cardiosclerosis and angina pectoris (functional class I-IV) having left ventricular ejection fraction < 45% entered a comparative cross-over trial of antianginal effectiveness of anaprilin and carvediolol (dilatrend). In 10 patients carvedilol was compared to placebo. Carvedilol is shown to demonstrate higher antianginal activity which is the highest in patients with angina pectoris of low load. The analysis of peripheral vascular resistance and double product attributes antianginal advantages of carvedilol to its more potent effect on cardiac performance due to peripheral vasodilatation.", 
    "60": "Glycogen synthase, an enzyme of historical importance in the field of reversible protein modification, is inactivated by phosphorylation and allosterically activated by glucose 6-phosphate (glucose-6-P). Previous analysis of yeast glycogen synthase had identified a conserved and highly basic 13-amino-acid segment in which mutation of Arg residues resulted in loss of activation by glucose-6-P. The equivalent mutations R578R579R581A (all three of the indicated Arg residues mutated to Ala) and R585R587R590A were introduced into rabbit muscle glycogen synthase. Whether expressed transiently in COS-1 cells or produced in and purified from Escherichia coli, both mutant enzymes were insensitive to activation by glucose-6-P. The effect of phosphorylation was studied in two ways. Purified, recombinant glycogen synthase was directly phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 and glycogen synthase kinase 3, under conditions that inactivate the wild-type enzyme. In addition, phosphorylation sites were converted to Ala by mutagenesis in wild-type and in the glucose-6-P desensitized mutants expressed in COS-1 cells. Phosphorylation inactivated the R578R579R581A mutant but had little effect on the R585R587R590A. This result was surprising since phosphorylation had the opposite effects on the corresponding yeast enzyme mutants. The results confirm that the region of glycogen synthase, Arg-578-Arg-590, is required for activation by glucose-6-P and suggest that it is part of a sensitive and critical switch involved in transitions between different conformational states. However, the role must differ subtly between the mammalian and the yeast enzymes.",

Experimental ocular hypertension was induced in albino rabbits by injecting alpha-chymotrypsin into the anterior chamber (alpha-chymotrypsin rabbit). The effects of the single application of CS-088 were examined. Additionally, CS-088 was repeatedly administered over a period of 3 weeks to hereditary ocular hypertensive rabbits (buphthalmic rabbits, JWHR bu/bu) and the IOPs were monitored throughout the experiment. The effects of CS-088 on aqueous humor dynamics were also examined in normal rabbits.

In contrast to PDGF-BB, which is the specific ligand for PDGF-beta receptors, ischemic death was not reduced by PDGF-AA, which does not activate the beta-receptors. The protective effect of PDGF-BB was blocked by tolbutamide, which is an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels and mimicked by the K(ATP) channel opener, pinacidil. Nifedipine, which blocks voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC's), also mimicked the protective effect of PDGF-BB. Consistent with PDGF-BB and nifedipine preventing cell death via a common mechanism, i.e., reducing VGCC activity, the maximal effects of this growth factor and the calcium channel blocker were not additive.", 
    "72": "Our results indicate that PDGF-BB significantly reduces the vulnerability of retinal microvessels to damage caused by profound ischemia. During episodes of metabolic compromise, it appears likely that the opening of K(ATP) channels via activation of PDGF-beta receptors initiates an adaptive mechanism to enhance the survival of the retinal microvasculature.", 
    "73": "Sibutramine is a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor that is effective for long-term weight reduction and maintenance in obese patients when used as an adjunct to dietary and behavioural measures. Because the inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake may be expected to increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and pulse rate (PR), a 12-week multi-centre, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sibutramine for weight loss in obese patients whose hypertension was well controlled (DBP < or = 95 mm Hg) by beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta-blockers), with or without concomitant thiazide diuretics. Of the 61 patients randomised to sibutramine 20 mg once daily or placebo, 55 patients (90%) completed the study. After 12 weeks, sibutramine-treated patients lost significantly more weight than placebo-treated patients: mean weight reductions were 4.2 kg (4.5%) in the sibutramine group vs 0.3 kg (0.4%) in the placebo group (P<0.001). Greater weight reduction on sibutramine was accompanied by trends for greater mean reductions in serum triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Sibutramine was well tolerated, and most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. No sibutramine patient discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. Mean supine and standing DBP and SBP were not statistically significantly different between the sibutramine group and the placebo group at any post-baseline visit during the 12-week trial. At week 12, mean increases from baseline supine SBP and DBP, respectively, were 1.6 and 1.7 mm Hg for the sibutramine group vs increases of 0.4 and 1.3 mm Hg for the placebo group. At week 12, mean increases from baseline standing SBP and DBP, respectively, were 1.5 and 1.8 mm Hg for the sibutramine group vs an increase of 0.3 and a decrease of 0.8 mm Hg for the placebo group (P > 0.05 for treatment comparison). A statistically significant mean increase of 5.6 bpm (+/-8.25, s.d.) in supine PR from a baseline of 62 bpm was reported in sibutramine-treated patients at week 12, whereas placebo-treated patients had a mean supine PR decrease of 2.2 bpm (+/-6.43) (P < 0.001). In summary, sibutramine was well tolerated and effective in weight reduction. The addition of sibutramine did not result in an increase in BP in obese patients whose hypertension was well controlled by a beta-blocker. However, based on the potential for changes in BP and PR, obese patients being treated with sibutramine should be monitored periodically for changes in BP and PR and managed appropriately.", 
    "74": "Knowledge about the conversion of the epithelium in the distal air spaces of the lung from secretion to absorption is imperative to the understanding of postnatal lung development; little such information is available in rats. Distal air space fluid clearance was therefore measured in 21- to 22-day gestation rat fetuses and newborn (40 h) rats. Distal air space fluid clearance was measured from the increase in (131)I-albumin concentration in an isosmolar, physiological solution instilled into the developing lungs. There was no net fluid movement across the distal air space epithelium in the lungs of 21-day gestation fetuses. Twenty-four hours later, distal air space fluid was cleared at a rapid rate in the 22-day gestation fetuses. Within the first 40 h after birth, the rate rapidly declined to adult levels. The high distal air space fluid clearance at 22 days gestation and at 40 h after birth was mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors as demonstrated by elevated plasma epinephrine levels and inhibition by propranolol. Interestingly, the elevated distal air space fluid clearance in the 22-day gestation fetuses was only minimally amiloride sensitive; however, amiloride sensitivity increased over the first 40 h after birth. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that 1) rapid rates of net alveolar fluid clearance occur late in gestation in the rat and 2) this clearance is driven by elevations of endogenous epinephrine.", 
    "75": "The objectives of our study were two fold: to examine enantioselective release of controlled delivery granules based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for various racemic drugs, including ibuprofen and ketoprofen (NSAIDs) and propranolol (beta-blockers); to evaluate the use of controlled delivery granules containing a combination of different MIPs for the multiple simultaneous enantioselective-controlled delivery of mixed racemic drugs. In this work, the MIP beads selective to S-Ibuprofen, S-ketoprofen, and R-propranolol were prepared using multistep swelling and thermal polymerization method. Afterward, the MIP beads were formulated with racemate of the chiral drugs and a binder and followed by granulation. Then, the enantioselective release of racemic drugs from the prepared MIP granules was investigated by an in vitro dissolution test using a chiral HPLC for assays of enantiomers. The influence of drug/polymer ratio and medium pH on the selective enantiomeric release of MIP granules was explored. Further, the release of the enantiomers of racemic ibuprofen and racemic ketoprofen from the granule containing two MIPs - S-ibuprofen MIP and S-ketoprofen MIP - was examined. The release profiles of both S-ibuprofen MIP granule and R-propranolol MIP granule exhibited differential release of enantiomers. Also, the findings indicated the stereoselective retardation of those controlled delivery granules as well as the influence of MIP formulation on enantioselective release mechanism. The enantioselective release of S-ibuprofen MIP granule and R-propranolol MIP granule appeared to depend on polymer loading and medium pH. In this case, the drug/polymer ratio of 1:25 showed the best enantioselective release with initial enantiomeric excess of 100%. On the other hand, the enantioselectivity of both granules was the greatest in buffer pH 7.4. Furthermore, the efficiency in enantioselective release of the combined MIP granule was higher than its relative single MIP granules, as a result of the cross-reactivities of the MIPs. In our study, controlled delivery granules based on MIPs demonstrated significant enantioselective release for several chiral drugs, and thus it may be developed as a tool to administer chiral pharmaceutical as a single enantiomer.", 
    "76": "We describe a 23-year-old woman with a 3-week history of episodic leg weakness. The onset of weakness always occurred in the evening after dinner and the attacks resolved spontaneously by morning. Physical examination revealed a resting tachycardia and symmetrical, proximal weakness involving both arms and legs. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrolyte analysis showed a severe hypokalemia and thyroid function tests showed hyperthyroidism. The patient was diagnosed as having Graves' thyrotoxicosis and thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) and was initially treated with propranolol and subsequently carbimazole. No recurrence of the paralysis has been noted. TPP is most common in males of Asian extraction and is rare in women even in the Asian population. With increasing immigration, TPP is likely to occur more frequently in both Europe and North America and awareness of the condition is vital. Treatment of the underlying thyroid dysfunction cures the muscle symptoms.", 
    "77": "Given the great relevance of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction, we focused our attention on this therapy, considering also the difficulty of its management: it takes a long time to up titrate as well as to wash out. Other anti-ischemic therapies, i.e. nitroderivatives and calcium-antagonists, are easier to manage and there is less need of precise schedules. Our belief is that predischarge exercise testing should be performed on beta-blocker therapy, since we deem unadvisable to interrupt this treatment in the early phase of the postinfarction clinical course, and the reasons are detailed in the text. After myocardial infarction, beta-blockers may reduce the sensitivity of predischarge exercise testing for the diagnosis of inducible ischemia; however, their interference does not seem to affect negatively the prognostic stratification of the test, also in the \"thrombolytic era\". This may be true since beta-blockers hide, but also cure, those forms of inducible ischemia of lower clinical importance, and only inducible ischemia occurring in spite of such therapy might be dangerous and should be treated with myocardial revascularization. Patients receiving thrombolytic treatment are a selected minority at lower clinical risk; it is necessary to emphasize that predischarge exercise testing is more frequently positive in these patients, probably because of the presence of residual stenosis of the infarct-related vessel that may often have a trivial relevance. The test has a lower negative predictive value in these patients, mainly for the higher incidence of reinfarction and ischemic events related to plaque instability, events that none of the provocative tests can predict accurately.",

    "79": "Thirty-seven patients in NYHA functional class III-IV with LV ejection fraction < 45% and a mean age of 76 +/- 6 years were prospectively studied. They received carvedilol which was associated with conventional therapy for CHF (ACE-inhibitors + diuretics + digitalis). The changes over time in clinical and echocardiographic variables (evaluated at baseline and every 6 months) were compared with those of 23 patients treated with the sole conventional therapy.", 
    "80": "During a follow-up of 13 +/- 8 months, 5 patients interrupted carvedilol due to side effects (tolerability 87%). Among the 32 remaining patients, 8 died. NYHA functional class improved in the 56% of survivors, LV ejection fraction increased (30 to 42%, p = 0.0002), mitral regurgitation and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure markedly decreased (2.0 to 1.0, p = 0.0001, and 19 to 13 mmHg, p = 0.0004, respectively). None of these variables was changed at the end of follow-up in the control group. Mortality was similar between the carvedilol (25%) and control group (22%).", 
    "81": "In the very elderly patients with LV systolic dysfunction and CHF carvedilol is well tolerated and safe. The addition of this drug to conventional therapy for CHF provides an important improvement in functional class, LV function and hemodynamics.", 
    "82": "Despite therapeutic advances in heart failure treatment, this syndrome still presents a poor prognosis, with a relevant mortality due to both systolic dysfunction progression and sudden death. Sudden cardiac death appears to be relatively more frequent in less compromised patients (NYHA functional class I) but in absolute numbers it is more frequent in more functionally compromised patients. The ability to predict sudden cardiac events with current available tests is poor, with the possible exception of electrophysiological test in ischemic cardiomyopathy. The risk of sudden death is proven to be increased in more advanced cardiac dysfunction and frequently the acute event can be precipitated by ischemia. Therefore the best approach in the prevention of sudden cardiac death may well be the proper treatment of ischemia and cardiac dysfunction. Beta-blockers have demonstrated a favorable effect in the prevention of sudden cardiac death. ACE-inhibitors can significantly reduce global death in heart failure patients, but their impact on sudden death appears to be limited. The same may be true for angiotensin II blockers. Diuretics have generally been demonstrated to increase sudden death, possibly via electrolyte imbalance; this may explain why spironolactone has a pronounced impact in reducing sudden death. Inotropes, in spite of their good effect on refractory heart failure and their usefulness in the compassionate care of terminally ill heart failure patients, have demonstrated an increase in sudden cardiac death. The same holds true for digoxin, in spite of its ability to reduce death due to heart failure deterioration. Antiarrhythmic drugs, with the possible exception of amiodarone, have demonstrated an unfavorable effect on sudden death incidence.", 
    "83": "Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardio (GISSI)-Prevenzione was conceived as a population, pragmatic trial on patients with recent myocardial infarctions conducted in the framework of the Italian public health system. In GISSI-Prevenzione, patients were invited to follow Mediterranean dietary habits, and were treated with up-to-date preventive pharmacological interventions. Long-term n-3 PUFA (1 g daily) but not vitamin E (300 mg daily) was beneficial for death and for combined death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. All the benefit, however, was attributable to the decrease in risk for overall, cardiovascular, cardiac, coronary, and sudden death. At variance with the orientation of a scientific scenario largely dominated by the \"cholesterol-heart hypothesis,\" GISSI-Prevenzione results indicate n-3 PUFA (virtually devoid of any cholesterol-lowering effect) as a relevant pharmacological treatment for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. As to the relevance and comparability of GISSI-Prevenzione results, up to 5.7 lives could be saved every 1000 patients with previous myocardial infarction treated with n-3 PUFA (1 g daily) per year. Such a result is comparable to that observed in the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) trial, where 5.2 lives could be saved per 1000 hypercholesterolemic, coronary heart disease patients treated with pravastatin for 1 yr. The choice of a relatively low-dose regimen (1-g capsule daily) more acceptable for long-term treatment in a population of patients following Mediterranean dietary habits, and the pattern of effects seen in GISSI-Prevenzione (namely, reduction of overall mortality with no decrease in the rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction) all strongly suggest that n-3 PUFA treatment should be considered a recommended new component of secondary prevention. The importance of this combined/additive effect is further suggested by the analyses of the interplay between diet and n-3 PUFA: There is an interesting direct correlation between size of the effect and \"correctness\" of background diets. It can be anticipated that a conceptual barrier must be overcome: A \"dietary drug\" should be added to \"dietary advice,\" which remains fundamental to allow this statement to become true in clinical practice.", 
    "84": "Background: In patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), secondary preventive drug therapy improves overall prognosis. Therefore, this study evaluated cardiovascular drug utilization in patients suffering from IHD, identified factors influencing drug utilization, and determined the prevalence of shortfalls of antithrombotic, beta-blocker, and lipid-lowering drug use. Methods: This study is based on data recorded prospectively between 1996 and 1998 in two Swiss teaching hospitals for the SAS/CHDM pharmacoepidemiologic database project. Drug utilization was evaluated in all 987 monitored medical inpatients with IHD. Results: At discharge, only 64% of patients with IHD received platelet aggregation inhibitors, 42% beta-blockers, and 26% lipid-lowering drugs. Secondary preventive drugs were more frequently administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction and less frequently in the elderly. After including other co-factors, no gender difference could be detected. Shortfalls of antithrombotic therapy occurred in 6.5--8.3% of patients and shortfalls in beta-blocker use in 9.9--23.3%. Only about half of all patients with IHD and elevated cholesterol received lipid-lowering drugs. Conclusions: Drugs for secondary prevention are prescribed to the majority of patients with IHD. However, their use could be further increased, especially in the elderly and in patients with IHD who are admitted to the hospital for reasons other than acute myocardial infarction. Lipid-lowering drugs should also be prescribed more often for patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "85": "In hypertensive patients, pulse pressure has been related to hypertension-induced target organ damage and risk of cardiovascular events. However, correlates of pulse pressure reduction during antihypertensive treatment have been less extensively investigated. We related pulse pressure changes to clinical and echocardiographic findings before and after 2 years of antihypertensive treatment in 767 patients aged 55 to 80 years (mean 66) in the Losartan Intervention For End point reduction in hypertension study. Over 2 years, blood pressure and pulse pressure were reduced from 173/98 to 147/84 mm Hg and from 75 to 63 mm Hg, respectively, both p <0.001. In linear multivariate analysis controlling for initial pulse pressure, 2-year reduction in pulse pressure correlated negatively with age and concomitant diabetes mellitus, and positively with body height and 2-year reduction in mean blood pressure (multiple R(2) = 0.42, p <0.01). When dividing the study population into 2 groups using a prognostically validated partition for pulse pressure, patients with pulse pressure > or =63 mm Hg after 2 years of antihypertensive treatment (n = 349) were older and shorter, included more women and patients with isolated systolic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, albuminuria, and echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline, and also had a smaller decrease in mean blood pressure and the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio over 2 years (all p <0.05). Thus, in hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, older age, less reduction in mean blood pressure, concomitant diabetes mellitus, and shorter stature are associated with attenuated pulse pressure reduction during antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "86": "We sought to determine whether beta-adrenergic agonists enhance the brain extraction of L-dopa and L-leucine. Systemic administration of beta-adrenergic agonists increase brain concentrations of L-dopa and other large neutral amino acids (LNAA) in rats and monkeys and may improve symptoms and reduce daily L-dopa requirement in patients with Parkinson's disease. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) using [3H]nicotine and the extraction fraction of 14C-labeled L-dopa or L-leucine were measured simultaneously in various brain regions of conscious rats using the dual-isotope indicator fractionation technique after intraperitoneal administration of isoproterenol (a peripheral nonselective beta-adrenergic agonist), or clenbuterol (a beta2-adrenergic agonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier), or beta-adrenergic agonist preceded by nadolol (a peripheral nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist), or saline vehicle. Both beta-adrenergic agonists increased regional brain extraction fraction of L-dopa and L-leucine tracers by 35-45%, without altering regional CBF. These changes were accompanied by about a 30% decrease in plasma branched chain LNAA concentrations. Nadolol blocked all these effects. beta-Adrenergic agonists increase the brain extraction of L-dopa and leucine, mainly by peripheral mechanisms that reduce the levels of other competing plasma LNAAs for transport. Thus, beta-adrenergic agonists might be useful in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease by enhancing delivery of L-dopa to the brain.", 
    "87": "The disposition of the beta-blocking drug talinolol is controlled by P-glycoprotein in man. Because talinolol is marketed as a racemate, we reevaluated the serum-concentration time profiles of talinolol of a previously published study with single intravenous (30 mg) and repeated oral talinolol (100 mg for 14 days) before and after comedication of rifampicin (600 mg per day for 9 days) in eight male healthy volunteers (age 22-26 years, body weight 67-84 kg) with respect to differences in the kinetic profiles of the two enantiomers S(-) talinolol and R(+) talinolol. Additionally, the metabolism of talinolol in human liver microsomes was examined. After oral administration, S(-) talinolol was slightly less absorbed and faster eliminated than R(+) talinolol. The absolute bioavailabilty of the R(+) enantiomer of talinolol was slightly but significantly higher than of its S(-) enantiomer. Coadministration of rifampicin further intensified this difference in the disposition of R(+) and S(-) talinolol (p < 0.05). Formation of 4-trans hydroxytalinolol was the major metabolic pathway in human liver microsomes. All Cl(int) values of S(-) were higher than of R(+) talinolol; 0.1 microM ketoconazole inhibited the formation of all metabolites. In conclusion, the stereoselectivity of talinolol disposition is of minor importance, and most likely caused by presystemic biotransformation via CYP3A4. The less active R(+) talinolol might be suitable for phenotyping P-glycoprotein expression in man.",

    "100": "Ventricular fibrillation (VF) in conscious rats with coronary artery ligation occurs in two phases, before (phase 1) and after (phase 2) 90 min of ischaemia respectively. The mechanisms of phase 2 VF are not established. Interestingly, phase 2 VF is absent in isolated (denervated) buffer-perfused rat hearts. We investigated whether catecholamine supplementation (to mimic sympathetic drive) was sufficient to restore phase 2 VF in such hearts. Isolated rat hearts (n=10 per group) underwent coronary ligation for 240 min. At 90 min, during a period of relative electrical stability, the perfusion solution was switched from standard (Krebs) to identical solution or Krebs containing catecholamines (313 nM noradrenaline and 75 nM adrenaline) with or without 10 microM trimazosin (an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist) or 10 microM atenolol (a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist). Although in all groups the incidence of phase 1 VF was high (80 - 100%), the temporal distribution of VF was monophasic, i.e. only one heart in one group developed phase 2 VF (P=NS). Other ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., tachycardia; VT) exhibited a similar temporal distribution. Nevertheless, haemodynamic changes confirmed sympathomimetic effects of catecholamines, e.g., heart rate was increased from 278+/-7 beats min(-1) in controls to 335+/-8 beats min(-1) (P<0.05) by catecholamines, an effect that could be blocked by atenolol (285+/-7 beats min(-1)) but not by trimazosin (342+/-12 beats min(-1)). Coronary flow was correspondingly increased from 7.7+/-0.7 ml min(-1) g(-1) to 16.5+/-1.3 ml min(-1) g(-1) (P<0.05); this effect could be blocked by atenolol (8.1+/-0.6 ml min(-1) g(-1)) and was enhanced by trimazosin (20.7+/-2.4 ml min(-1) g(-1)). In conclusion, despite evidence of adequate alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor activation, catecholamine supplementation to isolated buffer-perfused rat hearts was insufficient to restore phase 2 VF. It therefore appears unlikely that catecholamines alone mediate phase 2 VF.", 
    "101": "The recent development of mice doubly deficient for monoamine oxidase A and B (MAO-A/B, respectively) has raised questions about the impact of these mutations on cardiovascular function, in so far as these animals demonstrate increased tissue levels of the vasoactive amines serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and phenylethylamine. We recorded femoral arterial pressures and electrocardiograms in adult MAO-A/B-deficient mice during halothane-nitrous oxide anesthesia as well as 30 min postoperatively. During both anesthesia and recovery, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures were 10-15 mmHg lower in MAO-A/B-deficient mice compared with normal controls (P < 0.01). Mutants also showed a greater baroreceptor-mediated reduction in heart rate in response to hypertension after intravenous pulses of phenylephrine or angiotensin II. Tachycardia elicited in response to hypotension after nitroprusside was greater in mutants than in controls. Heart rate responsiveness to changes in arterial pressure was abolished after administration of glycopyrrolate, with no differences in this phenomenon noted between genotypes. These data suggest that prevention of hypertension may occur in chronic states of catecholaminergic/indoleaminergic excess by increased gain of the baroreflex.", 
    "102": "This study was designed to investigate whether cocaine can exacerbate viral myocarditis and increase its incidence. Recent clinical evidence suggests that cocaine abuse increases the incidence of myocarditis. However, it has not been directly demonstrated that cocaine exposure enhances murine myocarditis. BALB/c mice were divided into eight groups: saline control, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), 10 mg/kg cocaine (Coc-10), 30 mg/kg cocaine (Coc-30), 50 mg/kg cocaine (Coc-50), EMCV+Coc-10, EMCV+Coc-30, EMCV+Coc-50. After inoculation with EMCV, the mice were treated daily with either cocaine or saline for 90 days. Mice were euthanized at different days after EMCV inoculation. Mortality was recorded and myocarditis severity was evaluated. The mortality of the myocarditis mice treated with cocaine increased significantly, from 22% (EMCV) to 25.7% (Coc-10+EMCV), 41.4% (Coc-30+EMCV), and 51.4% (Coc-50+EMCV) (P < 0.05), respectively. The incidence and severity of inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial lesions was higher in infected mice exposed to cocaine. Cocaine administered only before infection did not exacerbate myocarditis. Norepinephrine (NE) assay showed that cocaine exposure significantly increased myocardial NE concentration but this increase was partially inhibited in infected animals. Adrenalectomy abolished the effect of cocaine on mortality. Furthermore, propranolol, a beta-blocker, significantly decreased the enhancing effects of cocaine on myocarditis mice. In conclusion, cocaine increases the severity and mortality of viral myocarditis in mice. Increased catecholamines may be a major factor responsible for this effect.", 
    "103": "Short-term stimulation of beta-receptors is known to affect cardiac ion channels; however, the impact of longer-term stimulation on intrinsic channel function is poorly understood. To evaluate this, cultured guinea pig ventricular myocytes were exposed to isoproterenol (10 nM), vehicle, or isoproterenol plus propranolol (1 microM) for 48 h. Sustained exposure to isoproterenol decreased the density of the inward rectifier (I(K1)), slow delayed rectifier (I(Ks)), and L-type Ca2+ (I(Ca L)) currents, effects that were fully prevented by propranolol. Changes in K+ currents were prevented by the beta1-selective antagonist CGP-20712A, unaffected by the beta2-antagonist ICI-118,551, and mimicked by the membrane-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP. Isoproterenol did not alter the current-voltage relationship of the K+ currents but increased the density of T-type Ca2+ current (I(Ca T)) and thereby increased the proportion of the total Ca2+ current at more negative potentials. We conclude that sustained exposure to isoproterenol reduces I(K1), I(Ks), and I(Ca L) density and increases the density of I(Ca T). The direct ionic current remodeling effects of sustained beta-adrenoceptor stimulation resemble changes reported with heart failure and may be important in arrhythmogenic ionic remodeling.", 
    "104": "This study examined skeletal muscle microvessel reactivity to constrictor stimuli in obese (OZR) versus lean Zucker rats (LZR). Gracilis arteries from both rat groups were isolated, cannulated with glass micropipettes, and viewed via television microscopy. Changes in vessel diameter were measured with a video micrometer. Arterial constriction to norepinephrine was elevated in OZR versus LZR, although vasoconstrictor reactivity to endothelin and angiotensin II was unaltered. Differences in reactivity between vessels of LZR and OZR were not explained by the loss of either endothelial nitric oxide synthase or beta-adrenergic receptor function. Reactivity of in situ cremasteric arterioles of OZR to norepinephrine was elevated versus LZR. Treatment with prazosin increased the diameter of in vivo gracilis arteries of OZR to levels determined in LZR and also normalized blood pressure in OZR. These results suggest that the constrictor reactivity of skeletal muscle microvessels in OZR is heightened in response to alpha-adrenergic stimuli and that development of diabetes in OZR may be associated with impaired skeletal muscle perfusion and hypertension due to microvessel hyperreactivity in response to sympathetic stimulation.",

Intracisternal pretreatment with methysergide (nonspecific 5-HT receptor antagonist) or combined cyanopindolol (5-HT(1A and 1B) receptor antagonist)+ritanserin (receptor antagonist of the 5-HT(2) family) did not alter the dorsal vagal complex-RX 77368 response. Unilateral dorsal vagal complex pretreatment with methiothepin (50 nmol/50 nl) attenuated ipsilateral dorsal vagal complex-TRH analog (12 pmol) induced gastric secretory response by 57%. The gastric secretagogue response to stimulation of the raphe obscurus (mediated by TRH release into the dorsal vagal complex) was inhibited 50% by pretreatment with intracisternal dorsal medullary methiothepin (0.1 nmol/10 microl). Intracisternal methiothepin (200 nmol/20 microl) also attenuated (a) dorsal vagal complex-glutamate (60 nmol/30 nl) stimulated gastric acid secretion and (b) gastric motility stimulated by dorsal vagal complex-RX 77368 (12 pmol/30 nl).

    "110": "We are reporting on a 46-year-old man who has suffered of muscle cramps for 4 years, occurring immediately after jogging and playing tennis and lasting for 7-8 hours. Repeated neurological, orthopedic, internal medical and endocrinological examinations showed no pathological findings. Physiotherapy, supplementation of fluids and electrolytes had no effect, nor did medication therapy with muscle relaxants. During spiroergometry without medication, there was an overproportional increase of heart rate and respiratory rate with delayed pCO2 increase after exercise with otherwise normal blood gas levels. This reaction was considerably reduced during spiroergometry under beta-blockade (metoprolol 100 mg); at the same time, the muscle cramps could no longer be induced. Both excessive respiratory regulation and direct hyperadrenergic stimulation should be discussed as the primary cause of the muscle cramps. According to recent findings, b-blockers with intrinsic sympathocomimetic activity should be avoided in therapy.", 
    "111": "The action of orexin A on one-way passive avoidance learning was studied in rats. Orexin A administered into the lateral brain ventricle in conscious rats facilitated learning, the consolidation of learning and also retrieval processes in a dose-dependent manner in a passive avoidance paradigm. The involvement of transmitters was studied by pretreating the animals with receptor antagonists, which had proved to be effective with other neuropeptides in attenuating or blocking the action of orexin A. The following receptor blockers were used: haloperidol, phenoxybenzamine, propranolol, atropine, bicuculline, naloxone and nitro-L-arginine, which can block nitric oxide synthase. In the doses used all of the receptor blockers attenuated, but none of them fully blocked the action of orexin A on the consolidation of passive avoidance learning. The results demonstrate that orexin A is able to facilitate learning, consolidation of learning and also retrieval processes in a passive avoidance paradigm. A number of transmitters could be involved in the action of consolidation, but none of them is absolutely essential.",

We evaluated the contribution of endogenous bradykinin to tumor-associated angiogenesis and tumor growth using pharmacological approaches in mice bearing sarcoma 180 cells. The weight of implanted tumors increased in parallel with increased hemoglobin contents (a parameter to evaluate angiogenesis) over a 20-day experimental period. Daily administration of bradykinin B2-receptor antagonists, Hoe140 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg per day, local injection) or FR173657 (30 mg/kg per day, p.o.), significantly suppressed the increment in angiogenesis and tumor weight, but a B1-receptor antagonist, desArg10-Hoe140 (1 mg/kgperday), did not. Administration of a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, soybean trypsin inhibitor (3 mg/site per day), significantly suppressed angiogenesis and tumor growth. In contrast, bradykinin-degrading enzyme inhibitors, captopril and phosphoramidon (500 microg/site per day), enhanced angiogenesis and increased tumor weight. Our results suggest that bradykinin, produced by plasma kallikrein or plasma kallikrein-like enzymes, promote tumor-associated angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo.",

Between May 1997 and March 2000, 6 patients with an average age of 34 years (range 17-55 years) had a cardiac arrest on admission requiring emergency cardiac massage and emergency intubation with ventilatory assistance following massive ingestion of cardiotoxic drugs. Echocardiography confirmed complete biventricular akinesia. The surgical team implanted a cardiovascular assist device (ECMO: Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation) by the femoral approach with pre-heparinated percutaneous cannula. The first two patients died of multi-organ failure due to a delay in the installation of the assistance. The 4 other patients survived without sequellae or recurrences. The average time on ECMO was 59.25 +/- 2 hours (range 48-71 hours). The early recognition of the indication for ECMO was one of the most important predictive factors for morbidity and mortality. The strategy of patient management should be determined in the emergency room: in cases of cardiocirculatory arrest resistant to symptomatic treatment (stomach washout, intravenous fluids, isoprenaline, inotropic agents) an echocardiogram should be obtained and the cardiac surgical team alerted to the problem. The introduction of pre-heparinated circuits, percutaneous cannula and peripheral shunts has widened the indications, efficacy (detoxification, restoration of peripheral tissue perfusion) and accessibility to this material, while limiting its duration. The collaboration of experienced multidisciplinary teams (emergency room staff, cardiologists, anaesthetists and surgeons) should optimise the timing of implantation and the monitoring of these systems and improve the results of resuscitation of these patients.",

Stringent dosing guidelines calling for a 1-hour observation period after initiation or up-titration of beta-blocker therapy might limit the use of beta blockers and increase the expense involved. This study was conducted to determine the usefulness of this observation period. Data were collected from 130 in-clinic postdosing observation periods for 34 stable chronic heart failure patients started on carvedilol. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.22\u00b10.09, and the mean functional class was 2.5\u00b10.6. No patient had greater than first-degree heart block. Carvedilol was started at 3.125 or 6.25 mg b.i.d., and the dose was doubled every 1-3 weeks. All patients were observed for 1-2 hours after initiation or dosage increase, and blood pressure and heart rate were measured hourly. The maximal daily dose was 50\u00b131 mg. In none of the observation periods was there a decrease in the dose of beta blockers administered in the clinic. The predosing mean blood pressure was 110\u00b115/71\u00b110 mm Hg, and the mean heart rate was 78\u00b113 bpm; the 1-hour postdosing mean blood pressure was 101\u00b114/67\u00b110 mm Hg (p is less than 0.001), and the heart rate was 78\u00b113 bpm. The dose was decreased in six patients and medication was discontinued in three, all consequent to symptoms reported several days after dosage increase.

    "124": "Hyperkalemia is not an uncommon occurrence in the congestive heart failure patient, particularly when renal failure coexists. Hyperkalemia in CHF is typically medication-related. Its occurrence is inevitably linked to the simultaneous ingestion of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, and more recently, aldosterone receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone. The most devastating consequence of hyperkalemia is its cardiotoxicity that can be fairly insidious in its rate of development. The therapy of hyperkalemia in congestive heart failure can involve both acute and semiacute management phases. Acute hyperkalemia management includes measures that block the adverse membrane effects of hyperkalemia, such as intravenous calcium administration, and efforts to shift potassium intracellularly, such as occurs with intravenous bicarbonate and/or inhaled beta-agonists. Semiacute management of hyperkalemia includes measures to increase urinary potassium excretion and administration of binding resins, such as Kayexalate\u00ae. Prevention is the cornerstone of hyperkalemia management in the heart failure patient and requires that careful attention be directed to both identifying exogenous sources of potassium and pinpointing the maximum tolerable dose of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker.

This was due to impaired transmyocardial (Ao-Cs) O(2) extraction rather than limitations in CBF responses. There was an associated shift in myocardial metabolism, evidenced by an increased preference for glycolytic substrates (Respiratory Quotient) following administration of any of these three adrenergic agonists in DCM. Combined beta(1)/beta(2) stimulation with ISO or beta(2)-AR stimulation (ISO+MET) in DCM resulted in greater M(v)O(2/beat), [(Ao-Cs) O(2)] extraction, and decreases in myocardial RQ consistent with a shift toward oxidation of FFA.",

    "134": "Single-drug therapy remains the preferred way to begin treatment of hypertension, although in many patients this is unable to bring blood pressure (BP) to goal levels. Single-drug therapy, even when maximally titrated, is at best only modestly effective in normalising BP in Stage-I or II hypertension, which represents the majority of the hypertensive population. It is increasingly appreciated that the elusive goal of a 'normal' BP is achieved only if multi-drug therapy is employed. This is especially so when considered in the context of today's lower BP goals. The options for multi-drug therapy are quite simple: either fixed-dose combination therapy or drugs added sequentially one after another to then arrive at an effective multi-drug regimen. Advocates exist for both approaches. A considerable legacy, dating to the 1950's, exists for fixed-dose combination therapies. The rationale to this approach has remained constant. Fixed-dose combination therapy successfully reduces BP because two drugs, each typically working at a separate site, block different effector pathways. In addition, the second drug of such two-drug combinations may check counter-regulatory system activity triggered by the other. For example, a diuretic and beta-blocker combination may find the diuretic correcting the salt-and-water retention which occasionally accompanies beta-blocker therapy. The pattern of adverse effects also differs with fixed-dose combination therapy, in part, because less drug is generally being given. In addition, one component of a fixed-dose combination therapy can effectively counterbalance the tendency of the other to produce adverse effects. For example, the peripheral oedema, that accompanies calcium channel antagonist therapy, occurs less frequently when an ACE inhibitor is co-administered. ACE inhibitors improve, if not eliminate, the peripheral oedema associated with calcium channel antagonists because of their proven ability to cause venodilation. In addition, diuretic therapy-induced volume contraction may generate a state of secondary hyperaldosteronism and thereby electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalaemia and/or hypomagnesaemia. In many cases, the co-administration of either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker with a diuretic corrects the aforementioned electrolyte disturbances. Fixed-dose combination therapy has a proven record of reducing BP. This form of treatment has been available for close to a half-century. Over that period of time, many physicians have taken advantage of this therapeutic approach even when academic opinion was less than charitable to this concept. Academic opinion is rarely immutable and occasionally irrelevant to prescription practice. Prescription practice is driven by many considerations including ease of use, cost and tolerance of a therapy. Most importantly, the therapeutic pathway taken should successfully result in goal BP being reached in a large number of those treated. Unfortunately, despite the simplicity of the concept behind fixed-dose combination therapy, its success will ultimately rest on cost. If made truly cost-competitive, it will gain an increasing share of the hypertensive market. If not, market forces will relegate it to a secondary role for hypertension treatment.",

The basic treatment involves administration of negatively inotropic drugs (beta-blockers and/or verapamil), which reduce the intraventricular pressure gradient and have a positive impact on the symptomatology. In patients refractory or intolerant to medicamentous treatment surgical or catheterization is used. Percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation reduces significantly the symptomatology of dyspnoea and stenocardia, increases load tolerance and improves the left ventricular diastolic function.

Mean follow-up was 15 months. Rebleeding occurred in 6 (13%) TIPS-treated patients versus 17 (39%) drug-treated patients (P =.007). The 2-year rebleeding probability was 13% versus 49% (P =.01). A similar number of reinterventions were required in the 2 groups; these were mainly angioplasty +/- restenting in the TIPS group (90 of 98) and endoscopic therapy for rebleeding in the medical group (45 of 62) (not significant). Encephalopathy was more frequent in TIPS than in drug-treated patients (38% vs. 14%, P =.007). Child-Pugh class improved more frequently in drug-treated than in TIPS-treated patients (72% vs. 45%; P =.04). The 2-year survival probability was identical (72%). The identified cost of therapy was double for TIPS-treated patients. In summary, medical therapy was less effective than TIPS in preventing rebleeding. However, it caused less encephalopathy, identical survival, and more frequent improvement in Child-Pugh class with lower costs than TIPS in high-risk cirrhotic patients. This suggests that TIPS should not be used as a first-line treatment, but as a rescue for failures of medical/endoscopic treatments (first-option therapies).",

After 1 month of adjunctive treatment, patients who failed to meet a target 15% reduction in IOP at peak drug effect were crossed over to the other study medication. The target sample size of 51/group gave a power of 0.80 to detect a difference of 1 mmHg in mean IOP lowering between groups.",

    "143": "Mean beta-blocker-treated baseline IOP was comparable between treatment groups (approximately 21.3 mm Hg). After 1 month of adjunctive therapy, brimonidine and latanoprost provided comparable IOP lowering (4.88 mmHg [22.8%] with brimonidine and 5.01 mmHg [23.5%] with latanoprost, P = 0.798). Response rates were similar in both groups, with 44 of 54 brimonidine patients and 43 of 53 latanoprost patients achieving the minimum target 15% IOP reduction at peak drug effect at month 1 (P = 0.963). Among patients who were successful at month 1 and continued on the initial study medication, mean IOP reductions were 4.55 mmHg with brimonidine and 5.49 mmHg with latanoprost (P = 0.149) at month 3. There was no significant difference in the ability of brimonidine and latanoprost to maintain at least a 15% additional reduction in IOP for 3 months (28 of 38 patients on brimonidine vs. 30 of 36 patients on latanoprost achieved > or =15% IOP reduction at month 3; P = 0.314). Patients in the latanoprost group were more likely to report negative quality-of-life variables than patients in the brimonidine group. Significantly more latanoprost patients reported watery or teary eyes (34 of 53, 64.2% vs. 23 of 54, 42.6% with brimonidine; P = 0.025) and hands and feet that became cold easily (24 of 53, 45.3% vs. 12 of 54, 22.2% with brimonidine; P = 0.012).",

    "145": "Immediately after an experimental spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats, there is a large fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), followed by an abrupt increase in MAP. To better understand the mechanism involved in these early cardiovascular alterations, we tested the effect of treatment with ganglionic and sympathetic blockers in anesthetized rats subjected to T-5 SCI. Fall in MAP was partially diminished by propranolol and pentolinium, while increase in MAP was abolished by propranolol and pentolinium. Adrenalectomy did not diminish the fall in MAP and HR, however, the increase in MAP was significantly reduced. Likewise, propranolol and pentolinium completely abolished the effects in HR. These data suggest that the early cardiovascular alterations secondary to SCI results from an increased parasympathetic activity and a sympathetic withdrawal.", 
    "146": "The stereoselectivity of beta3-adrenoceptors, the effect of a beta-adrenoceptor alkylating agent, and the structure-activity relationship at beta3-adrenoceptors were investigated on the guinea pig gastric fundus. Isomeric activity ratios ((+)/(-)) for isomers of isoprenaline and noradrenaline were 20.9-fold and 43.7-fold, respectively, and were less than those obtained for activation of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors in the guinea pig atria and trachea, respectively. The concentration-response curves to the catecholamines ((-)-isoprenaline, (-)-noradrenaline, and (-)-adrenaline), the selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL37344 ((R*,R*)-(+/-)-4-[2-[(2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]propyl]phenoxyacetic acid sodium), and the nonconventional partial beta3-adrenoceptor agonist (+/-)-CGP12177A ((+/-)-[4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl) amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one] hydrochloride) were resistant to blockade by (+/-)-pindobind (10 microM), the beta-adrenoceptor alkylating agent. Furthermore, (+/-)-nadolol, which belongs to the aryloxypropanolamine class and has beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonistic characteristics, displays agonistic activity at beta3-adrenoceptors. These results indicate that pharmacological characteristics of the beta3-adrenoceptors of guinea pig gastric fundus differ from those of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. (-)-Noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline were more potent than dopamine and (-)-phenylephrine, respectively. In addition, dobutamine was 22-fold more potent than dopamine. These results suggest that the 4-hydroxyl group at the catechol ring and the beta-hydroxyl group and the large moiety on the alkylamine chain characterized efficacy at beta3-adrenoceptors.",

Fructose feeding also increased urinary excretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine, the density of cardiac alpha1-adrenergic receptors, and the content of angiotensin II in the left ventricle. All antihypertensive drugs decreased systolic BP, but only the AT1 receptor antagonist attenuated the development of LVH in FFR. The AT1 receptor antagonist did not affect glucose-mediated insulin responses, but did suppress urinary catecholamine excretion and cardiac alpha1-adrenergic receptor density.",

Use of an AT1 receptor antagonist might be the most beneficial way to prevent progression of LVH through direct effects on tissue RAS and the sympathetic nervous system in FFR. As these changes occur in a rat model with hyperinsulinemia, insulin may have a role in promoting LVH by activating the local RAS and sympathetic nervous system activity.",

Because of their anionic nature and large number of acid groups, they tend to interact with cationic substances, and with other hydrophilic polymers containing alcohol groups. Here, we report a study of interactions between the carbomer Carbopol and the cationic drug propranolol hydrochloride in the solid state and in solution, and of the effects of such interactions on the properties of the hydrogel. We found that the drug forms an insoluble ionic complex with the polymer, modifying all of the hydrogel properties studied (swelling, release, bioadhesion). The inclusion of beta-cyclodextrin in the formulation reduces polymer/drug interactions, so that hydrogel properties remain unchanged. This is probably attributable to formation of inclusion complexes of beta-cyclodextrin and the drug, so that the drug is prevented from interacting with the polymer.",

In the present study, we compared the effects of restraint stress and norepinephrine on small intestinal motility using alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists. SR59230A did not recover the norepinephrine-induced inhibition of small intestinal motility. The norepinephrine-induced inhibition of small intestinal motility was recovered after administration of the alpha2-antagonist yohimbine, but not by alpha1-, beta1-, and beta2-antagonists. Considering these results, it is reasonable to assume that the mechanisms of inhibition of small intestinal motility due to restraint stress and norepinephrine treatment are different.", 
    "153": "Intracarotid infusions of noradrenaline (0.3 nmol.kg(-1) x min(-1)) stimulated salivary fluid secretion and caused increases in salivary concentrations of protein, potassium. magnesium. chloride and phosphate, and decreases in bicarbonate. These effects of intracarotid noradrenaline were not reduced by simultaneous intracarotid infusion of phentolamine (3.0 nmol.kg(-1) x min(-1)) but were significantly greater than the responses accompanying intravenous noradrenaline infusion. Concomitant administration of the beta-antagonist, CGP20712A, were much more effective in blocking the noradrenaline-induced changes in salivary composition than equimolar infusions of the beta2-antagonist, ICI118551, thereby confirming the presence of beta1-adrenoreceptors. Intracarotid infusion of salbutamol at 0.6 nmol x kg(-1) x min(-1) and 6.0 nmol x kg(-1) x min(-1) caused increasing but qualitatively similar changes in salivary composition to intracarotid noradrenaline but was less effective than noradrenaline in augmenting salivary protein release. Equimolar intravenous infusions of salbutamol and noradrenaline were equally potent in altering salivary electrolyte concentrations but salbutamol by this route had less effect on protein release and fluid secretion. Concurrent intravenous and intracarotid infusions of beta1-(CGP) and beta2-(ICI) antagonists with intracarotid salbutamol showed that the beta2-antagonist was more potent than the beta1-antagonist by the intracarotid route thereby demonstrating the presence of glandular beta2-receptors and eliminating the possibility that the response to salbutamol was due totally by reflex increases in general sympathetic tone triggered by lowered blood pressure. It was concluded that the kangaroo parotid has functional beta1- and beta2-adrenoreceptor subtypes in endpieces whereas the data provide little support for either adrenoreceptor subtype being present in the excurrent duct system.",

During the course of a year, we estimate that between 560 and 801 patients who do not receive beta-blockers might benefit from treatment with these medications. Full use of beta-blockers among eligible patients at our institution could result in 62 to 89 fewer deaths each year at an overall cost of $33 661 to $40 210.",

    "183": "The reduction in blood pressure seen with the use of beta-blocking drugs was an unexpected finding. Initially there was resistance to their use as the reduction of cardiac output and increase in peripheral resistance from beta-blockade was considered an undesirable pharmacological action for a drug in the treatment of hypertension. However, beta-blockers have now become established in the treatment of hypertension and have been recommended as a first line choice in various guidelines, although their exact mode of action remains a matter for debate. In broad terms beta-blocking drugs are at least of similar efficacy to the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. They may be usefully combined with other anti-hypertensives, as is often required. There is some evidence that the beta-1 selective agents are more efficacious than the non-selective beta-blockers. Notwithstanding some observations to the contrary beta-blockers are often effective antihypertensive agents in the elderly and in black patients; the combination of being elderly and black, however, appears to result in a reduced fall in blood pressure. If they are given early in pregnancy they lead to a low birth weight. Co-existant disease may influence the choice of a beta-blocker to treat hypertension. Beta-blockers are valuable agents in ischaemic heart disease, notably the control of chronic angina pectoris and to improve prognosis post-myocardial infarction. While initial dose titration has to be extremely careful, heart failure is now a strong indication for the use of a beta-blocker, as prognosis is much improved. Diabetes should no longer be regarded as a contra-indication to the use of a beta-1 selective agent. Recent work confirms that beta-blockers should be given to patients undergoing surgery who have a high cardiac risk. Outcome studies suggest overall that in younger patients beta-blockers reduce the incidence of strokes and myocardial infarction. There is no convincing evidence of a difference between the ACE inhibitor captopril and the combination of diuretic and a beta-blocker. In high risk patients, i.e. those with diabetes, no difference was seen between captopril and atenolol. Diuretics may result in better outcome measurements in the elderly compared to beta-blockade but in combination, \"conventional treatment\" is as effective in terms of total mortality, strokes and myocardial infarction as ACE inhibitors or calcium antagonists. Co-existant asthma remains an important contraindication to beta-blockade, but not chronic obstructive airways disease where a beta-blocker should be used with caution if it is indicated, e.g. post-infarction. Quality of life measurements, at least with beta-1 selective agents compare favourably with other anti-hypertensive drugs. Beta-blockers, without partial agonist activity, should not be stopped abruptly, particularly in patients with, or at high risk of, co-existant ischaemic disease because of the danger of post-beta-blockade cardiac sympathetic hypersensitivity; alternatively bed rest should be instituted to reduce the risk of sympathetic stimulation.",

One week of ingesting propranolol modestly elevated the numbers of CD62L+ (P<0.019) but not CD62L- T-lymphocytes. Moreover, propranolol preferentially blunted-psychological stress-induced increases in na\u00efve T-helper (CD4+CD62L+; P<0.049) and na\u00efve T-cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8+CD62L+; P<0.003), as well as activated T-cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8+CD29+; P<0.005). However, exercise-induced increases in leukocyte numbers were enhanced following propranolol treatment (P<0.04). In contrast to the effect on the numbers of adhesion-molecule-bearing cells, there was only a modest effect of propranolol on stress-induced alterations of the density of CD62L, CD54 and CD11a. In this study, propranolol treatment interfered with the adrenergic regulation of circulating leukocyte numbers by blunting psychological stress effects but enhancing exercise effects. Propranolol affected the cell activation status to a lesser extent, as reflected by the density of adhesion molecules.",

A meeting was held at Baveno to update consensus on different terminologies in relation to portal hypertension. beta-blockers continue to be the mainstay for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is fast emerging as a strong contender. The role of vasoactive drugs in the management of variceal bleeding was assessed. Octreotide and terlipressin were shown to be as effective as sclerotherapy in achieving initial hemostasis, and octreotide was shown to be safe and efficacious in the prevention of rebleeding. EVL was superior to endoscopic sclerotherapy (EST) for obliteration of esophageal varices. Sequential and simultaneous ligation and sclerotherapy were more effective than ligation alone, in reducing the recurrence rate after variceal obliteration. For gastric varices, cyanoacrylate glue continues to be the first line of treatment, and band ligation is being assessed further. Bleeding ectopic varices were dealt by appropriate endoscopic means. Endosonography has developed strongly in the assessment of variceal eradication and prediction of variceal recurrence.

In contrast, beta-adrenoceptor stimulation - isoprenaline (1 micromol/l) or norepinephrine (10 micromol/l) + prazosin (2 micromol/l) - inhibited collagen production by 12%, P < 0.01. This inhibitory effect was mediated via the beta1-adrenoceptor, since it was blocked by atenolol (beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist) but not butoxamine (beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist). Fibronectin, another ECM protein, was similarly regulated by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.

Moreover, beta-endorphin, given i.c.v., also decreased acid secretion (ED50=0.25 nmol/rat i.c.v.). The antisecretory effect of these compounds was highly reduced by glibenclamide (10 nmol/rat i.c.v.), a selective blocker of K(ATP) channels. These results suggest that K(ATP) channels in the central nervous system are likely to be involved in the centrally initiated antisecretory action of both alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists and beta-endorphin.", 
    "191": "The objective of this work was to study the potential interference of propanolol, cyclosporine, adriamycin, and nifedipine with the in vitro labelling of erythrocytes.", 
    "192": "20-ml blood specimens were collected from 40 healthy volunteers who had not taken any drug in the week before collection. 2.0-ml alliquots were incubated at 37 C with different concentrations of the drugs for 30 minutes. In all cases, a control group was incubated with saline (0.9%). Two labelling methods were used: 1) EDTA method, in which 60 l of SnCl2 (10.2 g/ml), 2.0 ml of saline, 0.2 ml EDTA 2.2%, and 7.4 MBq of Na99mTcO4 were added, and the mix was incubated for 5 minutes. 2) The hypochlorite method, in which specimens were initially incubated with SnCl2 (10.2 g/ml) for 5 minutes. Then, 40 l of 1% hypochlorite and all the reagents described in the previous method were added. With both methods, erythrocytes were separated by centrifugation and the labelling yield was estimated.", 
    "193": "RESULTS did not show significant differences between the yield of the control group labelling and the yield of the different concentrations of the tested drugs. Also, significant differences were not observed the two labelling methods used.", 
    "194": "Both labelling methods are useful for the in vitro preparation of 99mTc-erythrocytes. The absence of significant differences in the labelling yield indicates that in vitro interferences observed by some investigators are associated with concentrations exceeding therapeutic plasma levels. On the other hand, the reported in vivo interferences might be due to the presence of active catabolites and/or interference between different drugs.", 
    "195": "Iron deficiency (ID) results in ventricular hypertrophy, believed to involve sympathetic stimulation. We hypothesized that with ID 1) intravenous norepinephrine would alter heart rate (HR) and contractility, 2) abdominal aorta would be larger and more distensible, and 3) the beta-blocker propanolol would reduce hypertrophy.", 
    "196": "1) 30 CD rats were fed an ID or replete diet for 1 week or 1 month. Norepinephrine was infused via jugular vein; pressure was monitored at carotid artery. Saline infusions were used as a control. The pressure trace was analyzed for HR, contractility, systolic and diastolic pressures. 2) Abdominal aorta catheters inflated the aorta, while digital microscopic images were recorded at stepwise pressures to measure arterial diameter and distensibility. 3) An additional 10 rats (5 ID, 5 control) were given a daily injection of propanolol or saline. After 1 month, the hearts were excised and weighed.", 
    "197": "Enhanced contractility, but not HR, was associated with ID hypertrophic hearts. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were consistent with an increase in arterial diameter associated with ID. Aortic diameter at 100 mmHg and distensibility were increased with ID. Propanolol was associated with an increase in heart to body mass ratio.", 
    "198": "ID cardiac hypertrophy results in an increased inotropic, but not chronotropic response to the sympathetic neurotransmitter, norepinephrine. Increased aortic diameter is consistent with a flow-dependent vascular remodeling; increased distensibility may reflect decreased vascular collagen content. The failure of propanolol to prevent hypertrophy suggests that ID hypertrophy is not mediated via beta-adrenergic neurotransmission.", 
    "199": "The pharmacological treatment of fetal tachycardia (FT) has been described in various publications. We present a study reviewing the necessity for treatment of FT, the regimens of drugs used in the last two decades and their mode of administration. The absence of reliable predictors of fetal hydrops (FH) has led most centers to initiate treatment as soon as the diagnosis of FT has been established, although a small minority advocate nonintervention. As the primary form of pharmacological intervention, oral maternal transplacental therapy is generally preferred. Digoxin is the most common drug used to treat FT; however, effectiveness remains a point of discussion. After digoxin, sotalol seems to be the most promising agent, specifically in atrial flutter and nonhydropic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Flecainide is a very effective drug in the treatment of fetal SVT, although concerns about possible pro-arrhythmic effects have limited its use. Amiodarone has been described favorably, but is frequently excluded due to its poor tolerability. Verapamil is contraindicated as it may increase mortality. Conclusions on other less frequently used drugs cannot be drawn. In severely hydropic fetuses and/or therapy-resistant FT, direct fetal therapy is sometimes initiated. To minimize the number of invasive procedures, fetal intramuscular or intraperitoneal injections that provide a more sustained release are preferred. Based on these data we propose a drug protocol of sotalol 160 mg twice daily orally, increased to a maximum of 480 mg daily. Whenever sinus rhythm is not achieved, the addition of digoxin 0.25 mg three times daily is recommended, increased to a maximum of 0.5 mg three times daily. Only in SVT complicated by FH, either maternal digoxin 1 to 2mg IV in 24 hours, and subsequently 0.5 to 1 mg/day IV, or flecainide 200 to 400 mg/day orally is proposed. Initiating direct fetal therapy may follow failure of transplacental therapy.", 
    "200": "There is evidence to suggest that, in children, episodic abdominal pain occurring in the absence of headache may be a migrainous phenomenon. There are four separate strands of evidence for this: the common co-existence of abdominal pain and migraine headaches; the similarity between children with episodic abdominal pain and children with migraine headaches, with respect to social and demographic factors, precipitating and relieving factors, and accompanying gastrointestinal, neurological and vasomotor features; the effectiveness of nonanalgesic migraine therapy (such as pizotifen, propanolol, cyproheptadine and the triptans) in abdominal migraine; and the finding of similar neurophysiological features in both migraine headache and abdominal migraine. Abdominal migraine is rare, but not unknown, in adults. Many families are content with a diagnosis and reassurance that the episodes, though distressing, are not the result of serious pathology. Some patients respond to simple dietary and other prophylactic measures. There is scant evidence on which to base recommendations for the drug management of abdominal migraine. What little literature exists suggests that the antimigraine drugs pizotifen, propanolol and cyproheptadine are effective prophylactics. Nasal sumatriptan (although not licensed for pediatric use) may be effective in relieving abdominal migraine attacks."
