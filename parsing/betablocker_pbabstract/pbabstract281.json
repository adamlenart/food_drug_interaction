Although the experience from adult patients may be extrapolated to older children, symptomatic infants remain a subset for whom dosage, safety and efficacy need to be established. The purpose of this study was to assess whether treatment with carvedilol is efficacious and safe for infants with dilated cardiomyopathy who do not show satisfactory clinical improvement despite treatment with conventional medications.", 
    "1": "Eight infants with dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction <30%) who were symptomatic despite tailored treatment with decongestive medications, were enrolled in the study. Echocardiographic findings and heart failure symptom scores were analyzed before and after starting carvedilol. Patients were hospitalized and monitored for side-effects during up-titration of carvedilol. At a follow-up of 4.5+/-2.2 months, patients receiving carvedilol showed a significant improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction (38.5+/-11% v. 24.4+/-5%), and heart failure symptom score (p<0.05). No adverse events related to carvedilol administration occurred. There were no deaths.",

    "3": "The beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2AR) fused to the long splice variant of G(s)alpha (G(s)alphaL), but not the beta2AR fused to the short splice variant of G(s)alpha (G(s)alphaS) shows the hallmarks of high constitutive activity, i.e., strong activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) by GTP and strong inhibition of AC by inverse agonist. These coupling differences are the result of differences in GDP affinity of G(s)alpha splice variants. The aim of this study was to identify experimental variables that differentially affect beta2AR coupling to G(s)alphaS and G(s)alphaL. NaCl substantially reduced agonist-independent AC activation by GTP and inverse agonist inhibition and enhanced agonist stimulation of AC in Sf9 insect cell membranes expressing the beta2AR-G(s)alphaL fusion protein. Salts reduced inverse agonist inhibition and increased agonist stimulation of AC in the order of efficiency NaI approximately KI > NaBr approximately KBr > NaCl approximately LiCl approximately KCl approximately RbCl approximately CsCl approximately choline chloride, indicating that monovalent anions determine salt effects. Salts inhibited guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)-mediated AC activation by G(salphaL) without beta2AR in the order of efficiency NaI > NaBr > NaCl. NaCl enhanced the affinity of G(s)alphaL for GDP. Salts had much smaller effects on beta2AR ligand regulation of AC in membranes expressing beta2AR-G(s)alphaS than in membranes expressing beta2AR-G(s)alphaL. These data are explained by a model in which anions increase the GDP affinity of G(s)alphaL more efficiently than the GDP affinity of G(s)alphaS, and, thereby, decrease the efficiency of the agonist-free beta2AR and increase the efficiency of the agonist-occupied beta2AR at promoting GDP dissociation from G(s)alphaL. Thus, monovalent anions differentially regulate beta2AR-coupling to G(s)alphaS and G(s)alphaL.",

Products from the metabolism of the related secondary amine substrates trifluoropropranolol (7), its O-methyl ether (23), and its N-trifluoroethyl-O-methyl ether analog (24) in the presence of rat liver microsomes and CYP1A2 were examined to determine whether these species were formed. The (19)F NMR experiments showed the presence of carbinolamine and imine species from these primary amines and fluorinated carbonyl compounds in solution. Mass spectral experiments under atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and electrospray ionization-ion trap conditions showed formation of imine metabolites (and/or oxazolidine from 7) as well as products of N-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation when the secondary amine substrates were incubated with rat liver microsomes or CYP1A2. In spite of mass spectral evidence for these imines as metabolites, we were unable to detect the carbinolamines under the conditions used in these studies. Their presence is inferred from the results of the (19)F NMR experiments.", 
    "5": "Betablockers have been convincingly shown to reduce total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of hypertensive diabetic patients. In diabetic patients, after myocardial infarction, these agents confer a twice as high protective effect when compared to non-diabetic patients. However, most paradoxically, betablocking agents are used less frequently in diabetes. Control of hypertension is insufficient in most of the diabetic patients, probably because a combination of antihypertensive agents including betablockers is frequently needed to sufficiently control blood pressure but is not used in these patients. The fear of betablocker-associated side effects in diabetes may be partly responsible for the frequent antihypertensive mono-therapy and the resulting poor quality of blood pressure control among diabetic patients.", 
    "6": "We have performed an analysis of the literature to assess whether possible adverse metabolic effects, a higher risk of hypoglycaemia or less nephroprotective effects of beta1-selective betablocking agents could justify the reticence in prescribing these antihypertensive agents to diabetic patients.",

QTc positively correlated with FT3 (r = 0.63, P < 0.001) and with FT4 (r = 0.481, P < 0.02). Conversely, QTc did not correlate with plasma basal norepinephrine levels, nor with electrolytes.",

Patients with frequent attacks may also receive propranolol or other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists for migraine prophylaxis. The present studies investigated the potential for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between beta-adrenoceptor blockers and rizatriptan.", 
    "16": "Four double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover investigations were performed in a total of 51 healthy subjects. A single 10 mg dose of rizatriptan was administered after 7 days' administration of propranolol (60 and 120 mg twice daily), nadolol (80 mg twice daily), metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) or placebo. Rizatriptan pharmacokinetics were assessed. In vitro incubations of rizatriptan and sumatriptan with various beta-adrenoceptor blockers were performed in human S9 fraction. Production of the indole-acetic acid-MAO-A metabolite of each triptan was measured.", 
    "17": "Administration of rizatriptan during propranolol treatment (120 mg twice daily for 7.5 days) increased the AUC(0, infinity) for rizatriptan by approximately 67% and the Cmax by approximately 75%. A reduction in the dose of propranolol (60 mg twice daily) and/or the incorporation of a delay (1 or 2 h) between propranolol and rizatriptan administration did not produce a statistically significant change in the effect of propranolol on rizatriptan pharmacokinetics. Administration of rizatriptan together with nadolol (80 mg twice daily) or metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) for 7 days did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan. No untoward adverse experiences attributable to the pharmacokinetic interaction between propranolol and rizatriptan were observed, and no subjects developed serious clinical, laboratory, or other significant adverse experiences during coadministration of rizatriptan with any of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers. In vitro incubations showed that propranolol, but not other beta-adrenoceptor blockers significantly inhibited the production of the indole-acetic acid metabolite of rizatriptan and sumatriptan.", 
    "18": "These results suggest that propranolol increases plasma concentrations of rizatriptan by inhibiting monoamine oxidase-A. When prescribing rizatriptan to migraine patients receiving propranolol for prophylaxis, the 5 mg dose of rizatriptan is recommended.

    "19": "Cultured astrocytes display flattened, polygonal morphology in the absence of stimuli, and change into process-bearing stellate cells in response to specific stimuli. In the present study, we investigated possible role of Na+, K+ and Ca2+ in this morphological change of cultured rat cortical astrocytes. Astrocyte stellation induced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mM), phorbol ester (100 nM) or amyloid beta peptide (20 microM) was partly suppressed by replacing NaCl with choline chloride or LiCl in the extracellular medium or by adding KCl, and was completely abolished by replacing NaCl with KCl. Furthermore, the astrocyte stellation was blocked by the specific Na+-K+ pump inhibitor ouabain. However, it was not significantly affected by removing CaCl2 from the extracellular medium nor by adding the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine. These results suggest that Na+ and K+, but not Ca2+, electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane are necessary for morphological changes of astrocytes. In addition, amyloid beta25-35-induced stellation was most susceptible to changing Na+ and K+ concentrations or ouabain, while phorbol ester-induced stellation was least sensitive, demonstrating that the Na+ and K+ dependence differs among stimuli.",

Of patients with drug untreated values of total cholesterol (TC) and/or TC/HDL exceeding National Heart Foundation (NHF) guidelines, 71% were prescribed lipid-modifying drugs. NHF targets for TC (< or = 5.0 mmol/l) were achieved by 37% and for TC/HDL (< or = 4.5) by 60%. TC remained above 5.5 mmol/L in 120 cases.

    "28": "There are no data regarding the prolonged effect of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists on ventricular collagen content and coronary hemodynamics in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). This study, therefore, was designed to determine the effects of chronic treatment with the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor inhibitor doxazosin on SHR systemic and regional (especially coronary) hemodynamics, cardiovascular mass, and ventricular collagen. The effects of the combination of doxazosin with low-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor were studied versus the alpha-1 antagonist alone. These effects were compared with those of a beta-1 adrenergic receptor inhibitor.", 
    "29": "Systemic and regional hemodynamics (radionuclide-labeled microspheres), left and right ventricular weight, hydroxyproline concentration, and aortic weight were measured at age 35 weeks. Doxazosin reduced arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance without changing left ventricular mass and collagen content, whereas monotherapies with the beta-1 antagonist metoprolol or a subdepressor dose of the ACE inhibitor enalapril were effective in reducing left ventricular mass and hydroxyproline without altering pressure. Doxazosin combined with the same low-dose ACE inhibitor reduced left ventricular mass and hydroxyproline without potentiating the hypotensive effect of doxazosin. By contrast, the combination of beta-1 antagonist with the low-dose ACE inhibitor reduced pressure, unlike either agent alone. Aortic weight index was significantly reduced only by doxazosin whether when used alone or with the ACE inhibitor. Low-dose ACE inhibitor with doxazosin or the beta-1 receptor antagonist as well as doxazosin alone decreased renal vascular resistance.",

    "36": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is released from the matrix during bone resorption and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of giant cell tumors of bone and the expansion of breast cancer metastases in bone. Because osteoclasts mediate tumor-induced osteolysis, we investigated whether TGF-beta stimulates osteoclast recruitment. Osteoclasts were isolated from rat long bones and time-lapse video microscopy was used to monitor their morphology and motility. Within 5 minutes, TGF-beta (0.1 nM) induced dynamic ruffling, with 65% of osteoclasts displaying membrane ruffles compared with 35% in untreated controls. Over a 2-h period, osteoclasts exhibited significant directed migration toward a source of TGF-beta, indicating chemotaxis. echistatin, an alphavbeta3 integrin blocker that inhibits macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-induced osteoclast migration, did not prevent the migration of osteoclasts toward TGF-beta. In contrast, a beta1 integrin blocking antibody inhibited osteoclast chemotaxis toward TGF-beta but not M-CSF. These data indicate the selective use of integrins by osteoclasts migrating in response to different chemotaxins. In addition, wortmannin and U0126 inhibited TGF-beta-induced chemotaxis, suggesting involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI 3) kinase and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways. Physiologically, TGF-beta, may coordinate osteoclast activity by recruiting osteoclasts to existing sites of resorption. Pathologically, TGF-beta-induced osteoclast recruitment may be critical for expansion of primary and metastatic tumors in bone.", 
    "37": "The main subject of the study was a toxicological investigation of biological specimens coming from two cases of intoxication with mixture of drugs. Two young people decided to commit suicide by the use of mixture of drugs mainly analgesic in approximately equal doses. For one person the dose of drugs administered turned out to be fatal while second person survived with the symptoms of acute intoxication. The analysis carried out with the use of liquid chromatographic method with mass detection (HPLC/MS) confirmed the presence of mixture of drugs in blood of living person and in postmortem specimens of the victim in significant concentrations. The toxicological findings have delivered information for discussion in medico-legal and ethical aspects.", 
    "38": "Carp were cannulated in the dorsal aorta, and after 2 days of recovery they were infused with 1) norepinephrine, 2) yohimbine (alpha(2)-antagonist) plus norepinephrine, 3) clonidine (alpha(2)-agonist), and 4) isoproterenol (nonselective beta-agonist). Norepinephrine lowered the plasma free fatty acid (FFA) level and raised the plasma glucose level for several hours. Norepinephrine in combination with the alpha(2)-antagonist yohimbine resulted in retardation of the FFA decrease, indicating the involvement of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. Infusion with the partial alpha(2)-agonist clonidine had a smaller effect. Infusion with isoproterenol caused a marked increase of glucose levels, and unexpectedly a decline of plasma FFA levels, indicating a direct involvement of beta-adrenoceptors. Combination of isoproterenol with either atenolol (beta(1)-antagonist) or ICI-118,551 (beta(2)-antagonist) showed that both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors were involved in the glucose release by isoproterenol. Remarkably, the decline of FFA levels was augmented in the presence of ICI-118,551, whereas with atenolol present plasma FFA levels were increased by isoproterenol. Thus it is concluded that in carp both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors mediate glucose release, whereas lipolysis is controlled by inhibitory beta(1)-adrenoceptors and stimulatory beta(2)-adrenoceptors, as well as by inhibitory alpha(2)-adrenoceptors.", 
    "39": "Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC) activity in quiescent skeletal muscle is modest. However, ex vivo stimulation of muscle for as little as 18 contractions (1 min, 0.3 Hz) dramatically increased the activity of the cotransporter, measured as the bumetanide-sensitive (86)Rb influx, in both soleus and plantaris muscles. This activation of cotransporter activity remained relatively constant for up to 10-Hz stimulation for 1 min, falling off at higher frequencies (30-Hz stimulation for 1 min). Similarly, stimulation of skeletal muscle with adrenergic receptor agonists phenylephrine, isoproterenol, or epinephrine produced a dramatic stimulation of NKCC activity. It did not appear that stimulation of NKCC activity was a reflection of increased Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity because insulin treatment did not stimulate NKCC activity, despite insulin's well-known stimulation of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. Stimulation of NKCC activity could be blocked by pretreatment with inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) activity, indicating that activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) MAPKs may be required. These data indicate a regulated NKCC activity in skeletal muscle that may provide a significant pathway for potassium transport into skeletal muscle fibers.",

In adjusted analyses, use of these drugs did not differ significantly between HMO and fee-for-service patients. Substantial regional differences were evident in the use of beta-blockers (Northeast 46%, n = 102; Florida 34%, n = 102; California 31%, n = 159) and cholesterol-lowering agents (California 35%, n = 182; Florida 24%, n = 73; Northeast 22%, n = 48; each P <0.001). Fee-for-service patients were more likely than HMO patients to receive cardiac rehabilitation in unadjusted (32%, n = 167, vs. 22%, n = 141, P = 0.001) and adjusted analyses.",

    "44": "In the present experiment, we tried to compare the functional nicotinic receptors activated by electrical stimulation of the greater splanchnic nerve (containing preganglionic sympathetic nerves) to those activated by (-)-nicotine, using the isolated rat stomach. The stomach was perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution and endogenous noradrenaline released into the perfusate was electrochemically measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The release of noradrenaline evoked by repeated application of 30 mM (-)-nicotine rapidly declined. However, the release of noradrenaline evoked by electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerve at 2.5 Hz was not disturbed by the appearance of tachyphylaxis for (-)-nicotine. The (-)-nicotine-induced release of noradrenaline was abolished by diltiazem, but this reagent had no effect on the electrically evoked release of noradrenaline. The electrically evoked release of noradrenaline was not influenced by atropine, but was reduced to approximately 50% by hexamethonium. This electrically evoked release of noradrenaline was not influenced by alpha-bungarotoxin, alpha-conotoxin ImI (blockers of alpha 7 nicotinic receptors) or dihydro-beta-erythroidine (a blocker of alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic receptors), but was reduced to about 50% by mecamylamine (a blocker of alpha 3 beta 4 nicotinic receptors). The (-)-nicotine-induced release of noradrenaline has already been shown to be partially blocked by dihydro-beta-erythroidine and to be abolished by mecamylamine as shown by Yokotani et al. [Eur. J. Pharmacol. 402 (2000) 223.]. These results suggest that the gastric release of noradrenaline in response to electrical stimulation of the greater splanchnic nerve is mediated by cholinergic (probably ganglionic alpha 3 beta 4 nicotinic receptor-mediated) and non-cholinergic mechanisms in rats. However, the functional nicotinic receptor activated by electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerve seems to be different in character from that activated by (-)-nicotine.", 
    "45": "beta(1)-Adrenoceptor autoantibodies are present in approximately 30% of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy. The inotropic effects mediated by these antibodies remain to be studied. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against a peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the human beta(1)-adrenoceptor in balb/C mouse (n=6), and were characterized by enzyme immunoassay after purification by protein A. Purified immunoglobulin G from non-immunized animals (controls) did not influence Ca(2+) transient and cell shortening of rat cardiomyocytes measured by confocal-laser-scanning-microscopy. beta(1)-adrenoceptor antibodies caused a dose-related increase in Ca(2+) transient (dilution 1:2: +35.3+/-5.1%), and in cell shortening (dilution 1:2: +40.5+/-6.3%) (P<0.01 vs. controls). The effect of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antibodies was blocked by the antigenic peptide and by the antagonist metoprolol. In addition, beta(1)-adrenoceptor antibodies induced a dose-dependent increase of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate. The inotropic response induced by isoproterenol was attenuated by the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antibody. beta(1)-adrenoceptor antibodies as partial agonists induce a specific positive inotropic effect via the protein-kinase-A-cascade.", 
    "46": "We describe the successful treatment of five patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TR-MDD) with a combination pharmacotherapy of pindolol, tryptophan and nefazodone. Five TR-MDD outpatients who had previously not responded to at least four different antidepressant medication trials were initiated on 300 mg/day of nefazodone, 7.5 mg/day of pindolol and 1 g/day of tryptophan. Pindolol doses remained the same throughout the 20 weeks, while tryptophan and nefazodone dosages were gradually increased to 8 g/day and 450 mg/day, respectively. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was used to evaluate outcome. By week 4, all cases demonstrated at least 50% decrease in HAM-D scores. At the end of the trial, the group mean HAM-D score had significantly decreased from 26.8 (+/- 1.9) to 1.8 (+/- 0.8) (p < 0.001). No significant adverse effects were reported. These results suggest that if serotonin availability and release is further enhanced by tryptophan in the presence of nefazodone and pindolol, an antidepressant effect may be produced in patients who are otherwise treatment-resistant. Due to limited sample size, an open design and an 'unusually' high successful efficacy rate of this preliminary study, controlled studies are required to confirm the efficacy of this treatment strategy.",

In the case of atrial flutters the pregnant woman is treated with sotalol administered orally and, if no sinus rhythm is obtained nor a reduced ventricular rhythm occurs, subsequently with digoxin. If there is no hydrops foetalis then this is also the treatment regimen for other forms of foetal supraventricular tachycardia. In the case of hydrops foetalis the treatment is more aggressive: digoxin intravenously or flecanide orally; if the rhythm does not convert into a sinus rhythm nor a reduced ventricular rhythm occurs then both of these medications are administered; if that also proves to be insufficient then direct foetal therapy can be considered.",

These drugs are predominantly those belonging to the categories of cytostatics, anti-arrhythmics, beta-blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, calcium channel blockers and anaesthetics. Drug-induced heart failure should be regarded as a potentially preventable cause of heart failure, although sometimes therapeutic alternatives are scarce (e.g. anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy). Awareness of the possibility of adverse effects on cardiac performance by several classes of drugs, particularly in patients with pre-existing ventricular impairment, may contribute to prevention or timely diagnosis and treatment of drug-induced heart failure.",

We sought to determine whether alterations in cardiac structure and function due to hypertension (HTN) were dependent on Ang II or ET activation. Methods and Results-- Bilateral renal wrapping to produce HTN (n=12) or sham surgery (n=6) was performed in adult dogs. Weekly blood pressure, plasma renin activity, Ang II, ET, and catecholamines were measured. Systolic (end-systolic elastance, Ees) and diastolic (tau) function were assessed in sham and HTN dogs at 5 (HTN-5wk) or 12 (HTN-12wk) weeks. Ang II and ET were assayed in the left ventricle (LV) and kidney. Mean arterial pressure was higher in renal wrap dogs at week 1 (*P<0.05 versus controls: 139+/-4* versus 123+/-4 mm Hg), week 5 (174+/-7* versus 124+/-4 mm Hg), and week 12 (181+/-12* versus 124+/-4 mm Hg). LV mass index was increased in HTN-5wk (22%*) and HTN-12wk (39%*). LV fibrosis was increased in HTN-12wk. Ees was preserved in HTN-5wk and HTN-12wk. tau was increased in HTN-5wk (50+/-3* ms) and HTN-12wk (62+/-10* ms) dogs compared with sham (41+/-2 ms). Plasma Ang II, ET, catecholamines, and plasma renin activity were unchanged during the progressive HTN. Ang II and ET in LV and kidney were not different from controls.",

These findings suggest that load is the prevailing stimulus for the structural and functional changes associated with early hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "51": "Recently, we found in a portal hypertensive rat model that hemorrhage and volume restitution with Haemaccel, a low viscosity plasma expander, induced an increase in cardiac output and portal venous inflow. The present study was conducted to evaluate whether pretreatment with propranolol will attenuate these hyperdynamic changes.", 
    "52": "Portal hypertension was induced by portal vein constriction. Treatment was initiated 14--21 days later. Propranolol (30 mg/kg per day) or water were administered for 7 days via a gastric gavage. Under ketamine anesthesia, 18 h after the last given dose, blood was withdrawn at a constant rate of 0.3 mL/min for 15 min followed by a 15-min stabilization. Haemaccel was infused at the same rate and volume used for withdrawal. Hemodynamic measurements were performed after volume restitution in both groups by using radioactive microspheres.", 
    "53": "Eight rats were studied in each group. In the propranolol-treated animals, portal venous inflow was decreased (2.4 +/- 0.8 vs 3.8 +/- 0.7 mL/min per 100 g bodyweight; P < 0.01), while splanchnic arteriolar and porto-collateral resistance were increased (52.8 +/- 21.0 vs 32.8 +/- 13.0 and 6.0 +/- 1.4 vs 4.1 +/- 0.7 mmHg x min x 100 g bodyweight/mL; P < 0.05, respectively). Cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, total peripheral resistance and portal pressure were not significantly different between the two groups.", 
    "54": "In this model, pretreatment with propranolol prevented the increase in portal venous inflow, which occurs following hemorrhage and volume restitution with Haemaccel. Although caution should be taken in extrapolating data from animal models to humans, our results suggest that volume replacement during a portal hypertensive-related bleeding episode may be safer in a patient treated with non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists.", 
    "55": "Beta-blockade is widely reported to reduce the incidence of syncope in 75-80% of patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). However, despite full-dose beta-blockade, 20-25% of patients continue to have syncopal episodes and remain at high risk for sudden cardiac death. In some patients refractory to beta-blockade, the recurrence of arrhythmias is successfully prevented by left stellate ganglionectomy, and also by labetalol, a nonselective beta-blockade with alpha1-blocking action. These observations suggest that not only beta-adrenoceptors, but also alpha1-adrenoceptors, play an important pathogenic role, especially under sympathetic stimulation, in LQTS. The clinical effects of alpha1-blockade in congenital LQTS were investigated in 8 patients with familial or sporadic LQTS. Two measurements of the QT interval were taken, from the QRS onset to the T wave offset (QT) and from the QRS onset to the peak of the T wave (QTp). Using the Bruce protocol, an exercise test was performed after administration of beta-blockade alone and again after administration of alpha1-blockade. The following were compared: (1) Bazzet-corrected QT (QTc) and QTp (QTpc) intervals in the supine and standing position before exercise and in the early recovery phase after exercise; and (2) the slopes (reflecting the dynamic change in the QT interval during exercise) of the QT interval to heart rate were obtained from the linear regression during the exercise test. In the supine position before exercise, there was no change in the QTc before or after the addition of alpha1-blockade (498+/-23 vs 486+/-23 ms [NS]). However, in the upright position before exercise and in the early recovery phase after exercise, QTc was significantly shortened from 523+/-21 to 483+/-22ms (p<0.01), and from 521+/-30 to 490+/-39ms (p<0.01), respectively, by alpha1-blockade. The QTpc was unchanged in any situation. Consequently, QTc-QTpc was significantly shortened by alpha1-blockade in the upright position before exercise and in the early recovery phase after exercise (131+/-36 to 105+/-37ms (p<0.05), and 132+/-29 to 102+/-31 ms (p<0.01), respectively). The slopes of the QT interval-heart rate relation by linear regression became significantly steeper from -2.23+/-0.38 to -2.93+/-0.76 (p<0.01) with the addition of alpha1-blockade. The findings suggest that the addition of alpha1-blockade attenuated the exercise-induced prolongation of the QT interval and that the rate adaptation of the QT interval to heart rate during exercise was improved. This indicates that additional treatment with alpha1-blockade may be beneficial to prevent cardiac events in LQTS patients in whom ventricular arrhythmia is resistant to beta-blockade.",

Surprisingly the propranolol-derived MIP showed considerable selectivity towards tamoxifen, and was indeed much more selective than the MIP prepared using tamoxifen as the imprint molecule. The consequences of this unexpected, cross reactivity for the use of MIPs in analytical chemistry is discussed.",

This non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) response was entirely dependent on an intact auriculo-temporal nerve supply. The NANC mechanisms were found to be potentially responsible for almost all of the exocytotic response that occurs in the absence of the three autonomic receptor blockers. No sympathetic contribution to the exocytotic response was found and furthermore, studies in parasympathetically denervated glands showed that the sympathetic contribution to the salivary flow was small.

    "58": "Arterial hypertension is common in the first 24 hours after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Although increased blood pressure usually declines to baseline values within several days, the appropriate treatment during the acute period has remained controversial. Arguments against treatment of hypertension in patients with acute ICH are based primarily on the concern that reducing arterial blood pressure will reduce cerebral blood flow (CBF). The authors undertook this study to provide further information on the changes in whole-brain and periclot regional CBF that occur with pharmacologic reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in patients with acute ICH.",

    "62": "Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block serotonin (5-HT) reuptake rapidly, their therapeutic action is delayed. The increase in synaptic 5-HT activates feedback mechanisms mediated by 5-HT1A (cell body) and 5-HT1B (terminal) autoreceptors, which, respectively, reduce the firing in 5-HT neurons and decrease the amount of 5-HT released per action potential resulting in attenuated 5-HT neurotransmission. Long-term treatment desensitizes the inhibitory 5-HT1 autoreceptors, and 5-HT neurotransmission is enhanced. The time course of these events is similar to the delay of clinical action. The addition of pindolol, which blocks 5-HT1A receptors, to SSRI treatment decouples the feedback inhibition of 5-HT neuron firing and accelerates and enhances the antidepressant response. The neuronal circuitry of the 5-HT and norepinephrine (NE) systems and their connections to forebrain areas believed to be involved in depression has been dissected. The firing of 5-HT neurons in the raphe nuclei is driven, at least partly, by alpha1-adrenoceptor-mediated excitatory inputs from NE neurons. Inhibitory alpha2-adrenoceptors on the NE neuroterminals form part of a feedback control mechanism. Mirtazapine, an antagonist at alpha2-adrenoceptors, does not enhance 5-HT neurotransmission directly but disinhibits the NE activation of 5-HT neurons and thereby increases 5-HT neurotransmission by a mechanism that does not require a time-dependent desensitization of receptors. These neurobiological phenomena may underlie the apparently faster onset of action of mirtazapine compared with the SSRIs.", 
    "63": "In this paper we review the effect of medical treatment on renal function in patients with congestive heart failure. We have examined data from the large-scale heart failure studies with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, beta-receptor blockers, an aldosterone antagonist, and a vasopeptidase inhibitor. Renal outcome was reported in almost all of the studies with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Despite concern about renal adverse events with drugs in this class, they seem to be safe in patients with congestive heart failure. In contrast, we did not find any report about renal function in patients treated with beta-receptor blockers for congestive heart failure.", 
    "64": "In myocardial ischemia presynaptic regulation of norepinephrine release may be altered either by ischemic effects on presynaptic receptor signaling or by ischemia-evoked accumulation of endogenous agonists. Because presynaptic receptors are targets of several drugs. such alterations may have pharmacotherapeutic implications. We investigated the effect of brief ischemic periods on presynaptic regulation of norepinephrine release by alpha2-adrenoceptors, beta2-adrenoceptors, adenosine A1-, angiotensin AT1-, and bradykinin B2-receptors in isolated perfused rat hearts. Exocytotic norepinephrine release was evoked by electrical field stimulation. Paired stimulations were performed to compare the pharmacologic intervention (S2) with the release under baseline conditions (S1), and the effects of receptor agonists and antagonists were compared under nonischemic and stop-flow conditions. In summary. during brief myocardial ischemia, presynaptic modulation of norepinephrine release is differentially regulated. Autoinhibitory alpha2-adrenoceptors lose their activity, whereas stimulatory beta2-adrenoceptors are sensitized. Inhibitory adenosine A1-receptors gain importance during ischemia owing to endogenous adenosine formation. Bradykinin- and angiotensin-mediated stimulation of norepinephrine release is not affected under ischemic conditions.", 
    "65": "The objective was to test an effect of atenolol independent of heart rate on electrocardiographic RT rate adaptation by investigating RT adaptation during spontaneous rate and after an abrupt change of atrial rate (study of RT delay). Digital electrocardiograms were recorded from eight conscious dogs. Analysis of RT interval (measured from QRS apex to end of T) was performed on a beat-to-beat basis. The protocol was repeated in the control state and after atenolol administration (2 mg/kg). Regarding spontaneous heart rate, an increased or decreased RR duration did not modify the beat-to-beat relative adaptation of RT to a change of RR (2.15 +/- 1% during control). Atenolol increased mean RR (p < 0.001) and decreased relative adaptation of RT (0.22 +/- 0.18%, p < 0.001). The inverse correlation between mean RR and the relative RT adaptation (r = -0.76, p < 0.05) disappeared after atenolol administration. Regarding RT delay, complete adaptation of RT required 3 min; 48 +/- 16% of this adaptation was observed after the first beat and 60 +/- 11% was observed after the 20th. Atenolol attenuated this adaptation during the first six beats following the abrupt cycle length change (p < 0.05). We concluded that the attenuation of RT rate adaptation after atenolol is related to heart rate modulation and to the time delay in RT rate adaptation.",

    "74": "This study investigated the potential effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the external carotid blood flow of vagosympathectomised dogs and the receptor mechanisms involved. One minute (1 min) intracarotid infusions of adrenaline and noradrenaline produced dose-dependent decreases in external carotid blood flow without changes in blood pressure or heart rate. These responses, which remained unaffected after saline, were: (i) mimicked by the adrenoceptor agonists, phenylephrine (alpha1) and BHT933 (6-Ethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-oxazolo [4,5-d] azepin-2-amine dihydrochloride; alpha2); (ii) abolished after phentolamine (2000 microg/kg) unmasking a vasodilator component (subsequently blocked by propranolol; 1000 microg/kg); and (iii) partly blocked by rauwolscine (30 and 100 microg/kg), and subsequently abolished by prazosin (100 microg/kg). Accordingly, rauwolscine (100 and 300 microg/kg) markedly blocked the responses to BHT933 without affecting those to phenylephrine; likewise, prazosin (100 microg/kg) markedly blocked the responses to phenylephrine without affecting those to BHT933. These results show that both alpha1- and alpha2-adrenoceptors mediate vasoconstriction within the canine external carotid circulation. Moreover, after blockade of alpha1/alpha2-adrenoceptors, both adrenaline and noradrenaline exhibit a beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilator component.",

In this work we examined the mechanisms responsible for an observed depressive effect in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi). Two possible mechanisms were considered: a protonophoretic activity and the opening of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels. We show that carvedilol increases mitochondrial inner membrane permeability to protons, but not to potassium, causing an increase in state IV respiration in the presence and absence of oligomycin. By contrast, a K(ATP)-channel inhibitor, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid, did not affect carvedilol-induced depolarizations. Hence, our results suggest that carvedilol depresses mitochondrial delta psi by a weak protonophoretic mechanism.",

    "86": "The effect of electrical field stimulation (EFS) on insulin (INS) and glucagon (GLU) secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreas is poorly understood. In our study, EFS (5-20Hz, 50 V amplitude and 1.0 ms pulse width), when applied alone, resulted in a significant (p<0.05) increase in INS secretion from the pancreas of both normal and diabetic rats. Atropine (10(-5) M) did not inhibit the EFS (5 Hz)-evoked INS secretion in normal pancreas and failed to alter the effect of EFS (10-20 Hz) on INS secretion from the pancreas of both normal and diabetic rats. Propranolol (Prop) inhibited INS secretion to below basal level in the presence of EFS (5 Hz) but not at EFS (10- 20 Hz). Tetrodotoxin (TTX) also significantly (p = 0.002) inhibited INS secretion from normal pancreas in the presence of EFS (5-20 Hz). The decrease in insulin secretion observed when pancreatic tissue fragments were incubated in Prop and TTX in the presence of EFS was reversed by yohimbine (10(-5) M). In contrast, TTX did not significantly modify INS secretion from diabetic pancreas in the presence of EFS. EFS (5-20 Hz) significantly (p<0.05) increased GLU release from normal and diabetic rat pancreas when applied alone. Neither atropine, Prop nor TTX significantly modified GLU release from the pancreas of either normal or diabetic rats. This suggests that GLU secretion may be controlled through a different pathway. The EFS-evoked INS and GLU secretion is probably executed via different mechanisms. These mechanisms include 1) activation of cholinergic nerves by EFS; 2) EFS of alpha- and beta-adrenergic nerves; 3) activation of non-adrenergic non-cholinergic pathway by EFS; 4) EFS-induced depolarization and subsequent action potential in pancreatic endocrine cells and 5) electroporosity caused by EFS-induced membrane permeability. All of these effects may be summative. In conclusion, EFS (5-20 Hz), when applied alone, can evoke significant increases in INS and GLU secretion from the pancreas of both normal and diabetic rats. Insulin secretion is controlled via alpha-2 adrenergic (inhibition) and beta-adrenergic (stimulation) receptors. Glucagon secretion is enhanced by alpha2 adrenergic stimulation.",

The interaction between propranolol hydrochloride and anionic polymers was confirmed using the UV difference spectra method. The drug release was controlled with the type of anionic polymer and the interaction between propranolol hydrochloride and anionic polymers. The HPMC-anionic polymer ratio also influenced the drug release.

The relationship between the occupancies for beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors and the effects on the exercise pulse rate or the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) after topical administration of carteolol, befunolol, timolol and betaxolol was analyzed using a ternary complex model. The beta-1 and beta-2 receptor occupancies after ophthalmic administration were calculated to be quite high as well as those after oral administration. The maximum occupancies for beta-1 and beta-2 receptors after ordinary ophthalmic administration were 52% and 88% for carteolol, 52% and 61% for befunolol, 62% and 82% for timolol, and 44% and 3% for betaxolol, respectively. Concave relationships were obtained between a decrease in exercise pulse rate and the beta-1 receptor occupancy and between a decrease in FEV1 and beta-2 receptor occupancy, respectively. Nasolacrimal occlusion was estimated to decrease the exercise pulse rate and FEV1 by 65% and 50%, respectively.

    "90": "Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in industrialized countries, accounting for 10 to 20% of total mortality. Several studies have demonstrated a circadian variation of sudden death with a primary peak in the morning hours after awakening and a secondary peak in the late afternoon. Weekly and seasonal variations have been observed, with more frequent occurrence of sudden death on Mondays and in the winter compared with other days of the week and seasons, respectively. These patterns of disease occurrence indicate the presence of identifiable triggering factors. Interestingly, the circadian pattern of sudden death appears to be more pronounced in older patients and to be attenuated by beta-blocker therapy. Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with subsequent coronary thrombosis is the most common underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of sudden death. The variation in disease occurrence may reflect endogenous physiologic rhythms and the importance of external events (e.g., exertional physical activity) that trigger changes (e.g., surges in blood pressure) that lead to coronary plaque rupture. To reduce the long-term risk of sudden death, strategies of primary and secondary prevention must be further developed. To reduce short-term risk of sudden death, patients at risk for sudden death may require additional behavior modification and pharmacological intervention.", 
    "91": "A zone of hypoperfusion surrounding acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has been interpreted as regional ischemia. To determine if ischemia is present in the periclot area, the authors measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) with positron emission tomography (PET) in 19 patients 5 to 22 hours after hemorrhage onset. Periclot CBF, CMRO2, and OEF were determined in a 1-cm-wide area around the clot. In the 16 patients without midline shift, periclot data were compared with mirror contralateral regions. All PET images were masked to exclude noncerebral structures, and all PET measurements were corrected for partial volume effect due to clot and ventricles. Both periclot CBF and CMRO2 were significantly reduced compared with contralateral values (CBF: 20.9 +/- 7.6 vs. 37.0 +/- 13.9 mL 100 g(-1) min(-1), P = 0.0004; CMRO2: 1.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.9 mL 100 g(-1) min(-1), P = 0.00001).

In conclusion, CMRO2 was reduced to a greater degree than CBF in the periclot region in acute ICH, resulting in reduced OEF rather than the increased OEF that occurs in ischemia. Thus, the authors found no evidence for ischemia in the periclot zone of hypoperfusion in acute ICH patients studied 5 to 22 hours after hemorrhage onset.",

Of the multiparas, 40.8% had a history of preeclampsia, 19.7% of chronic hypertension and 9.2% of diabetes mellitus. Antihypertensive treatment aimed at achieving a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg.

For the primiparas, the time of delivery was the only factor with a significant impact on the Apgar scores. In the multiparas, there was an additional negative influence of the use of intravenous hydralazine. This was not seen in the patients using nifedipine and labetalol.",

Inclusion criteria were age >35 years, >/=3 syncopal spells in the preceding 2 years, and positive response to tilt table testing with syncope occurring in association with relative bradycardia. The primary outcome was the first recurrence of syncope after randomization. Enrollment was started in December 1997, and the first formal interim analysis was performed on July 30, 2000. By that time, 93 patients (38 men and 55 women; mean age, 58.1+/-14.3 years) had been enrolled and randomized, although follow-up data were available for all patients (46 patients in the pacemaker arm, 47 patients in the pharmacological arm). The interim analysis showed a significant effect in favor of permanent cardiac pacing (recurrence of syncope in 2 patients [4.3%] after a median of 390 days) compared with medical treatment (recurrence of syncope in 12 patients [25.5%] after a median of 135 days; OR, 0.133; 95% CI, 0.028 to 0.632; P=0.004).

CNP relaxes vascular smooth muscle and inhibits smooth muscle proliferation by binding to natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR) type B (NPR-B) and producing cGMP. Lung parenchyma and fifth-generation pulmonary arteries (PA) and veins (PV) were isolated from late-gestation fetal lambs. All three types of NPR mRNA were detected in PA and PV by RT-PCR. CNP and NPR-B immunostaining was positive in pulmonary vascular endothelium and medial smooth muscle. CNP concentration-response curves of PA and PV were compared with those of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) by use of standard tissue bath techniques. CNP relaxed PV significantly better than PA. ANP relaxed PA and PV equally, but ANP relaxed PA significantly better than CNP. Pretreating PA and PV with natriuretic peptide receptor blocker (HS-142-1) or cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor Rp-beta-phenyl-1- N2-etheno-8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothionate significantly inhibited the CNP relaxation response, indicating that the response was mediated through the NPR-cGMP pathway.

Pooled 6-month results from two ongoing, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, clinical trials were analyzed. Patients were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to treatment with bimatoprost 0.03% once a day ([QD] n = 474), bimatoprost 0.03% twice a day ([BID] n = 483), or timolol 0.5% BID (n = 241). Scheduled visits were at prestudy, baseline, week 2, week 6, month 3, and month 6. The primary outcome measure was in diurnal intraocular pressure ([IOP] 8 AM, 10 AM, 4 PM, 8 PM). Bimatoprost QD provided significantly greater mean IOP reductions from baseline than timolol at every time of the day and at each study visit (p </=.05). BID dosing of bimatoprost also provided significantly greater mean IOP reductions than timolol at most timepoints, but was not as effective as QD dosing. The IOP lowering provided by bimatoprost QD was sustained for 6 months. At month 6, the mean IOP reduction from baseline at 10 AM was 8.1 mm Hg (33%) with bimatoprost QD, 6.3 mm Hg (26%) with bimatoprost BID, and 5.6 mm Hg (23%) with timolol. Low target pressures were achieved by a significantly higher percentage of patients in the bimatoprost QD group than in the timolol group. At 10 AM (peak timolol effect) at month 6, IOP </= 17 mm Hg was achieved by 63.9% of bimatoprost QD patients, compared with 37.3% of timolol patients (p <.001). Bimatoprost was safe and well-tolerated, with few discontinuations due to adverse events. The most frequent side effect was trace-to-mild conjunctival hyperemia. Changes in iris pigmentation were reported in 1.1% of bimatoprost patients. There were no other significant findings in slit lamp examinations, ophthalmoscopy, visual acuity, or visual fields, and systemic safety parameters were also unaffected. Together these results indicate that bimatoprost QD is statistically and clinically superior to timolol in lowering IOP, and is safe and well-tolerated in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.", 
    "101": "Resistin was recently identified as a hormone secreted by adipocytes which leads to insulin resistance in vivo and in vitro and might therefore be an important link between obesity and diabetes. To clarify the regulation of resistin gene expression, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with various agents known to modulate insulin sensitivity, and resistin mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, isoproterenol treatment reduced the level of resistin mRNA to 20% of non-treated control cells. This effect was dose-dependent with significant inhibition occurring at concentrations as low as 10 nM isoproterenol. Moreover, pretreatment of adipocytes with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol almost completely reversed the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol, whereas addition of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine did not have any effect. Furthermore, the effect of isoproterenol could be mimicked by activation of G(S)-proteins and adenylyl cyclase. Thus, both cholera toxin and forskolin decreased resistin mRNA expression in a dose-dependent fashion by up to 90% of control levels. Taken together, these results suggest that resistin gene expression is regulated by a protein kinase A-dependent pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",

This study aims to: determine whether the purine ATP can be released from RPE cells, begin probing the mechanism of any release and test whether cells degrade ATP extracellularly. 2. ATP release was monitored from cultured human ARPE-19 cells with the luciferin-luciferase assay. Biphasic release of ATP was triggered by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), by the pyrimidine uridine triphosphate (UTP) and by hypotonicity. 3. The Cl(-) channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB) inhibited release of ATP, suggesting that release was associated with Cl(-) channels. 4. Elevating intracellular Ca(2+) directly with ionomycin was insufficient to trigger ATP release. 5. UTP induced a biphasic elevation in intracellular Ca(2+). NPPB inhibited the second phase, suggesting autostimulation by released ATP. 6. Cells grown on permeable supports showed apical release of ATP, analogous to release into subretinal space in vivo. 7. The presence of ecto-ATPases on ARPE-19 cell membranes was suggested by the degradation of ATP added to intact cells. 8. Phagocytosis of fluorescent beads was inhibited by ATP, but the ecto-5'-nucleotidase inhibitor alpha, beta-methylene ADP prevented this, suggesting that inhibition was mediated by extracellular conversion of ATP to adenosine. 9. These results suggest that growth factors, pyrimidines and changes in tonicity could trigger ATP release into subretinal space. The levels of ATP released may be capable of autocrine stimulation of ATP receptors, while conversion to adenosine by ecto-enzymes could alter phagocytosis.",

We report a 69-year old female with uncorrected pentalogy of Fallot who suffered from recurrent syncope during classic cyanotic spells. Treatment with bisoprolol is recommended in symptomatic children and also improved symptoms in our patient. We conclude that single patients with pentalogy of Fallot reach the seventh decade and that cyanotic congenital heart disease is a rare cause of syncope in the elderly.", 
    "108": "HF is a prevalent and debilitating disease, affecting nearly 5 million patients and perhaps an equal number with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction who are at high risk of atrial fibrillation developing. An estimated 550,000 new cases occur every year. HF is the most common diagnosis in hospitalized patients aged 65 and over and is a major cause of death. The median survival after onset is 1.7 years in men and 3.2 years in women. The majority of cardiac deaths in patients with HF are sudden and arrhythmogenic: the rest are due to progressive hemodynamic deterioration. A significant advance in the past decade has been the recognition of the importance of inhibiting the neurohormonal action in HF with the use of beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor, and aldosterone antagonists. In addition, a new concept in HF therapy has evolved. The view that chronic HF is an irreversible, end-stage process is being supplanted by the fact that it is possible to effect biological improvement in the intrinsic defects of function and structure in hearts afflicted with chronic HF. Reversibility of HF has been reported by (1) unloading the failing heart using an LVAD, (2) the sophisticated use of diuretic combinations and neurohormonal blocking drugs, or (3) employing continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration. Thus it is now possible to reverse a process that has long been considered irreversible. Exercise programs designed for patients with HF that have been advocated recently can be difficult to apply. Fine tuning of an exercise regimen is required because a reduction in cardiac work is mandatory when treating HF, where the concern is that the heart may not be capable of supplying the metabolic needs of the body, even in resting states. Finally, although not emphasized in the recent literature on HF, the use of diuretics and sodium restriction continue to be the mainstays of therapy without which compensation of HF is not possible.",

We investigated the effect of celiprolol hydrochloride (CH), which is a beta 1 selective beta-blocker with high intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), on the LDL particle size. We treated 41 hypertensive patients with CH and studied the change in LDL particle size according to the score of fast beta lipoprotein and LDL relative mobility value (LDL-Rm) measured by lipoprotein polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis (PAGE). We also studied changes in blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), trygiyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and midband on PAGE. Systolic and dyastolic blood pressure and pulse significantly decreased during treatment. TC levels were significantly decreased at 8 weeks in all subjects and at 4, 8 and 12 weeks in patients with a TC value of over 220 mg/dl. TG levels were significantly decreased at 4 and 8 weeks in patients with initial levels of over 150 mg/dl, and significantly increased at 4 and 8 weeks in those with initial levels of under 150 mg/dl of TG. HDL-C levels did not significantly change during treatment. LDL-C levels were significantly decreased at 4, 8 and 12 weeks in patients with initial levels of over 150 mg/dl. Apo AI, AII, B, CII, CIII and E levels did not significantly change during treatment. Fast beta lipoprotein scores did not significantly change overall during treatment, but were significantly decreased at 4 and 8 weeks in patients initial TG levels of over 150 mg/dl and at 4 and 12 weeks in those with initial levels of over 220 mg/dl of TC.

Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of exercise testing, as well as area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic plots were calculated for these subgroups with use of coronary angiography as the reference.

After withdrawal of the micropipette, a second penetration led to a similar level of IOP. Hypotonic solutions increased and hypertonic solutions decreased IOP. Drugs that decrease inflow (acetazolamide, timolol) or increase outflow facility (pilocarpine, latanoprost) in primates and humans lowered steady state IOP in the mouse. The transient initial increase in IOP produced by pilocarpine reported in other animals was also observed in the mouse. Xylazine-ketamine anesthesia lowered IOP substantially in comparison with systemic anesthesia with either ketamine or tribromoethanol alone.",

We have recorded the transepithelial potential difference in New Zealand white rabbit nostrils. Superfusion of the nasal epithelial surface with a Cl(-)-free medium supplemented with amiloride, hyperpolarized the nasal potential difference. Isoprenaline produced a hyperpolarization of the nasal potential difference that was not prevented by nadolol, a potent beta(1)-/beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, but was abolished by bupranolol, a nonselective beta(1-3)-adrenoceptor antagonist. SR 58611 ((RS)-N-[(25)-7-ethoxycarbonylmethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronapht-2-yl]-(2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2 hydroethanamine hydrochloride) and CGP 12177 (4-[3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy]benzimidazol-2-1), a preferential and a partial beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists, respectively, also produced hyperpolarization of the nasal potential difference.

In skinned fiber preparations, none of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (10 microM) influenced Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension development or maximal Ca(2+) activated tension (DT(max)): control: EC(50) for Ca(2+): 1.28+/-0.05 microM, DT(max): 14.09+/-0.59 mN/mm(2); nebivolol: 1.36+/-0.1 microM, 14.14+/-0.95 mN/mm(2); carvedilol: 1.32+/-0.11 microM, 13.83+/-0.90 mN/mm(2); metoprolol: 1.34+/-0.14 microM, 13.72+/-0.36 mN/mm(2). Simultaneous measurement of force and Ca(2+) transient in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (3 microM) showed that the decrease in force of contraction was paralleled by a similar decrease in the intracellular Ca(2+) transient.

Myocardial infarction was induced by permanent ligation of the left coronary artery in adult rats. Animals were divided into sham-operated and infarction groups with or without metoprolol treatment. Metoprolol treatment (60 mg/kg/day via gastric gavage) was started on the second day after surgery and continued until sacrifice at 6 weeks after myocardial infarction. Isometric force and intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) transients were simultaneously recorded in isolated left ventricular papillary muscles. Ischemia was simulated by immersing the muscles into fluorocarbon with hypoxia. Metoprolol treatment induced a significant improvement of isometric force and ameliorated diastolic [Ca(2+)](i) overload in postinfarction rat myocardium at baseline. Metoprolol treatment also reduced diastolic [Ca(2+)](i), ameliorated the depression of developed tension during ischemia, and enhanced recovery of postischemic depressed myocardial function in sham-operated and postinfarction rat papillary muscles. Protein levels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase of left ventricles and postischemic papillary muscles from metoprolol-treated rats were higher than those in placebo-treated animals. We concluded, therefore, that metoprolol treatment produced appreciable improvement of intracellular Ca(2+) handling during ischemia-reoxygenation cycles, and enhanced recovery of postischemic depressed myocardial function in both normal and postinfarction rat myocardium.", 
    "126": "The purpose of this study was to assess the direct effect of progesterone on rabbit pulmonary arteries and to examine the mechanism of its action. Rings of pulmonary artery from male rabbits were suspended in organ baths containing Krebs solution, and isometric tension was measured. The response to progesterone was investigated in arterial rings contracted with noradrenaline (NA), KCl, and CaCl2. The effects of endothelium, nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, cyclic GMP (cGMP), and the adrenergic beta-receptor on progesterone-induced relaxation were also assessed. Progesterone inhibited the vasocontractivity to NA, KCl, and CaCl2, and relaxed rabbit pulmonary artery. The relaxing response of progesterone in pulmonary artery was significantly reduced by removal of endothelium, inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase and guanylate cyclase, but not by prostaglandin synthase inhibitor and blockage of the adrenergic beta-receptor. In Ca2+-free (0.1 mM EGTA) Krebs solution, progesterone inhibited NA-induced contraction that was intracellular Ca2+-dependent, but didn't affect the contraction of extracellular Ca2+-dependent component. Our results suggest that progesterone induces relaxation of isolated rabbit pulmonary arteries partially via NO and cGMP. Progesterone may also inhibit Ca2+ influx through potential-dependent calcium channels (PDCs) and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores.", 
    "127": "The principal types of thyroid disorders described herein can be recognized and evaluated clinically and biochemically by the obstetrician/gynecologist. Most patients with diffuse goiter should be referred for further evaluation and an RAI scan arranged while this consultation is awaited. Patients with solitary thyroid nodules should be referred for FNAB. Primary hypothyroidism without significant goiter can be treated without specialist referral, except in patients at high risk for ischemic coronary disease or arrhythmia. Primary hyperthyroidism, apart from subacute and postpartum thyroiditis, should be referred for specialist evaluation and definitive therapy. An RAI scan and uptake should be ordered, and beta-blocker therapy can be initiated as interim therapy in symptomatic patients. Patients with secondary (i.e., hypothalamic- or pituitary-based) thyroid dysfunction should always be referred for evaluation and treatment of the primary intracranial cause. There are several causes of abnormal thyroid function tests in apparently euthyroid patients, and the clinical context often provides important evidence of their nature. Clinical judgment is an important factor in knowing when to arrange specialist consultation.",

BRS was determined by linear regression analysis of the RR-interval (interval between heart beats) and mean arterial pressure changes evoked by i.v. bolus injections of methoxamine (inducing reflex bradycardia, RB) and nitroprusside (inducing reflex tachycardia, RT). In MI-rats heart rate and mean arterial pressure were not significantly different from values in SH-rats, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased and contractility was depressed. The BRS (RB: MI: 0.48 +/- 0.04(*), SH: 0.79 +/- 0.08; RT: MI: 0.41 +/- 0.05(*), SH: 0.86 +/- 0.08 ms mmHg(-1)) ((*)P< 0.05 vs SH) was markedly reduced. d, l -Sotalol (1.5 mg kg(-1)i.v.) reduced heart rate (MI: -11 +/- 3 %(*), SH: -11 +/- 3 %(*)) and mean arterial pressure only moderately [MI: -6 +/- 4 %(n.s.), SH: -7 +/- 2 %(*)], while BRS depression in MI-rats was completely neutralized [RB: MI: 1.08 +/- 0.14(*), SH: 1.19 +/- 0.11(*); RT: MI: 0.84 +/- 0.08(*), SH: 0.88 +/- 0.12 (n.s.) ms mmHg(-1)] ((*)P< 0.05 vs pretreatment). The BRS is reduced in rats early after MI, indicating a depressed reflex vagal activity. Treatment with D,L-sotalol at a dose with little effect on heart rate and mean arterial pressure markedly enhances and, thus, restores BRS in MI-rats. These data suggest that D,L-sotalol has both peripheral and central effects leading to an increase of reflex vagal control of heart rate in rats.",

    "131": "Resource utilization data (drug therapy, number of hospital admissions, length of hospital stay, ward type) were collected prospectively in all patients in CIBIS II. These data were used to determine the additional direct costs incurred, and savings made, with bisoprolol therapy. As well as the cost of the drug, additional costs related to bisoprolol therapy were added to cover the supervision of treatment initiation and titration (four outpatient clinic/office visits). Per diem (hospital bed day) costings were carried out for France, Germany and the U.K. Diagnosis related group costings were performed for France and the U.K. Our analyses took the perspective of a third party payer in France and Germany and the National Health Service in the U.K.", 
    "132": "Overall, fewer patients were hospitalized in the bisoprolol group, there were fewer hospital admissions per patient hospitalized, fewer hospital admissions overall, fewer days spent in hospital and fewer days spent in the most expensive type of ward. As a consequence the cost of care in the bisoprolol group was 5-10% less in all three countries, in the per diem analysis, even taking into account the cost of bisoprolol and the extra initiation/up-titration visits. The cost per patient treated in the placebo and bisoprolol groups was FF35 009 vs FF31 762 in France, DM11 563 vs DM10 784 in Germany and pound4987 vs pound4722 in the U.K. The diagnosis related group analysis gave similar results.",

This 'win-win' situation of positive health benefits associated with cost savings is favourable from the point of view of both the patient and health care systems. These findings add further support for the use of beta-blockers in chronic heart failure.", 
    "134": "The internal mammary artery (IMA) is currently the preferred conduit for myocardial revascularization. However, perioperative vasospasm and a hypoperfusion state during maximal exercise may limit its use as a bypass graft. The mechanism of spasm has not been clearly defined. Since beta-adrenoceptor activation plays a major role in vasorelaxation, the present study was carried out to investigate the beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness of human IMA smooth muscle. Isoproterenol produced a concentration-dependent relaxation in endothelium-denuded IMA segments, precontracted with phenylephrine (maximal relaxation 46.33+/-5.45%). Atenolol (10(-6)M) and propranolol (2x10(-7)M) inhibited isoproterenol-induced relaxation. While atenolol produced partial inhibition, propranolol caused a complete inhibition in a majority of the segments and a partial inhibition in a minority. BRL 37344, a selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, produced a concentration-dependent relaxation in phenylephrine-precontracted rings of endothelium-denuded IMA (maximal relaxation 40.35+/-4.07%). Cyanopindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor partial agonist, produced a marked relaxation (58.65+/-6.2%) in endothelium-denuded IMA rings, precontracted with phenylephrine. Cyanopindolol-induced relaxation was resistant to blockade by propranolol (2x10(-7)M). Spontaneous contractions of IMA rings were also observed in some cases that were inhibited by isoproterenol and BRL 37344. This observation implies the important role of beta-adrenoceptor activation in prevention of human IMA spasm. The results obtained in present study indicate that human IMA smooth muscle possesses an atypical beta-adrenoceptor together with beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. Regarding the relaxation induced in IMA rings by adding BRL 37344, the possible identical entities of IMA atypical beta-adrenoceptors and beta 3-adrenoceptors are suggested.", 
    "135": "The effect of an alpha-blocking agent and of a beta-blocking agent on the biosynthesis of extracellular matrix macromolecules of the arterial wall was investigated. Rabbit aorta explants were cultured up to 48 hours with radioactive proline, lysine or glucosamine. In presence of these drugs, at concentration shown to be effective for the inhibition of platelet-endothelial cell interactions (10(-7) M), the incorporation of 14C proline in total macromolecular proline was higher than in macromolecular hydroxyproline suggesting a relatively higher rate of biosynthesis of non-collagenous proteins as compared to collagens. The alpha-blocking increased the incorporation of 14C proline in collagenous and non-collagenous proteins after 18 hours of incubation. beta-blocking also increased the incorporation of proline in macromolecular proline and hydroxyproline as compared to control cultures. Both increased the incorporation of 3H glucosamine in newly synthesised glycosaminoglycans. beta-blocking increased mainly the neosynthesis of heparan sulphate, alpha-blocking that of hyaluronan. The incorporation of 14C-lysine in crosslinked, insoluble elastin was not modified. These experiments confirm that alpha and beta-blocking agents can influence not only the tonus of aortic smooth muscle cells but also the relative rates of biosynthesis of extracellular matrix macromolecules. This effect should be taken in consideration for the evaluation of the long range effect of alpha and beta-blocking drugs on the vascular wall.",

    "140": "In rat left ventricular papillary muscle, phenylephrine, an alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist, induced a triphasic inotropic response; an initial transient, small, positive inotropic effect followed by a transient chloroethylclonidine-sensitive negative inotropic effect and a sustained 2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane (WB4101)-sensitive positive inotropic effect. Treatment with pertussis toxin for 2 days significantly inhibited only the transient negative inotropic effect without changing the sustained positive inotropic effect. This treatment also prevented the acetylcholine (1 microM)-induced negative inotropic effect. Further, phenylephrine-induced transient negative inotropic effect was attenuated in the presence of ouabain. These results suggest that pertussis toxin-sensitive or -insensitive G-protein may be responsible for alpha1-adrenoceptor subtype-mediated negative inotropic effect or positive inotropic effect, respectively, in which the transient negative inotropic effect was produced via the stimulation of Na+, K+ pump, presumably through pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein-dependent pathway.",

While 0.1 microM-50 mM of 5-HT exhibited contractile and/or relaxant effects in quiescent preparations, the same concentrations of sumatriptan did not. On the other hand, carbachol-precontracted tissues were relaxed by the same amounts of 5-HT and sumatriptan in a concentration-dependent manner. The relaxant responses to 5-HT were not antagonized or changed by tetrodotoxin, indomethacin, capsaicin, NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), GR55562 [(+/-)-propranolol, 3-[3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl 1-4-hydroxy-N-[4-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl]benzamide , S(-)-propranolol, methysergide, ketanserin. tropisetron, GR 113808 ([1-[2-(methylsulphonylamino)ethyl -4-piperidinyl]methyl-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-carboxylate maleate salt). pargyline, and fluvoxamine. The relaxant responses to sumatriptan were antagonized by GR55562 but not by S(-)-propranolol.

They all possessed significant beta-adrenoceptor blocking activities under in vitro experiments and radioligand binding assays. In addition, some compounds were further examined in in vivo tests and produced antagonist effects matching that of propranolol and labetalol by measurements of antagonism toward (-)isoproterenol-induced tachycardia and (-)phenylephrine-induced pressor responses in anesthetized rats. Furthermore, all of the compounds had antioxidant effects inherited from their original structures. In conclusion, compound 11 had the most potent beta-adrenoceptors blocking activity, 12 and 13 possessed high cardioselectivity, whereas 14, 15 and 16 possessed additional alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity and 15 is the most effective antioxidant of all. The antioxidant activity may be due to their alpha and beta unsaturated side chain at position 1 and ortho-substituted methoxy moiety on 4-phenoxyethylamine.",

Aim of this study was to investigate the impact of in-hospital and ambulatory treatment on the occurrence of late complications in patients with unstable angina treated conservatively. The study group consisted of consecutive 79 patients hospitalized in our Department on the turn of years 1998-1999 (48 men--age 62 +/- 11 years), followed up by at least 1 year. We analyzed the administered agents on the first day of hospitalization: acetylsalicylic acid, heparin, nitroglycerin, beta-adrenergic agents, calcium channels blockers, statins and ACE inhibitors, as well these drugs prescribed for ambulatory management. At least one complication (recurrent hospitalization due to coronary artery disease, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, need for revascularization or death) occurred in 57 patients (72%) in a follow-up of 16 +/- 3 months. The following drugs significantly reduced rate of late complications (OR--odds ratio, CI--confidence interval, p--significance level):--intravenous heparin during hospitalization: OR = 0.22; CI = 0.12-0.42; p = 0.007;--acetylsalicylic acid administration during hospitalization: OR = 0.42; CI = 0.22-0.77; p = 0.03;--acetylsalicylic acid prescribed for ambulatory treatment: OR = 0.24; CI = 0.13-0.46; p = 0.05.",

She underwent the first ECT under thiamylal anesthesia uneventfully. The second ECT was performed under propofol anesthesia on the next day. Immediately after ECT, the heart rate dropped from 56 to 19 beats.min-1, which was remedied by intravenous atropine. Then, the blood pressure increased to 204/108 mmHg but it was controlled by nicardipine. However, the SpO2 decreased to 84-88% under oxygen administration by mask at a rate of 3 l.min-1. The patient complained of chest discomfort and had a bloody secretion from the trachea. A chest X-ray showed a butterfly shadow. The patient was diagnosed as having neurogenic pulmonary edema and was treated in the ICU by artificial ventilation and administration of diuretics and catecholamines. These treatments proved to be successful, and the patient was discharged from the ICU 4 days later uneventfully. This case indicates that hemodynamics should be carefully monitored following ECT and that care should be taken to prevent the occurrence of complications after ECT.",

The aim of the present study was to compare results of quantitative technetium-99-sestamibi single photon emission tomography (SPECT), following exercise stress test or pharmacological stress test with adenosine. We chose adenosine as comparison, since betablockers may not interfere with adenosine induced vasodilatation and therefore possibly may not interfere with its diagnostic performance. Sixteen patients with angiographically documented coronary disease (5 single-vessel, 6 two-vessel and 5 three-vessel disease), who were chronically treated with beta-blockers, performed SPECT imaging at rest, following bicycle exercise and following adenosine infusion in random order. The SPECT data were analyzed visually and quantitatively, using dedicated computer software (CEqual). According to both visual and quantitative SPECT analysis, adenosine was superior to show reversibility. Higher reversibility extent (50 +/- 15 vs. 26 +/- 12 pixels, p < 0.01) and more intense reversibility severity (110 +/- 29 vs. 49 +/- 23 sum of SDs, p < 0.05) were observed during adenosine than exercise.",

We report a case of life-threatening hyperkalemia (serum [K+] 9.9 mEq/l) with ventricular tachycardia and hypotension in a patient on maintenance hemodialysis who received labetolol for a hypertensive emergency.

    "153": "The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of nonlinear and standard heart rate (HR) variability parameters in predicting future adverse events (AEs) in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. In postinfarction studies, nonlinear measures of HR variability obtained from long-term electrocardiographic recordings have been suggested to be better predictors of adverse outcomes than conventional HR variability measures. Fifty-five high-risk patients with reduced left ventricular function and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator had a 10-minute, high-resolution electrocardiographic recording after which they were followed for 25 months on average. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock or death was determined as the end point. The SD of all normal-to-normal RR intervals, the square root of the mean squared differences of successive normal-to-normal RR intervals, and the proportion of interval differences of successive normal-to-normal RR intervals >50 ms, low-frequency and high-frequency powers of the power spectrum and their ratio were calculated as conventional measures of HR variability. The short-term scaling exponent (alpha(1)) and approximate entropy were determined as nonlinear measures of HR variability. AEs occurred in 23 patients (42%). Patients with AEs had significantly lower alpha(1) than event-free patients: 0.81 +/- 0.29 (mean +/- SD) versus 1.01 +/- 0.30 (p = 0.02). None of the other HR variability parameters differed significantly between patients with and without AEs. In the Cox proportional-hazards model including age, gender, ejection fraction, occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia before defibrillator implantation, beta-blocker usage, and alpha(1), only alpha(1) was an independent predictor of AEs: hazard ratio 1.20 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.39) for every 0.10 decrease in alpha(1) (p = 0.020). In conclusion, alpha(1) obtained from a 10-minute electrocardiographic recording yields important prognostic information about the risk of AEs in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.",

The present study investigates the effect of short-term experimental diabetes of 14-days duration on the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes of the rat heart. 2 .beta-adrenoceptor-mediated functional responses to submaximal doses of isoprenaline were enhanced in Langendorff-perfused hearts from diabetic rats, manifested as greater changes in tension, heart rate and rates of tension development (+dT/dt) and decline (-dT/dt). 3. Radioligand binding data demonstrated that total cardiac beta-adrenoceptor density and affinity for [3H]-dihydroalprenolol was unchanged by diabetes, although a decrease in beta1-adrenoceptor density and increase in beta2-adrenoceptor density was observed. 4. In conclusion, hearts from 14-day streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats demonstrate a number of alterations within the beta-adrenoceptor system. However, the enhanced beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses to isoprenaline were not caused by an overall increase in density of beta-adrenoceptors, but were accompanied by changes in the ratio of the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes.",

The potencies were in the order of isoprenaline > procaterol > denopamine. 3. Denopamine-induced dilations were significantly inhibited by 1 nmol betaxolol (a selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist), but it was not influenced by 1 nmol ICI 118,551 (a selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist). On the other hand, procaterol-induced vasodilations were significantly inhibited by 1 nmol ICI 118,551 but not modified by 10 nmol betaxolol. 4. ACh-induced vasodilations disappeared after intraluminal saponin injection to remove endothelium, but procaterol- and denopamine-induced dilations were not modified by removal of the endothelium. 5. Pretreatment with L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) readily inhibited ACh-induced vasodilations. However, neither procaterol- or denopamine-induced vasodilation was modified by L-NAME treatment. 6. From these results, it is concluded that in the rat common carotid arteries (1) there are abundant beta2- and a few beta1-adrenoceptors, and (2) there is no participation of the endothelium-dependent mechanism in beta-adrenoceptor mediated vasodilations.",

In both treatment groups the median frequency of migraine attacks improved during the study period, from three to two in the ASA group and from three to one in the metoprolol group; 45.2% of all metoprolol patients were responders compared with 29.6% with ASA. Medication-related adverse events were less frequent in the ASA group (37) than in the metoprolol group (73). The findings from this trial show that metoprolol is superior to ASA for migraine prophylaxis but has more side-effects. Acetylsalicylic acid is better tolerated than metoprolol.
