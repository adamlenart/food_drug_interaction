    "0": "This study demonstrated that the human placenta possesses an adenyl cyclase system responsive to catecholamines and sodium flouride (NaF). 2.5 gm human term placentas were homogenized, centrifuged, washed, resuspended, and used as the enzyme system when placed with various agents. Incubations and the determination of adenosine 3', 5' monophosphate (cyclic AMP) formed were performed. Samples stimulated by .0001 M catecholamines (L-epinephrine or L-norepinephrine) or .01 M NaF had higher levels of cyclic AMP than the controls (p. 005 for catecholamine-treated samples and p. 001 for NaF-treated samples). A concentration of .0001 M L-epinephrine or L-norepinephrine appeared to be a maximum effective dose and .0000001 M a minimum. L=epinephrine was 10 times as effective in the stimulation as L-norepinephrine. With .0001 M, 499 and 439 pmoles/10 minutes per 25 mg of tissue was formed, whereas in the control (no added hormones) 256 pmoles/10 minutes were formed. 3.2% ethanol activated the system by a small amount (p.02). Propranolol alone did not appear to have any effect; however, the effect of .0001 M L-epinephrine was reduced by 95% in the presence of .00001 M propranolol. Propranolol had no effect on NaF-stimulated activity.", 
    "1": "1. 4-Hydroxypropranolol, a metabolite produced after oral administration of propranolol, has been shown to be a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug. It is of similar potency to propranolol in antagonizing the effects of isoprenaline on heart rate and blood pressure in cats and against isoprenaline protection of guinea-pigs from bronchospasm. It is not cardioselective.2. In rats depleted of catecholamine 4-hydroxypropranolol produced an increase in heart rate, suggesting that it has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.3. In anaesthetized dogs 4-hydroxypropranolol produced a decrease in heart rate and dP/dt and an increase in A-V conduction time at doses within the range 0.09-1.25 mg/kg. These effects are a result of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. In dogs depleted of catecholamines these same doses produced an increase in heart rate and dP/dt and a decrease in A-V conduction time. These responses were antagonized by propranolol, and were due to the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of the compound. At higher doses (5.25 and 13.25 mg/kg) a further dose dependent decrease in heart rate and dP/dt and an increase in A-V conduction time occurred. This trend was also seen in animals depleted of catecholamines. These changes represent membrane stabilizing activity of 4-hydroxypropranolol.4. 4-Hydroxypropranolol is a potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with both intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and membrane stabilizing activity.", 
    "2": "1. As a local anaesthetic on frog nerve, LB46 had 0.4 times the activity of procaine and 2 times that of INPEA.2. In reducing the maximum rate of depolarization (MRD) of intracellularly recorded cardiac action potentials, LB46 was 20 times more potent than INPEA.3. As an antagonist of the chronotropic effect on atrial muscle and of the inotropic effects on ventricular muscle of isoprenaline the pA(2) values for LB46 were 9.05+/-0.15 and 9.30+/-0.06 respectively, and for INPEA 6.00+/-0.16 and 6.10+/-0.12.4. LB46 was 8 times more active than racemic propranolol in blocking the effects of isoprenaline on isolated cardiac muscle, and since its direct action on the cardiac membrane was only 0.1 times that of propranolol, there was a net gain of 80 times in the specificity of LB46 for class 2 (antisympathetic) over class 1 (depression of MRD) antidysrhythmic actions.5. INPEA was 2.5 times less active as a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug on cardiac muscle than (+)-propranolol, and 1,300 times less active than LB46.6. INPEA, but not LB46, prolonged the duration of both atrial and ventricular intracellular action potentials.", 
    "3": "The effects of potential neurohormones on the intracellular concentrations of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate have been examined with three clonal lines of cultured glial tumors. In all cases, norepinephrine and isoproterenol produced striking elevations of the intracellular concentrations of the cyclic nucleotide. The response was mediated by a beta-adrenergic receptor. This effect is hypothesized to represent a molecular mechanism for neuronal-glial communication coupled to concurrent communication between neurons.", 
    "4": "1. Adrenaline and noradrenaline cause a biphasic change in the transverse electrical conductance across the cat pancreas. After a latent period of from 5 to 30 sec a phase of decreased conductance lasting about 30 sec occurs which gives way to a phase of increased conductance lasting from 5 to 8 min.2. Coincidentally with the phase of decreased conductance, vasoconstriction and a reduction in blood flow occurs and an increased blood flow with the phase of increased conductance. The blood flow and conductance records run a parallel time course.3. Weight for weight adrenaline produces changes of greater magnitude than noradrenaline.4. The phase of decreased conductance and blood flow was abolished by an alpha-receptor blocking agent and the phase of increased conductance and blood flow by a combination of alpha- and beta-receptor blocking agents.5. Inhibition of the volume rate of secretion coincident with the phase of decreased conductance followed rapid intravenous injection of adrenaline or noradrenaline. During the phase of increased conductance secretion either returned to control values or was transiently augmented.6. Inhibition of secretion occurred after alpha-receptor blockade in the absence of vasoconstriction, suggesting that the catecholamines have a direct action on the cell.7. beta-receptor blockade increased the effectiveness of adrenaline to inhibit pancreatic secretion. When the effects of the catecholamines on secretion were tested, secretion was always induced by secretin."
