Heart rate, blood pressure, intraocular pressure (IOP), and peak systolic (PSV) and end diastolic velocities (EDV) in ophthalmic, central retinal, and short posterior ciliary arteries were measured before and after each treatment, and resistivity index was calculated.", 
    "3": "The IOP was reduced (P < .01) by timolol-dorzolamide and, more effectively, timolol-pilocarpine combinations. In central retinal artery, the end diastolic velocity was increased by the timolol-dorzolamide combination (P < .01), resulting in higher end diastolic velocity and lower resistivity index values (both P < .01) compared with the timolol-pilocarpine combination.",

    "5": "Although loop diuretics are widely used in heart failure (HF), their effect on outcomes has not been evaluated in large clinical trials. This study sought to determine the dose-dependent relation between loop diuretic use and HF prognosis. A cohort of 1,354 patients with advanced systolic HF referred to a single center was studied. Patients were divided into quartiles of equivalent total daily loop diuretic dose: 0 to 40, 41 to 80, 81 to 160, and >160 mg. The cohort was 76% male, with a mean age of 53+/-13 years and a mean ejection fraction of 24+/-7%. The mean diuretic dose equivalence was 107+/-87 mg. The diuretic quartile groups were similar in terms of gender, body mass index, ischemic cause of HF, history of hypertension, and spironolactone use, but the highest quartile was associated with a smaller ejection fraction and lower serum sodium and hemoglobin levels but higher serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. There was a decrease in survival with increasing diuretic dose (83%, 81%, 68%, and 53% for quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Even after extensive co-variate adjustment (age, gender, ischemic cause of HF, the ejection fraction, body mass index, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, peak oxygen consumption, beta-blocker use, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use, digoxin use, statin use, serum sodium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, hemoglobin, cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and smoking history), diuretic quartile remained an independent predictor of mortality (quartile 4 vs quartile 1 hazard ratio 4.0, 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 8.4). In conclusion, in this cohort of patients with advanced HF, there was an independent, dose-dependent association between loop diuretic use and impaired survival. Higher loop diuretic dosages identify patients with HF at particularly high risk for mortality.", 
    "6": "The degree to which increased right-sided heart pressures influence outcome in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is unclear. High right ventricular (RV) pressures may contribute to septal malpositioning, thus hindering effective resynchronization. We hypothesized that patients with high RV systolic pressures before CRT implantation would have poorer outcome. We evaluated echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and clinical records from 75 consecutive patients with CRT. RV systolic pressure was calculated from the peak tricuspid regurgitant, time-velocity profile. The primary end point was a composite of mortality, cardiac transplantation, or need for a left ventricular assist device. Events were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard ratios. Patients grouped by RV systolic pressure divided at the median of 35 mm Hg were similar except for more renal insufficiency and RV dysfunction when RV systolic pressure was >35 mm Hg. Univariate analysis identified RV systolic pressure >35 mm Hg (hazard ratio [HR] 3.32), diabetes (HR 2.45), renal insufficiency (HR 3.52), atrial fibrillation (HR 3.07), use of nonamiodarone antiarrhythmic medications (HR 2.86), atrial pacing (HR 2.57), and prolonged PR interval (HR 1.009) as associated with poorer outcome. Normal sinus rhythm at implantation (HR 0.34), baseline left bundle branch block (HR 0.44), and beta-blocker use (HR 0.47) were associated with improved outcome. In a multivariable model, high RV systolic pressure (HR 3.71, 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 10.4), renal insufficiency (HR 3.18, 95% confidence interval 1.29 to 7.86), and atrial fibrillation (HR 4.22, 95% confidence interval 1.54 to 11.6) remained significant. In conclusion, despite resynchronization, patients with high RV pressures have significantly decreased survival after adjusting for significant contributing influences.", 
    "7": "The presence of congestive heart failure (CHF) has been associated with treatment disparities and worse outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, but the incidence and effect of CHF in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACSs) has not been well characterized. We evaluated 45,744 patients with NSTE ACS (positive cardiac markers and/or ischemic ST-segment changes) who were treated at 424 hospitals in the CRUSADE Quality Improvement Initiative between March 2000 and March 2003. Treatment patterns and in-hospital outcomes in patients with signs of CHF on presentation and those who developed in-hospital CHF were compared with those in patients without CHF. In total, 10,398 patients (22.7%) had signs of CHF on presentation, and 1,664 patients (3.6%) later developed in-hospital CHF. Compared with patients without CHF, early (<24 hours from presentation) medications and invasive cardiac procedures were used less often in patients with signs of CHF on presentation. Likewise, patients with in-hospital CHF were less likely than those without CHF to receive acute antiplatelet agents and undergo cardiac catheterization but more likely to receive acute beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and heparin and to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting. Adjusted mortality was higher in patients with signs of CHF on presentation (odds ratio 2.64, 95% confidence interval 2.31 to 3.01) and those with in-hospital CHF (odds ratio 4.93, 95% confidence interval 4.05 to 5.99) than in patients without CHF. In conclusion, CHF occurs frequently in patients with NSTE ACS but is associated with less aggressive treatment and a higher risk of mortality. Further study is needed to determine the causes of these treatment differences and the optimal therapeutic approach for patients with NSTE ACS and concomitant CHF.",

Heart failure due to Chagas cardiomyopathy is the main clinical presentation in Colombia. Heart failure due to Chagas' disease may respond to digoxin, diuretics and vasodilator therapy. Beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism seems to protect against the increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death due to chronic sympathetic stimulation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker Bisoprolol on cardiovascular mortality, hospital readmission due to progressive heart failure and functional status in patients with heart failure secondary to Chagas' cardiomyopathy.", 
    "9": "A cohort of 500 T. cruzi seropositive patients (250 per arm) will be selected from several institutions in Colombia. During the pretreatment period an initial evaluation visit will be scheduled in which participants will sign consent forms and baseline measurements and tests will be conducted including blood pressure measurements, twelve-lead ECG and left ventricular ejection fraction assessment by 2D echocardiography. Quality of life questionnaire will be performed two weeks apart during baseline examination using the \"Minnesota living with heart failure\" questionnaire. A minimum of two 6 minutes corridor walk test once a week over a two-week period will be performed to measure functional class. During the treatment period patients will be randomly assigned to receive Bisoprolol or placebo, initially taking a total daily dose of 2.5 mgrs qd. The dose will be increased every two weeks to 5, 7.5 and 10 mgrs qd (maximum maintenance dose). Follow-up assessment will include clinical check-up, and blood collection for future measurements of inflammatory reactants and markers. Quality of life measurements will be obtained at six months. This study will allow us to explore the effect of beta-blockers in chagas' cardiomyopathy.",

Carvedilol was started at a dose of 1.25 to 5 mg/day and then increased to the final target dose of 20 mg/day, depending on its tolerability in each patient. The patients were monitored with respect to their NYHA classification, daily mean heart rate (evaluated by Holter electrocardiography), changes of the plasma brain natriuretic peptide level, and prognosis.

The NYHA classification and plasma brain natriuretic peptide level were significantly improved, and the daily mean heart rate was also significantly reduced in the 268 patients. Significant improvement was also observed in patients with severe heart failure (classes III or IV of the NYHA classification). The five-year survival rate of patients continuously treated with carvedilol was 83%, and their outcome was significantly better than that of those who could not tolerate the drug (49%; p < 0.001) or those who discontinued treatment prematurely (68%; p < 0.001).

Cup area, cup/disk area ratio and cup volume decreased significantly, while the rim area increased significantly. Linear progression analysis showed a significant correlation between the percent decrease in the IOP and the topographic changes in the cup area, cup/disk area ratio, rim area, cup volume, rim volume, and height variation contour. When the subjects were divided into two groups: patients with high baseline IOP of more than 16 mmHg (HNTG group) and those with low baseline IOP below 15 mmHg (LNTG group), significant changes in several parameters were observed only in the HNTG group.",

The patients were followed for about 5.5 years. The doses chosen for this trial were biased in favour of amlodipine, in terms of expected effects on blood pressure, cardiovascular mortality and strokes. However, amlodipine was not associated with a reduction in overall mortality or with a lower frequency of the primary outcome (non fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death).

Despite the predominant role of the coronary arteries in the induction of myocardial infarction, the precise contribution of each artery to this process is not well established. The present work evaluates the histological characteristics and functional properties of the left (LCA) and right (RCA) coronary arteries in swine in order to establish if the arteries are differentially regulated. To investigate this possibility, concentration-response curves for serotonin (5-HT, from 0.1 nmol/l to 100 micromol/l) and KCl (from 5 to 40 mmol/l) were performed on both arteries to determine the receptor-dependent and independent responses, respectively. The specific subtype of the 5-HT receptor involved in the contraction of both arteries was evaluated using DL-propranolol hydrochloride (5-HT1 and nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist) and ketanserine (5-HT2 antagonist) and immunohistochemical assays. The Emax from the 5-HT concentration-response curves was 24% higher in the LCA than in the RCA (n = 59, p < 0.05). EC50 values from both curves were also significantly different (LCA 0.150 +/- 0.005 micromol/l and RCA 0.171 +/- 0.010 micromol/l, n = 59, p < 0.05). Similarly, the Emax for KCl was 36% higher in the LCA than in the RCA (n = 9, p < 0.05), and the EC50 values also differed (LCA 15.30 +/- 0.06 mmol/l and RCA: 14.30 +/- 0.11 mol/l, n = 9, p < 0.05). Ketanserine reduced the Emax by 63% in the LCA and by 67% in the RCA. DL-propranolol hydrochloride decreased Emax by 24% in the LCA and by 26% in the RCA. The dry weight and media area were larger in the LCA than in the RCA (17%, n = 40, p < 0.05, and 3%, n = 40, p < 0.05, respectively). Immunohistochemical assay results reveal that the average density of 5-HT2A receptor subtype was also higher in the LCA (41.24 +/- 1.35) than in the RCA (18.49 +/- 1.14; n = 20, p < 0.05). Together, the findings of this study suggest that a differential physiological regulation exists between the LCA and RCA in swine. This differential regulation may have arisen as a mechanism for maintaining an adequate perfusion pressure in the wall of the left ventricle, favoring a greater oxygen delivery to match the increased oxygen demand of the left ventricle.",

In 9 trials including 4564 hypertensive patients, CCBs, ACE inhibitors, an angiotensin II receptor blocker or an alpha-blocker, compared with diuretics or beta-blockers, in the presence of similar blood pressure reductions, decreased intima-media thickening by 3 microm/year (P=0.03). The overall beneficial effect of the newer over older drugs was largely attributable to the decrease of intima-media thickening by 5 microm/year (P=0.007) in 4 trials of CCBs involving 3619 patients. In 5 trials including 287 patients with hypertension or diabetes, CCBs compared with ACE inhibitors did not differentially affect blood pressure, but attenuated intima-media thickening by 23 microm/year (P=0.02).

    "28": "We previously showed that serotonin (5-HT2) receptor activation in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) produced hypotension, bradycardia, and facilitation of the baroreflex bradycardia. Activation of the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus, which is involved in shock-evoked passive behaviors, induces similar modifications. In addition, previous studies showed that blockade of the infralimbic (IL) part of the medial prefrontal cortex, which sends projections to POA, produced an inhibitory influence on the baroreflex cardiac response. Thus, to assess the possible implication of NTS 5-HT2 receptors in passive cardiovascular responses, we analyzed in anesthetized rats the effects of NTS inhibition and NTS 5-HT2 receptor blockade on the cardiovascular modifications induced by chemical (0.3 M D,L-homocysteic acid) and electrical (50 Hz, 150-200 microA) stimulation of IL or POA. Intra-NTS microinjections of muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, prevented the decreases in blood pressure and heart rate normally evoked by IL or POA activation. In addition, we found that intra-NTS microinjection of R(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)]-4-piperidine-methanol, a specific 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, did not affect the decreases in cardiovascular baseline parameters induced by IL or POA stimulation but prevented the facilitation of the aortic baroreflex bradycardia normally observed during IL (+65 and +60%) or POA (+70 and +69%) electrical and chemical stimulation, respectively. These results show that NTS 5-HT2A receptors play a key role in the enhancement of the cardiac response of the baroreflex but not in the changes in basal heart rate and blood pressure induced by IL or POA stimulation.", 
    "29": "Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker used as a racemic mixture in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and angina pectoris. For study of the stereoselective glucuronidation of this drug, the two propranolol glucuronide diastereomers were biosynthesized, purified, and characterized. A screen of 15 recombinant human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) indicated that only a few isoforms catalyze propranolol glucuronidation. Analysis of UGT2B4 and UGT2B7 revealed no significant stereoselectivity, but these two enzymes differed in glucuronidation kinetics. The glucuronidation kinetics of R-propranolol by UGT2B4 exhibited a sigmoid curve, whereas the glucuronidation of the same substrate by UGT2B7 was inhibited by substrate concentrations above 1 mM. Among the UGTs of subfamily 1A, UGT1A9 and UGT1A10 displayed high and, surprisingly, opposite stereoselectivity in the glucuronidation of propranolol enantiomers. UGT1A9 glucuronidated S-propranolol much faster than R-propranolol, whereas UGT1A10 exhibited the opposite enantiomer preference. Nonetheless, the Km values for the two enantiomers, both for UGT1A9 and for UGT1A10, were in the same range, suggesting similar affinities for the two enantiomers. Unlike UGT1A9, the expression of UGT1A10 is extrahepatic. Hence, the reverse stereoselectivity of these two UGTs may signify specific differences in the glucuronidation of propranolol enantiomers between intestine and liver microsomes. Subsequent experiments confirmed this hypothesis: human liver microsomes glucuronidated S-propranolol faster than R-propranolol, whereas human intestine microsomes glucuronidated S-propranolol faster. These findings suggest a contribution of intestinal UGTs to drug metabolism, at least for UGT1A10 substrates.",

Seven transgenic lines developed dilated cardiomyopathy and premature death from congestive heart failure. One founder line that survived long enough to propagate had extremely high-level Cre recombinase expression. Transgenic lines that expressed low levels remained healthy. The high-expressing strain developed heart failure over a very predictable and reproducible time course. Detailed examination of the high-expressing strain revealed important molecular, cellular, and pharmacologic hallmarks of cardiomyopathy. First, \"fetal genes\" such as atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic protein were expressed, a marker of pathologic cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Second, an increased incidence of cardiac myocyte apoptosis was present. Third, treatment of mice with captopril or metoprolol, drugs that delay the progression of heart failure, improved survival.",

    "44": "Glucose-induced insulin secretion requires a rise in beta-cell cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) that triggers exocytosis and a mechanistically unexplained amplification of the action of [Ca2+]c. Insulin granules are kept acidic by luminal pumping of protons with simultaneous Cl- uptake to maintain electroneutrality. Experiments using patched, dialyzed beta-cells prompted the suggestion that acute granule acidification by glucose underlies amplification of insulin secretion. However, others found glucose to increase granular pH in intact islets. In this study, we measured islet granular pH with Lysosensor DND-160, a fluorescent dye that permits ratiometric determination of pH < 6 in acidic compartments. Stimulation of mouse islets with glucose reversibly decreased granular pH by mechanisms that are dependent on metabolism and Cl- ions but independent of changes in [Ca2+]c and protein kinase A or C activity. Granular pH was increased by concanamycin (blocker of the vesicular type H+-ATPase) > methylamine (weak base) > Cl- omission. Concanamycin and methylamine did not alter glucose-induced [Ca2+]c increase in islets but strongly inhibited the two phases of insulin secretion. Omission of Cl- did not affect the first phase but decreased the second phase of both [Ca2+]c and insulin responses. Neither experimental condition affected the [Ca2+]c rise induced by 30 mM KCl, but the insulin responses were inhibited by concanamycin > methylamine and not affected by Cl- omission. The amplification of insulin secretion by glucose was not suppressed. We conclude that an acidic granular pH is important for insulin secretion but that the acute further acidification produced by glucose is not essential for the augmentation of secretion via the amplifying pathway.",

The patient had mild symptoms with only short episodes of dizziness and would not have contacted the primary care centre. Due to HM, the arrhythmia was detected before the next routine follow-up, and the patient was seen the next day.

    "46": "The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a pulsatile multiparticulate drug delivery system (DDS), coated with aqueous dispersion Aquacoat ECD. A rupturable pulsatile drug delivery system consists of (i) a drug core; (ii) a swelling layer, comprising a superdisintegrant and a binder; and (iii) an insoluble, water-permeable polymeric coating. Upon water ingress, the swellable layer expands, resulting in the rupturing of outer membrane with subsequent rapid drug release. Regarding the cores, the lag time was shorter, when 10% (w/w) theophylline was layered on sugar cores compared with cores consisting of 100% theophylline. Regarding swelling layer, the release after lag time was fast and complete, when cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose (AcDiSol) was used as a swelling agent. In contrast, a sustained release was achieved after the lag time, when low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose (L-HPC) and sodium starch glycolate (Explotab) were used as swelling agents. The optimal level of AcDiSol to achieve a fast and complete release after the lag time was 26% (w/w) (based on the weight of the coated pellets) for poorly soluble theophylline and 48% (w/w) for highly soluble propranolol HCl. The lag time can be controlled by the coating level of an outer membrane and increased with increasing coating level of the outer membrane. Outer membrane, formed using aqueous dispersion Aquacoat ECD was brittle and ruptured sufficiently to ensure fast drug release, compared to ethylcellulose membrane formed using organic solution. The addition of talc led to increase brittleness of membrane and was very advantageous because of (i) reduced sensitivity of lag time on variations in the coating level and (ii) fast and complete drug release. Drug release starts only after rupturing of outer membrane, which was illustrated by microscopical observation of pellet during release.",

Only the apoptotic indices of the infracted/scar and border areas of the C-4 week subgroup were significantly lower than those of the MI-4 week subgroup (both P < 0.05), and were close to those of the non-infarcted area. DNA gel electrophoresis showed that the positive rate of Group S at any time-point were both 0, the positive rate of MI-48 h subgroup and C-48 h subgroup were both significantly higher than that of Group S (both P < 0.05) without significant difference between these 2 groups, and the positive rates of the MI-4 week subgroup and C-4 week subgroup were both 0. Immunohistochemistry showed that the bax gene expression was slightly to significantly increased in the infarcted/scar, border, and non-infarcted areas of the MI-48 h and MI-4 week subgroups. The bcl-2 expression was significantly increased only in the infracted area of the MI-48 h subgroup. The bcl-2 expression was slightly increased in the infracted and border areas of the C-48 h subgroup and the bax expression was significantly decreased in the infracted/scar area of the C-4 week subgroup. Western blotting showed that (1) the bcl-2 expression of the S-4 week subgroup was significantly higher than that of the S-48 h subgroup (P < 0.05), (2) the bcl-2 expression and bax expression of the MI-48 h subgroup were significantly higher than that of the S-48 h subgroup (P < 0.05 - 0.01), the bcl-2/bax ratio of the MI-48 h subgroup was significantly lower that that of the S-48 h subgroup, however, there were no significant differences in the bcl-2 and bax expression and bcl-2/bax ratio between the MI-4 week subgroup and S-48 h subgroup (all P > 0.05), and (3) There were no significant difference in the bcl-2 and bax expression between Group A and Group S (all P > 0.05), however, the bcl-2/bax ratios at the 2 time-points of Group C were both significantly higher than those of Group MI.",

    "51": "Site-directed mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling experiments suggest the existence of at least two distinct binding orientations for aryloxypropanolamine competitive antagonists in the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR), one where the aryloxy moiety is located near transmembrane alpha-helix 7 (tm 7) and another where it is near tm 5. To explore a hydrophobic pocket involving tms 1, 2, 3, and 7 for potential aryloxy interaction sites, we selected Tyr(356(7.43)) and Trp(134(3.28)) in the rat beta(1)-AR for site-directed mutagenesis studies. Ser(190(4.57)) was also investigated, as the equivalent residues are known antagonist interaction sites in the muscarinic M(1) and the dopamine D(2) receptors. Binding affinities (pK(i)) of a series of structurally diverse aryloxypropanolamine competitive antagonists were determined for wild type and Y356A, Y356F, W134A, and S190A mutant rat beta(1)-ARs stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. To visualize possible antagonist/receptor interactions, the compounds were docked into a three-dimensional model of the wild-type rat beta(1)-AR. The results indicate that Tyr(356(7.43)) is an important aromatic interaction site for five of the eight competitive antagonists studied, whereas none of the compounds appeared to interact directly with Trp(134(3.28)). Only two of the competitive antagonists interacted with Ser(190(4.57)) on tm 4. Overall, the results extend our understanding of how beta(1)-AR competitive antagonists bind to the hydrophobic pocket involving tms 1, 2, 3, and 7; highlight the importance of Tyr(356(7.43)) in this binding pocket; and demonstrate the involvement of tm 4 in competitive antagonist binding.",

The interpretation of autopsy and toxicological data in this case was made difficult due to the extreme putrefaction of the body of the deceased.

    "54": "The effects of atropine and beta-adrenoceptor blockers on mean HR, wave structure of the cardiac rhythm, and chronotropic reaction to noise stress were examined in cats. Atropine (0.5 mg/kg) increased the mean HR and significantly decreased the spectrum power of HF, LF, and VLF oscillations. The decrease in HF power was most pronounced, which enhanced LF/HF ratio. Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) decreased the mean HR and slightly increased the power of HF, LF, and VLF oscillations. Atenolol (2 mg/kg) exerted similar but more pronounced effects. beta-Adrenoceptor blockers increased HF power to a greater extent than LF and VLF power, which led to a decrease in LF/HF ratio. Atropine markedly decreased the chronotropic reaction to stress. beta-Adrenoceptor blockers produced no effect on the amplitude of this reaction, but accelerated restoration of initial HR. It is established that the changes in power spectrum of HR and the phase reflex reactions in cats are mediated by parasympathetic influences; the sympathetic system is involved only in the control of mean HR, probably in response to the level of animal activity. The changes in LF/HF ratio during blockade of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are caused by opposite influences of these systems on HF oscillations, but not by hypothetic \"sympathetic\" and \"parasympathetic\" nature of LF and HF oscillations of the heart rhythm.", 
    "55": "Small-for-size syndrome occurs in the presence of a reduced mass of liver that is insufficient to maintain normal liver function. It has been speculated that this dysfunction is principally associated with graft exposure to excessive portal perfusion. The aim of these cases was to evaluate the efficacy of octreotide, a splanchnic vasoconstrictor, and esmolol, a selective beta-blocker, to modify the portal perfusion in the postoperative phase after left living related liver transplantation (LRLT). Four patients who underwent left LRLT with graft-to-recipient weight ratios of 0.60 +/- 0.24 were studied with a catheter placed in a jejunal vein. We observed high basal values of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and portal vein flow (PVF). Octreotide infusion decreased HVPG, an effect that was more pronounced when it was combined with esmolol. The administration of both drugs was also associated with an improvement in portal vein oxygen saturation. Despite variation in PVF, the plasma disappearance rate of indocyanin green did not change during the infusion of the two drugs. In conclusion, octreotide and esmolol infusion allowed a manipulation of portal vein pressure that should be measured in left LRLT using a small-for-size graft.",

    "57": "Alteration of ECG parameters was investigated in both conscious and anesthetized Beagle dogs (cumulative infusions of D,L-sotalol; n=6). The repolarization reserve of the latter was reduced by neurolept anesthesia using the hERG blocker droperidol (0.25 mg/kg/h yielding mean plasma concentrations of 0.5 microM). Furthermore, hERG K+ current and action potentials (AP; rabbit Purkinje fibers) were measured in vitro.", 
    "58": "The Fridericia corrected QT interval, QTcF, in conscious dogs (control: 254+/-15 ms), was dose-dependently prolonged by D,L-sotalol (+42 ms at plasma levels of 261 microM; dose 30 mg/kg). In anesthetized dogs, baseline QTcF (337+/-35 ms) was already prolonged compared to conscious dogs. In addition, QTcF-increase (+90 ms) was more pronounced at lower D,L-sotalol plasma levels (181 microM; dose 10 mg/kg), and proarrhythmic markers Tpeak-Tend and short term variability of QT were increased. These in vivo findings are supported by in vitro data. The hERG K+ current was blocked by D,L-sotalol (IC50 approximately 1.2 mM, IC20 approximately 250 microM) and droperidol (IC50 approximately 0.1 microM, IC20 approximately 0.02 microM). Purkinje fiber APs were concentration-dependently prolonged by D,L-sotalol (APD90:+60% at 30 microM) and droperidol (APD90:+55% at 1 microM). Low droperidol concentrations increased the sensitivity of Purkinje fibers towards D,L-sotalol-mediated AP prolongation.", 
    "59": "In conclusion, the higher sensitivity of anesthetized dogs towards sotalol-induced QT-prolongation is due to a reduced cardiac repolarization reserve caused by the hERG blocker droperidol.

Propranolol, bunitrolol and imipramine, which are typically substrates of CYP2D subfamilies, were used in the experiment. All the animals of the Canoidea superfamily that were tested lacked the ability to catalyse 7-hydroxylation of propranolol, which is one of the major metabolic pathways in rats. Stereoselectivity of propranolol metabolism was towards (S)-propranolol in all the reactions of the animals tested with the exception of mink, which showed a selective tendency towards (R)-propranolol in N-dealkylation. As far as metabolic patterns of (R)- and (S)-propranolol are concerned, bears, foxes and dogs are alike, but minks are somewhat different. Liver microsomes from mink showed, among the animals of the Canoidea superfamily, the lowest propranolol hydroxylase activity at 4- and 5-positions and imipramine 2-hydroxylation and {N-}demethylation activities. We could not detect bunitrolol 4-hydroxylation in mink liver microsomes at the low substrate concentration used. We conclude that mink have the lowest activity of CYP2D-related xenobiotic metabolism among the Canoidea superfamily.",

An important message in the 2006 Canadian Hypertension Education Program recommendations is to improve patient adherence to antihypertensive therapy by incorporating a number of techniques. These new recommendations still need to be incorporated into what remain as the older but still important considerations for the diagnosis, management and treatment of the patient with hypertension, namely, to assess blood pressure in all adults at all appropriate visits, to expedite the diagnosis of hypertension, to assess and manage global cardiovascular risk, to emphasize that lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy, to treat to target, and to use combinations of antihypertensive medications and lifestyles to achieve recommended targets.

In this study, we investigated whether local angiotensin II (Ang II) activity contributes to the progression of renal injury in aldosterone/salt-induced hypertensive rats. Uninephrectomized rats were treated with 1% NaCl in a drinking solution and one of the following combinations for 6 weeks: vehicle (2% ethanol, s.c.; n=9), aldosterone (0.75 mug/h, s.c.; n=8), aldosterone+Ang II type 1 receptor blocker olmesartan (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.; n=8), or aldosterone+olmesartan (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.; n=9). Aldosterone/salt-treated hypertensive rats exhibited severe proteinuria and renal injury characterized by glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Aldosterone/salt-induced renal injury was associated with augmented expression of angiotensin converting enzyme and Ang II levels in the renal cortex and medullary tissues. Renal cortical and medullary mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as well as the collagen contents were increased in aldosterone/salt-treated hypertensive rats. Treatment with olmesartan (10 or 100 mg/kg/day) had no effect on blood pressure but attenuated proteinuria in a dose-dependent manner. Olmesartan at 10 mg/kg/day tended to decrease renal cortical and medullary Ang II levels, TGF-beta and CTGF expression, and collagen contents; however, these changes were not significant. On the other hand, an ultrahigh dose of olmesartan (100 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased these values and ameliorated renal injury. These data suggest that augmented local Ang II activity contributes, at least partially, to the progression of aldosterone/salt-dependent renal injury.",

Morning blood pressure may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertensive target organ damage. Increased sympathetic nerve activity is reported to be one of the mechanisms of morning hypertension; however, there are no available data that show whether strict home blood pressure control, especially in the morning period, can reduce target organ damage. The Japan Morning Surge-1 (JMS-1) study includes hypertensive outpatients with elevated morning systolic blood pressure (>or=135 mmHg) as assessed by self-measured blood pressure monitoring at home. All enrolled patients are under stable antihypertensive medication status. Exclusion criteria are arrhythmia, chronic inflammatory disease, and taking alpha-blockers or beta-blockers. The target number of patients to be enrolled in the JMS-1 study is 600, and the aim is to evaluate differences in the markers of hypertensive target organ damage, such as brain natriuretic peptide and the urinary albumin excretion/creatinine ratio. All of the patients are randomized to an experimental group or a control group, with randomization to be carried out by telephone interviews with the patients' physicians. In the experimental group, patients begin taking additional antihypertensive medication just before going to bed. This consists of doxazosin 1 mg/day, which then is increased to 2 mg/day and 4 mg/day, with a beta-blocker added after a 1-month interval until the morning systolic blood pressure is controlled to less than 135 mmHg. Patients in the control group continue the treatment they are receiving at the enrollment for 6 months. Blood pressure levels, adverse effects, and hypertensive target organ damage before and after the study are evaluated. In the JMS-1 study, we will evaluate whether strict morning blood pressure control by sympathetic nervous system blockade using an alpha-blocker, doxazosin, and with the addition of a beta-blocker if needed, can reduce hypertensive target organ damage.",

We performed cross-sectional studies on the current status of BP control and the prescription and efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive patients in Japan. The data were also evaluated in subgroups with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) and in winter and summer. Analyses were performed on the collected data of 12,437 treated hypertensive patients in winter and 5,972 in summer 2002. In winter, 50.3% of patients received calcium channel blockers (CCBs), 15.3% received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and 11.0% received angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). In the patients receiving monotherapy, 69% of patients received a CCB, 13% an ACEI and 11.0% an ARB. A total of 2,918 patients received combination therapy, and CCBs were the most frequently (89.6%) prescribed component of such therapy. Prescriptions of beta-blockers (BBs) decreased and those of CCBs and diuretics (D) increased with age (p<0.001). The rate of patients with adequately controlled BP less than 140/90 mmHg was 40.3% in the CCB group, 37.6% in the D group, and 36.9% in the BB group (p<0.001). In patients receiving combination therapy, those with CCB+D had the best rate of BP control (40.7%). The rate of patients with adequately controlled BP was lower in winter than in summer at both a target BP of 140/90 mmHg (36.2% vs. 43.8%, p<0.001) and a target BP of 130/85 mmHg in patients younger than 60 years old (15.5% vs. 18.6%, p<0.02). In diabetic patients, the target BP (130/80 mmHg) was achieved in only 11.3%, which was lower (p<0.05) than the rate in non-diabetic patients (13.1%). In conclusion, the present cross-sectional study showed that CCBs were the most frequently prescribed agent for the treatment of hypertension in Japan. The rate of adequate BP control was less than 50% and was even worse in patients with DM and in winter. Our results indicate that physicians should treat hypertension more intensively to achieve the target BP.",

To assess whether these differential structural effects do translate into different effects on LV function and on heart failure mortality, Bd or sham Bd 8-week-old rats were randomized to vehicle treatment (Vh), chemical sympathectomy ([Sx] 6-hydroxydopamine, 150 mg/kg IP twice a week), beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol [Pro], 40 mg/kg per day PO), or alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (doxazosin [Dox], 5 mg/kg per day PO). After monitoring survival for 10 weeks, the survivors were anesthetized to undergo echocardiography and intraarterial blood pressure measurement. Bd-Vh rats showed increased LV and lung weights, as well as LV dilation, depressed endocardial and midwall fractional shortening and a restrictive transmitral diastolic flow velocity pattern. Compared with Bd-Vh rats, all of the actively treated Bd rats showed less LV hypertrophy, LV dilation, and lung congestion but no less depression of midwall fractional shortening. In contrast, Sx and Dox but not Pro treatment were also associated with lesser degrees of diastolic dysfunction and, even more importantly, with a striking increase in survival (sham banded rats, 100%; Bd-Vh, 40%; Bd-Pro, 51%; Bd-Sx, 83%; and Bd-Dox, 82%). Although Pro, Sx, and Dox provide similar midterm protection from development of LV hypertrophy and dysfunction and from circulatory congestion, only Sx and Dox favorably affected mortality. These findings indicate that in the aortic banding rat model, alpha-adrenoceptors are importantly involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular deterioration and disease progression.", 
    "80": "The role of adrenoceptor subtypes was studied in rat brown adipose tissue (BAT). The type II 5'-deiodinase (5'DII) was activated in response to simultaneous stimulation by beta3- and alpha1-adrenergic agonists, BRL 37344 or CGP 12177, and cirazoline, in brown adipocytes. Inhibition of the alpha1- and beta-adrenergic phenylephrine-stimulated 5'DII activity was obtained by the alpha1-adrenergic antagonists in the order of prazosin >/= wb 4101 > 5-methylurapidil. In comparison, the binding of [3H]prazosin to rat BAT plasma membranes was inhibited by alpha1-adrenergic antagonists in the order of prazosin > WB 4101 = benoxathian > 5-methylurapidil. Although the order of the alpha1-adrenergic competition seemed to be rather typical for the alpha1B-adrenergic receptors, a molecular analysis on adrenoceptor mRNAs should be made to confirm the exact alpha1-adrenergic subtypes at the level of brown adipocytes, since the possibility of a mixture of different receptor subtypes in brown fat cells and/or tissue may interact with the pharmacological characterization. Thus, specific alpha1- and beta-adrenoceptor subtypes participate in the regulation of 5'DII activity in the rat brown adipocytes, and therefore, an impaired alpha1- and beta-adrenergic co-work may be involved in a defective BAT function, e.g., in obese Zucker rats, too. An interesting possibility is that the decreased number of alpha1-adrenoceptors in the BAT of obese Zucker rats is due to the decrease in the alpha1B-adrenoceptor subtype which would further be involved especially in the regulation of BAT 5'DII activity.",

Twenty women assigned to the L-Arg group (32.2%) and 23 to the placebo group (37.7%) were concomitantly treated with antihypertensives before starting the study. Analyzing the subgroup of patients not receiving antihypertensive drugs we found that L-arginine was superior to placebo in lowering systolic (F = 5.42, p < 0.005) and diastolic (F = 2.20, p < 0.005) blood pressure values.",

Injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine into the s.c. tissue of the hind paw of rats produced nociceptive flinch behavior and inflammatory cell migration, that were significantly reduced by the nonspecific selectin inhibitor fucoidan. 5-Hydroxytryptamine-induced nociception was also significantly reduced by local blockade of the 5-HT3 receptor by tropisetron, by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin and by local blockade of the beta1-adrenergic receptor or of the D1 receptor by atenolol or SCH 23390, respectively. Neither guanethidine depletion of norepinephrine in the sympathetic terminals nor local blockade of the beta2-adrenergic receptor by ICI-118,551 significantly reduced 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced nociception. Taken together, these findings indicate that 5-hydroxytryptamine induces nociception by a novel, indirect and norepinephrine-independent mechanism mediated by neutrophil migration and local release of prostaglandin and dopamine. Furthermore, to test whether dopamine acts on beta1-adrenergic and/or D1 receptor to contribute to 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced nociception, dopamine was s.c. injected either alone or combined with atenolol or with SCH 23390. S.c.-injected dopamine also produced a dose-dependent nociceptive behavior that was significantly reduced by both SCH 23390 and atenolol.

One long-standing theory is that physiological overloads such as exercise are intermittent, while pathological overloads such as hypertension are chronic. In this study, we hypothesized that the nature of the stress on the heart, rather than its duration, is the key determinant of the maladaptive phenotype. To test this, we applied intermittent pressure overload on the hearts of mice and tested the roles of duration and nature of the stress on the development of cardiac failure. Despite a mild hypertrophic response, preserved systolic function, and a favorable fetal gene expression profile, hearts exposed to intermittent pressure overload displayed pathological features. Importantly, intermittent pressure overload caused diastolic dysfunction, altered beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) function, and vascular rarefaction before the development of cardiac hypertrophy, which were largely normalized by preventing the recruitment of PI3K by betaAR kinase 1 to ligand-activated receptors. Thus stress-induced activation of pathogenic signaling pathways, not the duration of stress or the hypertrophic growth per se, is the molecular trigger of cardiac dysfunction.",

At death, the left tibial metaphysis and L(4) vertebrae were removed, and microcomputed tomography (Skyscan 1072; Skyscan, Aartselaar, Belgium) was performed for trabecular bone structure investigation. Histomorphometry analysis was performed on the right proximal tibia to assess bone cell activities. After 10 weeks, OVX rats had decreased BMD and trabecular parameters and increased bone turnover, as well as cortical porosity compared with the sham group (p < 0.001). Bone architecture alteration was preserved by 0.1 mg/kg propranolol due to higher trabecular number and thickness (+50.35 and +6.81%, respectively, than OVX; p < 0.001) and lower cortical pore number (-52.38% than OVX; p < 0.001). Animals treated by 0.1 mg/kg propranolol had a lower osteoclast surface and a higher osteoblast activity compared with OVX. Animals treated by 20 mg of propranolol did not significantly differ from OVX rats. Animals treated by 5 mg of propranolol have been partially preserved from the ovariectomy. These results showed a dose effect of beta-blockers. The lower the dose of propranolol breeding, the better the preventive effect against ovariectomy.",

    "142": "Dietary salt restriction is associated with evidence of low insulin sensitivity. The current study was undertaken to investigate whether sympathetic nervous system and l-arginine-nitric oxide pathway activities are linked to insulin resistance in rats under chronic low salt intake. Male Wistar rats were fed a low (LSD) or normal (NSD) salt diet from weaning to adulthood. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed in 4 sub-groups on each diet: (1) sympathetic nervous system blockade (propranolol and prazosin), (2) vehicle, (3) L-arginine, and (4) D-arginine. Blood pressure, heart rate and metabolic measurements were done before and 45 min after drug infusion and at the end of the clamp. At baseline conditions, body weight, hematocrit, blood glucose, plasma insulin, cholesterol, and triacylglycerols were higher in LSD than in NSD rats. Systolic blood pressure was lower and heart rate was higher in rats on LSD than on NSD. Glucose uptake was lower on LSD compared to NSD. Sympathetic nervous system blockade and L-arginine did, and vehicle and D-arginine did not improve glucose uptake in LSD rats. On NSD there was no effect of any of the infused drugs. A positive correlation between plasma nitrate and nitrite at the end of clamp and glucose uptake was observed in L-arginine--but not in D-arginine-infused LSD rats. These results provide evidence that the sympathetic nervous system and the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway are involved in the glucose uptake impairment induced by chronic dietary salt restriction.",

Time to ST segment depression was significantly longer after chinapril treatment: 394 vs 298 s (placebo) p = 0,01) vs 277 s (baseline), p = 0,008.

    "144": "beta-Adrenoceptors mediate urinary bladder relaxation, and gender, age and hypertension have been linked to bladder dysfunction. Therefore, we have studied whether any of these factors affects the ability of beta-adrenoceptor agonists to relax rat bladder detrusor muscle in vitro. For this purpose we have compared male and female Wistar rats, young and old male Wistar rats, and male normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Comparisons were done using KCl-precontracted bladder strips (length about 15-20 mm) and the endogenous agonist noradrenaline, the synthetic non-subtype-selective agonist isoprenaline, and the prototypical beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists BRL 37,344 and CGP 12,177. While all agonists yielded numerically weaker relaxation in female as compared to male rats (for example for noradrenaline E(max) 40+/-4% vs 53+/-6% relaxation, pEC(50) 5.41+/-0.13 vs 5.60+/-0.14), this difference reached statistical significance only for the weak partial agonist CGP 12,177. Responses to all agonists were attenuated in old as compared to young rats, largely due to a reduced maximum effect, although the difference did not reach statistical significance for isoprenaline. The maximum relaxation responses to noradrenaline and isoprenaline were significantly lower in SHR than in normotensive rats, but both strains exhibited similar responses to the partial agonist BRL 37,344. We conclude that factors associated with bladder dysfunction, such as gender, age and hypertension, can be associated with impaired beta-adrenoceptor-mediated bladder relaxation. However, these alterations are not always consistent across various agonists, and the extent of the differences can be small. Therefore, we propose that beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction may contribute to the pathophysiology of such conditions, but is unlikely to be the only or even the major factor in this regard. We speculate that beta-adrenoceptor agonists may be effective in the treatment of bladder dysfunction under all of these conditions.",

Hyperglycemia has emerged as an important marker of outcome in the operating room. Intensive insulin therapy promises to reduce health risk in the surgical and critical care setting. Perioperative beta-blocker and statin therapy are likely to reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients.

The discovery and development of carvedilol encountered an adverse regulatory climate, skepticism by the cardiology community and hesitance by the company, and in the early 1990s, the fate of the drug was uncertain. Nonetheless, in the largest heart failure study conducted up until that point, carvedilol produced marked reductions in morbidity and mortality, and has given new hope to patients afflicted with congestive heart failure. The story behind carvedilol contains important observations and lessons for scientists, regulators and physicians.", 
    "153": "The present work addressed possible alterations in the pharmacokinetics and the in vivo pharmacodynamic of metoprolol (MET) in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) animals by means of the microdialysis technique. The correlation between MET unbound plasma concentrations and its pharmacological effects, such as heart rate and blood pressure change, was also examined in SH and WKY rats by the application of a PK-PD model. MET dialysate concentrations and its chronotropic and blood pressure effect were determined during 3 h after the administration of 3 and 10 mg.kg(-1) of the drug. A PK-PD model with a separate effect compartment was used to analyse the data. A good correlation between plasma MET concentrations and its hypotensive and chronotropic effect was found in all experimental groups. Although a greater maximal effect (E(max)) for the antihypertensive effect of MET was observed in SH rats (WKY: E(max): -17+/-1 mmHg; SH: E(max): -28+/-4 mmHg; P<0.05 versus WKY rats), no differences were found in the concentration yielding half-maximal response (IC(50)) comparing SH (IC(50): 583+/-146 ng x ml(-1)) and WKY animals (IC(50): 639+/-187 ng x ml(-1)). The bradycardic effect of MET was greater in SH rats (E(max): -29+/-1%, P<0.05 versus WKY rats) than in WK animals (E(max): -22+/-2%), but no differences were observed in the IC(50) comparing both experimental groups (WKY: IC(50): 187+/-53 ng x ml(-1); SH: IC(50): 216+/-62 ng x ml(-1)). Pharmacokinetic analysis shows that the volume of distribution of MET was greater in SH rats (Vd: 3.4+/-0.5 l, P<0.05 versus WKY rats) with regard to Wistar Kyoto (WKY) animals (Vd: 1.9+/-0.2 l). The results suggest that the pharmacokinetic behaviour of metoprolol are modified in SH rats, resulting in an increased volume of distribution. A greater maximal efficacy to the hypotensive effect of metoprolol was observed in SH rats, suggesting participation of beta-adrenoceptors in the maintenance of the hypertension. Also, a greater chronotropic response to metoprolol was found in the hypertensive group compared with WKY animals, suggesting that, at least in part, the greater cardiac effect of metoprolol explained the enhanced hypotensive response of the beta blocker in the SH animals.",

Levels of NO were significantly increased at 10(-6)mol/L and reached a plateau state at 10(-5)mol/L. Induction of NO is not a general action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, as atenolol had no effects. Nebivolol action on NO release was mainly caused by the D-isomer. Moreover NO production is also maintained after hepatic metabolism, as the three main metabolites of nebivolol were able to induce a significant increase in endothelial NO release. Finally, nebivolol-activated calcium mobilization is crucial to NO production.",

    "158": "Hyperinsulinaemia/euglycaemia therapy (HIET) consists of the infusion of high-dose regular insulin (usually 0.5 to 1 IU/kg per hour) combined with glucose to maintain euglycaemia. HIET has been proposed as an adjunctive approach in the management of overdose of calcium-channel blockers (CCBs). Indeed, experimental data and clinical experience, although limited, suggest that it could be superior to conventional pharmacological treatments including calcium salts, adrenaline (epinephrine) or glucagon. This paper reviews the patho-physiological principles underlying HIET. Insulin administration seems to allow the switch of the cell metabolism from fatty acids to carbohydrates that is required in stress conditions, especially in the myocardium and vascular smooth muscle, resulting in an improvement in cardiac contractility and restored peripheral resistances. Studies in experimental verapamil poisoning in dogs have shown that HIET significantly improves metabolism, haemodynamics and survival in comparison with conventional therapies. Clinical experience currently consists only of a few isolated cases or short series in which the administration of HIET substantially improved cardiovascular conditions in life-threatening CCB poisonings, allowing the progressive discontinuation of vasoactive agents. While we await further well-designed clinical trials, some rational recommendations are made about the use of HIET in severe CBB overdose. Although the mechanism of action is less well understood in this condition, some experimental data suggesting a potential benefit of HIET in beta-adrenergic blocker toxicity are discussed; clinical data are currently lacking.",

Clinical proof of the antianginal efficacy and tolerability of ivabradine comes from the largest clinical development programme that has ever been performed in stable angina, involving more than 5000 patients. Ivabradine was shown to be as effective as well-established reference antianginal drugs, such as beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. It is well tolerated and is free of the most commonly observed side effects of currently prescribed antianginal drugs. It offers clear therapeutic benefits for a whole range of patients with stable angina, including those with contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers.",

The role of non-pharmacological physical manoeuvres is increasingly recognised, given the increasing clinical trial data supporting their efficacy.

A careful interpretation of their results showed the limited efficacy of currently available antiarrhythmic drugs in maintaining sinus rhythm, as well as their potentially serious side effects. Therefore, it is imperative to develop safer and more effective drugs for AF. Based on our improved understanding of the pathophysiology of AF and the mechanism of action of antiarrhythmic drugs, significant efforts are being made to develop new antiarrhythmic agents that would prevent electrophysiological remodelling, would be selective for the atria and, therefore, would not prolong ventricular repolarisation, thus lacking any proarrhythmic effect.", 
    "162": "High-level expression of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in functional form is required for structure-function studies. The main goal of the present work was to improve expression levels of beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) so that biophysical studies involving EPR, NMR, and crystallography can be pursued. Toward this objective, the total synthesis of a codon-optimized hamster beta2-AR gene suitable for high-level expression in mammalian systems has been accomplished. Transient expression of the gene in COS-1 cells resulted in 18 +/- 3 pmol beta2-AR/mg of membrane protein, as measured by saturation binding assay using the beta2-AR antagonist [3H] dihydroalprenolol. Previously, we reported the development of an HEK293S tetracycline-inducible system for high-level expression of rhodopsin. Here, we describe construction of beta2-AR stable cell lines using the HEK293S-TetR-inducible system, which, after induction, express wild-type beta2-AR at levels of 220 +/- 40 pmol/mg of membrane protein corresponding to 50 +/- 8 microg/15-cm plate. This level of expression is the highest reported so far for any wild-type GPCR, other than rhodopsin. The yield of functional receptor using the single-step affinity purification is 12 +/- 3 microg/15-cm plate. This level of expression now makes it feasible to pursue structure-function studies using EPR. Furthermore, scale-up of beta2-AR expression using suspension cultures in a bioreactor should now allow production of enough beta2-AR for the application of biophysical techniques such as NMR spectroscopy and crystallography.", 
    "163": "We have previously shown that a permanent deficiency in the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may increase the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rate. In this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain RAS in the cardiac reactivity to the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) agonist isoproterenol (Iso). Transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen (TGR) were used. In isolated hearts, Iso induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular (LV) pressure and maximal contraction (+dP/dt(max)) in the TGR than in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. LV hypertrophy induced by Iso treatment was significantly higher in TGR than in SD rats (in g LV wt/100 g body wt, 0.28 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.004, respectively). The greater LV hypertrophy in TGR rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta-AR and upregulation of LV beta-AR kinase-1 mRNA levels compared with those in SD rats. The decrease in the heart rate (HR) induced by the beta-AR antagonist metoprolol in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in TGR compared with SD rats (-9.9 +/- 1.7% vs. -18.1 +/- 1.5%), whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by atropine on HR was similar in both strains. These results indicate that TGR are more sensitive to beta-AR agonist-induced cardiac inotropic response and hypertrophy, possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart.",

    "174": "Capsazepine is known as a transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subfamily 1 (TRPV(1)) antagonist that inhibits bronchoconstriction evoked in animals by TRPV(1) agonists. In this study, effects of capsazepine and chemically related analogues, so called capsazepinoids, were examined in vitro on contractile effects in human small airway preparations. Repeated cycles with 1h of LTD(4)-free physiological saline solution followed by 30min exposure to LTD(4) (10nM) demonstrated that the contractile responsiveness of the preparations exhibited little change over time despite repeated challenges (>12h). Capsazepine (1-100microM) reversibly and concentration-dependently inhibited the contractile response to LTD(4) with EC(50) approximately 10microM and approximately 90% relaxation at 100microM. Capsazepine (10microM) was approximately equally effective to attenuate the contractions evoked by several different inflammatory contractile agonists (LTD(4), PGD(2), histamine), and it relaxed preparations with established tonic contraction due to LTD(4). Higher concentrations of capsazepine were needed to relax ACh-contractions. The effect of capsazepine on LTD(4)-induced contractions was not significantly reduced by pre-treating the preparations with either of propranolol (10microM)+atropine (1microM), L-NAME (1mM), indomethacin (1microM), iberiotoxin (0.1microM), capsaicin (10microM), and nifedipine (10microM). Although the mechanism of action of the present capsazepine-induced bronchorelaxation remains unknown it emerged here that they represent a generally effective principle exerting a functional antagonism against contractile mediators but distinct from beta receptor agonists and inhibitors of L-type calcium channels. The inhibitory effect of capsazepine is shared by chemical analogues, but not with other TRPV(1) antagonists, suggesting the possibility that capsazepine represents a novel class of bronchorelaxants effective in human small airways. These findings were not predicted by previous observations that have concerned quite limited effects of capsazepine on airway tone in different animal test systems. If potency can be further increased and the results translated to in vivo, compounds representing the capsazepinoid class of bronchorelaxants might become useful in the treatment of patients suffering from asthma and COPD.",

The disruption of lipid rafts significantly inhibited 2CdA-induced apoptosis, indicating the crucial role of lipid rafts in the induction of apoptosis in leukemia cells. These reagents significantly inhibited 2CdA-induced elevation of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in MOLT-4 cells, and 2CdA-induced apoptosis was partly inhibited by the Ca(2+) chelators BAPTA-AM and EGTA, and the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine. On the other hand, they had no effects on the cellular uptake of 2CdA. These results indicated that lipid rafts partly contributed to 2CdA-induced apoptosis by regulating Ca(2+) influx via the plasma membrane.",

    "182": "The receptor mechanism of testosterone-induced nongenomic Ca2+ signaling in prostate cancer cells is poorly understood. In this study we investigated androgen-induced intracellular Ca2+ increases in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells with Fura-2 as a Ca2+ probe. 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) produced fast and transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ in LNCaP cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects were abolished by extracellular Ca2+ removal or pretreatment with L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitors (nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem). Pretreatment with endoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor blocker (procaine) or phospholipase C inhibitor (neomycin sulfate) did not alter DHT-induced Ca2+ influx. The concentration of Ca2+ was also increased by impermeable testosterone conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Neither an antagonist of intracellular androgen receptors (cyproterone acetate) nor a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide) affected this fast Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, the effect of DHT was abolished in cells incubated with a G protein inhibitor (pertussis toxin) and a nonhydrolyzable analog of guanosine triphosphate (guanosine 5-[beta-thio]disphosphate) but not in cells incubated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. These results indicate that androgens induced an L-type calcium channel-dependent intracellular Ca2+ increase in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The rapid responses triggered by DHT did not appear to be mediated through classic intracellular androgen receptors, c-Src kinase-androgen receptor complex, or sex hormone-binding globulin but through a G protein-coupled receptor in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. These results may provide a new explanation for progression of prostate cancer.",

In this regard, over the last decade, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade has become an important component in drug therapy of congestive heart failure in the adult population. A third-generation beta-blocker, carvedilol, has now been shown in adult trials to be efficacious in the treatment of heart failure and has been shown to be superior to other similarly used beta-blockers. Carvedilol use has been adapted into pediatric heart failure practice although data supporting its efficacy in infants and children are scarce. This review will describe the application of carvedilol in the adult, as it pertains to pediatric practice, review the existing pediatric literature and describe our institution's experience with carvedilol in heart failure therapy.", 
    "184": "Elevations in serum cardiac troponins are used to diagnose myocardial infarction caused by ischemic heart disease. Several other conditions result in elevated cardiac makers in the absence of significant coronary artery disease. While not commonly recognized elevations of troponin I (TNI) may be seen in patients with protracted arrhythmias. We describe three patients with prolonged tachycardia, heart rates of 200-260 beats per minute, who had elevated TNI (0.81-4.6 ng/ml) but no significant coronary artery disease. Two patients presented with ventricular tachycardia and one had an atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia. None of the patients presented with symptomatic hypotension. Coronary angiography in all three patients did not demonstrate significant coronary artery disease. The finding of an elevated TNI level may be the result of tachycardia and not myocardial infarction related to ischemic heart disease.", 
    "185": "Despite the availability of a variety of effective antihypertensive drugs, inadequate control of blood pressure is common in hypertensive patients. The aim of this study was investigate whether the alpha-adducin G460W polymorphism or angiotensinogen M235T polymorphism has an effect on the mean difference in blood pressure in subjects using antihypertensive drugs. Data from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study in the Netherlands, was used. This study started in 1990 and included 7983 subjects of 55 years and older. Data from three examination rounds were used. Subjects were included when their blood pressure was elevated at 1 or more examinations and/or a diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium antagonist, or ACE inhibitor was used. A marginal generalized linear model was used to assess the drug-gene interaction. In total, 3025 hypertensives were included. No drug-gene interaction on blood pressure levels was found. The mean difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between subjects with the W-allele and GG genotype of the alpha-adducin gene was for diuretic users 1.25 mmHg (95% CI:-2.86 to 5.35), for beta-blockers 0.02 mmHg (95% CI:-3.39 to 3.42), for calcium antagonists -0.70 mmHg (95% CI:-5.61 to 4.21), and for ACE inhibitors -3.50 mmHg (95% CI:-9.02 to 2.02). The mean difference in SBP between subjects with the TT and MM genotype was for diuretic users -2.33 mmHg (95% CI:-8.32 to 3.66), for beta-blocker -0.06 mmHg (95% CI:-4.91 to 4.79), for calcium antagonist 0.59 mmHg (95% CI:-5.95 to 7.13), and for ACE inhibitor -2.33 mmHg (95% CI:-9.66 to 5.01). The G460W polymorphism and the M235T polymorphism did not modify the difference in blood pressure levels among subjects who used diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, or ACE inhibitors.", 
    "186": "Pharmacological treatment of hypertension represents a cost-effective way of preventing cardiovascular and renal complications. To benefit maximally from antihypertensive treatment, blood pressure should be brought to below 140/90 mmHg in every hypertensive patient, and even lower (< 130/80 mmHg) if diabetes or renal disease co-exists. Such targets cannot usually be reached using monotherapies. This is especially true in patients who present with a high cardiovascular risk. The co-administration of two agents acting by different mechanisms considerably increases the blood pressure control rate. Such combinations are not only efficacious, but are also well tolerated, and some fixed low-dose combinations even have a placebo-like tolerability. This is the case for the preparation containing the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (2 mg) and the diuretic indapamide (0.625 mg), a fixed low-dose combination that has been shown in controlled trials to be more effective than monotherapies in reducing albuminuria, regressing cardiac hypertrophy and improving the stiffness of large arteries. Using this combination to initiate antihypertensive therapy has been shown in a double-blind trial (Strategies of Treatment in Hypertension: Evaluation; STRATHE) to normalize blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg) in significantly more patients (62%) than a sequential monotherapy approach based on atenolol, losartan and amlodipine (49%) and a stepped-care strategy based on valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (47%), with no difference between the three arm groups in terms of tolerability. An ongoing randomized trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation; ADVANCE) is a study with a 2 x 2 factorial design assessing the effects of the fixed-dose perindopril-indapamide combination and of the intensive gliclazide modified release-based glucose control regimen in type 2 diabetic patients, with or without hypertension. A total of 11 140 patients were randomly selected. Within the first 6 weeks of treatment (run-in phase), the perindopril-indapamide combination lowered blood pressure from 145/81 +/- 22/11 mmHg (mean +/- SD) to 137/78 +/- 20/10 mmHg. Fixed-dose combinations are becoming more and more popular for the management of hypertension, and are even proposed by hypertension guidelines as a first-line option to treat hypertensive patients.", 
    "187": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is released by immune cells and is thought to play a key role in chemotaxis and the onset of the inflammatory response. The question remains whether this lipid mediator also contributes to the enhanced sensitivity of nociceptive neurons that is associated with inflammation. Therefore we examined whether S1P alters the excitability of small diameter, capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons by measuring action potential (AP) firing and two of the membrane currents critical in regulating the properties of the AP. External application of S1P augments the number of APs evoked by a depolarizing current ramp. The enhanced firing is associated with a decrease in the rheobase and an increase in the resistance at firing threshold although neither the firing threshold nor the resting membrane potential are changed. Treatment with S1P enhanced the tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium current and decreased the total outward potassium current (IK). When sensory neurons were internally perfused with GDP-beta-S, a blocker of G protein activation, the S1P-induced increase in APs was completely blocked and suggests the excitatory actions of S1P are mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors called endothelial differentiation gene or S1PR. In contrast, internal perfusion with GDP-beta-S and S1P increased the number of APs evoked by the current ramp. These results and our finding that the mRNAs for S1PRs are expressed in both the intact dorsal root ganglion and cultures of adult sensory neurons supports the notion that S1P acts on S1PRs linked to G proteins. Together these findings demonstrate that S1P can regulate the excitability of small diameter sensory neurons by acting as an external paracrine-type ligand through activation of G-protein-coupled receptors and thus may contribute to the hypersensitivity during inflammation.", 
    "188": "To explore whether prescription of evidence-based drug therapy is associated with better quality of life (QoL) in patients with heart failure (HF).", 
    "189": "Patients (n = 62) were recruited in the outpatient clinic of Groningen University Hospital. Inclusion criteria were previous diagnosis of HF, age 40-80 years; ejection fraction of less than 45%, free from other serious disease (such as cancer) and psychiatric problems in the last year. QoL was assessed with the RAND 36-item health survey questionnaire, on five scales: physical functioning, mental health, social functioning, vitality and general health perception. Medication prescribed for 1 to 6 months before the QoL assessment was classified as either evidence-based treatment or under-treatment, according to the 2001 European guidelines on optimal HF treatment. The study had a cross-sectional design.", 
    "190": "QoL did not differ significantly between evidence-based and under-treated patients, unadjusted or after adjustment for significant patient imbalances.", 
    "191": "Conventional step-up medication approach in HF may have a positive impact on survival or morbidity, but it seems not beneficial in relation to QoL. Other interventions should be designed to improve QoL of patients with HF.", 
    "192": "Although usually self-limiting, central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) may recur or adopt a chronic course, with permanent impairment of visual acuity. Previously suggested treatments for nonresolving or recurrent CSCR have included invasive techniques, such as laser photocoagulation and intravitreal triamcinolone. We evaluated the evidence for epinephrine in the pathophysiology of CSCR and the role beta-blockade may play in treating this condition.", 
    "193": "This study was comprised of a literature review and interventional case report. Two (2) patients with nonresolving or recurrent CSCR were commenced on a trial of oral propranolol 40 mg twice a day and followed up at monthly intervals. Visual acuity, metamorphopsia, and central retinal thickness quantified by ocular coherence tomography (OCT) were recorded at baseline and follow-up visits.", 
    "194": "Two successive trials of propranolol in 1 patient and a trial in a 2nd patient with recurrent CSCR were associated with an improvement in visual acuity, symptoms, and retinal thickness. One (1) patient demonstrated recovery, remission, and subsequent rerecovery, which coincided with the commencement, cessation, and retreatment with propranolol.", 
    "195": "Although there may have been a spontaneous improvement without treatment, beta-blockade has a plausible mechanism or action in CSCR."
