    "0": "The serotonin-containing raphe-spinal pathway has been implicated as playing an important role in analgesia. Several studies, however, have reported the inefficacy of traditional serotonin receptor antagonists at reversing the antinociceptive action of electrical stimulation in the raphe. In the light of recent reports on the existence of several types of 5-HT receptors in rat spinal cord, the present study investigated the ability of two antagonists, selective for two different 5-HT receptors to reverse the effects of focal electrical stimulation of the raphe magnus nucleus in the rat. Electrical stimulation of this nucleus resulted in selective antinociceptive as well as non-selective inhibitory effects on dorsal horn neurones. Both these effects were blocked by the ionophoretic application of a 5-HT1, but not a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. The study presents data supporting the role of a spinal 5-HT receptor in mediating stimulation-produced analgesia from the nucleus raphe magnus and further, furnishes evidence that the 5-HT1 receptor is involved in antinociception at the spinal level.", 
    "1": "C6 glioma cells possess both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. In response to exposure to isoproterenol, these cells down-regulated the mRNA for both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors in a manner that indicates an independent regulatory mechanism for each subtype. In particular, the mRNA species for the beta 1-adrenergic receptor initially increased two-fold during the first hour of exposure before decreasing to 40% of initial levels at 4 hours after exposure. In contrast, the beta 2 mRNA species decreased rapidly and monotonically to 20% of initial levels by 2 hours. The unique response to isoproterenol of each subtype was blocked by the appropriate subtype-specific antagonists, betaxolol and ICI 118,551. In addition, beta-adrenergic receptor mRNA down-regulation was observed in association with contact inhibition, suggesting that events other than receptor occupancy can regulate beta-adrenergic receptor mRNA levels.", 
    "2": "Stimulation of platelets with thrombin leads to rapid degradation of inositol phospholipids, generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Previous studies indicated that prior activation of PKC with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) desensitizes platelets to thrombin stimulation, as indicated by a decreased production of inositol phosphates and decreased Ca2+ mobilization. This suggests that PKC activation generates negative-feedback signals, which limit the phosphoinositide response. To test this hypothesis further, we examined the effects of PKC activators and inhibitors on thrombin-stimulated DAG mass formation in platelets. Pretreatment with PMA abolishes thrombin-stimulated DAG formation (50% inhibition at 60 nM). Pretreatment of platelets with the PKC inhibitors K252a or staurosporine potentiates DAG production in response to thrombin (3-4-fold) when using concentrations required to inhibit platelet PKC (1-10 microM). K252a does not inhibit phosphorylation of endogenous DAG or phosphorylation of a cell-permeant DAG in unstimulated platelets, indicating that DAG over-production is not due to inhibition of DAG kinase. Sphingosine, a PKC inhibitor with a different mechanism of action, also potentiates DAG formation in response to thrombin. Several lines of evidence indicate that DAG formation under the conditions employed occurs predominantly by phosphoinositide (and not phosphatidylcholine) hydrolysis: (1) PMA alone does not elicit DAG formation, but inhibits agonist-stimulated DAG formation; (2) thrombin-stimulated DAG formation is inhibited by neomycin (1-10 mM) but not by the phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor propranolol; and (3) no metabolism of radiolabelled phosphatidylcholine was observed upon stimulation by thrombin or PMA. These data provide strong support for a role of PKC in limiting the extent of platelet phosphoinositide hydrolysis.", 
    "3": "The significance of potential second messengers as mediators of the metabolic effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was explored by studying their role in stimulating hepatic lipogenesis. Platelet-activating factor and prostaglandins have previously been suggested to mediate some of the toxic effects of TNF. An inhibitor of platelet-activating factor (WEB 2086) and two inhibitors of the synthesis of prostaglandins (ibuprofen and aspirin) had no effect on the ability of TNF to increase hepatic lipogenesis or serum triglyceride levels in the rat. Another inhibitor of the toxic effects of TNF, pentoxifylline, also had no effect on lipid metabolism in the rat. Catecholamines are increased after TNF administration, but alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade did not prevent the lipogenic effects of TNF. However, interleukin 6, a cytokine whose synthesis and secretion are induced by TNF, is able to acutely stimulate hepatic lipogenesis in mice. Interleukin 6 stimulates hepatic lipogenesis by increasing hepatic citrate concentrations, the same mechanism by which TNF stimulates hepatic lipogenesis. These data suggest that interleukin 6, but not platelet-activating factor, prostaglandins, or catecholamines, could potentially mediate the lipogenic effects of TNF.", 
    "4": "Although the beneficial effects of long-term therapy with beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are established, the effect of this therapy on the cardiac event rate in patients recovering from a non-Q-wave AMI is unknown. This post hoc analysis of the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) evaluates the effects of daily administration of propranolol 180 or 240 mg/day after non-Q-wave AMI. The study population consisted of 601 patients with enzymatically proven non-Q-wave AMI, which represented 17% of the BHAT patients. Of these, 310 patients were randomized to receive propranolol and 291 patients to placebo. There were no significant baseline differences between groups. The median follow-up was 24.6 months. Mortality was 7.8% (sudden death 4.8%) in the propranolol group and 7.9% (sudden death 4.8%) in the placebo group (p greater than 0.99, log rank test). Reinfarction rate was 7.4% in the propranolol group and 6.5% in the placebo group (p greater than 0.63, log rank test). The need for coronary bypass surgery was similar in the 2 groups. However, more patients randomized to placebo developed angina. In this post hoc group analysis of the BHAT, propranolol was not shown to be beneficial in reducing the cardiac event rate in patients recovering from a non-Q-wave AMI.", 
    "5": "In the framework of the secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction the interaction between physical conditioning (pK) and medicamentous therapy was analysed and a retrospective evaluation of the therapy was performed during the rehabilitation phase III. During the physical conditioning (n = 110) in 31% of the patients changes of the medicamentous therapy rendered themselves necessary (15% increase of the dose, 16% reduction of the dose and withdrawal of a medicament, respectively). In the rehabilitation phase III (n = 277) 72% of the patients were given nitrates, 68% calcium antagonists and 55% beta-receptor blocking agents (43% double, 29% triple combinations) and 15% digitoxin. The aim of the medicamentous therapy is the treatment of the myocardial ischaemia and its sequels, taking into consideration the positive effects of the physical conditioning and the influence on the quality of life.", 
    "6": "To test the hypothesis that long-term beta- or calcium-antagonist therapy begun before the time of myocardial infarction and coronary reperfusion might improve patient in-hospital survival compared with reperfusion alone, 424 consecutive patients successfully reperfused with coronary angioplasty within 12 hours of infarct symptom onset were carefully and retrospectively characterized. Forty-seven patients (11%) were taking beta antagonists and 74 patients (17%) were taking calcium antagonists at the time of infarction. Patients receiving beta antagonists had a more frequent history of hypertension (p less than or equal to 0.001) and prior infarction (p less than or equal to 0.01) than those not so treated and patients receiving calcium antagonists had a more frequent history of prior infarction, prior angina, hypertension and diabetes (all p less than or equal to 0.001) than their nontreated counterparts. Stepwise logistic regression analysis found significant independent correlations between in-hospital death and the following variables: recurrent ischemia (p less than or equal to 0.001); proximal left anterior descending coronary infarct (p less than or equal to 0.001); 3-vessel disease (p = 0.002); patient age (p = 0.004); and initial total occlusion of the infarct artery (p = 0.022). After adjustment for these factors, beta antagonist use (mortality = 0 vs 8% without treatment) was still significantly correlated with improved survival (p = 0.048), whereas calcium-antagonist therapy made no difference in survival. Heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure upon presentation were significantly lower in patients treated with beta antagonists. Thus, beta-antagonists therapy, but probably not calcium-antagonist therapy, taken before reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction, may improve early survival compared to reperfusion alone. Larger studies will be required to confirm or refute these observations.", 
    "7": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for the direct resolution and optimization of the separation of timolol enantiomers. The method involves the use of a cellulose tris-3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate chiral stationary phase (OD-Chiralcel) column. The effects of concentration of 2-propanol, various aliphatic alcohols and diethylamine in the mobile phase and column temperature on the retention and enantioselectivity of timolol enantiomers were studied. The maximum resolution factor obtained was 4.00 when using the solvent system hexane-2-propanol (95:5) containing 0.4% (v/v) diethylamine at 5 degrees C.", 
    "8": "Pretreatment of guinea pigs with adrenaline, isoprenaline or terbutaline for 7 days significantly reduced the Bmax for the radioligand [125I]cyanopindolol (ICYP) in the gastrocnemius muscle (beta 2-adrenoceptors). Pretreatment of guinea pigs with terbutaline reduced the responsiveness of gastrocnemius muscle slices adenylate cyclase to isoprenaline (10(-4) M). In the left ventricle (predominantly beta 1-adrenoceptors) pretreatment of guinea pigs with isoprenaline or adrenaline for 7 days did not alter the Bmax for ICYP. The responsiveness of adenylate cyclase to isoprenaline (10(-4) M) in left ventricle slices was significantly reduced following isoprenaline pretreatment of the guinea pigs. Thus desensitisation of beta-adrenoceptors in left ventricle and skeletal muscle developed following chronic agonist pretreatment. Reduction of beta 2-adrenoceptors in the skeletal muscle could be responsible for the desensitisation of adenylate cyclase. In the left ventricle the receptors were resistant to agonist induced down-regulation. It is proposed that other mechanisms which are tissue- and species-specific independent of the receptor subtype can be responsible for agonist-induced desensitisation in the left ventricle of the guinea pig in vivo.", 
    "9": "Perfusion of rat livers with polyvanadate, but not metavanadate, was found to increase in plasma membrane and decrease in cytosol protein kinase C activity, similar to that obtained with phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist. The effect was prevented by phenoxybenzamine, but not by propranolol implicating alpha-adrenergic receptor activation. Comparison of crystal structures of decavanadate and nonadrenaline revealed the occurrence of a structural feature of O-O-O(N) with distances of 5.5 A and 2.9 A.", 
    "10": "Betablockers were introduced in Hepatology 10 years ago as vasoactive drugs to reduce portal pressure. Utilization to prevent recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with portal hypertension has been widely evaluated through the years. More recently, this approach has been used to prevent a first variceal bleeding episode. Meta-analysis evaluation of 5 large controlled trials shows that with P-blockers, first hemorrhagic episode ocurred in 10% verus 30% which ocurred with placebo after one year. Re-bleeding episodes with beta-blockers ocurred in 44% of the patients after 2 years of followup and in 65% of patients receiving placebo.",

The electrodes, based on ion-pair complexes with dinonylnaphthalenesulphonate or with tetra(2-chlorophenyl)borate show near-Nernstian responses down to 10(-5)M drug concentration. Their selectivity relative to various inorganic and organic cations is reported. Direct potentiometry is used to determine beta-blocker drugs both in aqueous solutions and pharmaceutical preparations, with good results.", 
    "12": "The systemic bioavailability of propranolol was evaluated following oral and transdermal administration in rabbits. Using a four-way crossover study, the bioavailability of propranolol following oral administration was determined to be 12.3 +/- 5.9%, indicating that propranolol is subject to extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism in rabbits. Transdermal delivery of propranolol, via an adhesive delivery device, resulted in a bioavailability of 74.8 +/- 10.1%, indicating that the transdermal delivery of propranolol can significantly increase systemic bioavailability over oral administration. Skin irritation studies indicated that neither propranolol nor the adhesive used in the device caused any appreciable skin irritation.", 
    "13": "Intrauterine fetal supraventricular tachycardia (FSVT) is a rare condition which is connected with organic heart disease in 4-10 per cent. Intrauterine pharmacologic cardioversion with digoxin and verapamil has been recommended previously. However, during pregnancy standard doses of digoxin result in suboptimal concentrations in the maternal serum and fetal therapeutic concentrations might demand doses inconvenient to the mother. Verapamil is not always effective. In this report we describe a case of FSVT. The arrhythmia was treated by administering sotalol to the mother after verapamil had failed to alter the fetal heart rate. This ist the first report of a fetal cardioversion with sotalol. We conclude that sotalol may be useful in the treatment of FSVT that is refractory to digoxin or verapamil.", 
    "14": "An antibody raised against rat P450dbl was used to examine the heterogeneity of the human enzyme involved in the sparteine/debrisoquine polymorphism. The extent to which the antibody was able to inhibit sparteine metabolism varied in different human livers (10-80%, n = 9) and reflected the amount of sparteine metabolism carried out by the polymorphic P450IID6 in individual liver specimens. The individual sample variation in inhibition by the antibody correlated with the inhibition caused by quinidine, a prototype competitive inhibitor of the P450IID6 enzyme active site. Western immunoblots of the liver microsomes confirmed that the variation in the inhibition of sparteine metabolism by this antibody reflected the amount of P450IID6 protein. In addition, a detailed study of one of the livers (K19) which demonstrated a lack of inhibition by the antibody was performed which confirmed the lack of P450IID6 in this liver specimen and suggested that the nascent sparteine metabolism activity was due to other forms of P450.", 
    "15": "One of the beta blockers propranolol (5 or 20 mg/kg) or atenolol (5 or 20 mg/kg) or the alpha-2 agonist clonidine (20 or 100 micrograms/kg) was administered in the drinking water to pregnant Wistar rats over gestation days 1 to 21. Maternal weight gain, litter size or litter weight were unaffected as were a number of measures of physical and behavioral development. The rats were raised after weaning in either enriched or impoverished housing. At maturity, male but not female rats that had been prenatally exposed to either of the three drugs weighed less than the controls. Testing for cognitive function using an automated version of the Hebb-Williams maze indicated impaired spatial maze problem solving ability for female rats that had been exposed to propranolol (20 mg/kg) and raised in impoverishment. Generally, enriched-reared rats committed fewer errors on the maze problems. Prenatal exposure to the drugs did not alter the beneficial effects of enriched rearing on maze solving. However, clonidine-exposed (100 micrograms/kg) female rats that were raised in enrichment showed a significantly increased mortality rate. Thus, prenatal exposure to all of these drugs exerted effects which were latent, appearing in adulthood, and which were to some extent precipitated by environmental factors. We conclude that these drugs may be physical and behavioral teratogens for the rat.", 
    "16": "1. The cardiovascular effects of direct microinfusions of clonidine into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in rats of different ages were studied. 2. Clonidine microinfused into the NTS produced a dose-dependent hypotensive and bradycardic response, which was reduced by previous microinfusion of yohimbine but not of propranolol or prazosin. 3. Unilateral microinfusion of clonidine into the NTS produced a significantly smaller hypotensive and bradycardic response in 16 month old rats than in 3 month old rats, whereas in older animals (24 month old) the same doses of clonidine were ineffective. In 16 month old rats, yohimbine given into the NTS produced a smaller pressor and tachycardic response than in 3 month old rats whereas in 24 month old animals yohimbine, at the same doses, was unable to change blood pressure and heart rate. 4. Oral administration of phosphatidylserine (50 mg kg-1 day-1 for 30 consecutive days) enhanced the hypotensive and bradycardic response to clonidine microinfused into the NTS in 16 month old rats. The same schedule of treatment with phosphatidylserine did not affect the cardiovascular response to clonidine in young (3 month old) rats and did not restore responsiveness to clonidine in older rats (24 month old). 5. Methoxamine and phentolamine, given intravenously, produced similar pressor and depressor responses, respectively in 3, 16 and 24 month old rats, suggesting that the decreased sensitivity to clonidine in old rats was not due to peripheral cardiovascular changes. 6. In conclusion, the present results indicate that, during aging, there is a decreased sensitivity of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the brain. Such an alteration can be reversed by chronic treatment with phosphatidylserine during the initial but not the later stages of aging.", 
    "17": "Forty men with chronic stable angina and no prior myocardial infarction were studied. Exercise tolerance testing was carried out off treatment and after beta blockade. beta Blockers were stopped and the patients were randomised to a control group and a study group of patients who undertook a one year high intensity training programme. The groups were then restudied. Submaximum heart rate was reduced by 13 beats per minute by training and by 23 beats per minute by atenolol. Training increased the maximum heart rate by 10 beats per minute and atenolol reduced it by 29 beats per minute. The double produce ST threshold was increased from 183 to 205 by training but reduced to 143 by atenolol. Maximum ST depression was similarly reduced by both training and atenolol. As a result of the effects on maximum heart rate, training produced a greater improvement in exercise tolerance than atenolol with a treadmill time increased from 741 seconds to 1272 seconds with training compared with 974 seconds with atenolol. Other variables were similarly affected. Thus the antianginal efficacy of exercise training is as good as that achieved by beta blockade and represents an alternative to such treatment.", 
    "18": "The adrenergic nervous system is active in kidney function, and the kidney has large numbers of adrenergic receptor subtypes. Because of the cellular complexity of the kidney, it is difficult to obtain direct assessments of adrenergic receptor binding characteristics over specific tissue compartments. Qualitative autoradiography allows the localization of adrenergic receptors over tissue types in the kidney, but quantitative autoradiography allows direct comparison of adrenergic receptor number over different cellular compartments. The purpose of this study was to obtain direct assessments of alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta adrenergic receptor numbers over different tissue compartments of the kidney using quantitative autoradiography. Sections of Sprague-Dawley rat kidney were incubated in several concentrations of 3H-dihydroalprenolol to label beta receptors, 3H-prazosin to label alpha 1 receptors and 3H-rauwolscine to label the alpha 2 receptors. Sections of rat heart incubated in 3H-dihydroalprenolol were included as standards. The sections were then prepared for receptor autoradiography. After processing, the grains were then quantified on an image analysis system, and binding curves constructed from the specific binding. In some animals, the proximal tubules were stained to localize the proximal convoluted tubules. Significant Scatchard analyses were obtained in the glomeruli with dihydroalprenolol (5.18 X 10(9) receptors/mm3) and with rauwolscine (2.48 X 10(9) receptors/mm3). Significant Scatchard analyses were obtained in the cortex with rauwolscine (9.47 X 10(9) receptors/mm3) and with prazosin (3.9 X 10(9)). In addition, specific binding was seen with rauwolscine and prazosin to the kidney arterioles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Continuous intravenous infusions of leukotriene D4 produced a prolonged but variable bronchoconstriction (approximately a 200% increase in lung resistance (RL) and a 50% decrease in dynamic compliance (Cdyn] in anesthetized and paralysed guinea pigs that peaked within 1-1.5 min and was followed by a somewhat smaller secondary plateau response. The overall response was delayed (time to peaks) but not significantly reduced by pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (1 mg/kg), was markedly potentiated by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol (5 micrograms/kg), and was partially and completely blocked by pretreatment with 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively, of the leukotriene D4 receptor antagonist MK-571. MK-571 prevented the response in indomethacin-treated guinea pigs but was considerably more active at preventing and reversing the potentiated responses (lower dose of leukotriene D4) in animals treated with indomethacin and timolol. Additional studies in indomethacin- and timolol-treated animals demonstrated that MK-571 was active with good duration of action by the aerosol route of administration (30 min and 4 h pretreatment). The technique of infusing leukotrienes into untreated, indomethacin-treated, and indomethacin- and timolol-treated guinea pigs is a useful method to study the action and interaction of leukotriene receptor antagonists.", 
    "20": "The pineal gland, angiotensin, and noradrenergic and cholinergic systems are involved in the regulation of tissue indole metabolism. Angiotensin II increased noradrenaline release and the production of hydroxy- and methoxyindoles by pineal slices. Electrical field stimulation (EFS) of pineal slices released angiotensin II and reproduced many of the actions of exogenous angiotensin II on serotonin and melatonin biosynthesis and release. Both sarcosine-isoleucine-angiotensin II ([Sar, Ile]-ANG II) and atropine blocked, and nadolol increased, the effect of EFS and exogenous angiotensin II on serotonin production. Nadolol blocked both the EFS-induced and the angiotensin II-induced production of melatonin. Atropine and [Sar, Ile]-ANG II did not modify melatonin biosynthesis in electrically stimulated slices, but the muscarinic receptor antagonist increased the stimulatory effect of angiotensin II. These data showed that EFS released angiotensin II and noradrenaline from pineal slices and that a close functional connection exists between the peptide and acetylcholine. The stimulation of serotonin biosynthesis and release by these two neurotransmitters was negatively regulated by noradrenaline acting through beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "21": "There are conflicting reports on the propensity of topical beta blockers to produce corneal anaesthesia. We measured corneal sensitivity thresholds quantitatively for 10 minutes following the administration of one drop of topical timolol maleate (0.5%), betaxolol hydrochloride (0.5%), or saline in 30 eyes of 18 normal subjects in a randomised, double-masked study. Most subjects had insignificant changes in corneal sensitivity thresholds. We identified, however, a subgroup of four subjects (five eyes) that had a marked and prolonged increase of corneal sensitivity threshold (corneal anaesthesia) after timolol (three eyes) and betaxolol (two eyes). The group mean age of these 'responders' (49.0 years) was significantly greater (p less than 0.005) than that of the non-responders (35.0). We recommend periodic measurements of corneal sensitivity in older patients receiving topical timolol or betaxolol, especially when given in higher concentrations, to identify responders, who may be at risk of developing keratitis.", 
    "22": "Recent experimental work has suggested that the adrenergic nervous system is important in regulating cerebral blood flow under conditions of hypoxia and systemic arterial hypertension. Although previous investigations have demonstrated the presence of adrenergic neurons adjacent to human cerebral vessels, the nature of adrenergic receptors on human cerebral blood vessels remains poorly defined. The present study was performed to characterize adrenergic reception on membranes prepared from human pia, a rich source of small blood vessels, using radioligand binding techniques. Adrenergic membrane receptors were characterized using the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol for the beta subtypes and [3H]prazosin and [3H]yohimbine for the alpha subtypes. Displaceable binding was demonstrated with each agent. A small series of adrenergic agents competed for the [3H]dihydroalprenolol, [3H]yohimbine, and [3H]praz binding sites in a fashion suggesting the presence of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta 1-, and beta 2-receptors on the vessels within human pia.", 
    "23": "Hepatocytes from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated by the two-stage collagenase perfusion technique; 1 x 10(6) cells/plate were incubated in primary cell culture in Leibovitz's L-15 medium for 24 hr with or without various concentrations (12.5 to 400 mumol/L) of cardioactive cationic amphiphilic compounds such as propranolol, verapamil, sotalol, atenolol and procainamide. Propranolol and verapamil caused a significant release of lactate dehydrogenase (used as cytotoxic index in this study) in the culture media in a concentration-dependent manner, with LC50 values of 220 +/- 10 and 224 +/- 7 mumol/L, respectively. Atenolol, sotalol and procainamide had no effect on lactate dehydrogenase release. Electron microscopy of the hepatocytes showed that subtoxic concentrations of propranolol (12.5 to 125 mumol/L) and verapamil (12.5 to 100 mumol/L) induced multilamellar inclusion bodies after 24 hr of incubation. The two higher concentrations of propranolol (50 and 125 mumol/L) and 100 mumol/L of verapamil produced a significant decrease in the percentage of volume density of the mitochondria as quantitated by morphometrical analysis. An unusual feature of the electron microscopical changes with propranolol and verapamil was the presence of mitochondria within the multilamellar inclusion bodies. When these two drugs were used together or with subtoxic concentrations of amiodarone or desethylamiodarone, release of lactate dehydrogenase was significantly enhanced. No correlation was evident between the cytotoxic response and the volume density of cellular inclusions in hepatocytes treated with different concentrations of propranolol, verapamil, amiodarone or desethylamiodarone. Sotalol, atenolol and procainamide in concentrations up to 400 mumol/L did not produce any ultrastructural changes in hepatocytes after 24 hr of incubation. These results show that (a) cationic amphiphilic structure per se is not the only requirement for induction of multilamellar inclusions, (b) propranolol and verapamil can induce the formation of multilamellar inclusion bodies and cause a concentration-dependent release of lactate dehydrogenase from hepatocytes and (c) combination of different cationic amphiphiles in subtoxic concentrations can enhance cytotoxicity and increase the volume density of multilamellar inclusions.", 
    "24": "Interracial differences in drug responsiveness can be accounted for, at least in part, by differences in drug disposition. To investigate whether reversible interactions with plasma constituents may be a contributing factor in such differences, the binding of a number of model drugs was studied in plasma obtained from healthy Caucasian and Chinese subjects (n = 8 in each group). The unbound fractions of drugs binding to sites I and II on albumin (warfarin, diazepam, and salicylic acid) were similar in the two groups, and there was no difference in the plasma albumin concentration. By contrast, the percentages of unbound diphenhydramine (26.40% +/- 6.46% versus 18.30% +/- 4.31, mean +/- SD) and propranolol (13.81% +/- 1.33% versus 11.68% +/- 2.37) were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher in Chinese subjects compared to Caucasians. A 30% difference was also observed in the nonlinear binding of disopyramide. These basic drugs interact with both alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin, and the lower binding was associated with a lower plasma concentration of the acute-phase reactant in Chinese subjects. Kinetic analysis of the disopyramide binding isotherm was also suggestive of reduced binding capacity with no change in binding affinity. The reason for the racial difference in the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein level is unknown; however, for drugs extensively bound to this glycoprotein the resulting difference in unbound fraction would be expected to have predictable pharmacokinetic consequences that may result in differences in responsiveness. Determination of plasma binding, especially of drugs interacting with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, should therefore be an essential component of comparative studies in subjects of different races.", 
    "25": "The visual and chemical compatibility of esmolol hydrochloride mixed with aminophylline, heparin sodium, bretylium tosylate, or procainamide hydrochloride in 5% dextrose injection was studied. Esmolol hydrochloride 600 mg was injected into polyvinyl chloride bags containing 100 mL of 5% dextrose injection with aminophylline 100 mg, heparin sodium 5000 units, bretylium tosylate 100 mg, or procainamide hydrochloride 400 mg. All admixtures were prepared in triplicate and stored at room temperature under fluorescent light. Esmolol concentrations were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours. Samples were also examined for precipitate formation and pH and color changes by using visual, microscopic, and spectrophotometric methods. No detectable changes in color or pH and no particulate formation were observed in any of the sample bags. Esmolol concentrations varied by less than 5% throughout the 24-hour study period. Esmolol hydrochloride was visually compatible and chemically stable for at least 24 hours when mixed with aminophylline, heparin sodium, bretylium tosylate, or procainamide hydrochloride in polyvinyl chloride bags containing 5% dextrose injection.", 
    "26": "The pharmacokinetics of three beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and of the model drug antipyrine were studied in 3-, 12- and 24-month-old rats. Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein in plasma was slightly increased and the free fraction of propranolol was slightly decreased in the 24-month-old rats. For the four drugs studied, the volume of distribution and the clearance were decreased in the older rats. For propranolol, metoprolol and antipyrine these decreases were already observed in 12-month-old rats, for atenolol only in the 24-month-old rats. There was no change in half-life as a function of age for the three beta blockers; for antipyrine a significant increase in half-life was seen. The decreased volume of distribution suggests a lower tissue binding or a decrease in total body fluid. The change in clearance in function of age can probably be explained for metoprolol and propranolol by a decrease in hepatic blood flow as no change in metabolism or protein binding occurs, for atenolol by a decrease in renal function and for antipyrine by a decrease in metabolism. After p.o. administration of the beta blockers, no significant increase in area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve was observed for propranolol and metoprolol as a function of age, but for atenolol, a significant increase in area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve was seen in the 24-month-old rats, due to a decrease in renal function, as bioavailability of atenolol did not change in function of age.", 
    "27": "Rat fetuses from mothers stressed chronically by immobilization and high intensity illumination beginning on day 14 of gestation have higher than normal levels of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD) activity in Leydig cells on day 17 of gestation and lower than normal levels on days 18 and 19. Plasma testosterone titers in normal and stressed male fetuses closely parallel the activity of 3 beta HSD in fetal Leydig cells. In the present study quantitative cytochemistry was used to determine whether the stress-induced alterations in 3 beta HSD activity could be prevented by treating the mother with naltrexone, an opioid receptor blocker, before each stress session. Naltrexone normalized 3 beta HSD activity on days 18 and 19 of gestation, suggesting that the stress-induced suppression involves the endogenous opioid system. In contrast, naltrexone did not prevent the elevation in enzyme activity seen on day 17 in stressed fetuses. The persistence of a stress-induced surge on day 17, in spite of naltrexone therapy, suggests that some nonopioid mechanism is operational at that time.", 
    "28": "Whole-day automated ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was used to assess the duration of the antihypertensive actions of the beta-blockers atenolol (50 to 100 mg; n = 20) and acebutolol (400 to 800 mg; n = 19) each given once daily at 9 AM. When compared with its pretreatment 24-hour average, atenolol decreased diastolic BP by 10 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and systolic BP by 12 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Acebutolol decreased the 24-hour diastolic BP by 11 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and systolic BP by 13 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). More specifically, a comparison of the two drugs during the final 6 hours (3 AM to 9 AM) of the dosing interval showed that the mean decrease in diastolic BP of 10.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg with acebutolol was greater (p less than 0.05) than the decrease of 6.2 +/- 1.3 mm Hg with atenolol. Moreover, this final 6-hour effect of atenolol was less (p less than 0.01) than that observed during the first 18 hours of the day. The late effects of acebutolol did not change significantly from its early effects. The two agents also differed in their trough (final 2-hour decrease in diastolic BP) and peak (maximum 2-hour decrease in diastolic BP) effects: for atenolol the peak-to-trough difference was 7.8 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), whereas for acebutolol it was 3.8 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (N.S.). This study confirms the efficacy of atenolol and acebutolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "In anesthetized and vagotomized dogs, we investigate the associative effects on blood pressure of norepinephrine (NE) with the three polyamines putrescine (Pt), spermidine (Sd) and spermine (Se). Experimental series were performed under beta adrenergic blockade (propranolol 0.5 mg/Kg, iv.), alpha adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine 15 mg/Kg, iv.), and under calcium antagonistic action (verapamil 0.3 mg/Kg, iv.). The three polyamines induced a potentiation on the hypertensive effect of NE, they change the dose/response curve to the left side in a potency rank of Se greater than Sd greater than Pt. Such potentiation was not different when a beta adrenergic blockade or calcium antagonism was present; however phenoxybenzamine neutralized it. On the other side, polyamines had a hypotensive effect when were administered alone to the animals. Such effect is related to a histamine releasing properties of the polyamines, and was abolished by previous administration of anihistaminic agents chlorpheniramine (5 mg/kg, iv.) and cimetidine (20 mg/Kg, iv.). In conclusion our results indicate that the potentiation of the hypertensive effect of NE by polyamines, could be attained through a mechanism which involves the alpha adrenergic receptors of the vascular smooth muscle but is not related to the calcium channels that show voltage dependence.",

The effect of labetalol over the systolic and diastolic BP was highly significant (p less than 0.01). The effects of nifedipine on systolic and diastolic BP were also significant but effects on diastolic BP was highly significant (p less than 0.01).

The patients were treated twice a day for a period of six months with Betaxolol eye drops, a Beta-1 betablocker product, and cardioselective. Concerning the total population of patients, 35% had a cardiovascular systemic context, 12.1% had a pulmonary systemic context, 5.2% were diabetic patients. Efficacy, systemic tolerance, visual comfort have been evaluated during the study, for each group of patient. After six months of treatment, intra-ocular pressure of the 5,872 patients has been lowered from 22.61 mmHg to 18.25 mmHg. Patients have reported a global efficacy in 97% of cases, a good systemic tolerance in 91% of the cases. The investigations have reported a global efficacy in 96% of cases and a good systemic tolerance in 91%. Ocular comfort has been reported as acceptable by 89% patients and by 92% of the Investigators. The analysis of the results of the study allows us to say that the Beta-blocker-Beta-1 selective eye drop, can be used in treatment of intraocular hypertension or open angle chronic glaucoma with a high range of efficacy and safety.", 
    "32": "Retrovenous (RV) myocardial delivery of blood and drugs into the coronary sinus (CS) through a 3 lumen balloon catheter was evaluated in sheep (no coronary collaterals) for protection from ventricular fibrillation (VF) during coronary artery occlusion. The balloon was asynchronously inflated (CS occlusion) for 5 sec and then deflated for 5 sec with 1 cc/sec of flow. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded with inflation of a percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography balloon and therapy started immediately. In a control group (no therapy, n = 4) all developed VF by 30 min after coronary artery occlusion. The drugs lidocaine (L), esmolol (E), adenosine (A), and deferoxamine (D) were evaluated for effects on eliminating developing VF with intravenous (i.v.) administration compared with RV administration with venous blood (VB) or arterial blood (AB). The percent survival after CA occlusion (no VF) was: L i.v., 0%; L RV with VB, 43%; L RV with AB, 17%; E i.v., 50%; E RV with VB, 70%; A. i.v., 29%; A RV with VB, 88%; D i.v., 17%; and D RV with AB, 80%. There was a trend toward lower myocardial necrosis (seen by tetrazolium stain and/or light microscopy) in the RV survivors (especially with VB) compared with the group i.v. survivors. These data suggest that RV antiarrhythmic drug delivery is a feasible alternative to i.v. administration during CA occlusion.", 
    "33": "Subtotal thyroidectomy was performed for hyperthyroidism on 130 patients; 95 treated before surgery with propranolol (Group I) and 35 given only metoprolol before surgery (Group II). These patient groups were compared with reference to preoperative medication, operative and immediate postoperative course, and late results with follow-up for one to five years. Clinical response was 100% in group II and 94.7% in group I. The median length of preoperative treatment was 7.96 +/- 1.84 days in group I and 6.25 +/- 1.73 days in group II (P less than 0.05). There were no serious adverse effects of the drugs in either treatment group. No anaesthesiologic or cardiovascular complication occurred during operation in either group. Ten patients in group I (10.5%) and six patients in group II (11.4%) observed hyperthyroid manifestations in the immediate postoperative period, eliminated by the administration of the propranolol/metoprolol, and no case of thyroid storm occurred. One patient in group II developed clinical hypocalcaemia. Two patients, one in each group, presented temporary unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. There were two recurrences of toxicity in group I (2.1%) and none in group II. Hypothyroidism occurred in 3 patients (2.3%) two of them were from group I and one was from group II. The postoperative hospital stay was 4.62 +/- 1.61 days in group I and 2.81 +/- 1.32 days in group II (P less than 0.05). One patient from group I died on the third postoperative day due to pulmonary oedema. The results suggest that metoprolol can be safely used and offers the advantages of desired clinical response, shorter preoperative preparation time, simplicity of dosage and shorter postoperative hospital stay in comparison to propranolol for preoperative treatment of hyperthyroidism.", 
    "34": "A bromatometric method was elaborated for the quantitative determination of oxprenolol. 15 to 150 mg of oxprenolol dissolved in 10 cm3 of water is brominated by adding 20.00-40.00 cm3 of 0.02 or 0.1 N potassium bromate solution followed by 0.5-3 g of potassium bromide and 1-10 cm3 of 10% w/w hydrochloric acid. After a reaction time of 15 min. 2-10 cm3 of 10% w/w potassium iodide solution is added followed by 20-40 cm3 of chloroform. The liberated iodine is titrated with standard 0.1 N or 0.01 N sodium thiosulphate solution. A blank titration is also performed and the oxprenolol content is calculated from the difference of the two titrations. Under these conditions one oxprenolol molecule reacts with six bromine atoms.

Preventive injection of lipomodulators--A2 phospholipase inhibitor (mepacrine) or triglycecolipase inhibitor (propranolol)--to animals normalizes the level of lipids in the surfactant and blocks liberation of arachidonate and palmitate from surfactant phospholipids in an anaphylactoid shock.", 
    "37": "The hypothesis that placental secretion of progesterone (P4) and ovine placental lactogen (oPL) are controlled through different mechanisms was tested. Placental tissue was obtained at days 133-138 of pregnancy, and explant incubations were established using 200 mg tissue per flask in 5 ml O2-saturated DMEM containing 24 mM HEPES and lacking phenol red (pH 7.4). Following a 30-min preincubation, and a 15-min control period, test substances were added and incubations continued, with periodic gassing, for 4 h at 37 degrees C in a shaking water bath. Dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine significantly stimulated P4 production (P less than 0.05). The enhancement of placental P4 production was mimicked by the addition of 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and forskolin (P less than 0.05). The response to catecholamines was abolished by the addition of propranolol (P less than 0.05) but not by phentolamine (P greater than 0.05). Inclusion of a membrane-permeant substrate for P4 synthesis, 25-hydroxycholesterol, increased basal (P less than 0.05) but did not enhance agonist-induced P4 production (P greater than 0.05). High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of placental tissue demonstrated the presence of DA (80.8 +/- 7.07 pg/mg) and NE (48.8 +/- 5.77 pg/mg), as well as catecholamine metabolites. Addition of 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DAG) or phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) enhanced oPL secretion (P less than 0.05) without affecting P4 production. The response to DAG and PMA, representing the release of considerably more oPL than can be detected by extracting the tissue, was not influenced by treatment with cycloheximide (P greater than 0.05) indicating that secretion of preformed oPL is regulated by the protein kinase C pathway. These results support the hypothesis that the secretion of oPL and the production of P4 are controlled by different mechanisms.",

It was established that the level of sex hormones tended to diminution by the end of the treatment month 1 or 2, this drop being more noticeable in reserpine administration. Basing on this evidence it would be beneficial for patients suffering from juvenile hypertension in need of chemotherapy to take courses of the above drugs.", 
    "39": "The paper deals with the study into the benefits of prazosin and trasicor used in arterial hypertension. Their effects on the blood lipid composition were evaluated. With prazosin, the steady antihypertensive effect was reached in 81.0%, whereas with trasicor, it was attained in 46%. When prazosin was given, total cholesterol and triglycerides were statistically significantly decreased by 6.8 and 14.8%, respectively, while high density lipoproteins was increased by 9.1%. When trasicor was administered, no changes were observed in the spectrum of serum lipids. Thus, prazosin is effective in correcting two major risk factors for coronary heart disease, namely arterial hypertension and hyperlipoproteinemia, thereby reducing a risk for coronary heart disease.",

Urethane-anaesthetized, age-matched cold-(4 degrees C) and room (21 degrees C)-acclimated groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were given repeated (three) ventromedial hypothalamic electrical stimulations. Interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT), colonic, surface tail temperatures and blood pressure were monitored before and after each electrical stimulation. Propranolol HCl (2.5 mg kg-1 i.v.) was given 10 min prior to the last (third) ventromedial hypothalamic stimulation. 2. Repeated electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) nucleus to either small or large rats (kept at 21 degrees C) caused no significant change in interscapular brown fat, colonic or surface temperatures compared to respective pre-stimulation control values whereas mean arterial pressure was slightly but significantly increased during the 30 s stimulation period. 3. Electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus of small or large rats, kept at 4 degrees C for 3 weeks prior to testing, caused significant (greater than 0.25 and greater than 0.40 degrees C, respectively) rises in interscapular BAT temperature from respective prestimulation control values. Colonic temperatures increased following ventromedial hypothalamic electrical stimulation only in the small, 4 degrees C-acclimated group whereas surface tail temperatures did not significantly change after stimulation of either cold-exposed group. Mean arterial pressures were significantly increased during ventromedial hypothalamic electrical stimulation in both 4 degrees C-acclimated groups, compared to pre-stimulation control levels and, in addition, were above those of age-matched rats kept at 21 degrees C. Intravenous propranolol, which decreased interscapular brown fat and colonic temperatures in all groups, blocked the rise in interscapular brown fat and colonic temperatures of the 4 degrees C-acclimated rats following the last electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. 4. In vitro biochemical analysis of the interscapular brown fat pads of another four groups of age-matched, small and large 21 and 4 degrees C-acclimated rats revealed that the thermogenic capacity of the 4 degrees C-acclimated groups was, in all cases, significantly increased from age-matched groups previously kept at 21 degrees C, as shown by significant increases in brown adipose tissue mass, BAT DNA and protein content, BAT mitochondrial protein and BAT mitochondrial GDP binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Under a single dosage regimen, subjects were administered either a single capsule containing controlled release propranolol equivalent to 160 mg of the drug or 80 mg of conventional propranolol tablet, twelve hourly. Peak plasma propranolol concentrations were low which occurred later after controlled release administration than after the administration of the conventional tablet. Analysis of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for the two formulations indicate no significant difference of bioavailability despite a prolonged absorption time and maintenance of effective plasma concentration for the controlled release preparation.", 
    "42": "The effects of phenobarbital (PB) and dexamethasone (DX) on maternal and fetal hepatic cytochrome P450 content, benzphetamine (BzP) demethylation activity, the plasma concentration of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), and the binding of propranolol (PPL) were examined in guinea pigs. In maternal guinea pigs, PB increased AGP-specific PPL binding by 131%, P450 by 94%, and BzP demethylation by 261%. DX only increased maternal AGP-specific PPL binding (122%). In fetal guinea pigs, neither PB nor DX resulted in significant increase for any of these parameters. The combination of PB and DX synergistically increased fetal P450 content (153% increase) and BzP demethylation (84% increase). In contrast, this combination treatment did not increase maternal P450 and BzP demethylation to a greater extent than by PB treatment alone nor did it increase the binding of PPL in PCA-treated fetal plasma. The synergy of P450 induction found in the fetus implicates glucocorticoids as important regulators of fetal hepatic microsomal enzyme maturation.",

Proxymetacain 0.5% (proparacaine 0.5%, Ursapharm, Saarbr\u00fccken; 10 eyes) served as a positive, NaCl 0.9% as a negative control substance (placebo). Indomethacin 1% (Chibro-Amuno 3, Chibret Pharmazeutische GmbH, Munich; 10 eyes) was tested as a further control substance. The subjects assessed the subjective tolerance of the test substances on a 4-point scale. Levobunolol 0.5% caused a statistically significant reduction in corneal sensitivity, attaining its maximum effect in the first minute after application and lasting on average for 6 minutes. The reduction was greater than that caused by timolol 0.5% and approximately one-half of that caused by betaxolol 0.5%. Proxymetacain 0.5% reduced corneal sensitivity to below the upper limit of the Cochet & Bonnet esthesiometer (200 mg) for up to 10 minutes. After 30 minutes, corneal sensitivity reverted to its initial value in all subjects. NaCl 0.9% eye drops did not decrease corneal sensitivity. After one minute an increase in corneal sensitivity (exercise effect) was observed which was significant as compared to the initial value as of the 15th minute after application. Indomethacin 1% likewise failed to reduce corneal sensitivity. In subjects with normal eyes, levobunolol 0.5% causes only a slight reduction in sensitivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Betaxolol is a lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist relatively selective for beta 1-adrenoceptors with only weak beta 2-blocking activity. Used topically in glaucoma and ocular hypertension, betaxolol 0.5% solution produces a reduction in intraocular pressure of between 13 and 30%, an effect comparable with that of ocular timolol. It may usefully be combined with other types of anti-glaucoma agents. The most notable feature of its adverse effect profile is transient local stinging or irritation, occurring in 25 to 40% of patients. Following ocular administration, betaxolol appears to be largely devoid of adverse bronchopulmonary or cardiac effects, in comparison with nonselective ocular beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, which may be more likely to exert systemic effects. Betaxolol has negligible local anaesthetic activity, so that corneal desensitisation does not occur with its use. Thus, betaxolol is an alternative therapeutic option available to the physician for the management of chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Its apparently lower propensity to affect the cardiopulmonary system represents a significant advantage over other ocular beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "54": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is being increasingly diagnosed as its importance as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease continues to be recognised. Good metabolic control remains a major goal of drug therapy as it decreases the severity and incidence of diabetic complications. Many drugs have been known to interfere with glucose control, either in a beneficial or, more commonly, in a deleterious fashion. Unfortunately in many instances drug-induced effects have not been looked at specifically in NIDDM. Thiazide diuretics have been shown to cause a deterioration in glucose control not only in the general population but especially in patients who have impaired glucose tolerance. While the effect appears less with potassium supplementation and the lower dosage employed nowadays, thiazide diuretics are best avoided in diabetic patients. Loop diuretics have been reported to reduce glucose control to a lesser extent than thiazides. Although indapamide would appear not to interfere with blood sugar control in NIDDM, higher doses that cause potassium loss may cause a deterioration. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists have been reported to cause a rise in blood sugar and glycosylated haemoglobin in NIDDM. The effect may be more marked in patients on oral hypoglycaemic agents as opposed to diet alone and in those on concomitant thiazide diuretics. The greatest effect was seen with propranolol, and the least with cardioselective and the less lipophilic beta-blockers. It is of interest that alpha-blockade with prazosin seems to antagonise beta-adrenoceptor blocker-induced deterioration in glucose control. The calcium antagonists have differing effects which may be structure related. In some, but not all, studies use of the dihydropyridines such as nifedipine has been associated with a deterioration in glucose control in NIDDM. Long term studies are needed to assess definitively their effect on glucose control. Verapamil, on the other hand, has in 1 small study been found to have a beneficial effect on glucose control in NIDDM. Centrally acting alpha-agonists such as the antihypertensive drug clonidine have not been shown to result in a deterioration in glucose control when used in NIDDM, although there are isolated case reports. Long term therapy with the more specific agonist guanfacine was reported in 1 uncontrolled study to have a beneficial effect on glucose tolerance in NIDDM. Uncontrolled studies suggest that phenothiazines may aggravate diabetic control. The significance of a number of recent observations is not fully clear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "55": "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory (cytotoxic) effects on insulin-producing beta cells in isolated pancreatic islets. Since alteration in ion fluxes is crucial for endocrine cell activation and is a denominator of cell death, and since IL-1 was recently shown to increase the total sodium content in a murine pre-B-lymphocyte cell line, we investigated the effect of recombinant human IL-1 beta (rhIL-1 beta) on the cytosolic free sodium concentration (fNa+i) in rat islets. Furthermore, long-term rhIL-1 beta effects on islet cell function were studied during exposure of islets to amiloride, a blocker of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange. One hour of islet exposure to 60 U/ml of rhIL-1 beta caused a threefold increase in fNa+i in islet cells, and this effect was abolished by depletion of extracellular sodium. Blockade of Na+/H+ exchange with amiloride abolished the inhibitory effect of rhIL-1 beta on insulin release. In conclusion, rhIL-1 beta was found to increase sodium influx in pancreatic islet cells. This might underlie the widespread effects of rhIL-1 beta on beta-cell function and morphology, possibly related to IL-1-mediated toxic free radical formation.",

The protocol comprised a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 5-month prospective study carried out in an outpatient general internal medicine clinic in a university medical center. There were 92 patients ages 18 to 70, with mild primary hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mm Hg and less than 105 mm Hg) without significant cardiac, renal, cerebrovascular, hepatic, neoplastic, or hematologic disorders. Patients with severe hyperlipidemia or peripheral vascular disease were also excluded. All factors known to effect serum lipids were held constant throughout the study (i.e., diet, weight, exercise, caffeine, tobacco). Atenolol and clonidine significantly reduced blood pressure when compared with placebo. Atenolol caused significant increases in serum triglycerides and apolipoprotein B (p less than 0.05) and significant reductions in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoproteins A-I and A-II (p less than 0.05). Atenolol also induced a significant adverse effect on all lipid ratios, increasing total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-II ratios and decreasing low density lipoprotein-cholesterol/apolipoprotein-B ratio (p less than 0.05). Clonidine caused significant reductions in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoproteins AI and AII (p less than 0.05 but was neutral on all other lipids, lipid subfractions, and apolipoproteins. Clonidine did not significantly alter any of the lipid ratios.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Dissimilar sensitivity to the stress-effects of various tissues exhibiting distinct levels of the antioxidant protection was found in rats. Stable activity of superoxide dismutase was found in myocardium under usual conditions of stress, while the enzymatic activity was increased during inderal effect as distinct from some other tissues--blood, stomach, liver and spleen tissues.", 
    "64": "This study addresses a number of unresolved issues regarding the employment of respiratory sinus arrhythmia as an index of tonic parasympathetic cardiac control in psychophysiological investigations. These questions include the following: (1) Does respiratory sinus arrhythmia reflect cardiac vagal tone under conditions in which alterations in parasympathetic control are expected to be mild to moderate? (2) Are variations in human respiratory sinus arrhythmia that occur in response to varying behavioral demands independent of beta-adrenergic effects on the heart? (3) To what extent do typical experimental tasks apparently affect tonic cardiac vagal control? Twelve healthy male subjects were administered a joint alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor pharmacological blocker on one day and a placebo on another (balanced across subjects). On both days, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and heart period were monitored during a number of different experimental tasks while subjects continuously paced their respiration. Results indicated that respiratory sinus arrhythmia, under controlled respiratory conditions, is uninfluenced by variations in sympathetic activity, and provides a reasonably sensitive index of cardiac vagal tone, even when alterations in parasympathetic tone are not large. Furthermore, our findings suggest that cardiac vagal tone is responsive to varying behavioral demands and may interact in different ways with beta-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "65": "In previous studies, we established a strong concordance between nocturnal oscillations in plasma renin activity (PRA) and REM-NREM sleep cycles. To determine whether this relation persists in the case of moderate essential hypertension and if it is influenced by antihypertensive therapies affecting renin release, six normal subjects and six hypertensive patients were studied. The normal subjects underwent one control night. The hypertensive patients were studied during a first night when a placebo was given. Four of them underwent a second night following a single dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril; and a third night, 45 days later, with the antihypertensive treatment. In addition, two of the patients underwent two night-studies, after a single and repeated doses of a beta-blocker, atenolol, to see whether preventing renin release modified the sleep structure. The relationship between the nocturnal PRA oscillations and the sleep stage patterns persisted in hypertensive patients receiving placebo. In patients who had low PRA levels, the increases associated with NREM sleep were small. However, the mean relative amplitude of the oscillations, expressed as a percentage of the nocturnal mean, was about 60%, which was similar to that in normotensive subjects. Active renin and PRA oscillations were closely coupled. ACE activity profiles displayed damped fluctuations and no systematic relationship with sleep stages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Griseolic acid-ester (GA-ester), one of the strongest cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors, was combined with isoproterenol and timolol in this study to evaluate the effect on intraocular pressure (IOP). Furthermore, the ocular hypotensive effect of GA-ester in pigmented and albino rabbits was compared, and the binding ability of GA-ester to synthetic melanin was examined. GA-ester markedly enhanced the hypotensive effect of isoproterenol, and the combination of GA-ester with timolol resulted in an additional fall in IOP. No differences in the hypotensive effect of GA-ester between pigmented and albino rabbits were observed. GA-ester did not bind to synthetic melanin. GA-ester has unique characteristics as an ocular hypotensive agent.", 
    "67": "In the rat anterior hypothalamic-preoptic region adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate concentration changes during the ultradian wake-sleep cycle. The administration of DL-propranolol and the exposure to low ambient temperature decreased the nucleotide concentration and also modified the wake-sleep cycle. This suggests that in this region a biochemical correlation exists with different functional states.", 
    "68": "Increasing evidence suggests that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a 28 amino acid peptide with biologically active 4-28 and 5-28 congeners, modulates salt-water homeostasis at both peripheral and central levels. In rats, immunoreactive (ir) ANP is found in hypothalamic (HT) neurons of preoptic and paraventricular regions rich in aminergic innervation. Employing a well-characterized perifusion model of rat HT explants, the acute effects of norepinephrine (NE) on HT release of irANP were examined. Pulsatile administration (20 min) of NE (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) induced a dose-related release of irANP. The stimulatory effect of 10(-5) M NE (2.66 +/- 0.54 pg/ml/HT, means +/- SE, n = 12) was abolished in the presence of 10(-7) M propranolol, a beta-antagonist, but was 50% higher when administrated with 10(-5) M phentolamine, an alpha-antagonist. Administration of equivalent doses of propranolol or phentolamine alone, consistently suppressed (40% below basal secretion rate, BSR) or stimulated (50% above BSR) irANP release, respectively. In addition, infusion of isoprenaline (10(-5) M), a beta-agonist, enhanced BSR by 45%, whilst phenylephrine (10(-5) M), an alpha-agonist, suppressed it by 25%. We conclude that in rat hypothalami (1) occupancy of the beta-adrenoceptor by its agonist stimulates irANP release, (2) alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors modulate irANP secretion in an opposing manner, and (3) the basal release of irANP is a product of the activation of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors by their endogenous ligands.", 
    "69": "The relative roles of dopaminergic and beta-adrenergic receptors in mediating the stress-induced increase in the secretion of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) from the intermediate lobe of the pituitary were determined in the male rat. Thirty minutes of physical immobilization (restraint stress) increased the circulating concentrations of alpha-MSH and decreased the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/dopamine (DOPAC/DA) ratio in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary, reflecting a decrease in the tuberohypophysial dopaminergic neuronal activity. Pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol reduced the stress-induced increase in the circulating levels of alpha-MSH, but had no effect on the basal plasma concentrations of this hormone or the stress-induced decrease in DOPAC/DA in the intermediate lobe. If the dopaminergic tone during stress was maintained by administration of the DA agonist apomorphine, the stress-induced increase in alpha-MSH secretion was prevented. In nonstressed animals the administration of the beta 2-adrenergic agonist metaproterenol increased the plasma levels of alpha-MSH, and the effect of this drug was augmented if the inhibitory dopaminergic tone on alpha-MSH secretion was blocked by the administration of the DA antagonist haloperidol. Severing neurons in the retrochiasmatic region of the hypothalamus blocked the stress-induced decrease in DOPAC/DA in the intermediate lobe and attenuated the stress-induced increase in plasma concentrations of alpha-MSH. Taken together, these results indicate that a decrease in tuberohypophysial dopaminergic neuronal inhibitory tone and an increase in beta-adrenergic stimulation are both necessary for the full expression of the stress-induced increase in secretion of alpha-MSH from melanotrophs in the intermediate lobe of the rat pituitary.", 
    "70": "The effects of extraneuronal accumulation of isoprenaline on the level of cAMP in perfused rat hearts were investigated. When catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) was intact, perfusion with isoprenaline (10(-6) M) for 5 min and 30 min (low accumulation of isoprenaline in the heart) enhanced the cAMP level. Propranolol (10(-6) M) significantly decreased the high level of cAMP produced by the perfusion with isoprenaline for 5 min and 30 min (low accumulation of isoprenaline). When COMT was inhibited by tropolone, perfusion with isoprenaline (10(-6) M) for 5 min (slight accumulation of isoprenaline in the heart) slightly increased the level of cAMP, while perfusion for 30 min (high accumulation of isoprenaline in the heart) did not increase the level of cAMP. Propranolol (10(-6) M) significantly decreased the cAMP level produced by 5 min perfusion with isoprenaline, but did not change the level by 30 min perfusion. The perfusion length (5 min and 30 min) and COMT inhibition by tropolone (10(-4) M) in the absence of isoprenaline did not affect cAMP levels. These results suggest that extraneuronally accumulated isoprenaline may inhibit the adenylate cyclase in perfused rat hearts.", 
    "71": "To study the effect of aging on the beta-adrenergic receptor potency of isoprenaline, tracheas from 3-, 6-, 10-, 40- and 100-week-old guinea pigs were used as test tissues. The pD2 values (potency) of isoprenaline increased with age in tracheas treated with corticosterone, but decreased in untreated tracheas. The pA2 value of propranolol against isoprenaline estimated in the treated tracheas did not change with age. Specific binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol to the microsomal fractions from the tracheal muscles from 6-, 10- and 40-week-old guinea pigs was analyzed with Scatchard plots. The capacity of maximum binding sites of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol increased with increasing age, while its dissociation constant did not change. Age-related increase in the potency of isoprenaline in the tracheas treated with corticosterone is considered to be due to the increase in the total amount (density) of beta-adrenoceptors. However, the potency of the drug in untreated tracheas decreased with age. These results suggest that extraneuronal uptake plays an important role in the beta-adrenergic action of isoprenaline in older (40 and 100 weeks) guinea pigs.", 
    "72": "Because ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity of rat glomerular mesangial cells has been shown to increase upon interaction with macrophages in vitro, it was examined whether interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), two macrophage-released cytokines, were responsible for this effect. IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha stimulated mesangial cell 5'-nucleotidase activity in a dose-dependent manner after treatment for 24 hr. Maximum increases reached 4.5 times and 1.7 times basal values for IL-1 beta (20 U/ml) and TNF-alpha (25 ng/ml), respectively. The effects of both cytokines were additive. Stimulation of 5'-nucleotidase by IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha was specific since the activity of other ectoenzymes, such as Mg2(+)-ATPase, was unchanged. Cycloheximide, a blocker of protein synthesis, suppressed the cytokine-dependent increase of 5'-nucleotidase activity. Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as indomethacin and ibuprofen inhibited approximately 50% of the effects of both cytokines. Their inhibitory effect was abolished in the presence of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In addition, PGE2 itself produced a dose-related (0.1-10 microM) increase of 5'-nucleotidase activity with a maximum of 2.2 times basal value. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-1 beta, essentially, and TNF-alpha, to a lesser extent, regulate 5'-nucleotidase expression in the plasma membrane of cultured mesangial cells and that their effect depends in part on PGE2 synthesis. Therefore, macrophages, via their products of secretion acting on 5'-nucleotidase, could modulate adenosine production in the glomerular capillaries.", 
    "73": "Our previous work has demonstrated that presentations of mild foot-shock to Lewis rats induces a suppression of splenic and peripheral blood lymphocyte responses to nonspecific T-cell mitogens. The present study demonstrated that adrenalectomy prevented the shock-induced suppression of the mitogenic response of peripheral blood T-cells but did not attenuate the suppression of splenic T-cells. Conversely, the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, propranolol and nadolol, attenuated the shock-induced suppression of splenic T-cells in a dose-dependent manner but did not attenuate suppression of the blood mitogen response. These data indicate that distinct mechanisms mediate the shock-induced suppression of T-cell responsiveness to mitogens in the spleen and the peripheral blood. The results indicate that the peripheral release of catecholamines is responsible for splenic immune suppression and that adrenal hormones, which do not interact with beta-adrenergic receptors, are responsible for shock-induced suppression of blood mitogenic responses.", 
    "74": "Endogenous peroxidase activity was observed in the cisternae of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (r-ER), including the nuclear envelope, Golgi complex, and secretory granules of the cat's nasal glands. A single injection of propranolol resulted in a decrease of peroxidase-positive secretory granules, an increase of electron-lucent granules, and no change in the level of peroxidase activity in the r-ER and Golgi complex at either 5 or 9 hours after the injection. Continuous administration of propranolol over 7 hours led to the disappearance of peroxidase activity from the r-ER and secretory granules. These data would indicate that propranolol inhibits only the synthesis of peroxidase. Twenty minutes after a single injection of isoproterenol, the rate at which the granule content containing the peroxidase reaction product was discharged into the acinar lumen increased sharply. However, 60 minutes after the injection, the secretion rate of peroxidase-positive granules decreased. The same experiment then was repeated, but this time before the isoproterenol was injected, propranolol was administered to the cats. This time no change in peroxidase activity appeared in the acinar cells. It was concluded, therefore, that the stimulation of beta-receptors enhances the synthesis of peroxidase.", 
    "75": "Low levels of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (DHE) (alpha adrenergic receptor) binding to peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes from asthmatic subjects were significantly increased following incubation with histamine. In contrast, [3H]-DHE binding was undetectable both before and after histamine incubation using cells from nonasthmatic subjects. The change in binding showed a biphasic dose dependence on histamine and was not associated with changes in DHA (beta-2 receptor) or yohimbine (alpha-2 receptor) binding. The induction of alpha adrenergic receptors by the ubiquitous inflammatory mediator histamine may help explain the alpha adrenergic hyperresponsiveness seen in asthmatic patients.", 
    "76": "Autoradiography has been used to visualize independently the subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat somatosensory cortex. Beta 2-Adrenergic receptors, but not beta 1-adrenergic receptors colocalize with \"whisker barrels\" in this tissue. Thus, each whisker sends a specific multisynaptic pathway to the somatosensory cortex that can be histochemically visualized and only one subtype of beta-adrenergic receptor is specifically associated with this cortical representation. Additionally, neonatal lesion of any or all of the whisker follicles results in loss of the corresponding barrel(s) as shown by histochemical markers. This loss is paralleled by a similar loss in the organization of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the somatosensory cortex. Other results indicate that these beta 2-adrenergic receptors are not involved in moment-to-moment signal transmission in this pathway and, additionally, are not involved in a gross way in the development of whisker-barrel array.", 
    "77": "The effects of catecholamines on lipolysis in situ were investigated in humans. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was microdialyzed with solvents containing adrenergic agents. Norepinephrine caused a rapid increase in the glycerol level in adipose tissue (lipolysis index) that was further increased by the alpha adrenoreceptor blocker phentolamine. At 10(-11) mol/l of norepinephrine caused a 100% stimulation of lipolysis (P less than .025). In the presence of phentolamine the lipolytic effects of catecholamines at 10(-12) mol/l was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. All these three lipolytic catecholamines caused a transient increase in the adipose tissue dialysate glycerol level, which peaked after 20 to 30 min of catecholamine exposure and then declined. The apparent tachyphylaxia could not be overcome by a gradual increase of the catecholamine concentration from 10(-12) to 10(-8) mol/l. However, the selective alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine caused a continuous and dose-dependent decrease in the dialysate glycerol level; the minimum effective concentration was 10(-9) mol/l. In conclusion, catecholamines have a lipolytic effect in situ at much lower concentrations than those in the circulation. This effect is transient and is related to beta adrenoreceptors. In additio, catecholamines have alpha adrenoreceptor-mediated effects on lipolysis in situ.", 
    "78": "Catecholamine-induced desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors resulting in hyporesponsiveness to further stimulation has been frequently reported after an increase in endogenous catecholamines. To examine the possibility of beta-adrenoceptor desensitization due to intraoperative adrenergic activation (surgical stress), the alterations of human lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor density and affinity observed after anesthesia and surgery were studied using (-)125I-iodocyanopindolol binding in 19 patients undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures with general anesthesia (thiopental, fentanyl, and halothane or isoflurane). In 13 patients, repeated determinations of plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine showed an increase during the surgical procedure (norepinephrine +60%; epinephrine +60%); this change was not observed in the remaining patients. A significant postoperative increase in receptor density (Bmax +25%) and a significant decrease of receptor affinity for isoproterenol (IC50 +22%) were found in the patients who experienced intraoperative adrenergic activation. By contrast, no significant change in beta-receptor density or affinity was found in the patients who had normal intraoperative adrenergic activation. In addition, heart rate responses to the postoperative changes in plasma catecholamines (an index of cardiac sensitivity to agonist) were significantly attenuated in patients who experienced both intraoperative adrenergic activation and a decrease in affinity of beta-receptor for agonist, suggesting hyporesponsiveness to beta stimulation. We conclude that beta-adrenergic receptors and, consequently, beta-adrenergic responsiveness might be altered by perioperative adrenergic activation in surgical patients.", 
    "79": "Administration of nerve growth factor (NGF) twice daily for 2 days to rats 11 days at the time of the initial injection resulted in a 6.6-fold increase in [3H]thymidine levels of pancreas, when comparison was made to levels of untreated controls. Isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-adrenergic agonist known to produce marked increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of salivary glands, caused increases in levels of [3H]thymidine in pancreas that were similar in magnitude to those induced by NGF. The combined administration of ISO and NGF did not cause any increase above those observed with either agent alone. Administration of propranolol (3 mg/kg body wt) prior to administration of ISO prevented the usual ISO-induced increase in DNA synthesis, but propranolol in either a 3- or 9-mg/kg body wt dose, caused only a 50% inhibition of NGF-induced thymidine incorporation. In the absence of the submandibular-sublingual glands, the ISO failed to induce the usual high levels of thymidine incorporation, whereas NGF induced the same high levels observed in rats with submandibular glands intact. NGF did not alter the distribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the pancreas but did increase norepinephrine when the initial administration was at age 5 days, but not when it was given at age 10 days. Since NGF increased DNA synthesis in the absence of submandibular-sublingual glands, whereas ISO did not, this suggests that ISO requires NGF to induce beta 1-activation and subsequent synthesis and that NGF is a direct activator.", 
    "80": "In order to generate information about the relative effectiveness of the most widely used pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for the prophylaxis of recurrent migraine (i.e., propranolol HCl and combined relaxation/thermal biofeedback training), meta-analysis was used to integrate results from 25 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of propranolol and 35 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of relaxation/biofeedback training (2445 patients, collectively). Meta-analysis revealed substantial, but very similar improvements have been obtained with propranolol and with relaxation/biofeedback training. When daily recordings have been used to assess treatment outcome, both propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback have yielded a 43% reduction in migraine headache activity in the average patient. When improvements have been assessed using other outcome measures (e.g., physician/therapist ratings), improvements observed with each treatment have been about 20% greater. In both cases, improvements observed with propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback have been significantly larger than improvement observed with placebo medication (14% reduction) or in untreated patients (no reduction). Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial empirical support for the effectiveness of both propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback training, but revealed no support for the contention that the two treatments differ in effectiveness. These results suggest that greater attention should be paid to determining the relative costs and benefits of widely used pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments.", 
    "81": "A simple high performance liquid chromatographic method has been devised for the measurement of bisoprolol in plasma or serum. The sample (200 microL) is vortex mixed for 30 s with 2 M Tris solution (50 microL), aqueous internal standard (benzimidazole, 2.0 mg/L, 50 microL) and methyl t-butyl ether (200 microL). After centrifugation (9950 x g, 2 min), a portion of the resulting extract is analysed on a microparticulate (5 microns) silica column using 1 mM camphorsulphonic acid in methanol as the mobile phase. Detection is by fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 215 nM. The lower limit of accurate measurement for the assay is 10 micrograms/L (CV% = 8.9, n = 9) with a lower limit of detection of 5 micrograms/L. There is minimal interference from either commonly prescribed drugs or endogenous compounds.", 
    "82": "A case of bisoprolol self-poisoning resulting in full recovery of the patient is described. The peak plasma level of bisoprolol was 541 ng ml-1. Sinus bradycardia was the only symptom observed, suggesting that cardioselectivity and absence of membrane stabilizing activity contribute to reduce the severity of beta-blocker intoxication.", 
    "83": "Does the stimulatory effect of circulating catecholamines counteract the inhibitory effect of acidosis on skeletal muscle metabolism? To investigate this possibility, we studied gastrocnemii in dogs breathing either air (n = 10) or 4% carbon dioxide in air (n = 10) at rest and during contractions. In five dogs from each group, we infused propranolol into the arterial supply of the right and left muscles for 40 min. After 30 min of infusion, the left muscle was stimulated at 3 Hz for 10 min. During the 10th min of contractions, we removed and froze both muscles in liquid nitrogen. Oxygen uptake and blood flow to the left muscle prior to or during stimulation was not affected by acidosis either with or without propranolol. Glycogen concentration in resting muscle was unaffected by acidosis with or without propranolol. There was an acidosis related decrease of approximately 50% in the glycolytic intermediates (glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, alpha-glycerol phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate) in unstimulated muscles without beta-blockade. At rest, acidosis decreased muscle lactate by 50% with and 64% without propranolol, but lactate release was decreased only with acidosis without propranolol (1.4-0.1 mumols/kg.s). Acidosis without propranolol had no effect on the changes in glycogen concentration or the change in the concentration of glycolytic intermediates resulting from contractions. In beta-blocked muscle, the difference between stimulated and unstimulated concentrations of glycogen and glycolytic intermediates including lactate was 20-50% smaller with acidosis. Thus, with beta-blockade, the acidotic effects at rest disappeared and an inhibition of the metabolic adjustment to contractions appeared, indicating that circulating catecholamines do modify some metabolic effects of acidosis.", 
    "84": "Fifty patients with essential hypertension grade I/II. (WHO) were treated with Nisoldipine (BAY K 5552) or Propranolol for 12 weeks in a single blind, randomised trial. Both drugs similarly reduced mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Side effects were rare and usually mild. We conclude that Nisoldipine is safe and effective in the treatment of mild essential hypertension.", 
    "85": "Clinically, bupivacaine has depressant effects on intraventricular conduction that may lead to serious atrioventricular blocks or reentrant arrhythmias at plasma levels below those required to produce these effects experimentally (2-3 micrograms/ml instead of 8-10 micrograms/ml). The difference could be due to drugs present in the blood at the time of regional anesthesia that similarly inhibit conduction. This hypothesis was examined in 30 anesthesized, closed-chest dogs by measuring conduction time in the ventricular contractile fibers as well as effective refractory period under pacing at a constant, relatively high (180 beats/minute) rate. Changes in sinus rate were limited, as well as changes in ventricular effective refractory period and blood pressure regardless of the drug tested. In contrast, cibenzoline, disopyramide, and propranolol increased conduction time and lengthened QRS duration. Clomipramine appeared to prolong conduction time and widen QRS only moderately in therapeutic doses, whereas verapamil did not manifest noticeable effects on conduction. Caution is therefore recommended in regional anesthesia with bupivacaine in subjects being treated with cardiovascular drugs, such as cibenzoline, disopyramide, and propranolol and their congeners, or even by tricyclic antidepressants.", 
    "86": "The phenomenon of rhythmic fluctuations in cardiovascular variables such as heart rate (HR) or arterial blood pressure (BP) has attracted the attention of workers in both pure and applied research. In recent years, the possibility of quantifying these oscillations by using power spectral analysis has aroused a growing interest. We investigated the fluctuations which underly the spontaneous variability of BP and HR in conscious rats. Intrafemoral pulsatile BP was computed to generate evenly spaced signals (systolic, diastolic, mean BP, HR) at 200 ms intervals. This equidistant sampling allowed a direct spectral analysis using a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and HR exhibited low frequency oscillations (Mayer waves, 20-605 mHz) and a high frequency oscillation related to respiration (1,855 mHz). The respiratory fluctuations in HR were almost abolished by vagal blockade (atropine). HR fluctuations in the low frequency regime were diminished by vagal blockade or cardiac sympathetic blockade (atenolol). The respiratory frequency fluctuations in SBP were markedly increased by alpha sympathetic blockade (prazosin). On the contrary the low frequency oscillations in SBP were reduced by alpha sympathetic blockade. These data indicate that in conscious rats: 1) the HR oscillation with respiration is vagally mediated, 2) the HR fluctuation in the low frequency regime is jointly mediated by beta sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, 3) the respiratory oscillation in SBP depends on fluctuations in cardiac output and is normally counteracted by the sympathetic tone, 4) the low frequency oscillations in SBP reflect the sympathetic activity to the resistance vessels.", 
    "87": "Bupropion is a novel antidepressant, distinct from tricyclic antidepressants both neurochemically and behaviorally. Bupropion forms several metabolites in both rodents and humans. Three chemically different molecules - BW 306, BW 494, and BW 287 - were selected. Comparative assessment of antidepressant activity of bupropion and its metabolites in mice, and pharmacological analysis of possible mechanisms of action of the parent drug and its metabolites (using interaction studies with pimozide, D,L-propranolol, and prazosin) were carried out. The results obtained show that: bupropion has a pharmacological spectrum in various animal models which predicts both antidepressant and stimulatory activity in man. BW 306 is the most active of the metabolites studied and, compared to bupropion, seems more \"antidepressant\" and less stimulant. BW 494, compared to bupropion or BW 306, has a lower degree of activity in various tests used to evaluate antidepressants. BW 287 has no effect in any of the tests used in this study. The interaction studies with pimozide, D,L-propranolol, and prazosin in the various tests have shown that: the stimulatory effect of bupropion, BW 306, and BW 494 is antagonized by both pimozide and prazosin. in the behavioral despair test, the reduction in the duration of immobility by bupropion and BW 494 is antagonized by pimozide, but not by prazosin or D,L-propranolol. the antagonism of reserpine-induced hypothermia by bupropion and BW 306 is significantly decreased by prazosin and D,L-propranolol, but not by pimozide. These data suggest that the clinical antidepressant profile (without a major stimulatory effect) observed in man after administration of bupropion is related to metabolite BW 306 and possibly to BW 494, rather than to bupropion itself.", 
    "88": "Adult rats were partially depancreatized, and approximately 500 islets were isolated from each excised pancreas, maintained in tissue culture for 7 days, and subsequently transplanted back to the same animals beneath the renal capsule. Four weeks after transplantation the animals were anesthetized and given an intravenous injection of 1 ml of either saline, 30% (wt/vol) D-glucose, 30% (wt/vol) D-galactose, DL-propranolol (15 mg/kg body wt) dissolved in saline, or terbutaline (1 mg/kg body wt) dissolved in saline. Five minutes later blood perfusion of the islet grafts and the pancreatic remnant were measured with a microsphere technique. Islet blood flow was also measured in animals with pancreas intact and no islet grafts after administration of saline, glucose, or galactose. These animals demonstrated a significant and preferential increase in islet blood flow after glucose administration, whereas galactose caused a selective decrease in islet blood perfusion. Both whole pancreatic blood flow and islet blood flow in the pancreatic remnant were decreased by terbutaline administration, whereas the other substances had no effect. Blood flow to the transplanted islets was decreased by glucose and galactose, whereas propranolol and terbutaline had no effect compared with the saline-injected animals. These results suggest that blood flow regulation differs between transplanted pancreatic islets, islets in the normal pancreas, and islets in the pancreatic remnant after partial pancreatectomy. Whether this reflects lack of innervation or an altered reactivity of the newly formed blood vessels in islet grafts is presently unknown.", 
    "89": "Two children with exercise-induced tachycardia, one with idiopathic long-QT syndrome, are presented. The patients were evaluated by exercise testing and electrophysiologic study. From the onset of treatment with the beta-blocking agent, pindolol, the patients have been symptom-free. These findings emphasize that children with syncope must be evaluated by ECG, exercise testing, 24-h Holter-monitoring, and finally, electrophysiological study.", 
    "90": "A 90-day Timorom treatment of rats of both sexes modified some of the carbohydrate metabolism parameters. Some of the modifications were different in male and female rats. Glycogen storage was increased, while liver GPa activity was decreased in the male rats, but those modifications ran in the opposite direction in the female rats. In our opinion, these different reactions of male and female rats to Timorom (containing a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent--timolol) depended on the different ways by which the glycogen phosphorylase system is activated. Many of the biochemical modifications, obtained after the Timorom treatment, disappeared at the end of the first post-treatment month.", 
    "91": "beta-blockers, mainly propranolol, have dramatically modified the treatment of portal hypertension. It has been demonstrated that it was possible to decrease portal pressure over a long period and to modify the natural history of gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhosis. The prevention of first bleeding, or primary prophylaxis, should be distinguished from prevention of rebleeding, or secondary prevention, as these two situations pertain to different events. Concerning primary prophylaxis, at least five randomized controlled trials, (RCT), comparing beta-blockers and placebo, have been published. All the results are homogenous and their meta-analysis suggests that the incidence of first bleeding is significantly decreased but not that of death rate. Results of studies comparing propranolol and sclerotherapy are also available but we know that the results of more than 15 RCT testing sclerotherapy are debated. In secondary prevention, there are more than 10 RCT comparing beta-blockers versus placebo. Results of these RCT are heterogeneous. Meta-analysis suggests that the incidence of rebleeding is significantly decreased but not that of death rate. The results of 5 RCT comparing propranolol versus sclerotherapy are available. Whatever the trial, there was no significant differences between these two treatments. However, meta-analysis suggests that the bleeding incidence is decreased by sclerotherapy but this does not reach statistical significance. Finally, there are RCT with combined treatments: it seems that sclerotherapy plus propranolol is superior to sclerotherapy alone; however this result should be confirmed. In conclusion beta-blockers seem to bring about real changes in the prevention of digestive bleeding in cirrhosis. Their contribution is particularly appreciable in primary prevention of cirrhotic patients with large oesophageal varices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "92": "The aim of the present experiments was to investigate whether 8-OH-DPAT, a selective 5-HT1A agonist, could induce vasoconstriction in vivo and, if so, the type of receptors functionally involved. Dose-response curves to bolus intravenous doses of 8-OH-DPAT were established in anesthetized spinally pithed rats. The peak increase in the mean arterial pressure-log dose (microgram/kg) relationship was fitted to a sigmoidal logistic equation. In the control group, the dose-response curve was steep. The half maximal dose was 743 micrograms/kg. The maximal response was 43 mmHg. Ketanserin, a potent 5-HT2 and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist (0.25 mg/kg), essentially abolished the effect of 8-OH-DPAT (maximal rise = 6 mmHg). Ritanserin (0.25 mg/kg) and LY 53857 (100 micrograms/kg), which have relatively weak affinity for alpha 1-adrenoceptors, also markedly reduced the pressor action of 8-OH-DPAT (maximal rise 17 and 9 mmHg). Prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, slightly reduced the maximal response to 8-OH-DPAT (22% reduction). Adrenalectomy did not affect the pressor response (42 mmHg). This excluded a contribution of an acute release of adrenaline in the blood pressure elevation. (-)Propranolol (5 mg/kg), a beta-blocker with a 5-HT1A antagonistic action, affected the 8-OH-DPAT-induced blood pressure elevation (37% reduction). However, two other beta-blockers with a similar 5-HT1A antagonistic property, (-)pindolol (5 mg/kg) and (+/-)cyanopindolol (10 mg/kg), did not (maximal rise 44 and 39 mmHg). Finally, 8-OH-DPAT dose-dependently increased local vascular resistances, with a regional profile similar to that of 5-HT, with the hindquarter being the most sensitive vascular bed. Ketanserin also prevented the vascular effects of 8-OH-DPAT. Our pharmacological analyses of the vascular action of 8-OH-DPAT in the spinally pithed rat indicated that this drug caused dose-related increases in blood pressure. This effect depended on a rise in peripheral vascular resistance, particularly in the hindquarter and kidney beds. Our data suggest that the 5-HT1A agonistic property of 8-OH-DPAT cannot account for this pressor effect which seems to depend on the activation of the vascular 5-HT2 receptor."
