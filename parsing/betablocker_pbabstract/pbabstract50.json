    "1": "Rats were administered AGE at two different doses of 2 ml/kg or 5 ml/kg orally whereas SAC was administered either at a dose 13.1 mg/kg or 32.76 mg/kg. The AGE or SAC was given alone or in combination with atenolol (6 mg/kg, p.o), every alternate day for three weeks. At the end of treatment, two doses of isoproterenol (150 mg/kg, s.c) were administered to rats. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded followed by withdrawal of blood to estimate serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB) activities. The activities of LDH, CK-MB as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were also determined in the heart tissue homogenate (HTH).", 
    "2": "The isoproterenol induced ECG changes were restored to normal in all treated groups. The AGE and SAC administration caused a decrease in serum LDH and CK-MB activities and an elevation of LDH and CK-MB activities in HTH.

    "4": "Medicinal antiarrhythmic therapy is either used in the acute setting to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm or as chronic medication to preserve sinus rhythm if a rhythm control strategy is followed. The choice of the antiarrhythmic agent is based on the presence or absence of structural heart disease. In addition, oral anticoagulation should be established according to current guidelines. In the acute setting the armamentarium comprises flecainide, propafenone, vernakalant and amiodarone. Usually, combination therapy with an atrioventricular (AV) node slowing drug (a beta blocker or verapamil) is used. For chronic rhythm control a class IC drug, such as sotalol, dronedarone and amiodarone is given depending on the comorbidities. In the absence of structural heart disease, rare episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be treated by a pill-in-the-pocket strategy, i.e. self-administered pharmacological cardioversion with flecainide or propafenone. Despite recent advances in catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, medical rhythm control continues to play an important role due to its ubiquitous availability and relatively easy use. The risk for proarrhythmia has to be evaluated in all patients.", 
    "5": "Melt electrospinning (MES) was used to prepare fast dissolving fibrous drug delivery systems in the presence of plasticizers. This new method was found promising in the field of pharmaceutical formulation because it combines the advantages of melt extrusion and solvent-based electrospinning. Lowering of the process temperature was performed using plasticizers in order to avoid undesired thermal degradation. Carvedilol (CAR), a poorly water-soluble and thermal-sensitive model drug, was introduced into an amorphous methacrylate terpolymer matrix, Eudragit\u00ae E, suitable for fiber formation. Three plasticizers (triacetin, Tween\u00ae 80, and polyethylene glycol 1500) were tested, all of which lowered the process temperature effectively. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and Raman microspectrometry investigations showed that crystalline CAR turned into an amorphous form during processing and preserved it for longer time. In vitro dissolution studies revealed ultrafast drug dissolution of the fibrous samples. According to the HPLC impurity tests, the reduced stability of CAR under conditions applied without plasticizer could be avoided using plasticizers, whereas storage tests also indicated the importance of optimizing the process parameters during MES.",

Furthermore, arotinolol-induced relaxations were attenuated by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, Kv channels blocker). Arotinolol produced more nitric oxide compared to metoprolol and increased the expression of p-eNOS in HAECs. These results indicated that arotinolol-induced vasodilation involves endothelium-derived NO and Kv channels. The treatement with arotinolol in 8 weeks, but not metoprolol, markedly decreased CAP and PWV. Biochemistry assay and immunohistochemistry showed that aortic collagen depositions in the arotinolol groups were reduced compared with SHRs with metoprolol.

    "33": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common form of persistent arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation frequently causes rapid ventricular response with severe clinical symptoms requiring acute control of the ventricular rate. This leads to hemodynamic stabilization and improvement of symptoms. The long-term treatment target is to minimize patient symptoms and prevention of complications. As a rhythm control strategy does not provide a survival benefit compared to a rate control strategy, decisions on the best long-term treatment have to be individualized. Important factors affecting this decision are age of the patient, chances to re-establish and maintain sinus rhythm, tolerance of antiarrhythmic medication and accompanying diseases of the heart. For younger patients a rhythm control strategy will usually be the preferred option. For rate control beta blockers are considered first line therapy, alternative drugs include calcium antagonists and digoxin. Occasionally, amiodarone may also be used for rate control. If pharmacological rate management fails ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) node may be an option to control the ventricular rate.", 
    "34": "\u03b23-Adrenergic receptor (\u03b23-AR) is expressed in human atrial and ventricular tissues. Recently, we have demonstrated that it was involved in the activation of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) in human atrial myocytes and the force of contraction of human atrial trabeculae. In the present study, we examined the effect of \u03b23-AR agonist CGP12177 which also is a \u03b21-AR/\u03b22-AR antagonist on I(Ca,L) in human ventricular myocytes (HVMs) and the force of contraction of human ventricular trabeculae. CGP12177 stimulated I(Ca,L) in HVMs with high potency but much lower efficacy than isoprenaline. The \u03b23-AR antagonist L-748,337 inhibited the effect of CGP12177. CGP12177 and L748,337 competed selectively on \u03b23-ARs because L748,337 had no effect on isoprenaline-induced stimulation of I(Ca,L), while CGP12177 completely blocked the effect of isoprenaline. The activation of \u03b23-ARs by CGP12177 does not involve the activation of Gi proteins because CGP12177 had no effect on forskolin-induced stimulation of I(Ca,L). CGP12177 had no effect on the force of contraction of human ventricular trabeculae. L-NMMA, an inhibitor of NO synthase, and IBMX, a nonselective inhibitor of phosphodiesterases, did not potentiate the effect of CGP12177 either on contraction of human ventricular trabeculae or on I(Ca,L) in HVMs. We conclude that in human ventricles \u03b23-AR activation has no inotropic effect, while it slightly increases I(Ca,L). In contrast to human atrium, the activation of \u03b23-ARs in human ventricle is not accompanied by increased activity of phosphodiesterases.",

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest and abdomen demonstrated generalized calcified atherosclerotic narrowing of the arteries including the renal, celiac, superior mesenteric and coronary arteries in the setting of hyperlipidemia. The lipid panel revealed hypercholesterolemia with elevated serum plant sterol concentrations, suggesting the diagnosis of sitosterolemia. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery stenosis, which required bypass of the left anterior descending artery and stenting of the left circumflex artery.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether \u03b2\u2081-AABs have deleterious effects on vascular reactivity in rats. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect \u03b2\u2081-AABs in sera from immunized rats over a period of 1-3 months using the peptidic sequence of the second extracellular loop of human \u03b2\u2081-AR. Functional studies were performed in thoracic aortic (TA) and small mesenteric artery (SMA) rings from immunized rats. Following pre-contraction with phenylephrine (0.3 \u03bcM and 3 \u03bcM for the TA and SMA respectively), cumulative concentration-response curves (CCRCs) to various \u03b2-AR agonists (isoproterenol, dobutamine, salbutamol, SR 58611A), acetylcholine, A23187, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were then plotted. The relaxations induced by dobutamine, SR 58611A, and acetylcholine were significantly impaired, but salbutamol-induced relaxations were not affected, in both vessels from immunized rats. A significant impairment of isoproterenol-induced relaxation was only observed in SMA. CCRCs to SNP were not modified in either of the vessels. A23187-induced relaxation was impaired in immunized rats. Following pretreatment with L-arginine, vasorelaxation to acetylcholine and SR 58611A was restored in immunized rats. This study demonstrates that immunization against the second extracellular loop of \u03b2\u2081-ARs has a deleterious impact on vasorelaxations in the TA and SMA of rats, involving alterations in endothelium-dependent NO signaling pathways.",

    "48": "It is well documented that norepinephrine (NE) releasing neurons in the locus coeruleus, a brainstem nucleus that is a major source of NE for the brain, degenerate during the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). A number of studies also suggest that, as a result, there is less NE released in the brain during disease progression, which may contribute to the pathophysiology and symptomatology of PD. This paper puts forth the novel hypothesis that NE degeneration in PD is preceded by elevated NE signaling, mainly as a result of genetics, and that this elevation is a major etiological factor in the disease. In this scenario, long-term (if not lifelong) elevated NE signaling could eventually invoke compensatory mechanisms that result in noradrenergic, and possibly dopaminergic, cell death. Several lines of evidence are briefly reviewed on the relationship between NE signaling and PD, including studies of: the level of NE; drugs that increase or decrease NE signaling; the relationship between PD and bipolar disorder, hypertension, and obesity, since the latter three conditions may be associated with increased NE signaling; and the relationship between PD and psychological stress, since stress is associated with increased release of NE. Many of these studies support NE degeneration during the disease, although some are consistent with elevated NE signaling during disease progression. Because there are few data on the state of the NE system prior to disease onset, the central point of this paper that NE signaling is elevated prior to development of PD, remains largely hypothetical. If elevated NE signaling really is an etiological factor in this disease, then early identification of susceptible individuals and long-term treatment with NE transmission reducing drugs, may help prevent or slow progression of PD.",

Chitosan nanocomposites containing varying GO contents and drug loading ratios were investigated. The nanocomposite with 2 wt % GO provided the optimal combination of mechanical properties and drug-loading capacity. It offered a faster and a more substantial release of drug than chitosan as well as a slower biodegradation rate, owing to the abundant oxygenated functional groups, hydrophilicity and large specific surface area of GO sheets. The drug delivery profiles of the nanocomposite were dependent on the drug loading ratio, with 0.84:1 being the best ratio of drug to GO for a quick and high release of the loaded drug. The nanocomposite also demonstrated pH sensitivity of drug release, releasing 48% less drug in an acidic condition than in a neutral environment.", 
    "58": "The objective of the present study was to develop bilayer tablets of atorvastatin and atenolol that are characterized by initial fast-release of atorvastatin in the stomach and comply with the release requirements of sustained-release of atenolol. An amorphous, solvent evaporation inclusion complex of atorvastatin with \u03b2 -cyclodextrin, present in 1 : 3 (drug/cyclodextrin) molar ratio, was employed in the fast-release layer to enhance the dissolution of atorvastatin. Xanthan gum and guar gum were integrated in the sustained-release layer. Bilayer tablets composed of sustained-release layer (10% w/w of xanthan gum and guar gum) and fast-release layer [1 : 3 (drug/cyclodextrin)] showed the desired release profile. The atorvastatin contained in the fast-release layer showed an initial fast-release of more than 60% of its drug content within 2 h, followed by sustained release of the atenolol for a period of 12 h. The pharmacokinetic study illustrated that the fast absorption and increased oral bioavailability of atorvastatin as well as therapeutic concentration of atenolol in blood were made available through adoption of formulation strategy of bilayer tablets. It can be concluded that the bilayer tablets of atorvastatin and atenolol can be successfully employed for the treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia together through oral administration of single tablet.", 
    "59": "Based on DFT, MP2, and the density functional from Truhlar group (hybrid GGA: MPW1k) calculations for an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nine Kirby's N-alkylmaleamic acids and two atenolol prodrugs were designed. The calculations demonstrated that the amide bond cleavage is due to intramolecular nucleophilic catalysis by the adjacent carboxylic acid group and the rate-limiting step is determined based on the nature of the amine leaving group. In addition, a linear correlation of the calculated and experimental rate values has drawn credible basis for designing atenolol prodrugs that are bitterless, are stable in neutral aqueous solutions, and have the potential to release the parent drug in a sustained release manner. For example, based on the calculated B3LYP/6-31 G (d,p) rates, the predicted t1/2 (a time needed for 50% of the prodrug to be converted into drug) values for atenolol prodrugs ProD 1-ProD 2 at pH 2 were 65.3 hours (6.3 hours as calculated by GGA: MPW1K) and 11.8 minutes, respectively. In vitro kinetic study of atenolol prodrug ProD 1 demonstrated that the t1/2 was largely affected by the pH of the medium. The determined t1/2 values in 1N HCl, buffer pH2, and buffer pH 5 were 2.53, 3.82, and 133 hours, respectively.",

Early study withdrawal owing to AEs occurred in 6 (75%) of 8 patients in the prednisolone group but 0 of 11 propranolol-treated participants.

    "75": "Assessing the interactions of a new drug candidate with transporters, either as a substrate or as an inhibitor, is no simple matter. There are many clinically relevant transporters, as many as nine to be evaluated for an FDA submission and up to eleven for the EMA as of 2013. Additionally, it is likely that if a compound is a substrate or inhibitor of one transporter, it will be so for other transporters as well. There are practically no specific substrates or inhibitors, presumably because the specificities of drug transporters are so broad and overlapping, and even fewer clinically relevant probes that can be used to evaluate transporter function in humans. In the case of some transporters, it is advisable to evaluate an NCE with more than one test system and/or more than one probe substrate in order to convince oneself (and regulatory authorities) that a clinical drug interaction study is not warranted. Finally, each test system has its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. One has to really appreciate the nuances of the available tools (test systems, probe substrates, etc.) to select the best tools for the job and design the optimal in vitro experiment. In this chapter, several examples are used to illustrate the successful interpretation of in vitro data for both efflux and uptake transporters. Some data presented in this chapter is unpublished at the time of compilation of this book. It has been incorporated in this chapter to provide a sense of complexities in transporter kinetics to the reader.", 
    "76": "Pannexin1 (Panx1), a channel-forming glycoprotein is expressed in neonatal but not in aged mouse skin. Histological staining of Panx1 knockout (KO) mouse skin revealed a reduction in epidermal and dermal thickness and an increase in hypodermal adipose tissue. Following dorsal skin punch biopsies, mutant mice exhibited a significant delay in wound healing. Scratch wound and proliferation assays revealed that cultured keratinocytes from KO mice were more migratory, whereas dermal fibroblasts were more proliferative compared with controls. In addition, collagen gels populated with fibroblasts from KO mice exhibited significantly reduced contraction, comparable to WT fibroblasts treated with the Panx1 blocker, probenecid. KO fibroblasts did not increase \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression in response to TGF-\u03b2, as is the case for differentiating WT myofibroblasts during wound contraction. We conclude that Panx1 controls cellular properties of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts during early stages of skin development and modulates wound repair upon injury.", 
    "77": "UV/H2O2 and UV/peroxodisulfate (PDS) processes were adopted to degrade a typical beta-blocker atenolol (ATL). The degradation efficiencies under various operational parameters (oxidant dosage, pH, HCO3-, humic acid (HA), NO3-, and Cl-) were compared. Principal factor analysis was also performed with a statistical method for the two processes. It was found that increasing the specific dosage of the two peroxides ([peroxide]0/[ATL]0) ranging from 1:1 to 8:1 led to a faster degradation rate but also higher peroxide residual. Within the pH range 3-11, the optimum pH was 7 for the UV/PDS process and elevating pH benefitted the UV/H2O2 process. The presence of HCO3-, HA, and Cl- adversely affected ATL oxidation in both processes. The NO3- concentration 1-3 mmol/L accelerated the destruction of ATL by the UV/PDS process, but further increase of NO3- concentration retarded the degradation process, contrary to the case in the UV/H2O2 process. The rank orders of effects caused by the six operational parameters were pH approximately specific dosage > [HA]0 > [NO3-]0 > [HCO3-]0 > [Cl-]0 for the UV/H2O2 process and specific dosage > pH > [HA]0 > [NO3-]0 > [HCO3-]0 > [Cl-]0 for the UV/PDS process. The UV/PDS process was more sensitive to changes in operational parameters than the UV/H2O2 process but more efficient in ATL removal under the same conditions.", 
    "78": "Senescence of vascular endothelial cells is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of age-associated vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis. We investigated the effects of antihypertensive agents on high glucose-induced cellular senescence in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs). Exposure of HUVECs to high glucose (22 mM) for 3 days increased senescence-associated- \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activity, a senescence marker, and decreased telomerase activity, a replicative senescence marker. The calcium channel blocker nifedipine, but not the \u03b21-adrenergic blocking agent atenolol or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril, reduced SA-\u03b2-gal positive cells and prevented a decrease in telomerase activity in a high-glucose environment. This beneficial effect of nifedipine was associated with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. Thus, nifedipine prevented high glucose-induced ROS generation and increased basal eNOS phosphorylation level at Ser-1177. Treatment with N (G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME) and transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting eNOS eliminated the anti-senscence effect of nifedipine. These results demonstrate that nifedipine can prevent endothelial cell senescence in an eNOS-dependent manner. The anti-senescence action of nifedipine may represent a novel mechanism by which it protects against atherosclerosis.", 
    "79": "In humans, there is a documented association between anxiety disorders and cardiovascular disease. Putative underlying mechanisms may include an impairment of the autonomic nervous system control of cardiac function. The primary objective of the present study was to characterize cardiac autonomic modulation and susceptibility to arrhythmias in genetic lines of rats that differ largely in their anxiety level. To reach this goal, electrocardiographic recordings were performed in high-anxiety behavior (HAB, n=10) and low-anxiety behavior (LAB, n=10) rats at rest, during stressful stimuli and under autonomic pharmacological manipulations, and analyzed by means of time- and frequency-domain indexes of heart rate variability. During resting conditions, HAB rats displayed a reduced heart rate variability, mostly in terms of lower parasympathetic (vagal) modulation compared to LAB rats. In HAB rats, this relatively low cardiac vagal control was associated with smaller heart rate responsiveness to acute stressors compared to LAB counterparts. In addition, beta-adrenergic pharmacological stimulation induced a larger incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in HABs compared to LABs. At sacrifice, a moderate increase in heart-body weight ratio was observed in HAB rats. We conclude that high levels of anxiety-related behavior in rats are associated with signs of i) impaired autonomic modulation of heart rate (low vagally-mediated heart rate variability), ii) poor adaptive heart rate responsiveness to stressful stimuli, iii) increased arrhythmia susceptibility, and iv) cardiac hypertrophy. These results highlight the utility of the HAB/LAB model for investigating the mechanistic basis of the comorbidity between anxiety disorders and cardiovascular disease.", 
    "80": "Combining multiple classes of antihypertensive drugs together is one of the most important factors for achieving blood pressure control in most hypertensive patients. The benefits of combination therapy in comparison with monotherapy include: a synergistic enhancement of each drug's hypertensive effects and a potential reduction of side effects if each drug is used at a lower dose. Although long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and \u03b2-blockers are a good fit for combination therapy, because of the risk of atrioventricular block and bradycardia, the combination of verapamil and \u03b2-blockers is not advised. In addition, the combination of higher-dose diltiazem and \u03b2-blockers is also not advised. \u03b2-blockers and diuretic agents as initial lone combination therapy are not the preferred combination to be used in uncomplicated hypertension. Using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor as initial combination therapy with most \u03b2-blockers is not recommended because of a lack of antihypertensive efficacy. Nebivolol, however, appears different in this regard and might provide an opportunity for combining these 2 classes of agents with proven cardiovascular benefits for better blood pressure control. Adding an \u03b1-blocker to a \u03b2-blocker is an effective combination.", 
    "81": "A 59-year-old man presented to the emergency department with lightheadedness. He had started intranasal administration of ophthalmic timolol for the prevention of epistaxis associated with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia approximately 3 weeks earlier with excellent response. His heart rate was about half its normal rate, an ECG revealed sinus bradycardia, and it was determined he had significant cardiac issues in his family history. Essentially all other tests were normal. The discontinuation of the intranasal use of timolol resolved any further episodes of lightheadedness and bradycardia. It was determined through genetic testing that he is an intermediate metaboliser of CYP2D6, the main enzyme contributing to the metabolism of timolol. This explains the development of the bradycardia after intranasal timolol use. The metabolising variants of CYP2D6 need to be considered when prescribing medications metabolised by this enzyme, so possible adverse effects can be avoided.",

Desflurane inhibited If, ICa,T, ICa,L, INCX, and IKs but had little effect on IKr. The negative chronotropic action of desflurane was reasonably well reproduced in sinoatrial node computer model. Desflurane reduced the heart rate in Langendorff-perfused hearts.

    "91": "The aim of the present study was to analyze the impact of lipid-based formulation (LBF) dispersion and digestion on the precipitation behavior of weakly basic drugs. Loratadine and carvedilol were formulated in a range of LBFs and drug solubilization was analyzed under simulated dispersive and digestive conditions (fasted state). The extent of supersaturation and drug precipitation as well as the solid-state properties and redissolution behavior of precipitated drugs were assessed. X-ray powder diffraction indicated that carvedilol precipitated in a crystalline form upon dispersion, but interestingly, this drug gave an amorphous precipitate during lipolysis. In contrast, loratadine precipitated as crystalline material during both formulation dispersion and digestion. No influence of the formulation composition on the type of precipitation was observed. These results suggested that in vitro conditions (dispersive versus digestive) largely influenced the solid-state properties of precipitating weak bases. Solid-state characterization of precipitated drugs under different experimental conditions should be routinely performed in formulation screening to better understand the biopharmaceutical behavior of LBFs. Hence, these findings are of high practical importance for the pharmaceutical development and in vitro assessment of LBFs using weakly basic drugs.",

This would be a valuable tool for the assessment of drug candidates during early drug development, especially for compounds intended to be developed as oral extended release formulations. Freshly prepared faecal homogenate from healthy human volunteers (n=3-18), dog (n=6) and rat (colon and caecal content, n=3) was homogenised with 3.8 parts (w/w) physiological saline under anaerobical conditions. Four model compounds (almokalant, budesonide, ximelagatran and metoprolol) were then incubated (n=3-18) separately in the human faecal homogenate for up to 120min at 37\u00b0C. In addition, ximelagatran was also incubated in the faecal or colonic content from dog and rat. The mean (\u00b1SD) in vitro half-life for almokalant, budesonide and ximelagatran was 39\u00b11, 68\u00b121 and 26\u00b112min, respectively, in the human faecal homogenate. Metoprolol was found to be stable in the in vitro model. The in vitro degradation data was then compared to literature data on fraction absorbed after direct colon administration in humans. The percentage of drug remaining after 60min of in vitro incubation correlated (R(2)=0.90) with the fraction absorbed from colon in humans. The mean in vitro half-life of ximelagatran was similar in human faeces (26\u00b112min) and rat colon content (34\u00b131min), but significantly (p<0.05) longer in rat caecum content (50\u00b111min) and dog faeces (126\u00b117min). The in vitro method is in vivo relevant both qualitatively as all the model drugs that undergoes colonic degradation in vivo was rapidly degraded in the faecal homogenates as well as quantitatively since a correlation was established between percentage degraded in vitro at 60min and fraction absorbed in the colon for the model drugs, which have no other absorption limiting properties. Also, the method is easy to use from a technical point of view, which suggests that the method is suitable for use in early assessment of colonic absorption of extended release formulation candidates. Further improvement of the confidence in the use of the method would either require an extension of the correlation, which most likely will require more human regional absorption studies, or by including colonic degradation rate as an input in a physiological mechanistic absorption model and evaluate if the prediction of the plasma exposure after colonic administration of the present model drugs is improved.", 
    "93": "The rodent stress hormone corticosterone rapidly enhances long-term potentiation in the CA1 hippocampal area, but leads to a suppression when acting in a more delayed fashion. Both actions are thought to contribute to stress effects on emotional memory. Emotional memory formation also involves the basolateral amygdala, an important target area for corticosteroid actions. We here (1) investigated the rapid effects of corticosterone on amygdalar synaptic potentiation, (2) determined to what extent these effects depend on the mouse's recent stress history or (3) on prior \u03b2-adrenoceptor activation; earlier studies at the single cell level showed that especially a recent history of stress changes the responsiveness of basolateral amygdala neurons to corticosterone. We report that, unlike the hippocampus, stress enhances amygdalar synaptic potentiation in a slow manner. In vitro exposure to 100 nM corticosterone quickly decreases synaptic potentiation, and causes only transient potentiation in tissue from stressed mice. This transient type of potentiation is also seen when \u03b2-adrenoceptors are blocked during stress and this is further exacerbated by subsequent in vitro administered corticosterone. We conclude that stress and corticosterone change synaptic potentiation in the basolateral amygdala in a manner opposite to that seen in the hippocampus and that renewed exposure to corticosterone only allows induction of non-persistent forms of synaptic potentiation.", 
    "94": "Aqueous solubility is an essential characteristic assessed during drug development to determine a compound's drug-likeness since solubility plays an important pharmaceutical role. However, nearly half of the drug candidates discovered today display poor water solubility; therefore methods have to be applied to increase solubility. Solubility determination using the CheqSol method is a novel rapid solubility screening technique for ionisable compounds. The aim of this study is to determine if the CheqSol method can be employed to determine solubility increases of four test drugs (ibuprofen, gliclazide, atenolol and propranolol) induced by non-ionising excipients such as hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin and poloxamers 407 and 188. CheqSol assays were performed for the drugs alone or in combination with varying solubiliser concentrations. The measured intrinsic solubility of all four drugs increased with all the excipients tested in an excipient concentration dependent manner providing results consistent with previous literature. The results demonstrate that it may be possible to use this method to determine the solubility increases induced by non-ionic solubilising excipients with results that are comparable to standard equilibrium based solubility techniques. Since the technique is automated and requires only small drug quantities it may serve as a useful solubility or formulation screening tool providing more detailed physicochemical information than multiwell plate or similar visual systems.", 
    "95": "Estimates of the lifetime prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in American adults range from 6.4% to 6.8%. PTSD is associated with increased risk for comorbid major depression, substance use disorder, suicide, and a variety of other mental and physical health conditions. Given the negative sequelae of trauma/PTSD, research has focused on identifying efficacious interventions that could be administered soon after a traumatic event to prevent or reduce the subsequent incidence of PTSD. While early psychosocial interventions have been shown to be relatively ineffective, early (secondary) pharmacological interventions have shown promise. These pharmacological approaches are largely based on the hypothesis that disruption of altered stress hormone levels and the consequent formation of trauma memories could protect against the development of PTSD. The present manuscript reviews the literature regarding the role of peri-traumatic stress hormones as risk factors for the development of PTSD and reviews evidence for the efficacy of exogenously modulating stress hormone levels to prevent/buffer the development of PTSD symptoms. Whereas prior literature has focused primarily on either child or adult studies, the present review incorporates both child and adult studies in a developmental approach to understanding risk for PTSD and how pharmacological modulation of acute memories may buffer the development of PTSD symptoms.",

Furthermore, transfection of mGlu1\u03b1 receptor with mutated caveolin-binding domain reduced localization of the receptor to lipid rafts.

We hypothesized that HCN4 inhibition could reverse autonomic imbalance in a human model of cardiac sympathetic activation. Nineteen healthy men ingested oral metoprolol+reboxetine, ivabradine+reboxetine, or placebo+reboxetine in a double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion. We assessed HR, blood pressure (BP), stroke volume, and cardiac output during rest and profound orthostatic stress. HR variability, BP variability, and baroreflex sensitivity were analyzed. Metoprolol, but not ivabradine, decreased resting HR and BP. Ivabradine attenuated the HR increase to orthostatic stress, albeit to a lesser extent than metoprolol. Stroke volume and cardiac output at a given HR were significantly lower with metoprolol. Unlike metoprolol, ivabradine did not affect HR variability, BP variability, or baroreflex sensitivity. Ivabradine attenuates sympathetic influences on HR at the sinus node level, leaving myocardial sympathetic activation unopposed. Reversal of parasympathetic dysfunction by ivabradine appears limited.",

    "107": "Isolated guinea pig left ventricular cardiomyocytes were incubated in primary culture and exposed to isoproterenol (1 \u03bcmol/L) or vehicle for 30 hours. Sustained isoproterenol exposure decreased IKs density (whole cell patch clamp) by 58% (P<0.0001), with corresponding decreases in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 1 (KCNE1) mRNA and membrane protein expression (by 45% and 51%, respectively). Potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1 (KCNQ1) mRNA expression was unchanged. The \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonist 1-[2-((3-Carbamoyl-4-hydroxy)phenoxy)ethylamino]-3-[4-(1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)phenoxy]-2-propanol dihydrochloride (CGP-20712A) prevented isoproterenol-induced IKs downregulation, whereas the \u03b22-antagonist ICI-118551 had no effect. The selective Epac activator 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP decreased IKs density to an extent similar to isoproterenol exposure, and adenoviral-mediated knockdown of Epac1 prevented isoproterenol-induced IKs/KCNE1 downregulation. In contrast, protein kinase A inhibition with a cell-permeable highly selective peptide blocker did not affect IKs downregulation. 1,2-Bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate-AM acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), cyclosporine, and inhibitor of nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT)-calcineurin association-6 (INCA6) prevented IKs reduction by isoproterenol and INCA6 suppressed isoproterenol-induced KCNE1 downregulation, consistent with signal-transduction via the Ca(2+)/calcineurin/NFAT pathway. Isoproterenol induced nuclear NFATc3/c4 translocation (immunofluorescence), which was suppressed by Epac1 knockdown. Chronic in vivo administration of isoproterenol to guinea pigs reduced IKs density and KCNE1 mRNA and protein expression while inducing cardiac dysfunction and action potential prolongation.

    "121": "Temporarily implanted devices, such as drug-loaded contact lenses, are emerging as the preferred treatment method for ocular diseases like glaucoma. Localizing the delivery of glaucoma drugs, such as timolol maleate (TM), can minimize adverse effects caused by systemic administration. Although eye drops and drug-soaked lenses allow for local treatment, their utility is limited by burst release and a lack of sustained therapeutic delivery. Additionally, wet transportation and storage of drug-soaked lenses result in drug loss due to elution from the lenses. Here we present a nanodiamond (ND)-embedded contact lens capable of lysozyme-triggered release of TM for sustained therapy. We find that ND-embedded lenses composed of enzyme-cleavable polymers allow for controlled and sustained release of TM in the presence of lysozyme. Retention of drug activity is verified in primary human trabecular meshwork cells. These results demonstrate the translational potential of an ND-embedded lens capable of drug sequestration and enzyme activation.",

One such cell source is bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs). Here, we examined the effects of moderate-strength static magnetic fields (SMFs) on chondrogenic differentiation in human BMSCs in vitro. Cells were cultured in pellet form and exposed to several strengths of SMFs for various durations. mRNA transcript levels of the early chondrogenic transcription factor SOX9 and the late marker genes ACAN and COL2A1 were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and production of the cartilage-specific macromolecules sGAG, collage type 2 (Col2), and proteoglycans was determined both biochemically and histologically. The role of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 signaling pathway was also examined. Results showed that a 0.4 T magnetic field applied for 14 days elicited a strong chondrogenic differentiation response in cultured BMSCs, so long as TGF-\u03b23 was also present, that is, a synergistic response of a SMF and TGF-\u03b23 on BMSC chondrogenic differentiation was observed. Further, SMF alone caused TGF-\u03b2 secretion in culture, and the effects of SMF could be abrogated by the TGF-\u03b2 receptor blocker SB-431542. These data show that moderate-strength magnetic fields can induce chondrogenesis in BMSCs through a TGF-\u03b2-dependent pathway.

The non cardioselective b\u00eata-blocker propranolol has been used in a pediatric setting for 40 years and, since 2008, has a new indication. A clearly significant improvement has been observed in the condition of children with complicated IH (10%) treated with propranolol. This new indication has been widely described in the international literature. Various explanations have been put forward for the mechanism of action including a vasoconstrictor, antiangiogenic and apoptotic effect of propranolol on the different cells making up an IH. Overall tolerance is good and the efficacy markedly superior to that of any other treatments used for this purpose. In conclusion, with its good tolerance profile and superior efficacy versus all the other available therapies, propranolol can be considered to be a first-line treatment for complicated IH.",

In previous work we found that apelin-13 facilitates the consolidation of passive avoidance learning in rats. In the present work we demonstrate that apelin-13 exerts anxiolytic action in an elevated plus maze in mice. In order to assess the possible involvement of transmitters in this action, the animals were pretreated with the following receptor blockers in doses which themselves did not influence the behavioral paradigm: atropine (a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist), haloperidol (a D2, D3, D4 dopamine receptor antagonist), phenoxybenzamine (a nonselective \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonist), methysergide (a nonselective 5-HT2 serotonergic receptor antagonist), propranolol (a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist), naloxone (a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist) and bicuculline (a \u03b3-aminobutyric acid subunit A receptor antagonist. Phenoxybenzamine, haloperidol, propranolol and methysergide prevented the action of apelin-13, whereas atropine, naloxone and bicuculline were ineffective.

However, reports on CRT in diabetic elderly patients are limited and controversial. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the functional role of T2DM on the effectiveness of CRT at advanced age. In this single-center prospective study, we enrolled 72 HF patients over 75\u00a0years old with and without T2DM who underwent CRT implant.

After 1\u00a0year, CRT improved myocardial ventricular geometry and functional capacity in a comparable proportion of diabetic and non-diabetic patients alongside with a similar amelioration in the functional status.

In a single-center, controlled, open-label, phase 2 trial (from November 2010 to July 2012), Morelli et al. randomized patients with a need of norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg to receive either esmolol or standard of care. Patients were included if, after 24 hours of initial resuscitation, hypovolemia was excluded (wedge pressure \u226512 mmHg or central venous pressure \u22658 mmHg) and heart rate was above 95 bpm. Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years, had previous b-blockers therapy, cardiac index was \u22642.2 L/min/m\u00b2 with wedge pressure >18 mmHg, were diagnosed with significant cardiac valvular diseases or were pregnant. The primary outcome was the reduction in heart rate between 80 and 94 bpm over a 96-hr period. Secondary outcomes included norepinephrine requirement, hemodynamic changes, organ function, adverse events and 28-day mortality. A total of 154 patients, 77 for each group, were enrolled. Esmolol was more effective than standard treatment to reduce heart rate within target limits; also, b-blocker therapy was associated with an increased stroke volume and left ventricular work index when compared to the control group. These favorable hemodynamic effects were associated with a better control of lactate levels, a higher reduction in norepinephrine and fluids requirement. Mortality was 49.4% in the esmolol group and 80.5% in the control group (P<0.01). This is the first study showing an improvement in cardiac function and 28-day mortality in septic patients adding b-blockers to standard therapy.

    "144": "Infantile hemangiomas (IH) is the most common benign tumour in early infancy.IH often grows under skins and subcutaneous tissues around head and neck, but it is not rare in ophthalmologic clinical work.IH in the eyelids, orbit and other organs, characterized by their very rapid growth, can cause severe complications, including ptosis and translocation of eyeball. Periocular IH might cause serious visual loss through induction of strabismic, deprivational or anisometropic astigmatism.Visceral organ involvement may become life-threatening. Patients need to be treated immediately in these scenarios. Conventional treatments for IH include the use of corticosteroids, sclerosing agents, interferon, vincristine, etc., which had some side effects and also not effective to all IH.Recently, many specialized clinics reported the impressive effect of \u03b2-blockers, mainly propranolol, in the treatment of IH. Although IH is not among the approved indications for \u03b2-blockers, propranolol is still recommended as the first line treatment for IH.

Primary care providers are well positioned to screen, assess, and treat patients with alcohol and other drug use because this use, and substance use disorders, may contribute to a host of medical and mental health harms. We sought to identify and examine important recent advances in addiction medicine in the medical literature that have implications for the care of patients in primary care or other generalist settings. To accomplish this aim, we selected articles in the field of addiction medicine, critically appraised and summarized the manuscripts, and highlighted their implications for generalist practice. During an initial review, we identified articles through an electronic Medline search (limited to human studies and in English) using search terms for alcohol and other drugs of abuse published from January 2010 to January 2012. After this initial review, we searched for other literature in web-based or journal resources for potential articles of interest. From the list of articles identified in these initial reviews, each of the six authors independently selected articles for more intensive review and identified the ones they found to have a potential impact on generalist practice. The identified articles were then ranked by the number of authors who selected each article. Through a consensus process over 4 meetings, the authors reached agreement on the articles with implications for practice for generalist clinicians that warranted inclusion for discussion. The authors then grouped the articles into five categories: 1) screening and brief interventions in outpatient settings, 2) identification and management of substance use among inpatients, 3) medical complications of substance use, 4) use of pharmacotherapy for addiction treatment in primary care and its complications, and 5) integration of addiction treatment and medical care.

    "147": "Data from RealiseAF, an international, observational, cross-sectional survey of 10,491 patients with atrial fibrillation, were used to characterize permanent atrial fibrillation (N\u200a=\u200a4869) and nonpermanent atrial fibrillation (N\u200a=\u200a5622) patients. Permanent atrial fibrillation patients were older, had a longer time since atrial fibrillation diagnosis, a higher symptom burden, and were more likely to be physically inactive. They also had a higher mean (SD) CHADS2 score (2.2 [1.3] vs. 1.7 [1.3], p<0.001), and a higher frequency of CHADS2 score \u22652 (67.3% vs. 53.0%, p<0.001) and comorbidities, most notably heart failure. Physicians indicated using a rate-control strategy in 84.2% of permanent atrial fibrillation patients (vs. 27.5% in nonpermanent atrial fibrillation). Only 50.2% (N\u200a=\u200a2262/4508) of permanent atrial fibrillation patients were controlled. These patients had a longer time since atrial fibrillation diagnosis, a lower symptom burden, less obesity and physical inactivity, less severe heart failure, and fewer hospitalizations for acute heart failure than uncontrolled permanent atrial fibrillation patients, but with more arrhythmic events.

    "149": "Bone vessel functions during bone remodeling are poorly understood. They depend on both vessel network structure and vasomotor regulation. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a systemic vasodilator that may modulate microvascularization. Moreover, although intermittent PTH is anti-osteoporotic, continuous PTH administration can be catabolic for bone. Finally, ovariectomy (OVX) reduces bone perfusion and vessel density in mice. We reasoned that the effects of PTH on bone vascularization might depend on its administration regimen and be impacted by ovariectomy. A 100-\u00b5g/kg PTH 1-84 daily dose was administered for 15 days to 4-month-old female C57BL/6 mice, either as daily sc injection (iPTH) or continuously (cPTH; ALZET minipump). Blood pressure (BP) and tibia bone perfusion were measured in vivo with a laser Doppler device. Histomorphometry of bone and barium-contrasted vascular network were performed on the same tibia. Compared with untreated controls, both iPTH and cPTH increased bone formation but had opposite effects on resorption. Both iPTH and cPTH were slightly angiogenic. Intermittent PTH increased microvessel size (+48%, p < 0.001), whereas cPTH decreased it (-29%, p = 0.009). iPTH increased bone perfusion (27%, p < 0.001) with no change in BP, whereas cPTH did not. The vascular effects of a 15-day iPTH treatment were analyzed in OVX mice and compared with sham-operated and OVX untreated controls. Two other anti-osteoporotic drugs, zoledronate (one injection, 70\u2009\u00b5g/kg) and propranolol, (5 mg/kg/d) were tested in OVX mice. Although no change in bone mass was observed, iPTH stimulated bone formation and prevented the OVX-induced reduction in bone perfusion and vessel density. Both zoledronate and propranolol strongly lowered bone turnover, but surprisingly, zoledronate prevented OVX-induced reduction in bone perfusion but propranolol did not. Our integrative approach thus demonstrates that the effects of PTH on bone vessel structure and function depend on its mode of administration as well as on the HPG-axis hormonal status, and that OVX-induced vascular changes are prevented by iPTH.",

Here we show that HIV-1 exposure stimulates amyloid beta (A\u03b2) nuclear entry in human brain endothelial cells (HBMEC), the main component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Treatment with HIV-1 and/or A\u03b2 resulted in concurrent increase in early endosomal antigen-1 (EEA1), Smad, and phosphorylated Smad (pSmad) in nuclear fraction of HBMEC. A series of inhibition and silencing studies indicated that Smad and EEA1 closely interact by influencing their own nuclear entry; the effect that was attenuated by dynasore, a blocker of GTP-ase activity of dynamin. Importantly, inhibition of dynamin, EEA1, or TGF-\u03b2/Smad effectively attenuated HIV-1-induced A\u03b2 accumulation in the nuclei of HBMEC. The present study indicates that nuclear uptake of A\u03b2 involves the dynamin-dependent EEA1 and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling pathways.

No randomised trial was identified that evaluated the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications on target end organ damage. The trials were of variable quality and most were funded by pharmaceutical companies.Among the angiotensin receptor blockers, candesartan (one trial, n = 240), when compared to placebo, reduced systolic blood pressure by 6.50 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.44 to -3.56) and diastolic blood pressure by 5.50 mmHg (95% CI -9.62 to -1.38) (low-quality evidence).

Previous studies showed that RIF is eliminated when retrieval-practice is carried out under psycho-social stress, anxiety, or in negative mood. However, pharmacological manipulation by hydrocortisone did not eliminate the effect. This study investigated the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on stress-induced modulations of RIF, addressing possible interactive effects of the glucocorticoid and sympatho-adrenomedullary systems. Participants learned categorized word lists and then received either 60 mg propranolol or a placebo. After 90 min they were exposed to the TSST. A third group did not receive any medication and performed a non-stressful control task with the same timing as the other two groups. Finally, all participants underwent retrieval-practice and final recall. Both TSST groups exhibited a stress-induced increase in cortisol-levels, and the placebo group also exhibited large increases in markers of sympathetic nervous system activity and more psychological distress at the time of retrieval-practice. Although, overall recall was poorer under stress, an overall RIF effect emerged irrespective of group and showed no clear modulation by stress with or without beta-adrenergic blockade. In previous demonstrations of RIF elimination by negative emotion, state induction and retrieval-practice followed very briefly after initial learning. Given that both the previous study of hydrocortisone effects on RIF and the present study used longer delays between learning and retrieval-practice, the possibility that stress effects on retrieval-practice eliminate RIF only relatively briefly after learning is discussed.",

In one mother given a cumulative total of amiodarone of 8\u2009g over 1 week, concentrations 11 days after the drug had been stopped were initially deemed sufficient to pose a risk to an infant. Over the next 5 days the concentrations steadily dropped with amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations being found to be at a level comprising minimal risk to the infant. Bisoprolol was not found in the expressed breast milk. In the second case the mother was given a single 150\u2009mg dose of amiodarone and breast milk concentrations were measured on postpartum days 4 and 5. Breast milk amiodarone concentrations were very low and of little concern clinically had the mother breast fed her baby. The risk to the baby of ingesting breast milk after amiodarone administration postpartum depends on the duration of amiodarone exposure, with a single dose posing minimal risk.

OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications in patients with open-angle glaucoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, multicenter, interventional cohort from the prerandomization phase of a randomized clinical trial at multiple ophthalmology clinics. A total of 603 patients (603 eyes) with primary open-angle glaucoma who were using up to 3 glaucoma medications were included. INTERVENTIONS One IOP measurement was made while the patient was using his or her usual medications to lower IOP (ON IOP). Eligible participants underwent washout of all IOP-lowering drops, and the diurnal IOP was measured 2 to 4 weeks later (OFF IOP). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Difference between OFF IOP and ON IOP. The hypothesis was formulated after data collection. RESULTS The mean (SD) ON IOPs for participants using 0 (n\u2009=\u2009102), 1 (n\u2009=\u2009272), 2 (n\u2009=\u2009147), or 3 (n\u2009=\u200982) medications were 24.2 (3.2), 17.5 (3.2), 17.2 (3.1), and 17.2 (3.1) mm Hg, respectively. Patients not using medication had a mean (SD) IOP decrease of 0.2 (2.8) mm Hg at the OFF visit. Patients using 1, 2, and 3 medications had mean (SD) IOP increases of 5.4 (3.0), 6.9 (3.3), and 9.0 (3.8) mm Hg, respectively, at the OFF visit. The percentages of patients with less than a 25% increase in IOP were 38%, 21%, and 13% for those using 1, 2, and 3 medications, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Discontinuation of 1, 2, and 3 medications was associated with a clinically significant increase in IOP, although with smaller effects for the second and third medications compared with the first medication. A substantial proportion of patients showed only small changes in IOP after medication washout, suggesting either that they were not using the medication effectively or that the medication itself, although used properly, was not lowering the IOP.

    "193": "An increase in body temperature accelerates biochemical reactions and behavioral and physiological responses. A mechanism to actively increase body temperature would be beneficial during motivated behaviors. The prefrontal cortex is implicated in organizing motivated behavior; the infralimbic cortex, a subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex, has the necessary connectivity to serve the role of initiating such thermogenic mechanism at the beginning of the appetitive phase of motivated behavior; further, this cortex is active during motivated behavior and its disinhibition produces a marked behavioral and vegetative arousal increase, together with increases in histamine levels. We wanted to explore if this arousal was related to histaminergic activation after pharmacological infralimbic disinhibition and during the appetitive phase of motivated behavior. We measured core temperature and motor activity in response to picrotoxin injection in the infralimbic cortex, as well as during food-related appetitive behavior, evoked by enticing hungry rats with food. Pretreatment with the H1 receptor antagonist pyrilamine decreased thermal response to picrotoxin and enticement and completely blunted motor response to enticement. Motor and temperature responses to enticement were also completely abolished by infralimbic cortex inhibition with muscimol. To assess if this histamine dependent temperature increase was produced by an active sympathetic mediated thermogenic mechanism or was just a consequence of increased locomotor activity, we injected propranolol (i.p.), a \u03b2 adrenergic receptor blocker, before picrotoxin injection into the infralimbic cortex. Propranolol reduced the temperature increase without affecting locomotor activity. Altogether, these results suggest that infralimbic activation is necessary for appetitive behavior by inducing a motor and a vegetative arousal increase mediated by central histamine.", 
    "194": "Calcium channel blockers are the strongest and most widely used antihypertensive drugs in Japan. Calcium channel blockers dilate both artery and arteriole that increases end-organ perfusion, thus possessing few side effects especially for the elderly hypertensive patients. The safety of calcium channel blockers was well established. In this paper, important clinical evidence supporting the effectiveness of calcium channel blockers and improving cardiovascular endpoints will be reviewed. Calcium channel blockers protect end-organs from hypertensive vascular injury. In addition, calcium channel blockers show non-inferiority to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics regarding cardiovascular endpoints. Furthermore, calcium channel blockers may have superiority to betablockers. Although cardiovascular protection by calcium channel blockers largely depends on their potent blood pressure lowering ability, including central blood pressure, calcium channel blockers can manifest blood pressure-independent vascular protection. Thus, calcium channel blockers are basic antihypertensive drugs, and constitute the treatment of choice to obtain target blood pressure for most hypertensive patients, especially for high-risk population and those with resistant hypertension. An intense treatment of hypertension with adequate doses of calcium channel blockers is mandatory to improve cardiovascular prognosis."
