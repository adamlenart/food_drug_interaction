    "0": "The beta-adrenoreceptor populations mediating atrial and ventricular chronotropic responses were studied comparatively in the unanaesthetized dog with chronic atrio-ventricular block. With this aim, we first compared the increases in atrial and ventricular rate induced by isoprenaline. We then compared the reductions of this isoprenaline-induced atrial and ventricular cardio-acceleration, observed after administration of cumulative doses of propranolol and alprenolol, both non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents, and metoprolol, a blocking agent selective for beta 1-adrenoreceptors. Isoprenaline induced a much more intense stimulation of atrial chronotropic beta-adrenoreceptors than of ventricular chronotropic beta-adrenoreceptors, whether or not the cholinoreceptors were blocked. Similarly, all three beta-blocking agents induced a more intense blockade of atrial chronotropic beta-adrenoreceptors than of ventricular chronotropic beta-adrenoreceptors, whatever the dose of isoprenaline considered and whether or not the cholinoreceptors were blocked. These results cannot be readily explained by quantitative differences in the distribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoreceptors in the heart, given the identical effects obtained with metoprolol, propranolol and alprenolol. Therefore, beta-adrenoreceptor populations are not identical throughout the nodal tissue, and in particular, differences occur between beta-adrenoreceptors in the sinus node mediating atrial chronotropic responses and those in the His bundle mediating ventricular chronotropic responses, which might be linked to differing sensitivities of these beta-adrenoreceptor populations.", 
    "1": "Responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and pressor hormones were investigated in the feline mesenteric vascular bed under conditions of controlled blood flow. Sympathetic nerve stimulation and norepinephrine produced frequency- and dose-dependent increases in mesenteric vascular resistance. However, when alpha-receptors were blocked with the non-equilibrium alpha-receptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, nerve stimulation and norepinephrine produced frequency- and dose-dependent decreases in mesenteric vascular resistance. These reductions in mesenteric vascular resistance were unchanged after indomethacin or atropine, whereas propranolol converted the mesenteric vasodilator responses to small vasoconstrictor responses. In these studies, responses to a variety of vasoconstrictor agents were enhanced after administration of propranolol. Sotalol, a nonselective beta blocker with little membrane stabilizing activity, also enhanced vasoconstrictor responses. The present data suggest that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors are innervated in the feline mesenteric vascular bed, and that vasodilator responses to norepinephrine and sympathetic nerve stimulation are independent of activation of muscarinic receptors or formation of products in the cyclooxygenase pathway. These data also demonstrate that there is a nonspecific potentiation of intestinal vasoconstrictor responses after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade that is independent of a membrane-stabilizing or receptor-mediated mechanism.", 
    "2": "In rat brain, the number of beta-adrenoceptors and activity of noradrenaline-dependent adenylate cyclase were examined after treatment with desipramine (7.5 mg kg-1 day-1) for three days alone or in combination with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (2 mg kg-1 12 hr-1), or with phenoxybenzamine (7.5 mg kg-1 day-1), which is a more potent inhibitor of alpha 1 than alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The only treatment which significantly decreased the specific binding of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, [3H]dihydroalprenolol was the combination of desipramine with yohimbine. Desipramine alone and desipramine with yohimbine also significantly reduced the formation of cyclic AMP in response to incubation with noradrenaline, the response to the drug combination being accounted for by addition of the individual effects of the drugs. The results showed that decreases in the activity of noradrenaline-dependent adenylate cyclase could become apparent before decreases in beta-adrenoceptor numbers. Whether these rapid changes in noradrenaline-dependent adenylate cyclase or in numbers of beta-adrenoceptors which are produced by combination of desipramine with an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, are of therapeutic value remains to be elucidated.", 
    "3": "The ability of various estrogen antagonists and agonists to compete with [3H]spiroperidol, [3H]domperidone, [3H]dihydroalprenolol, [3H]dihydroergocryptine, [3H]dopamine or [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine for binding to membrane preparations from rat brain tissue was tested. The non-steroidal triphenylethylene-type antiestrogens with an amine side chain--enclomiphene, nitromifene, tamoxifen and zuclomiphene--were found to be competitive inhibitors of [3H]spiroperidol (Kd = 0.12 nM; Bmax = 101 fmol/mg protein) and [3H]domperidone (Kd = 0.62 nM; Bmax = 86 fmol/mg protein) binding to striatal membranes. The Ki values ranged from 4-12 microM. Estradiol-17 beta (Ki = 480 microM) or diethylstilbestrol (Ki = 63 microM) were much less effective inhibitors exhibiting noncompetitive interaction with the in vitro binding of [3H]spiroperidol. The pharmacological relevance of the antiestrogen interactions with dopamine receptor binding is discussed with respect to adverse effects of the in vivo administered compounds such as nausea and vomiting.", 
    "4": "The beta-adrenoceptor density and the activities of adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase were examined to compare AH13 cells having lower beta-adrenergic responsiveness with other rat ascites hepatoma cells and normal rat liver cells. Normal rat liver cells used were cultured for 24 hr after the collagenase digestion of liver. The density of binding sites of 3H-dihydroalprenolol in AH13 cell plasma membrane was very similar to the density in AH44 and normal liver cell membrane, but that in AH130 cell plasma membrane was about 10-fold greater than those in the other three cell lines. The activity of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase was about 2.5- to 7-fold higher in hepatoma cells than in rat liver cells, but this enzyme activity of AH13 cells was not especially high among the hepatoma cells examined. The basal adenylate cyclase activity was lower in AH44 cells, but was higher in AH13 and AH130 cells than in rat liver cells. However, adenylate cyclase of AH13 cells was hardly activated by isoproterenol, while the enzyme of the other cells was activated 3- to 5-fold. On the other hand, adenylate cyclase of each cell line including AH13 was activated 4- to 14-fold by NaF. From these results, it is suggested that AH13 cells can hardly produce cyclic AMP by the beta-adrenergic stimulation because of the disordered interaction of beta-adrenoceptors with adenylate cyclase.", 
    "5": "Epinephrine exerts a direct effect on cell morphology, phagocytosis and mitotic activity of human trabecular endothelium in primary culture. Its action is probably mediated through both beta and alpha adrenoceptors in a dose-time dependent manner. Younger cells and cells that were loosely attached to the substrate were found to be affected more rapidly and severely than were older cells and those in confluent regions where cell-to-cell attachment and stress fibers were well established. Continuous exposure to epinephrine at a concentration of 10(-5) M led to cessation of the normal cytokinetic cell movements, inhibition of mitotic and phagocytic activity, marked cell retraction, separation from the substrate, and, by 4-5 days, degeneration of cells. Similar, but less marked changes were seen with a concentration of 10(-6) M, the cell degeneration becoming apparent after one week of exposure. A still weaker concentration of epinephrine, 10(-7) M, did not result in cell degeneration even after 10 days of exposure and observation. On complete withdrawal of the drug, the cellular effects were reversible even after 3 days' exposure to 10(-5) M and 5-7 days' exposure to 10(-6) M epinephrine. The action of epinephrine was partially blocked by pretreatment of cultured trabecular cells with the beta-blocker, timolol. Available evidence suggests that the mechanism of action of epinephrine is mediated through both beta and alpha adrenoceptors, and that it intimately involves the cytoskeletal system of the cells. Extrapolation of our findings in vitro suggests that use of maximal doses of epinephrine over a prolonged time may contribute to tissue damage in certain conditions of glaucoma.", 
    "6": "Helical strips of saphenous veins from diabetic (n = 8) and non-diabetic (n = 18) humans were studied in vivo for their responsiveness to several vasoactive agents. Following application of passive force (approximately 20.0 mN), venous strips from non-diabetic humans often developed spontaneous phasic contractile activity (12 out of 18 patients; 2-5 contractions/min). These intrinsic changes in force were seen in venous strips from only one diabetic patient. The phasic contractions were not altered by treatment with phentolamine, whereas the calcium channel blocker, D-600, and calcium-free solution (1.0 mM EGTA) inhibited the phasic contractions. Saphenous veins from diabetic patients developed less maximal, active tension in response to norepinephrine than those from non-diabetic patients. Contractile responses to serotonin, angiotensin II, and elevated potassium concentration in saphenous veins from diabetic patients were not different from those in veins from non-diabetic patients. These observations demonstrate attenuated development of active tension in response to alpha-adrenergic receptor activation and reduced spontaneous contractile activity in venous smooth muscle from diabetic patients.", 
    "7": "The effects of adenosine, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and structural analogues have been studied on glucagon secretion from the isolated perfused pancreas of the rat in the presence of glucose (2.8 mM). Adenosine induced a transient increase of glucagon secretion. This effect was concentration-dependent in the range of 0.165 to 165 microM. ATP also induced an increase, but the effect was no greater at 165 microM than at 16.5 microM. 2-Chloroadenosine, an analogue more resistant to metabolism or uptake systems than adenosine, was more effective. Among the three structural analogues of ATP or ADP studied, beta, gamma-methylene ATP which can be hydrolyzed into AMP and adenosine had an effect similar to adenosine or ATP at the same concentrations (1.65 and 16.5 microM); in contrast alpha, beta-methylene ATP and alpha, beta-methylene ADP (resistant to hydrolysis into AMP and adenosine) were ineffective. Theophylline (50 microM) a specific blocker of the adenosine receptor, suppressed the glucagon peak induced by adenosine, 2-chloroadenosine, ATP and beta, gamma-methylene ATP (1.65 microM). An inhibitor of 5' nucleotidase, alpha, beta-methylene ADP (16.5 microM), reduced the glucagon increase induced by ATP and did not affect the response to adenosine (1.65 microM). These results support the hypothesis of adenosine receptors (P1-purinoceptors) on the pancreatic glucagon secretory cells and indicate that ATP acts after hydrolysis to adenosine.", 
    "8": "Studies using tissue homogenates have demonstrated an increase in pulmonary beta-receptors during development. However, techniques using disrupted tissue have not permitted the precise anatomic localization of pulmonary beta-receptors or identification of structures where increases occur. Using L-[3H]dihydroalprenolol, beta-receptors were radioautographically localized and quantitated in sections of newborn (NB) and adult (A) guinea pig lung. Scatchard analysis showed a single class of binding sites with a maximum binding capacity of 189 +/- 3 (NB) and 305 +/- 37 (A) fmol X mg-1 protein (P less than 0.02). Binding was of high affinity with the dissociation constant (Kd) = 1.46 +/- 0.2 (NB) and 1.26 +/- 0.3 (A) nM (NS). The majority of beta-receptors were localized in alveolar wall and airway epithelia (alveolar much greater than bronchiolar greater than bronchial) (P less than 0.0001). Airway and vascular smooth muscle had significantly fewer demonstrable beta-receptors. The increased number of beta-receptors in the adult appeared to be due primarily to a 2.0 +/- 0.12-fold increase in alveolar wall and airway epithelia as opposed to only a 1.3 +/- 0.18-fold increase in the already low number in airway and vascular smooth muscle (P less than 0.05). While apparent receptor density may not necessarily correlate with physiological response or importance, radioautographic localization of pulmonary beta-receptors may significantly enhance our understanding of their role in normal and pathologic states.", 
    "9": "The albuminuria occurring after swimming in splenectomized dogs was investigated. Swimming in splenectomized dogs induces metabolic acidosis, a decrease in renal vascular conductance, and an increase in plasma renin activity, all three factors possibly implicated in the occurrence of albuminuria. The administration of sodium bicarbonate prior to swimming reduced the magnitude of the acidosis and eliminated the increase in albuminuria after swimming. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent that maintains the renal blood flow during exercise also blocked the increase in albuminuria despite a decrease of blood pH during swimming. However, after metoprolol, a beta 1-adrenergic blocking agent that blocks the rise in plasma renin activity during exercise, swimming causes a threefold increase in albuminuria (P less than 0.01). The albuminuric response to swimming preceded by saline was also significant (P less than 0.05). It is likely that post-swimming albuminuria in splenectomized dogs is linked to the decrease of renal vascular conductance or to the decrease in blood pH rather than to the rise in plasma renin activity.", 
    "10": "The beta-adrenoreceptor density in intact lymphocytes of peripheral blood of normotensive and hypertensive adults was measured by the radioligand binding technique with the use of 3H-dihydroalprenolol. The density of beta-adrenoreceptors was found to be higher in lymphocytes of hypertensive subjects while the number of the receptors was equal to 2076 +/- 208 and 1461 +/- 175 receptors per cell, respectively, in hypertensive and normotensive subjects. The dissociation constants in both cases varied from 0.4 to 1.8 nM. Probably, the decreased responses to the adrenergic agents in hypertensive subjects are not connected with the decreased number of beta-adrenoreceptors and may be due to alterations in postreceptor events.", 
    "11": "Phospholipid methylation was studied in rat brain cortex preparations. Adrenergic agonists stimulated methylation in a dose-dependent manner. The effect was stereospecific and the order of potency of agonists was isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than or equal to epinephrine. The stimulation could be blocked by propranolol. It was concluded that adrenergic stimulation of phospholipid methylation in these preparations involved a beta-adrenergic receptor and that this response was dependent upon an intact membrane environment. Neither adenosine nor histamine stimulated methylation. In fact, histamine appeared to inhibit methylation. Cleavage of phosphatidylcholine to lyso-phosphatidylcholine occurred in the presence of either adrenergic agonists or histamine, indicating an involvement of phospholipase A2. Norepinephrine-sensitive methylation in cortex homogenates from rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol administration was double that of controls by 72 hr after the final ethanol dose. Furthermore, basal methylation exhibited a decreasing trend during this period.", 
    "12": "Cardiac beta receptors in rabbits were studied at different times following lethal (5 Gy) or supralethal (10 Gy) whole-body X irradiation. Using the radioactive ligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol, it was found that the maximal binding capacity, as determined from the Scatchard plot, decreased from 298.2 +/- 13.2 fmole/mg protein in controls to 142.4 +/- 5.5 fmole/mg 3 days after 10 Gy whole-body X irradiation, whereas the dissociation constant was only little affected. Three days after an exposure to 5 Gy, maximal binding capacity was reduced slightly and tended toward control values at Day 7. Local irradiation of the cardiac region with 10 Gy reduced cardiac beta receptors to 218 +/- 7 fmole/mg (73% of control) after 3 days. The latter observation suggests that about half the effect of radiation on cardiac beta receptors originates from a direct action of radiation on the heart tissue, the rest being due to abscopal systemic reactions.", 
    "13": "Effects of prolonged in vivo infusion of isoproterenol on acute cardiovascular responses to isoproterenol, dopamine and tyramine were studied in pithed rats. Isoproterenol infusion resulted in a significant decrease in control values for maximum left ventricular dP/dt; heart rate and left ventricular systolic blood pressure were not altered. This treatment also depleted both atrial and ventricular stores of norepinephrine and caused cardiac hypertrophy. Isoproterenol infusion resulted in a desensitization of drug-induced cardiovascular responses. The acute in vivo effects of isoproterenol on maximum left ventricular dP/dt, heart rate and left ventricular systolic blood pressure responses to isoproterenol were severely attenuated. The ED50 for maximum left ventricular dP/dt was increased 36-fold and maximal responses were reduced by half; changes in heart rate occurred in a parallel fashion. By contrast, ED50 values for inotropic responses to tyramine and dopamine were increased 14- and 4-fold, respectively, whereas increases in heart rate were blunted. Tyramine and dopamine-mediated increases in heart rate were completely attenuated by desensitization; chronotropic effects were again evident after pretreatment with the selective alpha-1 blocker prazosin. In addition, prazosin blocked the inotropic responses to tyramine and dopamine after desensitization and this antagonism was only slightly enhanced by addition of propranolol (prazosin + propranolol); propranolol alone was ineffective. These results are consistent with the down-regulation of beta adrenoceptors after prolonged exposure to catecholamines and indicate that under such conditions the alpha-mediated cardiovascular responses may be unmasked. Compared to pure beta agonists, agents with a degree of alpha-1 activity might be superior inotropes in heart failure patients who characteristically present with depleted stores of myocardial norepinephrine and minimal beta adrenoceptor reserve.", 
    "14": "The effect of procainamide and digoxin, singly and together, on peak active force and rate of force development of isolated right ventricular papillary muscles from adult cats was examined. Procainamide (1.5 X 10(-5) M) increased force and rate of force development in each muscle with further increments in performance up to 2.4 X 10(-4) M in most muscles. The maximal increases in force (+/- SEM) averaged 75 +/- 13% above control values. Essentially no response to procainamide was observed when basal levels of contractile state were increased by increasing stimulus frequency or calcium concentrations of the bathing solution. Propranolol (10(-6) M) markedly reduced and verapamil (10(-7) M) abolished the inotropic effect of procainamide. Exposing muscles to procainamide (1.5 or 3 X 10(-5) M) before or after the administration of digoxin (2 or 4 X 10(-7) M) did not alter the inotropic action of either drug. Thus, procainamide in concentrations that are in the therapeutic range in human patients has potent positive inotropic effects that may be masked at high levels of contractile state. This action of procainamide appears to be due to an effect on calcium channels, which in part may be due to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. These concentrations of procainamide do not alter the inotropic response to digoxin.", 
    "15": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade with timolol (40 micrograms/kg) on myocardial blood flow during rest and graded treadmill exercise was assessed in 12 chronically instrumented dogs 10 to 14 days after myocardial infarction was produced by acute left circumflex coronary artery occlusion. During exercise at comparable external work loads, the heart rate-systolic blood pressure product was significantly decreased after timilol, with concomitant reductions of myocardial blood flow in normal, border and central ischemic areas (p less than 0.001) and increases in subendocardial/subepicardial blood flow ratios (p less than 0.05). In addition to the blunted chronotropic response to exercise, timolol exerted an effect on myocardial blood flow that was not explained by changes in heart rate or blood pressure. At comparable rate-pressure products during exercise, total myocardial blood flow was 24% lower after timolol (p less than 0.02) and flow was redistributed from subepicardium to subendocardium in all myocardial regions. Thus, timolol altered myocardial blood flow during exercise by two separate mechanisms: a negative chronotropic effect, and a significant selective reduction of subepicardial perfusion independent of changes in heart rate or blood pressure with transmural redistribution of flow toward the subendocardium.", 
    "16": "C6 glioma cells possess beta adrenergic receptors coupled with adenylate cyclase which can be irreversibly blocked by bromoacetylaminomethylpindolol (Br-AAM-pindolol), a beta adrenergic antagonist. With 1 microM Br-AAM-pindolol, more than 80% of beta adrenergic receptors, labeled by (3H)-dihydroalprenolol [3H)-DHA), were blocked. After this blockade, new beta adrenergic receptors were synthesized only during cell division. However, at cell confluency when the cell number was constant, turnover of beta adrenergic receptors was barely detectable. Cycloheximide (1 microgram/ml) inhibited cell growth as well as reappearance of beta adrenergic receptors. A 90% loss of beta adrenergic receptors in C6 glioma cells was obtained after down-regulation for 15 h with 10 microM isoproterenol, a beta adrenergic agonist. After removal of the agonist, recovery of beta-adrenergic-sensitive adenylate cyclase was complete within 2 to 3 days, whereas beta adrenergic receptors reached 90% of control value within 6 days. The half-life of the receptor recovery was 2 to 3 days. Pretreatment of C6 glioma cells by Br-AAM-pindolol and subsequent cell exposure to isoproterenol indicated that down regulation and recovery of unblocked beta adrenergic receptors did occur; however isoproterenol did not accelerate the biosynthesis of beta adrenergic receptors. The recovery of both biological response and beta adrenergic receptor occupancy was restored both in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (1 microgram/ml), a concentration which blocked 90% of protein synthesis. Our results suggest that reappearance of beta adrenergic receptors in C6 glioma cells, following isoproterenol-induced down regulation, was not due to synthesis of new receptors but to recycling of the beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "17": "ADRs in the elderly may present in an atypical manner. Atypical reactions are uncommon and usually cannot be anticipated from the chemical or pharmacologic properties of the drug. In many cases, you may find a careful and thorough drug history and knowledge of drug-related reactions more helpful than an array of laboratory data.", 
    "18": "A pharmacological approach was used to investigate the serotoninergic control of plasma levels on beta-endorphin (beta-EP) and beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) in humans. Acute administration of L5-OH-triptophan, the physiologic precursor of serotonin (SE), induced a significant rise in plasma beta-EP and beta-LPH levels both when injected iv (20 and 40 mg) (four normal men) and when administered orally (200 and 400 mg) (seven normal men) (P less than 0.01 vs. placebo). The iv route of administration induced a prompt (mean peak values after 150 min) dose-dependent increase in beta-EP and beta-LPH levels. The responses evoked by oral administration (mean peak values after 130 and 240 min) were not dose dependent. Fluoxetine (15 and 30 mg orally) a blocker of SE reuptake, induced a significant dose-related rise in plasma beta-EP and beta-LPH levels in a group of seven normal men (P less than 0.01) (mean peak values after 150 min). Pretreatment with methysergide, a SE receptor antagonist (3 X 2.8 mg orally, five men), did not induce any significant changes in plasma beta-EP and beta-LPH levels, but blocked the increase in the two hormones evoked by L5-OH-triptophan (40 mg iv). Plasma cortisol levels changed similarly to those of beta-EP and beta-LPH in all the experiments, indicating that putative serotoninergic drugs exert a positive role on the various corticotropin-releasing hormone-mediated secretions.", 
    "19": "In order to define the mechanism of the debrisoquine-sparteine type genetic polymorphism of drug oxidation we studied the kinetics of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation in liver microsomes from extensive and poor metabolizers and in a purified reconstituted human cytochrome P-450 isozyme with high activity for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, P-450[buf]. In extensive metabolizer microsomes the enzymatic reaction displayed apparent Michaelis-Menten kinetics and the (+)-isomer was preferentially metabolized. By contrast, the enzymatic reaction in poor metabolizer microsomes was characterized by a 4- to 5-fold increase in Km and by a loss of stereoselectivity. In a non-membraneous reconstituted system containing NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase, a NADPH regenerating system and phospholipids, P-450[buf] exhibited an almost complete substrate stereoselectivity for (+)-isomer 1'-hydroxylation. It is concluded that the purified cytochrome P-450[buf] is the target of the debrisoquine-sparteine type oxidation polymorphism and that poor metabolizers have a quantitative or qualitative deficiency of this isozyme.", 
    "20": "Intraperitoneal administration of insulin to control rats and to rats with pituitary stalk transections or with lesions of the median eminence resulted in increased plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) levels. The insulin-induced stimulation of ACTH release was blocked in both the control and lesioned animals by prior treatment with either the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol or the glucocorticoid analog dexamethasone. The direct application of insulin to primary cultures of the anterior pituitary did not evoke ACTH release or affect the maximal ability of corticotropin-releasing factor or epinephrine to stimulate ACTH secretion. The results suggest that insulin stimulates ACTH release by a mechanism in which catecholamines of peripheral origin act directly on the anterior pituitary.", 
    "21": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for the determination of labetalol, a novel antihypertensive agent, in human plasma was developed. Reversed-phase separation of labetalol and the internal standard was accomplished on a 150 X 4.1 mm column commercially packed with a spherical (8-12 micron particle size) macroporous co-polymer (PRP-1). Unlike silica-based columns, the unique properties of PRP-1 permit operation at pH extremes. Based on this advantage, a mobile phase which was sufficiently basic (pH 9.5) to optimize the fluorescent yield of analyte and provide the necessary specificity was selected. Detector response (peak area ratio) was linear from 4 to 500 ng/nl. Following a simple extraction procedure, samples were automatically injected and analyzed using micro-processor-controlled equipment. No interferences were observed in the extracts obtained from drug-free plasma which were processed under the conditions described for unchanged drug. The limit of quantitation using 0.5 ml of plasma was validated to 4 ng/ml. The inter-assay precision (coefficient of variation) was less than 4.6% at all concentrations evaluated from 4 to 300 ng/ml. This method is suitable for the routine quantitation of labetalol or its RR isomer (dilevalol) in plasma (0-24 h) following the administration of therapeutically effective doses to man.", 
    "22": "Alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors were measured in the pre-frontal cortex of parkinsonian patients post-mortem. The number of beta 2 receptors was the same in control and parkinsonian subjects. alpha 1 and beta 1 receptors increased in number, particularly in demented parkinsonian patients, while alpha 2 receptors decreased. The affinity constants were unchanged. The modifications seem to be related to lesion of the noradrenergic pathway from the locus coeruleus to the cortex. The relationship between this lesion and the symptoms of dementia and depression in parkinsonian patients is discussed.", 
    "23": "A survey of British consultant cardiologists was carried out to elicit their current practices when prescribing long term beta blockers after myocardial infarction. Sixty (72%) of the respondents reported that they used beta blockers prophylactically even in the absence of any other indications; the details of their stated policies, however, varied considerably. The favourable evidence of clinical trials in this indication appears to have been assimilated into hospital practice.", 
    "24": "A new method has been developed to raise monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies. Monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies were obtained by fusion of NS-1 myeloma cells with splenocytes of mice immunised by intravenous injections of fixed hybridoma cells bearing a monoclonal antibody specific for beta-adrenergic ligands. New screening tests were developed to analyse the resulting hybridoma supernatants for different anti-idiotypic properties. Among 23 hybridoma supernatants recognising the idiotype, 6 were found to inhibit hapten binding and 3 of these recognised beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "25": "A wide variety of drugs are available for treatment of hypertension. Diuretics, long the sole therapy, can control blood pressure in more than 40% of patients. If a diuretic alone proves inadequate, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, vasodilator, and central-acting sympathetic inhibitor may be added, as needed, in the familiar four-step program. A calcium channel blocker, with its vasodilating effects, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may be considered in appropriate situations. Selection among these agents should be based on knowledge of their pharmacologic action, duration of action, and side effects. With careful selection, blood pressure can be better controlled, side effects minimized, and patient compliance improved.", 
    "26": "An acute reduction in the synaptic availability of serotonin (5HT) by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) nullifies the decrease in the density of cortical beta adrenoceptors caused by desipramine (DMI) but does not appreciably alter the attenuation of the norepinephrine (NE) sensitive adenylate cyclase. The analysis of competition-binding curves of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol shows that the affinity of the agonist (-)-isoproterenol for cortical beta adrenoceptors is profoundly reduced following PCPA. This reduction in agonist affinity is enhanced by DMI. Resupplying 5HT by by-passing tryptophan hydroxylase inhibition, by administering 5-hydroxytryptophan, converts a DMI non-responsive to a DMI responsive beta adrenoceptor population and shifts the markedly decreased agonist affinity towards the affinity values found in control preparations. The results demonstrate the pivotal role of 5HT in the regulation of the density and agonist affinity characteristics of cortical beta adrenoceptors and contribute to the scientific basis of the 'serotonin-norepinephrine link hypothesis' of affective disorders.", 
    "27": "Propafenone is a promising new antiarrhythmic agent marketed in Europe for the past 7 years. The drug is remarkable for great interindividual variability in its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Propafenone undergoes extensive presystemic clearance that appears to be saturable, with bioavailability increasing as dosage increases. The drug is highly protein bound. Elimination half-life is 5 to 8 hours in most patients, although a range of 2 to 32 hours has been reported. Propafenone slows intracardiac conduction in a concentration-dependent manner. It is a weak beta-adrenergic blocker, but this property is of uncertain clinical significance. The major metabolic pathway for propafenone begins with aromatic ring hydroxylation, a pathway that may be determined by genetic factors.", 
    "28": "Ventricular arrhythmias play an important role in the pathophysiologic aspects of sudden cardiac death. To increase the precision in predicting sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmias can be classified into 3 groups: benign, potentially malignant and malignant. Benign ventricular arrhythmias pose negligible risk of sudden cardiac death; they usually present as palpitations and are not associated with heart disease. The frequency of ventricular premature depolarizations is usually moderate and repetitive forms are usually moderate and repetitive forms are usually absent in benign ventricular arrhythmias. Potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias pose a moderate risk of sudden cardiac death; they present as palpitations or are discovered on routine screening and are associated with significant heart disease. The frequency of ventricular premature depolarizations usually is moderate, and repetitive forms are present. It is not known whether treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs will decrease the mortality associated with potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias pose a high risk of sudden cardiac death; they may present as palpitations, syncope or cardiac arrest and have a strong association with heart disease. The frequency of ventricular premature depolarizations is moderate to high, repetitive forms are present and intermittent sustained ventricular arrhythmias occur. Patients who have malignant ventricular arrhythmias and respond to antiarrhythmic drug treatment are proven to have a much lower mortality than those who do not.", 
    "29": "The mechanism of agonist-induced desensitization of the beta adrenergic receptor coupled adenylate cyclase has been studied in a smooth muscle cell line, BC3H-1, which expresses both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors and nicotinic receptors. beta receptors have been investigated in intact cells using as radioligand 3HCGP-12177, an hydrophilic compound which labels only surface receptors. The treatment of BC3H-1 cells with the agonist Isoproterenol, at 37 degrees but not at 4 degrees, induced a dose dependent internalization of the beta adrenergic receptor. Agonist-induced internalization was very rapid, in the order of few minutes. beta adrenergic receptor internalization was very specific: the alpha adrenergic agonist Phenylefrine had almost no effect on beta receptor levels, while Isoproterenol treatment had no effect on the number of alpha adrenergic or nicotinic receptors expressed at the cell surface of these cells. beta adrenergic receptor internalization is probably the major mechanism responsible for catecholamine desensitization in smooth muscle cells.", 
    "30": "The intravenous administration of LTC4 to anaesthetized guinea-pigs induced dose-dependent bronchoconstriction, which was maximal at the dose of 1.6 nmol kg-1. The response was abolished by indomethacin. The maximal dose of LTC4, preceded by both (-)-propranolol and indomethacin, induced maximal, slow in onset and reversible broncho-constriction. This direct effect of LTC4 was markedly and long-lastingly antagonized by FPL-55712. The beta-blocker did not appreciably affect the systemic blood pressure changes induced by LTC4. The procedure described is suggested as a suitable tool for investigating the per se effect of leukotrienes on the guinea-pig airways in vivo, as well as the efficacy of their receptor antagonists.", 
    "31": "The present studies characterized the beta-receptor subtype involved in androgen production by cultured mouse testicular interstitial cells and explored the possible stimulation of androgen release by alpha-adrenergic agonists. During a 3-hour incubation period, LH and a non-specific beta-adrenergic agonist, L-isoproterenol steadily increased androgen production with a similar time-course. Isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine and a specific beta 2-receptor agonist, salbutamol stimulated androgen release in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentrations of the agonists required for half-maximum stimulation (EC50) were approximately 1 nM (isoproterenol), 8 nM (epinephrine), 9 nM (salbutamol) and 2 microM (norepinephrine) giving an order of potency of isoproterenol greater than epinephrine = salbutamol much greater than norepinephrine. L- but not the D-isomer of isoproterenol induced androgen production. A non-selective beta-receptor antagonist, propranolol, abolished androgen production induced by isoproterenol. A selective beta 2-receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 inhibited the isoproterenol effect in a concentration-dependent manner with half-maximum inhibition (IC50) at approximately 23 nM. The beta 1-receptor antagonists, metoprolol and atenolol had no effect on isoproterenol-induced androgen release. The stimulatory effect of norepinephrine (an alpha- and beta-agonist) was completely (100%) abolished by propranolol, unaffected by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine and only partially (35%) inhibited by phenoxybenzamine. Phenoxybenzamine and the alpha 2-agonist, clonidine reduced basal androgen production. These studies indicate that androgen production by primary cultures of mouse testicular interstitial cells occurs exclusively via the beta 2-receptor subtype and that alpha-receptor agonists do not stimulate androgen release by these cells.", 
    "32": "The anti-hypertensive action and tolerability of single daily doses of 80 mg nadolol, or 80 mg nadolol and 5 mg bendroflumethiazide were assessed in 30 subjects with mild or moderate hypertension. In both experiments a significant reduction in arterial pressure was observed, while no undesirable effects were noted. The association of nadolol and bendroflumethiaxide not merely proved to have a greater anti-hypertensive effect than treatment with the beta-blocking agent alone, but also led to the normalisation of blood pressure values in a higher percentage of hypertensive subjects than when nadolol alone was administered. This particular drug combination is thus the treatment of choice for most patients with hypertension. The fact that the beta-blocking agent and the diuretic can be administered in a single daily dose clearly enhances the patient's compliance with the prescribed treatment.", 
    "33": "Sixteen patients with chronic liver disease were treated with propranolol or placebo in a double-blind study. Skinfold thickness, total body water and exchangeable sodium, and urinary sodium were measured every 6 months for a year; body weight was measured every 2 (later every 3) months for 15 months. Propranolol treatment was associated with a significant rise in body weight after 9 months and significant rises in skinfold thickness and body fat after 12 months. Propranolol-treated patients showed a fall in total body water at 6 months and a rise in urinary sodium concentration at 12 months. They did not show the rise in total body exchangeable sodium that occurred in placebo-treated patients. Propranolol seems to affect salt and water homoeostasis favourably in patients with chronic liver disease.", 
    "34": "One hundred seven patients (77 women and 30 men) with migraine headache were given prophylactic treatment with timolol maleate, 20 to 30 mg/day, or matching placebo during a 20-week, double-blind crossover study. Among the 94 patients who completed the study, timolol was significantly better than placebo in terms of decrease in frequency of headaches from baseline, numbers of patients who had a 50% reduction in headache frequency, global response, and patient preference. Overall global response rates were 65% with timolol compared with 40% with placebo. The severity and duration of headaches that occurred were unchanged. Few side effects were reported with either timolol or placebo. The study demonstrates that the beta-blocker timolol is a safe and effective treatment in patients with frequent migraine headaches.", 
    "35": "Treatment of rats or liver homogenates with catecholamines (isoproterenol or noradrenaline) increased activities of both NAD+ -dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase and NAD(P)+-transhydrogenase (in the direction of hydrogen transfer NADPH----NAD+) with no change in NADP+ -dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. These effects were realized via beta-adrenoceptors. Cyclic AMP mimicked the catecholamine action on incubation with liver homogenate. The effects of catecholamines and cyclic AMP were not additive.", 
    "36": "This study compared the efficacy of a beta-blocker, pindolol, and a diuretic, clopamide, plus a vasodilator, endralazine, in the treatment of 30 patients suffering from moderate-to-severe hypertension. Different doses of endralazine were tested. This study showed that hypertension was controlled in 76,7% of patients receiving a combination of pindolol 10 mg and clopamide 5 mg (Viskaldix; Sandoz) plus endralazine 5 mg, and in 90% it was controlled by a combination of pindolol 10 mg, clopamide 5 mg and endralazine 10 mg daily. In 3 patients it was necessary to give pindolol 10 mg, clopamide 5 mg and endralazine 10 mg twice daily. Side-effects occurred in 5 patients, but they were not sufficiently severe for discontinuation of the therapy. There was no difference as regards the blood pressure response in the 15 Black and 15 Indian patients. Tolerance over a period of 14 weeks did not occur. Results of this study suggest that a fixed drug combination of pindolol 10 mg, clopamide 5 mg and endralazine 10 mg once daily could control blood pressure in about 90% of patients suffering from moderate-to-severe hypertension.", 
    "37": "Twenty-four-hour urinary outputs, total volume and urinary chlorine (Cl), sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium, magnesium (Mg), total inorganic phosphate and creatinine levels were measured in 12 biologically equivalent healthy volunteers given single oral doses of placebo, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 50 mg and a combination of HCTZ and sotalol (STL) 320 mg in a double-blind, random study. HCTZ and HCTZ + STL increased urinary volume and Na, K, Cl, phosphate and Mg levels significantly and to a similar extent. Since HCTZ causes hyperkaliuresis and hypermagnesiuresis with or without simultaneous administration of STL, the latter does not change the acute effects of HCTZ in healthy subjects.", 
    "38": "The effects of three different beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, propranolol, practolol and atenolol on platelet thromboxane production and the release of prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 into the circulation were investigated in healthy volunteers. The beta-adrenergic antagonists were administered intravenously at equipotent doses. The serum TxB2 levels after whole blood clotting and the arterial and venous plasma concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2 were measured before and during a 60 min period after the administration of the drugs, using radioimmunoassay. Practolol and atenolol elicited a significant decrease in platelet thromboxane formation but remained without effect on plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2 levels. In contrast, propranolol did not influence serum TxB2 concentrations but induced a significant increase in plasma content of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2. The results indicate that beta-adrenergic antagonists alter the balance between the proaggregatory, vasoconstricting and antiaggregatory, vasodilating prostanoids in the human cardiovascular system. Although the direction of the action of these drugs seems to differ depending on the selectivity of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties the net effect of this action should be beneficial.", 
    "39": "In vitro effects of DL-propranolol (a therapeutically used beta-blocker with local anesthetic properties), L-propranolol (having both beta-blocking and unspecific local anesthetic properties), D-propranolol (having local anesthetic, but much less beta-blocking properties), and talinolol (a therapeutically used beta-1-blocker with much less local anesthetic properties) on lecithin: cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity in human plasma were compared. Both D-propranolol and L-propranolol inhibited LCAT activity, the former being a little more effective. The racemic mixture showed intermediate dose-effect curves. In no case could a complete inhibition be achieved. Talinolol exhibited no effect on LCAT activity. Therefore, the inhibition of LCAT activity by beta-blocking drugs may be connected with their local anesthetic properties. Because LCAT inhibition is followed by a decrease of HDL cholesterol and an increase of triglycerides in plasma, it is recommended to use only beta-blockers without such side effects on lipoprotein metabolism for therapeutical purposes.", 
    "40": "The effects of separate and combined topical treatment with timolol maleate and trifluormethazolamide (TFM) on the intraocular pressure (IOP) were studied in normotensive rabbits. Timolol had a distinct, albeit small, dose related hypotensive effect. Unilateral application of timolol resulted in dose related decrease in IOP in the untreated fellow eye. These effects could be observed only by using a protocol that reduces the contribution of individual and diurnal variations to the overall variability in IOP in the rabbit. Topical treatment with TFM caused a reduction in the calculated outflow pressure of 32%, similar to that observed after systemic administration of acetazolamide and methazolamide. At the concentration and dosage employed here there was no significant difference between the hypotensive effects of timolol and TFM. The maximal decrease in the calculated outflow pressure for the different doses of timolol varied between 24% to 37%. The hypotensive effect of the combined timolol and TFM treatment (delta IOP = -2.4 +/- 0.4 mmHg, n = 12) was greater than that observed in rabbits treated with TFM alone (delta IOP = -1.6 +/- 0.5 mmHg, n = 12). The increment was smaller than the initial effect of either drug alone.", 
    "41": "M-mode echocardiography was used to evaluate the acute effect of intravenously administered diltiazem, 10 mg, and the chronic effects of oral diltiazem, 180 mg/day, and propranolol, 60 to 120 mg/day, administered for 2 weeks on left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in 13 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Intravenous injection of diltiazem reduced isovolumic relaxation time from 114 +/- 26 to 99 +/- 21 ms (p less than 0.01) and the time to peak rate of LV dimensional lengthening from 166 +/- 17 to 133 +/- 10 ms (p less than 0.01), without significant changes of LV dimensions or fractional shortening. No significant changes were observed in LV dimensions or fractional shortening, but a significant increase in peak rate of LV dimensional lengthening (from 4.1 +/- 1.5 to 4.8 +/- 1.6/s, p less than 0.05) and a reduction in isovolumic relaxation time (from 105 +/- 26 to 77 +/- 23 ms, p less than 0.01) and the time to peak rate of LV dimensional lengthening (from 156 +/- 23 to 124 +/- 20 ms, p less than 0.01) occurred during the oral administration of diltiazem. In contrast, propranolol caused no significant changes in these values. Thus, diltiazem improves LV relaxation and diastolic filling without altering LV systolic function in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "42": "In a group of 37 patients with definite acute myocardial infarction (AMI) allocated to treatment with either alprenolol (n = 20) or placebo (n = 17) serial determinations of concentrations in serum of myoglobin (S-Mb), creatine kinase (S-CK), aspartate aminotransferase (S-ASAT) and lactate dehydrogenase (S-LDH) were performed. The median peak levels of S-Mb, S-CK and S-LDH were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower among patients treated with alprenolol. The median of the estimated infarct size based on S-CK curves was also significantly (P less than 0.01) lower in the alprenolol group. There was no significant difference between the estimated infarct size based on S-Mb values in the two groups. It is concluded that the present study provides indirect evidence for the assumption that early beta-blockade in AMI can reduce infarct size.", 
    "43": "For clarifying the onset mechanism of essential hypertension, the hemodynamics in 9 mildly hypertensive men, mean age of 39.8 +/- 10.7 (mean +/- SD), was compared with 7 normotensive men, mean age of 39.8 +/- 10.7, by means of exercise echocardiography, and the effects of indenolol (administered 30 mg/day for 7 days orally to both groups) were studied. The interventricular septum and the left ventricular posterior wall were thickened in the mild hypertensives. No significant differences between the both groups were shown in the cardiac performance at rest and the cardiac index during exercise. The total peripheral vascular resistance was higher in the mild hypertensives than the normotensives during exercise. However, during exercise, the normotensives showed significant increases in the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd) and the stroke index (SI); these changes were not significant in the mild hypertensives. After administration of indenolol, the significant increases in LVDd and SI during exercise were observed in the mild hypertensives. This study suggests that mild hypertensives with cardiac hypertrophy display a diminished Frank-Starling effect during exercise which may be attributed to the decreased left ventricular compliance due to cardiac hypertrophy and elevated afterload. Indenolol improved the Frank-Starling effect, which decreased in the mild hypertensives.", 
    "44": "Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial (S-A) block was observed in a 57-year-old woman, under treatment for angina with 80 mg propranolol daily. The electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short P-P intervals and occasional pauses. These pauses were always preceded by the short P-P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P-P intervals of 0.92-0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycle. Following these basic sinus cycles, alternating rhythm started with the longer P-P interval. The long P-P intervals ranged between 1.04-1.12 s and the short P-P intervals between 0.80-0.84 s, respectively. The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P-P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle. In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2/1 S-A block was observed. This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P-P interval starting the alternative rhythm. There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P-R intervals. S-A conduction through two pathways, the first with 2/1 block the second having 0.12-0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2/1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P-P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen. Atropine 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all P-P intervals without changing the rhythm. The abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of propranolol and when the drug was restarted a 2/1 S-A block was seen. This was accepted as evidence for propranolol being the cause of this conduction disorder.", 
    "45": "Interactions of acoustic and somatosensory evoked potentials were studied in the anterior suprasylvian gyrus of the cat. Two kinds of interaction could be observed: occlusion or facilitation. In most cases occlusion was observed. The interactions showed dynamic changes and were susceptible to different kinds of influences. After having determined the control values of interaction over a period of several minutes, reversible enhancement of occlusion was observed after synchronous activation of the acoustic and somatosensory inputs with 2 Hz frequency. The same effect could be observed during stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation with 200 Hz frequency. The interactions could also be influenced by amphetamine and gamma-glutamyltaurine, known as drugs capable of influencing the arousal level of the brain. During treatment with amphetamine the interaction was shifted in the facilitatory direction. The antagonists of amphetamine (haloperidol and reserpine) prevented this effect. The authors suggest that the interactions of acoustic and somatosensory responses are mediated by interneurons (inhibitory and/or excitatory) and particular stimulus situations and drugs are able to modify the equilibrium between excitatory and inhibitory subsystems.", 
    "46": "The ability of pharmacological agents to reduce or limit the size of a myocardial infarct remains a highly controversial issue. This controversy had arisen as a consequence of inadequate models, methods of investigation, and indices of injury together with inappropriate interpretation of results. This paper discusses the principles of therapeutic infarct size limitation; the problems that have led to the controversy and the possibilities for tissue protection. In addition some new models are described together with recent studies which have been designed to reassess the possibility of pharmacological infarct size limitation in the light of our current knowledge.", 
    "47": "Treatment of 8 hypertensive elderly subjects with atenolol or with labetalol did not affect exercise performance, except after the development of circulatory congestion in 1 patient. Treatment with beta blockers did not alter the response to an exercise training programme in 15 elderly patients with ischaemic heart disease, as compared with 11 patients without such treatment.", 
    "48": "Neutrophils and peritoneal macrophages of mice treated with prodigiozan and propranolol were studied for their capacity to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium and absorption and inactivation of the cells of staphylococci and dermatophytes. It was shown that prodigiozan stimulated bactericidal activity of phagocytes, amplified macrophage fungicidity, and decreased neutrophil fungicidity in respect to the dermatophytes. Propranolol increased the prodigiozan capacity for stimulation of the oxygen-dependent metabolism of phagocytes and absorption and inactivation of staphylococci. However, it inhibited inactivation of dermatophytes by phagocytes.", 
    "49": "On 47 borderline hypertensives discriminative reaction tests (17 test persons) and ergometries (30 test persons) were carried out. It could be proved that both in psychic and in physical demand by beta-blocker therapy heart rate and blood pressure significantly remained below the initial value. The calculation of the interior heart work resulted in an economization of the heart work. By means of the beta-blocker therapy of the borderline hypertensives a more favourable situation in an increased functional demand and a decreased reaction of the blood pressure on psychic stress was achieved.", 
    "50": "The duration of the effect of histamine to increase the capillary filtration coefficient (CFC) was evaluated in isolated, denervated canine forelimb, hindpaw, and gracilis muscle. CFC was estimated at timed intervals during local intraarterial histamine (12 micrograms base.min-1 per 100 ml.min-1 blood flow). Propranolol (3 mg/kg) was administered to inhibit possible catecholamine-mediated inhibition of histamine-induced increases in CFC. The increase in CFC was greatest after 10 min of drug infusion and returned to control values after 25 min of histamine. These data indicate that the effect of histamine to increase CFC is highly transient. The relative contributions of increases in surface area and/or permeability to increases in CFC were assessed by maximally dilating the vasculatures of the three tissues with nitroprusside (increasing surface area to a maximum). Any further increase in CFC produced by combined nitroprusside-histamine infusion would then be due to increased permeability. Histamine, when infused concomitantly with nitroprusside, produced further increases in CFC relative to CFC obtained during infusion of nitroprusside alone. The time course for the transient increase in CFC during combined histamine-nitroprusside infusion was similar to the time course during histamine alone. These data suggest that the transient increase in CFC induced by histamine is primarily mediated by a transient increase in microvascular permeability to fluid in all three tissues. The transient nature of this increase in permeability was probably not related to a beta-antagonistic action of the catecholamines (which may have been increased reflexly) because these tissues were beta-blocked with propranolol. An equation was derived to estimate the ratio of the number of gaps which form between venular endothelial cells to the number of small pores. It was concluded that less than 3% of small pores need increase in radius to form large pores or gaps with radii ranging from 195 to 1000 A to explain the increases in CFC demonstrated in the hindpaw and gracilis muscle and that structures beyond the microvascular endothelium may provide the principle resistance to fluid efflux during histamine.", 
    "51": "The influences of vagal and sympathetic efferent activity on sinus arrhythmia in man have been studied in healthy subjects by administration of hyoscine butylbromide and atenolol alone and combined using a microcomputer-linked electrocardiogram (e.c.g.) system. Sinus arrhythmia was quantitated as the S.D. of the R-R interval. Sinus arrhythmia was reduced by hyoscine butylbromide, in some subjects to near abolition, but this end-point was unchanged by pre-treatment with atenolol. Atenolol alone prolonged the mean R-R interval and increased sinus arrhythmia. It is suggested that sinus arrhythmia in man is mediated through vagal efferents alone but that atenolol increases the arrhythmia through a central vagotonic effect.", 
    "52": "Unilateral electrical stimulation of the salivatory nucleus evoked a secretion from the ipsilateral parotid gland which was well maintained. Flow rate was not affected by sympathetic decentralization or by adrenoceptor antagonists but was abolished by atropine. Protein secretion was reduced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists but not by sympathetic decentralization or adrenalectomy. In support of previous histochemical findings it is concluded that the cells of the reticular formation are the origin of the preganglionic parasympathetic fibres to the salivary glands but that a beta-adrenoceptor mechanism as yet unidentified is also involved in the protein secretion.", 
    "53": "A rapid high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of esmolol hydrochloride, a new ultra-short-acting beta blocker, is described. The stability-indicating nature of the method was demonstrated by resolving esmolol from synthetic intermediates, potential impurities, and the product of decomposition. Reverse-phase liquid chromatography was performed with a microparticulate (10-micron) cyano-bonded silica-packed column, a fixed-wavelength UV absorbance detector (lambda = 280 nm), and a mobile phase of acetonitrile-0.005 M sodium acetate-acetic acid (15:84:1) pumped at 2 mL/min. The internal standard was 2-p-chlorophenyl-2-methylpropanol. A percent RSD of less than 1.7% and an accuracy (100% - mean error) of greater than 98.6% were achieved over the concentration range studied (100-500 micrograms/mL), with correlation coefficients greater than 0.9996.", 
    "54": "By lowering blood pressure, a number of hypertensive complications can be prevented, including congestive heart failure and such consequences of hypertensive arteriolar disease as nephropathy, intracerebral hemorrhage, and lacunar stroke. Whether atherosclerotic complications such as myocardial infarction can be prevented is more problematic and may depend on effects of the antihypertensive drugs other than the reduction of blood pressure, such as effects on plasma lipids and possibly hemodynamic effects. The following discussion summarizes a series of studies that suggest that the hemodynamic effects of antihypertensive drugs may be an important aspect of this problem. In studies in rhesus monkeys and hypertensive patients, antihypertensive drugs were shown to have differing effects on blood velocity and heart rate, important parameters in the genesis of arterial flow disturbances. In patients with carotid stenosis, hydralazine increased, whereas propranolol reduced, the occurrence of abnormal high-velocity flow patterns associated with turbulence and vortex formation. In a hypertensive (one kidney, one-clip) cholesterol-fed rabbit model, propranolol was significantly more effective than hydralazine in preventing the occurrence of aortic atherosclerosis. These observations suggest that the cardioprotective effect of beta blockers may extend to an antiatherosclerotic effect by hemodynamic mechanisms. This hypothesis is being further tested in patients with carotid stenosis.", 
    "55": "Intracardiac nerves of the frog isolated heart were cut and the central or the peripheral end was stimulated. The atrioventricular (a-v) conduction was measured. The data showed that the intracardiac parasympathetic nervous system could induce both acceleration and deceleration of the a-v conduction, depending on the parameters of stimulation. Atropine blocked both the positive and the negative dromotropic effects whereas beta-adrenoblocking agent inderal was ineffective. The possible mechanism of the dromotropic effects observed are discussed.", 
    "56": "Knee extension strength training of one leg (ST) (120 maximal contractions per day, 5 days per week for 9 weeks) was performed by 9 healthy young men. Before and after ST, biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of each leg and static quadriceps contractions (SQC) lasting 2 min were performed with each leg under control conditions and after combined vagal and beta-adrenergic blockade with atropine and metoprolol. Maximal voluntary contraction strength (MVC) increased more for the trained leg (TL) than for the untrained leg (UTL) but thigh circumferences and muscle fibre diameters gave little evidence for muscle hypertrophy. In pre- vs. post-training comparisons during SQC at the same relative force (40% of MVC) mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR) and smoothed rectified electromyographic activity were similar for TL and UTL. Similar findings were obtained for MBP after attenuation of the HR response by autonomic blockade, indicating that MBP, per se, was closely linked to the relative force of SQC. Pre- to post-training reductions in MBP and HR during SQC with each leg at an absolute force of 40% of pre-training MVC were likely due to changes in the pattern of motor unit activation. A lower MBP response to SQC and TL than of UTL after training correlated with a greater capillary density and a lower muscle lactate level for TL.", 
    "57": "Plasma timolol levels were measured in our timolol-treated glaucoma patients employing three protocols: (1) measurements in ten patients over age 60 on chronic timolol therapy before, one hour, and three hours after receiving one drop of 0.5% timolol, (2) measurements in nine adult patients, with and without punctal occlusion, and (3) random measurement of plasma timolol in children on chronic timolol therapy while under general anesthesia. In the ten patients over age 60 years, baseline mean plasma timolol was 0.34 ng/ml, increasing to a mean of 1.34 ng/ml one hour after receiving drops. When punctal occlusion was applied, the mean one-hour plasma timolol diminished to 0.9 ng/ml, approximately 40% less than that observed without punctal occlusion. The plasma timolol levels examined in nine determinations in five children ranged from a low 3.5 ng/ml in a five-year-old child to 34 ng/ml in a three-week-old infant.", 
    "58": "The positive inotropic effect of (-)-phenylephrine, in the presence of propranolol, was studied after inhibition of neuronal and extraneuronal uptake in isolated papillary muscles from reserpine-pretreated cats. An inhibition of extraneuronal uptake with hydrocortisone influenced the effect of (-)-phenylephrine neither when present alone nor in the presence of cocaine (additional inhibition of neuronal uptake). An inhibition of neuronal uptake with cocaine caused a small but significant increase in the potency of (-)-phenylephrine. We conclude that in cat ventricular cardiac muscle the extraneuronal compartment is apparently neither a \"site of loss\" nor a \"site of gain\" for (-)-phenylephrine with respect to force of contraction.", 
    "59": "Twenty-one monophobic patients with moderately severe fear of flying were exposed to two 40 minute challenge flights after taking either Timolol 20 mg/day or placebo. Heart rate, blood pressure, subjective ratings of anxiety, fear and palpitation and Hamilton Anxiety Scale ratings were made at the predetermined assessment intervals. Post-treatment global ratings of improvement were provided by patients and the attending psychiatrist. Results showed that heart rate significantly increased from baseline with placebo while Timolol successfully inhibited tachycardia during the challenge flights. Subjective ratings of anxiety, fear and palpitations did not show any drug group differences. These variables, however, showed a non-significant decrease from outgoing to return flight assessments after an initial significant increase from baseline scores. Hamilton Anxiety Scale ratings showed a significant decrease from baseline to post-treatment assessments, irrespective of drug group. Global improvement ratings revealed no significant differences between drug groups. Overall ratings by the psychiatrist were generally more positive than patients' ratings, with the difference between the two sources of assessment reaching significance only in the placebo group. Disregarding group membership, heart rate was positively and significantly correlated with subjective ratings of fear, but not with palpitations or ratings of overall anxiety.", 
    "60": "Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) concentrations and propranolol binding were investigated in the serum of elderly hospitalized patients with acute illness, and healthy elderly and young subjects. Significantly greater AAG concentrations and reduced unbound propranolol fraction were observed in the elderly with acute disease compared to the elderly controls. The greatest changes (up to five-fold) occurred with cancer, with lesser changes associated with myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease, acute infection, heart failure, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, and cerebrovascular accident. Various miscellaneous conditions were also associated with high AAG concentrations and enhanced propranolol binding. The healthy elderly had higher AAG concentrations and lower unbound propranolol fractions than the healthy young group. Overall there was a highly significant correlation between the propranolol binding ratio (bound/free) and the serum AAG concentration. These results suggest that the elderly population may be particularly susceptible to changes in AAG concentrations, and that during acute illness interpretation of serum concentrations of drugs which bind mainly to AAG, may require knowledge of their free fractions.", 
    "61": "This study assessed the possible interactions of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indobufen with one sulphonylurea, glipizide, and with two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, one of which is extensively metabolised already in the first passage through the liver (propranolol) while the other essentially escapes biotransformation (atenolol). Indobufen was first given as a single 200 mg dose and then for a 5 day period in a dosage of 200 mg twice daily, to six healthy volunteers. Glipizide (5 mg), propranolol (80 mg) and atenolol (100 mg) were given as single doses before and during indobufen medication. The drug concentrations were measured by selective and sensitive h.p.l.c. methods. The findings suggest that the lipophilic acid indobufen can inhibit the metabolic inactivation of another lipophilic acid, glipizide, but does not interfere with the disposal of the two basic drugs, propranolol and atenolol. The increased glipizide concentrations following indobufen were associated with an enhanced blood glucose reduction. Hence, this interaction may be clinically relevant.", 
    "62": "The objective of this study was to elucidate stereoselective mechanisms of propranolol metabolism in man. Five normal subjects were given single 80 mg oral doses of deuterium-labeled pseudoracemates of propranolol, and the stereochemical composition of propranolol and its major metabolites in urine was determined by GC/MS. The (-)/(+)-enantiomer ratios for unchanged propranolol, 1.50 +/- 0.10 (mean +/- s.e. mean), and propranolol glucuronide, 1.76 +/- 0.10, were similar to previous findings in plasma. All products of side-chain oxidation also consisted mainly of the (-)-enantiomer, with an overall (-)/(+) ratio of 1.61 +/- 0.11. A (-)/(+) ratio of 1.04 +/- 0.17 for 4-hydroxypropranolol did not indicate stereoselectivity in ring oxidation. However, the ratio for its glucuronic acid conjugate of 1.78 +/- 0.19 and for its sulphate conjugate of 0.27 +/- 0.03 suggested stereoselectivity in either the glucuronidation or sulphation of 4-hydroxypropranolol, or both. When the stereoselectivity in these secondary pathways was taken into consideration, the overall ring oxidation strongly favoured (+)-propranolol with a (-)/(+)-enantiomer ratio of 0.59 +/- 0.09. The composite observations of the stereochemistry of propranolol metabolism in man are consistent with stereoselective ring oxidation of (+)-propranolol, leading to a greater bioavailability of the pharmacologically more active (-)-propranolol and subsequent preferential side-chain oxidation and glucuronidation of this enantiomer.", 
    "63": "Hepatocytes obtained from animals partially hepatectomized (72 h before the experiment) have a diminished responsiveness to alpha 1-adrenergic amines, vasopressin, angiotensin and glucagon and an increased responsiveness to beta-adrenergic amines. Administration of inositol or tri-iodothyronine to the hepatectomized animals induced a recovery in the hepatocyte responsiveness to the Ca2+-dependent hormones and abolished that to beta-adrenergic amines; the response to glucagon was not improved.", 
    "64": "The effects of chlorpromazine, methysergide, and propranolol on thermal responses to 2.8 GHz radiofrequency radiation were examined in anesthetized rats. During intermittent exposure at an average power density of 60 mW X cm-2 (specific absorption rate, 14 W X kg-1), when colonic temperature was not allowed to rise above 39.5 degrees C, none of the pharmacological agents had any significant effects on thermal responses. When exposure was continued until lethal temperatures resulted, animals which were administered chlorpromazine, methysergide, or propranolol exhibited significantly shorter survival times than saline-treated animals. Propranolol administration caused the greatest decrease in survival time and resulted in a significantly lower lethal temperature than that which occurred in saline-treated animals.", 
    "65": "The nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0.3 mg/kg body weight) was given to rats, twice daily, from the day of birth to 5 weeks of age. The animals were then killed, and sections from gastric mucosa were prepared for light and electron microscopy. Propranolol treatment significantly reduced the thickness of the mucosa as compared with that of the controls. The parietal cell volume density and the number of parietal cells were markedly decreased following propranolol. The volume density of lamina propria and of other epithelial cells in the gastric mucosa were not significantly different from the control group. The secretory canaliculi of the parietal cells seemed markedly increased, indicating enhanced secretory activity. These findings suggest an important role for the adrenergic-sympathetic system in the development of parietal cells in the maturing gastric mucosa.", 
    "66": "The effect on bioperiodic parameters of hypertension elicited by the beta-blocking agent mepindolol, administered as a single dose of 10 mg at 8 a.m. vs 10 mg at 8 p.m., was evaluated in this study. Circadian blood pressure monitoring was performed in age-matched patients with essential hypertension after a two-week wash-out period with placebo and four weeks treatment. Patients were randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups. Standard blood chemistry and electrocardiogram were performed at the beginning and end of the treatment period. Statistical analysis of blood pressure circadian rhythm characteristics (mesor, amplitude, acrophase) showed a significant decrease of mesor of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both groups. Values of the mesor were not significantly different between the two groups. Interestingly, changes of acrophase and amplitude induced by the drug were different in regard to the time mepindolol was administered. Side effects were generally mild.", 
    "67": "The effects of propranolol on blood flow through gastroesophageal collaterals and on systemic and hepatic hemodynamics were investigated in 23 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. Gastroesophageal collateral blood flow was evaluated by the measurement of azygos venous blood flow by continuous thermal dilution. Azygos venous blood flow was markedly increased in these patients (544 +/- 48 ml per min, as compared with 132 +/- 18 ml per min in subjects without portal hypertension (p less than 0.001). Propranolol at doses achieving effective beta-blockage (83 +/- 5 mg) (mean +/- S.E.M.) markedly reduced azygos venous blood flow (to 354 +/- 34 ml per min, p less than 0.001). Reduction of azygos venous blood flow (-34.2 +/- 3.6%) was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than reductions in cardiac output (-22.6 +/- 1.9%), hepatic venous pressure gradient (-11.5 +/- 2.4%) and hepatic blood flow (-13.4 +/- 7.4%). The hemodynamic effects of propranolol were not related to plasma norepinephrine levels. Reduction of gastroesophageal collateral blood flow may be the mechanism by which oral propranolol therapy reduces the risk of repeated episodes of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension.", 
    "68": "Forty patients ASA physical status I-III were selected and divided into four groups. Group I, Control, received saline pretreatment five minutes prior to rapid sequence induction and intubation, while Groups II, III and IV received propranolol 0.01 mg X kg-1 IV two, five or eight minutes prior to induction and intubation. Measurements of heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (ABP) were recorded as baseline values and at one, two, five, eight and 20 minutes, and simultaneous venous samples were withdrawn for propranolol levels. Calculated rate pressure product (RPP) showed best haemodynamic control in Group III. Serum propranolol levels were under 5 ng X ml-1 in Group III and undetectable in Group IV. Our data show that the optimal time interval between IV propranolol administration and intubation was five minutes.", 
    "69": "The adrenoceptor-mediated responses in human skin (blanching and erythema) were studied by an iontophoretic technique. It is concluded that the receptors in superficial dermal blood vessels belong to the subclasses alpha 1 and beta 2.", 
    "70": "The clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics of 6 patients who had repetitive monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) after a remote myocardial infarction (group A) were compared with those of 22 patients who had this arrhythmia without structural heart disease (group B). VT had a right bundle branch block morphologic pattern in 5 of 6 group A patients and a left bundle branch block morphologic pattern in all group B patients. Endocardial catheter activation mapping was performed in 4 group A patients and in 9 group B patients during VT. In all group A patients, the site of VT origin was on the border of the previous infarction; in all group B patients VT originated at the right ventricular outflow tract. Pacing and programmed stimulation induced VT in 5 of 6 group A patients and 7 of 22 group B patients (p = 0.03). Isoproterenol infusion provoked VT in 4 group A patients and 9 group B patients. Type I antiarrhythmic agents suppressed VT in 4 group A patients and in 14 group B patients, whereas propranolol suppressed VT in 3 of 3 group A patients tested and in 12 of 20 group B patients. Verapamil suppressed spontaneous VT in 1 group A patient and in 4 group B patients. During a mean follow-up of 19 months for group A and 40 months for group B, no patient had died suddenly or had cardiac arrest.", 
    "71": "The effects of digoxin on sinus node and atrioventricular (AV) node function were studied in 18 patients (mean age 53.6 years) with normal intrinsic heart rates. Electrophysiologic testing was performed both during basal state and after autonomic blockade with propranolol and atropine. Full digitalization was achieved by intravenous administration of digoxin (0.02 mg/kg) given in three divided doses over a 24-hour period. The following day, after a basal recording, autonomic blockade was again induced and the study was repeated. During basal state, digoxin significantly prolonged the sinus cycle length (SCL) (p less than 0.01) and the AH interval (p less than 0.01). However, when the intrinsic sinus node functions were compared (i.e., the values obtained after autonomic blockade), digoxin did not produce significant changes in intrinsic SCL, corrected sinus node recovery time, and sinoatrial conduction time. No significant changes were noted even in the intrinsic AH interval and AV nodal refractory periods. These findings suggest that: (1) intravenous administration of digoxin in therapeutic doses does not produce any depression of the intrinsic functions of the sinus node and AV node; and (2) the depressant effects induced by digoxin during basal state appear to be mediated through the autonomic nervous system."
