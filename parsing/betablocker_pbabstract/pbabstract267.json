The absorption rate of latanoprost and timolol into the aqueous humor was similar after administration of the FC compared to the two drugs given separately. The aqueous humor concentration of the acid of latanoprost tended to be higher 1-4 hours after administration of FC compared to latanoprost monotherapy. This resulted in an increased AUC. The Tmax and elimination half-life of both latanoprost and timolol were similar after administration of either FC or the two drugs given as monotherapy. Latanoprost did not have any influence on the ocular pharmacokinetics of timolol. The bioavailability of latanoprost and timolol into human aqueous humor, after FC, was at least as good as for the two drugs administered separately.", 
    "1": "The purpose of this study was to compare the ocular hypotensive efficacy and tolerability of 0.5% timolol maleate ophthalmic gel-forming solution (timolol gel) and 0.5% levobunolol hydrochloride (levobunolol). This was a randomized, double-masked, multi-center, active-controlled, 2-period, crossover study. After a 3-week, single-masked placebo run-in phase, patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma and an intraocular pressure (IOP) > or = 22 mmHg were randomized to receive timolol gel QD or levobunolol BID for 6 weeks followed by a 3-week, placebo washout period. Patients were then crossed over to the alternate treatment for 6 weeks. IOP and heart rate (HR) were measured at 3 and 6 weeks after the start of therapy with either timolol gel or levobunolol. Of 133 patients randomized, 116 received both treatments. Timolol gel QD was comparable to levobunolol BID in reducing trough and peak IOP. At trough, HR was marginally increased with timolol gel and was decreased with levobunolol (p = < 0.001). At peak, HR was decreased with both treatments, but the decrease was significantly less with timolol gel than with levobunolol (p = 0.049). Significantly more patients experienced at least one adverse event (p = 0.024), adverse events related to special senses (p = 0.002), and burning and stinging (p < 0.001) with levobunolol compared to timolol gel. The study demonstrates that timolol gel QD has IOP-lowering effects comparable to those of levobunolol BID with fewer adverse experiences and less effect on HR.", 
    "2": "The density and distribution of beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors (betaAR) in porcine adipocytes, skeletal muscle, heart, lung, and liver were investigated using competitive displacement of ligand binding with subtype-selective ligands. Three experimental approaches were used to estimate the distribution of betaAR subtypes in adipocytes. Two approaches involved simultaneous linear regression analysis of multiple competitive displacement curves with the beta1AR-selective antagonist CGP 20712A and the beta2AR-selective ligand BRL 37344. For the third approach, radioligand saturation assays were perfomed using a concentration of CGP 20712A that completely blocked the beta1AR. All three approaches indicated the presence of multiple betaAR subtypes in porcine adipocytes and gave similar estimates for the proportion of these subtypes. Saturation assays in the presence of the beta1AR blocker CGP 20712A were conducted to determine the distribution of the betaAR subtypes in skeletal muscle, heart, lung, and liver. The proportions of the beta1AR and beta2AR were 81:19, 59:41, 72:28, 58:42, and 50:50 for adipose, skeletal muscle, heart, lung, and liver, respectively. These estimates based on receptor protein were consistent with published estimates of mRNA abundance in pig tissues but differ from estimates for other species. The predominance of beta1AR in adipocytes and skeletal muscle may contribute to the reduced efficacy of select betaAR agonists in pigs compared to other species because most of the ligands evaluated in growth studies are purported to be beta2AR selective. The density of the betaAR varied among tissues in the following order: heart = lung > adipocytes > skeletal muscle or = liver.",

Five-year coronal caries incidence was 66.9%. The adjusted coronal caries increment (AdjCI) was higher among males and among those taking a beta-blocker or an antiasthma drug for the previous 5 years. The 5-year incidence of root surface caries was 59.3%. A lower root surface AdjCI was associated with taking daily aspirin. Of the medications shown in earlier analyses to predict dry mouth, only the antiasthma drugs were associated with higher caries experience, and they had predicted more severe xerostomia symptoms.", 
    "6": "This study offers no strong evidence for a medication-caries relationship, as only one of the observed medication-caries associations was explicable in terms of the theoretical model. However, it should be acknowledged that older people taking antiasthma drugs may be at higher risk of coronal caries, possibly through measures taken for the symptomatic relief of dry mouth.",

The electrophoretic separation was performed on a 78 cm x 75 microm I.D. fused-silica capillary (effective capillary length: 70 cm). The electrolyte consisted of a Na2B4O7-H3BO3 (50 mM), pH 9. The introduction of the sample was made hydrostatically for 20 s and the running voltage 25 kV at the injector end of the capillary. Photometric detection was used at a wavelength of 229 nm for oxprenolol and 280 nm for timolol. Under these conditions oxprenolol migrated at 4.76+/-0.05 min and timolol at 4.97+/-0.05 min. The solid-phase extraction methods were optimised for each beta-blocker and provided recoveries of 72.8% for timolol and 94.52% for oxprenolol. Good resolution from the endogenous compounds present in the urine matrix were achieved for both compounds. The method was applied to the determination of both beta-blockers in pharmaceutical formulations and urine samples obtained from hypertensive patients after the ingestion of a therapeutic dose (in a 24-h time interval after the ingestion). The quantitative results were compared with results previously obtained at our laboratories by HPLC and were found to be in good agreement. Good reproducibility, linearity, accuracy and quantitation limits (in urine) of 0.19 microg/ml for timolol and 0.20 microg/ml for oxprenolol were obtained, allowing the method to be applied to pharmacokinetic studies of these compounds.", 
    "13": "To assess the role of insulin in ventricular repolarization in patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), an oral glucose tolerance (OGT) test was performed in 11 patients with LQTS and in 11 control cases without QT prolongation. Plasma glucose, potassium level and the immunoreactive insulin concentration (IRI) were measured, and the QT interval and T wave morphology on 12-lead ECG were analyzed during fasting and after glucose load. The LQTS group had a higher incidence of changes in T wave morphology, such as biphasic, bifid or notched T wave, after glucose load than the control group (11 of 11 patients [100%] vs 0 of 11 [0%]; p<0.00001). The T wave changes returned to baseline at 180 min after glucose load in 7 patients. The maximal QT interval and QT dispersion increased significantly and returned to baseline level in response to IRI after glucose load in LQTS, whereas the QT interval was unaffected in the control group. After glucose load, ventricular arrhythmias and T wave alternans were observed in 3 and 1 patients with LQTS, respectively, but none in the control group. The findings suggest that glucose-induced insulin secretion plays a role in inducing abnormalities and inhomogeneity of ventricular repolarization in patients with LQTS.",

Both studies used an extemporaneously compounded formulation prepared from sotalol HCl tablets. In the PK study, following a single dose of 30 mg/m2 sotalol, extensive blood samples (n = 10) were taken. The PK-PD study used a dose escalation design with doses of 10, 30, and 70 mg/m2, each administered three times at 8-hr intervals without a washout. Six ECG recordings for determination of QT and RR were obtained prior to the initial dose of sotalol. Four blood samples were collected six ECG's were determined during the third interval at each dose level. Plasma concentrations of sotalol (C) were assayed by LC/MS/MS. The data analysis used NONMEM to obtain the population PK and PD parameter estimates. The individual PK and PD parameters were estimated with empirical Bayes methodology.",

Oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of central compartment (Vc/F) were linearly correlated with body surface area (BSA), body weight or age. CL/F was also linearly correlated with creatinine clearance. The best predictor for both CL/F and Vc/F was BSA. The remaining intersubject coefficients of variation (CV's) in CL/F, and Vc/F were 21.6% and 20.3%, respectively. The relationship of QTc to C was adequately described by a linear model. The intersubject CV's in slope (SL) and intercept (E0) were 56.2 and 4.7%, respectively.

    "19": "Acute ethanol intoxication increased triacylglycerides (TAG) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in liver and promoted the liberation of epinephrine. Four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)--aspirin, naproxen, nimesulide and piroxicam--prevented this increase in TAG and TBARS. Because fatty acids provided by adipose tissue contribute substantially to elevated hepatic TAG in ethanol-intoxicated rats, it was thought that the NSAIDs might reduce epinephrine-stimulated lipolysis in these rats. Isolated rat adipocytes were activated with epinephrine in the presence or absence of the NSAIDs. The NSAIDs inhibited epinephrine-stimulated lipolysis. These drugs did not modify the binding of dihydroalprenolol (beta-adrenergic agonist) to their receptors in isolated guinea-pig liver membranes. The NSAIDs, at concentrations 3,000-fold lower than that of cAMP, inhibited stimulated lipolysis by this messenger. In conclusion, aspirin, naproxen, nimesulide and piroxicam reduce the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue to the liver by inhibiting the epinephrine-stimulated lipolysis, and this, in part, explains the protective action of these NSAIDs against hepatic signs of acute ethanol intoxication.", 
    "20": "The objective of this study was to determine the responsiveness, affinity constants and beta-adrenoceptor reserves for isoprenaline on the isolated aorta in the maturation of normotensive and hypertensive rats. The effects of a very slowly reversible antagonist, bromoacetylal-prenololmenthane (BAAM), on the relaxant responses of the aortae of 5- and 14-week-old Wistar Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) to isoprenaline were determined. Five-week-old SHRs are pre-hypertensive and the aortic rings are less responsive to isoprenalinethan age-matched WKY (pD2 values: WKY, 8.40; SHRs, 8.03). Similar relaxant responses to forskol in were obtained on the aortae of 5- and 14-week-old WKY and SHRs. The K(A) value for isoprenaline at the aortic beta2-adrenoceptors of the 5-week-old WKY was 2.1 x 10(-7) M, and similar values were obtained on the aortae of 5-week-old SHR and 14-week-old WKY and SHRs. In the maturation of the WKY aortae from 5 to 14 weeks, there was a reduction in the maximum response, a major loss of sensitivity and a loss of beta2-adrenoceptor reserve for isoprenaline. On 5-week-old SHR aorta, the sensitivity to isoprenaline was 2.5-fold lower, and the beta2-adrenoceptor reserve was less than on age-matched WKY. In the development of hypertension on the SHR aorta from 5 to 14 weeks, there was a reduction in the maximum response to isoprenaline. At 14 weeks, the sensitivity and the beta-adrenoceptor reserve to isoprenaline were similar, but the maximum responses were lower on the SHR than WKY. As there are differences in pre-hypertensive SHR and age-matched WKY aortic responses to isoprenaline, it is no longer valid to consider that the loss of responsiveness to isoprenaline in hypertension is solely owing to the hypertension. There are no changes in affinity, but major changes in the sensitivity, maximum responses and aortic beta2-adrenoceptor reserves to isoprenaline in the maturation of normotensive and pre-hypertensive aortae.",

The data covered cardiovascular risk factors, the main clinical parameters, the results of biological tests and investigations carried out for risk stratification, plus different elements of therapeutic management. Compared with previous studies of the same type, this enquiry showed a favourable tendency towards the prescription of antithrombotic drugs and betablockers (98.3% and 82.4% of patients, respectively), and to patients with reputedly normal blood pressure values (84.7%). A positive result concerning the reduction in the number of smokers (17.4%) and the increase in lipid lowering prescriptions should be tempered by the fact that advice about stopping smoking was rarely given and that the quantitative target of LDL cholesterol was often ignored.

Queensland Rural Medical Support Agency's Quality Use of Medicines (QUM) Program aims to engage rural general practitioners (GPs) in the development of strategies to improve health outcomes in relation to the quality use of medicines. The present paper describes the development of a tool to audit the management of heart failure in rural general practice and to encourage rural GPs to undertake such an audit as a method of continuing medical education. A self-administered retrospective clinical audit of heart failure patients was undertaken by rural and remote GPs. Fourteen doctors undertook the audit, providing data on 270 patient cases. Patient data collected include 30% not receiving adequate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor doses, 45% of patients who may benefit from a beta-blocker and 14% of patients taking a drug known to aggravate heart failure. The majority of participants would review a patient following the audit and 93% confirmed that the audit assisted them in identifying patients whose heart failure management could be enhanced. The clinical audit provided results and a commentary to allow GPs reflective educational opportunities through the dissemination of results and engagement with appropriate educational organisations (e.g. Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine) to inform the development of educational standards for personal development programs in QUM. Audits must be relevant and practical to meet the learning needs of GPs.",

Adrenaline evoked a reliable and potent increase in blood glucose levels when injected into the PVN; no glycemic change was observed after vehicle injections into the PVN or after adrenaline injections into the 3rd ventricle or hypothalamic structures adjacent to the PVN. Local pretreatment with propranolol, but not with phentolamine, abolished the adrenaline-induced hyperglycemia. The present results indicate that adrenergically mediated circuits into the avian PVN play an important role in central mechanisms of energy balance that may be equivalent to those observed in mammalian species.",

Heart failure is consequently becoming a major goal in pharmacological research. New approaches include converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and anti-aldosterones and have demonstrated that cardiac remodelling is, at least partly, a reversible process. This review aims to establish a strategy for therapeutic research which is based on the recent advances on the molecular mechanisms of cardiac remodelling, and also to evaluate some of the new developments which are presently in progress, including new inotropic drugs, new receptors or signals blockers, nitric oxide donors, metalloproteinases and apoptotic inhibitors. Our view is clearly evolutionary and several of our conclusions may contradict current opinions, such as those which consider hypertrophy a detrimental process, hormones as a primary cause of cardiac remodelling or inotropic interventions as beneficial.", 
    "41": "Recent trials have helped to clarify indications for the initial pharmacological therapy of hypertension. Both the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) and World Health Organization-international Society of Hypertension (WHO-ISH) recommendations should be revised. The more recent trials indicate that: (1) diuretics and beta-blockers appear to be as effective in reducing overall morbidity/ mortality as other agents (Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension [STOP-2], United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS], Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment [INSIGHT], Nordic diltiazem [NORDIL]); (2) the use of an a-blocker results in more cardiovascular events, especially congestive heart failure, when compared with a diuretic (Antihypertensive Therapy and Lipid Lowering Heart Attack Trial [ALLHAT]); (3)the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor results in fewer myocardial infarctions and episodes of heart failure than calcium channel blockers in the elderly and in diabetic patients (Fosinopril vs. Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial [FACET], Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes [ABCD], STOP-2) - other data (Captopril Prevention Project [CAPPP]) suggest that the use of an ACE inhibitor is preferred in diabetic patients; (4) overall cardiovascular events are similar with calcium channel blockers compared with a diuretic - however, there are fewer strokes with non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NORDIL) and a trend towards an increase in heart failure and myocardial infarctions with either a dihydropyridine or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers compared with a diuretic (INSIGHT, NORDIL); (5) angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) will decrease proteinuria and slow progression of renal disease in type 2 diabetic patients when compared with regimens that do not include an ARB or an ACE inhibitor (Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan [RENAAL], Irbesartan Type II Diabetic Nephropathy Trial [IDNT], Irbesartan Type II Diabetes with Microalbuminuria [IRMA Il]). The debate over initial therapy may be moot. High-risk hypertensive patients should probably be treated initially with combination therapy, one of which should be a diuretic. The use of diuretics and beta-blockers as well as ACE-inhibitors alone or with a diuretic should be considered as initial therapy (a change from JNCVI). Alpha-blockers should be reserved for special situations, i.e. prostatic hypertrophy (in contrast to WHO-ISH recommendations). An ACE-inhibitor or ARB, usually along with a diuretic, can be considered as preferred therapy in hypertensive diabetic patients. Some data suggest equal or greater reduction in strokes with a calcium channel blocker than other medications.",

Several international studies, using primarily diuretics and/or beta-blockers, have shown the benefits of antihypertensive treatment in elderly patients in terms of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality reduction. However, because the risk of side-effects is a major concern when treating the elderly, the use of low-dose combination treatments may be of particular interest. A randomized, multicentre, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of bisoprolol 2.5 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg (biso 2.5/HCTZ 6.25) (n = 84) versus amlodipine 5 mg (n = 80) in subjects over 60years of age with isolated systolic hypertension. The effects of these two treatment strategies on patients' quality of life were also assessed. After a two- to four-week placebo washout period, both drugs were administered once daily and taken for 12 weeks. Blood pressure was measured 24 h after treatment administration. Systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure changes from baseline to week 12 were similar for both biso 2.5/HCTZ6.25 and amlodipine (-20.0/-4.5 mmHg and -19.6/-2.4 mmHg, respectively). Overall adverse events for biso 2.5/HCTZ 6.25 and amlodipine were 39% and 40%, respectively. Both treatments improved quality of life scores in the same way. This study demonstrates comparable efficacy and tolerability of biso 2.5/HCTZ 6.25 and amlodipine.

Therefore, the postoperative management of patients with complex congenital heart defects is directed at optimization of oxygen delivery to maintain end-organ function and promote wound healing. Traditionally, assessment of circulation in the postoperative congenital heart patient has depended on indirect assessment of CO using parameters such as blood pressure, pulses, capillary refill, and urine output. Because of the limitations of indirect and observer-dependent assessment of CO, we rely on objective measures of tissue oxygen levels for the complex postoperative patient. We have found that continuous monitoring of the mixed venous saturation (SvO2) allows for identification of acute changes in systemic oxygen delivery and frequently precedes other indicators of decreased CO. The postoperative patient can be expected to have a period of decreasing CO, and the need for intervention should be anticipated because critical low output syndrome will develop in a subset of patients. Strategies for postoperative care are developed based on the diagnosis and procedure, but optimizing SvO2 is a consistent goal. A uniform approach to airway maintenance, vascular access, and drug infusions, all universal concerns during the perioperative period, minimizes the potential for these predictable and necessary interventions to result in morbidity or mortality. Management of the postoperative single ventricle patient targets stabilization of the systemic vascular resistance through the use of vasodilators to improve systemic perfusion and simplify ventilator management. Management of any individual patient should be driven by objective analysis of available data and must include efforts to re-evaluate the treatment plan as well as to identify unanticipated problems.", 
    "45": "Cyclosporine A (CsA) is an immunosuppressive agent, which also causes hypertension. The effect of CsA on vascular responses was determined in Sprague-Dawley rats and rat aortic rings. Male rats weighing 250-300 g were given either CsA (25 mg/kg/day) in olive oil or vehicle by intraperitoneal (ip) injection for 7 days. CsA administration produced a 42% increase (P < 0.001) in mean arterial pressure (MAP) which reached a plateau after 3 days. The level of both nitrate/nitrite (NO2/NO3), metabolites of nitric oxide (NO), decreased by 50% (P < 0.001), but the level of thromboxane A2 (TBXA2) increased by 75% (P < 0.001), in the urine. When 10(-9) M of CsAwas added acutely to intact aortic rings from untreated rats, NO2/NO3 production decreased by 83% (P < 0.011), but TBXA2 production increased by 86% (P < 0.001). The effects of CsA were reversed both in vivo and in vitro by pretreatment with propranolol (15 mg/kg/day ip), beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. There were no changes in MAP and tension in rats treated with prop alone. In addition, in aorta of rats that were treated with CsA ip for 7 days, CsA significantly activated protein kinase C (PKC) translocation. This suggests that PKC mediate, in part, CsA-induced hypertension. In summary, CsA inhibits endothelial NO formation, activate PKC, and increaseTBXA2 production, with resulting increase in MAP, and this changes can be overcome by pretreatment with propranolol.", 
    "46": "To evaluate the efficacy of carvedilol for left ventricular dysfunction in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), we enrolled 8 patients with DMD who had elevated plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and a low ejection fraction (EF < 40%) in echocardiography. Written informed consent was obtained from all of them. Four agreed to be treated with oral carvedilol 0.3125-1.25 mg/day (10.1-40.3 micrograms/kg/day) for 6 months (treated group). The others served as the controls (untreated group). In both groups, we evaluated clinical symptoms, plasma ANP, BNP and EF before, 3 and 6 months after the trial, and iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging at 6 month interval. Parameters in the treated and untreated groups before respectively were ANP, 83.8 +/- 17.5 and 89.5 +/- 44.4 pg/ml (mean +/- SEM); BNP, 169.0 +/- 46.2 and 186.3 +/- 61.8 pg/ml; EF, 24.0 +/- 2.2 and 16.5 +/- 1.9%; Heart/Mediastrinum ratio of the 123I-MIBG delayed image, 1.65 +/- 0.08 and 1.6 +/- 0.10; and Washout rate, 46.5 +/- 8.6 and 41.4 +/- 7.8. These values did not change significantly before and 6 months after for either group. Clinical symptoms also did not change in either group.

On neurological examination, there was no abnormal finding except the lip tremor. Results of laboratory findings were all within normal levels. Her MRI and EEG were normal. Surface EMG studies revealed that regular grouped discharges at a frequency of about 4-5 Hz appeared in the orbicularis oris muscle only during voluntary speaking. The tremor was not observed under conditions of a purposeless phonation or a vocalization of a simple word, suggesting that the tremor was not a vocal tremor but a task-specific tremor related to speaking. Administration of a beta-blocker and consumption of small amount of alcohol could effectively improve the tremor, possibly suggesting that this type of tremor might be a clinical variant of essential tremor.", 
    "48": "There is still no reliable method of preventing or treating chronic rejection or transplant vascular sclerosis. A recent in vitro cell culture study showed that carvedilol significantly inhibited the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); however, the effect of carvedilol in the presence of cyclosporine (CsA) has not yet been reported. Using in vitro cultured VSMCs, we measured the antiproliferative activity of carvedilol alone and in combination with CsA.",

Carvedilol significantly inhibited the activity of VSMCs stimulated by ET-1 and ANG-II. The IC50 of carvedilol was 1-10 microM. CsA only inhibited VSMCs significantly in the PDGF-stimulated subgroup. The addition of CsA in the presence of carvedilol did not affect the inhibitory activity of carvedilol. The pattern of inhibition in the combined group was uniform and similar to that of the carvedilol alone group, regardless of the stimulator used.",

Tilt table testing revealed that the patient lost consciousness without hypotension. Doppler flow measurements of the middle cerebral arteries showed a significant decrease in diastolic velocity during syncope without systemic hypotension. Treatment with beta-blockers was highly effective. The patient suffered from cerebral blood flow disregulation probably due to abnormal baroreceptor responses triggered during orthostatic stress. This is the first reported case of a patient with spinal cord injury suffering from such an unusual cause of syncope.",

The new RAM material was prepared by the modification of the external surface of porous silica with hydrophilic methylcellulose (MC), followed by modification of the internal surface with octadecylsilane (ODS). The external surface of the MC-immobilized ODS silica material (MC-ODS) suppressed the adsorption of proteins, while the internal surface of MC-ODS retained various types of drugs, such as ketoprofen, propranolol, caffeine and atenolol in plasma samples. In addition, MC-ODS allowed direct analysis of drugs in a 1000-microL plasma sample to monitor trace amounts of analytes contained. Reduced efficiency and clogging of the MC-ODS precolumn and/or the analytical column were not observed even after the repetitive injection of plasma sample up to 40 mL. Our results indicated that the MC-ODS precolumn could be used in pharmacodynamic and clinical studies.", 
    "55": "The aim of the present study was to establish the effect of intravenous administration of indomethacin (10 mg/kg), potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, on hemodynamic parametrs after intravenous administration of propranolol (0.3 mg/kg) and enalaprilat (0.5 mg/kg) in rabbits. The following parameters were estimated: mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. Blood pressure was measured directly in the carotid artery, heart rate was counted according to ECG, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were calculated using the method of human 125J albumin dilution. For statistical analysis, the average change in the examined parametres was calculated. Indomethacin significantly increased mean arterial pressure without altering other hemodynamic parameters. Combined intravenous administration of indomethacin with enalaprilat or propranolol abolished hypotensive effect of both drugs. Indomethacin magnified the effect of propranolol on total peripheral resistance and abolished the effect of enalaprilat on this parameter. Co-administration of indomethacin with propranolol or enalaprilat did not influence significantly heart rate and cardiac output in comparison with the effect of both antihypertensive drugs alone. This may indicate the predominant role of the influence of indomethacin on vascular tone in the observed interaction.", 
    "56": "An immunohistochemical examination of cultured corpus cavernosum cells of the rabbit showed that they were composed of many smooth muscle cells retaining -smooth muscle actin and a few of endothelial cells. Application of noradrenaline (NA, 0.5-100 microM) to the culture dose-dependently increased cytosolic concentrations of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in smooth muscle cells. The NA (10 microM)-induced [Ca2+]i increase was dose-dependently inhibited by phenoxybenzamine (1 nM-1 microM). The inhibition was 71% at 0.1 microM and was completely made at 1 microM. An alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.1 microM), inhibited the [Ca2+]i response by 42%, and propranolol (1 microM) enhanced the response by 118%. These adrenoceptor antagonists showed almost the same effects on a contractile response of corporal tissue strips to NA (10 microM) as the effects on the [Ca2+]i response. Our results suggest that NA-induced [Ca2+]i increase was mixed with a large increase through 1-adrenoceptors and a small decrease through beta-adrenoceptors. The increased [Ca2+]i could play a role of intracellular messenger for leading to contraction of cavernosal smooth muscle cells.", 
    "57": "Evaluating predictors of appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) may be helpful in developing risk stratification strategies for these patients. Fifty-four patients with IDC underwent ICD implantation and were followed up. Twenty-three patients (42%) had a class I indication for ICD implantation; the remaining patients underwent implantation for multiple risk factors for sudden death including left ventricular dysfunction, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, syncope, or positive electrophysiologic study results. Clinical, electrocardiographic, and electrophysiologic data were collected. Appropriate ICD therapy was defined as an antitachycardia pacing therapy or shock for tachyarrhythmia determined to be either ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Appropriate ICD therapy was observed in 23 patients (42%). There was a significant difference in use of beta-blocker therapy between patients who did and did not have appropriate ICD therapy (p <0.0003). Cox regression analysis identified the following univariate predictors (p <0.1): class I indication (p <0.005) and lack of use of beta-blocker therapy (p <0.0007). In multivariate analysis, only lack of beta-blocker use (relative risk 0.15, 95% confidence intervals 0.05 to 0.45; p <0.0007) was identified as a predictor of appropriate ICD therapy. Of the patients who received ICD therapy, only 4 (17%) were taking beta blockers, whereas 21 of the 31 patients (68%) who did not receive ICD therapy were treated with beta blockers (p <0.0003). In patients with IDC selected for ICD implantation, the most consistent predictor of appropriate ICD therapy was lack of beta-blocker use. Attempts should be made to administer beta blockers to these patients, if tolerated.",

Calcium antagonists with slow starting effect and long duration of action are the choice for use in long-term antihypertensive treatment. This group of drugs is specially indicated in elderly patients, in those with diabetes mellitus and in patients with coronary heart disease.

    "87": "Malnutrition is a frequent complication of cirrhosis, and many studies have demonstrated the adverse influence of malnutrition on clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis. The coexisting complications of fluid overload and ascites may mask the severity of malnutrition, particularly in the early stages of its development. During periods of decompensation, protein and energy requirements are higher, and many patients have inadequate nutritional intake at these times. Further, protein supplementation should not be restricted ad hoc in cirrhotic patients, as for the vast majority of patients dietary protein does not precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. The impairment of hepatic glycogen storage in cirrhotic patients effects a state of accelerated starvation with catabolism of fat and protein to provide substrates for gluconeogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of nocturnal nutritional supplements in improving nitrogen balance. Resistance to the actions of the anabolic growth factors insulin and growth hormone (GH) is common in cirrhosis, and recent studies have shown that GH resistance, in particular, may be overcome with exogenous GH therapy. Hypermetabolism may be observed in up to one-third of cirrhotic patients. The recent exciting observation that beta-blocker therapy can decrease energy expenditure and catecholamine levels in these patients indicates the need for further intervention studies of beta-blockers as metabolic therapy in cirrhosis.",

    "98": "The effects of isoflurane (1 and 2 rat minimum alveolar concentration [MAC]) on the baroreflex control of HR were determined in sham intact and midcollicular-transected decerebrate rats. Intravenous phenylephrine (0.2-12 microg/kg) and nitroprusside (1-60 microg/kg) were used to measure HR responses to peak changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Sigmoidal logistic curve fits to HR-MAP data assessed baroreflex sensitivity (HR/MAP), HR range, lower and upper HR plateau, and MAP at half the HR range (BP50). Four groups (two brain intact and two decerebrate) were studied before, during, and after isoflurane. To assess sympathetic and vagal contributions to HR baroreflex, beta-adrenoceptor (1 mg/kg atenolol) or muscarinic (0.5 mg/kg methyl atropine) antagonists were administered systemically.", 
    "99": "Decerebration did not alter resting MAP and HR or baroreflex parameters. Isoflurane depressed baroreflex slope and HR range in brain-intact and decerebrate rats. In both groups, 1 MAC reduced HR range by depressing peak reflex tachycardia. Maximal reflex bradycardia during increases in blood pressure was relatively preserved. Atenolol during 1 MAC did not alter maximum reflex tachycardia. In contrast, atropine during 1 MAC fully blocked reflex bradycardia. Therefore, 1 MAC predominantly depresses sympathetic components of HR baroreflex. Isoflurane at 2 MAC depressed both HR plateaus and decreased BP50 in both groups.",

After 3 days, a flash electroretinogram (ERG) was recorded, and the retina processed for the localization of certain antigens. In the rat, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) was injected intravitreally, and 8 days later, the retinas were analyzed for the localization of Thy-1 or the relative amounts of mRNAs for antigens located to ganglion cells or photoreceptors. Rats and rabbits received topical flunarizine or vehicle before and after ischemia or NMDA. IOP was measured in rabbits after a single topical application of 2% flunarizine.

Similarly, NMDA induced reductions in Thy-1 immunoreactivity and mRNA for rat ganglion cell antigens (Thy-1 and neurofilament light form) were counteracted by topical application of flunarizine. Topical application of 2% flunarizine significantly lowered the IOP in rabbits over a period of 5 hours. Flunarizine was more effective than betaxolol and much stronger than nifedipine at attenuating veratridine-induced influx of sodium into synaptosomes. Nifedipine, flunarizine, and betaxolol all reduced the NMDA-induced influx of calcium into the isolated retina or cortical neurons, but betaxolol was the least effective.",

Apart from prognostic clinical effects in the treatment of patients with coronary heart disease, several in vivo and ex vivo studies have demonstrated antiproliferative and antiatherogenic effects of beta-blockers. In the present study, 192 male patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to metoprolol sustained-release treatment or placebo starting at least 1 day before angioplasty. Lesion diameters and restenosis rates were evaluated using automatic edge detection systems. The study endpoint was the angiographic restenosis rate 4 months after PTCA. Ninety-seven randomized patients had a control angiography a mean of 4.5 months after PTCA. Dropouts were evenly distributed between the metoprolol and placebo groups. Lumen loss in the target lesion was 0.36 mm in the metoprolol group and 0.32 mm in the placebo group. Restenosis rates averaged 57.5% in the metoprolol group and 44.2% in the placebo group using conventional restenosis criteria. Taking metoprolol serum levels above 50 mmol/l as an indication of definite compliance with the metoprolol treatment, the restenosis rate was 58.3%. In conclusion, 95 mg of sustained-release metoprolol failed to reduce the restenosis rate following angioplasty in native coronary arteries.",

For this purpose, dogs underwent surgery >16 days before experiments, at which time flow probes were implanted and silastic catheters were inserted. During experiments, glucagon and insulin were fixed at basal levels during rest and exercise using a pancreatic clamp with glucose clamped (PC/GC; n = 5), a pancreatic clamp with glucose unclamped (PC; n = 7), or a pancreatic clamp with glucose unclamped + intraportal propranolol and phentolamine hepatic alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (PC/HAB; n = 6). Glucose production (R(a)) was measured isotopically. Plasma glucose was constant in PC/GC, but fell from basal to exercise in PC and PC/HAB. R(a) was unchanged with exercise in PC/GC, but was slightly increased during exercise in PC and PC/HAB. Despite minimal increases in epinephrine in PC/GC, epinephrine increased approximately sixfold in PC and PC/HAB during exercise. In summary, during moderate exercise, 1) the increase in R(a) is absent in PC/GC; 2) only a moderate fall in arterial glucose occurs in PC, due to a compensatory increase in R(a); and 3) the increase in R(a) is preserved in PC/HAB. In conclusion, stimulation of R(a) by a mechanism independent of pancreatic hormones and hepatic adrenergic stimulation is a primary defense against overt hypoglycemia.",

    "122": "Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is thought to play a crucial role in cell differentiation. Small gap junction plaques are frequently associated with tight junction strands in hepatocytes, suggesting that gap junctions may be closely related to the role of tight junctions in the establishment of cell polarity. To examine the exact role of gap junctions in regulating tight junctions, we transfected connexin 32 (Cx32), Cx26, or Cx43 cDNAs into immortalized mouse hepatocytes derived from Cx32-deficient mice and examined the expression and function of the endogenous tight junction molecules. In transient wild-type Cx32 transfectants, immunocytochemistry revealed that endogenous occludin was in part localized at cell borders, where it was colocalized with Cx32, whereas neither was detected in parental cells. In Cx32 null hepatocytes transfected with Cx32 truncated at position 220 (R220stop), wild-type Cx26, or wild-type Cx43 cDNAs, occludin was not detected at cell borders. In stable wild-type Cx32 transfectants, occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 mRNAs and proteins were significantly increased compared to parental cells and all of the proteins were colocalized with Cx32 at cell borders. Treatment with a GJIC blocker, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, resulted in decreases of occludin and claudin-1 at cell borders in the stable transfectants. The induction of tight junction proteins in the stable transfectants was accompanied by an increase in both fence and barrier functions of tight junctions. Furthermore, in the stable transfectants, circumferencial actin filaments were also increased without a change of actin protein. These results indicate that Cx32 formation and/or Cx32-mediated intercellular communication may participate in the formation of functional tight junctions and actin organization.", 
    "123": "Many in vitro data on physicochemical properties and specific absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) processes are already available at early stages of drug discovery. These data about new drug candidates could be integrated/connected in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to estimate a priori the overall plasma and tissue kinetic behaviors under in vivo conditions. The objective of the present study was to illustrate that generic PBPK models integrating such data can be developed in drug discovery prior to any in vivo studies. This approach was illustrated with three example compounds, including two lipophilic bases (diazepam, propranolol) and one neutral more hydrophilic drug (ethoxybenzamide). Distribution and liver metabolism were the processes integrated in the generic rat PBPK models of disposition. Tissue:plasma partition coefficients (P(t:p)s) used for description of distribution were estimated from established tissue composition-based equations, which need only in vitro data on drug lipophilicity and plasma protein binding as sole input parameters. Furthermore, data on intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) determined in vitro with hepatocytes were scaled to the in vivo situation to estimate hepatic metabolic clearance. These prediction approaches were both incorporated in the PBPK models to enable automated estimation of distribution and liver metabolism for each drug studied. The generic PBPK models suggested can simulate a priori concentration-time profiles of plasma and several tissues after intravenous administrations to rat. The results indicate that most of the simulated concentration-time profiles of plasma and 10 tissues are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental data determined in vivo (less than a factor of two). However, some more relevant deviations were observed for specific tissues (brain and gut for diazepam; liver and gut for ethoxybenzamide; lung for propranolol) because of important ADME processes were probably neglected in the PBPK models of these drugs. In this context, generic PBPK models were also used for mechanistic evaluations of pharmacokinetics for generating research hypotheses to understand these deviations. Overall, the present generic and integrative PBPK approach of drug disposition suggested as a tool for a priori simulations and mechanistic evaluations of pharmacokinetics has the potential to improve the selection and optimization of new drug candidates.", 
    "124": "In the present study, the density of cell surface beta-adrenergic receptors was determined in different skeletal muscles using the hydrophilic ligand [3H]CGP 12177. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors was highest in the slow-twitch soleus muscle (32.8+/-0.9 fmol mg dw(-1)) and lowest in the fast-twitch glycolytic white gastrocnemius (10.4+/-0.5 fmol mg dw(-1)) beta-Adrenoceptor density correlated closely with the percentage of type-I fibres (r=0.979; P<0.0001) and inversely with the percentage of type-IIB fibres (r=696; P<0.03). Incubation with isoprenaline (10 microM) for 30 min decreased the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cell surface from 32.9+/-0.8 to 19.3+/-0.7 fmol mg dw(-1) in the soleus and from 16.8+/-1.0 to 12.0+/-0.7 fmol mg dw(-1) in the epitrochlearis. Internalisation appeared rapid (half-time less than 5 min). To study externalisation of beta-adrenergic receptors, soleus strips were incubated 30 min with 10 microM isoprenaline and then transferred to buffer without agonist. The first incubation reduced the density to approximately 50%, the subsequent incubation without agonist increased cell surface receptor density to approximately 80% of the initial density after 1 h. No further increase was observed over the next 2 h, suggesting that some of the receptors had been degraded. Insulin or contractile activity did not influence rate of externalisation.", 
    "125": "The present study investigated the effects of mibefradil, a novel T-type channel blocker, on ventricular function and intracellular Ca(2+) handling in normal and hypertrophied rat myocardium. Ca(2+) transient was measured with the bioluminescent protein, aequorin. Mibefradil (2 microM) produced nonsignificant changes in isometric contraction and peak systolic intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in normal rat myocardium. Hypertrophied papillary muscles isolated from aortic-banded rats 10 weeks after operation demonstrated a prolonged duration of isometric contraction, as well as decreased amplitudes of developed tension and peak Ca(2+) transient compared with the sham-operated group. Additionally, diastolic [Ca(2+)](i) increased in hypertrophied rat myocardium. The positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol stimulation was blunted in hypertrophied muscles despite a large increase in Ca(2+) transient amplitude. Afterglimmers and corresponding aftercontractions were provoked with isoproterenol (10(-5) and 10(-4) M) stimulation in 4 out of 16 hypertrophied muscles, but were eliminated in the presence of mibefradil (2 microM). In addition, hypertrophied muscles in the presence of mibefradil had a significant improvement of contractile response to isoproterenol stimulation and a reduced diastolic [Ca(2+)](I), although a mild decrease of peak Ca(2+)-transient was also shown. However, verapamil (2 microM) did not restore the inotropic and Ca(2+) modulating effects of isoproterenol in hypertrophied myocardium. Mibefradil partly restores the positive inotropic response to beta-adrenergic stimulation in hypertrophied myocardium from aortic-banded rats, an effect that might be useful in hypertrophied myocardium with impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis.", 
    "126": "To investigate the influence of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (AHM) and 4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropoxy)-phenylacetic acid (ACMB), both derived from its first pass metabolism of metoprolol, an in vitro in vivo correlation incorporating first pass metabolite data for metoprolol extended release formulations was developed. Three different releasing formulations (slow (S), moderate (M) and fast (F), 100 mg) of metoprolol were evaluated in a previously reported clinical study. The non-first pass effect (Non-FPE) in vitro in vivo correlation (IVIVC) was developed using a fraction of metoprolol dissolved and a fraction of total drug (metoprolol + metabolites) as the absorption data for various combinations of formulations (S/M/F, M/F, S/M, and S/F). Direct convolution approaches predicting metoprolol concentrations and indirect convolution predicting total drug concentrations (metoprolol + metabolites) were used to determine in vivo behavior. The Non-FPE IVIVC using the S/M/F formulations displayed the strongest relationship (r2 > 0.92). The IVIVC using the indirect approach was predictive of both the C(max) (prediction errors (PE) 4.77, 3.94 and 6.14%) and AUC (10.7, 11.0 and 11.3%) for metoprolol, AHM and ACMB. Poor predictability (PE > 40% for C(max) and AUC) was observed for metoprolol when using the direct methods. The predictability of the IVIVC using the indirect approach as compared to the direct method displays the influence of first pass metabolism on the development and evaluation of an IVIVC for a drug that displays a high extraction ratio. In addition, the indirect IVIVC allows for not only predicting the in vivo performance of the parent drug but also the metabolites formed via the first pass effect.", 
    "127": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation is associated with significant morbidity, longer hospital stay, and higher related costs. Although the etiologic mechanism of postoperative atrial fibrillation and its optimum method of prophylaxis or management are not well defined, progress has been made during the past decade. This review focused on recent findings leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms and management of atrial fibrillation after surgery and current approaches directed at prevention of thromboembolic sequelae. Because postoperative atrial fibrillation is a frequent complication, preoperative risk assessment algorithms are being proposed to minimize the number of patients in whom an intervention to prevent atrial fibrillation is undertaken, and thus, reduce toxicity due to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Finally, current data suggest that once atrial fibrillation has occurred, a rate-control strategy during the first 8 to 12 hours is reasonable because 50% of those episodes will resolve during this period. Beyond this period, a more aggressive approach using class IC or III antiarrhythmic drugs will hopefully reduce the number of patients requiring anticoagulation and prolonged drug therapy.", 
    "128": "The prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation increase with age. Atrial fibrillation is associated with a higher incidence of coronary events, stroke, and mortality than sinus rhythm. A fast ventricular rate associated with atrial fibrillation may cause tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Management of atrial fibrillation includes treatment of underlying causes and precipitating factors. Immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed in persons with atrial fibrillation associated with acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem may be used to immediately slow a fast ventricular rate associated with atrial fibrillation. An oral beta-blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem should be given to persons with atrial fibrillation if a rapid ventricular rate occurs a rest or during exercise despite digoxin. Amiodarone may be used in selected persons with symptomatic life-threatening atrial fibrillation refractory to other drug therapy. Nondrug therapies should be performed in persons with symptomatic atrial fibrillation in whom a rapid ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drug therapy. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation associated with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome should be managed with a permanent pacemaker in combination with drugs. A permanent pacemaker should be implanted in persons with atrial fibrillation in whom symptoms such as dizziness or syncope associated with non-drug-induced ventricular pauses longer than 3 seconds develop. Elective direct-current cardioversion has a higher success rate and a lower incidence of cardiac adverse effects than medical cardioversion in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Unless transesophageal echocardiography shows no thrombus in the left atrial appendage before cardioversion, oral warfarin should be given for 3 weeks before elective direct-current or drug cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and continued for at least 4 weeks after maintenance of sinus rhythm. Many cardiologists prefer the treatment strategy of ventricular rate control plus warfarin rather than to maintain sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs, especially in older patients. Digoxin should not be used in persons with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Patients with chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who are at high risk for stroke should be treated with long-term warfarin to achieve an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. Persons with atrial fibrillation who are at low risk for stroke or who have contraindications to warfarin should receive 325 mg aspirin daily.",

Adult patients with a minimum of two claims with a valid congestive heart failure diagnosis from 1997 to 1999 were included. Patients receiving continuous carvedilol treatment for at least 4 months were considered study case patients. Case patients were matched based on age, gender, race, and concomitant medication. Healthcare use and costs were compared between the case and control groups. A total of 128 case and 147 control patients were identified. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics, concomitant medication, or New York Heart Association classification between these two groups. Analysis of variance and chi-square analyses were conducted for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Statistical adjustments were made using a multivariate model. Carvedilol had a significant economic reduction in the overall expenditures by approximately $14,530. Facility expenditures were approximately $9,000 lower for the carvedilol group than for the control group. Carvedilol-treated patients had less frequent hospital admissions and shorter lengths of stay compared with patients not receiving carvedilol. Congestive heart failure patients receiving carvedilol have significantly less healthcare use and costs than patients not receiving carvedilol.", 
    "130": "Glaucoma and ocular hypertension are highly prevalent conditions in individuals over the age of 40 and are commonly seen together in patients with cardiovascular disease. Many of the antiglaucoma medications, when systemically absorbed, affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems of patients and can cause cardiovascular toxicity. Such adverse effects are frequently associated with the long-term use of potentially toxic agents in elderly people, who are most prone to chronic eye disease. Moreover, patients may not associate their symptoms with the topical eye medications, and consequently may not report adverse drug effects. Drug-drug interactions can also occur when patients are taking medications for both cardiovascular disease and glaucoma. This review focuses on beta-adrenergic blockers as topical antiglaucoma medications and other topical antiglaucoma drugs. The systemic toxicity of these agents is reviewed, along with the possible drug interactions. Brief mention is also made of other antiglaucoma medications used alone and in combination with topical beta-blockers.", 
    "131": "Verapamil, the oldest calcium-channel blocker, is now being rediscovered and reevaluated in the light of new novel drug delivery systems and new evidence-based trials. Verapamil, a phenylalkylamine, is useful in the treatment of hypertension, stable angina, and narrow QRS supraventricular arrhythmias. This calcium antagonist is effective in both young and old, and both black and white hypertensive patients, and is free of metabolic side effects. Verapamil has a well-documented history as an effective antianginal agent when directly compared with a beta-blocker, and is more effective in reducing myocardial ischemia compared with amlodipine monotherapy. Because of the short half-life of verapamil, drug delivery systems are used to prolong the duration of action. Novel drug delivery systems using encapsulated beads or a modified osmotic pump have been designed to be taken at nighttime to provide maximal blood pressure reduction in the early morning hours and effective 24-hour blood pressure control, and to avoid excessive blood pressure reduction during sleep. The Verapamil in Hypertension and Atherosclerosis Study has documented equivalent effectiveness of verapamil compared with chlorthalidone, but showed superior plaque regression and reduced events in subjects with the greatest plaques with verapamil treatment. The Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm, comparing verapamil and metoprolol for stable angina, found no difference in total cardiovascular mortality or combined cardiovascular events. Other large ongoing randomized, multicenter trials, including Controlled-Onset Verapamil Investigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints and the International Verapamil-Trandolapril Study, will expand our knowledge of the role of verapamil in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "132": "Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful and independent predictor of an adverse prognosis in patients with heart disease and in the general population. The HRV is largely determined by vagally mediated beat to beat variability, conventionally known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Thus, HRV is primarily an indicator of cardiac vagal control. It is still unclear whether the relationship between measures of cardiac vagal control and mortality is causative or mere association. Possible mechanisms by which cardiac vagal activity might beneficially influence prognosis include a decrease in myocardial oxygen demand, a reduction in sympathetic activity and a decreased susceptibility of the ventricular myocardium to lethal arrhythmia. In animals, augmentation of cardiac vagal control by nerve stimulation or by drugs is associated with a reduction in sudden death in susceptible models. In humans a number of drugs which have been shown to reduce mortality and sudden death in large randomised trials can also be demonstrated to increase HRV. As a result of this evidence, it has been suggested that the effect of drugs or other therapeutic manoeuvres on HRV might be used to predict clinical efficacy. The use of HRV as a therapeutic target is discussed in this review.", 
    "133": "Clinical trials have shown that beta-blockers can produce symptomatic improvement and decrease the risk of death in chronic heart failure patients. However, the side effects of beta-blockers including worsening heart failure, AV-block, contracting peripheral vessels and unfavorable effects on glucose and cholesterol metabolism tend to make physicians hesitate to prescribe beta-blockers for elderly patients. Carvedilol is a novel non-selective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) and has vasodilating effect through blocking alpha 1 receptor. We examined the effects of carvedilol on cardiac parameters in order to clarify whether beta-blocker may affect left ventricular function in elderly Japanese patients with hypertension, angina pectoris, or both. We examined the hemodynamic effect of carvedilol in 16 patients with hypertension, angina patients or both, aged 65 and over (75.5 +/- 5.6 y.o.). After 12 weeks treatment with 10-20 mg daily oral administration, echocardiography was performed and hemodynamic parameters were calculated to evaluate their cardiac functions. Blood pressure was significantly decreased, especially in systolic pressure (163.8/87.6 +/- 15.6/11.2 mmHg to 141.6/76.9 +/- 16.6/11.7 mmHg, p < 0.001/p < 0.01, respectively). Ejection fraction increase (65.8 +/- 11.8% to 71.2 +/- 11.4%, p < 0.05) accompanied heart rate decrease (72.0 +/- 16.1 bpm to 63.9 +/- 11.4 bpm, p < 0.05). Carvedilol increased ejection fraction and decreased blood pressure safely in elderly patients with hypertension, angina pectoris, or both. Taking the condition of each patient into consideration, alpha-beta-blocker can be beneficial in elder patients.",

Gold standard in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding is the hemostasis by endoscopic ligation or sclerotherapy. Because of the very low complication rate variceal ligation is the therapy of choice in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. Especially in patients with preexisting portal hypertensive gastropathy an additional therapy with beta-blocker is recommended. In the prevention of first variceal bleeding a combination therapy with beta-blocker and nitrate is indicated in patients with big varices with red colour signs and in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (Child B).",

    "136": "We studied 102 eyes in 52 patients with intraocular pressure (IOP) higher than 21 mmHg, previously treated with a betablocker. Patients were divided in two groups. Treatment was changed on group 1 (51 eyes in 27 patients) to a timolol-dorzolamide association. Group 2 (51 eyes in 27 patients) changed treatment to latanoprost. After determination of previous IOP, readings were taken at 1, 3 and 8 months later.", 
    "137": "Both groups showed a decrease in IOP levels: Group 1, 5.6 mmHg and Group 2, 8.5 mmHg. Association between timolol and dorzolamide reached the highest hypotensive effect after the first month of treatment and remained constant during the rest of the study period. Latanoprost showed a maximal effect after the third month of treatment and maintained its effect all through the study as well. Latanoprost behaved similar to associated timolol-dorzolamide not showing significant differences during the first month of treatment. Significant differences appeared at third and eighth month favoring latanoprost (p<0.005 and p<0.001 respectively).", 
    "138": "There was a similarity in efficacy of both treatments. However, after the third month latanoprost became more effective than the timolol-dorzolamide association.", 
    "139": "The effects of 20-min ligations of the anterior branch of the left coronary artery were studied in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts with 92 microM D-sotalol added to the perfusate to induce long QT intervals and triggered arrhythmias. Epicardial electrograms, a left ventricular endocardial monophasic action potential, and simulated X and Y lead electrocardiograms were used to characterize ventricular conduction and recovery. In contrast to previous work showing that global ischemia eliminated triggered activity, coronary occlusion did not alter its mean incidence. Although the anatomic distribution of earliest sites of epicardial activation by triggered beats was altered, triggered beats still appeared on the epicardial surface in the nonperfused regions. Coronary occlusion had a small and variable effect on epicardial conduction velocity but caused a significantly greater percent shortening of epicardial activation-recovery intervals in the nonperfused region of hearts given D-sotalol than in control hearts. In hearts given D-sotalol, preconditioning significantly attenuated the shortening of epicardial activation-recovery intervals in response to coronary occlusion. However, preconditioning had no effect on the mean incidence of triggered activity during coronary occlusion. Thus, the persistence of triggered activity and the shortened myocardial recovery time associated with coronary occlusion could contribute to increasing the likelihood of occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Preconditioning by attenuating the shortening of recovery would be anti-arrhythmic.", 
    "140": "We investigated the effects of the beta1-beta2-alpha1-blocker, labetalol, in the congestive heart failure (CHF) model induced by aortic constriction in the guinea pig. One hundred days after aortic constriction, 52 animals were given either placebo, labetalol 2 mg/kg/d, or labetalol 20 mg/kg/d for 60 days. Eighteen sham-operated animals were used as controls. Investigations were performed at the end of the treatment period. Compared with sham-operated animals, banded animals receiving placebo showed signs of overt CHF with cardiac, systemic and regional (mesenteric and femoral) hemodynamic dysfunction, and pulmonary and hepatic congestion. An increase in whole heart, atria, and left and right ventricle weights associated with left ventricular cavity enlargement and left and right ventricular wall thickening indicated a remodeling process. Compared with placebo, labetalol did not significantly modify cardiac, systemic, or regional hemodynamic variables but significantly decreased pulmonary and hepatic congestion. Labetalol significantly reduced left ventricular cavity area (-10 and -20% after 2 and 20 mg/kg, respectively) and left ventricular (-4 and -16%) and right ventricular (-4 and -19%) wall thickness. In conclusion, labetalol induced partial regression of cardiac remodeling before hemodynamic improvement. This early anti-remodeling effect could play a role in the favorable effects observed with beta1-beta2-alpha1-blockers in humans.", 
    "141": "Pregnancy is associated with altered vascular reactivity. However, the effect of pregnancy on the alpha- and beta-adrenergic responses in the uterine microcirculation remains to be determined. In late-pregnant (Day 20-21, n = 6) and virgin (n = 6) Sprague-Dawley rats, uterine radial arterioles (70-120 microm in internal diameter) were isolated. We studied in vitro arteriolar responses in a pressurized, no-flow state with videomicroscopy. alpha(2)-Adrenergic activation relaxed uterine arterioles; this relaxation was increased with pregnancy and was inhibited after endothelial denudation or inhibition of nitric oxide synthase. Pregnancy significantly increased the contractile response to the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine but decreased the relaxation to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol. The contractile response to the protein kinase C activator phorbol ester and relaxation responses to both the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and the endothelium-independent cyclic guanosine monophosphate-mediated vaso- dilator nitroprusside were preserved. These results suggest that pregnancy enhances the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of uterine arterioles, probably because of an increase in the release of nitric oxide. The alpha(1)-adrenergic response is upregulated, whereas the beta-adrenergic response is impaired, in the uterine microcirculation of pregnant rats.",

    "143": "Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) increases cardiac output because of a reduction in blood viscosity and enhancement of left ventricular (LV) contractility. The status of LV function, especially LV diastolic function during ANH, remains controversial. We therefore examined LV systolic and diastolic function during ANH. Sixteen dogs were anesthetized with isoflurane in the absence (Group 1) and presence (Group 2) of beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol 1 mg/kg). LV contractility was quantified by the slope (M(w)) of the stroke work and end-diastolic volume relation. Diastolic function was evaluated with the time constant of LV relaxation (T), chamber stiffness constant (K(c)), peak LV diastolic filling rate during early filling (peak E) and atrial contraction (peak A), and ratio of peak E to peak A (E/A). Normovolemic exchange of blood (50 mL/kg) for 6% hydroxyethyl starch (ANH50) significantly increased M(w) in Group 1 but not in Group 2. In both groups, ANH50 significantly decreased T. ANH50 significantly increased peak E in both groups and peak A in Group 1, and it did not change the E/A ratio or K(c) in either group. ANH causes positive inotropic effects and enhances diastolic function without beta-blockade. Even after beta-adrenergic blockade, ANH improves diastolic function through the reduction of LV ejection impedance.",

    "149": "Characterization of the racemic species, which can be a racemic compound, a racemic conglomerate, or a pseudoracemate (solid solution), is a prerequisite for the design of crystallization resolution processes. It is useful to determine the solid/liquid equilibrium solubility of the enantiomer mixtures for crystallization operation. For the beta-blocker drug propranolol hydrochloride, Gibbs free energy of formation of racemic compound and entropy of mixing of the (R)- and (S)- enantiomers in the liquid state for racemic conglomerate were calculated. The structural differences between (R, S)-propranolol hydrochloride and its (S)-enantiomer were further investigated by powder X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, and solid-state NMR spectra. The solubility and metastable zone width of (R, S)- propranolol hydrochloride in a mixed solvent of methanol and acetone were determined by cooling crystallization over the temperature range 3.5-42.5 degrees C. The ternary solubility diagram of (R)-, (S)-propranolol hydrochloride was constructed using the same mixed solvent. The diagram will be useful as a guide for choosing crystallization operation conditions to produce pure enantiomers.", 
    "150": "The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of input rate on the stereoselective and nonstereoselective pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, and its acid metabolite. Extended release formulations (100 mg) of metoprolol with varying release rates (e.g., slow (S), moderate (M), and fast (F)) and an oral solution (OS, 50 mg) were administered to normal, healthy extensive metabolizers. Serial blood samples were collected over 48 h, plasma was obtained, and subsequently analyzed by a validated HPLC method with fluorescence detection. The mean T(max) of metoprolol after the S, M, F (4.43, 4.00, 3.14 h, respectively) was found to be different ( P < 0.05) as compared to the OS (2.07 h). The ratio of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol/metoprolol was higher for the OS (1.26) vs. the S, M, and F (1.02, 0.96, 0.99). The S/R enantiomer ratios of the concentration for metoprolol, ACMB, and alpha-hydroxmetoprolol were calculated at each time point and showed a significant difference ( P < 0.05) in the absorption phase (1-4 h) vs. terminal phase (8-16 h) for fast input (solution and fast extended release formulations). Based on these results, it would appear that input rate influences the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, its metabolites, and their enantiomers.", 
    "151": "In spontaneously hypertensive rats resistance artery structure, endothelial dysfunction and geometry-independent wall stiffness were reduced by an angiotensin AT(1)-receptor antagonist. In previous studies of human hypertension, interruption of the renin-angiotensin system corrected small artery structure and endothelial dysfunction, whereas the beta-blocker atenolol did not. We hypothesized that the AT(1)R antagonist losartan, but not the beta-blocker atenolol, would reduce stiffness of gluteal subcutaneous small arteries in essential hypertensive patients. Seventeen untreated mild essential hypertensive patients (47+/-2 years; 75% male) were randomly assigned in double-blind fashion to losartan or atenolol treatment for one year. Small, resistance size arteries were studied on pressurized myographs. Blood pressure (mmHg) was reduced (p<0.01) from 145 +/- 4/101 +/- 2 and 147 +/- 6/98 +/- 2 to 128 +/- 4/86 +/- 2 and 131 +/- 3/84 +/- 1 by losartan and atenolol, respectively. The media/lumen ratio of small arteries was unaffected by atenolol (8.3+/-0.3% before and 8.8+/-0.5% after treatment). In contrast, losartan reduced media/lumen ratio from 8.4+/-0.4% to 6.7+/-0.3% (p<0.01). Whereas isobaric elastic modulus was unaffected by either treatment, geometry-independent stiffness (slope of elastic modulus vs. stress) was reduced from 9.7+/-1.2 to 6.1+/-0.9 (P<0.05) under losartan treatment, but was unchanged by atenolol (8.2+/-1.3 to 7.8+/-0.6). In conclusion, treatment with losartan reduced stiffness and structural alterations of subcutaneous resistance arteries of previously untreated essential hypertensive patients, whereas atenolol failed to do so.",

However, HVPG reduction (percent) by carvedilol was not superior to that by propranolol either acutely (27.67 +/- 31.49 compared to 22.98 +/- 27.40, P = 0.6) or after 7 days (28.2 +/- 29.05 compared to 23.25 +/- 20.15, P = 0.6). With carvedilol, the acute HVPG response (P < 0.001) and responder status (P = 0.018) were good predictors of the response after 7 days, but were weak predictors in the case of propranolol (0.1 > P > 0.05 and P = 0.059, respectively).

Cases (n=29) were all using antidepressant drugs with a serum sodium concentration of < or = 130 mmol l(-1) while controls (n=78) were patients on antidepressants with a normal sodium concentration (136-144 mmol l(-1)). Information on blood sodium concentrations was obtained from clinical chemistry data while information on drug use was obtained from community and hospital pharmacy databases. Medical records were used to ascertain possible risk and confounding factors. Unconditional multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for hyponatraemia in patients on SSRIs compared with patients on other antidepressant drugs.",

    "160": "We report a patient in whom mapping of the right atrium with multipolar catheters and electroanatomic mapping revealed the presence of three dissimilar rhythms: a reentrant atrial tachycardia in the antero-lateral wall of the right atrium and an atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) isolated from each other and a conduction disturbance at the interatrial septum resulting in a rate-related interatrial block and a slow left atrial rhythm. The AVNRT was stopped with intravenous adenosine (6 mg) and induced repeatedly by atrial extrastimuli associated with a critical atrioventricular delay and dual atrioventricular nodal pathways. Electroanatomic mapping disclosed extensive fibrosis isolating viable myocardium of the antero-lateral wall from the rest of the right atrium. The viable myocardium in the antero-lateral wall was activated by a reentrant rhythm circulating around an islet of fibrosis located in the middle of the viable tissue. The AVNRT was ablated by a standard approach and the reentrant atrial tachycardia by producing a linear lesion bridging the central islet of fibrosis with the anterior tricuspid annulus. This case highlights the complicated nature of some dissimilar atrial rhythms and the power of electroanatomic mapping tools to reveal the exact mechanism and guide radiofrequency ablation.", 
    "161": "Previous studies have demonstrated a role for the beta-adrenergic system in the maturation of the fetal alveolar epithelium. Chronic blockade of beta-adrenergic binding sites has been shown to adversely effect physiologic and biochemical indices of fetal lung maturation. In the present study timed-pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a continuous 0.5 mg/hr dose of propranolol HCl, or saline, via an osmotic pump. The treatment periods were days 18-21, or 20-23 of gestation. Fetal body weights were obtained, and the morphology of the fetal lungs studied by light and electron microscopy. Cytoplasmic volume densities of lamellar inclusion bodies and glycogen within developing type II alveolar epithelial cells were also determined. In addition, total phospholipids (as phosphorus) and glycogen content were determined biochemically. The fetuses from females treated from day 20-23 demonstrated no differences between saline-treated and propranolol-treated groups, in either fetal weight or the morphologic appearance of the developing lung. In contrast, the fetuses from mothers treated from day 18-21 with propranolol were significantly smaller, and their lungs appeared less mature than saline-treated counterparts. The glycogen content of developing type II alveolar epithelial cells was significantly more abundant (as judged by stereologic and biochemical analyses) in the propranolol-treated fetuses. In addition, total phospholipids were decreased in the propranolol-treated 21-day fetuses. The results of the present study suggest that the development of the alveolar epithelium is sensitive to continuous beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol during a critical time late in gestation.",

The measurements were performed on a capillary viscosimeter.", 
    "164": "In both studies a protective effect of carvedilol was found, as the decrease of red blood cell suspension viscosity and K+ concentration in the supernatant indicated. Carvedilol significantly decreased the ischemia-reperfusion induced free radical production and the NAD+ catabolism and reversed the poly- and mono-ADP-ribosylation. Carvedilol also decreased the lipid peroxidation and membrane damages as determined by free malondialdehyde production and the release of intracellular enzymes. The self ADP-ribosylation of isolated PARP was also significantly inhibited by carvedilol.",

    "166": "The adrenergic system plays a major role in the regulation of the pregnant uterine contractility. Our aim was to develop an experimental animal model to study the role of the alpha 1A-adrenergic receptor (AR) in uterine motor activity by antisense oligonucleotides (AONs). AONs were injected with DOTAP and pluronic gel into the uterine lumen of post-partum rats 2-3 hours after delivery. The decrease of the alpha 1A-AR density by AON was demonstrated by RT-PCR method, Western blot analysis and radioligand binding assay on rat uterus preparations 24 h after delivery. The changes in the contractility of the uterus were measured on isolated rat uterine tissue by electric field stimulation (EFS). The EFS investigation demonstrated that the effect of the specific alpha 1A-blocker 5-methylurapidil and WB4101 was significantly decreased in the AON-treated rat uterus as compared to the control group but the effect of the beta-mimetic terbutalin and alpha 1D-antagonist BMY7378 was unchanged. Our result suggest that the alpha 1A-ARs play a very important role in the regulation of uterine contractility, and may serve as the basis for a subsequent new group of tocolytics (uterus selective alpha 1-antagonists), which may lead to more selective therapy than currently used beta-mimetics.", 
    "167": "Heart failure in blacks is a unique malady characterized by a different natural history, more worrisome prognosis, and potential variances in the response to current medical therapy for heart failure. The overwhelming burden of hypertension as a putative cause of left ventricular dysfunction identifies this illness. Although differences in the response to medical therapy have been described, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers remain the most appropriate therapy. Certain genetic polymorphisms may exist that explain the observed differences.", 
    "168": "Heart failure is not a simple defect in the pumping function of cardiac muscle, but rather a complex systemic inflammatory disease affecting many organ systems. Recognition of this fact has led to new therapeutic interventions such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, which have a significant impact on the quality of life and survival of patients with heart failure. During the course of heart failure, the steps involved in the activation of inflammation are now better understood. As a result, new therapies will develop that block, modify, or prevent these inflammatory changes, and supplement our armamentarium for providing better and longer lives for patients."
