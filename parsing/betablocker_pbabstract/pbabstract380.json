    "1": "Previous studies have shown that beta-adrenergic blocking agents when administered long term improve ventricular function in patients with heart failure. However, the time course of improvement in ventricular function and the long-term effects of beta-blockade on ventricular mass and geometry are not known.", 
    "2": "Twenty-six men with dilated cardiomyopathy underwent serial echocardiography on days 0 and 1 and months 1 and 3 of either metoprolol (n = 16) or standard therapy (n = 10). At 3 months all patients on standard therapy were crossed over to metoprolol, and late echocardiograms were obtained after 18 +/- 5 (mean +/- SD) months of metoprolol therapy. All echocardiograms were read in blinded manner.", 
    "3": "Patients treated with metoprolol had an initial decline (day 1 vs. day 0) in ventricular function (increase in end-systolic volume and decrease in ejection fraction). Ventricular function improved between months 1 and 3 (p = 0.013, metoprolol vs. standard therapy). Left ventricular mass regressed at 18 months (333 +/- 85 to 275 +/- 53 g, p = 0.011) but not at 3 months. Left ventricular shape became less spherical and assumed a more normal elliptical shape by 18 months (major/minor axis ratio 1.5 +/- 0.2 to 1.7 +/- 0.2, p = 0.0001).", 
    "4": "Patients with heart failure treated with metoprolol do not demonstrate an improvement in systolic performance until after 1 month of therapy and may have a mild reduction in function initially. Long-term therapy with metoprolol results in a reversal of maladaptive remodeling with reduction in left ventricular volumes, regression of left ventricular mass and improved ventricular geometry by 18 months.", 
    "5": "Cellular mechanisms underlying beta-adrenergic stimulation of the arrhythmogenic transient inward current (TI) were investigated by using a two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique in rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibers. TI induced by elevating [Ca2+]o to 30 mmol/L and substituting [Na+]o with N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMG) chloride had a distinct reversal potential (EREV) of -25 mV, suggesting that Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange was not the charge carrier for TI. In the absence of [Na+]o, isoproterenol (ISO, 0.01 to 5.0 mumol/L) had no effect on either inward or outward TI or on the current-voltage relation of TI. However, ISO (0.1 mumol/L) significantly increased both inward and outward TIs without affecting the EREV of TI, if [Na+]o was present. Pretreatment with propranolol (0.2 mumol/L) or atenolol (0.2 mumol/L) abolished the stimulatory effects of ISO. Addition of propranolol (0.2 to 0.5 mumol/L) after the effects of ISO had developed caused only partial reversal of TI stimulation. This indicates persistence of stimulatory effects downstream from the initial agonist-receptor interaction. Forskolin (1 mumol/L), a direct adenylate cyclase activator, also strongly increased both inward and outward TI in the presence of [Na+]o. These effects also were abolished when [Na+]o was substituted by NMG. Inward and outward TIs enhanced by either ISO or forskolin were reversed by two putative Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange blockers, dodecylamine (20 mumol/L) and quinacrine (20 mumol/L). These results suggest that beta-adrenergic stimulation of TI is mediated by the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange; stimulation likely involves phosphorylation of the exchanger or some factor that modulates exchanger activity.",

    "7": "We evaluated the effects of moderate hyperbarism (+60.75 kPa, i.e. 455 mmHg or 0.6 atm) and topical administration of 0.25% timolol maleate on oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) in this experimental model.", 
    "8": "OIR (including neovascularization in most cases) was observed in 100% of the retinas of normobaric oxygen-reared ratlings that did not receive timolol. OIR was less frequent in oxygen-reared ratlings treated with hyperbarism (60%) or timolol (65%). Hyperbaric oxygen supplementation combined with timolol treatment during both the hyperoxic and room-air phases reduced the incidence of OIR to 30%. There was no sign of vasoproliferation in any of the retinas from the latter three groups.", 
    "9": "The highly significant protective effects of hyperbarism and timolol observed in this study are not fully understood. We speculate that vasoconstriction induced by the hyperbarism reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches the retina from the choroid during O2 supplementation, while an increased ocular perfusion pressure caused by timolol-induced reduction of the intraocular pressure might decrease the stimulus to vasoproliferation that normally occurs with room-air recovery.", 
    "10": "The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of oral premedication with ketobemidone 5 mg, lorazepam 1 mg, propranolol 40 mg or placebo, given about an hour prior to anaesthesia, in a prospective randomized double-blind fashion. One hundred and twenty ASA I female patients scheduled for elective laparoscopy were randomly prescribed one of the study drugs. Patient evaluation of anxiety, nurse evaluation of premedication, induction and postoperative course were studied. Ninety-three of the 120 patients (78%) experienced no change or a decrease in anxiety, regardless of type of active drug or placebo administered. Eighty-eight of the patients (73%) were considered adequately premedicated by the nurse observer, with no differences between the groups. Pre induction pulse rate, blood pressure and amount of induction agent needed was also similar between the four groups of patients. No major differences could be seen during the postoperative course. We found no major effects of any of the active drugs studied compared to placebo. Routine use of small doses of oral premedication one hour before elective surgery among low anxiety patients could probably be omitted.", 
    "11": "Therapy of post-traumatic brain oedema often includes preservation of high arterial blood pressure to avoid secondary ischaemic injuries to the brain. This practice can be questioned since high arterial blood pressure may aggravate brain oedema through raised hydrostatic capillary pressure, causing fluid filtration across the damaged blood-brain barrier. This latter view is in agreement with our clinical experience and therefore hypotensive therapy with an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist (clonidine) and a beta 1-adrenergic antagonist (metoprolol) has become part of our treatment protocol for severely head injured patients to decrease the post-traumatic brain oedema. The present study is an attempt to analyse whether there are any direct local cerebrovascular effects of the hypotensive agents used, which also might influence intracranial pressure. Severely head injured patients were investigated. Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, cerebral blood flow and arteriovenous difference in oxygen content were measured before and after a bolus dose of clonidine (six patients) and metoprolol (nine patients). Clonidine decreased mean arterial blood pressure and cerebrovascular resistance without affecting other parameters measured. Metoprolol decreased heart rate and mean arterial pressure, but had no effect on the cerebrovascular parameters. The results show that clonidine and metoprolol have no, or only minor, direct influence on local cerebral haemodynamics in severely brain injured patients. This implies that if there is an intracranial pressure reducing effect of these drugs, as suggested, this must be due to other mechanisms, namely a reduction in capillary hydrostatic pressure secondary to decreased arterial blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "12": "The endothelium-intact and -denuded rat aorta is hyperpolarized by racemic and (-)-pinacidil, probably by opening ATP-dependent potassium channels. (+)-Pinacidil caused depolarization of the endothelium-intact and -denuded rat aorta. The depolarization induced by 20 mAM KCl in the endothelium-intact rat aorta was reversed by racemic and (-)-, but not by (+)-pinacidil. On the endothelium-intact rat aorta, isoprenaline produced hyperpolarization and ICI 118551 (erythro-(+/-)-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylamino butan-2-ol) had no effect alone but prevented isoprenaline from causing hyperpolarization. The hyperpolarization induced by isoprenaline was reversed by racemic and (+)-, but not by (-)-pinacidil. Glibenclamide depolarized the endothelium-intact rat aorta and prevented the hyperpolarizing action of racemic pinacidil and (-)-pinacidil. (+)-Pinacidil prevented the hyperpolarizing action of (-)-pinacidil. Glibenclamide is probably preventing the hyperpolarization associated with opening of the ATP-dependent potassium channel by blocking this channel. Several mechanisms may underlie the depolarizing action of (+)-pinacidil, including blocking of ATP-dependent potassium channels.", 
    "13": "The purpose of this double-blind randomized work was to study the effect of alfentanil and esmolol and their half-dose combination on the increases of heart rate and arterial pressure and on the prolongation of the QTc interval of the ECG occurring during anaesthetic induction. Sixty ASA class I-II patient with mean age ranging from 26 to 32 yr among the groups. Patients were allocated to one of four equal groups to receive saline, esmolol 2 mg.kg-1, alfentanil 0.03 mg.kg-1 and alfentanil 0.015 mg.kg-1+esmolol 1 mg.kg-1. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone. Succinylcholine was used to facilitate tracheal intubation. Haemodynamic variables were measured non-invasively and the QTc interval with the aid of a microcomputer. Comparisons between the groups were performed using two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. Both alfentanil and alfentanil-esmolol prevented the increase of heart rate and arterial pressure caused by intubation whereas esmolol prevented only the increase of the heart rate. None of the treatments prevented prolongation of the QTc interval after intubation and only alfentanil prevented that after succinylcholine. The present results suggest that in the prevention of the haemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation, the half-dose combination of alfentanil and esmolol is as effective as alfentanil and superior to esmolol. The combination is preferable to relatively large doses of either drug in circumstances where side effects, such as respiratory depression due to alfentanil or bradycardia due to both drugs should be minimized.",

After a run-in of 10 days, to assess the stability of BP control by atenolol, and to determine baseline parameters, 8 patients in group A received 20 mg tenoxicam (2 x 20 mg on days 1 and 2), and 8 patients in group B received placebo, daily over 15 days (days 0-14), concomitantly with their atenolol regimen. BP was measured under standardized conditions on several days. Heart rate (EHR) after 5 min of exercise by bicycle ergometry (constant 75W), and parameters of renal function were assessed before (baseline) and during concomitant dosing of atenolol and tenoxicam. On day 14 the mean changes (delta A, delta B) from baseline of pre-dose BP (mmHg) and EHR (beats/min) in groups A and B, and the one-sided 95% confidence regions (R) for delta A, respectively, were (delta A, delta B, R): 4.4, 1.6, < 9.5 for sitting systolic BP, 2.8, -0.3, < 4.5 for sitting diastolic BP, -0.3, -0.6, < 5.5 for standing systolic BP, -0.6, -1.9, < 3.0 for standing diastolic BP, 0.4, -7.5, < 0.4 for EHR at pre-dose, 3.1, 0.6, < 7.8 for EHR at 3.5 h post-dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "We experienced a case of DCM (62-year-old man) improved by beta-blocker (Metoprolol) therapy and studied time course of MIBG scintigraphy. We measured cardiac functions by UCG and 99mTc cardiac pool imaging, and MIBG scintigraphy during 12 months of beta-blocker therapy. In planar images we measured washout rate (WR) in total myocardium and regional washout rate (rWR) in 6 segments of myocardium. Cardiac function improved after 3 months of therapy. The WR did not improve until 6 months, but improved after 9 months (Before: 35.1%, 3 months after: 34.6%, 6 months after: 33.6%, 9 months after: 27.6%, 12 months after: 25.4%). rWR in inferoapical segment first improved at 3 months (Before: 40.1%, 3 months after: 35.1%), whereas rWR in antero-apical segment improved after 6 months and that in anterior segment improved after 9 months. These results suggest that the improvement of cardiac sympathetic nerve function in DCM treated with beta-blocker was not identical in each myocardium region.",

Thirty-three patients were randomized to relaxation-biofeedback training alone (administered in a limited-contact treatment format), or to relaxation-biofeedback training accompanied by long-acting propranolol (with dosage individualized at 60, 120, or 180 mg/day). Concomitant propranolol therapy significantly enhanced the effectiveness of relaxation-biofeedback training when either daily headache recordings (79% vs. 54% reduction in migraine activity) or neurologist clinical evaluations (90% vs. 66% reduction) were used to assess treatment outcome. Concomitant propranolol therapy also yielded larger reductions in analgesic medication use and greater improvements of quality of life measures than relaxation-biofeedback training alone but was more frequently associated with side effects.", 
    "19": "Myocarditis, often caused by an infectious agent, may have a presentation mimicking that of acute myocardial infarction. The authors describe a young man who, when first seen in the emergency department, appeared to have an acute myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries. At autopsy, the histologic findings were diagnostic of active myocarditis, mixed-cell type. Neutrophilic infiltration with microabscess suggested an infectious cause, although the etiology was uncertain. The patient's clinical course, pathologic findings, and several treatment modalities are discussed. The differentiation between acute myocardial infarction and acute myocarditis can be difficult. Electrocardiographic changes and enzyme elevations are common in both. Therefore, clinicians should consider myocarditis in all patients--particularly young patients--with normal coronary arteries and suspected myocardial infarction.",

A mean increase of 28% (47%) in the individual tear turnover values was found after the change to the preservative-free timolol (p = 0.04). The BUT values before the change of medication did not differ significantly from those after the change (p = 0.5) but both values were significantly lower than the values of healthy controls (p = 0.009 and p = 0.003, respectively).",

    "24": "To clarify the effect of topical timolol on the microcirculation in human eyes, the blood velocity changes of the iris microcirculation and the aqueous veins were measured before and 90 minutes after instillation of timolol in 8 eyes of 8 healthy volunteers by laser speckle flowgraphy. Systemic blood pressure, heart rate and intraocular pressure were measured before and 90 minutes after the instillation. The fellow eyes were measured as controls. The blood velocity decreased in the iris microcirculation (10% decrease, p < .05) and in the aqueous veins (8% decrease, p < .02) 90 minutes after instillation of timolol. The diameter of the aqueous veins did not change, so that the blood flow in the aqueous veins decreased (6% decrease, p < .02) after instillation. The intraocular pressure and pulse rate decreased (20 and 8% decrease, p < .002 and < .001, respectively) 90 minutes after the instillation. The blood velocity, vessel diameter, and intraocular pressure of fellow eyes and systemic blood pressure showed no significant change. These findings indicate that topical instillation of timolol induces decrease of blood flow in the iris, and, possibly, in the ciliary body. The instillation of timolol may decrease aqueous humor formation, and blood flow in aqueous veins.", 
    "25": "A bidirectional communication exists between the nervous system and the immune system. Evidence has accumulated suggesting that cytokines-immune peptides influence sympathetic neuronal survival and that cytokines can promote the secretion of catecholamines. Using an isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) preparation, we have shown that the liver is an important source of circulating cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and that corticosterone dose dependently influenced LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In this study, we investigated the direct effect of epinephrine (another stress hormone) on the production of TNF and IL-6 in liver. We demonstrated that epinephrine (1 microM/ml) alone did not induce TNF bioactivity but significantly increased IL-6 bioactivity from IPRL effluent. When the IPRL was infused with LPS, epinephrine significantly decreased TNF bioactivity. Epinephrine in LPS-treated livers also significantly increased IL-6 bioactivity. Both responses were totally inhibited by the beta-blocker propranolol (10 microM/ml). Anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, infused into the IPRL completely blocked the rise in TNF and IL-6 concentrations in the effluent leaving the IPRL, supporting the hypothesis that the synthesis (or release) of these cytokines was dependent on protein synthesis. We then attempted to determine whether epinephrine exerts similar effects in vitro. Using isolated Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, we found that epinephrine alone had no effect on TNF and IL-6 production in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes but significantly decreased LPS-induced TNF bioactivity and increased LPS-induced IL-6 bioactivity in Kupffer cells. Our data support the hypothesis that epinephrine can promote IL-6 secretion from IPRL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Heart rate, heart rate variability, and atrioventricular (AV) conduction were studied in 20 young (30 +/- 5 yr) and 19 older (69 +/- 7 yr) healthy men and women before and after single and double autonomic blockade (randomized order: atropine, 0.04 mg/kg i.v.; propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg i.v.). Basal R-R intervals did not differ, but older age increased P-R intervals (177 +/- 24 vs. 149 +/- 17 ms, P < 0.001) and decreased SD of R-R (43 +/- 17 vs. 70 +/- 18 ms, P = 0.001) and heart rate spectral content (area under the power vs. frequency curve from 0.04 to 0.32 Hz: 3.01 +/- 2.1 vs. 7.82 +/- 4.8 beats/min2, P < 0.009), as well as postural responses (R-R decreases of 107 +/- 80 vs. 250 +/- 72 ms, P < 0.002). Atropine decreased R-R intervals, SD of R-R, and high-frequency (0.24-0.32 Hz) spectral content less in elderly subjects compared with younger subjects. Propranolol increased R-R and P-R intervals equally in old and young and abolished low-frequency (0.04-0.12 Hz) increases with standing (P < 0.0008). After double blockade, R-R, P-R, and paced AV intervals were longer in old subjects. Mean values were as follows: R-R intervals, 859 +/- 176 vs. 677 +/- 106 ms, P < 0.001; P-R intervals, 179 +/- 23 vs. 149 +/- 17 ms, P = 0.0002; paced P-R intervals (500 ms), 251 +/- 39 vs. 215 +/- 47 ms; and AV block cycle length, 413 +/- 51 vs. 385 +/- 69 ms (multivariate analysis of variance, P < 0.03). After double autonomic blockade, heart rate variability was nearly eliminated in young and old (reduced > 98%, P < 0.0001). We conclude that age differences in heart rate variability can be explained by autonomic influences, but heart rate and AV conduction differences exist independently of beta-adrenergic and/or parasympathetic influences.", 
    "27": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors not only reduce angiotensin II (ANG II) levels but also inhibit kinin degradation. The relative roles of ANG II and bradykinin in the acute action of ACE inhibitors on renal hemodynamic parameters in rats after 3 wk of diabetes were explored using antagonists of the ANG II type 1 (AT1) and the bradykinin B2 receptors. Conscious control and streptozotocin diabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive vehicle, the ACE inhibitor, ramiprilat, the B2-receptor blocker, HOE-140, the AT1-receptor blocker, valsartan, or the combination of ramiprilat and HOE-140. Systolic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), filtration fraction and urinary flow, and sodium excretion were assessed before and during treatment. Diabetic animals had higher GFR and a tendency toward increased RPF and filtration fraction compared with control animals. Acute ramiprilat infusion decreased GFR significantly in diabetic but not in control animals. Valsartan and the combination of ramiprilat and HOE-140 reduced blood pressure to a similar degree to ramiprilat alone, yet did not reduce GFR. No decrease in GFR was observed in any control rat groups. Ramiprilat decreased RPF in diabetic rats but increased RPF in control rats. No such effects on RPF were observed with valsartan. HOE-140 alone did not influence any renal parameter in the diabetic rats. Diabetic rats had increased urinary flow and sodium excretion, but these parameters were not influenced by any drug regimen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Calcium channel blockers are used extensively in the treatment of the three major anginal syndromes. In the treatment of Prinzmetal's angina, their antivasospastic properties account for their therapeutic effectiveness. Calcium channel blockers are drugs of first choice in this syndrome. In chronic stable angina, calcium channel blockers may be used as monotherapy or in combination with beta-blockers and/or nitrates. In patients with unstable angina, reduction in the incidence of ischemic episodes produced by calcium channel blockers is well documented. Recent data suggest that calcium channel blockers should generally be used in combination with beta-blockers, nitrates and antithrombotic agents. Patients with ischemic heart disease often exhibit reduced ventricular function. All of the first generation calcium channel blockers exacerbate symptoms in patients with established heart failure and may precipitate heart failure, particularly when combined with beta-blockers. Second generation vascular-selective dihydropyridines have been introduced recently. Vascular selectivity determines the drug's degree of negative inotropic effect. Felodipine is one of the most vascular selective of the available dihydropyridines and has no negative inotropic effects at clinically administered doses. In a long term study, felodipine, 20 mg/day, abolished symptoms and chronic ischemic episodes in 81% of treated subjects with Prinzmetal's angina. In patients with stable angina, felodipine has been found to be effective either as monotherapy or in combination with beta-blockers. In patients with known or suspected ventricular dysfunction, vascular-selective dihydropyridines such as felodipine offer advantages over the nonselective calcium channel blockers, particularly in patients receiving beta-blockers.", 
    "29": "A significant proportion of myocardial ischemia is 'silent' in nature. Furthermore, this asymptomatic ischemia portends an adverse prognosis for patients with known coronary artery disease. Silent myocardial ischemia can be objectively assessed and quantified by a number of noninvasive means; however, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has emerged as a preferred method for both detection and analysis in hospital and during daily life conditions. Silent myocardial ischemia exhibits a circadian pattern. It represents an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and myocardial oxygen demand, and can be triggered by both physical and mental stress. The important role of endothelial dysfunction and autonomic nervous system influences has been recently elucidated. Up to 75% of ischemic episodes in patients are silent. Patients with asymptomatic coronary artery disease, chronic stable angina and unstable angina, and those postmyocardial infarction or postrevascularization who exhibit ST segment shift all show adverse short and long term prognosis compared with controls. Treatment modalities have included nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, anxiolytics, anti-platelet agents and revascularization procedures. While the majority of these studies have demonstrated significant reduction in the frequency of silent myocardial ischemia, limited data on influencing prognosis are available; thus recommendations regarding treatment of these patients await the results of ongoing clinical trials.",

    "34": "beta-Adrenoceptor (beta AR) responsiveness, receptor density, receptor-G protein coupling, and the possible role of membrane fluidity in receptor-G protein coupling were investigated in the rat aorta with age. The beta AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO) produced relaxation of KCl-induced aortic contractions by 97%, 21%, and 0% in aortae from 1- 6-, and 24-month-old Fischer 344 rats, respectively. Forskolin completely relaxed the contractions at all ages. beta AR density was determined in aortic membranes by saturation binding of 125I-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP). beta AR density was 76, 52, and 47 fmol/mg of protein in 1-, 6-, and 24-month-old rats, respectively. To investigate beta AR coupling to G proteins, displacement by ISO of 125I-CYP binding was determined in aortic membranes in the presence and absence of the GTP analog guanosine-5'-(beta gamma-imido)triphosphate [Gpp(NH)p] (0.1 mM). The effect of Gpp(NH)p on the ISO displacement curve for 125I-CYP binding was greatest in 1-month-old rats and decreased markedly with age. In 1-month-old aorta, in the absence of Gpp(NH)p the ISO displacement curve was biphasic and two affinity constants were determined (KH - 0.061 microM and KL = 2.4 microM). In the presence of Gpp(NH)p the ISO displacement curve was monophasic (Kd - 0.72 microM). In 6-month-old aorta, whereas an effect of Gpp(NH)p on the ISO displacement curve could still be observed [in the absence of Gpp(NH)p, KH = 0.2 microM and KL = 3.5 microM; in the presence of Gpp(NH)p, Kd - 0.83 microM], the affinity constant for high affinity agonist binding and the percentage of receptors with high affinity for agonist were decreased significantly. In 24-month-old aorta there was no effect of Gpp(NH)p on the ISO displacement curve and a single affinity constant was detected [0.7 microM and 0.8 microM in the presence and absence of Gpp(NH)p, respectively]. The presence of two affinity constants for ISO in 1- and 6-month-old aorta in the absence of Gpp(NH)p and single affinity constants in the presence of Gpp(NH)p presumably represent the G protein-coupled and uncoupled states of the beta ARs, which are not observed in 24-month-old aorta. The ability of the beta AR to form the high affinity nucleotide-sensitive complex with the agonist was restored by treatment of the membranes with cis-vaccenic acid, which increases the fluidity of the membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "35": "Mononuclear leukocytes (MNLs) have been used as a model of beta-adrenergic responsiveness of airway smooth muscle, but the relevance of this model remains controversial. The basenji greyhound (BG) dog model of airway hyperresponsiveness shares some features with human asthma, and airway smooth muscle shows a selective impairment in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. In this study, MNL membranes were obtained from these same dogs, and the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylyl cyclase cascade function was compared with that in airway smooth muscle. beta-Adrenergic receptor numbers and affinities for iodine 125-cyanopindolol were similar in the two dog groups (receptor numbers [Bmax] = 441 +/- 101 and 447 +/- 61 fmol/mg protein and dissociation constant [Kd] = 269 +/- 44 and 312 +/- 60 pmol/L for mongrel and BG MNLs, respectively). Quantities of the Gs alpha protein were not different in the membranes as determined by immunoblotting. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by isoproterenol (100 mumol/L) was impaired in MNL membranes of BG membranes (22% +/- 4% increase over guanosine triphosphate [10 mumol/L]) compared with mongrel membranes (47% +/- 8.6% increase over guanosine triphosphate [10 mumol/L], p < 0.05). Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by prostaglandin E1 (10 mumol/L), NaF (10 mmol/L), or forskolin (10 mumol/L) did not differ in membranes from the two groups.

    "36": "The effect of treatment with two different antihypertensive agents on the function of small arteries from 17 patients with essential hypertension randomly assigned to receive either the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril or the beta-blocker atenolol was investigated. Subcutaneous small arteries obtained from gluteal fat biopsies were studied on a wire myograph before treatment and at 1 and 2 years of treatment. Blood pressure was mildly elevated in both groups of patients (mean, 150/100 mm Hg) and was well controlled throughout the 2 years of treatment (mean, 130/85 mm Hg). We previously reported, in arteries from patients treated with cilazapril, an improvement at 1 year of treatment of the vasoconstrictor effect of endothelin-1, which had been significantly attenuated in the untreated hypertensive patients compared with normotensive subjects. After 2 years of treatment, this normalization of endothelin-1 response was still present in small arteries of patients treated with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, whereas in patients treated with atenolol, responses were still unchanged after 2 years of treatment. Endothelial function was tested by examining the response of norepinephrine-precontracted arteries to acetylcholine. Untreated hypertensive patients exhibited a slightly but significantly blunted vasorelaxation in response to 10 mumol/L acetylcholine compared with normotensive subjects. After 1 and 2 years of effective antihypertensive treatment, cilazapril-treated patients exhibited responses to acetylcholine that were not different from those of normotensive subjects, whereas atenolol-treated patients still had impaired responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) potentiates sympathetic neurotransmission by presynaptic facilitation of norepinephrine release. We investigated whether endogenous Ang II modulates peripheral sympathetic activity in sodium-depleted essential hypertensive patients. We evaluated the effect of intrabrachial infusion of saralasin, an Ang II antagonist (5 micrograms/100 mL forearm tissue per minute), and benazeprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (2 micrograms/100 mL forearm tissue per minute), on forearm vasoconstriction (measured by strain-gauge venous plethysmography) induced by the application of lower body negative pressure (-10 mm Hg for 5 minutes). Both saralasin and benazeprilat (n = 6 for each group) blunted the vasoconstrictor action of lower body negative pressure, suggesting that circulating Ang II modulates peripheral sympathetic activity. In addition, since beta-adrenoceptor stimulation can activate the production of vascular Ang II, the effect of saralasin and benazeprilat on lower body negative pressure application was evaluated in the presence of isoproterenol (0.09 microgram/100 mL forearm tissue per minute) and propranolol (10 micrograms/100 mL forearm tissue per minute). In two other groups of hypertensive patients, isoproterenol infusion increased the release of Ang II in the forearm vasculature (arteriovenous values measured by radioimmunoassay). Furthermore, isoproterenol potentiated lower body negative pressure-induced vasoconstriction. This facilitating effect was abolished by either saralasin or benazeprilat (n = 6 for each group). In contrast, in two further groups of patients (n = 6 for each group), in the presence of the beta-blocker propranolol saralasin and benazeprilat did not alter the vasoconstrictor action of the endogenous sympathetic stimulus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "We investigated the possible relationship between endothelin-1 injection into the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray area and the glutamatergic system in the control of cardiovascular function. Endothelin-1 was injected into the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray area of freely moving rats at doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 pmol. Endothelin-1 increased arterial blood pressure (from 7.0 +/- 1.6 to 55.0 +/- 4.1 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM) in a dose-dependent manner and induced characteristic behavioral changes such as longitudinal rolling of the body (barrel-rolling). DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid and (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[D-alpha] cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate, both selective N-methyl-D-aspartate excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists, but not 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, a non-N-methyl-D-aspartate excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, significantly decreased endothelin-1-induced cardiovascular and behavioral changes (P < .01). Prazosin and propranolol, adrenergic blocking agents, and reserpine, a depletor of catecholamine stores, also prevented these effects. We propose that the glutamatergic system may exert, via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, a significant influence on endothelin-1-induced cardiovascular and behavioral effects after its injection into the periaqueductal area.",

Before and at the end of treatment, gluteal biopsies were taken under local anesthetic; from these biopsies, two small arteries were dissected and mounted on a myograph for morphometry. The reduction in blood pressure with atenolol (drop in mean blood pressure 28.4 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) was greater than with perindopril (20.6 +/- 1.8 mm Hg, P < .05). Perindopril treatment caused an increase in small artery diameter (231 +/- 14 to 274 +/- 13 microns, P < .05) and a reduction in the ratio of media thickness to lumen diameter (7.94 +/- 0.65% to 5.96 +/- 0.42%, P < .05), whereas atenolol had no effect (246 +/- 14 to 231 +/- 13 microns and 7.14 +/- 0.47% to 6.79 +/- 0.45%, respectively).

A pressure-transduced left-ventricular balloon catheter measured pressure and heart rate changes. Changes in the maximum positive rate of change in pressure (dP/dT) and maximum negative dP/dT were determined. Responses to varying doses of T3, T4, and isoproterenol were assessed in the presence and absence of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol. cAMP production, measured by radioimmunoassay, was determined in myocardial cell suspensions after incubation with T3 or isoproterenol.",

The maximal increase in dP/dT after 0.8 nmol isoproterenol was comparable to that produced by T3. However, the cardiotonic actions of isoproterenol were significantly slower to develop (peaking at 60 vs. 15 s) and lasted longer than those of T3. Pretreatment with propranolol 1 mumol diminished the contractile effects of isoproterenol but had no effect on those of T3. Concentrations of isoproterenol that increase contractility also significantly increased cAMP production in isolated rat myocardial cells. However, T3 failed to increase cAMP production.", 
    "44": "These results demonstrate that the acute inotropic effects of T3 are not shared by T4 and appear unrelated to beta-adrenergic receptor mechanisms or to generation of cAMP. Thus, T3 acutely stimulates cardiac contraction by mechanisms that differ from those of the more commonly used beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms underlying the acute contractile effects of T3 and to determine whether T3 will prove useful for increasing ventricular function in patients.",

Carvedilol, a novel beta adrenoceptor antagonist and a vasodilator, has been recently shown to exert potent antioxidant effects in multiple cell model systems. In the present experiment, we investigated the effect of carvedilol on SAO shock. Pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were subjected to 60 min of SAO followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Administration of 1 mg/kg carvedilol 10 min before reperfusion prolonged survival time (P < .05) and attenuated the increases in tissue myeloperoxidase activities (P < .01) and hematocrits (P < .001). Moreover, carvedilol significantly preserved superior mesenteric artery endothelial function (P < .01). Similar protection was seen in SAO shock rats treated with the superoxide free-radical scavenger superoxide dismutase. Except for a moderate attenuation of an increase in hematocrits, protective effects were not seen in SAO shock rats treated with the prototypic beta blocker propranolol. These results indicate that in murine SAO shock, carvedilol affords significant protection, which may be achieved through maintenance of tissue blood perfusion, quenching of oxygen free radicals, preservation of vascular endothelial function, and inhibition of neutrophil-endothelial interaction and its resultant increased microvascular permeability.",

The free fraction of R-oxprenolol in plasma was 4% higher than that of S-oxprenolol. The intrinsic clearance of S-oxprenolol was 1.5 times larger than that of R-oxprenolol, and a maximum of 3% of the dose was excreted as unchanged enantiomers in the urine.

Twenty-five percent of the dose of the R-enantiomer was excreted in the urine as R-oxprenolol glucuronide; 29% of the S-enantiomer dose was excreted as S-oxprenolol glucuronide. The renal clearance of R-oxprenolol glucuronide was, on average, 172 ml/min, suggesting active tubular secretion.

In contrast, administration of anti-IL-1 beta and ZnPP into the left cerebral ventricle attenuated the postischemic increase of brain water content and decreased the size of brain infarction (83.5 +/- 2.0% and 79.9 +/- 2.0% in the dorsal and ventral parts of the caudate putamen, respectively, in rats treated with 10 micrograms anti-IL-1 beta; P < .01).

Using spectrophotometric measurements, it was found that metoprolol tartrate and benzyl orange form a chloroform soluble ion-pair complex with an absorption maximum at 401 nm. The composition of the ion-pair complex was determined by applying Job's method to equimolar solutions of metoprolol tartrate: benzyl orange (1:2); molar absorptivity 7.39 x 10(3) mol-1 cm-1. Extraction of the ion-pair complex in chloroform was accomplished easily at a Britton-Robinson's buffered optimum pH = 5.2, mu = 0.1 mol/dm3. The relative stability constant, calculated according to the method of Sommer and Job's non-equimolar solutions, was log K = 9.72 (avg. value).

Compounds 7-9 represent a new type of molecular duplication of beta-adrenergic drugs, formally deriving from the sharing of the aromatic portions of two different pharmacophoric subunits, namely the (aryloxy)propanolaminic portion of AOPAs and the [(benzylideneamino)oxy]propanolaminic portion of aryl-substituted MAOPAs. The pharmacological results showed that the beta-blocking activity of compounds 7-9 is closely related to the way in which the two subunits are linked by the aromatic nucleus: the activity decreases on passing from the ortho-compounds (7a,b) to the meta (8a,b) and then to the para (9a,b) isomers. A comparison of this activity trend with those found for series of both beta-blocking AOPAs and aryl-substituted MAOPAs seems to indicate that compounds 7-9 can be considered more as AOPAs substituted on the phenyl ring by a [(methyleneamino)oxy]propanolaminic chain rather than as aromatic MAOPAs substituted on the same phenyl moiety by an oxypropanolaminic portion.",

Patients with a significant increase in thromboxane formation (> 30%) during exercise (P < 0.0001) had a worse prognosis, with a 60% incidence of coronary events during the three years following the index infarction as compared to only 8% in the group without such an increase in thromboxane formation during exercise (P = 0.008).

Among the 10 isozymes, only CYP2D6 and 1A2 at a substrate concentration of 5 microns, and CYP2C8 and 2C9 in addition to the two isozymes at a BTL concentration of 1 mM, exhibited detectable BTL 4-hydroxylase activities. The activities at 1 mM BTL were on the order of CYP2D6 (100% as relative activity) > CYP1A2 (86%) > CYP2C8 and 2C9 (7-8%). Enzyme kinetic parameters of CYP2D6 were calculated to be 4.41 microns as a Km value and 0.442 nmol min-1 per nmol CYP as a Vmax value. Kinetic parameters of CYP1A2 were calculated as 295 microns and 0.411 nmol min-1 per nmol CYP for Km and Vm values, respectively. These results suggest that both CYP2D6 and 1A2 primarily catalyse BTL 4-hydroxylation, but that the former is a predominant isozyme responsible for the reaction at a low substrate concentration range of BTL in human liver.", 
    "60": "The study was undertaken to evaluate the development and association of parameters related to the metabolic syndrome during celiprolol treatment. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and independent oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed on 25 nondiabetic patients with controlled hypertension and dyslipidemia. The tests were carried out during the patients' previous antihypertensive monotherapy (beta- or Ca-blocker, or an ACE inhibitor), and after 6 and 12 months of celiprolol treatment. About one third of patients were randomized to a control group in which treatment was kept unchanged. Insulin sensitivity index (ISI), measured by the euglycemic clamp test, increased 35% in the celiprolol group at 6 months and remained at that level at 12 months, independent of the previous treatment (p = 0.03, compared to the change in the control group). During a 2 hour OGTT, incremental glucose area under the curve (AUC) decreased from 4.5 to 1.9 hr x mmol/l during 6 months of celiprolol treatment, and decreased further to 1.5 hr x mmol/l at 12 months (p < 0.001). Insulin AUC decreased from 113 to 72 hr x mU/l, and decreased further to 68 hr x mU/l (p < 0.01). All insulin parameters in OGTT were highly significant (p < 0.0001) and inversely associated with ISI. Insulin AUC had the best linear correlation with ISI (r = -0.682, p < 0.0001). Glucose parameters in OGTT correlated only weakly and inversely with insulin sensitivity. From the fasting serum lipids, triglycerides showed an inverse (p < 0.001) and HDL a weak (p < 0.05) positive association with ISI. Four out of 20 metabolic, clinical, and demographic parameters proved to be independently significant predictors for ISI in multiple regression analysis. These were insulin AUC, fasting insulin levels, triglyceride values, and age. The coefficient of determination in this four-parameter linear model was 69%. In this preliminary, observer-masked trial with a limited control group, celiprolol improved the impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance of dyslipidemic hypertensive patients. A fairly predictive model can be formulated to evaluate the peripheral insulin sensitivity of hypertensive patients with suspected metabolic syndrome using OGTT with serum insulin determinations.",

    "62": "The beneficial effect of chronic beta-blockade in patients with congestive heart failure has been repeatedly shown since its introduction into treatment for this condition in 1975. Still this kind of therapy remains controversial, it is sometimes regarded as a therapeutic paradox, and its use is mainly limited to specialist centers. Various favorable effects of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease have been demonstrated, the principal among them being reduction in energy requirements and ischemia, antiarrhythmogenic effect, improvement of diastolic function, protection of myocytes against catecholamine overload, centrally mediated increase in vagal tone, upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, and possible blockade of autoantibodies against beta 1-receptors. Although most of the studies used metoprolol, these effects may be relevant to certain other beta-blockers. Despite very solid pathophysiological and pharmacological rationales for the use of beta-blockade, a major obstacle for a general acceptance of this therapeutic concept is the striking contrast between hemodynamic changes during the acute effect and long-term treatment. When titrated carefully from very low doses and used with a true commitment to long-term treatment, beta-blockers have been shown to prevent further deterioration of heart failure and to improve hemodynamics, exercise tolerance, quality of life, and prognosis.", 
    "63": "Experiments were performed on SD rats anaesthetized with urethane and chloralose. The left ventricular function and the parameters of hemorrheology during acute hypoxia were investigated. It was found that during acute hypoxia of 15 min, arterial blood gas value PaO2 decreased markedly. The parameters of the left ventricular function such as +/- dP/dtmax, Peak, HR, Vce40, Vmp, Vmax, L0 (CFU), decreased markedly either. At the same time, hyperviscosity was induced and red blood cell filtration (IF) increased. All these parameters recovered to normal control level after reoxygenation of 15 min. By intravenous injection of propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) and then hypoxia, the left ventricular function were suppressed markedly; and so were to the elevation of blood viscosity and IF. Preinjection of regitine (3 mg/kg) prior hypoxia has the same effect on the blood viscosity and IF. Acute hypoxia induced hyperviscosity and elevation of IF could be suppressed by destruction of carotid sinus region with phenol, but the left ventricular function decreased markedly. These results suggest that acute hypoxia induces hyperviscosity and decreases of red blood cell deformability and left ventricular function, which is probably mediated via the sympathetic nervous system and carotid sinus region.",

The results showed no significant differences in the ratios of S/R-propranolol for AUC, clearance, or overall mean concentration among the oral dosage groups. Significant differences in these parameters including Cmax S/R ratio were seen between the oral phases and the IV phase. These differences appear to be related more to the route of administration than to the low input rate. However, at high concentrations there may be input-rate alteration in S/R ratios. Specifically, for phase B, which had the highest Cmax concentrations, the Cmax S/R ratio was significantly lower than the other oral dosage groups A and C (Cmax S/R ratios: 1.44 versus 1.54 and 1.54, respectively; P < .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Drug-induced lupus is a syndrome resembling mild systemic lupus erythematosus which can complicate treatment with certain apparently unrelated therapies. The most common individual agents are procainamide and hydralazine. Drugs less frequently associated with the disease are chlorpromazine, isoniazid, methyldopa, penicillamine, quinidine and sulfasalazine. Whole drug groups have also been implicated, such as the anticonvulsants, beta-blockers, sulfonamides and some of the newer 'biological' agents. The syndrome is characterised by arthralgia, myalgia, pleurisy, rashes and fever in association with antinuclear antibodies in the serum. More serious features of idiopathic lupus such as nephritis and cerebral disease are rare in drug-induced disease. The pathogenesis is unknown but in some cases is thought to be due to interactions between the drug and DNA or histones, rendering them immunogenic. For the biological agents, including interferons and antibodies to tumour necrosis factor-alpha, it has been suggested that it is due to disruption of the cytokine network. Although extremely rare, recognition of drug-induced lupus is important because it reverts within a few weeks of stopping the drug. It is possible that understanding its pathogenesis may shed light on its more serious relative, systemic lupus erythematosus.",

A manifest hypotensive effect of proxodolol was due to depression of aqueous humor production and improvement of its outflow. Comparative study of the efficacies of proxodolol and timolol maleate by the blind test and randomization demonstrated the identity of these drugs. A synergic effect on intraocular pressure was observed when proxodolol was combined with pilocarpine and/or klofelin.",

Studies using human liver microsomes and six recombinant human CYP isoforms (i.e. CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) were performed to identify the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform(s) involved in the ring 4-hydroxylation and side-chain N-desisopropylation of propranolol enantiomers in humans. 2. alpha-Naphthoflavone and 7-ethoxyresorufin (selective inhibitors of CYP1A1/2) inhibited the N-desisopropylation of R- and S-propranolol by human liver microsomes by 20 and 40%, respectively, while quinidine (a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6) abolished the 4-hydroxylation of both propranolol enantiomers almost completely. In contrast, sulphaphenazole (CYP2C8/9 inhibitor), S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19 inhibitor), troleandomycin (CYP3A3/4 inhibitor) and diethyldithiocarbamate (CYP2E1 inhibitor) elicited only weak inhibitory effects on propranolol metabolism via the two measured metabolic pathways. 3. Significant (P < 0.01) correlations were observed between the microsomal N-desisopropylation of both propranolol enantiomers and that for the O-deethylation of phenacetin among the 11 different human liver microsome samples (r = 0.98 and 0.77 for R- and S-propranolol, respectively). A marginally significant (r = 0.60, P congruent to 0.05) correlation was also observed between N-desisopropylation of S-, but not of R-propranolol and the 4'-hydroxylation of S-mephenytoin. No significant correlations were observed between the N-desisopropylation of propranolol enantiomers and the 2-hydroxylation of desipramine, the hydroxylation of tolbutamide or the 6 beta-hydroxylation of testosterone. 4. Significant (P < 0.01) correlations were observed between the microsomal 4-hydroxylation of R- and S-propranolol and the 2-hydroxylation of desipramine (r = 0.85 and 0.98, respectively). A weak (r = 0.66), albeit significant (P < 0.05) correlation was observed between the 4-hydroxylation of R-, but not of S-propranolol and the hydroxylation of tolbutamide. No significant correlations were observed between the 4-hydroxylation of propranolol enantiomers and the oxidation of other substrates for CYP1A2, 2C19, and 3A3/4. 5. Recombinant human CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 exhibited comparable catalytic activity with respect to the N-desisopropylation of both propranolol enantiomers; only expressed CYP2D6 exhibited a marked catalytic activity with respect to the 4-hydroxylation of both propranolol enantiomers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

It is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and membrane-stabilizing effects at therapeutic dosages. In patients with hypertension, bisoprolol diminishes plasma renin activity, platelet aggregation, effective renal plasma flow, and creatinine clearance. Bisoprolol has minimal effects on glucose tolerance and plasma lipid profiles. Monotherapy with bisoprolol is as effective as with atenolol, nitrendipine, or nifedipine. Low-dose combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide is at least as effective as either bisoprolol or hydrochlorothiazide alone. Preliminary experience in the management of angina pectoris suggests that bisoprolol is at least as efficacious as atenolol or verapamil. Thus far, reported adverse effects are similar to those of other beta-blockers. No clinically important drug interactions have been reported at this time.",

This multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted over a period of 6 months. The inclusion criteria were stable angina with electrically positive stress test, which remained positive despite a 15-day treatment with diltiazem (180 mg/24 h). It was conducted in 67 patients randomized into two groups: diltiazem-placebo (group I: 35 patients) and diltiazem-trimetazidine (group II: 32 patients). The follow-up consisted of clinical assessment and a stress test on inclusion and at 6 months. The two groups were similar on inclusion for all ergometric parameters, excepted for the time to onset of the ischaemic threshold of 1 mm and the total duration of effort, which were significantly longer in the placebo group. Comparison of the stress tests performed at the sixth month and on inclusion between groups I and II showed that the ischaemic threshold of 1 mm was significantly delayed by 2 minutes 41 seconds in the trimetazidine group (p < 0.001) versus 42 seconds in the placebo group (NS). Similarly, the work performed at this threshold was significantly increased by 1446 kpm in the trimetazidine group (p < 0.001) versus 564 kpm in the placebo group (p = 0.012). The difference between the two groups was significant for these two parameters, p = 0.008 and p = 0.018, respectively.

    "80": "Only few data are available concerning the biochemical and functional state of the beta-adrenergic system in hypertrophied human myocardium. The present study was to investigate the myocardial beta-adrenergic signal transduction system in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Thin myocardial strips were prepared from surgically excised, septal myocardium from 7 patients with HOCM and their force of contraction was measured in vitro. The positive inotropic effects of calcium and dihydro-ouabain, both acting independently of beta-adrenoceptors and cAMP, were similar in these preparations to those, previously published, seen with nonfailing myocardium. In contrast, the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) had reduced positive inotropic effects. Their EC50-values were about 10 fold higher than the respective EC50-values published for nonfailing myocardium. The positive inotropic potencies of isoprenaline and IBMX were reduced in HOCM by as much as they were in the additionally investigated myocardium from 6 patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR, NYHA III). In order to clarify whether the functional alterations are related to changes in the beta-adrenoceptors, beta-adrenoceptor density and beta 1: beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype distribution were determined in the same myocardium using 125I-Iodocyanopindolol saturation binding. Myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density was reduced to 68% in HOCM and to 56% in MR compared to nonfailing myocardium controls (NF: 64.8 +/- 6.5 fmol/mg protein). In HOCM, this reduction was due to a selective down regulation of beta 1-adrenoceptors (24.9 +/- 3.7 fmol/mg protein vs NF: 46.4 +/- 6.8 fmol/mg protein, P < 0.05), whereas beta 2-adrenoceptor density was unchanged (19.0 +/- 1.9 fmol/mg protein vs NF: 18.4 +/- 3.3 fmol/mg protein, n.s.). In MR both beta-adrenoceptor subtypes were reduced (beta 1: 26.9 +/- 1.4 fmol/mg protein, beta 2: 9.6 +/- 1.7 fmol/mg protein; both P < 0.05 vs NF). Electrochemically determined plasma catecholamine levels were elevated in MR. However, plasma catecholamine levels were normal or slightly below normal in HOCM. In summary, myocardial beta-adrenoceptors are downregulated and their function is impaired in HOCM. This desensitization is not caused by a negative feedback regulation due to increased plasma catecholamines. The present results show that the desensitizations of the beta-adrenergic system associated with HOCM has characteristics that indicate a major deviation in its development from that of the beta-adrenergic desensitization previously described to occur in congestive heart failure.",

In vitro incubation of F, procaine, chloroprocaine, and atropine with blood from different New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits resulted in a bimodal distribution (70% fast, 30% slow) of ester hydrolysis rates. Using F as a model substrate, bimodal hydrolysis rates were also observed in NZW rabbit cornea but not aqueous humor, iris-ciliary body complex and ocular tissues of pigmented rabbits. In addition, the bimodal distribution of esterase activity was not observed in blood from rats, dogs, and humans. Incubation of esters at various positions of the phenoxypropanolamine nucleus of beta blockers with NZW rabbit blood indicated structural specificity of the carboxylesterase in terms of unimodal or biomodal distribution of activity. These results strongly suggest that the carboxylesterase in NZW rabbit blood that hydrolyzes F and similar compounds is atropine esterase as described in the literature.",

ODC activity and cardiac polyamine content are considered to be correlated with ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rat hearts. To determine whether ISO-induced cardiac ODC activity is mediated through the renin-angiotensin system, especially at the AT1-receptor, we used a nonpeptide AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, in this study. Losartan (10 mg/kg) suppressed both heart ODC and polyamine contents in ISO-treated rats. Although metoprolol (a selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) totally suppressed ODC activity, these results suggest that ISO-stimulated cardiac ODC activity may be regulated through beta 2-adrenoceptors coupled with AT1 receptors in rats.", 
    "84": "The clinical efficacy and safety of bevantolol hydrochloride, a newly developed beta-blocker, used in combination with other types of antihypertensive agents, were evaluated in patients with severe hypertension by multicenter open-label trials. A total of 28 patients were studied at 20 medical centers. Four patients (14.3%) were excluded for some reasons, and the remaining 24 patients (22 outpatients and 2 inpatients) were analyzed. Following the initiation of therapy, blood pressure decreased from 181 +/- 15 (SD)/114 +/- 3 mmHg to 170 +/- 17/102 +/- 8 mmHg (p < 0.01) on the 14th day of the therapy and gradually lowered further thereafter. At the end of the trial (8th week), blood pressure was stabilized at the level of 160 +/- 14/96 +/- 10 mmHg. The antihypertensive efficacy rated by the changes in mean blood pressure was 79.2% (19/24). Pulse rate decreased slightly but significantly from 75 +/- 10 beats/min to 70 +/- 7 (p < 0.05) on the 14th day of the therapy and stabilized at the similar level thereafter. As abnormal laboratory data were detected in 3 patients and 1 patient complained of a mild headache, the safety ratio was 83.3% (20/24 patients). When the usefulness was assessed in terms of antihypertensive efficacy and safety profiles, bevantolol hydrochloride was considered useful in 75.0% of the patients studied. In conclusion, bevantolol hydrochloride, used in combination with other classes of antihypertensive agents, appears to be an excellent drug for the management of patients with severe hypertension.",

Labetalol was started at 50 mg bid and as necessary increased by 50 mg bid every 2 weeks. Evaluable for efficacy were 105 moderate and 25 moderately severe hypertensives. Labetalol was effective (decreased SuDBP to 90 mmHg or less) in 75% of patients and moderately effective (decreased SuDBP at least 10% of baseline but did not reach 90 mmHg) in 10%. The cumulative percent responders were 15, 49, 79 and 85% to final daily doses of 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg, respectively. Adverse reactions were found in 31% of patients, the most frequent were gastrointestinal complaints causing 3 withdrawals. It is concluded that labetalol optimal doses for Indonesian moderate to moderately severe hypertensives range from 100 to 300 mg daily in 2 divided doses.", 
    "86": "Esmolol is a unique cardioselective, intravenous, ultra-short acting, beta-adrenergic blocking agent. A 9-minute half-life with rapid clinical onset and offset of action and the ability to titrate the drug to changing circumstances makes esmolol a useful addition to our treatment armamentarium. The efficacy and safety of esmolol have been shown in specific clinical settings, i.e. in patients with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation or flutter and supraventricular tachycardia. In the emergency management of hypertension, tachycardia or arrhythmia in critical care units, emergency room and surgery, esmolol is effective by attenuating hemodynamic responses from sympathetic activation or endogenous catecholamine release. With careful titration and monitoring of the patient, esmolol is relatively safe in the management of hypertension or tachyarrhythmias associated with congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive lung disease where beta-blockers are otherwise contraindicated. Different dosage schedules have been employed as per the clinical setting and the diagnosis. Generally, esmolol is infused intravenously in doses ranging from 25-300 micrograms/kg/min, along with a loading dose or bolus. The most frequently reported adverse effect associated with esmolol infusion was hypotension. Adverse effects due to beta-blockade can be corrected by down-titrating or discontinuing the infusion with complete disappearance of clinical effects in 20-30 minutes. Therefore, as an ultra-short acting beta-blocker, esmolol is an important therapeutic option in the acute clinical setting.", 
    "87": "Modest increases in urinary bladder pressure result in acute hypertensive episodes in humans with spinal cord lesions above T5. The underlying mechanisms of this condition, referred to as autonomic dysreflexia, are not well understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the contribution of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors as well as circulating neuropeptide-Y (NPY) to the pressor response to bladder distension in conscious cervical spinal rats. Rats were chronically instrumented with arterial and venous catheters. After 2-3 days, a complete spinal transection (C7) was performed, and the urinary bladder was catheterized: 24 h later, mean arterial pressure (MAP) responses to 5 min bladder distensions (+40) were measured under control conditions and after administration of specific autonomic antagonists. To assess the contribution of alpha and beta adrenergic mechanisms the alpha antagonist prazosin (0.45 mg/kg i.v.) and beta antagonist, propranolol (4 mg/kg i.v.), were administered individually or together. Blood samples were taken before, during and after bladder distension for determination of plasma NPY by radioimmunoassay. The pressor response to bladder distension was approximately 30 mmHg under control conditions. The response was attenuated (-38%), but not abolished, by prazosin. A similar attenuation (-41%) was observed with propranolol. There were no changes in plasma NPY in response to bladder distension. Finally, the pressor response was completely abolished by combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade. These results suggest that autonomic dysreflexia is mediated exclusively by adrenergic receptors in the spinal rat. Moreover, both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors contribute to the pressor response induced by bladder distension in the conscious cervical spinal rat.", 
    "88": "The present study evaluated the relationship of plasma norepinephrine (NE) and aortic distensibility (AOD) in a group of elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. Aortic distensibility was calculated as AOD = 2 x (delta aortic diameter)/diastolic aortic diameter) x (delta aortic pressure). Results indicate that the aortic diameters were significantly increased while the diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were decreased, in response to combined alpha- and beta-receptor blockade (labetalol). However, we found that AOD was not significantly related to plasma NE. We therefore conclude that AOD can be increased in elderly hypertensives by alpha-beta-blockade, as has been found in younger patients, but plasma NE is not a useful marker for AOD in this population.", 
    "89": "1. The inotropic responses to the beta-adrenoceptor agonists adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline were examined in papillary muscles isolated from hypothyroid rats and euthyroid controls that had been fed diets enriched in either n-6 or n-3 fatty acids. 2. In hypothyroid animals fed the n-6 diet, the maximum developed tension in the presence of isoprenaline was only 54% greater than resting tension compared to 160% in euthyroid animals. Maximum tension was 105% greater than resting in hypothyroid animals fed the n-3 diet compared to 399% in controls. Similar responses to adrenaline and noradrenaline were seen, i.e. maximum tension was significantly greater in both hypothyroid and euthyroid animals fed the n-3 diet, but tension was depressed in the hypothyroid state. 3. Binding of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist [3H]-dihydroalprenolol to ventricular membranes was saturable and of high affinity, irrespective of thyroid state and diet. While binding site density (Bmax) was not affected by the hypothyroid state or diet, binding affinity (Kd) was higher in hypothyroid animals fed the n-6 diet. 4. The inotropic response to forskolin was the same in hypothyroid animals, irrespective of diet, but maximum developed tension was significantly greater in euthyroid animals fed the n-6 compared to the n-3 diet. The dose-response curve for forskolin was shifted to the right in hypothyroid animals fed the n-3 diet indicating a decrease in sensitivity. 5. These results indicate that the depressed contractility in the hypothyroid heart may be due in part to an altered lipid environment of the beta-adrenoceptor complex and that n-3 fatty acids can significantly increase maximum developed tension in the hypothyLroid state.", 
    "90": "The effect of catecholamine stimulation on the longitudinal resistance and compliance distribution in the canine pulmonary vasculature was evaluated under control vascular tone and after vascular tone was elevated using the thromboxane analogue U-46619. The arterial-, venous-, and double-occlusion techniques were used to measure the segmental resistances and compliances in isolated dog lung blood perfused at constant flow. The results of this study indicate that at control vascular tone the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine increase pulmonary vascular resistance and decrease pulmonary vascular compliance through alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor-mediated stimulation with precapillary alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors and postcapillary alpha 2-receptors interacting with precapillary and postcapillary beta 2-receptors. In addition, epinephrine appears to have a greater effect on beta 2-receptors than norepinephrine. When vascular tone was elevated, the effect of norepinephrine and epinephrine on pulmonary vascular resistance was not present, which may be due to the appearance of a more pronounced vasodilatory beta 2-receptor system and an attenuation of the alpha-mediated vasoconstrictor responses. In addition, neither catecholamine had any significant effect on pulmonary vascular compliance when vascular tone was raised. These data suggest that the adrenergic-receptor systems modulating pulmonary vascular resistance and compliance in the canine pulmonary circulation are altered when vascular tone is elevated. As a result, these altered pulmonary vascular responses may affect pulmonary capillary pressure, a major determinant of lung fluid balance.", 
    "91": "To study the effect of chronic exposure to elevated plasma catecholamines on surface beta 2-adrenoceptor density, we measured these receptors in the lymphocytes of 9 patients with pheochromocytoma as well as in 27 healthy control subjects. Binding experiments were performed on intact lymphocytes using the hydrophilic ligand [3H]-CGP12177. Lymphocyte beta 2-adrenergic response was also measured in three patients. beta 2-adrenoceptor density (p < 0.01), and isoproterenol-stimulated increase in cAMP were reduced in patients with pheochromocytoma. Both parameters normalized (p < 0.05) when patients were reevaluated 4 weeks after tumor removal, coinciding with normalization of plasma epinephrine (r = -0.95, p < 0.01) and to log of plasma norepinephrine (r = -0.58, p < 0.05) in patients. We conclude that chronic catecholamine excess induces a decrease of lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor surface number and response that is reversible upon normalization of plasma catecholamine levels. This regulation is mainly dependent on plasma levels of the hormone epinephrine, but norepinephrine may also play a regulatory role at supraphysiological levels.", 
    "92": "1. In order to clarify whether atypical or beta 3-adrenoceptors can modulate canine colonic motility in vivo, we studied the effects of SR 58611A (a selective agonist for atypical beta-adrenoceptors) alone and after pretreatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on colonic motility in the conscious dog. The gastrocolonic response (postprandial increase in motility) was monitored by means of electrodes and strain-gauge force transducers chronically implanted along the distal colon. In some experiments, heart rate was also measured. The possible role of beta 3-adrenoceptors in mediating the effects of SR 58611A was also tested in vitro in circular muscle strips taken from the canine distal colon. 2. Intravenous infusion of SR 58611A, ritodrine or isoprenaline at doses inducing the same degree of tachycardia inhibited the gastrocolonic response to a different extent, with SR 58611A and ritodrine being more effective than isoprenaline. 3. In a dose-response study, SR 58611A was more potent in inhibiting colonic motility than in inducing tachycardia: the ED35 values for inhibition of colonic motility and induction of tachycardia were 23 and 156 micrograms kg-1, i.v., respectively. 4. The inhibitory effect of SR 58611A 100 micrograms kg-1, i.v., on the gastrocolonic response was reversed by alprenolol (non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), but resistant to CGP 20712A (beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) or ICI 118551 (beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist). 5. In vitro, SR 58611A concentration-dependently relaxed circular muscle strips, an effect that was competitively antagonized by alprenolol with a pA2 value of 7.1, but resistant to CGP 20712A (100 nM), ICI 118551 (100 nM) or tetrodotoxin (1 microM). 6. The present study provides strong functional evidence for a role of atypical or beta 3-adrenoceptors in the modulation of canine colonic motility both in vivo and in vitro by an inhibitory effect most likely at the smooth muscle level.", 
    "93": "Cardioventilatory responses to hypoxia, the O2 chemoreceptor stimulant sodium cyanide (NaCN), and intra-arterial injection of atropine, noradrenaline and DL-propranolol were investigated in the adriatic sturgeon. Hypoxia elicited a bradycardia and hyperventilation. 1 mg NaCN added to water entering the buccal cavity stimulated a transient bradycardia but intra-arterial infusion of 150 micrograms NaCN did not, indicating that hypoxic bradycardia is controlled by chemoreceptors sensitive only to water O2 levels. NaCN stimulated hyperventilation both when added to the water and when infused intra-arterially, indicating that hypoxic hyperventilation is controlled by chemoreceptors sensitive to both internal and external milieux. Atropine abolished the hypoxic bradycardia and returned heart rate to normoxic values indicating that this species has no inhibitory vagal tone in normoxia. Noradrenaline stimulated ventilation, an effect abolished by DL-propranolol. Propranolol blocked ventilatory responses to intra-arterial infusion of NaCN whereas responses to NaCN added to the water remained unaffected, indicating that propranolol may inhibit internally-oriented O2-chemoreceptor activity or that ventilatory responses to intra-arterial NaCN are stimulated by a release of circulating catecholamines. Cardioventilatory control systems in sturgeon are similar to those of other actinopterygians but also show some characteristics of the system described for elasmobranchs.", 
    "94": "Regioselective and stereoselective oxidations of pseudoracemic metoprolol, (R)-bufuralol, and (S)-bufuralol by microsomes of h2D6v2 cells--a human lymphoblastoma cell line transfected with a cytochrome P4502D6 expression system--were examined. The formation kinetics of O-demethylmetoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol were characterized in five different lots of the cDNA-expressed P4502D6. Comparison of the Vmax/KM values indicated that formation of the products from (R)-metoprolol was preferred. Although the favored regiomer overall was O-demethylmetoprolol, the regioselectivity for O-demethylation of metoprolol by the cDNA-expressed enzyme was several-fold less than that observed for the P4502D6 enzyme in human liver microsomes at 20 microM pseudoracematic metoprolol concentration. Oxidation of (R)-metoprolol produced more O-demethylmetoprolol than alpha-hydroxymetoprolol; however, for (S)-metoprolol-d2, a slight preference for alpha-hydroxylation was observed. The O-demethylation and alpha-hydroxylation of metoprolol were inhibited at low microM concentrations of (+/-)-verapamil, a known inhibitor of metoprolol oxidation. (R)- and (S)-Bufuralol were oxidized to their respective diastereomeric 1\"-hydroxybufuralols by all 4 lots of h2D6v2 microsomal preparations. Diastereomeric (1'R)-hydroxybufuralols were formed in twice the amount as the hydroxylated diastereomers of (1'S)-products. Product stereoselectivity was observed for the (1'R,1\"S)- and (1'S,1\"R)-isomers. Although the observed enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity of the bufuralol oxidation seem to be consistent with those previously reported for human liver microsomes, the regioselectivity of the metoprolol oxidations is unexpectedly low.", 
    "95": "The cardiovascular response to endotoxemia was evaluated in an awake, intravascular volume-resuscitated canine model. The animals were chronically instrumented for ultrasonic crystal dimension analysis and pressure measurements of the left ventricle (LV), aorta, right atrium (RA), and pulmonary artery (PA) and for cardiac output (CO) measurement. Lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 011:B4) (LPS) was administered intravenously either as an acute, high dose bolus (5 mg/kg; n = 5), a high dose bolus after complete beta-blockade with propranolol (n = 3), or a chronic, low dose infusion (5 micrograms/kg/h; n = 7). Relative to baseline values, cardiac contractility was increased after acute high dose LPS bolus, however this effect was negated by beta-blockade. Chronic, low dose LPS infusion produced an increase in cardiac contractility at 1 h, a return to baseline by 4 h, and maximal contractile depression by 24 h. No change was seen in LV compliance after the high dose LPS bolus. The LV end diastolic volume was decreased by the high dose LPS bolus. This change was blocked by propranolol administration. Chronic LPS administration was accompanied by a decrease in LV compliance and an increase in LV end diastolic volume. Other cardiovascular indices (heart rate, CO, systemic vascular resistance) changed in a fashion similar to human sepsis. These findings confirm that endotoxemia in conscious canine subjects causes changes in cardiovascular function similar to that seen in human and animal models of sepsis. This study also allows us to explain some of the discrepancies between earlier studies of human sepsis and animal models in which the appropriate clinical conditions and an intact neuro-endocrine axis were not maintained.", 
    "96": "Thymic programmed cell death (PCD) or apoptosis (Ao) is elevated during inflammation by a variety of stressors in vitro (i.e., glucocorticoids, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), prostanoids, etc.), however, little or no information is available concerning its presence in polymicrobial sepsis. To establish whether or not PCD is accelerated in the thymus following the onset of sepsis, thymocytes were harvested from C3H/HeN mice at 1, 2, 12, and 24 h following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP; to induce sepsis) or Sham-CLP (Sham), and assessed for changes in thymocyte viable cell yield, increased Ao + cells based on FACS analysis (propidium iodide staining) or by evidence of fragmentation of the genomic DNA. The results indicate that at 1 h post-CLP there were no marked changes in any of these parameters. However, by 4 h post-CLP the percentage of Ao + thymocytes increased and the septic mouse genomic DNA exhibited trace amounts of fragmentation. These changes increased in the septic animals cells through both 12 and 24 h. Alternatively, thymic viable cell yield did not significantly decrease until 12 h. Marked changes in systemic mediators, corticosterone and TNF, were also detected in septic mouse blood at all time points. In an effort to determine the contribution of these two agents to the induction of the accelerated PCD seen here, mice were randomized to receive either RU-38486 (11 beta-[p-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-17 beta-hydroxy-17-(1-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3-one (Mifepristone); a steroid receptor blocker), polyethylene glycol (PEG)-(rsTNF-R1)2 (a TNF inhibitor) immediately following CLP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

After the diagnostic head-up tilt, patients were assigned to different therapeutic approaches according to their preference or logistic impediments. Of 303 patients, 44 received empiric therapy, 210 were treated with medications proven effective during repeated head-up tilt testing, and 49 refused or discontinued medical therapy. The three groups were similar with regard to age, sex, and clinical presentation. The mean follow-up was 2.8 +/- 1.8 years. Among the patients treated according to head-up tilt guided therapy, 130 were on beta blockers, 35 on theophylline, 10 on ephedrine, 31 on disopyramide, and 4 on miscellaneous regimens.

    "102": "We examined the antiproliferative effect of the novel multiple-action antihypertensive agent carvedilol on human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Carvedilol inhibited the increase in cell number induced by foetal calf serum (FCS) in 86% (18 of 21) of human VSMC grown both from saphenous vein (17.6 +/- 3.5% inhibition, mean +/- SEM, n = 15) and restenotic lesions (31.4 +/- 5.5% inhibition, mean +/- SEM, n = 5). Carvedilol had a greater antiproliferative effect than other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. In comparison with calcium channel blockers, carvedilol (10 microM) elicited a degree of growth inhibition similar to that of verapamil, but was less effective than the dihydropyridine amlodipine at equimolar concentrations. Although carvedilol had a greater antiproliferative effect on cells derived from restenotic lesions cells than on control saphenous vein cells, the difference was not statistically significant. In the present study, the antiproliferative effect of carvedilol on human VSMC in vitro occurred at concentrations higher than those in plasma. Although this may represent a limitation to the clinical efficacy of carvedilol against proliferation of VSMC associated with hypertension and atherosclerosis, the apparent relative selectivity of carvedilol for restenosis-derived cells is a promising line of investigation.", 
    "103": "We compared the antihypertensive activity of DL- and D-nebivolol in patients with essential hypertension on clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and during dynamic exercise as well. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 30 patients (mean age 48 years) were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment with either DL-nebivolol 5 mg or D-nebivolol 2.5 mg once daily for 4 weeks. After an interim single-blind placebo washout of 2-4 weeks, all patients crossed over double-blind to the alternative DL- or D-nebivolol treatment for 4 weeks. The results show that DL- and D-nebivolol produced similar reductions in clinic trough (delta systolic/delta diastolic BP (delta SBP/delta DBP): -10/-8 and -13/-9 mm Hg, respectively, all p < 0.0001 vs. placebo), 24-h ambulatory (-12/-11 and -13/-11 mm Hg, respectively, all p < 0.0001), and peak exercise BP (-13/-6, both p < 0.01; and -13/-7 mm Hg, both p < 0.0001, respectively) as compared with placebo (SBP/DBP clinic 147/99, ambulatory 147/94, exercise 211/103 mm Hg). Our results showing superimposable clinic and ambulatory BP profiles as well as exercise BP responses with DL- and D-nebivolol treatment do not confirm results of animal pharmacologic experiments in which the L-isomer potentiated the antihypertensive effect of the D-isomer.", 
    "104": "We wished to determine if drugs with negative inotropic properties would exacerbate the transient myocardial depression associated with intravenous (i.v.) cocaine administration. The influence of propranolol, nifedipine, or verapamil pretreatment on the myocardial depressant effect of cocaine was examined in 13 chronically instrumented, conscious dogs. Cocaine alone (4 mg/kg i.v.) caused significant increases in heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and rate-pressure product (RPP), effects consistent with sympathetic stimulation. Regional ejection fraction (EF) (determined by two-dimensional echocardiography), however, decreased from 56 +/- 5% (mean +/- SE) at baseline to 34 +/- 6% at 1 min and to 41 +/- 5% at 2 min after cocaine administration but recovered to 49 +/- 4% at 10 min. Pretreatment with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) blunted the rate-pressure response to cocaine by 28%. Regional EF decreased from 53 +/- 5% at baseline to 26 +/- 3% (p < 0.01 as compared with cocaine alone) at 2 min after cocaine and was still reduced at 33 +/- 3% (p < 0.001 as compared with cocaine alone) at 10 min. Pretreatment with verapamil (10 mg i.v. 10 min before cocaine) blunted the rate-pressure response very little, but regional left ventricular (LV) EF decreased less, from 58 +/- 3% to only 46 +/- 5% at 2 min, and was almost normal at 10 min (57 +/- 5%). Nifedipine [90 mg sustained-release orally (p.o.) administered 5 h earlier] also reduced the myocardial depressant effect of cocaine at 2 min [regional EF decreased from 50 +/- 2% at baseline to 38 +/- 4% (cocaine alone), 56 +/- 3 to 49 +/- 4% (nifedipine and cocaine), p < 0.05].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "105": "The effects of poisoning with beta-blockers may be serious, but are usually self-limiting provided adequate support is given.

Pindolol pretreatment lowered baseline PRL levels but, when this effect was taken into account, did not significantly attenuate the PRL response to d-FEN. Within the limitations that attend the use of pindolol as a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, the data suggest that although 5-HT1A receptors may play a role in the tonic release of PRL, they are not involved in the release of PRL produced by d-FEN. We propose that the PRL response to d-FEN may involve selective activation of postsynaptic 5-HT2 receptors.", 
    "107": "Treatment with beta-blockers affects oxygen metabolism and lipolysis during physical exertion. Together with possible central nervous system effects, this may impair the work capacity of treated hypertensive subjects. In a study of 1619 male employees, aged 45-64 years, mean resting and ambulatory heart rate (HR) and complaints of fatigue were compared between hypertensive workers treated with beta-blockers and untreated hypertensives and normotensives under low and high workload conditions. Treated hypertensives had lower mean resting HRs compared with normotensives and untreated hypertensives. Their change from resting to ambulatory HR during low and high workload was also lower than normotensives and untreated hypertensives, and they had higher fatigue scores than their untreated counterparts at both workload levels. The highest fatigue score was reported by treated subjects under high workload. These findings demonstrate a reduced HR response to physical work accompanied by more symptoms of fatigue during treatment with beta-blockers. When hypertensives are engaged in physically demanding work, other classes of antihypertensive therapy should be considered.", 
    "108": "The nature of neurogenic relaxation was investigated in ring preparations of canine lingual artery. In all experiments, the preparations were previously treated with guanethidine (5 x 10(-6) M) to block neurogenic constrictor responses. In the presence of norepinephrine (10(-5) M) to induce tone, electrical stimulation (10 V, 4 to 16 Hz, for 45 sec) produced relaxation of the rings in an endothelium-independent fashion. The relaxant response in endothelium-denuded rings was not changed by propranolol (10(-5) M), and atropine (10(-5) M) did not affect the relaxation elicited by electrical stimulation in endothelium-intact rings. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (10(-4) M) or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10(-4) M), a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, had no effect on the electrical stimulation-induced relaxation of endothelium-denuded rings. Human calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-(8 - 37) (2 x 10(-8) M), a CGRP1-receptor antagonist, inhibited neurogenic relaxation of endothelium-denuded rings; substance P (10(-6) M) failed to mimic the observed effect of electrical stimulation. The demonstrated effect of electrical stimulation was inhibited by glibenclamide (10(-5) M), but not tetraethylammonium (2 x 10(-4) M); glibenclamide abolished the relaxation in response to exogenous CGRP or the ATP-sensitive K+ channel opener cromakalim (10(-6) M) in endothelium-denuded rings. Moreover, tetrodotoxin (3.13 x 10(-6) M) inhibited the relaxation of endothelium-denuded rings induced by electrical stimulation. The relaxation was selectively inhibited when endogenous CGRP had been depleted from perivascular nerves by capsaicin (10(-6) M). These results suggest that CGRP, but not NO, released from non-adrenergic non-cholinergic nerves by electrical stimulation produces relaxation of canine lingual artery that is mediated by activation of CGRP1 receptors.", 
    "109": "The present case describes a new and unusual variant of thyrotoxicosis: transient hyperthyroxinemia following acute and massive hemorrhage into a previously normal thyroid gland. A 74-year-old woman presented with a large painful neck mass, palpitations, rapid atrial fibrillation, and hyperthyroxinemia following a fall and neck trauma while treated with excessive oral anticoagulants. Ultrasound and computerized tomography of the neck were consistent with a massive intrathyroidal hematoma. Elevation in serum T4 and T3 levels with suppressed TSH normalized over 3-4 weeks in parallel with hematoma shrinkage. Her tests were consistent with extensive bleeding into thyroidal tissue producing release of stored hormone. Her clinical course was compatible with the known disappearance rate of thyroxine and she returned to her euthyroid status without antithyroid therapy.", 
    "110": "Although the autonomic nervous system is known to influence airway tone and resistance in both the normal and inflamed lung, its effects on tissue resistance (Rti) have not been defined. To characterize autonomic neural control of Rti in the lung, we measured airway resistance (Raw) and Rti, lung elastance, and lung hysteresivity after adrenergic, cholinergic, and nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) blockade in anesthetized mechanically ventilated guinea pigs by using the alveolar capsule technique. Five animals received 1 mg/kg i.v. phentolamine (alpha-blocker), eight received 1 mg/kg i.v. propranolol (beta-blocker), six received 0.1 mg/kg i.v. atropine (parasympatholytic), six had surgical bilateral vagotomy, and five were treated 14 days before study with 50 mg/kg sc capsaicin (peptidergic neurotransmitter depleter). Measurements were recorded at 5- to 10-min intervals for 120 min after pharmacological induction of autonomic blockade. Capsaicin treatment resulted in decreases in lung resistance (RL), Raw, and dynamic elastance (Edyn) compared with controls but Rti was not significantly affected. beta-Blockade resulted in significant increases in RL, Raw, and Edyn but did not affect Rti. alpha-Blockade and vagolytic maneuvers had no effect on RL, Raw, Rti, or Edyn. Furthermore, there was no effect of cholinergic, adrenergic, or NANC blockade on the relationship between Rti or elastance and breathing frequency or mean lung volume during tidal breathing. Our results suggest that, in the normal guinea pig lung, baseline Raw is modulated by both the beta-adrenergic and NANC nervous systems but Rti tone is largely independent of nervous system regulation.", 
    "111": "Several studies have shown that beta-blockade could provide functional benefit in heart failure, suggesting a deleterious role for the compensatory sympathetic stimulation. Betablockers induced benefit could result from either antagonism of myocardial beta-adrenergic stimulation or, on the contrary a paradoxical increased cardiac beta-adrenergic responsiveness secondary to beta-adrenergic receptor up-regulation. Two recently completed large scale multicentric placebo controlled studies, the MDC trial with metoprolol and CIBIS with bisoprolol, have confirmed that beta-blockade could functionally improve patients with heart failure. The observed survival improvement in non-ischaemic patients was observed only in the CIBIS trial. This result requires confirmation by additional studies.", 
    "112": "New agents for treating chronic heart failure include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, betablockers and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The ACE inhibitors represent the major therapeutic advance of the 1980-1990 decade. This is the most effective class of drugs on survival, whatever the stage of heart failure and it shows the evolution towards symptoms in asymptomatic patients. Studies currently under way are evaluating the dose-effect relationship of ACE inhibitors. Betablockers improve the quality of life and physical performance but a benefit on mortality has not been shown in two recent trials. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors improve quality of life and physical performance at the price of an increase in mortality. Therefore, they are not indicated in the treatment of heart failure. However, new molecules such as vesnarininone or pimobendan are under trial. Finally, in the next few years, the introduction of antagonists to Angiotensin II receptors is eagerly awaited.", 
    "113": "Recent studies have shown that dual-chamber cardiac pacing could improve patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy resistant to medical treatment. After a brief historical review, the authors report the present status of this original therapeutic option. The results of different studies are in agreement and show that the functional improvement is associated with a large reduction of the intraventricular pressure gradient with permanent DDD pacing. Although the exact mechanism of the improvement remains unknown, all groups underline the importance of complete and permanent ventricular capture. This requires precise regulation of the atrioventricular delay which in most cases must be programmed at a value inferior to 90 ms, which compromises ventricular filling which is already abnormal under basal conditions. The inefficacy of pacing in some cases is explained by the necessity of selecting a very short atrioventricular delay which alters diastolic function and finally masks the benefits of ventricular capture. In this particular situation, the authors propose improving atrioventricular synchrony by pharmacological prolongation of the PR interval, or, when unsuccessful, by ablation of the atrioventricular junction. This attitude was adopted in 5 cases when pacing with an AVD programmed between 20 and 70 ms, provided only a partial haemodynamic result. Improved atrioventricular synchrony allowed selection of an AVD of 100 to 150 ms, so reducing the gradient by more than 70%, compared with 30% under the initial programming parameters. The authors conclude that a positive and sustained benefit of cardiac pacing can only be obtained by an individualised regulation of pacing parameters to optimize atrioventricular synchrony which seems to be the key element of success.", 
    "114": "The development of echocardiography and kindred studies have enabled the detection of an increasing number of asymptomatic forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Drug therapy, by far the commonest therapeutic method of managing this condition, has only been shown to be effective on the symptoms. Therefore, due to the risk of iatrogenic disease, medication is only proposed to symptomatic patients: high dose betablockers is the usual treatment; when ineffective or contra-indicated, verapamil may be prescribed at progressively increasing doses under strict medical control. These products may need to be given at high doses in order to be effective but excessive bradycardia may be a limiting factor. Amiodarone alone or in association, may be preferred in forms with arrhythmias. The comparative efficacy of the different drugs, especially in preventing sudden death, requires well designed, controlled, therapeutic trials. Their results, if positive, would question the dogma of only treating symptomatic patients.", 
    "115": "Parathion, an organophosphorous insecticide, was previously shown to enhance the nighttime rise in pineal N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and serum melatonin levels. The purpose of the present study was to test whether parathion acts on the pineal gland by means of a beta-adrenergic receptor mechanism. Whereas parathion (total dose 6.5 mg/kg body wt over 6 days) by itself significantly augmented nocturnal pineal NAT activity and serum melatonin levels in otherwise untreated rats, the insecticide was ineffective in reference to this enzyme when it was given in conjunction with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (20 mg/kg body wt, 1 h before lights off). The augmentation of NAT activity by parathion also caused significant reductions in pineal serotonin (5-HT); again, this response was blocked by propranolol treatment. Neither pineal hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT) activity nor pineal levels of 5-hydroxytryptophan or hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) were significantly changed as a result of either parathion or propranolol treatment. The results are consistent with the idea that parathion influences pineal 5-HT metabolism either at the level of the beta-adrenergic receptor or via the sympathetic innervation to the pineal gland.", 
    "116": "Cardiac arrhythmias are a frequent cause of death and morbidity. Conventional antiarrhythmia therapy involving oral or intravenous medication is often ineffective and complicated by drug-associated side effects. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated the advantages of cardiac drug-polymer implants for enhanced efficacy for cardiac arrhythmia therapy compared with conventional administration. However, these studies were based on systems that deliver drugs at a fixed release rate. Modulation of the drug delivery rate has the advantage of regulating the amount of the drug delivered depending upon the disease state of the patient. We hypothesized that iontophoresis could be used to modulate cardiac drug delivery. In this study, we report our investigations of a cardiac drug implant in dogs that is capable of iontophoretic modulation of the administration of the antiarrhythmic agent sotalol. We used a heterogeneous cation-exchange membrane (HCM) as an electrically sensitive and highly efficient rate-limiting barrier on the cardiac-contacting surface of the implant. Thus, electric current is passed only through the HCM and not the myocardium. The iontophoretic cardiac implant demonstrated in vitro drug release rates that were responsive to current modulation. In vivo results in dogs have confirmed that iontophoresis resulted in regional coronary enhancement of sotalol levels with current-responsive increases in drug concentrations. We also observed acute current-dependent changes in ventricular effective refractory periods reflecting sotalol-induced refractoriness due to regional drug administration. In 30-day dog experiments, iontophoretic cardiac implants demonstrated robust sustained function and reproducible modulation of drug delivery kinetics.", 
    "117": "Previous in vivo studies have shown that microiontophoretic application of norepinephrine (NE) and isoproterenol (ISO) can enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced depressant responses of rat somatosensory cortical neurons. In the present investigation we have examined the transmembrane electrophysiological events which are associated with interactions between NE and GABA in layer V pyramidal neurons of rat barrel field cortex. Intracellular recordings were made from electrophysiologically identified cells in a superfused cortical tissue slice preparation before, during and after bath or microdrop application of GABA, NE and ISO, alone or in combination. GABA application produced a small depolarization from resting membrane potential associated with a reduction (22%) in input resistance. NE and ISO (10-100 microM) also produced in some cases small membrane depolarizations (1-4 mV) but little concomitant changes in input resistance. Simultaneous application of NE with GABA potentiated amino acid-induced changes in input resistance in 4 cases and antagonized (n = 4) or had no effect (n = 4) on GABA-associated membrane events in 8 other cases. When the alpha-blocker, phentolamine (20 microM), was added to the medium, NE-induced enhancement of the GABA response was observed in 3 of 5 cases (60%), suggesting both, a beta-adrenergic mediation and a possible alpha-receptor masking of this noradrenergic-potentiating action. Consistent with this interpretation was the finding that the beta-agonist, ISO (10-100 microM), produced net increases in GABA-induced input resistance changes in 64% of cases tested (9 of 14). The potentiating effect of NE and ISO was mimicked by the adenyl cyclase activator, forskolin (n = 2), and a membrane permeant analog of cyclic-AMP, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (n = 3); and could also be demonstrated when the GABAA agonist muscimol (0.5-1 microM) was substituted for GABA. The reversal potential for GABA and GABA + NE remained the same. These findings suggest that previous demonstrations of NE-potentiating effects on GABA inhibition may be mediated by beta-receptor/cyclic-AMP-linked actions on mechanisms which regulate GABAA receptor-induced membrane conductance changes.", 
    "118": "Most G protein-coupled receptors, including the mammalian beta 2-adrenergic receptor, are endocytosed to an intracellular, vesicular compartment upon continued exposure to agonist. The long form of the avian beta 1-adrenergic receptor, which contains a carboxyl-terminal 59-amino acid extension, does not undergo agonist-promoted endocytosis. We constructed and expressed turkey beta 1-adrenergic receptor cDNAs with regularly spaced carboxyl-terminal truncations and studied their agonist-promoted endocytosis. Removal of 34-86 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the turkey receptor allowed its efficient endocytosis, with optimal endocytosis observed upon removal of 59 residues. Removal of only 18 residues allowed some endocytosis. A receptor that lacks the entire carboxyl-terminal region (124 residues) was not endocytosed. We also constructed a chimeric hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor with the added 59-residue carboxyl-terminal domain of the turkey receptor. The chimera was not significantly endocytosed. These data indicate that residues 450-465 in the carboxyl-terminal region of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor can act independently to block agonist-promoted endocytosis and that other carboxyl-terminal structures nearer to the seventh membrane span are required for endocytosis.", 
    "119": "Using echocardiographic and Doppler methodology, we evaluated the effects of celiprolol 200-400 mg/day and metoprolol 100-200 mg/day, given for one year, on haemodynamics, left ventricular structure and function, and aortic root distensibility in 40 hypertensive patients. Total peripheral resistance was unchanged with metoprolol (-1.7%) but decreased with celiprolol (-11.2%), a significant difference between the two treatments (P = 0.01). Left ventricular mass index was reduced by 5.7% in those patients receiving metoprolol and by 11.8% in those receiving celiprolol (P < 0.001). Cardiac index fell significantly with metoprolol and marginally with celiprolol (-13.9% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.003). Left ventricular diastolic function-as shown by the transmitral early to late peak filling velocity ratio-was not altered with metoprolol, but a significant increase (17%, P = 0.2) was seen with celiprolol. Both metoprolol and celiprolol increased aortic root distensibility, with celiprolol having a significantly greater effect (80% vs. 30%, P < 0.01). We conclude that, in comparison to metoprolol, long term antihypertensive therapy with celiprolol improves left ventricular diastolic and aortic root function, whilst reducing total peripheral resistance and left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "120": "Echocardiography performed in acute myocardial infarction helps to make the diagnosis, to detect complications of acute myocardial infarction and to choose adequate therapy. The authors evaluate the echocardiographic results of 47 patients at bedside exam. Wall motion abnormalities were revealed in 16 of 19 Q-infarct cases. Echocardiography performed in 28 suspected cases of myocardial infarction showed segmental wall motion abnormalities in 14 cases, out of them infarction was diagnosed later in 9 patient and non-Q myocardial infarction in 3 cases. Heparin was given in all cases, but thrombolysis was applied in only 9 patients. Left ventricular thrombus was found in 3 patients with anterior myocardial infarction, neither of whom had received thrombolytic therapy. The following mechanical complications were detected: free wall rupture in one patient, ventricular septal defect in three patients, early left ventricular aneurysm in one patients and right ventricular infarction in one patient. 14 patients with decreased left ventricular function were not subsequently given beta receptor blockers.", 
    "121": "Immunohistochemically identified glucagon-releasing alpha 2-cells from mouse pancreatic islets exhibited large amplitude oscillations of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in 3 mM glucose. Other small islet cells with similar oscillations in the presence of 20 mM glucose were identified as somatostatin-releasing alpha 1-cells. The oscillations in both cell types resembled those induced by glucose in the surrounding larger beta-cells in starting from the basal level and disappearing after addition of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker methoxyverapamil. The discovery that the alpha 1- and alpha 2-cells have intrinsic abilities to generate oscillatory Ca2+ signals indicates that pulsatile release of somatostatin and glucagon do not require functional coupling to the beta-cells.", 
    "122": "G-protein-coupled receptors are thought to have an inactive conformation (R), requiring an agonist-induced conformational change for receptor/G-protein coupling. But new evidence suggests a two-state model in which receptors are in equilibrium between the inactive conformation (R), and a spontaneously active conformation (R*) that can couple to G protein in the absence of ligand (Fig. 1). Classic agonists have a high affinity for R* and increase the concentration of R*, whereas inverse agonists have a high affinity for R and decrease the concentration of R*. Neutral competitive antagonists have equal affinity for R and R* and do not displace the equilibrium, but can competitively antagonize the effects both of agonists and of inverse agonists. The lack of suitable in vivo model systems has restricted the evidence for the existence of inverse agonists to computer simulations and in vitro systems. We have used a transgenic mouse model in which there is such marked myocardial overexpression of beta 2-adrenoceptors that a significant population of spontaneously activated receptor (R*) is present, inducing a maximal response without agonist. We show that the beta 2-adrenoceptor ligand ICI-118,551 functions as an inverse agonist, providing evidence supporting the existence of inverse agonists and validating the two-state model of G-protein-coupled receptor activation.", 
    "123": "Male rats housed in mixed-sex groups quickly established dominance hierarchies in which subordinates appeared severely stressed. Subordinate rats had elevated basal corticosterone (CORT) levels relative to dominants and individually housed controls. Several subordinates had blunted CORT responses to a novel stressor, leading to the classification of subordinates as either stress-responsive or nonresponsive. Binding to 5-HT1A receptors was reduced in stress-responsive subordinates compared to controls throughout hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Decreased binding was observed in nonresponsive subordinates only in CA3 of hippocampus. In addition, 5-HT1A binding was decreased in CA1, CA3, and CA4 in dominants compared to controls. Binding to 5-HT2 receptors was increased in parietal cortex in both responsive and nonresponsive subordinates compared to controls. No changes were observed in binding to 5-HT1B receptors. These results are discussed in the context of regulation of the serotonergic system by stress and glucocorticoids and possible relevance to the pathophysiology of depression.", 
    "124": "Graded caval occlusion in conscious rabbits caused a biphasic cardiovascular response. Phase I was characterized by a fall in systemic vascular conductance so that arterial pressure was maintained. When cardiac output had fallen to 64 +/- 3% of its baseline level, phase II supervened. During phase II, conductance rose abruptly and arterial pressure fell to a life-threatening level (< 40 mm Hg). Intravenous (i.v.) or central (fourth ventricular) administration of the adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) fragment ACTH-(1-24) prevented the occurrence of phase II. The central dose of ACTH-(1-24) needed to block the occurrence of phase II was approximately 39 times less than the i.v. dose. Central administration of the delta 1-opioid receptor agonist [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) reversed this effect of both central and i.v. ACTH-(1-24). I.v. ACTH-(1-24) also lowered arterial pressure while raising cardiac output and vascular conductance. These effects were insensitive to propranolol and hyoscine methyl bromide, and were not mimicked by cortisol or adrenaline. It is concluded that ACTH-(1-24) has an acute, adrenal-independent, peripheral vasodilator effect as well as a central, anti-shock, effect."
