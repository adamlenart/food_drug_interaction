Ten patients with primary arterial hypertension of mild to moderate degree entered a randomized double-blind cross-over study versus placebo. They were given oxprenolol + placebo or oxprenolol + sulphinpyrazone for 15 days, and then the treatments were crossed-over for a further 15 days. Oxprenolol significantly reduced blood pressure (161 +/- 3/101 +/- 1 vs 149 +/- 4/96 +/- 2 mmHg) and heart rate (72 +/- 3 vs 66 +/- 3 beats/min). During administration of the combination with sulphinpyrazone the blood pressure increased to its pretreatment level (156 +/- 5/101 +/- 2 mmHg). The effect of oxprenolol on heart rate was not influenced by the combined treatment (67 +/- 6 beats/min). The results may be explained by 1) sulphinpyrazone-induced inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which could interfere with the antihypertensive activity of oxprenolol, or 2) sulphinpyrazone-induced acceleration of the metabolism of oxprenolol.", 
    "1": "In 1981, a large, double-blind, randomized trial was started in The Netherlands to evaluate the therapeutic effects of nifedipine and/or metoprolol in patients with unstable angina. This study has been called the Holland Interuniversity Nifedipine/metoprolol Trial (HINT) and required several hundred patients to establish potential therapeutic effects. From December 1982 to January 1984 the effects of nifedipine on left ventricular (LV) performance in a subgroup of 52 HINT patients were studied using radionuclide techniques. All patients (23 on nifedipine, 29 controls) underwent thallium-201 scintigraphy or radionuclide angiography just before and 48 h after the start of experimental medication. The radionuclide angiographic studies were also performed at 1 and 4 h after treatment. Nifedipine did not influence the incidence or disappearance of perfusion defects on the 48-h thallium images. No significant differences in overall LV ejection fraction (EF) were seen at any time between nifedipine-treated patients and controls. However, paired observations in 37 patients showed improvement of LVEF after 48 h in 8 patients on nifedipine and in only 1 control patient. Scintigraphic measurements on admission were not related to clinical outcome after 48 h. Concomitant administration of metoprolol did not influence LVEF in either group. It is concluded that nifedipine improves LVEF after 48 h in a subset of patients with unstable angina without affecting myocardial perfusion. This finding indicates that nifedipine has a predominant effect on afterload reduction in patients with unstable angina. However, early scintigraphic measurements had no significant predictive value for subsequent cardiac events.", 
    "2": "A double-blind, parallel group comparison study was carried out in 20 diabetic patients with mild to moderate hypertension to assess the effectiveness and tolerance of acebutolol compared with placebo. After a 4-week wash-out period on placebo, patients received either 400 mg acebutolol or placebo once daily for 12 weeks and then placebo for a further 4 weeks. The results showed that acebutolol was more effective than placebo in lowering raised blood pressure in these patients. No deterioration in diabetic control occurred during the study and no significant side-effects of the drug were observed compared with placebo. In particular, the previously described side-effects of beta-blocker therapy in diabetic patients were not observed as a clinical problem in this study.", 
    "3": "We have studied the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the pyrexial response to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Temperatures of 22 patients treated with timolol, 20 mg daily, in the acute phase of AMI were compared to temperatures of 22 patients not receiving timolol treatment. Fever response after AMI was significantly reduced in the timolol-treated patients, maximal and mean temperature in the febrile period being lower and the febrile period being shorter. Reduction of fever in AMI may be of importance as a higher body temperature increases the risk of developing heart failure and arrhythmias. The study lends support to the use of beta-adrenoceptor blockade in AMI. It also substantiates a possible role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the regulation of body temperature during fever.", 
    "4": "To investigate the involvement of adrenergic mechanisms in the development of obesity, hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia in Aston ob/ob mice, the sympathomimetic agent ephedrine (12 mg/kg/day) and the predominantly beta 1-adrenergic antagonist atenolol (12 mg/kg/day) were administered alone and in combination to weanling ob/ob mice for 40 days. Excessive weight gain in ob/ob mice was reduced (15-20%) by ephedrine, exacerbated (8-10%) by atenolol, but not significantly altered by a combination of these agents. The effects of ephedrine and atenolol were lost rapidly (within 5 days) when these agents were withdrawn. Ephedrine slightly reduced the hyperphagia in ob/ob mice, and food intake was transiently increased above that of untreated ob/ob mice when this agent was withdrawn. The development of basal hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia was not significantly altered by any of the treatments studied. None of the treatments significantly altered body weight, food intake, plasma glucose or plasma insulin concentrations in lean (+/+) mice. The results indicate that a defective adrenergic mechanism involving beta 1-adrenergic receptors contributes to the development of obesity in ob/ob mice.", 
    "5": "After a run-in period on placebo, 26 patients with essential hypertension were prescribed single-blind tibalosine, 150 mg daily. On tibalosine their blood pressure decreased from 157/101 to 147/93 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and their heart rate from 74 to 68 beats per minute (p less than 0.01), while plasma renin activity tended to fall from 0.81 to 0.65 ng/ml/hr (p = 0.06). Twelve patients, maintained on monotherapy with tibalosine for an average of 3.8 months, kept a diastolic pressure below 90 mm Hg. Ten patients, whose diastolic pressure on tibalosine alone remained equal to or higher than 90 mm Hg were continued on this drug for 6.6 months, but were additionally given in a double-blind and randomized way either placebo, or atenolol 100 mg, or chlorthalidone, 50 mg, daily. As compared to tibalosine plus placebo, blood pressure and heart rate decreased further on tibalosine plus atenolol from 148/97 to 140/90 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and from 70 to 60 beats per minute (p less than 0.05), respectively. The additional blood pressure lowering effect of tibalosine plus chlorthalidone to a level of 143/96 mm Hg was not statistically significant. Eight of 10 patients' blood pressure responded better to tibalosine combined with atenolol than with chlorthalidone. Because of adverse reactions tibalosine was discontinued in 8 of the 26 patients (31%), namely in 4 who prematurely dropped out from the study and in another 4 patients, who remained adherent to the protocol. Somnolence, weary legs and dry mouth were reported more frequently (p less than 0.05) on tibalosine than on placebo.", 
    "6": "tibalosine is an effective anti-hypertensive drug, but side effects preclude its clinical use at a daily dose of 150 mg; the combination with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug seems therapeutically more effective than with a thiazide.", 
    "7": "The effects of acebutolol (with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA] and metoprolol (without ISA) on arm blood pressure, ankle systolic blood pressure, claudication distances (CD) and maximal walking distances (MWD) were compared in patients with essential hypertension and intermittent claudication. Fourteen patients participated in a long-term, open, randomized cross-over study. After randomization the patients received either acebutolol, 200 mg b.i.d., or metoprolol, 100 mg b.i.d. After eight weeks the drugs were shifted and after another eight weeks they were withdrawn. Arm and ankle blood pressure, CD and MWD were determined before randomization and after 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, and again 4-6 weeks after withdrawal of the drugs. The arm blood pressure was reduced by 20/13 mmHg after acebutolol and by 22/21 mmHg after metoprolol. In spite of a significant decrease in arm blood pressure there were no significant changes in ankle blood pressure, CD or MWD after the two drugs. After withdrawal of the drugs and after the arm blood pressure had returned to the control value no significant changes were seen in CD, MWD or ankle blood pressure. It is concluded that beta-blockers have no deleterious effect on CD, MWD or ankle blood pressure in patients with hypertension and intermittent claudication. No effect of ISA was demonstrated.", 
    "8": "The effects of placebo, propranolol and primidone were compared in 14 patients with essential tremor in a double blind, randomised, crossover study. Objective measures of tremor were obtained using an accelerometer with subsequent spectral analysis. Both propranolol (p less than 0.01) and primidone (p less than 0.01) gave significant improvement in tremor, but there was no significant difference in improvement between these drugs. Patients with higher dominant frequencies of tremor tended to respond to both drugs, while those with lower frequencies improved on one or other. There was no differential effect between the drugs with the frequency of tremor.", 
    "9": "Enzyme-catalyzed reformation of peptide bonds in the noncovalent fragment systems of proteins has been emerging as a convenient procedure for the semisynthesis of covalent analogs of the respective proteins. Limited proteolysis of the alpha-chain of hemoglobin S with Staphylococcus aureus V8-protease converts the chain into a fragment-complementing system by hydrolyzing the peptide bond Glu(30)-Arg(31) of the chain. Therefore, it is conceivable that semisynthesis of covalent analogs of alpha-chain could be achieved if conditions for the V8-protease catalyzed formation of peptide bonds could be established. The synthetic potential of V8-protease has been now investigated by incubating V8-protease-derived fragments of alpha-chain, namely alpha 1-30 and alpha 31-47 with the enzyme at pH 6.0 in the presence of n-propanol as the organic cosolvent. RP high performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that a new chromatographically distinct component is generated on incubation, and this has been identified as alpha 1-47 by amino acid analysis, redigestion with V8-protease (in the absence of n-propanol), and tryptic peptide mapping. Optimal conditions for the synthesis of alpha 1-47 is at pH 6.0, 4 degrees C, and 24 hr of incubation with 25% n-propanol as organic cosolvent. This stereospecific condensation of the fragments proceeded to a high level of about 50% in 24 hr. Further incubation up to 72 hr did not increase the yield of alpha 1-47, suggesting that an equilibration of synthesis and hydrolysis reactions has been attained. The demonstration of the synthetic potential of V8-protease and the fact that alpha 1-30 and alpha 31-141 interact to form a native-like complex, opens up an approach for the semisynthesis of covalent analogs of alpha-chain of hemoglobin S.", 
    "10": "In a randomized, double-blind, within-patient study, 28 out-patients with mild to moderate hypertension were given, at the end of a 3-week placebo wash-out period, four different antihypertensive treatments for 3 weeks each. the treatments were 50 mg atenolol, 100 mg atenolol, 12.5 mg chlorthalidone and a fixed combination of 50 mg atenolol and 12.5 mg chlorthalidone. All treatments were given once daily. Visits were scheduled for the last day of each treatment period, 24-26 hours after the last dose, and there was an intermediary wash-out period between each pair of active treatments. Supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 165/102 on placebo, 153/93 mmHg on 50 mg atenolol, 155/91 mmHg on 100 mg atenolol, 148/93 mmHg on 12.5 mg chlorthalidone and 144/89 mmHg on the combination. All the changes in pressure were significant (p less than 0.01) versus placebo. Supine systolic blood pressure was lower on the combination than on 100 mg atenolol alone (p less than 0.05) and upright systolic pressure was lower on the combination than on 100 mg atenolol (p less than 0.05) or 50 mg atenolol (p less than 0.05) alone. The heart rate was lowered by atenolol alone or combined with chlorthalidone but did not fall below 56 bpm in any patient. Serum potassium levels were lower on 12.5 mg chlorthalidone than on placebo (3.88 mEq/l vs 4.09 mEq/l--p less than 0.05) but the difference was trivial; on the combination of atenolol-chlorthalidone there was no significant difference versus placebo (3.97 mEq/l vs 4.09 mEq/l--NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "In white rats both adapted and unadapted to cold and in lemmings the total heat production and skeletal muscles contractile activity under noradrenaline and propranolol were estimated at different ambient temperatures. In rats, the regulatory and adaptive changes of heat production occur due to a significant extension of adrenergically modulated part of contractile thermal effect in muscles, as well as to increased nonshivering thermogenesis. In lemmings, the adaptability to cold is maintained chiefly by nonshivering thermogenesis and leads to no alterations in muscle energetics.", 
    "12": "The variability of chest pain is described in 389 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Whereas 17% were free from severe pain after arrival in hospital, 11% required more than 10 analgesic injections. In 27% of the series analgesics were given more than 24 h after arrival in hospital. Predictors for the severity of chest pain were the rate-pressure product and degree of chest pain soon after arrival in hospital as well as electrocardiographic signs of myocardial infarction at entry. Patients with more severe chest pain had a higher 2-year mortality rate and a higher incidence of ventricular fibrillation and congestive heart failure during hospitalization.", 
    "13": "Electrocardiographic abnormalities, both morphological and rhythmic, are frequently seen in association with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. These changes, which often reflect subendocardial damage, seem to be caused by hypothalamic stimulation leading to an acute increase in sympathetic tone. As a result, potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias may develop in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. These arrhythmias have responded to sympathetic blocking agents, which may also have a protective effect on subendocardial tissue in this setting. There is no evidence that the prophylactic administration of propranolol or other autonomic blockers significantly alters outcome in these patients. Ultimate morbidity and mortality are clearly related to the degree of intracerebral-intraventricular hemorrhage and vasospasm. This article reviews experimental and clinical evidence regarding the causes of cardiac abnormalities after subarachnoid hemorrhage, the types of abnormalities most frequently seen, their relationship with subendocardial lesions, and the role of autonomic blockers.", 
    "14": "Betaxolol hydrochloride (0.5%) and timolol maleate (0.5%) were compared in a six-month randomized, double-blind study involving 29 patients with glaucoma. The two drugs were comparable with regard to efficacy in lowering intraocular pressure. Betaxolol effected an average reduction of 7.6 mm Hg (26%); timolol, 8.4 mm Hg (29%). No patient required adjunctive medications during this study. Ocular side effects were mild and similar for both treatments. Neither drug affected corneal sensitivity, visual acuity, basal tear production, or pupil size. Since betaxolol has been shown to have little effect on the cardiopulmonary system, it should be strongly considered for the treatment of glaucoma.", 
    "15": "In a double-blind, randomized, crossover clinical trial, a new calcium antagonist, nicardipine (90 mg/day in 3 divided doses), was compared with propranolol (120 mg/day in 3 divided doses) in 25 patients with chronic stable angina. The mean weekly frequency of angina episodes decreased from 7.8 +/- 1.2 (+/- standard error of the mean) with placebo to 3.8 +/- 1.2 with nicardipine treatment and 3.5 +/- 1 with propranolol treatment (p less than 0.001). With exercise testing, 5 patients receiving nicardipine and 3 receiving propranolol had no angina or ST-segment changes. Comparing paired samples of both drugs with placebo, significant improvement occurred in exercise duration (nicardipine, 1.3 +/- 0.3 minutes, p less than 0.001; propranolol, 1.0 +/- 0.4 minutes, p less than 0.01), time to onset of angina (nicardipine, 1.5 +/- 0.4 minutes, p less than 0.001; propranolol, 1.5 +/- 0.5 minutes, p less than 0.001), maximal ST-segment changes (nicardipine, 0.7 +/- 0.1 mm, p less than 0.01; propranolol, 0.06 +/- 0.1 mm, p less than 0.01) and time to 1 mm of ST depression (nicardipine, 2.5 +/- 0.4 minutes, p less than 0.01; propranolol, 2.0 +/- 0.3 minutes, p less than 0.01). One patient receiving propranolol and 2 receiving nicardipine withdrew from the study because of transient side effects. Mild side effects occurred in 10 patients receiving propranolol and 5 receiving nicardipine. Nicardipine proved to be safe and effective for patients with chronic stable angina; it had fewer side effects than propranolol in the doses used.",

In this review, we discuss the range of clinical findings, appropriate diagnostic tests, and available medical, laser, and surgical treatment options. New developments in the evaluation of the optic nerve and in visual field testing may facilitate the early detection of glaucoma, and new therapeutic agents hold promise for the future.", 
    "17": "The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial was a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial of the long-term administration of propranolol hydrochloride to patients who had had at least one myocardial infarction. Among 3,837 patients followed up for an average of 25 months, 3,290 (85.7%) had 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiograms performed at the baseline examination. Four classifications of arrhythmia were examined. One of these, the presence of complex ventricular arrhythmias (at least 10 ventricular premature beats/h, or at least one pair or run of ventricular premature beats or multiform ventricular premature beats) was the subgroup of major interest. Regardless of the classification, the presence of arrhythmia identifies a group of patients with a higher risk of total mortality, coronary heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac death and instantaneous cardiac death. The a priori subgroup hypothesis that sudden death would be preferentially reduced by propranolol in patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias was not supported. The relative benefit of propranolol in reducing sudden death for this subgroup was 28 versus 16% for the subgroup without ventricular arrhythmia (relative risk of 0.72 versus 0.84, a nonsignificant relative difference of 14%). There were similar findings for two of the three other classifications of arrhythmia and for the other response variables. Although propranolol does not appear to be of special relative benefit in patients with ventricular arrhythmia, the presence of the arrhythmia does identify a high-risk group. The mechanism by which propranolol reduces mortality is still unclear, but is probably not solely an antiarrhythmic one.", 
    "18": "A double-blind crossover comparison is reported of the effects of alprazolam and placebo on anxiety and angina in 27 ambulatory outpatients with angina pectoris stabilized on propranolol. Alprazolam was shown to be a safe treatment when combined with propranolol in these patients. Patients receiving alprazolam with propranolol reported more improvement on their targeted symptoms than did patients receiving placebo with propranolol. The side effect most often reported was moderate drowsiness or sedation; no unusual side effects emerged. There was no evidence that alprazolam compromised the patients' response to propranolol.", 
    "19": "Hangover following consumption of alcohol includes many disagreeable signs and symptoms that are suggestive of sympathetic overactivity. We performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover controlled study to assess the effect of beta blockade in preventing the symptoms of hangover. Ten subjects were randomized to receive 160 mg of a long-acting preparation of propranolol or a placebo and then participated in a controlled drinking situation. Patients were then evaluated for symptoms and signs of hangover. The results showed that although beta blockade was achieved, there was no clinically important reduction in symptoms of hangover. We conclude that propranolol does not prevent the symptoms of hangover.", 
    "20": "Eyelid closure and nasolacrimal occlusion may decrease the systemic absorption of topically applied drugs. We studied the absorption kinetics of 20 microliter 0.5% timolol eyedrops in eight healthy volunteers. Each subject was supine for 30 minutes after the drug application. In randomized order, the volunteers kept their eyelids closed (ELC), or applied nasolacrimal occlusion (NLO) or blinked normally. Blood samples were drawn up to 90 minutes and analyzed for timolol with a radioreceptor assay. There was great interindividual variation in the timolol absorption. NLO reduced the total timolol absorption, but in some subjects the initial absorption was also enhanced by this procedure.", 
    "21": "In a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-masked study of glaucoma patients, visual fields, intraocular pressures, blood pressures, and pulse rates were measured after a 4-week wash-out period and after three and six months of treatment with either pindolol 1% or timolol 0.5% twice daily. Both drugs reduced significantly the IOP. The blood pressure was not changed significantly whereas the pulse rate was reduced more in the timolol treated group than in the pindolol treated group. The visual fields of the pindolol group showed on the average a slight tendency towards improvement and in the timolol treated group a very slight tendency for deterioration. The difference between these two trends was statistically significant (p less than 0.05).", 
    "22": "The effects of the d- and 1-isomers of epinephrine and norepinephrine have been determined on intraocular pressure (IOP) in conscious rabbits and rhesus monkeys, and on aqueous humor turnover rate (AHTR) in rabbits. Relatively specific beta-adrenergic antagonists (butoxamine and metoprolol) were used to attempt to modify the responses. The effects on IOP in both species are similar to those of racemic mixtures. The d- and 1-isomers of norepinephrine and epinephrine reduced IOP, and reduced AHTR in rabbits. The d- and 1-isomers of norepinephrine had little effect on IOP in monkeys while d- and 1-epinephrine increased IOP. Metoprolol, a beta 1-antagonist was more effective than butoxamine (beta 2-antagonist) at modifying the effect of the norepinephrine isomers in rabbits.", 
    "23": "Xylazine is an agent frequently used in combination with ketamine to anesthetize rabbits. Xylazine is also related pharmacologically to clonidine, a relatively selective alpha 2-agonist. In the present studies, xylazine was examined for its effects on intraocular pressure (IOP) and pupil diameter (PD) in rabbits, cats and monkeys and on noradrenergic function in the cat nictitating membrane (CNM) preparation. Topical and unilateral administration of xylazine (1.0 mg) lowered IOP bilaterally in normal, unanesthetized rabbits, cats and monkeys and caused unilateral miosis in rabbits and cats. These ocular effects of xylazine were attenuated in superior cervical ganglionectomized (SX) cats and rabbits. In addition, intra-arterially administered xylazine (10, 33 and 100 micrograms) produced dose-related inhibition of contractions of the CNM elicited by electrically stimulating the pre- and postganglionic sympathetic trunks without altering the response to i.a. norepinephrine (10 micrograms). These data suggest that ocular effects of xylazine are mediated, in part, by alteration of sympathetic neuron function. Xylazine suppressed ocular hypertension induced by water loading and IOP recovery rate following hypertonic saline infusion in rabbits suggesting that aqueous flow was inhibited. Topical pretreatment with 0.05 mg of timolol caused potentiation of the ocular hypotensive response to 0.05 mg of xylazine in rabbits. These results indicate that xylazine lowers IOP, in part, by suppressing sympathetic neuronal function which causes a reduction in aqueous flow. The augmented response to timolol and xylazine, as compared with either agent alone, suggests a rational basis for combining a prejunctionally active agent with a postjunctionally active one.", 
    "24": "Treatment with the beta blocker acebutolol may trigger antinuclear antibody (ANA) production. We retrospectively studied 97 sera from 47 patients who developed ANA during acebutolol treatment. Anti-histone and anti-denatured (ss) DNA antibodies were found in 53% and 66% respectively of the sera tested. The activities of these two antibodies correlated well with the total ANA titer. Anti-native (ds) DNA were absent or present at low titer. This immunochemical pattern of acebutolol-induced ANA is similar to that reported for other drug-induced ANA. To date, the presence such isolated ANA is not known to expose patients to any particular risk other than exceptional and minor clinical manifestations of lupus which are rapidly reversible following therapy cessation.", 
    "25": "Acebutolol, a beta blocking agent, was injected at a dose of 1 mg/day, every day for 6 months in C57B1/6 and OF1 mice. No antinuclear antibodies were induced but a transient induction of anti-single stranded DNA antibodies and an increase of IgM, IgA and IgG2a levels were observed during the first 3 weeks in some treated mice as compared to control mice. This effect was more pronounced in C57B1/6 than in OF1 mice and in the C57B1/6 mice, was more frequently observed in female than in male mice. It was further found by cellular studies done in C57B1/6 female mice, that daily i.p. or oral administration of Acebutolol induces a transient polyclonal stimulation of lymphocytes. It is concluded that certain beta blockers might possess some in vivo effects on the immune system.", 
    "26": "A spontaneously beating guinea pig Langendorff heart preparation was used to evaluate and compare the effects of bepridil hydrochloride (BP) and other Ca blockers. Cardiac contractile force was measured in isolated hearts perfused at constant pressure with nonrecirculating Krebs-Henseleit physiological salt solution (PSS). The calcium-induced inotropic response was assessed by measuring contractile force during stepwise increases in PSS Ca concentration. The results suggest that the effects of BP on cardiac muscle are different from those of the other Ca blockers tested and may involve multiple cellular mechanisms of action.", 
    "27": "Dissociation between duration of electrical and mechanical systole has been seen with increase of myocardial shortening velocity or adrenergic activity. We found a decrease of the QS2/QT ratio after exercise in 10 pts with semisitting bicycle maximal exercise test and a normal radionuclide angiogram. No change was seen in 9 patients with a normal study with beta blockade, and in pts with a abnormal radionuclide test, without beta blockade (11 pts). In 19 normal active individuals, a significant QS2/QT decrease (p less than 0.001) was seen after a submaximal exercise treadmill test, which was inhibited by beta blockade. We believe that QS2/QT diminution is suggestive of an increase of the inotropic state of the left ventricle with exercise, produced through adrenergic stimulation. It is not seen either when an ischemic left ventricle cannot adequately respond to exercise or after beta blockade.", 
    "28": "Propranolol has been reported to reduce portal and wedged hepatic vein pressures in man and may be useful for the prevention of variceal bleeding. However, its mechanism of action remains unclear. We have examined the effect of propranolol on the systemic and hepatic circulations in dogs with chronic bile duct ligation and secondary biliary cirrhosis. Under anesthesia, eight dogs received four increasing doses of propranolol as an i.v. bolus followed by continuous infusion. Systemic and hepatic hemodynamic parameters were measured in basal conditions and after a 30 min infusion for each dose. Portal vein and hepatic artery blood flows were measured with electromagnetic flow meters. All dogs had portal hypertension (portal venous pressure 15.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg), a hyperdynamic circulation and severe liver disease resulting in a marked decrease of propranolol systemic clearance (8.75 ml per min per kg) and extraction (40%). The first dose of propranolol induced a decrease in heart rate (-27%) and in cardiac index (-21%), and an increase in systemic vascular resistance (+20%). With increasing doses, the systemic vascular resistance decreased with an increase in the cardiac index. Propranolol was not associated with significant modifications of hepatic hemodynamics: portal, wedged and free hepatic venous pressures and hepatic artery blood flow were stable, and portal blood flow decreased slightly at very high propranolol levels. In seven dogs studied without dissection of the hepatic vessels, there was a small decrease in portal pressure, but not in wedged and free hepatic venous pressures with increasing doses of propranolol. Thus, in dogs with intrahepatic portal hypertension, propranolol has significant effects on systemic hemodynamics, but only minimal effects on the hepatic circulation.", 
    "29": "The mean transepithelial potential was +4.04 mV (cameral side positive to stroma). The results (Fig. 1) show that the short-circuit current was significantly reduced by timolol at 10(-4) and 10(-2) M (p less than 0.01). Since the short-circuit current across the isolated ciliary epithelium is a measure of active sodium transport in the direction stroma----posterior chamber there is an appreciable fall in Na +/- transport across the ciliary epithelium at a timolol concentration of 10(-4) M. On current values of aqueous humour secretion there would be a corresponding fall in aqueous production. For comparison it is worth recalling that the concentration of timolol in 0.5 per cent eye drops is slightly over 10(-2) M. Exposure of the tissue to timolol, a beta blocker does not seem to affect the subsequent response of the system to isoprenaline, a beta stimulant. A significant stimulation of short circuit current in the dose-range of 10(-4) to 10(-3) M with isoprenaline in a similar preparation was reported by Cole and Nagasubramanian and increase of short-circuit current and/or sodium transport in amphibian epithelia have been reported for catecholamines, and this effect may possibly be due to a decrease of the resistance to ions actively transported by the 'sodium pump' mechanism brought about via cyclic-AMP mediating the action at a cellular level. It appears that timolol has a direct effect on the active transport per se and by reducing the active ion influx can cause a reduction in the volume of aqueous production.", 
    "30": "Early localisation of infarction, estimation of infarct size and visualisation of metabolic and structural changes is of great importance for the management of acute myocardial infarction. This paper is based on an experimental model using a combination of in-vivo and in-vitro methods that allow the evaluation of the area at risk of infarction, the border zone and its changes over time. The purpose of the study was to characterize the topography and the time course of the border zone. The border zone forms an approximately 2 mm wide margin at the lateral edges of the infarct, with increasing width of the border zone along the subepicardium. Increasing duration of ischemia is associated with a dynamic sequence of events, not only within the area at risk of infarction but also in the peri-ischemic border zone, leading to an expansion of the subepicardial margin due to improved collateral blood flow over time. The area at risk of infarction is characterized by early distinct metabolic changes that were visualized as soon as 90 to 120 seconds following coronary artery occlusion. After 6 hours of occlusion almost the entire area at risk shows signs of irreversible injury due to severe hypoperfusion. The border zone, in contrast, is characterized by only moderate metabolic changes due to greater collateral perfusion (45 to 80% of the regional blood flow in the non-ischemic vascular bed). Several interventions were chosen and evaluated for their effects on the dynamic course of events within the area at risk of infarction and in the border zone. Interventions that have strong myocardial protective effects such as the combination of alpha- and beta-blockade, the application of specific O2-carriers (Perfluorocarbons) and pressure controlled retrograde perfusion via the coronary sinus (\"PICSO\"), not only reduce infarct size by 20 to 40% of the myocardium at risk of infarction, but also induce substantial topographic, functional and metabolic changes within the border zone.", 
    "31": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were treated with a combination of a beta 1-blocker (Metoprolol) and a calcium antagonist (Felodipine) from 1 to 4 or from 4 to 6 months of age. Cross sections of plastic embedded basal cerebral arteries were measured with a digitizer. The ratio between media thickness and luminal radius (m/r ratio) could then be calculated for a standardized condition assuming a smooth, circular internal elastic membrane. The treatment caused a significant decrease of the m/r ratio in various basal cerebral arteries of young and adult SHR and SHRSP, i.e. the therapy may prevent as well as reverse hypertensive structural changes. Unilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy or preganglionic denervation did not affect the structure of basal cerebral arteries in young SHRSP or normotensive controls. A slight decrease of m/r ratio was indicated in the smallest pial arteries on the sympathectomized side, but the results did not allow any conclusion as to differences in effect between preganglionic denervation and ganglionectomy.", 
    "32": "Cynomolgus monkeys were treated twice daily in one eye with timolol 180 micrograms or epinephrine 540-600 micrograms for several months. In some regions, timolol induced degeneration of trabecular meshwork endothelium and destruction of the central connective tissue core of the lamellae, leaving a rarified meshwork. In some areas, the lamellae and operculum coalesced and appeared 'glued' together. Increased numbers of subopercular cells were present. In other areas the muscle was pulled inwardly, the intramuscular spaces were widened, the shape of Schlemm's canal was altered, and the trabecular meshwork was densified and collapsed, with accumulation of pigment granules within the endothelial cells. Epinephrine induced anterior displacement of the ciliary muscle with narrowing of the chamber angle. There was no damage or loss of trabecular lamellae or endothelial cells, no increase in subopercular cells, and no accumulation of pigment granules within the trabecular cells. The intertrabecular spaces contained protein and erythrocytes. With both drugs, the changes were distributed unevenly.", 
    "33": "Cynomolgus monkeys were treated twice daily in one eye with timolol 180 micrograms for 2.7, 6.0, or 7.4 months (2 monkeys for each period) or epinephrine 540-600 micrograms for 6.7 months (2 monkeys). Some ciliary processes in both eyes of all timolol-treated monkeys exhibited light and electron microscopic changes consistent with decreased secretion: narrowed stromal vessels with few fenestrations surrounded by a thickened fibre sheath; thickened PE basement membrane; few PE and NPE basolateral infoldings; flattened NPE with small mitochondria. Additionally, the NPE contained pigment granules and large phagolysosomes. The processes in both eyes of the epinephrine-treated monkeys exhibited one of two pictures: dilated stromal capillaries with numerous fenestrations; normal stroma, PE basement membrane and PE; numerous well-developed NPE basolateral infoldings and enlarged mitochondria; dilated stromal capillaries with ruptured fenestrations; ballooned protein-filled stroma; degenerated NPE. The first picture could be consistent with hypersecretion, the second with hyposecretion. Possible pathophysiological explanations and implications of these findings are discussed.", 
    "34": "In several studies we have found that treatment with bright environmental light, capable of suppressing human melatonin, reverses the winter depressive symptoms of patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), whereas light too dim to suppress human melatonin is therapeutically ineffective. This finding, as well as the central importance of melatonin as a hormonal mediator of photoperiodic changes on seasonal rhythms in animals, led us to test the hypothesis that melatonin mediates the effects of shortening days on the winter symptoms of SAD and that the modification of melatonin secretion by bright light mediates its antidepressant effects. We partially reversed the antidepressant effects of phototherapy in 8 SAD patients by oral melatonin administration, but in another study of 19 SAD patients we failed to find any therapeutic difference between the beta-adrenergic blocker, atenolol, which inhibits melatonin secretion, and placebo. In a third study of 7 SAD patients we showed that the anti-depressant effects of phototherapy were not photoperiodic and appeared to be independent of melatonin suppression. There is some preliminary evidence that melatonin secretion may be abnormal in SAD. We conclude that while melatonin may play some role in the symptoms of SAD and the effects of phototherapy, it cannot by itself account for these phenomena.", 
    "35": "A randomized, double-blind study was undertaken to compare atenolol and captopril as second-step agents in the treatment of essential hypertension resistant to 5 mg bendrofluazide daily. Using a cross-over technique 28 patients were administered each drug sequentially for periods of 8 weeks with an intervening washout period of 2 weeks. Both drugs produced a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01). Captopril was more effective than atenolol at reducing diastolic pressure (P less than 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the systolic pressure. Neither drug produced side effects of a serious nature, but untoward symptoms were more frequent with atenolol. The effect of the drugs on myocardial function was assessed by comparing pre-treatment with post-treatment left ventricular ejection fractions, both at rest and with exercise, measured by MUGA scan. The resting ejection fraction was unaffected by either drug. During exercise, on captopril, the ejection fraction showed the normal increase over the resting baseline, but on atenolol there was no such increase.", 
    "36": "This prospective clinical study comparing laser trabeculoplasty, medical therapy and surgery as the primary therapy for 168 patients with untreated chronic simple glaucoma, showed that the surgical group resulted in the lowest mean intraocular pressures, and was most effective in controlling the diurnal swing of intraocular pressures. Laser trabeculoplasty resulted in a lesser degree of pressure reduction but these patients were more frequently subject to high pressure spikes. Medical therapy was the least effective in lowering pressure.", 
    "37": "An account is given of the Moorfields prospective surgical v medical trial in primary open angle glaucoma. The intra-ocular pressure, visual fields calculated on a percentage basis and the visual acuity were measured in 52 subjects at 3 monthly intervals for up to 18 years. Fifty per cent of the patients underwent surgery by random selection and an attempt was made to determine whether the surgical or the medical cases fared better. Even after this extended period little correlation between visual field and the level of intra-ocular pressure could be found. The results appeared to favour the possibility that surgery was of some benefit in terms of visual field whereas medical therapy was probably better for visual acuity: but in neither case was convincing proof obtained. The final conclusion was that more research is needed but in the meantime too frequent and too elaborate surveillance of open angle glaucoma is not particularly beneficial to the patients.", 
    "38": "The effect of a variety of neurotransmitters and of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) upon levels of mRNA coding for proopiomelanocortin (POMC) was studied in primary cultures of rat pituitary. Total nucleic acid was extracted from cells, fixed on nitrocellulose and hybridized to a single-stranded alpha 32P-labeled DNA complementary to 150 bases of mouse POMC mRNA. After two days incubation with CRF (10(-8) M), the levels of POMC mRNA in both the anterior (AL) and the intermediate lobe (IL) cells increased by about 100%. A similar increase in the IL cells was seen after incubation with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenalin (10(-6) M). In contrast, dopamine (10(-6) M) and GABA (10(-6) M) decreased POMC mRNA levels in the IL cells to about 50% of control levels without affecting POMC mRNA levels in the AL cells. In both pituitary lobes, POMC mRNA was decreased by the Ca2+-channel blocker D600 (10(-5) M) and increased by forskolin (10(-6) M). This indicates that both cAMP and Ca2+ ions play an important role as intracellular messengers for the control of POMC gene expression in normal melanotrope and corticotrope cells.", 
    "39": "Chagas' disease induces acinar enlargement in the submandibular salivary gland of rats inoculated with the Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi at the age of 27-28 days and killed 18 days after inoculation (acute phase). Propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, prevents the acinar enlargement induced by T. cruzi infection. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, enhances this enlargement. These results suggest that catecholamines are involved in the genesis of the acinar hypertrophy induced by Chagas' disease.", 
    "40": "Scopolamine (2 mg/kg IP) and propranolol (55 mg/kg IP), given before a single learning trial, reduce retention of a passive avoidance response in rats. Phosphatidylserine, 30-60 mg/kg IP, antagonizes the amnesic effect of scopolamine but not that of propranolol. The retention of the passive avoidance response is not affected by phosphatidylserine given alone. The results indicate that this phospholipid selectively counteracts the action of scopolamine on passive avoidance acquisition, probably via a cholinergic mechanism.", 
    "41": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible involvement of a noradrenergic and opioid mediation of the reversal by tricyclic antidepressants of escape deficits produced by inescapable shock pretreatment. Rats were first exposed to 60 inescapable shocks (15 s duration, 0.8 mA, every min +/- 15 s) and 48 h later subjected, to daily shuttle-box sessions (30 trials/day, ITI: 30 s) during 3 consecutive days. Twice-daily IP injection of desipramine or clomipramine (total daily dose: 32 mg/kg) prevented escape deficits. Penbutolol (0.125; 0.25; 0.5 mg/kg), prazosin (1; 2 mg/kg) and naloxone (0.5; 1 mg/kg) given once a day dose-dependently attenuated the beneficial effect of tricyclic antidepressants in reducing the number of escape failures in rats exposed to shock pretreatment. In agreement with data obtained in the forced-swimming model, these findings support the notion that activation of noradrenergic and opioid receptors is an important factor in the mediation of the effects of tricyclic antidepressants in animal models of depression.", 
    "42": "Seventy-two patients entered the treatment phase of an open, long-term, dose-ranging trial of carteolol in stable, exercise-induced angina pectoris. Patients were to be treated with progressive doses of carteolol (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg), given as a single daily oral dose. Thirty of the patients (42%) completed one year of treatment with carteolol as the sole antianginal therapy. The most frequent final carteolol doses were 20 mg and 40 mg once daily. Statistically significant improvements from baseline in exercise tolerance as reflected in time to onset of angina, time to the endpoint of exercise and time to the onset of 1 mm S-T segment change on ECG were observed in carteolol-treated patients. Exercise-induced increases in heart rate and double-product were significantly suppressed, compared to baseline, throughout the study. Resting heart rate and double-product were modestly decreased. Carteolol was shown to be effective and safe when administered on a long-term basis to patients with angina pectoris.", 
    "43": "Previous experiments have reported deficits in cognitive performance following the administration of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. These deficits have not appeared consistently, however, and it is not clear from previous studies whether changes in the central nervous system, rather than end-organ functioning, are responsible. The present experiment investigated the effects of beta blockade in a memory-search paradigm that distinguished the relatively central process of memory comparison from the more peripheral processes of stimulus encoding and response selection. Twenty-six adult men with mild essential hypertension received either a placebo or a beta blocker (atenolol or propranolol) for 2 weeks. Although beta blockade did occur in the active drug groups, there were no significant effects of the drugs on memory-search performance.", 
    "44": "Sleep laboratory and outpatient studies of the hypnotic efficacy of the amino acid L-tryptophan are reviewed, with particular emphasis on evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness in the treatment of insomnia. In younger situational insomniacs, whose sleep problem consists solely of longer than usual sleep latencies, L-tryptophan is effective in reducing sleep onset time on the first night of administration in doses ranging from 1 to 15 g. In more chronic, well-established sleep-onset insomnia or in more severe insomnias characterized by both sleep onset and sleep maintenance problems, repeated administration of low doses of L-tryptophan over time may be required for therapeutic improvement. In these patients, hypnotic effects appear late in the treatment period or, as shown in some studies, even after discontinuation of treatment. The improvement in sleep measures post-treatment has given rise to use of a treatment regimen known as \"interval therapy\", in which L-tryptophan treatment alternates with an L-tryptophan-free interval until improvement occurs. The absence of side effects and lack of development of tolerance in long-term use are important factors in the decision to embark upon a trial of L-tryptophan treatment. In addition, L-tryptophan administration is not associated with impairment of visuomotor, cognitive, or memory performance, nor does it elevate threshold for arousal from sleep.", 
    "45": "Psychiatric patients presenting with chronic psychogenic polydipsia are often difficult to treat with standard psychiatric interventions. Pharmacologic intervention was attempted in three patients and was successful in one. One patient had a significant and sustained reduction of water intake while on 160 mg of propranolol. One patient did not improve with either propranolol or captopril while a third patient showed no improvement of serum sodium with demeclocycline nor reduction of water intake with propranolol. The potential mechanisms by which these pharmacologic agents might alter thirst in patients with primary polydipsia are discussed.", 
    "46": "In this report the effects of various receptor blockers on the desimipramine (DMI)-induced cortisol (ACTH) secretion in healthy male subjects are presented. Each trial consisted of two administrations: one of DMI i.v. alone and one of DMI i.v. in combination with the respective receptor blocker, i.e. methysergide (serotonin (5-HT) receptor blocker), propranolol (beta receptor blocker), phentolamine (alpha-1/alpha-2 receptor blocker), yohimbine (alpha-2 greater than alpha-1 receptor blocker), and prazosin (alpha-1 receptor blocker). In addition, the effect of prazosin on DMI-induced ACTH stimulation was examined. DMI-induced cortisol stimulation was not significantly different after DMI alone (n = 12) from that after three days pretreatment with methysergide (12 mg p.o.) in another group of subjects (n = 12). Neither the combination of DMI plus propranolol (15 mg i.v. n = 18, incomplete block design) nor that of DMI plus phentolamine (60 mg i.v. n = 12) had a significant influence on DMI-induced cortisol secretion. Following combined administration with yohimbine (10 mg i.v.), cortisol secretion was higher compared to that after DMI alone in the same group (n = 6). DMI-induced cortisol secretion was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) following combined administration with prazosin (1 mg p.o. n = 12), as was DMI-induced ACTH secretion (p less than 0.05) in these subjects. The findings of these trials, especially those of the prazosin trial, indicate that DMI-induced stimulation of cortisol and ACTH secretion is attributable to the noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibiting effect of DMI, and that the stimulus is transmitted with the aid of noradrenergic alpha-1 receptors. Alpha-2 receptors possibly exert a negative influence on this effect.", 
    "47": "In this report the effects of various receptor blockers on desimipramine (DMI)-induced prolactin (PRL) secretion in healthy male subjects are presented. Each trial consisted of two administrations: one of DMI i.v. alone and one of DMI i.v. in combination with the respective receptor blocker: methysergide (serotonin (5-HT) receptor blocker), propranolol (beta receptor blocker), phentolamine (alpha-1/alpha-2 receptor blocker), yohimbine (alpha-2 greater than alpha-1 receptor blocker), and prazosin (alpha-1 receptor blocker). Following administration of methysergide (12 mg p.o., n = 12), a significantly lower (p less than 0.01) DMI-induced PRL secretion compared to DMI alone in another group of subjects (n = 12) was observed. Combined administration with propranolol (15 mg i.v.) significantly enhanced the DMI-induced PRL secretion compared to DMI 50 mg i.v. alone (n = 18, incomplete block design) (p less than 0.01). Neither combined administration with phentolamine (60 mg i.v., n = 12), yohimbine (10 mg i.v., n = 6), nor prazosin (1 mg p.o., n = 12) significantly influenced the DMI-induced PRL secretion compared to DMI alone in the same subjects. The results of the present study, especially the inhibitory effect on DMI-induced PRL secretion of methysergide, indicate that the primarily noradrenaline (NA) and lesser serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibiting antidepressant DMI stimulates PRL secretion via 5-HT neurons. Furthermore, the significantly enhanced PRL release following combined administration of DMI and propranolol suggests that a noradrenergic inhibitory effect also may be involved in the transmission of the PRL stimulus.", 
    "48": "In this report the effects of various receptor blockers on desimipramine (DMI)-induced growth hormone (GH) secretion in healthy male subjects are presented. Each trial consisted of two administrations: one of DMI i.v. alone and one of DMI i.v. in combination with the respective receptor blocker: methysergide (serotonin (5-HT) receptor blocker), propranolol (beta receptor blocker), phentolamine (alpha-1/alpha-2 receptor blocker), yohimbine (alpha-2 greater than alpha-1 receptor blocker), and prazosin (alpha-1 receptor blocker). DMI-induced GH stimulation was not significantly different after DMI i.v. alone (n = 12) than after three days' pretreatment with 12 mg methysergide p.o. in another group of subjects (n = 12). Following combined administration of DMI and propranolol (15 mg i.v.), GH secretion was significantly increased by 25 mg DMI (p less than 0.05) and 50 mg DMI (incomplete block design, n = 18). GH secretion was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) after DMI in combination with 60 mg phentolamine i.v. compared to that after administration of DMI alone in the same group (n = 12). Following 10 mg yohimbine i.v. in combination with DMI (n = 6), the DMI-induced GH increase was also significantly less (p less than 0.05) than that after DMI alone. The DMI-induced GH increase following DMI plus 1 mg prazosin p.o. (n = 12) was comparable to that after DMI alone. The results indicate that the GH-stimulating effect of DMI is primarily related to the ability of DMI to inhibit noradrenaline (NA) reuptake. Should serotonergic receptors be involved in the DMI-induced GH secretion at all, they transmit a positive stimulus. The alpha-1 receptors are most likely not (or not essentially) involved, whereas alpha-2 receptors affect the DMI-induced secretion positively, and beta receptors have an inhibitory effect.", 
    "49": "To assess the feasibility of characterizing beta-adrenoreceptors externally with ligands labeled with gamma-emitting radionuclides, we infused 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol (125I-HYP) a potent, high affinity, beta-adrenoreceptor ligand into isolated perfused hearts and monitored uptake and release of the label externally with a gamma probe. Perfusion with specific beta-adrenergic displacing significantly increased the turnover rate constant of 125I-HYP in comparison to that obtained with non-specific displacing agents. After modifying beta-adrenoreceptor density by pretreatment of animals with thyroid hormone, an increase in 125I-HYP uptake was observed. Thus, beta-adrenoreceptor occupancy and increases in beta-adrenoreceptor density can be detected externally with an approach which may offer promise for their characterization in vivo with radiolabeled adrenergic ligands.", 
    "50": "Blocking activities of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors by 4-(2-hydroxy-3-[(1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl)amino]propoxy)benzeneacetamide (KF4317) were tested on the isolated muscles, compared with the action of labetalol. In blocking the beta 1-adrenoceptor, KF4317 was almost as active as labetalol. KF4317 was about 1/10th as potent as labetalol in blocking the beta 2-receptor. KF4317 was beta 1-adrenoceptor selective. KF4317 was about 1/50th as potent as labetalol in blocking the alpha 1-receptor. KF4317 did not interact with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor in concentrations up to 10(-5) M. The present results indicate that KF4317 is a selective beta 1- and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker, though the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking action is weak.", 
    "51": "Bupranolol is a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with a Ki-value of 6-15 nmol/l (equivalent to 1.5-4 ng/ml in plasma) at beta 1- (rat salivary gland) and beta 2-adrenoceptors (rat reticulocytes) in receptor binding studies with 3H-CGP 12177 in the presence of human plasma. After oral administration of 200 mg bupranolol to healthy volunteers, the maximal plasma concentration was observed within 1.2 h but it only reached a level close to the Ki-value. Elimination from plasma was rapid (t 1/2 = 2.0 h). Administration of 30 mg bupranolol in a transdermal delivery system (TTS) every 24 h to 6 healthy volunteers for 72 h yielded steady state plasma concentrations 4- to 5-times above the Ki-value as shown by in vitro inhibition of beta-adrenoceptor binding by plasma samples. The pharmacodynamic effect, measured as the reduction in exercise tachycardia, showed a stable inhibitory effect; antagonism of a bolus injection of isoprenaline indicated a 10- to 15-fold right shift of the dose-response curve during the observation period of 72 h. It is concluded that steady-state plasma concentrations and effect of the elsewise rapidly eliminated beta-blocker bupranolol can be achieved by a transdermal delivery system applied each day.", 
    "52": "The effect of the centrally acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol on beta-adrenergic responsiveness, beta-receptor density and N-protein coupling was studied in the rat cerebral cortex (which contains primarily beta 1-receptors) and cerebellum (containing mostly beta 2-receptors). The objective was to determine whether clenbuterol's effect on these variables was similar to that produced by standard antidepressants. When given to rats repeatedly, clenbuterol caused a decrease in beta-adrenergic responsiveness in slices from either the cerebral cortex or the cerebellum. The decreased beta-responsiveness in the cerebellum was associated with a decrease both in the density of beta-receptors and in receptor/N-protein coupling. In the cortex, only reduced receptor/N-protein coupling was observed by in vitro ligand-binding methods. However, when quantitative autoradiography was employed, clenbuterol treatment was found to reduce the binding of [125I]iodopindolol to beta 2-receptors throughout the brain, whereas binding to beta 1-receptors was not reduced. The down-regulation of beta 2-receptors by clenbuterol is due to its acting centrally as a beta 2-agonist. Although clenbuterol has about an equal affinity for beta 1-receptors and beta 2-receptors, no evidence was found for agonist activity of this drug at beta 1-receptors in the cerebral cortex. The strategies described here should be helpful in investigating important properties of centrally acting beta-agonists that might have potential as antidepressants.", 
    "53": "The working hypothesis of many studies of shock has been that naloxone acts by blocking centrally and/or peripherally located opioid receptors. At plasma concentrations used to treat experimental shock (10(-6) M and above), naloxone inhibited the in vitro release of superoxide (O2-) by human neutrophils that were stimulated by the E. coli peptide N-formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP). Superoxide release stimulated by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) was also inhibited by naloxone. Naloxone had no effect on the FMLP-stimulated release of beta-glucuronidase or lysozyme. Naloxone had no effect on 3H FMLP receptor binding. Studies utilizing 3H naloxone revealed the presence of a ligand-specific naloxone binding site on human neutrophils with a Kd of 1.2 X 10(-5) M, which is close to the ID50 of the inhibitory effect upon O2- release (1.8 X 10(-5). Thyrotropin releasing factor (TRF) had no effect upon 3H naloxone binding or on O2- release. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, inhibited 3H naloxone binding, and O2- release while nifedipine, another calcium channel blocker had no effect on either assay except at 10(-4) M, at which concentration 3H naloxone binding as well as the release of O2- were increased. These experiments suggest that the inhibitory effect of naloxone upon O2- release is mediated via a specific binding site.", 
    "54": "Myocardial adrenergic beta-receptors were isolated and partially purified from the nonischemic perfused working rabbit hearts. Using highly radioactive beta-receptor antagonist, dihydroalprenolol (DHA), properties of beta-receptors were investigated by kinetic equilibrium analysis when the physiological function of the heart appeared to be normal. At the concentration of 10 nM DHA dissociation constant (Kd) was 14.9 nM and there were at least two distinctly different DHA binding sites, based on the analysis of the dissociation rate of DHA-receptor complex. Identification of the two distinctly different DHA binding sites was not obvious from the analysis of Scatchard plot.", 
    "55": "Combinations of antianginal drugs may be used for an additive effect against angina, but also to off-set unwanted effects of one drug with another, either by direct effects or by a reduction of dosage of each drug. Based on earlier studies with separate drugs we have now examined the effect of 150 mg bupranolol combined with 40 mg isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in one retarded tablet, given twice daily. 22 patients with CHD entered the study, 11 of those with and 11 without signs of ischemia during exercise. In an acute radionuclide ventriculographic (RNV) study 2 h after the tablet, ejection fraction (EF) during exercise increased only in patients with exercise ischemia (+6%, p less than 0.001). In the other patients EF did not change. After 21 days of treatment echocardiographically determined end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters decreased, resulting in an increase of shortening fraction by 15.6% (p less than 0.05). Heart rate, systolic and diastolic pressure and ST-segment depression decreased significantly. In another acute RNV study the effect of a venous vasodilator, molsidomine 4 mg s.l., was examined after nifedipine 10 mg s.l. in 19 patients with CHD, 9 with and 10 without exercise ischemia. Differences between drugs were most prominent during exercise. In the nonischemic group EF rose by 6.6% after nifedipine (n.s.) and by 14% after molsidomine (p less than 0.01 against control). In the group with ischemia EF rose by 12.6% after nifedipine and by 17.4% after additional molsidomine, significant against control (p less than 0.01) as well as against nifedipine (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "The formation of aqueous humour by the ciliary body is a complex process. Active transport of solutes by the ciliary process epithelium is an energy-dependent mechanism that selectively transports substances against an electrochemical gradient across the cell membranes. Water passively follows the active solute transport. In addition to these active transport processes, ultrafiltration contributes to the formation of aqueous humour. The ciliary epithelium contains enzyme systems that function in the production of aqueous humour. The enzymes sodium-potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase [(Na+:K+)ATPase] and carbonic anhydrase participate in the active transport across this epithelium. Inhibition of these enzymes lowers intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing aqueous humour production. the ciliary epithelium contains both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Electrophysiologic studies on the isolated iris-ciliary body (I-CB) preparation provide a means to study direct effects of the adrenergic agents on transepithelial properties of the ciliary epithelium. This paper will discuss the enzymatic and adrenergic properties of the ciliary epithelium as they relate to active transport and thereby aqueous humour production.", 
    "57": "Receptor binding studies in the cerebral cortex of young (2-4 months) and mature (11-12 months) rats were conducted at two points of the circadian time: 8.00 and 20.00 hr. In addition, the exploratory activity in the open field was assessed. In young rats the density of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors increased at 20.00 in comparison with 8.00 hr, while no changes in the exploratory activity were observed. However, in mature rats the activity was higher at 20.00 than 8.00 hr; at the same time, a rise in the density of alpha 1- but not beta-adrenoceptors was observed. Obtained data suggest that the increased exploratory activity of mature rats at 20.00 hr may appear as a result of a higher density of alpha 1-adrenoceptors and a simultaneous lack of changes in beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "58": "Pregnant CD rats were treated subcutaneously with 0, 5 or 10 mg/kg/day of imipramine (IMI) on days 8-20 of gestation. Behavioral and neurochemical endpoints were measured at different postnatal days (PND). Three behavioral tests were conducted: negative geotaxis on PNDs 7-9; auditory startle habituation (ASH) on PNDs 14, 16 and 18; locomotor activity before and after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of saline or 0.5 mg/kg d-amphetamine on PND 21. Catecholamine levels, B-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic binding were measured on PND 1 and in PND 21 rats 3 hours after challenge. Maternal weight gained during the dosing period was decreased in a dose-related manner, but there were no dose-related differences in offspring body weights. On PND 7, low-dose males turned significantly sooner in negative geotaxic testing, and more high-dose males successfully turned (94%) than did controls (61%). A significant reduction in ASH amplitude was found only in males from the low-dose group on PND 18. IMI-exposed males tended to be more active prior to and following amphetamine challenge. On PND 1, male offspring from the low-dose group showed a 65% reduction in B-adrenergic receptor binding and a trend toward increased brain epinephrine (EPI) levels. On PND 21, no consistent dose-related receptor binding changes were observed. Cortical levels of EPI, however, tended to be higher in treated males and high-dose females challenged with d-amphetamine. These same rats also showed a marked elevation in locomotor activity following challenge with d-amphetamine. Thus, prenatal IMI exposure appeared to alter functional development of the central adrenergic systems in a complex manner, but one consistent with changes noted in both neurochemical and behavioral endpoints.", 
    "59": "The leukotriene C4 (LTC4)-induced contraction and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) release of the guinea pig lung parenchymal (GPLP) strip are both inhibited by the beta 2-adrenergic agent salbutamol. The effect of LTC4 is restored to nearly normal by the beta-adrenergic antagonist sotalol. The latter substance alone also induces a contraction in the GPLP strip and potentiates the contractions and the TxA2 release of LTC4. During the sotalol-induced contractions, no TxA2 release occurs. An antihistaminic, mepyramine had no effect on the sotalol-induced contraction. When sotalol is added repeatedly to a GPLP strip, only the first time a contraction occurs.", 
    "60": "Beta-adrenergic agents cause a 2.5-3-fold stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in rat ventral prostate membrane preparations with an order of potency (KD values) typical of a beta 2-subtype receptor: (-)isoproterenol (20 nM) greater than (-)epinephrine (70 nM) much greater than (-)norepinephrine (1 microM) much greater than dopamine (70 microM). The stimulatory effect exerted by high concentrations of dopamine (greater than 0.1 mM) is completely reversed by propranolol but not by haloperidol or sulpiride, thus indicating an action of dopamine mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor. One week after castration, basal adenylate cyclase activity in prostatic membranes is 50% reduced. In the same group, the stimulation by isoproterenol is completely abolished in the absence of GTP, while the effect of GTP alone is reduced by 75%. The inhibitory effect of castration on basal as well as isoproterenol- and GTP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity can be completely reversed by treatment of castrated animals with dihydrotestosterone, thus demonstrating the marked androgen dependency of adenylate cyclase activity in prostatic tissue. Since the response to direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity (assessed by NaF and forskolin) is only reduced by 33%-60% while the response to isoproterenol is 100% abolished, the present data indicates that the complete loss of beta-adrenergic responsiveness of prostatic adenylate cyclase following castration includes many steps, including those preceding adenylate cyclase activity, namely the beta-adrenergic receptor itself and/or its coupling via the GTP-binding protein. The large amplitude of the effects observed should facilitate study of the mechanisms involved in the marked regulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system by androgens in prostatic tissue.", 
    "61": "The changes in the responsiveness of the isolated longitudinal and circular smooth muscles from cat terminal ileum to adrenergic agents during the postnatal period were studied by the effect of noradrenaline (0.01-100 mumol) on the smooth muscle tone and phasic contractions. Cumulatively applied noradrenaline (0.01-10 mumol) decreased the longitudinal muscle tone without age-dependent differences via inhibitory alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Noradrenaline decreased the phasic contraction amplitude of longitudinal muscle via inhibitory alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Cumulatively applied noradrenaline (0.01-10 mumol) exerted an age-dependent effect on the circular muscle tone via stimulatory alpha 1-adrenoceptors. alpha 1-adrenoceptors continue to develop functionally at 60 days postnatal. Noradrenaline decreased the phasic contraction amplitude of the circular muscle and exerted a stimulant effect on the tone which suggested an existence of two alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes.", 
    "62": "Systemically, levobunolol is as effective as propranolol for cardiovascular indications, with a greater potency and greater duration of action. Ocularly, levobunolol is as effective and as safe as topical timolol for the long-term treatment of elevated IOP. The utility of topical levobunolol as an additional, effective beta-blocker for the treatment of glaucoma will be determined by additional research and use by ophthalmologists in countries where levobunolol is approved.",

    "64": "This prospective, double-blind, multicenter study compared enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide with standard triple therapy (STT; hydrochlorothiazide, timolol, and hydralazine) with regard to safety, tolerability, antihypertensive efficacy, and effect on renal function in 75 patients with documented renovascular hypertension. Both groups showed a significant mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the double-blind study, with the enalapril group showing a mean 12 mm greater decrease in systolic blood pressure as compared to STT (less than 0.05). Effective treatment of diastolic hypertension was noted in 96% of the enalapril group as compared to 82% on STT (p less than 0.05). STT failure was seen exclusively in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis of high grade and frequently in association with impaired renal function. cPAH, a measure of effective renal plasma flow, showed a significant increase in the enalapril group, as compared to the STT (p less than 0.05). In contrast, there was a bimodal response of CIn (GFR): 80% of patients in the enalapril group showed no significant change while 20% (10 patients) showed a mean decrease of 28% along with a 12% increase in CPAH (p less than 0.01). No acute renal failure or toxic side effects were noted in the enalapril group. Enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide is very effective in treating renovascular hypertension and is without significant toxic side effects. The self-limited increase in serum creatinine seen in 20% of renovascular hypertensive patients receiving enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide may identify a subset of patients with unilateral or bilateral high grade renal artery stenosis who should be treated with angioplasty or operative intervention.", 
    "65": "The haemodynamic effect of sudden termination of propranolol therapy was studied in sham-operated and portal hypertensive rats. All animals were injected with propranolol (20 mg/kg/day) or saline i.p. for 10 days, then had an isoproterenol infusion test performed 48 h or 72 h after cessation of injections. The dose of isoproterenol required to increase the heart rate by 50 beats/min (CD50), was significantly lower in both sham-operated and portal hypertensive rats at 48 h after propranolol withdrawal. Maximum chronotropic response (Rmax), was significantly higher only in portal hypertensive rats at 48 h after propranolol withdrawal. These results show the existence of a transient beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity state following propranolol withdrawal in normal and portal hypertensive rats.", 
    "66": "Autoimmune orchitis induced an increment in the beta-adrenoceptor populations in intact mouse lymphocytes, depending on their source. Characterization of (-)-(3H)-DHA specific binding to intact normal cells indicate that thymic cells do not have the ability of binding a beta-adrenergic ligand. In contrast, spleen and lymph node cells showed a homogeneous population of beta-adrenergic receptors. (-)-(3H)-DHA binding was a rapid, reversible and stereospecific process. Competition experiments indicated the order of potency of the agonists and led to their definition as being of the beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype. Saturation assays and Scatchard analysis indicated a single class of binding sites (being free of allosteric or cooperative interaction) in both control and immune cells. However, spleen and lymph node cells from mice hyperimmunized with testicular preparations showed a marked increase in the number of beta-adrenoceptor sites with no changes in chi d. These results emphasize the use of lymphocytes possessing a homogeneous population of beta 2-adrenoceptors as an easily available model for monitoring beta-adrenoceptors in disease.", 
    "67": "The mechanism of coronary vasoconstriction induced by atrial fibrillation during maximal coronary dilatation was studied in 19 chloralose-urethane anesthetized dogs. Maximal coronary dilatation was achieved by carbochromene (5 mg/kg i.v.) or dipyridamole (0.2 mg/kg i.v.). Left circumflex coronary blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter. Atrial fibrillation was compared with rhythmic atrial pacing at similar heart rates (207 +/- 12 vs. 204 +/- 12 beats/min). During maximal coronary dilatation, coronary resistance was 0.38 +/- 0.05 mm Hg X min X 100 g/ml (RU) at sinus rhythm, 0.41 +/- 0.06 RU at atrial pacing, and 0.52 +/- 0.07 RU at atrial fibrillation, that was significantly (p less than 0.005) higher than during sinus rhythm and atrial pacing. Accordingly, coronary oxygen extraction was 14 +/- 1% at sinus rhythm, 17 +/- 1% at atrial pacing (p less than 0.005 vs. sinus rhythm) and 27 +/- 2% at atrial fibrillation (p less than 0.001 vs sinus rhythm and atrial pacing). Beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) did not prevent this coronary vasoconstrictive effect. Following alpha-blockade with phenoxybenzamine (10 mg/kg i.v.), however, coronary resistance was 0.52 +/- 0.08 RU during sinus rhythm, 0.54 +/- 0.10 RU during atrial pacing and 0.57 +/- 0.09 RU during atrial fibrillation. The data suggest coronary vasoconstriction induced by atrial fibrillation mediated by an alpha-adrenoceptor mechanism.", 
    "68": "Aldosterone suppression is said to play a major role in the long term hypotensive efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. However, in previous reports from other laboratories, plasma volume has been found mostly increased and sodium balance sometimes positive. The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (10-40 mg/day, p.o., for 6 weeks) on blood pressure, body fluid volumes, renal function and plasma aldosterone were compared to those of hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/day, p.o.) alone for 2 weeks and in association with propranolol (80-160 mg/day, p.o.) for 4 more weeks during a randomized double-blind parallel study in 14 essential hypertensives. Hydrochlorothiazide alone and in combination with propranolol induced slight and not significant change in either blood pressure and body fluids. The maximum hypotensive response to enalapril was achieved only after 2 weeks of continuous treatment possibly because after 1 week the hypotensive efficacy was lessened by a significant (P less than 0.05) fluid retention secondary to a transient and not significant fall in renal perfusion. At this time aldosterone was not significantly changed compared to pretreatment values. After 6 weeks on enalapril, blood pressure was significantly reduced, plasma aldosterone further but not significantly decreased and extracellular fluid volume was normal. These findings indicate that aldosterone suppression contributes to the blood pressure lowering effect of enalapril by offsetting the salt and water retention observed on starting treatment and due to direct vasodilation.", 
    "69": "Changes in level of nutrient intake have been shown to exert a major influence on beta-adrenergic cardiac activity in 2 week old suckling rats. A series of experiments demonstrates that the alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor system is functional by 2 weeks postnatal age, and that alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzomine (PBZ) does not affect the high heart rates of well-fed pups but prevents development of the bradycardia after cessation of suckling and fully reverses the low heart rates of nutrient-deprived pups in a dose-dependent manner. This last effect is dependent upon beta-adrenergic reflex cardiac pathways. After PBZ, milk feeding no longer produces cardiac acceleration in nutrient-deprived pups. Systolic and mean arterial pressure during PBZ administration and estimates of plasma volume change during nutrient deprivation are consistent with the inference that changes in peripheral resistance, mediated by the alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor system, accompany nutrient regulation of cardiac rate in the suckling rat.", 
    "70": "The binding characteristics of (-)3-[125I]iodocyanopindolol, a high specific activity antagonist for the lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor, were determined in a group of euthymic lithium-treated patients and controls. There was a statistically significant reduction (less than 20%) in the density of beta-adrenoceptors in a group of 56 lithium-treated patients. Division of this group of patients into the unipolar and bipolar distinction indicated that the abnormality was based mainly in the bipolar group of patients. The unipolar patients with an endogenous form of the illness also showed this abnormality. Reduced beta-adrenoceptor density may be associated with endogenous affective illness. However, the results must be interpreted with caution since lymphocyte fractions prepared for beta-adrenoceptor assays can be contaminated with platelets and since platelets have been reported to have beta-receptors then a proportion of the total binding could be associated with platelet beta-adrenoceptors rather than with lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "71": "Binding of 125I-iodopindolol (IPIN) to intact 1321N1 human astrocytoma cell B-adrenergic receptors was measured at 37 degrees and on ice. Control cells showed a single component of IPIN binding on ice with the same total number of receptors as measured at 37 degrees. In desensitized cells (pretreated for 20 min with 1 microM isoproterenol) approximately 40% of IPIN binding on ice exhibited kinetics similar to those observed in control cells. The remaining 60% of receptors were labelled by IPIN at a much slower rate requiring the use of very high concentrations of IPIN. Sucrose density gradient fractionation was used to separately study the labelling of plasma membrane receptors and those associated with a light vesicle fraction. Labelling by IPIN on ice of the plasma membrane receptors of control cells was rapid, labelling of the light vesicle receptors of desensitized cells was slow, and labelling of the plasma membrane receptors of desensitized cells appeared to occur with both rapid and slow components. Selective labelling of the plasma membrane receptors of intact cells thus could be obtained by incubation with IPIN on ice under selected conditions. Similar results were obtained when broken cell preparations from control and desensitized cells were used. The decreased binding of IPIN on ice to B-adrenergic receptors in the light vesicle fraction not only provides further evidence consistent with sequestration of B-adrenergic receptors during desensitization, it also provides a convenient and inexpensive means to assay the sequestration reaction.", 
    "72": "Intravenous GABA (0.1-3 mg/kg) induced transient relaxation of the duodenum in urethane anaesthetized rats. The effect of GABA was mimicked by homotaurine and antagonized by bicuculline, suggesting the involvement of GABA A receptors in this type of response. Duodenal relaxation induced by GABA was unaffected by i.v. hexamethonium, phentolamine propranolol or 6-hydroxydopamine but was prevented in preparations pretreated with topical tetrodotoxin thus indicating its neurogenic origin. The ability of GABA to induce neurogenic relaxation decreased rapidly when increasing the distance from the duodenum while relaxations induced by DMPP or noradrenaline were observed throughout the whole rat small intestine.", 
    "73": "The effects of development upon adrenergic regulation of glycogenolysis were characterized using isolated hepatocytes from 3 different age groups of male rats (6 week-old, 8 week-old and 30 week-old). The phosphorylase a response in isolated hepatocytes to alpha-adrenergic stimulation decreased moderately with advancing age; whereas, that to beta-adrenergic stimulation declined more rapidly and almost disappeared at the age of 30 weeks. This developmental alteration in relative contribution of alpha- and beta-adrenergic regulation of phosphorylase was further confirmed by the experiments with specific antagonists. Also, the dramatic decrease of beta-adrenergic response on glycogen phosphorylase activity was found to be closely associated with a similar change of cAMP generation. In addition, the glucagon effect on cAMP production was found to be declined with advancing animal age. These results demonstrate that the glycogenolytic response of isolated rat hepatocytes to catecholamines can be mediated by different pathways according to the age of the animal; thus, juvenile male rats exhibit both the alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanism for activation of phosphorylase and the maturation is associated with a modest decline of alpha receptor-mediated effect and a dramatic attenuation of a beta-adrenergic/cAMP response.", 
    "74": "A series of compounds was prepared in which the 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamino moieties of the antihypertensive agents labetalol and medroxalol were replaced by 2-aminotetralins. Compounds containing a 6-methoxy and 6,7-methylenedioxy group in the aminotetralin were at least as active as labetalol in lowering the blood pressure of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). As determined by ligand binding, these compounds were comparable to labetalol as alpha 1-antagonists but were substantially weaker beta 1-antagonists.", 
    "75": "Ten patients with uncomplicated moderate essential hypertension were recruited to evaluate the effect of the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol and the beta 1-selective beta-blocker metoprolol on platelet aggregation and cAMP formation. Five patients began treatment with propranolol 80 mg b.i.d. and 5 with metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d., and after 2 weeks the treatments were exchanged. ADP- and adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation and the basal level of platelet cAMP were measured at the end of each treatment period. Platelet aggregation was tested turbidometrically, using the threshold value for irreversible aggregation, and cAMP measurements were performed using a protein-binding assay. Both ADP and adrenaline threshold values were significantly lower after propranolol than after metoprolol. The basal cAMP level was lower during propranolol than metoprolol treatment. The results indicate that platelet aggregation and basal cAMP level are influenced by beta-blockers in proportion to their affinity to different beta-adrenoceptors. This may be of value in the beta-blocker treatment of patients at high thrombotic risk.", 
    "76": "In 40 patients with essential hypertension, enalapril was compared with propranolol as an antihypertensive agent in a double-blind study. The patients were randomly given either enalapril 5-10-20 mg bid or propranolol 40-80-120 mg bid in a treatment consisting of step-by-step increases in dosage. When the diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 90 mm Hg on the highest dosage, hydrochlorothiazide was added. Both enalapril and propranolol reduced blood pressure, although the patients tended to achieve lower blood pressures while on enalapril. More patients on propranolol required additional diuretic therapy than patients on enalapril. Propranolol reduced heart rate; with enalapril there were no changes in heart rate. Both drugs increased serum potassium and urea. Plasma renin substrate was reduced by enalapril, but raised by propranolol. Enalapril increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin I, while propranolol reduced both. Converting enzyme activity was lowered with enalapril but was unchanged with propranolol. Both drugs reduced angiotensin II. Plasma aldosterone concentration was more suppressed with propranolol than with enalapril.", 
    "77": "The potency (pD2) and maximal contractile effect (Emax) of histamine, acetylcholine, carbachol and K+ were assessed from cumulative concentration-effect curves in guinea-pig isolated tracheal ring preparations with and without an intact epithelium. Estimates of Emax were not significantly different in epithelium-denuded preparations compared with those measured in intact preparations; pD2 values for acetylcholine, carbachol and K+ were not significantly altered. In contrast, the potency of histamine was significantly increased by about 4 fold in preparations devoid of epithelial cells. Estimates of potency and Emax were also determined for the smooth muscle relaxants isoprenaline, forskolin and theophylline (which increase intracellular cyclic AMP) and for nitroglycerin (which increases cyclic GMP) in both intact and epithelium-stripped tracheal rings. The pD2 values for these relaxants were not significantly altered by the removal of the epithelium. However, with the exception of nitroglycerin, Emax values for these relaxants were significantly lower in stripped than in intact tracheal rings that had been maximally precontracted with carbachol. The autoradiographic localisation of binding sites for the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor ligand [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (I-CYP) showed that the epithelium of the guinea-pig trachea had a 75 +/- 16% greater density of beta-adrenoceptors than the smooth muscle. Removing the epithelium did not significantly alter either the density of smooth muscle binding sites or the affinity of I-CYP binding. It was concluded that the reduced functional response of guinea-pig trachea to isoprenaline was probably not due to smooth muscle beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction. Results indicate that the epithelium plays an important role in the modulation of responsiveness of guinea-pig trachea to histamine and relaxants that mediate their effects by selectively increasing intracellular cyclic AMP levels.", 
    "78": "TR4979, an analogue of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was evaluated on respiratory and non-respiratory isolated tissues known to contain heterogeneous or homogeneous populations of the two classes of prostanoid (prostaglandins and thromboxanes) receptors. These receptors are classified as 'chi' the contractant/stimulant receptor with 'chi 1,2,3' being three subdivisions and 'psi' the relaxant/inhibitory receptor(s). On a respiratory tissue (cat trachea) containing predominantly 'psi'-receptors, TR4979 was 26 times less potent than PGE1 or PGE2. On other respiratory tissues known to contain mixtures of the 'chi 1,2,3'- and 'psi'-receptors (guinea-pig trachea and lung strip, cat lung strip and human bronchial muscle), TR4979 consistently acted as a potent relaxant whereas PGE2 and to a lesser extent PGE1 had significant contractant activities. Human pregnant uterus, guinea-pig and rat pseudo-pregnant uteri, rat colon and fundic strips and chick ileum are known to contain one or more of the three subclasses of the 'chi'-receptor. TR4979 (10(-9) -10(-5) M) was inactive on all these tissues whereas all of the reference prostanoids were contractants of varying potencies. PGE1 and histamine-induced contractions of the guinea-pig isolated ileum were both non-competitively antagonized by increasing concentrations of TR4979 suggesting that 'psi'-receptors also exist on this tissue. TR4979 is a highly selective agonist of prostanoid 'psi' (relaxant/inhibitory)-receptors which at present have been demonstrated to exist mainly in the lung. This prostaglandin analogue is a useful new selective pharmacological tool for revealing as yet unidentified prostanoid 'psi'-receptors and actions in a wide range of non-respiratory tissues/organs such as the guinea-pig ileum.", 
    "79": "The effect of repeated treatment of rats for 21 days with the monoamine reuptake inhibitors imipramine, zimeldine, alaproclate (in each case 10 mumol/kg b.i.d.) and the reversible monoamine oxidase-A inhibitor amiflamine (3 mumol/kg b.i.d.) on brain noradrenergic mechanisms measured at different times of the day and night was investigated. Imipramine treatment produced a down-regulation of the Bmax for 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding to cortical beta-adrenoceptors that was not dependent upon the time of day the animals were killed. Zimeldine, on the other hand, reduced both Bmax and Kd of binding for day-time, but not night-time samples. Alaproclate and amiflamine were without effect on the binding. Twenty-four hour mean values for 1 nM 3H-p-aminoclonidine binding to alpha 2-adrenoceptors were lower for the zimeldine-treated rats than for the saline-treated rats. Pineal melatonin concentrations, which are regulated by beta-adrenoceptors, showed a pronounced diurnal rhythm, with the highest concentrations being found at 02:00. At this time point, a lower pineal melatonin content was found after amiflamine treatment, whereas imipramine, zimeldine and alaproclate were without significant effect. The importance of the use of more than one time point and the use of more than one biochemical test for the determination of the effects of repeated antidepressant treatment on central noradrenergic systems measured ex vivo is discussed.", 
    "80": "To study the relative influence of parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation on the early adaptation of cardiac output (CO) to exercise, we determined the time constant and amplitude of the CO change in dogs following a stepwise increase in treadmill velocity. The animals were studied during control conditions, beta-blockade, vagal blockade and combined beta-blockade and vagal blockade. To measure CO, an electromagnetic flow probe was implanted around the ascending aorta. Vagal activity was blocked with coolers, implanted around the cervical vagosympathetic trunks. The time constant during beta-blockade (12.1 s) was not different from the control situation (11.4 s), but during vagal cooling it increased significantly (16.2 s), and with combined vagal cooling and beta-blockade it rose to 20.7 s. Thus the increase in cardiac output with exercise is accelerated most by the loss of vagal tone and to a lesser degree by sympathetic activation. The amplitude of the change in CO during control was 112%. Heart rate (HR) rose by 74% and stroke volume (SV) by 22%. Beta-blockade lowered the initial CO but did not alter the percentage increase. Vagal cooling, with or without beta-blockade, caused an increased initial HR but did not influence basal CO because of a concomitant reduction in SV. Exercise now increased HR less (21% and 30%, respectively) and SV more (52% and 52%) but the increase in CO did not change significantly (87% and 97%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "The development of beta 1-adrenergic receptors has been studied in the mouse forebrain from embryonic day 14 (E14) to adulthood, using autoradiographic visualization of [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding sites. From E14, ICYP binding sites are detected in moderate amounts in the striatum and basal forebrain and in very low concentration in the cortical plate. At E17, binding sites have increased in number in the deep layers of the embryonic cortex and extend over the whole thickness of the cortical ribbon at birth. On postnatal day 4 (P4), ICYP binding sites are more abundant in the superficial than in the inner cortex. By P10 the adult pattern of ICYP binding site distribution is achieved, namely: a high concentration in ventral pallidum, striatum and cortical layers I, II and III, a moderate concentration in layers V and VI and a lower density in septal areas and in cortical layer IV. It is well established that norepinephrine fibers arrive in the embryonic cortex early in development. The present results show that the development of norepinephrine fiber and beta 1 receptor systems are coincident in the mouse."
