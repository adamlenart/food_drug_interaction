    "0": "The risk of postoperative cardiac dysfunction is markedly increased by emergency coronary artery bypass grafting in the presence of acute myocardial ischemia. High dose beta-blockade during continuous coronary perfusion has been suggested as an alternative to conventional cardioplegia and this technique has been applied successfully in high risk patients for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. This study compared high dose beta-blockade with esmolol to continuous warm blood cardioplegia in a clinically oriented model of acute left ventricular (LV) ischemia and reperfusion.", 
    "1": "Twelve dogs were subjected to 60 min of regional LV ischemia by left anterior descending branch (LAD) ligation. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and aortic crossclamp were applied after 45 min of ischemia. Thereafter, high dose beta-blockade during continuous coronary perfusion (ESMO, n = 6) or antegrade continuous warm blood cardioplegia (WBC, n = 6) were maintained for 60 min. Myocardial water content (measured from endomyocardial biopsies using a microgravimetric technique), global LV function (preload recruitable stroke work: PRSW), and regional LV function (echocardiographic wall motion score) were determined at baseline and after weaning from CPB.", 
    "2": "During aortic crossclamp interstitial edema formation was significantly higher in the WBC group with an average water gain of 2.2 +/- 0.49 vs. 0.76 +/- 0.12% in the ESMO group. Thereafter, edema resolved in both groups, but myocardial water gain remained significantly higher in the WBC group at 60 and 120 min post CPB (0.98 +/- 0.19 and 1.13 +/- 0.32% vs. 0.07 +/- 0.25 and 0.04 +/- 0.08%). Global LV function was significantly higher in the ESMO group at 60 and 120 min post CPB (PRSW 103 +/- 6 and 94.7 +/- 4.6% of baseline vs. 85.3 +/- 4.9 and 74.7 +/- 7.6% of baseline). However, regional LV function showed no significant difference between groups.", 
    "3": "High-dose beta-blockade during continuous coronary perfusion may allow the surgeon to utilize the advantages of warm heart surgery, while avoiding the interstitial edema formation and temporary cardiac dysfunction associated with continuous warm blood cardioplegia. In high risk patients such as patients with unstable angina or after failed PTCA, high-dose beta-blockade may be an applicable alternative to cardioplegic arrest.", 
    "4": "The aim of this study was to examine the association between medication exposure and (1) unstimulated whole-salivary flow rate and (2) the severity of xerostomia among older people while adjusting for multiple medication use.", 
    "5": "Data were obtained from participants remaining at the five-year follow-up phase of a cohort study of community-dwelling older South Australians. Medication exposure information was available at baseline and at five years, enabling examination of the effects on dry mouth of long-term exposure to medications. At the five-year follow-up, unstimulated salivary flow was estimated using the spit method, and xerostomia severity was estimated using the 11-item Xerostomia Inventory. Because of the potential difficulties posed by polypharmacy, a two-stage analytical approach was employed: (1) Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used as an exploratory device to elucidate the relationships among the dependent and independent variables, and (2) linear regression analysis was used as a complementary procedure.", 
    "6": "Unstimulated flow rate was lower among individuals who were female or taking antidepressants at both baseline and five years, and higher among smokers or people who were taking hypolipidemic drugs. Xerostomia severity was higher among females, or individuals taking: (1) an anginal at baseline and five years, (2) an anginal without a concomitant betablocker at five years, (3) thyroxine and a diuretic at five years, or (4) antidepressants or antiasthma drugs at both baseline and at five years.", 
    "7": "These results suggest that polypharmacy can be accounted for to a certain extent by using CART analysis in conjunction with more conventional approaches; and that the relationship between medications and dry mouth is a complex one, and differs according to which aspect of dry mouth is being examined.", 
    "8": "Noradrenaline (NA) influences secretory function of the bovine corpus luteum (CL), stimulating secretion of progesterone and ovarian oxytocin (OT). To study whether NA is able to stimulate progesterone synthesis and to affect post-translational OT processing, different doses of NA alone or in combination with different doses of OT were added to bovine CL slices from 8 to 13 d of the estrous cycle. To determine which receptors NA affects, and if dopamine (DA) also affects CL function, we used NA or DA combined with a beta-antagonist (propranolol). The results indicated that NA stimulates both luteal progesterone and OT content; furthermore, it increased the activity of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) and peptidyl glycine-alpha-amidating mono-oxygenase (PGA), terminal enzymes in synthesis of these 2 hormones. The stimulating effect of NA was inhibited by propranolol and by pre-treatment of CL slices with high OT doses. Post-translational processing of OT synthesis by PGA activation was also stimulated by DA, but this effect was inhibited by beta-receptor blocker. Thus DA acts in CL as a NA precursor. In conclusion, it can be assumed that the noradrenergic system affects CL secretory function on different levels of regulation. Furthermore, a high concentration of OT in CL prevents NA from activating PGA and thus decreases post-translational OT synthesis.", 
    "9": "When comparing two treatments in a stratified trial with a binary endpoint, data are commonly analysed using a weighted averaging of the stratum-specific differences between proportions. Two popular sets of weights are the harmonic means of the stratum-specific sample sizes (SSIZE) and the reciprocals of the variances of the stratum-specific differences (INVAR). Either the SSIZE or INVAR weights are chosen and prespecified in the data analysis plan. We show that the 'wrong' choice between SSIZE and INVAR can result in a significantly inefficient analysis. To circumvent this potential problem, we propose a 'minimum risk' (MR) weighting strategy. The easy-to-compute MR weights are designed to yield more precise and less biased estimates of the overall treatment difference relative to the SSIZE and INVAR weights, respectively. We show, via a simulation study, that the proposed weights are an attractive compromise between the SSIZE and INVAR weights in terms of statistical power. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the utility of the MR weights.", 
    "10": "The perfusion of rat small intestinal lumen with epinephrine (0.1 mM) resulted in a significant increase in the amount of benzylpenicillin (BP) transported from the mucosal to the serosal side. In this study, the perfusion of the lumen with phenylephrine, clonidine, dobutamine, or salbutamol had no effect on BP transport. However, the combinations of phenylephrine and isoproterenol, clonidine and isoproterenol, and phenylephrine and salbutamol increased the BP transport to a similar extent as that observed with epinephrine alone. Tolazolin or propranolol inhibited the epinephrine-induced increase in BP transport. An increase in the intracellular concentration of cAMP in conjunction with specific activation of either alpha(1)- or alpha(2)-adrenoceptors induced an increase in BP transport similar to that observed in response to epinephrine alone. Staurosporine or N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide abolished the epinephrine-induced increase in BP transport. Peptides or either zwitterionic or anionic cephalosporins also blocked the effect of epinephrine on BP transport. The extent of BP uptake into brush border or basolateral membrane vesicles prepared from epinephrine-perfused intestinal loops was markedly greater than that into vesicles prepared from control loops. The perfusion of intestinal lumen with carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone, amiloride, or ouabain inhibited epinephrine-induced BP transport. These results indicate that the interaction of epinephrine with both beta(2)-adrenoceptors and either alpha(1)- or alpha(2-)adrenoceptors markedly stimulates the BP transport, an effect likely mediated by the enhancement of the function in the brush border membrane of intestinal epithelial cells coupled with the generation of an H(+) gradient.", 
    "11": "Although beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) blockers are used for the treatment of ischemic heart disease, the mechanisms of their beneficial actions have not been fully elucidated. In view of the role of sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) abnormalities in cardiac dysfunction due to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), we examined the effects of beta-AR blockers on the I/R-induced changes in SR Ca(2+) uptake and release, as well as the protein contents and gene expression of ryanodine receptor, SR Ca(2+)-pump, phospholamban, and calsequestrin. I/R in isolated rat hearts was induced by stopping the perfusion for 30 min and then reperfusing the ischemic hearts for 60 min. Hearts were treated with or without 10 microM atenolol, a beta(1)-specific blocker, or 10 microM propranolol, a nonspecific beta-blocker, 10 min before inducing ischemia as well as during the reperfusion period. I/R depressed cardiac performance, SR Ca(2+) uptake, and Ca(2+) release activities, protein contents, as well as Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylations, significantly. The mRNA levels for SR Ca(2+) pump, ryanodine receptors, phospholamban, and calsequestrin were also reduced by I/R. All these changes due to I/R were partially prevented by beta-AR blocker treatment. The results indicate that the beneficial effects of beta-AR blockers on cardiac performance in the I/R hearts may be related to the prevention of changes in SR Ca(2+) uptake and release activities, protein contents, as well as Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylations of SR proteins. On the other hand, the protection of I/R-induced alterations in mRNA levels for SR proteins by beta-AR blockers suggests cardiac SR gene expression as a molecular site of their cardioprotective action.", 
    "12": "Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) of alpha-agonists as chiral stationary phases was applied to the determination of enantiomers of various adrenergic drugs including alpha- and beta-agonists and beta-antagonists (beta-blockers). In this study, three MIPs imprinted with (+)-ephedrine, (+)-pseudoephedrine and (+)-norephedrine plus a non-imprinted polymer (non-MIP) were prepared, processed and coated on a glass support as thin layers. then enantiomeric determination of adrenergic drugs was carried out by development of their racemates on the TLC plates, using established conditions. From the results, the racemates of the compounds used as print molecules were well separated into two isomers on the MIP-plates, except on the plate based on MIP of (+)-norephedrine. Most adrenergic drugs structurally related to print molecules were completely resolved into two spots with the MIP plates. In general the retention of (+)-isomers (or 1S-isomers) was greater than that of (-)-isomers (or 1R-isomers), indicating the stereoselectivity of the MIPs with the former isomers. Moreover, the role between the chemical structures of the analytes with chiral recognition of the MIPs has been investigated. The proposed method enables rapid determination of enantiomers and screening of large numbers for optical purity of adrenergic drugs.", 
    "13": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in 20% to 40% of patients after CABG. Identification of patients vulnerable for arrhythmia will allow targeting of those most likely to benefit from prophylactic therapy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate accuracy of a prospectively defined signal-averaged P-wave duration (SAPD) cutoff and additional preoperative characteristics for the prediction of AF after CABG.", 
    "14": "Patients undergoing elective isolated CABG were recruited to the present prospective study. SAPD was recorded in all patients. Filtered signals from 3 orthogonal leads were combined in a vector analysis, and total SAPD was measured preoperatively. Postoperative in-hospital AF occurred in 92 (28.2%) of 326 patients. Patients who developed AF were older (65.9 versus 61.7 years of age; P<0.0005) and had longer SAPD (158 versus 145 ms; P<0.0005) than non-AF patients. Incidence of AF increased in patients > or =75 years of age and increased progressively throughout the range of SAPD. Stepwise logistic regression analysis of preoperative variables identified that SAPD >155 ms (odds ratio, 5.37; 95% CI, 3.10 to 9.30; P<0.0005), advanced age (odds ratio, 1. 53; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.86 per 5-year increase in age; P<0.0005), and male sex (odds ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.30 to 6.40; P<0.01) independently predicted AF. Prospectively defined SAPD >155 ms predicted AF with positive and negative predictive accuracy of 49% and 84%, respectively.",

    "16": "When C57BL/6 mice were partially hepatectomized (PHx), severe lymphocytosis was induced in the liver in the early phase of hepatocyte regeneration (4 to 12 hours after PHx). A major lymphocyte subset expanding in this organ was estimated to be natural killer 1.1(+) (NK1.1(+)) intermediate CD3 (CD3(int)) cells (i.e., NKT cells). CD3(int) cells are extrathymic T cells generated in situ in the liver. These changes were suppressed when mice with PHx were pretreated with a beta-adrenergicD antagonist (i.e., beta-blocker), propranolol (PPL). This might have been caused by sympathetic nerve stimulation during hepatocyte regeneration. An alpha-blocker showed a similar effect, although the magnitude of suppression was lower than that of the beta-blocker. We previously showed that NK and NKT cells express surface beta-adrenergic receptors and are activated in number by sympathetic nerve stimulation. In the present study, NK cytotoxicity mediated by liver lymphocytes obtained from mice with PHx decreased, whereas NKT cytotoxicity against syngeneic thymocytes increased. Purified CD3(int) cells were also found to be able to mediate NKT cytotoxicity against regenerating hepatocytes. These results suggest that sympathetic nerve stimulation after PHx results in subsequent activation of NKT cells and that these NKT cells might be associated with immunologic surveillance during hepatocyte regeneration.", 
    "17": "Despite the availability of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), mortality and morbidity remains unacceptably high. CHF is thought to progress as a result of activation of endogenous neurohormonal systems which are activated by the initial myocardial injury. The 2 neurohormonal systems which seem to be important in CHF are the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). While stimulation of the SNS has important circulatory support functions in the short term, long term activation appears to have deleterious effects on cardiac function and outcomes. The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the use of beta-blockers in patients with CHF. The published randomised clinical trials of beta-blockers in patients with CHF have shown very promising effects on mortality and morbidity. Several systematic overviews of these trials also suggest beneficial effects on mortality, hospitalisation for CHFE need for transplant, and ejection fraction. The effect of beta-blockers on exercise tolerance. New York Heart Association Function Class (NYHA-FC) and quality of life remain equivocal. The recent presentation of the results from several large-scale trials which were terminated early because of significant survival benefit, has removed any concern over the robustness of the mortality data. Available evidence suggests that a wide variety of patients with CHF, including the elderly, should be considered for beta-blocker therapy. Caution is warranted in the initiation and titration of therapy, as symptoms of CHF may transiently worsen. Whether all beta-blockers are equally efficacious remains unknown.", 
    "18": "Variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension is a frequent and severe complication of cirrhosis in children as in adults. The prophylactic approach is important for these high mortality bleedings, both for the first and for recurrent attacks. Variceal bleeding/rebleeding rates were evaluated in sixty patients with cirrhosis who received 1-2 mg/kg/day propranolol p.o. for 1-14 years. According to Child-Pugh classification, 33 patients were Class A, 22 Class B, and five Class C. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had variceal bleeding before starting propranolol treatment (secondary prevention; 15 patients) or not (primary prevention; 45 patients). Seven (15.6%) of 45 patients experienced bleeding on propranolol therapy in the primary prevention group, while eight (53.3%) of 15 patients bled in the secondary prevention group (p < 0.01). Propranolol was found effective in primary and secondary prevention in Class A patients, while it was effective only for primary prevention in Class B and C patients. Propranolol administration is useful for preventing first and recurrent variceal bleeding in Class A cirrhotic patients. In Class B and C cirrhotic patients, it is effective only for preventing the first bleeding episode.", 
    "19": "Non-invasive immobilization stress causes an increase in the plasma interleukin (IL)-6 level accompanied by increased IL-6 mRNA expression and IL-6 immunoactivity in the liver [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (1997) 238, 707-711]. In the present study, using rat primary cultured hepatocytes and non-parenchymal liver cells, the effect of norepinephrine (NE) on IL-6 mRNA expression was determined. IL-6 mRNA expression in hepatocytes, but not in non-parenchymal liver cells, increased when the cells were treated with NE. The stimulatory effect of NE was inhibited by the combined use of alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists. IL-6 mRNA expression in hepatocytes also increased on incubation with the culture medium of non-parenchymal liver cells treated with NE. The effect of the medium was blocked by an IL-1 receptor antagonist. Moreover, exogenous IL-1beta stimulated IL-6 mRNA expression in hepatocytes. IL-1beta was present in the medium of non-parenchymal liver cells and increased with NE-treatment. These results suggest that NE released from sympathetic nerve terminals during stress can directly increase IL-6 mRNA expression in hepatocytes and indirectly through IL-1beta production from non-parenchymal liver cells.", 
    "20": "To systematically review the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure.", 
    "21": "Studies investigating the management of AF in patients with heart failure published between 1967 to 1998 were identified using MEDLINE, the Cochrane register and Embase databases. Reference lists from relevant papers and reviews were hand searched for further papers.", 
    "22": "Eight studies pertaining to acute and twenty-four pertaining to chronic AF were identified. For patients with acute AF ventricular rate control, anticoagulation and treatment of heart failure should be pursued simultaneously before cardioversion is attempted. Digoxin is relatively ineffective at controlling ventricular response and for cardioversion. Intravenous diltiazem is rapidly effective in controlling ventricular rate and limited evidence suggests it is safe. Amiodarone controls ventricular rate rapidly and increases the rate of cardioversion. There are insufficient data to conclude that immediate anti-coagulation, trans-oesophageal echocardiography to exclude atrial thrombi followed by immediate cardioversion is an appropriate strategy. Patients with chronic AF should be anti-coagulated unless contra-indications exist. It is not clear whether the preferred strategy should be cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm with amiodarone or ventricular rate control of AF combined with anticoagulation to improve outcome including symptoms, morbidity and survival. Electrical cardioversion has a high initial success rate but there is also a high risk of early relapse. Amiodarone currently appears the most effective and safest therapy for maintaining sinus rhythm post-cardioversion. Digoxin is fairly ineffective at controlling ventricular rate during exercise. Addition of a beta-blocker reduces ventricular rate and improves symptoms. Whether digoxin is required in addition to beta-blockade for the control of AF in this setting is currently under investigation. If pharmacological therapy is ineffective or not tolerated then atrio-ventricular node ablation and permanent pacemaker implantation should be considered.", 
    "23": "There is a paucity of controlled clinical trial data for the management of AF among patients with heart failure. The interaction between AF and heart failure means that neither can be treated optimally without treating both. Presently treatment should be on a case by case basis.",

    "26": "A total of 1,018 patients were randomly assigned (504 to PTCA and 514 to medical treatment). The short form 36 (SF-36) self-administered quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at randomization and three months, one year and three years later. To date, 98% of patients reached one year and 67% reached three years.", 
    "27": "The PTCA group had significantly greater improvements in physical functioning, vitality and general health at both three months and one year, but not at three years. These quality-of-life scores were strongly related to breathlessness, angina grade and treadmill exercise time both at baseline and at one year. The treatment differences in quality of life are explained by the PTCA group's improvements in breathlessness, angina and exercise time. The attenuation of treatment difference at three years is partly attributed to 27% of medically treated patients receiving nonrandomized interventions in the interim. For both groups, there were also improvements in ratings of physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social functioning, pain and mental health, but for these the superiority of PTCA over medical treatment was less pronounced. After one year, 33% and 22% of the PTCA and medical groups, respectively, rated their health much better.", 
    "28": "Coronary angioplasty substantially improves patient-perceived quality of life, especially physical functioning and vitality, as compared with continued medical treatment. These differences are attributed to alleviation of cardiac symptoms (specifically, breathlessness and angina), but must be balanced against the small procedure-related risks of PTCA.", 
    "29": "The effects of jugular infusions of adrenalin and the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol on plasma concentrations of progesterone and oxytocin were examined at 2 different stages of the caprine estrous cycle. Adrenalin (25 micrograms.kg-1h-1) significantly (P < 0.05) increased oxytocin secretion on Day 3 and Day 10 of the cycle (estrus = Day 0); progesterone concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated on Day 10 alone. Propranolol had no effect on progesterone secretion yet significantly (P < 0.05) reduced oxytocin concentrations on Day 3. These results suggest that there may be neuroendocrine involvement in the regulation of luteal oxytocin secretion in the goat.", 
    "30": "Although in the past the use of beta-blockers was considered inadvisable in patients with chronic heart failure, recent evidence strongly recommends the use of these drugs for chronic heart failure due to their positive effects on mortality and hospitalization. This paper analyzes some of the possible mechanisms responsible for the positive action of beta-blockers in heart failure. In fact, the effects of reducing sympathetic activity by beta-blockers on the myocardium, skeletal muscle, inflammatory system, metabolism of free fatty acids and glucose, insulin resistance, serum electrolytes, renal function and oxygen free radical generation are illustrated and discussed.", 
    "31": "Coronary artery reference diameters increase during coronary angioplasty (PTCA). However, in clinical practice, balloon selection is often based on a preceding diagnostic coronary angiogram. It is common to find that the initially selected balloon is undersized due to resting vasomotor tone. This may contribute to a suboptimal angioplasty result.", 
    "32": "Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) was used to determine the magnitude of coronary artery vasodilatation over baseline angiography and its impact on balloon size choice. Pre-PTCA clinical and treatment variables were analyzed for their potential contribution to resting vasomotor tone.", 
    "33": "QCA of reference coronary diameters was performed in a group of 103 patients undergoing PTCA. Post PTCA proximal and distal reference diameters significantly increased over baseline. The average increase of the proximal segment was 0.368 mm (13.6%) p < 0. 001 and of the distal segment 0.567 mm (24.8%) p < 0.001. The initial nominal balloon diameter was smaller than the post PTCA proximal segment by an average of 0.34 mm (12.6%) p < 0.001. Of the clinical and treatment variables examined age < 65 years and pre-PTCA beta blocker use, significantly affected baseline vasomotor tone p < 0.05.", 
    "34": "Routine diagnostic angiography underestimates the true diameter of the coronary artery. Due to baseline vasomotor tone, coronary reference segments can be expected to increase approximately 13% in diameter during successful PTCA. Patients under 65 years of age and those using beta-blockers may have a significantly increased baseline vasomotor tone. Underestimation of coronary artery diameter based on initial angiography necessitated a second, larger balloon in 16.5% of cases.",

Aminophylline (50 mg x kg(-1) over 20 min followed by infusion at 1.75 mg x kg(-1) x hr(-1)) was administered as a model of acute theophylline intoxication. Dogs were randomly enrolled into four landiolol groups (0, 1, 10, 100 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) to treat tachyarrhythmias. Hemodynamic variables, heart rate (HR), systemic blood pressure (SBP), pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, and cardiac output (CO) were measured along with plasma concentrations of theophylline, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.",

A review of the literature suggests that acebutolol is one of the most toxic beta blockers when taken as an overdose. In addition to demonstrating characteristics of membrane-stabilizing activity, both fatal cases demonstrate significant QTc prolongation and ventricular tachycardia. The latter findings suggest an impact on ventricular repolarization not seen with Propranolol intoxication. Clarification of these findings has important implications regarding identification and treatment of this potentially fatal intoxication.", 
    "40": "Several studies have shown that carvedilol, a multiple action neurohumoral antagonist, reduces mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). In addition to being a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, carvedilol is a potent antioxidant. Since there is evidence for elevation of catecholamine levels in plasma and coronary artery endothelial cell injury in CHF, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that carvedilol inhibits epinephrine-induced apoptosis, and the inhibitory effect is mediated by modulation of Fas, Fas ligand (FasL) and caspase-3 pathway, in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs).", 
    "41": "HCAECs were exposed to epinephrine alone, carvedilol + epinephrine, or atenolol + epinephrine for 24 h. Epinephrine increased the number of apoptotic cells, measured by in situ nick end-labeling staining (from 4.2 +/- 1.3% to 28.6 +/- 6.0%, P < 0.01, n = 6) and by DNA laddering on agarose gel electrophoresis. Epinephrine also increased Fas and FasL protein expression (P < 0.01 vs. control, n = 6), and activated intracellular protease caspase-3 (P < 0.01 vs. control, n = 6). These effects of epinephrine were completely inhibited by carvedilol. Atenolol in equimolar concentration also attenuated epinephrine-mediated effects, but the effects of atenolol were less marked than those of carvedilol (P < 0.01). To explore the basis of differential effects of carvedilol and atenolol, effects of these agents on epinephrine-induced lipid peroxidation was measured. Lipid peroxidation was completely blocked by carvedilol, whereas equimolar concentration of atenolol had much less (P < 0.05) effect.", 
    "42": "Epinephrine induces apoptosis in HCAECs, and this effect is associated with activation of Fas-FasL and caspase-3 signal transduction pathway. Carvedilol can, more effectively than atenolol, inhibit these effects of epinephrine. The potent antioxidant effect of carvedilol is probably responsible for the superior effect.", 
    "43": "Apoptosis is a form of cell death that involves discrete genetic and molecular programs, de novo protein expression and a unique cellular phenotype. Evidence for the existence of apoptosis in the human heart has been reported in various cardiac diseases, including ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. Among the most potent stimuli that elicit cardiomyocyte apoptosis are: oxygen radicals (including NO), cytokines (FAS/TNF alpha-receptor signaling), stress conditions (chemical or physical, e.g., radiation), sphingolipid metabolites (ceramide) and autocoids, e.g., angiotensin II. Apoptosis of cardiac myocytes may contribute to progressive pump-failure, arrhythmias and cardiac remodeling. The recognition of numerous molecular targets associated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis may provide novel therapeutic strategies for diverse cardiac ailments, as recently suggested by pharmacologic studies in experimental animals.

In the present study, we compared the pharmacology of (+/-)pindolol, WAY-100635 (a 5-HT(1A) antagonist), GR127935 (a 5-HT(1B/1D) antagonist), and isamoltane (a 5-HT(1B) antagonist), when given acutely in combination with fluoxetine, using in vivo microdialysis in the frontal cortex of the freely moving rat. We have determined that the acute fluoxetine-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT can be augmented by (+/-)pindolol, WAY100635, GR127935 and isamoltane with maximum increases of 216+/-32%, 235+/-49%, 240+/-18% and 171+/-47% of preinjection control levels, respectively. Combination of both 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B/1D) autoreceptor antagonists with fluoxetine produced additive increases in extracellular 5-HT (i.e. WAY100635+GR127935+fluoxetine and WAY100635+isamoltane+fluoxetine produced a four- and five-fold potentiation, respectively), suggesting that this strategy may be useful in further augmenting the action of a SSRI in the treatment of depression. In addition, by comparing the combined administration of (+/-)pindolol with either WAY100635, GR127935 or isamoltane, we have determined that (+/-)pindolol produces much of its acute potentiation of fluoxetine-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT via its action at the 5-HT(1B/D) receptor in addition to any activity it has at the presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor.",

These positive chronotropic and coronary vasoconstrictor effects were not attenuated by the beta- and alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists atenolol and prazosin, respectively. Furthermore, sphingosine 1-phosphate did not affect the adenylate cyclase activity of the membrane preparations made from the canine right atrium and right ventricle, indicating the involvement of a novel signaling pathway in sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced cardiac effects.",

    "53": "The dose-response and duration effects of acute administration of the dopamine transporter (DAT) blocker cocaine and GBR12909 on dopamine synthesis and transporter availability were evaluated in the brains of conscious monkeys using high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) in combination with microdialysis. Rate of dopamine synthesis and DAT availability were evaluated using L-[beta-11C]DOPA and [11C]beta-CFT (WIN35,428), respectively. Administration of cocaine (0.5, 2 and 5 mg/kg) resulted in dose-dependent elevation of dopamine level in the striatal extracellular fluid (ECF) at 0.5 h after injection, and returned to the baseline level within 1.5 h post-injection. At 0.5 post-injection, cocaine reduced dopamine synthesis rate and DAT availability in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction of DAT availability by cocaine (2 mg/kg) returned to baseline level at 3 h post-injection and thereafter. Interestingly, dopamine synthesis rate was significantly higher at 3 h than baseline level and returned to baseline level 5.5 h post-injection. When GBR12909 (0.5, 2 and 5 mg/kg) was administered 0.5 h before tracer injection, dopamine synthesis rate and DAT availability were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. These reductions induced by GBR12909 (2 mg/kg) lasted at least until 5.5 h post-injection. GBR12909 induced dose-dependent elevation of dopamine level in ECF, and the elevation lasted up to 7 h. The present results indicated that cocaine and GBR12909 affect dopamine synthesis rate and DAT availability in the striatum with difference time courses as measured by PET in the conscious monkey brains.",

    "55": "Cardiac autonomic neuropathy is a common complication in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, little is known about when this impairment occurs during the time course of the disease. Analysis of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) variability could be used to detect early signs of autonomic alteration. To test this proposal, twelve sexually mature male Yucatan miniature pigs were equipped with an arterial catheter for telemetric BP analysis, and with a venous access. BP and HR were recorded together with respiratory movements while the animals were resting in a sling. After the first recording session performed when the pigs were 5 months old, streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce diabetes in seven pigs, while the five others were controls. BP and HR were measured 3 and 6 months after the onset of diabetes and at a similar age in the controls. BP and HR oscillated at the respiratory range (0.19 Hz). Spectral analysis showed this respiratory component was the main determinant of the short-term variability of BP and HR. Atropine increased HR and BP and markedly diminished the respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Propranolol diminished HR and the respiratory peak of HR. A reduced respiratory oscillation of BP paralleled the diminution of the respiratory peak of HR. Baroreceptor-HR reflex was estimated using injections of phenylephrine and nitroprusside, and by cross-spectral analysis between BP and HR. Atropine shifted the curve to higher HR values, while propranolol reduced the level of the upper plateau. Atropine decreased both the coherence and gain of the cross-spectral analysis. STZ injection resulted in a type 1 diabetes. At 3 months, diabetic pigs exhibited low levels of BP and a reduced overall variability of HR and BP. Spectral analysis indicated the respiratory sinus arrhythmia was markedly reduced. In addition, the sensitivity of the baroreceptor-HR reflex was reduced. At a latter stage of diabetes these alterations were marked and the level of the resting HR was increased. These data demonstrate the dual (vagal and sympathetic) control of HR in pigs and the dominant role of respiration in the genesis of HR and BP fluctuations. The spectral and cross-spectral analysis of BP and HR were altered after 3 months of diabetes and could be proposed as early detectors of cardiac autonomic neuropathy.", 
    "56": "Ovarian granulosa cell and testicular Sertoli cell functions are regulated by the tropic action of the pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which may exert pleiotropic effects using a variety of signaling pathways. The effects of FSH on the mobilization of Ca(2+) into granulosa and Sertoli cells have been widely studied, but whether all the effects of the hormone are mediated by the single G-protein-coupled (G(s)) receptor with the seven-transmembrane structure (R1) has remained an enigma. With the object of resolving this mystery, we have compared the hormonal responses of HEK 293 cells transfected with three different cloned FSH receptor cDNAs of testis/ovary, designated R1 (G(s)), R2 (similar to R1 but having a shorter carboxyl terminus), and R3, a novel FSH receptor exhibiting a growth factor type I receptor motif. The latter two that use the same DNA segment for alternative splicing of the single large 80- to 100-kilobase gene create different structural motifs and carboxyl termini. Of the three receptors, only the FSH-R3 type induced a significant rise in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), as measured by single cell fluorescence digital imaging with the Ca(2+) sensitive dye fura-2AM. FSH induced a rapid [Ca(2+)](i) response that was concentration dependent. The response was hormone-specific, as neither its individual alpha/beta subunits nor the related glycoprotein hormone LH were effective. To determine whether the [Ca(2+)](i) response was due to Ca(2+) influx or to intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, cells were exposed to Ca(2+)-free buffer and to the Ca(2+)-channel blocker diltiazem (10(-5) M). FSH-Induced [Ca(2+)](i) responses were inhibited in Ca(2+)-free buffer and abrogated in the presence of diltiazem. These novel data demonstrate that FSH can increase [Ca(2+)](i) through L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels via the growth factor type 1 receptor. Our findings support the concept that different receptor motifs act to integrate intracellular signaling events.",

The method is based on precipitation of the ion associates formed from the reaction of (1), (2) or (3) with manganese thiocyanate and/or potassium ferricyanide. The solubility of the solid complexes at the optimum conditions of pH and ionic strength values have been studied. Saturated solutions of each ion-associate were prepared under the optimum conditions and the metal ion content in the supernatant was determined. The method has been used for the determination of 1.14-17.07, 1.18-17.75 and 1.08-16.24 microg/ml of (1), (2) and (3), respectively using manganese thiocyanate and 1.71-25.60, 1.77-26.62 and 1.62-24.36 microg/ml of (1), (2) and (3), respectively using potassium ferricyanide.

This study examines the relationship between beta(3a)- and beta(3b)-adrenoceptor (AR) mRNA levels, beta(3)-AR binding and changes in ileum responses in mice treated with the beta(3)-AR agonist (R, R)-5-[2[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino]-propyl]1, 3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate (CL316243), or the beta(3)-AR antagonist 3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1S)-1,2,3, 4-tetrahydronapth-1-ylamino]-2S-2-propanol oxalate (SR59230A), or dexamethasone or forskolin. 2. Levels of beta(3a)- and beta(3b)-AR mRNA and the maximum number of binding sites (B(max)) in ileum were unaffected following CL316243 treatment, although responses to CL316243 were reduced by 50% following 4 and 24 h treatment, indicating another desensitization mechanism not involving changes in receptor expression or number. beta(3a)-AR mRNA levels were reduced in both brown (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) but beta(3b)-AR mRNA levels were significantly reduced only in WAT. Levels of beta(3a)- and beta(3b)-mRNA returned towards normal with continued treatment. 3. SR59230A treatment markedly increased beta(3)-AR mRN levels in ileum and BAT but not in WAT. The increase in beta(3)-AR mRNA levels in ileum was associated with increased B(max) levels in binding analysis and increased responses to CL316243, suggesting these as the cause of sensitization. 4. Treatment with forskolin (4 h) or dexamethasone (4 h) significantly reduced beta(3a)-AR mRNA levels in BAT and WAT but did not alter levels in ileum. Responses to CL316243 in ileum were unaffected by either treatment. 5. In summary, the beta(3)-AR is differently regulated in adipose tissue and ileum: Treatment with SR59230A increased beta(3)-AR number, mRNA and responsiveness in ileum, whereas treatment with CL316243 reduced responses without affecting beta(3)-AR number or mRNA levels.",

IOP was reduced from baseline levels 25.1+/-3.5 mm Hg (mean+/-SD) in 183 patients initially randomized to treatment with latanoprost to 17.4+/-2.9 mm Hg (n=66) after 24 months of treatment. For patients initially randomized to treatment with timolol the corresponding figures were 24.3+/-2.3 mm Hg (n=72) and 17.4+/-2.6 (n=41) mm Hg after 18 months of treatment with latanoprost. Two patients were withdrawn because of uncontrolled IOP and 11 patients required additional timolol treatment to maintain an adequate IOP control. Patients initially treated with timolol and switched to latanoprost had a further reduction of the IOP of 1.0 mm Hg after 6 months of treatment with latanoprost (p<0.005). 46 patients were withdrawn from the study, mostly due to increased iris pigmentation or an iris color with known high risk of developing increased pigmentation. 22 patients developed increased pigmentation of the iris. The follow-up revealed no previously unknown ocular or systemic side effects.",

At the end of the study the break-up time (BUT) was significantly decreased in the timolol group but not in the latanoprost group. The BUT still remained in the normal range in both groups, although it is important to note that timolol was administered at half the clinical dose. Both latanoprost and timolol tended to increase Rose-Bengal staining of the cornea and conjunctiva after one month of treatment but no statistically significant difference was found between the groups.

    "67": "The alternate pathway of signal transduction via hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, the major cellular phospholipid, has been investigated in murine peritoneal macrophages. A sustained formation of diacylglycerol, is preceded by an enhanced production of phosphatidic acid, when the macrophages were given a stimulus with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate for sixty minutes. Production of choline and choline metabolites are significantly increased too. Propranolol, which inhibits phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, the enzyme responsible for conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, can effectively block the formation of diacylglycerol. Inhibition of protein kinase C either by its inhibitors, staurosporine and H-7 or by depletion, apparently affect the generation of the lipid products. Moreover, based on the results of transphosphatidylation reaction, involvement of a phospholipase D in the phosphatidylcholine-hydrolytic pathway in macrophages is predicted. These observations support the view that probably the phorbol ester acting directly on protein kinase C of the macrophages activate their phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D to allow a steady generation of second messengers, to enable them to participate in the cell signalling process in a more efficient manner than those generated in the phosphoinositide pathway of signal transduction.",

This meta-analysis aimed at clarifying their effect on sudden death, the magnitude of their benefit according to the cause of heart failure, and whether there is any difference between vasodilating and nonvasodilating agents.", 
    "69": "Randomized, clinical trials were included if they evaluated a beta-adrenergic blocking agent without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, included a control group receiving placebo or standard treatment, evaluated mortality on an intention-to-treat basis, and lasted at least 8 weeks.", 
    "70": "Twenty-one trials with 5,849 patients (3,130 receiving beta-blockers) were included. Median length of treatment was 6 months. Most patients had mild or moderate heart failure and were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. The beta-blockers significantly reduced overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and mortality due to pump failure and sudden death by 34% to 39%. The decrease in overall mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) (30%) was no different from that among patients with non-IHD (26%) (P = .08). The reduction in overall mortality was greater with vasodilating than with nonvasodilating agents (45% vs 27%; P = .007), particularly in patients without IHD (62%), compared with those with IHD (22%; P =.03).",

    "72": "The influence of 15-day treatments with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (120 micrograms/kg/d) or the antagonist propranolol (1.00 mg/kg/d) on acid phosphatase and zinc levels in the ventral prostate was examined in intact rats, rats simultaneously injected with dexamethasone (0.25 mg/kg/d) and animals chemically castrated with a single dose of ethane dimethanesulphonate (75 mg/kg). Isoproterenol-treatment significantly increased acid phosphatase concentration in the ventral prostate of intact rats, whereas propranolol prevented a glandular zinc loss induced by dexamethasone administration. These results demonstrate that the levels of both biochemical parameters in the prostate can be altered by beta-adrenergic receptor manipulation. The responsiveness of the two secretory processes is different and depends on the functional status of the ventral prostate.", 
    "73": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the beta-adrenergic blocker carvedilol on nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in cardiac myocytes. We measured the accumulation of nitrite, a stable oxidation product of NO, and the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protein in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Incubation of the cultures with interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta; 10 ng/ml) caused a marked increase in nitrite production. Although carvedilol alone showed no effect on nitrite accumulation, it significantly enhanced IL-1 beta-induced nitrite production by cardiac myocytes. The effect of carvedilol was completely abolished in the presence of aminoguanidine or actinomycin D. The nitrite production enhanced by carvedilol was accompanied by increased iNOS protein expression. Unlike carvedilol, other beta-blockers, namely propranolol, atenolol and arotinolol, did not enhance IL-1 beta-induced nitrite production. Addition of isoproterenol significantly increased nitrite production by IL-1 beta-stimulated cardiac myocytes. Atenolol suppressed this isoproterenol-induced nitrite accumulation, while carvedilol further increased the nitrite accumulation. These findings indicate that carvedilol increases NO synthesis in IL-1 beta-stimulated rat cardiac myocytes by a beta-adrenoceptor-independent mechanism.", 
    "74": "Continuous intravenous infusion of norepinephrine norepinephrine (NE, 0.1 mg/kg/h) induced hypertrophy of the left ventricle (LV), but not of the right ventricle (RV) in rats, although RV systolic pressure (RVSP) was much more elevated than LVSP. After NE infusion, there was a time-dependent (20 min to 72 h) expression in the mRNA of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 beta. The expression of IL-6 increased markedly and reached the maximum after 4 h with an 80-fold elevation. In the RV, the expression increased only 20-fold. The mRNA of IL-1 beta increased significantly after NE stimulation only in the LV and reached the maximum after 12 h with a 12-fold elevation. After 12 h of NE infusion, colligin mRNA was elevated for the first time with further progression until 72 h. The six-fold abundance of colligin mRNA seen after 72 h was significantly higher in the LV than in the RV. A similar increase was observed on the protein level (Western blotting). The expression of collagen I and III increased significantly after 24 h only in the LV. After 72 h, the mRNA expression of collagen I was increased 16-fold and that of collagen III 10-fold. This expression was significantly higher than that in the RV. Also the elevation in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA started earlier and was more pronounced in the LV than in the RV. The alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker carvedilol normalized all functional parameters after 6 h and 72 h and prevented the development of LV hypertrophy that occurred after 72 h. The NE-induced increased expression of the mRNAs studied was either prevented (IL-6, IL-1 beta ) or attenuated (colligin, collagen I and III, ANP) by combined alpha- and beta-receptor blockade. The elevation of afterload which was associated with the NE effect was normalized by the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipin, but NE-induced LV hypertrophy and the increase in ANP and collagen mRNA were not affected.", 
    "75": "The C-terminal domain of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) consists of a conserved region and a variable region, and the variable region has been shown to direct the membrane translocation of cytosolic enzymes. The present work has revealed that the C-terminal domain may also be involved in kinase-receptor interaction that is primarily mediated by the conserved region. Truncation of the C-terminal domain or deletion of the conserved region in this domain of GRK2 resulted in a complete loss of its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin and in an obvious decrease in its sensitivity to receptor-mediated phosphorylation of a peptide substrate. On the contrary, deletion of the betagamma subunit binding region in the C-terminal domain of GRK2 did not significantly alter the ability of the enzyme to phosphorylate rhodopsin. In addition, the recombinant proteins that represent the C-terminal domain and the conserved region of GRK2 could inhibit GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin and receptor-mediated activation of GRK2 but not GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the peptide substrate. Furthermore, the conserved region as well as the C-terminal domain could directly bind rhodopsin in vitro. These results indicate that the C-terminal domain, or more precisely, the conserved region of this domain, is important for enzyme-receptor interaction and that this interaction is required for GRK2 to catalyze receptor phosphorylation.", 
    "76": "Recent studies of atrial fibrillation, or rather \"atrial fibrillations\", have been based on focal atrial fibrillation which seems to be one of the commonest forms of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. This observation led to the possibility of ablative therapy, usually near the pulmonary veins. Technological advances are awaited before a wider diffusion of this therapy becomes possible. In the field of defibrillation, the MUSTT study demonstrated the value of implantable defibrillators in the prevention of sudden death, in this trial in the case of asymptomatic high risk patients after myocardial infarction, with a decreased ejection fraction and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Two large scale randomised controlled trials (MERIT-HF and CIBIS II) have confirmed the value of betablockers in preventing sudden death, in patients with moderate or severe cardiac failure in association with classical treatment by diuretics, ACE inhibitors and digitalis. Similarly, for spironolactone, the RALES study showed a reduced incidence of sudden death in cardiac failure, as its physiopathological modes of action suggested. New techniques of three-dimensional mapping have confirmed their value. Finally, significant progress has been made in the field of genetics of cardiac arrhythmias, indicating that, in years to come, it will be possible to identify most of the genes responsible for conditions predisposing to arrhythmias.", 
    "77": "Cardiac failure has become a major but underestimated public health problem. The EPICAL study in France confirmed the severity of this condition. In addition to the neuro-hormones, the role played by inflammatory cytokines in the progression of the disease has been emphasized. The importance of the \"genetic background\" in the development and evolution of cardiac failure has been demonstrated (deletion or prospective polymorphism). From the therapeutic point of view, besides the hopes raised by multisite pacing, the betablockers and spironolactone have been shown to provide major functional improvement and prolonged survival, and they take their place with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in our pharmacological arsenal. Cellular transplantation is associated with encouraging pre-clinical results which open up a new field of interest. Finally, global management, including physical rehabilitation and patient education by plury-disciplinary teams, provides medical and economic benefits. The year 1999 has been particularly rich in the field of cardiac failure from the basis of fundamental research to the organisation of health care.", 
    "78": "In the HOT-study 18,790 patients in 26 countries (age 50-80 years, mean age 61.5 years) with hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 115 mm Hg--mean value 105 mm Hg) were randomised into 3 groups with different target blood pressures (90 mm Hg, 85 mm Hg, 80 mm Hg). The basic treatment was with Felodipin (5 mg q. d.): if the target pressure was not achieved, further steps were initiated: either ACE-inhibitors or -blockers were added, in a third step the Felodipindose was increased to 100 mg and in a further step the doses of ACE-inhibitors or -blockers were doubled. If target pressure was still not achieved, a diuretic was added. Furthermore half of the patients in all groups received either placebo or 75 mg acetyl-salicylic acid. To prevent cardiovascular events the best benefit was shown, when a diastolic pressure of 82.6 mm Hg was reached. Acetyl-salicylic acid showed a further benefit in preventing myocardial infarction, but not in preventing strokes.", 
    "79": "Oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) similar to that seen in premature infants can be produced in newborn rats by exposure to 80% oxygen for the first 5 days of life, with subsequent recovery for 7 days in a room air environment. Previous studies have shown that the latter phase is associated with degeneration of retinal astrocytes. In the absence of astrocytes, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is produced by the neurons of the inner retina. In this study, immunohistochemical methods were used to assess retinal expression of VEGF protein in ratlings exposed to the above protocol, with and without simultaneous treatment with topical timolol maleate. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and arterial pressure were measured. The severity of OIR was also evaluated in retinal flat mounts after India ink perfusion. The mean IOP was 8.25 +/- 0.32 mm Hg in untreated ratlings and 5.15 +/- 0.24 mm Hg in timolol-treated animals. OIR in retinas from the timolol group was less severe than that seen in untreated ratlings. VEGF protein expression was almost completely absent in the latter group. Retinas from timolol-treated animals expressed VEGF protein, though the level was inferior to that found in controls raised under room air conditions. In conclusion, these data seem to indicate that experimental OIR can be attenuated by a reduction of the IOP during and after oxygen supplementation. It is possible that these effects are due to improved ocular perfusion pressure, which would mitigate the hypoxic insult to the retina during the room air recovery period.", 
    "80": "The combination therapy with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists, or calcium channel antagonists may exert more beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases than monotherapy. Perindopril, candesartan cilexetil, or amlodipine alone or the combination of low doses of each agent was administered orally to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) for 4 weeks to compare the hypotensive or cardiovascular effects. Although perindopril (2 mg/kg), candesartan cilexetil (2 mg/kg), or amlodipine (3 mg/kg) alone caused comparable hypotensive effects in SHRSP, monotherapy with perindopril or candesartan decreased left ventricular (LV) weight; mRNA levels for atrial natriuretic factor, skeletal alpha-actin, and collagen types I and III; and aortic weight and platelet-derived growth factor-beta receptor tyrosine phosphorylation to a greater extent than monotherapy with amlodipine. Although monotherapy with a low dose (0.2 mg/kg) of perindopril or candesartan cilexetil did not significantly reduce the LV mRNA levels and aortic platelet-derived growth factor-beta receptor phosphorylation of the SHRSP, combination therapy at such a low dose normalized these parameters more potently than the use of amlodipine (3 mg/kg) alone. Although perindopril or candesartan cilexetil alone at 0.05 mg/kg did not decrease the blood pressure of the SHRSP, such a low dose of combination therapy decreased LV weight and atrial natriuretic factor mRNA levels of the SHRSP to a greater extent than amlodipine alone or amlodipine combined with perindopril or candesartan cilexetil. Our results provide evidence that suggests the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an AT(1) receptor antagonist may be more effective in the treatment of cardiac and vascular diseases than the combination of a calcium channel blocker with an ACE inhibitor or an AT(1) receptor antagonist or monotherapy with each agent.", 
    "81": "The present study evaluated the effects of blocking kinins with the bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist Hoe140 on the relationship between renal perfusion pressure, papillary blood flow (PBF), and sodium excretion. To determine the relevance of renal kinins in the long-term control of arterial pressure, the effect of a chronic intrarenal infusion of Hoe140 on arterial pressure and sodium balance was also studied. PBF was not autoregulated in volume-expanded rats, and the administration of Hoe140 reduced PBF (-30%) and improved PBF autoregulation. The kinin antagonist also decreased sodium excretion (-35%) and blunted pressure natriuresis with no whole-kidney renal hemodynamic changes. These effects may be mediated through nitric oxide (NO), because in rats pretreated with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, Hoe140 had no additional effects on PBF or pressure natriuresis. A role for NO in mediating the renal response to Hoe140 is also supported by the finding that Hoe140 reduced basal urinary NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) excretion (-33%), and it blunted the arterial pressure-induced increase in NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) excretion, which is compatible with the idea that the pressure-natriuresis response may be mediated through kinins and NO. The importance of kinins in long-term regulation of arterial pressure is demonstrated by the severe arterial hypertension (172+/-6 mm Hg) induced during the chronic intrarenal infusion of Hoe140 associated with sodium and volume retention. These data suggest that renal kinins and NO may be a part of the renal mechanism coupling changes in arterial pressure with modifications in PBF and sodium excretion, therefore contributing to the long-term control of arterial pressure.",

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and beta-blockers were used as model solutes. The functional groups, pentafluorophenyl (PFP), OH, CN or CH3 were attached to the silica via a propyl chain. The effects of these stationary phases as well as C8 and C18 phases on retention and peak shape of the basic drugs were studied. The CN and PFP phases adequately retained (tR of 2 to 6 min) the basic drugs when the mobile phase was composed of 90% acetonitrile, whereas with the C4, C8 and C18 phases, less than 40% acetonitrile had to be used to provide adequate retention of the basic drugs. Because acetonitrile provides better desolvation in ESI than an aqueous solvent, it produces an increased MS signal. As an example of the HPLC-ESI-MS analysis of the beta-blocker, pindolol, on a CN phase, the use of 90% acetonitrile in the mobile phase increased the ESI-MS signal by 790% when compared to a C18 phase which could use only 5% acetonitrile in the mobile phase for retention of the solute. In addition, the CN and PFP phases provided better peak shape than the OH phase and the hydrophobic phases (C4, C8 and C18) and ion-pairing or ion-suppressing agents were not required. The retention behavior of the TCAs and beta-blockers on each of the phases is described.",

Urine samples were prepared by liquid liquid extraction, followed by HPLC. The racemic metoprolol and internal standard were separated from the interfering components in urine and quantified on the silica column, and the enantiomers were determined on a Chiralcel OD chiral stationary phase. The two columns were connected by a switching valve equipped with a silica trap column. Detection limit was 25 ng/ml for each enantiomer. The intra-day variation ranged between 0.38 and 4.94% in relation to the measured concentration and the inter-day variation was 0.15-3.13%. It has been applied to the determination of (R)-(+)-metoprolol and (S)-(-)-metoprolol in urine from healthy volunteers dosed with racemic metoprolol tartrate.",

The solubility of the solid complexes at the optimum conditions of pH and ionic strength values have been studied. Saturated solutions of each ion-associate were prepared under the optimum conditions and the metal ion content in the supernatant was determined.

    "86": "The main objective of fixed dose combination therapy for hypertension is to improve blood pressure (BP) control with lower, better tolerated dosages of 2 antihypertensives rather than higher dosages of a single agent. Felodipine and metoprolol lower BP via different, but complementary, mechanisms and controlled release formulations of these 2 drugs are available as a fixed dose combination, felodipine/metoprolol. In clinical trials in patients with hypertension, felodipine/metoprolol was significantly more effective than placebo and the respective monotherapies administered at the same dosages. Mean BP was reduced to < 155/90 mm Hg in patients treated with combination therapy and controlled in approximately 70% of patients. In one study that titrated dosages to effect, fewer felodipine/metoprolol than felodipine or metoprolol monotherapy recipients required dosage increases to achieve BP control (45 vs 60 and 67%, respectively). Data from double blind comparative studies show that the antihypertensive efficacy of felodipine/metoprolol 5 to 10/50 to 100 mg/day is significantly greater than that of enalapril monotherapy or captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide and equivalent to nifedipine/atenolol and amlodipine. In comparisons with enalapril, fewer felodipine/metoprolol than enalapril recipients required dosage titration to achieve BP control. Compared with amlodipine, felodipine/metoprolol significantly reduced mean 24-hour average BP (8.9/5.5 vs 14.4/9.5 mm Hg after 6 weeks; p < 0.001). Both treatments preserved diurnal rhythm. Long term follow-up studies show that the antihypertensive effect of felodipine/metoprolol occurs mostly during the first month of treatment with small additional decreases in BP being observed in the second and third months, and a relatively constant effect thereafter. According to a validated questionnaire, quality of life was relatively similar during 12 weeks treatment with felodipine/metoprolol, enalapril or placebo. In a retrospective pharmacoeconomic analysis conducted in Sweden, felodipine/metoprolol was more cost effective than enalapril as initial treatment for hypertension. Peripheral oedema, headache and flushing were the most commonly reported adverse events with felodipine/metoprolol and felodipine monotherapy, whereas dizziness, fatigue, headache and respiratory infection were more frequent with metoprolol monotherapy. Dose-dependent adverse events such as oedema may occur less often in patients taking lower dosages in combination than in those taking higher dosages of felodipine monotherapy. Thus, patients with hypertension treated with felodipine/metoprolol experience greater control of BP, with less need for dosage titration, than those treated with felodipine, metoprolol or enalapril monotherapy. Importantly this greater efficacy does not appear to be associated with a higher incidence of adverse events relative to monotherapy. Additionally, in short term studies felodipine/metoprolol had a similar (minimal) effect on QOL to enalapril monotherapy but was more cost effective.", 
    "87": "Within the short span of half a century, the treatment of variceal bleeding has become highly differentiated, with multiple treatment options. Pharmacological therapy with beta-blockers is well established for preventing the first variceal bleeding. The utility of adding a vasodilator to beta-blockers needs to be studied further. Octreotide is widely used as an adjuvant to standard endoscopic treatment to prevent variceal rebleeding, and the utility of this approach has been validated in several randomized controlled trials. Band ligation is well established, and its popularity has increased with the introduction of multiple ligation devices. The technical simplicity and safety of band ligation has sparked interest in using this technique for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. However, randomized trials have not shown any advantage for band ligation over beta-blocker therapy, and the high variceal recurrence rate after band ligation may eliminate any theoretical advantage. A synchronous combination of band ligation and sclerotherapy has not been shown to improve the results of band ligation alone, but a metachronous approach using sclerotherapy to treat recurrent varices after band ligation has shown beneficial results. Histoacryl remains the best treatment option for gastric varices, but band ligation and loop ligation have shown promising results, and should be considered when Histoacryl is not available. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration is a new radiological modality for gastric varices, and one that sounds promising. TIPS is well established as an alternative to elective endoscopic treatment. Compared with endoscopic treatment, TIPS has been shown to improve the survival rate in one randomized trial. However, the cost and complications of TIPS have restricted its use. The use of endoscopic ultrasound for Doppler studies of blood flow in portal hypertension is currently investigational, but it may gain a role in selecting the optimal treatment approach for the individual patient.", 
    "88": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether central beta-adrenoceptors are involved in stress-induced cardiovascular responses in rats. Using a biotelemetry system, blood pressure and heart rate were measured at rest and during stress induced by immersion in 1 cm-deep water. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, DL-propranolol (5 or 50 microg), significantly and dose dependently attenuated the tachycardia induced by water immersion stress (drug-induced reduction of tachycardia at 5 min after the start of stress: 61.4 +/- 13.2% for 5 microg, 72.5 +/- 8.2% for 50 microg). The same doses of DL-propranolol had no effect on the resting heart rate. Injection (i.c.v.) of a lower dose (5 microg) of D-propranolol--which has a lower potency as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist than DL-propranolol, but a similar local anesthetic, membrane-stabilizing activity--did not attenuate the stress-induced tachycardia, although a higher dose (50 microg) did. Intravenous administration of DL-propranolol (5 or 50 microg) significantly attenuated the stress-induced tachycardia (drug-induced reduction of tachycardia at 5 min after the start of stress: 20.0 +/- 7.5% for 5 microg, 42.4 +/- 3.4% for 50 microg). However, the attenuation was much smaller than in the i.c.v. DL-propranolol-injected group. The i.c.v. injection of the 50 microg dose of DL-propranolol significantly augmented both the resting blood pressure and the pressor response to water immersion stress, whereas the lower dose (5 microg) had no effect. The i.c.v. injection of 50 microg D-propranolol also augmented, although not significantly, the resting blood pressure and the pressor response to stress. These results suggest that central beta-adrenoceptors are involved in the tachycardia induced by water immersion stress in rats.",

I(Kr) block with d-sotalol (LQT2) and augmentation of late I(Na) with ATX-II (LQT3) prolonged APD90 of M more than EPI and ENDO, causing increases in QT and TDR. TdP developed in the absence of isoproterenol. In LQT2 isoproterenol initially prolonged, then abbreviated, the APD90 of M but always abbreviated EPI, thus transiently increasing TDR and the incidence of TdP. In LQT3, isoproterenol always abbreviated APD90 of the three cell types, causing a persistent decrease in TDR and suppression of TdP. The arrhythmogenic as well as protective actions of isoproterenol were reversed by propranolol.",

In the hydropic group, 10 received single-drug therapy (digoxin or sotalol) and 7 received multidrug therapy. In the nonhydropic group, 13 received a single drug (digoxin or sotalol) and 5 received multiple drugs. One patient with rapid 1:1 atrioventricular conduction (heart rate 480 beats/min) died in utero and another died due to a combination of severe hydrops because of the AF, sotalol medication, stenosis of the venous duct and hypoplastic placenta. Of the 43 live-born infants, 12 were in AF at birth. Electrical cardioversion was successful in eight of nine patients. No recurrences in AF have occurred beyond the neonatal period. Four patients with fetal flutter and hydrops showed significant neurological pathology immediately after birth.",

Treatment is required and primarily aimed at reaching an adequate ventricular rate and preferably conversion to sinus rhythm. Digoxin failed in prevention of recurrence at time of delivery in a quarter of our patients, whereas with sotalol no recurrence of AF has been reported, suggesting that class III agents may be the future therapy. Once fetuses with AF survive without neurological pathology, their future is good and prophylaxis beyond the neonatal period is unnecessary.", 
    "98": "Cardiac remodeling is generally accepted as a determinant of the clinical course of heart failure (HF). Defined as genome expression resulting in molecular, cellular and interstitial changes and manifested clinically as changes in size, shape and function of the heart resulting from cardiac load or injury, cardiac remodeling is influenced by hemodynamic load, neurohormonal activation and other factors still under investigation. Although patients with major remodeling demonstrate progressive worsening of cardiac function, slowing or reversing remodeling has only recently become a goal of HF therapy. Mechanisms other than remodeling can also influence the course of heart disease, and disease progression may occur in other ways in the absence of cardiac remodeling. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume and ejection fraction data provide support for the beneficial effects of therapeutic agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the remodeling process. These agents also provide benefits in terms of morbidity and mortality. Although measurement of ejection fraction can reliably guide initiation of treatment in HF, opinions differ regarding the value of ejection fraction data in guiding ongoing therapy. The role of echocardiography or radionuclide imaging in the management and monitoring of HF is as yet unclear. To fully appreciate the potential benefits of HF therapies, clinicians should understand the relationship between remodeling and HF progression. Their patients may then, in turn, acquire an improved understanding of their disease and the treatments they are given.",

The study aims to randomise 400 patients who are on optimal treatment. Two parallel groups will be randomised to carvedilol or placebo, namely 200 with hibernating myocardium at baseline and 200 matched patients without. The presence of hibernation is defined from a mismatch between regional contractile function and regional viability, measured by echocardiography (severe segmental asynergy) and nitrate prepared resting Tc99m-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging (segmental activity >60%). The primary treatment-related end-point of the study is the comparison of the mean change, from baseline to the final visit, in radionuclide-determined left ventricular ejection fraction in patients on placebo with those on carvedilol, between the groups designated as hibernating and non-hibernating. Other end-points being examined include the prevalence of hibernation in heart failure, the relationship between the volume of hibernating myocardium and the ejection fraction response, the prevalence of reversible ischemia in heart failure, and the comparison of echo with gated SPECT. To date, 303 patients have been screened and 251 patients randomised in the study. The study aims to report in 2000.",

However, whether beta-blockers reduce severe ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death has not been clarified. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of beta-blockers on non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden cardiac death in patients with DCM. Sixty-five patients with DCM treated with diuretics, digitalis and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were assigned to receive beta-blockers (n = 33) or not (n = 32). Mean follow-up was 53+/-30 months. The echocardiographic indices of cardiac function, the incidence of non-sustained VT on Holter monitoring electrocardiograms, and sudden cardiac death rate were compared between the 2 groups. Comparable improvement in cardiac function on echocardiograms was found in the 2 treatment groups. The patient group treated with beta-blockers showed a significant reduction in the prevalence of VT (from 43 to 15%, p<0.05) and the development of new episodes of VT (5 vs. 16%) compared to the group without beta-blockers. The sudden cardiac death rate did not differ between the 2 groups.

Statistically excellent correlation was found between the percentage of drug absorbed and Cmax, AUC0-24 and AUC0-infinity. A highly significant difference (P < 0.001) was observed when Cmax and AUC0-infinity, generated from plasma and urine were compared, but k(e), t1/2e, k(a) and t1/2a did not differ significantly (P > 0.1).

The rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr, was studied in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes in the presence of thiopentone, which blocks the more slowly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, IKs, and using whole cell perforated patch clamp or switched voltage clamp with sharp electrodes to minimise intracellular dialysis. 2. Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by isoprenaline or forskolin caused an increase in IKr tail currents. Following a 300 ms depolarising step to +20 mV, mean tail current amplitude was increased 47 +/- 12% by isoprenaline, and 73 +/- 13% by forskolin. No increase in IKr was observed when IKr was studied using whole cell ruptured patch clamp and there was no change in the reversal potential of IKr in the presence of isoprenaline. 3. The rectification of the current sensitive to E4031, a selective IKr blocker, was markedly reduced in the presence of isoprenaline and the region of negative slope was absent. This is consistent with a reduction in the inactivation of IKr and was supported by the finding that IKr, in the presence of isoprenaline, was somewhat less sensitive to block. E4031 (5 microM) blocked only 81 +/- 5% of IKr in the presence of isoprenaline compared to 100 +/- 0% in control. 4. The forskolin- and isoprenaline-induced increases in IKr were inhibited by staurosporine and by the selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bisindolymaleimide I. Direct activation of PKC by phorbol dibutyrate increased IKr tail currents by 24 +/- 5%. Both the isoprenaline- and forskolin-induced increases in IKr were inhibited when calcium entry was reduced by block of ICa with nifedipine or when myocytes were pre-incubated in BAPTA-AM. 5. The selective PKA inhibitor KT5720 prevented the isoprenaline-induced increase in IKr only when the increase in ICa was also suppressed. 6. These data show a novel mechanism of regulation of IKr by PKC and this kinase was activated by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. IKr seems to be enhanced through a reduction in the C-type inactivation which underlies the rectification of the channel and such a mechanism may occur in other channels with this type of inactivation.", 
    "124": "It is well known that migraine with aura may coexist with various unilateral headaches, like cluster headache and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. It may also coexist with cervicogenic headache. The diagnosis of migraine without aura (\"common migraine\") poses greater problems than the diagnosis of migraine with aura. Cervicogenic headache diagnosis also poses problems when these two headaches coexist, since they have symptoms in common. Therefore, the scientific demonstration of coexistence of migraine without aura and cervicogenic headache is bound to be a difficult task. In the present study, migraine without aura and cervicogenic headache seemed to coexist in 4 patients (3 F and 1 M, mean age 50).

By employing the chemokine receptor blocker Met-RANTES it was shown that recruitment of inflammatory cells into renal allografts could be significantly suppressed. In a renal transplant model (Fisher RT1(1v1) rat kidney into Lewis RT1(1) rat) Met-RANTES-treated animals showed a significant reduction in vascular injury score (16.10 +/- 5.20 vs. 62.67 +/- 18.64) and tubular damage score (15.70 +/- 5.22 vs. 33.00 +/- 6.44) relative to untreated animals. In a severe rejection model (Brown-Norway RT1n rat kidney into Lewis RT1(1) rat), Met-RANTES significantly augmented low-dose cyclosporin A treatment to reduce all aspects of renal injury including interstitial inflammation (score 71.00 +/- 6.10 vs. 157.30 +/- 21.30). In a monocyte attachment assay on microvascular endothelium under physiological flow conditions exposure of microvascular endothelium to RANTES resulted in RANTES immobilization and RANTES-induced firm adhesion of monocytes only after prestimulation of the endothelium with IL-1 beta. Met-RANTES completely inhibited this RANTES-mediated arrest. Thus, Met-RANTES can reduce acute rejection by impeding leukocyte arrest to inflamed endothelium.",

    "140": "In this report, a series of four experiments was performed to evaluate the relationship between the olfactory bulb norepinephrine system and intra-olfactory bulb infusion of oxytocin in the preservation of social memory responses. The present data indicate that oxytocin exerts this preservation of social recognition through a specific, receptor-mediated mechanism within the olfactory bulb (experiment 1). The involvement of the olfactory bulb norepinephrine system is revealed by the demonstration that retrodialysis of oxytocin into the olfactory bulb increases norepinephrine release (experiment 4). Our data suggest that the increased output of olfactory bulb norepinephrine resulting from oxytocin appears to activate alpha-adrenoceptors to produce this preservation in recognition because infusions of clonidine into the olfactory bulb preserve recognition responses in a manner similar to that observed with oxytocin (experiment 2). In addition, a co-infusion of oxytocin with phentolamine abolishes recognition responses (experiment 3). Accordingly, this model affords the opportunity to study neuropeptide-catecholamine interactions, link these interactions with a specific behavioural outcome and identify a novel function/site of action for oxytocin in the male.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on ion secretion in human intestinal epithelial cells. The conventional microelectrode technique in the cell line HT29cl. 19A was used, which allows for simultaneous measurements of transepithelial potential difference and intracellular potential difference across the apical membrane. Preincubation (2-78 h) with 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha did not change basal secretory activity. However, the secretory response to the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol was strongly increased after exposure to TNF-alpha. Application of the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF 109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I) inhibited the response to carbachol as well as the TNF-alpha-potentiated response, indicating that PKC mediates the effect of carbachol in this cell line. Propranolol, a substance that inhibits the phospholipase D (PLD) pathway, strongly reduced the response to muscarinic stimulation and its potentiation by TNF-alpha. The results indicate that activation of PLD is involved in ion secretion induced by muscarinic receptor activation and that TNF-alpha can potentiate this pathway.",

Application of 50 microM betaxolol reversibly reduced the voltage-gated sodium and calcium currents by approximately one third of their peak amplitudes. The times-to-action of betaxolol on ganglion cells are long (15-35 minutes for 20-50 microM betaxolol), indicative of modulation through slow biochemical cascades. Betaxolol, up to 100 microM, exerted no effects on horizontal cells or the ERG, suggesting that the primary actions of this beta1 blocker are restricted to retinal ganglion cells.",

The beta 1- and beta 3-AR mRNAs and proteins were measured by Northern and saturation analyses, respectively. Glycerol production and adenyl cyclase (AC) activity induced by various non-selective and selective beta 1/beta 3-AR agonists and drugs which act distal to the receptor in the signalling cascade were measured in cells from untreated, triiodothyronine (T3)-treated and thyroidectomized rats. 2. The beta 3-AR density was enhanced (72%) by T3-treatment and reduced (50%) by introduction of a hypothyroid state while beta 1-AR number remained unaffected. The beta 1- and beta 3-AR density was correlated with the specific mRNA level in all thyroid status. 3. The lipolytic responses to isoprenaline, noradrenaline (beta 1/beta 3/beta 3-AR agonists) and BRL 37344 (beta 3-AR agonist) were potentiated by 48, 58 and 48%, respectively in hyperthyroidism and reduced by about 80% in hypothyroidism. 4.

    "162": "An influence of hydroxylation phenotype on the concentration of propranolol [corrected] was examined in 52 subjects with hyperlipidemia divided into 4 groups: 1--control, normolipemic, 2--hypercholesterolemic, 3--hypertriglyceridemic, and 4--mixed-form hyperlipidemic. Each study group included extensive metabolizers and one subject characterized by a poor hydroxylation phenotype. Propranolol was given intragastrically at a single dose of 80 mg [corrected]. Blood was sampled within 24 hours following the drug administration. HPLC method was used for determining blood serum concentrations of propranolol. In each study group mean blood serum concentrations of propranolol in poor metabolizers were at maximum in subject with hypertriglyceridemia, at minimum in the normolipemic one, and intermediate in hypercholesterolemic (upper) and mixed-form hyperlipidemic ones. Lipid metabolic disturbances also affected blood serum concentrations. They were the highest in hypertriglyceridemic patients, whereas in hypercholesterolemic were, in early stage of observation, even lower then in normolipemic subjects. Blood serum concentrations of propranolol [corrected] attained minimal values in patients with mixed form of hyperlipidemia. In the light of the present study we can state that hyperlipidemia modifies the blood serum concentrations of propranolol [corrected]. Although, the type of hyperlipidemia and lipophilic propranolol are not the only determinants affecting blood serum concentrations of propranolol, but also a genetic factor, i.e. hydroxylation phenotype may play an important role.", 
    "163": "Hypertension is currently defined in terms of levels of blood pressure associated with increased cardiovascular risk. A cut-off of 140/90 mm Hg is accepted as a threshold level above which treatment should at least be considered. This would give a prevalence of hypertension of about 20% of the adult population in most developed countries. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and renal impairment. Hypertension results from the complex interaction of genetic factors and environmental influences. Many of the genetic factors remain to be discovered, but environmental influences such as salt intake, diet and alcohol form the basis of nonpharmacological methods of blood pressure reduction. Investigation of the individual hypertensive patient aims to identify possible secondary causes of hypertension and also to assess the individual's overall cardiovascular risk, which determines the need for prompt and aggressive therapy. Cardiovascular risk can be determined from (i) target organ damage to the eyes, heart and kidneys; (ii) other medical conditions associated with increased risk; and (iii) lifestyle factors such as obesity and smoking. Secondary causes of hypertension are individually rare. Screening tests should be initially simple, with more expensive and invasive tests reserved for those in whom a secondary cause is suspected or who have atypical features to their presentation. The main determinants of blood pressure are cardiac output and peripheral resistance. The typical haemodynamic finding in patients with established hypertension is of normal cardiac output and increased peripheral resistance. Treatment of hypertension should initially use nonpharmacological methods. Selection of initial drug therapy should be based upon the strength of evidence for reduction of cardiovascular mortality in controlled clinical trials, and should also take into account coexisting medical conditions that favour or limit the usefulness of any given drug. Given this approach, it would be reasonable to use a thiazide diuretic and/or a beta-blocker as first-line therapy unless there are indications to the contrary. Individual response to given drug classes is highly variable and is related to the underlying variability in the abnormal pathophysiology. There are data to suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is more important in young patients. The targeting of this system in patients under the age of 50 years with a beta-blocker (or ACE inhibitor), and the use of a thiazide diuretic (or calcium antagonist) in patients over 50 years, may enable blood pressure to be controlled more quickly.", 
    "164": "The modulation of antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic properties of antiarrhythmic compounds by increased sympathetic activity is of experimental and clinical interest. However, the interaction of adrenergic stimulation with the rate-response pattern of class III antiarrhythmic agents is not well established. Using standard microelectrode techniques, we evaluated the effects of isoproterenol (iso) on the action of d,l-sotalol (d,l-sot), d-sotalol (d-sot), and dofetilide (dof) on action-potential parameters recorded from isolated canine cardiomyocytes. The cell-isolation procedure was performed from the endocardial layers of left ventricular myocardium from healthy beagle dogs. The following electrophysiologic parameters were recorded: resting membrane potential (RMP), action-potential amplitude (APA), action-potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD 90), and effective refractory period (ERP). After exposure to iso, the class III activity of d,l-sot was well maintained over the entire range of frequencies studied. In contrast, iso differentially antagonized the action of d-sot and dof. In comparison to dof, the class III action of d-sot was particularly sensitive to iso, predominantly at faster stimulation rates. Our observations demonstrate specific rate regulation of the class III action of d,l-sot, d-sot, and dof in response to adrenergic stimulation. The unfavorable rate-response pattern of d-sot compared with d,l-sot and dof might prove disadvantageous in high-catecholamine states.", 
    "165": "Sudden cardiac death is most commonly caused by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Three groups of patients at highest risk for sudden cardiac death are survivors of previous sudden cardiac death, those with recurrent documented episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia and patients with recurrent syncope of unknown origin. The experience with antiarrhythmic drugs has been discouraging. Only beta-blockers have been shown to unequivocally reduce both arrhythmic and total mortality in randomised trials. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs increase mortality, especially in an ischemic substrate. Class III drugs such as sotalol and amiodarone have had variable success. Racemic sotalol has both beta-blocker as well as Class III actions and some of the benefits may be due to the former effect. D-sotalol which has only pure Class III action, increases mortality in the post myocardial infarction patient. Amiodarone is superior to Class I antiarrhythmic drugs for patients with previous cardiac arrest. In the high-risk myocardial infarction patient, it seems to reduce sudden death but not total mortality. In the cardiac failure patient, the effect of amiodarone on total mortality is controversial. Several randomised trials of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy versus drugs have however concluded that the ICD is superior to drugs in reducing total mortality. In comparison with many other high volume therapies used in medicine today, ICD is still a cost-effective therapy.",

Therefore, the objectives of this phase I study were to assess the potential effects of the coadministration of lansoprazole on the pharmacokinetics of propranolol and to evaluate the safety of propranolol with concomitant lansoprazole dosing. In a double-blind fashion, 18 healthy male nonsmokers were initially randomized to receive either 60 mg oral lansoprazole, each morning for 7 days, or an identical placebo (period 1). On day 7, all subjects were concomitantly administered oral propranolol, 80 mg. After a minimum of 1 week following the last dose of either lansoprazole or placebo, subjects were crossed over to the opposite treatment for another 7 days (period 2). Subjects were again administered oral propranolol on day 7. During both treatment periods, blood samples for the determination of plasma propranolol and 4-hydroxy-propranolol were obtained just before the dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours postdose. Plasma propranolol and 4-hydroxy-propranolol concentrations were determined by using HPLC with fluorescence detection. The Cmax, tmax, AUC0-infinity, and t1/2 values for propranolol, as well as the AUC0-infinity for 4-hydroxy-propranolol, were calculated and compared between the lansoprazole and placebo regimens. The mean age of the 15 subjects who successfully completed the study was 31 years (range: 24-38 years), and their average weight was 174.8 pounds (range: 145-203 pounds). There were no statistically significant differences between the lansoprazole and placebo regimens for the propranolol Cmax, tmax, AUC0-infinity, and t1/2 values. Also, there were no statistically significant differences between regimens for the 4-OH-propranolol AUC0-infinity. Safety evaluations, which included adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory determinations, ECG, and physical examinations, revealed no unexpected clinically significant findings and did not suggest a drug-drug interaction. In conclusion, lansoprazole does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of propranolol, suggesting that it does not interact with the CYP2D6- or CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of propranolol. Modification of a propranolol dosage regimen in the presence of lansoprazole is not indicated, based on the pharmacokinetic analysis and the lack of a clinically significant alteration in the pharmacodynamic response.",

After a 3- to 14-day qualification period, all patients received placebo tasosartan on days--1 through 5 and 25 through 34, atenolol alone (50 mg) on days 1 through 5, atenolol (50 mg) + tasosartan (50 mg) on days 6 through 19, and tasosartan (50 mg) alone on days 20 through 24. A PK and PD evaluation of atenolol alone was performed on study day 5. On study day 19, PK and PD of both tasosartan and atenolol were assessed. PK and PD evaluation for tasosartan alone was assessed on study day 24. The coadministration of atenolol + tasosartan did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tasosartan, its major metabolite (enoltasosartan), or atenolol when compared with tasosartan or atenolol administered separately. For area under the change in diastolic blood pressure curve, the reduction was significantly greater after tasosartan + atenolol compared with that after atenolol alone (336 +/- 85 and 190 +/- 71 mmHg.24 h; p < 0.05 for combination and atenolol alone, respectively; mean +/- SEM). Combination therapy also caused a maximal reduction in diastolic blood pressure that is significantly more than with monotherapy with atenolol (-27 +/- 2 mmHg and -20 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively, p < 0.05). The additive effects of tasosartan and atenolol in decreasing diastolic blood pressure may provide a rationale for combination antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "168": "This study was aimed at comparing the blocking of beta-adrenoceptor activity to changes in the resting energy metabolism of 10 cancer patients with progressive weight loss due to solid malignant tumours. Resting energy expenditure (REE) as well as whole body carbohydrate and fat oxidation were investigated and related to plasma substrate levels (glucose, glycerol, free fatty acids (FFA)) before and after 5 days of oral administration of specific beta1 receptor blocker (atenolol, 50 mg/day) and non-specific beta1,beta2-adrenoceptor (propranolol, 80 mg/day) blockade. The administration order of the drugs was random, and a 3-day washout period was used in all individuals between the provision of the first and the second drug in order to minimise the risk of carry-over effects. Resting measurements in the morning after an overnight fast were performed by indirect calorimetry. Atenolol treatment reduced REE by 77+/-14 kcal/day and propranolol by 48+/-13 kcal/day, respectively (P<0.05 versus pretreatment values). Whole body oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production were decreased similarly by both atenolol and propranolol treatment (P<0.05). Carbohydrate oxidation was increased by atenolol and decreased by propranolol, whilst fat oxidation was decreased by atenolol and unchanged by propranolol. The decrease in REE, accounting for the decline in heart rate, was significantly more pronounced following treatment with propranolol compared with atenolol (P<0.05). Atenolol and propranolol had no effect on blood glucose, plasma glycerol and FFA. We conclude that wastage in cancer patients is in part explained by increased beta(1) and beta(2)-adrenoceptor activity, in part secondary to elevated cardiovascular activity as a result of anaemia, loss of cardiac contractile capacity and altered host metabolism.", 
    "169": "Stomach-specific drug delivery systems would be of value in treating diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The present study measured in vitro and in vivo drug release from pH-sensitive membrane bags, constructed of poly(acrylic acid) grafted onto a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PAA-PVDF) membrane, which might be suitable for stomach-specific drug delivery. The used model drugs were propranolol-HCl (1.0 mg) and FITC-dextran MW 4400 (1.0 mg). Drug release in vivo was studied by inserting membrane bags into the stomach and proximal duodenum of anesthetized rats and dogs. At 30 and 180 min, the bags were removed from the lumens and residual drug content was determined. The release of either propranolol or FITC-dextran were comparable in both stomach and duodenum, showing that in vivo drug release did not depend on environmental pH. In vitro results suggested that these results could be explained by interactions between PAA and the mucous layers of the stomach and duodenum.", 
    "170": "Our laboratory previously reported that the end-systolic force-length relationship of the left ventricle provides a better method of evaluating myocardial contractile properties than the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, because it avoids deficiencies of the latter parameter such as dependence of its slope (E(max)) on the volume intercept (V(0)). The slope (E(c)) of the left ventricular end-systolic force-length relationship represents the contractility of functioning myocardium, while its length intercept (L(0)) reflects the length of non-functioning myocardium. However, the effect of regional myocardial ischemia on these parameters, as evaluated by the force-length relationship, remains unknown. To clarify the effects of regional ischemia and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on the myocardium during ischemia-reperfusion, the changes in E(c) and L(0) were determined in anesthetized open-chest dogs. (1) Control group (n=26): Before and after 15 min of complete coronary artery occlusion, as well as after 15 min of reperfusion, left ventricular pressure and volume were simultaneously recorded during inferior vena cava occlusion. The left ventricular force-length relationship was obtained from the pressure and volume of three cylindrical segments of the ventricle, and E(c) and L(0) were calculated. (2) Imidapril group (n=14): Imidaprilat (1 microg/kg/min) was continuously infused from 30 min before ischemia to the end of the experiment, and the same procedures were followed as in the control group. Fourteen out of the 26 dogs (54%) in the control group died of reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias, while only two of the 14 dogs (14%) in the imidapril group did so (P<0.05). In the control group, E(c) was increased during ischemia and remained at the same level after reperfusion. However, E(c) was not altered in the imidapril group. Although L(0) was increased during ischemia and decreased after reperfusion in both groups, the percent increase of L(0) in the imidapril group was significantly smaller than in the control group (8% vs. 32%, P<0.05). With the improvement of these indices, the bradykinin concentration of coronary venous blood increased in the imidapril group (P<0.01). These findings suggest that regional myocardial ischemia increased the average contractility of overall functioning myocardium despite the increased non-functioning myocardium. Moreover, imidapril has a cardioprotective effect against ischemia-reperfusion injury by decreasing infarct size, and through the antiarrhythmic effect and the reversal of increased overall contractility.", 
    "171": "Middle age is associated with changes in circadian rhythms (e.g., alterations in the timing of the circadian wheel running rhythm) which resemble changes induced by selective destruction of the serotonergic input to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the principal mammalian circadian pacemaker. We hypothesized that serotonergic neurotransmission in the SCN is decreased in middle-aged hamsters, as compared to young adults. This hypothesis was tested indirectly by investigating the effect of aging on two markers of serotonin neurotransmission, 5-HT(1B) receptors and serotonin reuptake sites, which are regulated by serotonin. Previous studies have shown that experimentally induced decreases in serotonergic neurotransmission increase 5-HT(1B) receptors but decrease serotonin reuptake sites. Quantitative autoradiography was conducted using [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) and [3H]paroxetine, selective radioligands for the 5-HT(1B) receptors and the serotonin reuptake sites, respectively. Consistent with the hypothesis, specific ([125I]ICYP binding was significantly elevated in the SCN of middle-aged hamsters, as compared to young hamsters. The results also showed that serotonin reuptake sites in the SCN were significantly increased in both middle-aged and old hamsters, as compared to young controls. This result could not have been caused by decreased serotonin release. Alternatively, increased serotonin reuptake, which would reduce serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft, may cause or contribute to the increase in 5-HT(1B) receptor binding in the SCN in middle aged animals. These results show that the SCN exhibits changes in serotonergic function during middle age, which has been characterized by changes in the expression of circadian rhythms. Because these changes occur during middle age, they probably reflect the aging process, rather than senescence or disease.", 
    "172": "A new simple, precise, rapid and selective high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of atenolol (ATL) and amlodipine (AMLO) in tablets, using methylene chloride:methanol:ammonia solution (25% NH3) (8.8:1.3:0.1; v/v) as the mobile phase and Merck HPTLC plates (0.2 mm thickness) precoated with 60F254 silica gel on aluminium sheet as the stationary phase. Detection was carried out densitometrically using a UV detector at 230 nm. The retention factors of ATL and AMLO were 0.33 and 0.75, respectively. Calibration curves were linear in the range 10-500 microg ml(-1) for both. Assays of ATL and AMLO were 49.87 mg per tablet (relative standard deviation (R.S.D.), 1.3%) and 4.90 mg per tablet (R.S.D., 1.38%) for brand I, and 49.27 mg per tablet (R.S.D., 1.12%) and 4.98 mg per tablet (R.S.D., 1.42%) for brand II, respectively. The percentage recoveries for ATL and AMLO for brands I and II were 99.06 and 99.30%, and 99.27 and 99.15%, respectively.", 
    "173": "The S and R isomers of [18F]-fluoropropranolol (1-[1-fluoro-2-isopropylamino]-3-naphthalen-1-yloxy-propan-2 -ol) have been prepared by reductive alkylation of the appropriate aminoalcohols. The radiosynthesis provides a reasonable yield (approximately 25%) to give products of 99% enantiomeric excess and specific activities of 1-3 Ci/micromol. The dissociation constants for the beta2 adrenergic receptor are 0.5 and 2.5 nM for the S and the R isomers, respectively. The biodistribution data in rats show that uptake and egress of the tracer is rapid but that the result of blocking studies and the difference between the R and the S isomers suggest receptor-mediated uptake in receptor-rich tissue."
