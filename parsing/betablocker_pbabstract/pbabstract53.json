Its up-regulation during tumorigenesis makes this receptor an interesting therapeutic target. In the absence of the ligand, the inhibition of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase activity by propranolol treatment leads to internalization of empty/inactive receptors. The molecular events involved in this endocytosis remain unknown. Here, we quantified the effects of propranolol on the mobility of single quantum-dot labelled receptors before the actual internalization took place. The single receptors showed a clear stop-and-go motion; their diffusive tracks were continuously interrupted by sub-second stalling events, presumably caused by transient clustering. In the presence of propranolol we found that: i) the diffusion rate reduced by 22 %, which indicates an increase in drag of the receptor. Atomic force microscopy measurements did not show an increase of the effective membrane tension, such that clustering of the receptor remains the likely mechanism for its reduced mobility. ii) The receptor got frequently stalled for longer periods of multiple seconds, which may signal the first step of the internalization process.",

All were free of atrial fibrillation and of predisposing diseases like heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and hyperthyroidism at baseline and none received any other antihypertensive medication. We studied risk of atrial fibrillation, and used risk of stroke, influenced by lowering blood pressure rather than renin-angiotensin system blockade per se, as an indicator of the importance of blood pressure lowering per se. Hazard ratios of atrial fibrillation for ACEi and ARB monotherapy were 0.12 (95% CI: 0.10-0.15) and 0.10 (0.07-0.14) compared with \u03b2-blocker, 0.51 (0.44-0.59) and 0.43 (0.32-0.58) compared with diuretic, and 0.97 (0.81-1.16) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) compared with calcium-antagonist monotherapy.

When given a small daily dose of 200 mg immediate-release carbamazepine, this patient experienced drowsiness. Subsequently, she reduced her carbamazepine dose to 200 mg twice a week (on Mondays and Fridays), resulting in poor seizure control. At the same time, the patient was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and was given carbimazole and propranolol. Hyperthyroidism and the concurrent use of these antihyperthyroid agents may have further slowed down the metabolism of carbamazepine. Therapeutic drug monitoring of carbamazepine was carried out, and a slow carbamazepine clearance of 1.45 L\u00b7h\u207b\u00b9 per 70 kg was observed. Genotyping of selected genetic variants in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, EPHX1, ABCB1, and ABCC2 revealed that she has CYP3A5*3/*3 and ABCB1 3435-CC genotypes. Both genotypes have been shown to be associated with higher adjusted mean serum carbamazepine concentration in Chinese and Korean patients with epilepsy.

We show that the diabetogenic effects of thiazide diuretics and beta blockers are small relative to the glucose effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and calcium channel blockers, and that over time, the glucose differences between older and newer medications diminish. Importantly, we show that the diabetogenic effects of older antihypertensive medications do not translate into increased cardiovascular disease risk.",

Data were evaluated at 6 months or just before explantation of the LVAD. We defined \"LV reverse remodeling\" (LVRR) by the achievement of an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of \u2265 35 % after 6 months of LVAD support or explantation of LVAD within 6 months. LVRR occurred in 16 of our patients (26.7 %). Uni/multivariate logistic regression analyses for LVRR demonstrated that of the preoperative variables evaluated, PF LVAD usage and insufficient preoperative \u03b2-blocker treatment were independent predictors for LVRR. Patients who accomplished LVRR had a better clinical course, including lower levels of aortic valve insufficiency and lower levels of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide. Of the six patients (10.0 %) in whom LVADs were eventually explanted, all had an LVEF of \u2265 35 % before explantation or at 6 months.

BRL 37344, a selective \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist, induced dose-dependent decreases in left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) in hearts from control rats. BRL 37344 also dose-dependently decreased +dP/dt and -dP/dt values. Effects of BRL 37344 were abolished by SR 59230, but not altered by nadolol pre-treatment. On the other hand, these effects of BRL 37344 were all significantly increased in hearts from diabetic rats. We also observed that diabetes significantly increased the mRNA levels encoding cardiac \u03b23-adrenoceptors. In addition, Gi\u03b12 mRNA expressions were found to be increased in the cardiac tissue of diabetic rats as well. The effect of BRL 37344 on cardiac contractility was normalized upon treatment of diabetic rats with insulin.

This predictive model was validated by calculating the accuracy profile based on the analysis results of validation experiments. Furthermore, based on the data of the accuracy profile, the measurement uncertainty was determined. Finally, the robustness of the model was evaluated. A Raman probe was implemented in the die of a twin-screw extruder, to monitor the drug concentration during extrusion of physical mixtures containing 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35% (w/w) metoprolol tartrate (MPT) in Eudragit(\u00ae) RS PO, an amorphous copolymer of acrylic and methacrylic acid esters with a low content of quaternary ammonium groups, which are present as salts. Several different calibration models for the prediction of the MPT content were developed, based on the use of single spectra or averaged spectra, and using partial least squares (PLS) regression or multivariate curve resolution (MCR). These predictive models were validated by extruding and monitoring mixtures containing 17.5, 22.5, 25.0, 27.5 and 32.5% (w/w) MPT. Each validated concentration was monitored on three different days, by two different operators. The \u03b2-expectation tolerance intervals were calculated for each model and for each of the validated MPT concentration levels (\u03b2 was set at 95%), and acceptance limits were set at 10% (relative bias), indicating that at least 95% of future measurements should not deviate more than 10% from the true value. The only model where these acceptance limits were not exceeded was the MCR model based on averaged Raman spectra. The uncertainty measurements for this model showed that the unknown true value can be found at a maximum of \u00b17.00% around the measured result, with a confidence level of 95%. The robustness of this model was evaluated via an experimental design varying throughput, screw speed and barrel temperature. The robustness designs showed no significant influence of any of the process settings on the predicted concentration values. Raman spectroscopy proved to be a fast, non-destructive and reliable method for the quantification of MPT during hot-melt extrusion. From the accuracy profile of the MCR model based on averaged spectra, it was concluded that for each MPT concentration in the validated concentration range, 95 out 100 future routine measurements will be included within the acceptance limits (10%).", 
    "69": "Opioids represent effective drugs for the relief of pain, yet chronic opioid use often leads to a state of increased sensitivity to pain that is exacerbated during withdrawal. A sensitization of pain-related negative affect has been hypothesized to closely interact with addiction mechanisms. Neuro-adaptive changes occur as a consequence of excessive opioid exposure, including a recruitment of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and norepinephrine (NE) brain stress systems. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the transition to dependence, we determined the effects of functional antagonism within these two systems on hyperalgesia-like behavior during heroin withdrawal utilizing models of both acute and chronic dependence. We found that passive or self-administered heroin produced a significant mechanical hypersensitivity. During acute opioid dependence, systemic administration of the CRF1 receptor antagonist MPZP (20\u2009mg/kg) alleviated withdrawal-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. In contrast, several functional adrenergic system antagonists (clonidine, prazosin, propranolol) failed to alter mechanical hypersensitivity in this state. We then determined the effects of chronic MPZP or clonidine treatment on extended access heroin self-administration and found that MPZP, but not clonidine, attenuated escalation of heroin intake, whereas both drugs alleviated chronic dependence-associated hyperalgesia. These findings suggest that an early potentiation of CRF signaling occurs following opioid exposure that begins to drive both opioid-induced hyperalgesia and eventually intake escalation.",

In a multivariate analysis metformin was a negative predictor of increased NT-proBNP concentration.

Moreover, high resting heart rate (HR) has emerged as a simple but relevant risk factor for cardiovascular events, including coronary artery disease and HF; also, it was found to have an independent prognostic value in patients with HF. Evidence that HR could be considered a good parameter to evaluate the quality of treatment in patients with HF has been suggested; of note, many patients maintain a resting HR \u226570 beats per minute despite optimal beta-blocker therapy. In recent years, a new drug able to reduce HR, ivabradine, has been introduced in clinical practice, and its use in the clinical setting of HF patients has been recommended by current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. Here we review the evidence of the prognostic role of HR in systolic HF and the potential relationship between HR lowering and the beneficial effects of beta-blockers; we will also analyze the reasons why an appropriate use of these drugs is seldom achieved in clinical practice, and review the evidence for the use of ivabradine in systolic HF in the clinical setting.",

    "83": "Most studies of an association of visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure with increased risk of future adverse cardiovascular events are of short duration and rarely include a placebo group. Using data from the double-blind, placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, the authors examined mortality from cardiovascular causes up to 17 years of follow-up using the National Death Index. Visit-to-visit blood pressure variability was associated with cardiovascular death after adjustment for sex, age, serum creatinine, diabetes, body mass index, smoking status, left ventricular failure, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The relationship was significantly stronger in the active treatment group compared with the placebo group. Although this could be the result of an effect of the medications used unrelated to visit-to-visit variability, the data are compatible with the hypothesis that inconsistent adherence leading to missing active medication doses may be an additional explanation for the relationship of visit-to-visit variability with cardiovascular death.", 
    "84": "Oscillatory electrical activity is regarded as a hallmark of the pancreatic beta cell glucose-dependent excitability pattern. Electrophysiologically recorded membrane potential oscillations in beta cells are associated with in-phase oscillatory cytosolic calcium activity ([Ca(2+)]i) measured with fluorescent probes. Recent high spatial and temporal resolution confocal imaging revealed that glucose stimulation of beta cells in intact islets within acute tissue slices produces a [Ca(2+)]i change with initial transient phase followed by a plateau phase with highly synchronized [Ca(2+)]i oscillations. Here, we aimed to correlate the plateau [Ca(2+)]i oscillations with the oscillations of membrane potential using patch-clamp and for the first time high resolution voltage-sensitive dye based confocal imaging. Our results demonstrated that the glucose-evoked membrane potential oscillations spread over the islet in a wave-like manner, their durations and wave velocities being comparable to the ones for [Ca(2+)]i oscillations and waves. High temporal resolution simultaneous records of membrane potential and [Ca(2+)]i confirmed tight but nevertheless limited coupling of the two processes, with membrane depolarization preceding the [Ca(2+)]i increase. The potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium increased the velocity at which oscillations advanced over the islet by several-fold while, at the same time, emphasized differences in kinetics of the membrane potential and the [Ca(2+)]i. The combination of both imaging techniques provides a powerful tool that will help us attain deeper knowledge of the beta cell network.", 
    "85": "Human autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) produces kidneys which are massively enlarged due to multiple cysts, hypertension, and congenital hepatic fibrosis characterized by dilated bile ducts and portal hypertension. The PCK rat is an orthologous model of human ARPKD with numerous fluid-filled cysts caused by stimulated cellular proliferation in the renal tubules and hepatic bile duct epithelia, with interstitial fibrosis developed in the liver. We previously reported that a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3 full agonist ameliorated kidney and liver disease in PCK rats. Telmisartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) used widely as an antihypertensive drug and shows partial PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activity. It also has nephroprotective activity in diabetes and renal injury and prevents the effects of drug-induced hepatotoxicity and hepatic fibrosis. In the present study, we determined whether telmisartan ameliorates progression of polycystic kidney and fibrocystic liver disease in PCK rats. Five male and 5 female PCK and normal control (+/+) rats were orally administered 3 mg/kg telmisartan or vehicle every day from 4 to 20 weeks of age. Treatment with telmisartan decreased blood pressure in both PCK and +/+ rats. Blood levels of aspartate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase and urea nitrogen were unaffected by telmisartan treatment. There was no effect on kidney disease progression, but liver weight relative to body weight, liver cystic area, hepatic fibrosis index, expression levels of Ki67 and TGF-\u03b2, and the number of Ki67- and TGF-\u03b2-positive interstitial cells in the liver were significantly decreased in telmisartan-treated PCK rats. Therefore, telmisartan ameliorates congenital hepatic fibrosis in ARPKD, possibly through the inhibition of signaling cascades responsible for cellular proliferation and interstitial fibrosis in PCK rats. The present results support the potential therapeutic use of ARBs for the treatment of fibrocystic liver disease in ARPKD patients.", 
    "86": "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pharmacogenomics is the study of genetic determinants of interindividual variation in drug response and aims to facilitate personalized medicine, through genotype-informed drug and dose selection, to maximize drug efficacy and/or minimize adverse drug reactions. Despite high expectations, no cardiovascular pharmacogenomic association is currently in widespread clinical practice; evidential, logistical, financial, and knowledge implementation barriers exist. Nevertheless, VKORC1, CYP2C9, and CYP4F2 variants have been associated with warfarin dose requirements, and CYP2C19 variants have been associated with perturbed antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. However, at present, controversy exists over the clinical utility of these genetic associations. There is an increased risk of simvastatin-induced muscle toxicity in SLCO1B1*5 carriers, ADRB1 and ADRA2C polymorphisms are associated with differential response to bucindolol, and rare congenital arrhythmia gene variants have been identified in drug-induced torsade de pointes.

A commercially available data capture and analysis system was used in anaesthetised healthy cats to measure HR and HRV during pharmacological manipulation of HR. Seven healthy cats were subjected to a randomised crossover study design with a 7 day washout period between two treatment groups, placebo and atenolol (1mg/kg, IV), with the efficacy of atenolol to inhibit \u03b21 adrenoreceptors challenged by epinephrine. Statistical significance for the epinephrine challenge was set at P<0.0027 (Holm-Bonferroni correction), whereas a level of significance of P<0.05 was set for other variables. Analysis of the continuous electrocardiography (ECG) recordings showed that epinephrine challenge increased HR in the placebo group (P=0.0003) but not in the atenolol group. The change in HR was greater in the placebo group than in the atenolol group (P=0.0004). Therefore, compared to cats pre-treated with placebo, pre-treatment with atenolol significantly antagonised the tachycardia while not significantly affecting HRV. The increased HR in the placebo group following epinephrine challenge was consistent with a shift of the sympathovagal balance towards a predominantly sympathetic tone. However, the small (but not significant at the critical value) decrease in the normalised high-frequency component (HFnorm) in both groups of cats suggested that epinephrine induced a parasympathetic withdrawal in addition to sympathetic enhancement (increased normalised low frequency component or LFnorm). In conclusion, this model is a highly sensitive and repeatable model to investigate HRV in anaesthetised cats that would be useful in the laboratory setting for short-term investigation of cardiovascular disease and subtle responses to pharmacological agents in this species.",

    "100": "Changes in fatty acid composition of lipids are an important factor in the development of arterial hypertension. Therefore, this is very important to research the role of fatty acid spectrum of the blood and tissues in the development of hypertension. The search for effective metabolic drugs and antihypertensive drugs which would have the additional ability to influence the fatty acid composition of lipids in cells is also important today. We have found that hypertensive rats demonstrate the essential decrease of the amount of saturated fatty acids (sFA) and high content of unsaturated fatty acids (usFA). Application of amlodipine increases the level of sFA compared with animals without treatment and the level of usFA tends to decrease. A similar pattern is observed when using bisoprolol and combination of amlodipine with bisoprolol, although the combination is characterized by more significant changes in FA composition of lipids in cardiomyocytes. Treatment with metabolic drug elgacin leads to full recovery of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the cardiomyocytes. During the treatment with combinations of amlodipine with elgacin and bisoprolol with elgacin the level of both types of AF was not significantly different from the elgacin action in monotherapy. This study demonstrates the modification of the FA composition of lipids in cardiomyocytes of the spontaneously hypertensive rats.

Nonselective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists increased the index of plasma atherogenicity, which did not depend on the severity of a pathological process. In mild chronic heart failure, these changes were associated with a decrease in HDL concentration, while in severe chronic heart failure; they were related to a tendency towards a decrease in HDL content and an increase in LDL concentration. The increase in survival rate was associated with true antagonism of the agent to \u03b2-adrenoceptors (the absence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) and, to a lesser extent, with nonselective blockade of \u03b2-adrenoceptors.",

Studies on analgesic activities was carried out using hotplate and formalin-induced paw licking models while the anti-inflammatory activity was by the carrageenan paw oedema method. Animals were distributed into six groups consisting of five animals each. They were administered saline, honey (600 mg/kg), indomethacin (5 mg/kg), autonomic blockers (3 \u03bcg/kg of tamsulosin, 20 mg/kg (intraperitoneally) of propranolol, 2 ml/kg of atropine or 10 mg/kg (intra muscularly) of hexamethonium) or honey (200 and 600 mg/kg) with one of the blockers. The results showed that honey reduced pain perception especially inflammatory pain and the administration of tamsulosin and propranolol spared the effect of honey. Hexamethonium also spared the effects of honey at the early and late phases of the test while atropine only inhibited the early phase of the test. However, atropine and hexamethonium spared the anti-inflammatory effects of honey but tamsulosin abolished the effects while propranolol only abolished the anti-inflammatory effects at the peak of the inflammation. The results suggest the involvement of autonomic receptors in the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of honey although the level of involvement depends on the different types of the receptors.", 
    "103": "A low rate of mitochondrial ROS production (mitROSp) and a low degree of fatty acid unsaturation are characteristic traits of long-lived animals and can be obtained in a single species by methionine restriction (MetR) or atenolol (AT) treatments. However, simultaneous application of both treatments has never been performed. In the present investigation it is shown that MetR lowers mitROSp and complex I content. Both the MetR and the AT treatments lower protein oxidative modification and oxidative damage to mtDNA and the fatty acid unsaturation degree in rat heart mitochondria. The decrease in fatty acid unsaturation seems to be due, at least in part, to decreases in desaturase and elongase activities or peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was stimulated by MetR and AT. The decrease in membrane fatty acid unsaturation and protein oxidation, and the changes in fatty acids and p-ERK showed additive effects of both treatments. In addition, the increase in mitROSp induced by AT observed in the present investigation was totally avoided with the combined MetR + AT treatment. It is concluded that the simultaneous treatment with MetR plus atenolol is more beneficial than either single treatment alone to lower oxidative stress in rat heart mitochondria, analogously to what has been reported in long-lived animal species.",

    "112": "Achillea millefolium L. is cultivated in Iran and widely used in traditional medicine for gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of hydroalcoholic extract of A. millefolium on the contraction and relaxation of isolated ileum in rat. In this experimental study, aerial parts of A. millefolium were extracted by maceration in ethanol 70% for 72 h. Terminal portion of ileum in 100 male Wistar rats was dissected and its contractions were recorded isotonically in an organ bath containing Tyrode solution (37 \u00b0C, pH 7.4) under one gram tension. Acetylcholine (1mM) and KCl (60mM) were used to create isotonic contractions. Propranolol and N\u03c9-Nitro-L-arginine methylester hydrochloride (L-NAME) were used to investigate the mechanisms of action prior to giving the extract to the relevant groups. Data were compared by ANOVA and Turkey's post hoc test.. The results showed that the ileum contraction was induced by KCl and acetylcholine induced contraction was significantly reduced by A. millefolium extract. The cumulative concentrations of A. millefolium relaxed the KCl and acetylcholine induced contractions (n=14, p<0.001). The inhibitory effect of extract on contraction induced by KCl and acetylcholine was not significantly affected neither by propranolol (1\u00b5M) nor by L-NAME (100 \u00b5M). There was no significant difference in the rate of relaxation by propranolol and L-NAME between the two groups. In conclusion, A. millefolium can inhibit contraction of smooth muscle of ileum in rat, and it can be used for eliminating intestinal spasms. These results suggest that the relaxatory effect of A. millefolium on ileum contractions can be due to the blockade of voltage dependent calcium channels. In addition, the \u03b2-adrenoceptors, cholinergic receptors and nitric oxide production are not powerful actors in inhibitory effect of A. millefolium. So, the nitric oxide and adrenergic systems may also be involved in the antispasmodic effect of A. millefolium.",

    "118": "The role of thyroid hormones (TH) in the normal functioning of adult mammalian brain is unclear. Our studies have identified synaptosomal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase as a TH-responsive physiological parameter in adult rat cerebral cortex. L-triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) both inhibited Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity (but not Mg(2+)-ATPase activity) in similar dose-dependent fashions, while other metabolites of TH were less effective. Although both T3 and the \u03b2 -adrenergic agonist isoproterenol inhibited Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in cerebrocortical synaptosomes in similar ways, the \u03b2 -adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol did not counteract the effect of T3. Instead, propranolol further inhibited Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the effect of T3 on synaptosomal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was independent of \u03b2 -adrenergic receptor activation. The effect of T3 on synaptosomal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was inhibited by the \u03b12-adrenergic agonist clonidine and by glutamate. Notably, both clonidine and glutamate activate Gi-proteins of the membrane second messenger system, suggesting a potential mechanism for the inhibition of the effects of TH. In this paper, we provide support for a nongenomic mechanism of action of TH in a neuronal membrane-related energy-linked process for signal transduction in the adult condition.",

Overall the quality of the available evidence was unclear, primarily as a result of a lack of detail in the study reports on the randomisation and blinding procedures and incomplete outcome data. Two studies compared angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors against placebo. In one study there was a significant reduction in the number of cardiovascular events in patients receiving ramipril (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.91; n = 1725). In the second trial using perindopril (n = 52) there was a marginal increase in claudication distance but no change in ABI and a reduction in maximum walking distance. A trial comparing the calcium antagonist verapamil versus placebo in patients undergoing angioplasty (n = 96) suggested that verapamil reduced restenosis (per cent diameter stenosis (\u00b1 SD) 48.0% \u00b1 11.5 versus 69.6% \u00b1 12.2; P < 0.01), although this was not reflected in the maintenance of a high ABI (0.76 \u00b1 0.10 versus 0.72 \u00b1 0.08 for verapamil versus placebo).

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) utilise the reaction of a highly oxidising species (hydroxyl radicals, (\u2022)OH) for the mineralisation of emerging pollutants since conventional treatment methodologies generally fail to degrade these compounds. In the present work, degradation of atenolol was carried out using ultrasound with frequencies ranging from 200 kHz to 1 MHz as a source of hydroxyl radical. The degradation was monitored by HPLC, total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction and ion chromatography (IC). Nearly 90 % of degradation of atenolol was observed with ultrasound having 350 kHz. Both frequency and power of ultrasound affect the efficiency of degradation. Nearly 100 % degradation was obtained at a pH of 4. Presence of various additives such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, chloride, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate and bicarbonate was found to reduce the efficiency of degradation. Although nearly 100 % degradation of atenolol was observed under various experimental conditions, only about 62 % mineralisation (from TOC and COD measurements) was obtained. Nearly eight intermediate products were identified using high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF). These products were understood as the results of hydroxyl radical addition to atenolol. The degradation studies were also carried out in river water which also showed a similar degradation profile. A mechanism of degradation and mineralisation is presented.", 
    "127": "Infantile hemangiomas (IH) are the most common tumors occurring in early childhood, with a prevalence of approximately 5-10% of infants. While the natural history of IH is to spontaneously involute, a significant minority of IH require therapy with the aim to prevent disfigurement, functional impairment, or ulceration. In 2008, propranolol, a non-selective beta (\u03b2)-blocker, was reported to be highly effective in treating IH. Since that time there have been more than 200 articles published regarding the efficacy and potential toxicity of \u03b2-blockers, both systemic and topical, for the treatment of IH. Based on these finding, \u03b2-blockers appear to be highly effective in treating IH and are well tolerated, though side effects have been reported. When therapy is appropriately monitored, \u03b2-blockers have been proven to be a safer and superior alternative to systemic steroids.", 
    "128": "Previous work examining animal models of cognitive flexibility have focused on tasks where animals are required to shift between cues in order to reach a food reward from among a limited set of choices. Performance by nonhuman animals on these tasks, including reversal learning, intradimensional set-shifting, and extradimensional set-shifting, are affected by pharmacological action on serotonergic, dopaminergic, and alpha-adrenergic, but not beta-adrenergic receptors. However, beta-adrenergic antagonists, such as propranolol, are widely utilized for conditions such as test anxiety. Propranolol improves performance in humans during cognitive flexibility tasks where there is a broad set of potential solutions. The current investigation utilized a digging task where the rodent must develop a novel solution in order to obtain a reward. Similar to the effects observed in humans, propranolol improved performance on this task, while not affecting performance on set-shifting tasks, as with previous animal studies. This may allow future investigation of the neurobiological mechanism by which propranolol affects context-specific anxiety, and could provide insight into the neurobiology of creativity.",

The decision to treat should be based on careful consideration of risk and benefits, yet, when therapy is deemed necessary, it should be administered promptly and with confidence. Drug therapy should be avoided during the first trimester if possible and drugs with the longest record of safety are preferred.

    "132": "A new oral sustained drug delivery system (DDS) involving a combination of inorganic mesoporous material (CMK-5) and organic polymer poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium (PDDA) was established to determine its general suitability for use with poorly water soluble drugs. Nimodipine, carvedilol and fenofibrate, three different drugs with acidic or alkaline properties, were selected as model drugs and loaded into carriers. The physicochemical properties of the drug carriers were systematically studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption. The structural body changes of the composites in release medium, with or without additional salts, were also studied using particle sizing systems, nitrogen adsorption and zeta potential measurement in order to investigate the sustained release mechanism of the drugs. The results obtained showed that sustained release of drug from the designed DDS was mainly due to the blockage effect arising from the strong swelling of the coated polymers when in contact with release medium. Additional salts, when they reached a certain level, allowed a dramatic burst release. We believe that our designed sustained DDS provide a new option for water insoluble drugs and can be considered as fundamental for those more sophisticated DDS increasingly required in modern medical treatments.", 
    "133": "Although fluoride is known to stimulate bone formation, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent studies have implicated the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway as a major signaling cascade in bone biology. Our earlier studies highlighted a probable role of canonical Wnt pathway in bone formation of chronic fluoride-exposed rats, but the mechanism remains unclear. The current study determined the involvement of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in fluoride-induced osteoblastic differentiation. Using primary rat osteoblasts, we demonstrated that fluoride significantly promoted osteoblasts proliferation and alkaline phosphate (ALP) expression as well as the mRNA expression levels of bone differentiation markers, including type I collagen (COL1A1), ALP and osteonectin. We further found fluoride induced phosphorylations at serine 473 of Akt and serine 9 of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), which resulted in GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition and subsequently the nuclear accumulation of the \u03b2-catenin, as shown by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. Moreover, fluoride also induced the expression of Wnt-targeted gene runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). Importantly, the positive effect of fluoride on ALP activity and mRNA expressions of COL1A1, ALP, osteonection and Runx2 was abolished by DKK-1, a blocker of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin receptor. Taken together, these findings suggest that fluoride promotes osteoblastic differentiation through Akt- and GSK-3\u03b2-dependent activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in primary rat osteoblasts. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of action of fluoride in osteoblastogenesis.",

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare condition. In the absence of CAD, it is seen most frequently in young females during the peripartum period. Insult from the hemodynamic stresses during pregnancy and labor combined with the underlying pregnancy related arterial wall changes is the proposed mechanism of dissection in this setting.

    "156": "The use of \u03b2-blockers (BB) in heart failure (HF) has been considered a contradiction for many years. Considering HF simply as a state of inadequate systolic function, BB were contraindicated because of their negative effects on myocardial contractility. Nevertheless, evidence collected in the past years have suggested that additional mechanisms, such as compensatory neuro-humoral hyperactivation or inflammation, could participate in the pathogenesis of this complex disease. Indeed, chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system, although initially compensating the reduced cardiac output from the failing heart, increases myocardial oxygen demand, ischemia and oxidative stress; moreover, high catecholamine levels induce peripheral vasoconstriction and increase both cardiac pre- and after-load, thus determining additional stress to the cardiac muscle (1). As a consequence of such a different view of the pathogenic mechanisms of HF, the efficacy of BB in the treatment of HF has been investigated in numerous clinical trials. Results from these trials highlighted BB as valid therapeutic tools in HF, providing rational basis for their inclusion in many HF treatment guidelines. However, controversy still exists about their use, in particular with regards to the selection of specific molecules, since BB differ in terms of adrenergic \u03b2-receptors selectivity, adjunctive effects on \u03b1-receptors, and effects on reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines production. Further concerns about the heterogeneity in the response to BB, as well as the use in specific patients, are matter of debate among clinicians. In this review, we will recapitulate the pharmacological properties and the classification of BB, and the alteration of the adrenergic system occurring during HF that provide a rationale for their use; we will also focus on the possible molecular mechanisms, such as genetic polymorphisms, underlying the different efficacy of molecules belonging to this class.",

Therefore, numerous studies have focused on the mechanisms that damage neuronal cells and on the drugs that possess protective effects in reversing this damage. However, injury to the retinal vasculature has been recently shown in animal models of glaucoma. Hence, thus far, only few papers have been published on retinal circulation in glaucoma. These study results have indicated that retinal circulation is altered in glaucoma and that this vascular abnormality may be the cause of and/or may accelerate retinal degeneration. In this report, we have attempted to elucidate the mechanisms of retinal circulation and explore novel drugs for the treatment of retinal circulation disorders. We have also introduced here our previous research results on retinal circulation. We reported that the drugs that improved retinal circulation, by intravitreal injection, in the rat model of glaucoma also inhibited retinal nerve injury, thereby representing possibilities that they might be novel candidate drugs for glaucoma prevention and treatment.",

In this study, we aimed to clarify the duration of OATP inhibition by grapefruit juice (GFJ), and to compare it with the duration of GFJ-induced inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 activity. Seven healthy volunteers were enrolled in this open-label, single-sequence study. They were orally administered celiprolol (100\u2009mg) and midazolam (15\u2009\u00b5g/kg) with water on the control day. Three days later, they ingested GFJ (200\u2009mL) 3 times a day for 3\u2009d. On day 1, the same drugs were administered with GFJ. On days 3 and 7, the same drugs were administered with water. Pharmacokinetics of both drugs were evaluated on each trial day. The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 8\u2009h (AUC0-8) of celiprolol significantly decreased on day 1, and the mean ratios of these values and the corresponding control-day values were 0.18 and 0.25, respectively. The Cmax and AUC0-8 returned to the control levels on days 3 and 7. In contrast, AUC0-8 of midazolam were higher on days 1 and 3 than on the control day (mean ratio, 2.12 and 1.47, respectively). The AUC0-8 returned to the control level on day 7. In conclusion, results of this study indicated that the OATP inhibition caused by GFJ dissipated faster than GFJ-mediated alterations in CYP3A4 activity, which were sustained for at least 48\u2009h.", 
    "159": "A simple, precise, economic and minimally operator-dependent method was developed under green analytical chemistry principles, for the simultaneous construction of the dissolution curves of a pharmaceutical association in short time and without employing organic solvents, allowing important savings of labor and resources. The carvedilol (CAR) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) combined formulation was employed as a model. The method (OD/UV-MCR) involves on-line sample dilution (OD) and UV detection of the analytes, coupled to multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares (MCR-ALS). OD/UV-MCR proved to be robust and was successfully validated in accordance to ICH guidelines, fulfilling acceptance criteria for specificity (r(2) of spectral correlation>0.950), linearity [r>0.999 (N=25) in the ranges 1.00-31.1mg l(-1) and 0.51-15.2mg l(-1) for CAR and HCT, respectively] and precision (RSD<2%). Accuracy was assessed by point-to-point comparison between the dissolution profiles furnished by the proposed method with those provided by HPLC analysis, evidencing the usefulness of this monitoring system. In addition, OD/UV-MCR was successfully employed for the comparative analysis of three lots of commercial formulations of the CAR-HCT pharmaceutical association, belonging to a couple of different brands, employing Moore and Flanner's f2 similarity indicator.", 
    "160": "Recent studies on the effect of stress on modulation of fear memory in our laboratory have uncovered endogenous opioid and adrenergic based modulation systems, working in concert, that limit the strengthening or weakening of newly acquired fear memory during consolidation under conditions of mild or intense stress, respectively. The present study sought to determine if similar stress-dependent modulation, mediated by endogenous opioid and adrenergic systems, occurs during reconsolidation of newly retrieved fear memory. Rats underwent contextual fear conditioning followed 24h later by reactivation of fear memory; a retention test was administered the next day. Stress was manipulated by varying duration of recall of fear memory during reactivation. In the first experiment, vehicle or the opioid-receptor blocker naloxone was administered immediately after varied durations (30 or 120 s) of reactivation. The results indicate that (1) reactivation, in the absence of drug, has a marked effect on freezing behavior-as duration of reactivation increases from 30 to 120 s, freezing behavior and presumably fear-induced stress increases and (2) naloxone, administered immediately after 30 s (mild stress) or 120 s (intense stress) of reactivation, enhances or impairs retention, respectively, the next day. In the second experiment, naloxone and the \u00df-adrenergic blocker propranolol were administered either separately or in combination immediately after 120 s (intense stress) reactivation. The results indicate that separate administration of propranolol and naloxone impairs retention, while the combined administration fails to do so. Taken together the results of the two experiments are consistent with a protective mechanism, mediated by endogenous opioid and adrenergic systems working in concert, that limits enhancement and impairment of newly retrieved fear memory during reactivation in a stress-dependent manner.",

Adverse effects were minor in most patients. Three patients discontinued propranolol because of vomiting, wheeze, and hypoglycaemia, respectively. Our duration of treatment was longer than that of other series, and may be due to our group having higher rates of hypotension, recorded in 27.3% of patients, precluding an increase in propranolol dose.

In the liver, C. aurantium (bitter orange) extracts affect hemodynamics, carbohydrate metabolism, and oxygen uptake. The purpose of the present work was to quantify the action of p-synephrine and also to obtain indications about its mechanism of action, a task that would be difficult to accomplish with C. aurantium extracts due to their rather complex composition. The experimental system was the isolated perfused rat liver. p-Synephrine significantly stimulated glycogenolysis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and oxygen uptake. The compound also increased the portal perfusion pressure and the redox state of the cytosolic NAD(+)/NADH couple. A Ca(2+)-dependency for both the hemodynamic and the metabolic effects of p-synephrine was found. p-Synephrine stimulated both cAMP overflow and the initial Ca(2+) release from the cellular stores previously labeled with (45)Ca(2+). The metabolic and hemodynamic actions of p-synephrine were strongly inhibited by \u03b1-adrenergic antagonists and moderately affected by \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists. The results allow to conclude that p-synephrine presents important metabolic and hemodynamic effects in the liver. These effects can be considered as both catabolic (glycogenolysis) and anabolic (gluconeogenesis), they are mediated by both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, require the simultaneous participation of both Ca(2+) and cAMP, and could be contributing to the overall stimulation of metabolism that usually occurs during weight loss periods.",

This study assesses the impact of RAS- and \u03b2-blocker uptitrations in patients with HFrEF versus HFpEF during and immediately after a hospital admission. In consecutive patients (209 HFrEF with left ventricular ejection fraction <40% and 108 HFpEF with left ventricular ejection fraction \u226540%), RAS- and \u03b2-blocker dose changes were followed during 6\u00a0months after an index HF hospitalization. Patients with a RAS- and \u03b2-blocker dose increase of \u226510% of the recommended target dose were compared with patients without uptitration. Patients who received uptitration were significantly younger, with a higher heart rate and better renal function, and received spironolactone more often. Both RAS- and \u03b2-blocker uptitrations were associated with significant reductions in the composite end-point of all-cause mortality or HF readmissions in HFrEF (hazard ratio [HR] 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22 to 0.60 and HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.81, respectively). After correction for age, heart rate, blood pressure, renal function, and spironolactone use, this association remained significant for RAS blockers (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93, p\u00a0= 0.027) but not for \u03b2-blockers (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.09, p\u00a0= 0.101). No benefit of RAS- or \u03b2-blocker uptitration was observed in HFpEF.
