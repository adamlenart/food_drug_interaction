    "0": "Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common valvular disorder that has important health and economic consequences. Standardized guidelines exist regarding when and in whom to perform mitral valve surgery, but little information is available regarding medical treatment of MR. Many patients with moderate or severe MR do not meet criteria for surgery or are deemed to be at high risk for surgical therapy. We reviewed the available published data on medical therapy in the treatment of patients with primary MR. b-blockers and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors had the strongest supporting evidence for providing beneficial effects. b-blockers appear to lessen MR, prevent deterioration of left ventricular function, and improve survival in asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe primary MR. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker therapy reduces MR, especially in asymptomatic patients. However, in the setting of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or mitral valve prolapse, vasodilators can increase the severity of MR. To define the precise role of medical therapy, a larger randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm benefit and assess in which subsets of patients medical therapy is most useful. Medical therapy in some patients improves symptoms, lessens MR, and may delay the need for surgical intervention.",

Objective was to elucidate the role of NE in fibrosis in SSc. IL-6 is a potent stimulator of collagen production in fibroblasts. NE enhanced IL-6 production and proliferation more significantly in SSc fibroblasts than in normal fibroblasts. Furthermore, the production of IL-6 and phosphorylation of p38 in SSc fibroblasts was enhanced by adrenergic receptor (AR)\u03b2 agonist, isoproterenol, but not AR\u03b1 agonist, oxymetazoline. AR\u03b2 blocker, propranolol, inhibited NE-induced IL-6 production and phosphorylation of p38 in SSc fibroblasts. NE-induced IL-6 was significantly inhibited by p38 inhibitor, SB203580, suggesting that NE-induced phosphorylation of p38 via AR\u03b2 enhances IL-6 production in SSc fibroblasts. NE-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 via AR\u03b1 inhibited IL-6 production in SSc fibroblasts. Combined treatment with NE and endothelin-1 resulted in an additive increase in IL-6 production in SSc fibroblasts. NE-induced IL-6/IL-6 receptor trans-signaling increased the production of collagen type I in SSc fibroblasts, and both propranolol and SB203580 inhibited NE-induced collagen production. These results suggest that cold exposure and/or emotional stress-induced NE might contribute to the skin fibrosis via potentiation of IL-6 production from fibroblasts in SSc.",

JNJ303 prolonged cFPD in a dose-dependent fashion by 22\u00a0% and 7-13\u00a0% in WT- and LQT-CMs, respectively. At baseline, all CMs showed fractal correlations as determined by short-term scaling exponent \u03b1. However, in all CMs, the \u03b1 was increased when pharmacological compounds were applied indicating of breakdown of fractal complexity. These findings suggest that the intrinsic mechanisms contributing to the fractal complexity are not altered in LQT-CMs. The modulation of IKs channel and \u03b21-adrenoreceptors by pharmacological compounds may affect the fractal complexity of the hiPSC-CMs.",

    "55": "Background: Hypertension is a common complication in patients with gout and/or hyperuricemia. Besides, hyperuricemia is a risk factor of gout as well as ischemic heart disease in hypertensive patients. Moreover, the risk of gout is modified by antihypertensive drugs. However, it remains unclear how antihypertensive agents affect uric acid metabolism. Purpose: In the present study, we investigated the uric acid metabolism in treated hypertensive patients to find out whether any of them would influence serum levels of uric acid. Patients and methods: 751 hypertensive patients (313 men and 438 women) under antihypertensive treatment were selected. Blood pressure (BP), serum uric acid (SUA) and serum creatinine (Scr) were measured and evaluated statistically. Results: In patients treated with diuretics, beta-blockers and/or alpha-1 blockers SUA levels were significantly higher than in patients who were not taking these drugs. Besides, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients treated with diuretics, beta-blockers and/or alpha-1 blockers was negatively correlated with SUA level. There were gender differences in the effects of beta-blockers and alpha-1 blockers. Multiple regression analysis indicated that both diuretics and beta-blockers significantly contributed to hyperuricemia in patients with medication for hypertension. Conclusion: Diuretics, beta-blockers and alpha-1 blockers reduced glomerular filtration rate and raised SUA levels. Calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, including losartan, did not increase SUA levels.",

    "57": "Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that adversely affects cardiac function and increases the risk of stroke. It is the most common arrhythmia and a major source of morbidity and mortality; its prevalence increases with age. Pulse rate is sensitive, but not specific, for diagnosis, and suspected atrial fibrillation should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography. Because normal electrocardiographic findings do not rule out atrial fibrillation, home monitoring is recommended if there is clinical suspicion of arrhythmia despite normal test results. Treatment is based on decisions made regarding when to convert to normal sinus rhythm vs. when to treat with rate control, and, in either case, how to best reduce the risk of stroke. For most patients, rate control is preferred to rhythm control. Ablation therapy is used to destroy abnormal foci responsible for atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke while increasing the risk of bleeding. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system assesses the risk of stroke, with a score of 2 or greater indicating a need for anticoagulation. The HAS-BLED score estimates the risk of bleeding. Scores of 3 or greater indicate high risk. Warfarin, dabigatran, factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban), and aspirin are options for stroke prevention. Selection of therapy should be individualized based on risks and potential benefits, cost, and patient preference. Left atrial appendage obliteration is an option for reducing stroke risk. Two implantable devices used to occlude the appendage, the Watchman and the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug, appear to be as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke, but they are invasive. Another percutaneous approach to occlusion, wherein the left atrium is closed off using the Lariat, is also available, but data on its long-term effectiveness and safety are still limited. Surgical treatments for atrial fibrillation are reserved for patients who are undergoing cardiac surgery for other reasons.",

To test whether high salt affects the NO production via regulation of endothelial ENaC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated in solutions containing either normal or high sodium (additional 20\u2009mM NaCl). Our data showed that high sodium treatment significantly increased \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-ENaC expression levels in HUVECs. Using the cell-attached patch-clamp technique, we demonstrated that high sodium treatment significantly increased ENaC open probability (P O ). Moreover, nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation (Ser 1177) levels and NO production were significantly decreased by high sodium in HUVECs; the effects of high sodium on eNOS phosphorylation and NO production were inhibited by a specific ENaC blocker, amiloride. Our results showed that high sodium decreased AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in endothelial cells. On the other hand, metformin, an AMPK activator, prevented high sodium-induced upregulation of ENaC expression and P O . Moreover, metformin prevented high salt-induced decrease in NO production and eNOS phosphorylation. These results suggest that high sodium stimulates ENaC activation by negatively modulating AMPK activity, thereby leading to reduction in eNOS activity and NO production in endothelial cells.",

From 2,229 consecutive decompensated heart failure patients, a total of 47 HFrEF patients who underwent revascularization were included in the analysis. Improvement of LVEF was defined as [(LVEF during chronic phase) - (LVEF during acute phase)] \u2265 10%.

There are \u223c30 commonly used \u03b2-blockers, representing a diverse class of drugs with different receptor affinities and pleiotropic properties. We reported that among 14 \u03b2-blockers tested previously, only carvedilol effectively suppressed cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2)-mediated spontaneous Ca(2+) waves during store Ca(2+) overload, also known as store overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). Given the critical role of SOICR in arrhythmogenesis, it is of importance to determine whether there are other \u03b2-blockers that suppress SOICR. Here, we assessed the effect of other commonly used \u03b2-blockers on RyR2-mediated SOICR in HEK293 cells, using single-cell Ca(2+) imaging. Of the 13 \u03b2-blockers tested, only nebivolol, a \u03b2-1-selective \u03b2-blocker with nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-stimulating action, effectively suppressed SOICR. The NOS inhibitor (N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester) had no effect on nebivolol's SOICR inhibition, and the NOS activator (histamine or prostaglandin E2) alone did not inhibit SOICR. Hence, nebivolol's SOICR inhibition was independent of NOS stimulation. Like carvedilol, nebivolol reduced the opening of single RyR2 channels and suppressed spontaneous Ca(2+) waves in intact hearts and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) in the mice harboring a RyR2 mutation (R4496C). Interestingly, a non-\u03b2-blocking nebivolol enantiomer, (l)-nebivolol, also suppressed SOICR and CPVT without lowering heart rate.

These proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Although mAbs against IL-19 and IL-20 have each been shown to modulate disease severity of collagen-induced arthritis in animal models, and anti-IL-20 therapeutic Ab has exhibited some efficacy in the treatment of RA in clinical trials, benefits for a complete blockade of these functionally redundant cytokines remain to be explored. In this report, we show that recombinant human soluble IL-20R2-Fc fusion protein binds to IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 with similar high affinity and blocks their signaling in vitro. In DBA/1 mouse collagen-induced arthritis model, recombinant human IL-20R2-Fc exhibits comparable efficacy as TNF blocker etanercept in the treatment of established arthritis, whereas the combined use of both biologics manifests little synergistic therapeutic effects. In situ ligand-receptor functional binding analysis shows that a large amount of immune infiltrates expressing high levels of TNFR and IL-20 subfamily cytokines congregate within the inflamed disease tissues. Colocalization experiments reveal that signals from IL-20R2 and TNF transduction pathways seem to converge in macrophages and function in tandem in orchestrating the pathogenesis of RA. Elucidation of this interaction provides a better understanding of cytokine cross-talk in RA and a rationale for more effective biologic therapies that target IL-20R2 instead of individual cytokines from IL-20 family.",

The photosensitized transformation of DMABN, the selected probe compound, was characterized in detail under UV-A and visible irradiation (\u03bb > 320 nm) to avoid direct phototransformation. Low reactivity of DMABN with singlet oxygen was found (second-order rate constant <2 \u00d7 10(7) M(-1) s(-1)). Typically at least 85% of the reactivity of DMABN could be inhibited by DOM or the model antioxidant phenol. The photosensitized transformation of DMABN mainly proceeded (>72%) through demethylation yielding N-methyl-4-cyanoaniline and formaldehyde as primary products.

A variety of treatment methods have been documented for the management of IH over the past years, including pharmacotherapy via oral administration or injection of corticosteroids, vincristine, alpha interferon and bleomycin; laser therapy, radionuclide therapy, cryotherapy and excisional surgery. The therapeutic efficacy of each treatment modality is variable, while adverse effects or complications are common and sometimes serious. Since the serendipitous discovery of propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, being very efficacious in treating IH in 2008, oral propranolol has earned a role as a first-line medical therapy for complicated IH. However, the appropriate drug dosage, dosing regimen, time for initiation, optimal duration, monitoring for side effects remains controversial. To standardize the use of propranolol in treating IH, avoid overtreatment or under-treatment, as well as minimize complications, a Chinese experts consensus on the use of oral propranolol for treatment of IH has been approved and written by a multidisciplinary experts group based on an up-to-date literature review and repeated discussion.",

The first was a 60-year-old, hypertensive male smoker, the second a 66-year-old dyslipidemic female non-smoker. Both were diagnosed as having RA in 2010, and started treatment with MTX plus CZP. The first patient developed undatable atrial fibrillation, which was resistant to pharmacological treatment and electrical cardioversion. The second patient developed an atrial flutter, which was treated with a betablocker. In both cases, we set a cautious interval between two consecutive administrations of CZP and, in the first case, also reduced the dose of MTX without any worsening of RA activity. Although many studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a pathogenetic role in inducing an arrhythmogenic substrate that is apparently rescued by anti-TNF drugs, there is still a lack of conclusive data.

The recent serendipitous discoveries of propranolol and sirolimus for vascular anomalies have revolutionized this field. In particular, sirolimus responses are challenging the dogma that vascular malformations are not biologically active. While initially explored for lymphatic anomalies, sirolimus is now being used broadly throughout the spectrum of vascular anomalies. Whether medical therapies are reserved for refractory patients or used first line is currently dependent on the experience and availability of alternative therapies at each institution.

Functional complications obstructing vital structures or impairing function include periocular, nasal, labial, parotid, auricular, and breast IHs. Local complications arise from ulceration or those in cosmetically sensitive areas. Therapeutic options for complicated IHs include pharmacologic (topical or systemic), surgical, or laser interventions.

This deleterious effect is poorly understood, and thus strategies to avoid this side effect remain elusive. We show here that fluoxetine (Flx), one of the most-prescribed SSRIs, acts on bone remodeling through two distinct mechanisms. Peripherally, Flx has anti-resorptive properties, directly impairing osteoclast differentiation and function through a serotonin-reuptake-independent mechanism that is dependent on intracellular Ca(2+) levels and the transcription factor Nfatc1. With time, however, Flx also triggers a brain-serotonin-dependent rise in sympathetic output that increases bone resorption sufficiently to counteract its local anti-resorptive effect, thus leading to a net effect of impaired bone formation and bone loss. Accordingly, neutralizing this second mode of action through co-treatment with the \u03b2-blocker propranolol, while leaving the peripheral effect intact, prevents Flx-induced bone loss in mice. Hence, this study identifies a dual mode of action of SSRIs on bone remodeling and suggests a therapeutic strategy to block the deleterious effect on bone homeostasis from their chronic use.",

A simple way to improve the peak shape is the addition to the hydro-organic mobile phase of a reagent (usually called additive) with cationic character. This associates with the stationary phase to prevent the access of analytes to the free silanol groups. Cationic additives may interact electrostatically with the anionic silanols. The hydrophobic region of the additive may also associate with the alkyl chains bound to the stationary phase, with the positive charge oriented towards the mobile phase. The access to the silanol groups is thus blocked, but in turn, the stationary phase is positively charged and will repel the protonated basic compounds, which unless their polarity is sufficiently low, will elute at very short times. In this work, a comparative study of the performance of a group of amines (butylamine, pentylamine, hexylamine, cyclopentylamine, cycloheptylamine, N,N-dimethyloctylamine and tributylmethylammonium chloride), as modifiers of the chromatographic behaviour of basic compounds, is carried out. The behaviour is compared with that obtained with the ionic liquids 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, used as additives. The study revealed that the performance of the cationic additives to block the silanol activity is mainly explained by the additive size and its ability to be adsorbed onto the stationary phase.",

Thus, considerable interest has emerged regarding the potential use of common pharmaceutical agents as chemopreventative and chemotherapeutic options. Aspirin, metformin, statins, \u03b2-blockers, and bisphosphonates have biologically plausible mechanisms to inhibit pancreatic neoplasia, whereas dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors may promote it. Regardless, real-world epidemiological data remain inconclusive. This review examines the hypotheses, evidence, and current state of the literature for each of these medications and their potential roles in the prevention and treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

Treatment options are limited due to incomplete understanding of LM pathobiology. Expression of an activated \u03b22-adrenergic receptor has been described in LM tissue, suggesting that this pathway may contribute to the clinical manifestations of LM. We hypothesized that propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, might improve symptoms of patients with LMs and lymphatic anomalies. A retrospective chart review of patients treated with propranolol as an adjunct therapy was conducted; analyses included demographic characteristics, clinical features, and response to propranolol. Three patients with cystic and noncystic LMs displayed clinical improvement at a minimum dose of 0.7 mg/kg/d, whereas symptomatic relapses were observed when propranolol doses dropped below this threshold. Two patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome demonstrated partial clinical responses with reduced edema. The fetus of a mother treated with propranolol from a gestational age of 35 weeks through delivery displayed arrested growth of a cervicofacial LM. Our retrospective review suggests that propranolol improved symptoms in a subset of patients with lymphatic anomalies. Propranolol treatment may also limit the growth of congenital LMs in utero.", 
    "204": "Control of the heart rate (rate control) is central to atrial fibrillation management, even for patients who ultimately require control of the rhythm. We review heart rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation, including the rationale for the intervention, patient selection, and the treatments available. The choice of rate control depends on the symptoms and clinical characteristics of the patient, but for all patients with atrial fibrillation, rate control is part of the management. Choice of drugs is patient-dependent. \u03b2 blockers, alone or in combination with digoxin, or non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (not in heart failure) effectively lower the heart rate. Digoxin is least effective, but a reasonable choice for physically inactive patients aged 80 years or older, in whom other treatments are ineffective or are contraindicated, and as an additional drug to other rate-controlling drugs, especially in heart failure when instituted cautiously. Atrioventricular node ablation with pacemaker insertion for rate control should be used as an approach of last resort but is also an option early in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation treated with cardiac resynchronisation therapy. However, catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation should be considered before atrioventricular node ablation. Although rate control is a top priority and one of the first management issues for all patients with atrial fibrillation, many issues remain.",

Consequently developing this kind of formulations for low permeability molecules requires strategies to increase their ability to cross the colonic membrane. The objective of this work is to show if an ion-pair formation can improve the colon permeability of atenolol as a low permeability drug model. Two counter ions have been tested: brilliant blue and bromophenol blue. The Distribution coefficients at pH7.00 (DpH7) of atenolol, atenolol + brilliant blue and atenolol + bromophenol blue were experimentally determined in n-octanol. Moreover, the colonic permeability was determined in rat colon using in situ closed loop perfusion method based in Doluisio's Technique. To check the potential effects of the counter ions on the membrane integrity, a histological assessment of colonic tissue was done. The results of the partitioning studies were inconclusive about ion-pair formation; nevertheless colon permeability was significantly increased by both counter ions (from 0.232\u00b10.021cm/s to 0.508\u00b10.038cm/s in the presence of brilliant blue and to 0.405\u00b10.044cm/s in the presence of bromophenol blue). Neither damage on the membrane was observed on the histological studies, nor any change on paracellular permeability suggesting that the permeability enhancement could be attributed to the ion-pair formation.",

Monthly adherence was defined as having \u226524 days covered out of 30, leading to a repeated binary outcome measure.

    "222": "Ghrelin is an orexigenic gastric peptide hormone secreted when caloric intake is limited. Ghrelin also regulates blood glucose, as emphasized by the hypoglycemia that is induced by caloric restriction in mouse models of deficient ghrelin signaling. Here, we hypothesized that activation of \u03b21-adrenergic receptors (\u03b21ARs) localized to ghrelin cells is required for caloric restriction-associated ghrelin release and the ensuing protective glucoregulatory response. In mice lacking the \u03b21AR specifically in ghrelin-expressing cells, ghrelin secretion was markedly blunted, resulting in profound hypoglycemia and prevalent mortality upon severe caloric restriction. Replacement of ghrelin blocked the effects of caloric restriction in \u03b21AR-deficient mice. We also determined that treating calorically restricted juvenile WT mice with beta blockers led to reduced plasma ghrelin and hypoglycemia, the latter of which is similar to the life-threatening, fasting-induced hypoglycemia observed in infants treated with beta blockers. These findings highlight the critical functions of ghrelin in preventing hypoglycemia and promoting survival during severe caloric restriction and the requirement for ghrelin cell-expressed \u03b21ARs in these processes. Moreover, these results indicate a potential role for ghrelin in mediating beta blocker-associated hypoglycemia in susceptible individuals, such as young children.",

This study included 3,004 patients with CAD treated with drug-eluting stent from 123 Japanese participating centers. The achievement of OMT was defined as control of blood pressure <130/80\u00a0mm Hg, hemoglobin A1c <7.0%, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <100\u00a0mg/dl. The primary end point was target vessel failure, a composite of death related to the target vessel, myocardial infarction, or clinically driven revascularization at 24\u00a0months after stent implantation. Immediately before the procedure, only 548 patients (18.2%) had achieved all 3 target criteria (the achieved OMT group), whereas the remaining 2,456 patients failed to achieve one or more criteria (the non-OMT group). At 24\u00a0months, the incidence of target vessel failure was 7.0% in the achieved OMT group versus 10.0% in the non-OMT group (hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.96, p\u00a0= 0.03). The incidence of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction was also lower in the achieved OMT group than in the non-OMT group (0.5% vs 1.5%, p\u00a0= 0.08). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that hemoglobin A1c <7.0% was the only protective predictor of 24-month target vessel failure (odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.73, p <0.01). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that in patients with stable CAD scheduled for stent implantation, achievement of OMT before percutaneous coronary intervention significantly reduced subsequent cardiac events. Achievement of OMT is still insufficient in modern clinical practice.",

    "236": "In the current paper there were used two methods for assessment of the propranolol effect on reactivated memory at reconsolidation phase--a classical pavlovian conditioning and the two-ways escape reflex. The difference between these two models was that in the first case a tone was paired with electrocutaneous painful stimulation only once, while in the second case it was applied multiply. Reminding was produced in the first case by placing the animals into the same context, whereas in the second case by application of the same amount of pairings of conditional and unconditional stimuli as it was used at the first day of learning. Propranolol reduced intensity of freezing reaction on 25% from the baseline at the classical conditioning approach and practically led to disappearance of memory and complete regress of the two-ways escape reflex. There was suggested on existence of the possible different mechanisms of noradrenergic blockade on memory loss at the stage of its reconsolidation in the used models of learning.", 
    "237": "Dysfunctional fear responses play a central role in many mental disorders. New insights in learning and memory suggest that pharmacological and behavioural interventions during the reconsolidation of reactivated fear memories may increase the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. It has been proposed that interventions applied during reconsolidation may modify the original fear memory, and thus prevent the spontaneous recovery and reinstatement of the fear response.", 
    "238": "We investigated whether pharmacological (propranolol) and behavioural (reappraisal, multisensory stimulation) interventions reduce fear memory, and prevent reinstatement of fear in comparison to a placebo control group. Eighty healthy female subjects underwent a differential fear conditioning procedure with three stimuli (CS). Two of these (CS+) were paired with an electric shock on day 1. On day 2, 20 subjects were pseudo-randomly assigned to either the propranolol or placebo condition, or underwent one of the two behavioural interventions after one of the two CS+ was reactivated.

In conclusion, our findings do not support a beneficial effect in using reconsolidation processes to enhance effects of psychotherapeutic interventions. This implies that more research is required before therapeutic interventions may benefit from a combination with reconsolidation processes.", 
    "241": "The discovery that fear memories may change upon retrieval, a process referred to as memory reconsolidation, opened avenues to develop a revolutionary new treatment for emotional memory disorders. Reconsolidation is a two-phase process in which retrieval of a memory initiates a transient period of memory destabilization, followed by a protein synthesis-dependent restabilization phase. This reconsolidation window offers unique opportunities for amnesic agents to interfere with the process of memory restabilization, thereby weakening or even erasing the emotional expression from specific fear memories. Here we present four uncontrolled case descriptions of patients with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who received a reconsolidation intervention. The intervention basically involves a brief reactivation of the trauma memory aimed to trigger memory destabilization, followed by the intake of one pill of 40 mg propranolol HCl (i.e. a noradrenergic beta-blocker) that should disrupt the process of memory restabilization. We present three cases who showed a steep decline of fear symptoms after only one or two intervention sessions. To illustrate that the translation from basic science to clinical practice is not self-evident, we also present a description of a noneffective intervention in a relatively complex case. Even though the reconsolidation intervention is very promising, the success of the treatment depends on whether the memory reactivation actually triggers memory reconsolidation. Obviously the uncontrolled observations described here warrant further study in placebo-controlled designs.",

A prospective study was conducted in the Cardiology Center of the Clinical Center of Montenegro and included 138 patients who had received any \u03b2-blocker in their therapy. ADRs were collected using a specially designed questionnaire, based on the symptom list and any signs that could point to eventual ADRs. Data from patients' medical charts, laboratory tests, and other available parameters were observed and combined with the data from the questionnaire. ADRs to \u03b2-blockers were observed in 15 (10.9%) patients. There was a statistically significant difference in the frequency of ADRs in relation to genetically determined enzymatic activity (P<0.001), with ADRs' occurrence significantly correlating with slower CYP2D6 metabolism. Our study showed that the adverse reactions to \u03b2-blockers could be predicted by the length of hospitalization, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype, and the concomitant use of other CYP2D6-metabolizing drugs. Therefore, in hospitalized patients with polypharmacy CYP2D6 genotyping might be useful in detecting those at risk of ADRs.", 
    "243": "The aim of the present work was to prepare and evaluate sublingual fast dissolving films containing metoprolol tartrate-loaded niosomes. Niosomes were utilized to allow for prolonged release of the drug, whereas the films were used to increase the drug's bioavailability via the sublingual route. Niosomes were prepared using span 60 and cholesterol at different drug to surfactant ratios. The niosomes were characterized for size, zeta-potential, and entrapment efficiency. The selected niosomal formulation was incorporated into polymeric films using hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose E15 and methyl cellulose as film-forming polymers and Avicel as superdisintegrant. The physical characteristics (appearance, texture, pH, uniformity of weight and thickness, disintegration time, and palatability) of the prepared films were studied, in addition to evaluating the in vitro drug release, stability, and in vivo pharmacokinetics in rabbits. The release of the drug from the medicated film was fast (99.9% of the drug was released within 30 minutes), while the drug loaded into the niosomes, either incorporated into the film or not, showed only 22.85% drug release within the same time. The selected sublingual film showed significantly higher rate of drug absorption and higher drug plasma levels compared with that of commercial oral tablet. The plasma levels remained detectable for 24 hours following sublingual administration, compared with only 12 hours after administration of the oral tablet. In addition, the absolute bioavailability of the drug (ie, relative to intravenous administration) following sublingual administration was found to be significantly higher (91.06%\u00b113.28%), as compared with that after oral tablet administration (39.37%\u00b111.4%). These results indicate that the fast dissolving niosomal film could be a promising delivery system to enhance the bioavailability and prolong the therapeutic effect of metoprolol tartrate."
