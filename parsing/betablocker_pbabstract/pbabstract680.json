With a few exceptions, the acute toxic potency of the five test substances in mice appeared to be: Aggregated mice greater than grouped mice greater than singly-housed mice.", 
    "1": "The effects of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent bucumolol [dl-5-methyl-8-(2-hydroxy-3-t-butylaminoproxy)coumarin] and its optical isomers were compared with those of propranolol and pindolol on the functional refractory period and the conduction time of atrioventricular (A-V) transmission in dogs. In dogs with intact nerves anesthetized with pentobarbital, bucumolol and propranolol (30 micrograms - 1 mg/kg) prolonged both parameters by blockade of background sympathetic nervous tone to A-V conduction. The optical d- and l-isomers of bucumolol depressed A-V conduction almost in parallel with their beta-blocking actions. In dogs with cardiac sympathectomy and bilateral vagotomy, or pretreated with reserpine, the dromotropic activity was lowered and the beta-blocking dose (30 micrograms - 1 mg/kg) of bucumolol and propranolol had less effect on A-V conduction, while larger doses (3-10 mg/kg) produced additional depression of the conduction. Pindolol, on the other hand, had a positive dromotropic action, reflecting its intrinsic stimulatory action. It is concluded that A-V conduction is affected by the existing tone of sympathetic nervous activity and that bucumolol has no beta-stimulant action and depresses A-V conduction by beta-blockade and by a non-specific action.", 
    "2": "We investigated frequency-dependent effects of 12 beta-adrenergic blocking agents, all 1-aryloxy-3-isopropylaminopropane-2-ol derivatives, on the height of the compound action potential of frog sciatic nerves, using sucrose gap techniques. The order of 1/ED50 of these agents at 0.1 Hz for the reduction of the height was: indenolol greater than D-25 greater than propranolol greater than alprenolol greater than pindolol greater than toliprolol greater than oxprenolol greater than befunolol greater than K\u00f61313 greater than acebutolol greater than metoprolol greater than atenolol. The order was similar also at 100 Hz. Logarithms of n-octanol/buffer partition coefficients (log P) correlated well with log (1/ED50) at either 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 Hz (p less than 0.01). The order of log [(ED50)0.1 Hz/(ED50)100 Hz] was oxprenolol greater than befunolol greater than propranolol greater than alprenolol greater than toliprolol greater than indenolol greater than K\u00f61313 greater than pindolol greater than D-25. Molecular weight of these drugs correlated well with the difference of log (ED50)100 Hz and log (ED50)10 Hz from log (ED50)0.1 Hz (P less than 0.05). The results indicate that the local anesthetic potency of these beta-blockers is mainly determined by the lipid solubility of the drugs, being modified by the frequency-dependent component of action which is related to the molecular weight.", 
    "3": "Anxiety is a frequent symptom seen in a variety of clinical settings. Recognizing that therapeutic interventions (including drugs) can be costly and may involve potential risks, treatment of anxiety should proceed with some care. As outlined in Table 3, the first step is to establish a diagnosis, determining whether the anxiety is secondary to primary medical or psychiatric disorders. The remaining significant anxiety states fall into acute situational disturbances (best treated with benzodiazepines on a short-term basis) and the primary anxiety disorders. In each case, counseling or psychotherapy may be appropriate. Treatment of primary anxiety disorders is probably best accomplished by a combination of behavior interventions and, when necessary, temporary use of psychotropic drugs. The specific behavior intervention varies with the disorder (Table 6) and ranges from systematic desensitization or immersion techniques (for phobias) to thought stopping or aversion relief (for obsessive-compulsive behavior) to paradoxical intention (for panic disorders). Temporary use of tricyclic antidepressants or MAO inhibitors (probably equally effective) should be considered in the major anxiety disorders when panic attacks become frequent or subjective anxiety levels become intolerably high. Treatment of situational anxiety usually rests with counseling. When functioning is impaired, benzodiazepines can be most helpful as antianxiety agents or as hypnotics (e.g., flurazepam) for periods not to exceed 2-3 weeks.", 
    "4": "To investigate the intrahepatic disposition of drugs subjected to the first-pass effect, propranolol (0.002 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) was injected into the portal vein of rats. At various times the drug was measured in liver homogenate, cytosol, smooth microsomal, and Golgi fractions. The results suggest that hepatic uptake of propranolol is an extremely rapid process and essentially complete, independently of the dose. Effectively at 0.5 min, 70% and 85% of the low and high doses, respectively, were recovered in the liver homogenate. Furthermore following the 0.002-mg/kg dose, 96% of the recovered drug equivalents in the suprahepatic blood consisted of metabolites. An additional experiment demonstrated that the uptake of a 0.002-mg/kg dose of propranolol was not modified by a loading dose of 25 mg/kg. The pattern of propranolol distribution correlated with the intracellular localization of phospholipids and proteins. The amount of propranolol found in subcellular fractions relative to liver homogenate remained constant throughout the study, suggesting a rapid equilibrium. Low doses of propranolol were cleared from the hepatic cells almost completely by biotransformation. However, high doses saturated the metabolic clearance. Propranolol metabolites accumulated preferentially in the cytosol fraction. The intracellular elimination of the metabolites appeared to be a saturable process. The Golgi apparatus does not seem to be involved in the elimination of propranolol or its polar metabolites.", 
    "5": "1 The speed of onset of the pharmacodynamic activity of intravenous propranolol, practolol, oxprenolol and metoprolol was determined, using attenuation of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia as the end-point, in 16 patients with clinically coronary heart disease. 2 Antagonism was evident within 15 s of injection into the central circulation of all four drugs. The time to maximum attenuation of isoprenaline tachycardia was significantly more rapid with propranolol and oxprenolol than with practolol and metoprolol.", 
    "6": "A prolonged Q-T interval (0.56 to 0.70 s.) with second degree A-V block was present in 5 children. Auscultation in utero (2 cases) or at birth (1 case) and syncopal attacks at 15 days and 2 months of life led to the discovery of the arrhythmia which was complicated with torsades de pointes. One patient died at 1 month of age; another is treated with propranolol and an internal pacemaker; the last 3 recovered, either spontaneously or with propranolol. The originality of this syndrome of unknown etiology is due to the A-V block, secondary to delayed repolarization (prolonged Q-T interval). Torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation are the main risks. Treatment includes beta adrenergic blocking agents associated with a temporarily implanted pacemaker. In a few cases, the internal pacemaker has to be left permanently.", 
    "7": "The hemodynamic effects of a new cardioselective beta agonist, prenalterol, were evaluated in 12 patients with moderate or severe impairment of left ventricular function due to coronary heart disease or primary cardiomyopathy. In doses up to 7 mg the drug led to a substantial increase of left ventricular pressure rise (+55%) and mean circumferential fiber shortening (+59%) and a decrease of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (-52%), mean pulmonary artery pressure (-24%) and pulmonary vascular resistance (-37%) indicating augmented myocardial contractility and reduced left ventricular preload. Cardiac output was increased only in 4 of 12 patients, heart rate, left ventricular systolic and mean right atrial pressures and the pressure-rate product as an index for myocardial oxygen demand remained essentially unchanged. The same is true for stroke index, stroke work index, total peripheral resistance, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume and ejection fraction. The positive inotropic effect was achieved with good tolerance and without arrhythmogenic or other side effects. Prenalterol may be especially useful in patients with low sympathetic activity and hypotension. In patients with diffuse congestive cardiomyopathy, high sympathetic activity, pronounced peripheral vasoconstriction and normal blood pressure, vasodilator therapy alone or in combination with prenalterol should be considered.", 
    "8": "After a four-hour long immobilization stress, heart muscle cells, viewed in the electron microscope, showed a fine swelling of the endothelium of the capillaries, a fine dilatation of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum, but formation of fat drops was rare. Following sudden withdrawal of the application of metipronolol stress caused more serious damage to the ultrastructure of the heart muscle cells than if the animals were subjected to stress alone. The authors observed large accumulations of fat droplets, dilatation of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum, swollen mitochondria and spindle shaped dehiscences in the intercalated discs. Immobilization stress led to increased activity of creatine kinase in the serum, while previous application of metipranolol caused its decrease.", 
    "9": "Important advances have been made in understanding the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of hypertensive disorders. Measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone is very important in the assessment of secondary hypertension. Hypertensions with increased PRA include renovascular hypertension, some cases of unilateral and bilateral renal parenchymal disease, malignant hypertension, hypertension associated with oral contraceptive agents, and renin-secreting tumors. Hypertension with decreased PRA is observed in four recognized types of primary aldosteronism: adenoma, bilateral hyperplasia, indeterminate aldosteronism, and glucocorticoid-responsive aldosteronism. Other conditions with hypertension and depressed PRA include ACTH and DOC secreting tumors, primary hyperpituitarism, syndromes of 17-hydroxylase and 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. Liddle's syndrome, licorice abuse, exogenous administration of mineralocorticoids, and preeclampsia.", 
    "10": "beta-Blockers are effective in the symptomatic relief of angina pectoris by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand during effort and emotional stress. Agents with ISA such as pindolol produce effective beta-blockade during effort or emotional stress while conferring significant protection from myocardial depression and bradycardia at rest. In addition, agents with ISA have been shown to depress respiratory function to a lesser extent and to induce fewer peripheral vascular side effects than compounds devoid of this property. These potential effects of ISA may be counterbalanced by the consideration that ISA may be undesirable in angina occurring at rest or at low exercise levels. Additional well-controlled trials in patients with angina and resting bradycardia or impaired left ventricular function are needed to further document the clinical importance of ISA.", 
    "11": "The effects of indenolol (7.0-100 mumol/l), befunolol (15.3-250 mumol/l), metoprolol (58.4-1000 mumol/l), K\u00f6707 (7.3-100 mumol/l), D-25 (3.7-100 mumol/l) and K\u00f61313 (73.9-1000 mumol/l) on action potentials were investigated in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscles. All these aryloxyisopropylaminopropanol derivatives produced a concentration-dependent reduction of V max at a basic rate of 1 Hz. The reduction was less prominent when interstimulus intervals were prolonged. The time course of recovery of V max during diastole was studied by assessing V max in premature responses at 0.25, 0.1 and 0.027 Hz and in responses after interrupting driving stimuli of 1 Hz. The recovery process was approximated by a single exponential function prominent when interstimulus intervals were prolonged. The time course of recovery of V max during diastole was studied by assessing V max in premature responses at 0.25, 0.1 and 0.027 Hz and in responses after interrupting driving stimuli of 1 Hz. The recovery process was approximated by a single exponential function prominent when interstimulus intervals were prolonged. The time course of recovery of V max during diastole was studied by assessing V max in premature responses at 0.25, 0.1 and 0.027 Hz and in responses after interrupting driving stimuli of 1 Hz. The recovery process was approximated by a single exponential function. The results, together with those reported previously (Sada and Ban 1980, 1981), revealed: (1) a significant correlation between potencies of these derivatives for depression of V max at 0.027, 0.25, 1 and 5 Hz and their log n-octanol/water partition coefficients (log P): (2) The time constants of recovery were relatively concentration independent and correlated significantly with the molecular weights. The results suggest that the potency of these drugs for the depression of V max was mainly determined by log P, being modified secondarily by the time constants of recovery which are intimately associated with the molecular weights.", 
    "12": "A study was made of the effect of beta-adrenomimetics (isoprenaline, orciprenaline, inoline) and beta-adrenoblockers (propranolol, pindolol, oxprenolol, atenolol and practolol) on changes in the tone of smooth muscles of an isolate ileum of guinea-pigs, increase in microvascular permeability and depressor reaction in rats induced by bradykinin. beta-Adrenomimetics decreased spasmogenic and microcirculatory effects of bradykinin. Depending on the selectivity and presence of partial agonistic activity, beta-adrenoblockers exerted different influence on changes in the tone of extravasal muscles and permeability induced by bradykinin. In doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg (intravenously) beta-adrenoblockers potentiated and prolonged the depressor effect of bradykinin.", 
    "13": "We compared the antianginal efficacy of one conventional and three long acting beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents in a randomised manner in 12 patients with stable angina pectoris. An exercise test was performed initially and in the 24th hour after a single daily dose of 160 mg of each beta-blocker at the end of a two week treatment period. In addition, glyceryl trinitrate consumption, anginal attack rate, and activity scores were recorded. No titration studies to an equivalent degree of beta-blockade were undertaken; a fixed dose was used even though these drugs are not equipotent. Conventional propranolol in a single daily dose of 160 mg was as effective in controlling the frequency of anginal attacks as long acting propranolol and sustained release oxprenolol. Exercise tolerance was less with sustained release oxprenolol than with conventional propranolol, long acting propranolol, and nadolol. Nadolol produced a significantly greater reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia than did long acting propranolol, sustained release oxprenolol, and conventional propranolol, and also the lowest anginal attack rate, the lowest trinitrin consumption, and significantly less ST segment depression than the other three. These findings suggest that nadolol is more potent than long acting propranolol, sustained release oxprenolol, and conventional propranolol, and the antianginal benefit at the 24th hour relates to the degree of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade achieved.", 
    "14": "Twenty-five patients with moderate essential hypertension (standing diastolic blood pressure 100-125 mmHg, phase 5) completed a single-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study comparing four week periods of treatment with atenolol 100 mg, metoprolol 100 mg, metoprolol durules 200 mg, slow-release oxprenolol 160 mg, and slow-release oxprenolol 320 mg respectively. All the drugs were significantly better than placebo at reducing resting blood pressure at 24 hours. Atenolol produced the greatest mean reduction of pressure and was the most effective drug for most patients, though the differences between atenolol and metoprolol durules were not statistically significant. These two drugs, however, were significantly more effective than the remainder. A similar ranking was seen with respect to the reduction of the blood pressure and heart rate response to exercise. None of the treatments had any significant effect on the patients' rating of perceived exertion during the exercise test.", 
    "15": "The synthesis and structure-activity relationships of a series of threo-1-(aryloxy)-3-(alkylamino)butan-2-ols are discussed. These compounds are less potent beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists than the corresponding 1-(aryloxy)-3-(alkylamino)propan-2-ols. The data presented indicate that, unlike the arylethanolamine series, substitution of an alkyl group on the carbon atom alpha to the amino function on the oxypropanolamine side chain does not necessarily lead to enhanced vascular (beta 2) selectivity.", 
    "16": "There is evidence that the beta blocking drugs are useful in angina pectoris, inhibiting the tachycardia of exercise and other forms of stress, such as emotion. In myocardial infarction, there is experimental evidence in animals and man for the effectiveness of these drugs in restoring the supply/demand balance of the ischaemic areas, and thus limiting infarct size. They may act partly by redistributing the coronary blood flow from areas of relatively good perfusion to those less well supplied. Cardiac pain is reduced in angina and also post-infarction. In contrast to the usual haemodynamic effect of beta blockade, muscle contraction of the ischaemic myocardium may be improved. Beta adrenergic blocking drugs may reduce the incidence of reinfarction when given as a prophylactic to post-infarction patients.", 
    "17": "During tests of driving performance and kinetic visual acuity (KVA) under the influence of antihypertensive drugs (methyldopa, propranolol, atenolol, and reserpine), a significant improvement in KVA was found with atenolol and deterioration in driving was found with methyldopa and reserpine. Further tests of subjective response using an analogue rating scale revealed an apparently clear anxiolytic effect of atenolol. This was a surprising result as this particular beta-blocking agent is said not to penetrate the brain tissue via the blood/brain barrier. Preliminary results of the effect of atenolol on sleep showed that it reduced the number of changes in level of sleep thereby making it more restful. Atenolol is, therefore, an interesting compound having obvious peripheral but no central effects, but can yet act as an anxiolytic agent and influence the quality of sleep.", 
    "18": "In 13 hypertensive patients taking the beta-receptor blocker atenolol, EEG and behaviour effects were studied. Using a single-blind sequential trial design, a 5-d placebo period was followed by a 6-d atenolol treatment period (100 mg/d). During either treatment period, two examinations yielded data derived from neurophysiological, test-psychological, and cardiovascular measurements. The statistically significant changes due to atenolol therapy indicated an improvement of vigilance, a smooth anxiolytic and tranquilizing effect, and at least no negative influences on discriminatory reaction time and concentration ability. The primary therapeutic effects were significant falls in systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as in pulse rates. The study is still in progress and will be completed after 20 patients are reached. The data will then be reanalyzed in order to get further insight into CNS effects of a beta-blocking therapy concerning favorable vs. poor drug responders.", 
    "19": "Visual reaction time as a measure of vigilance and of the psychophysiological condition of subjects, was determined after combined physical and mental stress to examine the influence of beta blockade. Using the technique of electro-oculography, 40 subjects aged 25.7 +/- 6 years, with a mean blood pressure of 126/79 torr, were studied in a double-blind crossover design after application of placebo or 50 mg atenolol for 3 d. Visual reaction time was defined as the time between display of a peripheral light signal and the start of the eye movement that shifts the direction of gaze from the reference point to the stimulus. The results of the study show that, under these experimental conditions, there is a positive effect of beta blocker medication on vigilance. Findings of other authors are discussed. To prove the sensitivity of the test method in a preliminary study, the effects of the well-known drugs fenethylline-hydrochioride, diazepam, oxazepam, and alcohol on visual reaction time were investigated.", 
    "20": "Recent work on the use of beta blockade in the treatment of mild hypertension is reviewed. It is clear from these studies that this form of antihypertensive therapy can exercise a protective influence on cerebrovascular events and on fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction. In particular, there is evidence of reduced rate of reinfarction when beta-blocking agents are started soon after the first event. The comparative efficacy and side effects profile of the various clinically available beta blockers are discussed, as differences between these are now becoming more apparent. In particular, the degree of water or lipid solubility may determine which will penetrate into brain tissue with resultant central effect; the more water soluble, the less likely this is to occur. It is also important that those which are not metabolised by the liver can be more easily titrated as they do not require large changes in dosage; some may be given once daily. The use of beta blockade in the presence of airway resistance is strongly contraindicated but, if it has to be used, this should be started in hospital with a cardioselective agent.", 
    "21": "There is a possibility that beta-receptor blocking drugs may modify psychomotor performance, either peripherally or centrally. The inherent problems in evaluating the effects of drugs on performance are mainly due to interpretation of what is meant by \"psychomotor\" as the term embraces many mental and physical skills. In addition, statistical validation is often difficult. The current literature is reviewed with these provisos in mind and 24 studies of the effects of beta blockade are discussed. Of these 15 could be assessed as showing \"no effect\" and, of the remaining 9, improved performance was reported in 6 and impairment in 3. There is a wide variation in the results of such studies but, in general, it would appear that while the clinical use of beta-blocking drugs in aviation may produce an adverse effect on performance, it should be no greater than ordinary day-to-day variation.", 
    "22": "The comparative effects of three lipophilic beta blocking agents--propranolol (80 mg b.i.d.) metoprolol (200 mg/d) and oxprenolol (160 mg/d) and one hydrophilic agent, atenolol (100 mg/d), were studied in patients undergoing neurosurgery. The respective penetration of these compounds into brain tissue and CSF was measured and correlated with plasma levels. The brain concentration of the three lipophilic beta blockers was high--propranolol some 20 times and oxprenolol and metoprolol some 10 times greater than the concentration of the hydrophilic, atenolol. The clinical relevance of this may be important in reducing the severity of centrally-mediated side effects, such as hallucinations and sleeplessness, by using a beta blocker less likely to penetrate the blood/brain barrier.", 
    "23": "We have used multiple isotope infusions to study the integrated response of glucose, fat, and protein metabolism to combined alpha + beta-adrenergic blockade in conscious, unstressed, fasting (15 h) dogs. The response to the blocking agents was evaluated both with and without control of the glucoregulatory hormones. The hormones were controlled at the basal level by infusions of somatostatin and metyrapone to block their secretion, and by the infusion of insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, and cortisol at physiological rates. We found that adrenergic blockade markedly inhibited lipolysis, as reflected by falls in glycerol and plasma FFA appearance. The decrease in fat mobilization after blockade resulted in a proportionate shift from fat as an energy substrate toward carbohydrate. Glucose production and oxidation were both enhanced after blockade. The source of the increased glucose production was presumably hepatic glycogen because urea production was presumably hepatic glycogen because urea production was unaffected and glycerol uptake was decreased. These results are consistent with the interpretation that basal adrenergic activity plays an important role in the mobilization of fat in fasting dogs. A secondary consequence of that action is apparently a diminution of glucose production and oxidation, although the mechanism responsible for the latter response is not clear.", 
    "24": "Six hypertensive patients with daily ventricular arrhythmias underwent a double-blind crossover study to examine whether a once daily regimen of beta receptor blockade was equipotent in antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic activity to a twice daily regimen. Acebutolol, a relatively cardioselective beta blocking compound with intrinsic sympathomimetic properties, was given in two regimens: 200 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily. Ventricular ectopic beats were analyzed both during physical exercise and with multiple 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings. Serum concentrations of acebutolol and its acetyl metabolite were determined using high pressure liquid chromatography. The two regimens of acebutolol were equally potent in reducing the blood pressure and heart rate at rest and during physical exertion. The hourly heart rates during 24 hours were reduced to the same extent by both regimens. The single daily 400 mg dose did not significantly reduce the incidence of arrhythmias, whereas 200 mg twice daily evoked a significant reduction during 24 hours. Serum concentrations of acebutolol were twice as great with the twice daily regimen as with the single dose. Both treatments significantly shortened the Q-Tc interval. The data suggest that, despite apparent beta receptor blockade and good blood pressure control, beta blocking agents with a relatively short plasma half-life lose their antiarrhythmic potency when administered on a once daily basis. This property seems to be more related to the plasma concentration of the compound than to the degree of clinically assessed beta receptor blockade.", 
    "25": "In a double-blind placebo cross-over study, the beta-blocking potencies of acebutolol and propranolol were compared in ten healthy subjects under steady-state conditions of oral drug administration. Beta-adrenergic blockade, determined by the degree of attenuation of tachycardia induced by standardized multistage treadmill exercise, was correlated with dose as well as with the plasma levels of the two beta antagonists. On a weight-for-weight basis, propranolol was about 4 times as potent as acebutolol in inhibiting exercise-induced tachycardia and in reducing the heart rate times systolic blood pressure product due to exercise. A weak correlation was demonstrated between the degree of beta blockade and plasma concentrations of propranolol (r = 0.381, p less than 0.01) or acebutolol (r = 0.333, p less than 0.001), there being up to 20-24 fold interindividual variation in plasma level for a given dose of each compound. Plasma acebutolol levels were associated with at least twofold greater levels of its acetyl homologue metabolite. A positive linear correlation was found between percentage beta blockade and the corresponding doses of propranolol (r = 0.503, p less than 0.001) and of acebutolol (r = 0.574, p less than 0.001). Our overall data provide little support for the use of plasma levels of acebutolol and propranolol as a guide to beta-blocking therapy with these compounds.", 
    "26": "This study compares the sympathetic nervous system response to graded exercise in normotensive and essential hypertensive subjects with and without beta-adrenergic blockade. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and dopamine (DA) were measured just before starting the exercise (Pre-Ex), in the submaximal exercise (Sub-max),and after 8 minutes rest (Post-Ex). On placebo, Sub-max induced in both normotensives and hypertensives a similar increase in NE and E plasma levels. Plasma DA remained unchanged. Propranolol in controls and propranolol or mepindolol in hypertensives didn't modify significantly: 1) Pre-Ex plasma levels of E, NE, and DA; 2) response at Sub-max in controls; 3) plasma E and DA in hypertensive patients. In hypertensives on beta-blockade, submaximal exercise elicited a greater increase in plasma NE. Values for plasma NE in patients on propranolol were 1135 +/- 229 pg/ml higher than those obtained in the same patients on placebo (p less than 0.001). On mepindolol, the plasma NE increment was higher than that on placebo (p less than 0.05), but lower than that on propranolol (p less than 0.01). In controls, propranolol did not significantly modify BP at Pre-Ex or its response to exercise, whereas systolic and diastolic BP were significantly lower at Pre-Ex, Sub-max, and Post-Ex in hypertensives. On beta-blockade, heart rate decrease in Pre-Ex, Sub-max, and Post-Ex were not different in controls and hypertensives. The differences found on beta blockade would indicate that the effects of beta blockers are not identical in normotensive and hypertensive subjects.", 
    "27": "The hemodynamic and metabolic consequences of long-term antihypertensive treatment with beta 1- and beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade was investigated in five young men with mild essential arterial hypertension (World Health Organization stages I and II) at rest and during submaximal exercise in a single-blind crossover study. The drugs (atenolol and alprenolol) were given in equipotent doses as estimated from their effects on blood pressure. Leg blood flow and oxygen uptake were the same during both treatment periods. Muscle glycogen decreased by 40% during exercise, irrespective of the drug. There was a positive relationship between muscle lactate release and concentration, but for a given muscle lactate concentration the release tended to be lower during treatment with alprenolol. A negative correlation was observed between the percentage of slow-twitch fibers versus lactate release and muscle lactate concentration. The results demonstrate that during exercise muscle glycogen breaks down despite beta blockade and is neither reduced when both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors are blocked, nor when only the beta 1-receptors are blocked. It is also shown that beta blockade impairs the translocation of lactate from the muscle cell to the blood and this is greater with alprenolol than with atenolol, probably due to a membrane effect.", 
    "28": "The digital vasospastic phenomena, which are induced by beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, suggest a beta-adrenergic finger vasodilator mechanism. We measured fingertip total blood flow with venous occlusion plethysmography and studied nutritional blood flow with Na131I clearance. During fingertip vasoconstriction caused by branchial artery infusion of norepinephrine or angiotensin, intra-arterial isoproterenol caused a sustained increase in fingertip total blood flow. Furthermore, propranolol significantly potentiated the vasoconstriction caused by intra-arterial norepinephrine and attenuated the vasodilator action of isoproterenol. No change in branchial artery blood pressure occurred to explain the changes in fingertip blood flow. Isoproterenol did not change nutritional flow, implying beta-adrenergic vasodilation solely of the fingertip arteriovenous shunts. When fingertip vasoconstriction was induced by reflex sympathetic nerve action during environmental cooling and mental stress, or by norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves caused by intra-arterial tyramine infusion, isoproterenol and propranolol had no effect on fingertip total blood flow. This effect is probably specific for the beta-receptor agonist, since intra-arterial histamine caused a large increase in finger blood flow during environmental cooling. We conclude that there is a beta-adrenergic vasodilator mechanism in human digital arteriovenous shunts that may be humorally activated, but which has no apparent functional role in modulating sympathetic vasoconstriction. Our results suggest a spatial dissociation of the effector sites for vasoactive humoral agents and sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves.", 
    "29": "Haemodynamic investigations were performed in 40 patients with acute myocardial infarction before and after intravenous application of 6 mg propranolol. Cardiac index was significantly decreased caused by reduction of cardiac frequency and stroke volume. Pulmonary capillary pressure increased significantly. As a consequence pulmonary and peripheral vascular resistance increased. Arterial blood pressure remained largely unaffected. Propranolol showed a haemodynamically beneficial decrease of left ventricular stroke work without signs of negative cardiodepression at a cardiac index of more than 3.0 l/min . m2. At a cardiac index of less than 3.0 l/min . m2 a haemodynamically detrimental lowering of cardiac index to ranges of insufficiency of 2.0 l/min . m2 on average occurred. Thus cardiac index is an important factor for the decision of use of beta-blocking agents in acute myocardial infarction. Indiscriminate use of beta-blocking substances should not be accepted.", 
    "30": "Two weeks after noradrenergic denervation, beta-adrenergic receptor binding increased in 2 of 3 crude fractions of rat cortical homogenates, while the relative distribution of binding was unchanged on continuous sucrose density gradients of the crude synaptosomal fraction. When rat glioma cells were fractionated by the same methods, a band of membranes with beta-adrenergic receptor binding sedimented at the same sucrose density as synaptosomes. Thus membrane receptors remained associated with synaptosomes even in the absence of noradrenergic nerve terminals suggesting that a portion of these receptors are either glial or associated with non-noradrenergic nerve terminals.", 
    "31": "Systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose concentration were measured in the first three days of life in 10 infants born to mothers who had received acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic-blocking agent, for hypertension in pregnancy and compared with values in 10 infants whose mothers had received methyldopa. The blood pressure was expressed as a percentage of the expected value. Blood pressure was significantly lower in the infants of the mothers given acebutolol (p less than 0.02, less than 0.01, and less than 0.01 respectively during the three days of observation). Heart rate was also lower, but the significance was only at the 0.05 level. Blood glucose was not significantly different between the two groups. These results suggest that care should be taken in prescribing beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs during pregnancy.", 
    "32": "An initial dosis of 40 mg followed by 40 mg propranolol (Dociton) t.i.d. for 4 weeks was administered to 16 hypertensive patients with manifest arterial vasoocclusive disease of the pelvic and thigh type (stage II according to Fontaine). Blood pressure decreased 90 minutes after the first oral administration from 174/106 to 155/93 mm Hg. Cardiac frequency was lowered significantly from 75 to 66/min. Occlusion plethysmography and Doppler pressure estimation were not changed significantly either in the acute nor in long-term assessment. The painfree walking distance remained constant 90 minutes after propranolol initially (baseline value 230 m, after 90 minutes 220 m). It rose to 330 m after two weeks and to 350 m after four weeks. Use of beta receptor blocker in arterial vasoocclusive disease is thus not contraindicated, at least as far as stage II is concerned.", 
    "33": "1. Intact toad retinas incubated for short periods of time with [2-3H]glycerol were subject to subcellular fractionation. 2. The composition and labeling of glycerolipids were studied in the following subcellular fractions: rod outer segments (ROS), nuclear-photoreceptor inner segment synaptic body (P1), synaptosomal-mitochondrial (P2), microsomal and cytosolic. 3. It was concluded that the biosynthetic de novo route was followed by [2-3H]glycerol in the toad retina since radioactive was located solely in the glycerol backbone of lipids and phosphatidic acid specific activity was the highest. 4. Propranolol produces an increase in the biosynthesis of acidic phospholipids and inhibition in the biosynthesis of zwitterionic lipids in the entire toad retina. The effect was mainly located in microsomes and in the soluble fraction during the first minutes of incubation, being spread afterwards to other fractions. 5. These data are consistent with the view that enzymes of the biosynthesis of glycerolipids are modified in the retinal endoplasmic reticulum by propranolol, providing a useful tool to evaluate the regulation of the pathway.", 
    "34": "The binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to beta-adrenergic receptors in the rat brainstem was studied. Propranolol inhibited dihydroalprenolol binding to a greater extent than did isoproterenol or epinephrine. Scatchard plots obtained with propranolol were biphasic whereas those obtained with isoproterenol and epinephrine were monophasic. The results indicate that in the brainstem propranolol displaces dihydroalprenolol from sites other than beta-adrenergic receptors. Nonspecific binding of dihydroalprenolol in this tissue therefore cannot be assayed using propranolol but should be measured with isoproterenol or epinephrine.", 
    "35": "The effect of metoprolol on mortality was compared with that of placebo in a double blind randomised trial in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction. Treatment with metoprolol or placebo started as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in hospital and was continued for 90 days. Metoprolol was given as a 15 mg intravenous dose followed by oral administration of 100 mg twice daily. 1395 patients (697 on placebo and 698 on metoprolol) were included in the trial. Definite acute myocardial infarction developed in 809 and probable infarction in 162. Patients were allocated to various risk groups and within each group patients were randomly assigned to treatment with metoprolol or placebo. There were 62 deaths in the placebo group (8.9%) and 40 deaths in the metoprolol group (5.7%), a reduction of 36% (p less than 0.03). Mortality rates are given according to the treatment group to which the patients were initially randomly allocated.", 
    "36": "An account is given of two cases of withdrawal syndrome following discontinuation of an antihypertensive treatment with a single daily dose of Teneretic mite (atenolol/chlortalidone). In one case two different beta blockers had been discontinued, however the withdrawal syndrome occurred in one instance only. One female patient presented signs of CAD, the other hypokalemia. Resumption of treatment with the same beta blocker promptly caused the symptoms to disappear. The pathogenesis of the withdrawal syndrome still being obscure, various postulates are raised in respect of beta blocker therapy.", 
    "37": "The importance of cardioselectivity and membrane depressant activity in the ability of beta-adrenergic antagonists to limit myocardial infarct size was assessed in the dog. Infarction was produced by a 60 min occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery followed by reperfusion into a critical stenosis. Infarct size was significantly reduced by atenolol, nadolol and propranolol. Thus, limitations of infarct size by beta-adrenergic antagonists occur with agents which possess or lack cardiac selectivity or membrane depressant activity.", 
    "38": "Treatment with yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenergic blocker, prior to the injection of a subdiabetogenic dose of streptozotocin (STZ) produced hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia in mice 7 days later. Prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker, was ineffective. The capacity of phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine to potentiate the diabetogenic effect of STZ was intermediate between that of yohimbine and prazosin. Propranolol and hexamethonium inhibited the potentiating action of yohimbine. Yohimbine enhanced the potentiating effect of isoproterenol on the STZ-induced diabetes. Acute changes in phase glucose and insulin levels induced by STZ were potentiated by yohimbine but not by prazosin. The insulin releasing ability of the pancreatic islets 7 days after STZ was all but lost in mice pretreated with yohimbine but not with prazosin. These results suggest that the beta- and alpha 2-, not alpha 1-adrenergic system which modulates insulin release from pancreatic islets influences the response to the diabetogenic action of STZ in mice.", 
    "39": "We have studied some central and peripheral hormones in patients suffering from severe head injury. There exists a significant increase in plasma noradrenaline at the beginning of the apallic syndrome and the values remained raised until the reintegration of the neurological symptomatic set in. Besides there exists a decreased stimulation of growth hormone (HGH) excretion after arginine infusion at different stages of the treatment. Testosterone, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) show lowered values, even though they can be stimulated. The cause of these restrictions in hormonal function may be a direct disturbance of diencephalic-hypophyseal regulation. The influence of the hormones on metabolism and symptomatic therapy of these central dysregulations is also discussed.", 
    "40": "In cerebellum, the evoked responses of the Purkinje cell to both excitatory and inhibitory afferent input have previously been shown to be enhanced by local iontophoresis of norepinephrine (NE). The influence of locus coeruleus (LC) conditioning stimulation on Purkinje cell responses to climbing fiber input was examined to determine whether endogenous NE, released from synaptic terminals, could exert similar potentiative effects. Stimulation of LC, at intensities which by themselves were subthreshold for directly affecting background activity, markedly enhanced complex spike excitation of Purkinje cells elicited by activation of climbing fiber inputs from sensorimotor cortex. Depressant responses observed after complex spike excitation were also augmented by the LC conditioning. Iontophoretic application of sotalol, a specific beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, reversibly antagonized this facilitation of climbing fiber-evoked responses. In addition, the potentiative effects of LC stimulation were not observed after destruction of NE-containing axons and terminals in cerebellum by 6-OHDA. These results suggest that noradrenergic input from the LC can enhance the efficacy of climbing fiber synaptic action on the Purkinje cell, and are thus consistent with the hypothesis of a 'modulatory' role rather than a specific information transfer function for NE in cerebellum.", 
    "41": "The antihypertensive effect of acebutolol 400 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in combination have been assessed in 22 patients with mild, moderate and severe hypertension. In the supine position, blood pressure went down from an average of 190/116 mm Hg to 147/91 mm Hg after treatment, while in the standing position, blood pressure went down from an average of 188/117 mm Hg to 143/94 mm Hg. Age, sex and duration of hypertension have no significant influence upon the antihypertensive effect of this combination. Good results were obtained in 68% of the patients, fair results in 23% and poor results in another 9%. Compared with the use of acebutolol alone, its combination with hydrochlorothiazide showed better results. In mild hypertension good results increased from 75% after acebutolol only to 100% after this combination. In moderate hypertension the percentage of good results increases from 47% to 60% and in severe hypertension good results increased from 50% to 67%. Increase of decrease in heart rate had no relation to the antihypertensive effect of this combination.", 
    "42": "Beta-blockers are now well established treatment for hypertension. The prognosis of CVD is influenced by the presence of hypertension and coronary artery disease; both have an effect on cerebral perfusion pressure. Acebutolol was compared with oxprenolol in the treatment of 17 CVD patients with hypertension of long standing, 14 of whom had cardiac abnormalities and 16 retired abnormalities. Both drugs produced satisfactory lowering of blood pressure and there was no significant difference between their hypotensive effects. No adverse neurological complications occurred during treatment with either drug. Side-effects, CNS and gastrointestinal, of oxprenolol treatment were more frequent than with acebutolol. One patient receiving oxprenolol suffered bronchospasm. Both drugs produced a beneficial effect on neurological deficit.", 
    "43": "Acebutolol is a relatively \"cardioselective\" beta-adrenergic blocking agent with an antihypertensive action. The aims of this investigation were to establish the effective dosage range, to study the effect on supine, standing and exercise blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), and to compare the efficacy of once daily (OM) with twice daily (BD) dosing of acebutolol. This was a within patient, double-blind, randomised study. This study shows that the optimum dosage of acebutolol for control of BP and heart rate is 400mg or more daily, and that OM dosing seems to be as effective as BD dosing for supine, standing and post exercise BP control, but is less so for heart rate control.", 
    "44": "Several drugs are known to interfere in thyroid hormone metabolism: 1) They can affect directly and specifically T4 to T3 conversion. This can be observed in vivo and in vitro. In vivo serum T3 concentrations will decrease and rT3 concentrations increase. Amiodarone, other iodinated compounds (cholecystographic agents: ipodate and iopanoic acid), propylthiouracil and propranolol are known to act in this way. 2) Other drugs which induce the hepatic capacity to catabolize drugs will also affect thyroid hormone metabolism, e.g. diphenylhydantoine. Clinically, inhibitors of conversion will increase serum total and free T4, however this finding per se does not proof hyperthyroidism as in some cases serum TSH will increase after i.v. injection of 400 micrograms TRH. Furthermore the increase in serum T4 can be explained in part by a low metabolic clearance rate, T4 production being barely increased.", 
    "45": "It has been demonstrated that most hypertensive drugs which cause increases in levels of norepinephrine influence the stimulation of monosynaptic reflex (MSR) neural activity. However this report discusses the effects of a hypotensive drug, which causes decreases in levels of norepinephrine, on the MSR amplitude of acute spinal cats. This drug is 5-butylpicolinic acid (fusaric acid: FA) which is an effective hypotensive agent and a potent inhibitor of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (approximately 10 times more potent than disurfiram). Intravenous injections of FA increased MSR neural activity in a dose-dependent manner. The FA-induced neural activity was gradually depressed by treatment with haloperidol, a dopamine and/or a alpha receptor blocker and methysergide, a serotonin receptor blocker, respectively. In addition, this neural activity was potentiated by the sequential administration of L-dopa. FA did not cause increases in the blood pressure but inhibit the synthesis of norepinephrine from dopamine. These results suggest that not only hypertensive but also hypotensive drugs can affect the increase of MSR neural activity, and dopamine plays an important role in FA-induced neural activity.", 
    "46": "Cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) of varied clinical use were screened to determine their capacity to alter the pattern of labeling with 32Pi of cerebral cortex mince phospholipids. The altered phospholipid labeling patterns were qualitatively similar, the prominent features being reduced incorporation into phosphatidylcholine and increased incorporation into phosphatidic acid. Relative potencies were: (/-+)-propranolol greater than chlorpromazine = 4,4'-bis(diethylaminoethoxy) alpha,beta-diethyldiphenylethane greater than desipramine greater than dibucaine greater than pimozide greater than oxymetazoline = fenfluramine = haloperidol = chloroquine greater than amphetamine = no drug added. Propranolol was used to study the action of CADs further. Its effect was time- and dose-dependent but in contrast with pineal gland, no label appeared in phosphatidyl-CMP (CDP-diacylglycerol), nor did dialysis of the mince to reduce diffusible substrates or exogenous addition of substrates cause appearance of liponucleotide. Thus lack of diffusible precursors is not responsible for CAD effects in vitro. Pulse-chase experiments with 32Pi and [2-3H]glycol suggested that inhibition of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase may be partly responsible for the observed alterations in phospholipid labeling in the presence of CADs.", 
    "47": "Factors that modify carotid vascular baroreflexes were studied in anesthetized rabbits after section of the cervical aortic nerves. We recorded steady-state reflex responses of heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to changes in isolated nonpulsatile carotid intrasinus pressures (ISP) over a wide range. These measurements and the procedures were repeated 1) after sympathetic denervation of the carotid sinuses by section of the cervical sympathetic nerve below the superior cervical ganglia; 2) after cervical vagotomy; and 3) after beta-receptor blockade by propranolol administration. The linearity of the MAP-ISP relation curve slope was determined between ISP levels of 63 and 100 mmHg. Comparison of results before and after sympathetic denervation of the sinuses indicated that the denervation significantly lowered the position of the MAP-ISP relation curve over a mid-ISP range. Subsequent vagotomy significantly elevated both HR-ISP relation curve and MAP-ISP relation curve. AFter beta-receptor blockade HR remained constant, whereas the slope of the MAP-ISP relation curve decreased to -1.34 from the slope of -2.26 before blockade. Comparison of results before and after beta blockade in the vagotomized animals suggested a substantial cardiac influence on carotid reflex control of MAP."
