The acrodermatitis healed completely on zinc therapy and parallel to this improvement the hypertension could easily be controlled with a gradually decreased antihypertensive drug dosage.", 
    "1": "1. Metoprolol was metabolized in rat liver microsomes in vitro by O-demethylation with subsequent oxidation and by aliphatic hydroxylation of the methoxy-ethyl substituent and by oxidative deamination of the propanolisopropylamine side-chain. The same routes of metabolism in the rat in vivo were revealed from urinary metabolites. Eight metabolites were identified by g.l.c.-mass spectrometry by comparison with synthetized reference compounds. 2. Metoprolol binds to cytochrome-P-450 eliciting a type I difference spectrum with KS = 23 +/- 2-0 muM. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant Km = 39 +/- 4-0 muM and Vmax = 1-28 +/- 0-22 nmol/mg protein X min were not significantly affected by pre-treatment of the rats with metoprolol or phenobarbital. Metoprolol pre-treatment had no effect on the cytochrome-P-450 level in the microsomes nor on the rate of metabolism of four standard substrates. Phenobarbital increased the cytochrome P-450 as expected. 3. Four metabolites representing the three main routes of metabolism were quantitatively determined after metabolism with rat liver microsomes and compared with the urinary levels of the same compounds. The same major metabolites were found in vitro and in vivo. The total amount of metabolites was not influenced by pre-treatment with metoprolol or phenobarbital. The relative amounts of the three main metabolites were slightly affected by pre-treatment.", 
    "2": "Electrical stimulation of the ventro-medial hypothalamus of the rabbit elevated plasma glycerol concentration. This elevation was suppressed by treatments of the animals with hexamethonium and propranolol, or by adrenalectomy, but was not suppressed by treatments with atropine and phentolamine. These results would indicate that the effect of electrical stimulation of ventro-medial hypothalamus is mainly mediated by catecholamine(s) liberated from the adrenal medulla and acts on beta-receptor of adipose tissue.", 
    "3": "Human airways, from the middle of the trachea to the distal bronchi, were studied in vitro for the presence of inhibitory nerves. The tissue was obtained from operations and from recent autopsies. Electrical field stimulation of the tissues demonstrated cholinergic, excitatory nerves and their effect was blocked by atropine. Field stimulation of the tissues, in the presence of atropine, relaxed the smooth muscle even when the muscle was contracted by histamine. The field stimulation-induced relaxation was neither blocked nor modified by adrenergic blocking agents. Maximum relaxation of the bronchial muscle was obtained with a pulse duration of 1-2 ms, 70 V, and frequencies of 20 Hz and greater. The tracheal smooth muscle showed 85% of maximal relaxation with a frequency of 10 Hz. Tetrodotoxin, blocked the field stimulation-induced relaxation for pulse durations of 2 ms; this indicated that nerves were being stimulated. The airway system shows some of the characteristics of the nonadrenergic inhibitory system in the gastrointestinal tract and of the system reported in the guinea pig trachealis muscle. No evidence of adrenergic inhibitory fibers was found in the bronchial muscle with either pharmacological or histochemical techniques. These findings suggest that the nonadrenergic inhibitory system is the principal inhibitory system for the smooth muscle of human airways. We suggest that a defect in the airway system, such as that shown in the gastrointestinal tract, may be an explanation for the hyperreactive airways of asthma and chronic bronchitis.", 
    "4": "l-Propranolol was found to protect mice from hyperbaric oxygen-induced seizures. The disposition of effective doses of propranolol isomers in mice was followed using stereospecific antibodies with a radioimmunoassay procedure. Serum and tissue concentrations were determined and correlated with the protective effect. Following racemic administration, there were no differences in serum disposition of d- and l-propranolol, although there was initially a preferential uptake of the 1-isomer both into cardiac and brain tissue. The d-isomer exerted synergistic action on the 1-isomer protective effect.", 
    "5": "The effect of a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, BL-3459, on adrenaline-induced myocardial necrosis was investigated in beagle dogs. BL-3459, an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine, and a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, propranolol, were compared for their ability to modify the effects of adrenaline on platelet function, arterial blood pressure and myocardial damage. Adrenaline infusion led to a dose-related myocardial damage, elevation in arterial blood pressure, elevation in screen filtration pressure (SFP) and fall in platelet count. BL-3459 inhibited the elevation in SFP and the fall in platelet count as well as limiting the extent of myocardial damage. Phenoxybenzamine significantly modified all adrenaline-induced changes except the elevation in SFP. Propranolol had little effect alone and seemed to antagonize the beneficial effects of BL-3459 when the two drugs were combined. These results suggest that while other factors may also be involved, platelet aggregation and transient hypertension are correlated with the extent of adrenaline-induced myocardial necrosis observed in this model. A potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, BL-3459, and the alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine, appear to afford protection against the observed pathological effects.", 
    "6": "The effects of d,1-alpha-methyltyrosine (alphaMT), haloperidol, phenoxybenazmine, propranolol, methysergide and cyproheptadine on the anorexigenic activities of DITA and d-amphetamine were studied in male mice. The pretreatment of mice with methysergide (10 mg/kg, s.c.), cyproheptadine (5 mg/kg, i.p.), phenoxybenzamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), and propranolol (5 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to alter the anorexigenic effect of DITA and d-amphetamine. On the other hand, alphaMT (32 mg/kg, i.p.) and haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly antagonized the anorexigenic effect of DITA and d-amphetamine. Our data indicate that the anorexigenic activities of DITA and d-amphetamine are mediated mainly through the dopaminergic system.", 
    "7": "Using a food-reinforced two-lever operant method, rats (n=5) could be trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg cocaine from saline. Stimulus generalization experiments with lower doses (0.31-5.0 mg/kg) revealed that the cocaine cue is a dose-related phenomenon. Neuroleptic drugs were found relatively ineffective as possible antagonists of the cocaine cue, and no antagonistic effect whatsoever was obtained with dibenamine, propranolol, cyproheptadine and methysergide. iamphetamine (1.25 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0.31 mg/kg) were generalized with cocaine, and a dopaminergic involvement is discussed.", 
    "8": "Verapamil (Isoptin) caused a dose-dependent peripheral vasodilation, increase in myocardial contractility, and tachycardia in the anaesthetized dog. Propranolol pretreatment blocked the cardiac stimulation following verapamil but the vasodilation was unaltered. Inflation of a thoracic aortic balloon prevented the fall in intravascular pressure and reduced the tachycardia and positive inotropic responses. These experiments suggest that clinical doses of verapamil cause peripheral vasodilation which leads to a sympathetic reflex induced increase in heart rate and myocardial contractility. Verapamil also had a direct myocardial depressant action which became evident at doses above the range used clinically. The drug increased the PR interval in conscious dogs for up to 60 minutes. This effect was partly mediated through cholinergic stimulation and partly through a direct depression on atrioventricular conduction.", 
    "9": "1 Anorexia in rats following injections of mazindol (0.1-8 mg/kg i.p.) could be antagonized by pretreatment with a dopamine receptor blocker (primozide) but not by pretreatment with an alpha-adrenoceptor blocker (phenoxybenzamine), a beta-adrenoceptor blocker ((-)-propranolol), or a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor blocker (methergoline). 2 In rats with a unilateral lesion in the substantia nigra made by stereotaxic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine, mazindol caused a dose-dependent turning towards the lesioned side, indicating an indirect mechanism of action. This effect could be antagonized by pretreatment with a dopamine receptor blocker. 3 In rats pretreated with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, mazindol did not have any motor stimulant action. 4 In vitro studies with synaptosomes prepared from rat brain, indicated that mazindol blocks uptake and causes release of dopamine. 5 It is concluded that the anorectic action of mazindol is mediated by a dopaminergic mechanism.", 
    "10": "1 The inhibitory effect of gallamine (1.1 muM-1.1 mM) on negative inotropic responses to acetylcholine (ACh) or carbachol (CCh) was investigated in isolated electrically stimulated atria of the guinea-pig. Gallamine caused parallel rightward shifts of the dose-response curves to the agonists, with no depression of the maximal response. 2 Gallamine (0.11 - 1.1 mM) produced a greater degree of antagnism towards CCh than towards ACh. With either agonist, the degree of antagonism produced by gallamine in high concentrations was less than that expected for a competitive antagonist.. 3 Similar findings were made when either negative inotropic or chronotropic responses were recorded in spontaneously beating guinea-pig atria. The inhibitory effect of gallamine against the negative inotropic response to cholinomimetics in electrically stimulated atria was not altered either in the presence of propranol (17 muM) or in atria obtained from guinea-pigs pretreated with diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DEP) 12.5 mumol/kg, in divided doses over 3 days). 4 When ACh was used as the agonist, combination of gallamine with atropine (0.05-0.4 muM) produced dose-ratios which were less than expected for combination of two competitive antagonists. The same phenomenon was observed in atria obtained from guinea-pigs pretreated with DFP. 5 It is suggested that the antagonism produced by gallamine is a type of non-competitive inhibition, which has been termed \"metaffinoid antagonism\". An antagonist of this type allosterically alters the affinity of the agonist for its binding site, rather than changing the effectiveness of the agonist-receptor interaction.", 
    "11": "A 3-hr glucose tolerance test was performed in 12 thyrotoxic patients before and after propranolol treatment for 30 days (120 mg/day). Plasma glucose, free fatty acid, insulin, and growth hormone levels were determined on each test and compared to each other and against nine clinically healthy volunteers. In eight thyrotoxic patients (subgroup A) an improvement in carbohydrate tolerance was observed after propranolol treatment, along with a fall in the previously elevated fasting FFA; no change in plasma insulin levels was observed. Plasma growth hormone levels were higher than normal both before and after propranolol; however, a 46% glucose-induced suppression was seen in both instances. In the other four patients (subgroup B) (who had had a marked and rapid weight loss) a deterioration of the previously normal glucosnificant changes in insulin levels. Elevated fasting plasma free fatty acids remained so despite propranolol treatment. Plasma growth hormone was higher than normal before and after propranolol; a late suppression (at 120 min) and no suppression at all were seen, respectively. After propranolol treatment, subgroup B had higher plasma free fatty acid than subgroup A in the fasting state and at 30 and 180 min. It is proposed that the improvement or deterioration in carbohydrate tolerance after propranolol treatment might be related to whether or not a satisfactory propranolol-induced lipolytic blockade is achieved, leading to a decrease in plasma free fatty acid levels, improved insulin sensitivity, and better peripheral glucose utilization. Therefore, a uniform dose of propranolol will not always be sufficient to obtain adequate lipolytic blockade, particularly if the thyrotoxic patient has had a marked and rapid weight loss.", 
    "12": "Old constant estrous and young cycling control rats were injected with L-dopa, 200 mg/kg, for a period of 14 days. L-Dopa reinstated vaginal cycling in the old rats and it did not affect the vaginal cycling in young rats. Likewise, 200 mg/kg of L-tyrosine reinstated vaginal cycling. The effect of L-dopa on old rats was blocked by pimozide, by high doses of MK-486 and Ro 4-4602, and by fusaric acid. High doses of phenoxybenzamine or L-propranolol did not alter the L-dopa effect on old rats. A low dose of MK-486 or Ro 4-4602 increased the efficacy of L-dopa in reinstating vaginal cycling. These results suggest that L-dopa reinstates vaginal cycling in old rats by stimulating dopamine receptors. The possibility that a simultaneous stimulation of norepinephrine alpha and beta receptors and/or a decrease of central nervous system serotonin is necessary for this effect is discussed.", 
    "13": "The case is described of a patient who presented with the characteristic symptoms and signs of sclerosing peritonitis due to practolol therapy. The clinical features, operative findings, and management are discussed.", 
    "14": "Renal artery thrombosis or embolism associated with the use of an umbilical arterial catheter can cause renin-dependent hypertension in the neonate. The tip of the catheter should therefore be kept well below the origin of the renal arteries and the infant's blood pressure monitored. Moreover, since the pressor hypertension may be transient and kidney function may return, a period of medical management should be attempted before proceeding to nephrectomy.", 
    "15": "The effects of the dimethyl quarternary analog of propranolol, UM-272, on myocardial infarct volume were studied in the canine heart. Myocardial infarction was produced by occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion and quantitation of infarct volume 24 hours later. Groups of dogs were either untreated or pretreated with UM-272 with an initial loading dose of 5.0 mg/kg (group A) or 2.5 mg/kg (group B) 30 minutes before occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery. Both group A and group B animals received additional doses of 2.5 mg/kg of UM-272 every 90 minutes for a period of 6 hours so that the total respective doses were 15 and 12.5 mg/kg. Control animals received comparable volumes of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. All animals were followed throughout the 6-hour procedure with continuous electrocardiographic recordings which were used to assess the effects of acute myocardial ischemia upon disturbances in cardiac rhythm and the effects of drug treatment. Dogs which survived the procedure were given tetracycline i.v. the next day and sacrificed 1 hour later by an overdose of pentobarbital sodium. The hearts were removed and the left ventricle was sliced and examined first under ultraviolet light to localize the ischemic zone by noting the tetracycline fluorescence. The ventricular slices were next incubated in nitro blue tetrazolium which stains normal myocardial tissue, thus allowing one to quantitate the volume of infarcted myocardium by excising and weighing the nonstained and stained muscle separately. The untreated control group had an infarct volume of 23.8 +/- 3.2 g/100 g of left ventricle. The treated animals in groups A and B had respective infarct volumes of 2.3 +/- 0.8 g/100 g (P less than .001) and 7.0 +/- 3.3 g/100 g (P less than .025) of left ventricle. During the acute phase of ischemia and reperfusion, arrhythmias and alterations in the ST-segment, R-wave amplituted and development of pathologic Q-waves were more prominent in the untreated animals and almost totally absent in the treated animals. UM-272 produced a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate as well as a decrease in developed isometric tension. Pretreatment with UM-272 did not prevent the derangement of function in the ischemic zone nor did it permit a return of function upon reperfusion, even though it reduced the degree of cellular damage resulting from 60 minutes of regional ischemia. A possible mechanism for the protective effect of UM-272 may be through its ability to reduce myocardial contractility and heart rate, both of which would reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and thus produce a more favorable balance between myocardial oxygen supply and myocardial oxygen demand.", 
    "16": "A model for the intravenous administration of propranolol by a bolus-infusion technique designed to rapidly produce, then maintain, predicted plasma drug concentrations was derived from elimination kinetics in single-dose studies. Prospective testing of this model in 6 adult male subjects revealed a close correlation between predicted and observed drug levels; desired plasma concentrations were achieved within 5 min and maintained over the 30-min study period. By subtracting previously given bolus doses from the dose calculated as needed to produce a desired plasma level, progressive increases in predicted propranolol levels could be effected, with apparent maintenance of equilibrium. Correlations between the bolus doses and infusion rates and the plasma drug levels were consistent and significant, and constitute nomograms from which the dose of drug required to produce a desired plasma level may be approximated. The clearance of propranolol declined slightly as the drug plasma level increased, but did not significantly affect the accuracy of the model.", 
    "17": "An antibody reacting with the plasma membrane of working myocardial cells, skeletal muscle fibres, and endothelial cells (EVI antibody) has been described in the sera of patients with Chagas' disease. In the present study of rat isolated atrial preparations beating in ddifferent media, direct immunofluorescence and ultrastructural immunohistochemical procedures indicate that the antibody can interact with the living tissue, becoming fixed to the plasma membranes. Transmission electronmicroscopy studies also showed the presence of sarcolemmal alterations. These observations suggest a possible pathogenic effect of the EVI antibody. The presence of EVI-positive sera in the beating medium leads to a significant increase in the frequency of contractions; no significant effects of EVI-positive sera in contractile force were seen. The increase in frequency could be prevented by previous treatment with a b-adrenergic blocking agent (MJ-1999), but not by an x-blocker (phentolamine) or by an anti-histamine compound (cyproheptadine). The changes described were observed only in those atrial preparations which were beating in media containing EVI-positive sera. In those atria beating in control media (KR,KR plus normal human serum, KR plus EVI-negative chagasic serum), neither immunological nor morphological or functional changes wersence of EVI-positive chagasic serum diminished atrial stimulation after added norepinephrine. These results suggest the possibility that the EVI antibody may act as a b-adrenergic agonist at the cell plasma membrane level. Such an effect might account for some of the clinical features of chronic Chagas' heart disease.", 
    "18": "Electrophysiological studies were made on microcultures (300-500 mum in diameter) in which solitary sympathetic principal neurons from newborn rats grew on previously dissociated rat heart cells. Some neurons inhibited,some excited, and others first inhibited and then excited the cardiac myocytes. Application of drugs provided evidence for secretion of acetylcholine by the first group, catecholamines by the second, and both acetylcholine and catecholamines by the third. Solitary neurons which inhibited themyocytes usually excited themselves at nicotinic synapses (autapses).", 
    "19": "Noradrenaline as well as the indirectly acting amines tyramine and phenethylamine either enhance or inhibit the twitch response of the transmurally stimulated, isolated guine-pig vas deferens, thus partly confirming previous reports. In both cases enhancement is annulled by alpha-adrenoceptor blockers. The twitch inhibition caused by noradrenaline is abolished by alpha- + beta2-adrenoceptor blockers, but not by either blocker alone. The inhibition caused by the indirectly acting amines is largely abolished by alpha-adrenoceptor blockers. Clonidine strongly inhibits the twitch. This effect if promptly removed by phentolamine. After blockade of the neurally induced twitch by tetrodotoxin, noradrenaline and the indirectly acting amines have no effect or slightly enhance the twitch elicited by transmural stimulation of the smooth muscle. It is concluded that exogenous noradrenaline acts on postjunctional stimulatory alpha-adrenoceptors and on inhibitory alpha- and beta2-adrenoceptors, which are presumably prejunctional. In the unstimulated preparation contracted by acetylcholine, noradrenaline causes further contraction which is changed into relaxation after phentolamine. This relaxation is abolished by butoxamine, suggesting that noradrenaline may also act on inhibitory postjunctional beta2-adrenoceptors. The twitch-inhibiting effect of endogenous noradrenaline, released by nerve stimulation or by indirectly acting amines, appears to be primarily mediated by prejunctional alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "20": "Earlier investigations of sympathomimetic drugs overcoming the amnesic action of cycloheximide (CXM) in day-old chickens were extended to biochemical studies in vitro. The effects of amphetamine, norepinephrine, alpha and beta noradrenergic stimulants and receptor blockers on Na+/K+ ATP'ase activity in total homogenate of chicken forebrain were investigated. Norepinephrine and the beta stimulant, isoprenaline significantly stimulated the activity of this enzyme, while the beta blocker, propranolol inhibited activity. Amphetamine, the alpha stimulant, methoxamine and the alpha receptor blocker, piperoxane had no effect on Na/K+ ATP'ase activity in total homogenate. In a purified synaptosomal preparation, both amphetamine (5 X 10(-5) M) and norepinephrine (1 X 10(-4) M) produced a slight stimulation of Na+/K+ ATP'ase activity. A similar concentration of amphetamine (1.12 X 10(-4) M) did not inhibit 14C-leucine uptake or incorporation into protein in the synaptosomal fraction. Nor was it able to alleviate CXM inhibition of 14C-leucine incorporation into synaptosomal protein. The results are interpreted in terms of amphetamine (via release of norepinephrine) norepinephrine and isoprenaline stimulating and maintaining the labile, sodium pump-dependent, phase of memory formation for a sufficient length of time until protein synthesis inhibition by CXM wears off.", 
    "21": "32 patients were studied by His-bundle-electrocardiogram and programmed atrial stimulation to examine to which extent frequency and autonomic tone participate in influencing the effective (ERP) and functional (FRP) refractory periods of the atrium and AV-node. The measurements were performed during three electrically induced atrial frequencies before and after intravenous injection of 1 mg Atropine (15 patients) and 0.4 mg Visken (17 patients). For the atrium, frequency dominates the blockade of both components of the autonomic nervous system in influencing both refractory periods. Increase in frequency shortens both ERP and FRP of the atriu. The blockade of parasympathicus and sympathicus does not significantly influence the changes in atrial ERP and FRP induced by atrial pacing. The AV-node responses most sensitive to both pacing induced cycle length shortening and blockade of the autonomic tone. Cycle length shortening prolongs the nodal ERP. the FRP is either shortened or prolonged. Blockade of the parasympathicus shortens both nodal ERP and FRP. Blockade of the sympathicus lengthens both parameters. This behaviour of both refractory periods in response to atrial pacing and blockade of the autonomic tone are discussed with respect to the \"gate mechanism\" in the conduction system. In the majority of patients blockade of the parasympathicus shifts the \"gate\" from the AV-node to the atrium. Blockade of the sympathicus has the opposite effect in some cases.", 
    "22": "32 patients were studied by His-bundle recordings to examine the extent to which frequency and autonomic nervous system influence the conduction velocity in the subdivisions (atrium, AV-node, His-Purkinje system) of the normal PR-interval. The measurements were performed during sinus rhythm and three electrically induced atrial frequencies before and after intravenous administration of 1 mg Atropine (15 patients) and 0.4 mg Visken (17 patients). In influencing the atrial conduction velocity frequency dominates the blockade of both components of the autonomic nervous system. Increase in frequency lengthens the intraatrial conduction time. Blockade of parasympathicus and sympathicus does not significantly influence the changes in intraatrial conduction velocity induced by increase of frequency. Patients with prolonged intraatrial conduction respond in the same way to cycle length shortening and blockade of the autonomic tone as patients with normal conduction. The results are discussed with respect to acetylcholine and catecholamine influence on the electrophysiological properties of the atrial myocardium. The AV-node is the part of the conduction system most sensitive to the influence of both cycle length shortening and blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Artificially induced cycle length shortening prolongs the intranodal conduction time to a different individual level for each patient. Blockade of the parasympathicus not only shortens this interval but also reduces the steepness of the AH-time induced by atrial pacing. Blockade of the sympathicus has the opposite effect. The most likely explanation for these results is the abolishing of the functional dissociation within the AV-node by blocking the autonomic influence on this structure. The conduction velocity in the His-Purkinje system is influenced neither by atrial pacing nor by blockade of both components of the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "23": "It was the aim of this study to test whether the non-specific pharmacological activities of the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs can be predicted by estimation of the hydrophobicity of the compounds. Srong correlations were obtained between the octanol buffer partition coefficients and the ability of the drugs to decrease conduction velocity of the isolated frog heart, to raise the electrically induced ventricular fibrillation threshold in guinea pigs, and to depress ventricular contractility in the cat. The strong correlations between the partition coefficients and the pharmacological actions suggest that estimation of the hydrophobicity of the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs is suitable to predict the non-specific pharmacological properties.", 
    "24": "In a controlled double-blind cross-over trial in 10 patients comprising six with open-angle glaucoma, three with closed-angle glaucoma, and one with ocular hypertension, a single oral dose of atenolol (50 mg) was significantly more effective than propranolol (40 mg) in reducing ocular tension.", 
    "25": "Sustained, 60-minute perfusion of glibenclamide (0.5, 1.5 and 10 mug/ml) elicits a one-phase insulin release profile, formed by a rapid secretion peak followed by a second peak with lower insulin levels than the former. Basal insulin secretion values are observed during the period comprised between 13 and 60 minutes of perfusion. Concurrent stimulation with glucose (100, 150, 200 and 300 mg%) plus glibenclamide (1 mug/ml) causes a marked rise in both phases of insulin secretion. The addition of glibenclamide does not modify the biphasic secretion pattern caused by maximal glucose concentration (400 mg%). The maximal values of both phases of secretion in the dose-response curve elicited by different glucose concentrations shift to the left when glibenclamide is added to the perfusate. The increase in insulin secretion caused by glibenclamide is not inhibited by puromycin. Both theophylline and phentolamine modify and increase the glibenclamide-induced insulin release pattern. Propranolol and imidazole inhibit glibenclamide-induced insulin release. Our results suggest that: 1. Glibenclamide increases beta cell sensitivity to glucose stimulation. 2. Glibenclamide and glucose induce secretion of insulin originating in the same compartment. 3. Modification of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors may modify glibodulate the beta cell response to glibenclamide.", 
    "26": "The actions of sympathomimetics and of catecholamine antagonists have been investigated on the membrane potential and responses to nerve stimulation of acinar cells of the salivary gland of Nauphoeta cinerea Olivier. 2. Hyperpolarizations such as those evoked by nerve stimulation and by low concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine were not produced by the alpha-agonists amidephrine and methoxamine. Isoprenaline was active, but only in concentrations above 100 muM. 3. Tyramine, an indirectly acting sympathomimetic, and high concentrations of methoxamine caused an increase in the rate of the small transient hyperpolarizations sometimes seen in the absence of stimulation. 4. The response to nerve stimulation was unaffected by propranolol (20 muM) an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, reduced matching responses to nerve stimulation and to dopamine to about the same extent. 5. As on other systems responsive to low concentrations of dopamine, apomorphine was active, although only in high concentration, and ergometrine and methysergide were antagonistic both to nerve stimulation and to dopamine.", 
    "27": "The effects of morphine and pethidine upon body temperature and upon the reversal of reserpine hypothermia in the mouse were investigated. Both morphine and pethidine produced a dose-dependent fall in body temperature, that of morphine being totally antagonized by nalorphine and partially by naloxone, while that of pethidine was antagonised by naloxone and enhanced by nalorphine. Both drugs reversed reserpine-induced hypothermia. The reversal by morphine, but not by pethidine, was partially antagonized by naloxone. Adrenalectomy prevented the reversal of reserpine hypothermia by pethidine but morphine produced a partial reversal. Ganglion blockade and alpha-and beta-blockade all prevented reversal of reserpine hypothermia by both drugs. The results are discussed with regard to differences between pethidine and morphine and possible involvement of opiate receptors.", 
    "28": "The antiarrhythmic activity of a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent, 6-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropyloxy)-benzothiazole succinate (KF-577), was compared with that of propranolol. KF-577 antagonized ouabain-induced arrhythmias in normal and bilaterally vagotomized guinea pigs; its antagonistic activity was equal to that of propranolol. Reserpinization greatly reduced ouabain intoxication and neither of the two beta-blockers produced further reduction. Aconitine-induced arrhythmias in rats were not antagonized by the two agents. In intact guinea pigs, the reduction of ouabain intoxication by both beta-blockers could not exceed that produced by simulataneous infusion of KCl, and vice versa. In isolated guinea pig atria, propranolol was about 10 times more effective than KF-577 in reducing the ouabain intoxication. The antiaarhythmic activity of KF-577 paralleled its beta-blocking activity in the isolated preparations but not in the intact animals.", 
    "29": "Previous studies on the interaction of labeled beta-adrenergic blockers with beta-adrenergic receptors have employed broken cell or membrane preparations. We have now carried out direct binding analysis on intact turkey erythrocytes employing the potent, high specific activity blocker [125I]-hydroxbenzylpindolol (HYP). [125I]HYP binds to a single class of receptor sites with a K of 5.3 X 10(10)M-1 and a binding capacity of 400-500 sites/cell. These results as well as the kinetics of association and dissociation and lack of evidence for negative cooperativity all agree well with studies reported earlier on membrane preparations from the same cells. True dissociation constants (Kd) for agonists and antagonists determined by inhibition of binding of [125I]HYP are in good agreement with results in membrane preparations. These Kd's have been compared directly with activation or inhibition constants for effects on adenylate cyclase using generation of [14C]cAMP from [14C]adenine in intact cells. The close correlation between effects on binding and adenylate cyclase activity in whole cells are similar to results obtained in membrane preparations in the presence of guanine nucleotides, suggesting the presence of an analogous regulatory substance in vivo.", 
    "30": "Pre-existing disease in the form of hypertension or ischaemic heart disease may increase morbidity and mortality in patients presenting for anaesthesia and surgery. The interaction of these two cardiovascular conditions in relation to anaesthesia has been studied in a series of 115 patients. The results did not support the view that antihypertensive drugs and beta-receptor blocking agents should be withdrawn before anaesthesia and surgery. The main cause for concern in providing anaesthesia for these patients is that sympathetic nervous activation induced either by anaesthetic manoeuvres or by surgical stimulation may lead to reflex cardiovascular responses which, by increasing myocardial oxygen demand, lead to episodes of myocardial ischaemia. In this respect beta-receptor blocking drugs appear to have a protective effect on the ischaemic myocardium.", 
    "31": "A new system is proposed for treating the spectrum of patients with high blood pressure. It is based on studies of the renin axis using renin profiling, pharmacologic probes and our bipolar vasoconstriction-volume hypothesis. The new system does not require renin profiling, pharmacologic testing or a vasoconstriction-volume analysis for widespread application. But these procedures, whenever available, will make treatment more efficient and more certain, and at the same time provide better base line definition. In the new system, all patients, except the elderly and those with congestive heart failure, bradycardia or a history of asthma, are treated first with propranolol alone, a procedure which will diminish or normalize blood pressure in many patients with high and noraml renin levels. For nonresponders, diuretic therapy is then superimposed. Subsequently, a propranolol subtraction trial picks out the low-renin patients who will usually respond to a diuretic alone. This program is likely to be fully effective in possible up to 85 per cent of patients. For the residual smaller fraction, drugs such as hydralazine, methyl DOPA, clonidine, reserpine or guanethidine are then added in traditional trial and error fashion. The proposed system has the theoretic attraction for long-term commitment, implicit in antihypertensive therapy, of achieving blood pressure control in large fractions with one drug instead of two or with two drugs instead of three or more. Moreover, the large groups who respond to therapy with propranolol alone (most high-renin and normal-renin patients) or to diuretics alone (most low-renin patients) gain the advantage of simple, more specific, long-term (i.e., antirenin or antivolume) therapy. The use of propranolol alone has practical and theoretic advantages over diuretics. Control may be achieved with even fewer side effects and without hypokalemia and chronic dehydration with its possibly adverse consequences (hyperuricemia, azotemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperreninemia, increased blood viscosity). Also, propranolol provides more direct control of the increased peripheral resistance and of neurogenically-induced swings in blood pressure. At the same time, the new system efficiently exploits the long-term use of diuretic therapy alone in low-renin patients in whom volume excess seems a causal factor. And it tends to avoid the use of diuretics in high-renin patients and of beta-blockers in low-renin patients in whom these drug types may be contraindicated.", 
    "32": "Eleven beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents and derivatives were evaluated for their ability to affect systolic arterial blood pressure and pulse rate in unanesthetized, male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) controls. Animals ranged from 7 to 76 weeks of age. The subcutaneous injection of 5 and 45 mg/kg metoprolol in 52 to 64 week old SHRs and 45 mg/kg twice a day to 26 to 29 week old SHRs produced a significant decrease in blooc pressure. The subcutaneous injection of pindolol (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) produced a greater and more consistent depressor effect in mature SHRs. The subcutaneous administration of sotalol (100 mg/kg) and alprenolol (20 mg/kg) resulted in a depressor action which was significant 120 minutes after injection of the drug. In the doses used, propranolol, oxprenolol, 4-hydroxypropranolol and K9-1366 produced pressor effect in SHRs. Propranolol did not cause this pressor effect in prehypertensive (seven week old) SHRs. Practolol, dextro-propranolol and KO-1313 had no effect on blood pressure in the doses used. Propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol, dextro-propranolol, 4-hydroxypropranolol, practolol, oxprenolol, KO-1366 and KO-1313 produced no significant effects on blood pressure in normotensive WKY controls in the doses tested. Placing oral doses of 160 mg/kg/day of metoprolol in the drinking water for seven days significantly lowered blood pressure in 14 week old SHRs previously exposed to ineffective doses of 77 mg/kg/day for 24 days. The administration of oral doses of oxprenolol (40 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for three weeks had a slight but insignificant pressor effect. Smaller doses of metoprolol (15 and 39 mg/kg/day for three to four weeks) and practolol (70 to 85 mg/kg/day for two weeks) had no effect on 52 week old SHRs. Oral doses of pindolol, metoprolol, practolol and oxprenolol had no significant effect on blood pressure in WKY controls. There was no clear relationship between the effects of the drugs on blood pressure and their ability to affect the pulse rate. Similarly, there did not appear to be any consistent relationship between the potency of the beta-blocking drug and the blood pressure lowering action. In addition, neither cardioselective beta-blockade nor sympathomimetic properties allowed the prediction of blood pressure responses to the administration of those agents possessing these features. Although SHRs provide a valuable model of human essential hypertension, the variable effects reported here and elsewhere in the literature require caution as to the applicability and usefulness of testing and evaluating beta-adrenergic blocking drugs for theri potential anti-hypertensive effects in this particular form of experimental hypertension.", 
    "33": "Plasma renin levels have been used to discriminate between different forms of hypertension, but how to define the normal range of plasma renin levels has not been agreed upon. Sodium depletion stimulates renin release. Evaluation of plasma renin would, therefore seem possible only in relation to sodium balance. Plasma renin concentration and concurrent daily sodium excretion were determined in 33 healthy normotensive subjects (control group) ingesting high, normal and low sodium diets. A well-defined hyperbolic relationship was found between the two variables indicating that the physiologic level of plasma renin concentration depends on the state of sodium balance. An increase in plasma potassium concentration may reduce plasma renin concentration, but this appeared to be overruled by the stimulating effect of sodium depletion. To examine whether beta-adrenergic stimulation contributes to the increase in plasma renin concentration during sodium depletion, the relationship between plasma renin concentration and concurrent sodium excretion was studied during beta-receptor blockade with propranolol. In 20 healthy normotensive subjects in whom beta-receptor blockade was verified by a significant reduction in pulse rate, the same hyperbolic relationship was found between plasma renin concentration and sodium excretion as in the control group showing that sodium depletion stimulates renin release independent of sympathetic nervous activity.", 
    "34": "The short-acting nitrite sublingual nitroglycerin is the cornerstone of drug treatment of angina pectoris. It is most useful when given two to three minutes before activity that may precipitate an anginal attack. If disabling angina persists despite medical management and there is no contraindication, the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol should be tried before coronary artery surgery is considered. Newer bera-adrenergic blocking agents do not appear to be more effective than propranolol. Digitalis may be beneficial in patients with congestive heart failure or with cardiac arrhythmias responsive to digitalis and in some patients with radiographic evidence of left ventricular enlargement or with nocturnal angina resulting from increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume. If bypass graft surgery is done, medical management must be continued postoperatively.", 
    "35": "pA2 values against isoproterenol were determined for a number of cardioselective and noncardioselective beta adrenergic receptor blocking agents using human and guinea-pig isolated atrial and bronchial or tracheal preparations to study possible species differences. No significant differences in pA2 values for propranolol, pindolol, Ro 3-4787, acebutolol, atenolol, practolol, metoprolol, H 87/07 and tolamolol on bronchial or tracheal beta adrenergic receptors of both species were found. With respect to atrial beta adrenergic receptors, significantly lower pA2 values for human preparations, as compared to guinea-pig preparations, were found for tolamolol and CI 775. These are the only two agents in the series that derive their cardioselectivities from specific nitrogen substitutents. The different potencies of only these two compounds in antagonizing isoproterenol on atrial beta adrenergic receptors of both species suggest a difference in an accessory receptor area close to the site that interacts with the nitrogen atom of beta adrenergic agents.", 
    "36": "It is difficult to choose among the many drugs advocated for treating anxiety symptoms. The barbiturates were the most commonly used antianxiety agents until recently but are being superseded by the benzodiazepines. The latter are more effective than the barbiturates as shown in comparative clinical trials, they are safer in overdosage (deliberate or accidental), and they are somewhat less likely to induce dependence. The barbiturates have the additional drawback of interfering with the action of other drugs by inducing liver microsomal (oxidising) drug metabolising enzymes. The major tranquilisers (neuroleptics or antipsychotics) are often of value in low dosage in patients with a previous history of dependence on alcohol, the barbiturates or the benzodiazepines. Tricyclic antidepressants are the treatment of choice in anxious and depressed patients and monoamine oxidase inhibitors may be helpful in phobic patients. The beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents such as propranolol often ameliorate somatic symptoms such as palpitations and tremor. In the treatment of anxious patients it is important to remove causes for anxiety and to limit any course of drug treatment to a finite period. Both dosage level and dosage interval should be flexible. Benzodiazepines remain the drug treatment of choice.", 
    "37": "The effects of oral and intravenous administration of atenolol were studied in healthy volunteers. The oral administration of a series of single doses of atenolol reduced an exercise tachycardia. After a 200-mg dose, the effect on an exercise tachycardia was maximal at 3 hr and declined linearly with time at a rate of approximately 10% per 24 hr. The peak plasma atenolol concentration occurred at 3 hr and thereafter declined exponentially with time with an elimination half-life of 6.36 +/- 0.55 hr: 43 +/- 3.9% of the dose was excreted in the urine within 72 hr. There was a correlation between the reduction in an exercise tachycardia and the logarithm of the corresponding plasma concentration. The intravenous administration of atenolol reduced exercise tachycardia with a significant correlation between effect and plasma concentration. After 50 mg intravenously, 100% of the dose was recovered from the urine, and the clearance was 97.3 ml/min. Comparison of AUC O leads to chi after oral and intravenous administration of 50 mg showed the bioavailability to be 63% after oral drug. Repeated oral administration of atenolol 200 mg daily either as a single dose or in divided 12 hourly doses for 8 days maintained reduction of an exercise tachycardia of at least 24% during the period of drug administration. The plasma elimination half-life, area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and peak plasma concentration after 200 mg atenolol were not changed by chronic dosing for 8 days.", 
    "38": "Various characteristics of the altered responsiveness to noradrenaline (NA) of the cyclic Amp (cAMP) generating system of cortical brain slices have been studied in rat after chronic reserpine treatment and in mice after chronic D-amphetamine treatment. Supersensitivity of the cAMP system to NA following reserpine treatment and subsensitivity after D-amphetamine treatment exhibit many common features. Firstly, in both cases the modified responsiveness to NA occurs rapidly after the beginning of the treatment (one day for reserpine and 5 h after amphetamine) and recovers slowly after the end of the treatment. Additionally, the altered states of sensitivity of the cAMP system to NA are the result of a modification of the maximal response rather than of an altered affinity of the system to NA. Since, following D-amphetamine treatment the change of sensitivity is still apparent in the presence of a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor, the involvement of a gross alteration of phosphodiesterase activity is unlikely. In this case too, while the response to adenosine is slightly decreased, the responses to dopamine and serotonin of the cAMP system observed in brain slices following D-amphetamine treatment is not detected in a cell-free preparation. Thus, it appears that drug treatments, modifying synaptic transmission in opposite directions, lead also to changes in opposite directions of the responsiveness of the cAMP system to NA. The hypothesis that the mechanisms underlying such phenomena are related to a modified number of functional noradrenergic receptors is discussed.", 
    "39": "Six patients with the diagnosis of acute mania were treated with high doses of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol. One of these patients was treated during two manic phases. Psychopathologic change during treatment was rated daily by a psychiatrist not informed on the patients medication. The IMPS (Inpatient Multidimensional Psychiatric Scale) was used. Three cases were placebo-controlled under double blind conditions. Four times we had a second medication period, twice with propranolol and once with oxprenolol and dexpropranolol respectively. Propranolol was administered every 4 h (six times per day), starting with single doses of 20-40 mg. Doses were increased individually under control of pulse rate, blood pressure, and ECG. Augmentation of doses was continued until an effect on manic symptomatology was undoubtedly seen or until therapy had to be discontinued because of side-effects. In four patients definite improvement of manic symptomatology could be achieved during altogether five manic phases within usually two treatment periods of 5-15 days. Manic behavior disappeared completely in two of these patients. The effective dosage of propranolol varied between 280 and 2320 mg per day. All of the improved patients relapsed after discontinuation of the drug. In the only case on dexpropranolol (5 days up to 900 mg daily) the effect was questionable. No extrapyramidal side-effects were observed. In one patient treatment was discontinued because of lack of cooperation, in another because of extrasystoles. Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in the patient who received dexpropranolol. This complication was possibly due to other medication. Other side-effects were insomnia, hypertension, precordial pain, abdominal pain as well as the expected hypotension and bradycardia. The significance of these results regarding the catecholamine hypothesis of manic-depressive illness is discussed.", 
    "40": "In a controlled double-blind crossover study followed by an open longterm continuation period, the antihypertensive effect of timolol (Blocadren), a new beta-receptor antagonist, was investigated in 24 ambulatory patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension who were concomitantly receiving Moduretic as baseline diuretic therapy. The addition of timolol to one tablet daily Moduretic resulted in a clinically and statistically significant further reduction of supine and upright systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The average total daily dosage schedule for timolol ranged between 15 and 20 mg, with the same blood pressure lowering effect whether the divided dose was given twice or three times. Significant sinus bradycardia was consistently observed but well tolerated, with only one patient requiring dose reduction. After 48 weeks of treatment (comprising 46 weeks Moduretic and 36 weeks timolol) 20 of 22 patients were normotensive (supine diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg) while in two the hypotensive response proved inadequate. One patient was dropped from the study after 3 days of timolol treatment because of acute bronchial asthma. When specifically questioned, one-third of the patients admitted experiencing cold extremities. One patient exhibited Raynaud's syndrome which was treated symptomatically while continuing in the study. In terms of electrolyte balance, the fixed combination of hydrochlorothiazide and the antikaluretic amiloride (Moduretic) as baseline therapy essentially proved adequate. On occasion, however, two subject revealed hypokalemia requiring short-term oral potassium supplement. During the initial 10 to 16 weeks a steady decline in serum potassium was observed but this stabilized itself thereafter. The concomitant administration of Moduretic and timolol (Blocadren) was shown to be an effective therapeutic regimen in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. This combination is particularly suitable for patient compliance in longterm therapy, as timolol can be given twice daily.", 
    "41": "The undecapeptides, substance P and eledoisin, caused a rapid, concentration-dependent increase in K+ efflux and amylase release from parotid tissue slices. The effects were not blocked by beta-adrenergic, alpha-adrenergic, or cholinergic antagonists. Incubation buffer calcium was required for stimulation of K efflux and amylase release. The action of the undecapepides was independent of any effects on parotid cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP levels. Since the actions of the undecapeptides were Ca2+ dependent and no effects on cyclic nucleotide levels were discerned it was concluded that Ca2+ plays a primary role in agonist regulation of K+ efflux from the parotid.", 
    "42": "In order to characterize age differences in the lipolytic effect of catecholamines on tests of subcutaneous adipose tissue of test persons aged from 0.1 to 10 years, from 20 to 40 years, and from 60 to 75 years the influence of propranolol, phentolamine and theophyllin on the release of glycerol by isoprenalin and adrenalin was investigated. Propranolol (10(8) and 10(5) mol/1) inhibits the lipolysis in the adipose tissue of all age groups stimulated by isoprenalin (10(6)and 10(5) mol/1). The following Ki-values were calculated: 2x10(6) mol/1in the tissue of adults, 0.5 x 10(6) mol/1 in the infantile adipose tissue, 0.2 X 10(6) mol/1 in the tissue of old persons. Phentolamine (10(5) mol/1) increases the lipolytic effect of adrenalin (10(5) mol/1), there are no age differences. Theophyllin (10 (2) mol/1) increases the release of glycerol induced by isoprenalin (10(5) mol/1) in infantile and adult adipose tissue, however, it has no influence on them in the adipose tissue of old man. The findings suggest the higher sensitivity of the fat cells of the ageing organism to beta-adrenergics underlies a higher affinity of the adrenergics to the specific beta-adrenoceptors in the cytoplasm membrane of the adipocytes. The more intensive lipid mobilization in old age by beta-adrenergics is explained by a low activity of the cAMP-phosphodiesterase of the fat cells and by the higher and possibly longer lasting increase of intracellular cAMP in this age group.", 
    "43": "The cervicovaginal epithelium of neonatal mice produces a material with specific antigenic properties (CVA) and this material is produced in increased amounts after estradiol treatment. Using a cytochemical method, estradiol treatment was shown to result in an increase of adenylate cyclase activity in the same epithelium. When d-propranolol is injected together with estradiol, the increase in CVA is inhibited, while the hormone-induced proliferation of epithelial cells is not influenced. When adenylate cyclase activity is studied under identical conditions, the estradiol-promoted increase in enzyme activity is largely counteracted by d-propranolol. These findings would suggest that Adenosine 3\"5\"-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) has a role in some, but not all, estradiol-mediated effects in the neonatal cervicovaginal epithelium.", 
    "44": "Recognition of the \"occulomucocutaneous syndrome\" related to practolol administration has caused the safety of other beta-blocking agents to come under close scrutiny. No satisfactory means of screening for at-risk patients is available. ANF estimation, has considerable limitations as both a screening and a diagnostic procedure. Patients with skin lesions alone may not be positive, while even advanced cases often show very low titres. There are important technical difficulties with the assay and interpretation of results is hindered by an increase in incidence of the antibody with age, in females, and in patients on a wide variety of other therapeutic agents.", 
    "45": "10 healthy male volunteers received orally either 100 mg tolamolol or 20 mg bufuralol. These experiments were repeated by intravenous administration of 10 and 5 mg respectively of these two drugs. Plasma levels of the parent drugs and their main metabolite were measured. In one subject, the apparent half-life of elimination was increased from 2.5 h (normal subjects) to 5 h for both drugs. This prolongation of the half-life is associated with low plasma levels of the metabolites, a peculiarity which can be explanined by a decreased rate of metabolism for these two drugs. This anomaly may explain the marked orthostatic hypotension observed only in this subject. The likelihood of a pharmacogenetic defect is discussed.", 
    "46": "Drug fashions have changed and older drugs have given place to others with less side effects. Drugs and combinations of drugs administered to 100 patients currently under treatment at a clinic for severe hypertensives are listed. The most popular drugs were thiazide diuretics, methyldopa, beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, clinidine and hydrallazine. A thiazide diuretic was a constant member of the drug combinations. About 60% of patients achieved \"good\" blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 100 mm Hg), 30% \"fair\" (diastolic blood pressure=100 to 110 mm Hg) and 10+ \"poor\" (diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mm Hg). Similar proportions were in \"good\", \"fair\" and \"poor\" general health. The best prospect for improved management of hypertension probably lies in earlier treatment with current drug combinations."
