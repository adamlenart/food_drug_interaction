    "0": "In a double placebo-controlled, partly single blind and partly double blind ergometric trial, the acute action of acebutolol and nifedipine singly and in combination on cardiovascular parameters and ischemic reactions was studied. Neither nifedipine nor acebutolol lowered the resting heart rate nor the resting blood pressure significantly. At the highest load the heart rate, systolic blood pressure and the pressure-frequency product were significantly reduced, the changes due to acebutolol being more marked than those of nifedipine. nifedipine alone reduced the ST segment by 1/3, acebutolol by a half. The combined administration of acebutolol and nifedipine produced without exception significant reductions of heart rate, blood pressure, pressure-frequency product, ST segment, and ischemic pain as compared with placebo.", 
    "1": "The characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors on frog and chick erythrocytes have been compared to those present on rat erythrocyte, lung and cerebral cortical membranes. The receptors have been examined using the specific ligand [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) with conventional filtration techniques. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of [3H]DHA and the affinities of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol, timolol and alprenolol, were very similar in all preparations examined. The relative order of potency of the catecholamines, isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline in rat lung, rat erythrocyte and frog erythrocyte; isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than or equal to adrenaline in chick erythrocyte and rat cortex, suggest an overall beta 2-classification for the former and beta 1-classification of the latter tissues. However, the use of highly selective beta 1- or beta 2-agents and computer-assisted iterative curve fitting revealed that whereas rat cortex and lung possess both receptor subtypes (lung 80% beta 2, 20% beta 1: cortex 65% beta 1, 35% beta 2) only beta 2-sites were observed in rat erythrocytes. On the other hand, chick and frog erythrocytes possess a homogeneous population of receptors that do not strictly correspond either to beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors. The atypical nature of these non-mammalian erythrocyte beta-adrenoceptors is discussed in relation to their previous extensive use as model beta-adrenoceptor systems.", 
    "2": "Bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle have been shown to increase [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding in the rat hippocampus. The effect of adrenalectomy on this increase in receptor binding was examined. Groups of rats received stereotaxically placed 6-OHDA injections aimed at the dorsal bundle (DB) or vehicle injections (control). Half of each group subsequently received bilateral adrenalectomies (ADX) and the other half received sham operations, yielding four groups: control, DB, ADX, and DB + ADX. The DB lesions produced a 41% increase in maximum binding in close agreement with a previous report. No statistically significant change in [3H]DHA receptor binding was observed following adrenalectomy treatment alone. By contrast, the DB + ADX group showed a significant increase in maximum [3H]DHA receptor binding compared to the DB group. This adrenalectomy-induced increase was reversed after 1 week of corticosterone treatment (1.0 mg/kg/12 h, s.c.). These results suggest an interaction between noradrenergic mechanisms and corticosterone in the hippocampus.", 
    "3": "We have measured nuclear protein kinase activity during the prereplicative phase of rat liver regeneration. Total nuclear protein kinase activity increased significantly 15-18 h after partial hepatectomy, with the peak of activity occurring at 16 h. DEAE-Sephacel chromatography resolved nuclear protein kinase activity into two cAMP-independent (Ib and II) and two cAMP-dependent (Ia and III) protein kinases. Sixteen h after partial hepatectomy, there was a marked increase in the activities of the nuclear cAMP-dependent protein kinases and a decrease in the activity of nuclear cAMP-independent protein kinase II. Characterization of the two nuclear cAMP-dependent protein kinases revealed them to be identical with the cytosolic type I and II isozymes. Immunotitration of nuclear catalytic subunit and densitometric analysis of autoradiographs from 8-azido-[32P]cAMP-labeled nuclear RI revealed increases in both subunits 16 h afer partial hepatectomy. Concomitantly with the observed increase in nuclear protein kinase activity, we have observed an increase in the phosphorylation of histone H1 subspecies. Administration of the beta-adrenergic antagonist DL-propranolol, which has been shown to cause delays of equal duration in both the second phase of increased intracellular cAMP levels and the initiation of DNA synthesis (MacManus, J. P., Braceland, B. M., Youdale, T., and Whitfield, J. F. (1973) J. Cell. Physiol. 82, 157-164), results in an equivalent delay of increased nuclear protein kinase activity. Colchicine, which has previously been shown to prevent the onset of DNA synthesis (Walker, P. R., and Whitfield, J. F. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 1394-1398), also prevents the increased protein kinase activity normally observed 16 h after partial hepatectomy. We conclude that the onset of DNA synthesis in the regenerating rat liver is preceded by a cAMP-mediated translocation of type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase to the nucleus and phosphorylative modification of histone H1 subspecies. The inhibitory effects of propranolol and colchicine suggest a common cAMP-mediated, colchicine-sensitive link between protein kinase translocation and the initiation of DNA synthesis.", 
    "4": "In frog erythrocytes, desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors is characterized by a decrease in the beta-receptor recognition sites in the plasma membrane and a concomitant increase in the number of this receptor's binding sites in the cytosol. We have documented that this redistribution of the receptor recognition sites reflects the internalization of the surface-bound beta-adrenergic receptors. The present study was addressed to examine whether transglutaminase plays a role in the agonist-mediated internalization of beta-adrenergic receptor recognition sites. Pretreatment of cells with methylamine was found to decrease the internalization and the loss of membrane-bound beta-adrenergic receptors induced by isoproterenol. Methylamine appears to be equally potent in inhibiting transglutaminase activity and in preventing internalization and the receptor loss. The effect of methylamine on soluble and on membrane-bound beta-adrenergic receptors is due to a change in Bmax rather than Kd of these binding sites. Among eight inhibitors of transglutaminase tested, the rank order potency for blocking the enzyme can be correlated with that for preventing the receptor loss and receptor internalization. Moreover, these drug effects on beta-adrenergic receptors are unrelated to the inhibition of isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase or the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to beta-receptors. These result may lend credence to the view that transglutaminase participates in the internalization and the decrease of membrane-bound receptors during desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "5": "In a controlled trial of treatment for stammering under stress oxprenolol (40 mg) compared with placebo was assessed in a double-blind manner over two days, six weeks apart, in 31 stammerers before and after speech therapy. The trial design also allowed six weeks of intensive speech therapy, using a slowed-speech and relaxation technique, to be compared with not treatment and assessed single-blind. Oxprenolol produced a significant fall in pulse rate and systolic blood pressure but no overall change in performance either before or after speech therapy. Intensive speech therapy produced a highly significant improvement in the global performance of untrained subjects (p less than 0.001) and a significant reduction in the number (p less than 0.001) and duration (p less than 0.001) of blocks. Maintenance speech therapy tended to produce further improvement in trained subjects. Speech therapy is apparently an effective treatment for stammering, whereas oxprenolol appears to be of no value when given routinely; oxprenolol may be of value, however, in very stressful conditions.", 
    "6": "Ventriculocisternal administration of dl- and d-propranolol produced dose-dependent increases in cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine and reductions in blood pressure. A highly significant correlation was found between the increase in norepinephrine and the hypotensive effect. The propranolol-induced hypotension was prevented by intracisternal phentolamine. These data indicate that the hypotensive effect of centrally administered propranolol results from a drug-induced release of norepinephrine, which stimulates central alpha receptors to lower arterial pressure.", 
    "7": "The interaction of alcohols in the hydrolysis of aryl beta-D-glucopyranosides and aryl beta-D-xylopyranosides by beta-D-glucosidase (beta-D-glucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.21) from Stachybotrys atra has been investigated. The results constitute support for the presence of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, formed during the first step (glycosylation) of the proposed two-step mechanism. Transfer of the glycosyl group to an alcohol, with the formation of an alkyl glycopyranoside, can take place in parallel to the transfer to a water molecule (second or deglycosylation step). The alcohol binds to the free enzyme and to the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. The glycosyl-enzyme-alcohol complex undergoes hydrolysis in addition to the alcoholysis. For aryl beta-D-glucopyranosides the deglycosylation step is rate-limiting. For aryl beta-D-xylopyranosides two kinds of substrate behaviour can be observed. Depending on the substituent group on the phenyl ring, either both steps are rate-controlling or the first step is rate-limiting. Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the rate at which the substrate aglycon group is released.", 
    "8": "The effects of orally administered timolol maleate (10 mg twice a day) were assessed in 88 patients entered into a double-blind study within 10.74 +/- 5.07 hours of onset of myocardial infarction. Timolol maleate produced no significant change in crude mortality rate, infarct size, incidence of arrhythmias or significant left ventricular failure. Withdrawals from study because of recurrent angina or hypertension were confined to the placebo group. The results of this study suggested that, when given relatively late after infarction, timolol maleate does not reduce either infarct size or incidence of arrhythmias, despite production of a safe and effective beta-blockade.", 
    "9": "Penbutolol, a new beta-adrenoceptor blocker, was found to increase the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) significantly (16%) relative to placebo when administered orally in a dose of 40 mg daily for 7 consecutive days to healthy males. Measurements were performed after the seventh dose. In contrast, a single acute intravenous dose of penbutolol 4 mg did not influence the GFR, which was determined by means of a gamma counter after intravenous injection of technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid. Since penbutolol possesses moderate beta-adrenomimetic activity, it is postulated that the observed increase in the GFR after oral penbutolol could be due to increased cardiac output at rest.", 
    "10": "A product combining 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide, 2.5 mg amiloride hydrochloride and 10.0 mg timolol maleate (Moducrin) was tested in 20 previously untreated hypertensive persons. The systolic blood pressure before treatment was 199.1 +/- 24.8 mmg Hg and after treatment 149.1 +/- 19.1 mm Hg. Diastolic blood pressure showed a drop from 120.9 +/- 11.9 mm Hg to 92.2 +/- 13.3 mm Hg. Both decreases were highly significant (p less than 0.01). The heart rate, moreover, was reduced during treatment from 81.5 +/- 11.1 beats per minute to 66.8 +/- 9.25 beats (p less than 0.01). Haemoglobin, haematocrit and serum uric acid showed significant changes, but did not reach pathological ranges. Treatment had to be stopped in only one case in this study because of incipient asthmatic bronchitis. We conclude that this combination drug has a very good antihypertensive effect and is well tolerated.", 
    "11": "This study deals with the identification of the biochemical events involved in the metabolic sequence leading from the synthesis to the release of thyroxine in the dispersed thyroid cell system. (1) Using an experimental model allowing the differentiation between intracellular and extracellular sites of iodination, it is shown that thyroxine is synthesized inside the cells by an iodinating system sensitive to thyrotropin stimulation. (2) The secretion of thyroxine synthesized inside the cells is not mediated by an exocytotic-endocytotic phenomenon. Colchicine, vinblastine, fluoride, propanolol and chlorpromazine, at concentrations equal to or 10--100-times higher than those required to inhibit hormone release in follicular-organized thyroid tissue have no effect on thyrotropin-stimulated thyroxine secretion. (3) The secretion involves the intracellular proteolysis of hormone-containing iodoprotein(s) which, in addition to free thyroxine, generates free mono- and diiodotyrosines. Free thyroxine is released into the incubation medium and iodotyrosines are deiodinated under normal conditions and accumulate in the presence of an inhibitor of iodotyrosine deiodinase: 3,5-dinitrotyrosine. This proteolysis is inhibited by 5 mM chlorpromazine. These data indicate that the complete metabolic sequence leading from the uptake of iodide to the release of free thyroxine into the incubation medium can be described as an 'intracellular metabolic sequence for thyroxine synthesis'.", 
    "12": "The effect of 3% metoprolol and 0.5% timolol eye drops on the intraocular pressure (IOP) was compared in healthy subjects. The effect of a single dose was determined up to 48 h after administration of the drug before and after 2 weeks' treatment twice daily with the test drug. The study was performed as a randomized, double-masked cross-over study. Both drugs caused significant reductions in IOP with a maximal effect 2 to 8 h after administration of the drug. Timolol reduced the mean IOP from 14.8 to 10.7 mmHg after 2 h. The corresponding figures for metoprolol were 14.1 and 11.5 mmHg. There was no clear cut effect in the untreated eye for either drug. The effect of one drop timolol lasted for at least 48 h. The duration of one drop metoprolol was 36 h, but there was a marked reduction of the effect between 8 and 12 h after administration of the drug. Both drugs caused a smaller pressure reduction when the effect of one drop was followed for 48 h after to weeks' treatment compared to the initial response. This \"escape\" was of the same order for both drugs. It has been concluded that the composition of metoprolol eye drops used in the present study is less efficient than timolol as an ocular hypotensive agent.", 
    "13": "The pharmacokinetics of propranolol after the administration of 40, 80, and 120 mg p.o. and 10 mg i.v. was studied in nine healthy male volunteers. Propranolol was analyzed after extraction and derivatization by gas-liquid chromatography. A multiexponential curve-stripping program was used for the pharmacokinetic analysis. The volume of distribution was about 6 liters . kg-1, bioavailability around 25%, with a mean terminal half-life of 6 hr. There was no evidence of either dose dependent disposition kinetics or an oral threshold dose. A slight increase in urine volume was observed after propranolol administration.", 
    "14": "In this study we have assessed the possibility that long-term beta-blockade may offer additional protection against myocardial ischaemia that is separate from that afforded by acute beta-blockade. In addition, the effect of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) on this additional protection was also investigated. Equipotent doses (4 mg . kg-1 body wt . day-1) of oxprenolol (possessing ISA) or propranolol (without ISA) were administered orally to rats for 3 weeks. Hearts were excised an perfused as isolated \"working\" heart preparations at variable times after the last dose. Hearts excised on the final day of drug administration showed significantly higher basal functional performance compared with untreated hearts. After 30 min reduced flow ischaemia (in the presence of exogenous catecholamine drive) hearts were aerobically reperfused and functional recovery measured. In both chronically beta-blocked groups, at times when plasma drug levels were undetectable, the number of hearts that recovered function and the cellular levels of creatine phosphate and glycogen were significantly increased. In addition, hearts from the oxprenolol-treated group perfused on the final day of drug administration, exhibited a greater recovery of heart rate compared with both propranolol treated and untreated groups. These results indicate that secondary consequences of long-term beta-blockade are beneficial to the ischaemic myocardium in the presence of high catecholamine drive. In addition, the possession of ISA by oxprenolol offered some advantages in terms of post-ischaemic functional recovery.", 
    "15": "The beta-adrenergic blocking agent timolol was given to cats with acute coronary artery ligation. Regional myocardial tissue flow was measured by the distribution of 15 micrometers labelled microspheres. Timolol reduced heart rate, cardiac contractility and left ventricular systolic pressure, but end-diastolic pressure rose. Ischaemic tissue blood flow remained unchanged following timolol, thus improving the marked imbalance between oxygen demands and delivery. In normal areas of the myocardial tissue flow was reduced, indicating the beta 2-adrenergic blocking effect of timolol. This was also the case for the border area between ischaemic and non-ischaemic tissue, but significantly less flow reduction was found on the endocardial side than on the epicardial side in the border area. Except for this latter observation, timolol does not appear to improve coronary perfusion. The present study, therefore, indicates that beneficial effects of timolol on ischaemic myocardium are mainly related to a reduction of myocardial oxygen demand.", 
    "16": "1 The offset of effects on blood pressure and heart rate after cessation of long-term therapy (19 +/- 3.6 months) with atenolol (200 mg once/daily) was studied in six hypertensive patients. 2 Withdrawal of atenolol resulted in a gradual return of lying, standing and post-exercise systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels and heart rate towards the baseline value. The offset of effect greatly exceeded the time for elimination of atenolol. 3 No significant differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of atenolol were evident between the values obtained following chronic dosing and an acute single-dose study. 4 The lack of clinical evidence of increased cardiac adrenergic sensitivity or rebound hypertension following withdrawal of atenolol contrasts with reports of a withdrawal syndrome following cessation of therapy with propranolol. Nevertheless until the mechanism of the propranolol-withdrawal syndrome is better understood caution is required when stopped therapy with atenolol in patients with severe coronary artery disease.", 
    "17": "The receptors involved in dopamine-induced relaxation were investigated in whole segments of rabbit middle cerebral (M.C.A.) and central ear arteries (C.E.A.) by measuring pressure changes in a constant-flow in vitro set-up. Drug administrations were made in the perfusate. During treatment with high-K+ solution to induce active contraction, and in the presence of 3 x 10(-5) M phenoxybenzamine to prevent alpha-adrenergic contractions, cumulative concentration-response curves were obtained for dopamine, apomorphine, bromocriptine and piribedil. The effects of the dopamine receptor antagonists, sulpiride, haloperidol and droperidol, and a beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, were tested on the concentration-response curves obtained with dopamine. The results can be summarized as follows: the dopaminergic agonists had a relaxant effect in 50% of C.E.A. and in 70% of M.C.A. after alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade. This effect was blocked by the 3 antagonists in the M.C.A., and this antagonism appeared to be competitive in the case of sulpiride. In the C.E.A., haloperidol and droperidol exerted complex effects on the dopamine relaxation, and sulpiride had inconsistent effects. Propranolol reduced the concentration-dependent relaxation in the C.E.A., but did not modify the relaxant effect of dopamine in the M.C.A. The present results are consistent with the hypothesis that dopaminergic agonists relax cerebral arteries by acting on specific receptors. The relaxant action on the C.E.A. seems more complex and may occur partly via beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "18": "To further examine the mechanism of antihypertensive action, effects of a single (50mg/kg) and repeated oral administration (50 mg/kg per day, for 14 days) of oxprenolol on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were studied in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats at rest and during handling stress. MAP was measured through a indwelling aortic cannula and HR was determined via chronically implanted electrodes. A single oral dose of oxprenolol produced a gradual fall in resting MAP. Although repeated dose of oxprenolol did not alter the developmental course of hypertension in SHR rats, a prompt and significant fall in MAP at rest was observed after the dose on the 14th day of the experiment. A single and repeated dose of oxprenolol attenuated the increase in MAP during handling stress, but these effects were less apparent when compared to the fall in resting MAP. Significant reductions in stress-induced tachycardia were observed both after a single and repeated dose, whereas resting HR tended to increase. These results indicate that some of the postulated antihypertensive mechanisms such as central inhibition of sympathetic outflow, peripheral inhibition of sympathetic nerve functions and suppression of cardiac output are not directly related to a fall in MAP observed in SHR rats after oxprenolol treatment. Time courses of the hypotensive effect of a single and repeated doses suggest that the accumulation of oxprenolol in active sites which appear to be located in deep compartments is required to develop hypotensive effect.", 
    "19": "A noncontact tonometer was used to demonstrate in normal human volunteers the ocular hypotensive effects of single instillations of pindolol (1%) and timolol (0.25 and 0.5%) eye drops. Falls in intraocular pressure were significantly correlated with resting intraocular pressure. Evidence of systemic cardiovascular effects was seen in reductions in resting heart rate.", 
    "20": "The haemodynamic effects of Labetalol, an alpha- and beta blocking agent were investigated during neurosurgery in 11 patients with cerebral aneurysm and hypertensive episodes. All operations were performed in neuroleptanalgesia and controlled ventilation (PaCO2 = 30 mmHg). Immediately after intravenous injection of Labetalol there was a significant fall in the following haemodynamic parameters: arterial pressure -20 percent, pulmonary artery pressure -17 per cent, heart work index (right ventricle -32 percent, left ventricle -30 percent) and cardiac effort index -25 percent. Heart rate, cardiac index, stroke volume, total systemic and total pulmonary resistance were not appreciably altered. Labetalol appears to be of value in neurosurgical operations, where an increase in blood pressure, heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption is undesirable.", 
    "21": "In 5- and 7-day-old HAICR mice the calorigenic action of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) was investigated at different ambient temperatures. After treating animals with 5 microgram T4 or 1 microgram T3 per g body weight and day, their oxygen consumption was compared with that of litter mate controls at 23 degree, 27 degree, 31 degree and 35 degree C. The hormone action was highly dependent on ambient temperature, 1 microgram T3 being most effective. A thyroid hormone effect could never be observed at 31 degree C, the animals' nest temperature. By application of propranolol, which almost selectively blocks nonshivering thermogenesis (NST), we could show that T3 increases minimal oxygen consumption (MOC) as well as the capacity for NST. In addition, it could be shown that also oxygen consumption of liver tissue of 5-day-old mice is elevated by preceding treatment with thyroid hormones. The ambient temperature effects are discussed in relation to the thermoregulatory situation of the mice during the early postnatal period.", 
    "22": "1. The potential use of catecholamines to increase the severity of dysrhythmias evoked by coronary artery ligation in the anaesthetized rat was investigated. Drugs were given intravenously prior to ligation. 2 Pressor doses of adrenaline (5 microgram/kg) noradrenaline (1 microgram/kg) phenylephrine (5-10 microgram/kg), and angiotensin (0.25 microgram/kg) conferred protection against the development of dysrhythmias. 3 Atropine (1 mg/kg) increased mortality from ventricular fibrilloflutter (VF) and abolished the protective effects of phenylephrine (10 micrograms/kg). 4 Administration of isoprenaline (10 microgram/kg) significantly increased the incidence of and the mortality from VF. 5 The order of antidysrhythmic drug potency of Org 6001 (1-10 mg/kg), disopyramide (2-10 mg/kg) and practolol (2-10 mg/kg) was similar in both the standard (without isoprenaline) and modified (with isoprenaline) models. 6 Use of the modified method for antidysrhythmic screening purpose allows demonstration of statistically meaningful results with the use of relatively few animals. 7 Comparison of the pattern of VF in the rat heart induced by various means suggests that the diagnosis of ventricular fibrillation can be made with more confidence in the modified method compared to the standard method.", 
    "23": "1 The interaction of hydralazine (Hyd) and propildazine (Pyd) with purine compounds was studied in the isolated tail artery from normotensive Wistar (NW) rats.2 Exogenously added purines inhibit non competitively the antispasmogenic response to Hyd in denervated NW segments. The order of potency is 2-Cl-adenosine > adenosine > adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) > inosine. Pyd action is modified only by the most active purine 2-Cl-adenosine, which displaces the dose-response curves to the right. Hyd and Pyd seem to act on the same site, since their maximal effects are not additive.3 Theophylline (Theo) 50 muM induces the appearance of the antispasmogenic effect of Hyd in the usually poorly responsive innervated proximal NW arterial segments. The potentiating action of Theo is identical to the enhancement of the Hyd response observed after 6-hydroxydopamine denervation. This result suggests that the release of endogenous purines from sympathetic nerves is sufficient to block the smooth muscle responses to Hyd, under our experimental conditions. A similar potentiating effect is obtained with propranolol (5 muM).4 The spontaneous release of (3)H, after loading with [(3)H]-noradrenaline, was considered as an indirect indication of purine leakage from nerve terminals. There is an inverse relationship between the rate of (3)H release, under these conditions, and the magnitude of the relaxant response to Hyd, i.e., (3)H leakage is higher in proximal NW segments.5 The most satisfactory explanation for the interaction of Hyd and Pyd with exogenous purines, and for the modulating actions of sympathetic nerve terminals, is that both antihypertensives act on a common receptor, sensitive to endogenous ATP and adenosine.", 
    "24": "This study was designed to evaluate the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on right ventricular and right coronary hemodynamics in the anesthetized vagotomized dog and pig during constant-pressure coronary perfusion. Carotid occlusion in the dog resulted in an increase in heart rate, aortic pressure, right ventricular dP/dt, and a sustained 13% decrease in right coronary artery blood flow and a 14% increase in coronary vascular resistance. This coronary vasoconstriction was not modified during beta-blockade with propranolol but was prevented by alpha- blockade with phentolamine. Similar hemodynamic data was obtained in the pig and, in addition, it was found that the O2 consumption of the right ventricle is low (4.8 +/- 0.4 ml O2.min-1.100 g-1) and is only slightly increased (5.l5 +/- 0.8 ml.min-1.100 g-1) during carotid occlusion. These data suggest that baroreflex-mediated sympathetic stimulation to the heart evokes only a minor increase in metabolic activity in the right ventricular myocardium so that the direct neural (alpha-vasoconstrictor) effect predominates over the metabolic vasodilator mechanism.", 
    "25": "The extrarenal disposal of potassium was studied in nephrectomized and adrenalectomized rats by measuring the rise in serum potassium produced during an infusion of 3 meq KCl/kg over 90 min. Adrenalectomy alone did not alter the volume of distribution of infused potassium in nephrectomized animals. When nephrectomy and adrenalectomy were combined with either insulin deficiency produced by streptozotocin or chemical sympathectomy induced by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine, potassium tolerance was significantly impaired. Hyperkalemia produced in chemically sympathectomized animals by potassium infusion was minimized by simultaneous infusion of epinephrine, an effect blocked by the beta-antagonist propranolol but not by the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine. These results suggest that extra renal uptake of potassium, in addition to being influenced by insulin and circulating catecholamines, is modulated by peripheral sympathetic activity.", 
    "26": "The acute metabolic responses to metabolic acidosis in the rat include an increase in ammoniagenesis and gluconeogenesis before enzyme adaptations have taken place. In the present studies rats were made acidotic with NH4Cl or HCl. Preincubation of renal cortical slices from normal rats in plasma from acidotic rats produced an increase in ammoniagenic capacity. However, when slices were incubated directly in diluted plasma from acidotic rats, there was also an increase in ammoniagenesis and gluconeogenesis from glutamine. The ammoniagenic factor was detectable within 0.5 h of induction of acidosis, was not detectable in chronic acidosis, was not of adrenal origin, was not a protein, was dialyzable, and acted by an alpha-adrenergic-like mechanism in that its action was blocked by phentolamine but not by propranolol. Phentolamine injected into rats depressed the ammoniagenic response to acidosis. The plasma factor did not show its ammoniagenic effect in a low-sodium buffer and there was no absolute requirement for calcium. The acute response to acidosis is thus mediated by a humoral substance with the above characteristics.", 
    "27": "The efficacy and safety of timolol maleate combined with hydrochlorothiazide given once daily compared with hydrochlorothiazide given once daily to patients with hypertension was investigated in a double-blind, randomized study. Patients with uncomplicated, mild to moderate hypertension were admitted to the study. Ten patients received two tablets once daily of timolol maleate 10 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (T/H). Nine patients received hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (HCTZ). Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements and laboratory tests were performed after a six-week placebo baseline period and throughout the 12-week study. Mean supine systolic blood pressure decreased by 21-35 mm Hg for the T/H group and by 10-24 mm Hg for the HCTZ group. Mean supine diastolic blood pressure decreased by 15-22 mm Hg for the T/H group and by 10-13 mm Hg for the HCTZ group. Changes observed in the laboratory variables were not statistically significant between the two treatment groups. One patient in each group had an adverse experience considered unrelated to the drug, and no patient had to discontinue the drug therapy because of an adverse reaction. Although both drug regimens effectively and safely treated uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension, the timolol maleate and hydrochlorothiazide combination had a greater antihypertensive effect.", 
    "28": "The net delta left ventricular ejection time index 4 minutes after exercise is prolonged in many patients with coronary artery disease. This prolongation is thought to be due to the lack of response of the ischemic myocardium to adrenergic stimulation and has been proposed as a measure of myocardial ischemia. In this study, the effect of beta adrenergic blockade on net delta left ventricular ejection time was studied in nine normal subjects (Group A) and in eight patients with stable angina and coronary artery disease (Group B). In Group A, a treadmill exercise test was performed for 10 minutes before and after administration of propranolol, 160 mg daily, for 2 days. The postexercise net delta left ventricular ejection time was significantly greater after propranolol (mean +/- standard error of the mean 12 +/- 4 versus 35 +/- 4 ms, p less than 0.01). In group B a maximal treadmill exercise test was performed before and after therapy with propranolol. Only patients with a normal net delta left ventricular ejection time before propranolol were selected. The net delta left ventricular ejection time again increased significantly after propranolol (11.5 +/- 4 versus 35.3 +/- 5 ms p less than 0.01). It is concluded that prolongation of postexercise net delta left ventricular ejection time cannot be used to diagnose ischemia in patients who are receiving propranolol therapy. Our data support the hypothesis that prolongation of net delta left ventricular ejection time after exercise is caused by an impaired myocardial response to catecholamines, whether due to ischemia or effective beta adrenergic blockade.", 
    "29": "The role of exercise imaging with thallium-201 in the evaluation of patients suspected of having coronary artery disease was studied in 194 patients undergoing diagnostic coronary arteriography. Ninety-eight patients had 70 percent or more narrowing of one or more coronary vessels and 96 patients had either no or insignificant coronary artery disease. One hundren twenty-three of the 194 patients had conclusive treadmill exercise electrocardiograms (either positive or negative), and 71 had inconclusive exercise electrocardiograms. Fifty-four of the 98 patients with coronary artery disease were receiving propranolol at the time of testing. Forty-five (83 percent) of the 54 patients receiving propranolol and 33 (75 percent) of the 44 patients not receiving propranolol had abnormal exercise thallium images (difference not significant). In patients with conclusive exercise electrocardiograms the sensitivity of exercise imaging was not significantly different from that of exercise electrocardiograms (80 versus 74 percent), but the sensitivity of both tests combined (92 percent) was higher than that of either test alone (p less than 0.01). The specificity of exercise imaging (97 percent) electrocardiograms the sensitivity of exercise imaging was not significantly different from that of exercise electrocardiograms (80 versus 74 percent), but the sensitivity of both tests combined (92 percent) was higher than that of either test alone (p less than 0.01). The specificity of exercise imaging (97 percent) electrocardiograms the sensitivity of exercise imaging was not significantly different from that of exercise electrocardiograms (80 versus 74 percent), but the sensitivity of both tests combined (92 percent) was higher than that of either test alone (p less than 0.01). The specificity of exercise imaging (97 percent) was higher than that of exercise electrocardiograms (86 percent, p less than 0.02). The specificity of both tests combined was not significantly different from that of exercise electrocardiograms alone. The sensitivity (79 percent) and specificity (95 percent) of exercise imaging were not significantly different in patients with inconclusive exercise electrocardiograms when compared with those in patients whose exercise electrocardiograms were conclusive. These data indicate that exercise imaging is sensitive and specific in diagnosing coronary artery disease in the presence of diagnostic as well as nondiagnostic exercise electrocardiograms and that propranolol therapy does not affect the results.", 
    "30": "Serum 3'monoiodothyronine (3'-T1) levels were estimated by means of a specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) preceded by an ethanol extraction. The recovery of 3'T1 was in mean (+/-SEM) 110 +/- 9%, and the lower detection limit was 23 pmol/l. Serum levels of 3'T1 in 34 euthyroid healthy subjects were (median (range)) 55 pmol/l (less than 23 - 168 pmol/l), in 13 hyperthyroid patients 133 pmol/l (70 - 265 pmol/l) (P less than 0.01) and in 13 hypothyroid patients less than 23 pmol/l (less than 23 - 68 pmol/l) (P less than 0.01). In 11 patients with chronic renal failure serum 3'-T1 levels were highly increased 285 pmol/l (115 - 1538 pmol/l) (P less than 0.01) and correlated inversely to creatinine clearance (R = -0.68, P less than 0.05). In patients with liver cirrhosis serum 3'-T1 levels were unaffected, whereas in 19 patients with endogenous depression studied before and after recovery from the depression serum levels decreased from 70 pmol/l (less than 23 - 248 pmol/l) to 30 pmol/l (less than 23 - 95 pmol/l) (P less than 0.01). Administration of propranolol 40 mg b.i.d. for 2 weeks did not affect serum 3'-T1 levels. The study shows that 3'-T1 is present in serum from euthyroid man and varies with thyroid function. Further, it is suggested that 3'-T1 in contrast to other iodothyronines primarily is eliminated by the kidneys.", 
    "31": "This investigation was undertaken to determine whether the left ventricular (LV) end-systolic pressure and end-systolic volume, as measured under clinical conditions, are linearly correlated and whether the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (P-Ves) is a meaningful parameter in the assessment of left ventricular function. The studies were performed in twelve patients (eleven with coronary artery disease and one with congestive cardiomyopathy) during which autonomic reflex responses were minimized by propranolol (0.15 mg/kg i.v.) and atropine (1 mg i.v.). Three left ventricular angiograms (at rest, after 10 mg isosorbide dinitrate and during an infusion of 2 mg/min methoxamine) were obtained from which the three respective P-Ves data points were calculated and subjected to linear regression analysis (r greater than or equal to 0.96). The slope k of the linear P-Ves relation correlated most closely with the resting ejection fraction (EF) as an exponential function (r = 0.94). The end-systolic pressure could be interchanged with the peak systolic pressure which is more easily obtained. The theoretical end-systolic volume at end-systolic pressure = 0 (V0) was not related to the resting ejection fraction. Post-extrasystolic potentiation, resulting in an acute inotropic incrementation, shifted the P-Ves toward similar volumes and steepened its slope.", 
    "32": "SCH 19927, one of the four chiral forms of labetalol, is approximately 4 times as potent as a beta adrenergic receptor blocker as the parent racemate, but is only one-third as potent in blocking alpha receptors. The present report describes its antihypertensive and hemodynamic actions. SCH 19927 and labetalol lowered blood pressure in hypertensive rats and dogs. SCH 19927 was somewhat more effective at lower doses, but the two agents produced comparable responses at higher doses. Both reduced blood pressure and peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output in anesthetized dogs. Intraarterial injection in to the femoral vascular bed, either in the presence or absence of neurogenic vasoconstrictor tone, resulted in dose-related vasodilatation. In contrast, alpha blockers, e.g., phentolamine and prazosin, are essentially devoid of vasodilator activity in denervated beds. It is concluded that vasodilatation is largely responsible for the antihypertensive response to labetalol and particularly to SCH 19927. SCH 19927 is a potentially useful agent which would be expected to reduce pressure in humans by two complementary mechanisms, beta blockade and vasodilatation. It should possess less orthostatic potential than labetalol.", 
    "33": "The use of propranolol with multidose potassium cardioplegia was studied in 32 in situ canine hearts subjected to 90 minutes of global ischemia at 15 degrees C and 60 minutes of reperfusion at 37 degrees C. All hearts received potassium (37 mEq/l) every 30 minutes during ischemia. There were four groups of equal size: group 1 received no propranolol, group 2 received low-dose propranolol and group 3 received high-dose propranolol. Group 4 received high-dose propranolol only with the initial potassium infusion. Myocardial CO2 (PmCO2) was monitored by mass spectrometry as an indicator of metabolic activity. An intraventricular balloon was used to measure isovolumic developed pressure, maximal dP/dt and end-diastolic pressure (EDP) before and after ischemia. During ischemia, peak PmCO2 was significantly higher in group 1 (45.6 +/- 2.8 mm Hg) than in groups 2, 3 and 4 (35.2 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, 33.4 +/- 2.8 mm Hg and 30.4 +/0 2.8 mm Hg, respectively) (p less than 0.05). There were no differences between the four groups in systolic ventricular function assessed by developed pressure and dP/dt. Hearts that received high-dose propranolol had significantly lower EDP after 60 minutes of reperfusion (group 3 13.3 +/- 1.5 mm Hg, group 4 10.4 +/0 1.5 mm Hg) compared with group 1 hearts (25.3 +/- 3.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Hearts in groups 3 and 4 exhibited less ischemic injury as assessed by electron microscopy than hearts in groups 1 and 2. These data show that propranolol added to multidose potassium cardioplegia reduced metabolic activity during ischemia and improved ventricular compliance during reperfusion without depressing systolic function. Because left ventricular compliance and morphologic preservation were similar in groups 3 and 4, it appears that a single high dose of propranolol is sufficient and that subsequent doses do not further enhance the beneficial effects.", 
    "34": "Atenolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was given as the sole hypotensive drug for 8-12 weeks to 20 patients with hypertension of varying degrees of severity. Initial systolic blood pressure ranged from 162-238 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM 196 +/- 5.5 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure ranged from 105-143 mm Hg (118 +/- 2.5 mm Hg). Three patients had accelerated hypertension, six had cardiomegaly with recent exertional dyspnea and three were diabetics. Atenolol, 100-300 mg once daily, controlled both the supine and standing blood pressure and markedly attenuated the initial hypertensive response to severe exercise. In 17 patients (85%), atenolol therapy reduced blood pressure more than 20/10 mm Hg; however, adequate blood pressure control was not achieved in severe hypertension. A significant hypotensive action developed within 2 weeks of treatment, and control of hypertension was maintained for 2 weeks after sudden interruption of therapy. No patient had postural or postexercise hypotension. The drug appeared to exert its maximum hypotensive effect at the 100-mg dosage. The magnitude of the hypotensive response was related to the initial systolic blood pressure (r = 0.77, p less than 0.01) and the degree of inhibition of exercise tachycardia (r = 0.66, p less than 0.01). The atenolol plasma level and its hypotensive action were not related. Except for impairment of glucose tolerance in diabetic patients, atenolol had minimal side effects.", 
    "35": "Postextrasystolic (PES) relaxation of the left ventricle was studied in 24 anesthetized dogs using the time constant (tau) of the left ventricular isovolumic pressure decline as an index of global relaxation velocity. Using programmed atrial stimulation and a control RR interval of 500 msec, the \"coupling interval/compensatory pause\" was varied from 400/600 msec to 250/750 msec, and left ventricular pressure-segment length data from control beats were compared with data from PES beats. Contractile state and fractional shortening increased in the PES beat, but the relaxation time constant remained unchanged (control, 35 +/- 3 msec; PES at 250/750 msec, 36 +/- 3 msec) (p = NS). Pretreatment with propranolol did not qualitatively influence these results. Isoproterenol and calcium were given in doses sufficient to increase the time derivative of isovolumic pressure (maximal positive dP/dt) by an amount equal to that obtained with PES potentiation (approximately 50%); isoproterenol produced a substantial decrease in the relaxation time constant (38 +/- 4 to 30 +/- 6 msec, p less than 0.01), whereas calcium administration produced only a small decrease in the time constant (30 +/- 5 to 27 +/- 5 msec, p less than 0.05). Thus, in the intact dog heart, some positive inotropic interventions augment contraction and speed relaxation, but PES potentiation of contraction is not associated with a change in relaxation velocity.", 
    "36": "We used standard microelectrode techniques to study the effects of histamine on right atrial tissues from patients undergoing corrective cardiac surgery. In the 10(-6) to 10(-4) M range, histamine increased maximum diastolic potential, action potential amplitude, and automaticity. In some preparations, histamine also induced delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. The potency of histamine in increasing automaticity was about 10 times less than that of epinephrine. Propranolol (2 x 10(-7)M), which abolished the chronotropic effect of epinephrine, did not alter the effect of histamine. Conversely, the effect of histamine but not that of epinephrine was antagonized by cimetidine (3 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-5) M). This suggests that H2 receptors mediate the chronotropic effects of histamine on the human heart. The slow channel blocker verapamil (2 x 10(-8) to 2 x 10(-6) M) counteracted the effects of histamine on automaticity, delayed afterdepolarizations, and triggered activity, suggesting that in human atrium histamine may act by increasing slow inward (presumably Ca2+) current. If one considers these arrhythmogenic effects of histamine and the fact that human cardiac tissue contains large amounts of histamine, our experiments lend further support to the concept that histamine release can induce arrhythmias.", 
    "37": "In a cross-over study the diurnal effects of metoprolol 0.22 mg mounted on ophthalmic rods and timolol eye drops (0.5%) was compared with respect to intraocular pressure, heart rate and blood pressure. Eleven glaucoma patients, 56-80 years old, were treated. No significant difference in ocular hypotensive action was disclosed between these two agents. The median or mean percentage hypotensive effect of both agents did not exceed 26%. The maximum pressure reduction occurred during the first 4 h after treatment. Both agents appeared to influence the heart rate and mean arterial pressure 1-4 h after ocular application. The administration of 0.22 mg metoprolol on ophthalmic rods produces seemingly a similar effect on intraocular pressure, blood pressure and heart rate as one eye drop of 3% metoprolol.", 
    "38": "The present study evaluated the hemodynamic effects produced by the intravenous infusion of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg over 10 minutes) and the simultaneous inhalation of 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen administered to 19 patients with coronary artery disease who were receiving chronic propranolol therapy (106 +/- 67 mg/day). In addition, hemodynamic changes produced by direct laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea were measured. Data during the induction of anesthesia were compared to measurements obtained in a previously reported group of similar patients anesthetized in the same manner but not receiving propranolol. In the present study, as in previously observed patients not receiving propranolol, induction of anesthesia with diazepam-nitrous oxide did not result in any significant change from awake measurements with respect to heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), or rate-pressure product (RPP). Cardiovascular responses were similar in patients with awake resting heart rates greater than 70 beats per minute (nine patients) and less than 70 beats pr minute (10 patients). This suggests that propranolol does not alter the benign hemodynamic effects produced by this type of induction of anesthesia. Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation significantly (p less than 0.01) increased MAP at 1 minute and HR and RPP at 1 and 2 minutes after the start of laryngoscopy. These changes were transient, returning to control values within 3 minutes after intubation. Patients with awake resting HR less than 70 beats per minute had greater increases in HR and RPP at 1 minute than did patients with resting HR greater than 70 beats per minute (p less than 0.05). This suggests that propranolol even in doses adequate to produce significant slowing of HR in awake patients does not ensure protection against increases in HR and MAP associated with laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea.", 
    "39": "A comparison of the diurnal effects of timolol 0.5% and metoprolol 3.0% eye drops on the intraocular pressure, blood pressure and heart rate in 10 glaucoma patients was performed in a double-masked cross-over study. Both agents produced a significant ocular hypotensive effect for more than 12 h. Timolol appeared to be more potent after 4 and 7 h. No significant difference in hypotensive action was present between timolol and metoprolol 1, 12 and 24 h after treatment. The mean arterial pressure was significantly lowered after 1 and 4 h with timolol and after 1 h during metoprolol therapy. Both agents reduced the heart rate after 1 h. Measurements of plasma concentration of ocular applied timolol and metoprolol showed in 4 patients levels of plasma timolol high enough to induce minimal systemic beta-blockade.", 
    "40": "Thirty-one patients with moderate and severe essential hypertension completed a comparative study of oxdralazine and dihydralazine. Treatments were administered for a 6-month period. The therapeutic regimen also included diuretic and a beta-blocking agent given at a constant daily dose. After a 4-week run-in period on diuretic plus beta blocker, which caused a mean blood pressure reduction of 17/7 mmHg, the administration of the vasodilators produced a further, more marked decrease of pressure values. After 1-month treatment mean blood pressure reductions were 26/18 mmHg on oxdralazine and 16/11 mmHg on dihydralazine. After 6 months, 10/15 patients on oxdralazine and 7/16 patients on dihydralazine had achieved a stabile diastolic pressure below 95 mmHg. These results were confirmed by an additional phase of the study, in which 21 patients had the vasodilator cross-over and were observed for a second 6-mont period. Oxdralazine and dihydralazine therapy were well tolerated: only a few patients complained of side effects that were of mild intensity and never required any change in treatment. At the first visit after the cross-over, those patients changing from oxdralazine to dihydralazine complained of side effects with a higher frequency than the patients changing from dihydralazine to oxdralazine. In one patient from the former group it was necessary to stop dihydralazine treatment.", 
    "41": "Ten hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients were given chlorpromazine alone and chlorpromazine plus high dose propranolol in two 7-week treatment periods according to a randomized crossover design. In the six patients who completed the whole study, plasma levels of chlorpromazine and chlorpromazine sulphoxide, total serum levels of neuroleptic and serum levels of prolactin were consistently and significantly elevated during treatment with chlorpromazine plus propranolol relative to levels during treatment with chlorpromazine alone. These effects are sufficient to explain previously reported clinical improvement in schizophrenic patients given propranolol in addition to neuroleptics.", 
    "42": "Fifty-three hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients were treated with either propranolol, chlorpromazine or placebo in a double-blind randomized trials for up to three months. Propranolol in a usual dose of 640 mg/day, produced marked cardiovascular effects but no improvement in schizophrenic symptomatology relative to placebo. The effects of chlorpromazine were small and inconsistent.", 
    "43": "1 A double-blind cross over study was carried out to assess the effects of the combination of nifedipine and propranolol in 25 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris at beta-adrenoceptor blockade. 2 Efficacy was judged objectively by a standardized exercise protocol using a bicycle ergometer and subjectively by patient assessment of anginal attack rate. 3 The combination of nifedipine and propranolol was shown to be effective with an increase in exercise time to angina and an increase in physical work capacity expressed in terms of calculated maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max). There was an associated reduction in anginal attack rate. 4 The synergistic effect was even more pronounced after reduction in propranolol dosage to 50% of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking dose, reflecting the myocardial depressant effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in these patients with coronary heart disease, some of whom had poor left ventricular function.", 
    "44": "1 The hypotensive effect of single daily dosing with 80 mg penbutolol was compared to 100 mg hydrochlorothiazide and placebo in a double-blind cross-over controlled trial with daily home measurements in ten hypertensive patients. 2 Penbutolol, 80 mg once a day, reduced significantly the supine and standing blood pressure. 3 This hypotensive effect was more potent than hydrochlorothiazide 100 mg particularly in the evening. 4 The hypotensive effect remained for 24 h as shown by the evening (14 h after dose) and morning (24 h after dose) blood pressure readings. 5 No relevant subjective or physical side effects were recorded. There was no significant change nor individual noticeable variation in biochemical data during penbutolol treatment. However, during hydrochlorothiazide treatment, the expected electrolyte changes were observed (symptom-free hypokalemia and hyperuricemia). 6 Penbutolol serum concentration showed no cumulation after one month of treatment. 7 Sudden withdrawal of penbutolol after 1 month of therapy resulted in a slow return to baseline blood pressures over a 2-week period without rebound.", 
    "45": "Two different beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, atenolol and timolol, were separately compared with a placebo in the suppression of essential tremor. In two-week single-blind placebo-controlled studies with cross-over, timolol (5 mg twice daily) and atenolol (100 mg once daily) produced an equal reduction in sitting heart rate and sitting blood pressure. Timolol was effective in reducing tremor while atenolol failed to reduce tremor amplitude. These results indicate that essential tremor can be reduced but not blocked, by the adrenergic blocker timolol with both beta 1 and beta 2 blocking properties; but not by the relatively selective beta 1 blocking drug atenolol. Possibly, the tremor reduction is medicated by a peripheral effect on beta 2 adrenoreceptors.", 
    "46": "The mechanism whereby renal nerves influence the renin-release response to aortic constriction was examined in a nonfiltering ureter-occluded kidney preparation in anesthetized dogs. The kidney was rendered nonfiltering by a combination of mannitol infusion and ureteral occlusion. Suprarenal aortic constriction reduced renal perfusion pressure to 61 +/- 7 mmHg and increased renin release from 16.7 +/- 4.1 to 26.1 +/- 6.0 U/min. At normal renal perfusion pressure, low-frequency renal nerve stimulation (0.25 Hz) increased renin release by 11.6 +/- 4.2 to 25.1 +/- 7.6 U/min. The effect of combined low-level renal nerve stimulation and aortic constriction on renin release was additive; renin release increased by 24.6 +/- 6.5 to 39.5 +/- 7.3 U/min. Propranolol or metoprolol, administered intrarenally at 2 microgram . min-1 . kg-1, abolished the renin-release response to low-level renal nerve stimulation at normal renal perfusion pressure. These data provide evidence that low-frequency renal nerve stimulation influences the renin-release response to reduction in renal perfusion pressure in a nonfiltering ureter-occluded kidney with an inoperative macula densa receptor mechanism. The neural effect on renin release at normal renal perfusion pressure is mediated via beta 1-adrenoceptors probably located on the juxtaglomerular granular cells.", 
    "47": "Ten patients who received hypotensive anesthesia for surgical correction of a cerebral aneurysm were pretreated for 1 day with propranolol. In the awake state, before start of anesthesia, mean arterial pressure was 91 +/- 3 torr and plasma renin activity 3.0 +/- 0.1 ng/ml/hr. Thirty minutes after the induction of anesthesia mean arterial pressure decreased to 79 +/- 2 torr and plasma renin activity increased to 3.5 +/- 0.1 ng/ml/hr. There was no further significant change in either measurement with surgical stimulation. During sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension (the dose used was 0.35 +/- 0.02 mg/kg) mean arterial pressure was reduced to 53 +/- 2 torr, and plasma renin activity increased to 8.8 +/- 0.9 ng/ml/hr. Heart rate did not change. Discontinuation of sodium nitroprusside resulted in a gradual reduction of plasma renin activity to the awake level and concurrent gradual increase in mean arterial pressure to its basal anesthetic value. When compared with previous work, these results indicate that propranolol attenuates nitroprusside-induced renin release, reduces the dosage of nitroprusside required to induce hypotension, suppresses reflex tachycardia, and prevents overshoot hypertension on discontinuation of nitroprusside.", 
    "48": "The role of renal prostaglandins and the adrenergic nervous system in the control of renin release was studied in conscious dogs with thoracic caval constriction. Indomethacin reduced plasma renin activity (PRA) in intact animals with thoracic caval constriction by 43% but failed to change PRA after surgical renal denervation and during chronic propranolol administration; adrenergic blockade reduced the initial control level of PRA before indomethacin from 15 to 4 ng angiotensin I/ml per hr. Renal hemodynamic function was markedly reduced by indomethacin both before and after adrenergic blockade. These observations indicate that prostaglandins are involved in the control of renin release, but they appear to have a more important role in the control of renal arterial resistance. The adrenergic nervous system also plays a role in the hyperreninemia of caval constriction and, possibly, a greater role than the renal prostaglandins. In the first experimental design, surgical renal denervation and daily oral propranolol administration in dogs with caval constriction reduced PRA to normal in two of seven dogs and a natriuresis occurred. In four of the five remaining animals, PRA fell, but not to normal, and renal sodium excretion failed to increase. In a second experimental design, the kidneys were denervated and propranolol was given before the dogs were subjected to caval constriction and propranolol was continued for 5 days; PRA increased markedly, sodium retention occurred, and ascites formed. Under these circumstances, compensatory mechanisms secondary to caval constriction led to increased PRA in spite of adrenergic blockade.", 
    "49": "Determination of tear lysozyme, alfa-1-antitrypsin and serum albumin was performed in the tear fluid of 24 glaucoma patients on maintenance treatment with timolol. In 7 patients with symptoms of dry eye decreased levels of tear lysozyme and increased levels of alfa-1-antitrypsin and serum albumin were disclosed in contrast to 17 timolol treated patients without dry eyes and to healthy controls. The timolol treated patients with ocular dryness also showed hyperosmolality of tear fluid, abnormal corneal staining with rose bengal and decreased break-up time and Schirmer-I-test. It is concluded that decreased concentration of tear lysozyme in glaucoma patients on topical treatment with timolol may indicate some impairment of the tear gland function provoked by the treatment.", 
    "50": "Until recently acute renal failure in scleroderma has been uniformly fatal. Since 1973 there have been several reports of successful treatment by peritoneal and haemodialysis and nephrectomy, sometimes followed by renal transplantation. During the past few years there have been several reports of patients managed successfully with drug treatment. The present paper reports on a patient with scleroderma who is clinically well with stable renal function with drug treatment three years after the onset of acute renal impairment and hypertension. Other similar cases are reviewed.", 
    "51": "Recovery from acute hypoglycaemia induced by the injection of insulin has been examined in six human subjects under control conditions, under non-selective beta blockade (propranolol) and under selective beta 1 blockade (metoprolol). The normal blood glucose recovery was biphasic with an initial rapid and a slower subsequent phase of recovery. The early recovery mechanism was unaffected by either form of beta blockade, but with propranolol the late phase of recovery was significantly prolonged. Rises in blood lactate and plasma free fatty acids following hypoglycaemia were markedly reduced by propranolol but to a much lesser degree with metoprolol. The counterregulatory hormonal responses of glucagon, cortisol and growth hormone were augmented appropriately for the prolonged hypoglycaemia associated with propranolol. Non-selective beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol is associated with an impairment of the late phase of blood glucose recovery from hypoglycaemia. The possible mechanisms of this impairment are discussed.", 
    "52": "The effect of aspirin (ASP), chlorpromazine (CPZ), diphenoxylate (DP), ethylene glycol tetraacetate (EGTA), hydrocortisone (HC), loperamide (LPA), methylprednisolone (MP), phenotolamine mesylate (PTM), propranolol (PR), and trifluoperazine (TPZ) on the secretory activity induced by Escherichia coli heat-stable (ST) enterotoxin in infant mice was studied. LPA and DP, which are used therapeutically for diarrhea, did not inhibit the effect of ST enterotoxin; MP and HC, known inhibitors of cholera enterotoxin, and two adrenergic agents (PR and PTM) had no effect on ST-induced secretory activity. TPZ, EGTA, ASP, and CPZ caused a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in the secretory activity induced by ST enterotoxin, CPZ, EGTA, and TPZ inhibited secretory activity induced by 8-bromoguanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphoric acid (8-BrcGMP), a cGMP analog.", 
    "53": "We examined the effects of changes in pH, Ca2+ concentration, diltiazem, nitroglycerin, and propranolol on the vascular tone of the isolated rabbit coronary artery. Stepwise increase in pH of the bath fluid caused pH-dependent increased vascular tone. Increase in Ca2+ concentration of the bath fluid also resulted in increased vascular tone, while removal of Ca2+ abolished the high pH-induced elevated vascular tone. Diltiazem and nitroglycerin suppressed the high pH-induced increased vascular tone. Propranolol in high concentrations exhibited a direct inhibitory effect on the high pH-induced increased vascular tone. We conclude that high pH induces coronary vasoconstriction principally by increasing transmembrane influx of Ca2+ and that diltiazem and nitroglycerin suppress this action.", 
    "54": "The influence of lactation on beta-adrenergic receptor kinetics was studied with adipocytes from eight Holstein cows during two physiological states, dry period 30 days prepartum and 30 days postpartum or early lactation. Physiological state had no effect on binding kinetics of (--)-hydrogen-3 labeled dihydroalprenolol. Affinity rate constants (8.2 versus 7.2 X 10(7) min-1 M-1) and equilibrium dissociation constants (7.1 versus 7.9 nM) for both prepartum and postpartum periods were similar. In contrast, the apparent number of beta-adrenergic receptors varied with lactational state (42,154 versus 72,264 sites/cell) for dry and lactating status as estimated in assays containing 5 nM (--)-hydrogen-3 dihydroalprenolol. Glycerol release and adipocyte concentrations of adenosine-3',5'-cyclic phosphoric acid were assayed with or without 10 microM epinephrine. Epinephrine elicited greater release of glycerol in adipocytes from lactating than dry cows (3.91 versus 2.1 mumol/10(6) cells/120 min). The concentration of adenosine-3',5'-cyclic phosphoric acid rose during the first 5 min of incubation in the presence of epinephrine and then fell to base after 10 min. Maximum concentrations at 5 min were not different in adipocytes from dry and lactating cows (250 versus 280 pmol/10(6) cells).", 
    "55": "Guinea-pig isolated hearts were perfused in series, the donor heart perfusate supplying the recipient heart. Isoprenaline increased the rate and force of contraction and oxygen consumption of donor hearts and produced a coronary vasodilatation. This was accompanied by the release of vasodilator metabolite as demonstrated by vasodilatation of the recipient heart, the beta-adrenoceptors of which were antagonized by propranolol. During arrest of donor hearts by either carbachol or application of a fibrillating current, isoprenaline still released vasodilator metabolite and increased oxygen consumption but without changes in rate or tension. This release was prevented by beta-adrenoceptor blockade. It is concluded that the sympathomimetic-induced coronary vasodilatation is mediated via the release of a vasoactive metabolite, the trigger for which is not the concomitant mechanical hyperactivity.", 
    "56": "We have investigated the residual contractile response to noradrenaline remaining after phenoxybenzamine (3 x 10(-7) mol/l) in rabbit aorta, since it has been reported that phenoxybenzamine at low doses completely and irreversibly blocks alpha 1-but not alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The contraction elicited by noradrenaline slowly recovered with time after it had been almost abolished by phenoxybenzamine. This residual response was blocked by the alpha 1-selective antagonist prazosin (3 x 10(-8) mol/l) but not by the alpha 2-selective antagonist rauwolscine (3 x 10(-7) mol/l). The results confirm that the smooth muscle of rabbit aorta contains alpha 2-but not alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "57": "beta-adrenergic binding ([3H]dihydroalprenolol), adenylate cyclase activity, and cAMP accumulation were measured in adipocytes to investigate whether the mechanism of decreased hormone-sensitive lipolytic response with age was mediated through membrane-associated events. The dose of epinephrine required for half maximal stimulation of glycerol release (ED50) was significantly lower in 2-month-old rats (0.8 +/- 0.2 microM)than in matur (6- and 12-month-old) rats (5.2 +/- 1.5 and 6.2 +/- 1.5 microM, respectively). In 24-month-old rats the ED50 (0.7 +/- 0.2 microM) was less than in mature rats. maximum rates of hormone-stimulated glycerol release (per 10(6) cells) was highest in the two mature groups and decreased by 50% in the old rats (P less than 0.01). Lipolytic changes were independent of cell size. beta-adreanergic raeceptor number (50-90 thousand sites/call) and affinity (KD 4-5 nM) were the same in each age group. ED50 and maximum level of hormone-stimulated adenylatae cyclase activity did not change with age. The ED50 of cAMP accumulation of young rats was 3 +/- 5 microM compared with 24 +/- 4 and 25 +/- 5 microM in 6- and 12-month-old rats, respectively. In old rats, the ED50 of cAMP accumulation was 2 +/- 1 microM (P less than 0.001 compared with mature rats). Maximally stimulated cAMP levels were the same in old and mature animals. Phosphodiesterase activity in the presence and absence of 10(-5) M isoproterenol did not change with age. The results suggest that age-related decrease of epinephrine-sensitive lipolysis in old rats may be due to alterations of the lipolytic pathway distal to the receptor-adenylate cyclase complex and the generation of cyclic AMP.", 
    "58": "beta 2-Stimulant are at present the most effective tocolytic agents. The purpose of this paper is to outline the beta 1-, beta 2-effects of ritodrine in animal experiments. 1) In the pregnant rat uterus at term, ritodrine and terbutaline showed the potent effect. The c-GMP level in the bath medium was significantly decreased by the administration of ritodrine, while the c-AMP levels was significantly increased. 2) When the changes in the maternal serum c-AMP and c-GMP levels after the administration of ritodrine were examined, these results coincided with those obtained experiments in vitro. But decreased in c-AMP and c-GMP levels by administering beta-blocker. The c-AMP and c-GMP levels of placenta, liver, uterus and fetus showed similar patterns, especially c-AMP in the uterine and fetal tissues increased when ritodrine was administered. 3) The administration of ritodrine and terbutaline at the last trimester of pregnancy led to the increased, showing dose-response relationship, in the heart rate of mother and fetus in rabbits. 4) The effect of ritodrine on fetal and neonatal serum glucose concentrations was examined in rats. Sustained hypoglycemia was observed in fetus and neonate delivered within 18 hours of the termination of administration (ritodrine, 10-20 mg, sc)."
