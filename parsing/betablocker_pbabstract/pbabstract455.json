    "0": "The interaction between metoprolol and bromazepam and lorazepam was studied in 12 healthy male volunteers aged 21-37 years. Metoprolol had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of bromazepam or lorazepam. However, bromazepam AUC was 35% higher in the presence of metoprolol. Bromazepam enhanced the effect of metoprolol on systolic blood pressure but not on diastolic blood pressure or pulse rate. Lorazepam had no effect on either blood pressure or pulse. Metoprolol did not enhance the effect of bromazepam on the psychomotor tests used in this study. Metoprolol caused a small increase in critical flicker fusion threshold with lorazepam but had no effect on the other tests. Lorazepam (2 mg) was more potent than bromazepam (6 mg) in the doses used in this study. The interaction of metoprolol with bromazepam and lorazepam is unlikely to be of clinical significance. No change in dose is necessary when using these drugs together.", 
    "1": "Effects of commonly used antihypertensive agents like nifedipine, atenolol, propranolol and captopril on quality of life was studied. Fourty-four patients with essential hypertension entered and 26 completed the full protocol of the study. Each drug was given separately in a random fashion in fixed dosage for 4 weeks with a washout period of 2 weeks in between the drugs. Assessment of quality of life was done under following measures: satisfaction with life and sense of well being, physical state, emotional state, intellectual function, social life and sexual life; each assessed on a prestandardized 5 point scale. All the 4 drugs resulted in significant and similar blood pressure control but the incidence of adverse effects was maximum with nifedipine (40.9%), followed by atenolol (18.4%), propranolol (14.3%) and captopril (3.6%). There was significant improvement in various aspects of quality of life with all the 4 drugs. Captopril and propranolol scored significantly better than atenolol and nifedipine on measures like sense of well being and satisfaction with life, physical state, intellectual function and emotional state. Improvement in sexual life was maximum with captopril, moderate with propranolol and nifedipine and least with atenolol. In conclusion, captopril closely followed by propranolol was the most acceptable drug with fewer adverse effects and improved sexual as well as other aspects of quality of life compared to nifedipine and atenolol.", 
    "2": "The effect of d- and l-enantiomers of propranolol on desipramine-induced anti-immobility effects and on brain desipramine levels was studied in the rat. Intraperitoneal propranolol and desipramine were administered three times, 25, 6, 2 and 24, 5, 1 h respectively, before the test. It was found that l-propranolol but not d-propranolol, at the same doses (2.5 and 5 mg/kg), antagonized 20 mg/kg desipramine without altering desipramine brain levels. It is suggested that blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors rather than membrane-stabilizing or pharmacokinetic effects is responsible for the antagonism of propranolol toward desipramine.", 
    "3": "A unique type of limbic seizures, maximal dentate activation, was used to examine the effects of cholinergic and adrenergic agents on the processes involved in epileptogenesis. The time to onset of maximal dentate activation was used to monitor the initiation of seizures while the duration of maximal dentate activation monitored termination of seizures. The cholinergic agonist pilocarpine shortened maximal dentate activation at 20 mg/kg and lengthened maximal dentate activation at 50 mg/kg, while both doses delayed the onset of maximal dentate activation. Atropine, a cholinergic antagonist, at 50 mg/kg, slowed the rate of lengthening of maximal dentate activation that occurred with repeated stimulation. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol also slowed the rate of lengthening of maximal dentate activation at 3 mg/kg and shortened maximal dentate activation at 10 mg/kg. The alpha 2-agonist clonidine, at 0.5 mg/kg, shortened maximal dentate activation and increased the time to onset; at 0.1 mg/kg, clonidine did not affect maximal dentate activation. Pretreatment with reserpine had no effect on either the time to onset or duration of maximal dentate activation. These results indicate that both cholinergic and adrenergic mechanisms play important roles in the initiation and termination of limbic seizures.", 
    "4": "In 78 patients with mild or moderate hypertension, effect of acebutolol and hydrochlorothiazide on plasma lipids, lipoproteins, fibrinogen and plasma fibrinolysis time were investigated. 42 patients were treated with acebutolol for 18 months and 36 with hydrochlorothiazide for 24 months. It was shown that neither acebutolol nor hydrochlorothiazide induced significant alterations in investigated biochemical risk factors. The possible causes of controversy encountered in literature and analysis of factors which may influence the character and severity of metabolic disorders resulting from antihypertensive therapy were discussed.", 
    "5": "1. Long Evans rats were chronically instrumented with intravascular catheters and pulsed Doppler probes to assess changes in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters blood flows and vascular conductances in response to bombesin (2.5 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) and cholecystokinin (CCK) (0.5 and 5.0 micrograms kg-1, i.v.). 2. Bombesin caused an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, together with a transient renal vasoconstriction and prolonged mesenteric vasodilatation; there was an early hindquarters vasodilatation followed by vasoconstriction. 3. In the presence of phentolamine, bombesin caused a fall in blood pressure due to enhanced hindquarters vasodilatation; these effects were reversed by propranolol and hence were possibly due to circulating adrenaline acting on vasodilator beta 2-adrenoceptors. 4. During concurrent administration of phentolamine, propranolol and atropine, bombesin caused prolonged tachycardia and a rise in blood pressure. The renal vasoconstrictor and mesenteric vasodilator effects of bombesin were not reduced under these conditions and thus probably were direct and/or indirect non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) effects. 5. CCK caused dose-dependent increases in blood pressure accompanied by renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vasoconstriction followed, after the higher dose, by vasodilatations. The lower dose of CCK increased heart rate but there was a bradycardia followed by a tachycardia after the higher dose. 6. Experiments with antagonists as described above indicated the pressor effect of CCK was mediated largely through alpha-adrenoceptors, as were the mesenteric and hindquarters vasoconstrictor effects; CCK exerted NANC negative chronotropic effects. 7. All the effects of CCK were markedly inhibited by L364,718. This observation, and the finding that L364,718 had no effect on the responses to bombesin, together with the dissimilarities in the regional haemodynamic effects of exogenous CCK and bombesin, indicate that the cardiovascular actions of the latter were not dependent on the release of endogenous CCK.", 
    "6": "This double-blind randomized, crossover study was undertaken to determine the pharmacokinetic properties of nifedipine retard and atenolol when given separately, as a free or a fixed combination, compared with placebo in 15 healthy male volunteers. There was no difference between the three atenolol formulations in time to maximum blood concentration or elimination half-life. The fixed combination showed significant differences in both maximum observed blood concentrations (+16 per cent) and total area under the curve (+16 per cent) compared to atenolol alone. Urinary recovery of unchanged drug from the fixed combination was also slightly increased but the difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, statistical evaluation of the plasma pharmacokinetics of nifedipine retard and urinary recovery of nifedipine metabolite showed that all three formulations were indistinguishable. Thus, it is concluded that the fixed combination of nifedipine and atenolol is bioequivalent to the free combination and that the bioavailability of both drugs in the fixed combination is equivalent to that of the single entities.", 
    "7": "Endothelin-1 elicited a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect on the isolated rabbit, guinea pig, and rat, but not on the dog ventricular myocardium. The duration of isometric contractions was prolonged by endothelin-1 in a concentration-dependent manner, mainly by prolongation of relaxation time. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (a tumor-promoting phorbol ester) inhibited the positive inotropic effect of endothelin-1, as well as myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation at low concentrations (10(-9) mol/l and above) without (10(-8) mol/l) or less (10(-7) mol/l) affecting the basal force of contraction, and the positive inotropic effect of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The present findings indicate that endothelin elicits a positive inotropic effect on mammalian ventricular myocardium, the characteristics of which are very similar to those of myocardial alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "8": "Effects of 1% anaprilin instillations on intraocular pressure, ocular hydro- and hemodynamics, anterior chamber depth, pupil width, ocular functions, systemic arterial pressure and pulse rate were studied in 57 patients (94 eyes) with primary open-angle glaucoma. Anaprilin has shown a manifest hypotensive effect, explained by depression of aqueous humor production. The drug did not influence the visual functions, pupil width, or anterior chamber depth. A synergic effect on intraocular pressure was observed when anaprilin was combined with pilocarpine or clopheline.", 
    "9": "The objective of this study was to determine whether the corneal penetration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) could be altered by prodrugs. The prodrugs studied included various 1-alkoxy-carbonyl 5-FU derivatives as well as an 1-acyloxymethyl and an 3-acyl derivative. Corneal penetration of 5-FU and its prodrugs was evaluated over 180 min using the isolated albino rabbit cornea in the modified Ussing chamber. 5-FU and its prodrugs were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC. Corneal penetration of 5-FU was very poor due to its low lipophilicity and extensive metabolism during penetration. There was no conclusive evidence for carrier-mediated transport. The corneal epithelium offered the main diffusional and metabolic resistance. Prodrugs of 5-FU with improved lipophilicity dramatically increased the corneal penetration of 5-FU, suggesting that a much reduced dose of 5-FU could be used if corneal penetration and aqueous levels are necessary. It is anticipated that a similar lower dose of prodrug would be required should the prodrug also improve the diffusion of 5-FU across the sclera following subconjunctival injection. Whether dose reduction will lead to reduced corneal toxicity in glaucoma filtration surgery following topical or subconjunctival dosing is an interesting therapeutic opportunity that remains to be determined. In addition to enhancing 5-FU penetration, prodrugs also protected 5-FU from metabolism even though they were rapidly and quantitatively converted to 5-FU during penetration. Protection of 5-FU from metabolism in the cornea may be advantageous from the standpoint of sparing the cornea from toxicity caused by 5-FU, be it from topical or subconjunctival dosing.", 
    "10": "Regular drug treatment in mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90-104 mm Hg) reduces death from stroke, and other non-coronary vascular events. The optimum strategy remains sequential monotherapy with the lowest effective dose, with drug combinations as an option. A beta-adrenoceptor blocker or low-dose thiazide is good value treatment for many patients. beta-Blockers are good for young (under 50 years), anxious non-smoking men, men after myocardial infarction, and renal failure patients. Older persons over about 65 years, women, smokers, stroke victims, and liver disease patients should generally take a thiazide or calcium ion-channel blocker. Pregnant women and untreated gouty patients should avoid diuretics. Calcium blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferable in severe or insulin-dependent diabetes and renal failure, and angiotensin manipulators or thiazides in heart failure or peripheral vessel disease. Hyperlipidaemia should not generally exclude thiazides or beta-blockers. Some hypertensive stroke patients without encephalopathy may not need antihypertensive drug treatment for the first 24-48 hours. Drug treatment should be tailored to individuals according to their general condition, physiological age, and any concurrent disease or medication. Unwanted drug reactions should not deter patients from fulfilling social and economic goals. The desired treatment end-point is a diastolic pressure of 85-89 mm Hg, but a compromise is usual in poorly motivated young men, and the elderly.", 
    "11": "Befunolol (BF) reductase with 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, which was purified from rabbit liver, catalyzed the oxidoreduction of prostaglandins, indicating that this enzyme has broad substrate specificities for endogenous substances. BF reductase was strongly inhibited by a variety of nonsteridal anti-inflammatory drugs and then a significant correlation was observed between the logarithms of IC50 (concentration required to produce 50% inhibition of BF reductase activity) values and the maximal daily human doses for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These results suggest that the pharmacological potency of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be predicted from the degree of inhibition of BF reductase by these drugs.", 
    "12": "In superfused left atria from male guinea pigs, rats, and rabbits, myocardial contractility was measured before and after addition of acetylcholine (ACh) and AF-DX 116 ((11[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]-acetyl]-5,11-dihydro- 6H-pyrido[2,3-b] [1,4]benzodiazepine-6-) one), a selective muscarinic antagonist. Characteristic dose-response curves for acetylcholine showing greater negative inotropic response with dose were seen. Increasing AF-DX 116 concentrations reversed the negative inotropy of acetylcholine and, in fact, increased the inotropic response approximately 100% and 50% above the baseline contractile force in a dose-dependent manner in the guinea pig and rabbit, respectively. This increase in contractility following AF-DX 116 addition was not observed in rat atria. The capacity of AF-DX 116 to produce the positive inotropic response only occurred at concentrations above 1 x 10(-5) M. The positive inotropic response of AF-DX 116 was antagonized by dl-propranolol, which suggests that the administration of AF-DX 116 at higher concentrations may unmask the effect of norepinephrine released from underlying viable adrenergic terminals which exist in the left atria.", 
    "13": "Time course changes in antianginal effect were evaluated for obsidan, corinfar and finoptin under 12-week administration in 104 patients with stable angina pectoris. The response to finoptin appeared to rise while for obsidan and corinfar it was stable. Some patients with stable angina developed clinical tolerance to corinfar.", 
    "14": ".25% Bupranolol in an oily solution decreases corneal sensitivity statistically significant from the 3. to the 15. minute after the application. The maximum of decrease is found between the 6. and the 15. minute in contrast to beta-blockers in aqueous solution (1.-3. minute). The topical subjective compatibility of 0.25% Bupranolol equals that of preserved 0.5% Timolol.", 
    "15": "To evaluate the validity of the Rosenblueth-Simeone model for the heart rate response to incremental dynamic exercise, 11 healthy men performed maximal exercise tests on a cycle ergometer after administration of placebo, propranolol, atropine or both propranolol and atropine. The model showed that the influence of sympathetic activity on heart rate increased at intensities up to those which resulted in a heart rate 70% maximal heart rate on placebo, and levelled off at higher intensities, while there was a progressive withdrawal of the parasympathetic activity. The ratio between heart rate predicted by the model and the recorded heart rate following placebo treatment tended to be less than 1.0 at lower exercise intensities, and approached the unit at intensities above those which resulted in a heart rate higher than 70% of maximal heart rate on placebo. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.94, P less than 0.01) between the heart rate on placebo and the heart rate estimated by the model. Nevertheless, there was some scattering of the data around the identity line, with a standard error of the estimate for the regression line of 11 beats.min-1. Thus, during incremental exercise, the influence of sympathetic activity on heart rate does not become progressively more important at higher exercise intensities. The application of the Rosenblueth-Simeone model shows limitations during incremental exercise, particularly at low exercise intensities.", 
    "16": "The purpose of the present study was to examine light microscopic data qualitatively as well as quantitatively from an animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy in the turkey. A previous study reported the gross cardioprotective effect of propranolol and the lack of cardioprotection with digoxin in furazolidone-induced cardiomyopathy. It was therefore important to define whether the response of the myocardium to therapeutic interventions differed from the structural responses seen in their absence. In furazolidone-treated birds with resultant cardiac dilation there was myocyte hypertrophy, enlargement of nuclei and reorientation of subepicardial myocardial fibres. Similar changes were noted in birds receiving both furazolidone and digoxin. However, birds receiving propranolol, a non-selective beta-receptor antagonist, and furazolidone did not demonstrate a hypertrophic response or reorientation of fibres. These data indicate that propranolol maintained myocardial morphology and morphometry and thus prevented the structural sequelae of the disease, which is a better achievement of therapy than simple arrest of the progress. A role for intracellular calcium is implied. The cardioprotective effect seen with beta blockade suggests that membrane related events may lead to the contractile dysfunction that results in dilation and cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "17": "Sinus node dysfunction is a recognized problem following surgery for congenital heart disease. Seven postoperative patients with sinus node dysfunction (5 Mustard, 1 tetralogy of Fallot, 1 Fontan) underwent electrophysiology study of sinus node function during combined autonomic blockade (CAB) utilizing propranolol 0.2 mg/kg i.v. and atropine 0.04 mg/kg i.v. to evaluate intrinsic sinus node function isolated from autonomic control. During CAB, intrinsic heart rate, intrinsic corrected sinus node recovery time, and intrinsic sinoatrial recovery time were measured. These results were compared with age-matched normal intrinsic data from our lab [normal (n = 7, mean age 9 years) IHR 128 +/- 24, intrinsic corrected sinus node recovery time 135 +/- 40 ms, intrinsic sinoatrial conduction time 86 +/- 19 ms]. Among postoperative Mustard patients (n = 5, mean age 13 years, mean years postoperative 11) 2 of 5 had clearly abnormal intrinsic sinus node function with nonsinus rhythm during CAB; 3 of 5 had sinus rhythm during CAB with normal or mildly abnormal intrinsic sinus node function. The postoperative case of tetralogy of Fallot (age 20 years, postoperative 14 years) had mildly abnormal intrinsic sinus node electrophysiology study. The postoperative case of Fontan (age 16 years, postoperative 1.5 years) had sinus rhythm at rest but left atrial rhythm during CAB. Different aspects of sinus node dysfunction may be expressed during resting electrophysiology study vs. electrophysiology study utilizing CAB. The pathophysiology of sinus node dysfunction among postoperative pediatric patients is not homogeneous with regard to the contribution of intrinsic sinus node dysfunction. In those patients with normal or mildly abnormal intrinsic sinus node function, an important pathophysiologic influence of the autonomic nervous system is implicated.", 
    "18": "Energy expenditure was determined in 18 patients with Parkinson's disease, 6 healthy volunteers and 6 patients with essential tremor, age-matched, using the indirect calorimetric method which measures the gas exchange rate. The results showed a significant increase in the relative energy expenditure, i.e. the difference between absolute and predictable values from the Harris and Benedict equation, among the parkinsonian patients (+21 +/- 4.1 p. 100; mean +/- S.E.M.) as compared to the 2 control groups (-8.6 +/- 7 p. 100 and -2.1 +/- 4.1 p. 100 respectively; p less than 0.001). There was no correlation between the rate of energy expenditure and the duration or degree of severity of the disease, and particularly the occurrence and magnitude of weight loss, which is frequently observed during the course of the disease. The relative energy expenditure was not significantly different between untreated and treated parkinsonian patients (18.8 +/- 3 p. 100 and 24.5 +/- 6.2 p. 100 respectively). Further investigations were designed to determine whether the increased energy expenditure could reflect a functional impairment of the automatic nervous system. The integrity of the vagus nerve was tested by plotting vs time the plasma Pancreatic Polypeptide levels in response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. A physiological stimulation was obtained in the 8 parkinsonian patients studied. This is not the case in chronic autonomic failure. On the contrary, the relative energy expenditure was significantly decreased in the 6 patients that were given a beta-blocking drug, pindolol, 15 mg daily for 3 weeks (+30.7 +/- 4.3 p. 100 before and +21 +/- 4.2 p. 100 after treatment; p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "The enhancement of model hydrophilic (propranolol hydrochloride) and lipophilic (diazepam) drug penetration across rat and hairless mouse skin in vitro has been studied. Preliminary experiments established that most n-alkanes having chain lengths of between 7 and 16 promote the flux of both drugs. For propranolol, enhancement varied parabolically with carbon number; for diazepam, heptane was ineffective and all others were essentially equipotent. Enhancement by n-nonane was then compared with that by n-nonanol. Propranolol flux was increased by both enhancers, whereas diazepam penetration was not affected by the less lipophilic alcohol. The enhancement of propranolol by n-nonane and n-nonanol was examined as a function of adjuvant concentration in the applied formulation. Maximum increases in maximum penetration rates of 6.5-fold (n-nonane) and 8.2-fold (n-nonanol) were determined. As expected, the enhancement was saturable, indicative of a maximally perturbed stratum corneum. Finally, the penetration enhancing abilities of six monoterpenes were assessed. The purely hydrocarbon analogues promoted both propranolol and diazepam transport to an extent similar to that of n-nonane. The terpenes with hydrogen-bonding ability, however, only enhanced propranolol flux (at a level comparable to n-nonanol). While the data reported do not directly reveal mechanistic information on percutaneous penetration enhancement, they do provide a starting point for the rational investigation of interrelationships between drug, enhancer, and skin. Such information is clearly essential for the optimization and exploitation of transdermal drug delivery.", 
    "20": "To assess the influence of autonomic regulation on automaticity in patients with intrinsic sinus node dysfunction, heart rate responses to autonomic drugs were evaluated in 28 patients with sick sinus syndrome and in 8 normal subjects. Heart rates before and after intravenous administration of isoproterenol (Isp), propranolol, atropine, and methoxamine were measured. To compare the results with electrophysiologic data, heart rate and automaticity recovery time (ART) before and after pharmacologic autonomic blockade (AB) were evaluated. Seventeen patients without syncope showed a similar heart rate response after administration of Isp to that of normal subjects, but 11 patients with syncope showed a significantly lower response than patients without syncope. Responses to atropine and methoxamine were lower and response to propranolol was larger in patients as compared to normal subjects. However, no significant difference was observed between patients with and without syncope. Twelve patients showed severely prolonged max ART exceeding 5000 msec after AB. Seven of them showed preserved response to Isp and max ART before AB was significantly shorter than that after AB. The other 5 patients with lower response to Isp showed no significant change in max ART before and after AB. In conclusion, sympathetic regulation in patients with preserved response to Isp might compensate for the impaired intrinsic automaticity in preventing syncope even in patients with severely impaired intrinsic sinus node function.", 
    "21": "A method for determining pindolol from human serum by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is presented. Pindolol is extracted into methylene chloride from 1 mL of alkalinized serum with a recovery of 87%. The organic layer is evaporated and the residue is reconstituted in mobile phase for injection into the column. Samples are eluted from a 5-micron C18 column (250 x 4.6 mm) with acetonitrile-water containing 0.1% triethylamine, pH adjusted to 3.5 with phosphoric acid (20:80 v/v). Samples as low as 2 ng/mL have been detected.", 
    "22": "Isocapnic dry gas hyperpnea causes bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs that is mediated by release of tachykinins from airway sensory nerves. Exogenous neuropeptides can induce microvascular leak. Therefore we tested whether dry gas hyperpnea also elicits bronchovascular hyperpermeability by measuring Evans blue-labeled albumin extravasation along the airways of mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. We found that 1) room temperature dry gas hyperpnea increased Evans blue extravasation in extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary airways as a specific consequence of local airway heat/water losses, 2) capsaicin pretreatment ablated the bronchoconstrictor response to dry gas hyperpnea and reduced bronchovascular leak only in intrapulmonary airways, 3) phosphoramidon given to capsaicin-pretreated animals partially restored dry gas hyperpnea-induced bronchoconstriction and increased the vascular hyperpermeability response to hyperpnea in intrapulmonary airways, and 4) propranolol administration had no important effects on any of these airway responses. We conclude that dry gas hyperpnea causes bronchovascular hyperpermeability in guinea pigs. Tachykinins have a dominant role in this response in the intrapulmonary airways, although another mechanism may also contribute to the microvascular leak in the extrapulmonary airways.", 
    "23": "Carvedilol 25 mg b.d. was compared with nifedipine s.r. 20 mg b.d. for subchronic treatment of patients with chronic stable angina. After washout and placebo run-in, 163 patients were randomly and double-blindly allocated to one of the two treatment groups. Two symptom-limited seated bicycle exercise tests were performed on placebo in order to confirm stable baseline conditions. After 4 weeks of active treatment, a further exercise test was performed in the morning, 12 h after the preceding dose. Diary cards were kept by the patients throughout the trial in order to record angina attacks and glyceryl trinitrate consumption. Carvedilol seemed to be somewhat more effective than nifedipine s.r. for improving exercise tolerance and exercise time to onset of angina and 1 mm ST-segment depression. Although there were highly statistically significant differences vs placebo, the two treatment groups did not differ significantly. No difference between treatment with carvedilol and nifedipine s.r. was found regarding angina symptoms and glyceryl trinitrate consumption during daily life. Adverse events were less frequently reported in the carvedilol group than in the nifedipine group. Generally, however, both agents were well tolerated. Carvedilol therapy for chronic stable angina seems to be both efficacious and safe.", 
    "24": "The ability of a beta-blocker to inhibit vascular sympathetic nerve activity associated with hypertension was studied in DOCA-salt hypertension in rats. A seven week treatment of DOCA and salt resulted in a significant increase in the systolic blood pressure of the uninephrectomized rats. The administration of propranolol (40 mg/L and 80 mg/L in drinking water) had little effect on the development of hypertension. After a three week administration of propranolol, perfused mesenteric vasculatures were prepared in vitro, and endogenous norepinephrine release as well as vascular responsiveness were examined. Endogenous norepinephrine and pressor responses during periarterial nerve stimulation were greater in the untreated DOCA-salt hypertensive rats than in the normotensive rats. In the DOCA-salt hypertensive rats treated with propranolol, the stimulation-evoked norepinephrine release and pressor responses were significantly attenuated, at both doses, compared with the untreated DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. These results demonstrate that propranolol inhibited the vascular sympathetic nerve activity in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. This occurrence suggests a possible role of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in the regulation of sympathetic tone in DOCA-salt hypertension.", 
    "25": "The effects of pindolol on the prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) responses to intravenous tryptophan (LTP) were studied in eight healthy male volunteers. Pindolol pretreatment (40 mg over 48 h) markedly attenuated the GH response to LTP and modestly, but significantly, reduced the LTP-induced increase in plasma PRL. The disposition of LTP following infusion was not altered by pindolol. While the data are consistent with 5-HT1A receptor mediation of PRL and GH responses to LTP, the intrinsic sympathomimetic actions of pindolol might also be involved in the attenuation of the endocrine responses to LTP.", 
    "26": "We compared the pressure-lowering effects of timolol, pindolol, epinephrine and the mixture of timolol and epinephrine with that of placebo over a 12-h period. All agents reduced the pressure significantly but with varying time courses. The mixture of timolol and epinephrine reduced the pressure significantly more than did timolol or epinephrine alone, especially at 12 h after the last administration of the drops.", 
    "27": "d-Sotalol may be a clinically useful class III antiarrhythmic agent for controlling ventricular arrhythmias in children. Because age-related differences in repolarization currents may contribute to developmental differences in response to antiarrhythmic agents that primarily affect repolarization, the electrophysiologic effects of d-sotalol were compared in Purkinje fibers from neonatal and adult dogs. Significant age-related changes characterized the antiarrhythmic profile of d-sotalol. d-Sotalol (10(-4) M) significantly prolonged the action potential duration of adult Purkinje fibers (310 +/- 8 to 380 +/- 7 ms, p less than 0.01) and neonatal fibers (247 +/- 5 to 342 +/- 9 ms, p less than 0.01). However, the lengthening of action potential duration was significantly greater in the immature age group. d-Sotalol had no significant effect on maximum diastolic potential, action potential amplitude, or phase zero upstroke velocity in normally polarized fibers. In contrast, different electrophysiologic effects were observed in K(+)-depolarized Purkinje fibers. Superfusion of adult K(+)-depolarized fibers with d-sotalol suppressed excitability in five (38%) of 13 fibers and significantly decreased action potential amplitude (88 +/- 2 to 83 +/- 1 mV, p less than 0.05) and phase zero upstroke velocity (180 +/- 14 to 105 +/- 3 V/s, p less than 0.01) in the other eight fibers. The membrane depressant effects observed in the younger age group were significantly less [no suppression of excitability and a smaller decrease in phase zero upstroke velocity (121 +/- 22 to 101 +/- 23 V/s, p less than 0.05). The magnitude of action potential duration prolongation by d-sotalol in K(+)-depolarized fibers was less than in normally polarized fibers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The properties of Wilcoxon's rank sum test for fixed sample size and a Wilcoxon-type two-sample sequential test have been illustrated and compared by means of stochastic simulation. Data from a real fixed sample trial have been used, both for resampling from the original data, and for construction of an idealized theoretical distribution. The sequential and the fixed sample test obtain equal power, but the sequential test mostly includes considerably fewer patients to reach a conclusion, i.e. the mean and median number of patients included are both much lower than the fixed sample size. Under the hypotheses only a small fraction of the simulation runs exceed the fixed sample size. These findings exemplify results obtained in theoretical analyses and simulation studies covering a wide range of distributions. In our opinion sequential tests have obvious advantages and are in many cases better alternatives than fixed sample tests in clinical trials.", 
    "29": "Agitated and disruptive behavior is a common complication of senile dementia. Therapy with antipsychotic and anxiolytic agents is frequently unsuccessful and problematic. Though there are no controlled studies, Propranolol, the non-specific beta blocker, suppresses agitated behavior in patients with senile dementia.", 
    "30": "We have studied the effect of i.v. anaesthesia with propofol in the emulsion (Intralipid) formulation on drug distribution and metabolism in six dogs using dual-route administration of propranolol as a model compound. Each dog was studied on two consecutive days: day 1 awake and day 2 during propofol anaesthesia (6 mg kg-1 followed by an infusion of 0.8 mg kg-1 min-1). Propofol anaesthesia was associated with reduced intrinsic clearance by 40% (P less than 0.05) but no significant difference in systemic clearance or hepatic plasma flow. Propofol produced marked changes in drug distribution; volume of distribution (Vss) of propranolol increased 54% from 82.5 (SEM 7.3) litre awake to 127.3 (27) litre during propofol anaesthesia (P less than 0.05). This change was accompanied by an increase (P less than 0.05) in the free fraction of propranolol from 8.5 (0.7) % in awake to 14.0 (0.7) % in propofol-anaesthetized dogs. The combination of the effects of both drug clearance and protein binding resulted in a 65% decrease in the intrinsic clearance of unbound drug (P less than 0.05). In contrast with the effects of propofol on drug distribution, infusion of Intralipid alone in another group of six dogs had no significant effects on drug distribution, protein binding or drug metabolism. We conclude that propofol is a modest inhibitor of drug metabolism, but has major effects on propranolol distribution, possibly by changing plasma protein binding.", 
    "31": "The relative contribution of several effector systems to a prostaglandin E1-(PGE1) evoked hyperthermia was examined. Infusion of 150 ng of PGE1 into a lateral cerebral ventricle increased core temperature and whole body metabolic rate, brown adipose tissue temperature, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Pretreating the animals with a nonselective beta-antagonist propranolol (1 mg/kg iv in 0.3 ml followed by 3 mg.kg-1.h-1 in 0.3 ml/h) not only attenuated the rise in metabolism observed after the central administration of 150 ng PGE1 but also diminished the elevation in both core and brown fat tissue temperatures as well as the increase in heart rate. Pretreating the animals with the alpha-antagonist prazosin (2 mg/kg im followed by 50 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 iv in 0.3 ml/h) somewhat reduced the rise in whole body metabolism, suppressed the elevation in core temperature, but failed to alter the rise in brown adipose tissue temperature normally seen after the central administration of PGE1. Moreover, both the rise in systolic blood pressure and heart rate were attenuated when the PGE1 administration was preceded by prazosin. These results suggest that brown adipose tissue is an important effector organ responsible for mediating the hyperthermic response observed after the intracerebral injection of PGE1. In addition, the results indicate that alterations in vasomotor tone may also be important in producing or sustaining the elevated core temperature found after a pyrogen administration.", 
    "32": "Previous reports indicate that alpha-adrenergic agonists modulate vagal control of heart rate. In the rat, phenylephrine inhibition of vagal-stimulated bradycardia may be occurring at any of a number of sites along the cardiac parasympathetic pathway. The purpose of the present experiments was to localize the pre- or postganglionic sites of phenylephrine modulation of parasympathetic-mediated bradycardia in the rat. Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and instrumented with arterial and venous catheters and electrocardiographic leads. The cervical vagi were sectioned, and propranolol was administered. The right cervical vagus nerve was electrically stimulated to activate preganglionic parasympathetic nerves. Carbachol was injected to activate nicotinic receptors on postganglionic parasympathetic nerves (i.e., intracardiac ganglion cells). Methacholine was injected to activate muscarinic receptors at the sinoatrial node. The heart rate responses to these three interventions were recorded before, during, and after phenylephrine infusion. Phenylephrine significantly attenuated the bradycardia produced by vagal nerve stimulation. In contrast, phenylephrine facilitated the bradycardia elicited by carbachol injection. Since carbachol has both muscarinic and nicotinic effects, the results were compared with those obtained from methacholine, a pure muscarinic agonist. Phenylephrine had no effect on methacholine-induced bradycardia, suggesting that the modulation of the carbachol response was through carbachol's nicotinic effects. Yohimbine, the alpha 2-receptor antagonist, eliminated phenylephrine-mediated facilitation of the carbachol response. These data indicate that phenylephrine has contrasting effects on pre- and postganglionic cardiac parasympathetic nerves in rats: inhibition at preganglionic sites (vagal stimulation results) and facilitation at the level of the ganglion cells (carbachol experiments).", 
    "33": "The effects of various blockers of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-activated ionic channel on noncontractile slow Ca++ mobilization were investigated at the neuromuscular synapse of aequorin-injected diaphragm muscles of mice. Intracellular Ca++ mobilization (Ca++ transients) was evoked in the presence of neostigmine (0.3 microM) by nerve stimulation. Bupivacaine, an open channel blocker, decreased the peak amplitude, whereas chlorpromazine, a closed channel blocker, shortened the duration. Phencyclidine, an open and closed channel blocker, decreased both peak amplitude and duration. beta-Eudesmol, a compound of Atractylodes lancea, clearly and specifically shortened the duration but had little effect on peak amplitude. All the above channel blockers, when given in the same concentration ranges, also blocked the total amount of contractile Ca++ transients. The effects of bupivacaine, chlorpromazine and phencyclidine on noncontractile Ca++ transients were not affected by 5 mM [Ca++]o, whereas the effect of beta-eudesmol was enhanced. Geographutoxin II (0.3 microM), a skeletal muscle Na+ channel blocker, selectively and partly reversibly blocked contractile Ca++ transients without affecting noncontractile ones. These results suggest that: 1) the activation of noncontractile Ca++ mobilization is suppressed by open channel blockers, whereas its desensitization is accelerated by closed channel blockers and 2) activation of the muscle Na+ channel and subsequent release of Ca++ from sarcoplasmic reticulum is not involved in the mechanism of noncontractile Ca++ mobilization. It may reflect the steps of the desensitization process.", 
    "34": "The purpose of the present study was to characterize the receptor subtypes that mediate serotonin (5-HT)-induced contraction in isolated rat intramyocardial coronary artery. In coronary artery with and without endothelium, only 5-HT and alpha-methylserotonin maleate (5-HT2 agonist) elicited equipotent concentration-dependent contractions. The EC50 values for 5-HT and alpha-methylserotonin maleate in endothelium-intact arteries were 4.7 x 10(-7) and 4.5 x 10(-7) M, respectively, whereas in endothelium-denuded arteries they were 2.8 x 10(-7) and 1.9 x 10(-7) M, respectively. The other subtype agonists, such as (+/-)-8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin hydrobromide (5-HT1A agonist), 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine dihydrochloride and 7-trifluoromethyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-pyrrolo(1,2-a)quinoxaline (5-HT1B) and 2-methyl-serotonin maleate (5-HT3), only elicited a small percentage of the maximum contraction to 5-HT. In prostaglandin F2 alpha-precontracted coronary arteries with intact endothelium or denuded of endothelium, the addition of 5-HT resulted in a further increase in tension. No relaxation was observed with 5-HT up to 1 x 10(-5) M. The contraction induced by 5-HT in artery both with and without endothelium was inhibited by ketanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) but not by l-propranolol (5-HT1 antagonist) nor by 3-tropanyl-indole-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (5-HT3 antagonist). Ketanserin, the selective 5-HT2 antagonist, effectively antagonized 5-HT-induced contraction by shifting the 5-HT response curve to the right without inhibiting the maximal response in both endothelium-intact and -denuded arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "To investigate adherence to literature recommendations for administration of five cardiovascular drugs in relation to mealtimes, data from records of 183 adult patients in two short-term and two long-term care settings were tabulated. Ninety-three percent of patients taking quinidine sulfate and 85% of patients taking the other four study drugs received one or more doses incorrectly. Findings show that timing recommendations for dosing in relation to meals are not considered in these institutions when drug administration schedules are established. The practice of arbitrary schedule selection could have serious consequences, including adverse physiologic and financial impact on the patient from loss of therapeutic effectiveness or development of drug toxicosis. Medication schedules need to be designed to achieve the greatest drug bioavailability.", 
    "36": "The dose-response curves of betaxolol and atenolol were compared in 140 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Patients with a supine diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 115 mm Hg at the end of a 4-week single-blind placebo washout phase were randomized (double-blind) to receive either betaxolol or atenolol in a dose-escalation manner. The dose (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg betaxolol; 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg atenolol) was increased if the supine diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 90 mm Hg after 4 weeks at each level. The final dose in the escalation phase was continued for an additional 12 weeks and then followed by a 2-week placebo phase. The data were analyzed with a population model using the program NONMEM (nonlinear mixed effects model). Atenolol exhibited a graded dose-response curve, whereas the lowest dose of betaxolol produced maximum or near-maximum effect. The estimated maximum effect (drug plus possibly unmeasured placebo effect) was similar for both treatments, about 13 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 10 to 15 mm Hg). A trend toward less interindividual variability (coefficient of variation) was apparent for betaxolol compared to atenolol, 19% (95% confidence interval, 0% to 29%) versus 31% (95% confidence interval, 0% to 47%). The intraindividual variability (standard deviation) in supine diastolic blood pressure, 5.9 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 5.2 to 6.5 mm Hg), did not differ significantly between drugs despite significantly greater intraindividual variability (coefficient of variation) in atenolol concentrations, 62% (95% confidence interval, 48% to 73%) versus 26% (95% confidence interval, 22% to 29%) for betaxolol.", 
    "37": "The effect of 2 weeks of topical treatment with timolol maleate 0.5% ophthalmic solution on the retinal circulation was investigated using bidirectional laser Doppler velocimetry and monochromatic fundus photography. Fifteen normal healthy volunteers were included in this study. In a double-masked, randomized design one eye of each received one drop of timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily for 14 days, and the fellow eye received placebo. Vessel diameter (D), maximum erythrocyte velocity (Vmax), and volumetric blood flow rate (Q) were determined in one major retinal vein of each eye before treatment, and then, 2 hr after the instillation of drops on the morning of the 15th day of treatment. After treatment, the average change from baseline in D (+0.7%), Vmax (-8.2%) and Q (-7.7%) were not statistically significant in the placebo-treated eyes. In the timolol-treated eyes, the average increase from baseline in D (+0.1%) and Q (+10%) were not statistically significant. Average Vmax, on the other hand, increased significantly from baseline (P less than 0.05) by 9.6%. In comparison to the placebo-treated eyes, Vmax and Q were significantly increased in the timolol-treated eyes (P less than 0.0005 and P less than 0.01, respectively). These results are similar to those reported previously in a study of the effect of a one-time instillation of timolol and, therefore, suggest that the effect of timolol on the retinal circulation is maintained over a 2-week period.", 
    "38": "Fourteen infants aged less than 1 month presented to our institution during the last 22 years with ventricular tachycardia (VT) or accelerated ventricular rhythm and a structurally normal heart. In 2, VT was associated with long QT syndrome. Both are alive on beta-blocker therapy, 1 with an implanted pacemaker. Twelve infants had accelerated ventricular rhythm, and 2 of these died in the first 2 months of life of unrelated conditions. The other 10 are alive at a median age of 4 years (range 2 months to 11 years), and none were lost to follow-up. Hemodynamic compromise did not occur with accelerated ventricular rhythm. The ventricular rate was very close to the sinus rate in all 12, less than 12% above the sinus rate. The mean QRS duration during accelerated ventricular rhythm was 92.5 ms, and averaged twice the QRS duration during sinus rhythm. Fusion beats were seen in all 12, and there was atrioventricular dissociation with capture beats in 10. In 2, ventriculoatrial conduction was present. Treatment was attempted in 5 of the 10 survivors with accelerated ventricular rhythm, and was thought to be successful in 4. Treatment was later successfully withdrawn in all 5, so that all 10 survivors were free of accelerated ventricular rhythm and were not receiving antiarrhythmic medications at last follow-up. Because of the excellent long-term outcome and the lack of hemodynamic compromise during the rhythm, it seems reasonable to withhold antiarrhythmic therapy in infants with accelerated ventricular rhythm and await resolution of the rhythm.", 
    "39": "We tested the usefulness of a sustained intravenous infusion of nifedipine and a combination of nifedipine and metoprolol in the early management of 14 patients with unstable angina pectoris. After a 24-hour run-in period, nifedipine was titrated in a stepwise fashion (mean dose 27 +/- 7 micrograms/min). After nifedipine treatment coronary blood flow increased from 150 +/- 66 to 183 +/- 74 ml/min (p less than 0.05), whereas double product, myocardial oxygen consumption, and both arterial and coronary sinus (nor)epinephrine levels were unchanged. Myocardial lactate uptake increased from 3.4 +/- 26.1 to 31.3 +/- 26.6 mumol/min (p less than 0.005) and free fatty acid uptake from 7.2 +/- 22.1 to 34.5 +/- 33.7 mumol/min (p less than 0.05). A small nonsignificant improvement in amino acid metabolism was observed. Metoprolol was added in seven patients and led to a decrease in double product (-2.2 +/- 1.6 x 10(3); p less than 0.01) and myocardial oxygen consumption (-3.2 +/- 3.8 ml/min; p less than 0.05). The lactate uptake/oxygen uptake ratio increased by 18% after metoprolol (p = NS). The number of episodes of chest pain decreased from 2.4 +/- 1.1/24 hours to 0.1 +/- 0.2 in the nifedipine group and from 2.9 +/- 1.1/24 hours to 0.3 +/- 0.5 in the nifedipine plus metoprolol group (both p less than 0.01). We conclude that in the acute phase of unstable angina, intravenous nifedipine can be carefully titrated to improve coronary blood flow and oxidative metabolism. The addition of metoprolol is also associated with a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. This treatment results in significant hemodynamic stability.", 
    "40": "Emergency physicians may be called on to resuscitate acute complications in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease. Supraventricular tachycardia, with or without hemodynamic decompensation, is one of the most serious complications. We present the case of a 22-month-old boy with a history of single ventricle who presented to our institution with a history of syncope and hemodynamically stable supraventricular tachycardia. Initial attempts at pharmacologic conversion with propranolol and verapamil failed. The arrhythmia was terminated in response to an IV fluid bolus and dopamine infusion and probably resulted from a combination of anemia, hypovolemia, and impaired contractility. Appropriate evaluation and management relating to the cre of acute supraventricular tachycardia in children are discussed.", 
    "41": "Hemodynamic effects of m--nifedipine (m--Nif) combined with metoprolol (Met) were studied in conscious rabbits with impedance cardiography. Administration of m--Nif by intravenous injection (20 micrograms/kg) or by intraduodenal route (0.25 mg/kg) increased cardiac index (CI) and reduced total peripheral resistance (TPR) and arterial pressure. Intravenous injection of Met significantly slowed heart rate without great change in other hemodynamic parameters in conscious rabbits. Combination of m--Nif with Met gained the advantages of both m--Nif and Met. The negative effects of Met on CI and TPR were balanced by the vasodilatory effect of m--Nif. The difference between the results of m--Nif combined with equal dose of Met or with five times the dose of Met was just that further decrease of heart rate was observed. These results suggest that combined administration of m--Nif with Met may be more beneficial than giving each drug alone. It may be more suitable to use m--Nif combined with low doses of Met in order to avoid the danger of depressing myocardium.", 
    "42": "The effects of acute administration of two antihypertensive drugs, clonidine and propranolol, on plasma NPY and catecholamine levels were compared in sinoaortic denervated (a model associated with a marked increase in sympathetic tone and a rise in blood pressure) and normal conscious dogs. Clonidine decreased plasma noradrenaline and NPY concentrations in both groups of animals. Propranolol failed to change plasma noradrenaline and NPY levels in sinoaortic denervated dogs but elicited a decrease in plasma noradrenaline with no change in NPY levels in normotensive animals. The present experiments show that changes in plasma noradrenaline and NPY concentrations are not always simultaneous. The decrease in plasma NPY concentrations could contribute to the sympatholytic effect of clonidine.", 
    "43": "In 40 patients microcirculation of skin as well as viscoelasticity of blood and plasma were investigated. 20 of them suffered from essential hypertension (group A) and were treated with metoprolol with a dosage of 50 to 200 mg per day. The rest of 20 subjects were controls (group B). In the group treated with metoprolol the values for blood viscosity were decreased in a significant manner, while skin microcirculation, blood elasticity and plasma viscosity did not show a significant difference. The results demonstrate that metoprolol is not only possible as medication in ischemic disease, but this substance can have a benefit in this indication because of its hemorheological effect.",

Changes in the pulsatile component of choroidal blood flow (PCBF) were determined from measurements of the ocular pulse wave. Changes in the retinal arterial blood flow rate (RBF) and optic nerve head capillary blood speed (CBS) were determined by laser Doppler velocimetry and monochromatic photography. In timolol-treated eyes, PCBF decreased by 32 +/- 12% (p = 0.0007). Changes in RBF and CBS were not statistically significant. In the contralateral placebo-treated eyes, PCBF decreased by 15 +/- 8% (p = 0.006) and RBF increased by 18 +/- 10% (p = 0.002). The change in CBS was not statistically significant.", 
    "45": "Stress is known to influence the immune function via an effect on the central nervous system. We previously presented data showing that stress alters the population of T-cell subsets in mice. The variations of T-cell subsets in the thymus, peripheral blood, and spleen in mice similarly stressed by immobilization or by unavoidable and opioid-dependent stress were measured by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibodies anti-L3T4, anti-Lyt 1, anti-Lyt 2 and anti-Thy 1, 2. Immobilization stress was applied for three days and T-cell subsets were measured on the days 1, 2 and 3, as well as on day 7 after release from immobilization. Lyt 2-positive cells in the thymus were the most sensitive to stress, showing significant variations. The proportion of immature T-cells increased in the thymus, blood and spleen of the stressed mice. When diazepam or naloxone were administered 30 min before the initiation of stress, these variations tended to decrease. Thus, the ratio of T-cell subsets varied with the duration of immobilization stress. This appeared to be partly mediated by the opioid system and the central nervous system.", 
    "46": "Case-control studies of risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) have almost invariably employed hospital controls, with minimal or no coronary artery stenosis. Although there is an important advantage in knowing the CAD status of controls, such groups are subject to bias related to hospitalization. To evaluate the generalizability of results obtained from studies using hospital controls, we compared risk factors in 342 hospital controls free of angiographic evidence for CAD, 168 neighborhood controls without symptoms of CAD, and 450 CAD patients. Coronary artery disease in cases and hospital controls was established arteriographically. No significant differences were found between the male control groups for total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, LDL apo-B, pack-years of smoking, body mass index, proportion with hypertension, diabetes and family history of coronary heart disease. Compared with neighborhood controls, male hospital controls had significantly lower high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, higher triglycerides and uric acid and scored higher on the Framingham Type A behavior pattern scale. Among women, the hospital control group had significantly lower LDL cholesterol and fewer pack-years of smoking, and a greater prevalence of hypertension than the neighborhood group. A greater proportion of both male and female hospital controls had left ventricular hypertrophy, and there were more current smokers among the neighborhood controls in both sexes. Age adjustment did not change these comparisons. While very few neighborhood controls were treated with beta-blockers, 32.7% of male and 41.4% of female hospital controls were so medicated. Control for beta-blocker use eliminated the difference in HDL cholesterol and triglycerides between the two male control groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "Nifedipine (NF), a calcium channel blocker, is often prescribed in association with other drugs. Therefore, it was interesting to know whether or not, nifedipine, which is metabolized by the cytochrome P-450NF, was able to induce or to inhibit in vivo the activity of the hepatic mixed function oxidase system. The study was conducted in ten young healthy male volunteers receiving 20 mg NF slow release bid for 15 days. Due to the small number of subjects, comparison of the NF pharmacokinetics at dose 1 and 26 failed to show a bimodality in the frequency distribution of its area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 274.5 to 317.1 ng ml-1 h, NS). Hepatic microsomal autoinduction (t1/2 2.87 to 3.06 h, NS) was not found. No statistically significant effect was seen on the aminopyrine breath test and on the debrisoquine metabolic molar ratio performed before and at the end of the treatment. Unlike what has been suggested by in vitro studies, NF treatment did not modify significantly the urinary excretion of 6 beta-hydroxycortisol (318 to 265 micrograms/d, NS). After the last dose, the total oral clearance of NF was highly correlated with the metabolic clearance to 4-hydroxyantipyrine (r = 0.88; P = 0.005) but the other parameters of antipyrine biotransformation remained unchanged. We conclude that repeated nifedipine oral intake does not modify enzymatic activities of hepatic P-450 cytochromes involved in the biotransformation of antipyrine, aminopyrine, debrisoquine and cortisol.", 
    "48": "The protective effect of d,l-propranolol was studied using freshly isolated canine ventricular cardiocytes (1.5 x 10(6)/mL) exposed to 30 min anoxia (95% N2/5% CO2) and 0, 3, 20, and 45 min of reoxygenation (95% O2/5% CO2). In addition to preventing lipid peroxide formation, propranolol maintained cellular viability, and minimized ultrastructural alterations. In the absence of propranolol, the outer mitochondria become swollen and rounded up within the first few minutes of reoxygenation. The perinuclear mitochondrial area increased only slightly. We observed that the cellular injury process proceeded differentially from the exterior to the interior, with a mitochondrial area increase and outer membrane rupture. Sarcolemmal damage was also observed with prevalent blebbing and membrane loss. The Z-lines became wider and more diffuse with reoxygenation. Injury to the nuclear double membrane was observed. Incubation with propranolol showed significant protection during postanoxia reoxygenation. In contrast, the more water soluble beta-blocker atenolol only exhibited slight protection. In addition, d-propranolol (the non beta-blocking isomer) and the antioxidant enzymes, SOD and catalase, showed significant protection. These data support previous findings concerning the antioxidant properties of propranolol which appear to be independent of beta-receptor blockade.", 
    "49": "The influence of propranolol on the disposition of flutoprazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative extensively biotransformed by hepatic microsomal oxidation, was evaluated in the rat. Propranolol was infused subcutaneously with osmotic minipumps (5 mg/day) to obtain steady-state concentrations of about 200 ng/ml. Flutoprazepam (5 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally on the third day of propranolol infusion. There was some variability in flutoprazepam disposition, consistent with the concept of an extensive first-pass metabolism of high-extraction drugs. Propranolol had no significant effects on the kinetics of flutoprazepam or norflutoprazepam, an active metabolite possibly accounting for a substantial part of the parent compound's pharmacological and clinical effects. It was concluded that there is no evidence of any pharmacokinetic interaction between this beta-adrenoceptor blocker and flutoprazepam in the rat.", 
    "50": "A significant decrease in myocardial creatine kinase (CK) activity is apparent 2 hr after an acute ethanol load (2.3 g/kg, i.p.) in the rat. A lower dose (1.15 g/kg, i.p.), as well as ethanol addition in vitro up to 50 mM, do not affect this activity. Pretreatment with allopurinol (146 mumols/kg, i.p.) given at 16 hr and at 30 min before ethanol (2.3 g/kg) or with desferrioxamine (152 mumols/kg, i.p.) 30 min before ethanol failed to prevent the ethanol-induced decrease in CK activity. By contrast, propranolol (17 mumols/kg, i.p.), administered 30 min before ethanol elicited an enhanced CK activity in both control and ethanol-treated rats. This finding is likely related to the beta-blocking action and/or antioxidant properties of propranolol. Chronic ethanol intake (18% in calories) for 4 weeks also induced a decrease in myocardial CK activity, which could play a role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "51": "In 12 dogs anesthetised with alpha-chloralose and urethane, and beta-adrenergic blocked with propranolol, the cervical vagi were stimulated for 60 seconds with supramaximal constant current pulses at frequencies between 2.0 and 10 Hz. The time course of the recovery of the cardiac period response, after cessation of vagal stimulation, was analyzed using nonlinear curve fitting techniques. It was found that the recovery phase could be reliably fitted with a function consisting of the sum of up to three exponential terms. The first term has a moderate rate constant of 0.2260 +/- 0.0112 S-1 (SE) and is independent of vagal stimulus frequency and the preceding bradycardia. We propose that this term is associated with a recovery from the bradycardia with a rate constant indicative of the reduction of acetylcholine at the pacemaker caused by hydrolysis and washout. The second term has a small rate constant of 0.0499 +/- 0.0014 s-1 (SE) and a negative gain. This term describes the time course of the post vagal tachycardia observed at cessation of stimulation. It is also independent of stimulus frequency and the preceding bradycardia. The third term has a large and variable rate constant (range: 0.247-8.01 s-1) and becomes increasingly dominant when the preceding bradycardia is large. We propose that this third component arises from a rapid return of the pacemaker focus to the dominant location prior to vagal stimulation. The mathematical characterisation of this component is important to permit the accurate derivation of the time courses of the remaining two components. Curvilinear relationships exist between the gain parameters for each of the exponential terms and the preceding bradycardia.", 
    "52": "Strenuous physical exercise causes transient proteinuria and renal hemodynamic changes: decrease of renal blood flow and to a lesser extent of the glomerular filtration rate, and an increase of the filtration fraction. However, the mechanisms of these modifications are still poorly understood. In order to elucidate them we performed maximal exercise tests on 8 untrained healthy volunteers after inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by captopril, the sympathetic nervous system by a beta-blocking drug (acebutolol) or an alpha-blocking drug (prazosin) and the prostaglandin system by indomethacin. Urinary albumin excretion was measured in every subject first at rest (AB) and then after exercise (AA) performed successively without and with blockade by each of theses drugs. AA-AB difference in the captopril test (12.04 +/- 6.11 micrograms/min) compared to that in the control test (68.91 +/- 25.18 micrograms/min) was significantly reduced (p less than 0.02). This difference remained unchanged after acebutolol (59.87 +/- 21.91 micrograms/min, p = 0.62), prazosin (35.23 +/- 27.80 micrograms/min, p = 0.21) and indomethacin (55.21 +/- 28.43 micrograms/min, p = 0.35). There was a negative correlation between the lowering of AA elevation and the rise in plasma renin activity in the captopril test (r = 0.64; p less than 0.03). Only acebutolol decreased systolic blood pressure significantly. These results suggest that the RAS plays a major role in postexercise proteinuria. We hypothesize that stimulation of this system induces an increase of efferent glomerular artery constriction and consequently of glomerular transcapillary pressure and the filtration fraction. Captopril seems able to prevent these hemodynamic changes.", 
    "53": "Propranolol (P) administration is known to cause hypoglycemia in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. The mechanisms whereby this response is produced remain controversial. Some authors postulate an inhibition in the beta-adrenergic action of catecholamines, responsible for hepatic glycogenolysis, while others indicate that these hormones are not so important in the regulation of blood sugar (BS) level. The present studies were undertaken to assess the mechanism whereby hypoglycemia is developed in the dog, with or without beta-adrenergic blockade. Unanesthetized male mongrel dogs were used, weighing 10-20 kg body wt., fed on dog chow pellets and water ad libitum up to 18-22 hours before the test performances. The dogs were randomly grouped into two groups, A and B in which the effect of P on several hormonal and metabolic responses basally and during insulin (I) test, were respectively studied. Group A was constituted by two subgroups of 6 animals each; the animals of one subgroup were beta-blocked, receiving P p.o. for 10 days (80 mg every 8 hours); the dogs of the remaining subgroup received only P excipient in the same way as the treated ones, for the same period. As P treatment was completed, blood samples were taken by venipuncture, in a peripheral vein, at 0 and 60 min. Some biological controls of beta-blockade, assessed at 0, 30 and 60 min, indicated that mean pulse rate (+/- SE) in the control dogs was 123 +/- 2, 128 +/- 2 and 128 +/- 3 beats/min while in the P treated ones was 106 +/- 2, 103 +/- 1 and 103 +/- 3 respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Chronic antiarrhythmic therapy for the prevention of episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia is limited by its elevated cost, the development of side effects and lack of patients' collaboration. In this study the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of diltiazem (180 mg) and propranolol (80 mg) were assessed. Eighteen episodes of supraventricular tachycardia were treated in 17 patients, 9 female and 8 male, aged between 19 and 60 years old (mean 45.3 +/- 11.4). The episodes had begun 3 months to 40 years before. They were divided in 3 groups: group I (placebo), 6 episodes; group II (diltiazem-propranolol), 12 episodes; and group III (patients from the placebo group without spontaneous recovery of sinus rhythm who were given active drug), 6 episodes. There were no spontaneous conversions in group I (placebo) within 80 minutes. In group II, ten out of 12 episodes responded to the combination after 38.8 +/- 20.8 minutes (seven episodes were converted to sinus rhythm within the first 45 minutes). In group III (non-responders to placebo who were subsequently given active drugs), four out of 6 episodes were suppressed after 50.7 +/- 16.7 minutes. The cycle of the tachycardia lengthened before conversion to sinus rhythm both in groups II and III. Neither systolic nor diastolic blood pressure changed significantly in any group. Seven out of 14 patients who successfully converted to sinus rhythm in groups II and III, suffered mild to moderate sweat between 3 and 5 minutes before the end of the episodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Viskaldix therapy lowered total peripheral resistance --TPR and there was no significant influence on the heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. It was demonstrated that decrease of total peripheral resistance after treatment with Viskaldix was directly proportional to the initial values of TPR.", 
    "56": "The oxidation of timolol exhibits genetic polymorphism of debrisoquine type. After oral administration, poor metabolizers have high timolol concentrations in plasma and show an intensified systemic beta-blockade. Since the contribution of debrisoquine metabolizer status on timolol eyedrop therapy is not known we determined the systemic absorption of ocularly applied timolol in healthy subjects classified either extensive or poor metabolizers. Unlike after oral timolol ocular drug administration caused higher peak drug concentrations in plasma in extensive metabolizers. The variation in the systemic absorption of ocular timolol contributed more than the debrisoquine oxidation phenotype to timolol plasma levels after a single ocular timolol application.", 
    "57": "Growth hormone (GH) secretion can presently be investigated by several methods: pharmacological provocative tests, study of 24-h GH secretion, measurement of somatomedin-C (Sm-C)/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I, and the growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) test. In order to compare the results obtained, these methods were used in 257 children with growth retardation (169 boys, 88 girls). Their height SD was -2.7 +/- 0.2, chronological age 11 3/12 +/- 1 6/12 years, and bone age 8 4/12 +/- 1 4/12 years. Mean growth velocity was 4.5 +/- 1.5 cm/year. One hundred and thirty-eight boys and 80 girls were prepubertal, and 31 boys and 8 girls were pubertal (B2 G2). All children underwent the study of 24-h GH secretion (n = 257) and pharmacological provocative tests (two tests, n = 213; one test n = 44). Sm-C/IGF I was measured in prepubertal children (n = 131), and a GHRH test was carried out (n = 153). In addition, the mean integrated concentration of growth hormone secretion (IC-GH) was assessed in a control group of 23 children and was found to be 5.4 +/- 1.2 ng/ml/min. The IC-GH in the group as a whole was 2.6 ng/ml/min. The mean maximum peak during pharmacological tests varied considerably according to the test used, ranging from 7.8 ng/ml for the arginine test to 17.1 ng/ml for the glucagon and betaxolol test. The maximum peak and the 24-h IC-GH were not significantly correlated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "Selectivity was optimized for the determination of drugs in urine by direct injection micellar chromatography through changes in specific mobile phase parameters. The r\u00f4le of mobile phase pH and the type of surfactant used for mobile phase preparation was investigated. The retention of the urine matrix was found to be minimal between pH 5.5 and 7.5. The non-ionic surfactant, polyoxyethylene 23 lauryl ether (Brij 35), was found to be the surfactant of choice for the separation of drugs from urine. Favourable retention of both the urine background and the analyte was achieved with this surfactant. Micellar mobile phases of optimal composition were used to develop chromatographic procedures for the determination of furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol in urine. Good accuracy (98-102% of drug recovered), precision (1-4% RSD) and linearity were obtained for all methods. Limits of detection for all drugs were adequate.", 
    "59": "1. The effects of the oxyaporphine alkaloid thalicminine on guinea-pig isolated ileum, trachea, aorta and pulmonary artery and on blood pressure and heart rate of anesthetized guinea-pigs were studied. 2. Thalicminine (1-300 microM) caused the relaxation of the longitudinal ileal segments. The relaxation induced by 300 microM was followed by vigorous contractions. 3. Thalicminine caused only mild relaxation of the trachea. 4. Thalicminine (0.3-300 microM) caused concentration-dependent relaxation of epinephrine-precontracted aorta and main pulmonary artery. 5. Propranolol (1 microM) failed to reduce the relaxation or to affect the EC50 value of thalicminine on the ileum or the pulmonary artery. 6. Quinacrine (10 microM), on the other hand, potentiated thalicminine-induced relaxation and reduced the EC50 on the aorta and the pulmonary artery suggesting the interference of thalicminine with arachidonic acid metabolism. 7. In anesthetized animals, intravenous injections of 0.37-1.1 mg kg of thalicminine caused transient reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. Both parameters returned to their normal values in about 10 min.", 
    "60": "1. Nitroglycerin caused dose-dependent increases in regional myocardial contractile force (MCF) in open-chest dogs, along with dose-dependent decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDP) and arterial pressures and an increase in plasma catecholamines level. 2. The increase in MCF could not be completely prevented by propranolol along with a slight decrease in LVEDP and no increase in heart rate, although a nifedipine-produced increase in MCF without a significant decrease in LVEDP disappeared with propranolol despite the same decrease in arterial pressure.", 
    "61": "1. The effects of ion channel blockers and ion substitutions on the prolonged depolarization of cones in the retina of the turtle (Pseudemys scripta elegans) were studied by intracellular recording. 2. The results of current injection experiments indicate that the prolonged depolarization is regenerative and accompanied by a reduction in the cone's input resistance. 3. The addition of cobalt (5-10 mM) or the removal of extracellular calcium suppressed the prolonged depolarization. Raising extracellular calcium or adding strontium (10 mM) lowered the threshold and increased the duration of the response. 4. Unlike the feedback spikes of turtle cones studied by Piccolino and Gerschenfeld, the prolonged depolarization was not blocked by the organic calcium channel blocker, D600. 5. Adding a calcium chelator, ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), to the electrolyte caused a progressive shortening of the prolonged depolarization until it was ultimately abolished. 6. Lowering extracellular sodium or use of the potassium channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) had little effect on the prolonged depolarization. 7. Removing chloride from the superfusate induced a significant enhancement of the prolonged depolarization. In normal superfusate, the response tended to be of larger amplitude when recorded with electrodes containing chloride [1.5 M KCl + 1.5 M potassium acetate (KA)] rather than KA or potassium methylsulfate (KM) alone. 8. The results suggest that the prolonged depolarization is initiated by the regenerative activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels and sustained by a calcium-dependent chloride efflux. The present findings are also discussed in relation to the functional significance of the prolonged depolarization and mechanisms for the surround antagonism of cones in situ.", 
    "62": "Independent trials of early administration of beta-blockers and thrombolytic agents have shown beneficial effects on both short- and long-term prognoses in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The effects of a combination of the two strategies have not been thoroughly documented. Three hundred and fifty-two patients, of less than 75 years of age, with chest pain indicative of AMI, and onset less than 2 h and 45 min before first examination, were randomized to treatment with rt-PA or placebo. All patients without contraindication were given intravenous metoprolol 15 mg acutely and then 200 mg orally daily. Treatment was started either at the prehospital stage or in hospital. Thirty-seven per cent of patients had contraindications to beta-blockade, the most frequent of which were heart rate less than 60 beats min-1 and hypotension. The remaining 63% were given intravenous beta-blockade. No side-effects of metoprolol, alone or in combination with rt-PA, were observed during the prehospital phase. Overall, toleration of the treatment was good. Reduction in enzymatically estimated infarct size by rt-PA was more pronounced in patients who were also treated with metoprolol (41%, P less than 0.001) than in those with contraindications to beta-blockade (15%, NS). Patients who were also treated with metoprolol also had a lower incidence of Q-wave infarctions, congestive heart failure and ventricular fibrillation than those who were not given intravenous beta-blockade. In conclusion, toleration of intravenous administration of rt-PA and metoprolol was good, and this was also the case in the prehospital phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "To assess the effect of bypass surgery on outcome from unstable angina, 468 patients were randomized to medical treatment (237 patients) or surgery plus medical treatment (231 patients) and have been followed for comparison of survival, cardiac end points, and quality of life; the latter end point is discussed in the present report. Data were available at 3 and 5 years for 80% and 82% of patients in the medical group, respectively, and 77% and 80% of patients in the surgery group, respectively. At 3 months after randomization to therapy, 79.8% of patients in the surgery group reported subjective improvement, compared with 58% of the medical group, 12.6% of the surgery group reported no change compared with 24.5% of the medical group, and 5.5% of the surgery group reported worsening compared with 24.5% of the medical group (p less than 0.01 by chi 2). Similar data were found for chest pain status, and the benefit to the surgery group remained statistically significant through 5 years of follow-up. Crossover rate to surgery was 43% by 5 years. Treadmill duration was increased in the surgery group compared with the medical group (6.5 +/- 0.25 versus 5.3 +/- 0.25 minutes at 6 months, p less than 0.01), and a significant difference was again demonstrated at 3 and 5 years. A trend toward decreased recurrence of unstable angina was present in the surgery group at 1 year (six of 168 [3.6%] versus 13 of 187 [6.9%] in the medical group, p = 0.158), but the two groups were similar at 3 and 5 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "Effects of a Senso (toad venom)-containing drug, KY, on cardiovascular system were examined in anesthetized open-chest dogs. KY increased aortic pressure, peak positive first derivative of left ventricular pressure, stroke work index, percent segment shortening in left ventricular myocardium and myocardial oxygen consumption, and decreased heart rate and total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR). Propranolol augmented the increase in aortic pressure with KY, inhibited the increase in aortic flow with KY and reversed KY-induced decrease in TPR to an increase. These results indicate that KY has positive inotropic and vasodilating actions possibly originating from both digitalis- and adrenaline-like action of a Senso.", 
    "65": "We compared the efficacy of Chinese traditional treatment for mild hypertension with that of a standard Western medical regimen in a group of 50 well-matched patients (24 allocated to Western medicine and 26 to Chinese traditional medicine) with mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90-104 mmHg). Those receiving Western therapy were treated in a stepped-care fashion with dihydrochlorothiazide and atenolol. Those in the Chinese traditional therapy group received one of two mixtures of nine herbs and other ingredients, depending on symptoms at initial evaluation. Blood pressure dropped significantly in both groups after only a few days on therapy. After 19 days on treatment, the group receiving Western therapy had a fall in blood pressure from 168.2/96.3 mmHg to 137.3/76.7 mmHg (p less than 0.01), while those on Chinese traditional therapy fell from 168.2/95.9 mmHg to 146.4/80.5 mmHg (p less than 0.01). The fall in blood pressure was significantly greater, however, in those given Western therapy. The relief of existing symptoms or development of possible drug side effects was similar in both groups, except for nocturia, occurring more often in the group treated with Western therapy. We conclude that Western therapy is more effective in reducing blood pressure as compared with Chinese traditional therapy, but effective control of blood pressure in mild hypertensives is possible with either form of treatment.", 
    "66": "A randomized collective comparative study between nicardipine (N) and propranolol (P) was conducted over a period of 7 weeks in thirty hypertensive patients of both sexes, aged from 20 to 65 years, with the diastolic pressure over 100, but below 120 mmHg. Thirteen examinees were given N (60-120 mg daily) and seventeen P (120-240 mg daily); the groups were comparable according to a series of relevant parameters. In the placebo-period the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was slightly lowered, by 4.4% (p greater than 0.20). MAP was, however, considerably lowered already at the end of the second week of active treatment both in the N group (from 135.1 +/- 7.4 to 116 +/- 10.8 mmHg, or by 19.1%; P less than 0.01), as well as in the P group (from 131.6 +/- 8.1 to 117 +/- 9.1 mmHg, by an average of 11.1%; P less than 0.05). The values continued to decrease, and at the end of the seventh week of the study MAP averaged 108.5 +/- 6.5 mmHg (-19.7%; P less than 0.01) in the N group, while it was 109.7 +/- 9.1 mmHg (-16.6%; P less than 0.01) in the P group. The heart rate became considerably slower in the P group only, from the initial 84.5 +/- 9.2 to 66.9 +/- 2.7 beats per minute at the end of the seventh week (-20.8%; P less than 0.01), but it was unexpectedly, although not significantly lowered also in the N group, from the initial 78.3 +/- 6.5 to 74.2 +/- 4.0 beats (-5.2%; P greater than 0.20).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "A 42-year-old woman with pheochromocytoma received preoperatively a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, amosulalol, exerting some inhibitory action on both receptors. Severe hypertension and remarkable fluctuation of heart rate occurred following this medication. Although it is claimed currently that a combined blocking agent is useful for the management of this disease, it should be administered with caution.", 
    "68": "The cardiovascular responses of 24 healthy young adult males with a parental history of hypertension and 24 males without a parental history of hypertension to an extended active-coping psychological stressor were compared under three drug conditions: placebo, the beta 1-blocking agent metoprolol, and the alpha 1-blocking agent prazosin. In the placebo condition, offspring of hypertensives exhibited significantly greater heart rate, blood volume pulse, and forearm blood flow responses to the task. They also exhibited a significantly greater initial decrease in forearm vascular resistance, which, in contrast to the offspring of normotensives, was no longer significantly different from baseline levels by the end of the session. No group differences in blood pressure response were observed. Metoprolol eliminated the differences in heart rate and forearm vascular resistance responses. Prazosin eliminated the difference in blood volume pulse response and elicited a sustained group difference in forearm vascular resistance. These results implicate the sympathetic nervous system in the exaggerated cardiovascular responsivity to psychological stress in individuals with a family history of essential hypertension. They also suggest that the pattern of increasing vascular resistance in response to this stressor observed in this and other studies in this laboratory reflects alpha-adrenergic activity and not neurohumorally independent autoregulation.", 
    "69": "General well-being, adverse effects and anti-hypertensive efficacy have been investigated in a double blind, parallel-group, dose-response multicentre study of diltiazem and metoprolol monotherapy for hypertension. 128 patients with primary hypertension were included from 10 participating centres. The patients were randomized to receive oral diltiazem 120-240-360 mg/day or metoprolol 50-100-200 mg/day. Each dose was given for a 4-week period as a forced titration regime. In all 119 patients, 59 and 60, respectively, on diltiazem and metoprolol completed the study protocol. There were dose-dependent reductions in supine and standing blood pressures (BP) after both diltiazem and metoprolol therapy. In the diltiazem group, supine BP was reduced by 10 (11)/10 (6) mmHg (SBP/DBP) at the highest dose level, and the corresponding values for the metoprolol group were 7 (16)/8 (9) mmHg (SBP/DBP). Target pressures (DBP less than or equal to 90 mmHg and/or a reduction in DBP of greater than or equal to 10%) were reached in 63% and 48% of the patients, respectively. The incidence and severity of dose-dependent adverse effects, as evaluated by spontaneous reports or open and direct questioning, did not differ between treatments. Subjective well-being, evaluated by a self-administered questionnaire, the MSE-profile, did not differ significantly between diltiazem and metoprolol therapy. However, after an initial slight deterioration, contentment and vitality tended to improve with increasing doses of diltiazem, while a dose-related deterioration in these variables was observed on metoprolol therapy. At the highest dose levels, contentment and vitality tended to be better in the diltiazem than the metoprolol group. Thus, diltiazem and metoprolol in daily doses of 120-360 mg and 50-200 mg, respectively, produce comparable and parallel reductions in supine and standing BP. However, while subjective well-being tended to improve with increasing doses of diltiazem, there was a negative trend for metoprolol. It is concluded that diltiazem, given as monotherapy to hypertensive patients, does not impair subjective well-being.", 
    "70": "The presence or absence of an interaction between topical diclofenac (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent) and topical timolol (beta-blocker) was studied in 37 eyes. We instilled one drop of diclofenac several times into the patient's right eye and one drop of timolol into the same eye. We measured intraocular pressure in both eyes twice and compared the results in both eyes with the baseline intraocular pressure and with the pressure after administration of diclofenac alone and timolol alone. The joint use of both drugs did not modify the decrease in the ocular pressure induced by timolol. We can therefore use timolol and diclofenac together when a combination of antiinflammatory and beta-blocker agents is required.", 
    "71": "Peptide histidine methionine (PHM) is a neuropeptide with structural homology to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), itself a putative vasodilatory neurotransmitter. Intra-arterial administration of PHM caused a transient, dose-dependent increase in canine vertebral artery blood flow in vivo. PHM was less potent in this effect than VIP. The interaction of PHM with the vasoconstrictor amines, norepinephrine, histamine, and serotonin, was examined using isolated strips of the bovine middle cerebral artery. PHM shifted the concentration-response curves for vasocontraction by norepinephrine and histamine to the right but did not affect the vasocontraction induced by serotonin. These results suggest that PHM may have a role in the regulation of the cerebral circulation.", 
    "72": "The effect of deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol on renal function, was studied in 25 patients undergoing middle-ear surgery. The patients were randomized into three groups, one enflurane (E) group and two isoflurane (I and F) groups. Group F received frusemide 0.5 mg kg-1 at the onset of hypotension. The mean arterial pressure was 50 mmHg (6.7 kPa) in Groups E and I, and 49 mmHg (6.5 kPa) in Group F during hypotension. During hypotension, urine flow rate, effective renal blood flow, endogenous creatinine clearance, and osmolar clearance decreased. Free-water clearance and fractional electrolyte excretions also indicated deterioration of renal function during hypotension, but it returned to normal after anaesthesia. The effects of frusemide appeared mainly after anaesthesia. Frusemide reduced the amount of labetalol and isoflurane needed to maintain hypotension. Serum fluoride concentration did not increase to a potentially nephrotoxic level.", 
    "73": "The effectiveness of dynamic cardiomyoplasty as a means of haemodynamic support in heart failure remains controversial. We have undertaken a study of right ventricular dynamic cardiomyoplasty in sheep using intravenous propranolol to provoke heart failure. Muscle conditioning was performed with cardiomyostimulators following a previously established protocol. We performed multiple invasive measurements of haemodynamic parameters including arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure, right ventricular dp/dt and end diastolic pressures. These were performed before induction of heart failure, after induction of heart failure, and with pacing of the cardiomyoplasty flap in established heart failure. Our results confirm that we were able to establish significant heart failure and that subsequent pacing of the conditioned muscle flap was able to return cardiac output and right ventricular function to their pre-failure control levels.", 
    "74": "The effects of electrical stimulation of hypogastric nerve and sympathetic chain on 'electroerection' (penile erection induced by electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve) were studied in dogs to clarify the physiological roles that these neural inputs may play in producing and/or maintaining penile erection. As an objective parameter of hemodynamics of the penile circulation, the pressure in the corpus cavernosum of the penis was measured. Hypogastric nerve electrostimulation was performed in 24 dogs who had received pelvic nerve stimulation and, therefore, had 'electroerection'. Ten dogs responded to this procedure with an augmentation of 'electroerection', 10 with an attenuation of 'electroerection', and 4 with no appreciable changes. 4 out of the 10 animals who exhibited an attenuation response were then given an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker (prazosin hydrochloride) prior to the electrical stimulation to evaluate the specificity of the effects of the hypogastric nerve stimulation. In 3 of the 4 dogs the attenuation effect was abolished by this treatment and instead an augmentation effect became evident. Sympathetic chain electrostimulation was performed in 6 dogs with 'electroerection'. When applied to the L4-5 interganglionic segment, it produced a biphasic response which consisted of an initial increase followed by a decrease of the intracorporeal pressure. In contrast, stimulation of the L2-3 interganglionic segment produced a monophasic response consisting of only augmentation of the intracorporeal pressure. These data suggested that there might be two groups of fibers in the hypogastric nerve and sympathetic chain which are functioning antagonistically, and that the anti-erectile neural inputs are mediated primarily by the alpha 1-adrenergic system. To examine the sites of penile vasculature where the innervating hypogastric nerve exerts its effects, electrical pelvic/hypogastric nerve stimulations were performed in dogs in whom the inflow blood circulation to the corpora cavernosa was disrupted by arterial ligation and replaced by a constant saline infusion. It appears that the stimulatory input via the hypogastric nerve caused an increased blood flow into the cavernous space due to vasodilation of the inflow blood vessels, and the inhibitory effect occurred mainly due to relaxation of the draining blood vessels with a resultant increase of the blood outflow from the cavernous space.", 
    "75": "Carteolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was compared in 1% and 2% topical solutions with 0.5% timolol in 105 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. In this double-masked, randomized 3-month trial, all three preparations significantly lowered intraocular pressure throughout the study, with no significant differences being observed. There were also no significant differences among the three preparations with regard to ocular or systemic adverse reactions, including heart rate and blood pressure.", 
    "76": "The main hypothesis of this study was that sympathetic neurons located at the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) control luteinizing hormone (LH) releasing mechanisms by acting at a hypothalamic site. To test this, medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) content and serum LH levels were measured in male rats subjected to superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx) or sham-operation 14 or 38 h earlier, at the time of degeneration of nerve endings post-SCGx. Significantly augmented MBH LHRH levels and decreased circulating LH were found in SCGx rats. In animals subjected to SCGx 14 h earlier and receiving a single injection of the alpha 1-adrenergic blocker prazosin, the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol or a mixture of both drugs 45 min before sacrifice, only the injection of prazosin prevented the decrease of plasma LH levels. Neither treatment prevented the increase in MBH LHRH content. When prazosin was given every hour starting from the 10th to the 13th h after surgery, it was effective to prevent both the increase of MBH LHRH content and the decrease of serum LH found during sympathetic nerve degeneration. Similar repetitive injections of propranolol resulted in the greatest depression of serum LH, and in the greatest increase of MBH LHRH observed. Serum LH response to LHRH injection was similar in SCGx and sham-operated rats. The data indicate that SCG neurons exert, through inhibitory alpha 1-, and weaker, stimulatory beta-adrenoceptors, a significant influence on LHRH release at a supra-hypophysial site.", 
    "77": "The effects of acute coronary artery occlusion in anaesthetized cats has been studied with regard to changes in cardiac function and regional myocardial blood flow. Occlusion of the left anterior decending coronary artery (LAD) is followed by a rapid reduction of peak systolic blood pressure (LVSP) and contractility (dP/dt) and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Five minutes after coronary occlusion heart rate, LVSP, and (dP/dt) was reduced and LVEDP increased. Global cardiac function measured by these variables was gradually restored to preocclusion values; LVSP after 10 min., heart rate and dP/dt after 20 min. After 40 and 60 min these variables were stable at preocclusion levels. LVEDP remained permanently elevated. In hearts with regional ischaemia and paced heart rate global cardiac function was mainly restored 20 min after coronary occlusion except for increased LVEDP, both in cats pretreated with non-selective beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol) and in unblocked cats. In general, blood flow in non-ischaemic myocardium adjacent to the ischaemic region increased following coronary occlusion, although not significantly in the endocardium. The endocardial/epicardial blood flow ratio was stable in unblocked hearts and was reduced in beta-blocked hearts. In normally perfused myocardium remote from the ischaemic region, blood flow increased following occlusion both in beta-blocked and unblocked cats, most pronounced in the epicardium; the endo/epicardial blood flow ratio decreased.", 
    "78": "Mild and brief electrical stimulation of sites in the pretectal nucleus of rat produced analgesia (SPA) of long duration without significant aversion. Intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of 5-HT receptor antagonists methysergide (50 micrograms) and ketanserin (50 micrograms) and the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol (50 micrograms) had no significant effect on pretectal SPA, but alpha and beta adrenoceptor antagonists phenoxybenzamine (50 micrograms) and sotalol (50 micrograms) on icv injection significantly antagonised the pretectal SPA. The results suggest that pretectal SPA involves activation of central adrenoceptors."
