    "0": "The course of desmin-related restrictive cardiomyopathy (DRCM) during pregnancy has not been described previously because of the rarity of the condition. Following an episode of heart failure antecedent to conception, a 28-year-old primigravida with DRCM presented to establish prenatal care during the first trimester. Prenatal management consisted of \u03b2-blocker and diuretic therapy, with serial echocardiography to monitor cardiac function. Spontaneous labor ensued at 39 weeks' gestation, and vacuum-assisted delivery was performed for fetal indication. Postpartum blood transfusion was required for symptomatic anemia because of uterine atony, and subsequent maternal and neonatal courses were uncomplicated. Cardiac evaluation postpartum demonstrated stable maternal status. Pregnancy in women with controlled DRCM is not contraindicated, however, it requires careful planning and monitoring during the antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum periods. On the basis of this report, pregnancy does not appear to exert a permanent deleterious effect on cardiac function in women with DRCM.", 
    "1": "The article presents the evaluation of the influence of complex application of monopril, propranolol and heparin and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); monopril, propranolol with methylase in combination with PCI and PCI only on hemddynamics, cardiohemodynamics and clinical course in acute myocardial infarction (MI), as well as the monitoring of these patients. A comparison of the results of the complex medical and mechanical revascularization. The study involved 63 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS): anterior MI with Q wave and ST-segment with the rise in age from 30 to 70 years, the average age (56.7 +/- 1.2) years old, who were randomly divided into three groups with 21 in each. Patients in group I received heparin, propranolol with monopril and PCI; II--methylase (tenakteplaza) and propranolol, monopril and after 1 day they performed PCI; group III patients performed only PCI. With the help of echocardiography and Doppler echocardiometry values studied endsystolic (ESV) and end-diastolic (EDV) volume, ejection fraction (EF), stroke (SI) and heart (HI) index, index of local contractility disturbance of the left ventricle (LV ILCD) as well as the dynamics of systolic, (SBP) and diastolic (PBP) blood pressure, clinical features of myocardial infarction during follow-up. Injection of methylase, infusion of propranolol, receiving per os of monopril and conduct after 1 day of PCI accelerate the stabilization of central hemodynamics. ESV, EDV and ILCD reduce, systolic function of LV improves, ejection fraction increases. When there was no restenosis, myocardial infarction relapse and mortality 1 patient on 5th day was recorded acute heart failure (AHF). When treating by monopril, propranolol and heparin and conduct of PCI also stabilize central hemodynamics. ESV, EDV and ILCD reduce, EF increases and systolic function of LV improves (I group). However, in one patient on the 3rd day were recorded acute heart failure (AHF). Restenosis, recurrent myocardial infarction, and mortality were not observed. During the PCI only treatment 4 patients relapsed MI, 4 patients had restenosis, 2 patients had AHF and 2 patients died. Observations have shown that the combined application of drug therapy with PCI provides a positive predictive as opposed to using only PCI.", 
    "2": "Carvedilol (CAR) is a potent antihypertensive drug but has poor oral bioavailability (24%). A nanosuspension suitable for pulmonary delivery to enhance bioavailability and bypass first-pass metabolism of CAR could be advantageous. Accordingly, the aim of this work was to prepare CAR nanosuspensions and to use artificial neural networks associated with genetic algorithm to model and optimize the formulations. The optimized nanosuspension was lyophilized to obtain dry powder suitable for inhalation. However, respirable particles must have a diameter of 1-5 \u00b5m in order to deposit in the lungs. Hence, mannitol was used during lyophilization for cryoprotection and to act as a coarse carrier for nanoparticles in order to deliver them into their desired destination. The bottom-up technique was adopted for nanosuspension formulation using Pluronic stabilizers (F127, F68, and P123) combined with sodium deoxycholate at 1:1 weight ratio, at three levels with two drug loads and two aqueous to organic phase volume ratios. The drug crystallinity was studied using differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffractometry. The in vitro emitted doses of CAR were evaluated using a dry powder inhaler sampling apparatus and the aerodynamic characteristics were evaluated using an Andersen MKII cascade impactor. The artificial neural networks results showed that Pluronic F127 was the optimum stabilizer based on the desired particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. Results of differential scanning calorimetry combined with powder X-ray diffractometry showed that CAR crystallinity was observed in the lyophilized nanosuspension. The aerodynamic characteristics of the optimized lyophilized nanosuspension demonstrated significantly higher percentage of total emitted dose (89.70%) and smaller mass median aerodynamic diameter (2.80 \u00b5m) compared with coarse drug powder (73.60% and 4.20 \u00b5m, respectively). In summary, the above strategy confirmed the applicability of formulating CAR in the form of nanoparticles loaded on a coarse carrier suitable for inhalation delivery.", 
    "3": "Visit-to-visit blood pressure (BP) variability is an important predictor of stroke. However, which antihypertensive drug combination is better at reducing visit-to-visit BP variability and therefore at reducing stroke incidence remains uncertain. We have previously reported that the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker benidipine combined with a \u03b2-blocker appeared to be less beneficial in reducing the risk of stroke than a combination of benidipine and thiazide. Here, we further compare the visit-to-visit BP variability among three benidipine-based regimens, namely angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), \u03b2-blocker and thiazide combinations. The present post hoc analysis included 2983 patients without cardiovascular events or death during the first 18 months after randomization. We compared the BP variability (defined as the s.d. and the coefficient of variation (CV)), maximum systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) of the clinic mean on-treatment BPs obtained at 6-month intervals, starting 6 months after the treatment initiation, among the 3 treatments (ARB, n=1026; \u03b2-blocker, n=966; thiazide, n=991). During the first 6-36 months after randomization, both the s.d. and CV-BPs were lower in the benidipine-thiazide group than in the benidipine-\u03b2-blocker group (s.d.-SBP, P=0.019; s.d.-DBP, P=0.030; CV-SBP, P=0.012; CV-DBP, P=0.022). The s.d. and CV in the ARB group did not reach statistical significance compared with the other two groups. The maximum BPs did not differ among the three treatments. These findings suggest that the benidipine-thiazide combination may reduce visit-to-visit BP variability more than the benidipine-\u03b2-blocker combination.", 
    "4": "The effect of topical propranolol gel on the levels of plasma renin, angiotensin II (ATII) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in superficial infantile hemangiomas (IHs) was investigated. Thirty-three consecutive children with superficial IHs were observed pre-treatment, 1 and 3 months after application of topical propranolol gel for the levels of plasma renin, ATII and VEGF in Department of General Surgery of Dongfang Hospital from February 2013 to February 2014. The plasma results of IHs were compared with those of 30 healthy infants of the same age from out-patient department. The clinical efficiency of topical propranolol gel at 1st, and 3rd month after application was 45%, and 82% respectively. The levels of plasma renin, ATII and VEGF in patients pre-treatment were higher than those in healthy infants (565.86 \u00b1 49.66 vs. 18.19 \u00b1 3.56, 3.20 \u00b1 0.39 vs 0.30 \u00b1 0.03, and 362.16 \u00b1 27.29 vs. 85.63 \u00b1 8.14, P < 0.05). The concentrations of VEGF and renin at 1st and 3rd month after treatment were decreased obviously as compared with those pre-treatment (271.51 \u00b1 18.59 vs. 362.16 \u00b1 27.29, and 405.18 \u00b1 42.52 vs. 565.86 \u00b1 49.66 P < 0.05; 240.80 \u00b1 19.89 vs. 362.16 \u00b1 27.29, and 325.90 \u00b1 35.78 vs. 565.86 \u00b1 49.66, P < 0.05, respectively), but the levels of plasma ATII declined slightly (2.96 \u00b1 0.37 vs. 3.20 \u00b1 0.39, and 2.47 \u00b1 0.27 vs. 3.20 \u00b1 0.39, P > 0.05). It was indicated that the increased renin, ATII and VEGF might play a role in the onset or development of IHs. Propranolol gel may suppress the proliferation of IHs by reducing VEGF.",

Moreover, the symmetric extensive wall motion abnormalities (WMA) occurred simultaneously with the development of a systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM) and left ventricular obstruction, and was clinically asymptomatic. Although in TTC the stunning usually occurs for several days, WMA and SAM resolved within few minutes after cessation of dobutamine and administration of a beta-blocker. And finally, exercise echo performed at the same target heart rate few days later did not induce neither a SAM nor WMA, which suggests that left ventricular obstruction could have played a role in the pathogenesis of this case by supply-demand mismatch.

Effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs) are major sources of these substances. The use of sequencing batch reactor (SBR) STPs, involving cycling between aerobic and anoxic conditions to promote nitrification and denitrification, is increasing but these have yet to be understood in terms of removal of pharmaceutical residues. This study reports on the development of a laboratory rig to simulate a SBR. The rig was used to investigate the fate of radiolabelled propranolol. This is a commonly prescribed beta blocker, but with unresolved fate in STPs. The SBR rig (4.5\u00a0L) was operated on an 8\u00a0h batch cycle with settled sewage. Effective treatment was demonstrated, with clearly distinct treatment phases and evidence of nitrogen removal. Radiolabelled (14)C-propranolol was dosed into both single (closed) and continuous (flow-through) simulations over 13 SBR cycles. Radioactivity in CO2 off-gas, biomass and liquid was monitored, along with the characteristics of the sewage. This allowed apparent rate constants and coefficients for biodegradation and solid:water partitioning to be determined. Extrapolation from off-gas radioactivity measurements in the single dose 4-d study suggested that propranolol fell outside the definitions of being readily biodegradable (DegT50\u00a0=\u00a09.1\u00a0d; 60% biodegradation at 12.0\u00a0d). During continuous dosing, 63-72% of propranolol was removed in the rig, but less than 4% of dose recovered as (14)CO2, suggesting that biodegradation was a minor process (Kbiol(M) L kg\u00a0d(-1)\u00a0=\u00a022-49) and that adsorption onto solids dominated, giving rise to accumulations within biomass during the 17\u00a0d solid retention time in the SBR. Estimations of adsorption isotherm coefficients were different depending on which of three generally accepted denominators representing sorption sites was used (mixed liquor suspended solids, reactor COD or mass of waste activated sludge). With further development and evaluation, the rig developed for simulating SBR processes has potential to be used for informing better environmental risk assessments for those pharmaceuticals showing ambiguous results in field fate studies.", 
    "52": "Metabolite accumulation due to ischemia of active skeletal muscle stimulates group III/IV chemosensitive afferents eliciting reflex increases in arterial blood pressure and sympathetic activity, termed the muscle metaboreflex. We and others have previously demonstrated sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction of coronary, renal, and forelimb vasculatures with muscle metaboreflex activation (MMA). Whether MMA elicits vasoconstriction of the ischemic muscle from which it originates is unknown. We hypothesized that the vasodilation in active skeletal muscle with imposed ischemia becomes progressively restrained by the increasing sympathetic vasoconstriction during MMA. We activated the metaboreflex during mild dynamic exercise in chronically instrumented canines via graded reductions in hindlimb blood flow (HLBF) before and after \u03b11-adrenergic blockade [prazosin (50 \u03bcg/kg)], \u03b2-adrenergic blockade [propranolol (2 mg/kg)], and \u03b11 + \u03b2-blockade. Hindlimb resistance was calculated as femoral arterial pressure/HLBF. During mild exercise, HLBF must be reduced below a threshold level before the reflex is activated. With initial reductions in HLBF, vasodilation occurred with the imposed ischemia. Once the muscle metaboreflex was elicited, hindlimb resistance increased. This increase in hindlimb resistance was abolished by \u03b11-adrenergic blockade and exacerbated after \u03b2-adrenergic blockade. We conclude that metaboreflex activation during submaximal dynamic exercise causes sympathetically mediated \u03b1-adrenergic vasoconstriction in ischemic skeletal muscle. This limits the ability of the reflex to improve blood flow to the muscle.",

Respiration was voluntarily regulated and heart rate clamped by RV pacing. Sympathetic and parasympathetic blockade was achieved using intravenous metoprolol and atropine, respectively. Metroprolol reduced the rate of pressure development (maximal change in pressure over time): 1,271 (\u00b1 646) vs. 930 (\u00b1 433) mmHg/s; P < 0.01.

    "69": "Resistance arteries play a key role in the control of local blood flow. They undergo outward remodeling in response to a chronic increase in blood flow as seen in collateral artery growth in ischemic disorders. We have previously shown that mesenteric artery outward remodeling depends on the endothelial estrogen receptor alpha. As outward arterial remodeling is associated with improved endothelium-dependent dilation, we hypothesized that estrogens might also play a role in flow-mediated improvement of endothelium-dependent dilation. Local increase in blood flow in first order mesenteric arteries was obtained after ligation of adjacent arteries in three-month old ovariectomized female rats treated with 17-beta-estradiol (OVX+E2) or vehicle (OVX). After 2 weeks, diameter was equivalent in high flow (HF) than in normal flow (NF) arteries with a greater wall to lumen ratio in HF vessels in OVX rats. Acetylcholine-mediated relaxation was lower in HF than in NF vessels. eNOS and caveolin-1 expression level was equivalent in HF and NF arteries. By contrast, arterial diameter was 30% greater in HF than in NF arteries and the wall to lumen ratio was not changed in OVX+E2 rats. Acetylcholine-mediated relaxation was higher in HF than in NF arteries. The expression level of eNOS was higher and that of caveolin-1 was lower in HF than in NF arteries. Acetylcholine (NO-dependent)-mediated relaxation was partly inhibited by the NO-synthesis blocker L-NAME in OVX rats whereas L-NAME blocked totally the relaxation in OVX+E2 rats. Endothelium-independent relaxation (sodium nitroprusside) was equivalent in OXV and OVX+E2 rats. Similarly, serotonin- and phenylephrine-mediated contractions were higher in HF than in NF arteries in both OVX and OVX+E2 rats in association with high ratio of phosphorylated ERK1/2 to ERK1/2. Thus, we demonstrated the essential role of endogenous E2 in flow-mediated improvement of endothelium (NO)-mediated dilatation in rat mesenteric arteries.", 
    "70": "Previous findings indicate that post-training administration of glucocorticoid stress hormones can interact with the noradrenergic system to enhance consolidation of hippocampus- or amygdala-dependent cognitive/emotional memory. The present experiments were designed to extend these findings by examining the potential interaction of glucocorticoid and noradrenergic mechanisms in enhancement of dorsolateral striatum (DLS)-dependent habit memory. In experiment 1, different groups of adult male Long-Evans rats received training in two DLS-dependent memory tasks. In a cued water maze task, rats were released from various start points and were reinforced to approach a visibly cued escape platform. In a response-learning version of the water plus-maze task, animals were released from opposite starting positions and were reinforced to make a consistent egocentric body-turn to reach a hidden escape platform. Immediately post-training, rats received peripheral injections of the glucocorticoid corticosterone (1 or 3 mg/kg) or vehicle solution. In both tasks, corticosterone (3 mg/kg) enhanced DLS-dependent habit memory. In experiment 2, a separate group of animals received training in the response learning version of the water plus-maze task and were given peripheral post-training injections of corticosterone (3 mg/kg), the \u03b2-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol (3 mg/kg), corticosterone and propranolol concurrently, or control vehicle solution. Corticosterone injections again enhanced DLS-dependent memory, and this effect was blocked by concurrent administration of propranolol. Propranolol administration by itself (3 mg/kg) did not influence DLS-dependent memory. Taken together, the findings indicate an interaction between glucocorticoid and noradrenergic mechanisms in DLS-dependent habit memory. Propranolol administration may be useful in treating stress-related human psychopathologies associated with a dysfunctional DLS-dependent habit memory system.",

She had not undergone the Fontan operation because of insufficient development of pulmonary circulation. Her physical status was New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II, and her oxygen saturation was 80% in room air. She reported no symptoms for the abdominal tumor preoperatively. The surgery was performed under general and epidural anesthesia. After induction of general anesthesia, she developed hypertension and tachycardia, and the manipulation of the tumor worsened them.

The coated capillaries were studied using a series of aqueous buffers of varying pH, ionic strength, and composition. Our results show that the investigated polyelectrolytes are usable as semi-permanent (physically adsorbed) coatings with at least five runs stability before a short coating regeneration is necessary. Both PECs showed a considerably decreased stability at pH 11.0. The EOF was higher using Good's buffers than with sodium phosphate buffer at the same pH and ionic strength. The thickness of the PEC layers studied by quartz crystal microbalance was 0.83 and 0.52 nm for PMOTAI and PIL-1, respectively. The hydrophobicity of the PEC layers was determined by analysis of a homologous series of alkyl benzoates and expressed as the distribution constants. Our result demonstrates that both PECs had comparable hydrophobicity, which enabled separation of compounds with log Po/w > 2. The ability to separate cationic drugs was shown with \u03b2-blockers, compounds often misused in doping.

    "88": "Combining beta-blockers with exposure therapy has been advocated to reduce fear, yet experimental studies combining beta-blockers with memory reactivation have had contradictory results. We explored how beta-blockade might affect the course of safety learning and the subsequent return of fear in a double-blind placebo-controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging study in humans (N=46). A single dose of propranolol before extinction learning caused a loss of conditioned fear responses, and prevented the subsequent return of fear and decreased explicit memory for the fearful events in the absence of drug. Fear-related neural responses were persistently attenuated in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), increased in the hippocampus 24\u2009h later, and correlated with individual behavioral indices of fear. Prediction error-related responses in the ventral striatum persisted during beta-blockade. We suggest that this pattern of results is most consistent with a model where beta-blockade can prevent the return of fear by (i) reducing retrieval of fear memory, via the dmPFC and (ii) increasing contextual safety learning, via the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that retrieval of fear memory and contextual safety learning form potential mnemonic target mechanisms to optimize exposure-based therapy with beta-blockers.",

    "90": "Molecularly imprinting polymers (MIPs) can be modified with external layers in order to obtain restricted access molecularly imprinted polymers (RAMIPs) able to exclude macromolecules and retain low weight compounds. These modifications have been frequently achieved using hydrophilic monomers, chemically bound on the MIP surface. Recently, our group proposed a new biocompatible RAMIP based on the formation of a bovine serum albumin coating on the surface of MIP particles. This material has been used to extract drugs directly from untreated human plasma samples, but its physicochemical evaluation has not been carried out yet, mainly in comparison with RAMIPs obtained by hydrophilic monomers. Thus, we proposed in this paper a comparative study involving the surface composition, microscopic aspect, selectivity, binding kinetics, adsorption and macromolecule elimination ability of these different materials. We concluded that the synthesis procedure influences the size and shape of particles and that hydrophilic co-monomer addition as well as coating with BSA do not alter the chemical recognition ability of the material. The difference between imprinted and non-imprinted polymers' adsorption was evident (suggesting that imprinted polymers have a better capacity to bind the template than the non-imprinted ones). The Langmuir model presents the best fit to describe the materials' adsorption profile. The polymer covered with hydrophilic monomers presented the best adsorption for the template in an aqueous medium, probably due to a hydrophilic layer on its surface. We also concluded that an association of the hydrophilic monomers with the bovine serum albumin coating is important to obtain materials with higher capacity of macromolecule exclusion.", 
    "91": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, a potentially curative therapy for hematologic diseases. It has long been thought that murine bone marrow-derived T cells do not mediate severe GVHD because of their quantity and/or phenotype. During the course of experiments testing the impact of housing temperatures on GVHD, we discovered that this apparent resistance is a function of the relatively cool ambient housing temperature. Murine bone marrow-derived T cells have the ability to mediate severe GVHD in mice housed at a thermoneutral temperature. Specifically, mice housed at Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-mandated, cool standard temperatures (\u223c 22\u00b0C) are more resistant to developing GVHD than are mice housed at thermoneutral temperatures (\u223c 30\u00b0C). We learned that the mechanism underlying this housing-dependent immunosuppression is associated with increased norepinephrine production and excessive signaling through \u03b2-adrenergic receptor signaling, which is increased when mice are cold stressed. Treatment of mice housed at 22\u00b0C with a \u03b22-adrenergic antagonist reverses the norepinephrine-driven suppression of GVHD and yields similar disease to mice housed at 30\u00b0C. Conversely, administering a \u03b22-adrenergic agonist decreases GVHD in mice housed at 30\u00b0C. In further mechanistic studies using \u03b22-adrenergic receptor-deficient (\u03b22-AR(-/-)) mice, we found that it is host cell \u03b22-AR signaling that is essential for decreasing GVHD. These data reveal how baseline levels of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor signaling can influence murine GVHD and point to the feasibility of manipulation of \u03b22-AR signaling to ameliorate GVHD in the clinical setting.", 
    "92": "About 70% of eyedrops contain benzalkonium chloride (BAK) as a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. While preservatives are mandated to maintain sterility, many patients exhibit irritation and toxicity to such compounds. We propose to mitigate the ocular toxicity in the ocular formulations without compromising sterility by designing a device that can be incorporated into an eyedrops bottle to selectively remove the preservatives during the process of drop instillation. Here, we specifically focus on macroporous poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) gel due to its excellent biocompatibility and high partition coefficient for BAK. In addition to specific selectivity for BAK, the device also requires high hydraulic permeability to allow drop dispensing without excessive pressure drop. The pHEMA monolith can remove nearly 100% of contained BAK from a 25 ml, 0.012% BAK solution with negligible uptake of the hydrophilic drugs such as timolol and dorzolamide. The filter, however, had to be pre-equilibrated with hydrophobic drugs to reach a high separation of BAK without reducing the concentration of the active drug. The average hydraulic permeability of the filter was 0.025 Darcy, which is about 5-fold lower than the ideal value. Incorporation of a pHEMA macroporous gel into an eyedrops bottle can virtually eliminate the exposure of the eyes to the preservatives without compromising the sterility. Our novel design can eliminate the preservative induced toxicity from eyedrops thereby impacting hundreds of millions of patients with chronic ophthalmic diseases such as glaucoma and dry eyes.",

The effectiveness of metoprolol to propranolol was compared as well as their use in combination with systemic steroids. In the first month of the treatment with beta-blockers, significant regression of the IH was observed in all patients. During the following months of treatment the regression was not rapid and after 6 to 12 months the lesions remained stationary. The final result of the treatment of 15 patients (71.4%) was deemed excellent while the treatment of 5 patients (23.8%) was deemed good.

In addition, we calculated in silico docking and measured the binding properties of propranolol and bupranolol for all 3 \u03b2-ARs.

Although a few clinical trials have suggested that telmisartan decreases cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients, the molecular mechanism for the beneficial effects remains elusive. Here, we investigated a molecular mechanism and effects of telmisartan on the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and attachment of monocytes onto endothelial cells induced by TNF\u03b1 in hyperglycemia-treated bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Telmisartan dose-dependently decreased hyperglycemia-aggravated I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 (IKK\u03b2) expression and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65-Ser(536) phosphorylation, which accompanied a decrease in VCAM-1 expression and THP-1 monocytes adhesion. Among ARBs, including losartan and fimasartan, only telmisartan showed the inhibitory effects on expression of VCAM-1 and IKK\u03b2, and phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65-Ser(536). The telmisartan's beneficial effects were not changed by pretreatment with GW9662, a specific and irreversible peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) antagonist, although GW9662 clearly inhibited rosiglitazone-induced CD36 expression. Finally, ectopic expression of wild type (WT)-IKK\u03b2 significantly restored telmisartan-attenuated VCAM-1 expression, NF-\u03baB p65-Ser(536) phosphorylation, and THP-1 monocytes adhesion. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that telmisartan ameliorates hyperglycemia-exacerbated vascular inflammation, at least in part, by decreasing expression of IKK\u03b2 and VCAM-1 independently of PPAR\u03b3. Telmisartan may be useful for the treatment of DM-associated vascular inflammation and cardiovascular diseases.",

    "117": "The evaluation of the time-varying vagal and sympathetic contributions to heart rate remains a challenging task because the observability of the baroreflex is generally limited and the time-varying properties are difficult to take into account, especially in non-stationnary conditions. The objective is to propose a model-based approach to estimate the autonomic modulation during a pharmacological challenge. A recursive parameter identification method is proposed and applied to a mathematical model of the baroreflex, in order to estimate the time-varying vagal and sympathetic contributions to heart rate modulation during autonomic maneuvers. The model-based method was evaluated with data from five newborn lambs, which were acquired during injection of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor drugs, on normal conditions and under beta-blockers, so as to quantify the effect of the pharmacological sympathetic blockade on the estimated parameters. After parameter identification, results show a close match between experimental and simulated signals for the five lambs, as the mean relative root mean squared error is equal to 0.0026 (\u00b1 0.003). The error, between simulated and experimental signals, is significantly reduced compared to a batch identification of parameters. The model-based estimation of vagal and sympathetic contributions were consistent with physiological knowledge and, as expected, it was possible to observe an alteration of the sympathetic response under beta-blockers. The simulated vagal modulation illustrates a response similar to traditional heart rate variability markers during the pharmacological maneuver. The model-based method, proposed in the paper, highlights the advantages of using a recursive identification method for the estimation of vagal and sympathetic modulation.", 
    "118": "Measurement of neurotransmitters during normal or altered function in cerebral slices could be an important tool to better understand the relationship between biochemical changes and electrophysiological activity. Some attempts of this analysis have been made; however, the current techniques do not have the appropriate time resolution to establish this relationship. The use of electrochemical biosensors has allowed for good time resolution, but problems related to the reduction of signal noise and biofouling of the electrode surface could be an important issue. In this work, we propose a new alternative to simultaneously measure glutamate and electrical activity with a high temporal resolution in brain slices. This approach is based on the use of enzymatic reactors that generate a fluorescent derivative from glutamate that can be measured at high temporal resolution. The results presented here show a reliable measurement of this neurotransmitter in brain slices obtained from intact animals under the effect of a glutamate transporter blocker DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate as well as the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine. Differences in the levels of glutamate and high frequency and amplitude discharges as an effect of drug administration were found in brain slices obtained from epileptic rats (p<0.05). In conclusion, this method could be used to measure neurotransmitter concentration online at a near physiological temporal resolution, which can then be correlated to the electrical activity that is simultaneously recorded.",

However, few reports have considered the recent findings that ABT can alter drug absorption or have investigated the possible differential inhibition of ABT on intestinal and hepatic metabolism. To address these uncertainties, pharmacokinetic studies under well controlled and defined ABT pretreatment conditions (50 mg/kg, 1 hour ABT i.v. and 16 hours ABT p.o.) were conducted prior to the oral administration of metoprolol, a permeable P450 probe that undergoes extensive intestinal and hepatic metabolism. The pharmacokinetic profile of metoprolol was affected differently by the two ABT pretreatments. An increase in area under the curve of 16-fold with ABT p.o. and 6.5-fold with ABT i.v. was observed compared with control. Based on in vitro studies, this difference could not be attributed to a differential inhibition of intestinal and hepatic metabolism. In the ABT i.v. pretreatment group, the increase in area under the curve was also associated with a prolonged time at maximal concentration (24-fold versus control), suggesting a delay in absorption. This was further confirmed by the administration of a charcoal meal, which resulted in a 7-fold increase in stomach weights in the 1-hour ABT pretreated groups compared with the untreated or 16-hour ABT pretreated rats. Based on these results, we recommend pretreating rats with ABT p.o. 16 hours before the administration of a test compound to preserve the inhibitory effect on intestinal and hepatic metabolism and avoid the confounding effect on drug absorption.",

After the injection of uterotonic drug via uterine muscle and a vein after delivery, the patient developed dyspnea, tachycardia, ST-change on elecrocardiogram and hypotension. It is important in HOCM patients to control heart rate and left ventricular contractile force. We started to infuse beta-blocker (landiolol, 10 \u03bcg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) and improved these symptoms of the patient. This case demonstrates that CSEA is safe for HOCM patients and beta-blocker is effective to improve hemodynamic changes induced by uterotonic drug in these patients.",

    "171": "Bronchodilators are used to improve symptoms and lung function in asthma and COPD. Airway smooth muscle tone is regulated by both muscarinic and \u03b22-adrenergic receptor activity. Large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (KCa) channels are activated by \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonists, via Gs, and suppressed by muscarinic receptor antagonists via Gi. This functional antagonism converges on the G protein/KCa channel linkages. Membrane potential regulated by KCa channels contributes to airway smooth muscle tension via Ca(2+) influx passing through voltage-dependent Ca(2+) (VDC) channels. The Gs/KCa/VDC channel linkage is a key process in not only physiological effects, but also in dysfunction of \u03b22-adrenergic receptors and airway remodeling. Moreover, this pathway is involved in the synergistic effects between \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonists and muscarinic receptor antagonists. Intrinsic efficacy is also an important characteristic for both maintenance and loss of \u03b22-adrenergic action. Allosteric modulators of G protein-coupled receptors contribute not only to this synergistic effect between \u03b22-adrenergic and muscarinic M2 receptors, but also to intrinsic efficacy. The effects of weak partial agonists are suppressed by lowering receptor number, disordering receptor function, and enhancing functional antagonism; in contrast, those of full or strong partial agonists are not suppressed. Excessive exposure to full agonists causes \u03b22-adrenergic desensitization; in contrast, exposure to partial agonists does not cause desensitization. Intrinsic efficacy may provide the rationale for the clinical use of \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonists in asthma and COPD. In conclusion, the G protein/KCa linkage and intrinsic efficacy (allosteric effects) may be therapeutic targets for research and development of novel agents against both airway obstruction and airway remodeling.",

Tafluprost/timolol is available in various EU countries for the reduction of IOP in adults with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to topical monotherapy with \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonists or prostaglandin analogues and require a combination therapy, and who would benefit from preservative-free eye drops. In two multinational, phase III studies, tafluprost/timolol was superior to monotherapy with either preservative-free tafluprost 0.0015\u00a0% once daily or preservative-free timolol 0.5\u00a0% twice daily, and noninferior to concomitant therapy with preservative-free tafluprost 0.0015\u00a0% once daily plus preservative-free timolol 0.5\u00a0% twice daily in lowering IOP in adults with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Tafluprost/timolol was well tolerated in these studies, with a tolerability profile consistent with that of its individual components and with no new adverse reactions observed.

    "182": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the solid state characteristics, drug release and stability of fatty acid-based formulations after processing via prilling and solid lipid extrusion. Myristic acid (MA), stearic acid (SA) and behenic acid (BA) were used as matrix formers combined with metoprolol tartrate (MPT) as model drug. The prilling process allowed complete dissolution of MPT in the molten fatty acid phase, generating semi-crystalline MPT and the formation of hydrogen bonds between drug and fatty acids in the solid prills. In contrast, as solid lipid extrusion (SLE) induced only limited melting of the fatty acids, molecular interaction with the drug was inhibited, yielding crystalline MPT. Although the addition of a low melting fatty acid allowed more MPT/fatty acid interaction during extrusion, crystalline MPT was detected after processing. Mathematical modeling revealed that the extrudates exhibited a higher apparent drug/water mobility than prills of the same composition, probably due to differences in the inner systems' structure. Irrespective of the processing method, mixed fatty acid systems (e.g. MA/BA) exhibited a lower matrix porosity, resulting in a slower drug release rate. Solid state analysis of these systems indicated that the crystalline structure of the fatty acids was maintained after SLE, while prilling generated a reduced MA crystallinity. Binary MPT/fatty acid systems processed via extrusion showed better stability during storage at 40 \u00b0C than the corresponding prills. Although mixed fatty acid systems were stable at 25 \u00b0C, stability problems were encountered during storage at 40 \u00b0C: a faster release was obtained from the prills, whereas drug release from the extrudates was slower.",

In the present study, we determine the effect of REV on NE-induced ovarian cancer invasiveness. Pretreatment of REV significantly inhibited NE-induced ovarian cancer cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition with concomitant recovery of E-cadherin expression. In addition, our data showed that REV downregulates NE-induced human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression through inhibiting Src phosphorylation and HIF-1\u03b1 expression. Further, REV reduced NE-induced Slug expression and subsequent ovarian cancer invasion. More importantly, combined treatment of REV with a pharmacological inhibitor of beta adrenergic receptor significantly attenuated NE-induced ovarian cancer invasion compared to single treatment. Therefore, we demonstrate interference of a Src and HIF-1\u03b1/hTERT/Slug signaling cascade by REV, providing potential therapeutic targets and inhibition of ovarian cancer.",

The present study aimed to elucidate the role of adrenergic signaling in itch hypersensitivity following heterotypic chronic intermittent stress (HIS) in rats. HIS significantly increased hindlimb scratching, but not forepaw swiping, induced by intradermal injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the rat cheek. Coadministration of stress mediators such as norepinephrine or epinephrine dose-dependently increased both 5-HT-induced hindlimb scratching and 5-HT-induced forepaw swiping. HIS-induced itch hypersensitivity was attenuated by blockade of sympathetic signaling through guanethidine treatment, and systemic administration of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and the \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonist butoxamine, but not on treatment with an \u03b1-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine and a \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol. Moreover, HIS selectively increased the expression of \u03b22-adrenoceptors and proinflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and nerve growth factor (NGF)] in rat skin. The \u03b2-blockers propranolol and butoxamine abolished the upregulation of proinflammatory factors. The \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline was sufficient to enhance the skin expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and to increase 5-HT-induced scratching in naive rats. Pretreatment with TNF-\u03b1 could increase 5-HT-induced scratching. Together, these results demonstrate that \u03b22-adrenoceptors mediate itch hypersensitivity following chronic stress by inducing proinflammatory factors, such as TNF-\u03b1, in the skin.",

We report the case of a young man with paralysis of the lower extremities, severe hypokalemia, and concurrent hyperthyroidism. TPP was suspected; therefore, treatment consisting of judicious potassium (K+) repletion and \u03b2-blocker administration was initiated. However, urinary K+ excretion rate, as well as refractoriness to treatment, was inconsistent with TPP. Chronic alcoholism was considered as an alternative cause of hypokalemia, and serum K+ was restored through vigorous K repletion and the addition of K+ -sparing diuretics. The presence of thyrotoxicosis and hypokalemia does not always indicate a diagnosis of TPP. Exclusion of TPP can be accomplished by immediate evaluation of urinary K+ excretion, acid-base status, and the amount of potassium chloride required to correct hypokalemia at presentation.",

We performed a retrospective study between January 2006 and March 2012 to assess diabetic patients with severe hypoglycemia at a single center in Japan. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as the presence of any hypoglycemic symptoms that required the medical assistance of another person after visiting the emergency room by ambulance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify possible predictors of severe hypertension due to severe hypoglycemia and to assess whether prior use of alpha- or beta-blockers is beneficial for the prevention of severe hypertension in diabetic patients with severe hypoglycemia. Multivariate adjustments were made for age, sex, preexisting hypertension, history of ischemic heart disease, blood glucose level upon arrival, estimated GFR, and prior use of alpha- or beta-blockers. A total of 59,602 patients who visited the emergency room were screened and 352 diabetic patients with severe hypoglycemia were enrolled. Incidences of severe hypertension before and at 3 and 6 hours after the initiation of antihypoglycemic treatment were 21.3%, 6.7%, and 0% in patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 61) and 38.8%, 18.2%, and 8.2% in patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 291), respectively.

Electrocardiography, echocardiography and 24-hour electrocardiography monitoring were normal. Head-up tilt table test revealed mixed type vasovagal syncope. With beta-blocker treatment, the frequency of syncopal episodes decreased; however, the episodes with atypical features continued. Intracardiac electrophysiological study was normal, but repeated external loop recorder monitoring revealed transient AVB during a syncopal episode.

Though it is a known inhibitor of glycolysis, propranolol, outside this observation, has never been reported to fully protect against lactate overproduction. On the other hand, literature evidence exists for a cross-talk between \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (protein targets of propranolol) and \u03b4-opioid receptor. In this literature context, it is hypothesized here that anti-diarrheic racecadotril (a pro-drug of thiorphan, an inhibitor of enkephalinases), which, in the cited observation, was co-administered with propranolol, might have facilitated the \u03b2-blocker-driven inhibition of glycolysis and resulting lactate production. The opioid-facilitated \u03b2-adrenergic blockade would be essentially additivity or even synergism putatively existing between antagonism of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors and agonism of \u03b4-opioid receptor in lowering cellular cAMP and dependent functions.",
