    "0": "The selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT increased serum corticosterone concentration in rats in a dose-dependent manner. The synthetic corticoid dexamethasone lowered the serum corticosterone level and abolished its rise induced by 8-OH-DPAT. The corticosterone response to 8-OH-DPAT was also antagonized by spiperone, (+/-)- and (-)-pindolol and (+/-)-propranolol, all of which have been shown to have a high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors, though in most cases no complete blockade was found. A partial antagonism of the response was also observed after flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. On the other hand, the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist 21009, the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists ketanserin and pirenperone, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS 205-930, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine and idazoxan, the beta-adrenoceptor blocker with no affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, atenolol, the dopaminergic antagonist pimozide, the histamine receptor blocker chloropyramine and the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone did not affect the hormonal response to 8-OH-DPAT. The 8-OH-DPAT-induced corticosterone secretion was not affected either in rats pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase) or p-chloroamphetamine (PCA, a drug-inducing lesion of serotonergic nerve terminals). It is concluded that 8-OH-DPAT-induced increase in serum corticosterone concentration results from its action at a site different than the adrenal cortex and is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, whereas other subtypes (5-HT1B, 5-HT2, 5-HT3) of 5-HT receptors do not participate in this response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Among a group of 160 patients (146 men and 14 women) who had been admitted to our hospital under the picture of an unstable angina pectoris and whom we treated according a standardized diagnostic-therapeutic step programme 8.7% of the patients died of a cardiovascular disease during a period of 3 1/2 years. In 8% of our patients an acute myocardial infarction occurred during the period of observation. A diagnostic-therapeutic step programme was the basis for a differential therapy adapted to the individual course of the disease. We think that this therapy concept first of all corresponds to the individual dynamics of the course of the disease of patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "2": "Five patients were noted to have increased intraocular pressure (IOP) during evaluation for acute nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). Three of the five had no prior record of IOP elevation; all five had small cup-to-disc ratios. Elevated IOP may be a risk factor for developing AION, especially in eyes with structurally congested optic discs.", 
    "3": "A study is presented of 67 patients with hypertensive disease (stage II) at the age from 35 to 60 years. Three types of central hemodynamics were singled out: hyperkinetic, hypokinetic and eukinetic. The optimal effect was observed with associated use of Kristepin and obsidan in patients with the hyperkinetic type of hemodynamics. Concentrations of plasma renin and aldosterone cannot be used as criteria for the choice of hypotensive treatment in the above categories of patients.", 
    "4": "The effect of insulin administration on water intake, was studied in children submitted to standard protocols for stimulation of secretion of hypophyseal hormones by i.v. treatment with several different drugs: insulin, insulin plus TRH and LH-RH; and propranolol, clonidine or LH-RH. Drinking was measured from 0 to 90 min after drug administration; from blood samples taken at 60 min for hypophyseal hormones analysis, microhaematocrit values were measured, as well as plasma renin activity (PRA) and glycaemia. Water intake was significantly higher in both groups of patients receiving insulin than in the control group (no insulin). Haematocrit values did not change after 60 min. There was a significant correlation of glycaemia of individuals from all three groups and water intake at 60 min. PRA was significantly higher in insulin treated individuals.", 
    "5": "The ontogeny of renin secretion from renal cortical slices was studied in two groups of fetal (107-109 days of gestation and 131-136 days of gestation; term is 145 days), newborn (3-9 days old), and adult nonpregnant sheep. Isoproterenol (ISO; 10(-8)-10(-5) M) significantly increased active renin secretion in all age groups (P less than 0.05), with newborns having the highest values at all concentrations. However, the percent changes in active renin secretion were similar among all ages. Inactive renin secretion also increased with ISO stimulation, with newborns having the highest rate of inactive renin secretion. The percent of total renin in the active form differed among ages, ranging at base line from 60 +/- 10% in fetuses at greater than 130 days of gestation to 88 +/- 6% in fetuses at less than 110 days of gestation (P less than 0.05). Propranolol (1 microM) inhibited ISO (10(-6) M)-stimulated active renin secretion at all ages. On the other hand, the prostaglandin (PG) synthase inhibitor aspirin (1.6 x 10(-5) M) did not inhibit ISO (10(-6) M)-mediated increases in active renin secretion in fetal (greater than 130 days of gestation) kidney slices and produced values intermediate between base line and ISO alone in newborns and adults.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "The effect of glyburide on myocardial function in human beings is not known. We divided 37 normal male volunteers into five groups. Each group received either intravenous saline solution; 10 mg propranolol by intravenous push followed by 0.1 mg/min; 5 micrograms/kg/min dobutamine; 1000 mg or 1250 mg oral tolbutamide; or 5 mg glyburide. Comparable therapeutic blood levels were obtained. Myocardial function was assessed by measurement of work product (WP, systolic pressure times heart rate) and ejection fraction (EF) by means of radionucleotide ventriculography. There was no change in EF or WP after administration of saline solution and tolbutamide; propranolol decreased EF and WP; dobutamine and glyburide increased EF and WP. In summary, tolbutamide had no effect on myocardial contractility, whereas glyburide increased myocardial contractility as measured by ejection fraction.", 
    "7": "A low-cost, ambulatory blood-pressure monitor has been calibrated and validated against a random zero sphygmomanometer. The repeatability of ambulatory pressure recordings after a placebo month in 44 mild to moderate untreated hypertensives was assessed. Systolic blood pressure showed a mean difference over 1 month of 2.0 mmHg, with a standard deviation of differences of 9.3 mmHg. The diastolic blood pressure mean difference was 0.1 mmHg (SD = 6.3 mmHg). This variability was much less than for clinic readings (SD = 17.3 mmHg) or for single home pressure readings (SD = 19.7 mmHg). Using ambulatory monitoring to detect a drop in pressure of 8/5 mmHg with a power of 0.9, the number of subjects needed in a parallel group trial is reduced from 360 to 68, and in a crossover study from 88 to 16 subjects. The usefulness of ambulatory pressure monitoring is demonstrated in a placebo-controlled comparison of atenolol, nifedipine retard, or their combination in random order. Eleven subjects, 21-60 years, with initial average blood pressures of 166.5/104.7 mmHg, showed a reduction in pressure with atenolol 50 mg a day of 15.1/10.0 mmHg, with nifedipine retard 20 mg b.i.d. of 21.0/11.6 mmHg, and with atenolol 50 mg and nifedipine retard 20 mg once a day of 26.2/16.8 mmHg. Ambulatory monitoring of pressure improved the accuracy of the trial and demonstrated a reduction in the alerting response with atenolol.", 
    "8": "The efficacy of a fixed combination of 10 mg nifedipine and 100 mg acebutolol was tested in 21 patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD). Ejection fraction (EF), emptying and filling rate (VS and VD), and end-systolic volume (ESV) were assessed by means of radionuclide ventriculography at rest and during exercise prior to as well as 1 hour and 5 hours following oral drug application. Whereas exercise-induced worsening of cardiac function had been documented in all the patients prior to medication, EF and ESV improved significantly after drug administration.", 
    "9": "The efficacy and safety of tiapamil, a new calcium-channel blocker, was compared with the cardio-selective beta-blocker atenolol in a 16-week double-blind, multicenter trial with an initial 4-week placebo run-in period. Eighty-one outpatients with WHO stage I or II hypertension, 55 men and 26 women, entered the study. There was a total of nine drop-outs, six in the tiapamil group and three in the atenolol group. Five were due to side effects (four in the tiapamil group and one in the atenolol group). Sixty-one patients performed a graded exercise test sitting on a ergometer bicycle before and after completion of the therapy. Patients eligible for the study after the placebo period received either tiapamil 450 mg b.i.d. or atenolol 100 mg daily. Both drugs lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly. After 12 weeks of therapy, supine blood pressure in the tiapamil group fell from 167/104 mmHg to 154/91 mmHg (p less than 0.005), and in the atenolol group from 166/102 mmHg to 151/89 mmHg (p less than 0.005). A satisfactory reduction in diastolic blood pressure, defined as a reduction of more than 10 mmHg and/or values below or equal to 90 mmHg at the end of the study, was achieved in 29 of 35 patients in the tiapamil group and in 27 of 37 in the atenolol group. No changes in heart rate were observed in the tiapamil group, whereas there was a significant fall in heart rate in the atenolol group. The maximal exercise workload tolerated increased equally in both groups, from 135 to 147 watts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "Sotalol is a beta blocker that has also been reported to exert class III antiarrhythmic effects. To evaluate the effects of sotalol on the immature heart, and specifically to assess the relative importance of its class III action, the electrophysiologic effects of incremental doses of intravenous dl-sotalol (cumulative dose of 8 mg/kg) were studied in 11 intact canines (ages 4-15 days) utilizing intracardiac programmed stimulation and electrogram recording techniques. These results were compared to the electrophysiologic effects obtained in an additional 14 neonatal canines given 0.6 mg/kg of the beta blocker propranolol intravenously. Sotalol caused a greater increase than propranolol in the resting sinus cycle length (45 vs. 4%). Importantly, sotalol resulted in greater increases in atrial and ventricular muscle refractoriness than did propranolol (AERP--77 vs. 4%, AFRP--57 vs. 6%; VERP--53 vs. 4%, VFRP--51 vs. 7%). Thus, the electrophysiologic effects of sotalol include large changes in myocardial refractoriness that are not observed with simple beta blockade induced by propranolol. These results suggest that sotalol exerts a significant class III effect in the immature mammalian heart, and thus may be useful as an antiarrhythmic agent in the neonate.", 
    "11": "We investigated the effects of the new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, bopindolol, on stimulated renin secretion and on renal function in conscious rats. Intravenous doses of 10, 31.6, and 100 micrograms/kg of bopindolol antagonized the rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) induced by the administration of isoproterenol (10 micrograms/kg, s.c.). Peak PRA, evident at 15 min after isoproterenol, reached 27 +/- 3 ng/ml/h with bopindolol (100 micrograms/kg) pretreatment vs. 105 +/- 7 ng/ml/h in saline controls. Antagonism by bopindolol (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) of isoproterenol-stimulated rise in PRA persisted through 12 h. Within this dosage range, bopindolol itself had no significant effect on PRA. Significant antagonism of beta-adrenoceptor-induced hypotension resulted with 31.6 and 100 micrograms/kg of i.v. bopindolol. Orally administered bopindolol produced significant antagonism of isoproterenol-induced increase in PRA at a dose of 316 micrograms/kg; however, oral doses of 31.6-316 micrograms/kg of bopindolol failed to significantly alter furosemide-stimulated increase in PRA. Bopindolol alone had little effect on renal excretory function but caused a slight attenuation of furosemide-induced diuresis and electrolyte excretion. Plasma electrolytes and osmolarity were unaffected by bopindolol alone or in conjunction with furosemide. These results indicate that bopindolol (a) is a potent, long-acting, orally active, antagonist of beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated renin secretion in the rat, (b) is ineffective in antagonizing furosemide-induced rise in PRA, (c) does not elevate basal levels of PRA by virtue of its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and (d) does not cause dramatic alteration of renal excretory function at effective beta-blocking doses.", 
    "12": "Comparative study of the anti-arrhythmic activity of ritmilen, obsidan, cordarone++ and atropine was conducted in 140 patients with ventricular allorhythmia. Data are given on the comparative effectiveness of the intravenous and oral administration of these agents. Ritmilen is highly effective in ventricular extrasystole in the presence of slow sinus rhythm.", 
    "13": "The influence of triiodothyronine (T3) on right ventricular functional parameters was tested and compared to the alterations induced in the left ventricle. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received daily injections of T3 (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) for 3 days and a constant i.v. infusion of 0.9% NaCl or the beta 1-receptor blocker metoprolol (1 mg/kg/h). The hyperthyroid state after 3 days administration of T3 was characterized by an increase in heart rate and cardiac output and a decrease in the systemic peripheral resistance. However, pulmonary vascular resistance was unchanged. Beta-Receptor blockade reduced heart rate to the control level without affecting the elevation in cardiac output. The T3 group showed a marked increase in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and mean pulmonary artery pressure, whereas left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) and mean aortic pressure were not significantly changed. Metoprolol had no effect on LVSP, and attenuated the increase in RVSP. Furthermore, T3 induced a considerable increase in dP/dtmax in both ventricles, which was reduced nearly to control level by concomitant metoprolol infusion. The T3-induced percentage weight gain of the right ventricular free wall (RV) was more pronounced than that of the left ventricle (LV) as indicated by the significant increase in the RV/LV weight and the RNA/DNA ratios. Metoprolol did not affect significantly the T3-induced left and right ventricular hypertrophy, but attenuated slightly the elevated RV/LV weight ratio. Our results indicate a different action of T3 on systemic and pulmonary circulation.", 
    "14": "Conjunctival leucoplakia was induced by the local beta-blocker metipranolol in one case. Withdrawal of the drug and application of all-trans retinoic acid ointment resulted in resolving of the keratinisation. A striking pharmacological resemblance is discovered between metipranolol and practolol. Metipranolol seems to be a less toxic phenol derivative of practolol. Nevertheless, it seems able to act as antigen.", 
    "15": "1. 3H-gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) release elicited by a depolarizing K+ stimulus or by noradrenergic transmitter was examined in rat pineals in vitro. 2. The release of 3H-GABA was detectable at a 20 mM K+ concentration in medium and increased steadily up to 80 mM K+. 3. In a Ca2+-free medium 3H-GABA release elicited by 30 mM K+, but not that elicited by 50 mM K+, became blunted. 4. Norepinephrine (NE; 10(-6)-10(-4) M) stimulated 3H-GABA release from rat pineal explants in a dose-dependent manner. 5. The activity of 10(-5) M NE on pineal GABA release was suppressed by equimolecular amounts of prazosin or phentolamine (alpha 1- and alpha 1/alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockers, respectively) and was unaffected by propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor blocker). 6. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (10(-7)-10(-5) M) and the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol (10(-5) M) mimicked the GABA releasing activity of NE, while 10(-7) M isoproterenol failed to affect it; the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (10(-7)-10(-5) M) did not modify 3H-GABA release. 7. The addition of 10(-4) M GABA or of the GABA transaminase inhibitor gamma-acetylenic GABA or aminooxyacetic acid inhibited the melatonin content and/or release to the medium in rat pineal organotypic cultures. 8. GABA at concentrations of 10(-5) M or greater partially inhibited the NE-induced increase in melatonin production by pineal explants. 9. The depressant effect of GABA on melatonin production was inhibited by the GABA type A receptor antagonist bicuculline; bicuculline alone increased the pineal melatonin content. Baclofen, a GABA type B receptor agonist, did not affect the pineal melatonin content or release. 10. The decrease in serotonin (5-HT) content of rat pineal explants brought about by NE was not modified by GABA; GABA by itself increased 5-HT levels. 11. These results indicate that (a) GABA is released from rat pineals by a depolarizing stimulus of K+ through a mechanism which is partially Ca2+ dependent; (b) NE releases rat pineal GABA via interaction with alpha 1-adrenoceptors; (c) GABA inhibits melatonin production in vitro via interaction with GABA type A receptor sites; and (d) GABA's effect on NE-induced melatonin release does not correlate with the lack of effect on the NE-induced decrease in pineal 5-HT content.", 
    "16": "Fifteen patients (mean age 30) presenting with right ventricular tachycardia (VT) of the outflow tract type (left bundle branch block with inferior axis morphology), in the absence of obvious organic heart disease, were studied. Seven patients had palpitations, one presyncope and seven were asymptomatic. The echo and/or angiographic findings were normal in 11 patients (73%), suggesting arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) in three (20%) and dubious in one (7%). The VT was sustained in three patients (20%), nonsustained (11 +/- 6 beats) in twelve (80%), inducible during exercise in two out of 15 patients (13%) and with ventricular stimulation in one out of eight (12.5%). Four patients were treated with sotalol, three with Class IC drugs and one with amiodarone. At follow-up of 36 +/- 30 months, only three patients had VT recurrences due to drug withdrawal.", 
    "17": "(1) abnormal echo and/or angiographic findings suggested that ARVD was observed in a minority of the patients (22%); (2) the low inducibility of VT and the good response to sotalol suggested a possible mechanism of abnormal automaticity; and (3) at a 3-year follow-up the prognosis appeared to be good in both patients with or without echo-angiographic signs suggestive of right ventricular dysplasia.", 
    "18": "A double-blind crossover study was performed in 20 patients to verify the efficacy of tocainide plus metoprolol in patients with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) class Lown greater than or equal to 2 (mean frequency greater than or equal to 30/h) judged as being \"stable\" by at least three basal 24-h Holter ECGs with PVC variation of less than +/- 25%. All 20 patients were submitted to a placebo period; and all were subsequently randomized to therapy with tocainide 1800 mg/day or metoprolol 200 mg/day for 15 days and then to tocainide 1800 mg + metoprolol 200 mg/day or tocainide 1200 mg + metoprolol 200 mg/day for 15 days, followed by a crossover of the two combination treatments. At steady state in every stage we controlled for plasma levels of the drugs, a 24-h Holter recording, and a 12-lead ECG. A modified Lown score was evaluated together with the Lown class. Tocainide (mean plasma level 3.3 +/- 0.7 micrograms/ml) was efficacious in 3 of 8 patients, the modified Lown score decreased from 63 +/- 32 (placebo period) to 42 +/- 27 (p less than 0.01) and Lown 4B arrhythmias were abolished in 3 of 4 patients. Metoprolol (mean plasma level 97.4 +/- 89.6 ng/ml) was efficacious in 2 of 10 patients; the modified Lown score and Lown classes did not change significantly. Administration of tocainide 1200 mg + metoprolol 200 mg obtained a positive response in 9 of 12 patients, the modified Lown score decreased significantly compared with placebo (from 53 +/- 31 to 32 +/- 30, p less than 0.01) and Lown 4B arrhythmias were abolished in 2 of 5 cases. Tocainide 1800 mg plus metoprolol 200 mg was scarcely tolerated owing to neurologic and gastroenteric side effects, and only three patients completed this stage with no better antiarrhythmic results compared to the lower dose. In conclusion, the combination of tocainide at 1200 mg and metoprolol 200 mg is well tolerated, efficacious in a high percentage of patients, and superior to single drug therapy in patients with stable PVCs.", 
    "19": "Electrical stimulation of a lateral region of the cerebellar nodulus-uvula transition zone in anesthetized albino rabbits decreases mean arterial blood pressure in direct proportion to stimulus intensity. The hypotension has an abrupt onset and is phasic; heart rate is unaffected. Neural pathways that might mediate the depressor response were studied using autonomic-blocking agents. Pretreatment with 2 mg/kg iv of either propranolol HCl or atropine methyl nitrate did not alter the onset or duration of the hypotensive response. However, pretreatment with 2 mg/kg iv phentolamine HCl abolished the depressor response, and 7 mg.kg-1.min-1 iv tetraethylammonium infusion decreased the response by more than 50%. Ipsilateral injections of 200 ng bicuculline methiodide into an area immediately dorsal to the superior cerebellar peduncle or the dorsal aspect of the superior vestibular nucleus reversibly attenuated the nodulus-uvula evoked depression. Anterograde horseradish peroxidase-wheat germ agglutinin (HRP-WGA) transport experiments revealed that both these regions receive direct inputs from the nodulus-uvula. These data suggest that hypotensive events elicited by lateral nodulus-uvula stimuli represent a central, alpha-aminobutyric acid-mediated, phasic inhibition of vasomotor drive mediated through autonomic ganglia to alpha-adrenoreceptors in the vasculature.", 
    "20": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine if alpha 2-adrenergic receptor activation suppresses the effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) on glucose and fatty acid metabolism in isolated rat enterocytes. VIP (10(-7) M) produced an acute 40% inhibition of glucose oxidation and a 115% stimulation of palmitate oxidation. Addition of epinephrine (10(-6) M) together with propranolol (10(-6) M) to avoid interference with beta-adrenoreceptors did not affect basal glucose and palmitate oxidation, but suppressed the effects of VIP by more than 90%. The inhibition by VIP of pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetylcoenzyme-A carboxylase, the enzymes considered as the target sites for the neuropeptide, was also abolished by epinephrine. We assumed that epinephrine acted through the stimulation of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, since 1) epinephrine suppressed VIP-induced accumulation of cAMP in the cells; and 2) the alpha 2-agonist clonidine (10(-6) M) reproduced epinephrine effects, whereas they were abolished by the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine (10(-6) M). These findings strengthen the assumption that VIP controls glucose and fatty acid metabolism by a cAMP-dependent mechanism and demonstrate, for the first time, that the contribution of substrates as energy fuel is under dual neurohormonal regulation by VIP and catecholamines in isolated rat enterocytes.", 
    "21": "ATP, noradrenaline and KCl induced contractions of the isolated guinea-pig vas deferens. The ATP-induced contraction was potentiated by decreasing the external calcium concentration and was reduced by increasing the external calcium concentration. The maximum potentiation was obtained at a low calcium concentration (0.8 mM), the dose-response curve for ATP was shifted to the left in a parallel fashion at this concentration. Calcium antagonists, such as verapamil and diltiazem and MnCl2, induced a similar potentiation. On the other hand, the noradrenaline- and KCl-induced contractions were reduced by calcium antagonists and by decreasing the external calcium concentration. The ATP- and KCl-induced contractions were slightly potentiated by the removal of Mg ions from the medium, but the contractile response to ATP was not potentiated by pretreatment with difluorodinitrobenzene, an ecto-ATPase inhibitor. These results suggest that the affinity of P2-purinoceptors for ATP may be regulated by calcium sites to which calcium and calcium antagonists can bind.", 
    "22": "The rate-dependent effects of OPC-8212 (6 microM), a new positive inotropic drug which lengthens cardiac action potential duration were studied in dog cardiac Purkinje fibers and compared to the effects of sotalol (30 microM), a class III antiarrhythmic using conventional microelectrode technique. Both OPC-8212 and sotalol lengthened action potential duration in a frequency-dependent manner. Both had a greater effect at slower pacing frequencies than at fast. The maximum rising velocity of the action potential upstroke was not affected by either compound at any of the pacing cycle lengths applied (300-2000 ms). The effects of OPC-8212 and sotalol on action potential duration and maximum rising velocity were also compared following abrupt changes in pacing cycle length (i.e. coupling intervals ranging between approximately 250-3000 ms). The effects of both OPC-8212 and sotalol following abrupt changes in pacing cycle length were similar to one another. Neither OPC-8212 nor sotalol altered the time constants for restitution of action potential duration or the kinetics for recovery of the maximum rising velocity of the action potential upstroke. These results indicate that the rate-dependent electrophysiological effects of OPC-8212 closely mimic those of sotalol and suggest that OPC-8212 may be an effective class III antiarrhythmic in addition to being a positive inotropic compound.", 
    "23": "The 5-HT1A receptor subtype agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (50-1000 micrograms/kg s.c.) dose dependently increased rat plasma corticosterone. Tube restraint for 30 min also increased plasma corticosterone; this effect was completely blocked by (-)-pindolol (1 mg/kg i.p.). Increases of corticosterone following either 8-OH-DPAT injection or restraint were significantly greater in female animals. The restraint stress-induced changes but not those due to 8-OH-DPAT were decreased by pretreatment with the tranquiliser chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg i.p.). In anaesthetized rats, restraint no longer significantly affected corticosterone levels but 8-OH-DPAT caused increases which (though much attenuated) were significantly greater in the females. Dose-dependent increases of plasma corticosterone also resulted on infusing 8-OH-DPAT (500-1500 ng) into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus; increases were significantly greater in the females. As mentioned in the discussion, these results may be relevant to the greater incidents of depression in women and the possible role of adrenal corticoids in the illness.", 
    "24": "It has been reported that 6-aminomethyl-3-methyl-4H,1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1, 1-dioxide (AMBD, TAG) is a specific blocker of taurine and beta-alanine responses in the central nervous system. We have re-examined the effect of AMBD on amino acid and synaptically evoked responses recorded from isolated hemisected frog spinal cords by means of the sucrose gap technique. When indirect responses were blocked by adding tetrodotoxin (0.2 microM) or manganese chloride (2 mM) to the normal Ringer solution, AMBD (0.01-0.5 mM) selectively antagonized taurine, beta-alanine, hypotaurine and kojic amine evoked depolarizations of primary afferents at their intramedullary part (dorsal root terminals, DRT) and on dorsal root ganglia (DRG), without significantly affecting responses to glutamate (on DRT), glycine (on DRT) or GABA (on DRT and DRG). Depolarizing responses to taurine and beta-alanine (1 mM) were depressed by up to 50% with 0.1 mM AMBD and often completely antagonized with 0.25 mM AMBD. In normal Ringer solution, AMBD selectively antagonized the dorsal root potential evoked by ventral root stimulation (VR-DRP, threshold at 0.02 mM AMBD, 90% block with 0.25 mM); other synaptic potentials increased in duration and/or amplitude, demonstrating a strong convulsant effect of AMBD. Thus, the depolarizing responses of taurine, beta-alanine and hypotaurine on primary afferents are pharmacologically indistinguishable from the VR-DRP. These results are in agreement with the proposal that taurine or a taurine-like substance (possibly beta-alanine or hypotaurine) is the mediator of VR-DRP in amphibian spinal cord.", 
    "25": "In isolated heart cells, beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation induced a background current that was suppressed by simultaneous muscarinic receptor stimulation. Direct activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin also elicited this current, suggesting regulation by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP). This current could be recorded when sodium, calcium, and potassium currents were eliminated by channel antagonists or by ion substitution. Alteration of the chloride equilibrium potential produced changes in the reversal potential expected for a chloride current. Activation of this chloride current modulated action potential duration and altered the resting membrane potential in a chloride gradient-dependent manner.", 
    "26": "The effects of beta-selective blockade with metoprolol on the glucagon blood plasma level during insulin-induced hypoglycemia were studied in 20 control dogs, and 20 alloxan diabetic dogs. The results indicate that the sensitivity to exogenous insulin is increased in alloxan diabetes glucose counterregulatory mechanisms are impaired. After insulin administration glucagon concentration increased much more and quicker in the control group than in diabetic dogs. Beta-blockade with metoprolol increased glucagon secretion in both groups.", 
    "27": "Fifty patients with non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis who were admitted to hospital because of upper gastrointestinal bleeding were randomly assigned to treatment with either oral propranolol given in doses that reduced the resting pulse rate by 25% (25 patients) or with a placebo (25 patients). One year after the start of the study 20 patients in the propranolol group and five patients in the placebo group were free from recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding (p less than 0.0001). Giving continuous oral propranolol treatment is therefore effective in preventing recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis.", 
    "28": "The effect of ginkgolide B (BN 52021), a specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, applied in doses of 1.5, 3.0, 6.0 X 10(-5) and 1.2 X 10(-4) mol/l, in comparison to that of metoprolol (10(-5) mol/l) and diltiazem (10(-7) mol/l), two widely used antiarrhythmic agents, on ischemia- and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias and heart functions, such as heart rate (HR), coronary flow (CF), aortic flow (AF), left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), its first derivative (LVdp/dtmax), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in isolated working rat hearts was examined. BN 52021 caused a dose-related protection against dysrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and premature ventricular beats induced by ischemia (30 min ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery). The antiarrhythmic effect of BN 52021 given in a dose of 6.0 X 10(-5) mol/l was comparable to that of diltiazem and superior to the activity of metoprolol. None of the drugs influenced reperfusion-induced rhythm disturbances. BN 52021 did not alter heart functions, while metoprolol reduced (LVEDP only, and diltiazem increased CF, decreased AF, LVDP, and LVdp/dtmax during regional ischemia, indicating a negative inotropic effect. The antiarrhythmic effect of BN 52021 appears to be related to an antagonism of an increase in slow calcium influx induced by PAF in myocardial cells. Similarly to the mechanism of action of established antiarrhythmic drugs, BN 52021 can presumably prevent the re-entry mechanism involved in the development of ischemia-induced rhythm disturbances.", 
    "29": "Radioligand binding studies and studies in which inositol phosphate levels were assayed have provided substantial evidence for the existence of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in isolated rat ventricular myocytes, a pure cardiac preparation free of neuronal and vascular elements. Since correlational electrophysiological studies have not been carried out in this model, we investigated alpha-adrenergic effects on action potentials using intracellular microelectrodes to impale the myocytes. Epinephrine, in the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M), rapidly increased the action potential duration in a concentration-dependent manner (threshold concentration of 30 nM, EC50 of 100 nM). The maximal upstroke velocity and overshoot of Ca2+-mediated action potentials (15 mM K+) were also increased. Epinephrine did not significantly affect the resting membrane potential. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (10(-7) M) blocked epinephrine's effects. LiCl (10 mM), an inhibitor of inositol-phosphate phosphatases potentiated the effects of epinephrine (30 nM). The results suggest that the isolated rat cardiomyocyte is a suitable preparation for examining the ionic and molecular mechanisms of direct alpha-adrenergic effects on the cardiac membrane.", 
    "30": "The beta-adrenergic antagonist activities of a p-toluidide and a p-trifluoromethylanilide derivative of propranolol were tested in intact rats to determine whether the unusual in vitro profiles on myocardium and adipose tissue were found in vivo. The relative potencies of p-toluidide derivatives studied in pithed rats were 1.3 for the rate of change in left ventricular pressure with respect to time (dP/dt) and 4.6 for heart rate (HR) compared to propranolol. The values for p-trifluoromethylanilide were 2.5 (dP/dt) and 4.6 (HR). The SR-isomer of the p-toluidide derivative was 81 times more potent than propranolol in inhibiting effects on dP/dt and 27 times more effective than propranolol on HR, whereas the SS-isomer was 0.17 times (dP/dt) and 0.16 times (HR) as potent as the parent compound. In fasted rats, infusion of isoproterenol resulted in an increase of 10.6 +/- 3.1 mg/dl in plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and an increase of 46 +/- 9 mg/dl in glucose. Unlike propranolol, neither the p-toluidide nor the p-trifluoromethylanilide derivative blocked the increase in plasma NEFA, although they both blocked the increase in plasma glucose. It appeared that the p-toluidide and p-trifluoromethylanilide derivatives of propranolol were more selective for the beta 1-adrenergic receptors on the heart as opposed to the beta 1-like adrenoceptors on adipose tissue. These findings were qualitatively and generally quantitatively in agreement with our previous findings in vitro. Therefore, the in vitro data may be useful in predicting atypical and tissue selective in vivo effects of these types of compounds.", 
    "31": "Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker agent widely used in a number of cardiovascular disorders, increases plasminogen activator (PA) activity in confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). This effect is time and dose dependent (10-100 microM). Hybridization studies with specific cDNA showed that propranolol was able to induce an increase in urokinase mRNA expression in a dose and time dependent manner. The propranolol effect seems to be specific for urokinase mRNA, because it does not affect a-actin mRNA expression. Cycloheximide, similarly to propranolol, also increases urokinase mRNA, indicating that the gene expression may be regulated by some rapidly turning over protein. When compounds were used in combination, a superinduction phenomenon was observed.", 
    "32": "We studied the behavior of intraocular pressure in glaucoma suspects randomly selected to receive either topical timolol or no treatment over the course of a long-term prospective follow-up study. All patients who after six years of follow-up showed no localized field defects or disk changes, or whose pressures were not dangerously increased (24 treated and 22 untreated patients), were included in the present study. Overall, the two groups showed an increase in pressure followed by a gentle leveling off and a decrease toward the end of the follow-up period. The pressure-time curves of the two groups were parallel and vertically separated by 4.94 mm Hg. When pressure-time relationships were determined in individual patients, the categorical group differences were not statistically significant. Our results suggest that most glaucoma suspects did not exhibit a random time-course of intraocular pressure and that the effect of treatment was simply to lower the pressure-time curve of the treated group by a fixed level throughout the six-year follow-up period.", 
    "33": "In a controlled, double-observer, multicenter study, we compared the effect of a fixed combination of timolol 0.5%-pilocarpine 4% twice a day with that of timolol 0.5% twice a day plus pilocarpine 4% three times a day in 80 patients with open-angle glaucoma whose intraocular pressure was greater than 21 mm Hg on timolol 0.5% twice a day alone. Administered twice daily, the combination drug lowered intraocular pressure as effectively as concomitant treatment with timolol twice a day and pilocarpine three times a day. No statistically significant differences in reduction of intraocular pressure were found between the two groups nor were any unexpected side effects observed.", 
    "34": "The 1-year prognosis of 293 patients discharged alive from the hospital after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), who experienced primary ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the acute phase, was compared with that of a reference group of 6,337 patients identified from the same population included in the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto miocardico (GISSI) trial. There was no difference in the 6- and 12-month mortality between the patients with primary VF and the reference group (3.7 vs 2.7% and 4.1 vs 4.2%, respectively). Survival of the 2 groups was also similar when patients were stratified according to infarct site (anterior and posterior), and whether or not they received treatment with streptokinase during AMI. Thus, long-term mortality of patients discharged alive after AMI complicated by primary VF is low and is not influenced by previous fibrinolytic therapy or by infarct site. The excess mortality of patients with primary VF is confined to the hospital phase, after which survivors represent a low-risk subgroup.", 
    "35": "In 242 patients with hypertension and/or angina pectoris, a new cardioselective betablocker without ISA, bisoprolol (Concor), was tested. The average mean value of 168/102 mm Hg was lowered in the 174 hypertensive patients by a systolic value of 17 and a diastolic value of 11 mm Hg. A normal diastolic pressure of 95 mm Hg or below was attained within 4 weeks in 73% of patients. Angina pectoris improved from 7 attacks per week before treatment to 3 attacks after 2 weeks; patients with additional hypertension showed a further improvement after another two weeks to an average of 1.7 attacks per week. Side effects were most frequently dizziness, headache and fatigue and also a few patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, an unusual side effect with this treatment. The results show the effective antihypertensive and antianginal action of bisoprolol in a large group of outpatients.", 
    "36": "The contribution of adrenoceptors and purine receptors in mediating neurogenic vasoconstriction was investigated in the autoperfused intestinal circulation of anaesthetised cats treated with atropine and propranolol. Prazosin (0.5 mg/kg) and yohimbine (1.5 mg/kg) reduced but did not abolish the vasoconstrictor responses to stimulation of the efferent sympathetic nerves. The inhibitory actions of the two antagonists were additive but even after alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade nerve stimulation still elicited a residual, frequency-related vasoconstriction. The initial, rapid, phase of this response was completely abolished after desensitisation of P2x-purinoceptors with a high dose (1.5 mg i.a.) of alpha,beta-methylene ATP. In the absence of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, alpha,beta-methylene ATP reduced neurogenic vasoconstriction particularly at low frequency (1 Hz) nerve stimulation, but also caused a short-lasting decrease in noradrenaline and methoxamine responses which indicates that the drug may have some non-specific effects on arterial smooth muscle. The results suggest that neurotransmission in arterial resistance vessels of the cat intestinal circulation is predominantly under adrenergic control mediated by postsynaptic alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, with a possible purine involvement in the initial rapid response of the blood vessels, particularly to low frequency nerve stimulation.", 
    "37": "The beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulatory effects of the partial beta 1-agonists acebutolol, xamoterol, H142/08 and H201/70 were investigated in the isolated right atrium (frequency response) of the rat. All the partial agonists studied induced a concentration-dependent increase in atrial rate. This effect was antagonized by the beta 1-selective blocker pafenolol. The concentrations of H142/08 and H201/70 needed to produce a half maximal response (-log EC50: pD2) were significantly greater than those required to occupy half the receptor population (-log equilibrium dissociation constant: pKB). These compounds required a fractional receptor occupancy of 80-90% to produce half the maximal stimulatory effect while the corresponding receptor occupancy for the other partial agonists studied was about 20%. The maximal stimulatory effect (intrinsic activity) generated by the compounds in the right atrium was (mean +/- S.D.): xamoterol 60 +/- 11%, H142/08 30 +/- 9%, H201/70 18 +/- 3% and acebutolol 17 +/- 8%. In addition, the stimulatory potency of the partial agonists was calculated as the efficacy (e) of the compounds relative to that of isoprenaline. The relative efficacy, expressed as -log[e(partial agonist/e(isoprenaline)] was: xamoterol 2.2 +/- 0.4, acebutolol 3.0 +/- 0.2, H142/08 3.4 +/- 0.2 and H201/70 3.6 +/- 0.2. It is concluded that partial beta 1-agonists have different relationships between their stimulatory effect and fractional receptor occupancy. There was a poor correlation between the intrinsic activity and relative efficacy of partial beta 1-agonists in the right atrium.", 
    "38": "The effects of intraperitoneal administration of isoproterenol (a mixed beta 1- and beta 2-agonist), dobutamine (a selective beta 1-agonist) and clenbuterol (a selective beta 2-agonist) on gastric emptying were investigated in mice killed 30 min after gavage with a 51Cr radiolabeled milk meal. Administered 30 min prior to the meal, isoproterenol (2 mg/kg) and dobutamine (1 and 2 mg/kg) accelerated gastric emptying and clenbuterol (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) slowed it. The stimulation of gastric emptying by isoproterenol (2 mg/kg) and dobutamine (2 mg/kg) was blocked by the previous administration of either mixed beta 1- and beta 2-antagonist, propranolol (1 mg/kg), or a specific beta 1-antagonist, acebutolol (1 mg/kg). Only propranolol (1 mg/kg) antagonized the decrease of gastric emptying induced by clenbuterol. A high dose of propranolol (10 mg/kg), injected alone, reduced gastric emptying. It is concluded that the increase in gastric emptying caused by beta-adrenergic drugs is mediated through beta 1-adrenoceptors, while beta 2-receptors are involved in the inhibition of this function. The lack of effects of propranolol at doses able to block the action of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists suggests that beta-adrenoceptors are not physiologically involved in the control of gastric emptying.", 
    "39": "Vaccination of guinea pigs with Haemophilus influenzae leads to an impairment of beta-adrenoceptor function in lung. We have used an autoradiographic technique to study the distribution of changes in lung beta-adrenoceptor density. H. influenzae induced a decrease in beta-adrenoceptors in peripheral lung membranes of 22 +/- 5% (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 7), while the affinity of binding was unaffected. Tracheal beta-adrenoceptor binding was not influenced by H. influenzae. Autoradiography revealed a 27% reduction in beta-adrenergic binding sites on alveolar septa. Bronchial epithelial beta-adrenoceptors were decreased for 36%, and vascular smooth muscle and endothelial beta-adrenoceptors were also reduced. beta-Adrenoceptors on airway smooth muscle were unaffected. H. influenzae affected both the beta 1- and beta 2-subtypes of receptors. It is concluded that in this animal model of atopy beta-adrenoceptors may be decreased on several different cell types within the lungs, which may influence overall airway and vascular reactivity.", 
    "40": "Exercise capacity increases to a variable degree in coronary patients during cardiac rehabilitation. The effect of baseline exercise-induced ischemia on the response to a 12-week conditioning program was evaluated in 106 coronary patients. The magnitude of exercise conditioning response was greater in nonischemic patients than in ischemic patients, with maximal exercise intensity increasing 69 versus 50% (7.2 to 12.1 vs 7.1 to 10.6 METs) (p less than 0.05) and maximal oxygen consumption increasing 28 versus 10% (23.1 to 29.6 vs 23.0 to 25.4 cc/kg/min) (p less than 0.05). Markers of conditioning during submaximal exercise such as heart rate and heart rate-systolic blood pressure product were similarly reduced in both groups. The groups did not differ by age, diagnosis, resting ejection fraction, incidence of beta-blocker use, maximal exercise capacity, maximal exercise heart rate, blood pressure or intensity of actual exercise training. These results suggest that exercise-induced ischemia alters the stimulus to adapt to exercise training.", 
    "41": "The effect of glucocorticoids on the response of adenylate cyclase in fetal rat lung fibroblast and Type II epithelial cell cultures to beta-agonists and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was investigated. There was significant stimulation of cyclic AMP synthesis by adrenalin in both fibroblasts and Type II cells, which was potentiated in a dose-dependent manner by cortisol. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase by PGE2 (10-1000 nM) was demonstrated in fibroblasts but not in Type II cells. The response to PGE2 was stimulated by pretreatment with cortisol only in fibroblasts (p less than .01), and no latent response to PGE2 was evident in Type II cells after cortisol treatment. These experiments suggest that both cell types isolated from late gestation fetal lung contain active beta-agonist and glucocorticoid receptors that synergize in raising intracellular cyclic AMP, which has multiple effects, including surfactant secretion from Type II cells. Since the adenylate cyclase response to PGE2 and its enhancement by glucocorticoids occurred only in fibroblasts, it is concluded that the reported effects of PGE2 on surfactant release are not mediated via raised intracellular cyclic AMP in Type II cells.", 
    "42": "Intraabdominal (IAB) injections or topical application of neurotensin (NT) to the serosal surface of the ileum or stomach evoked dose-dependent increases of blood pressure and of heart rate in anesthetized guinea pigs. These effects were markedly reduced by prior animal treatment with a ganglion blocker, alpha and beta adrenoceptor blockers, as well as by exposure of the abdominal organs to lidocaine, a local anesthetic. The blood pressure and heart rate responses to IAB injections or topical application of NT to the ileum or stomach were both inhibited by animal pretreatment with capsaicin. Cervical vagotomy or atropine pretreatment did not prevent or alter the cardiovascular responses to IAB injections of NT. These results suggest the presence in some organs and/or tissues of the abdominal cavity of sympathetic, capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerve fibers which, upon stimulation by NT, produce reflex increases of blood pressure and of heart rate.", 
    "43": "This review of the literature covers the clinical results of treatment with beta-blockers in those forms of cardiac ischaemia characterised by a coronary vasomotor component. Particular consideration is given to a paper by Mulcahy et al. which confirms and reinforces the results of other clinical works on the therapeutic effectiveness of the cardioselective beta-blocker atenolol in these mixed forms of ischaemia (fixed coronary stenosis plus dynamic coronary stenosis). The effectiveness of atenolol proved greater or at least on a par with that of the calcium antagonist nifedipine. The probable mechanisms underlying these clinical results are described and it is concluded by noting the therapeutic potentiation obtainable using the beta-blocker together with nifedipine.", 
    "44": "Smooth muscle relaxing effect of vitamin K3 was tested by using isolated rat Vas deferens, normal and K+-depolarized rat duodenum. The contractions of the rat Vas deferens elicited by noradrenaline and phenylephrine were inhibited by vitamin K3, noncompetitively. Vitamin K3 inhibited the Ca2+-induced contractions of the K+-depolarized rat duodenum in a noncompetitive manner. The inhibitory effect of vitamin K3 on the K+-depolarized rat duodenum was evaluated by comparing it with that of verapamil, a well-known Ca2+-channel blocker and of trifluoperazine, a calmodulin inhibitor. Further, it was observed that vitamin K3 exerts a dose-dependent relaxing effect on the normal rat duodenum. The effect of vitamin K3 was compared with that of adrenaline, isoprenaline and papaverine. In addition, propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, and nicotinic acid, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, were used as tools in order to investigate the mechanism of the relaxing action of vitamin K3 on smooth muscle.", 
    "45": "A study was made of 14 thoracotomized dogs under i.v. sodium thiopental anesthesia; the effects of 1.5 mg/kg intravenous ATP on sinus node automatism and atrio-ventricular conduction were investigated. In 7 dogs (group A) ATP was administered under control conditions and following successive intravenous administrations of atropine (1 mg/kg), aminophylline (5 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.6 mg/kg). The remaining 7 dogs (group B) received ATP following atropine (1 mg/kg), isoproterenol (0.4 microgram/kg/min.), and aminophylline (5 mg/kg). An analysis was made of the percentage variations in cardiac cycle length during spontaneous rhythm and of the AH interval during atrial pacing at a fixed rate. In group A the negative dromotropic and chronotropic effects of ATP under control conditions decreased in 5 cases following atropine, although the average decrease was not statistically significant. On adding aminophylline, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the effects of ATP, and following propranolol the drop in negative chronotropic effect of ATP provoked by aminophylline was maintained. In group B, and following prior atropinization, the negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects of ATP were maintained in the presence of isoproterenol. As in group A, aminophylline significantly reduced the effects of ATP. To conclude: in the thoracotomized dog under sodium thiopental anesthesia, 1) atropine does not prevent the negative chronotropic and dromotropic actions of ATP, although the effect of the latter is decreased in a large percentage of cases; 2) sympathetic beta stimulation following prior atropinization does not prevent ATP action; 3) aminophylline in the atropinized dog noticeably reduces the effects of ATP, and 4) this action of aminophylline is effective in the presence of sympathetic beta stimulation.", 
    "46": "To characterize the haemodynamic effects of diuretics, betablockers and the association of both, 24 hypertensive patients, stages I-II WHO criteria, were studied. Two haemodynamic studies were performed, before under placebo and after two month of active drug therapy. Seven patients received propranolol (PPL) (160-240 mg/day); 7 patients, hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) (150-100 mg/day), and 10 a combined fixed dose of pindolol (PDL) and clopamide (CLP): PDL 10 mg, CLP 5 mg per tablet, each patient receiving one to three tablets according blood pressure response. The haemodynamic study was performed with percutaneous intravenous flow-directed. Swan-Ganz catheter, associated with direct puncture of femoral artery and measuring cardiac output by thermodilution. Arterial pressure was significantly reduced on PPL (p less than 0.05) and PDL-CLP (p less than 0.01) groups, but not in the HCT group. The cardiac index was reduced by PPL (p less than 0.05) but not by HCT and PDL-CLP. The systemic vascular resistance was only reduced in the PDL-CLP group (p less than 0.05). The use of a betablocker with intrinsic sympathetic activity (ISA) (pindolol) in association with a thiazide diuretic (clopamide) seems to induce a favourable change in systemic resistance without a deleterious change in cardiac output as occurred with propranolol.", 
    "47": "Sixty-two patients with angina of effort and different circulation types were investigated to assess the pattern of changes in hemodynamics and gas exchange following an acute obsidan test and a course of obsidan treatment. A relationship was demonstrated between the effect of obsidan on central hemodynamics and gas exchange, on the one hand, and the baseline circulatory type, on the other. In patients with hyper- and eukinetic circulation, the drug increased the maximum oxygen uptake and total performance volume in the presence of a variety of hemodynamic changes; such as the negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in the hyperkinetic-type patients, and the negative chronotropic effect in the eukinetic-type ones. In hypokinetic-type patients, the drug had no effect on hemodynamics. The lack of changes in physical working capacity parameters was due to a shift in the conditions of stress exposure towards anaerobic metabolism. A correlation was demonstrated between changes in some hemodynamic and gas exchange parameters following both a single dose and a treatment course of obsidan.", 
    "48": "Experiments were designed to study the effects of catecholamines on oxytocin responses and milk removal in dairy cows. Adrenalin, noradrenalin, dopamine, isoproterenol (a beta-adrenoceptor agonist), phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic blocker) and propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker) were infused intravenously. In addition, adrenalin was infused together with phentolamine and/or propranolol. Infusions started 8 min before milking and lasted until the end of milking. In some cases electroshocks (for 5 s) were applied immediately before milking in the absence and presence of phentolamine and propranolol. Adrenalin, noradrenalin and dopamine reduced milk removal, but only if administered in supraphysiological amounts. The effect of adrenalin and electroshocks on milk removal could be inhibited only partly by phentolamine. Inhibition of milk removal was not mediated by reduced oxytocin responses. Enhanced local release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerves was presumably responsible for lowered milk removal in response to electroshocks. Milk removal was facilitated during alpha-adrenergic blockade and during beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "49": "In 539 patients 5 years after myocardial infarction (MI), quality of life and factors influencing life quality were studied. All patients originally participated in an early intervention trial with metoprolol. A cardiac follow-up questionnaire and the Nottingham Health Profile were answered by 82%. In the former, information about subjective symptoms, smoking, work and current medication was obtained; the latter described health-related quality of life in terms of energy, sleep, emotions, mobility, pain and social isolation. The rate of and the reasons for rehospitalization were registered in the patients' records. The MI patients reported a comparatively high quality of life. Compared with 'normal' population, a decrease was noted in energy, sleep and mobility, and in sex life, hobby-activity and holiday activity. A nonparametric multivariate analysis disclosed that dyspnoea, angina pectoris and anxiety were closely associated with decreased quality of life. In conclusion, 5 years after MI most patients seemed well-adjusted. Impaired quality of life was reported by patients suffering from angina pectoris, dyspnoea and emotional distress. No relationship was found between health-related quality of life and the beta blocker, metoprolol, which was the most frequently used drug.", 
    "50": "Effect of basic paced cycle length on sinus node effective refractory period was studied in 22 patients with sick sinus syndrome. Sinus node effective refractory period was measured using three different paced cycle lengths before and after pharmacologic autonomic blockade. Sinus node effective refractory period could be measured at one cycle length, at least, in 59% of the patients before blockade, however, it could be measured at two or more cycle lengths in only 18% of patients because of the chaotic response of sinus node against premature stimuli. It could be measured after pharmacologic autonomic blockade in 68% of the patients at two or more paced cycle lengths. On the other hand, the rest of the patients showed no measurable sinus node effective refractory period at any cycle length, for their sinus node effective refractory periods were shorter than their right atrial effective refractory periods. The comparison of sinus node effective refractory period at different paced cycle lengths was unsuccessful before pharmacologic autonomic blockade, while the refractory period was significantly prolonged as cycle length was shortened after blockade. We concluded that (1) sinus node effective refractory period in humans is prolonged as paced cycle length decreases, (2) the autonomic reflex is the major disturbing factor in measuring sinus node effective refractory period, and pharmacologic autonomic blockade can be usefully employed to eliminate a chaotic sinus nodal response, (3) when sinus node effective refractory period is shorter than right atrial effective refractory period, a shorter paced cycle length should be used for definite measurement of the former.", 
    "51": "The relationship between debrisoquine oxidation phenotype and the stereoselective metabolism of metoprolol was investigated in populations of British Caucasians (n = 139) and Nigerian subjects (n = 117). The 0-8 h urinary S/R-metoprolol (S/R-M) ratio was related to the ability to metabolise metoprolol and debrisoquine in both ethnic groups. The median S/R-M ratio was significantly higher in Caucasians (1.27) than in Nigerians (1.10). In the Caucasian population poor metabolisers of debrisoquine had significantly lower S/R-M ratio (median = 0.84) than extensive metabolisers (median = 1.28). Bimodality in the frequency distribution of the S/R-M ratio was not apparent in either ethnic group.", 
    "52": "1. The effects of steady state flosequinan, a new vasodilator, and propranolol, on glucose mobilisation, lipolysis and plasma potassium concentration during sub-maximal exercise testing were investigated in a double-blind, randomised, three-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. 2. Plasma glucose, potassium and free fatty acid concentration during and after exercise on flosequinan were similar to those on placebo. Exercise heart rates were 7% (+9.2 beats min-1) higher on flosequinan compared with placebo (P less than 0.05). During exercise on propranolol plasma glucose concentrations were comparable with those on placebo but plasma potassium concentrations were higher (mean increase 0.26 mmol l-1, P less than 0.01) whereas free fatty acid concentrations were lower (mean decrease 0.10 mmol 1-1, P less than 0.01). As expected the heart rate on exercise was 25% less (-35 beats min-1) on propranolol (P less than 0.05). 3. These data suggest that, in contrast to propranolol, flosequinan does not adversely affect the mobilisation of the two major sources of energy during sub-maximal exercise.", 
    "53": "1. The kinetics and dynamics of long acting propranolol 80 mg and 160 mg were examined after single oral doses to 12 healthy volunteers. 2. Long acting propranolol 160 mg produced a twofold increase in mean peak blood propranolol concentration and AUC compared with the lower dose. There was no difference in elimination half-life, bioavailability and mean residence time of propranolol between the two doses. 3. Resting pulse rate was decreased by long acting propranolol 160 mg but not by the lower dose. 4. Both preparations blocked exercise induced tachycardia during the entire observation period of 29 h. Percentage inhibition of exercise tachycardia was significant at all time points but long acting propranolol 160 mg exhibited a greater reduction at 24 h and 29 h. 5. Increase in systolic blood pressure during exercise was inhibited by both preparations during the entire observation period with no differences between them. 6. The doubling of the dose administered was reflected in blood concentrations but not in pharmacodynamic parameters. Few pharmacodynamic differences were found between the two doses.", 
    "54": "The cardiovascular actions of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of neuropeptide Y (NPY) were examined in conscious, unrestrained rats. A prolonged decrease in heart rate (HR) and a fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were obtained following i.c.v. administration of NPY (1 and 10 micrograms). Passive immunization with an antiserum directed against NPY confirmed that the slowing of HR following i.c.v. administration of NPY was mediated via a central nervous mechanism and not from leakage of NPY out of the brain. Administration of NPY into different brain parenchymal regions identified a putative site of action in the rostral region of the solitary tract. The mechanism of the decrease in HR caused by centrally administered NPY was investigated by i.c.v. administration of NPY to animals that were pretreated with agents that altered autonomic tone. Administration of NPY to atropine-treated animals produced a reversal of the atropine-induced tachycardia, suggesting that the NPY-induced decrease in HR was not due to augmented vagal tone. However, administration of NPY to animals pretreated with propranolol did not significantly lower HR below that obtained with propranolol alone. These data suggest that i.c.v. administration of NPY may cause a decrease in cardiac sympathetic outflow. The effects of centrally administered NPY on baroreflex function were studied. The changes in HR caused by NPY did not significantly alter baroreflex set-point or gain. These studies provide evidence that NPY acted within a brainstem region to decrease sympathetic nervous outflow, resulting in a decrease in HR and MAP.", 
    "55": "1. Incubations of racemic propranolol alone or in the presence of either quinidine or sparteine were performed with Cunninghamella bainieri. 2. Five mammalian metabolites of propranolol (4-hydroxypropranolol, desisopropyl-propranolol, 1-naphthoxylactic acid, propranolol glycol and 1-naphthoxyacetic acid) were present in unhydrolysed extracts of the incubation medium according to h.p.l.c. and g.l.c. analyses. The relative proportion of 4-hydroxypropranolol increased after enzymic treatment. 3. Propranolol not only had a fungistatic effect, but also caused morphological changes in the organism, which were accompanied by decomposition of 4-hydroxypropranolol and formation of a greenish-brown colour in the incubation medium. 4. Drug interaction experiments yielded results which paralleled those reported in mammals. 5. The findings indicate that C. bainieri may be a useful microbial model for drug disposition and interaction studies.", 
    "56": "A novel oral multiple-unit dosage form which overcame many of the problems commonly observed during the compression of microparticles into tablets was developed in this study. Micro- or nanoparticles were entrapped in beads formed by ionotropic gelation of the charged polysaccharide, chitosan or sodium alginate, in solutions of the counterion, tripolyphosphate (TPP) or calcium chloride (CaCl2), respectively. The described technique did not change the physical properties of the microparticles, and it allowed a high microparticle loading (up to 98%). The ionic character of the polymers allowed pH-dependent release of the microparticles. Chitosan beads disintegrated and released the microparticles in 0.1 N HCl, while calcium alginate beads stayed intact in 0.1 N HCl but rapidly disintegrated in simulated intestinal fluids. Coating the calcium alginate beads with cellulose acetate phthalate resulted in an enteric drug delivery system. Scanning electron microscopy and dissolution and disintegration tests were used to characterize the microparticle-containing beads. The disintegration time of the beads was studied as a function of the solution viscosity of the polysaccharide, gelation time, counterion concentration, and method of drying.", 
    "57": "Accelerometric tremorgrams were recorded from 25 subjects affected by essential tremor and analysed by a Berg-Fourier frequency analyser before and during venous infusion of the following drugs: propranolol (beta-blocker), clonidine (alpha-presynaptic adrenergic agonist), urapidil (alpha-postsynaptic blocker), trazodone (adrenolytic agent) and placebo. The washout interval between infusions was 3 days. Recordings and data analyses were performed in a double-blind crossover trial. Tremor was classified as: at rest; postural (arms hyperextended); and intention (finger-nose test). Analysis of the results showed that propranolol and clonidine reduced significantly (P = 0.01 and P = 0.009, respectively) the power spectrum of postural tremor, but left at rest and intention tremors unchanged. No significant effects on the tremor power spectrum were observed after placebo, urapidil or trazodone administration. None of the drugs had any effect on tremor frequency.", 
    "58": "The aim of this study was to determine the possible effect of propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, on maximal electroshock seizures (MES) in mice. It was found that doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg propranolol caused an increase in the convulsion threshold of maximal electroshock seizures (MES) proportional to the dose and, that the mode of the anticonvulsant action of propranolol used doses in this study is related to membrane stabilization.", 
    "59": "Since platelets may modulate endothelial cell permeability, we examined the effects of platelets on 125I-albumin permeability of cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell monolayers. The experimental system consisted of endothelial cells grown to confluence on a gelatinized polycarbonate filter. We quantified the diffusive flux of 125I-albumin from luminal chamber to the abluminal chamber. Washed human platelets added to the monolayers decreased the albumin flux in a concentration-dependent manner, with a 65% decrease occurring at the highest concentration of platelets (5 x 10(7) platelets) added to the 700-microliters luminal chamber. In contrast, neither paraformaldehyde-fixed platelets nor fresh red blood cells changed 125I-albumin permeability. Platelets had no effect on 125I-albumin permeability across the gelatinized filters without endothelial cells present. Supernatants of platelet lysates also reduced albumin flux. The effect produced by intact platelets or platelet lysate was not influenced by the presence of ketanserin (a serotonin receptor antagonist), propranolol (a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist), or aspirin (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase). Platelets activated by thrombin did not produce an effect that was different from the effect produced by intact platelets. The activity of the supernatant of platelet lysate remained in the aqueous phase after ether extraction. The results indicate that the platelet-mediated decrease in endothelial cell permeability to 125I-albumin is the result of a hydrophilic platelet-derived factor(s) and not secondary to mechanical obstruction of endothelial \"leaks\" by the platelets.", 
    "60": "Renal function, plasma norepinephrine, renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone were determined in 17 cirrhotics with ascites, before and after effective beta-blockade (resting heart rate reduction greater than or equal to 20%) induced by oral propranolol. The drug lowered PRA (from 2.86 +/- 0.96 (S.E.) to 1.86 +/- 0.7 ng/ml/h; P less than 0.005) and plasma aldosterone (from 309.0 +/- 59.2 to 202.6 +/- 26.7 pg/ml; P less than 0.005). As expected, plasma norepinephrine (PNC) increased from 90.7 +/- 12.2 to 176.8 +/- 43 ng/l (P less than 0.01) in the 10 patients with normal basal values ('normal-PNC' group), but it decreased in 6 of the 7 patients with basal sympathoadrenergic hypertone ('high-PNC' group; mean value from 352.6 +/- 37.8 to 273 +/- 39.3 ng/ml (P = 0.06). Glomerular filtration rate and filtered sodium load did not change in the group as a whole and in 'normal-PNC' cirrhotics (from 83.2 +/- 7.1 to 81.4 +/- 7.8 ml/min, and from 11.63 +/- 0.96 to 11.45 +/- 1.14 mmol/min), but rose in 'high-PNC' patients (from 60.7 +/- 9.1 to 109.3 +/- 27.2 ml/min, and from 8.39 +/- 1.31 to 15.47 +/- 3.95 mmol/min; P less than 0.05). Renal sodium excretion increased from 2.45 +/- 0.75 to 3.16 +/- 1.01 mmol/h (P less than 0.01) in the group as a whole. Such an increase, however, was confined to 'high-PNC' cirrhotics. In this group, the tubular rejection fraction did not change and post-beta-blockade sodium excretion was correlated with the filtered sodium load (Rs = 0.83; P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "The thyroid gland is richly innervated but the effects of activation of these nerves on thyroid hormone secretion are not yet established. In the present study, intravenous injection to mice of 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG; 60 mumol/animal) was used to activate the autonomic nerves. The nerve activation occurs through the neuroglycopenia. We found that 2-DG inhibited the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; 70 microU/animal)-induced thyroid hormone secretion, measured as release of radioiodine bound to anti-T4 in radioiodine-pretreated mice. This inhibition by 2-DG was completely reversed by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine but not affected by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist L-propranolol or the muscarinic receptor antagonist methyl-atropine. It is therefore concluded that neuroglycopenia-induced activation of the autonomic nerves inhibits TSH-induced thyroid hormone secretion by a mechanism that is reversed by phentolamine. It is suggested that it is mainly the adrenergic nerves that are involved in this action, and, consequently, that the function of the adrenergic nerves in thyroid physiology is to restrain the stimulatory action of TSH.", 
    "62": "The role of the sympathetic nervous system in free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization was assessed in this study. FFA turnover rate using 1-14C-palmitic acid and metabolic rate by using indirect calorimetry were measured in ten white and 12 Pima Indian males after an overnight fast and during propranolol infusion (120 micrograms/kg fat-free mass [FFM] bolus and 1.2 micrograms/kg FFM/min). Baseline FFA turnovers were similar in both racial groups and decreased similarly following propranolol infusion (-16% +/- 4%; P less than .001, n = 22). This decrease was greater in more obese subjects (decrease in FFA turnover v % body fat, r = -.59, P less than .01, n = 22). Propranolol also induced an increase in lipid oxidation, which was more marked in the subjects with a high ratio of abdomen to thigh circumference (A/T ratio) (r = .63, P less than .01, n = 22). On average the resting metabolic rate (RMR) was unchanged during propranolol infusion, but individuals with lower A/T ratio had greater decreases in RMR than subjects with higher A/T ratio (r = .48, P less than .05). Assuming that the change in FFA turnover following beta-blockade is proportional to the role that the catecholamines (and therefore the sympathetic nervous system) play in mobilization of FFA, the greater fall in FFA turnover after propranolol infusion in more obese subjects suggests that they have a higher basal sympathetic activity. Furthermore, the lack of decrease in metabolic rate in response to beta-blockade in persons with a high A/T ratio could be the reflection of an even greater SNS activity in individuals with central obesity.", 
    "63": "Atenolol has been shown to be stored and secreted from PC12 cells by calcium-dependent and stereoselective mechanisms. The present study was designed to determine if the cytoplasmic amine storage granule was the site for storage and release of atenolol and if the drug was, in fact, an enantiomeric selective substrate for the vesicular amine transport protein. Uptake of racemic [3H]atenolol and (-)-[3H]norepinephrine was studied in a vesicular preparation of storage granules isolated from PC12 cells. Uptake of both molecules was found to be ATP-dependent (80%) and to reach steady state in approximately 10 to 15 min. Uptake and storage was inhibited (95%) by either reserpine, an inhibitor of the vesicular amine carrier, or by nigericin which dissipates the proton gradient across the membrane. Uptake of neither compound was inhibited by desipramine, an inhibitor of uptake 1, or oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase. Furthermore, uptake of the (-)-enantiomer of atenolol was found to be approximately 5-fold greater than the (+)-enantiomer. Kinetic studies revealed a Km of 184 microM for (+/-)-atenolol and 79 microM for (-)-norepinephrine and Vmax values of 750 and 503 pmol/min/mg of protein for atenolol and norepinephrine, respectively. The interaction of the two compounds with the transport process was found to be kinetically competitive. In separate experiments, atenolol was also found to be transported stereoselectively into bovine adrenal chromaffin granule ghosts and to be ATP dependent (85%) and reserpine sensitive (44%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "Experiments were conducted in the isolated perfused rat kidney to determine the mechanism of unsurmountable antagonism by metergoline toward the vasoconstrictor response to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Three possible mechanisms were investigated: 1) multiple receptors for 5-HT; 2) pseudoirreversible inhibition; and 3) allosteric modulation of 5-HT receptors. Metergoline and six other 5-HT antagonists acted as potent unsurmountable antagonists, only (-)-propranolol acted competitively (pA2 = 6.5). Multiple receptors for 5-HT were ruled out as the mechanism of unsurmountable antagonism because 5-HT and four 5-HT analogs gave similar pA2 values with (-)-propranolol. In addition, the KA value for 5-HT (185 nM) and the order and relativity of agonist potency suggest the presence of a single 5-HT2 receptor. Pseudoirreversible inhibition, over allosteric modulation of the 5-HT2 receptor, is suggested from experiments in which reversal of metergoline-induced inhibition by (-)-propranolol (studied in the presence of metergoline) was matched, in magnitude, by wash-out of metergoline. (-)-Propranolol is suggested to mimic wash-out by occupying and protecting receptors from which metergoline has dissociated. This is accomplished by virtue of its faster kinetics, on-off the 5-HT receptor, allowing restoration of 5-HT responses via a competitive interaction. Pseudoirreversible antagonism, over allosteric receptor modulation, offers an explanation that does not involve the postulation of allosteric effector sites or changes in the state of the 5-HT2 receptor.", 
    "65": "Propafenone, a class IC antiarrhythmic agent, is metabolized into two active metabolites: 5-hydroxypropafenone (5-OHP) and N-depropylpropafenone (NDPP). In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we examined trough plasma concentrations of propafenone and its two metabolites in 169 subjects. Patients were randomized to one of five parallel treatment groups: placebo and 337.5, 450, 675, or 900 mg/day propafenone with 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitorings, 12-lead ECGs, and plasma samples obtained at frequent intervals. Nonlinear kinetics were noted for propafenone and NDPP but not for 5-OHP. The ratio of NDPP to propafenone was about 10% at all doses, but the ratio of 5-OHP to propafenone decreased from 33% at 337.5 mg/day to 18% at 900 mg/day. Propafenone suppression of ventricular ectopy was dependent on concentration, with pairs and VT beats selectively suppressed at lower concentrations than VPBs. The PR interval and QRS duration increased significantly at propafenone concentrations above 100 ng/ml, while minimal heart rate slowing was noted at concentrations above 1,000 ng/ml.", 
    "66": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial of atenolol compared with placebo in the outpatient management of patients with the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In addition to receiving customary therapy, 88 patients were randomly assigned to receive atenolol and 92 to receive placebo. Outcome during the next 14 days was assessed using two main measures: the patient's clinical course as assessed by an alcohol withdrawal severity index; and the occurrence of treatment failure (composite measure including return to drinking, dropouts, and withdrawal lasting longer than 5 days). In addition, levels of craving for alcohol were assessed as an associated response variable. Overall, treatment failure occurred for 37% of the patients receiving atenolol and 52% of those receiving placebo. Among patients who had withdrawal symptoms at baseline, vital signs became normal more rapidly in the patients receiving atenolol, and their abnormal behavioral characteristics also resolved more rapidly. Levels of craving for alcohol were strongly associated with treatment failure; the group of patients who received atenolol included significantly fewer who reported high levels of craving 24 hours after treatment began (7% of patients receiving atenolol and 20% of those receiving placebo). We conclude that the outpatient management and treatment outcomes of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are improved in patients who receive atenolol, and that the beneficial effects are associated with reduced levels of craving for alcohol. If these results are confirmed by other investigators, atenolol may prove to play an important role in the outpatient management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "67": "The feasibility of using labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent, as a hypotensive agent in combination with inhalation anaesthetics (halothane, enflurane or isoflurane) was studied in 23 adult patients undergoing middle-ear surgery. The mean arterial pressure was decreased from 86 +/- 5 (s.e. mean) mmHg to 52 +/- 1 mmHg (11.5 +/- 0.7 to 6.9 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 98 +/- 10 min in the halothane (H) group, from 79 +/- 5 to 53 +/- 1 mmHg (10.5 +/- 0.7 to 7.1 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 129 +/- 11 min in the enflurane (E) group, and from 80 +/- 4 to 49 +/- 1 mmHg (10.7 +/- 0.5 to 6.5 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 135 +/- 15 min in the isoflurane (I) group. The mean H concentration during hypotension in the inspiratory gas was 0.7 +/- 0.1 vol%, the mean E concentration 1.6 +/- 0.2 vol%, and the mean I concentration 1.0 +/- 0.1 vol%. In addition, the patients received fentanyl and d-tubocurarine. The initial dose of labetalol for lowering blood pressure was similar, 0.52-0.59 mg/kg, in all the groups. During hypotension, the heart rate was stable without tachy- or bradycardia. The operating conditions regarding bleeding were estimated in a double-blind manner, and did not differ significantly between the groups. During hypotension, the serum creatinine concentration rose significantly in all groups from the values before hypotension and returned postoperatively to the initial level in the other groups, except the isoflurane group. After hypotension there was no rebound phenomenon in either blood pressure or heart rate. These results indicate that labetalol induces easily adjustable hypotension without compensatory tachycardia and rebound hypertension.", 
    "68": "The influence of cold on the threshold for myocardial ischemia and the efficacy of antianginal drugs in a cold environment were assessed in 24 patients with stable angina and exercise-induced ST depression. Treadmill exercise tests were done according to a randomized double-blind protocol 90 minutes after administration of placebo, 80 mg propranolol, or 120 mg diltiazem, each at both -8 degrees and 20 degrees C. Eight of the patients were classified by history as cold-sensitive before the study. For the entire group, none of the exercise end points differed significantly between cold and normal temperatures with placebo. However, cold-sensitive patients developed 1 mm ST depression 30% sooner (169 +/- 41 versus 244 +/- 38 seconds, p less than 0.01) at -8 degrees C compared with 20 degrees C. At the onset of ischemia, rate-pressure product was lower in the cold (19.8 +/- 1.0 versus 22.0 +/- 1.6 x 10(-3), p less than 0.05). Both propranolol and diltiazem prolonged time to onset of 1 mm ST depression at both temperatures. The magnitude of improvement at -8 degrees C was equal to that at 20 degrees C, and differences between the two drugs were not statistically significant. Only diltiazem prolonged total exercise duration. Thus, as assessed by exercise testing, cold does not worsen ischemic threshold in most stable angina patients. However, in a subgroup identifiable by history, ischemic threshold is lower in the cold. Propranolol and diltiazem are as effective for exercise-induced ischemia in a cold environment as at normal temperatures.",

    "70": "Neuropeptide Y is stored in sympathetic nerve terminals throughout the heart and has direct and indirect effects on cardiac function. Although neuropeptide Y has been shown to be released upon intense (16-30 Hz) cardiac sympathetic stimulation, we sought to determine whether effective quantities of neuropeptide Y were released from cardiac sympathetic neurons under more natural conditions. We recorded arterial pressure and cardiac cycle length in 29 anesthetized dogs. We assessed neuropeptide Y release by measuring the attenuation of vagally induced increases in cardiac cycle length (10 seconds every 2 minutes) after trains of sympathetic stimulation. We examined the effect of constant-frequency sympathetic stimulation (frequencies of 2, 5, 10, and 15 Hz, applied for train durations of 1, 3, and 5 minutes) on vagally induced chronotropic responses. We also determined the effect of varying the pattern of sympathetic stimulation. Both the magnitude and duration of the inhibition of the vagal effects on cardiac cycle length were augmented significantly by increases in the frequency or duration of sympathetic stimulation. In contrast, the inhibition of the vagally induced chronotropic responses was not significantly affected by changes in the pattern of sympathetic stimulation. We also characterized the role of adrenergic receptors. Phentolamine significantly increased the sympathetically mediated inhibition of the vagal effects on cardiac cycle length, but propranolol had no effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "A corollary of the \"cardiomyopathy therapy\" implies that mitral valve prolapse may cause intrinsic myocardial depression. The impairment of ventricular function may not be detected in basal conditions, but could be unmasked by superimposing depressant factors. The use of beta-blockers constitutes the first choice treatment for the symptomatic management of patients with mitral valve prolapse. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that myocardial depression could be shown during beta-blockade in the uncomplicated primary form of mitral valve prolapse. The results of echocardiographic and radionuclide angiographic evaluation of left ventricular function during basal conditions, as well as under beta-blockade with propranolol and pindolol, do not lend support to the cardiomyopathy hypothesis of the pathogenesis of primary mitral valve prolapse. However, significant decreases of heart rate, left ventricular ejection fraction and peak velocity of left ventricular systolic emptying were seen with propranolol, but not with pindolol. Beta-blockade with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may be preferable therapeutic option for patients with mitral valve prolapse.", 
    "72": "Felodipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist which selectively relaxes vascular smooth muscle. It lovers dose-dependently blood pressure in hypertensives patients. In this multicentre double-blind study, 113 patients (mean age 50 +/- 14 years) whose diastolic blood pressure was higher than 95 mmHg after withdrawal of an eventual antihypertensive therapy and a week of placebo administration. The patients received randomly either felodipine (5 mg x 2/j during two weeks and then 10 mg x 2/day) either atenolol (100 mg/day) during two months. Antihypertensive effects of these two drug regimens were not significantly different. Supine blood pressure decreased from 177 +/- 22/107 +/- 8 mmHg to 152 +/- 27/91 +/- 13 mmHg with felodipine and from 176 +/- 19/107 +/- 8 to 152 +/- 24/91 +/- 12 with atenolol. Side effects recorded by means of active questioning were ankle oedemas and headache with felodipine and fatigue and headache with atenolol.", 
    "73": "The hypothesis that facilitation of noradrenaline release by prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors is linked to the local generation of angiotensin II was investigated in rat tail artery and mouse atria which were incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline. The outflow of radioactivity induced by electrical field stimulation of the tissues was taken as an index of noradrenaline release. In mouse atria, angiotensin II (0.01 microM) enhanced the stimulation-induced (S-I) noradrenaline release and this was blocked by saralasin (0.1 microM). Isoprenaline (0.01 microM) also enhanced the S-I release of noradrenaline, but this was not blocked by either saralasin (0.1 microM and 0.3 microM) or captopril (5 microM). Furthermore, the facilitatory effects of angiotensin II (0.1 microM) and isoprenaline (0.1 microM) were additive. In rat tail artery, the facilitatory effect of angiotensin II (0.01 microM) on noradrenaline release was blocked by saralasin (0.1 microM). The facilitatory effect of isoprenaline (0.1 microM) was blocked by propranolol (1 microM) but not by saralasin (0.1 microM) nor captopril (5 microM). These results indicate that beta-adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation of noradrenaline release occurs independently of angiotensin II in mouse atria and rat tail artery.", 
    "74": "We have found self-determination of blood pressure to be a valuable technique in the evaluation and management of our patients. It is sensitive and the patients can detect minor changes in their blood pressures. The method has yielded reproducible results, with identical readings being obtained 6 weeks apart. Recently, we extended the application of self-determination to a larger group of young adults (n = 534) representing a wide range of employment and educational backgrounds. The average time spent teaching them was 20 min. A reading within 5 mmHg of the observer's was achieved in three to 10 attempts (mean 3.7 +/- 1.1) and there was a good correlation between the observer and the subject for both systolic (r = 0.988) and diastolic (r = 0.976) pressures. The average home blood pressure was 120.7 +/- 9.1/75.7 +/- 7 mmHg for men and 111.6 +/- 11/70.1 +/- 8 mmHg for women. We conclude that blood pressure self-determination is sensitive, reproducible and easy to learn.", 
    "75": "From two large scale studies in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction we report the outcome in diabetics after treatment with either metoprolol or placebo. In the G\u00f6teborg Metoprolol Trial mortality at 3 months was reduced by metoprolol from 17.9% to 7.5% and late infarction was reduced from 16.4% to 3.8%. In the MIAMI Trial, mortality was decreased by metoprolol from 11.3% to 5.7% and the occurrence of late infarction was decreased from 4.5% to 3.1% during 15-day follow-up. Compared with the overall results, the effect of metoprolol on mortality appears particularly impressive in diabetics.", 
    "76": "1. We evaluated the relative efficacies and tolerability of various low-dose combinations of nicardipine and propranolol in patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension (DBP Phase V of greater than 90-125 mmHg; WHO Grades I and II) in order to select the best one. 2. Sixty patients completed the double-blind, balanced, randomised three-way cross-over protocol, with each phase lasting 4 weeks, and in which twice daily nicardipine 40 mg or propranolol 80 mg was compared with four twice daily combinations of nicardipine (20 or 30 mg) plus propranolol (40 or 80 mg). 3. At 'peak' effect time (i.e., 2 h post-dosing) all four treatment combinations were significantly more effective than propranolol, with effects ranging from 9-23 mmHg (systolic) and 5-15 mmHg (diastolic). Only the two 30 mg nicardipine combinations with propranolol were more effective than nicardipine monotherapy, further reducing BP by 8-13 mmHg (systolic) and 5-7 mmHg (diastolic); there were no significant differences between them. 4. 'Trough' diastolic pressures were not different between treatments and 'trough' BP control was sub-optimal on all treatments. 5. 70% of patients on nicardipine monotherapy, 33% of those on propranolol monotherapy and 30% of patients during the placebo run-in complained of symptoms. In terms of complaint rates, there was little to choose between the four combinations (27-33%). Serum potassium and creatinine levels were elevated following propranolol monotherapy by 0.19 mmol 1-1 and 6.5 mumol 1-1 respectively (P less than 0.01 for both) and following the nicardipine 30 mg/propranolol 80 mg combination. Nicardipine monotherapy elevated serum T4 levels by an average of 0.57 ng dl-1 (P less than 0.05). 6. The twice daily combination of nicardipine 30 mg plus propranolol 40 mg was therefore the optimum one in terms of its efficacy and tolerability. Further studies need to be performed to test the hypothesis that a higher dose of propranolol might ameliorate troublesome vasodilator side effects. However, none of the treatments studied was ideal for clinical use in the twice daily dosage used in this study.", 
    "77": "In a 4-year, double-masked, parallel, multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of levobunolol and timolol, 391 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomly assigned to receive masked 0.5% or 1% levobunolol, or 0.5% timolol, twice daily. Mean decreases in intraocular pressure (IOP) over 4 years of therapy were 7.1, 7.2, and 7.0 mmHg for 0.5% levobunolol, 1% levobunolol, or 0.5% timolol, respectively. Little attenuation of ocular hypotensive efficacy occurred. The 4-year efficacy failure rate for the three groups, which did not differ from each other, was approximately 30%. Adverse experiences requiring cessation of therapy occurred in an additional 10% of patients. The vast majority of efficacy failures (79/95) and of adverse events (33/37) requiring removal from the study occurred during the first 2 years. Overall mean decreases in heart rate for the 4 years ranged from 3 to 6 beats per minute for all treatment groups; overall mean decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure ranged between 1 and 2 mmHg. The authors concluded that levobunolol is relatively effective and relatively safe for the long-term (4-year) treatment of elevated IOP.", 
    "78": "Since labetalol was first reviewed in the Journal (1978), its scope of therapeutic use has expanded and become better defined. Labetalol is an adrenoceptor blocking drug with combined alpha- and beta-blocking properties. These result in a more favourable haemodynamic profile for labetalol compared with 'pure' beta-blockers or pure alpha-blockers, but also contribute to a wider range, but not an overall increased incidence, of adverse effects. The drug is effective and well-tolerated in patients with all grades of hypertension, but is of particular value in special subgroups such as Black patients, the elderly and patients with renal hypertension. While comparative studies are not extensive, available data show that the drug reduces blood pressure to a similar extent, and in a similar proportion of patients, as 'pure' beta-blockers such as propranolol, pure alpha-blockers such as prazosin, calcium antagonists (nifedipine, verapamil), and centrally acting drugs (clonidine and methyldopa). Labetalol is very effective in hypertensive pregnant women and in hypertensive crises, where it provides good control of blood pressure without serious adverse effects, and where few therapeutic options exist. Few controlled studies have investigated the use of labetalol in deliberate induction of hypotension or prevention of hypertension during anaesthesia, and also in patients with ischaemic heart disease. However, available evidence suggests a role for labetalol in these indications and further studies should aid in clarification of its efficacy in these areas. Thus, with its broad scope of therapeutic use in hypertension labetalol remains an important therapeutic option, and the drug may well find an additional place in the treatment of myocardial ischaemia if further evidence confirms encouraging preliminary findings.",

Patients received either atenolol 5 mg intravenously or matching placebo within 3 h of the completion of surgery. A second intravenous dose was administered 24 h following the first and then atenolol 50 mg orally or matching placebo was given for six days. Continuous Holter monitor recordings were obtained for the 24 h immediately preoperatively and continuously for eight days postoperatively. No patient received any antiarrhythmic drug preoperatively. Patients who required pharmacological intervention for the management of postoperative arrhythmias were withdrawn as treatment failures. Holter monitor analysis continued for 24 h following withdrawal of a treatment failure. All patients were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Both groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, severity of coronary artery disease, left ventricular ejection fraction, preoperative use of beta-blockers, bypass time, aortic cross-clamp time, number of grafts per patient and frequency of preoperative arrhythmias. Arrhythmia analysis was done manually. Supraventricular arrhythmias (atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter) were classified as either mild (less than 0.5 mins, less than 140 beats/min), moderate (0.5 to 30 mins, 140 to 180 beats/min), or severe (longer than 30 mins, more than 180 beats/min).

    "80": "Recent randomized clinical trials have shown that total mortality and cardiovascular mortality are reduced by the early intravenous administration of beta-blockers to patients suspected of suffering from acute myocardial infarction. These trials were conducted on patients meeting strict entry criteria. In order to assess this therapy when applied to a broader range of myocardial infarction patients, we performed a Phase IV study of metoprolol in acute myocardial infarction. The study was designed to test whether early (less than 8 hours from onset of chest pain) intervention by practicing physicians with open label intravenous metoprolol for cases of suspected acute myocardial infarction achieved mortality results similar to those obtained in large randomized clinical trials. We studied 3824 patients treated by 741 physicians representing a broad spectrum of clinical practice in the United States. Seventy-two percent of the patients entered into the study had confirmed myocardial infarction (39% anterior, 39% inferior, 22% other locations) and 85% of all individuals treated tolerated the full intravenous dose of 15 mg of metoprolol. The 15 day total mortality and cardiovascular mortality rates were 4.9% and 4.5%; 90 day mortality rates were 6.9 and 5.9%. Patients with anterior infarctions had a significantly greater cumulative mortality rate than patients with other types of infarctions. Marked bradycardia (heart rate less than 45 beats per minute) in the first 8 hours post treatment occurred in 4.7% cases and hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) occurred in 9.8% of cases. When compared with the results of the G\u00f6teborg and MIAMI trials of metoprolol, it appears that there is no appreciable increase in mortality or morbidity when metoprolol is used in the community practice of acute coronary care.", 
    "81": "Calcium channel blockers are important drugs for the treatment of chronic stable angina. However, negative inotropic and dromotropic effects may limit their usefulness in patients with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities or left ventricular dysfunction. A new generation of calcium channel blockers will soon be available that have a more vascular selective action than currently available agents. Of the new agents, nicardipine has been most extensively studied. In experimental studies, nicardipine is more specific for vascular smooth muscle than for cardiac smooth muscle and for coronary than peripheral vasculature. In controlled trials, nicardipine exhibited efficacy and safety that was comparable to older calcium blockers or beta blockers. However, nicardipine was associated with minimal negative inotropic or dromotropic effects even in patients with existing left ventricular dysfunction. Thus, nicardipine may have an advantage over existing calcium channel blockers, especially in patients with underlying cardiac disease.", 
    "82": "The effect of ethyl alcohol on the antiarrhythmic action of atenolol in the adrenaline-induced arrhythmia model was studied in rats non-dependent and dependent on ethanol. Atenolol administered jointly with ethanol, in a single dose or repeatedly produced a weaker antiarrhythmic effect than when it was given alone. Moreover, a rise in animal mortality was observed, in particular after atenolol administration in the period of intoxication. No significant effect of atenolol on ethanol blood concentration was found.", 
    "83": "To clarify the mechanism of irreversible myocardial damage, we studied the relationship between ischaemic mitochondrial dysfunction and leakage of lysosomal enzymes, and the effects of propranolol on myocardial damage. Open chest anaesthetised dogs were divided into six groups: 30 min occlusion of the left anterior coronary artery (LAD); 2 h LAD occlusion; 2 h LAD occlusion after premedication with 0.3 mg.kg-1 propranolol; 30 min LAD occlusion/l h reperfusion; 2 h LAD occlusion/l h reperfusion; and 2 h LAD occlusion/l h reperfusion after propranolol premedication. After occlusion or reperfusion, heart mitochondria were prepared from normal and occluded or reperfused areas, and mitochondrial function (rate of oxygen consumption in State III, and respiratory control index) was measured polarographically. Myocardial tissue was fractionated and activities of lysosomal enzymes (N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and beta-glucuronidase) were measured. Electron microscopic studies were performed. Thirty min occlusion induced mitochondrial dysfunction without leakage of lysosomal enzymes. Reperfusion for 1 h reversed these changes. However occlusion for 2 h induced mitochondrial dysfunction associated with the leakage of lysosomal enzymes, and mitochondrial dysfunction was not reversed by 1 h reperfusion. Propranolol reduced mitochondrial dysfunction after 2 h occlusion and prevented leakage of lysosomal enzymes. Mitochondrial function was fairly well maintained after 1 h reperfusion in dogs premedicated with propranolol. Structural changes in mitochondria were observed in the 2 h occlusion/l h reperfusion group, and were reduced by premedication with propranolol. These results suggest that irreversible injury of ischaemic mitochondria is closely linked with instability of lysosomal membranes, and that propranolol prevented irreversible myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction.", 
    "84": "A double blind, randomised crossover study with 20 patients was performed to compare the antianginal effects of atenolol 100 mg once daily and pindolol 5 mg thrice daily. After a placebo run-in period, 2 treatments were given for 2 wk each. The number of anginal attacks and the nitroglycerin (NTG) consumption were determined. During bicycle exercise testing, the systolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), double product and exercise tolerance were measured. Both drugs reduced the number of anginal attacks and NTG consumption relative to the placebo, with atenolol being more effective than pindolol. During exercise, both beta-blockers produced a slight increase in BP and HR compared to the placebo. HR attained with atenolol was lower than pindolol at the same workload. The total duration of exercise and the maximal tolerated workload were greater in atenolol than pindolol experiment. The special properties of beta-blockers, such as cardioselectivity or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), may have clinical importance in the treatment of angina pectoris.", 
    "85": "Thirty-two insulin-dependent (type I) diabetic patients were studied to detect cardiovascular autonomic nervous system involvement. Half percent (16 cases) were men. Their ages ranged from 6 to 64 years (29.03 years). The average time of diagnosed diabetes was 6.5 years. The group was submitted to several clinical (respiratory, arrhythmia, Valsalva, isometric, orthostatic) and pharmacological tests (propranolol and atropine). The physiological responses were measured as heart beat frequency and blood pressure. Results were analyzed by various statistical methods. Evaluation through a diabetic complication scale showed that ten (31.25%) were uncomplicated), 14 (43.75%) at grade 1, four (12.50%) at grade 2, two (6.25%) at grade 3 and two (6.25%) at grade 4. This scale only correlated to the term of diabetes (p less than 0.01). Results from the autonomic test battery indicated that 12 (37.50%) had isolated parasympathetic damage, five (15.62%) sympathetic lesions, and two (6.25%) had mixed type involvement. We observed, as to cardiovascular autonomic involvement, 13 (40.62%) had no involvement and 19 (59.38%) had some degree of damage; in the latter group, 15 (46.78%) had early lesions and four (12.50%) definite.", 
    "86": "The ocular hypotensive action of a group of dopaminergic antagonists was observed in the low intraocular pressure model of albino rabbits infused with 20% NaCl. It was found that haloperidol lowered IOP significantly in both eyes, though the drug was administered in one eye. Compared with timolol and pilocarpine, the strength in lowering IOP was in the order haloperidol greater than timolol greater than pilocarpine. Haloperidol did not affect the pupil. It may be a promising antiglaucoma agent.", 
    "87": "Benzothiadiazine diuretic agents and beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drugs are two of the main groups of drugs used to treat mild hypertension. Recently, questions have been raised about their relative efficacy in preventing morbidity and mortality from vascular disease in addition to their effect on lowering blood pressure. Attention has been focused on the unfavorable metabolic effects of diuretic drugs and the proven value of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Four randomized controlled trials comparing drugs in these two classes have been published: the Medical Research Council trial, the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial, and the Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertension study. These trials, especially that of the Medical Research Council, have raised some questions about the relative efficacy of these two classes of drugs in preventing stroke in smokers and nonsmokers. Overall, there is little evidence of a reduction in morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction. The predicted advantage of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade over diuretic therapy has not been realized although there are sufficient hints of a differential benefit to encourage the performance of further trials.", 
    "88": "Three recently concluded large randomized clinical trials have compared the preventive effects of diuretic agents and beta-blockers in the treatment of approximately 22,000 subjects with hypertension. In the Medical Research Council trial, bendrofluazide (10 mg daily) was compared with a dose of propranolol (as much as 240 mg daily), a nonselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Two selective beta-blockers, atenolol (100 mg daily) and metoprolol (200 mg daily), were compared with bendrofluazide (5-10 mg daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (50-100 mg daily) in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial. In the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, 160 mg of slow-release oxprenolol, a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was compared with a diuretic-based regimen not containing beta-blockers. In each trial, similar reductions in mean diastolic blood pressure were achieved with diuretic and beta-blocker treatment that lasted for several years. All-cause mortality and fatal and nonfatal stroke and coronary event rates were also similar in the treatment groups. Thus, it appears that beta-blockers are as effective as diuretic agents in improving survival and in preventing major morbid events. Regarding cigarette smoking and stroke incidence, observations based on post hoc subgroup analyses of the Medical Research Council trial were not supported by subgroup findings in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension and the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension trials, and these observations should not form the basis for any treatment recommendations."
