BP normalization was achieved in 72.5% and in 16.8% of patients BP was lowered more than 10% without achievement of target values. Pulse rate lowering by more than 15 beats/min occurred in 40.3% of patients. Combined therapy was required in 15.2% of patients. Adverse effects specific for the class of beta-adrenoblockers caused cessation of betaxolol therapy in 3 patients. The drug was found ineffective in 4 patients (2.7%). Thus we confirmed high clinical efficacy and good safety and tolerability of betaxolol in patients with mild and moderate hypertension.",

The analysis of the treadmill tests results with the central and peripheral hemodynamic data changes, the level of myocardial oxygen contribution, metabolic changes has shown that their connection is widely varied. This is explained by inflammatory processes spreading which formed the pathological connection of the whole biliary system and inflammatory focuses with pain sinchrone. Preoperative conservative treatment, including individual mechanisms of heart dysfunction based on treadmill and EchoCG, for the correction of hemodynamic is not necessary on the background of pain, cholemia, pancreas induration which forces myocardium up to the liquidation of pathogenetic mechanism of hepatoduodenal zone. That's why the methods of small invasive endosurgery are used in the complex conservative preoperative treatment.",

We wished to determine and improve adherence to clinical guidelines for these topics in our institution. PATIENTS, MATERIAL, AND METHODS: A prospective survey was conducted over several weeks on operated patients in a 1200-beds medical center (a teaching, community and referral hospital in Jerusalem, Israel). Eligibility for and actual administration of prophylactic treatment with anticoagulant and beta-blockers were determined. Following an intervention program, which included staff meetings, development of local protocols, and academic detailing by a nurse, the survey was repeated.",

After the intervention, adequate anticoagulation increased to 50% (95% CI = 40-59) of eligible patients (P < 0.001). Initiation of beta-blockers in preventing perioperative cardiac events was very low (0%, 95% CI = 0-5%) and did not increase after intervention.", 
    "4": "Adherence to guidelines for prevention of surgical complications was found to be low in our institution. A multifaceted intervention significantly increased use of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism but not for coronary events.

The differences in QT dispersion in the initial ECGs recorded were compared between the 3 groups, and the QT dispersion changes after chronic beta-blocker therapy in 19 moderate to severe cases under 35 years, along with the changes during exercise in 9 cases before and after beta-blocker therapy were evaluated and compared.",

    "15": "Beta-blockers have been considered for decades as effective agents in preventing coronary events in hypertensive patients. Actually, the scrutiny of the available data arises some doubts over the real value of this pharmacological class. In primary prevention, the clinical benefits of beta-blockers are poorly documented: the studies conducted against placebo (MRC, IPPPSH...) did not show any significant differences regarding the rate of coronary events (except within non smokers); moreover, the beneficial effect of propranolol in preventing sudden deaths and silent myocardial infarctions has been reported byjust one retrospective analysis. Likewise in HAPPHY study, the comparison with diuretics did not emphasize a clear superiority of one of both classes; the better effect of metoprolol regarding overall mortality and fatal coronary events was shown in the pecular subset MAPHY, only. Furthermore, in elderly people, HEP, MRC OA and STOP studies did not find any significant effect of beta-blockers in preventing coronary events, as compared with placebo. However, SHEP study, which involved patients older than 60 years with isolated systolic hypertension receiving first a diuretic, then a beta-blocker(atenolol) in 1/4 of the cases, demonstrated a significant reduction versus placebo both in strokes and in coronary events. Finally, in UKPDS, CAPP, LIFE and CONVINCE studies, atenolol turned out to have a similar efficacy as captopril, losartan and verapamil, in preventing ischemic heart disease. Among the numerous published meta-analyses, that of Psaty pointed out the absence of a primary cardioprotective effect by beta-blockers; more recently, that of Carlberg, emphasized atenolol given alone as the first-line drug to fail in significantly reducing coronary events and strokes. In secondary prevention, some more convincing data may be found in the literature, regarding post myocardial infarction patients (meta-analyses of Staessen, 1982, Yusuf, 1985 and Soriano, 1997), as well as those with stable angina (BIP study in diabetics) or silent ischemia (ASIST study: significant reduction in number and duration of ischemic events by atenolol). Moreover, INVEST study recently showed atenolol and verapamil to have an equivalent efficacy in the hypertensive patients with stable coronary artery disease. Last, hypertension should be reminded as resulting in many cases of heart failure, a pathology where beta-blockers have clearly demonstrated their beneficial effects.", 
    "16": "Oxaliplatin, an effective cytotoxic treatment in combination with 5-fluorouracil for colorectal cancer, is associated with sensory, motor and autonomic neurotoxicity. Motor symptoms include hyperexcitability while autonomic effects include urinary retention, but the cause of these side-effects is unknown. We examined the effects on motor nerve function in the mouse hemidiaphragm and on the autonomic system in the vas deferens. In the mouse diaphragm, oxaliplatin (0.5 mM) induced multiple endplate potentials (EPPs) following a single stimulus, and was associated with an increase in spontaneous miniature EPP frequency. In the vas deferens, spontaneous excitatory junction potential frequency was increased after 30 min exposure to oxaliplatin; no changes in resting Ca(2+) concentration in nerve terminal varicosities were observed, and recovery after stimuli trains was unaffected. In both tissues, an oxaliplatin-induced increase in spontaneous activity was prevented by the voltage-gated Na(+) channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX). Carbamazepine (0.3 mM) also prevented multiple EPPs and the increase in spontaneous activity in both tissues. In diaphragm, beta-pompilidotoxin (100 microM), which slows Na(+) channel inactivation, induced multiple EPPs similar to oxaliplatin's effect. By contrast, blockers of K(+) channels (4-aminopyridine and apamin) did not replicate oxaliplatin-induced hyperexcitability in the diaphragm. The prevention of hyperexcitability by TTX blockade implies that oxaliplatin acts on nerve conduction rather than by effecting repolarisation. The similarity between beta-pompilidotoxin and oxaliplatin suggests that alteration of voltage-gated Na(+) channel kinetics is likely to underlie the acute neurotoxic actions of oxaliplatin.", 
    "17": "Heart failure results in neurohormonal activation of which the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) is the main mediator. Activation of this system leads to the production of angiotensin II (ATII), which leads to multiple adverse short-term and long-term effects, including hemodynamic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, inflammation, and cardiac remodeling. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) exert favorable effects in congestive heart failure (CHF) by inhibiting the production of ATII. It has been shown that ACEIs may not be able to suppress the production of ATII completely because there are RAS-independent mechanisms of ATII production. Hence, it was thought that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) might be more useful in CHF because they directly block the ATII receptors. Many studies have been done to evaluate the role of ARBs in CHF. We reviewed these studies and have attempted to define the place and ARBs in the therapy for CHF.",

Forty-one patients with heart failure were randomized into a clinical trial. Bisoprolol was started, and the dose was regularly up-titrated. BNP was measured monthly. The clinical group had beta-blocker dosage increased according to standard care, whereas the BNP group had beta-blocker dosage up-titrated according to plasma BNP levels plus standard care. The primary outcome was mean beta-blocker dose achieved after 3 months. BNP levels, left ventricular ejection fraction, clinical score, quality of life, and hospitalization were collected in all patients. BNP-guided up-titration of beta blocker in ambulatory patients with heart failure did not result in higher doses of beta blocker at the end of 3 months+/-SD (5.9+/-4.3 mg vs. 4.4+/-3.4 mg, p=0.22). Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly improved in both groups by 7.3% (95% confidence interval, 4.1%-10.4%; p<0.0001).

The increasing rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes, however, may slow the current favorable trends for deaths attributable to CVD in many developed countries. To improve control of risk factors for CVD, Wald and Law proposed a \"polypill,\" containing a statin, a diuretic, a beta-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, aspirin, and folic acid. This combination pharmacotherapy (CP) could be made widely available without treating specific risk factors or individuals. A workshop sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed the concept of CP for both primary and secondary prevention. Combination pharmacotherapy may prove to be efficacious but may also have side effects and poor adherence, which may be greater than or less than that of other preventive approaches. Randomized trials are needed to study these issues, although the design for such trials is uncertain. The ability of CP to prevent CVD in a cost-effective manner must be demonstrated. Minority groups and people with low socioeconomic status in the United States have an increased risk for CVD, and the effectiveness of such pharmacotherapy must be considered for these populations. Combination pharmacotherapy may prove especially effective in the developing world, where studies of CP may precede those done in wealthier countries. Combination pharmacotherapy may have tremendous potential, but additional study and detailed evaluation are necessary.", 
    "20": "CTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a DNA-binding protein of vertebrates that plays essential roles in regulating genome activity through its capacity to act as an enhancer blocker. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify protein partners of CTCF that could regulate its activity. Using full-length CTCF as bait we recovered Kaiso, a POZ-zinc finger transcription factor, as a specific binding partner. The interaction occurs through a C-terminal region of CTCF and the POZ domain of Kaiso. CTCF and Kaiso are co-expressed in many tissues, and CTCF was specifically co-immunoprecipitated by several Kaiso monoclonal antibodies from nuclear lysates. Kaiso is a bimodal transcription factor that recognizes methylated CpG dinucleotides or a conserved unmethylated sequence (TNGCAGGA, the Kaiso binding site). We identified one consensus unmethylated Kaiso binding site in close proximity to the CTCF binding site in the human 5' beta-globin insulator. We found, in an insulation assay, that the presence of this Kaiso binding site reduced the enhancer-blocking activity of CTCF. These data suggest that the Kaiso-CTCF interaction negatively regulates CTCF insulator activity.",

    "34": "A significant number of animal and human studies demonstrate that memories for new experiences are encoded more effectively under environmental or laboratory conditions which elevate peripheral concentrations of the hormone epinephrine and in turn, induce emotional arousal. Although this phenomenon has been replicated across several learning paradigms, understanding of how this arousal related hormone affects memory processing remains obscure because epinephrine does not freely enter into the central circulation to produce any direct effects on the brain. This study examined whether epinephrine's actions on the CNS may be mediated by the initial activation of peripheral vagal fibers that project to the brain. The vagus was selected as a candidate for this role since it is densely embedded with beta-adrenergic receptors and the peripheral endings of this nerve innervate a broad spectrum of sensory organs that are directly affected by epinephrine release. Electrophysiological recordings of cervical vagal activity was measured over 110 min in urethane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats given saline, epinephrine (0.3 mg/kg), the peripherally acting beta-adrenergic antagonist sotalol (2.0 mg/kg), or a combination of sotalol followed 15 min later by an injection of epinephrine. Epinephrine produced a significant increase in vagal nerve firing 10 min post-injection (p < .05) relative to controls and neural impulses recorded from the vagus remained significantly elevated for the remaining 55 min collection period. The excitatory actions of epinephrine were not observed in groups given an identical dose of the hormone after peripheral beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with sotalol. These findings demonstrate that neural discharge in vagal afferent fibers is increased by elevations in peripheral concentrations of epinephrine and the significance of these findings in understanding how epinephrine modulates brain limbic structures to encode and store new information into memory is discussed.", 
    "35": "Chronic heart failure is characterised by excess adrenergic activity that augurs a poor prognosis. The reasons for increased adrenergic activity are complex and incompletely understood. The circumstantial evidence relating increased activity to adverse outcome is powerful, but not yet conclusive. In normal subjects, autonomic control of the circulation is predominantly under the control of sympatho-inhibitory inputs from the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors, with a small input from the excitatory ergo- and chemo-receptors. In heart failure, the situation is reversed, with loss of the restraining input from the baroreceptors and an increase in the excitatory inputs, resulting in excessive adrenergic activity. The circumstantial evidence linking neuroendocrine activation with poor outcome coupled with the clinical success of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has long suggested that inhibition of adrenergic activity might be beneficial in heart failure. There is a number of potential ways of achieving this. Improved treatment of heart failure itself may reduce sympathetic drive. There is an interplay between angiotensin II, aldosterone and the sympathetic nervous system, and thus RAAS antagonists, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and spironolactone could directly reduce sympathetic activation. Exercise rehabilitation may similarly reduce sympathetic activity.Recently, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists have been conclusively shown to improve symptoms, reduce hospitalisations and increase survival. However, the demonstration that central reduction of sympathetic activity with agents such as moxonidine increases morbidity and mortality suggests that we do not properly understand the role of sympathetic activation in the pathophysiology of heart failure.", 
    "36": "Recent demonstration that the level of sympathetic nervous drive to the failing heart in patients with severe heart failure is a major determinant of prognosis, and that mortality in heart failure is reduced by beta-adrenergic blockade, indicate the clinical relevance of heart failure neuroscience research. The cardiac sympathetic nerves are preferentially stimulated in severe heart failure, with the application of isotope dilution methods for measuring cardiac norepinephrine release to plasma indicating that in untreated patients cardiac norepinephrine spillover is increased as much as 50-fold, similar to levels of release seen in the healthy heart during near maximal exercise. This preferential activation of the cardiac sympathetic outflow contributes to arrhythmia development and to progressive deterioration of the myocardium, and has been linked to mortality in both mild and severe cardiac failure. Although the central nervous system mechanisms involved in the sympathetic nervous activation at present remain uncertain, increased intracardiac diastolic pressure seems to be one peripheral reflex stimulus, and increased forebrain norepinephrine turnover an important central mechanism.Additional neurophysiological abnormalities present in the failing human heart include release of the sympathetic cotransmitters, epinephrine and neuropeptide Y, at high levels more typical of their release during exercise in healthy subjects, and the possible presynaptic augmentation of norepinephrine release from the cardiac sympathetic nerves by the regionally released epinephrine. Following on the demonstrable benefit of beta-adrenergic blockade in heart failure, additional antiadrenergic measures (central suppression of sympathetic outflow with imidazoline binding agents such as clonidine, blocking of norepinephrine synthesis by dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibition, antagonism of neuropeptide Y) are now under active investigation.", 
    "37": "Despite clinical trials demonstrating that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems can reduce the mortality and morbidity risk associated with heart failure, these drugs have remained underutilized in general clinical practice. In particular, many patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction fail to receive beta blockers, although this class of drugs, as well as other antihypertensive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, are recommended as part of routine heart failure therapy by national expert consensus guidelines. In-hospital initiation of beta-blocker therapy may improve long-term utilization by physicians and compliance by patients through obviating many of the misperceived dangers associated with beta blockade. The following review of the clinical trial data from the Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction (RESOLVD) trial, the Metoprolol Controlled-Release Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure (MERIT-HF), the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS-II), the Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) trial, and the Initiation Management Predischarge Process for Assessment of Carvedilol Therapy for Heart Failure (IMPACT-HF) trial on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of beta blockers indicates that early initiation can be safely achieved and can improve patient outcomes.", 
    "38": "Hypertension is a risk factor for mild cognitive deterioration and vascular dementia. Cognitive deterioration attributable to normal aging was distinguished from cognitive deterioration related to hypertension by means of neuropsychologic tests. Sixty hypertensive patients, aged 65-80 years, were compared with 30 normotensive individuals. Patients with a history of stroke and/or transient ischemic attacks, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, or bypass surgery, and those diagnosed with dementia, depression, or anxiety, were excluded. Neither gender differences, duration of hypertension (10.2+/-8.2 years), nor prescribed antihypertensive drug treatment had an influence on study results. Immediate recall was impaired in both groups. The hypertensive patients evinced impairment in all tests vs. the normotensive subjects. Mean deferred recall scores +/- SD were 5.68+/-2.6 vs. 7.13+/-2.4; p<0.01. Deficits in attention speed and executive function, as measured by nonperformance on the Trail Making Test Part B, were present in 46% of hypertensive patients vs. 13% of normotensive patients (p<0.005), with more errors made by the hypertensive patients (1.15+/-1.54 vs. 0.46+/-0.9; p<0.02). Scores on the Stroop Color and Word Test also revealed deficits in the hypertensive patients (24.7+/-7.6 vs. 32+/-10.7; p<0.005).

In the rat cerebral cortical slices, these two tested beta-adrenoceptor antagonists inhibited the isoprenaline-evoked cAMP response, but had no effect on the nucleotide accumulation under basal (non-stimulated) conditions.

The disease may, inter alia, be caused by the administration of bisphosphonates (e.g. pamidronate) particularly in young humans. The issue of the effect of pamindronate-induced osteopetrosis on the function of blood circulation and autonomic nervous system remains open. In order to clarify this problem, the present study concentrated on the effect of catecholamines on blood pressure in the marrow cavity in rats with pamindronate-induced osteopetrosis. The experiments consisted in pamidronate administration to young male Wistar rats at doses of 3 mg/kg sc, for 3 or 6 weeks. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, isoprenaline as well as adrenoceptor antagonists (phentolamine and propranolol) were administered to the controls and the rats with pamindronate-induced osteopetrosis.

    "41": "Adenosine-induced tachycardia is suggested to be mediated via A(2A) receptors; however, the exact mechanism for this effect remains to be understood. The present study was carried out using regadenoson, a selective A(2A) adenosine receptor agonist, to determine the role of the A(2A) receptor subtype in adenosine-induced tachycardia. Regadenoson (0.3-50 microg/kg) given as a rapid i.v. bolus to awake rats caused a dose-dependent increase in heart rate (HR). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased at lower doses, whereas at higher doses, there was a decrease in MAP. The increase in HR was evident at the lowest dose (0.3 microg/kg) of regadenoson at which there was no appreciable decrease in MAP. Pretreatment with 30 microg/kg ZM 241385 [4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)-[1,2,4]-triazolo-[2,3-a]-[1,3,5]-triazin-5-ylamino]ethyl)phenol], an A(2A) receptor antagonist, attenuated the decrease in MAP and the increase in HR caused by regadenoson. Pretreatment with metoprolol (1 mg/kg), a beta-blocker, attenuated the increase in HR but had no effect on the hypotension caused by regadenoson. In the presence of hexamethonium (10 mg/kg), a ganglionic blocker, the tachycardia was completely prevented even though MAP was further reduced. Regadenoson treatment (10 microg/kg) significantly (p < 0.05) increased plasma norepinephrine levels almost 2-fold above baseline. The dissociation of HR and MAP effects by dose, time, and pharmacological interventions provides evidence that tachycardia caused by regadenoson is independent of the decrease in MAP and may not entirely be baroreflex-mediated, suggesting that regadenoson may cause a direct stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system via activation of A(2A) adenosine receptors.",

Using it as a screening tool for potential side effects of drugs, we here provide evidence for d-sotalol-induced delayed repolarization in human embryonic stem (hES) cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Thus, the combination of the microelectrode array system with cardiac clusters derived from hES cells heralds a paradigm shift toward improved pharmaceutical drug safety.

Compressed tablets were prepared from these cation exchange polyelectrolytes. Release profiles followed zero order kinetics (n>0.90; n is the release exponent). As the hydrophobicity of the polyelectrolytes increased, the rate of release decreased and deviated from linearity (n=0.7). Both the ionic strength of the medium as well as the solubility of the drug affected the rate of release. In acidic media (pH 1.2) a burst of drug was released but the release was halted by a layer of non-ionized polymer precipitated on the surface of the tablets.

Chronic carvedilol treatment of patients with non-terminal heart failure reduced the inotropic sensitivity of atrial trabeculae to noradrenaline and adrenaline 5.6-fold and 91.2-fold, respectively, compared to beta1-blocker-treated patients, consistent with persistent preferential blockade of beta2-adrenoceptors. In terminal heart failure carvedilol treatment reduced 1.8-fold and 25.1-fold the sensitivity of right ventricular trabeculae to noradrenaline and adrenaline, respectively, but metoprolol treatment did not reduce the sensitivity to the catecholamines. Increases of current (ICa,L) produced by noradrenaline and adrenaline were not different in atrial myocytes obtained from non-terminal heart failure patients treated with metoprolol or carvedilol, consistent with dissociation of both beta-blockers from the receptors.",

In this approach, periodate was used under mild conditions to oxidize the carbohydrate chains in AGP for attachment to a hydrazide-activated support. The final conditions chosen for this oxidation involved the reaction of 5.0 mg/mL AGP at 4 degrees C and pH 7.0 with 5-20 mM periodic acid for 10 min. These conditions helped maximize the immobilization of AGP without significantly affecting its activity. This method was evaluated by using it to attach AGP to silica for use in high-performance affinity chromatography and self-competition zonal elution studies. In work with R- and S-propranolol, only one type of binding site was observed for both enantiomers on the immobilized AGP, in agreement with previous studies using soluble AGP. The association equilibrium constants measured for the immobilized AGP with R- and S-propranolol at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C were 2.7 x 10(6) and 4.2 x 10(6) M(-1), respectively, with linear van't Hoff plots being obtained between 5 and 37 degrees C. Work performed with other drugs also gave good agreement between the behavior seen for immobilized AGP and that for soluble AGP.

The methylcellulose phenol red solution was gavaged 20 min after peptide injection, and gastric emptying was measured 20 min later. The intracisternal injection of Ucn 2 (0.1 and 1 microg) and Ucn 1 (1 microg) decreased gastric emptying to 37.8 +/- 6.9%, 23.1 +/- 8.6%, and 21.6 +/- 5.9%, respectively, compared with 58.4 +/- 3.8% after intracisternal vehicle. At lower doses, Ucn 2 (0.03 microg) and Ucn 1 (0.1 microg) had no effect. The CRF(2) antagonist astressin(2)-B (3 microg ic) antagonized intracisternal Ucn 2 (0.1 microg) and CRF (0.3 microg)-induced inhibition of gastric emptying. Vagotomy enhanced intracisternal Ucn 2 (0.1 or 1 microg)-induced inhibition of gastric emptying compared with sham-operated group, whereas it blocked intracisternal CRF (1 microg) inhibitory action (45.5 +/- 8.4% vs. 9.7 +/- 9.7%). Sympathetic blockade by bretylium prevented intracisternal and intracerebroventricular Ucn 2-induced delayed gastric emptying, whereas it did not influence intravenous Ucn 2-, intracisternal CRF-, and intracisternal Ucn 1-induced inhibition of gastric emptying. Prazosin abolished the intracisternal Ucn 2 inhibitory effect, whereas yohimbine and propranolol did not. None of the pretreatments modified basal gastric emptying.

Laboratory blood-analysis showed raised non-cholestatic liver-enzyme levels suggesting alcohol-abuse. On history taking the patient was shown to have been suffering from personality changes and multiple hallucinogenic episodes for the previous two years. He had been seen and evaluated by a neurologist to that effect. The patient's family had accepted the situation and thought of it as dementia, probably caused by alcohol abuse. He had been treated for atrial flutter and was taking acenocoumerol, atorvastatin, quinapril and metoprolol 50 mg twice daily as medication. During admission the patient appeared to be suffering from a delirium with complex visual and auditory hallucinations, for which he was given haloperidol. Revision of medication use led to the stopping of metoprolol, which had been started two years earlier. Within 24 hours the delirium had disappeared completely. There was spontaneous fall in the liver enzymes. At his last follow-up, the patient had had no psychiatric symptoms for 6 months. The relationship between stopping metoprolol and the disappearance of the psychosis appeared to be a causal one and this is supported by the limited literature available on this subject.",

Thirty rats were divided equally into three groups: the control group (group 1) was only anaesthetized, without creating an ischaemia-reperfusion injury; group 2 was submitted to ischaemia (4 h), followed by a 2-h reperfusion period; and group 3 was pre-treated with carvedilol (2 mg/kg per day) for 10 days prior to ischaemia-reperfusion. Ischaemia-reperfusion produced a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in the liver, lungs, muscle and serum compared with control treatment, and pre-treatment with carvedilol prevented these changes. Ischaemia-reperfusion caused a significant increase in malondialdehyde and nitric oxide (NO) levels in liver, lungs, muscle (except NO) and serum compared with control treatment, and carvedilol prevented these changes. In conclusion, it might be inferred that carvedilol could be used safely to prevent oxidative injury during reperfusion following ischaemia in humans.",

The optimized topology of the network was 3-3-1. 32 experimental mobility data sets collected from the literature were employed to test the correlation ability and prediction capability of the proposed method. The mean percentage deviation (MPD) between the experimental and calculated values was used as an accuracy criterion. The MPDs obtained for different numerical analyses varied between 0.21% and 13.74%.

The self-emulsification time following introduction into an aqueous medium under gentle agitation was evaluated. The minimum self-emulsification time was found at a Tween 80 content of 40%. The particle size distribution and zeta-potential were determined. Benzoic acid had a dual function, it improved the self-emulsification performance of SEDDS and SMEDDS in 0.1 N HCl and lead to a positively charged emulsion. The in vitro dissolution rate of carvedilol from SEDDS and SMEDDS was more than two-fold faster compared with that from tablets. The developed SEDDS formulations significantly improved the oral bioavailability of carvedilol significantly, and the relative oral bioavailability of SEDDS compared with commercially available tablets was 413%.",

In 72 patients treated with metoprolol or bisoprolol, CYP2D6 genotype (ie, CYP2D6*1, *2, *4, *5, *10, and *14) was determined. No patients except one who was heterozygous for CYP2D6*5 carried the null alleles of CYP2D6. The homozygote frequency for CYP2D6*10 was relatively high (19.4%) and these patients had greater peak and trough plasma concentrations of metoprolol than the other patients. Isoproterenol-induced percentage increases in heart rate were 58% and 38% less at the low and high rate of isoproterenol infusion (0.02 and 0.04 microg/kg/min), respectively, in patients homozygous for CYP2D6*10 than in the other patients at the trough, but not at the peak concentrations. In contrast, CYP2D6 genotype did not affect plasma concentrations of bisoprolol and the extent of its beta-adrenergic inhibition. Thus, in patients routinely treated with metoprolol, CYP2D6 genotype significantly affects circadian variations of beta-adrenergic inhibition induced by metoprolol. In contrast, bisoprolol has a relatively constant beta-adrenergic inhibition independent of CYP2D6 genotype.",

These polymeric pseudophases are then utilized to study the influence of chain length and DP for the enantioseparations of seven beta-blockers in MEKC. Variations in chain length and concentration of polymeric surfactants showed significant effects on the chiral resolution (Rs) and efficiency (N). A relatively large elution range combined with the highest polarity and aggregation number (A) but the lowest retention time, partial specific volume, and optical rotation generated with C8-polymeric surfactant results in simultaneous enantioseparation of all seven beta-blockers with higher N and R(s). In particular, highly hydrophobic beta-blockers are better resolved with shorter hydrocarbon chain even at higher surfactant concentration, which is unachievable with longer chain surfactant. On the other hand, polymer derived from C11-triple bond provided smaller A value compared to C11-double bond surfactant. However, chiral Rs of hydrophobic beta-blockers are still achievable with the C11-triple bond surfactant with enhanced N and shorter analysis time. In addition, effect of polymerization concentration is evaluated by polymerizing all five surfactants at five times their respective CMCs and 100 mM equivalent monomer concentrations. Polymerization of shorter chain (C8 and C9) double-bonded surfactants at five times their respective CMCs results in higher A values with better chiral Rs and N compared to the same two surfactants polymerized at 100 mM.",

Basal QT interval was significantly greater under halothane-anesthesia than urethane-anesthesia (192 +/- 7 vs 132 +/- 5 ms, respectively), whereas the reverse was true for the heart rate (190 +/- 7 vs 248 +/- 11 beats/min, respectively). The typical I(Kr)-blocker dl-sotalol (0.1 to 3 mg/kg, i.v.) induced dose-related bradycardia and QT interval prolongation under each anesthesia. The extent of maximum prolongation in the QT interval was greater under halothane-anesthesia than urethane-anesthesia (+101 +/- 15 vs +49 +/- 3 ms, respectively), whereas that of peak change in the heart rate was smaller under the former than the latter (-49 +/- 8 vs -63 +/- 5 beats/min, respectively). Pretreatment of the animals under urethane-anesthesia with the selective I(Ks) blocker chromanol 293B (n = 6) increased the extent of the dl-sotalol-induced QT interval prolongation to +57 +/- 8 ms, which was only 0.56 times of that under the halothane-anesthesia, whereas the pretreatment increased the peak change in the heart rate to -76 +/- 12 ms.

    "130": "The adaptive changes that develop in the pressure-overloaded left ventricular (LV) myocardium include cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Although the former is known to depend to a sizeable extent on sympathetic (over)activity, little information exists whether the same applies to the latter, ie, whether excess catecholamine exposure contributes to the imbalance between collagen deposition by fibroblasts and degradation by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), eventually leading to LV collagen accumulation. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to abdominal aortic banding (B) or sham operation (S) and treated with beta-blockade (Bb, oral propranolol, 40 mg/kg per day), chemical sympathectomy (Sx, 6-hydroxydopamine, 150 mg/kg intraperitoneal twice per week) or vehicle (Vh). Ten weeks later, systolic blood pressure, LV weight, collagen abundance (computer-aided histology), zymographic matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 activity and its specific tissue inhibitor concentration (TIMP-2) were measured. Both sympathectomy and beta-blockade failed to attenuate the banding-induced blood pressure elevation but significantly attenuated the attendant LV hypertrophy. As expected, pressure-overload hypertrophy was associated with interstitial fibrosis (collagen: 4.37+/-1.23% BVh versus 1.23+/-0.44% SVh, P<0.05), which was abolished by sympathectomy (2.55+/-1.31%, P=not significant versus SSx) but left unchanged by beta-blockade (4.11+/-1.23%, P<0.05 versus both SBb and BSx). beta-blockade, but not sympathectomy, was also associated with an increased TIMP-2/MMP-2 ratio (P<0.05), indicating reduced interstitial collagenolytic activity. In separate groups of banded and sham-operated rats, treatment with the alpha-receptor blocker doxazosin (10 mg/kg per day) displayed similar antifibrotic and biochemical effects as sympathectomy. Thus in the course of experimental pressure overload, the sympathetic nervous system plays a major pro-fibrotic role, which is mediated via alpha-adrenergic but not beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "131": "Beta-blockade is a standard cardiovascular therapy known to induce the up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density. Upon ligand-binding, beta-adrenoceptors are normally internalised via the arrestin pathway, and after dissociation they are re-inserted into the membrane. This means that at high catecholamine levels the adrenoceptor density is low and under beta-blockade it is high. The insertion of receptors into the membrane is often dependent on farnesylation processes that can be inhibited by statins. We carried out a prospective, controlled, observational study to determine whether beta-blockade-induced up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density is attenuated by statin therapy and whether this would subsequently affect catecholamine consumption during surgery. We obtained pre-operative blood samples and intra-operative biopsies of the right atrial appendage from 39 patients (age: 65+/-5 years; BMI: 28+/-1) undergoing coronary bypass surgery with or without simvastatin (20 mg/day) therapy and with or without concomitant metoprolol therapy (50 mg/day). The atrial tissue was used for radioligand-binding studies with (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) and for assessment of the beta-adrenoceptor subtype distribution following standard protocols. In the blood samples, plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations were determined using HPLC. In all tissue samples, we found a total beta-adrenoceptor density of 38+/-4 fmol/mg protein in untreated controls; this which was up-regulated to 55+/-5 fmol/mg protein in patients receiving metoprolol. This increase in receptor number was nearly prevented completely by simvastatin therapy (42+/-5 fmol/mg protein). The up-regulation could be attributed to increases in the beta1-adrenoceptor subtype. In contrast, simvastatin alone had no effect on beta-adrenoceptor density. Pre-operative adrenaline levels were slightly reduced in all drug therapy groups (nonsignificant differences), while the levels noradrenaline were not significantly different among the groups. With respect to the perioperative catecholamine requirements, patients on metoprolol needed significantly less dopamine than control patients, while patients undergoing simvastatin/metoprolol therapy needed as much as the controls. The post-operative total catecholamine requirements were not different among the four groups of patients. There were no differences in plasma metoprolol concentration between patients receiving metoprolol alone and those receiving a combination of metoprolol and simvastatin.",

Additional simvastatin therapy did not reduce post-operative catecholamine consumption.",

Timed-pregnant dams were gavage fed 100 mg of nitrofen at 9.5-day gestation to induce CDH in the fetuses, and distal air space fluid absorption experiments were carried out on 22-day gestation (term) fetuses. Controls were nitrofen-exposed fetuses without CDH. Absorption of distal air space fluid was measured from the increase in 131I-albumin concentration in an isosmolar, physiological solution instilled into the developing lungs. In controls, distal air space fluid absorption was rapid and mediated by beta-adrenoceptors as demonstrated by reversal to fluid secretion after propranolol. Normal lung fluid absorption was also partially inhibited by amiloride. In contrast, CDH fetuses continued to show lung fluid secretion, and this secretion was not affected by either propranolol or amiloride. CDH lungs showed a 67% reduction in alpha-ENaC and beta-ENaC expression, but no change in alpha1-Na-K-ATPase expression. These studies demonstrate: 1) CDH delays lung maturation with impaired distal air space fluid absorption secondary to inadequate Na+ uptake by the distal lung epithelium that results in fluid-filled lungs at birth with reduced capacity to establish postnatal breathing, and 2) the main stimulus to lung fluid absorption in near-term control fetuses, elevated endogenous epinephrine levels, is not functional in CDH fetuses.",

Furthermore, induction of HO-1 by isoproterenol effectively protected RAW264.7 cells from effects of glucose oxidase treatment, which was abrogated either by HO-1 inhibitor, ZnPP IX and beta-adenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. Thus, stimulation of HO-1 production through beta(1)-adenoceptors, and via the PKA pathways by isoproterenol, can enable RAW264.7 cells to resist oxidant stress, suggesting that catecholamine hormones may be necessary, at least, to maximize defending role of macrophages.",

Twenty-seven patients with IDC and NYHA class I to IV heart failure but without evidence of oedema, reduced peripheral perfusion, or elevated plasma endotoxin concentrations were evaluated for indicators of cytokine activation. Plasma TNF-alpha concentrations were raised (p < 0.001) in patients prior to commencement of medical therapy as compared to controls (n = 27). In addition, endotoxin-free cultured whole blood TNF-alpha production was enhanced (p < 0.02) in the patients.

Against a role for neurohumoral substances in promoting excessive white cell TNF-alpha synthesis the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan, failed to modulate white cell TNF- alpha production in patients with IDC.

A beta1 partial agonist, xamoterol, rescued 74% of catecholamine-deficient (tyrosine-hydroxylase-null) pups to birth, a survival rate equivalent to that with a nonspecific betaAR agonist, isoproterenol (87%). Receptor autoradiography showed that beta1ARs were only found on the mouse heart at E12.5, while beta2ARs were localized to the liver and vasculature. To determine if the response to hypoxia was intrinsic to the heart, isolated fetal hearts were incubated under hypoxic conditions in the presence of a betaAR agonist. Heart rate was reduced to 25-30% by hypoxia alone, but was restored to 63% of prehypoxic levels with 100 nM isoproterenol. Restoration was completely prevented if beta1ARs were blocked with CGP20712A at 300 nM, a concentration that blocks beta1ARs, but not beta2- or beta3ARs. Our results demonstrate that beta1ARs are located on the heart of early fetal mice and that beta1AR stimulation maintains fetal heart rate during hypoxia and mediates survival in vivo.", 
    "159": "Intensive exercise leads to a loss of force, which may be long lasting and associated with muscle cell damage. To simulate this impairment and to develop means of compensating the loss of force, extensor digitorum longus muscles from 4-wk-old rats were fatigued using intermittent 40-Hz stimulation (10 s on, 30 s off). After stimulation, force recovery, cell membrane leakage, and membrane potential were followed for 240 min. The 30-60 min of stimulation reduced tetanic force to approximately 10% of the prefatigue level, followed by a spontaneous recovery to approximately 20% in 120-240 min. Loss of force was associated with a decrease in K+ content, gain of Na+ and Ca2+ content, leakage of the intracellular enzyme lactic acid dehydrogenase (10-fold increase), and depolarization (13 mV). Stimulation of the Na+-K+ pump with either the beta2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol, epinephrine, rat calcitonin gene-related peptide (rCGRP), or dibutyryl cAMP improved force recovery by 40-90%. The beta-blocker propranolol abolished the effect of epinephrine on force recovery but not that of CGRP. Both spontaneous and salbutamol-induced force recovery were prevented by ouabain. The salbutamol-induced force recovery was associated with repolarization of the membrane potential (12 mV) to the level measured in unfatigued muscles. In conclusion, in muscles exposed to fatiguing stimulation leading to a considerable loss of force, cell leakage, and depolarization, stimulation of the Na+-K+ pump induces repolarization and improves force recovery, possibly due to the electrogenic action of the Na+-K+ pump. This mechanism may be important for the restoration of muscle function after intense exercise.",

In the present study, we studied the acute effects of the imidazoline-receptor agonist moxonidine on haemodynamics, NA (noradrenaline) kinetics and myocardial metabolism. Fifteen patients with CHF (chronic heart failure) were randomized to a single dose of 0.6 mg of sustained-release moxonidine or matching placebo. Haemodynamics, NA kinetics and myocardial metabolism were studied over a 2.5 h time period. There was a significant reduction in pulmonary and systemic arterial pressures, together with a decrease in cardiac index in the moxonidine group. Furthermore, there was a simultaneous reduction in systemic and cardiac net spillover of NA in the moxonidine group. Analysis of myocardial consumption of substrates in the moxonidine group showed a significant increase in non-esterified fatty acid consumption and a possible trend towards an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption compared with the placebo group (P=0.16). We conclude that a single dose of moxonidine (0.6 mg) in patients already treated with a beta-blocker reduced cardiac and overall sympathetic activity. The finding of increased lipid consumption without decreased myocardial oxygen consumption indicates a lack of positive effects on myocardial metabolism under these conditions. We suggest this might be a reason for the failure of moxonidine to prevent deaths in long-term studies in CHF.",

This paper links up with two preceding surveys concerning beta-blockers--groups of chiral agents and presents a survey of the hitherto published enantioselective syntheses of (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of beta-blockers. In the group of arylaminoethanols, mainly selective reduction of prochiral ketones in the presence of metallic complexes is used in this type of synthesis. Enantiomerically pure beta-blockers of the aryloxyaminopropanol type are synthesized by means of a reaction of pertinent phenols with different chiral precursors, such as (R) and (S)-chloromethyloxirans, (S)-glycidoltosylate, (S)- or (R)-2,3-O-isopropylideneglyceroltosylate, E-(2S,3S)-3-trimethylsilylglycidol and (S)-3-terc-butyl-5-phenyl-oxazolidine-5-ylmethanol.
