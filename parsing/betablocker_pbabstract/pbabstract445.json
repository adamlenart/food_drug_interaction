    "4": "Interactions between (-)-isoproterenol and DOPA on the release of endogenous noradrenaline (NA) evoked by electrical field stimulation (2 Hz, alternative polarity) were studied in rat superfused hypothalamic slices in the presence of 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine, an inhibitor of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, and cocaine. Isoproterenol (0.3-3 nM) facilitated the NA release in a concentration-dependent manner, while 10 pM L-DOPA alone produced no effect. This facilitation at 0.3-3 nM was potentiated by 20-70% by simultaneously applied 10 pM L-DOPA but that at 3 nM was not modified by 10 pM D-DOPA. This potentiation of the isoproterenol (3 nM)-induced facilitation of the NA release was concentration-dependent at 1-10 pM of L-DOPA. L-DOPA methyl ester (1 nM) antagonized the L-DOPA (10 pM)-induced potentiation of the facilitation of the NA release by 3 nM isoproterenol to a level of the facilitation by isoproterenol alone, whereas 10 nM (-) propranolol antagonized both the facilitation by isoproterenol alone and its potentiation by L-DOPA to a control level. Picomolar concentrations of L-DOPA stereoselectively act on a recognition site for itself, and then potentiate activities of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors to facilitate the NA release from rat hypothalamic slices.", 
    "5": "Left kidneys obtained from male Wistar rats were perfused with Tyrode solution; the perfusion pressure was measured continuously and taken as an index of vascular resistance in the kidneys. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; 3-50 nmol) caused dose-dependent dilator responses in kidneys preconstricted with noradrenaline (0.6 microM) and pretreated with ritanserin (10 nM) and ICS 205930 (10 nM). The 5-HT1 agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT; 16-64 nmol) also caused renal dilatations under similar conditions. The dilator responses to both 5-HT and 5-CT were antagonized by the non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist metergoline (0.2 microM) and by the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist BMY 7378 (0.4 microM). The guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue (30 microM) and the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; 100 microM) significantly attenuated the dilator responses to 5-HT and 5-CT. The 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.5-16 nmol) also caused dose-dependent dilator responses in preconstricted rat kidneys. These responses were antagonized by metergoline and BMY 7378 and significantly attenuated by the NO inhibitors hemoglobin (10 microM) and L-NNA. The renal dilator responses noted with the beta-adrenoceptor blocker tertatolol (1-32 nmol) were also antagonized by metergoline and BMY 7378 and significantly reduced by L-NNA and hemoglobin. Both 8-OH-DPAT and tertatolol (1-30 microM) significantly reduced the vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II (20 pmol). Our data indicate that 5-HT receptors located on the vascular endothelium of the renal circulation are involved in the dilator actions of 5-HT, 5-CT, 8-OH-DPAT and tertatolol, and suggest that these receptors resemble the 5-HT1A subtype.", 
    "6": "The two enantiomers of metoprolol and the four enantiomeric forms of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol were separated by liquid chromatography on a Chiralcel OD column containing a cellulose tris(3,5-dimethyl-phenylcarbamate) chiral stationary phase. The column efficiency was strongly dependent on the flow-rate and the enantioselectivity was influenced by temperature. Of utmost importance for the chiral separation was the water content of the mobile organic phase. The separation system was used for the separation and determination of the enantiomers in plasma and urine samples. The metoprolol enantiomers could be determined by fluorescence down to 10 nmol/l of each in plasma with a relative standard deviation of less than 15%.", 
    "7": "Electrical stimulation at C4-C7 in the spinal canal of pithed guinea-pigs injected with atropine, d-tubocurarine and pentolinium caused frequency-dependent bronchoconstriction. Such non-cholinergic responses to electrical stimulation, unlike responses to substance P, were abolished by pretreatment with capsaicin but not by mepyramine or propranolol. Bronchoconstrictor responses to electrical stimulation were inversely related to rectal temperature (between 30-40 degrees C) whereas responses to substance P increased with increasing temperature over the same range. Ouabain (i.v.) augmented responses to electrical stimulation at 35-37 degrees C but depressed those at 30-32 degrees C. Both morphine and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist B-HT920 (i.v.) inhibited non-cholinergic-mediated bronchoconstrictor responses at 30-32 degrees C. These results stress the importance of adequate control of body temperature in this preparation. Lowered body temperature may increase neuronal output of neuropeptides whilst depressing bronchial smooth muscle sensitivity. The data support previous conclusions regarding the role of Na+/K+ activated ATPase in temperature-induced changes in sensitivity to bronchoconstrictor stimuli.",

Immediate intravenous beta-blocker therapy had no important effect on hemorrhagic events when compared with delayed beta-blocker therapy. Intracranial hemorrhages were more frequent among patients treated with the 150-mg rt-PA dose than with the 100-mg rt-PA dose (2.1% versus 0.5%, P less than 0.001). The extent of the plasmin-mediated hemostatic defect was also greater in patients receiving the 150-mg dose.",

    "15": "The immediate and short-term (2 week) hemodynamic and humoral effects of the beta-1 antagonist, beta-2 agonist, celiprolol, were compared with those of more prolonged atenolol therapy in 12 patients with essential hypertension. Celiprolol produced an immediate dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial pressure (113 +/- 3 to 102 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) and total peripheral resistance (49 +/- 3 to 38 +/- 1 U/m2; p less than 0.005) that was associated with an increased heart rate (67 +/- 1 to 73 +/- 2 beats/min; p less than 0.01) and cardiac index (2,347 +/- 129 to 2,708 +/- 111 ml/min/m2; p less than 0.01). Both celiprolol and atenolol reduced mean arterial pressure with short-term treatment (p less than 0.01); this was associated with a reduced total peripheral resistance with celiprolol (from 24 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 1 U/m2; p less than 0.02) and was not observed with atenolol. Moreover, in contrast with atenolol, celiprolol did not change heart rate or stroke and cardiac indexes. Splanchnic and forearm vascular resistances decreased with celiprolol (p less than 0.05) but not with atenolol; neither beta-blocking drug altered renal blood flow. These results demonstrate that the hemodynamic effects of celiprolol were strikingly different from atenolol; celiprolol reduced arterial pressure and total peripheral and certain vascular resistances without altering heart rate, cardiac index or regional blood flows. These effects may be explained by celiprolol's cardiac beta-1 receptor inhibitory and peripheral beta-2 receptor agonistic effects.", 
    "16": "Previous studies have shown that differences in subtype-specific ligand binding between alpha 2 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors are largely determined by the seventh hydrophobic domain. Here, we report that a single amino acid substitution (Phe412----Asn) in the seventh hydrophobic domain of the alpha 2 adrenergic receptor reduces affinity for the alpha 2 antagonist yohimbine by 350-fold and increases affinity for beta antagonist alprenolol by 3000-fold. The affinity of this mutant receptor alpha 2F----N for several alpha and beta adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists was determined. Beta adrenergic receptor antagonists containing an oxygen atom linking the amino side chain with the aromatic ring bound to alpha 2F----N with high affinity, while the beta receptor antagonist sotalol, which lacks this oxygen, bound with low affinity. These data suggest that the Asn residue is involved in conferring specificity for binding to a specific class of beta receptor antagonists.", 
    "17": "The effect of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol on guanine nucleotide-dependent phospholipase C (PLC) activity was examined in turkey erythrocyte membranes prepared from [3H]inositol-labeled turkey erythrocytes. In the presence of guanosine 5'-(gamma-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[S]) isoproterenol caused a dose-dependent stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate ([3H]InsP) formation. The activation of PLC by GTP[S] occurred after an initial lag period of 1-2 min and was followed by a sustained rate of [3H]InsP formation which remained linear for 4-5 min. Isoproterenol decreased the lag period for GTP[S]-induced [3H]InsP formation and increased PLC activity at all time points following this lag. Consequently, isoproterenol shifted the dose-response curve for GTP[S] to the left (10-fold) and increased the maximal response. The EC50 value for isoproterenol-induced activation of PLC was 104 +/- 17 nM. Isoproterenol also potentiated GTP-dependent PLC activity but was ineffective in stimulating the enzyme in the presence of AIF4-. The PLC activation by isoproterenol was completely inhibited by propanolol and atenolol but was unaffected by prazosin or yohimbine. Although GTP[S] and isoproterenol could increase cAMP formation in this membrane preparation, the isoproterenol-induced stimulation of PLC occurred in the absence of ATP and was independent of cAMP formation. Furthermore, addition of cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, forskolin, or either the regulatory or catalytic subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase failed to stimulate [3H]InsP formation and had no effect on the responses elicited by GTP[S] and isoproterenol. Isoproterenol also stimulated [3H]InsP2 and [3H]InsP3 production in intact erythrocytes. Cholera toxin had no effect on [3H]InsP formation in the intact cells under conditions where it stimulated cAMP accumulation. In addition, the activation of PLC by GTP[S] and isoproterenol was unaffected in membranes prepared from cholera toxin-treated erythrocytes. These data demonstrate that stimulation of turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptors by isoproterenol results in a direct activation of guanine nucleotide-dependent PLC.",

    "22": "Patients exposed to beta-adrenergic blockers or with asthma comprised 39% (19 of 49) of reactors, compared to 16% (13 of 83) of matched controls (odds ratio, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.45 to 8.15; P = 0.005). Exposure to beta-blockers was 27% among reactors and 12% in matched controls (odds ratio, 2.67; CI, 1.01 to 7.05; P = 0.036). Asthma was found in 12% of reactors and 4% of controls; after correction for beta-blocker use, asthma was also associated with increased risk for anaphylactoid reaction (odds ratio, 4.54; CI, 1.03 to 20.05; P = 0.046). Compared with nonasthmatic patients not taking beta-blockers, asthmatic patients were at greater risk for anaphylactoid reaction with bronchospasm (P = 0.02). Five of 13 reactors receiving beta-blockers became hypotensive, and three needed hospitalization. Compared with nonasthmatic patients not taking beta-blockers, patients exposed to beta-blocking drugs were almost nine times (odds ratio, 8.7; CI, 0.81 to 93.5; P = 0.075) more likely to be hospitalized after an anaphylactoid reaction.",

The effect of this treatment on blood pressure and heart rate was investigated at rest and under standardized ergometric conditions, and by means of a 24 h Holter ECG. The frequency of angina pectoris episodes in 6-week periods was reduced by 34% over 6 months. The initial decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (by 25%) was maintained over the long term at rest and under exercise. Patient exercise tolerance with reduced oxygen utilization, as represented by the product of pressure x rate, showed a lasting improvement. After 6 months, monotopic ventricular premature beats in particular were reduced significantly (46%) as compared with the initial situation.", 
    "25": "Clinical evidence suggests different actions of amphetamine (AMPH) in children and adults. Using intracellular recording techniques, the actions of AMPH at 10 and 40 microM were investigated in granule neurons of hippocampal slices from pre- and postpubertal rats. AMPH (10-40 microM) caused depolarization of most postpubertal neurons, often with increased spontaneous activity, whereas most prepubertal neurons were hyperpolarized. In both age groups, AMPH caused increased neuronal excitability by reducing spike threshold, attenuating the postspike train afterhyperpolarization, reducing spike frequency adaptation, and potentiating excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Changes in cell input resistance were variable and Ca2+ currents were unaffected. AMPH actions took 10-15 min to appear and became maximal 30-55 min after application. The effects were reversible at 10 microM, but at 40 microM, prolonged washout for up to 2 h did not completely reverse these actions. The beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, partially blocked AMPH actions. The dopamine (D2) blocker, haloperidol, did not block AMPH actions. Mature neurons were also tested with 2.5 microM AMPH showing similar but more reversible effects as the higher concentrations. Depleting catecholamines by reserpine partly attenuated the effects of 40 microM AMPH in mature neurons. Perfusion of neurons with 10 and 20 microM cocaine did not produce effects similar to those of AMPH. It is suggested that AMPH produces its effects on granule neurons only in part through the release of norepinephrine. The involvement of other neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators released by AMPH, or direct postsynaptic actions of AMPH are also possible.", 
    "26": "After 4 weeks on placebo, 90 hypertensive patients (37 men, 53 women, mean age 55 years) with systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures of 162/99 and 165/100 mmHg respectively received double-blind treatment with either rilmenidine 1 mg/day or atenolol 50 mg/day. This treatment was given alone for 8 weeks, with possible DBP greater than or equal to 90 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day was added between the 9th and 12th weeks of treatment. At week 13 all treatments were replaced by placebo. Both groups were similar at randomisation, and both treatments were similarly effective: after 8 weeks of monotherapy with rilmenidine or atenolol, the SBP/DBP had decreased by -18/-13 mmHg and by -21/-15 mmHg respectively, and the proportion of patients with normalised blood pressure (SBP/DBP less than or equal to 160/90 mmHg) was 66 percent and 65 percent. Effectiveness was maintained at 12 weeks, when less than 20 percent of the patients had taken hydrochlorothiazide. Both drugs were well tolerated clinically and electrocardiographically. There was a significantly greater decrease in heart rate on atenolol than on rilmenidine. Eleven patients (5 on rilmenidine, 6 on atenolol) dropped out of the trial, 2 and 3 patients in the respective groups on account of side-effects. Laboratory tests showed that the HDL-cholesterol level significantly decreased on atenolol and remained stable on rilmenidine (P less than 0.01), whereas the LDL-cholesterol level was stable on atenolol and decreased on rilmenidine (P less than 0.05). No rebound in blood pressure was observed on discontinuation of both treatments. This study shows that rilmenidine administered as first-line treatment is as effective as atenolol in lowering blood pressure, and it confirms that this drug is clinically and biochemically well tolerated.", 
    "27": "Isoprenaline produced concentration-dependent contractions of the in vitro canine saphenous vein which were attenuated by phentolamine (10(-6) M) and pacing-induced heart failure. Both at control and peak heart failure, a biphasic response was seen in the dorsal pedal artery, consisting of an initial relaxation followed by a contraction; phentolamine and heart failure enhanced the relaxation component. In the presence of propranolol, the isoprenaline-induced contraction was sensitive to yohimbine, but resistant to prazosin. Therefore it is concluded that isoprenaline interacts not only with vascular beta-adrenoceptors, but also with alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Endothelial denudation resulted in a diminished response to isoprenaline in control saphenous vein and dorsal pedal artery but not in vessels from dogs with heart failure. The observation that the contractile response to isoprenaline diminishes in heart failure implies a specific down-regulation of peripheral vascular alpha 2-adrenoceptors.",

No significant difference in the effect on heart rate and adverse reactions has been noted. Acebutolol did not change lipid metabolism parameters whereas propranolol slightly but statistically significantly increased serum triglycerides.", 
    "29": "Traditional beta-blocking eye drops preserved with benzalkonium chloride show an adverse effect on the precorneal tear film, which can be measured by checking the break-up-time (BUT). To decide, whether this adverse effect is caused more by the beta-blocking drug or the preservative, we tested the influence of timolol eye drops without preservative in single dose units Timosine) on the BUT in a prospective, open study. These eyedrops caused no significant shortening of the BUT in persons, which where untreated before. Patients using preserved beta-blocking eye drops and having irritations of their eyes showed significant prolongation of the BUT after changing the therapy to Timosine. Preservative-free beta-blocking eye drops are a real improvement in the therapy of glaucoma patients with irritated eyes.", 
    "30": "It was reported that 8-Hydroxycarteolol (8-OH CA), the major metabolite of carteolol hydroxychloride (CA), has a slightly different pharmacological effect from CA. We studied the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) on a single eyedrop application of 8-OH CA in albino and pigmented rabbit eyes. To determine the characteristic of 8-OH CA and CA, we investigated the binding ability of these drugs to synthetic melanin. In the present study, topically applied 2% CA did not significantly decrease IOP in albino and pigmented rabbit eyes. Topically applied 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 1.0% 8-OH CA significantly decreased the IOP of albino rabbit as did 0.1 and 1.0% 8-OH to pigmented rabbit eyes. The maximum reduction of IOP was 3.5 +/- 0.33 mmHg (mean +/- SEM) in albino rabbit and 3.0 +/- 0.45 mmHg (mean +/- SEM) in pigmented rabbit. Maximum IOP reduction was obtained after 30 min. from topical application in albino rabbit, but in pigmented rabbit after 1 hour or later. Our binding studies to melanin show that the melanin binding ability is less for 8-OH CA than for CA at any concentrations. These results may indicate that lower concentrations of topically applied 8-OH CA profoundly reduce IOP compared to CA, and 8-OH CA has less effect on melanin than CA.", 
    "31": "Hypertension may influence the atherosclerotic process of large arteries via pressure and shear forces. The pressure force dilates and stiffens arteries because of the non-linear elastic behaviour of arterial walls. This partly explains the increased diameter and decreased compliance of the brachial artery in hypertensive subjects compared with normotensive controls. However, pressure lowering by antihypertensive drugs does not always reverse large artery alterations indicating that other mechanisms are involved. Reversal of low compliance obtained with certain antihypertensive drugs is generally concomitant with large artery vasodilation, suggesting that smooth muscle relaxation plays a major role in the compliance response to drugs. Atherosclerosis associated with hypertension also causes additional loss of compliance and creates a vicious circle of sclerosis development by accelerating the biophysical fatigue of bioelastomers. Hypertension may contribute to atherogenesis by means of wall shear stress which is the frictional force exerted by the circulating blood column on the intima of arteries. Since it is likely that atherosis lesions may develop preferentially in low shear conditions, hypertension may promote the haemodynamic conditions of atherogenesis at the blood-wall interface. The response of wall shear to antihypertensive treatment is not unequivocal. For example, the beta-blocker, atenolol, does not change shear whereas carteolol increases shear rate and stress and these effects are closely related to change in platelet-free calcium concentration. This finding is consistent with the effect of shear forces on cell permeability to calcium demonstrated in vitro and points to the crucial role of wall shear as a biophysical signal capable of modifying the endothelial structure and function of arteries.", 
    "32": "Previous studies have shown that 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is able to enhance melatonin secretion from rat pineal glands. The effect of another psoralen, 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP) on plasma melatonin concentrations alone or in combination with isoproterenol (Iso, 10 mg/kg BW, i.p.) or propranolol (Prop, 20 mg/kg BW, s.c.) was studied in the rat. An increase in plasma melatonin concentrations was observed 1 h after psoralen administration and lasted 8 h. The stimulatory effect of 5-MOP on circulating melatonin concentrations was dose dependent above 5-mg/kg, BW. 5-MOP also potentiated the Iso-induced rise in plasma melatonin levels. Furthermore, Prop did not block the effect of 5-MOP, indicating that the psoralen acts independently of the noradrenergic system controlling pineal melatonin synthesis. No increase in plasma melatonin levels was observed in pinealectomized (Px) animals after injection of 5-MOP (20 mg/kg BW) or 8-MOP (20 mg/kg BW). This demonstrates that the rise in plasma melatonin concentrations observed after treatment requires the presence of the pineal gland, and that neither 5-MOP nor 8-MOP stimulates melatonin release from other structures such as the retina or Harderian gland.", 
    "33": "Ventricular arrhythmia suppression trials were performed to compare the efficacies and side effects of disopyramide and mexiletine used alone and in combination, and to compare the efficacies and side effects of mexiletine and propranolol used alone and in combination, in patients with chronic ventricular premature contractions (VPCs, greater than or equal to 3000 beats/day). The study on the combination of disopyramide and mexiletine included 26 patients (19 men and 7 women). Disopyramide 100 mg tid or mexiletine 150 mg tid was administered as single-drug therapy, and disopyramide 50 mg plus mexiletine 100 mg tid was administered as combination therapy. Each patient underwent Holter monitoring during four different periods: baseline, disopyramide alone, mexiletine alone, and combination therapy. The mean number of VPCs/hr at baseline was 796 +/- 522 (mean +/- SD), which was significantly decreased with all three therapies (p less than 0.01 in each) to a) 415 +/- 480 with disopyramide alone, b) 341 +/- 368 with mexiletine alone, and c) 345 +/- 408 with the combination therapy. The number of patients demonstrating a significant reduction in VPCs (greater than or equal to 75%) and the elimination of ventricular tachycardia (VT; three or more consecutive VPCs) did not differ significantly among the three therapies.

Intraoperative baseline PP was 7.3 mm of Hg (+/- 1.7 SD). Portal pressure was significantly increased throughout portal vein occlusion, but returned to baseline values 2 minutes after release of the ligature. Central venous pressure was significantly decreased throughout portal vein occlusion, but did not differ significantly from baseline values 3 minutes after release of the portal vein ligature. Portal pressure increased significantly (8 +/- 3.3 mm of Hg) over baseline values after application of an abdominal bandage; however, CVP did not change significantly. During postoperative monitoring, CVP and PP did not change significantly from respective 18-hour mean postoperative values in resting dogs. At 60 and 75 minutes after surgery, heart rate was significantly increased over the 18-hour mean. Portal pressure and CVP, respectively, were significantly increased over intraoperative baseline values in the first hour and the first 8 hours after surgery. Postoperative CVP and HR were significantly correlated. Individual measurements of PP in dogs that were abdominal pressing during barking or defecation were significantly increased (9 +/- 3 mm of Hg) above measurements taken after cessation of abdominal press. Portal pressure measurements in standing dogs decreased 7.5 +/- 2 mm of Hg, compared with measurements of the same dog in lateral recumbency.

The present studies extend our previous reports by demonstrating that there is also a deficit of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the motor cortex but not in the somatosensory cortex. In addition, we have shown that a deficit of 5-HT1A receptors in the motor and somatosensory cortices contributes to the deficit of total 5-HT1 receptors. In contrast, we did not observe any changes in the binding to 5-HT1B receptors in these cortical regions from the 19-day-old offspring of ethanol-fed rats. The present studies also examined the effects of in utero ethanol exposure on the early development of the serotonergic system. The results of these studies demonstrated a deficit of 5-HT and/or 5-HIAA in the brain stem as early as the 15th day of gestation (G15) and in the cortex as early as G19. In addition, we demonstrated a delay in both the normal developmental decline of 5-HT1A receptors in the brain stem and in the acquisition of cortical 5-HT1A receptors.

Left ventricular time activity curves were constructed using computer technique. We obtained changes of hemodynamic parameters such as endodiastolic volume, systemic vascular resistance and ejection fraction. The peak filling rate (PFR), and filling rate in the first third of the diastolic period (1/3 FR) were used as the indexes of LV diastolic filling. 1/3 FR remained unchanged during peak exercise by the patients, while it increased significantly in normal controls. After administration of ISDN and nifedipine, 1/3 FR increased significantly during peak exercise by the patients. Especially after nifedipine, 1/3 FR improved significantly compared with the improvement after ISDN, although these two drugs had the same effects on systolic function. These findings showed that 1/3 FR was reliable as an indicator of LV diastolic filling in ischemic heart disease, and nifedipine improved LV diastolic filling not only by improving ischemic changes in myocardium but also by it's direct effect on left ventricular relaxation.",

Preoperative blood pressure was well controlled with an alpha.beta blocker, amosulalol hydrochloride 40 mg per day po for 2 weeks. The patient received midazolam 2.5 mg im and scopolamine 0.4 mg im 60 minutes before induction. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam 5 mg iv, fentanyl 0.1 mg iv and vecuronium 12 mg iv, and maintained with continuous epidural infusion of 1.5% lidocaine, and inhalation of 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen and sevoflurane (0.5-3%). Blood pressure was controlled with nicardipine (1-6 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) before removal of the pheochromocytoma. After removal of the tumor blood pressure was maintained with intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer's solution, dopamine (3-8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), dobutamine (3-8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and norepinephrine (0.1-0.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). A combination of continuous epidural block and sevoflurane anesthesia was very useful for removal of the pheochromocytoma. Swan-Ganz catheter monitoring was also very useful before and during operation to determine the optimal doses of nicardipine, catecholamine and the volume of transfusion.", 
    "40": "When disposition is monoexponential, extravascular concentration-time (C, t) data yield both disposition and absorption parameters, the latter via the Wagner-Nelson method or deconvolution which are equivalent. Classically, when disposition is multiexponential, disposition parameters are obtained from intravenous administration and absorption data are obtained from extravascular C, t data via the Loo-Riegelman or Exact Loo-Riegelman methods or via deconvolution. Thus, in multiexponential disposition one assumes no intrasubject variation in disposition, a hypothesis that has not been proven for most drugs. Based on the classical two- and three-compartment open models with central compartment elimination, and using postabsorptive extravascular C, t data only, we have developed four equations to estimate k10 when disposition is biexponential and two other equations to estimate k10 when disposition is triexponential. The other disposition rate constants are readily obtained without intravenous data. We have analyzed extravascular data of flurbiprofen (12 sets), mesoridazine (20 sets), flunarizine (5 sets), labetalol (9 sets), and diazepam (4 sets). In the case of diazepam intravenous C, t data were also available for analysis. After disposition parameters had been estimated from the extravascular data the Exact Loo-Riegelman method with the Proost modification was applied to the absorptive extravascular data to obtain AT/VP as a function of time. These latter data for each subject and each drug studied were found to be fitted by a function indicating either simple first-order absorption, two consecutive first-order processes, or zero-order absorption. After absorption and disposition parameters had been estimated, for each set of extravascular data analyzed, a reconstruction trend line through the original C, t data was made. The new methods allow testing of the hypothesis of constancy of disposition with any given drug. There is also a need for new methods of analysis since the majority of drugs have no marketed intravenous formulation, hence the classical methods cannot be applied.",

    "46": "Upon engagement of chemoattractant receptors, neutrophils generate inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DG) by means of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) which is regulated by a GTP-binding protein(s). We have previously reported (Reibman, J., H. M. Korchak, L. B. Vosshall, K. A. Haines, A. M. Rich, and G. Weissmann. 1988. J. Biol. Chem. 263:6322-6328) a biphasic rise in DG after exposure of neutrophils to the chemoattractant FMLP: a rapid (less than or equal to 15 s) phase (\"triggering\") and a slow (greater than or equal to 30 s) phase (\"activation\"). These derive from distinct intracellular lipid pools. To study the source of rapid and slow DG, we have used a unique probe, protein I, a porin that is the major outer membrane protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Treatment of neutrophils with protein I inhibits exocytosis and homotypic cell adhesion provoked by FMLP without inhibiting assembly of the NADPH oxidase responsible for O2-. generation. DG turnover in PMN labeled with [3H]arachidonate and [14C]glycerol was profoundly altered by protein I. Whereas the rapid peak of DG was only modestly diminished (FMLP vs. FMLP plus protein I = DG labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid (3H-a.a.-DG): 142 +/- 14% SEM vs. 125 +/- 22%; DG labeled with the glycerol backbone with [14C]glycerol (D-14C-G): 125 +/- 10% SEM vs. 107 +/- 8.5% SEM), the slow rise in both 3H-a.a.-DG and D-14C-G was essentially abolished. Moreover, treatment of neutrophils with 4-4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), which, like protein I, inhibits exocytosis without affecting O2-. generation also inhibited slow DG. However, protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (47phox, 66phox) were unaffected in the absence of slow DG. To determine the source of the slow DG, we have analyzed radiolabeled phospholipid (PL) turnover after FMLP +/- protein I (P.I.). Treatment of PMN with FMLP (0.1 microM) resulted in breakdown of phosphatidylcholine (PC), beginning at 30 s, and reaching a nadir at 60 s (3H-PC = 59 +/- 10.2% SEM of resting, 14C-PC = 57 +/- 6.4%). Protein I (0.25 microM) significantly inhibited PC turnover after FMLP ([3H]PC = 95 +/- 5.6% and [14C]PC = 86 +/- 8.4% of resting at 60 s), but failed to alter the metabolism of 3H- or 14C-phosphatidylinositol after FMLP (91 +/- 19.6 and 88 +/- 16.5% vs. 92 +/- 9.2 and 91 +/- 16% at 60 s).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "47": "The sequential use of different types of antiarrhythmic drugs may improve arrhythmia prognosis in chronic atrial fibrillation or flutter after successful electrical cardioversion. The rationale for serial treatment is that the arrhythmogenic mechanism may vary between patients, leading to different responses to 1 specific drug. To investigate this issue prospectively, 127 patients having chronic fibrillation or flutter exclusively, underwent serial drug treatment with flecainide (stage I) followed by sotalol or, if contraindicated, quinidine (stage II) and eventually amiodarone (stage III). Stages II and III were entered after electrical recardioversion for a recurrence during stages I or II, respectively. Calculated on an actuarial basis, the 2-year cumulative percentage of patients free of the arrhythmia increased from 31% after stage I to 63% at the end of serial treatment. To reach this result, a mean of 1.8 +/- 0.8 cardioversions per patient were needed, with 53 patients progressing to stage II and 34 to stage III. Sixteen patients stopped serial treatment prematurely and 15 patients were considered to have intractable atrial fibrillation at the end of stage III. Incidence of proarrhythmia was low. Multivariate analysis disclosed that an older age, in combination with a large number of previous episodes of arrhythmia, a long previous duration of arrhythmia and presence of mitral valve disease, were predictive for medical refractoriness during serial treatment. It is concluded that serial treatment may improve arrhythmia prognosis in atrial fibrillation or flutter, with an acceptable incidence of proarrhythmic events.", 
    "48": "Deliberate hypotension may induce secretion of stress hormones. In the present study, the effects of hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane or plasma renin activity, plasma concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline, vasopressin, and aldosterone were investigated in eight adult patients undergoing middle-ear surgery. The mean arterial pressure was 50 mmHg (6.7 kPa) during hypotension. Plasma renin activity rose significantly during anaesthesia before hypotension, being similar during hypotension and before hypotension, and in returned postoperatively to the initial level. Plasma adrenaline fell significantly during hypotension and rose after anaesthesia to the preanaesthetic level. Plasma noradrenaline rose slightly during hypotension and after anaesthesia, but not significantly. Plasma vasopressin rose significantly after anaesthesia. Plasma aldosterone increased slightly throughout the study, but not significantly during any phase. In conclusion, labetalol with isoflurane-induced hypotension seems to attenuate the stress response in these operations. During hypotension, plasma renin activity is not an essential compensatory mechanism, which antagonises the decrease of blood pressure. Plasma vasopressin has no role in regulating blood pressure during labetalol-induced hypotension.", 
    "49": "Dilevalol and labetalol are examples of a growing number of new beta-blockers which combine nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonism with vasodilator activity. Dilevalol is one of the 4 stereoisomers of labetalol, and is estimated to form approximately 25% of the racemic drug. Labetalol itself is an alpha 1-antagonist but dilevalol, which has negligible affinity for alpha-receptors, exerts its vasodilator effect via beta 2-agonism. Both drugs are rapidly and completely absorbed in 60 to 90 min and subject to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism; the average bioavailability after oral administration is around 20 to 35%, and there is wide interindividual variability in plasma drug concentrations and dosage requirements. The volume of distribution of dilevalol (17 to 25 L/kg) is higher than that reported for labetalol (3 to 16 L/kg), although both drugs are concentrated in the extravascular compartment. Correspondingly, the elimination half-life of dilevalol at steady-state is around 15h compared with 8h for labetalol. There is evidence that the pharmacokinetics of dilevalol change (a reduction in clearance) in translation from single-dose to long term therapy. There is no clinically significant effect of age on the steady-state disposition of either drug and the pharmacokinetics of labetalol appear to be unchanged during pregnancy. Although there is a linear relationship between dose and area under the concentration-time curve, early studies found no evidence of a simple relationship between dose or plasma drug concentration and the fall in blood pressure. However, an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model has been used to correlate concentrations of both drugs with reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in individuals. This approach derives a mathematical description of antihypertensive response which integrates pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information and also takes account of placebo effects and changes in drug concentration and blood pressure during the dosage interval. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of labetalol are characterised by a linear model. For example, in a group of healthy volunteers, the 'responsiveness' to labetalol was -0.19mm Hg/micrograms/L. In contrast, the relationships of dilevalol are best described by a Langmuir maximum effect model, and so individual responses to short and long term treatment have been quantified by the concentration-effect parameters of maximum effect and drug concentration required to produce 50% of this.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "50": "The efficacy of intravenously administered metoprolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was evaluated in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in 16 patients. The arrhythmias that were treated were atrial fibrillation (11 patients), atrial flutter (2 patients), supraventricular tachycardia (2 patients), and multifocal atrial tachycardia (1 patient). Mean dose of metoprolol was 9.5 mg (range: 2-15 mg) administered in one or two separate infusions of up to 7.5 mg each over a cumulative maximum interval of 25 minutes. In the 13 responders (81%), mean ventricular rate decreased from 134 +/- 6 to 106 +/- 7 beats/min 10 minutes after metoprolol administration and was controlled for 40 to 320 minutes without further therapy. Minimum ventricular rate (98 +/- 6 beats/min) was reached 48 minutes after initiation of metoprolol. Metoprolol reduced ventricular rate by greater than 15% (decrease of 26-60 beats/min) in 11 (69%) of 16 patients, including 9 (82%) of 11 patients with atrial fibrillation. In two other patients, one with atrial fibrillation and one with supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular rate was reduced by greater than 12%. Hypotension, occurring in five patients, was the most frequent side effect but was transient and readily managed. Cardioselective beta-adrenergic blockade by metoprolol was rapidly effective in controlling ventricular rate in a majority of patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and may be of particular use in selected patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in whom intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade is indicated. Hypotension is an important potential side effect.", 
    "51": "This study was carried out to determine the relative role of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors at the level of large epicardial and small resistance coronary arteries when sympathetic tone is increased by exercise. The responses of left circumflex coronary diameter and blood flow were examined at rest and during treadmill exercise in seven chronically instrumented dogs during control conditions (saline) and after propranolol administration (1 mg/kg) either alone or in combination with phentolamine (1.5 mg/kg). In control conditions, graded treadmill exercise (5, 10, and 12 km/h) resulted in a progressive increase in coronary artery diameter and decrease in coronary vascular resistance. After propranolol, coronary vascular resistance slightly increased at rest and then progressively decreased during exercise. Surprisingly, coronary artery diameter significantly decreased at rest as well as throughout the exercise period. Phentolamine significantly reduced the propranolol-induced effects on coronary arterial diameter but did not restore the exercise-induced dilation of the large coronary arteries observed during control conditions. In addition, phentolamine prevented the propranolol-induced increase in coronary vascular resistance at rest and reinforced the exercise-induced decrease in coronary vascular resistance observed under propranolol. Thus beta-adrenoceptors are essential in the mediation of exercise-induced dilation of large coronary arteries. In contrast, activation of beta-adrenoceptors is only partially responsible for the decrease in coronary vascular resistance during exercise. Finally, constriction of large coronary arteries after propranolol is mainly explained by the unmasking of alpha-adrenergic tone at rest, but other mechanisms are involved during exercise.", 
    "52": "Sensitivity to the hypotensive effect of propranolol differs between Chinese subjects and white subjects. To explore the pharmacodynamic explanation for this difference, eight Chinese subjects (age range, 25 to 42 years) and eight white subjects (age range, 22 to 36 years) were given single doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg propranolol on separate occasions at least 3 days apart. Heart rate, mean blood pressure, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and plasma renin activity were measured at the end of treadmill exercise 2 hours after medication was administered. Propranolol produced a concentration-dependent reduction in mean blood pressure and heart rate in both groups. Concentration-response curves were shifted significantly to the left in Chinese subjects, confirming the increased sensitivity to propranolol of the Chinese. The baseline exercise plasma renin activity was twofold higher (p less than 0.05) in Chinese than in white subjects. The sensitivity to beta-blockade-induced suppression of plasma renin activity was increased in the Chinese, which resulted in a sevenfold higher concentration being required in white subjects than in Chinese to produce the same 50% suppression of exercise plasma renin activity (84.8 +/- 23.2 versus 12.7 +/- 7.4 ng/ml, p less than 0.05). The reduction in exercise heart rate and mean blood pressure produced by propranolol were well correlated to the reduction in exercise plasma renin activity in both populations. There was no significant effect of either race or propranolol on plasma catecholamine concentration after exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "We have devised a simple method of determining the time course of the effects of timolol maleate on aqueous flow using changes in aqueous protein concentrations. Aqueous protein concentrations were measured with a laser flare-cell meter. First, the value of the coefficient of protein entry into the anterior chamber (kin) was determined in both eyes of 10 normal subjects. One week later, aqueous protein concentration changes were measured in both eyes of the same subjects before and after instillation of timolol in one eye. From these changes and the value of kin, changes in the aqueous flow rate were calculated using an equation formulating protein kinetics in the anterior chamber. Results of a separate experiment showed that instillation of topical timolol did not change the kin, justifying use of the kin as determined without considering timolol in the calculation. The calculated flow rate had a maximum decrease of 30% +/- 10% (mean +/- SEM, n = 10) 4 hours after instillation in treated eyes and of 10% +/- 6% 3 hours after instillation in fellow, untreated eyes.", 
    "54": "Using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, we attempted to find among L-dopa-related analogs a competitive antagonist against L-dopa-induced facilitation of impulse (2 Hz)-evoked endogenous norepinephrine (NE) release from rat hypothalamic slices. At the first screening in the presence of cocaine and 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015), a L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, L-dopa (1-100 nM) concentration-dependently facilitated NE release. L-dopa (1 microM) reduced NE release. D-dopa, L-phenylalanine, 3-O-methyl-dopa, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid or L-dopa-phosphate at 1 to 1000 nM, and carbidopa (1-10 nM), did not mimic L-dopa. L-dopa methyl ester (0.3-10 nM) concentration-dependently decreased NE release, suggesting that it is antagonistic, whereas L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (0.001-1 nM) concentration-dependently mimicked L-dopa. At the second screening in the additional presence of S-sulpiride, L-dopa (1-1000 nM) concentration-dependently facilitated NE release. Maximum effect was seen at 0.3 to 1 microM. Pretreatment with carbidopa (0.1-10 nM) or L-dopa phosphate (0.01-0.1 nM) was somewhat antagonistic. L-Dopa methyl ester (3-30 nM) in a concentration-dependent manner shifted the concentration-facilitation curve for L-dopa to the right: Schild plots gave a straight line with a slope of 1.00 and pA2 was 8.9, whereas l-propranolol (1-100 nM) concentration-dependently reduced maximal effect of L-dopa without rightward shift of the curve.

    "55": "Receptor-mediated agonists, such as FMLP, induce an early, phospholipase D (PLD)-mediated accumulation of phosphatidic acid (PA) which may play a role in the activation of NADPH oxidase in human PMN. We have determined the effect of changes in PA production on O2 consumption in intact PMN and the level of NADPH oxidase activity measured in a cell-free assay. Pretreatment of cells with various concentrations of propranolol enhanced (less than or equal to 200 microM) or inhibited (greater than 300 microM) PLD-induced production of PA (mass and radiolabel) in a manner that correlated with enhancement or inhibition of O2 consumption in PMN stimulated with 1 microM FMLP in the absence of cytochalasin B. The concentration-dependent effects of propranolol on FMLP-induced NADPH oxidase activation was confirmed by direct assay of the enzyme in subcellular fractions. In PA extracted from cells pretreated with 200 microM propranolol before stimulation with 1 microM FMLP, phospholipase A1 (PLA1)-digestion for 90 min, followed by quantitation of residual PA, showed that a minimum of 44% of PA in control (undigested) sample was diacyl-PA; alkylacyl-PA remained undigested by PLA1. Propranolol was also observed to have a concentration-dependent enhancement of mass of 1,2-DG formed in PMN stimulated with FMLP. DG levels reached a maximum at 300 microM propranolol and remained unchanged up to 500 microM propranolol. However, in contrast to PA levels, the level of DG produced did not correlate with NADPH oxidase activation. Exogenously added didecanoyl-PA activated NADPH oxidase in a concentration-dependent manner (1-300 microM) in a reconstitution assay using membrane and cytosolic fractions from unstimulated PMN. In addition, PA synergized with SDS for oxidase activation. Taken together, these results indicate that PA plays a second messenger role in the activation of NADPH oxidase in human PMN and that regulation of phospholipase D is a key step in the activation pathway.", 
    "56": "Circulating catecholamines are increased in cirrhosis with portal hypertension, and increase further after propranolol. In 23 cirrhotic patients, plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine were determined in an artery, the azygos vein, the right renal vein and a hepatic vein before and after an oral 80-mg dose of propranolol. Baseline azygos and renal venous norepinephrine levels were significantly higher than arterial norepinephrine levels (+20%, p less than 0.005; and +28%, p less than 0.001, respectively). Hepatic venous norepinephrine and all venous epinephrine values were below the arterial values (all p less than 0.05). After propranolol intake, arterial norepinephrine and epinephrine increased (+16%, p less than 0.01; and +93%, p less than 0.001, respectively). Significant increases in norepinephrine and epinephrine were found in azygos and renal veins (all p less than 0.01), whereas hepatic venous norepinephrine and epinephrine remained unchanged. Azygos and hepatic blood flow decreased after propranolol intake (-27%, p less than 0.05; and -16%, p less than 0.01, respectively). Azygos spillover of norepinephrine (an estimate of locally released norepinephrine delivered to the circulation) and clearance of epinephrine remained unaltered. Hepatointestinal clearance showed no significant change for norepinephrine, but showed a borderline-significant decrease for epinephrine (-23%, p = 0.08). Our results show a net production of norepinephrine in the prehepatic splanchnic area drained through superior portalsystemic collaterals and in the kidneys. The increase in circulating catecholamines after propranolol intake is probably due to a combination of further enhancement of sympathetic activity and a decrease in catecholamine degradation.",

Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to determine the effects of adrenergic drugs topically applied to the round window membrane of the cochlea. The relative influence of the various receptor types (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2) was examined by a selection of agonists and antagonists. The agonists norepinephrine and epinephrine, which have mixed alpha- and beta-receptor effects, and phenylephrine, a strong alpha 1-agonist, all induced a dose-dependent reduction in cochlear blood flow. The agonists isoproterenol (beta-active), salbutamol (alpha 2-active) had no effect on cochlear blood flow. Of the antagonists, when tested alone, only the selective alpha 1-antagonist prazosin had a direct effect on cochlear blood flow, demonstrating an increase in cochlear blood flow. The selective alpha 2-antagonist idazoxan, the beta-antagonist propranolol, and the unselective alpha-antagonist phentolamine had no effect on cochlear blood flow. Interaction studies of agonists and antagonists were performed to specifically define the receptor subclasses responsible for the cochlear blood flow increases with norepinephrine and epinephrine. The results are consistent with the presence of an alpha 1-adrenergic sympathetic control of cochlear blood flow.",

In group B (n = 5), metoprolol and 3H-metoprolol were administered in the same way, but at half the volume to study the influence of derived coronary venous pressure on the myocardial concentration of drug. In group C (n = 3), metoprolol was given retrogradely and saline solution was infused into the left anterior descending artery before induced death to wash out metoprolol from the coronary veins. To rule out a possible influence of the development of myocardial necrosis on drug distribution, metoprolol was retroinfused after 1 min of arterial occlusion in three pigs (group D). In group E (n = 5), metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) was infused anterogradely into the left anterior descending artery. Peak plasma concentration was significantly higher after intravenous infusion of metoprolol (1,188 +/- 503 nmol/liter) than after coronary venous infusion (417 +/- 155 nmol/liter; p less than 0.001). In groups A and B, the nonischemic myocardial concentration of metoprolol was 250 to 300 pmol/g, whether the drug was infused intravenously or into the coronary vein. Coronary venous retroinfusion, however, resulted in a substantial accumulation of metoprolol in the ischemic myocardium. In group A pigs, subendocardial myocardial concentration was 16,800 +/- 7,774, mid-myocardial 39,590 +/- 18,043 and subepicardial 57,143 +/- 29,030 pmol/g (mean +/- SE). The ischemic myocardial concentration in pigs from group B was somewhat less pronounced, probably secondary to a lower coronary venous pressure (15 +/- 3 mm Hg) with the lower volume of infusion (6.1 +/- 0.3 ml) in group B compared with 32 +/- 5 mm Hg with a 14 +/- 1 ml infusion in group A. Coronary artery anterograde administration resulted in myocardial ischemic and nonischemic zone drug concentrations similar to those observed after retroinfusion into the coronary vein. With both modes of administration, there was a transmyocardial gradient from a somewhat lower drug concentration in the subendocardium, toward an increasing level in the mid-myocardium, to the highest concentration in the subepicardial zone of the ischemic myocardium.

Doses ranged from 0.03-3 mg/kg for GHRP and from 1-30 micrograms/kg for GHRH. The dose-response curves for the two peptides were not parallel. GHRP had lower potency, but evoked a much higher peak GH response than GHRH (greater than 55 vs. 12 micrograms/L). Because one of the proposed mechanisms of action of GHRP is the inhibition of somatostatin (SS), we tested the effects of propranolol, which inhibits SS, on the GH responses to GHRH and GHRP. Propranolol was given at a dose of 14 micrograms/kg, iv, 10 min before the injection of saline, GHRH (10 micrograms/kg), or GHRP (1 mg/kg). GH responses to propranolol alone did not differ from those to placebo (peak, 6 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 2 micrograms/L). However, propranolol pretreatment doubled the GH responses to both GHRH and GHRP compared with those to GHRH or GHRP alone 28 +/- 5 micrograms/L vs. 14 +/- 5 (P less than 0.05) and 54 +/- 2 vs. 25 +/- 6 micrograms/L (P less than 0.001), respectively]. These results show that GHRP causes a potent dose-dependent release of GH in this primate species. Since GHRP can produce a greater maximal GH response than GHRH, mechanisms other than release of endogenous GHRH must be involved.", 
    "66": "Doppler echocardiography is an excellent tool to study the hemodynamic effects of cardiac drugs. Resting and exercise effects produced by metoprolol and allapinin on Doppler-derived measures of left ventricular (LV) performance were examined in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias. Seventeen patients underwent continuous wave Doppler examination from the suprasternal notch at rest and during each stage of a standard exercise protocol. The study was repeated following 3-4 days of treatment with metoprolol given in a daily dose of 200 mg. The hemodynamic effects of allapinin, 100 mg daily, were evaluated in the same manner in 8 patients. With metoprolol, all resting Doppler measurements were altered insignificantly and all Doppler--derived parameters of aortic flow (peak, velocity, mean acceleration, cardiac index and LV ejection force) were much lower at the maximum exercise. Allapinin failed to alter any Doppler measurements of aortic blood flow at rest or during the peak exercise.", 
    "67": "The clinical effects of Tenoric, a long-acting combined drug (atenolol and chlorthalidone in a tablet), were studied in 31 patients with Stages I and II hypertensive disease, by using echocardiography, daily automatic blood pressure monitoring, bicycle ergometry, measurements of plasma renin and aldosterone. The drug was found to be highly clinically effective in labile and sustained hypertension. When given once or twice a day, it makes it possible to reliably monitor blood pressure, improve hemodynamic parameters, as reflected by lower cardiac output and decreased peripheral vascular resistance, reduce the estimated mass of the left myocardium, alleviate a pressor response to exercise and enhance its tolerance, lower plasma renin levels. The side effects of the drug are minimal and include moderate bradycardia. Peripheral vasospasm and systemic weakness were observed in single cases. There were no atherogenic changes in lipid spectrum and disturbed glucose and uric acid metabolism during the drug therapy.", 
    "68": "Pronounced side effects develop in 20% of outpatients receiving chemotherapy for arterial hypertension. Complications arise more often upon administration of clophelin, reserpine, dopegyt and combined regimens. It is established that long-term outpatient treatment of hypertension stage II with clophelin and drug combinations in fixed doses of the components is not beneficial and is inferior to propranolol administration which can be used for many years without any damage to cholesterol and beta-lipoproteins serum levels.", 
    "69": "A random walk method for predicting percutaneous drug absorption pharmacokinetics was proposed. The profiles predicted by this method were compatible with those predicted by the analytical method. The random walk method is particularly useful for predicting complex processes such as repeated topical application of a drug. The amount of a drug released into skin from four therapeutic timolol patches was measured when the patches were serially applied for 2.5 h each on the same site of six healthy male volunteers. On the average, 33.2, 23.4, 15.1, and 16.5% of the applied dose was released into skin from the first, second, third, and fourth patches, respectively. This pattern was comparable with the predicted profiles (43.9, 30.2, 24.4, and 21.1%) of amounts of drug which were expected to be released from the first to fourth patches into skin, respectively. The estimation method for the normalized skin-capillary boundary clearance is also described and applied in examining the percutaneous absorption of timolol. The estimated value for this parameter was much greater than the diffusion parameter, indicating that the removal process of timolol by the local circulation is much faster than the diffusion process through skin.", 
    "70": "Growth hormone (GH) response to standardized exercise, L-DOPA/propranolol and a 6-h diurnal GH profile (GHP) were evaluated in twenty-three children with very short stature and abnormal growth velocities. Standardized exercise (Jones Stage I) was performed on a cycle ergometer at 53% of the maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) for 20 min. VO2max was determined by an incremental progressive workload until exhaustion. The mean +/- SEM peak GH concentration (ng/ml) for each test was: exercise, 8.7 +/- 1.3; L-DOPA/P: 12.8 +/- 1.9 and GHP: 3 +/- 0.7. There was no statistical difference between exercise and L-DOPA/P peaks but both peaks were significantly higher than the peak observed during the profile. During exercise 14 of 23 patients had a GH response greater than 8 ng/ml. Two patients were found to be GH deficient. Therefore 16 of 23 patients (86%) had a result concordant with their final diagnosis. During the L-DOPA/P test 17 of 23 patients had a GH response greater than 8 ng/ml. By contrast only 6 of 23 patients had a positive response during GHP. Standardized exercise is as effective as L-DOPA/P as a stimulation test for growth hormone response in very short children with abnormal growth velocities. Exercise has the advantages of being physiological, having minimal side effects, and requiring fewer blood samples. In this population of children, exercise and L-DOPA/propranolol are significantly better than the 6-h growth hormone profile for assessing GH secretion.", 
    "71": "The role of adrenergic and cholinergic mediators in phospholipid secretion by gastric mucosal cells maintained in the presence of [3H]choline was investigated. The secretion of [3H]choline phospholipids over 30 min period averaged 1.98% of the total cellular labeled phospholipids in the absence of any mediator, and was enhanced by beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, to a greater extent than the cholinergic agonist, pilocarpine. A 2-fold increase in phospholipid secretion was achieved with isoproterenol, while pilocarpine evoked 1.3-fold increase. The stimulatory effect of isoproterenol was inhibited by alprenolol and that of pilocarpine by atropine. The phospholipids secreted in response to isoproterenol exhibited a 30% decrease in lysophosphatidylcholine, while 2.1-fold enrichment in this phospholipid occurred with pilocarpine. The results, for the first time, demonstrate the involvement of neural mediators in the regulation of phospholipid secretion in gastric mucus.", 
    "72": "The effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on the exercise-induced hyperlactatemia (Lap) have been studied in 31 adult male subjects [age: 25 +/- 1 years; body weight: 69 +/- 1 kg; VO2max: 54 +/- 1 ml O2.kg-1.min-1 (mean values +/- SEM)] randomly divided in 3 groups. All exercises were performed on a 10% inclined treadmill. In group 1 (n = 11), the subjects were walking during 20 minutes at 5 km.h-1 (55.6 +/- 1.4% VO2max). In group 2 (n = 10), they were running during 9 minutes at 8 km.h-1 (79.4 + 1.5% VO2max). The subjects of the third group (n = 10) were submitted to a 4 minutes run at 9.5 km.h-1 92 +/- 1.6% VO2max). These exercises were performed 1 hour after ingestion of a placebo or a single dose of 40 mg propranolol, in a double-blind randomized order. Blood samples were drawn at regular time intervals from an antecubital vein. Exercise tachycardia was reduced by about 20% (P less than 0.001) by propranolol in each group. Lap was significantly reduced by 15% by propranolol (P less than 0.005) at the lowest exercise intensity (55.6% VO2max), remained unchanged at 79.4% VO2max and was significantly enhanced by 16% during the recovery period following the run at 92% VO2max. These results clearly showed that the effects of acute beta-adrenergic blockade on Lap depend on exercise intensity.", 
    "73": "A patient with long QT syndrome was treated with beta blockers and had a permanent DDD pacemaker implanted. The lower rate was set to 85 beats/min because this provided the best shortening of QT interval at the lowest paced heart rate. The atrioventricular (AV) delay was programmed to 250 msec to allow native AV conduction. Patient returned complaining of symptoms suggestive of pacemaker syndrome. ECG during one of these episodes showed AV sequential pacing. Doppler echocardiography of hepatic vein flow suggested atrial contraction against a closed tricuspid valve. Endocardial electrogram telemetry demonstrated ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction with the retrograde atrial electrogram falling within the atrial refractory period and thus was not sensed. The following atrial stimulus did not capture because of the atrial refractoriness. Ventricular pacing proceeded after the programmed AV delay. Reprogramming the AV delay to 200 msec restored AV synchrony by allowing the atrial stimulus to capture by placing it outside of the refractory period of the atrium. No further symptoms reported during six months of follow-up.", 
    "74": "Norepinephrine (NE) concentration of parotid and submandibular glands of young rats was reduced 51% and 39%, respectively at 1 h, and 60% and 47% at 2 h after i.p. administration of a single dose (500 mg/kg body weight) of the anti-tumor agent, cyclocytidine (CC). For adult rats, the reductions were 44% and 46%, respectively, at 1 h and 54% and 49% at 2 h. This decrease from controls was generally similar to the decrease induced following 1 and 2 h of electrical stimulation (square wave pulses of 4 V, 5 ms duration, and frequency of 16 Hz) of the sympathetic innervation to these glands (young rats, 59% and 58% at 1 h; 66% and 63% at 2 h; for adult rats, 51% and 55% at 1 h and 69% and 53% at 2 h for parotid and submandibular, respectively). The changes in density of beta-adrenoceptors induced by direct nerve stimulation also corresponded to the changes induced by CC (CC induced a decrease in parotid of 12%, compared with a decrease of 11% with electrical stimulation; a 15% and 18% reduction in number of beta-adrenoceptors of submandibular gland was found at 1 h after CC and electrical stimulation, respectively). Compelling evidence for the mechanism of CC action was thus established, showing that CC mimics effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation (inducing reduction in NE concentration and transient change in beta-adrenoceptor density) by causing release of NE from sympathetic nerve endings.", 
    "75": "In a previous report, it was shown that a dimension of personality entitled dependence/independence could be used to distinguish the cardiovascular and catecholaminergic response to stress in type A individuals. This study is a continuation of the previous work. It examines the relative effects of beta-blockade on stress-induced changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamines in two groups of type A individuals who differ in reactivity. Sixty-six healthy, middle-aged men with type A behavior were classified as dependent (high reactivity) or independent (low reactivity). The effects of beta-blockade on the two groups were tested in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial utilizing a mental stressor, a physical stressor, and work day monitoring. Results showed that, in comparison with the independent type As, those who had been classified as dependent had higher heart rates in all three stress conditions and had higher epinephrine levels during both the mental and physical stressors. For both groups, beta-blockade lowered the heart rate and systolic blood pressure but increased norepinephrine with the mental stressor and epinephrine and norepinephrine with the physical stressor. It also reduced the mean work day heart rate. For the dependent type As, the drug had a greater effect on increasing epinephrine during the physical stressor and by reducing the percent of the work day spent in high heart rate zones. The results are discussed from the point of view of identifying type As who may be particularly coronary prone and the potential effects of beta-blockade on the reactivity associated with type A behavior.", 
    "76": "The antihypertensive effects of NIP-121, a novel potassium channel opener, were examined in comparison with cromakalim and its active enantiomer, lemakalim. In experiments by direct blood pressure measurements, orally administered NIP-121 dose-relatedly decreased arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and the ED20 values (the doses to produce 20% decrease of the mean blood pressure) of NIP-121 and cromakalim were 0.010 and 0.11 mg/kg, respectively, NIP-121 thus being about ten times more potent than cromakalim. The duration of the hypotensive effect by NIP-121 was longer than that by cromakalim. The hypotensive effect of NIP-121 was stronger in SHRs than in normotensive rats. All three drugs showed tachycardia that was antagonized by a beta-blocker, propranolol. Intravenously administered NIP-121 also showed a more potent hypotensive action with longer duration than cromakalim in conscious SHRs. The ED20 values for hypotension by NIP-121, cromakalim, and lemakalim were 0.017, 0.040, and 0.016 mg/kg, respectively. The intravenous hypotensive potency of NIP-121 but not cromakalim was similar to that of p.o. administration. The repeated treatments with NIP-121 (0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg p.o. once a day) for 15 days did not modify the degree of the hypotensive action. In the anesthetized SHRs, pretreatment with glibenclamide but not other antagonists (atropine, propranolol, diphenhydramine + cimetidine, or indomethacin) suppressed the decrease in blood pressure induced by NIP-121.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "The serum of patients with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy contains immunoglobulins capable of causing in vitro acceleration of beating of neonatal rat heart myocytes. This effect is stereoselectively inhibited by (-)-propranolol and is inhibited also by the beta 1-selective adrenergic antagonists, bisoprolol and metoprolol. This effect is not reversed by washing and continues unabated for at least 24 h.", 
    "78": "1. The unitary conductance of nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor channels in rat sympathetic neurones has been studied. Conductance estimates varied from 26-48 pS with a mean of 36.8 pS in 1 mM-Ca2+. The main conductance level varied from patch to patch and the presence (or absence) of additional conductance levels also varied. 2. The channels showed large open channel noise and experiments with 300 mM-NaCl in the patch pipette substantially increased the open channel noise. The appearance of detectable step-like transitions within this noise strongly suggested the existence of closely spaced discrete levels. 3. Removal of divalent cations from the external solution increased the unitary channel conductance. Altering the main permeant ion in divalent-free solutions gave the following conductance sequence: K+ (93 pS) greater than Cs+ (61 pS) greater than Na+ (51 pS) greater than Li+(23 pS). 4. Replacement of Na+ by Cs+ in the external solution considerably reduced the current evoked by ACh in whole-cell recordings and the channel-opening frequency in outside-out patches. 5. The kinetic properties of channels activated by ACh and 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP) were also studied. At low concentrations of ACh and DMPP the gap distributions were complex and best fitted by the sum of four exponential components. Individual activations (bursts) were interrupted by the two shortest closed periods the briefer of which had time constants of 36 microseconds for ACh and 67 microseconds for DMPP. 6. The distribution of burst lengths had two components for each agonist, each component making up about 50% of the total area under the distribution. For ACh, the time constant of the longer component (12.2 ms) was similar to the decay time constant of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSCs) at similar temperature and potential. For DMPP the time constant of the longer component was 17.6 ms. 7. The relative number of brief gaps per long burst was much larger for ACh than for DMPP. Therefore the corrected mean open time for ACh (0.86 ms) was much shorter than that for DMPP (2.3 ms). 8. In terms of receptor mechanism, the values of the channel opening equilibrium constant (beta/alpha) estimated from these numbers (ACh, 23; DMPP, 25) suggest that both agonists are efficaceous. 9. DMPP is a potent blocker of the channel with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) of around 50 microM and blockage gaps of around 1 ms duration. ACh also blocks the channel but with a higher KB of around 470 microM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "79": "This report provides direct evidence for a dihydropyridine receptor/calcium channel in the insulin-secreting beta-cell line RINm5F. The receptor/channel can modulate the intracellular Ca++ concentration and the resultant insulin secretion by regulating the influx of extracellular Ca++ through dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent L-type Ca++ channels. Elevated extracellular K+ or the dihydropyridine Ca++ channel agonist, BAY k 8644 [methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethyl- phenyl)pyridine-5-carboxylate], stimulated the uptake of 45Ca++, raised [Ca++]i, and increased insulin secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. These actions were inhibited by L-type Ca++ channel blockers including nitrendipine, verapamil and diltiazem. (+)-[3H]PN200-110 bound specifically with high affinity to RINm5F cell membranes (Kd approximately 200 pM). Specific binding was inhibited competitively by dihydropyridines whereas phenylalkylamines inhibited incompletely (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding, consistent with an allosteric interaction. The benzothiazepine diltiazem had no effect on (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding in the presence of Ca++, but increased binding allosterically in the absence of Ca++ (in the presence of EGTA). Maximal (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding required divalent cations, with Mg++, Mn++ and Ba++ essentially as effective as Ca++ in reversing the effects of EGTA, whereas binding was not supported by Cd++ or La . Specific high affinity (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding was also demonstrated in intact RINm5F cells and shown to be modulated by membrane potential. Depolarization of the cells by raising extracellular K+ from 5 to 80 mM increased the affinity of (+)-[3H]PN200-110 4- to 5-fold (decreased Kd) with no significant effect on the maximum number of binding sites.", 
    "80": "Effects of the R(+)- and S(-)-isomers of befunolol and carteolol, beta-adrenoceptors with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, on the rabbit intraocular pressure were tested. The intraocular pressure was decreased by instillation of the R(+)- and S(-)-isomers of befunolol (0.1 and 0.3%) and of carteolol (1.0%) to the eye and attained the minimum level at 60 min. However, 0.3% of the R(+)- and S(-)-isomers of carteolol did not influence the pressure. The corresponding time courses for the intraocular pressure for the R(+)- and S(-)-isomers did not differ, suggesting that in the treatment of glaucoma, the therapeutic advantage of the R(+)-isomers of befunolol and carteolol may be similar to the S(-)-isomers.", 
    "81": "A 69-year-old woman with advanced rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suffered two episodes of hyperkalemic hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (HCMA). Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were markedly suppressed in the first episode occurring in paralell with the administration of metoprolol during piroxicam and lobenzarit (CCA) therapy. Rechallenge with diclofenac sodium and CCA lead to the second hyperkalemia, but no significant suppression of the renin-aldosterone axis was seen at that time. This suggests that the different mechanisms contribute to the development of these episodes, including the tubulo-interstitial injury which is not uncommon in RA. The combined use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and beta-adrenergic blockers may increase the risk of life-threatening hyperkalemia through their suppressive effect on the renin-aldosterone system, whereas the concomitant administration of CCA with NSAIDs through the impairment in the renal tubular function. These drugs should be most carefully given to patients with a latent defect in renal potassium excretion.", 
    "82": "Bisaramil is a new, orally active antiarrhythmic agent. We investigated and classified its mechanism of action according to Vaughan Williams [1]. We have found that bisaramil at the concentration range of 2-20 microM decreased the frequency and the force of the contraction in spontaneously beating guinea-pig's right auricle in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, bisaramil significantly prolonged the conduction time and effective refractory period both in the auricle and in the ventricle which were driven electrically. The atrioventricular conduction time, as measured on isolated rabbit heart preparation containing both auricles and the left ventricule, was also lengthened in the presence of bisaramil in a concentration-dependent manner. Bisaramil did not inhibit isoprenaline-induced tachycardia in anaesthetized cats, indicating that it has no beta-blocking activity. When tested on frog sciatic nerve, bisaramil showed a significant local-anaesthetic property well comparable to lignocaine (lidocaine). The drug caused a parallel shift of the dose-response curve to CaCl2 similar to that of the verapamil on isolated guinea-pig left auricle, indicating a possible Ca-antagonistic activity. The prolongation of the atrial, ventricular and atrioventricular conduction time as well as the lengthening of the effective refractory periods were also observed in anaesthetized dogs after an i.v. dose of 0.5 mg/kg bisaramil. On the other hand, this dose of bisaramil did not exert significant negative inotropic and unfavourable haemodynamic effect on anaesthetized dogs. In conclusion, bisaramil seems to be an effective antiarrhythmic drug having both class I (membrane stabilizer) and class IV (inhibitor of calcium transport) type activity.",

    "84": "The aim of the present in vivo study was to investigate in anaesthetized rats, the effects of selective adrenergic agonists and antagonists on basal gastric tone and phasic contractions by the use of a volumetric method. L-phenylephrine, an alpha-1 agonist, induced hypertension, bradycardia and a significant gastric relaxation. Clonidine, an alpha-2 agonist, caused hypotension, bradycardia and a significant gastric contraction and a reduction of the amplitude of phasic contractions. Salbutamol, a beta-2 agonist, induced a dose-dependent tachycardia and a significant inhibition of gastric tone whereas prenalterol, a beta-1 agonist, induced tachycardia without any significant influence on gastric basal tone. Yohimbine, an alpha-2 blocker, significantly decreased gastric basal tone and reversed the inhibition of phasic contractions induced by clonidine. Prazocine, a selective alpha-1 blocker, and propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, had no significant influence on gastric basal tone or phasic contractions. It is concluded that sympathetic inhibition of basal gastric tone in the rat is mediated by alpha-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Activation of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors significantly increased basal gastric tone and reduced the amplitude of phasic contractions. A blockade of alpha-2 receptors significantly decreased basal gastric tone and restored the amplitude of phasic contractions.", 
    "85": "1. The differential effects of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes on potassium fluxes and exercise capacity were compared in eight healthy young men using single oral doses of the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118551, the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol or the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. The study was randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled. 2. Potassium in the venous effluent from the exercising muscles increased progressively with increasing exercise intensity. This response was augmented by propranolol, whereas neither atenolol nor ICI-118551 modified the response. After exercise potassium concentration fell exponentially with no difference between the treatment regimens. 3. Cumulative work was significantly reduced by ICI-118551 (6.4%, P = 0.04) and by propranolol (12.4%, P less than 0.01), whereas the reduction with atenolol (5.6%) did not reach statistical significance. 4. Atenolol and propranolol reduced peak heart rate by 23% and 29%, and peak systolic blood pressure by 9% and 11% respectively during maximal exercise. ICI-118551 caused a non-significant reduction in heart rate during submaximal exercise, with a significant reduction at maximum exercise (6% reduction), whereas systolic blood pressure was not different from placebo. Diastolic blood pressures were similar across all treatment regimens. 5. Similar glucose concentrations were obtained at baseline and at exhaustion during all treatment regimens. Lactate concentrations were comparable for any given exercise intensity irrespective of treatment regimens. Propranolol reduced lactate concentrations from the exercising muscles at maximum exercise in proportion to the reduction of maximal exercise capacity. 6. The subjective perception of fatigue was not affected by either beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "The effects of combined alpha/beta adrenoceptor blockade and of beta-receptor/slow channel calcium blockade on systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics and on adrenergic activity were compared in two matched groups of men suffering from ischemic heart disease and grade 1 to 2 hypertension. They were studied at rest supine and during ischemia-inducing exercise in the seated posture using invasive percutaneous techniques. Sixteen patients received 200 mg labetalol as a single oral doses, 15 received 100 mg metoprolol plus 10 mg nifedipine. Both regimens reduced pressures in the systemic and pulmonary circulation under all conditions. At rest, stroke volume and cardiac output slightly decreased after labetalol and increased after metoprolol/nifedipine. During exercise the changes induced by the two regimens were virtually identical; heart rates and vascular resistances were reduced, stroke volume increased, cardiac output was not significantly changed. Plasma renin activity was lowered by labetalol, unchanged by metoprolol/nifedipine. Plasma adrenaline increased after metoprolol/nifedipine only, noradrenaline with both regimens. Both combinations significantly lowered stroke work and the rate pressure product and had similar beneficial effects on the onset and the duration of angina. It is concluded that both combinations significantly reduce blood pressures and attenuate or offset the potential adverse hemodynamic effects of beta-receptor blockade alone without loss but rather enhancement of antianginal efficacy.",

    "88": "Ventricular arrhythmias are a frequent complication of myocardial infarction. In either the acute or the late stage, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation represent the most common cause of cardiac death. About 15% of the patients with acute myocardial infarction die before entering the hospital, the majority due to ventricular fibrillation. Another 10 to 15% of the survivors of an acute myocardial infarction die suddenly within the subsequent year, again mostly due to ventricular arrhythmias. Independent risk factors for sudden cardiac death consist of depressed left ventricular function, persistent electrical instability (e.g. repetitive and complex VPB's, documented 'late potentials', inducibility of arrhythmias at programmed electrical stimulation), new onset complete-bundle branch block and large aneurysm of the left anterior ventricular wall. Bradyarrhythmias (i.e. high-degree AV-Block, asystole) are a far less common etiology of sudden cardiac death caused by an ischemic lesion to the conduction system. Betablockers have a well-known benefit in secondary prevention, whereas antiarrhythmic agents (with the exception of amiodarone) are ineffective in asymptomatic patients or may even increase the risk for sudden death due to a proarrhythmic effect (class IC); therefore, the latter are not recommended in asymptomatic patients with documented VPB's and preserved left ventricular function. The prognosis of patients with sustained VT and VF is poor. Their outcome is improved in responders to an individual antiarrhythmic therapy with serial drug testing or with subendocardial resection of localized areas and by implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator.", 
    "89": "The permeability of the blood-brain barrier for atenolol, a hydrophilic beta-adrenergic blocking agent, has been assessed in dogs, by studying the distribution of [11C]atenolol in brain tissue with positron emission tomography. The passage of atenolol into the brain was very limited, but a measurable small net influx into the brain tissues did occur. Osmotic opening of the blood-brain barrier resulted in a marked increase of the atenolol concentrations in brain tissue. The approach described, with sequential non-invasive measurements in brain tissue, is applicable to pharmacokinetic studies of atenolol in man.", 
    "90": "After a single bout of treadmill running (20 m.min-1, 1 hour), the time course of the in vivo insulin sensitivity was determined in previously untrained rats. The glucose infusion rate (GIR, mg.kg-1.min-1) as an index of insulin sensitivity was assessed by the euglycemic insulin clamp technique 1 (1h-post-Ex group), 3 (3h-post-Ex), 6 (6h-post-Ex) and 24 hours after exercise (24h-post-Ex), n = 8 in each group. GIRs increased with time from 5.72 +/- 1.02 (1h-post-Ex), to 7.58 +/- 1.07 (3h-post-Ex), 10.31 +/- 1.52 (6h-post-Ex) and 10.23 +/- 1.62 (24h-post-Ex) vs control (5.51 +/- 0.63); the GIR in the 6h-post-Ex and the 24h-post-Ex were significantly higher than those in the control and the 1h-post-Ex groups (p less than 0.05). The rate of increase was equivalent to that observed after long-term training in our previous study. GIR of alpha-adrenergic blockade infused 1 hour after exercise (1h-post-Ex alpha) significantly increased (8.32 +/- 0.96) compared to the control and no exercise alpha-blocker-infused control (C alpha) (p less than 0.05). But no significant difference was shown between 1h-post-Ex and 1h-post-Ex alpha groups. In the beta-blocker-infused group, GIR did not show a significant increase. These results indicate that an increase in the in vivo insulin sensitivity after a single bout of exercise is not evident until 6 hours post-exercise. The delay in the sensitivity might partly be explained by the suppression caused by catecholamines via the alpha-mechanism.", 
    "91": "For the application of physical conditioning in the prevention of coronary heart disease to be meaningful, account must be taken of physiological and pathophysiological baselines. Physical activity is associated with an increase in metabolic rate, and the prophylactic effect of exercise is due mainly to metabolic effects and not, as commonly thought, to hemodynamic factors. Raising the metabolic rate has a positive effect on risk factors which--with the exception of smoking--are largely metabolic. For this reason, the physiological aspects of the release of energy and its increase under physical exercise are described. Of decisive importance for prophylaxis is not so much the nature of the exercise--for example endurance training in particular--as the overall extent of physical exercise, and the resulting energy consumption. The hemodynamic effect of physical activity, in particular the optimization of cardiovascular function, is of importance not so much for primary preventive reasons as for reducing the oxygen requirement of the myocardium--a secondary preventive measure. For producing a cardiovascular training effect, forms of exercise performed close to the aerobic-anaerobic threshold (AAT) are optimal. A common mistake is to assume that the training effect achieved under physiological conditions can simply be extrapolated to the pathophysiological situation. Exercise workloads that are below the aerobic-anaerobic threshold fail to produce a training effect. Here, the major aim must be to achieve metabolic, coordinative and motivational effects. If the physiological responses to exercise, in particular heart rate, are modified by pathophysiological or pharmacological mechanisms, other, in particular respiratory and metabolic parameters should be used as regulators of training. Such parameters are considered in detail.", 
    "92": "In addition to the underlying pathophysiological processes that cause myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy, structural, biochemical, neurohormonal and haemodynamic influences and interrelations promote progression of the heart failure syndrome. Independent of their symptomatic benefits, diuretics, digitalis, ACE inhibitors, PDE inhibitors and dopamine agonists exert specific influences on factors that retard or accelerate progression of congestive heart failure (CHF). Important factors that indicate or promote progression of CHF are discussed here, with special emphasis on therapeutic options. Interference with baroreceptor function (digitalis, ACE inhibitors), the RAA system (ACE inhibitors), the sympathetic nerve system (dopamine agonists, ACE inhibitors, digitalis) can potentially retard progression of CHF, while other therapeutic options, such as PDE inhibitors and diuretics, might accelerate progression of left ventricular dysfunction and CHF.", 
    "93": "1. Apparent affinity constants (KD) for prenalterol, an agonist of low intrinsic efficacy at beta 1-adrenoceptors in rat left atria, have been determined by use of receptor desensitization and functional antagonism induced by isoprenaline and carbachol, respectively. The values obtained have been compared to those values estimated with the irreversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM). 2. The -log KD values for prenalterol estimated by desensitization or irreversible antagonism ranged from 6.8-7.1 and 6.2-7.1, respectively. 3. Carbachol produced functional antagonism of the response to prenalterol even though it was removed before addition of prenalterol. This effect was mediated by M2-muscarinic receptors. Pretreatment of animals with pertussis toxin did not affect the functional antagonism elicited by carbachol. The apparent KD value obtained after pre-exposure to carbachol (6.8) was similar to those estimated by use of either alkylation with BAAM or desensitization with isoprenaline (see above). 4. It is concluded that acute desensitization or functional antagonism of responses to agonists of low intrinsic efficacy provides a means to estimate apparent KD constants. This approach could be useful to characterize receptors for which an irreversible antagonist may not be available.", 
    "94": "1. Standard intracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurones in in vitro hippocampal slices have been used to investigate the effects of excitatory amino acid antagonists and adrenergic agents on evoked synaptic potentials. 2. Ortho- and antidromic stimulation were conducted with remotely placed electrodes in order to minimize the possibility of stimulating the interneurones directly. In addition to the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), orthodromic stimulation evoked an inhibitory sequence consisting of a fast and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). The slow-IPSP was blocked by intracellular injection of QX 314. Antidromic stimulation evoked a relatively pure fast-IPSP. 3. In seven neurones the differential effects of glutamatergic receptor blockers on the fast-IPSP were investigated. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) was added after the full effect of the non-NMDA receptor blocker, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) had been achieved. In three neurones, APV had no additional blocking effect, while in the remaining four neurones, both the ortho- and antidromically evoked IPSPs were reduced by 20-50%. This suggests that NMDA receptors participate in the activation of some GABAergic interneurones, which was further confirmed by showing that the IPSP was enhanced by Mg(2+)-free medium. 4. In the presence of CNQX (10 microM) and APV (50 microM) together, the ortho- and antidromically evoked fast-IPSPs were greatly reduced. A small 'residual' IPSP remained which was best studied by depolarizing the neurone to around -50 mV. With maximum stimulation, this amounted to 26.3 +/- 15.4% (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 15) of the control IPSP evoked by orthodromic stimulation and 41 +/- 14.6% of the control IPSP evoked by antidromic stimulation. The following statements apply equally to the ortho- and antidromically activated residual IPSPs. 5. The residual IPSP was completely blocked by low concentrations of bicuculline, indicating that it is mediated by GABAA receptors. When compared with a control IPSP of similar amplitude, the residual IPSP was found to have a faster rise time and time-to-peak, but a similar decay time. 6. Neither the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, atropine nor the presynaptic glutamate agonist, L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-APB) had any effect on the residual IPSP. 7. The residual IPSP was completely blocked by the adrenergic beta-receptor antagonist, L-propranolol (50-100 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "95": "Nebivolol (R67555), a drug with beta 1 receptor antagonizing properties, was administered once daily (5 mg) for 7 days in 10 healthy volunteers. The hemodynamic parameters were measured noninvasively during postural changes (supine, sitting, standing) and during isometric handgrip at 50% maximal voluntary contraction, before and 3, 8, and 23 hours after the first nebivolol intake of 5 mg; the same measurements were done 23 hours after the last intake. Nebivolol lowered arterial blood pressure acutely and chronically due to a decrease in heart rate and cardiac output. The stroke volume seemed to be preserved, while the total peripheral vascular resistance did not change. Nebivolol did not change the orthostatic responses, except that the absolute value was lowered. Nebivolol was unable to prevent the blood pressure increase during isometric handgrip. However, this blood pressure increase was obtained by an increase in the total peripheral vascular resistance and not by an increase in the cardiac output, as observed during control measurements before nebivolol intake.", 
    "96": "The hemodynamic consequences of blockade at both beta-adrenoceptors and slow calcium channels is of therapeutic importance for patients with angina pectoris. The hemodynamic interaction of a new cardioselective beta blocker, celiprolol, and nifedipine was examined in an acute hemodynamic study using three prospectively matched groups with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (n = 10/group). Patients were randomly allocated to intravenous celiprolol (8 mg), sublingual nifedipine (20 mg), or their combination. Rest and exercise (supine bicycle) hemodynamics were determined before and following each therapy. At rest, celiprolol did not alter pumping function; nifedipine reduced diastolic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), with a small increase in heart rate. Combination therapy reduced systemic arterial pressure and SVRI; heart rate and cardiac stroke volume index increased. During exercise celiprolol tended to reduce heart rate and cardiac index; nifedipine reduced exercise SVR and cardiac stroke work indices. Combination therapy reduced all components of blood pressure; cardiac stroke work and SVR indices fell. These hemodynamic data suggest that beta blockade with celiprolol may result in a slight depression of cardiac pumping during exercise; however, such effects are offset by the vasodilating actions of nifedipine (reflex sympathetic action offsetting cardiodepression). Thus the acute hemodynamic effects of this combination were seemingly safe in these patients; the longer term effects during maintained therapy should be further assessed.", 
    "97": "The DAVIT-II trial has shown that the verapamil type of calcium antagonist can beneficially be used in post-infarct patients. A recent re-analysis suggests that verapamil may also prevent post-infarct sudden death. There are good theoretical reasons to suppose that calcium antagonists should help prevent ventricular fibrillation. If calcium antagonist agents could be found which have negligible negative inotropic effects, such drugs might be ideal for further testing in the post-infarct phase.", 
    "98": "Changes of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis in the recovery from anesthetic hypothermia were studied by measuring the temperatures of the interscapular BAT and rectum or the tissue uptake of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in rats. After intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg), rectal temperature decreased to reach a steady level of approximately 33 degrees C (steady phase) and then increased gradually (recovery phase). The temperature of the interscapular BAT was significantly higher than rectal temperature in the recovery phase. The uptake of 2-DG in vivo in BAT was low in the steady phase but increased greatly in the recovery phase. The increase in 2-DG uptake was suppressed after surgical sympathetic denervation or when rectal temperature was maintained at approximately 37.5 degrees C. In the heart, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue, there was no appreciable change in 2-DG uptake except a slight increase in the heart. beta-Adrenergic blockade attenuated the changes in BAT temperature and 2-DG uptake seen during the recovery phase. It was concluded that BAT significantly contributes to heat production in recovery from anesthetic hypothermia.", 
    "99": "A given overall level of beta-adrenergic receptor occupancy by agonist can involve either high or low turnover of occupancy with respect to individual receptors, depending on the binding properties of the particular agonist. It was recently demonstrated that, for epinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activation in the S49 cell, a portion of the separation between the beta-adrenergic receptor binding curve and the cyclase response curves is dependent on high occupancy turnover (high binding frequency). By involving a larger number of receptors within a short period of time than are bound at any one instant, the effect of high binding frequency is to increase the rate of GTP-binding protein/adenylate cyclase activation over the rate that is observed when the mobility of the number of receptors occupied at any given instant is the rate-limiting factor. This phenomenon contributes to the normal dose-response curve for epinephrine, according to our analysis, but only in combination with the apparent high efficiency of the receptor in the epinephrine-bound state at cyclase activation. Here we examined the potential combination of the contributions of agonist binding frequency and intrinsic efficiency to the adenylate cyclase activation rate for four other beta-adrenergic agonists (isoproterenol, zinterol, metaproterenol, and dobutamine). This was done by a comparison of the response (1-min cAMP accumulation) between a point on the normal dose versus response curve (control) with the response under conditions in which the concentration of agonist-bound receptors was identical to control but the absolute number of receptors involved in maintaining that concentration was significantly reduced. In the experiments, the majority of the receptors were blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, which has a relatively long occupancy half-life. The remaining receptors were occupied by agonist such that the concentration of bound receptors was identical to the control condition of low occupancy of the full complement of receptors in the absence of antagonist. Compared with control, the experimental condition was one in which agonist occupancy turnover was inhibited and the potential contribution of agonist binding frequency as a factor contributing to the cyclase activation rate was greatly reduced (producing a point on the receptor mobility-limited dose versus response curve). Isoproterenol and metaproterenol show evidence that their binding frequencies and the efficiency of the receptor when bound to them are of such a combination that the normal dose-response curves for these agonists contain a component that is dependent on the binding frequency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "100": "The administration of a single, 100-300 mg/kg ip, dose of a B6 vitamer to rats resulted in an almost immediate and gradual mobilization of the liver glycogen and a concomitant elevation of the serum glucose, with the order of potency being pyridoxal greater than pyridoxamine greater than pyridoxine. Since the B6 vitamer also stimulated the secretion of adrenal catecholamines and the accumulation of liver cAMP, and a pretreatment with selected blocking agents conferred significant protection against the glycogen depletion in the order of potency propranolol + phentolamine greater than propranolol greater than verapamil greater than phentolamine, a role for an adrenomedullary catecholamine-stimulated, beta-adrenoceptor-mediated, activation of the glycogen cascade system was suggested. This assumption was confirmed by verifying pyridoxal to possess virtually no effect on the liver glycogen of adrenalectomized rats.", 
    "101": "Previous studies have shown that stimulation of adrenergic receptors in the brain increases the expression of the immediate early gene (IEG), c-fos, in vivo (Mol. Brain Res., 6(1989) 39-45). The present study was undertaken to determine whether this also holds for other IEGs which have been shown to be activated in brain cell culture by adrenergic agonists. Both yohimbine injection and stressful stimulation, two treatments causing brain norepinephrine (NE) release, were found to cause a parallel, transient activation of at least 5 IEGs (c-fos, nur77, tis-7, zif-268 and tis-21) in the rat cortex. Genes that are not immediate early (beta-actin, NGF and HSP70) were found not to be affected in the interval used (6 h). The responses were mediated predominantly by beta-adrenoceptors with some contribution from alpha 1 receptors. The parallel activation of multiple genes by noradrenergic receptors may enable the coding of different biochemical responses to the activation of different receptors.", 
    "102": "We studied the effects of chronic administration of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA): carteolol (with ISA) and propranolol (without ISA), respectively, on the heart of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY). Six-week-old SHRs and WKYs were orally given carteolol or propranolol for ten weeks. The heart rate was reduced in propranolol-treated SHR, but not in carteolol-treated ones. In WKY, carteolol-treatment increased the heart rate. The number and affinities of beta-adrenoceptors were analyzed using [3H]dihydroalprenolol as a ligand. Propranolol at 30 mg/kg increased the number of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in both SHR and WKY. In contrast, 10 mg/kg carteolol significantly decreased the number of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in SHR, but not in WKY. These data indicate that carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with ISA, does not cause up-regulation of the number of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in the rat and suggest that this fact is related to a possible lack of \"rebound phenomena\" after sudden discontinuation of chronic carteolol-therapy in humans.", 
    "103": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is coreleased with noradrenaline (NA) from sympathetic nerve endings. In vitro data suggest that NPY is coreleased during high stimulation frequencies. The present study investigates plasma levels of catecholamines and neuropeptide Y (NPY) during changes in sympathetic nervous activity in conscious dogs. Increase in sympathetic tone: arterial hypertension elicited by sinoaortic denervation induced an increase (X 2) in plasma noradrenaline (NA) but no change in NPY levels. High (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) but not low (0.05 mg/kg i.v.) doses of yohimbine rose plasma NPY concentrations. Decrease in sympathetic tone: clonidine (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) but not beta-blocking agents (propranolol or atenolol: 1 mg/kg i.v.) reduced plasma NPY levels. These results show that NPY is correleased in vivo from sympathetic nerve endings during marked and rapid increases in sympathetic tone. They suggest a lack of relationship between NA and NPY release. Alpha 2-adrenoceptors are involved in the presynaptic control of NPY release from sympathetic tone. Finally, some antihypertensive drugs (clonidine but not beta-blocking agents) are able to decrease plasma NPY levels.", 
    "104": "We review the use of socially housed cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) in biomedical research with emphasis on studies of atherosclerosis, particularly in the two specific domains of atherosclerosis investigation for which nonhuman primates are especially well-suited as animal models: gender differences and psychosocial influences. We found that the presence of normal ovarian function prevented exacerbation of diet-induced coronary artery atherosclerosis in female monkeys. However, any manipulation or condition which impaired ovarian function tended to diminish or abolish this \"female\" protection. Among group-housed female monkeys, low social status was accompanied by ovarian dysfunction and, not surprisingly, by exacerbated coronary artery atherosclerosis as well. Surgical menopause (ovariectomy) also induced exacerbation of coronary atherosclerosis in monkeys, a situation which was prevented by estrogen replacement therapy. Conversely, pregnancy (a hyperestrogenic state) resulted in markedly diminished atherosclerosis. A somewhat different pattern of atherogenesis emerged among socially-housed males. Here, socially dominant animals developed exacerbated coronary artery atherosclerosis, but only under conditions of social stress (viz., disruption caused by periodic reorganization of social group membership). We hypothesized that exposure to repeated group reorganizations provoked activation of the sympathetic nervous system among dominant animals; in turn, the hemodynamic and metabolic concomitants of sympathetic activation may have damaged the coronary arteries of these monkeys, potentiating atherogenesis. To test this hypothesis, males were housed in unstable social groupings, with half of the monkeys administered a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (to attenuate heart rate and blood pressure responses to stress). The beta-blocker inhibited atherosclerosis, but only among those animals behaviorally predisposed to develop exacerbated lesions (i.e. dominant monkeys). These results support the view that monkeys are suitable research models of atherosclerosis, a disease that affects millions of humans.", 
    "105": "The present study was undertaken to elucidate a possible role of non-beta-receptor mediated effects in dl-propranolol-induced enhancement of post-hypoxic contractile and metabolic recovery in perfused rat hearts. The rat hearts were perfused for 30 min under reoxygenated conditions following 15 min-substrate free-hypoxic perfusion, and the cardiac performance and myocardial metabolism were examined. Hypoxia induced complete cessation of cardiac contractile force, depletion of myocardial high-energy phosphates, release of ATP metabolites and creatine kinase from the heart. Subsequent reoxygenation produced little recovery of cardiac contractile activity and tissue high-energy phosphates, further enhancement of the release of creatine kinase and the accumulation of tissue calcium. Treatment of the hypoxic hearts with dl-propranolol, d-propranolol and atenolol was performed during 5 to 15 min of hypoxic perfusion. dl-Propranolol and d-propranolol at the concentration of 45 microM elicited a significant recovery of cardiac contractile activity and restoration of myocardial high-energy phosphates. This treatment also resulted in a suppression of the release of creatine kinase and ATP metabolites and the tissue calcium accumulation observed during hypoxia and/or reoxygenation. However, such beneficial effects were not seen in hearts treated with 45 microM atenolol. dl-Propranolol and atenolol, but not d-propranolol, in a concentration of 45 microM have been shown to reveal beta-adrenoceptor blocking action. Thus, the results suggest the involvement of non-beta-receptor mediated effects of propranolol in the enhanced post-hypoxic contractile and metabolic recovery of the perfused rat heart. The non-beta-receptor mediated activity of these drugs appears to be related to their ability to suppress the maximal driving frequency of left atrial preparations.", 
    "106": "The effects of the competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists CPP (5 & 10 mg/kg) and NPC 12626 (25 & 40 mg/kg) and the noncompetitive NMDA antagonists phencyclidine (1, 3, & 6.25 mg/kg) and MK 801 (0.1 & 0.2 mg/kg) on performance of rats on a nonspatial delayed matching-to-sample working memory task were evaluated. At the highest dose, each NMDA antagonist reduced choice accuracy at all retention intervals. In contrast, the reference anticholinergic agent scopolamine selectively reduced accuracy at long retention intervals, suggesting that scopolamine but not the NMDA antagonists directly interfered with time-dependent working memory retention. Propranolol, diazepam, and phenylisopropyladenosine had little or no effect on choice accuracy, suggesting that noradrenergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid-diazepam, and adenosine receptors may be relatively unimportant for working memory performance as assessed in this task. The NMDA antagonists also differed from scopolamine in that doses of NMDA antagonists that reduced response accuracy also reduced response probability, altered bias (competitive antagonists only), and increased intertrial interval responding (noncompetitive antagonists only). It was concluded that NMDA antagonists disrupt cognitive functions including, but not limited to, those required for accurate working memory performance.", 
    "107": "The density of [125I]iodo-cyanopindolol binding to beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors was studied in post mortem basal ganglia samples of Huntington's chorea and Parkinson's disease patients using autoradiography. Whereas no significant changes were observed in sections from Parkinson's and Huntington's chorea grade 2 patients, a nearly complete loss of beta-1 binding sites was observed in the basal ganglia of Huntington patients at later stages of the disease. The concentration of beta-2 receptors was increased by a factor 2 in the posterior putamen of all choreic cases. These results are consistent with the view that beta-1 receptors are predominantly located on a subpopulation of neurons which degenerate at late stages of Huntington's chorea, while beta-2 receptors are present mainly on glial elements.", 
    "108": "Individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) frequently show symptoms of a hyperadrenergic state. beta adrenergic receptor characteristics were compared in the lymphocytes of subjects with symptomatic MVP and control subjects during rest and exercise. At rest, the proportion of receptors binding agonist with high affinity, as determined from isoproterenol competition for (-)[125I]-iodopindolol binding sites, was greater in MVP subjects than in controls. With exercise, the proportion of high-affinity receptors in MVP subjects decreased to control levels. Isoproterenol stimulation of lymphocyte 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) also was greater in MVP subjects than in controls at rest, but not during exercise. Plasma catecholamine concentrations in MVP subjects were normal during both rest and exercise. Unlike exercise, isoproterenol infusion elicited clinical manifestations of increased adrenergic responsiveness in MVP subjects. The beta receptor in exercised MVP subjects exhibited unusually high affinity agonist binding (i.e. a lower dissociation constant KH than in either the same subjects at rest or exercised controls) and also abnormal coupling to the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (GS) of adenylate cyclase, as reflected by the inability of guanine nucleotide to convert the receptor to a low-affinity state. These findings suggest that functional alteration of the beta adrenergic receptor, in the absence of abnormal plasma catecholamine levels, might contribute to the hyperadrenergic state of MVP subjects at rest. However, desensitization of high affinity beta receptors or altered receptor-GS coupling might preserve normal adrenergic responsiveness during exercise.", 
    "109": "In a multicenter, parallel, double-blind study, lisinopril, a new converting enzyme inhibitor, was compared with atenolol in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. Four hundred ninety patients were randomized to once-a-day treatment with lisinopril 20 mg or atenolol 50 mg for 4 weeks, and the doses of lisinopril or atenolol were increased at 4-week intervals up to 80 mg or 200 mg, respectively, if sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was not well controlled. Lisinopril and atenolol reduced SDBP to a similar extent. All reductions from baseline in sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure were significant (p less than 0.01). Lisinopril produced a significantly greater reduction (p less than 0.01) in sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) than atenolol. The predominant reduction in SSBP could not be explained on the basis of age, race, or severity of hypertension. It is suggested that the increase in arterial compliance reported for converting enzyme inhibitors could explain the predominant decrease in systolic blood pressure.", 
    "110": "The effect of dietary (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (sunflower oil) on pig adipocyte beta-adrenoreceptor and adenylate cyclase activity was examined. Two adipose sites (subcutaneous and perirenal) were compared. The existence of two affinity classes for beta-adrenoreceptors was evidenced. Adenylate cyclase stimulation by isoproterenol was higher in the perirenal fat than in the subcutaneous fat, in parallel to a higher beta-adrenoreceptor density. When sunflower oil was included in the diet, the adenylate cyclase response to beta-agonists was greater, particularly in perirenal fat, as was the affinity of the adrenoreceptors in their high affinity state. However, the number of beta-adrenoreceptors was lower, suggesting that these are spare receptors. Adenylate cyclase stimulation by 5'-guanylylimidophosphate also revealed site- and diet-specific variations indicating alterations at the Gs-protein level. The adenylate cyclase catalytic activity (reflected by the forskolin-stimulated response) in the control group was higher in the subcutaneous fat than in the perirenal fat. In the sunflower oil-fed pigs, the catalytic activity was greater in the perirenal fat relative to controls, leading to similar values in both adipose tissues of sunflower oil-fed pigs. This indicates that the cyclase catalytic subunit activity also depends on the anatomical site of the fat deposit and is influenced by the diet as well. Correlation between these changes in the adenylate cyclase system are discussed in relationship with alterations in the plasma membrane structure.", 
    "111": "alpha-Adrenergic stimulation is known to enhance myocardial contractility. Adult rat left ventricular myocytes bathed in 1 mM [Ca2+] (Ca0) and electrically stimulated at 0.2 Hz responded to alpha-adrenergic stimulation with 50 microM phenylephrine and 1 microM propranolol with an increase in twitch amplitude to 177.1 +/- 25.6% of control (mean +/- SEM). In contrast, when cell Ca2+ loading was increased by bathing cells in 5 mM Ca0, alpha-adrenergic stimulation decreased twitch amplitude to 68.6 +/- 8.2% of control. Time-averaged cytosolic [Ca2+] of cells in 1.0 mM Ca0 is enhanced via an increase in the frequency of electrical stimulation. When myocytes were stimulated at 2 Hz in 1 mM Ca0, alpha-adrenergic stimulation did not increase twitch amplitude (103.8 +/- 12.4% of control). In myocytes loaded with the Ca2+ probe into-1, alpha-adrenergic effects during stimulation at 0.2 Hz (an increase in twitch amplitude in 1 mM Ca0 and a decrease in twitch amplitude in 5 mM Ca0) were associated with similar changes in the indo-1 transient. In 5 mM Ca0, spontaneous Ca2+ releases from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) occurred in the diastolic interval between twitches (2.9 +/- 1.4 spontaneous SR Ca2+ oscillations/min; n = 7); alpha-adrenergic stimulation abolished these oscillations in six of seven cells. Thus, an increase in the frequency of spontaneous diastolic SR Ca2+ release (i.e., Ca2+ overload) is not the mechanism for the negative inotropic effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation in 5 mM Ca0. In experiments with unstimulated myocytes, we determined whether the effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation on cell Ca2+ homeostasis and oscillatory SR Ca2+ release observed in 5 mM Ca0 occurs only during electrical stimulation, when voltage-dependent currents are operative, or also at rest. Unstimulated rat ventricular myocytes in 5 mM Cao exhibit oscillatory SR Ca2+ release; alpha-adrenergic stimulation decreased the frequency of these oscillations to 53.9 +/- 8.9% of control, and this effect was blocked by 1 microM prazosin. In unstimulated indo-1-loaded myocytes alpha-adrenergic stimulation decreased the resting indo-1 fluorescence ratio in 5 mM Ca0, whereas it had no effect in 1 mM Ca0. Additional experiments were aimed at defining a role for Ca(2+)-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) for the negative inotropic effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation in 5 mM Ca0. Short-term preexposure to 0.1 microM 4 beta-phrobol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) has been shown to maximally activate PKC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "112": "Using microelectrode techniques we compared the effects of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 2-3 microM), DL-propranolol (1-3 micrograms/ml), and flecainide acetate (10-15 microM) on isolated canine ventricular epicardial (epicardium) and endocardial (endocardium) tissues. Propranolol, TTX, and flecainide decreased Vmax and phase 0 amplitude in a use-dependent manner in both tissues. The effects of propranolol were slow to develop and wash out. TTX and propranolol always abbreviated action potential duration in endocardium. Action potential duration was abbreviated by 23.8 +/- 5.6 msec after propranolol (1 microgram/ml, basic cycle length [BCL] = 1,000 msec) and 10.8 +/- 12.9 msec after TTX (2 microM, BCL = 1,000 msec). In epicardium, the reduction of phase 0 and 1 amplitudes led to a slowing of the second action potential upstroke and an increase in the amplitude of phase 2. This accentuation of the notch resulted in a paradoxical prolongation of the epicardial action potential. Action potential duration was prolonged 34.4 +/- 11.3 msec after 4 hours of exposure to propranolol (1 microgram/ml, BCL = 1,000 msec), 11.1 +/- 6.3 msec after 15 minutes of exposure to TTX (2 microM, BCL = 1,000 msec), and 19.9 +/- 8.2 msec after 25-45 minutes of exposure to flecainide (15 microM, BCL = 500 msec). With stronger sodium block, phase 1 terminated at more negative potentials, the second upstroke often failed to appear, and an all-or-none repolarization ensued causing a marked abbreviation of the epicardial action potential. In some epicardial preparations, we observed marked abbreviation at some sites but prolongation at other sites after sodium blockade with flecainide. The dispersion of repolarization was often attended by reentrant activity. The differential response of epicardium and endocardium to sodium blockade was not observed when the preparations were pretreated with 4-aminopyridine or ryanodine, agents known to diminish the transient outward current and epicardial notch. Acceleration-induced prolongation of refractoriness was observed after sodium blockade in epicardium but not in endocardium. Postrepolarization refractoriness also occurred in epicardium but not in endocardium after TTX, propranolol, or flecainide exposure. The data indicate that propranolol, TTX, and flecainide, via their action to block sodium current, may exert opposite effects on action potential duration and refractoriness in cells spanning the ventricular wall. The presence of the transient outward current in epicardium but not in endocardium appears to contribute importantly to these differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
