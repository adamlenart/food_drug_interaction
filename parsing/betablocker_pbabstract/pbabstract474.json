    "0": "The purpose of this study was to obtain information regarding the participation of the sympathetic nervous system in cardiac autonomic neuropathy in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus employing spectral analysis of heart rate variability in the supine and standing posture. Ten insulin-dependent diabetic patients (29 +/- 2 years) with a short to moderately long duration of diabetes (11 +/- 1 years) and cardiac vagal neuropathy based on measurements of respiratory sinus arrhythmia were compared to 10 healthy volunteers (27 +/- 1 years) before and after the administration of atropine and atropine plus propranolol. In diabetic patients the reactivity in total power (delta TP) from supine to upright position was significantly lower compared to control subjects before and after atropine. There was no significant difference in delta TP between diabetics and controls after atropine plus propranolol. The magnitude of TP increase is essentially due to the increase of blood pressure related heart rate fluctuations (delta MF) from lying to standing and dependent on beta-adrenergical efferent activity to the heart. In diabetic patients as well as in normal subjects under the influence of atropine plus propranolol the delta MF power was significantly lower compared to the unmedicated control and atropine group. There was no significant difference between diabetics and controls after combined autonomic blockade. It was concluded that delta MF heart rate spectral power could serve as an indirect, non-invasive, quantitative and sensitive marker of early cardiac sympathetic damage.", 
    "1": "Eight-six children (aged 20 days to 14 years, 20 under age 1 year) underwent 94 percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty for pulmonary valve stenosis. The patients were divided into three groups: typical pulmonary valve stenosis (71), pulmonary valve dysplasia (9), and residual stenosis after surgical valvotomy for pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIS) (6). Each of the three groups was divided into two subgroups. In the early cases, balloon catheters with diameter 10-20% exceeding pulmonary valve annulus were used and the drop of the gradient was 39.5%. In the later cases, balloon diameters 30-40% greater than the valve anulus or double balloons were used and a drop of 66.7% in the RV-PA pressure gradient was achieved. The dilation in patients with dysplastic valve and residual stenosis after surgical valvotomy for PAIS was less effective. Doppler echocardiography was the technique used to evaluate residual gradient. Six months to 4 years follow-up demonstrated a persistent decrease of the valve gradient.", 
    "2": "Studies were performed in unrestrained conscious Sprague-Dawley rats to examine the central nervous system (CNS) mechanism by which corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) produces simultaneous elevations of arterial pressure and heart rate. To test the hypothesis that CRF inhibits ongoing impulse transmission through and/or transmitter release from the CNS terminations of baroreceptor afferents, the cardiovascular effects of intracerebroventricular administration of CRF were compared in rats subjected to prior sham surgery (Sham) or sinoaortic denervation (SAD). Resting levels of arterial pressure and heart rate were elevated after SAD. In addition, SAD resulted in greater chronotropic sympathetic tone and reduced chronotropic parasympathetic tone as assessed by intravenous injections of atropine methyl nitrate and DL-propranolol. Intracerebroventricular administration of CRF in both surgical groups elicited significant increases in arterial pressure and heart rate, although a tendency for reduced tachycardic responses after SAD was apparent. Pretreatment with atropine or propranolol revealed that both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems contribute to CRF-induced heart rate responses in both surgical groups. These results suggest that ongoing baroreceptor afferent transmission is not requisite for the expression of CRF-induced cardiovascular changes. Thus it is unlikely that CRF elevates arterial pressure and heart rate through an exclusive action at the CNS terminations of baroreceptor sensory fibers.", 
    "3": "Smooth muscle strips representing longitudinal and circular muscle layers of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and esophageal body (EB) of the human esophagus were prepared. The strips were mounted in organ baths and isometric tension was recorded. Square wave stimulation was applied through platinum electrodes. Only responses abolished by tetrodotoxin (TTX) were considered neurogenic. Strips taken from longitudinal muscle layers of the EB and EGJ contracted during field stimulation. The responses evoked were abolished by atropine, and optimal frequency of stimulation was 40 Hz. In strips taken from the circular muscle layer of the EB, a contraction occurred after cessation of the stimulus. Atropine inhibited 90% of this response; the optimal stimulation frequency was 40 Hz. When a tone was induced in strips from this layer, a TTX-sensitive relaxation was seen during field stimulation. During stimulation of strips from the EGJ circular muscle layer, which was the only preparation developing spontaneous active tone, a relaxation was seen. A small contraction followed after termination of the stimulus. The relaxation, which was nonadrenergic, noncholinergic, reached maximum at 10 Hz. Atropine inhibited 40% of the contraction. The results suggest that in the longitudinal muscle layer of the human lower esophagus field stimulation causes postganglionic nerves to release transmitter(s) acting on muscarinic receptors. The responses of circular muscle layers seem to be mediated through release of at least two transmitters.", 
    "4": "A trauma victim sustained multiple injuries including cervical spine injuries, splenic laceration, and left kidney fracture. His recovery was complicated by acute renal failure, resistant hypertension, and tachycardia refractory to multiple therapies. The patient was ultimately managed with continuous infusions of labetalol 2-3 mg/min for 14 days, with adequate control of both blood pressure and heart rate. The sustained labetalol infusion was not associated with clinically significant adverse effects although a progressive decrease in heart rate was noted near the end of therapy. This downward trend in heart rate was not associated with hemodynamic compromise and returned to pretreatment baseline of 90-110 beats/min upon discontinuation of parenteral therapy and initiation of oral labetalol. The prolonged use of labetalol infusions may be beneficial in certain patients. Further work needs to be done to identify the safety and efficacy of labetalol infusions.", 
    "5": "Clinically, ischemic necrosis is one of the most common complications in skin flap surgery, but the etiology is still unclear. The objective of the present experiments was to study the important role of the locally released noradrenaline in the pathogenesis of ischemic necrosis in acute and delayed random pattern skin flaps (4 x 10 cm) raised on both flanks of the pig. In Experiment 1, it was observed that 93, 96, and 94% of the skin contents of noradrenaline were depleted in skin flaps delayed for 2, 4, and 14 days, respectively, compared to the acute skin flaps (n = 8) raised in the same pig. Although the maximum depletion of noradrenaline in the delayed flaps occurred within 2 days of delay, significant (P less than 0.001) increase in the length of dye penetration in the delayed skin flaps was seen after 2 days of delay, compared to the acute skin flaps (n = 12). In Experiments 2 and 3, 5 days of intravenous phenoxybenzamine treatment, starting 2 days preoperatively and at the doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/kg/day, did not have any significant effect on the skin blood flow (n = 24) or viability (1 mg/kg/day; n = 32) in the acute skin flaps compared with the saline-treated control. Similarly, 5 days of intravenous phentolamine treatment (5 mg/kg/day) also did not have any significant effect on the skin blood flow (n = 24) or viability (n = 32) of acute skin flaps compared with the control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "The adrenergic regulation of lipolysis was investigated in situ at rest and during standardized bicycle exercise in nonobese healthy subjects, using microdialysis of the extracellular space in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The glycerol concentration was about two times greater in adipose tissue than in venous blood. At rest, the glycerol concentration in adipose tissue was rapidly increased by 100% (P less than 0.01) after the addition of phentolamine to the ingoing perfusate, whereas addition of propranolol did not alter the adipose tissue glycerol level. Glycerol in adipose tissue and plasma increased during exercise and decreased in the postexercise period. Propranolol in the perfusate almost completely inhibited the increase in the tissue dialysate glycerol during the exercise-postexercise period. Phentolamine, however, was completely ineffective in this respect. During exercise, the lipolytic activity was significantly more marked in abdominal than in gluteal adipose tissue; this was much more apparent in women than in men. Thus, in vivo lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by different adrenergic mechanisms at rest and during exercise. Alpha-adrenergic inhibitory effects modulate lipolysis at rest, whereas beta-adrenergic stimulatory effects modulate lipolysis during exercise. In addition, regional differences in lipolysis are present in vivo during exercise, which seem governed by factors relating to sex.", 
    "7": "Isolated hepatocyte cultures have become a frequently used model system for investigating drug metabolism. Although rat and hamster hepatocytes are frequently used for this purpose, metabolism in these species differs in many respects from human metabolism. A species with a metabolism more closely resembling that of humans might be more useful. Our in vivo experiments demonstrated that the metabolism of propranolol in the rabbit is more similar to that in humans than in rats or hamsters. We therefore examined the usefulness of rabbit parenchymal liver cells for studies of propranolol metabolism. A detailed method is presented for their preparation and culture, along with data on their viability, structure and protein synthesizing capability. One- or two-day-old hepatocyte cultures were exposed to 10 mumol/L 3H-propranolol from 30 min to 2 hr; metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Propranolol metabolism was linear over 1 hr, with 15% of the substrate metabolized during this time. The cytochrome P-450 pathways, which result in ring oxidation and side-chain oxidation, were expressed in a reproducible fashion similar to that found in vivo in humans. The arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-naphthoflavone (100 mumol/L) inhibited side-chain oxidation of propranolol by 90% without affecting ring oxidation. In contrast, chlorpromazine (100 mumol/L) was shown to inhibit ring oxidation of propranolol by 85% without affecting side-chain oxidation. Cimetidine (250 mumol/L) inhibited both pathways by about 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "1. A single oral dose of dilevalol (200 mg or 400 mg) or placebo was administered to 15 normal male volunteers in a double-blind, random order crossover study. 2. Dilevalol had no significant effect on supine blood pressures or heart rates, but caused a significant fall in systolic blood pressure 1 and 30 min following standing, and attenuated the rise in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate that accompanies standing. 3. Dilevalol caused a dose dependent increase in plasma noradrenaline levels from arterialized blood which was due to an increase in noradrenaline spillover with no change in clearance. 4. Dilevalol increased plasma levels of the noradrenaline metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylene glycol (DHPG) (which is formed in sympathetic nerves following neuronal uptake of noradrenaline), indicating that the increase in noradrenaline spillover was not due to the blockade of neuronal uptake. 5. Acute dilevalol administration had no effect on total plasma cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol levels.", 
    "9": "The contribution of phospholipase D (PLD) to the production of phosphatidic acid (PA) and diglyceride (DG) by C5a-stimulated human neutrophils has been studied. Membrane-associated 1-O-alkyl-phosphatidylcholine (alkyl-PC) was double labeled with 3H and 32P by incubating neutrophils with [3H]alkyl-lysoPC and alkyl-[32P]lysoPC. Upon stimulation with recombinant C5a, these labeled neutrophils produce 1-O-alkyl-phosphatidic acid (alkyl-PA) and, in the presence of ethanol, 1-O-alkyl-phosphatidyl-ethanol (alkyl-PEt), containing both 3H and 32P. Formation of radiolabeled alkyl-PEt parallels that of radiolabeled alkyl-PA and requires both extracellular Ca2+ and cytochalasin B. Furthermore, the 3H/32P ratios of alkyl-PA and alkyl-PEt formed during stimulation are very similar to that of th substrate alkyl-PC. These results demonstrate that, in C5a-stimulated neutrophils, alkyl-PA and alkyl-PEt are formed from alkyl-PC almost exclusively by PLD-catalyzed hydrolysis and transphosphatidylation, respectively. Upon C5a stimulation, neutrophils labeled with 3H and 32P also produce 1-O-[3H]alkyl-diglyceride [( 3H]alkyl-DG) and [32P]orthophosphate [( 32P]PO4), but not [32P]phosphocholine. [3H]Alkyl-DG and [32P]PO4 are formed in parallel, although temporally lagging behind alkyl-PA. Propranolol, a PA phosphohydrolase (PPH) inhibitor, decreases the formation of both [3H]alkyl-DG and [32P]PO4, although increasing alkyl-PA accumulation. These data support the conclusion that alkyl-DG is formed from alkyl-PC by the combined activities of PLD and PPH and not by phospholipase C (PLC). Furthermore, by using [3H]acyl-PC-labeled neutrophils, it is demonstrated that, like alkyl-PC, 1-acyl-PC is also degraded sequentially by PLD and PPH to 1-acyl-DG. Propranolol does not inhibit phosphoinositide-specific PLC and yet it causes almost complete inhibition of the total DG mass accumulation in C5a-stimulated neutrophils. We conclude that, in cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils stimulated with C5a, PLD-catalyzed hydrolysis of PC determines the levels of both PA and DG with potentially important ramifications for neutrophil-mediated defense functions.", 
    "10": "One hundred nine patients with recurrent episodes of symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter, or both, who had failed one to five previous antiarrhythmic drug trials were treated with propafenone and, subsequently, sotalol if atrial fibrillation recurred. The clinical profile of the study group was as follows: age 63 +/- 13 years, left atrial anteroposterior dimension 4.4 +/- 0.9 cm and left ventricular ejection fraction 57 +/- 14%. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation occurred in 56 patients (51%) and chronic atrial fibrillation occurred in 53 patients (49%). After loading and dose titration phases were completed, the maintenance doses of drugs were 450 to 900 mg/day for propafenone and 160 to 960 mg/day for sotalol. Life table estimates of the duration of freedom from atrial fibrillation were constructed for each drug trial. The percent of patients free of recurrent symptomatic arrhythmia at 6 months was 39% for propafenone and 50% for sotalol. The cumulative proportion of patients successfully treated with propafenone or sotalol, or both, by 6 months was 55% and remained relatively constant beyond that point. The incidence of intolerable side effects necessitating discontinuation of therapy ranged from 7% to 8%. Thus, despite previous unsuccessful drug trials, a substantial proportion of patients with recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation refractory to conventional therapy can be treated successfully and safely with newer antiarrhythmic drugs. Treatment failures tend to occur early in the course of follow-up, permitting easy identification of candidates for alternative therapeutic approaches.", 
    "11": "The efficacy of diazepam, haloperidol, propranolol, and yohimbine in antagonizing the toxic manifestations of d-amphetamine were studied in rats. In the control group of animals given 75 mg/kg intraperitoneal (ip) d-amphetamine, 95% developed seizures, and 100% died in mean times of 12.6 +/- 1.0 and 50.1 +/- 5.9 minutes, respectively. Significant protection against d-amphetamine-induced death was afforded by pretreatment with haloperidol (1.0 to 20.0 mg/kg) or propranolol (20.0 to 30.0 mg/kg). Diazepam (5.0 to 10.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced the incidence of clinically overt seizures but offered no protection against death. Yohimbine (2.5 to 10.0 mg/kg) was ineffective in preventing either seizures or death. When haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg) was administered in combination with diazepam (2.0 mg/kg), the incidence of death was no different than if haloperidol were given alone. In combination, haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg) and propranolol (10.0 mg/kg) reduced death more than either agent alone. These data support a protective role of haloperidol or propranolol in the treatment of d-amphetamine intoxication and show no protection with diazepam or yohimbine.", 
    "12": "dl-Propranolol (Pro), known to have spermicidal effect, was evaluated for its ability to influence capacitation, the acrosome reaction (AR) and fertilization of guinea pig spermatozoa at non-spermicidal dose levels. A concentration-dependent decrease in AR and the whiplashed motility occurred in Pro as low as 0.05 mmol/L. Pro 1.0 mmol/L completely abolished AR, followed by the loss of sperm capacity to penetrate into zona-free hamster egg. Pro exerted its inhibitory effect of AR primarily by restraining the capacitation stage of sperm but at Pro 0.5 mmol/L by blocking both capacitation and AR stages. % of AR of sperm preincubated with ionophore A-23187 0.2 mumol/L was significantly higher than that of the control, but markedly lower at Pro greater than or equal to mmol/L, implying that Pro prevented sperm Ca2+ influx. Prenylamine was also found to inhibit AR potentially and enhance the action of Pro against ionophore A-23187. Furthermore, Pro inhibition of the fertilizing ability of preincubated spermatozoa was antagonized by cAMP. Pro 0.5 mmol/L even caused the egg vesiculation. The reversibility of the action depends on the dose and time of sperm exposure to Pro. These findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of Pro on guinea pig sperm capacitation, the acrosome reaction and fertilization may be the mechanisms for its antifertility action.", 
    "13": "3,4,5-Trihydroxystibene-3-beta-mono-D-glucoside (PD) from Polygonum cuspidatum 0.05-0.45 mmol/L increased beat rate of myocardial cells from 100% to 112-220%. This action of PD 0.15 mmol/L was agonized by nisoldipine 0.1, propranolol 10 and phentolamine 1 mumol/L. PD (0.05, 0.15 mmol/L) decreased the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) amount liberated by myocardial cells, from 98 +/- 11 IU/ml of deprivation of oxygen and glucose (DOG) to 55 +/- 16, 68 +/- 14 IU/ml (P less than 0.01) 6 h after injury of DOG; 77 +/- 9, 80 +/- 6 IU/ml (P less than 0.01) 9 h after injury of DOG. PD 0.15 mmol/L decreased the LDH amount liberated by myocardial cells, from 311 +/- 34 to 231 +/- 42 IU/ml (P less than 0.05) 9 h after injury of chlorpromazine (CPZ). It is suggested that PD can protect myocardial cells injured by DOG and CPZ.", 
    "14": "Relaxing responses of strips of rabbit pulmonary artery (RPA) with endothelium (+E) to norepinephrine (NE) during sustained contraction with KCl 20 mmol/L in the presence of propranolol (Pro) 10 mumol/L and prazosin (Pra) 1 mumol/L were more sensitive than those without endothelium (-E) to NE. These responses were inhibited by yohimbine (Yoh) 1 mumol/L. However, the relaxing responses of the strips to clonidine (Clo) were not different between RPA strips +E and -E in the presence of Pro+ Pra or Pro + Pra + Yoh 1 mumol/L. Relaxing responses of RPA strips -E precontracted by phenylephrine (PE) 1 mumol/L to Pra and Clo were greater than that of those precontracted by KCl 20 mmol/L. The relaxing responses of these strips precontracted by PE to Pra were larger than those precontracted by PE mumol/L; but that of those precontracted by PE and Clo to Yoh were not different. The results suggest that integrity of the endothelium is an important factor in the relaxing responses of RPA strips to NE. The relaxing effect of Clo on RPA strips precontracted by KCl 20 mmol/L may be due to alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade on smooth muscle cells of the RPA strips.", 
    "15": "Aim of the study was to evaluate blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) variability during isometric handgrip test (IHT) in 20 ambulant non-obese male adults affected by sustained hypertension (SH) WHO I and II, 20 borderline hypertensive (BH) and 20 normotensives (C) of comparable sex, age and BMI. SBP and DBP were assessed by \"Random Zero\" sphygmomanometer, HR by ECG registration. IHT was performed at 30% of maximal effort for 3 min. IHT was carried out: 1) after 7 days placebo, 2) after 7 days propranolol treatment (80 mg/day) and, following 10 days wash-out, 3) after 7 days prazosin treatment (0.5 mg/day). After placebo IHT caused increases of SBP, DBP and HR values insignificantly different in the 3 groups. After propranolol IHT induced significantly more elevated SBP and DBP increases in SH than in BH or in C. These increases were significantly more elevated in comparison with those observed, in advance, in the same group of SH subjects after placebo. After prazosin treatment SBP increase induced by IHT was, on the contrary, significantly more elevated in BH than in SH or in C. This increase is more significant in comparison with that observed in the same BH group after placebo treatment. As for DBP variations induced by IHT after alpha sympatholytic therapy we have observed that SH subjects show significantly lesser diastolic variations as compared with those obtained in BH or in C groups after this treatment. In conclusion, enhanced IHT induced SBP elevation after propranolol and dampened DBP reactivity after prazosin suggest an overriding alpha stimulation in SH subjects. SBP hyperreactivity induced by IHT after alpha sympatholytic treatment and DBP hyporeactivity after betablockers emphasize the role of beta stimulation in BH individuals. Inhibition of BP reactivity to IHT in C after prazosin suggest that this one is mediated by alpha adrenergic receptors.", 
    "16": "A randomized double-blind study of aqueous humor flow and intraocular pressure measurements before and four hours after instillation of placebo and beta-blocker eyedrops, was carried out in 40 hypertensive patients. The treated and non-treated patients either did or didn't show an optic disc excavation and a visual field defect. Hypertensive patients with a previous tension treatment will stop therapy on a 3-week period up to an increase of their own ocular tension value greater than or equal to 3 mmHg. The intraocular pressure statistically decreased of 20.8% four hours after topical placebo, the aqueous humor flow remaining unchanged. In this study, timolol eyedrops induced a greater decrease of the aqueous humor flow (39%), followed equally by betaxolol (23.8%) and carteolol (20.42%). Timolol and betaxolol eyedrops equally induced a significant decrease of the intraocular pressure. There was no effect of carteolol on the intraocular pressure. The outflow facility was independent of the instilled beta-blocker eyedrop.", 
    "17": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of 6 weeks treatment with hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol on gastric acid and gastrin secretion in essential hypertension. The study was carried out in 10 patients receiving propranolol and 10 treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Acid and gastrin secretion were determined during histamine stimulation tests (Kay's test). Before the treatment the patients with essential hypertension were not significantly different from healthy controls with respect to acid secretion and gastrinemia profile after histamine stimulus. In both groups of patients no significant effect was observed of hypotensive treatment on basal acid output, but a significant inhibitory effect on gastrin secretion was noted. This effect was significantly greater in patients treated with propranolol than in the hydrochlorothiazide group. Moreover, in propranolol-treated patients a significant fall of histamine-induced acid secretion was found.", 
    "18": "Thirty patients were evaluated in a blind fashion to study the effect of oral propranolol on portal hypertension of varied aetiology. The dose of oral propranolol (administered to 15 patients) was adjusted to reduce the resting heart rate by approximately 25%. Splenic pulp pressure served as the parameter for portal pressure. A matched group of 15 control subjects on placebo was also studied. The mean portal pressure in the propranolol group fell from 3.49 to 2.69 kPa saline (P less than 0.001) as compared to the control group where the mean pressure increased from 3.57 to 3.63 kPa saline. The propranolol group showed improvement in clinical symptomatology with a significant reduction in body weight and abdominal girth in patients with ascites. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.78; p less than 0.007) was obtained between the fall in portal pressure and the initial levels. Thus, oral propranolol proved useful in the conservative management of portal hypertension of varied aetiology.",

The response of blood pressure to isoptin and obsidan was virtually identical, yet isoptin acted longer. When obsidan was administered, there was a decrease in specific peripheral vascular resistance with a stepwise elevation of blood pressure, whereas isoptin promoted its slight rise with maximally elevated blood pressure. Isoptin administration prevented brain hyperperfusion at maximum blood pressures.",

The examination was made in 591 patients with large myocardial infarction. A significant decrease in mortality rates was seen in patients on finoptin and phosphocreatine (by 9.6 and 11.2, respectively) as compared to the expected drop.

    "21": "To stabilize weak and medium-severity progressive myopia, instillations of cycloplegics (homatropin or tropicamid) and of hypotensive agents (clofelin or thymolol) were administered into the conjunctival cavity once a day (at bedtime). The course of treatment lasted 30 days and was repeated every 2-3 months. Complete stabilization of myopia was achieved in 65-58% of cases, as evidenced by a follow-up of 3 years, on an average. Incomplete stabilization of the condition was observed in 35-42% of patients, the annual progress gradient being above 0.15 diopters. Simultaneously an accumulation of the relative accommodation reserves was observed, by 38.3% on an average, and a resolution of asthenopia. In a reference group of 50 subjects (100 eyes) spontaneous stabilization took place in 27% of cases, the relative accommodation reserve being unchanged.", 
    "22": "Sixty two black patients who had confirmed but untreated hypertension participated in a double blind clinical trial of the efficacy and tolerability of slow-release oxprenolol in a daily dose of 160 mg initially and 320 mg subsequently versus chlorthalidone 50 mg daily. Thereafter, a combination of oxprenolol with chlorthalidone in an initial dose of 160 mg and 25 mg and a subsequent dose of 320 mg and 50 mg, respectively, was administered and the effects compared with those of the same drugs given singly. The trial lasted for 3 years, but each participant took active medication for 1 year. Oxprenolol as monotherapy had no effect on the blood pressure, irrespective of the dose. Chlorthalidone as monotherapy produced a significant fall in blood pressure (p less than 0.01). Combining the 2 drugs enhanced their blood pressure lowering effects (p less than 0.001). Oxprenolol as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy was well tolerated by all patients. Chlorthalidone as monotherapy was well tolerated by most patients while a fraction of the patients developed biochemical derangements. These results confirm the findings that a beta-blocker alone may be ineffective in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive blacks. The results also show that the efficacy and tolerability of a beta-blocker and a diuretic are enhanced by their combined administration. Finally, the results show that increasing the dose of a beta-blocker or a diuretic does not produce a further increase in its blood pressure lowering effect.", 
    "23": "1. Electrical stimulation of the cervical vagi (15 Hz, 0.2 ms, 3 s, 7-15 V) produced a slight bronchoconstriction in the anaesthetized guinea-pig. This effect was fully abolished by atropine, while gallamine (0.1-10 mumol kg-1) produced a dose-dependent increase up to ten fold. 2. Gallamine-induced potentiation of neurally-mediated bronchoconstriction was not inhibited by depletion of sensory neuropeptides with capsaicin or by pretreatment with pyrilamine. In propranolol-pretreated guinea-pigs the potentiation induced by gallamine 3 and 10 mumol kg-1 was inhibited by 40 and 46%, respectively. 3. Physostigmine (0.5 mg kg-1) produced a very slight and slowly developing bronchoconstriction in the anaesthetized guinea-pig, which was also potentiated dose-dependently by gallamine (0.1-10 mumol kg-1). 4. Gallamine (10 mumol kg-1) potentiated the bronchial anaphylactic response induced by aerosol challenge with ovalbumin in actively sensitized guinea-pigs. 5. These results suggest that neither sensory neuropeptides nor histamine are involved in the gallamine-induced potentiation of neurally-mediated bronchoconstriction, while inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system may play a minor role. They are in general agreement with the hypothesis that gallamine antagonizes acetylcholine selectively at prejunctional muscarinic receptors in the guinea-pig airways, thus increasing its release from parasympathetic nerve terminals. These autoreceptors appear to be operant during anaphylactic bronchoconstriction.", 
    "24": "This trial was carried out to assess the value of propranolol for the prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding in patients with well-compensated cirrhosis. We also compared propranolol therapy to long-term injection sclerotherapy. One hundred and eight patients, in whom the original variceal hemorrhage stopped spontaneously (before diagnostic endoscopy) and without sclerotherapy or surgical intervention, were included. All were Pugh grade A or B; 55% had alcoholic cirrhosis. Patients were chosen randomly to receive oral propranolol (in a dosage to reduce resting pulse rate by 25%) or to undergo long-term injection sclerotherapy. In both groups, episodes of repeat bleeding that did not stop spontaneously were managed with sclerotherapy. Patients considered to have failed propranolol therapy were treated with long-term sclerotherapy. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 64 mo. In the propranolol group, 28 (54%) of the 52 patients had repeat bleeding from varices with a total of 57 episodes; 14 received long-term sclerotherapy. In the sclerotherapy group, 25 (45%) of the 56 patients had repeat bleeding, with a total of 40 episodes (p less than 0.20). On an intention-to-treat basis, the risk of bleeding expressed per patient-month of follow-up was similar for the two groups, at 0.05 and 0.037, respectively. Survival as assessed by cumulative life analysis was also similar, with 55% and 66% alive at 3 yr (p less than 0.40). Stepwise regression analysis of possible factors predicting further bleeding in patients taking propranolol selected only two variables--the pretreatment pulse rate and the extent of pulse-rate reduction in response to propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Betaxolol is a new, highly cardioselective, once-a-day beta blocker with a long half-life (mean 16 hours). The antianginal efficacy of 2 doses of betaxolol (20 and 40 mg) given once daily was evaluated and compared with propranolol (40 or 80 mg) 4 times daily. Ninety-two patients completed the 10-week double-blind trial. The resting and exercise heart rate, blood pressure and double product were similar for all treatment arms of the study during placebo treatment. Significant decreases in these measures occurred during active drug treatment when compared with placebo. No significant intergroup differences were noted at rest. Maximal exercise heart rate and double product were significantly lower during treatment with betaxolol 40 mg daily than in the propranolol 40 mg 4 times/day treatment group (p less than 0.05). All patients had chest pain and greater than or equal to 1 mm of ST-segment depression during the baseline placebo exercise test. After 10 weeks of active treatment, 55% of the patients were free of chest pain during maximal exercise (difference not significant between treatments). In the betaxolol 40 mg/day group, fewer (6 of 19; 32%) of the patients developed ST-segment depression with exercise (p less than 0.05) compared with propranolol 80 mg 4 times daily (21 of 26; 81%). Betaxolol appears to be a useful once-a-day cardioselective beta blocker for the therapy of angina pectoris.", 
    "26": "The effects of ephedrine (Eph) were compared with those of tyramine (Tyr) and phenylephrine (Phe) in ring segments of guinea pig portal vein in vitro. Eph (3-1000 mumol/L), Tyr (10-1000 mumol/L) and Phe (1-1000 mumol/L) all produced concentration-dependent contractile responses, which were exceedingly depressed by alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine (31 mumol/L). Pretreatment with reserpine 1 mg/(kg.d) x 2 d markedly diminished the effect of Tyr, but greatly potentiated the effects of Eph and Phe. Both Eph (1-30 mumol/L) and Tyr (10-100 mumol/L), but not Phe, significantly increased the electrical field stimulation (duration 2 ms, 3 Hz, 10 s, 50 V, 10 min intervals) evoked contractions of the portal veins. beta-Adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (0.5 mumol/L) greatly inhibited this effect of Eph, without affecting that of Tyr. It is suggested that the effect of Tyr is mainly due to its release of endogenous norepinephrine (NE) from the nerve terminals; conversely, Eph mainly bcts on postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors directly with some NE-releasing action which may involve the activation of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "27": "Functional significance of beta-adrenoreceptors located at cholinergic interneurons of myenteric plexus was confirmed for motor responses to exogenous and endogenous acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine and bradykinin. A specific mechanism of the activation of small intestine's contractile apparatus by sympathoadrenal system seems to exist in the organism.", 
    "28": "The density of beta-adrenergic receptors was examined in heart, muscle (m. longissimus dorsi) and backfat tissue of German Landrace pigs using (-)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol. The animals were selected for high (E(+)-line) or low (E(-)-line) activity of lipogenic enzymes in backfat and for low backfat thickness (U(-)-line) based on ultrasonic measurement. An unselected control (K0-line) also exists. The correlated selection response on stress susceptibility (measured by halothane reaction and by meat quality parameters) showed the following sequence of selection lines: U- greater than E- greater than E+ greater than K0. The strains used for examination descended from the 9th generation (heart and muscle tissue) and the 10th generation (heart, muscle and adipose tissue) of this selection experiment. No further selection took place between the 9th and 10th generation. Basal adenylate cyclase activity was determined as well as (-)-Isoproterenol + GTP or sodium fluoride (NaF) stimulated activity in heart and muscle of the 10th generation measuring [3H]-cAMP formation from [3H]-ATP. A good correlation (r greater than or equal to 0.59, n = 9) between beta-adrenergic receptor density and adenylate cyclase activity was found which pointed to an efficient receptor-effector system. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activity was higher in the U(-)-line in all investigated tissues compared to the other lines in the 9th and 10th generation. Most differences between these lines were also significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The beta-adrenoceptors are now well individualized. They are divided into three distinct units: the receptor site, a regulating protein and a catalytic unit. The receptor density of the cell membrane varies according to the degree of stimulation of the receptor by agonists or the degree of blockade by antagonists. The myocardial or lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptor density is measured by \"radioreceptor\" assay using a radioactive beta-blocker. The myocardial beta-receptor density falls during heart failure, mainly to the detriment of beta 1 receptors. The density of beta 2 receptors remains unchanged. This fall in beta 1 receptors is related to the increase in the circulating catecholamines (down regulation) and is proportional to the severity of the disease. These physiological and physiopathological consequences can be directly applied to the treatment of heart failure by positive inotopic drugs or by beta-blockers.", 
    "30": "The racemate (+/-) and the two enantiomers of sotalol were studied with regard to the effects on cardiac repolarization. In addition, the affinity to cardiac beta-adrenoceptors was investigated for the enantiomers. The effect on left ventricular monophasic action potential duration was assessed in the isolated perfused guinea-pig heart and the beta-adrenoceptor affinity of the compounds was studied, using a radioligand binding technique, in cellular membranes prepared from the left ventricular free wall of the cat. Moreover, the beta-adrenoceptor blocking potency of (+)-sotalol was studied in isolated strips of guinea-pig papillary muscles. Both the racemate and the two enantiomers of sotalol caused a concentration-dependent prolongation of the ventricular monophasic action potential duration. The maximal effect and the concentration causing half maximal effect (EC50 = 13 mumol/l) were similar for the racemate and the enantiomers, indicating lack of stereoselectivity for this effect. The beta-adrenoceptor affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant) of (+)-sotalol was 11 mumol/l and 4 mumol/l as estimated by the binding technique and in the isolated muscle strips, respectively. The affinity for (-)-sotalol, estimated by binding, was 0.6 mumol/l. Thus, at concentrations of (+)-sotalol required for a significant prolongation of cardiac repolarization, this isomer may cause significant beta-blockade. In this study the enantiomeric purity was better than 98%, so that the degree of beta-blockade may be even more pronounced if the enantiomeric purity of the (+)-enantiomer is less than 98%.", 
    "31": "Cell bodies in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) mediate stress-induced increases in renin and corticosterone secretion. Since the PVN has an extensive catecholaminergic innervation, we wanted to determine the role of catecholamines in the neuroendocrine response to stress. The stressor was a conditioned emotional (fear) response paradigm (CER). The catecholamine neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), was injected into the PVN 14 days before the rats were subjected to the CER procedure. Damage to noradrenergic nerve terminals was verified immunocytochemically, using an antibody against dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Injection of 6-OHDa into the PVN prevented the stress-induced increase in plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma renin concentration (PRC) and plasma corticosterone concentration, suggesting that intact catecholaminergic innervation of neurons in the PVN is necessary for the stress-induced increase in renin and corticosterone secretion. To determine if beta-adrenoceptors in the PVN mediate the effect of stress on renin and corticosterone secretion, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol was injected into the PVN through chronically implanted bilateral cannulae. The injection was performed on the 4th day of the CER paradigm, just before the rats were placed into the CER chamber. Sotalol prevented the stress-induced increase in corticosterone concentration, but did not diminish the stress-induced increase in PRA and PRC. These results suggest that the stress-induced increase in corticosterone concentration is influenced by beta-adrenoceptors in the PVN. The stress-induced increase in PRA and PRC is mediated by different receptors whose ligands might be catecholamines acting at non-beta-receptors or other neuroactive substances colocalized in catecholaminergic nerve terminals.", 
    "32": "A defect in the beta-adrenergic system is considered to be one of the basal causes of atopic dermatitis (AD). The number and affinity (KD) of beta-receptors was determined in lymphocytes of 19 children with AD and of 17 controls using the radioligand 125JCYP to find out whether this hypothesis is relevant. In addition, the basal cAMP level was measured as well as the cAMP-accumulation after stimulation of the adenylcyclase (AC) via the beta-receptor with 10(-4) M isoprenaline (IPN) and after direct stimulation of AC with 10(-4) M forskolin. Receptor quality and receptor quantity were compared to the severity of AD. A statistically significant difference between AD and control children was not registered for the following parameters: receptor-density, affinity for 125ICYP, cAMP-accumulation after adenylcyclase stimulation via the beta-receptor with IPN or after direct stimulation with forskolin. The increase in cAMP after IPN or forskolin was in the same range for children suffering from AD as for controls. Only the basal cAMP was significantly lower. Three patients with very severe AD (greater than 20% body surface area) had a significantly reduced number of beta-receptors (603 +/- 123 BS/Ly) compared with the control group (1142 +/- 112 BS/Ly). A linear relation existed between age, receptor density and isoprenaline-mediated cAMP accumulation for both control children and those with AD. This age-dependent response of the beta-receptor seems to be specific as cAMP-accumulation after stimulation with forskolin was not age-related.", 
    "33": "The intent of the present series of experiments was to better understand the events that produce a rapid adaptation of beta adrenergic and serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptors when imipramine treatment and forced swim are combined in Sprague-Dawley rats. Beta adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptors were evaluated at specific stages of the forced swim test with and without imipramine treatment. Rapid changes in receptor binding were observed in saline-treated rats during specific stages of the test. The changes observed during forced swim could not be attributed to the transport-novelty that occurs during forced swim. Binding for both monoamine receptors was reduced in hippocampus and frontal cortex before the test swim in imipramine-treated rats as they were 10 min, 3 hr and 24 hr after the test swim. The increase in corticosterone induced by the second forced swim was not altered by imipramine, indicating that imipramine was not interfering with this measure of the stress response. In the Fisher-344 rat strain, imipramine did not produce a behavioral change during the test swim. In contrast to this lack of a behavioral change in the Fischer-344 rats, beta adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptor down-regulation was facilitated in this rat strain, similar to that found in imipramine-treated Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to swim. This latter finding suggests that beta adrenergic or 5-HT2 receptor adaptation alone is insufficient to cause an imipramine-induced behavioral change in the swim test. Studies with specific norepinephrine- and serotonin-uptake inhibitors, nisoxetine and fluoxetine, respectively, indicate that the behavioral effects of imipramine in the forced swim test are dependent upon norepinephrine uptake inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "Chronic administration of isoproterenol caused major changes in the molecular and functional characteristics of lung beta adrenoceptors. The dose of isoproterenol delivered by the minipumps over 7 days corresponded to approximately 60 micrograms.kg-1h-1. The agonist treatment produced an 80% decrease in the number of beta adrenoceptors in lung membranes. However, a significant proportion of the remaining receptors could still form complexes with the nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) in the presence of agonist. This was demonstrated by the persistence of high affinity sites (42% versus 53% in controls, P less than .01) in isoproterenol competition binding curves and of the tight binding of isoproterenol in the presence of the reagent N-ethylmaleimide (44% versus 60% in controls, P less than .01). However, part of the receptor population displaying high affinity toward the agonist was insensitive to guanosine 5'-triphosphate. These changes were associated with a decrease in the Gs activity, as demonstrated by the lower degree of cholera toxin-mediated adenosine diphosphate ribosylation. Moreover, chronic against treatment caused a 50% reduction in the maximal relaxing effect of isoproterenol in the isolated lung parenchymal strip, whereas the tissue sensitivity to beta adrenoceptor stimulation was unchanged. It is concluded that chronic administration of isoproterenol to guinea pigs caused marked changes in beta adrenoceptor function in the lung tissue. The molecular events involved in beta adrenoceptor desensitization by chronic in vivo administration of relatively low catecholamine doses appear to differ from those reported for cultured cells, as well as those mediated by acute in vivo catecholamine administration.", 
    "35": "Rats submitted to a protein deprivation schedule from the perinatal period until 50 d of age (dams and/or rats fed an 8% casein diet) and then fed a commercial nonpurified diet for at least 90 d were assayed to evaluate the up- and down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in brain structures following prolonged (7 d) treatment with propranolol or desipramine, drugs that induce changes in receptor density. Propranolol produced up-regulation (increased Bmax) in the frontal cortex of both control and deprived animals, whereas desipramine treatment did not induce down-regulation in the frontal cortex or hippocampus of experimental rats, as it did in control rats. The lack of the down-regulation effect in response to desipramine treatment in deprived rats may be an alteration of adaptive mechanisms, which may contribute to the behavioral abnormalities attributed to early undernutrition.", 
    "36": "Transcorneal iontophoresis of adrenergic agents has been shown to reactivate latent herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and to produce viral shedding in the tear film in rabbits and mice, but not, to date, in nonhuman primates. In this study, we demonstrated induced reactivation of latent HSV-1, viral shedding, and production of ocular lesions in nine squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) by iontophoresis of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-HD) with topical instillation of epinephrine or with iontophoresis of timolol. Monkey corneas were scarified and inoculated with McKrae strain HSV-1 on three separate occasions. All monkeys received daily intramuscular prednisolone for 39 or 46 days prior to ionotophoresis. Once latency was established, a single ionotphoresis of 6-HD was performed on both eyes in five of the monkeys, followed by 1% epinephrine given topically four times daily for 5 days. Iontophoresis of timolol was performed on both eyes in the other four monkeys once per day on 3 consecutive days. Eight of the ten eyes receiving 6-HD and epinephrine shed HSV-1; seven eyes developed deep punctate, dendritic, or geographic corneal lesions. Seven of the eight eyes receiving timolol shed HSV-1; six of the eyes developed lesions suggestive of HSV-1 specific corneal lesions. The methods used in this report were slightly different from those used to reactivate HSV-1 in rabbits, in that repeated inoculations with HSV-1 and repeated intramuscular injections with prednisolone were required; however, these results demonstrate that iontophoresis of adrenergic agents can produce shedding and recurrent epithelial lesions in the nonhuman primate.", 
    "37": "Few models of heart failure (HF) are available for physiological and pharmacological studies. We report here a model of pressure plus volume overload induced in rabbits in which left ventricular (LV) function was studied in the conscious state after instrumentation of the animals with LV pressure catheter and ultrasonic crystals measuring LV diameter. Beta-Adrenoceptors were studied on crude membranes obtained from control (C) and HF rabbits using [3H]CGP 12177. LV weights and end-diastolic diameters were significantly increased in the HF group compared with the C group (by 79 and 38%, respectively). The percentage of diameter systolic shortening was decreased, in the control state, in rabbits with HF (15.3 +/- 1.6%) as compared with C rabbits (29.6 +/- 2.5%) and remained lower in the HF group when end-systolic pressures were matched. Chronotropic response to isoproterenol injection was significantly decreased in rabbits with HF compared with that of C rabbits. Beta-Adrenergic receptor density was decreased in rabbits with HF (39.3 +/- 3.7 fmol/mg) compared with C rabbits (56.7 +/- 4.2 fmol/mg) without affinity changes. This model of chronic HF thus produces a marked hypertrophy with ventricular dilatation and a depression of LV function within 2 mo, factors that are associated with a reduced cardiac responsiveness to catecholamines and a decreased ventricular beta-adrenergic receptor density.", 
    "38": "To investigate the mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmia suppression by propranolol, we determined the antiarrhythmic efficacy of d-propranolol in 10 patients with frequent ventricular ectopic depolarizations (VEDs) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. After an initial placebo phase, 40 mg d-propranolol was administered orally every 6 h with dosage increased every 2 d until arrhythmia suppression (greater than or equal to 80% VED reduction), intolerable side effects, or a maximal dosage (1,280 mg/d) was reached. Response was verified by documenting return of arrhythmia during a final placebo phase. Arrhythmia suppression occurred in six patients while two more had partial responses. Effective dosages were 320-1,280 mg/d (mean 920 +/- 360, SD) of d-propranolol with corresponding plasma concentrations of 60-2,280 ng/ml (mean 858 +/- 681). For the entire group, the QTc interval shortened by 4 +/- 4% (P = 0.03). Arrhythmia suppression was accompanied by a reduction in peak heart rate during exercise of 0-29%. To determine whether arrhythmia suppression could be attributed to beta-blockade, racemic propranolol was then administered in dosages producing the same or greater depression of exercise heart rate. In 3/8 patients, arrhythmias were not suppressed by racemic propranolol indicating that d-propranolol was effective via a non-beta-mediated action. By contrast, in 5/8 patients racemic propranolol also suppressed VEDs. We conclude that propranolol suppresses ventricular arrhythmias by both beta- and non-beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated effects.", 
    "39": "1. The effect of tachycardia on right atrial pressure (RAP) and dimensions (RAD) and plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (IR-ANF) was examined in anaesthetized rabbits before and after the administration of atenolol. 2. Small increases in plasma IR-ANF occurred during pacing at 6 Hz and after the administration of atenolol (0.4 mg kg-1). A significantly greater increase in IR-ANF occurred during pacing in the presence of atenolol. 3. Despite a significant rise in mean RAP, systolic RAD (SRAD) and diastolic RAD (DRAD) did not change during tachycardia. Systolic RAD increased after the administration of atenolol while both SRAD and DRAD increased during pacing in the presence of atenolol. 4. Systolic right atrial wall stress (SRAS) increased during tachycardia, did not change after the administration of atenolol, and increased during pacing in the presence of atenolol. Minute SRAS followed a similar pattern of changes except that it decreased after atenolol. 5. Diastolic right atrial wall stress (DRAS) did not change during tachycardia, and increased both after atenolol and after pacing in the presence of atenolol. Tachycardia led to an increase in minute DRAS; a significantly greater increase in minute DRAS occurred during tachycardia in the presence of atenolol. 6. The absence of alterations in RAD during tachycardia suggests that the release of ANF in response to tachycardia is not due to simple mechanical stretch of the atria. Both systolic and diastolic atrial wall stress may be determinants of ANF release: the influence of systolic factors appears to predominate during tachycardia while diastolic factors appear to be the major determinants of the effects of atenolol.", 
    "40": "To define the physiological signals involved in the redirection of myosin expression in the swim-exercised rat, the relative influence of thyroid hormones and beta-adrenergic blockade was determined. Swimming exercise resulted in an increased proportion of myosin V1 (60.9 +/- 9.7 vs. 38.0 +/- 4.1% of sedentary rats fed ad libitum) but did not increase serum concentrations of total and free thyroxine or triiodothyronine determined either 17-21 h or immediately after swimming. The proportion of V1 increased, although intermittently food-deprived rats with the body weight of swimming rats exhibited a reduced proportion of V1 (23.5 +/- 2.7). When swimming rats had only intermittent access to food, they had reduced concentrations of all thyroid hormones, but the proportion of V1 (51.5 +/- 7.6) was nonetheless increased. Thus the redirection of myosin expression cannot be attributed to an increased secretion of thyroid hormones. The influence of the adrenergic system was assessed by treating swimming rats with the beta-blocking drug atenolol. Because the proportion of V1 was reduced, but thyroid hormones were not affected, beta-adrenergic blockade seems to influence myosin expression independently of thyroid hormones.", 
    "41": "During perinatal development, when the size of the Sertoli cell population is determined, Leydig cells produce beta-endorphin, a peptide which may interact with Sertoli cells to modify their FSH-responsiveness, as suggested by our previous work. The goal of the present study was first, to test directly the possibility that beta-endorphin modifies the proliferative response of neonatal Sertoli cells to FSH, and second, to gain information on a mechanism(s) involved in any observed effect. We treated isolated 6-day-old Sertoli cells with FSH or vehicle in vitro and measured their incorporation of exogenous, radiolabeled thymidine with quantitative autoradiography. After 2 days in culture with FSH, we detected a 10-fold increase in the rate of Sertoli cell proliferation. The level of cell division in these FSH-treated cultures was identical to that in other cultures exposed to cAMP under similar conditions. In addition, inclusion of beta-endorphin 3 hr prior to FSH or cAMP decreased the effect of the hormone by 50% but left the cAMP response unchanged. Thus, beta-endorphin acts on isolated, neonatal Sertoli cells at a point prior to intracellular production of cAMP to suppress their response to FSH. When other cultures were treated with pertussis toxin, a blocker of intracellular GTP-binding proteins such as Gi, before sequential addition of endorphin and FSH, the effect of beta-endorphin on FSH-responsiveness was abolished. Moreover, when other cultures were exposed to pertussis toxin in the absence of endorphin, followed by FSH, their response to the hormone was unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "The 5-HT1A partial agonists, buspirone, ipsapirone and gepirone did not affect the latency to respond in the tail flick test to heat. However, they strongly attenuated the antinociceptive action of the mu-opioids, morphine and sufentanil. The buspirone metabolite, 1-(2-pyrimidyl)pyridine (1-PP) was ineffective. BMY 7378, spiperone and alprenolol, putative antagonists at 5-HT1A sites, did not modify basal latencies or the action of morphine. TFMPP and mCPP, agonists at 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C sites, also did not affect basal latencies or morphine induced antinociception. These data show that 5-HT1A partial agonists attenuate morphine-evoked antinociception without affecting basal thresholds. They represent an interesting aspect of the interaction between opioids and serotonin in the control of nociception. In addition to opioids (Millan, 1986), serotonin (5-HT) is considered to play a major role in the control of pain and in the expression of opioid analgesia (Roberts, 1984). The identification of a multiplicity of binding sites for 5-HT in the CNS (Fozard, 1987) raises the question of their individual roles in nociceptive processes. The 5-HT1A site is of particular interest since it is present in high concentrations in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Daval, Verge, Basbaum, Bourgoin, and Hamon, 1987) and there are conflicting reports that it may mediate analgesia or hyperalgesia (Berge, Fasmer, Ogren, and Hole, 1985, Zemlan, Kow, and Pfaff, 1983). Indeed, the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, was reported to attenuate morphine-evoked antinociception in mice (Berge et al., 1985).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "We studied the effect of topical timolol maleate 0.5% on the retinal circulation of eyes with ocular hypertension using laser Doppler velocimetry and monochromatic fundus photography. Patients with ocular hypertension had normal eye examinations and had documented elevated intraocular pressures of 23 mmHg or higher on two or more separate occasions. In a double-masked randomized design, one eye of each subject received timolol maleate 0.5% and the fellow eye received placebo. Vessel diameter, maximum velocity of red blood cells, and volumetric blood flow rate were determined in a major retinal vein of each eye just prior to the instillation of drops, and then 2 hr later. In comparison to the baseline value, there was an increase of 12.0% in average red blood cell velocity (P less than 0.005, statistically significant) and of 8.4% in volumetric blood flow rate in the timolol-treated eyes (P less than 0.05, statistically significant). No significant changes in these quantities were observed in the placebo-treated eyes. Also, no significant change in venous diameter was detected in the placebo- and the timolol-treated eyes. In comparison to the baseline, a significantly larger increase in red blood cell velocity was observed in the timolol-treated eyes than in the placebo-treated eyes (P less than 0.05). The difference between the increase in blood flow observed in the timolol-treated eyes and the placebo-treated eyes achieved a probability value of P = 0.058. The increase in blood flow observed in the timolol-treated eyes may be related to the increase in perfusion pressure produced by this drug.", 
    "44": "Ocular hypotension was made by iv 20% NaCl 2.5 ml/kg in rabbits. On this model, l-stepholidine (l-SPD) lowered intraocular pressure when administered topically to the eyes. The ocular hypotensive action of 0.5% l-SPD was weaker than that of 0.5% timolol, but stronger than that of 0.5% pilocarpine. The maximal actions of the 3 drugs were similar. There were no significant changes of pupil diameter and carbonic anhydrase activity after l-SPD administered, but which suppressed aqueous humor formation. As the ciliary process of the eye behaves much like the renal glomerulus, dopamine increases the glomerular blood flow and dopaminergic antagonist decreases it, the mechanism of l-SPD in lowering intraocular pressure may be related to the dopaminergic receptor blocking effect of it.", 
    "45": "This study was conducted to investigate the subtypes of muscarinic receptors involved in the action of cholinergic agents on prostacyclin synthesis in the rabbit aorta. Prostacyclin production measured as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was assessed after exposing the aortic rings to different cholinergic agents. Acetylcholine (ACh) (M1 and M2 agonist) (1-10 microM) and arecaidine proparagyl ester (APE) (M2 selective agonist) (1-10 microM) enhanced 6-keto-PGF1 alpha output in a concentration-dependent manner. A selective M1 receptor agonist, McN-A-343, at 1 microM-1 mM did not alter 6-keto-PGF1 alpha output. ACh- and APE induced increases in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha output were attenuated by the M1/M2 antagonist atropine (0.1 microM), M2 alpha antagonist (AF-DX 116), (0.1-1.0 microM), and by selective M2 beta antagonist, hexahydro-sila-difendiol (HHSiD) (0.1-1.0 microM), but not by the M1 antagonist pirenzepine (1.0 microM). 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha output elicited by ACh- or APE was not altered by the adrenergic receptor antagonists phentolamine and propranolol or by the nicotinic receptor blocker hexamethonium. Similarly, the arachidonic acid- or norepinephrine induced 6-keto-PGF1 alpha accumulation was not altered by these muscarinic receptor antagonists. Indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, prevented arachidonic acid, ACh- or APE induced 6-keto-PGF1 alpha output. Removal of the endothelium abolished the production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha elicited by ACh, APE, bradykinin, and calcium ionophore A 23187, but not that induced by angiotensin II, K+ or norepinephrine. These data suggest that vascular prostaglandin generation elicited by cholinergic agonists is mediated via activation of M2 alpha and M2 beta but not M1 muscarinic receptors, which are most likely located on the endothelium.", 
    "46": "The antihypertensive effect of a fixed dosage combination of the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, atenolol, and the oral thiazide-like diuretic, chlorthalidone (Tenoretic) was studied in 24 hypertensive Nigerians in a double-blind, cross-over comparison with three other treatments. These were atenolol alone, 100 mg daily, chlorthalidone alone, 25 mg daily, and atenolol (100 mg) plus chlorthalidone (25 mg) daily taken as separate formulations. Tenoretic was taken as a once-daily tablet containing 100 mg atenolol plus 25 mg chlorthalidone. The order of administration of the drugs was randomized. Each drug was taken for 4 weeks. The results showed that atenolol and chlorthalidone lowered blood pressure to the same extent. Combination of the two drugs whether taken separately or in fixed-dosage combination was better than either product singly. The drugs were well tolerated.", 
    "47": "The serotonin 1b (5-HT1b) receptor is thought to mediate both pre- and postsynaptic actions of serotonin. Until recently 5-HT1b sites were thought to be present only in rodent brain. We now report the presence of high-affinity [125I]iodocyanopindolol [( 125I] ICYP) binding sites in the mouse renal medulla with properties identical to those of brain 5-HT1b receptors. In vitro receptor autoradiography demonstrates that [125I]ICYP binding is highly localized to the outer stripe of the renal medulla. Association and dissociation kinetics, saturation analysis and competition displacement analyses indicate that renal medullary [125I]ICYP binding sites exhibit identical properties with brain 5-HT1b receptors. Incubation of renal medullary or brain membranes with guanylimidodiphosphate results in a decreased affinity of 5-HT1b sites for 5-HT and [125I]ICYP; this can be reversed by the addition of a purified mixture of G proteins (Gi/Go). Treatment of brain or kidney membranes with N-ethylmaleimide results in a decrease in 5-HT1b binding which can also be restored by reconstitution with purified G proteins. Adenylyl cyclase from renal medullary homogenates or minces can be stimulated more than 3-fold by forskolin and attenuated by 5-HT. These results indicate that mouse kidney contains high-affinity 5-HT1b receptors with identical properties to those found in brain. These are localized in the outer stripe of the renal medulla and are functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (Gi) G-proteins.", 
    "48": "We determined the effects of combined sotalol (160 mg/day) and flecainide (200 mg/day) in 15 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. After medication given for 3 days, the plasma levels were 0.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms/ml for sotalol and 232 +/- 104 ng/ml for flecainide. Electrophysiologic testing showed complete blockade of the accessory pathway in 4 patients and a decrease in the anterograde conduction capacity by 27% in the remainder. The effect on the accessory pathway was unrelated to the resting conduction properties. Initiation of circus movement tachycardia was prevented in 5 of 11 patients. During a median period of 28 months of follow-up, 87% of patients were either free of tachycardia or satisfactorily improved. No proarrhythmic or adverse drug effects were observed.", 
    "49": "The effect of propranolol and acebutolol therapy on serum lipoproteins was studied in thirty patients (mean age 43.9 +/- 8.7 years) with essential hypertension and/or stable myocardial ischaemia. Patients received six weeks therapy with propranolol (80-160 mg per day) and acebutolol (400-800 mg per day) each in random order and were changed over from one to the other beta-blocker after 6 weeks therapy. On propranolol treatment there was no significant effect on total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol but the concentration of serum triglycerides (94.2 +/- 37.7 to 129.1 +/- 41.2 mg/dl) and VLDL cholesterol (18.9 +/- 7.8 to 26.1 +/- 8.1 mg/dl) significantly increased, concentration of HDL cholesterol (49.5 +/- 9.4 to 42.4 +/- 8.7 mg/dl) significantly decreased (p less than 0.01). Atherogenic index also worsened from 4.17 +/- 0.48 to 5.15 +/- 0.54 (p less than 0.05) on propranolol therapy. Acebutolol therapy, on the other hand, produced no significant change in the concentration of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and VLDL cholesterol.", 
    "50": "The data on treatment of hypertension in black patients with beta-adrenoceptor blockers (BB) or calcium-entry blockers (CEB) have been reviewed. There is much evidence that in monotherapy BB are no better than inert placebo for the majority of hypertensive black patients. Their hypotensive action in blacks is less than that induced by other antihypertensive agents, mainly diuretics. Comparative evaluation of the responsiveness of blacks, whites, and Indians to BB therapy showed a poorer control of blood pressure (BP) among blacks than among nonblacks. However, when combined with diuretic therapy, BBs are equipotent in blacks and whites. The reasons for the hyporesponsiveness of black patients to BB therapy are not fully understood. On the other hand, CEBs appear to be as efficacious as diuretic therapy in hypertensive blacks. In addition, they lower blood pressure to the same extent in black and white patients. They are also proven to be effective adjunctive therapy to diuretics for hypertension in blacks. The reason for the better responsiveness of blacks to CEB therapy might include the severity of hypertension in blacks, their low plasma renin, their blunted sympathetic activity, and their high intracellular sodium concentration.", 
    "51": "There are three distinct phases during which treatment might influence the outcome in patients with portal hypertension and variceal bleeding: treatment of the active bleeding episode, the prevention of recurrent haemorrhage and perhaps most controversially the use of prophylactic therapy to avert the first bleeding episode. For the treatment of active haemorrhage injection sclerotherapy is almost certainly the treatment of choice when the expertise is available. In the absence of such, vasoconstrictor therapy continues to be widely adopted as a temporizing measure. The efficacy of vasopressin as a single agent has been limited by associated cardiovascular complications. The addition of nitroglycerin to a vasopressin regime has recently been shown to reduce such complications and to improve overall efficacy. Somatostatin represents an alternative vasoconstrictor with increasing evidence of efficacy in the absence of serious complications. Long-term injection sclerotherapy is widely accepted as the first line treatment to prevent recurrence of variceal haemorrhage although early rebleeding, prior to the obliteration of varices, represents an important limitation of therapy. Alternative local endoscopic therapy using tissue adhesives or banding of varices are under evaluation. The major claims of benefit initially attributed to oral propranolol for the prevention of rebleeding have now been considerably modified and a specific role remains to be defined. Both injection sclerotherapy and B-adreno-receptor have been proposed as prophylactic therapy to prevent the first variceal haemorrhage. Two extremely positive reports of prophylactic sclerotherapy have received little further support and there are now few protagonists of this approach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "If beta-blockage does not cause lowering of aqueous humor secretion, in itself responsible for the maintenance of intraocular pressure, what is the mechanism of action? The antagonism for indolamines, recently measured in aqueous humor, the absence of nocturnal effect, and the amplitude diminution of diurnal variations thus produced suggest that beta-blockers could interact with indolamines, since the latter are probably responsible for intraocular pressure regulation. Aqueous humor secretion depends to a major extent on the sodium-potassium pump and its enzyme, Na+K(+)-ATPase. Serotonin, known for its activating action on Na+K(+)-ATPase, is present in the greatest amounts in the morning, precisely when the aqueous humor secretion is the highest. Moreover, timolol is a potent antagonist of serotonin, suggesting that beta-blockers could decrease the secretion by antagonism with serotonin at the level of Na+K(+)-ATPase. Since serotonin is metabolized to melatonin during sleep, beta-blockers might simulate a state of sleep of the ciliary epithelium.", 
    "53": "Hemosorption and endolymphatic pharmacotherapy was included in the complex of treatment in 65 patients operated upon for spreaded forms of peritonitis and acute ileus. Hemosorption was performed within 12-24 h after operation, pharmacological agents (Aceclidine++, Cerucal, Obsidan) were introduced by antegrade endolymphatic infusions 4-6 h after hemosorption. The investigations have shown that in this case there rapidly appears intestinal peristalsis which is maintained not less than for 10-12 hours and in great part of patients it was completely recovered. Multiple stimulations by traditional methods were necessary in the control group to restore peristalsis. The combination of hemosorption and endolymphatic therapy may be recommended as an effective complex for the struggle against intestinal paresis in peritonitis and acute ileus in the postoperative period.", 
    "54": "beta blockers and Ca antagonists are popular therapeutic agents for hypertension and ischemic heart disease. Although these are reported to induce various bradycardiac arrhythmias, clinical studies remain insufficient. The author performed a clinical study of sinus node dysfunction caused by drugs for heart and circulatory diseases. Seventy-seven of the 1,734 patients admitted to the CCU of our hospital during the past 11 years, were the subjects of this study. They showed sinus node dysfunction on electrocardiographs (ECG). Forty-two subjects had drug-induced sinus node dysfunction (DISD) and 35 had sick sinus syndrome (SSS). Rubenstein's classification based on 12-lead ECG was used to diagnose DISD and SSS. All patients underwent chest X-ray examination, ECG, echocardiogram and blood chemistry and were divided into DISD and SSS groups. The DISD group was subdivided into an older group (65 years or more), and a younger group. Ten patients in the DISD group were examined electrophysiologically. SSS II and III types appeared in 22 DISD patients (52.3%) and in 31 SSS patients (88.5%). Bradycardia in the DISD group was milder than in the SSS group, because the DISD group had a higher minimum heart-rate and a shorter maximum R-R interval. However, the DISD group showed significantly lower blood pressure and renal function and a higher grade on the New York Heart Association's (NYHA) classification. Echocardiographic findings following recovery were similar in the two groups. Electrophysiological examination revealed abnormal sinus node function in 3 of the 10 DISD patients (30.0%). In the DISD group, 27 were older patients (3.2%). This was significantly more than the 15 who were younger patients (1.6%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "Several beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents have been evaluated for spermicidal activity using a transmembrane migration method. The rank order of potency of the active compounds was: penbutolol greater than (+)-propranolol greater than bufuralol greater than (-)-alprenolol greater than oxprenolol greater than metoprolol. Atenolol, pindolol, practolol, tolamolol were without activity. The observed potencies of spermicidal activity are believed to be unrelated to beta-blocking activities, and we have shown that whilst they are not predictable from lipid solubility or nonspecific membrane properties of the compound alone, both these aspects appear to play a role in this pharmacological activity.", 
    "56": "The present experiments show that the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist guanabenz produced a concentration-dependent relaxation in 5-hydroxytryptamine- and noradrenaline-preconstricted rat aortic rings, but not when tone was raised by high potassium in the medium. Similar findings were made for pinacidil. In 5-hydroxytryptamine-preconstricted preparations the relaxant effect of guanabenz was not affected by yohimbine, propranolol or by removal of the endothelium. In noradrenaline-preconstricted rings the relaxant effects of guanabenz and pinacidil were significantly antagonized by tetraethylammonium. The results suggest that guanabenz might act in the muscle tissue by opening potassium channels or antagonism of calcium mobilization from intracellular stores.", 
    "57": "Penbutolol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist that is extensively bound to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP), a protein that increases in inflammatory diseases thereby binding more drug in such conditions. Changes in serum binding can lead to modifications in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a drug, therefore, the central effect (as the anticonvulsant response) and brain uptake of penbutolol given intravenously to mice with experimental inflammation have been measured. A significant decrease of the central effect of penbutolol and its brain uptake was seen in diseased when compared with control animals (P less than 0.01). A parallel decrease in free fraction of penbutolol in diseased vs normal animals was detected. These results suggest that there is an increase in serum binding of basic drugs related to increments in alpha 1-AGP concentration, which reduces their central pharmacological effect.", 
    "58": "The aim of the present study was the evaluation of the effect of long-term propranolol treatment on some immune parameters in humans. The subjects were 12 duodenal ulcer patients, aged 19-23 years. They were given propranolol in a dose of 40 mg three times a day orally. Blood samples were drawn before and after one-month propranolol treatment. The drug did not significantly affect mitogen (PHA, Con A, PWM)- induced lymphoproliferative response, although a tendency of a slight inhibition of proliferation was observed. In all patients treated with propranolol absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte counts increased. Propranolol did not significantly influence one-way MLR, while it enhanced proliferation in the AMLR test in all patients. The drug increased spontaneous and PHA-induced IL-2R expression as well as IL-2 generation. The study showed that chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol may modify some immune functions in humans.",

The use before the extreme impact of neurotropic agents blocking transmission of the damaging impulses from the site of stimulation of reflexogenic zones through the central adrenergic synapses which activate genome in the nerve cell or prevent depletion of catecholamine stores and disturbance of energy formation processes in the brain tissue protects against the development of neurogenic damage of the stomach.",

    "61": "The adrenergic system is involved in the neural control of GH secretion with both stimulatory and inhibitory influences mainly mediated via GHRH and/or somatostatin modulation. To throw further light on adrenergic neuroregulation of somatotrophic function in man, the effect of various catecholamine agonists and antagonists on basal or GHRH-stimulated GH secretion was studied. Twenty-one adult males aged 20-30 years underwent the following studies: 1. clonidine (CLON), alpha 2-agonist, (15 micrograms/min infused i.v. from 0 to +10 min) alone and preceded by yohimbine (YOH), alpha 2-antagonist, (30 mg orally at -50 min); 2. GHRH (GHRH 44, 1 microgram/kg i.v. bolus at 0 min) alone and preceded by YOH; 3. CLON alone and combined with methoxamine (METHOX), alpha 1-agonist, (1 mg/min infused i.v. from -10 to +10 min); 4. GHRH alone and combined with i.v. infusion of phentolamine (PHEN), alpha 1/alpha 2-antagonist, (0.5 mg/min from -60 to +30 min); 5.

    "62": "We have shown previously that transmembrane proton gradients can be used to efficiently accumulate biogenic amines [M.B. Bally et al. (1988) Chem. Phys. Lipids 47, 97-107] and doxorubicin [L.D. Mayer, M.B. Bally and P.R. Cullis (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 857, 123-126] to high concentrations within liposomes. To determine the generality of this loading procedure, representative drugs from a variety of different classes (antineoplastics, local anaesthetics, antihistamines, etc.) were examined as to their ability to redistribute in response to a proton gradient. While the majority of drugs examined, all of which are weak bases, were accumulated by large unilamellar vesicles exhibiting a pH gradient (interior acid) the extent of uptake varied considerably between different pharmaceuticals. These differences are discussed in the context of various factors which will likely influence drug accumulation including its membrane/water partition coefficient and its solubility in the intravesicular medium.", 
    "63": "Circulatory autonomic functions and resting and exercise hemodynamics were studied before and six months after daily administration of 5 mg of carteolol in seven elderly patients with mild hypertension. Blood pressure was reduced in all but one patient. In maximal exercise tests, blood pressure and heart rate responses were significantly attenuated after carteolol treatment, without reduction in exercise capacity. Cardiac index at rest was not affected. Cardiac parasympathetic activity, baroreflex function, and plasma catecholamine, renin, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide, and vasopressin levels did not change during treatment. The results suggest that long-term use of low doses of carteolol may reduce blood pressure without affecting circulatory regulatory functions, even in elderly patients with mild hypertension.", 
    "64": "1. Beat-by-beat indices of contractility for assessment of inotropic effects in a given subject were studied using pacing with beta-adrenergic blockade, in eight patients undergoing routine left heart catheterization. A catheter-tip manometer was sited in the left ventricle and an electromagnetic velocity transducer was mounted further back on the same catheter so that it was sited in the ascending aorta. 2. The maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (dPLV/dtmax), and of aortic velocity (maximum acceleration, MA) and stroke volume (SV) were all obtained with this catheter. Filling effects were assessed by head-up to head-down tilt, inotropic effects by paced post-extrasystolic potentiation. 3. Tilt produced a mean increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (PLVED) of 8.1 mmHg (P less than 0.05), dPLV/dtmax decreased 4.3% (n.s.), peak velocity (PV) increased 23% (P less than 0.05), MA increased 5.4% (n.s.), and SV increased 17.5% (P less than 0.05). Post-extrasystolic potentiation produced a mean decrease in PLVED of 2.8 mmHg (n.s.), dPLV/dtmax increased 35% (P less than 0.05), PV increased 14% (P less than 0.05), MA increased 55% (P less than 0.05), and SV increased 8.7% (n.s.). 4. There was no difference in response between patients with normal and patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction. 5. It is concluded that increased left ventricular filling increases stroke volume greatly (Starling effect) but does not affect dPLV/dtmax, which (together with MA) nevertheless responds markedly to increased contractility. dPLV/dtmax appears to be a volume-insensitive index of contractility in the intact human, whether ejection fraction is normal or impaired.",

Of 16 patients in the SW group, 11 successfully withdrew from their drugs, while only 4 out of 15 in the PW group did so. Patients in the SW group had only mild withdrawal symptoms, while those in the PW group suffered more severe symptoms, which lasted around four weeks. In all, 81% of the whole group suffered withdrawal symptoms of some kind. Patients in both groups were significantly less anxious at the end of the study than at baseline. Younger subjects and those who were more severely anxious at the start of the trial had more difficulty in withdrawing than older and less anxious patients.", 
    "66": "The cultured syncytiotrophoblast cells from human first trimester placenta were used to determine the effect of adrenergic agonists on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) production in vitro. Beta-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol, ritodrine and isoxsuprine increased the hCG release during the 2 h incubation period, however, alpha-agonists norepinephrine and phenylephrine and a beta 1-agonist dobutamine had no effect. The effect of isoproterenol was blocked by propranolol and butoxamine, but less efficiently by phentolamine and atenolol. These results indicate that placental hCG production can be modulated by stimulation of beta-, possibly beta 2-adrenoceptors but not by alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "67": "The vaso-vagal nature of syncopes which remained unexplained despite full clinical and electrophysiological investigation was evaluated by means of 60 degrees head-up tilt test for 60 minutes. Thirty patients (16 men and 14 women, mean age 63.6 years, 19 with and 11 without organic heart disease) with 1 to 28 (mean 5.1) episodes of syncope of unknown origin were studied together with 11 asymptomatic control subjects. Head-up tilt test was considered positive if syncope developed in association with hypotension and/or bradycardia. During baseline head-up tilt 15 patients (50%) showed a positive test, with vasodepressor response (marked hypotension without marked bradycardia) in 10 cases and with mixed response (marked hypotension with marked bradycardia) in 5 cases. None of the control subjects became symptomatic during the test. Mean time to syncope was 24.9 minutes. Baseline head-up tilt test was reproducibly positive in 10 out of 14 patients (71%). Eight of these 10 patients underwent serial head-up tilt tests after atropine (0.04 mg/Kg i.v. in 1 minute), propranolol (0.2 mg/Kg i.v. in 3 minutes) and etilefrin (15-30 mg/day orally for 2-3 days) to determine the pathogenesis of vaso-vagal syncope. Atropine prevented tilt-induced syncope in 3 out of 7 patients (43%), propranolol in 2 out of 7 (29%) and etilephrine in 6 out of 6 (100%). Seven patients were chronically treated with drugs selected on the basis of acute drug testing. One patient-responder to atropine received transdermal scopolamine and the other 6 received etilephrine. None of these 7 patients had syncopal recurrences or death during a mean follow-up of 7.7 months, except 1 who experienced another episode of syncope after having discontinued etilephrine 4 months before. These results suggest that: 1) head-up tilt is a very sensitive and highly specific test to unmask susceptibility to vaso-vagal reaction in patients with syncope of unknown origin; 2) withdrawal of alpha-sympathetic stimulation is the principal mechanism responsible for vasodilation and syncope during head-up tilt; 3) alpha-sympathomimetic agents, such as etilephrine, are effective in preventing spontaneous episodes of vaso-vagal syncope during a short-term follow-up.", 
    "68": "The ontogeny of functional sympathetic neural, adrenal medullary, and extra-adrenal components of adrenergic control of heart rate was investigated in borderline hypertensive rats exposed to either high or low sodium chloride (NaCl) from conception through weaning. Borderline hypertensive rats were produced by mating spontaneously hypertensive females with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto males. Females were maintained on diets containing either low (0.12% NaCl) or high (3% NaCl) dietary NaCl throughout pregnancy and lactation. At 28 days of age, baseline heart rates recorded from awake and unrestrained pups did not differ between low and high NaCl-exposed pups. Overall sympathetic tone, inferred from heart rate change after beta 1-adrenergic blockade with atenolol, did not differ between high and low NaCl-exposed pups. Early NaCl exposure did not alter the neural component of sympathetic control of heart rate as inferred from heart rate decrease after bretylium tosylate. Parasympathetic nervous system control, as reflected by tachycardic response to muscarinic receptor blockade with atropine methyl nitrate was also unchanged by early NaCl exposure. The adrenal catecholamine component of sympathetic control of heart rate was inferred from bradycardia following administration of the ganglion blocking agent, chlorisondamine, to pups pretreated with bretylium and atropine methyl nitrate. Pups exposed to low NaCl showed increased adrenal control of heart rate compared to high NaCl-exposed pups. The influence of residual catecholamines on heart rate was inferred from bradycardia following administration of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, atenolol, in pups pretreated with bretylium, atropine methyl nitrate, and chlorisondamine. Residual catecholamine influence was greater in rats exposed to high NaCl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The aim of the study was to analyse the beta 2-adrenoceptor selectivity earlier found in two series of catecholamines and one series of resorcinolamines (Johansson et al. 1986). The affinity of the compounds was assessed in binding studies in preparations from the guinea-pig left heart ventricle (beta 1-adrenoceptors) and the soleus muscle (beta 2-adrenoceptors) using 3H-CGP-12177 as radioligand. Further, the activation of the adenylate cyclase by the compounds was studied in the same preparations. Selectivity quotients were obtained from both functional effects and from affinity and adenylate cyclase activating studies. There was a good correlation between the selectivity quotients obtained in these two ways. Tertiary butyl substitution on the amino nitrogen gave the highest beta 2-adrenoceptor selectivity in both the catechol and resorcinol series. In comparison with their isopropyl substituted analogues the beta 2-adrenoceptor selectivity of these compounds (KWD 2026 and terbutaline) was mainly due to a change in affinity for the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors and, to a lesser degree, a change in intrinsic efficacy.", 
    "70": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor affinity and blocking potency of the two enantiomers and the racemate of metoprolol were investigated in vitro, by use of a receptor-binding technique, and in vivo in the anaesthetized cat. 2. The enantiomeric purity of the S- and R-form was: greater than 99.2% and greater than 99.9%, respectively. 3. The beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor affinity (-log equilibrium dissociation constant) of the enantiomers was determined from competition binding experiments (radioligand: [125I]-(S)-pindolol) performed in membranes prepared from the guinea-pig left ventricular free wall (predominantly beta 1) and soleus muscle (beta 2). The beta 1-adrenoceptor affinity was (means +/- s.d.): 7.73 +/- 0.10 and 5.00 +/- 0.06 for the S- and R-form of metoprolol, respectively. The corresponding values for beta 2-adrenoceptors were 6.28 +/- 0.06 (S) and 4.52 +/- 0.09 (R). Thus, the difference in affinity for the two enantiomers was greater on beta 1- (about 500) than on beta 2-adrenoceptors (about 50). The beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity of the S-form (about 30) was similar to that of the racemic metoprolol, while the R-form was almost non-selective (3 fold beta 1-selective). 4. In the anaesthetized cat, the (-log) intravenous doses (mumol kg-1) of S- and R-metoprolol causing a 50% reduction (ED50) in the heart rate response to sympathetic nerve stimulation were determined. The doses inducing a 25% depression (DD25) of the basal myocardial contractility were also estimated. For the two enantiomers, the beta 1-blocking potency (-log ED50) was 7.04 +/- 0.16 (S) and 4.65 +/- 0.16 (R). A significant cardiodepressive effect was observed at high doses (-log DD25): 4.18 + 0.20 (S) and 4.08 + 0.10 (R). 5. It is concluded that the binding of metoprolol to beta 1-adrenoceptors has a stricter steric requirement than that for the binding of this beta l-blocker to beta 2-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, the non-specific cardiodepressive effect of metoprolol was observed at equally high doses for the two enantiomers.", 
    "71": "The use of several mass spectrometry technologies including electron impact (EI) and positive chemical ionization (CI) in both full-scan and multiple ion detection (MID) analysis for the urine analysis of several beta blockers and metabolites has been investigated. These drugs were extracted using an alkaline solid-phase extraction procedure and identified as their respective trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetyl (TMS-TFA) derivatives on capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Isobutane proved to be the preferred reagent gas for the positive CI mass spectrometry of TMS-TFA derivatives of beta blockers, in comparison with others, such as methanol, ammonia and methane, since mass spectra with little fragmentation and abundant ions at high mass were obtained. By combining EI mass spectrometry and isobutane positive CI mass spectrometry using the ion trap detector, the identities of the main co-extracted metabolites were confirmed. Absolute detection limits were 0.15 ng for full-scan analysis (EI as well as positive CI mass spectrometry) and 0.08 ng for MID analysis (EI as well as CI mass spectrometry). The detection times of beta blockers in human urine were at least two- to three-fold the elimination half-life of these drugs. The analytical potential of the above mass spectrometric techniques has been discussed.", 
    "72": "Interactions of tolbutamide and glibenclamide with B cell adrenoceptors have been reported. This study evaluated the possible role of such interactions in the stimulation of insulin release. Mouse islets were incubated in the presence of 10 mmol/l glucose alone or with tolbutamide (10 mumol/l) or glibenclamide (0.02 mumol/l). At 0.01-10 mumol/l, blockers of alpha 2-adrenoceptors (yohimbine, idazoxan) or alpha 1-adrenoceptors (prazosin) had practically no effect on glucose-induced insulin release and did not affect its potentiation by sulphonylureas, except for a slight increase by 10 mumol/l prazosin and idazoxan. Nonspecific alpha-blockers (phentolamine, dihydroergotamine) increased control release at 10 mumol/l, but only the latter amplified the response to tolbutamide. Blockers of beta-adrenoceptors were tested at 0.1-100 mumol/l: propranolol (beta 1, beta 2), metoprolol (beta 1) and compound ICI 118-551 (beta 2). They increased glucose-induced insulin release at 100 mumol/l but variably altered the effect of sulphonylureas. Blockers of adrenoceptors have, thus, no effect on insulin release in vitro at therapeutic concentrations. At high concentrations, they non-specifically affect the action of sulphonylureas. We conclude that an interaction with B cell adrenoceptors is not involved in the insulinotropic action of sulphonylureas.", 
    "73": "Based on published reports of controlled double-blind studies, the efficacy of beta-receptor blockers and calcium antagonists in the prophylactic treatment of migraine is reviewed. Taking into consideration problems in trial design and evaluation of the effects of treatment, and the amount of documentation, it may be concluded that propranolol, metoprolol, timolol, nadolol and atenolol have been shown to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks in patients with common as well as classical migraine. The effect on duration and intensity of migraine attacks is less clear. Treatment effect is generally seen within 4 weeks, but seems to increase with time. Nonselective beta-receptor blockers as well as drugs selective for beta1-receptors may be effective, and their efficacy is comparable to that of other active antimigraine drugs. Available studies do not exclude the fact that beta-receptor blockers with partial agonist activity (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) have an effect, but suggest that their efficacy is inferior to that of blockers lacking this property. Among the calcium antagonists tested for prophylactic effect in migraine, the effects of verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem seem promising, but available documentation does not allow any definitive statements of efficacy to be made, particularly not for nifedipine and diltiazem. The ability of flunarizine to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks in patients with common and classical migraine is well documented; its effect on attack duration and intensity is less well established. The response rate is similar to that for beta-receptor blockers, and to that, for example, for pizotifen (pizotyline). Nimodipine also appears to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but the efficacy of this drug, compared with other alternatives, remains to be definitely established.",

The detection of phenolalkylamines, narcotic analgesics, and beta-blockers is based on acid hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction, and selective derivatization. For screening of phenolalkylamines the m/e 179 and 267 ions were monitored by GC/MS. With narcotic analgesics, the extracted ion corresponded to the molecular ion (M+) of the drug and two additional characteristic ions. Beta-blockers were analyzed as the selectively derivatized forms of the parent molecule and its metabolites by GC/MS with selected ion monitoring. The ions monitored for screening of beta-blockers containing an isopropylamine group were m/e 284 and 129 ions. The ion at m/e 86 was monitored to characterize the tert-butylamine group of beta-blockers.",

The cyclic methyl boronates were superior in gas chromatographic properties to the corresponding n-butylboronates of these compounds. Higher weights of fragments obtained with n-butyl boronation may be advantageous for analyses of complex biological matrices. Mass spectra and retention times relative to SKF-525A are provided.", 
    "76": "Since a previous review by Hurwitz was published in 1977 a large number of reports on drug interactions with antacids have appeared, few of which are of clinical relevance. Tetracyclines form insoluble complex molecules by metal ion chelation with various antacids; tetracycline absorption may be decreased by more than 90% by this interaction. Of the new class of quinolone antibiotics, the absorption of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin is reduced by 50 to 90% in the presence of aluminium- and magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids. In contrast to early work showing inhibition of the absorption of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs by antacids, subsequent studies did not confirm a reduction in the bioavailability of either atenolol or propranolol during antacid treatment; indeed, they showed an increase in the plasma concentrations of metoprolol when the drug was coadministered with an antacid. The bioavailability of captopril was significantly reduced in the presence of an antacid, and lower plasma concentrations of this angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor were accompanied by a reduction of its effect on the systolic blood pressure of the patients. The absorption of the cardiac glycosides digoxin and digitoxin is not inhibited by antacids to a significant degree, although earlier studies had shown a positive effect when the dissolution of the glycoside preparations was relatively poor. Antacids reduce the bioavailability of the H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine and ranitidine only when high antacid doses are used and when the drugs are administered simultaneously. The bioavailability of famotidine was not significantly altered by a potent antacid preparation, although a trend towards reduced absorption was observed. Iron absorption is significantly decreased in the presence of sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate, but is nearly complete when coadministered with aluminium-magnesium hydroxide. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, tenoxicam, ketoprofen, ibuprofen and piroxicam are not affected in their absorption by antacid treatment. Theophylline bioavailability is unchanged when the drug is given together with antacids, although its rate of absorption may be altered, leading to a reduction or an increase in the time of the occurrence of peak plasma drug concentrations.", 
    "77": "The present study was undertaken to further characterize the atypical beta adrenoceptor in guinea pig ileum. Tension was developed in isolated segments of ileum using transmural electrical stimulation of enteric cholingeric nerves. The ability of isoproterenol to relax the ileum, via beta-1 adrenoceptor and atypical beta adrenoceptor agonism, was measured. Propranolol (5 x 10(-6) M) and bromoacetylaprenololmetane blocked beta-1 adrenoceptors but, at the concentrations tested, were without affinity at atypical beta adrenoceptors. (-)-Alprenolol and (-)-dihydroalprenolol, however, acted as competitive antagonists at both sites (pA2 values of 8.2 and 8.81 at beta-1 adrenoceptors and 6.47 and 6.43 at atypical beta adrenoceptors, respectively). (-)-Alprenolol also exerted agonistic activity at the atypical beta adrenoceptor. [3H](-)-Dihydroproalprenolol failed to identify beta-1 adrenoceptors or atypical beta adrenoceptors but, instead, bound to a putative lipophilic site unrelated to ileal adrenoceptors. Before this study, nadolol (pA2 = 4.7) was the only documented antagonist at the atypical beta adrenoceptor in guinea pig ileum. Thus, the present results detail two additional pharmacological probes which exhibit about a 100-fold greater affinity than nadolol for the atypical site.", 
    "78": "Norepinephrine stimulates the growth in size of nondividing neonatal cardiocytes. During this time the neonatal cardiocyte is in a period of transition in which the cell can synthesize DNA and yet does not divide. Because the cell undergoes karyokinesis without cytokinesis the objective of this study was to determine whether the norepinephrine-induced growth in size of the neonatal cardiocyte was accompanied by an increase in a) the number of cardiocytes synthesizing DNA, b) the number of binucleate cardiocytes, and c) organized myofibrils. One- to four-d-old neonatal rat heart cells were isolated and placed in serum-free medium which was then supplemented with serum, norepinephrine, norepinephrine plus propranolol, or isoproterenol. After 4 d the number and size of the cells was determined using a Coulter counter. In other cultures cardiocytes were fixed on Days 0, 1, 2, and 4, and an increase in the number of binucleate cardiocytes was found in all treatment groups including controls. However, the rate of binucleation was faster in the norepinephrine group. It was also determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody staining that by Day 4, over 50% of the cardiocytes were in the cell cycle. The percentage of cells in which PCNA could be detected was higher in the norepinephrine and norepinephrine plus propranolol groups. Furthermore, there was a concomitant increase in the amount and organization of myofibrils in the catecholamine-treated cardiocytes.", 
    "79": "Satellite cells were isolated from 20-d embryonic chick breast muscle via a Percoll density gradient fractionation technique. Culturing of these cells gave rise to at least 89% fusion (myotube nuclei number/total nuclei number). Proliferation of cultured satellite cells (indicated by myotube nuclei number) was increased in a dose-dependent manner when fibroblast growth factor (FGF) was included in the medium (25 to 200 ng/ml). Similar cultures were used to examine the effects of ractopamine and isoproterenol on satellite cell proliferation. Ractopamine and isoproterenol were added to culture medium (10(-11) to 10(-4) M) 24 h after initial plating. After a 72-h treatment period, the treatments were removed and replaced with a medium to promote fusion for 48 h. Cells then were fixed and stained, and myotube and total nuclei were counted. In later experiments, ractopamine and isoproterenol each increased (P less than .01) myotube nuclei number vs that observed in control cultures by 2.3 and 2.1 times, respectively. Similar differences were observed with total nuclei number. The number of myotube nuclei observed in cultures treated with 10(-6) M ractopamine or isoproterenol was reduced (P less than .01) by 25.4 and 23.6%, respectively, when propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist, was included at 10(-5) M with the respective agonist. These results indicate that ractopamine and isoproterenol each enhance the proliferative activity of chick satellite cells in culture and that the beta adrenergic receptor mediates this proliferative effect.", 
    "80": "Blockade of cardiac adrenoceptor subtypes, coronary or myocardial, might elicit compensatory interaction from remaining unblocked subtypes. An attempt to explore this interplay was made by studying regional myocardial blood flow alterations associated with beta 2-adrenergic blockade followed by alpha 1-adrenergic blockade in anaesthetized cats with acute coronary occlusion. In order to maintain constant needs for perfusion, atrial pacing was established and the aortic blood pressure was kept constant. In myocardium remote from the ischaemic region, beta 2-adrenergic blockade produced higher endocardial blood flow whereas no flow changes were observed close to the ischaemic region. With subsequent alpha 1-adrenergic blockade, blood flow increased endocardially in non-ischaemic regions, but remained unchanged in epicardial tissue. Control experiments without coronary ligation revealed no increase in left ventricular oxygen consumption during the experiments and support the theory that the observed blood flow increase in the coronary ligation group, following drug interventions, was not caused by increased cardiac work. This study indicates that combined beta 2- and alpha 1-adrenergic blockade alters the balance between receptor subtypes. Unopposed beta 1-mediated vasodilation is the most likely candidate to explain why endocardial flow was increased.", 
    "81": "A time-series analysis of heart rate variability was evaluated as a marker of cardiac vagal tone using well-characterized autonomic interventions. Heart period (R-R interval) was recorded in 14 mongrel dogs from which the amplitude of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (0.24-1.04 Hz) was determined. Exercise elicited significant (P less than 0.01) reductions in the index of vagal tone (control 6.3 +/- 0.3 ln ms2 vs. exercise 2.4 +/- 0.4 ln ms2) that were accompanied by significant (P less than 0.01) increases in heart rate (control 123.1 +/- 5 vs. exercise 201.0 +/- 7.7 beats/min). The vagal tone index remained greater than 0 throughout exercise. After propranolol HCl pretreatment, the vagal tone index rapidly decreased toward zero (control 6.2 +/- 0.5; exercise 0.7 +/- 0.3 ln ms2), despite significantly lower increases in heart rate (control 109.3 +/- 4.2; exercise 178.0 +/- 7.6 beats/min). Atropine given during exercise evoked significantly greater increases in heart rate in the control (+48.7 +/- 7.9 beats/min) vs. propranolol (+14.2 +/- 6.7 beats/min) conditions. These data suggest that 1) high levels of cardiac vagal tone remain during exercise; 2) vagal withdrawal is largely responsible for the heart rate increase after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade; and 3) time-series analysis of the R-R interval can provide a dynamic and noninvasive index of cardiac vagal tone.", 
    "82": "Effects of hyper- and hypothyroidism on the ability of rats to transfer acute intravenous loads of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular milieu (extrarenal potassium disposal, ERPD) were studied. We also examined the effects of the sympathoadrenal system on ERPD, as well as the manner in which it interacts with thyroid status. Experiments were performed in thyroidectomized (hypothyroid), sham-operated (euthyroid), or 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine-treated (thyrotoxic) rats. In anesthetized, acutely nephrectomized animals given a constant infusion of KCl over a 90-min period, ERPD was assessed as an inverse function of the increase in plasma potassium concentration. Some animals were subjected to chemical sympathectomy, adrenalectomy, the administration of adrenergic antagonists, or the infusion of adrenergic agonists. The effects of these treatments in various combinations on ERPD in animals of differing thyroid status were determined and the following conclusions could be drawn: 1) beta 2-adrenergic influences increase ERPD; 2) alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic influences decrease ERPD; 3) these influences of the sympathoadrenal system on ERPD are qualitatively independent of thyroid status, and in all three thyroid states, beta-adrenergic enhancement predominates over alpha-adrenergic inhibition; 4) thyrotoxicosis increases and hypothyroidism decreases ERPD, and these effects are qualitatively independent of the presence of sympathoadrenal activity; 5) the intrinsic effect of thyroid hormone insufficiency and increased alpha-adrenergic tone and/or responsiveness together account for the decreased ERPD observed in hypothyroid animals; and 6) the intrinsic effect of thyroid hormone excess and increased beta-adrenergic tone and/or responsiveness, as well as decreased alpha-adrenergic tone and/or responsiveness, together account for the increased ERPD found in thyrotoxic animals.", 
    "83": "Radioligand binding studies were performed to determine whether upregulation of postjunctional beta receptors occurs in sympathectomized hearts of aged animals. Fischer 344 rats 6, 12, and 24 months of age (n = 10) were used in these experiments. To produce sympathectomy, rats were injected with 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (6-OHDA; 2 x 50 mg/kg iv) on days 1 and 8; the animals were decapitated on day 15. The depletion of norepinephrine in the heart was about 86% in each age group. 125I-Iodopindolol (IPIN), a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, was employed to determine the affinity and total number of beta adrenergic receptors in the ventricles of the rat heart. The maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) was significantly elevated by 37%, 48%, and 50% in hearts from sympathectomized 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old rats, respectively. These results indicate that beta receptor mechanisms in older hearts can respond to procedures that cause upregulation of the beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "84": "Cats anesthetized with alpha chloralose received saline or dilevalol (1 mg/kg, IV) during a 10-minute infusion. Fifteen minutes later, the left anterior descending coronary artery was subjected to coronary occlusion 2 mm below its origin. Regional differences in the beta receptor densities were found for the atria and ventricles and for the areas within the left ventricle in cats with no coronary occlusion and dilevalol or saline. The variation in beta receptor density distribution may be related to functional differences. Coronary occlusion and saline or dilevalol did not modify the myocardial beta receptor density regional distribution. Mean times to arrhythmia and death in five saline cats were 5.8 +/- 3.6 (N = 3) and 5.4 (N = 2) minutes; three cats were killed 6 hours after coronary occlusion. In five dilevalol cats the times to arrhythmia and death were 2.2 +/- 0.8 (N = 5) and 75.9 +/- 70.7 (N = 4); 1 cat was killed. Dilevalol induced a significant decrease in blood pressure and heart rate prior to coronary occlusion. Coronary occlusion decreased blood pressure and heart rate in both groups. Twenty-five minutes after dilevalol but prior to coronary occlusion, postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge decreased to 81%. In the minutes prior to arrhythmia, postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge was 95% and was significantly increased to 121% 3 minutes after coronary occlusion. The postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge values after coronary occlusion were similar to those in the saline cats. Dilevalol depressed postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge prior to coronary occlusion but did not prevent the nonuniform (i.e., increases, decreases, or no change) discharge in the postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge associated with coronary occlusion-induced arrhythmia. Norepinephrine and epinephrine values in saline cats increased the first 5 minutes after coronary occlusion; this increase was associated with arrhythmia. Norepinephrine and epinephrine values from minute 15 to minute 360 did not differ from control. Dilevalol prevented the increase in norepinephrine and epinephrine levels associated with arrhythmia and death.", 
    "85": "Kinetics of [3H]noradrenaline in the plasma were compared with plasma noradrenaline concentration in assessing overall sympathetic activity in six groups totalling 118 subjects. Arterial plasma noradrenaline in 21 control subjects was 204 +/- 14 pg/ml, similar to 20 patients with stable angina not treated with beta-blockers (194 +/- 25 pg/ml) and to 31 patients with stable angina treated with beta-blockers (232 +/- 19 pg/ml). Plasma noradrenaline was increased in 17 patients with unstable angina (366 +/- 50 pg/ml, P less than 0.01), in 14 patients with recent acute myocardial infarction (460 +/- 44 pg/ml, P less than 0.001) and in 15 patients with treated cardiac failure (582 +/- 78 pg/ml, P less than 0.001). Whole body clearance of noradrenaline from plasma was, however, reduced in each of the last three groups compared to controls by 20% (P less than 0.05), by 34% (P less than 0.01) and by 31% (P less than 0.01), respectively. In the 31 patients with stable angina on beta-blockers, clearance of noradrenaline was also reduced by 20% (P less than 0.05). Whole body noradrenaline spillover, a potentially more accurate measure of overall sympathetic activity than concentration of noradrenaline in plasma, was 235 +/- 20 ng min-1 m-2 in controls, was similar in subjects with stable angina (no beta-blockers; 260 +/- 34 ng min-1 m-2, beta-blockers; 200 +/- 17 ng min-1 m-2), but was increased in patients with unstable angina (310 +/- 27 ng min-1 m-2, P less than 0.05), with recent acute myocardial infarction (346 +/- 40 ng min-1 m-2, P less than 0.05) or with heart failure (438 +/- 65 ng min-1 m-2, P less than 0.01). Overall sympathetic activity is unchanged in stable angina, but is progressively increased in patients with unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction or heart failure. Plasma concentration of noradrenaline fails accurately to reflect this as a result of decreased clearance of noradrenaline in these patients. The results show the potential limitations of measurement of noradrenaline in the plasma as an index of overall sympathetic activity and the importance of assessing clearance.", 
    "86": "The effectiveness of esmolol, an ultra short-acting cardioselective beta blocker, in the prevention and treatment of post-intubation haemodynamic perturbations, was investigated. Forty-eight ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing hysterectomy were randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous bolus of placebo, esmolol 100 mg, or esmolol 200 mg in a double-blind fashion. This was administered over 15 sec, and immediately followed by thiopentone 3-5 mg.kg-1, succinylcholine 1.5 mg.kg-1, and tracheal intubation 90 sec later. The heart rate following induction of anaesthesia was lower in the esmolol 200 mg group (P less than 0.01); following intubation, the increase in heart rate in the placebo group was greater than in the esmolol groups (P less than 0.05). The systolic blood pressure post-induction was lower in the esmolol 200 mg group (P less than 0.05); following intubation, however, no significant differences were seen among groups in systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressures. Following tracheal intubation, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias was lower in the esmolol groups (P less than 0.05). In summary, esmolol in 100 mg and 200 mg doses was effective in mitigating the haemodynamic response following tracheal intubation.", 
    "87": "Forty-five patients of ASA physical status I and II undergoing a variety of non-cardiac surgical procedures were studied to determine the effect of bolus administration of esmolol, a new short-acting beta blocking drug, on heart rate and blood pressure responses to induction of anaesthesia and tracheal intubation. Subjects were allocated randomly to receive placebo, 100 mg or 200 mg of esmolol IV as part of an anaesthetic induction technique. The differences in heart rate between the placebo group and both the 100 mg and 200 mg groups were significant prior to intubation (95 +/- 7.9, 82 +/- 9.7, 80 +/- 7.3 beats per min respectively), and also at 0.5 min and 1.5 min following intubation for the 200 mg group. In the 200 mg group there was a significant decrease, compared with placebo, in systolic blood pressure at 0.5 min (144 +/- 32.1 vs 165 +/- 18.7 mmHg) and 1.5 min (154 +/- 25.0 vs 170 +/- 19.5 mmHg) after intubation. In this study, adequate haemodynamic control was obtained following administration of 200 mg of esmolol.", 
    "88": "1. Epanolol is a novel anti-anginal agent which is a beta 1-adrenoceptor partial agonist exhibiting selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist and selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist activity. It is mainly metabolised to conjugates prior to excretion in urine and it was of interest to determine if any accumulation occurred in elderly patients. 2. The pharmacokinetics of epanolol have been studied over 72 h after a single oral dose of 200 mg and then over 24 h after 12 consecutive daily oral doses in 13 elderly patients with stable angina pectoris. 3. The peak plasma concentrations (mean +/- s.d.) after the single dose (25.7 +/- 17.0 ng ml-1) were not significantly different (P = 0.35) from those at steady state (32.4 +/- 20.9 ng ml-1). There was wide inter-individual variation on both occasions. The time to peak did not alter significantly during the study with mean values of 1.5 and 1.2 h on acute and chronic dosing respectively. 4. Plasma concentrations declined biphasically with a mean terminal phase half-life of 17 h and 5 fold inter-individual variation. 5. The mean area under the curve to 24 h was not significantly different (P = 0.26) after the single dose (59.0 +/- 29.8 ng ml-1 h) from that at steady state (78.4 +/- 55.0 ng ml-1 h). There was also wide inter-individual variation in these values. 6. In conclusion, the lack of significant accumulation of epanolol indicates that no alteration of dose is necessary when using epanolol in elderly patients with normal renal and hepatic function.", 
    "89": "Twelve healthy male volunteers were given adrenaline infusions, 0.05 microgram/kg body weight/minute over one hundred twenty minutes (min), in order to achieve serum adrenaline concentrations comparable with those seen in acute myocardial infarction. The infusions were given on three occasions, at intervals of at least four weeks. Before the infusions the subjects were given, in random order, two days' pretreatment with placebo, a beta-1-selective adrenoceptor blocker (atenolol), or a nonselective beta blocker (propranolol) with each subject receiving each pretreatment. Six of the volunteers also had a fourth adrenaline infusion, after two days' pretreatment with a beta-2-selective beta blocker, ICI 118551. Adrenaline increased heart rate by 11 beats/min, increased systolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg, and decreased diastolic blood pressure by 15 mmHg. These changes were partly prevented by atenolol. Propranolol and ICI 118551 partly prevented the rise in systolic blood pressure but differed from atenolol in their effects on heart rate and diastolic blood pressure, causing falls in heart rate by 7 beats/min and 12 beats/min respectively, secondary perhaps to increases in diastolic blood pressure by 13 mmHg and 17 mmHg respectively. Adrenaline caused a prolongation of QTc duration by 0.03 second and a flattening of the T-wave amplitude by 1.04 mm. These changes in cardiac repolarization were partly inhibited by atenolol, but the effects of propranolol and ICI 118551 were greater, each causing a reduction of QTc and an increase in T-wave amplitude. During adrenaline infusion S-potassium declined by 0.60 mmol/L, S-magnesium by 0.05, S-calcium by 0.10, and S-phosphate by 0.24, but S-free fatty acids increased nearly threefold. All these changes were statistically significant and were presumably mediated mainly by the beta-2-adrenoceptor, for they were blocked more effectively by the beta-2-adrenoceptor blockers than by the selective beta-1-adrenoceptor blocker. B-glucose increased by 4.1 mmol/L, the increase being practically unaffected by the different pretreatments. These adrenaline-induced hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, and metabolic changes may predispose to arrhythmias and impair cardiac performance after a myocardial infarction. Nonselective beta blockers may be more effective in blocking the electrocardiographic and metabolic effects, but beta-1-selective beta blockers may have hemodynamic advantages.", 
    "90": "Bucindolol is a potent nonselective beta-blocking agent with vasodilatory properties. In this study, we evaluated the effects of long-term bucindolol therapy in the treatment of heart failure from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "91": "Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had symptomatic heart failure, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.40. All patients received an initial test dose of 12.5 mg bucindolol orally every 12 hours for two or three doses. Patients tolerating the test dose were randomly assigned (double-blind) to receive bucindolol or placebo in a 3:2 ratio. Study medication was begun at a dose of 12.5 mg orally every 12 hours and gradually increased over a 1-month period until either a maximum tolerated dose or a target dose of 100 mg every 12 hours was reached. Study medication was then continued for an additional 2 months.", 
    "92": "A total of 24 patients were enrolled into the study. Twenty-three patients tolerated bucindolol test challenge; 14 were randomized to receive bucindolol, and nine were randomly assigned to receive placebo. The placebo group (age 56 +/- 2 years) was significantly older than the bucindolol group (46 +/- 3 years), but by all other clinical and hemodynamic parameters the two groups were comparable. Twenty-two of 23 patients completed the study. Patients treated with bucindolol had significant improvements in clinical heart failure symptoms and in resting hemodynamic function, including an increase of left ventricular ejection fraction (0.26 +/- 0.02 to 0.35 +/- 0.09, p = 0.003), cardiac index (2.2 +/- 0.1 to 2.5 +/- 0.4 L/minute/m2, p = 0.014), and left ventricular stroke work index (25 +/- 3 to 35 +/- 7 g.m/m2, p = 0.002) and a decrease in pulmonary artery wedge pressure (17 +/- 3 to 10 +/- 5 mm Hg, p = 0.005) and heart rate (86 +/- 3 to 75 +/- 9 beats/minute, p = 0.012). Patients treated with bucindolol also had a significant increase in exercise left ventricular ejection fraction (0.26 +/- 0.03 to 0.32 +/- 0.14, p = 0.015) and reduction in questionnaire-measured symptoms (p = 0.007) and New York Heart Association functional class (p less than 0.001). However, total treadmill exercise duration and maximal oxygen consumption with exercise did not change. No changes in rest or exercise parameters were observed in the placebo-treated group. Central venous plasma norepinephrine concentration decreased significantly in the bucindolol-treated group (423 +/- 79 to 212 +/- 101 pg/mL, p = 0.010), but was unchanged in the placebo-treated group.", 
    "93": "Bucindolol is well tolerated in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure, and therapy for 3 months is associated with improved resting cardiac function, improved heart failure symptoms, and a reduction in venous norepinephrine concentration.", 
    "94": "The economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals is becoming increasingly important. This article presents an illustrative example of how the cost-benefit approach can be used in the pricing of a new pharmaceutical product. Doxazosin, a new selective alpha 1-inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension, is compared with the established beta-blocker, atenolol. Cost-effectiveness ratios are calculated for both, and from the analysis it emerges that doxazosin is the more cost-effective agent. This is largely the result of the favorable high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol changes that doxazosin produces. Even when doxazosin is priced 30% higher than atenolol, doxazosin is more cost-effective. It is concluded that in the future economic evaluations will have significant impacts on research and development within the pharmaceutical industry. However, a number of issues still must be addressed, and economic evaluation should be subject to continuous review."
