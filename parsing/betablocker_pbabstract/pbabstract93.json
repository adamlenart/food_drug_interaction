Oral paroxetine 20 mg/day was then given alone on days 2-7 and coadministered with the same metoprolol formulation on day 8. Subjects received each of the other two formulations during the next two phases, with a 14-day washout period between each phase.",

The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve values of both S- and R-metoprolol for each formulation were increased approximately 3- and 4-fold, respectively, by paroxetine. Paroxetine significantly increased the S- and R-metoprolol maximum concentration (C(max)) of each formulation and increased the elimination half-life of both isomers approximately 2-fold. When metoprolol IR was given with paroxetine, the S-metoprolol C(max) was significantly greater than that of either the 100-mg or 200-mg ER products. The maximum effect of metoprolol IR on heart rate was significantly greater than that of metoprolol ER 200 mg, independent of whether the agents were administered alone or with paroxetine. Both the heart rate and systolic blood pressure area under the effect-time curve values were significantly decreased by paroxetine.",

The potential risk of adverse effects from excessive \u03b2-blockade may be greater with metoprolol IR than with metoprolol ER because of the significantly higher peak S-metoprolol plasma concentrations achieved with the IR formulation. Thus, if paroxetine treatment is indicated in patients receiving metoprolol, use of the ER formulation may reduce the risk of adverse effects.",

Economic inputs included cost for drugs, cost of hospitalizations for atrial fibrillation and/or heart failure, and cost of management of severe adverse effects. Costs were measured in 2009 U.S. dollars, and clinical outcomes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). One-way and multivariable sensitivity analyses were conducted. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were obtained from probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Rate control was found to be less costly and more effective than rhythm control. Base case and probabilistic sensitivity analyses cost and effectiveness values for rate control were $7231 (95% UI $5517-9016) and 2.395 QALYs (95% UI 2.366-2.424 QALYs); whereas those for rhythm control were $16,291 (95% UI $11,033-21,434) and 2.197 QALYs (95% UI 2.155-2.237 QALYs).

    "12": "Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) plays a decisive role in the regulation of multiple functions. GSK3 is phosphorylated and its activity inhibited by protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase (SGK) isoforms, which are in turn activated by growth factors through phosphoinositide (PI) 3 kinase signaling. PI3/PKB/Akt/SGK-dependent inhibition of GSK3 is disrupted in gene-targeted knockin mice with mutated and thus PKB/SGK-resistant GSK3\u03b1,\u00df (gsk3 ( KI )) where the serine of the PKB/SGK phosphorylation site has been replaced by alanine. Recent experiments revealed that blood pressure is significantly higher in those mice than in wild type mice (gsk3 ( WT )). The present study was performed to elucidate the underlying cause. Blood pressure was determined with the tail cuff method, heart rate by ECG measurements, catecholamine concentrations by ELISA, and vanillylmandelic acid by high pressure liquid chromatography. As a result, blood pressure and heart rate were significantly higher in gsk3 ( KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT ) mice. The \u03b1-adrenergic blocker prazosin (1\u00a0\u03bcg/g body weight, b.w.) and the ganglion blocker hexamethonium (40\u00a0\u03bcg/g b.w.) decreased blood pressure to a larger extent in gsk3 ( KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT ) mice and virtually abrogated the difference between genotypes. Similarly, the \u03b2-adrenergic blocker atenolol (5\u00a0\u03bcg/g b.w.) decreased the heart rate to a larger extent in gsk3 ( KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT ) mice and again dissipated the difference of heart rate between genotypes. Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations, as well as urinary excretion of vanillylmandelic acid, were significantly higher in gsk3 ( KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT ) mice. The observations reveal a completely novel function of PKB/Akt/SGK-dependent GSK3 signaling, i.e., regulation of catecholamine release.", 
    "13": "Resistant hypertension (RH), defined simply, is blood pressure (BP) requiring the use of four or more antihypertensive agents, whether controlled or uncontrolled. RH is an increasingly common problem in elderly patients and may affect as many as 20% of the hypertensive population. Unfortunately, at least 30% of patients evaluated for RH are actually adequately controlled when more carefully assessed by home BP monitoring or ambulatory BP monitoring, thus representing a white coat effect. It is also essential to exclude pseudoresistance resulting from improper BP recording techniques or failure of the patient to adhere to the prescribed treatment regimen. Concurrent use of drugs that may interfere with prescribed antihypertensive agents, including many over the counter herbal preparations, must also be excluded. The underlying mechanisms principally driving true RH include pathophysiologic abnormalities of aldosterone signaling, sodium and water retention, excessive sympathetic nervous system activity, and obstructive sleep apnea. Appropriate treatment regimens will usually include an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic. An aldosterone receptor blocker can be instituted at any step, and is very effective as a fourth drug. Beta-blockers can also be integrated into these treatment plans and may be especially helpful when excessive sympathetic nervous system activity is suspected. Novel device therapies that interrupt sympathetic nerve stimulation at the carotid sinus and kidney are under investigation, and may add entirely new directions in the management of RH. What is most important is that treatment regimens should be targeted to specific patient profiles.",

Side effects occurred in 11 patients and warranted a dose reduction (to 1\u2009mg/kg per day) in 3 and treatment termination in 1. Findings were significant for mean reduction in involved extraocular area (P<0.0001), post-treatment reduction in mean cylindrical power in involved eyes (P=0.02), pre- and post-treatment differences in mean cylindrical power between involved and uninvolved eyes (P=0.02 and P=0.01, respectively), and post-treatment change in absolute values of mean spherical power between involved and uninvolved eyes (P=0.025).",

    "18": "Systemic immunosuppression has been associated with stroke for many years, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that stroke induced profound behavioral changes in hepatic invariant NKT (iNKT) cells in mice. Unexpectedly, these effects were mediated by a noradrenergic neurotransmitter rather than a CD1d ligand or other well-characterized danger signals. Blockade of this innervation was protective in wild-type mice after stroke but had no effect in mice deficient in iNKT cells. Selective immunomodulation of iNKT cells with a specific activator (\u03b1-galactosylceramide) promoted proinflammatory cytokine production and prevented infections after stroke. Our results therefore identify a molecular mechanism that leads to immunosuppression after stroke and suggest an attractive potential therapeutic alternative to antibiotics, namely, immunomodulation of iNKT cells to prevent stroke-associated infections.",

Eight CHD disease subgroups were evaluated, including inpatients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute coronary syndromes, and heart failure, in addition to ambulatory patients who were post-acute myocardial infarction survivors, or had heart failure, chronic stable angina, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. The primary outcome was the predicted mortality reduction associated with meeting quality indicator targets for each CHD subgroup-treatment combination.",

    "36": "The objective of this study was to investigate the release behaviour of propranolol hydrochloride from psyllium matrices in the presence hydrophilic polymers. The dissolution test was carried out at pH 1.2 and pH 6.8. Binary mixtures of psyllium and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) used showed that an increase in the percentage of HPMC in the binary mixtures caused a significant decrease in the release rate of propranolol. Psyllium-alginate matrices produced lower drug release as compared to when the alginate was the matrix former alone. When sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (NaCMC) was incorporated into the psyllium, the results showed that matrices containing the ratio of psyllium-NaCMC in the 1:1 ratio are able to slow down the drug release significantly as compared to matrices made from only psyllium or NaCMC as retardant agent suggesting that there could be a synergistic effect between psyllium and NaCMC. The double-layered tablets showed that the psyllium and HPMC in the outer shell of an inner formulation of psyllium alone had the greatest effect of protecting the inner core and thus producing the lowest drug release (DE\u2009=\u200938%, MDT\u2009=\u200993 min). A significant decrease in the value of n in Q\u2009=\u2009kt(n) from 0.70 to 0.51 as the psyllium content was increased from 50 to 150 mg suggests that the presence of psyllium in HPMC matrices affected the release mechanism. Psyllium powder had the ability in the combination with other hydrophilic polymers to produce controlled release profiles. Care and consideration should as such be taken when formulating hydrophilic matrices in different combinations.", 
    "37": "Perioperative myocardial infarction is a common and potentially fatal complication after noncardiac surgery, particular among patients with cardiovascular risk factors. \u03b2-blockers have been considered a mainstay in prevention and treatment of perioperative myocardial infarction, yet recent evidence suggests that \u03b2-blockers may have an unfavorable risk profile in this setting, and the use has become controversial. What seems conspicuously absent from the current discussion is the appreciation of how much interindividual genetic variation influences the clinical response to \u03b2-blocker therapy. Genetic variation in the adrenergic signaling pathway is common, and has a major impact on adrenergic receptor function and \u03b2-blocker efficacy in other cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure and hypertension. Genetic variation in the cytochrome P450 2D6, or CYP2D6, enzyme, which is responsible for the metabolism of most \u03b2-blockers, is also important and can lead to poor metabolizing of \u03b2-blockers (potential toxicity) or their ultra-rapid degradation (decreased efficacy). Here, we review the molecular, cellular, and physiologic consequences of polymorphisms in the adrenergic signaling pathway and CYP2D6 gene, and show that these are likely relevant factors influencing efficacy, safety, and toxicity of \u03b2-blocker therapy in prevention and treatment of perioperative myocardial infarction.",

    "54": "Acute myocardial infarction is caused by sudden coronary artery occlusion. Persistent ischemia results in necrosis of the myocardial tissue supplied by the occluded vessel. It has recently been shown that the final size of the infarct is a major predictor of future clinical events, and is, therefore, used as a surrogate outcome in clinical trials. Moreover, it has become clear that the duration of ischemia in the main determinant of the success of myocardial salvage (i.e. of non-necrotic at-risk myocardium). In addition to minimizing the time between symptom onset and reperfusion, there is considerable interest in finding therapies that can further limit the size of the infarction (i.e. cardioprotective therapies) and they are the focus of numerous clinical studies. Oral \u03b2-blockade within the first few hours of an AMI is a class-IA indication in clinical practice guidelines. However, early intravenous \u03b2-blockade, even before coronary artery reperfusion, is not routinely recommended. Preclinical research has demonstrated that the selective\u03b21-blocker metoprolol is able to reduce the infarct size only when administered before coronary artery reperfusion, which indicates that its cardioprotective properties are secondary to its ability to reduce reperfusion injury. In addition, retrospective studies of AMI suggest that starting intravenous \u03b2-blockade early has clinical benefits (i.e. lower mortality and better recovery of left ventricular contractility) in patients without contraindications. Our general hypothesis is that early administration of metoprolol (i.e. intravenously before reperfusion) results in smaller infarcts than administering the drug orally after reperfusion. The Effect of METOprolol in CARDioproteCtioN during an acute myocardial InfarCtion (METOCARD-CNIC) trial will test this hypothesis in patients with ST-segment elevation AMI.",

In this study, we sought to investigate the underlying mechanisms in perspectives of oxidative stress, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-\u03b21) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expressions in glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) and glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) since their roles are well-established in the development and progression of DN. High-glucose levels significantly increased oxidative stress in GMCs and GECs, as evidenced by enhanced generation of reactive reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced levels of glutathione (GSH) and antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), and increased production of malondialdehyde (MDA). Treatment with valsartan significantly restored the levels of those oxidative stress relevant molecules. Furthermore, valsartan obviously diminished the expression of proinflammatory cytokine MCP-1 in GMCs and GECs induced by high-glucose levels both at mRNA and protein levels, as determined by real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, western blotting, and ELISA. In addition, the increased expressions of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein induced by high-glucose level were also abrogated by valsartan treatment in GMCs, as evaluated by real-time PCR and ELISA. These results suggest that the renoprotective effects of valsartan may be related to its potential in decreasing oxidative stress and the expressions of MCP-1 and TGF-\u03b21 in GMCs and GECs.", 
    "57": "The present study examined the effect of dexmedetomidine, an \u03b1(2) adrenoceptor agonist, on endogenous glutamate release in rat cerebral cortex nerve terminals (synaptosomes). We also explored the possible mechanism that triggers dexmedetomidine to act. Dexmedetomidine dose-dependently inhibited the release of glutamate evoked by the K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine. Presynaptic \u03b1(2A) adrenoceptors were involved in this release inhibition, with the \u03b1(2A) antagonist (but not by the \u03b1(2B/C) antagonist) blocking the dexmedetomidine-mediated inhibition. The effect of dexmedetomidine on the evoked glutamate release was prevented by the chelating extracellular Ca(2+) ions, and by the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1. However, the glutamate transporter inhibitor DL-threo-beta-benzyl-oxyaspartate did not have any effect on the action of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine decreased the degree of depolarization-induced increase in the intrasynaptosomal Ca(2+) levels, but did not affect the synaptosomal membrane potential. The inhibitory effect of dexmedetomidine on evoked glutamate release was abolished by blocking the Ca(v)2.2 (N-type) and Ca(v)2.1 (P/Q-type) channels, but was insensitive to the endoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptors or mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange. In addition, the mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors prevented dexmedetomidine from inhibiting glutamate release. Further, western blotting showed that dexmedetomidine decreased the 4-aminopyridine-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 and synapsin I, the main presynaptic target of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Thus, we concluded that dexmedetomidine acts at \u03b1(2A) adrenoceptors present on cerebrocortical nerve terminals inhibit the release of glutamate. We further concluded that this effect is linked to the suppression of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity.",

No gender difference in the pattern of use of \u03b2-blockers was noted. The prescription of \u03b2-blockers was higher in patients with heart failure (HF) than in patients without HF. The presence of HF abolished the decrease in \u03b2-blocker use with age. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that lower age and severe HF were independent predictors of \u03b2-blocker use in older people.",

Despite the recommendations, and the efforts of cardiologists, the use of \u03b2-blockers in the elderly is still limited, possibly because of practical constraints such as adverse effects and co-morbidity. In patients with HF, age is less important in determining the use of \u03b2-blockers.",

The intervention did not significantly improve symptoms of angina or self-perceived health, although end points favored collaborative care for 10 of 13 prespecified measures. While concordance with practice guidelines improved 4.5% more among patients receiving collaborative care than among those receiving usual care (P < .01), this was mainly because of increased use of diagnostic testing rather than increased use of recommended medications.",

    "67": "The \"Lund concept\" involving a \"volume-targeted\" strategy for intracranial pressure control originated in the University of Lund, Sweden, more than 20 years ago and has remained controversial ever since. It is based on the premise that the blood-brain barrier is disrupted after traumatic brain injury and cerebral autoregulation is impaired; hence, the transcapillary water exchange is determined by the differences in hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressure between the intracapillary and extracapillary compartments. The Lund concept argues that the only way of inducing transcapillary reabsorption of interstitial fluid is to control the transcapillary osmotic and hydrostatic differences and utilizes a complex combination pharmacotherapy involving \u03b21-antagonist metoprolol, \u03b12-agonist clonidine, low-dose thiopental, dihydroergotamine, and maintenance of colloid osmotic pressure by red blood cell transfusion and albumin administration. Although improved outcomes compared with historical controls and other institutions have been reported with treatment strategies based on the Lund concept by a few nonrandomized studies from various Swedish neurological centers, the protocol has never been subjected to a randomized trial and has not been evaluated outside Sweden. It deemphasizes the effect of secondary cerebral ischemia and contradicts the common treatment goal of cerebral blood flow optimization by augmentation of cerebral perfusion pressure. In fact, good evidence exists against the use of many individual components of the Lund therapy in traumatic brain injury. In the absence of strong evidence to support it, the Lund concept is unlikely to gain acceptance elsewhere.", 
    "68": "This study examined transgenic mice whose expression of a \u03b2-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter is driven by a GATA6 gene enhancer. Previous investigations established that transcription of the transgene was associated with precardiac mesoderm and primary heart tube myocardium, which decreased progressively, so that its expression was no longer observed within ventricular myocardium by midgestation. Expression of this reporter in the adult was investigated for insights into myocyte homeostasis and cardiovascular biology. Morphometric analysis determined that <1% of myocytes, often found in small clusters, express this GATA6-associated reporter in the adult heart. LacZ expression was also found in the ascending aorta. Myocardial expression of the transgene was not associated with a proliferative phenotype or new myocyte formation, as lacZ-positive myocytes neither labeled with cell division markers nor following 5-bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase experimentation. Despite exhibiting normal adherens junctions, these myocytes appeared to exhibit decreased connexin 43 gap junctions. Treatment with the gap junctional blocker heptanol both in vivo and in culture elevated myocardial \u03b2-galactosidase activity, suggesting that deficient gap junctional communication underlies expression of the transgenic reporter. LacZ expression within the myocardium was also enhanced in response to cryoinjury and isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy. These results reveal a previously uncharacterized phenotypic heterogeneity in the myocardium and suggest that decreased gap junctional coupling leads to induction of a signaling pathway that utilizes a unique GATA6 enhancer. Upregulation of lacZ reporter gene expression following cardiac injury indicates this transgenic mouse may serve as a model for examining the transition of the heart from healthy to pathological states.", 
    "69": "The final end point of diabetic renal disease is the accumulation of excess collagen. A number of studies have shown that aldosterone antagonism ameliorates progression of renal fibrosis. This study was designed to examine the effect of the mineralocorticoid receptor blocker eplerenone (EPL) on progression in streptozotocin (STZ)-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), an accelerated model of Type I diabetes. STZ-treated SHRs with a blood glucose >18 mmol/L were randomly divided into treatment (100 mg/kg/day EPL) and non-treatment groups. Sham-injected SHR animals were used as a control. Functional parameters were monitored for 16 weeks, with structural parameters assessed at completion. Both hyperglycaemic groups developed progressive albuminuria, but the increase was ameliorated by EPL from Week 12. STZ-SHRs had elevated kidney weight/body weight ratio, glomerular size, glomerular macrophages (ED-1-positive cells), tissue transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) concentrations and glomerular collagen IV staining (all P < 0.05 versus control animals). EPL reduced glomerular volume, TGF\u03b21 expression and glomerular collagen IV without changing glomerular macrophage infiltration. The ability of EPL to ameliorate these functional and structural changes in hyperglycaemic SHRs suggest that EPL has a renoprotective role in diabetic renal disease.", 
    "70": "Hypertensive emergencies are acute elevations in blood pressure (BP) that occur in the presence of progressive end-organ damage. Hypertensive urgencies, defined as elevated BP without acute end-organ damage, can often be treated with oral agents, whereas hypertensive emergencies are best treated with intravenous titratable agents. However, a lack of head-to-head studies has made it difficult to establish which intravenous drug is most effective in treating hypertensive crises. This systematic review presents a synthesis of published studies that compare the antihypertensive agents nicardipine and labetalol in patients experiencing acute hypertensive crises. A MEDLINE search was conducted using the term \"labetalol AND nicardipine AND hypertension.\" Conference abstracts were searched manually. Ultimately, 10 studies were included, encompassing patients with hypertensive crises across an array of indications and practice environments (stroke, the emergency department, critical care, surgery, pediatrics, and pregnancy). The results of this systematic review show comparable efficacy and safety for nicardipine and labetalol, although nicardipine appears to provide more predictable and consistent BP control than labetalol.", 
    "71": "Conformational thermostabilisation of G-protein-coupled receptors is a successful strategy for their structure determination. The thermostable mutants tolerate short-chain detergents, such as octylglucoside and nonylglucoside, which are ideal for crystallography, and in addition, the receptors are preferentially in a single conformational state. The first thermostabilised receptor to have its structure determined was the \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptor mutant \u03b2(1)AR-m23 bound to the antagonist cyanopindolol, and recently, additional structures have been determined with agonist bound. Here, we describe further stabilisation of \u03b2(1)AR-m23 by the addition of three thermostabilising mutations (I129V, D322K, and Y343L) to make a mutant receptor that is 31\u00a0\u00b0C more thermostable than the wild-type receptor in dodecylmaltoside and is 13\u00a0\u00b0C more thermostable than \u03b2(1)AR-m23 in nonylglucoside. Although a number of thermostabilisation methods were tried, including rational design of disulfide bonds and engineered zinc bridges, the two most successful strategies to improve the thermostability of \u03b2(1)AR-m23 were an engineered salt bridge and leucine scanning mutagenesis. The three additional thermostabilising mutations did not significantly affect the pharmacological properties of \u03b2(1)AR-m23, but the new mutant receptor was significantly more stable in short-chain detergents such as heptylthioglucoside and denaturing detergents such as SDS.",

The molecular mechanisms remain unclear.

Thus, we aimed to investigate the expression of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes by ICA cells exposed to irregular pacing.",

    "74": "First, immunolabeling identified ICA cells presenting TH and DBH staining around the cell nucleus. Irregular pacing with 25% SD at a constant rate of 5Hz significantly increased the expression of TH and DBH enzyme synthesis. Pharmacological approaches have shown that both metoprolol and losartan reversed the irregular pacing induced DBH increase, whereas the expression of TH was only blocked by metoprolol in a significant manner. Blockade of the endothelin-A receptor by BQ123 or the calcineurin-NFAT pathway by cyclosporine-A, 11R-VIVIT or FK506 revealed a potential role of both cascades in irregular pacing induced catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme expression.",

    "81": "The bromination of five selected pharmaceuticals (metoprolol, naproxen, amoxicillin, phenacetin, and hydrochlorothiazide) was studied with these compounds individually dissolved in ultra-pure water. The apparent rate constants for the bromination reaction were determined as a function of the pH, obtaining the sequence amoxicillin>naproxen>hydrochlorothiazide\u2248phenacetin\u2248metoprolol. A kinetic mechanism specifying the dissociation reactions and the species formed for each compound according to its pK(a) value and the pH allowed the intrinsic rate constants to be determined for each elementary reaction. There was fairly good agreement between the experimental and calculated values of the apparent rate constants, confirming the goodness of the proposed reaction mechanism. In a second stage, the bromination of the selected pharmaceuticals simultaneously dissolved in three water matrices (a groundwater, a surface water from a public reservoir, and a secondary effluent from a WWTP) was investigated. The pharmaceutical elimination trend agreed with the previously determined rate constants. The influence of the main operating conditions (pH, initial bromine dose, and characteristics of the water matrix) on the degradation of the pharmaceuticals was established. An elimination concentration profile for each pharmaceutical in the water matrices was proposed based on the use of the previously evaluated apparent rate constants, and the theoretical results agreed satisfactorily with experiment. Finally, chlorination experiments performed in the presence of bromide showed that low bromide concentrations slightly accelerate the oxidation of the selected pharmaceuticals during chlorine disinfection.",

One-hundred-eight-six patients followed for chronic systolic heart failure secondary to Chagas' cardiomyopathy at our Institution from January 2000 to December 2008 were studied. Forty-nine (26%) patients were found to have anemia; 37 (20%) were men and 12 (6%) were women. Mean hemoglobin level was 14.1\u00b11.2g/L in patients with no anemia and 11.5\u00b11.2g/L in patients with anemia. On a Cox proportional hazards multivariate analysis, anemia was a predictor of all-cause mortality neither in the univariate nor in the multivariate analysis. Mean serum sodium (Hazard ratio=0.92; Beta-coefficient=-0.09; 95% confidence interval 0.89-0.96; p value<0.005), and Beta-Blocker therapy (Hazard ratio=0.40; 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.61; p value<0.005) were retained as independent predictors of mortality for patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy with chronic heart failure. Probability of survival for patients with anemia, however, was significantly lower in patients with anemia in comparison to patients with no anemia, mainly in patients with advanced heart failure. Anemia is not an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy with chronic systolic heart failure. Probability of survival is poorer in patients with anemia than in those without.", 
    "83": "\u03b2-Blocker drugs or \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents are an important class of drugs, prescribed with great frequency. They are used for various diseases, particularly for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, cardioprotection after myocardial infarction (heart attack), and hypertension. Almost all \u03b2-blocker drugs possess one or more stereogenic centers; however; only some of them are administered as single enantiomers. Since both enantiomers can differ in their pharmacological and toxicological properties, enantioselective analytical methods are required not only for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies but also for quality control of pharmaceutical preparations with the determination of enantiomeric purity. In addition to the chromatographic tools, in recent years, capillary electromigration techniques (CE, CEC, and MEKC) have been widely used for enantioselective purposes employing a variety of chiral selectors, e.g. CDs, polysaccharides, macrocyclic antibiotics, proteins, chiral ion-paring agents, etc. The high separation efficiency, rapid analysi,s and low consumption of reagents of electromigration methods make them a very attractive alternative to the conventional chromatographic methods. In this review, the development and applications of electrodriven methods for the enantioseparation of \u03b2-blocker drugs are reported. The papers concerning this topic, published from January 2000 until December 2010, are summarised here. Particular attention is given to the coupling of chiral CE and CEC methods to MS, as this detector provides high sensitivity and selectivity.",

Within this population, we compared the exercise tolerance of patients with a normal chronotropic response (maximal HR 85%-115% that of the maximal age-predicted HR during CPX) to those whose HR response exceeded this range. Two similar comparisons were made by dividing the subject population according to (1) whether or not their HR variation index (HRVI) during CPX exceeded 10 bpm/min, and (2) whether their HR during the 6-minute walk test exceeded 110 bpm.",

    "93": "The pronounced activation of sympathetic nervous system is a necessary prerequisite for the development of neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) in rats with balloon compression of spinal cord. In this study we examined whether this is a consequence of rapid activation of spinal pathways leading to sympathetic venoconstriction, blood pressure rise, and reflex bradycardia. We found that NPE development can be prevented by epidural upper thoracic anesthesia or by transection of the upper spinal cord. This indicates an important role of spinal pathways activation. NPE development can also be prevented by moderate blood loss, supporting the role of blood redistribution to pulmonary circulation. In rats developing NPE the catecholamine surge following spinal cord compression involved not only a dramatic increase of circulating norepinephrine but also of epinephrine levels. The pretreatment of rats with \u03b1-1 adrenoceptor blocker prazosin, \u03b1-2 adrenoceptor blocker yohimbine, or calcium channel blocker nifedipine prevented NPE development, whereas the effect of \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol was less convincing. In conclusion, considerable activation of thoracic spinal pathways, followed by marked catecholamine secretion, play a major role in the development of NPE in spinal cord-injured rats. Enhanced \u03b1-adrenergic nifedipine-sensitive vasoconstriction is responsible for observed blood pressure changes, subsequent baroreflex bradycardia, and blood volume redistribution, which represent major pathogenetic mechanisms of NPE development.", 
    "94": "Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in renin (REN) cause renal tubular dysgenesis, which is characterized by death in utero due to kidney failure and pulmonary hypoplasia. The phenotype resembles the fetopathy caused by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker intake during pregnancy. Recently, heterozygous REN mutations were shown to result in early-onset hyperuricemia, anemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). To date, only 3 different heterozygous REN mutations have been published. We report mutation analysis of the REN gene in 39 kindreds with hyperuricemia and CKD who previously tested negative for mutations in the UMOD (uromodulin) and HNF1B (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b2) genes. We identified one kindred with a novel thymidine to cytosine mutation at position 28 in the REN complementary DNA, corresponding to a tryptophan to arginine substitution at amino acid 10, which is found within the signal sequence (c.28T>C; p.W10R). On this basis, we conclude that REN mutations are rare events in patients with CKD. Within the kindred, we found affected individuals over 4 generations who carried the novel REN mutation and were characterized by significant anemia, hyperuricemia, and CKD. Anemia was severe and disproportional to the degree of decreased kidney function. Because all heterozygous REN mutations that have been described are localized in the signal sequence, screening of the REN gene for patients with CKD with hyperuricemia and anemia may best be focused on sequencing of exon 1, which encodes the signal peptide.",

Electrokinetic chromatography was carried out in fused silica capillaries with a background solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in a low pH phosphate buffer. MSS was performed using anionic SDS micelles in the sample solution for analyte transport and methanol or acetonitrile as organic solvent in the background solution for analyte effective electrophoretic mobility reversal. The solvent also allowed for the separation of the analyte test mixtures. A model for focusing and separation was developed and the mobility reversal that involved micelle collapse was experimentally verified. The effect of analyte retention factor was observed by changing the % organic solvent in the background solution or the concentration of SDS in the sample matrix. With an injection length of 31.9 cm (77% of effective capillary length) for the 7 test drugs, the LODs (S/N=3) of 5-14 ng/mL were 101-346-fold better when compared to typical injection.

Motor neuron (MN) differentiation of mouse ES cells involves embryoid bodies formation with addition of Sonic hedgehog and retinoic acid. In this work, using immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and quantitative RT-PCR, we investigated whether progesterone or 17\u03b2-estradiol have inductive effects on ES cell-derived MN, as it has been demonstrated that these hormones modify proliferation and neural differentiation of pluripotent cells. When 100 nM progesterone was added during differentiation, we found higher proportions of MN, compared to the control condition; coincubation of progesterone with the progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist RU-486 caused a decrease in the number of MN to a percentage even lower than controls. The addition of nanomolar concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol also significantly induced MN differentiation. This effect of estradiol was completely antagonized by addition of the general estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780. To identify the ER subtype mediating the increase on MN differentiation, we incubated estradiol with the ER-\u03b1 antagonist MPP or with the ER-\u03b2 blocker PHTPP. When we coincubated 17\u03b2-estradiol with MPP, we found a significant decrease in the percentage of MN. In contrast, the coincubation of 17\u03b2-estradiol with PHTPP had no effect on the induction of MN differentiation. All these effects on cell number were confirmed by significant changes in the expression of the MN markers Islet-1 and Choline acetyl transferase, assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Cell proliferation in embryoid bodies was significantly enhanced by progesterone treatment. No changes in apoptotic cell death were found in differentiating cells after progesterone or 17\u03b2-estradiol addition. Our findings indicate that progesterone and 17\u03b2-estradiol induce a higher proportion of MN derived from mouse ES cells through intracellular PR and ER, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of estradiol was mediated by specific activation of ER-\u03b1.", 
    "101": "The aim of this study was to determine the role of \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptors in the action of endogenous catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) on rat retinal arterioles in vivo. Using an original high-resolution digital fundus camera, the rat ocular fundus images were captured. The diameter of retinal arterioles contained in the images was measured. Both systemic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded continuously. Adrenaline (0.3-5.0\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/min, i.v.) increased the diameter of retinal arterioles, mean blood pressure and heart rate in a dose-dependent manner. Under blockade of \u03b2(1)/\u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors with propranolol (2\u00a0mg/kg, i.v. bolus followed by 100\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/min infusion), adrenaline decreased the diameter of retinal arterioles. Similar observation was made under treatment with the \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist L-748337 (50\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, i.v.). The pressor response to adrenaline was enhanced by propranolol, but not by L-748337. The positive chronotropic action of adrenaline was markedly prevented by propranolol, whereas it was unaffected by L-748337. Noradrenaline (0.03-1.0\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/min, i.v.) decreased the diameter of retinal arterioles but increased the mean blood pressure and heart rate. The effects of noradrenaline on retinal arteriolar diameter and blood pressure were unaffected by propranolol or L-748337. The positive chronotropic action of noradrenaline was almost completely abolished by propranolol. These results suggest that \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptors play crucial roles in vasodilator responses to adrenaline of retinal arterioles but have minor or no effect on noradrenaline-induced responses. The results also indicate that the functional role of \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptors may be more important than that in peripheral resistance vessels.",

The catalytic efficiency followed the order Zn(BF(4))(2)\u00b7xH(2)O \u226b Cu(BF(4))(2)\u00b7xH(2)O > Co(BF(4))(2)\u00b76H(2)O \u226b Fe(BF(4))(2)\u00b76H(2)O > LiBF(4) for reactions with cyclohexene oxide and Zn(BF(4))(2)\u00b7xH(2)O \u226b Co(BF(4))(2)\u00b76H(2)O \u226b Fe(BF(4))(2)\u00b76H(2)O > Cu(BF(4))(2)\u00b7xH(2)O for stilbene oxide, but AgBF(4) was ineffective. For reaction of styrene oxide with aniline, the metal tetrafluoroborates exhibited comparable regioselectivity (1:99-7:93) with preferential reaction at the benzylic carbon of the epoxide ring. A reversal of regioselectivity (91:1-69:31) in favor of the reaction at the terminal carbon of the epoxide ring was observed for reaction with morpholine. The regioselectivity was dependent on the electronic and steric factors of the epoxide and the pK(a) of the amine and independent of amine nucleophilicity. The role of the metal tetrafluoroborates is envisaged as \"electrophile nucleophile dual activation\" through cooperativity of coordination, charge-charge interaction, and hydrogen-bond formation that rationalizes the catalytic efficiency, substrate reactivity, and regioselectivity.

Several meta-analyses have suggested that despite lowering blood pressure, any and all \u03b2 blockers inadequately protect hypertensive patients from cardiovascular events. These phenomena have been attributed to ineffective lowering of central aortic or inter-visit blood pressures, or adverse metabolic effects (particularly when combined with diuretics). Although there has never been a head-to-head comparison of atenolol with any other \u03b2 blocker in hypertensive patients, indirect comparisons can be done with network and Bayesian meta-analyses, which suggest that heterogeneity of \u03b2-blockers' pharmacology also extends to outcomes. Although once-daily atenolol as initial antihypertensive therapy may be unwise, whether initial \u03b2 blockers newer than atenolol reduce cardiovascular risk to the same extent as other antihypertensive drugs should be answered with more clinical trials.",

T-type and L-type calcium channel mRNAs were highly expressed in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/mL) significantly increased Smad2 phosphorylation and [(3)H]-leucine incorporation, which were attenuated by pretreatment with efonidipine (10 \u00b5M). Neither R(-)efonidipine (10 \u00b5M), selective T-type CCB, nor nifedipine (10 \u00b5M), selective L-type CCB, efficaciously inhibited both TGF-\u03b21-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and [(3)H]-leucine incorporation. However, both were markedly attenuated by combination of R(-)efonidipine and nifedipine, EDTA, or calcium-free medium. Pretreatment with Smad2 siRNA significantly attenuated [(3)H]-leucine incorporation induced by TGF-\u03b21. These data suggest that efonidipine elicits inhibitory effects on TGF-\u03b21- and Smad2-dependent protein synthesis through both T-type and L-type calcium channel-blocking actions in cardiac fibroblasts.",

Because of heterogeneity between the studies, a random-effects meta-analysis model was used to assess the efficacy of \u03b2-blocker therapy in preventing any arrhythmic event [syncope, aborted cardiac arrest (ACA), and sudden cardiac death (SCD)], near-fatal arrhythmic events (ACA and SCD), and fatal arrhythmic events. Eleven studies including 403 patients, of whom 354 (88%) had a \u03b2-blocker prescribed, were identified. Mean follow-up ranged from 20 months to 8 years.

    "129": "Several lines of research have now suggested the controversial hypothesis that the central noradrenergic system acts to exacerbate depression as opposed to having an antidepressant function. If correct, lesions of this system should increase resistance to depression, which has been partially but weakly supported by previous studies. The present study reexamined this question using two more recent methods to lesion noradrenergic neurons in mice: intraventricular (ivt) administration of either the noradrenergic neurotoxin, DSP4, or of a dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase-saporin immunotoxin (DBH-SAP ITX) prepared for mice. Both agents given 2 weeks prior were found to significantly increase resistance to depressive behavior in several tests including acute and repeated forced swims, tail suspension and endotoxin-induced anhedonia. Both agents also increased locomotor activity in the open field. Cell counts of brainstem monoaminergic neurons, however, showed that both methods produced only partial lesions of the locus coeruleus and also affected the dorsal raphe or ventral tegmental area. Both the cell damage and the antidepressant and hyperactive effects of ivt DSP4 were prevented by a prior i.p. injection of the NE uptake blocker, reboxetine. The results are seen to be consistent with recent pharmacological experiments showing that noradrenergic and serotonergic systems function to inhibit active behavior. Comparison with previous studies utilizing more complete and selective LC lesions suggest that mouse strain, lesion size or involvement of multiple neuronal systems are critical variables in the behavioral and affective effects of monoaminergic lesions and that antidepressant effects and hyperactivity may be more likely to occur if lesions are partial and/or involve multiple monoaminergic systems.",

Effects of carvedilol (1-3\u2009mg/kg i.v.) on blood pressure, heart rate and blood pressure variability were recorded. Carvedilol plasma pharmacokinetics was studied by traditional blood sampling. Relationship between carvedilol concentrations and their hypotensive and bradycardic effects was established by PK-PD modeling. Vascular sympatholytic activity of carvedilol was assessed by estimation of drug effects on low frequency blood pressure variability using spectral analysis. A greater volume of distribution and clearance of S-carvedilol compared to R-enantiomer was found in both experimental groups. Although PK-PD properties of S-carvedilol chronotropic effect were not altered in F rats, hypertensive rats showed greater efficacy to the carvedilol hypotensive response after administration of the higher dose. A similar potency of carvedilol to inhibit sympathetic vascular activity was found in F rats.

BB are associated with a potential risk for lung function decline and airway hyperresponsiveness, and reluctance still exists to prescribe these agents in COPD patients. However, a large body of evidence indicates that these patients tolerate well selective beta-blockade, and BB should not be denied to HF patients with concomitant COPD. Current guidelines and recent reports recommend the use of selective BB in all patients with stable COPD and irreversible airway obstruction, to be administered at the lowest dose and at a low titration rate. Close monitoring of lung function by spirometry is strongly encouraged to guide and enhance a safe BB use in everyday practice. Pneumologists and cardiologists should develop shared strategies with the aim to implement selective BB therapy in clinical practice and improve the prognosis of both HF and COPD.", 
    "132": "The end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) is proposed and used as a reliable index of left ventricular (LV) contractility despite the fact that its afterload independence has been challenged. Furthermore, the physiological relevance of its volume-axis intercept, V(0), remains unclear. Systemic haemodynamics and pressure-volume loops obtained by inferior vena cava occlusion were recorded in 21 rats anaesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and instrumented with a conductance pressure-volume catheter in response to incremental I.V. doses of adrenaline, dobutamine, phenylephrine, metoprolol, papaverine and isoflurane inhalation. In conditions with large variations (\u00b1 100%) of both inotropy and afterload, infusion of negative inotropic drugs was associated with a dose-dependent rightward shift of ESPVR accompanied by a decrease in its slope (end-systolic elastance, E(es)), whereas positive inotropic agents produced an isolated decrease in V(0). With the predominant vasoactive drugs, there was a dose-dependent change in E(es) without major horizontal shifts, demonstrating that this slope mainly represents LV afterload rather than inotropy. When contractility was altered, V(0) was negatively correlated to the preload-adjusted contractility index, PAdP/dt(max), demonstrating that a reduced V(0) provides a good reflection of increased LV contractility. From these results, we computed a logarithmically adjusted E(es)/V(0) ratio, which resulted in reasonably strong concordance with PAdP/dt(max), including all the investigated drugs and dosages [n = 288; bias, 0.8 \u00b1 16.2% (SD)]. Concordance with E(es) (bias, 7.2 \u00b1 58.7%) or V(0) (bias, -0.6 \u00b1 33.4%), used alone or with other commonly used contractility indices, was far less significant. In contrast to E(es), V(0) provides a relatively good LV contractility index because it is much less sensitive to afterload.",

    "147": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. It impairs cardiac function and increases the risk of stroke. The incidence of atrial fibrillation increases with age. Key treatment issues include deciding when to restore normal sinus rhythm, when to control rate only, and how to prevent thromboembolism. Rate control is the preferred management option in most patients. Rhythm control is an option for patients in whom rate control cannot be achieved or who have persistent symptoms despite rate control. The current recommendation for strict rate control is a resting heart rate of less than 80 beats per minute. However, one study has shown that more lenient rate control of less than 110 beats per minute while at rest was not inferior to strict rate control in preventing cardiac death, heart failure, stroke, and life-threatening arrhythmias. Anticoagulation therapy is needed with rate control and rhythm control to prevent stroke. Warfarin is superior to aspirin and clopidogrel in preventing stroke despite its narrow therapeutic range and increased risk of bleeding. Tools that predict the risk of stroke (e.g., CHADS2) and the risk of bleeding (e.g., Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index) are helpful in making decisions about anticoagulation therapy. Surgical options for atrial fibrillation include disruption of abnormal conduction pathways in the atria, and obliteration of the left atrial appendage. Catheter ablation is an option for restoring normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and normal left atrial size. Referral to a cardiologist is warranted in patients who have complex cardiac disease; who are symptomatic on or unable to tolerate pharmacologic rate control; or who may be candidates for ablation or surgical interventions.", 
    "148": "In this study we characterized the pharmacological selectivity and physiological actions of a new arylaspartate glutamate transporter blocker, L-threo-\u00df-benzylaspartate (L-TBA). At concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M, L-TBA did not act as an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) or NMDA receptor (NMDAR) agonist or antagonist when applied to outside-out patches from mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. L-TBA had no effect on the amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) recorded at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapse. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons were unaffected by L-TBA in the presence of physiological extracellular Mg(2+) concentrations, but in Mg(2+)-free solution, EPSCs were significantly prolonged as a consequence of increased NMDAR activity. Although L-TBA exhibited approximately four-fold selectivity for neuronal EAAT3 over glial EAAT1/EAAT2 transporter subtypes expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the L-TBA concentration-dependence of the EPSC charge transfer increase in the absence of Mg(2+) was the same in hippocampal slices from EAAT3 +/+ and EAAT3 -/- mice, suggesting that TBA effects were primarily due to block of glial transporters. Consistent with this, L-TBA blocked synaptically evoked transporter currents in CA1 astrocytes with a potency in accord with its block of heterologously expressed glial transporters. Extracellular recording in the presence of physiological Mg(2+) revealed that L-TBA prolonged fEPSPs in a frequency-dependent manner by selectively increasing the NMDAR-mediated component of the fEPSP during short bursts of activity. The data indicate that glial glutamate transporters play a dominant role in limiting extrasynaptic transmitter diffusion and binding to NMDARs. Furthermore, NMDAR signaling is primarily limited by voltage-dependent Mg(2+) block during low-frequency activity, while the relative contribution of transport increases during short bursts of higher frequency signaling.", 
    "149": "A 25-year-old, full-term pregnant woman diagnosed with pre-eclampsia was referred to our tertiary care hospital with severe resistant hypertension. Her blood pressure remained labile despite the usual medications, which led to the suspicion of an underlying endocrinological problem. Further biochemical and radiological investigations confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The patient was invasively monitored and treated with alpha blockade, beta blocker, and vasodilators. The primary goals for the management of pheochromocytoma in pregnancy are early diagnosis, avoidance of a hypertensive crisis during delivery, and definitive surgical treatment. This case illustrates that one needs to be cautious when such a presentation of paroxysmal hypertension is present. With a multidisciplinary team approach, proper planning, and adequate preoperative medical management, pheochromocytoma in pregnancy can be managed successfully.", 
    "150": "Despite their clinical relevance as important cardiovascular modulators, there are few studies regarding the potential protective effect of \u03b2-blockers against immunosuppressive-induced cardiovascular side effects. This study investigated the possible ameliorating effect of \u03b21-blocker, metoprolol (MTP), against both hypertensive and nephrotoxic effects of cyclosporine A (CSA). Compared with vehicle (olive oil)-treated rats, chronic treatment with CSA (20 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d subcutaneous, for 14 days) increased systolic blood pressure, elevated renal function indices and plasma renin activity, impaired renovascular responsiveness of isolated perfused rat kidneys to endothelium-dependent vasodilations induced by carbachol. These effects were abolished upon concurrent administration of MTP (5 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d for 14 days, intraperitoneal). The possibility that alterations in the antioxidant and/or circulating cytokine levels contributed to the CSA-MTP interaction was also investigated. MTP abrogated the oxidative (superoxide dismutase, catalase), lipid peroxidation (malondialdyde), and elevated the cytokine (TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2) effects of CSA. Histologically, CSA caused tubular brush border loss and isometric vacuolization clustered in the proximal tubule; this effect disappeared in rats cotreated with MTP. The use of a nonhypotensive dose of MTP (1.25 mg/kg) countered in part endothelium dysfunction altered oxidative stress parameters and cytokine levels in CSA-treated rats. Collectively, MTP abrogates both the hypertensive and the nephrotoxic effects of CSA via ameliorating endothelium dysfunction, oxidative stress, and upregulated cytokine levels caused by CSA. The demonstration of nephroprotection by the low dose of MTP suggests that its renal effect may be partially unrelated to its hemodynamic activity.", 
    "151": "Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the primary risk factor for glaucoma, a blinding eye disease. Cannabinoid agonists have long been known to decrease IOP, suggesting they may be useful in glaucoma treatment. However, the specific mechanism by which cannabinoids generate this ocular hypotensive effect remains unknown. The current evidence suggests the cannabinoids reduce IOP through actions at cannabinoid 1 (CB(1)) receptors within the eye, and adrenergic receptors (ARs) may also contribute to this action of cannabinoids. Considering this, the present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism behind the ocular hypotensive properties of cannabinoids through the use of mice genetically lacking either cannabinoid receptors or \u03b2ARs. Cannabinoid agonists, \u03b2AR antagonists, and \u03b2AR agonists decreased IOP in wild-type mice and CB(2)(-/-) mice. In contrast, none of these compounds were found to reduce IOP in \u03b2AR(-/-) or CB(1)(-/-) mice. Desensitization of the \u03b2ARs and depletion of catecholamines in wild-type mice also eliminated the ability of the cannabinoid agonist (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone mesylate (WIN 55,212-2) to reduce IOP, strongly implicating a role for both \u03b2ARs and catecholamines in the ocular hypotensive properties of cannabinoids. Finally, CB(1) receptors were shown to colocalize with tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for adrenergic neurons. Taken together, these findings suggest that \u03b2ARs are required for the ocular hypotensive properties of cannabinoids, and cannabinoids reduce IOP by acting as indirect sympatholytics and inhibiting norepinephrine release within the eye.",

    "196": "Rats and rabbits were divided into control, ketamine, metoprolol alone and ketamine plus metoprolol groups. Ketamine (40 mg\u00b7kg(-1) \u00b7day(-1), i.p.) and metoprolol (20 mg\u00b7kg(-1) \u00b7day(-1), p.o.) were administered continuously for 12 weeks in rats and 8 weeks in rabbits. Cardiac function, electrophysiological disturbances, cardiac collagen, cardiomyocte apoptosis and the remodelling-related proteins were evaluated.", 
    "197": "Rabbits treated with ketamine showed decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, slowed ventricular conduction velocity and increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia. Metoprolol prevented these pathophysiological alterations. In ketamine-treated rats, cardiac collagen volume fraction and apoptotic cell number were higher than those of control animals; these effects were prevented by co-administration of metoprolol. Consistently, the expressions of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases-1, apoptosis-inducing factor and NF-\u03baB-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells were all increased after ketamine treatment and sharply reduced after metoprolol administration. Moreover, ketamine enhanced sympathetic sprouting, manifested as increased growth-associated protein 43 and tyrosine TH expression. These effects of ketamine were prevented by metoprolol.", 
    "198": "Chronic treatment with ketamine caused significant ventricular myocardial apoptosis, fibrosis and sympathetic sprouting, which altered the electrophysiological properties of the heart and increased its susceptibility to malignant arrhythmia that may lead to sudden cardiac death. Metoprolol prevented the cardiotoxicity of ketamine, indicating a promising new therapeutic strategy.",

The underlying cause however was myxedema. Were it not for the presence of hypothermia, the correct diagnosis of myxedema secondary to severe hypothyroidism could have been missed. We also briefly review the pathophysiology and treatment of myxedema.",

Paying close attention to all the details of the case eventually uncovered the underlying severe hypothyroidism and myxedema.

It is also paying close attention to all of the information presented that allows one to not miss any key pieces central to the final diagnosis.", 
    "202": "Both osteoporosis and high blood pressure are major diseases in aging populations. Recent studies demonstrated that some antihypertensive drugs reduced the risk of bone fracture in elderly patients. Although calcium channel blockers (CCB) are widely used as first-line antihypertensive agents, there is no evidence that they prevent osteoporosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of two types of CCB on bone metabolism: cilnidipine (L-/N-type CCB), which suppresses norepinephrine release from the sympathetic nerve, and amlodipine (L-type CCB). In ovariectomized female spontaneous hypertensive rats, administration of cilnidipine, but not amlodipine, resulted in a significant increase in the ratio of alkaline phosphatase to tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and a decrease in the number of osteoclasts, as assessed by TRAP staining in the proximal tibia. Bone mineral density, moreover, was significantly higher in the cilnidipine group as compared with the amlodipine group and was associated with a significant decrease in a urinary collagen degradation product (deoxypyridinoline). The degree of prevention of osteoporosis by cilnidipine was similar to that of carvedilol (a \u03b2-blocker) because \u03b2-blockers reduce fracture risks though the inhibition of osteoclast activation. Interestingly, these effects cannot be attributed to the reduction of blood pressure because all three drugs significantly decreased blood pressure. In contrast, both cilnidipine and carvedilol, but not amlodipine, significantly decreased heart rate, indicating that both cilnidipine and carvedilol suppressed sympathetic nervous activity. Overall, our present data showed that cilnidipine (L-/N-type CCB) ameliorated osteoporosis in ovariectomized hypertensive rats. These pleiotropic effects of antihypertensive drugs such as cilnidipine and carvedilol might provide additional benefits in the treatment of hypertensive postmenopausal women.",

    "204": "A multivariable Cox model was developed to identify baseline predictors of developing resistant hypertension among 3666 previously untreated Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial (ASCOT) patients and construct a risk score to identify those at high risk. Secondary analyses included evaluations among all 19\u200a257 randomized patients.", 
    "205": "One-third (1258) of previously untreated, and one-half (9333) of all randomized patients (incidence rates 75.2 and 129.7 per 1000 person-years, respectively) developed resistant hypertension during a median follow-up of 5.3 and 4.8 years, respectively. Increasing strata of baseline SBP (151-160, 161-170, 171-180, and >180\u200ammHg) were associated with increased risk of developing resistant hypertension [hazard ratio 1.24 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.81-1.88), 1.50 (1.03-2.20), 2.15 (1.47-3.16), and 4.43 (3.04-6.45), respectively]. Diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, male sex, and raised BMI, fasting glucose, and alcohol intake were other significant determinants of resistant hypertension. Randomization to amlodipine\u200a\u00b1\u200aperindopril vs. atenolol\u200a\u00b1\u200athiazide [0.57 (0.50-0.60)], previous use of aspirin [0.78 (0.62-0.98)], and randomization to atorvastatin vs. placebo [0.87 (0.76-1.00)] significantly reduced the risk of resistant hypertension. Secondary analysis results were similar. The risk score developed allows accurate risk allocation (Harrell's C-statistic 0.71), with excellent calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow \u03c7 statistics, P\u200a=\u200a0.99). A 12-fold (8.4-17.4) increased risk among those in the highest vs. lowest risk deciles was apparent.",

    "207": "There has been a dramatic evolution in the treatment of laryngotracheal hemangiomas during the past decade and recent accounts and case reports of propranolol treatment have been encouraging. The purpose of the study is to determine the clinical course and outcomes of treating laryngotracheal hemangiomas at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in the last 8 years with the various modalities. We review with contemporary surgical techniques, including propranolol, and determine the results, limitations and complications. The study was a retrospective review of all patients referred to the Otolaryngology service at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with symptomatic laryngotracheal hemangiomas between January 2002 and December 2010. The study consisted of 30 infants, ranging in age from 1 to 18 months at time of diagnosis. Surgical interventions included open surgical excision, laser surgery, microdebrider excision and/or propranolol therapy. The main outcome measures include improvement in symptoms, decannulation, number of required treatments and airway size. All but two patients underwent an initial trial of steroids. Thirteen patients underwent open surgical excision, 9 requiring cartilage grafts and 12 were done in a single stage. Twelve surgical patients remained asymptomatic. One patient with diffuse mediastinal disease experiencing postoperative airway symptoms despite a normal appearing airway improved on propranolol. Two patients underwent at least 2 laser ablations, 4 responded to systemic steroids alone, and 1 had microdebrider resection. In the last 14 months, 12 patients have had propranolol therapy at a dose of 2mg/kg divided every 8h. Eight patients improved clinically within 1 week of initiating treatment. Four patients failed to respond to propranolol therapy; 1 patient subsequently underwent open excision and the other continued with a tracheostomy for 18 months and finally was decannulated. A third patient had a partial response, but remains relatively asymptomatic. A fourth patient has had no response at all. There were no major complications from propranolol; minor complications included diarrhea and decreased appetite. This study gives an overview of the evolution of hemangioma treatment at our institution over the last 8 years. Surgical excision remains an effective treatment for subglottic hemangiomas. Carefully administered, propranolol may demonstrate efficacy as a first-line agent in most cases avoiding surgery, tracheostomy, prolonged steroids, or as treatment of diffuse and unresectable disease. However, some lesions may be resistant to propranolol and require surgery or long-term steroids.", 
    "208": "The Arab Middle East is a unique region of the developing world where little is known about the outcomes of patients hospitalized with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), despite playing an important role in the global burden of cardiovascular disease. The primary objectives of this observational study were to compare patients with ACS hospitalized in the Arab Middle East to patients enrolled in a multinational non-Arabian ACS registry. The study cohort consisted of patients hospitalized in 2007 with an ACS including 4,445 from the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) and 6,706 from the Gulf Registry of Acute Coronary Events (Gulf RACE). Average age of patients in Gulf RACE was nearly a decade younger than that in GRACE (56 vs 66 years). Patients in Gulf RACE were more likely to be men, diabetic, and smoke and less likely to be hypertensive compared to patients in GRACE. Patients in Gulf RACE had higher odds of receiving aspirin and a lower likelihood of receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2 blockers, and clopidogrel during their index hospitalization. Although most eligible patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Gulf RACE received thrombolytics, most of their counterparts in GRACE underwent a primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Multivariable adjusted in-hospital case-fatality rates were not significantly different between patients in Gulf RACE and those in GRACE. In conclusion, despite differences in patient characteristics and treatment practices, short-term mortality rates were comparable in patients with ACS enrolled in these 2 registries. Future studies should explore the effects of these differences on long-term prognosis and other pertinent patient outcomes.", 
    "209": "Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia have been known to us for centuries. Significant improvements have been made in our knowledge of the disease, however, delivery remains the only effective form of treatment. There is widespread variation of practice in the management of hypertensive disease in pregnancy, which may lead to substandard care. The use of aspirin in preventing pre-eclampsia, the lack of correlation between urinary protein and adverse outcome, and the ineffectiveness of corticosteroids in the management of hemolysis and elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syndrome are a few of the developments that will alter the way this condition is managed. This article aims to provide a general overview of pre-eclampsia, eclampsia and hemolysis, hemolysis and elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syndrome supported by the latest evidence, which will help the care provider adopt a focused approach and use the latest knowledge to understand and manage this old condition.", 
    "210": "Patients with vascular diseases mainly caused by atherosclerosis, that are undergoing nonvascular surgery, often have co-existing conditions which affect their cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular complications are among the most common perioperative complications including respiratory complications and infections. These include coronary disease, hypertension, heart insufficiency, pulmonary hypertension, and renovascular hypertension, among others. Preoperative preparation must include the use of beta-blocker therapy, antihypertensive, antithrombotic and antilipogenic therapy. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and trans-thoracic echocardiography are the minimum preoperative diagnostic evaluations that should be performed, because complications may arise even in patients without prior cardiovascular symptomatology. Venous diseases are the most common contemporary diseases affecting people of all age groups and races. Invasive-diagnostic-therapeutic procedures may cause lesions of venous endothelium, hence perioperative prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with the use of heparin or low-molecular -weight heparin (LMWH) should be undertaken.",

Eyes were randomly assigned to receive either postoperative topical dorzolamide 2%-timolol 0.5% twice a day or no additional drops (control group). Standard postoperative topical antibiotics and corticosteroids were used by all patients.", 
    "213": "A total of 21 patients were recruited for the study. Four were excluded because of noncompliance with use of dorzolamide-timolol. In the remaining 17 patients, 8 were randomly assigned to the dorzolamide-timolol group and 9 to the control group. Topical dorzolamide-timolol drops twice a day did not affect the duration of SF6 gas tamponade after pars plana vitrectomy (17.1 vs. 18.1 days with no drops, P = 0.35). The difference in mean gas duration was -1.0 days with a 95% confidence interval of -3.2 days to 1.2 days. Secondary analyses did not reveal a difference in SF6 duration based on lens status, presence of diabetes or hypertension, vitrectomy versus combined buckle with vitrectomy, or patient age.",

    "215": "Xamoterol, a partial \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist, has been reported to impair the retrieval of hippocampus-dependent spatial reference memory in rats. In contrast, xamoterol restores memory retrieval in gene-targeted mice lacking norepinephrine (NE) and in a transgenic mouse model of Down syndrome in which NE levels are reduced. Restoration of retrieval by xamoterol in these two models complements the observation that NE and \u03b2(1) signaling are required for hippocampus-dependent retrieval of contextual and spatial reference memory in wild-type mice and rats. Additional evidence indicates that cAMP-mediated PKA and Epac signaling are required for the retrieval of hippocampus-dependent memory. As a result, we hypothesized that xamoterol has effects in addition to the stimulation of \u03b2(1) receptors that, at higher doses, act to counter the effects of \u03b2(1) signaling. Here we report that xamoterol-induced disruption of memory retrieval depends on \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor signaling. Interestingly, the impairment of memory retrieval by xamoterol is blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, an uncoupling agent for G(i/o) signaling, suggesting that \u03b2(2) signaling opposes \u03b2(1) signaling during memory retrieval at the level of G protein and cAMP signaling. Finally, similar to the time-dependent roles for NE, \u03b2(1), and cAMP signaling in hippocampus-dependent memory retrieval, xamoterol only impairs retrieval for several days after training, indicating that its effects are also limited by the age of the memory. We conclude that the disruption of memory retrieval by xamoterol is mediated by G(i/o)-coupled \u03b2(2) signaling, which opposes the G(s)-coupled \u03b2(1) signaling that is transiently required for hippocampus-dependent emotional memory retrieval.", 
    "216": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied for system understanding and prediction of drug release properties from direct compacted matrix tablets using sucrose esters (SEs) as matrix-forming agents for controlled release of a highly water soluble drug, metoprolol tartrate. Complexity of the system was presented through the effects of SE concentration and tablet porosity at various hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values of SEs ranging from 0 to 16. Both effects contributed to release behaviors especially in the system containing hydrophilic SEs where swelling phenomena occurred. A self-organizing map neural network (SOM) was applied for visualizing interrelation among the variables and multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLPs) were employed to generalize the system and predict the drug release properties based on HLB value and concentration of SEs and tablet properties, i.e., tablet porosity, volume and tensile strength. Accurate prediction was obtained after systematically optimizing network performance based on learning algorithm of MLP. Drug release was mainly attributed to the effects of SEs, tablet volume and tensile strength in multi-dimensional interrelation whereas tablet porosity gave a small impact. Ability of system generalization and accurate prediction of the drug release properties proves the validity of SOM and MLPs for the formulation modeling of direct compacted matrix tablets containing controlled release agents of different material properties.",

    "221": "Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) is currently the only therapeutic approach that preserves visual function in primary open-angle glaucoma. In making treatment decisions for first- and second-line therapy, the clinician needs to provide an appropriate balance of efficacy and tolerability. Prostaglandin analogues (PGAs) are frequently used as first-line monotherapy, because of their efficacy and low risk of systemic side effects. Similarly, PGA-based fixed combinations are frequently used in patients who progress or fail to achieve the target IOP.",

    "223": "In the clinical trial and meta-analysis data identified, bimatoprost 0.03% seems to be associated with a greater overall ability to lower IOP compared with latanoprost, travoprost or tafluprost, at the cost of a slightly higher incidence of conjunctival hyperaemia. Studies indicate that patients' adherence to treatment is generally better with PGAs than with many other monotherapies. In patients requiring more than one IOP-lowering agent, fixed combination treatments may provide improved adherence and tolerability benefits compared with concomitant use of individual treatments. Bimatoprost/timolol fixed combination appears to be slightly more efficacious than latanoprost/timolol or travoprost/timolol, and tolerability differences between the fixed combinations appear to be slight, probably because the addition of timolol to the PGA component lessens the associated hyperaemia. Surveys on EU physician attitudes appear largely in line with these clinical data.", 
    "224": "An appropriate balance between efficacy and tolerability ensures optimum IOP lowering and reduces the risk of non-adherence. PGAs largely fulfil this need as monotherapies and as components of combinations."
