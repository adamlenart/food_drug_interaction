We investigated mechanisms underlying these effects of ZD6126 in rats by continuously monitoring their heart rate and blood pressure and by assessing heart histopathology and plasma troponin T levels. ZD6126 induced acute transient hemodynamic changes (hypertension and delayed tachycardia), which were associated with statistically significant increases in circulating troponin T levels (median level 3 hours after treatment with vehicle or 12.5 mg/kg ZD6126: <9 pg/mL and 563 pg/mL, respectively; P <.001 [two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test]) and in the incidence of left ventricular myocardial fiber necrosis (incidence 24 hours after treatment with vehicle or 12.5 mg/kg ZD6126: 0/10 rats and 9/10 rats, respectively; P <.001 [two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test]). Pretreatment of rats with atenolol and nifedipine ameliorated the acute hemodynamic changes and prevented ZD6126-induced increases in both troponin T and myocardial necrosis but did not prevent ZD6126-induced tumor necrosis in an Hras5 tumor xenograft model in nude rats. Our findings suggest that ZD6126-induced acute hemodynamic changes are a prerequisite for cardiac damage in rats.",

Certain subgroups, such as individuals with diabetes mellitus, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), metabolic syndrome, or other comorbidities, have a particularly high residual risk. Patients at high risk for future CHD events often require multiple aggressive risk-reduction therapies (eg, antiplatelet agents, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blockade, cholesterol and/or diabetes management, and lifestyle interventions) to further lower their overall cardiovascular risk.

    "30": "Angina pectoris is usually the first clinical sign of underlying myocardial ischemia, which results from an imbalance between oxygen supply and oxygen demand in the heart. This report describes the pharmacology of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists as it relates to the treatment of angina. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are widely used in long-term maintenance therapy to prevent acute ischemic episodes in patients with chronic stable angina. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists competitively inhibit the binding of endogenous catecholamines to beta1-adrenoceptors in the heart. Their anti-ischemic effects are due primarily to a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. By decreasing heart rate, myocardial contractility and afterload, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists reduce myocardial workload and oxygen consumption at rest as well as during periods of exertion or stress. Predictable adverse effects include bradycardia and cardiac depression, both of which are a direct result of the blockade of cardiac beta1-adrenoceptors, but adverse effects related to the central nervous system (eg, lethargy, sleep disturbances, and depression) may also be bothersome to some patients. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists must be used cautiously in patients with diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, and asthma or other obstructive airway diseases. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may be used in combination with nitrates or calcium channel blockers, which takes advantage of the diverse mechanisms of action of drugs from each pharmacologic category. Moreover, concurrent use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may alleviate the reflex tachycardia that sometimes occurs with other antianginal agents.",

This study was performed in 5 groups of 17-week-old male SHR treated for 3 weeks as follows: group 1, control; group 2, L-NAME (50 mg/L in drinking); group 3, L-NAME plus aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone (SPRL, 100 mg/kg/day); group 4, L-NAME plus angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, telmisartan (TELM, 3 mg/kg/day); group 5, L-NAME plus combination therapy (COMB) with low-dose TELM (1 mg/kg/day) and SPRL (100 mg/kg/day). Urinary protein excretion and the glomerular injury score were significantly reduced in the SPRL, TELM, and COMB groups as compared with the L-NAME group, while significant blood pressure reduction was observed only in the TELM group. In the TELM and COMB groups, the perivascular cell infiltration and fibrosis area were significantly reduced together with the PPAR-gamma mRNA increase and TGF- beta(1) mRNA decrease. The urinary excretion of nitric oxides was significantly recovered and the wall to lumen ratio of the interlobular artery was significantly reduced only in the COMB group compared with the L-NAME group. Combined administration of 1 mg/kg/day telmisartan and 100 mg/kg/day spironolactone is thought to be effective in alleviating hypertensive renal injuries independently of blood pressure changes. The anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects due to PPAR-gamma activation and TGF-beta(1) inhibition may participate in the renoprotection of this combination therapy.",

All patients were followed up for a median of 14 months (first quartile 10, third quartile 18) after diagnostic coronary angiography (without percutaneous intervention for a clinically driven decision). Mean diameter stenosis of the LAD was 58 +/- 10%. Mean CFR of the LAD was 2.09 +/- 0.5. Regional wall motion abnormality at peak stress was present in 17 patients. During follow-up, 24 events occurred: 6 nonfatal ST-elevation myocardial infarctions and 18 non-ST-elevation myocardial infarctions. Thirty-month spontaneous event-free survival was higher in patients with normal CFR and lower in patients with decreased CFR (86% vs 30%, p = 0.0001). At Cox analysis, a CFR <2 (hazard ratio 24.2, 95% confidence interval 3.2 to 179.7, p = 0.002) was the only independent prognostic predictor of outcome.

    "59": "Hard gelatin capsule was coated by a cellulose acetate as a semipermeable membrane with or without castor oil and filled with propranolol hydrochloride and sorbitol as an osmotic agent. After sealing the capsule with white bees wax plug, the onset of release and dissolution rate of the drug were studied. Water penetration into the capsule from the dissolution medium increases simultaneously the osmotic and hydrostatic pressures of its content. When the hydrostatic pressure is high enough to overweigh the gravity and frictional forces of the plug, the expulsion of the plug occurs and drug release starts. The effects of thicknesses of the membrane and plug as well as the concentrations of cellulose acetate and castor oil on the onset of drug release were presented by a polynomial model. We found that the effect of plug thickness on the onset of release is more important when the membrane is thicker. The results showed that the presence of caster oil in coating formulation (cellulose acetate 10% or 15%) increased the onset of release (t(o) values). The onset of release varied from 0.6 to 10.5 hr among which the onset times of 4.2, 4.8, 5.9, 5.5, 7.5, 5.0, 7.8 and 10.5 hr could be of use for either chronotherapeutic purposes in protection of patients against heart attacks and strokes during early morning hours or reducing daily frequency of dosage.", 
    "60": "This study was designed to assess autonomic effects on the QT interval during recovery from exercise. Exercise is associated with an acute increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Evidence of impaired parasympathetic activity, such as low heart rate variability and heart rate recovery, and an increased QT interval are also associated with increased mortality. However, there is no clear pathophysiological link among these findings. Bicycle exercise testing was performed serially in 33 healthy volunteers (19 men; ages, 54 +/- 7 yr) under four conditions: 1) baseline, 2) beta-adrenergic blockade-intravenous propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) administered during exercise, 3) parasympathetic blockade-intravenous atropine (0.04 mg/kg) administered during exercise, and 4) double blockade with propranolol and atropine. ECGs were obtained every minute in recovery for 10 min and then at the 15th and 20th min, from which the QT and RR intervals were measured. Linear regression analyses were used to assess the individual QT-RR relationships for each subject for each condition. Relative to baseline, the QT-RR relationship with parasympathetic blockade was shifted to the left and had a steeper slope. In contrast, the QT-RR relationship with beta-adrenergic blockade was shifted to the right and had a less steep slope. The baseline and double-blockade QT-RR relationships were in the middle and essentially superimposable. There was a negative relationship between QT-RR slope and heart rate or RR interval recoveries, but it was significant only for the 1- and 2-min RR interval recoveries with low R(2) values of 0.124 and 0.114. The main parasympathetic effect in the postexercise recovery period is to counteract the sympathetically mediated QT prolongation. These data support the concept that parasympathetic tone may provide a natural antiarrhythmic effect during this time.", 
    "61": "Heart rate (HR) power spectral indexes are limited as measures of the cardiac autonomic nervous systems (CANS) in that they neither offer an effective marker of the beta-sympathetic nervous system (SNS) due to its overlap with the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) in the low-frequency (LF) band nor afford specific measures of the CANS due to input contributions to HR [e.g., arterial blood pressure (ABP) and instantaneous lung volume (ILV)]. We derived new PNS and SNS indexes by multisignal analysis of cardiorespiratory variability. The basic idea was to identify the autonomically mediated transfer functions relating fluctuations in ILV to HR (ILV-->HR) and fluctuations in ABP to HR (ABP-->HR) so as to eliminate the input contributions to HR and then separate each estimated transfer function in the time domain into PNS and SNS indexes using physiological knowledge. We evaluated these indexes with respect to selective pharmacological autonomic nervous blockade in 14 humans. Our results showed that the PNS index derived from the ABP-->HR transfer function was correctly decreased after vagal and double (vagal + beta-sympathetic) blockade (P < 0.01) and did not change after beta-sympathetic blockade, whereas the SNS index derived from the same transfer function was correctly reduced after beta-sympathetic blockade in the standing posture and double blockade (P < 0.05) and remained the same after vagal blockade. However, this SNS index did not significantly decrease after beta-sympathetic blockade in the supine posture. Overall, these predictions were better than those provided by the traditional high-frequency (HF) power, LF-to-HF ratio, and normalized LF power of HR variability.", 
    "62": "The Clinical Trials described in this article were presented at the Hotline and Clinical Trial Update Sessions of the European Society of Cardiology Congress held in September 2007 in Vienna, Austria. The sessions chosen for this article represent the scope of interest of Cardiovascular Drugs and Therapy. The presentations should be considered preliminary, as further analyses could alter the final publication of the results of these studies. PROSPECT evaluated echocardiographic criteria for optimal selection of patients with moderate to severe heart failure who may benefit from cardiac resynchronisation therapy, however concluded that no single echocardiographic measure can be recommended. EVEREST found that tolvaptan, a vasopressin V(2) antagonist, resulted in early weight reduction and improvement of dyspnoea in patients with acute heart failure, but lacked long term improvement. In ARISE, the anti-oxidant succinobucal did not affect the primary outcome in high risk cardiovascular patients, but improved the combination of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke, and diabetic control in diabetics. ALOFT showed that the addition of the renin inhibitor aliskiren to an ACE inhibitor or ARB and a beta-blocker leads to favourable effects on neurohormonal actions in heart failure. FINESSE markedly improved coronary patency before PCI with half-dose reteplase/abciximab in STEMI patients, however without significantly improving short-term outcome. The Prague-8 Study evaluated whether routine clopidogrel administered >6 h pre-angiography would be a safe way to achieve therapeutic drug levels in case a follow-up intervention would be considered immediately, but appeared not justified because of bleeding complications. CARESS in MI showed that high risk patients with evolving STEMI who undergo thrombolytic therapy should undergo PCI early after the thrombolysis. Finally, the ACUITY trial found that in moderate or high risk Non ST elevation ACS patients triaged to PCI, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, or medical management, bivalirudin, with or without associated GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy, resulted in a marked reduction of bleeding at 30 days whilst preserving the ischemic and mortality benefit at 1 year follow up.", 
    "63": "Recently, a cholinergic neurogenic component of contraction has been characterised in the aganglionic mouse vas deferens. In this paper, a cholinergic component of contraction in the guinea-pig vas deferens is characterised pharmacologically. A residual, tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX, 0.3 microM), neurogenic contraction was revealed after prolonged exposure (5 h) to the adrenergic neurone blocker bretylium (20 microM) or in the presence of prazosin (100 nM) and alpha,beta-methylene ATP (1 microM), a purinergic agonist which desensitizes P2X receptors. The bretylium-resistant component was potentiated by the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor neostigmine (10 microM) and inhibited by the muscarinic-receptor (mAChR) antagonist cyclopentolate (1 microM). Nicotine (30 microM) enhanced the bretylium-resistant component. Neostigmine increased the second component of contraction in the presence of prazosin and alpha,beta-methylene ATP, whilst yohimbine (1 microM), an alpha(2) adrenergic receptor antagonist, enhanced both the first and second components of the electrically evoked contraction. These enhanced contractions were blocked by cyclopentolate in both cases. Nicotine enhanced the cholinergic component of contraction revealed by neostigmine but failed to have any detectable effects in the presence of cyclopentolate. Neostigmine alone increased the slow component of contraction which was reversed by cyclopentolate to control levels. The M(3) receptor-antagonist 4-DAMP (10 nM) markedly inhibited the cholinergic component of contraction to a level comparable with cyclopentolate. Laser microscopy has shown that neostigmine also increased the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) transients remaining in smooth muscle cells after perfusion with prazosin and alpha,beta-methylene ATP, an effect blocked by 4-DAMP. These experimental data show that there is a functional cholinergic innervation in the guinea-pig vas deferens whose action is limited by acetylcholinesterase, blocked by cyclopentolate and mediated through M3 receptors. Moreover, by blocking the cholinesterase, the increased amount of ACh generates spontaneous Ca(2+) transients in smooth muscle cells.",

The clinical picture mimicked that of an acute myocardial infarction, manifesting as precordial pain, ST-segment depression followed by deep negative T waves and prolonging of the QT interval, slight increase in cardiac enzymes and coursing with transient apical ballooning of the left ventricle and hyperkinesis of the basal walls (conferring the aspect of \"apical ballooning\"), although in the absence of subepicardial coronary obstruction. Ventricular function normalized after the second week of clinical evolution.", 
    "65": "Caloric restriction (CR) extends the lifespan of various organisms and slows the onset of age-related disorders; however, little is known about the long-term effects of CR per se on bone. In the present study, we have examined the effects of life-long CR vs. ad libitum (AD) feeding, mainly on the trabecular bone of proximal tibiae in male C57BL/6 mice and F344 rats. Micro-computed tomography scanning of tibiae revealed that CR for 3-9 months caused a substantial decrease in three-dimensional bone volume with structural derangements. Bone histomorphometry revealed the reduced bone mass was due mainly to suppression of bone formation. In db/db mice with defective leptin receptor, CR was unable to decrease bone mass and suppress bone formation. The effect of CR on bone mass was inhibited by administration of a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol. Thus, CR may regulate bone formation through leptin signaling and elevated sympathetic nervous tone. Interestingly, the difference in bone volume between the CR and AD groups disappeared after 1 yr of age, and mice and rats on an additional extension of CR to natural death maintained higher bone mass than the AD groups, with reduced bone turnover, suggesting that CR slows skeletal aging by regulating the rate of bone turnover. This is the first report, to our knowledge, that has examined the effects of lifelong CR on bone metabolism and trabecular microstructure and documents its contrasting effects during maturation vs. the postmaturational, involutional period.",

    "68": "Doxazosin reduced the spontaneous ureteral contractility rates in a concentration-dependent fashion by 23% to 34%. A more pronounced relaxation effect by doxazosin was evident when epinephrine was introduced to the tissues. In 1 and 10-microM doxazosin-pretreated tissues, epinephrine caused 89% and 100% relaxation, respectively. Phenylephrine-induced contractions were antagonized by doxazosin but not reversed to any relaxant function. No differential expression of alpha(1)-receptor subtypes was identified in the obstructed versus normal ureters.", 
    "69": "The results of our study have shown that alpha(1)-receptor blockade decreases ureteral contractility and inverses the effect of epinephrine, providing even greater relaxation. We hypothesize that alpha receptor blockade might relax the ureter and induce stone passage by way of epinephrine activation of beta receptors. Additional studies should be performed to validate this hypothesis and to compare various alpha(1)-receptor subtype antagonists.",

Exercise capacity by spiroergometry was not altered by either drug. Relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with immunosuppressants was not seen under ivabradine; safety laboratory values were unchanged. Mild adverse effects were noted in 45% of patients during beta-blocker and 20% during ivabradine treatment.

Guidelines from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology have been reported and advocated class I recommendations for perioperative beta-blockade only for patients previously taking beta-blockers and those patients with a positive stress test undergoing vascular surgery. There was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation in low-risk surgery.",

In patients who are not currently taking beta-blockers and in whom long-term therapy is not warranted, current evidence does not support instituting prophylactic therapy in the ambulatory surgery population.", 
    "77": "Short-term blood pressure (BP) variability is limited by the arterial baroreflex. Methods for measuring the spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) aim to quantify the gain of the transfer function between BP and pulse interval (PI) or the slope of the linear relationship between parallel BP and PI changes. These frequency-domain (spectral) and time-domain (sequence) techniques were tested in conscious mice equipped with telemetric devices. The autonomic relevance of these indexes was evaluated using pharmacological blockades. The significant changes of the spectral bandwidths resulting from the autonomic blockades were used to identify the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) zones of interest. The LF gain was 1.45 +/- 0.14 ms/mmHg, with a PI delay of 0.5 s. For the HF gain, the average values were 2.0 +/- 0.19 ms/mmHg, with a null phase. LF and HF bands were markedly affected by atropine. On the same 51.2-s segments used for cross-spectral analysis, an average number of 26.4 +/- 2.2 slopes were detected, and the average slope in resting mice was 4.4 +/- 0.5 ms/mmHg. Atropine significantly reduced the slopes of the sequence method. BRS measurements obtained using the sequence technique were highly correlated to the spectral estimates. This study demonstrates the applicability of the recent methods used to estimate spontaneous BRS in mice. There was a vagal predominance in the baroreflex control of heart rate in conscious mice in the present conditions.",

The present study was designed to assess whether conscious freely moving guineapigs can be used to predict QT prolongation in vivo. The guineapig has three advantages over the dog and the primate. First, it has specific ion channels similar to man; second, a smaller amount of test article is required for the investigation and third, its housing is less expensive. Under sterile conditions and isoflurane anaesthesia, telemetry transmitters were implanted intraperitoneally in male Dunkin Hartley guineapigs. Blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiographic intervals were measured from two days up to eight months. Chronic implantation of the telemetry device did not lead to anatomic or macroscopic alterations in the abdominal cavity and no inflammation of the peritoneum or infection was observed. Four reference compounds were used: three positive (sotalol, terfenadine and dofetilide) and one negative reference (enalapril). Single oral administration of all three positive references dose-dependently induced bradycardia and QT corrected (QTc) prolongation. In contrast, neither enalapril nor its vehicle prolonged the QTc. These results demonstrate that the guineapig is both a suitable model and a good alternative to dogs or primates to assess the potential of compounds for QT interval prolongation in the early stages of drug development.",

Significant risk factors for cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients over and above dyslipidemia, smoking, and obesity include coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular/carotid artery disease, and diabetes. Treatment options for the reduction of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients include diuretics, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone antagonists. All of these agents, in various combinations, have been found to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, even in high-risk patients. The use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (usually in combination with a diuretic) has proven especially effective in reducing cardiovascular events in diabetes and, although both classes of drugs target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, each has a different mechanism of action. Some investigators believe that combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and ARB, usually given with other medications, may be more effective than either agent alone with other drugs. The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) is evaluating the cardioprotective effect of an ACE inhibitor (ramipril) plus an ARB (telmisartan) in high-risk patients.",

There is evidence, however, that suggests that this response may be different if beta-blockers with vasodilating effects are used. This 12-week, multi-center, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study assessed the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of nebivolol, a cardioselective, vasodilating beta1-blocker, at doses of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg once daily in 300 African American patients with stage I or II hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure [SiDBP] > or =95 mm Hg and < or =109 mm Hg). The primary efficacy end point was the baseline-adjusted change in trough mean SiDBP. After 12 weeks, nebivolol significantly reduced least squares mean SiDBP (P< or =.004) at all doses of 5 mg and higher and sitting systolic blood pressure (P< or =.044) at all doses 10 mg and higher, compared with placebo. The drug was safe and well-tolerated, with no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events compared with placebo.

At the end of the beta-blocker titration period, a BP level <130/80 mm Hg was achieved in 37% of carvedilol-treated and 36% of metoprolol-treated participants who continued to receive a renin-angiotensin system blocker. In the approximately 60% of participants in whom a BP level <130/80 mm Hg was not attained with renin-angiotensin system blockade plus beta-blockade, hydrochlorothiazide was added in 43% and 44% of carvedilol and metoprolol groups, respectively; 25% (both arms) also required a calcium channel blocker. Among those in whom goal BP was not achieved, 42% of carvedilol- and 40% of metoprolol-treated participants were not titrated to the highest dose of beta-blocker.

    "118": "Carvedilol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking drug, is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6, UGT1A1, UGT2B4 and UGT2B7. This drug is administered orally as a racemic mixture of R(+)- and S(-)-enantiomers. It has been reported that CYP2D6 prefers metabolizing S-carvedilol to R-carvedilol stereoselectively. On the other hand, stereoselective metabolism of carvedilol by UGTs is still unclear. Moreover, we have reported that patients with chronic heart failure who had polymorphism in CYP2D6, UGT1A1 and/or UGT2B7 had lower metabolic activity and oral clearance than did patients with no polymorphism. The aim of this study was to clarify stereoselective metabolism of carvedilol by UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 and to determine by using a recombinant enzyme-introduced mutation whether genetic mutation in UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 causes reduction in metabolic activity for carvedilol. A glucuronidation assay using human liver microsomes and recombinant UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 expressed in HeLa cells demonstrated that UGT1A1 prefers metabolizing R-carvedilol to S-carvedilol. On the other hand, UGT2B7 prefers metabolizing S-carvedilol to R-carvedilol. Moreover, G71R mutation of UGT1A1 reduced both affinity and capacity but did not affect stereoselective metabolism. On the other hand, both A71S and H268Y mutations of UGT2B7 reduced capacity but did not affect affinity and, as a result, the efficiency of metabolism was remarkably reduced. However, as in the case of UGT1A1, neither of the mutations affected stereoselective metabolism.", 
    "119": "Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) has been reported to affect the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells by inhibiting endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity and to cause endothelial dysfunction in humans. This study was conducted in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to evaluate the effect of nebivolol, a selective beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, on ADMA concentration and on dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH2), the enzyme that regulates ADMA catabolism. Nebivolol dose-dependently decreased ADMA/symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) ratio (p from <0.01 to <0.001). This was parallelled by a dose-dependent increase in DDAH2 mRNA (p from <0.01 to <0.001) and protein expression (p from <0.01 to <0.001) and activity (p from <0.01 to <0.001). The small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of DDAH2 abolished the modification of DDAH2 expression (p<0.001) and ADMA/SDMA ratio (p<0.001) induced by nebivolol. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that nebivolol reduces ADMA concentration by increasing DDAH2 expression and activity. Our in vitro findings describe a novel vascular effect of nebivolol and clearly identify this compound as the first antihypertensive agent that modulates DDAH2 in endothelial cells.",

Contractile responses to electrical field stimulation of nerves (EFS, atropine 1 micromol L(-1) and N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine 100 micromol L(-1) present throughout) were examined in isolated strips of IAS. In the monkey IAS, EFS caused frequency dependent (1-30 Hz) contractions which were abolished by guanethidine (10 micromol L(-1)) or phentolamine (3 micromol L(-1)). The sympathetic neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA) also caused concentration-dependent (10 nmol L(-1)-100 micromol L(-1)) contractions which were abolished by phentolamine revealing a small relaxation that was abolished by propranolol (3 micromol L(-1)). In contrast, EFS caused only relaxation of the mouse and rabbit IAS which was not affected by guanethidine. Furthermore, NA relaxed these muscles and relaxation was nearly abolished by combined addition of phentolamine and propranolol. In conclusion, the monkey IAS is functionally innervated by sympathetic nerves that contract the muscle via excitatory alpha-adrenergic receptors. In contrast, no significant motor function could be identified for sympathetic nerves in the rabbit or mouse IAS although adrenergic receptors linked to muscle inhibition are present. These data reveal species dependent differences in sympathetic motor innervation and suggest that some species are more appropriate than others as models for motor innervation to the human IAS.",

An ACE-I and a BB, usually combined with diuretics and often with digoxin, continue to represent the cornerstones for the treatment of heart failure; moreover, most patients who are taking these drugs are now expected to receive as add-on therapies also an ARA and/or an ARB.

Now, much debate is over to which triple (ACE-I + BB + ARA or ARB) and quadruple (ACE-I + BB + ARA + ARB) therapies may be offered. Current guidelines do not fully address the aim of providing straightforward guidance about what should be the third drug of the triple therapy and as to whether or not quadruple therapy may have any role in the present-day heart failure management.

Quite recently, however, beta-blockers have been put under trial by results of some controlled studies and meta-analyses conducted in patients with essential hypertension. In summary, beta-blockers proved not better, or even worse, than alternative treatments and only marginally better than placebo. However, some arguments of caveat must be remarked. First, most of these studies have been conducted in hypertensive subjects of old age or complicated by several concomitant risk factors. A considerable portion of hypertensive patients most frequently examined in the usual practice would have not meet inclusion criteria for the above trials. In addition, several methodological issues of meta-analyses raised concern. Results were mainly driven from two major trials (LIFE and ASCOT). Unexpectedly, recent hypertension guidelines issued by the British Hypertension Society fully endorsed these results and recommended beta-blockers as fourth-line drugs in hypertensive patients with blood pressure not adequately controlled by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and diuretics in combination. Because most of the above trials used atenolol, several lines of evidence warn against extending limitations to beta-blockers to the entire class of these drugs. Some new-generation beta-blockers, although not yet widely tested in outcome-based studies, induce peripheral vasodilatation and do not exert the detrimental effect of atenolol on central blood pressure and arterial distensibility.

Potential factors that can promote arrhythmias in pregnancy or during labor and delivery, include the direct cardiac electrophysiological effects of hormones, changes in autonomic tone, hemodynamic perturbations, hypokalemia, and underlying heart disease. In this review, the basis for treatment of supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias are described. No drug therapy is usually needed for the management of supraventricular or ventricular premature beats, but potential stimulants, such as smoking, caffeine, and alcohol should be eliminated. In paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, vagal stimulation maneuvers should be attempted first. In pregnant women with atrial fibrillation, the goal of treatment is conversion to sinus rhythm by electrical cardioversion. Rate control can be achieved by a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker drug and/ or digoxin. Ventricular arrhythmias may occur in the pregnant women, specially when cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, or mitral valve prolapse exists. Electrical cardioversion or treatment with sotalol may be used (amiodarone is not safe for the fetus). Finally, in women with congenital long QT syndrome, beta-blocker therapy must be continued during pregnancy and postpartum period.",

The first is the competence of these target cells to respond to a remote stele-generated signal, and whether ethylene acts in concert with this signal to initiate abscission of the primary leaf in Phaseolus vulgaris. The second is to extend the concept of dual control of abscission cell competence. Can the concept of developmental memory that is retained by abscission cell of Phaseolus vulgaris post-separation in terms of the inductive/repressive control of beta-1,4-glucan endohydrolase (cellulase) activity exerted by ethylene/auxin be extended to the rachis abscission zone cells of Sambucus nigra?",

Using these explants, the role of ethylene was examined, using the ethylene action blocker, 1-methyl cyclopropene, as well as the significance of the tissue from which the stele signal originates. Further, leaf rachis abscission explants were excised from the compound leaves of S. nigra, and changes in the activity of cellulase in response to added ethylene and auxin post-separation was examined.",

Further, in addition to the leaf pulvinus distal to the abscission zone, mid-rib tissue that is excised from senescent or green mid-rib tissue can also generate a competent stelar signal. Experiments with rachis abscission explants of S. nigra have shown that auxin, when added to cells post-separation can retard cellulase activity, with activity re-established with subsequent ethylene treatment.",

In the present study, alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor knockout (alpha(2A)-KO) mice and their C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) controls were used to assess the glucoregulatory role of the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor subtype in vivo. Fasting and glucose-stimulated blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were determined with or without (+/-)-propranolol (5 mg/kg) or atropine (10 mg/kg) pre-treatment. Intraperitoneal glucose (1 g/kg) and insulin (0.5 and 1.0 IU/kg) tolerance tests were performed. Fasting plasma glucagon and corticosterone levels were measured. Blood glucose levels (mean+/-S.E.M.) were lower in alpha(2A)-KO males (7.2+/-0.6 mM) and females (7.2+/-0.2 mM) than in WT males (9.8+/-0.3 mM) and females (9.1+/-0.3 mM). Plasma insulin levels were higher in alpha(2A)-KO males (2.2+/-0.5 microg/l) and females (1.7+/-0.3 microg/l) than in WT males (0.7+/-0.1 microg/l) and females (0.8+/-0.2 microg/l). These differences remained after pharmacological beta-adrenoceptor and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor inhibition. In spite of a tendency for slightly decreased insulin sensitivity in alpha(2A)-KO mice, glucose tolerance in alpha(2A)-KO mice was significantly better than in WT mice. However, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was not increased in alpha(2A)-KO mice compared to WT controls. Plasma glucagon levels, but not corticosterone levels, were elevated in alpha(2A)-KO mice. These results suggest that lack of inhibitory pancreatic beta-cell alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor function results in hyperinsulinaemia, reduced blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance in alpha(2A)-KO mice, and demonstrate a key role for the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor in adrenergic regulation of blood glucose and insulin homeostasis.",

Vascular expression (by Western blot), activity (by gelatin zymography), and mRNA levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were also reduced by carvedilol or probucol. Besides, pretreatment with carvedilol or probucol but not propranolol, a beta-blocker, or prazocin, an alpha-blocker, inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated expressions and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in human aortic smooth muscle cells. On electrophoretic mobility-shift assay, carvedilol inhibited the binding activities of activator protein-1 and specific protein-1, two major transcription factors for MMP promoter regions.

In this study, we utilized monochromatic synchrotron radiation (SR) microangiography to assess changes in pulmonary arteriole blood flow in the intact-chest rat after 4 wk of chronic hypoxia. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to normoxia (N-rats) or chronic hypoxia (10% O(2); CH-rats) for 28 days. Rats were anesthetized, and microangiography was performed on the left lung to assess 1) the branching distribution of pulmonary arteriole blood flow (internal diameter >80 microm) and 2) dynamic changes in vessel lumen diameter during acute hypoxic (8% O(2) for 4 min) pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) before and after beta-adrenoceptor blockade (2 mg/kg i.v. propranolol). Using SR angiography, we observed that the number of opaque third- and fourth-generation vessels (100-300 microm) for CH-rats was significantly fewer than the number for N-rats. The magnitude of HPV was not different between CH-rats and N-rats. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade accentuated the HPV in 200- to 300-microm vessels for CH-rats, but even more so in N-rats. However, in CH-rats, beta-adrenoceptor blockade also accentuated the HPV in 100- to 200-microm vessels. In summary, we utilized SR to assess gross blood flow changes and functional changes (i.e., HPV) of the pulmonary circulation in PAH. These results highlight the benefits of SR for assessing pulmonary circulatory pathology. Of particular importance, future use of SR will provide an effective method for assessing potential therapeutic treatments for PAH.",

We report the crystal structure of a human beta2-adrenergic receptor-T4 lysozyme fusion protein bound to the partial inverse agonist carazolol at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The structure provides a high-resolution view of a human G protein-coupled receptor bound to a diffusible ligand. Ligand-binding site accessibility is enabled by the second extracellular loop, which is held out of the binding cavity by a pair of closely spaced disulfide bridges and a short helical segment within the loop. Cholesterol, a necessary component for crystallization, mediates an intriguing parallel association of receptor molecules in the crystal lattice. Although the location of carazolol in the beta2-adrenergic receptor is very similar to that of retinal in rhodopsin, structural differences in the ligand-binding site and other regions highlight the challenges in using rhodopsin as a template model for this large receptor family.",

Analysis of adrenergic receptor ligand-binding mutants within the context of the reported high-resolution structure of beta2AR-T4L provides insights into inverse-agonist binding and the structural changes required to accommodate catecholamine agonists. Amino acids known to regulate receptor function are linked through packing interactions and a network of hydrogen bonds, suggesting a conformational pathway from the ligand-binding pocket to regions that interact with G proteins.",

No ligands suitable for this purpose are available for human use. In order to prepare a tracer for human studies, we labeled the biologically active enantiomer of the beta-blocker exaprolol with (11)C. Exaprolol has the appropriate lipophilicity (log P + 1.6) for entry of the CNS and is claimed to be a very potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. (S)-Desisopropyl-exaprolol was synthesized by reaction of 2-hexylphenol with (S)-glycidyl-nosylate followed by ring opening using ammonia gas. The desisopropyl precursor was reacted with (11)C-acetone in methanol to produce (S)-[(11)C]-exaprolol. Radiochemical purification was performed with RP-HPLC and was followed by Sep-Pak formulation. The labeled product was i.v. injected into male Wistar rats. Brain images were acquired using a microPET Focus 220 and the biodistribution of (11)C was assessed. The radiochemical yield of (S)-[(11)C]-exaprolol was 7% with a total synthesis time of 30 min. Specific activities were >10 GBq/micromol. Brain uptake of the tracer reached a maximum after 15 min. Standardized uptake values were moderate (0.5-0.9) but sufficient for imaging. However, beta-blockade (propranolol, 2.5mg/kg body weight) did not lower tracer uptake in any CNS region and washout from the brain was not accelerated when propranolol was administered 40 min after injection of (S)-[(11)C]-exaprolol. Tracer binding in lung, spleen and erythrocytes was lowered after beta-blockade, but the myocardial uptake of radioactivity was not affected. These data indicate that (S)-[(11)C]-exaprolol is not a suitable beta-adrenoceptor ligand for PET, probably because the in vivo affinity of exaprolol to beta-adrenoceptors is in the nM rather than the sub-nM range. The observed inhibition of tracer uptake in lung, spleen and erythrocytes seems due to an interaction of propranolol with amine transporters rather than beta-adrenoceptors.",

    "224": "We previously reported that piceatannol isolated from the rhizome extract of RHEUM UNDULATUM has a potent vasorelaxant activity. In the present study, the mechanisms underlying the direct vascular relaxant effect of piceatannol were investigated in isolated rat aorta. Piceatannol induced a concentration-dependent relaxation in aortic preparations precontracted with phenylephrine (EC (50) : 2.4 +/- 0.4 microM), which was completely inhibited by endothelial removal, N(omega)-nitro- L-arginine (nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), methylene blue and 1 H- oxadiazolo [4,3- A]quinoxalin-1-one (guanylyl cyclase inhibitor). The piceatannol-induced relaxation was also blocked by raising the extracellular K (+) (45 mM), 4-aminopyridine (voltage-sensitive K (+) channel blocker) and tetraethylammonium [the non-selective Ca (2+)-activated K (+) (K (Ca)) channel blocker] but not by indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor), atropine (muscarinic receptor antagonist), propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), verapamil and nifedipine (L-type voltage-gated Ca (2+) channel blocker), barium chloride (inward rectifier K (+) channel inhibitor) and glibenclamide (ATP-sensitive K (+) channel blocker). In further studies investigating the role of Ca (2+)-activated K (+) (K (Ca)) channels, piceatannol-induced relaxant responses were decreased by charybdotoxin [large (BK (Ca))- and intermediate (IK (Ca))-conductance K (Ca) channel blocker], iberiotoxin (selective BK (Ca) channels blocker), but not by apamin [small-conductance K (Ca) (SK (Ca)) channel blocker], TRAM-34 [intermediate-conductance K (Ca) (IK (Ca)) channel blocker]. The present results demonstrate that piceatannol-induced vascular relaxation in rat aorta may be mediated by an endothelium-dependent nitric oxide signaling pathway, at least partially, through the activation of BK (Ca).",

    "229": "To better understand the central mechanisms that mediate increases in heart rate (HR) during psychological stress, we examined the effects of systemic and intramedullary (raphe region) administration of the serotonin-1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetraline (8-OH-DPAT) on cardiac changes elicited by restraint in hooded Wistar rats with preimplanted ECG telemetric transmitters. 8-OH-DPAT reduced basal HR from 356 +/- 12 to 284 +/- 12 beats/min, predominantly via a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic mechanism. Restraint stress caused tachycardia (an initial transient increase from 318 +/- 3 to 492 +/- 21 beats/min with a sustained component of 379 +/- 12 beats/min). beta-Adrenoreceptor blockade with atenolol suppressed the sustained component, whereas muscarinic blockade with methylscopolamine (50 microg/kg) abolished the initial transient increase, indicating that sympathetic activation and vagal withdrawal were responsible for the tachycardia. Systemic administration of 8-OH-DPAT (10, 30, and 100 microg/kg) attenuated stress-induced tachycardia in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was suppressed by the 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY-100635 (100 microg/kg). Given alone, the antagonist had no effect. Systemically injected 8-OH-DPAT (100 microg/kg) attenuated the sympathetically mediated sustained component (from +85 +/- 19 to +32 +/- 9 beats/min) and the vagally mediated transient (from +62 +/- 5 to +25 +/- 3 beats/min). Activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the medullary raphe by microinjection of 8-OH-DPAT mimicked the antitachycardic effect of the systemically administered drug but did not affect basal HR. We conclude that tachycardia induced by restraint stress is due to a sustained increase in cardiac sympathetic activity associated with a transient vagal withdrawal. Activation of central 5-HT(1A) receptors attenuates this tachycardia by suppressing autonomic effects. At least some of the relevant receptors are located in the medullary raphe-parapyramidal area."
