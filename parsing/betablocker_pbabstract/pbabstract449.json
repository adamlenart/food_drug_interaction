The mechanism of these steroids could involve a pituitary or hypothalamic site of action, or both. Progesterone and TA did not alter the ability of GnRH to release LH or FSH either before, during, or after the gonadotropin surge induced by these steroids in estrogen-primed ovariectomized female rats. Furthermore, progesterone, TA and DOC were unable to induce a gonadotropin surge in short-term estrogen-primed castrated male rats. These results suggested a hypothalamic rather than a pituitary site of action of progesterone and corticosteroids in the release of gonadotropins. Since progestin and corticosteroid receptors are present in catecholamine neurons, a role for catecholamine neurotransmission in progesterone and corticosteroid-induced surges of LH and FSH in estrogen-primed ovariectomized rats was examined. Catecholamine synthesis inhibitors and specific alpha 1 (prazosin), alpha 2 (yohimbine), and beta (propranolol) receptor antagonists were used to determine the role of catecholamine neurotransmission in the steroid-induced surges of LH and FSH. Both of the catecholamine synthesis inhibitors, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine HCl (alpha-MPT), a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), an inhibitor of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, attenuated the ability of progesterone, TA, and DOC to induce LH surges when administered 3 h and 1 h, respectively, before the steroid. DDC also suppressed the ability of progesterone, TA, and DOC to induce FSH surges. Rats treated with alpha-MPT had lower mean FSH values than did steroid controls, but the effect was not significant. Both the alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenergic antagonists, prazosin and yohimbine, significantly suppressed the ability of progesterone, TA, and DOC to induce LH and FSH surges. In contrast, the beta adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol, had no effect upon the ability of progesterone, TA, or DOC to facilitate LH and FSH secretion. Finally, the stimulatory effect of progesterone and TA upon LH and FSH release was found to be blocked by prior treatment with a GnRH antagonist, further suggesting hypothalamic involvement. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that the stimulation of gonadotropin release by progesterone and corticosteroids is mediated through a common mechanism, and that this mechanism involves the release of GnRH, most likely through catecholaminergic stimulation. Furthermore, catecholamine neurotransmission, through alpha 1 and alpha 2 but not beta receptor sites, is required for the expression of progesterone and corticosteroid-induced surges of LH and FSH in estrogen-primed ovariectomized rats.", 
    "1": "We previously reported that 1 week of propranolol treatment (160 to 240 mg/d, orally) reduced resting metabolic rate (RMR) an average of 9% in healthy men. To determine whether this response was caused by the 25% reduction in serum triidothyronine (T3), rather than beta-adrenergic blockade, we examined the effect of nadolol on RMR in five healthy men. Nadolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist that does not affect T3 production. After 6 to 10 days of nadolol treatment (240 mg/d), mean postabsorptive RMR declined 7% (P less than .01), with no significant change in serum T3 or thyroxine (T4) concentrations. This effect is significantly different from that of a hospitalized control group that received no drug and had no change in mean RMR, and was not different from the response to propranolol (previously published data). Nadolol slightly reduced the mean thermic response to a meal (12%), but this effect was not statistically significant. Mean postprandial RMR was 8% lower after nadolol treatment (P less than .01), mainly because of the reduced postabsorptive RMR, rather than a change in the response to the meal. These data suggest that beta-adrenergic activity makes a small but significant contribution to resting energy expenditure in man.", 
    "2": "The effect of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, on the suppression of splenic mitogenic responsiveness induced by an aversive conditioned stimulus (CS) was evaluated in rats. Experiment 1 demonstrated that propranolol administration before presentation of the CS completely blocked the suppressive effect. In contrast, Experiment 2 showed that administration of propranolol during the training of the aversive CS had no effect on the suppressive effect of the CS in a subsequent test. These findings indicate that the release of catecholamines is responsible for the conditioned immune alteration of splenic lymphocytes. Taken further, these findings suggest that the learning of the conditioned immunomodulatory response to an aversive CS is a Pavlovian conditioning process that is not dependent on the performance of the conditioned response during training.", 
    "3": "The stability of amrinone and digoxin, procainamide hydrochloride, propranolol hydrochloride, sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, or verapamil hydrochloride in intravenous admixtures was studied. Admixtures of amrinone and digoxin were studied at one concentration. Amrinone admixtures with propranolol hydrochloride, sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, and verapamil hydrochloride were studied at two concentrations. In general, 0.45% sodium chloride injection was used as the diluent; 5% dextrose injection was also used for the procainamide hydrochloride experiments. Duplicate solutions of each test admixture and single-drug control admixture were prepared and stored for four hours at 22-23 degrees C under fluorescent light. Samples were analyzed by visual inspection, tested for pH, and assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Admixtures containing amrinone 1.25 or 2.5 mg/mL (as the lactate salt) and sodium bicarbonate 37.5 mg/mL precipitated immediately or within 10 minutes. No changes in pH or visual appearance were noted for amrinone admixtures with procainamide hydrochloride, digoxin, propranolol hydrochloride, potassium chloride, and verapamil hydrochloride. Appreciable degradation of both amrinone and procainamide was observed after four hours when the two were mixed in 5% dextrose. No degradation of amrinone or procainamide was seen when the 5% dextrose was replaced by 0.45% sodium chloride. Amrinone and sodium bicarbonate were incompatible in intravenous admixtures. Amrinone was compatible with digoxin, propranolol hydrochloride, potassium chloride, and verapamil hydrochloride. Amrinone and procainamide were compatible in 0.45% sodium chloride injection but not in 5% dextrose injection.", 
    "4": "A technique was developed to produce acute, reversible cardiac nerve blockade (CNB) in the conscious dog by infusion of 2% procaine into the pericardial (PC) space. During CNB, reflex changes in heart rate (HR) in response to intravenous bolus injections of phenylephrine (100 micrograms) and nitroglycerin (300 micrograms) and the reflex tachycardia and hypotension after a 50-micrograms bolus injection of veratridine into the left atrium were abolished. In response to CNB, HR increased from 79 +/- 10 to 142 +/- 10 beats/min and mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased from 101 +/- 5 to 117 +/- 6 mmHg. Baseline values for plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma norepinephrine (NE) were unchanged by CNB, but there was a small increase in plasma cortisol levels (1.4 +/- 0.3 to 2.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms/dl) during CNB. There was no significant change in the baseline levels of any of these hormones during PC infusion of 0.9% saline. To control for the possibility that procaine leaked into the systemic circulation, identical amounts of procaine were infused intravenously. Systemic administration of procaine caused a rise in MAP but had no effect on HR and did not alter plasma levels of AVP, PRA, NE, or cortisol. The relationship between plasma osmolality and plasma AVP, as well as the drinking response to a 60-min infusion of hypertonic NaCl, was unaltered by CNB. We conclude that PC procaine infusion is an effective technique for producing acute, reversible blockade of the cardiac nerves in the conscious dog.", 
    "5": "Effects of microinjection of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) into cardioinhibitory sites in the nucleus ambiguous (NA) or on single vagal cardioinhibitory neurons (VCN) were investigated in urethan-anesthetized rats. Sites containing cardioinhibitory neurons were identified by observing a marked and reproducible bradycardia in response to microiontophoretically applied (20-40 nA) or microinjected (20 nl) 0.1 M L-glutamate. In 35 of the 40 (87.5%) cardioinhibitory sites identified by microinjection of glutamate, ANF (20 nl of 10(-7) M) decreased heart rate (HR; -47.1 +/- 2.5 beats/min). No responses were elicited in the other five sites. In animals paralyzed and artificially ventilated, the HR effects of ANF were not significantly different before and after muscle paralysis. Microinjections of 10 nl of 10(-7) M ANF caused excitation of 19 of 21 VCN (90%), which was followed by a decrease in HR (-20.8 +/- 2.3 beats/min); no neuronal or cardiovascular responses were elicited by ANF in the remaining two VCN. Bilateral vagotomy or atropine sulfate (1 mg/kg iv) abolished cardiac slowing without affecting neuronal activation, whereas propranolol (2 mg/kg iv) did not affect either response to ANF. These results suggest that ANF is a neuromediator involved in the excitation of cardioinhibitory neurons in the NA.", 
    "6": "These experiments evaluated the contribution of renal alpha-adrenoceptors, renal beta-adrenoceptors, and extrarenal beta-adrenoceptors to increased plasma renin activity (PRA) during nonhypotensive hemorrhage in conscious dogs. Blood withdrawal at a rate of 16 g/kg body wt over 20 min increased PRA to nearly threefold control levels without decreasing mean arterial pressure. The PRA response to hemorrhage was reduced to a greater extent by simultaneous direct renal arterial (ira) infusion of phenoxybenzamine and propranolol than by propranolol alone. Phenoxybenzamine infusion ira did not block alpha-adrenoceptors located outside of the kidney. The PRA and heart rate responses to hemorrhage were both significantly reduced when propranolol was infused either ira or intravenously (iv) at a rate of 2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 20 min followed by 0.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1 continuous infusion. Propranolol infusion at a lower rate (0.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1 for 20 min followed by 0.12 microgram.kg-1.min-1) had little effect on the magnitude of increase in PRA when infused either iv or ira. The calculated renal arterial plasma propranolol concentration was at least fivefold higher or more during ira than during iv propranolol infusion at each rate and was approximately the same during ira infusion at the lower rate (17.5 +/- 0.7 ng/ml) as during iv infusion at the higher rate (16.7 +/- 2.4 ng/ml). These data indicate that the hemorrhage-induced increase in PRA is mediated by renal alpha-adrenoceptors and extrarenal beta-adrenoceptors, whereas renal beta-adrenoceptors appear to play little or no role.", 
    "7": "Biochemical studies have suggested a voltage-dependent dihydropyridine-sensitive catecholamine release in adrenal chromaffin cells. This release is inhibited by activation of alpha 2-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors; the underlying molecular mechanism is not known. We used undifferentiated PC-12 cells to study the effect of epinephrine and carbachol on transmembranous currents. Applying the patch-clamp technique in the whole cell configuration and using Ba2+ as charge carrier, we identified a high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel current. Both epinephrine (10 microM, in the presence of 1 microM propranolol) and carbachol (10 microM) reversibly inhibited the Ca2+ channel current by 30-40%. Yohimbine abolished and clonidine mimicked the effect of epinephrine. Phenylephrine failed to inhibit the Ca2+ channel current. The effect of carbachol was abolished by atropine. Epinephrine and carbachol did not affect the Ca2+ channel current reduced by the dihydropyridine, PN 200-110 (1 microM), suggesting a selective inhibition of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The Ca2+ channel current and its inhibition by receptor agonists were not influenced by intracellularly applied adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP; 100 microM). Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin or intracellular infusion of the GDP analogue guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) was without effects on the control Ca2+ channel current but abolished its hormonal inhibition. Four pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins were identified in membranes of PC-12 cells: two members of the Gi family, Gi1 and Gi2, and two members of the Go family, Go2 and another Go subtype (possibly Go1). The present data indicate that activated alpha 2-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors inhibit dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins without the involvement of a cAMP-dependent intermediate step.", 
    "8": "The present studies were undertaken to assess in vivo the effects of repeated administration of the norepinephrine (NE) reuptake blocker desipramine (DMI) (5 or 10 mg/kg/day x 14 days) on five subsets of adrenoceptors and on the effectiveness of the NE reuptake process in the rat central nervous system. These receptors were: 1) the postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors which signal the suppressant effect of microiontophoretically applied NE on the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons; 2) the postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptors which mediate the short-latency suppressant effect of endogenous NE, released by the electrical stimulation of the locus ceruleus (LC), on the firing activity of these same neurons; 3) the postsynaptic beta adrenoceptors which mediate the long-latency excitatory effect of LC stimulation on hippocampus pyramidal neurons; 4) the alpha-2 autoreceptors located on NE terminals in the hippocampus; and 5) the alpha-2 autoreceptors located on the cell body of LC NE neurons. The suppressant effect of microiontophoretic applications of NE on dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons was not changed by the long-term DMI treatments. The recovery time of the firing activity of these neurons after microiontophoretic application of NE, an index of the activity of the NE reuptake process, was the same in control and DMI-treated rats. However, the prolongation of this recovery time by the acute i.v. administration of DMI reached a plateau at a lower cumulative dose in long-term DMI-treated than in control rats. These results thus suggest that long-term administration of DMI did not affect the function of the NE transporter but reduced the number of DMI binding sites. The effectiveness of the 1 Hz stimulation of the LC in suppressing of the firing activity of pyramidal neurons was unchanged by either long-term DMI treatment (5 or 10 mg/kg/day), whereas that of the 5 Hz stimulation was enhanced only in rats on the 10-mg/kg regimen. This suggests that the function of terminal alpha-2 autoreceptors was decreased after this latter DMI regimen, because the reduction of the efficacy of the stimulation obtained by increasing the frequency from 1 to 5 Hz has been shown to be due to the activation of terminal alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptors. In keeping with this interpretation, the reduction of the effectiveness of the stimulation of the LC by the systemic administration of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist clonidine was attenuated in rats treated with the 10-mg/kg/day regimen of DMI, but not in those with the 5-mg/kg/day regimen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Synthetic peptides, 12-22 amino acid residues long, comprising the presumed coupling sites of the beta-adrenergic receptor with the stimulatory guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (Gs), were examined for their ability to modulate Gs activation in turkey erythrocyte membranes. Three peptides corresponding to the second cytoplasmic loop, the N-terminal region of the third cytoplasmic loop, and the N-terminal region of the putative fourth cytoplasmic loop, compete synergistically with the hormone-stimulated receptor for Gs activation with median effector concentrations of 15-35 microM, or 3-4 microM for combinations of two peptides. One peptide, corresponding to the C-terminal region of the third cytoplasmic loop, carries the unique ability to activate the Gs-adenylate-cyclase complex independent of the signalling state of the receptor. These observations are consistent with a dynamic model of receptor-mediated G-protein activation in membranes, where domains composed of the second, third and fourth intracellular loop of the receptor bind to and are interactive with the G-protein heterotrimer, resulting in ligand-induced conformational changes of the receptor. In response to hormone binding, the extent or the number of sites involved in interaction with Gs may be readjusted using a fourth site. Modulation of coupling sites may elicit congruent conformational changes within the Gs heterotrimer, with qualitatively different effects on GTP/GDP exchange in the alpha subunit of Gs and downstream effector regulation. This model corroborates and expands a similar model suggested for activated rhodopsin-transducin interaction [K\u00f6nig, B., Arendt, A., McDowell, J. H., Kahlert, M., Hargrave, P. A. & Hofmann, K.

It is shown that 5-HT1, 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors are distributed within the spinal cord according to a rostro-caudal gradient. Both 5-HT1 and 5-HT1A receptors are mainly present in the dorsal horn and 5-HT1B is present throughout the spinal cord, exhibiting high densities in the caudal-most part of the dorsal horn in lamina X and in the sacral parasympathetic area. On the other hand, 5-HT2 receptors are shown mostly in the thoracic sympathetic area and in the thoracic ventral horn; the dorsal horn exhibits few 5-HT2 receptors. The differential involvement of 5-HT through different receptors in nociception, autonomous nervous system control and motility are discussed.",

The percentage of patients without fatal bleeding was 90 +/- 2 percent in the treatment group and 82 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.01). The percentage of patients surviving after two years was 71 +/- 3 percent in the treatment group and 68 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.34). After age and severity of cirrhosis were taken into account, the survival rate was better in the treatment group (P = 0.09). The percentage of surviving patients who had had no bleeding after two years was 62 +/- 3 percent in the treatment group and 53 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.04). Both propranolol and nadolol prevented a first episode of bleeding. Severe cirrhosis and especially the presence of ascites were associated with bleeding (P less than 0.001) and death (P less than 0.001) in both groups. The efficacy of beta-adrenergic-antagonist therapy in the prevention of bleeding (P less than 0.001) and of fatal bleeding (P = 0.004) and in the prevention of bleeding or death (P = 0.005) was the same after adjustment for cause and severity of cirrhosis, ascites, and size of varices.",

    "15": "A series of mutant avian beta-adrenergic receptors with progressively truncated carboxyl termini have been expressed in insect and mammalian cells. Removal of 18-124 amino acid residues caused multiple phenotypic changes in the receptor. Membranes from cells that expressed the truncated receptors displayed elevated basal (2- to 3-fold) and agonist-stimulated adenylylcyclase activities. Adenylylcyclase activity in these membranes also displayed greater stimulation in response to partial agonists. Activity was also markedly stimulated by beta-adrenergic ligands that are usually considered to be antagonists (alprenolol, greater than 4-fold; propranolol, approximately 2-fold). Wild type receptor did not mediate a response to these classical antagonists. After purification and reconstitution with Gs, the truncated receptors did not appear to be more active than the wild type. Guanine nucleotides modulated the affinity of agonist for the truncated receptors, whereas the affinity of agonist for the wild type receptor was not altered by guanine nucleotides. The truncated receptors were solubilized from the membrane more efficiently and were more susceptible to amino-terminal proteolysis than was the wild type protein. These results suggest interaction of the carboxyl terminus of the avian beta-adrenergic receptor with cellular regulatory or structural elements.", 
    "16": "Almost 50 percent of patients with chronic heart failure die of sudden death often due to arrhythmia. In these patients the prognosis is related to the severity of myocardial lesions and also, probably, to the presence of ventricular arrhythmias. The potential severity of which can be assessed by various methods, including ECG, Holter monitoring, late potentials study and programmed ventricular stimulation tests. The first therapeutic measure to improve the prognosis of heart failure is to improve the myocardial function by prescribing converting enzyme inhibitors. The second measure consists of acting on potentially dangerous ventricular arrhythmias with few or no symptoms. Among antiarrhythmic agents, only beta-blockers and amiodarone seem to be valuable.", 
    "17": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of the concentric type is the classic cardiac adaptation to sustained arterial hypertension. Data from the Framingham cohort have shown that patients with LVH have a severalfold higher risk of sudden death, acute myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular morbidity than those with normal hearts. Common sequelae of LVH are ventricular ectopy, impaired ventricular contractility, myocardial ischemia, and decreased left ventricular filling. The benefits of antihypertensive therapy should not be limited to lowering arterial pressure, but should extend to preventing or reducing target organ damage. A variety of antihypertensive agents, such as calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antiadrenergic drugs, and, to a lesser extent, beta blockers, have been shown to reduce LVH and to improve left ventricular filling. We have shown that calcium channel blockers diminish ventricular ectopy in parallel with the reduction of LVH, whereas antihypertensive therapy with diuretics neither reduced LVH nor suppressed ventricular ectopy, although it lowered arterial pressure to a similar extent. Whether or not these cardiac changes with antihypertensive therapies will improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with LVH remains to be documented.", 
    "18": "Despite the demonstrated efficacy of traditional antihypertensive therapy in reducing blood pressure, hypertension continues to be a major cause of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Stepped-care therapy is a nonphysiologic approach that, due to potential metabolic derangements and stimulation of undesirable reflex responses, may not substantially reduce the cardiovascular and renal complications associated with hypertension or improve long-term survival in many hypertensive patients. Because of fundamental hemodynamic differences related to the age, race, and weight of hypertensive patients, drug treatment often elicits varying responses. Certain classes of drugs are not only more effective but also more appropriate from a physiologic standpoint in specific types of patients. Therapy selection based in part on hemodynamic mechanisms and demographic patterns is a more rational approach to patient management and may contribute to a better overall outcome than has been observed with conventional treatment.", 
    "19": "The present experiments were designed to clarify the cellular localization of postsynaptic beta-receptors in the rat cortex by studying the cellular source and pharmacological characteristics of in vivo cAMP responses to catecholamines. The method used to study in vivo cAMP responses in the brain involved microdialysis both to deliver catecholamines to cerebral tissue and to sample cAMP released in response to local beta-receptor activation. It was found that selective blockade of the metabolism of glial cells by fluorocitrate infusion produced a virtually complete (90%) inhibition of the cortical cAMP response to norepinephrine (NE). Selective damage of neurons by kainic acid infusion had little effect on the response. Pharmacological experiments showed that the response was selectively antagonized by a beta 1-receptor blocker which also selectively antagonized the cAMP response to NE in brain slices known to be localized in glial cells. These results support the hypothesis that beta-adrenoceptors of the rat cortex are predominantly localized on glial cells and therefore strongly suggest that these cells are an important target of the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system.", 
    "20": "beta-Adrenergic receptor stimulation of adenylyl cyclase involves the activation of a GTP-binding regulatory protein (G-protein, termed here Gs). Inactivation of this G-protein is associated with the hydrolysis of bound GTP by an intrinsic high affinity GTPase activity. In the present study, we have characterized the GTPase activity in a Gs-enriched rat parotid gland membrane fraction. Two GTPase activities were resolved; a high affinity GTPase activity displaying Michaelis-Menten kinetics with increasing concentrations of GTP, and a low affinity GTPase activity which increased linearly with GTP concentrations up to 10 mM. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 microM) increased the Vmax of the high affinity GTPase component approx. 50% from 90 to 140 pmol/mg protein per min, but did not change its Km value (approximately 450 nM). Isoproterenol also stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in parotid membranes both in the absence or presence of GTP. In the presence of a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), isoproterenol increased cAMP formation to the same extent as that observed with AlF-4. Cholera toxin treatment of parotid membranes led to the ADP-ribosylation of two proteins (approximately 45 and 51 kDa). Cholera toxin also specifically decreased the high affinity GTPase activity in membranes and increased cAMP formation induced by GTP in the absence or the presence of isoproterenol. These data demonstrate that the high affinity GTPase characterized here is the 'turn-off' step for the adenylyl cyclase activation seen following beta-adrenergic stimulation of rat parotid glands.", 
    "21": "Epinephrine, histamine and prostaglandin E1 stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in lung membranes and their stimulation of the enzyme activity was completely blocked by propranolol, metiamide and indomethacin, respectively. A partially-purified activator from the adult rat lung also enhanced adenylate cyclase activity in membranes. However, stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the rat lung activator was not abolished by the above receptor antagonists. Further, epinephrine, NaF and Gpp(NH)p stimulated adenylate cyclase activity rather readily, whereas stimulation of the enzyme activity by the lung activator was evident after an initial lag phase of 10 min. Also, the lung activator produced additive activation of adenylate cyclase with epinephrine, NaF and Gpp(NH)p. These results indicate that the lung activator potentiates adenylate cyclase activity in membranes by a mechanism independent from those known for epinephrine, NaF and Gpp(NH)p. Incubation of lung membranes for 30 min at 40 degrees C resulted in a loss of adenylate cyclase activation by NaF and Gpp(NH)p. Addition of the released proteins to the heat-treated membranes did not restore the enzyme response to these agonists. However, heat treatment of lung membranes in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol prevented the loss of adenylate cyclase response to NaF and Gpp(NH)p. N-ethylmaleimide abolished adenylate cyclase activation by epinephrine, NaF, Gpp(NH)p and the lung activator. These results indicate that the sulfhydryl groups are important for adenylate cyclase function in rat lung membranes.",

    "29": "Atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysms are found in about 4% of all men aged over 65 years. The most severe complication of the abdominal aortic aneurysm is rupture. The probability of rupture depends upon the diameter of the aneurysm. The chance of rupture is 30% within 2 years in aneurysms with a maximum diameter of more than 5 cm. Preoperative evaluation includes clinical examination and abdominal ultrasonography. Depending on the results, aortography and/or computed tomography are required. When the diameter is less than 5 cm in an asymptomatic patient, conservative management is indicated provided that clinical tests and ultrasonography are performed on a regular basis. The mean increase of diameter varies between 0.2 and 0.4 cm/year. All aneurysms with a diameter of more than 5 cm should be treated by implantation of a dacron graft. Symptomatic aneurysms should, independently of the diameter, be considered an emergency situation and resected immediately. Patients with ruptured aneurysms have a poor prognosis; only 40-60% of these patients reach the hospital and approximately 50% of them die despite immediate surgery. A special subgroup is the so called inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Characteristic findings of this entity are increased wall thickness and retroperitoneal fibrosis. The indications for resection are the same as for the atherosclerotic aneurysm. If management is conservative, treatment with corticosteroids is useful.", 
    "30": "We have found a medullary vasodepressor area in cat centered 3 mm rostral to the obex and just lateral to the compact division of the ambiguus nucleus. The area is compact, extending at most 1 mm in any direction. Microinjection of L-glutamate into this rostral depressor area (RDA) elicited acute hypotension and bradycardia. These responses were not reduced by either peripheral atropine blockade or bilateral vagotomy, but they were nearly abolished by peripheral phentolamine/propranolol blockade or high cervical cord transection. Bilateral reversible blockade of the RDA by local microinjection of the neuronal hyperpolarizing agent muscimol yielded chronic hypertension and tachycardia. Sympathetically mediated baroreflex, observed as a bradycardic response to a peripherally administered phenylephrine bolus in atropinized animals, was partially (50%) abolished during this same blockade. We conclude that the RDA contains sympathoinhibitory cells which are involved in the regulation of cardiovascular tone and in the expression of the sympathetic component of baroreflex.",

The receptor produced in insect cells is glycosylated but the extent and pattern differ from that of the receptor from human tissue. The heterologously expressed receptor was purified by alprenolol affinity chromatography, and was able to activate isolated Gs-protein.",

Plasma samples were treated with methanol to precipitate the proteins. Doxazosin was isolated with C18 reversed-phase extraction columns. The determination limit is 1 ng/ml of plasma, while the extraction columns can be reused frequently. The method is applied to clinical trial samples.", 
    "33": "Responses to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were studied in isolated umbilical vessels obtained from fetal lambs within 2 weeks of term (term = 145 days). Norepinephrine produced concentration-dependent contractions of the umbilical vein, but not in the umbilical artery. The contraction elicited by norepinephrine in the umbilical vein was not potentiated by cocaine (10(-5) M). Epinephrine also produced contractions of the umbilical vein with a potency similar to that of norepinephrine. Phenylephrine was less potent than norepinephrine while clonidine and xylazine were inactive in producing contractions of the umbilical vein. The dissociation constant (KA) of norepinephrine in the umbilical vein was 172 +/- 41 nM. There was little, if any, alpha-adrenoceptor reserve in the umbilical vein. Contraction produced to norepinephrine in the umbilical vein was effectively blocked by prazosin and phentolamine. Yohimbine was 500 times less potent than prazosin in blocking norepinephrine-induced contraction in the umbilical vein. Idazoxan only minimally antagonized the contractions elicited to norepinephrine. We conclude that alpha 1-adrenoceptors are present and mediate vasoconstriction in the ovine umbilical vein and that alpha 2-adrenoceptors are not present in this tissue.", 
    "34": "Cholera toxin (CTX) was used to test whether the presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors of guinea-pig mesenteric artery are coupled via stimulatory GTP-binding proteins. The vascular smooth muscle cells were electrically quiescent unless stimulated and had a mean resting potential of -68.7 +/- 2.8 mV (n = 16) and input resistance of 12.1 +/- 0.5 M omega (n = 4). Perivascular nerve stimulation with brief square pulses evoked excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) in the muscle cells. Isoproterenol (0.1 microM) enhanced the EJP amplitude without modifying the passive membrane properties of the muscle cells. The beta-blocker, propranolol (0.5 microM), prevented the effects of isoproterenol on EJP amplitude. The permeant analogue of cyclic AMP, 8-bromocAMP, also potentiated EJP amplitude. EJP amplitude was markedly enhanced by treatment of the isolated blood vessels with CTX (10 micrograms/ml for 1 h). The muscle cells became hyperpolarized (-74.6 +/- 2.1 mV, n = 5), and their input resistances were significantly reduced (8.2 +/- 0.5 M omega, n = 4). These effects of CTX persisted after washout. Addition of GM1 ganglioside (5 micrograms/ml) prevented the CTX effects. The CTX enhancement of EJP amplitude was not prevented by application of depolarizing current (ca. 0.5 nA) the muscle cells (to counter the hyperpolarization). These results suggest that CTX increases the neurotransmitter release from the nerve terminals; the hyperpolarization may be due to an increase in K+ conductance. These effects of CTX may be mainly due to elevation of cAMP in the nerve terminal and in the muscle cell.",

The tablets can be suspended in various liquid vehicles, but its stability under these conditions is unknown. The objective of our study was to determine the stability of labetalol HCl in five liquid vehicles, in both plastic and glass prescription bottles, over a four-week period at room temperature and under refrigeration. Labetalol HCl tablets (Trandate, Glaxo) were triturated, and suspended in distilled water, simple syrup, apple juice, grape juice, and orange juice to approximate concentrations of 7-10 mg/mL. After filtration, the liquids were stored in five amber, plastic prescription bottles, and five amber, glass prescription bottles at 4 degrees C and 23 degrees C. The samples were collected at 0, 24, and 72 hours, and 1, 2, and 4 weeks after initiation of the study. Labetalol HCl was measured by an HPLC method. Because there was no substantial change in labetalol HCl concentration during the study period, the tablet dosage from can be reformulated, stored, and administered to elderly or pediatric patients as a liquid dosage form.", 
    "36": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of pretreatment with propranolol on the cardio-respiratory toxicity of bupivacaine, either plain or with epinephrine 1:200,000 (5 micrograms.ml-1) added. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats, anaesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital, were divided into four groups. Groups I and III were pretreated with iv propranolol 150 micrograms.kg-1, and Groups II and IV received iv NS as a placebo. Three minutes later, rats in Groups I and II received plain 0.5% bupivacaine, 4 mg.kg-1, and Groups III and IV received 4 mg.kg-1 of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine, 5 micrograms.ml-1 iv. Five of eight rats pretreated with propranolol survived (Group I), compared with uniform fatality with NS pretreatment (Group II) (P less than 0.05). Addition of epinephrine to the bupivacaine eliminated the protective effect of propranolol. All rats pretreated with propranolol (Group III) or NS (Group IV) died when given bupivacaine with epinephrine. In conclusion, acute propranolol pretreatment reduced the fatal cardiotoxicity due to iv bupivacaine in male Sprague Dawley rats, but the addition of epinephrine 5 micrograms.ml-1 to bupivacaine eliminated the protective effect of propranolol.", 
    "37": "1. Studies have been made in the anaesthetized rat of the roles played by alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation in determining diameter changes induced in individual arterioles and venules of the spinotrapezius muscle during systemic hypoxia (breathing 6% O2 for 3 min). 2. Topical application to the spinotrapezius of phentolamine, the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist, or sotalol, the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, had no effect on the fall in systemic arterial pressure and tachycardia induced by hypoxia. 3. All arterioles and venules showed a decrease in diameter in response to topical application of noradrenaline (10(-6) g ml-1): these responses were abolished by topical application of phentolamine. Moreover, those arterioles and venules that showed a decrease in diameter during hypoxia before phentolamine, showed a significantly smaller decrease, or an increase in diameter after phentolamine. This effect was most marked in primary and secondary arterioles (13-50 microns diameter). 4. All arterioles and venules showed an increase in diameter in response to topical application of isoprenaline (10(-6) g ml-1); these responses were abolished by topical application of sotalol. Moreover, these arterioles and venules that showed an increase in diameter during hypoxia before sotalol, showed a significantly smaller increase or even a decrease in diameter after sotalol. 5. These results suggest that during hypoxia the arterioles of skeletal muscle, especially primary and secondary arterioles, are under the constrictor influence of a reflex increase in sympathetic nerve activity while the venules, which have no sympathetic innervation, are under the constrictor influence of circulating catecholamines. They also suggest that in individual arterioles and venules, these constrictor influences may be overcome by dilatation mediated by the beta-adrenoreceptor influence of circulating catecholamines. 6. Since some arterioles and venules still showed constriction during hypoxia after phentolamine and some still showed dilatation during hypoxia after sotalol, it seems that factors other than catecholamines contribute to the diameter changes. It is suggested that locally released metabolites exert a substantial dilator influence, particularly on terminal arterioles and collecting venules, those vessels nearest to the capillary bed.", 
    "38": "Intravenous treatment with 10 mg of hydralazine or 100 mg of labetalol was randomly allocated to 30 hypertensive pregnant women. Umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms were recorded using a pulsed Doppler duplex scanner (ATL Mk V) and umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI) and fetal heart rate (FHR) were derived from these recordings. Maternal blood pressure decreased significantly after both drugs. Maternal pulse rate increased after hydralazine but did not change significantly after labetalol. FHR did not change significantly after hydralazine but decreased after labetalol. PI decreased after hydralazine and increased after labetalol--most fetuses showed little change but a few in each group showed large changes in PI, as did two of five additional patients studied. We attributed the decrease in PI in some fetuses after hydralazine to vasodilation, and the increase in PI in some fetuses after labetalol to vasoconstriction in the fetoplacental circulation, suggesting that fetal beta-blockade may occur after maternal treatment with labetalol.", 
    "39": "In isolated liver from fed rats, simultaneously single-pass-perfused via both the hepatic artery (80 mmHg, 30-35% flow) and the portal vein (10 mmHg, 70-65% flow), adrenaline was infused either singly or jointly via the hepatic artery or the portal vein in the absence or presence of the alpha 1-blocker prazosin and the beta 2-blocker butoxamine. It was found that: (1) arterial adrenaline caused increases in glucose and lactate output which were slower in onset, smaller in peak height but longer in duration than did portal adrenaline; (2) arterial adrenaline elicited a much more pronounced decrease in flow and increase in pressure in the ipsilateral vessel than did portal adrenaline, and arterial, but not portal, adrenaline elicited qualitatively similar alterations also in the contralateral vessel; (3) arterial adrenaline caused metabolic changes mainly via alpha 1-receptors, with beta 2-receptors playing a permissive role via haemodynamic alterations, whereas portal adrenaline acted only via alpha 1-receptors; (4) arterial adrenaline decreased arterial flow via alpha 1-receptors counteracted via beta 2-receptors and operated on portal flow as portal adrenaline only via alpha 1-receptors; and (5) arterial adrenaline was extracted to a far greater extent than portal adrenaline. The results indicate that the hepatic artery and the portal vein can function as independent sites of hormonal signal input, which interact by complex, still undefined, mechanisms.", 
    "40": "In isolated rat liver single pass perfused via both the hepatic artery (80 mmHg, 30% flow) and the portal vein (10 mmHg, 70% flow), norepinephrine (NE) was infused either singly or jointly via the hepatic artery or the portal vein in the absence or presence of the alpha 1-blocker prazosin or the beta 2-blocker butoxamine. Arterial NE caused an increase in glucose output and a shift from lactate uptake to release that was slower in onset and smaller in peak height but longer in duration than the alterations affected by portal NE. The sum of the metabolic changes by arterial and portal NE was not equal to the changes by jointly applied arterial plus portal NE. The metabolic alterations by arterial NE were mediated via alpha 1-receptors, with beta 2-receptors probably having a permissive function, but those by portal NE were transmitted only via alpha 1-receptors. Arterial NE caused a strong decrease in arterial flow and contralaterally also a smaller reduction of portal flow. Portal NE decreased portal flow but did not significantly influence arterial flow. The sum of the alterations in flow by arterial and portal NE was not equal to the changes by jointly applied NE. The hemodynamic alterations in the artery by arterial NE were the results of actions via alpha 1-receptors and counteractions via beta 2-receptors, whereas the changes in the portal vein by arterial NE and portal NE were mediated via alpha 1-receptors. About 65% of arterial and only 30% of portal NE was extracted during a single path. The results indicate that the hepatic artery and the portal vein can function as independent sites of hormonal signal input, which interact by complex but still undefined mechanisms in the regulation of metabolism and hemodynamics.", 
    "41": "Case reports suggest that cocaine use is associated with acute myocardial infarction which may be due to coronary spasm. The present study reports the effect of cocaine on the isolated coronary artery. Ring segments were prepared from the porcine left anterior descending coronary artery and suspended in tissue baths under isometric conditions. Cocaine was ineffective by itself in promoting contraction, but a cumulative concentration-response curve was obtained in the presence of DL-propranolol (1.3 x 10(-6) M); D-propranolol failed to promote cocaine-induced vasoconstriction. The maximum contractile response to cocaine was one-third of the response to histamine and was in the same range as the response to U46619, prostaglandin F2 alpha and norepinephrine. Phenylephrine had a weak effect. In the presence of DL-propranolol, the vasoconstrictive effect of cocaine was subject to rapid tachyphylaxis. Prazosin (5 x 10(-9) M), also in the presence of DL-propranolol, significantly displaced the cocaine concentration-response curve to the right and diminished contractile force by one-half. We conclude that cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction elicited in the presence of DL-propranolol can be mediated through local adrenergic mechanisms involving beta receptor antagonism and activation of both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "42": "This study examined the role of hepatocyte calcium and cytoskeleton in activation of hyposmotic stress-induced increases in hepatocyte transmembrane potential and control of cell volume. Hepatocyte transmembrane potential was measured by glass microelectrodes in mouse liver slices before and after exposure to hyposmotic medium. Hepatocytes were loaded with tetramethylammonium by briefly exposing liver slices to nystatin, a cation poreforming antibiotic. Changes in hepatocyte steady-state water volume were determined by changes in intracellular tetramethylammonium activity measured with tetramethylammonium-sensitive, double-barrel micro-electrodes 4 min after exposure to hyposmotic medium. Hyposmotic stress of 74% of the control osmolality (approximately 280 mOsm) hyperpolarized hepatocyte transmembrane potential by 1.83 times the control hepatocyte transmembrane potential, and cell water volume increased by a factor of 1.19. The Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil (100 mumol/L) completely inhibited hyposmotic stress-induced hyperpolarization of hepatocyte transmembrane potential. This inhibitory effect diminished at doses of 37.5 or 50 mumol/L, but even these hyperpolarizations were decreased significantly compared with control. Hyposmotic stress during added verapamil dosage (50 mumol/L) also resulted in 23% greater cell swelling compared with control. Ca(2+)-free medium plus ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (5 mmol/L) inhibited hyposmotic stress-induced increases in hepatocyte transmembrane potential and resulted in 16% greater cell swelling compared with control. Calmodulin inhibitors trifluoperazine (100 mumol/L) and promethazine (100 mumol/L) inhibited the hyperpolarization of hepatocyte transmembrane potential caused by hyposmolality, as did 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate 8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl ester) (50 mumol/L), which inhibits mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Cytochalasin B (50 mumol/L), which disrupts microfilaments, also inhibited hyperpolarization of hepatocyte transmembrane potential with osmotic stress.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "This study was aimed at investigating the effects of propranolol on esophageal variceal pressure in patients with portal hypertension. Variceal pressure was measured at endoscopy using a miniature pressure-sensitive gauge in 20 patients with portal hypertension. Measurements were obtained under baseline conditions and 20 min after double-blind administration of propranolol (0.15 mg/kg; n = 10) or an identical amount of placebo (normal saline, 0.3 ml/kg; n = 10). Under baseline conditions, variceal pressure was similar in propranolol and placebo groups (14.1 +/- 5 mm Hg vs. 14.9 +/- 6.6 mm Hg, respectively; not significant). Placebo had no significant effect on variceal pressure (baseline = 14.9 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; placebo = 15.5 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; not significant), and values after placebo administration were closely correlated with baseline values (r = 0.98; y = 1.1 + 0.97 x; p less than 0.0001). In contrast, propranolol caused a significant decrease in the pressure of esophageal varices (from 14.1 +/- 5 mm Hg to 11.3 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.0002). No significant changes in the size of esophageal varices were observed after propranolol or placebo administration. This study shows (a) the endoscopic pressure-gauge technique has a low variability and may be used to assess acute drug-induced changes in variceal pressure; and (b) propranolol causes significant decreases in variceal pressure in patients with portal hypertension and esophageal varices.", 
    "44": "To assess the effectiveness of propranolol in the prevention of initial variceal hemorrhage, a double-blind, randomized trial was carried out in three centers. Patients with cirrhosis (78% alcoholic), hepatic venous pressure gradients greater than 12 mm Hg and endoscopically proven esophageal varices were randomly assigned to propranolol (51 patients) or placebo (51 patients). Of the 102 patients, 58% were Child's class A, 34% were Child's class B and 8% were Child's class C. Daily dosage was determined by the administration of progressively increasing doses of propranolol with the hepatic vein catheter in place to achieve a 25% decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient, a decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient to less than 12 mm Hg or a decrease in resting heart rate to less than 55 beats/min. During a mean follow-up period of 16.3 mo, 11 patients in the placebo group (22%) bled from esophageal varices compared with 2 in the propranolol group (4%) during a mean period of 17.1 mo (p less than 0.01). Three additional patients (6%) in the placebo group bled from portal hypertensive gastropathy compared with none in the propranolol group. Propranolol appeared effective in preventing bleeding from large varices. Eleven deaths (22%) occurred in the placebo group compared with eight deaths (16%) in the propranolol group (NS). The mean dose of propranolol was 132 mg/day, and the median dose was 80 mg/day. Using a compliance index (pill count, clinic attendance, alcohol and propranolol levels and alcohol history), 81% of the propranolol patients and 77% of the placebo patients were considered compliant. Complications severe enough to require cessation of therapy occurred in eight patients (16%) in the propranolol group and four in the placebo group (8%) (NS). We conclude that propranolol effectively prevents the first variceal hemorrhage in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and large esophageal varices but does not improve survival.", 
    "45": "The influence of isoproterenol, phenylephrine, propranolol, and reserpine on the salivary concentration of kallikrein-like proteases and cysteine-proteinase inhibitor (cystatin) was investigated. The protease activities in saliva from treated rats were studied by means of five different chromogenic substrates. In the isoproterenol- and phenylephrine-treated groups, a significant decrease in protease activity was found, compared with the control group. The protease activity of saliva was found to be elevated by about 25-50% after chronic administration of reserpine (0.5 mg/kg). Specific polyclonal antibodies to rat glandular kallikrein and cystatin were utilized to determine the salivary concentrations of these proteins. Results from the use of anti-kallikrein antibodies in Western blot analysis and crossed immuno-electrophoresis indicated that differences observed in the kallikrein-like protease levels of saliva from treated animals were due to altered immunoreactive protein levels. The salivary concentrations of kallikrein and cystatin were measured by direct radio-immunoassays with specific antibodies. The concentration of cystatin in the saliva of normal animals or animals treated with reserpine or propranolol was very low, but was increased about 100-fold in phenylephrine-treated animals and more than 5000-fold in isoproterenol-treated animals. Western blot analysis with antibodies to submandibular gland mucin, glutamine/glutamic-acid-rich protein (GRP), and proline-rich proteins (PRP) were also utilized to compare the effects of autonomic drugs on these salivary proteins. The salivary mucin showed an increase in reactivity and increased mobility in saliva from both isoproterenol- and phenylephrine-treated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "The pathogenesis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon remains an enigma. Most evidence favors a local abnormality in the digital arteries as opposed to an increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The local fault may involve the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, which are most important in reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction. Cooling blood vessels increase the sensitivity of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, increased levels of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are present in primary Raynaud's disease, and patients show an increased sensitivity to alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists on finger blood flow. Serotonin has also been implicated, but the evidence is not compelling. In secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, vasospastic attacks can often be explained by a low arterial distending pressure, a thickened vessel wall, or absence of beta-adrenergic receptor activity. Diagnosis of primary Raynaud's disease relies on a typical history and normal physical examination, laboratory studies, and nailfold capillaroscopy. Finger systolic blood pressures during local cooling with ischemia may be helpful to document vasospastic attacks but does not distinguish primary from secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. The treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon is usually conservative. Pavlovian conditioning or biofeedback may be beneficial. When drug therapy is necessary, the calcium channel entry blocker nifedipine or sympatholytic agents have been shown to decrease the frequency and duration of vasospastic attacks in about two thirds of patients, although subjective improvement does not usually correlate with objective testing. Direct-acting vasodilators have not been shown to be of definite benefit. New therapies include prostaglandins, captopril, and the serotonergic antagonist ketanserin. Surgical sympathectomy has not been beneficial.", 
    "47": "Ketamine is a cardiovascular stimulant through its sympathomimetic effects; however, its direct inotropic effect has been reported as positive in rat and negative in rabbit ventricular myocardium. This study reexamines the effect of ketamine on the contractile properties of mammalian ventricular myocardium. In isolated, electrically stimulated ferret right ventricular papillary muscles, the authors assessed the inotropic effect of ketamine (10(-6) M to 3 x 10(-4) M in 0.5 log M increments) alone and in various pharmacologic conditions designed to delineate ketamine's site(s) of action. Ketamine exerted a positive inotropic effect that was maximal at 10(-4) M. Bupranolol (10(-7) M) abolished this positive inotropic effect, whereas phentolamine (10(-6) M) did not. Depletion of norepinephrine stores by reserpine also eliminated ketamine's positive inotropic effect, indicating that ketamine caused indirect activation of the beta-adrenoceptor. Ketamine did not exert a positive inotropic effect in the presence of simultaneous inhibition of neuronal norepinephrine uptake with desmethylimipramine (DMI) (5 x 10(-6) M) and extraneuronal uptake with corticosterone (5 x 10(-5) M). It is likely that ketamine's action is to inhibit norepinephrine uptake at the neuroeffector junction rather than to augment norepinephrine release. In the presence of corticosterone, ketamine exerted a smaller positive inotropic effect than that seen with ketamine alone. Ketamine produced a small increase in force development in the presence of DMI, but this did not reach statistical significance. Inhibition of neuronal catecholamine uptake appears to be the predominant mechanism of ketamine's positive inotropic effect.",

    "54": "The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of a disrupted social environment on the endothelial integrity of various vascular segments in male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Each of 20 single-caged adult monkeys was fed a diet comparable to a person's ingestion of 240 mg cholesterol/day for a 10-week baseline period and then was introduced as a stranger into a four-member social group for 3 days. Half of the monkeys received a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (metoprolol) via subcutaneous implant 2 days before and during group housing. The social manipulation produced persistent sympathetic arousal as evidenced by significantly elevated heart rates among untreated monkeys (p less than 0.01) but not among their metoprolol-treated counterparts, whose heart rate declined (p less than 0.05). After the social manipulation, all monkeys were necropsied and evaluated for endothelial incorporation of immunoglobulin G (as an indicator of cell death), endothelial cell replication, the presence of adherent leukocytes, and arterial low density lipoprotein permeability and concentration. At branching sites in the thoracic aorta, immunoglobulin G incorporation and endothelial cell replication were significantly greater in untreated monkeys than in metoprolol-treated monkeys (p less than 0.01 for both analyses); no differences existed at nonbranch sites. Endothelial cell replication in the coronary arteries (where immunoglobulin G incorporation was not examined) was also greater among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups in arterial low density lipoprotein permeability or leukocyte adherence; estimates of arterial low density lipoprotein concentrations were higher among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys, but only in the abdominal portion of the aorta. These results indicate that social disruption is associated with both sympathetic nervous system arousal and indexes of endothelial dysfunction, effects that may be prevented by treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent.",

    "56": "The clinical characteristics of 65 patients with mixed angina were classified by means of (1) a questionnaire investigating the proportion of symptoms occurring at rest and on effort, (2) an exercise stress test, (3) 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring, and (4) coronary arteriography. According to the questionnaire, the proportion of effort-induced anginal episodes ranged from 1 to 99%. The ischemic threshold during exercise testing ranged from 110 x 10(2) to 350 x 10(2) mm Hg x beats/min. At least 1 episode of ST-segment depression was observed in 29 of the 65 patients during Holter monitoring. Ischemic episodes during Holter monitoring were more frequent (p less than 0.05) in patients reporting greater than or equal to 50% of anginal attacks on effort, with moderate to severe limitation of exercise capacity and with multivessel coronary artery disease. The effect on ambulatory ischemia of a 6-week treatment with a beta blocker (metoprolol CR, 200 mg once daily) or a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (nifedipine retard 20 mg twice daily) were then compared according to a double-blind, parallel group design. Metoprolol significantly reduced the number and duration of the ischemic episodes during daily life (p less than 0.05) irrespective of the patients' clinical characteristics. Nifedipine was ineffective, particularly in patients with angina predominantly on effort and with a moderate to severe reduction in exercise tolerance. It is concluded that in patients with mixed angina, ischemic episodes during daily life are more likely to occur in patients with a clinical presentation suggesting poor coronary reserve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "To evaluate the pharmacologic activity of 5-hydroxypropafenone, electrocardiographic changes (PQ and QRS duration) and blood pressure levels were measured in 6 healthy extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine after a single oral dose of 300 mg of this metabolite as a solution in a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Well-absorbed, with a lag time of 4.4 to 9.8 minutes, 5-hydroxypropafenone reached peak concentrations of 153 to 337 ng/ml after 20 to 51 minutes. The terminal half-life was 506 to 963 minutes. To describe the temporal aspects of the concentration-effect relation, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model with a hypothetical effect compartment was applied. The relation between electrocardiographic changes and drug concentration at the effect site could be described by a linear regression model. Significant prolongations of PQ and QRS duration were found in 5 of 6 subjects. There were no changes in QTc interval, blood pressure measurements and heart rate in the supine position. However, blood pressure measurements in the upright position revealed a greater percent decrease of systolic blood pressure than with placebo (mean +/- standard deviation -25.6 +/- 13.8% vs -3.4 +/- 13.1%, p less than 0.05). It is concluded that 5-hydroxypropafenone exerts significant pharmacologic activity in humans as well as animals. Because QRS prolongation in patients treated with class IC antiarrhythmic drugs correlates with the antiarrhythmic effect, our data suggest that 5-hydroxypropafenone may contribute to the therapeutic activity of propafenone in humans.", 
    "58": "To investigate whether changes in temperature influence the electrophysiologic effects of the class III antiarrhythmic agent d-sotalol, we studied its effects on propranolol-pretreated guinea pig papillary muscles at temperatures ranging from 37 degrees to 27 degrees C by means of conventional microelectrode techniques. We also examined the rate-dependent effect of d-sotalol at 37 degrees and 27 degrees C. Before the addition of d-sotalol, reducing the temperature from 37 degrees to 27 degrees C increased the action potential duration recorded at 50% repolarization (APD50) from 112 +/- 7 msec to 271 +/- 15 msec and action potential duration recorded at 90% repolarization (APD90) from 136 +/- 7 msec to 325 +/- 10 msec. d-Sotalol (50 mumol/L) lengthened APD50 and APD90 to a greater degree at low temperatures. Thus at 37 degrees C d-sotalol lengthened APD50 and APD90 by 12 +/- 6 msec and 19 +/- 5 msec, and at 27 degrees C by 37 +/- 5 msec and 52 +/- 7 msec, respectively. d-Sotalol produced its greatest effect on APD at long pacing cycle lengths, thus demonstrating reverse dependence. This rate-dependent effect was more marked at 27 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. The greater effect of d-sotalol on APD at long pacing cycle lengths may be explained by the modulated receptor hypothesis, assuming that the drug has a higher affinity for closed potassium channels. Such a mechanism may also explain the accentuated class III antiarrhythmic action of d-sotalol observed during hypothermia.", 
    "59": "The effects of the vasodilator drugs hydralazine, labetalol, prazosin, and nitrendipine were studied on responses to K+ (124 mmol/L), noradrenaline, vasopressin, and angiotensin II in small human maternal intramyometrial arteries and on responses to K+, prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha, and angiotensin II in fetal stem villous arteries. The vessels were dissected from biopsy specimens obtained during term cesareans and mounted in organ baths. Hydralazine failed to inhibit responses to any of the agonists tested in the fetal and maternal arteries. Labetalol and prazosin decreased responses to noradrenaline but did not affect contractions induced by the other agonists in maternal arteries. In fetal arteries, which did not respond to noradrenaline, no effects of labetalol and prazosin were found. Nitrendipine inhibited responses to all the agonists tested in maternal arteries. In fetal preparations, the drug decreased responses to K+ and PGF2 alpha but did not affect contractions induced by angiotensin II. Vasodilator drugs applied for treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension show differential effects on human maternal and fetal uteroplacental arteries, depending on their mode of action and the agonists responsible for the contractile activation in these vessels.", 
    "60": "In an attempt to increase patient compliance with a dosing regimen, prescriptions for topical solutions of glaucoma medication were refilled using the C Cap, a memory aid designed to help patients to remember to instill the medication as prescribed. A comparison of the number of prescription refills requested by 121 patients with glaucoma showed that patients who received the C Cap requested significantly more refills in the six months after receiving the C Cap than before and requested significantly more refills than did patients who did not receive the C Cap.", 
    "61": "Studies in humans have given strong support of an active transport of (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline [E)-10-OH-NT) in the kidney and from the cerebrospinal fluid. After 3 days of intraperitoneal injections of (E)-10-OH-NT (10 mg/kg t.i.d.) in a rat model, we investigated the effect of propranolol and quinidine (25 and 2.5 mg/kg injected 6 times during day 3) on the concentrations of (E)-10-OH-NT in urine, plasma (total and unbound) and brain. In a group of control rats the renal clearance of (E)-10-OH-NT varied 10-fold between rats, but was reproducible from Day 2 to Day 3 (r = 0.83; n = 8; p less than 0.05). Quinidine markedly decreased the renal clearance of both total and unbound (E)-10-OH-NT from plasma, while the effect of propranolol was less pronounced. There was no difference in the ratio of (E)-10-OH-NT concentrations in brain and plasma (unbound) between treated and control rats. We conclude that (E)-10-OH-NT is actively secreted in the rat proximal tubule and that the activity of this system varies between rats, but is constant in the individual rat. Quinidine, and to a less extent propranolol, inhibits this renal secretion. By the present methodology we could not demonstrate an active transport of (E)-10-OH-NT from brain to blood in the rat. Studies using other methods are needed to further elucidate this.", 
    "62": "We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of propranolol and sclerotherapy, compared to a control group, in the prevention of variceal rebleeding in alcoholic cirrhotic patients. Among the 79 patients included, the distribution of patients according to Child-Pugh classification was: A, 22%; B, 40%; and C, 38%. Propranolol was given twice daily with a mean final dose of 54 +/- 16 mg/day, this resulted in a mean reduction in resting heart rate of 26 +/- 7%. Sclerotherapy was performed weekly using 1% polidocanol. End points were rebleeding or death. During the mean follow up of 19 +/- 16 months, 43 patients bled and 22 patients died. The cumulative percentages of patients free of rebleeding at 1 year were: propranolol, 81% (95% confidence interval (CI): 63-92); sclerotherapy, 64% (95% CI: 45-82); control, 54% (95% CI: 36-71); these differences did not reach statistical significance. The cumulative percentages of patients alive at 1 year were: propranolol, 92% (95% CI: 76-98); sclerotherapy, 79% (95% CI: 58-91); control, 81% (95% CI: 60-93); these differences were not statistically significant. Alcohol withdrawal, which occurred in 66% of patients, was an independent predictive factor associated with a decreased risk of rebleeding or death. In conclusion, a life table analysis of patients free of rebleeding, as well as of patients surviving, revealed a tendency in favour of propranolol. The lack of a statistical support for these two favorable effects could be due to poor statistical power.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "The effect of norepinephrine (NE, 250 microgram/kg IP) on thermoregulatory behavior of rats in a cold environment was tested. Norepinephrine produced an increase in operant responding for heat reward but a decrease in core temperature. Since animals compensate behaviorally for alterations in autonomic thermoregulation, this suggested that NE might inhibit cold-induced thermogenesis, an effect contrary to the expected action of this agent. A second experiment showed that NE increased oxygen consumption when rats were tested at 25 degrees C as expected, but decreased oxygen consumption when tested at 5 degrees C. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol decreased oxygen consumption both at 25 and at 5 degrees C as expected. These results suggest that the thermogenic effect of NE is highly dependent on ambient temperature.", 
    "64": "Sauvagine (SV) powerfully inhibits gastric acid secretion by both the central and peripheral mechanisms. We examined whether adrenergic mechanisms or prostaglandin pathways might mediate the inhibitory action of SV on acid production in pylorus-ligated rats. Adrenalectomy altered the extent of the SV suppressive effect, suggesting that adrenal-derived substances participate in the action of the peptide. Blockade of adrenergic receptors by propranolol did not modify the antisecretory effect of SV, while the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, and the dopaminergic antagonist, haloperidol, potentiated the gastric response to the peptide. The action of SV appeared to be independent of prostaglandin pathways. We conclude that the antiacid effect of SV may be mediated by the adrenal but probably not by adrenergic or prostaglandin mechanisms.",

Normalization of the antioxidative protection of the stomach which prevents activation of the processes of free-radical oxidation in it plays an essential role in the mechanism of the stress-protective effect of adrenergic influences blockade on the gastric acid-producing function.", 
    "66": "A single dose of topical 2% metoprolol, a new beta adrenergic antagonist, induced a significant IOP reduction in 20 normal volunteers (40 eyes) and 20 patients (40 eyes) with primary open angle glaucoma. The IOP of the latter 40 eyes remained significantly below the pretreatment levels during 6 months of continued application of the drug b.i.d. No changes were noted in pupil size, blood pressure, or heart rate, indicating that metoprolol is an effective ocular hypotensive.", 
    "67": "This work comparatively studies the effects of dihydroergocristine, timolol and pilocarpine on intraocular pressure and pupil diameter in conscious rabbits. Intraocular pressure was measured by applanation tonometry and the pupil diameter by a photographic technique. In anesthetized rabbits, changes in tonographic facility of aqueous humor outflow and rate of aqueous humor formation were evaluated. Dihydroergocristine reduced the intraocular pressure more than timolol and much more than pilocarpine. The ocular hypotensive effect of dihydroergocristine was accomplished by a great reduction in aqueous humor formation, which surpasses the decrease in aqueous humor outflow, while timolol mainly reduced aqueous humor formation and pilocarpine increased aqueous humor outflow. Pupil diameter remained unchanged on dihydroergocristine, whereas timolol induced a slight mydriasis and pilocarpine provoked a clear myosis. Effects of dihydroergocristine might result in blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors in ciliary body, although available data about pretreatment with either metoclopramide or domperidone suggest that dopamine DA2-receptors might participate in ocular hypotensive effect of ergot derivatives.", 
    "68": "Twelve healthy volunteers took part in a randomised, double-blind, balanced, cross-over study to investigate the effect of misoprostol on the pharmacokinetics of propranolol. The subjects took propranolol 80 mg twice daily by mouth plus either misoprostol 400 micrograms twice daily or placebo by mouth for 14.5 days, followed by a 2-week washout period, followed by the alternate treatment for 14.5 days. Misoprostol had no significant effect on the t/2, Cmax or AUC of propranolol either after a single dose or at steady state.", 
    "69": "A HPLC assay is presented for the determination of oxprenolol (1) and its glucuronic acid conjugate (2) in human plasma and urine. The procedure employs a selective re-extraction using alprenolol (3) as the internal standard, followed by reversed-phase chromatography and UV-detection. The minimal detectable concentration is 10 ng/ml in plasma and 50 ng/ml in urine, using 1.0 and 0.5 ml of plasma and urine, respectively. Within-run and day-to-day variations are below 10% at all concentrations examined. Plasma and urine samples of either healthy volunteers or patients with renal failure are free of interferences from endogenous compounds and drugs frequently used in these patients. The glucuronic acid conjugate of oxprenolol is determined as the parent compound after hydrolytic cleavage with beta-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase. The specificity and selectivity of this cleavage are also demonstrated.", 
    "70": "Indices of global systolic performance of the newborn left ventricle exceed those of the adult, despite isolated tissue studies showing immature contractile mechanisms. To evaluate contractility in situ, we investigated the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) by the conductance technique in nine newborn lambs. After percutaneous placement of catheters, we generated ESPVR by inferior vena cava occlusion, aortic occlusion, and volume infusion in two control states, during three levels of dobutamine infusion, and after propranolol. We performed linear and nonlinear regression analyses of the end-systolic points and derived the slope (Ees) and volume at 14 kPa pressure. We found that reliable ESPVR could be obtained in almost all inferior vena cava and aortic occlusions (50 of 51 in each), but in only 18 of 27 volume infusions. Overall, linear regressions adequately defined the ESPVR (75 of 102 were not statistically different than nonlinear regressions; of those different, the mean linear R2 was 0.934 +/- 0.048). By multiple regression analysis, neither Ees nor volume at 14 kPa significantly changed with dobutamine, but both changed after propranolol (23% less than control and 54% greater, respectively), supporting previous studies showing a limited contractile reserve in the newborn secondary to high resting beta-adrenergic tone. Neither Ees nor volume at 14 kPa was different between control states. However, Ees was 25% less steep when generated by inferior vena cava than by aortic occlusion. We conclude that the ESPVR can be generated reliably and reproducibly in the newborn lamb and is relatively linear and sensitive to changes in contractility, but that it is also sensitive to the technique of load intervention.", 
    "71": "An adequate pupillary aperture is required for accurate ophthalmoscopy and retinoscopy in pediatric aphakia. When pupillary miosis does not respond to pharmacologic dilation, optical iridectomy performed with a vitreous suction-cutting instrument under general anesthesia may be required. We report a 27-month-old aphakic child whose pupillary aperture was enlarged from 1 mm to 3.5 mm with neodymium (Nd):YAG pupilloplasty, following intramuscular sedation with meperidine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine. Removal of the laser chin rest and positioning of the patient on a table with adjustable height facilitated delivery of 140 applications at 2.5 to 4.3 mJ to the pupillary border. Levobunolol 0.5% controlled the transient posttreatment rise in intraocular pressure. We suggest that Nd:YAG pupilloplasty performed with sedation be considered as an alternative to intraocular surgery when pupillary miosis in pediatric aphakia does not respond to dilating agents.", 
    "72": "In a prospective, randomized, double-masked study, primary open-angle glaucoma patients were treated twice daily with either betaxolol 0.5% or timolol 0.5%. Patients received a pretreatment baseline examination following a 2 week washout period; they were then examined after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Each examination included visual field measurements with an Octopus automated perimeter and intraocular pressure measurement. The visual fields of the betaxolol group showed on the average a pronounced tendency toward improvement (MD decrease of 2.05 dB); visual fields in the timolol group showed a slight tendency toward improvement (MD decrease of 1.56 dB). The difference between these 2 trends after 6 months was statistically not significant (p greater than or equal to 0.05, U-test). Both drugs lowered intraocular pressure, there was no significant difference between the two drugs (p greater than or equal to 0.05, U-test).", 
    "73": "The effects of N-n-propylajmaline (prajmalium) on the Na and Ca currents of single frog atrial and ventricular cells were studied by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Prajmalium (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) depressed the Na current (INa) in a dose- and use-dependent manner. In the same range of concentrations, prajmalium induced a dual effect on the high (ICaL) and low (ICaT) threshold Ca currents (the latter being only present in atrial cells). At a low concentration (10(-9) M), prajmalium increased both Ca currents while at high concentrations (10(-6) M) it depressed them. Prajmalium appeared very potent on ICaT although this current is generally reported to be barely sensitive to agonists and drugs. The action of the drug was also accompanied by a shortening in the half-time of inactivation of the Ca currents and a slight hyperpolarizing shift of their availability curves. The increase in ICaL by prajmalium was not prevented by prazosin (10(-7) M) nor by propranolol (10(-6) M), and it was also observed after ICaL had been fully stimulated by isoproterenol (10(-7)M). Nifedipine (10(-6) M), however, was able to prevent or block the prajmalium-induced increase in ICaL. Some similarities between the actions of prajmalium and dihydropyridine agonists on Ca currents are discussed.", 
    "74": "Oral yohimbine administration (0.2 mg/kg) induced lipid mobilization (increase in plasma non-esterified fatty acids, NEFA) in fasting non-obese women (body mass index BMI = 20.2 +/- 0.5, age 35.5 +/- 2.7 years) without significant action on plasma glucose, insulin levels, heart rate or blood pressure during the time-course of the experiment (240 min). Plasma norpinephrine (but not epinephrine) concentrations were increased (100 percent) after oral yohimbine administration. Oral administration of propranolol (40 mg, 60 min before yohimbine) reduced the lipid-mobilizing action of yohimbine (70 percent) during the 60 min following its administration and then totally suppressed its effect until the end of the experimental period (180 min). In fasting obese women (BMI = 36.4 +/- 2.1, age 37 +/- 3.6 years), yohimbine provoked an increase in plasma NEFA levels which was not markedly different from that observed in non-obese subjects. It had no significant effect on plasma glucose, insulin levels, heart rate or blood pressure. Plasma norepinephrine increased in the same proportions. The lipid-mobilizing effect of yohimbine in women is mainly attributable to the increase in synaptic norepinephrine with a resultant increment in lipolysis by beta-adrenergic agonism. In the standard fasting conditions (12 hours) the blockade of the antilipolytic fat cell alpha 2-adrenoceptors seems to be a minor component of the lipomobilizing effect of yohimbine. Morever, when compared with non-obese women, the lipomobilizing effect of yohimbine is not enhanced in obese women.", 
    "75": "Injection of diltiazem (40 mg/kg/d) to gentamicin (75 mg/kg/d = G 75 or 100 mg/kg/d = G 100) treated rats enhances aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity. As a result of this combination, acute renal failure becomes systematic and is often irreversible. The lesion is of tubular origin and is characterized by a large increase in the urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (u-NAG) activity and its NAG-B isoenzyme level. The phenomenon is twice as marked with G 75 (u-NAG x 6.8, NAG-B x 2.2) as with G 100 (u-NAG x 3.1, NAG-B x 1.1). The effect seems to be attenuated if diltiazem is administered as a preventive treatment or in drinking water. As well as its diuretic properties, diltiazem may aggravate the renal toxicity of gentamicin by reducing the proximal tubular availability of calcium. Diltiazem inhibits reabsorption and behaves like a non-competitive inhibitor of calcium. This deficiency favours the proximal tubular binding and the non-specific penetration of gentamicin in the cytosol and cellular organelles (microsomes, mitochondria). The tubular toxic symptoms which ensure (inactivation of membranaceous enzyme, reduction of microsomal protein synthesis and ATP level, decreased of solute reabsorptive flux) lead in turn to proximal tubular necrosis and acute renal failure.", 
    "76": "To determine whether distension of the urinary bladder reflexly affects coronary blood flow, experiments were performed in eleven dogs anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone. Both ureters were cannulated and the urinary bladder was distended with warm Ringer solution at a steady intravesical pressure. Arterial blood pressure was prevented from changing by a pressurized reservoir of warm Ringer solution connected to the femoral arteries. Coronary blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter positioned around the origin of the left circumflex coronary artery. When the reflex increase in heart rate was prevented by atrial pacing in seven dogs, distension of the urinary bladder always caused a decrease in mean coronary blood flow. Similar results were obtained in all eleven dogs after administration of propranolol. The decrease in mean coronary blood flow was significantly reduced by atropine or bilateral cervical vagotomy, and was abolished by bretylium tosylate. The results showed that distension of the urinary bladder reflexly decreased mean coronary blood flow, a response involving efferent cardiac vagal and sympathetic pathways.", 
    "77": "Effects of cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) at 10 Hz and intravenous infusion of neuropeptide Y (NPY), 10 and 100 pmol x kg body wt-1 x min-1 for 5 min, on regional blood flow in the cat were investigated with radioactive microspheres. Sympathetic nerve stimulation caused significant reductions in blood flows in the facial tissues including the eye. Alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine and combined beta- and alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol and phenoxybenzamine abolished the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation in most facial tissues except in the tongue, upper eyelid and masseter muscle. In most cranial tissues, neuropeptide Y reduced regional blood flow and increased vascular resistance. No effect of neuropeptide Y on vascular resistance was observed in the choroid. In the present study, evidence for a non-adrenergic component in sympathetic vasoconstriction was found in the tongue, upper eyelid and masseter muscle but not in the majority of feline facial tissues. Neuropeptide Y was a potent vasoconstrictor in many cranial tissues, while in parts of the uvea, the effects of neuropeptide Y were less pronounced.", 
    "78": "Eleven patients with prospectively documented premenstrual depression were given 100 mg atenolol or placebo daily to suppress melatonin secretion during the symptomatic premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle. There was no significant improvement in mood following treatment with atenolol vs. placebo. These findings suggest that bright light may exert antidepressant effects in patients with premenstrual syndrome through mechanisms other than melatonin suppression and that atenolol does not appear to be a viable treatment modality for the majority of patients with premenstrual depression.", 
    "79": "To determine if verapamil alters baroreflex function differently depending on age, reflex heart rate responses to intravenous infusions of phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside were compared in conscious 5- and 14-month-old rats before and after daily oral administration of verapamil (100 mg/kg) for 6 days. The effects of verapamil on parasympathetic and sympathetic mediation of heart rate were also assessed by repeating baroreflex tests after treatment with either propranolol or atropine. All reflex heart rate responses were initially smaller in 14- than in 5-month-old rats. Regardless of age, magnitude of reflex bradycardia or the effects on it of either cholinergic or beta-adrenergic blockade, were unaffected by verapamil. By contrast, reflex tachycardia which was attenuated in both age groups, was decreased further by subsequent cholinergic or beta-adrenergic blockade in 5-month-old rats, but only by cholinergic blockade in 14-month-old rats. These findings suggest that while verapamil did not affect autonomic mediation of reflex bradycardia, it reduced that of reflex tachycardia differently depending on age. Whereas it attenuated both sympathetic and parasympathetic mediation of reflex tachycardia in 5-month-old rats, it attenuated only sympathetic mediation in 14-month-old rats.", 
    "80": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism have been studied during general anaesthesia with enflurane and hypotension induced with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in combination with metoprolol in nine ASA Grade I patients undergoing surgery for deviation of the nasal septum. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced by 31% to a mean of 47 mmHg using metoprolol 0.15 mg kg-1 and SNP 0.46 mg kg-1. There was no reduction in CBF during the hypotensive period. Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) was also unchanged during hypotension. We conclude that in healthy individuals anaesthetized with enflurane, SNP in combination with metoprolol reduces MAP to the desired level without changing CBF or CMRO2.", 
    "81": "Twenty nine patients with chronic renal failure associated with severe essential hypertension, 10 of whom being on programmed hemodialysis, were treated with captopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 21) and sectral-400, a cardioselective beta-blocker (n = 11). Blood pressure (BP) changes and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system parameters were studied by radioimmunoassay. When given in a daily dose of 25 to 100 mg for a long time, captopril provided a good and satisfactory antihypertensive effect in 9 patients; a weak or no effect was achieved in 9 and 5 patients, respectively. BP lowered by an average of 14.7%. There were 72% and 17.9% increases in active and total renin levels, respectively, and a reduction in the proportion of inactive in total renin. With sectral-400, 400-1200 mg/day, good, weak or no effects were observed in 6, 3, and 2 patients, respectively. BP decreased by an average of 13%, there were 59% and 12% reductions in active and total renin levels, respectively, whereas the content of inactive renin showed a 21% increase, suggesting a diminution of renin synthesis and activation. The initially higher plasma aldosterone levels in most patients (by an average of 4.2 times) decreased significantly by 23% with the two drugs. Thus, in severe essential hypertension it is advisable to use blockers of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with chronic renal failure, captopril is particularly indicated in those who have a high renin activity, and the hyperkinetic syndrome is an additional indicator for sectral-400 use.", 
    "82": "Stereoselectivity in pharmacokinetics may be characterized by a measurable difference between enantiomers in a pharmacokinetic parameter. We propose that pharmacokinetic parameters may be classified according to three levels of organization in the body and that the hybrid character of parameters increases with the level of organization that they represent. At the molecular level are intrinsic metabolite formation clearances and fraction of drug unbound in plasma, reflecting the selectivity of an endogenous macromolecule for the enantiomers of a chiral drug molecule. At the organ level, pharmacokinetic parameters represent the combined effects of stereoselectivity in each of their component parameters within an organ. As a result, these parameters are of intermediate hybrid character. Parameters with the highest degree of hybrid character describe the pharmacokinetic behavior of a drug in the whole body. The stereoselectivity associated with each of the component parameters could either amplify or dampen the resultant stereoselectivity in hybrid parameters. The hypothesis that kinetic differences between enantiomers are inversely correlated with the degree of hybrid character was examined for four drugs: warfarin, verapamil, mephenytoin, and propranolol. By classifying pharmacokinetic parameters according to both the level of organization that they characterize and their hybrid nature, it becomes possible to account for stereoselectivity in drug distribution and elimination.", 
    "83": "Our recent study has revealed that catecholamines depress the endolymphatic sac direct current potential (ESP) by the beta-adrenergic action [Mori et al., Am. J. Physiol. 259 (regulatory Integrative Comp. Physiol. 28): R921-R924, 1990]. Beta-Adrenergic receptors have been subclassified into beta 1- and beta 2-receptors. Using beta 1-selective (dobutamine) and beta 2-selective (salbutamol) agonists and a beta 1-selective antagonist (atenolol), we determined the subtype of beta-adrenergic receptors that mediate the action of catecholamines on the ESP. Salbutamol depressed the ESP to a larger degree than dobutamine [34.0 +/- 2.6 (n = 7) vs. 13.0 +/- 2.0% (n = 8)] with a much lower dose (100 vs. 1,000 micrograms/kg). Atenolol failed to block the action of salbutamol on the ESP at a dose of 1 mg/kg, whereas propranolol inhibited it at the same dose. The results indicate that beta 2-receptors mediate the action of catecholamines on the ESP.", 
    "84": "Chronic continuous infusion of norepinephrine in rats causes alterations in biochemical and physiologic responses of the cardiovascular system and in cardiovascular adrenoceptor number. The response of cardiac and aortic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity to stimulation by norepinephrine was decreased in rats receiving norepinephrine infusion. These responses are due to stimulation of beta- and alpha-adrenergic receptors, respectively. Additionally, there was reduced stimulation of aortic ODC activity by angiotensin II and vasopressin. The cardiac ODC response to angiotensin II was decreased, but the response to vasopressin was not affected. The decreased ODC response is accompanied by decreased pressor responses to the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine. Decreased numbers of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor binding sites (as measured by the binding of [3H]prazosin and [125I]pindolol) might mediate, in part, the altered responses to adrenergic agonists. The decreased cardiovascular responsiveness measured in these animals after several days of norepinephrine infusion hypertension contrasts with the increased responses found in most other forms of hypertension. This provides a useful model in which to examine the consequences of prolonged adrenergic receptor stimulation.", 
    "85": "This study was undertaken to elucidate whether alpha-1 adrenoceptor activity is beneficial to contractile dysfunction during reperfusion after a brief period of ischemia (stunned myocardium) in 54 open-chest dogs. Contractile dysfunction assessed by fractional shortening (FS) was observed 3 hours after the onset of reperfusion following 15 minutes of complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Pretreatment with prazosin (4 micrograms/kg/min i.c.) further deteriorated contractile dysfunction compared with the untreated condition (12.7 +/- 0.6% versus 6.9 +/- 0.4% with prazosin treatment, p less than 0.001). Conversely, alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists, methoxamine (1.0 microgram/kg/min i.c.) and norepinephrine (0.24 microgram/kg/min i.c.) with rauwolscine and propranolol, significantly attenuated contractile dysfunction (FS in the methoxamine-treated group, 17.3 +/- 0.3%, p less than 0.001 versus the untreated group; FS in the norepinephrine-treated group, 18.0 +/- 0.9%, p less than 0.05 versus 13.6 +/- 1.1% in the propranolol group). Both adenosine release and hyperemic coronary flow response during the early reperfusion period were significantly attenuated in the prazosin-treated group, and both were enhanced in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation groups. These results suggest that beneficial effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity may be due to the enhanced release of adenosine. To test the cause-effect relation between the extent of adenosine release and contractile dysfunction during reperfusion, 8-phenyltheophylline was infused to block adenosine receptors in the methoxamine-treated group. The treatment with 8-phenyltheophylline completely abolished (FS, 7.4 +/- 0.3%) the beneficial effect of the enhanced adenosine release by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. Furthermore, in the prazosin-treated group, adenosine (9 micrograms/kg/min) was additionally infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery 5 minutes before and 2 hours after the onset of reperfusion. Both hyperemic coronary flow and contractile dysfunction (FS, 17.3 +/- 0.3%) recovered to the levels of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation groups. However, treatment with papaverine could not prevent deleterious effects of prazosin despite the fact that comparable hyperemic flow was obtained. Instead, lactate production up to 10 minutes after the onset of reperfusion was significantly larger (p less than 0.01) despite augmented contractile function in the prazosin-treated and the 8-phenyltheophylline with methoxamine-treated groups compared with the untreated group. The electron microscopic examination revealed no irreversible myocardial injury with and without pharmacological interventions. Thus, we conclude that alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity can reduce the magnitude of myocardial stunning and that its cellular mechanism is due to enhanced adenosine release by alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "86": "Species-dependent variations of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic effects of epinephrine were assessed in relation to characteristics of alpha 1-receptor bindings and acceleration of phosphatidylinositol metabolism in the isolated rat, rabbit, and dog ventricular myocardium. Epinephrine in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bupranolol (10(-6) M) elicited a positive inotropic effect through activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in rat and rabbit, whereas in dog ventricular myocardium, bupranolol abolished the positive inotropic effect of epinephrine. [3H]Prazosin bound to membrane fractions derived from rat, rabbit, and dog ventricular muscle with high affinities in a saturable and reversible manner. In dog, Bmax and Kd values of alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites were identical to those in rabbit ventricular muscle. The Bmax value of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in rat ventricle was the highest, amounting to two to four times those in rabbit and dog. Epinephrine displacement curves for the specific binding of [3H]prazosin in the membrane fraction of these species showed high and low affinity sites with slope factors significantly less than unity, which were shifted to single low affinity sites with slope factors close to unity by addition of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate. Accumulation of [3H]inositol 1-phosphate [( 3H]IP1) in ventricular slices prelabeled with [3H]myo-inositol was increased by epinephrine in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in rat ventricular slices. [3H]IP1 accumulation likewise was facilitated by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation in rabbit ventricular slices, whereas the extent of [3H]IP1 accumulation was much less than that in rat. In dog ventricular slices, [3H]IP1 was not accumulated by epinephrine. In rabbit papillary muscle, the time course of increase in contractile force induced by alpha-adrenoceptors coincided with the prolongation of the action potential duration with a similar time course, which is in strong contrast to previous findings in rat that the contractile response was dissociated from the electrophysiological response to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. The present results indicate that a wide range of variation of alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated regulation of myocardial contractility may be ascribed to different contributions of facilitatory as well as inhibitory regulatory processes that lead to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization subsequent to myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation among mammalian species.", 
    "87": "The effects of repeated treatment of rats with desipramine on 5-HT mechanisms within the nucleus accumbens (NAS) have been studied in a functional model. Local microinjections of 5-HT, quipazine as well as 5-HT1A receptor agonist buspirone, 8-OH-DPAT and NDO-008, inhibited rat locomotor activity in the open-field test. The effect of 5-HT and buspirone was blocked by serotonergic receptor antagonists methysergide and cyanopindolol, respectively. Chronic, but not acute treatment of rats with desipramine (10 mg/kg, PO, twice a day for 21 days, tests were performed 24 h after the last dose) significantly attenuated behavioral depression after 5-HT and quipazine microinjections, while the effect of buspirone was left unchanged. On the basis of present data, it may be concluded that whereas both accumbens 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors appear to be important to regulation of animals' motility, only 5-HT2 receptors seem to be the most likely targets of antidepressive treatment. These data, along with previously reported changes in limbic noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity after antidepressive treatment, may explain the energizing influence of drugs and electroconvulsive shocks on psychomotor retardation, a part of endogenous depression.", 
    "88": "We used meta-analytic statistical techniques to synthesize findings from studies that evaluated propranolol HCI for the prevention of recurrent migraine (2,403 treated patients). The modal migraine sufferer treated in these studies was a female, about 37 years of age, who suffered from common (rather than classical) migraines and reported a 17-year history of problem migraines. The modal treatment was 160 mg. propranolol per day. Meta-analysis revealed that, on average, propranolol yielded a 44% reduction in migraine activity when daily headache recordings were used to assess treatment outcome, and a 65% reduction in migraine activity when less conservative measures (e.g., clinical ratings of improvement, global patient reports) were used. Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial support for short-term effectiveness of propranolol. However, little information was available concerning the long-term effectiveness of propranolol.", 
    "89": "Arterial pressure, cardiac mass and coronary flow reserves were measured in untreated and chronically pindolol-treated rabbits, prepared as either one-kidney one clip (1K1C) hypertensive or uninephrectomized (sham) controls. Pindolol (200 micrograms/kg/day) was administered for either 23 or 30 days, beginning 1 week after, or the day of initial surgery, respectively. Coronary flow was measured, at day 30, using radioactive microspheres, during base-line and adenosine infusion (0.4 mg/kg/min) in anesthetized open-chest preparations. Heart weight of untreated 1K1C animals (9.13 +/- 0.73 g) was significantly greater than the controls (7.19 +/- 0.77 g). Myocardial mass of 1K1C (9.93 +/- 0.86 g) and sham controls (7.40 +/- 0.31 g) were unaffected by chronic pindolol for 23 days. Cardiac hypertrophy was prevented in 1K1C animals treated with pindolol for 30 days (7.53 +/- 1.28 g). Untreated 1K1C animals were hypertensive compared to sham controls (116 +/- 12 and 78 +/- 7 mm Hg) and neither pindolol regime affected blood pressure. Bradycardia was evident in all pindolol-treated animals. Base-line coronary flow was higher in the untreated 1K1C animals compared to untreated controls (228 +/- 43 vs. 182 +/- 31 ml/min/100 g). After chronic pindolol treatments, 1K1C base-line blood flows were reduced (158 +/- 48 and 175 +/- 59 ml/min/100 g, for 23- and 30-day protocols). Adenosine vasodilated flows were not different between the untreated 1K1C and sham animals and were not affected by pindolol treatment. Therefore, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy were dissociable in this model when pindolol was administered from the onset of hypertension. This suggests immediate involvement of beta adrenergic activation in the development of hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "90": "In a previous paper we suggested that the vascular cold patch may be a useful prognostic index to followup migraine patients. Considerable criticism against our contention has been raised by Swerdlow and Dieter (Headache 29:562-568, 1989, ref. 1), who claim that the cold patch constitutes a \"fixed geography\" of the vasculature of migraine patients. In the present paper we replicate and extend our previous findings reporting the results of facial thermography in a sample of 246 consecutive migraine patients. Of these the 206 exhibiting a typical cold patch or a significant asymmetry in the forehead thermal dissipation were admitted to prophylactic treatment (beta blocker or calcium channel blocker). The thermography was performed at entry in the study and after six months of active treatment. The clinical outcome was compared to the thermographic findings. The patients were subdivided in three classes on the basis of the clinical outcome. Among the 136 patients who experienced complete or substantial relief from headache the cold patch disappeared or markedly improved in 85% of the cases. In the 46 patients with partial relief the thermogram showed an improved pattern in 48% of cases, most of the time of smaller extent than in the previous class. In 24 patients we observed no clinical improvement. Among these the thermogram remained unchanged in 85% of cases. Taken together these findings corroborate our previous suggestion that thermography is useful to monitor the clinical course of the disease. One additional suggestion from the present data is that thermography closely parallels the clinical course so as to represent a useful criterion for the decision of discontinuing the therapy.", 
    "91": "With the horseradish peroxidase histochemical technique and electron microscope, the effects of 0.5% timolol, Inj. Salviae Miltiorrhizae Co. and their combination on the retrograde axoplasmic transport in the optic nerve of 230 rabbit models of chronic IOP elevation were studied. The results showed that (1) the nerve damage in chronic glaucoma was due to multiple factors; (2) the use of a drug that improved microcirculation in combination with an IOP depressor better protected the optic nerve functions than did the latter alone; and (3) Inj. Salviae Miltiorrhizae Co. improved the optic nerve axoplasmic transport under chronic IOP elevation. The mechanism of the drug in protecting the optic nerve could be through its actions of improving the local microcirculation and the tolerance of nerve tissues to anoxia.", 
    "92": "The efficacy of a controlled-release topical dosage form of glyceryl trinitrate (Nitroglycerin Transdermal Therapeutic System, Nitroderm TTS, NTG-TTS; CAS 55-63-0) was studied in the experimental model of congestive heart failure in beagles. NTG-TTS suppressed the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic and central venous pressure, and total peripheral resistance resulting from propranolol, dextran and l-phenylephrine infusion. NTG-TTS antagonized the decrease in cardiac output in this model. These effects of NTG-TTS on congestive heart failure were presumably attributable to the reduction of pre-load, together with direct vasodilation of the peripheral arteries.", 
    "93": "Chloroquine liberated a relatively low amount of histamine from isolated rat mast cells. In a dose-dependent way, this drug inhibited histamine liberation from mast cells stimulated with compound 48/80, A23187, concanavalin A plus phosphatidylserine (Con A + PS) and abolished histamine liberation induced by exaprolol. The degranulation was decreased in cells stimulated with 48/80, Con A + PS and exaprolol. Chloroquine significantly inhibited the formation of thromboxane B2 in mast cells stimulated with 48/80, Con A + PS and A23187. We assume that chloroquine interferes with mast cells at a plasmic membrane site as well as intracellularly.", 
    "94": "1. Contractile responses and acetylcholine release evoked by nicotine in guinea-pig detrusor strips were determined by isotonic transducer and radioimmunoassay, respectively. Nicotine stimulated acetylcholine release and a contractile response in guinea-pig detrusor strips treated with the cholinesterase inhibitor, methanesulphonyl fluoride (MSF). Both actions evoked by nicotine were antagonized by the nicotinic receptor antagonist, hexamethonium but were insensitive to tetrodotoxin. 2. A sympathetic nerve blocker, guanethidine and a tachykinin antagonist, [D-Arg1, D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9, Leu11]-substance P (rpwwL-SP) partially inhibited the acetylcholine release evoked by nicotine to much the same degree. The inhibitory effects of guanethidine and rpwwL-SP on acetylcholine release were significantly greater than corresponding effects on the contraction evoked by nicotine. 3. In preparations treated with rpwwL-SP to block the tachykinin receptors, guanethidine had no effect on the response to nicotine. Conversely, after treatment with guanethidine to block release of a mediator from sympathetic nerve endings, nicotine-induced responses were not affected by rpwwL-SP. 4. Nicotine-induced contraction was reduced to 30% by the muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonist, atropine and completely abolished after desensitization of P2-purinoceptors with alpha,beta-methylene ATP in the presence of atropine. 5. A concentration-contractile response curve to neurokinin A (NKA) was shifted to the left after cholinesterase inhibition with MSF. Atropine abolished the facilitatory effect of MSF and partially inhibited contractions induced by NKA at 100 nM to 1 microM. The contractile responses to substance P methyl ester (SPOMe) and Tyr0-neurokinin B (Tyr0-NKB) were not influenced by MSF or atropine. 6. After desensitization of NK, tachykinin receptors with SPOMe or preincubation with senktide, the cholinergic component of the nicotine-induced contraction was the same as the control value (100%). 7. Our findings give further support to our previous results: nicotine stimulates acetylcholine release in a tetrodotoxin-resistant manner in guinea-pig bladder and acetylcholine release evoked by nicotine is increased by the coordinated action of sympathetic nerves and tachykinin(s). It is suggested that the tachykinin receptor subtype involved in acetylcholine release is NK,.", 
    "95": "The myocardial adaptation to chronic beta-adrenergic blockade was explored in diabetic and control female Wistar rats. Propranolol was administered by intraperitoneal injection, 30 mg/kg every 12 h. Treatment began 2 months after streptozotocin injection and at a comparable time in controls. Diabetes reduced the heart rate by 90 beats/min; propranolol decreased the heart rate by 30 beats/min further in diabetic rats. Propranolol reduced the heart rate by 100 beats/min in controls. Study of isolated ventricular papillary muscle showed qualitatively similar effects of propranolol in control and diabetic animals. Diabetes resulted in prolonged contraction duration and decreased shortening velocity; both developed tension and peak shortening were unchanged. In contrast, propranolol resulted in prolonged contraction duration but no change in shortening velocity; both developed tension and peak shortening were increased. The shortening of isometric relaxation in response to norepinephrine was exaggerated with propranolol therapy in control but not diabetic rats. These findings indicate that the myocardial adaptation to chronic beta-blockade results in increased developed tension and increased extent of muscle shortening in vitro, and differs qualitatively from the adaptation to diabetes.", 
    "96": "We examined the possible involvement of endogenous angiotensin II (ANG II) in norepinephrine (NE) overflow and antidiuresis induced by renal nerve stimulation (RNS). RNS at a frequency of 0.5-2.0 Hz, which did not influence renal hemodynamics, produced significant reductions in urine flow and urinary excretion of sodium, and elevations in NE secretion rate (NESR) and renin secretion rate (RSR). Intrarenal arterial (i.r.a.) infusion of phentolamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) abolished the RNS-induced antidiuresis. In dogs receiving captopril (15 micrograms/kg/min i.v.), RNS-induced antidiuresis and increase in NESR were significantly attenuated. The i.r.a. administration of propranolol at 5 micrograms/kg/min, a dose that inhibited completely the RNS-induced increase in RSR, did not influence the alterations in NESR and urine formation in response to RNS. During ANG II infusion (1 ng/kg/min i.r.a.), RNS produced a reduction in urine formation and an increase in NESR, at a magnitude similar to that seen without ANG II infusion. These results suggest that RNS at a low frequency increased the NESR and RSR without affecting renal hemodynamics and that the antidiuretic effect was probably produced via the activation of postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors, but not via the ANG II receptor, located on the renal tubules. The release of NE appears to be modulated by ANG II through the activation of a facilitatory prejunctional mechanism, which is maximally stimulated by endogenously and locally generated basal levels of ANG II.", 
    "97": "The influence of isoproterenol (10(-9)M) and high calcium solution (6 mM) on the intracellular longitudinal resistance (ri) on rat papillary muscle was investigated. The muscles were stimulated at 1 Hz. Isoproterenol (10(-5)M) reduced ri within 10 s while high calcium solution (6 mM) increased ri appreciably. In muscles previously exposed to high calcium solution, isoproterenol increased ri further. This increment of ri, which was suppressed by verapamil (10(-5) M), indicates that when the inward movement of calcium through surface cell membrane is appreciably enhanced, the increase in free (Ca)i counteracts the effect of cyclic AMP on ri. Forskolin (10(-5)M), an activator of adenyl cyclase, also reduced ri in muscles immersed in normal saline solution. The results indicate that cyclic AMP and calcium have opposite effects on the control of ri.", 
    "98": "Previous work has shown an increase in sympathetic stimulation of the heart during chemical or mechanical irritation of visceral organs, but the involvement of the coronary circulation in such reflexes is not clear. In five preliminary experiments in anesthetized dogs, esophageal distention produced a sympathetic stimulation of the heart, as evidenced by an increase in heart rate, which was abolished by non-selective beta-adrenergic and muscarinic blockades. On the basis of these preliminary data, we further examined a sympathetic coronary constriction during acute esophageal distension in which any direct adrenergic coronary constriction was unmasked by muscarinic blockade with atropine (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.), and non-selective beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.). In seven dogs anesthetized with alpha-chloralose in an open-chest procedure, the esophagus was rapidly distended to a pressure of 36 +/- 2 mm Hg, which was not significantly different from the distending pressure used in the preliminary experiments. During esophageal distention, the mean circumflex blood flow decreased to 77 +/- 10% (SEM) of the predistention value. This decrease was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). There was no change in left ventricular pressure, mean arterial pressure dP/dtmax, or heart rate. Intracoronary administration of the nonselective alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine completely abolished the reduction in mean circumflex coronary blood flow caused by esophageal distention in the presence of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic blockades. These results demonstrate a direct sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction elicited by esophageal distention. This vasoconstriction was due to activation of coronary alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "99": "The relationship between heart rate and QT interval was investigated during atrial stimulation (intrinsic effect of heart rate) in ten healthy male volunteers prior to and after administration of sotalol. The QT interval in the ECG (paper speed 200 mm/s) was determined at rates of 70, 85, 100, 115, 130, 145, and 160 beats/min and at pacing periods of 180 s each at 30, 60, 120, and 180 s. After a 15-minute period, 2.0 mg sotalol/kg body weight were administered iv and the stimulation protocol was repeated. The analysis of QT interval behavior reveals contradictions to the mathematical implications of Bazett's equation QT = QTc square root of 60/HR, so that the relationship between heart rate and QT interval is not adequately described under the given conditions. After examination of approaches reported in the literature and our own approaches, the expression QT = a e-b (HR-60) is used as a possibility differentially to describe the data by nonlinear regression. The parameters a and b may be interpreted as QT reference value and shortening parameter. The QT reference value a, a parameter in reference to heart rate of 60 beats/min, has a comparable significance to the expression QTc in the Bazett equation. A reduction in the shortening parameter b indicates whether substances influencing the QT interval additionally produce overproportional shortening of the QT interval with increasing heart rate. After administration of sotalol, an increase can be observed in both the QT reference value and also in the shortening parameter. The suggested approach is an attempt to provide a more precise assessment of the QT interval under different conditions.", 
    "100": "Sensing of the ventricular depolarization gradient (VDG) has recently been used as the basis of a closed-loop rate responsive pacemaker. Factors influencing this aspect of the evoked response have not been fully evaluated although previous reports have suggested that sympathetic stimulation and circulating catecholamines are primarily responsible for the observed changes during stress and exercise. In five patients (Table I), four males and one female (mean age 60.4 +/- 10.1 years) implanted with the Prism pacemaker, the pacing response to exercise and tilting was assessed before and after the infusion of propranolol. There was an increase in the pacing rate in all patients during the infusion of the drug (mean 27 +/- 12.9 beats/min) suggestive of a direct drug effect on the VDG. The rate control parameter (RCP) of the pacemaker, the numerical equivalent of the VDG, was significantly different after the administration of propranolol (P less than 0.01). However, exercise performance and pacing rate behavior were not different after beta blockade. The pacing rate increase observed when tilting patients to the supine position was not altered by propranolol. Out date suggest that factors other than adrenergic stimulation may be of importance in affecting the ventricular evoked response and accordingly the rate adaptation of the Prism pacemaker.", 
    "101": "The barrier function of human artery endothelial cells was improved by addition of agents that increase the cellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentration. Together with a decrease in the passage rate of peroxidase, an increase in the transendothelial electrical resistance was observed. A direct correlation was found between the relative increases in cellular cAMP concentration and the relative decrease in peroxidase passage after incubation of the cells with forskolin (0.25 and 2.5 microM), the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 microM), and the stable prostacyclin analogue iloprost (10 microM). Norepinephrine (10 microM) reduced the peroxidase passage to a much larger extent (40% reduction) than might be expected on the basis of a small increase of cAMP concentration. This small increase in cAMP (44%) was the result of interactions of norepinephrine with beta-adrenergic receptors, which increase cAMP, and alpha-adrenergic receptors, which decrease cAMP. The relatively strong reduction in permeability (also found in the presence of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine) suggests that an additional cAMP-independent mechanism underlaid the barrier-improving effect of norepinephrine. A marked elevation of cAMP by forskolin was accompanied by a disappearance of F-actin and myosin from stress fibers. They were found diffusely spread over the cell, and F-actin in the cell periphery became prominently visible.", 
    "102": "Betablockers may be classified according to their cardio selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic action and direct vasodilating action. All beta blockers reduce renin plasma levels, the effect being inversely proportional to the intrinsic sympathomimetic property. The hypotensive effect is related more to vasodilation than to a decrease in cardiac output. The hypotensive action is mediated by presynaptic beta receptors which normally stimulate noradrenaline secretion by nerve endings. Adverse effects, interaction with other drugs, and effects on risk factors of beta blockers are also reviewed.", 
    "103": "Beta adrenergic blocking agents are in widespread use as both systemic and topical medications. While they are safely used in the great majority of cases, several side effects are well known. Central nervous system side effects, specifically depression, can be among the most clinically important of these and must be investigated by the clinician.", 
    "104": "In chronic experiments on male cats the irritation of adrenoreactive amygdalar structures by catecholamines injection through chemotrode was performed. It was shown that these structures took part in the regulation of the blood coagulative system and specificities of alpha- and beta-adrenoreactive structures influences upon different phases of blood coagulation were also discovered.", 
    "105": "The incidence of both systolic and diastolic hypertension is increased in elderly patients, therefore antihypertensive drugs are commonly used in this population. In addition to changes in blood pressure, the aging process also causes numerous changes in other physiological parameters, resulting in altered pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to the drugs. The dosage regimens for thiazide diuretics and amiloride must be individually titrated in the elderly patient, since the elimination of these agents decreases concurrently with decreased renal function, as indicated by compromised creatinine clearance. The initial doses of the calcium antagonists should be decreased in elderly patients, since representative compounds from all 3 chemically heterogeneous classes have been shown to have decreased clearance in these patients which appears to be primarily due to the status of hepatic function in the patient. However, with verapamil, the dosage should be further decreased in association with compromised renal function. The dosage of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be adjusted according to renal function rather than age. Lisinopril, which is primarily eliminated unchanged, is usually given in lower doses in the elderly, and doses of both captopril and enalapril may need to be reduced, depending on renal function. While there is no need to adjust the dosage regimen for the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (prazosin, terazosin), caution should be used with the beta-adrenergic blockers, particularly the hydrophilic agents, since they are renally eliminated. Labetalol may be a suitable alternative beta-blocker for the elderly patient, since its pharmacodynamic properties of decreased systemic vascular resistance without changes in heart rate or stroke volume are preferential for the elderly patient, and its pharmacokinetics are relatively unchanged in this population. Drugs that act primarily through the central nervous system, such as clonidine, methyldopa and guanfacine, require smaller doses in the presence of renal dysfunction. In contrast, guanabenz is metabolised primarily by the liver, so it would appear to be useful in elderly patients with renal dysfunction despite the lack of studies in this population. Guanadrel, an adrenergic neuron blocking drug, also requires a dosage reduction in patients with impaired renal function. In addition to the pharmacokinetic changes that occur in the elderly patient, pharmacodynamic changes may also be anticipated due to receptor modifications. Older patients have a decrease in beta-receptor sensitivity, while alpha-receptor sensitivity does not change. When designing the dosage regimen for a senior patient with hypertension, the combination of all these variables must be considered.", 
    "106": "The present study was undertaken to elucidate the metabolic profile of the beta-blocking effects of befunolol on catecholamine-induced changes in plasma glucose, lactate and free fatty acid concentrations and myocardial metabolism. Effects of propranolol were also tested for the purpose of comparison. Epinephrine, at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 mg/kg, induced significant increases in the plasma glucose, lactate and free fatty acid concentrations. These changes were inhibited by pretreatment with either befunolol or propranolol at doses of 0.03 mg/kg or above. Isoproterenol-induced changes in systemic blood pressure and heart rate were reduced by pretreatment with intravenous injection of 10 and 100 micrograms/kg of bufunolol and 100 micrograms/kg of propranolol. Isoproterenol-induced changes in myocardial ATP, creatine phosphate, lactate and cyclic AMP were also reduced by pretreatment with 10 and 100 micrograms/kg of befunolol and 100 micrograms/kg of propranolol. Propranolol, at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg, did not reduce isoproterenol-induced changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and in myocardial ATP, creatine phosphate and cyclic AMP contents. The results demonstrate that befunolol exerts an inhibitory action on catecholamine-induced hemodynamic and metabolic alterations, and provide further evidence for the beta-blocking action of this drug.", 
    "107": "The effects of tandospirone, a novel 5-HT1A receptor-related anxiolytic, on pressor responses elicited by activation of the posterior hypothalamus were examined in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized cats and compared with those of diazepam and tofisopam. Intravenous administration of tandospirone (0.1-1 mg/kg) and diazepam (1 mg/kg) markedly inhibited the pressor responses to stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus, but did not inhibit the pressor responses to intravenous norepinephrine. The inhibition of the posterior hypothalamus-induced pressor response by tandospirone was significantly antagonized by pindolol (a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist) but not by CGS-8216 (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist), while the latter reduced the inhibitory effects of diazepam. Tofisopam (a 2,3-benzodiazepine which lacks affinity for benzodiazepine receptors) only attenuated the posterior hypothalamus-induced pressor responses at a high dose (10 mg/kg), which was sufficient to suppress the norepinephrine-induced pressor responses. These results indicate that tandospirone, diazepam and tofisopam all inhibit the pressor response to the posterior hypothalamus activation. In addition, tandospirone and diazepam exert this effect through different mechanisms, the former probably through 5-HT1A receptors and the latter through benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "108": "Using a radioligand binding assay, we assessed the affinity and selectivity of the antagonistic effects of bopindolol (4-(benzoyloxy-3-tert-butylaminopropyl)-2-methylindole hydrogen-malonate) and its two metabolites, (18-502, (4-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-2-methyl indole) and 20-785, (4-(3-tert-butylaminopropoxy)-2-carboxyl indole], for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors and on 5HT1B-receptors in rat brain and heart. In addition, we also determined the pA2 values of these agents for their antagonistic effects toward positive chronotropic and inotropic actions (beta 1-adrenoceptors) and for their antagonistic effects toward isolated tracheal relaxation (beta 2-adrenoceptors), using isoproterenol as an agonist. The data showed that bopindolol was more selective for beta 2-adrenoceptors than for beta 1-adrenoceptors and 5HT1B-receptors, but its two metabolites (18-502 and 20-785) did not have significant selectivity for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, using both [3H]CGP12177 and [125I]ICYP ([125I]iodocyanopindolol) bindings. In contrast, the results from pharmacological assessment for antagonistic potencies, using atria and trachea, showed that bopindolol and its two metabolites did not have significant selectivity on beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. A major metabolite of bopindolol, 18-502, had higher pKi and pA2 values for beta-adrenoceptors and 5HT1B-receptors than those of bopindolol and 20-785. These results indicate, first, that a radioligand binding assay for the assessment of the selectivity of bopindolol and its two metabolites for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors is more effective than pharmacological experiments, and that there is a possibility that its two metabolites also contribute to the strong beta-blocking action of bopindolol."
