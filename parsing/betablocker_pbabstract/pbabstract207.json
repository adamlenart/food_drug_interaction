    "0": "Almost 5 million individuals in the United States have chronic heart failure (HF), which is increasing in prevalence. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are standard therapies for HF, although more than 10% of patients with HF are unable to tolerate these agents. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors may not provide complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the long term. Because angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may block the RAS more completely than ACE inhibitors and are better tolerated, several large-scale ARB trials have been performed exploring their potential role in treating patients with symptomatic HF and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study (ELITE II) demonstrated no significant differences in morbidity and mortality between the ARB losartan and the ACE inhibitor captopril among elderly patients with HF. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) demonstrated reductions in hospitalizations for HF with the ARB valsartan when added to standard HF therapy, with no effect on mortality. Both trials suggested a potential negative interaction between ARB and beta-blocker therapy. The Candesartan in Heart failure-Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) program demonstrated significant reductions in morbidity and mortality with the ARB candesartan in patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction, with or without ACE inhibitors and with or without beta blockers. Thus, the addition of ARBs to the treatment regimen of patients with symptomatic HF should be strongly considered.",

Of these, 138 were randomised, in a 2:3 ratio, to two therapeutic strategies: conventional (CONV) strategy (n = 59) or EPS-guided/ICD strategy (n = 79). The latter resulted in ICD implantation in 24 inducible patients and in CONV therapy in the remaining 55. During a mean follow-up of 540 +/- 378 days, 26 patients (19%) died: nine (6.5%) SD, nine (6.5%) non-SD, and four (3%) non-cardiac death; in four patients (3%) the cause of death was unknown. The actuarial overall mortality for the CONV and EPS-guided/ICD arms was 18% vs 14% after 1 year and 29.5% vs 20% after 2 years, respectively (P = 0.3 and 0.2).",

Patients who gave written informed consent were asked to return for blood sampling for estimation of serum glucose, total cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides and for genotype determination. Genotyping analysis was performed by PCR-RFLP assay. In patients bearing beta(2)AR Glu27 or the beta(3)AR Arg64 variant there was a larger occurrence of hypertriglyceridemia, alone or in combination with elevated cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the beta(2)AR Glu27 variant significantly associates with hypetriglyceridemia in a cumulative fashion. The risk to develop this side effect after beta-blockade was four-fold higher in patients homozygous for the beta(2)AR Glu27 variant as compared to beta(2)AR27Gln allele. This result allows the identification of patients at high risk to develop metabolic complications to chronic beta-blockade treatment.", 
    "5": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist carvedilol reverses cardiac dysfunction in the failing heart. A recent study showed that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists indirectly normalize Ca(2+)-regulatory proteins. The relationship between these two phenomena and the suitable dosage of carvedilol remains unclear. 2. We investigated the change in left ventricular (LV) remodelling and function in a rat model of heart failure due to myocardial infarction (MI) with or without carvedilol (30 or 2 mg/kg per day) treatment for 6 weeks. The expression of mRNA and proteins of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and phospholamban (PLB) in cardiomyocytes was also measured. 3. There was significant LV remodelling and cardiac contractile dysfunction in MI rats. The expression of SERCA mRNA and protein were downregulated (P < 0.01), but the expression of PLB mRNA and protein were upregulated (P < 0.01) in MI rats compared with sham-operated rats. After treatment with carvedilol, LV remodelling and cardiac contractile dysfunction were clearly improved. Low-dose carvedilol was better at improving some parameters of LV remodelling and function than the high dose. Carvedilol partially restored the low expression of SERCA (P < 0.05), but had no effect on PLB expression (P > 0.05). Moreover, low-dose carvedilol induced a more significant improvement in SERCA expression than did the high dose (P < 0.05). 4. The results of the present study suggest that carvedilol is effective in improving LV remodelling and cardiac contractile dysfunction after MI. This may be related to the normalization of SERCA expression.",

The relative bioavailability of two FDA approved (Orange Book AB rating) solid oral dosage forms of metoprolol and propranolol/hydrochlorothiazide (combination tablets) was evaluated in human volunteers under fed conditions using a two-way crossover design. Equal numbers of male and female volunteers were recruited, and racial and/or ethnic minorities were not excluded. The plasma concentrations of metoprolol, propranolol, and hydrochlorothiazide were determined using validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. Eighteen subjects completed the metoprolol study while 17 subjects completed the propranolol/hydrochlorothiazide combination tablet study. In the metoprolol study, the 90% confidence intervals of Cmax and AUC(inf) were 98-118% and 92-115%, respectively.

Menthol at different concentrations in isopropanol-water (6:4) mixture also was used as an enhancer wherein BPL at 0.4% w/v was completely solubilized. Skin pretreatment studies were carried out with all the above enhancers to understand their role in the penetration enhancement effect. PY and MPY at 5% w/v concentrations increased the permeation of BPL by 3.8- and 2.4-fold, respectively, versus control (p < .01). PG at 10% and 30 w/v concentrations increased the flux of BPL by 2.5- and 5.0-fold, respectively, versus control (p < .001). Menthol at 2% w/v concentration increased the flux of BPL by 3.8-fold (p < .01) and further increase in menthol concentration significantly decreased the flux of BPL.

We aimed to directly measure NP-derived nitric oxide (NO) in the vascular wall. An NO-sensitive microelectrode was inserted into the vascular media (the vasodilatory action site of NO) of isolated perfused canine femoral arteries. Each vessel was perfused with 15 microM NP in the presence or absence of 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; a thiol alkylator). Intravascular-wall NO concentration increased 181+/-34 nM during NP perfusion (P<0.001 vs basal, n=10) with an average base-to-peak reaction time of 1.5+/-0.1 min (P<0.0001, n=8). Concomitant perfusion of NEM with NP attenuated the intravascular-wall NO production significantly (P<0.0001 vs NP only).

    "15": "The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the short-term effects of surgical left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) on the QT interval and heart rate in patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). Left cardiac sympathetic denervation was performed in five LQTS patients who had a history of syncope. The patients' 12-lead and 24-h Holter monitoring ECG was recorded 24 h before and 24 h after LCSD. Treadmill exercise tests were also performed before and 6 days after surgery to assess changes in heart rate and the QT interval after surgery. Left cardiac sympathetic denervation was successful in all patients. The mean value of the corrected QT interval (QTc) in the five patients decreased from 0.59+/-0.05 to 0.48+/-0.04 s (P=0.006) immediately after the procedure and remained short (0.47+/-0.04, P<0.05) after a 21-month follow-up. The mean value of QTc on the 24-h Holter monitoring ECG also decreased in all patients (0.67+/-0.07 vs 0.60+/-0.05 s, P<0.01). The mean, maximum, and minimum heart rate on the 24-h ECG remained unchanged (P>0.05). The maximum heart rate during the exercise tests decreased from 162+/-4 beats/min before surgery to 129+/-10 beats/min (P<0.01). The exercise-induced increase in QTc remained unchanged after the surgery (P>0.05). Although four of the five patients were syncope-free until 21 months postoperatively, the remaining patient had a recurrence of syncope, requiring an increased dose of beta blocker. These findings indicate that LCSD shortens QTc and diminishes the exercise-induced increase in heart rate whereas the resting heart rate and exercise-induced increase in QTc remain unchanged. These results may have implications for the effectiveness and limitations of LCSD.",

The program included: (1) the carvedilol initiation and titration period, and (2) long-term follow-up at 6 and 12 months. Of 1299 patients in the registry, 504 were excluded due to current therapy; of the remaining 795 eligible patients, 293 were excluded due to contraindications. Of the included patients with follow-up data (n = 316), 93.3% tolerated carvedilol initiation and 47.7% of the patients reached the target dose of 50 mg/day for a mean dose of 39 mg/day. Rates were comparable in the elderly (n = 83), of which 53% achieved a target dose for a mean dose of 43.08 mg/day. This protocol improved therapy rates and achieved target doses quickly (average of 4 visits). Concomitant medications did not have to be adjusted and there were low withdrawal rates (10%) and hospital admissions (7.2%) for HF. Patients were able to maintain carvedilol therapy at 6 and 12 months. These results indicate that a standardized titration protocol, as used in GESICA, for the initiation and titration of beta-blockers is well tolerated and may improve beta-blocker use in carefully selected heart failure patients.",

    "21": "Most textbook knowledge on ventricular repolarization is based on animal data rather than on data from the in vivo human heart. Yet, these data have been extrapolated to the human heart, often without an appropriate caveat. Here, we review multiple aspects of repolarization, from basic membrane currents to cellular aspects including extrinsic factors such as the effects of the sympathetic nervous system. We critically discuss some mechanistic aspects of the genesis of the T-wave of the ECG in the human heart. Obviously, the T-wave results from the summation of repolarization all over the heart. The T-wave in a local electrogram ideally reflects local repolarization. The repolarization moment is composed of the moment of local activation plus local action potential duration (APD) at 90% repolarization (APD90). The duration of the latter largely depends on the balance between L-type Ca2+ current and the delayed rectifier currents. Generally speaking, there is an inverse relationship between local activation time and local APD90, leading to less dispersion in repolarization moments than in activation moments or in APD90. In transmural direction, the time needed for activation from endocardium toward epicardium has been considered to be overcompensated by shorter APD90 at the epicardium, leading to the earliest repolarization at the subepicardium. In addition, mid-myocardial cells would display the latest repolarization moments. The sparse human data available, however, do not show any transmural dispersion in repolarization moment. Also, the effect of adrenergic stimulation on APD90 has been studied mainly in animals. Again, sparse human data suggest that the effect of adrenergic stimulation is different in the human heart compared to many other mammalian hearts. Finally, aspects of the long QT syndrome are discussed, because this intrinsic genetic disease results from repolarization disorders with extrinsic aspects.",

    "25": "Seven current areas of clinical uncertainty (decision problems) in the drug treatment of unstable angina patients were identified. The agents concerned were clopidogrel, low molecular weight heparin, hirudin and intravenous glycoprotein antagonists (GPAs). Twelve published clinical guidelines for unstable angina or non-ST elevation ACS were identified, but few contained recommendations about the specified decision problems. The postal survey of clinicians showed that the greatest disagreement existed for the use of small molecule GPAs, and the greatest uncertainty existed for decisions relating to the use of abciximab (a large molecule GPA). Overall, decision problems concerning the GPA class of drugs were considered to be the highest priority for further study. Selected papers describing the clinical efficacy of treatment were divided into three groups, each representing an alternative strategy. The strategy involving the use of GPAs as part of the initial medical management of all non-ST elevation ACS was the optimal choice, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 5738 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with no use of GPAs. Stochastic analysis showed that if the health service is willing to pay 10,000 pounds per additional QALY, the probability of this strategy being cost-effective was around 82%, increasing to 95% at a threshold of 50,000 pounds per QALY. A sensitivity analysis including an additional strategy of using GPAs as part of initial medical management only in patients at particular high risk (as defined by age, ST depression or diabetes) showed that this additional strategy was yet more cost-effective, with an ICER of 3996 pounds per QALY compared with no treatment with GPA. Value of information analysis suggested that there was considerable merit in additional research to reduce the level of uncertainty in the optimal decision. At a threshold of 10,000 pounds per QALY, the maximum potential value of such research in the base case was calculated as 12.7 million pounds per annum for the UK as a whole. Taking account of the greater uncertainty in the sensitivity analyses including clopidogrel, this figure was increased to approximately 50 million pounds.",

Sensitivity analysis showed that virtually all of the benefit could be realised by treating only high-risk patients. Further clarification of the optimum role of GPAs in the UK NHS depends on the availability of further high-quality observational and trial data. Value of information analysis derived from the model suggests that a relatively large investment in such research may be worthwhile. Further research should focus on the identification of the characteristics of patients who benefit most from GPAs as part of medical management, the comparison of GPAs with clopidogrel as an adjunct to standard care, follow-up cohort studies of the costs and outcomes of high-risk non-ST elevation ACS over several years, and exploring how clinicians' decisions combine a normative evidence-based decision model with their own personal behavioural perspective.",

    "36": "The role of ion channels and membrane potential (V(m)) in non-excitable cells has recently come under increased scrutiny. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, express voltage-gated Kv1.3 channels, a Kir2.1-like inward rectifier, a swelling-activated Cl(-) current and several other channels. We previously showed that Kv1.3 and Cl(-) currents are needed for microglial cell proliferation and that Kv1.3 is important for the respiratory burst. Although their mechanisms of action are unknown, one general role for these channels is to maintain a negative V(m). An impediment to measuring V(m) in non-excitable cells is that many have a very high electrical resistance, which makes them extremely susceptible to leak-induced depolarization. Using non-invasive V(m)-sensitive dyes, we show for the first time that the membrane resistance of microglial cells is several gigaohms; much higher than the seal resistance during patch-clamp recordings. Surprisingly, we observed that small current injections can evoke large V(m) oscillations in some microglial cells, and that injection of sinusoidal currents of varying frequency exposes a strong intrinsic electrical resonance in the 5- to 20-Hz frequency range in all microglial cells tested. Using a dynamic current clamp that we developed to actively compensate for the damage done by the patch-clamp electrode, we found that the V(m) oscillations and resonance were more prevalent and larger. Both types of electrical behaviour required Kv1.3 channels, as they were eliminated by the Kv1.3 blocker, agitoxin-2. To further determine how the ion currents integrate in these cells, voltage-clamp recordings from microglial cells displaying these behaviours were used to analyse the biophysical properties of the Kv1.3, Kir and Cl(-) currents. A mathematical model that incorporated only these three currents reproduced the observed V(m) oscillations and electrical resonance. Thus, the electrical behaviour of this 'non-excitable' cell type is much more complex than previously suspected, and might reflect a more common oversight in high resistance cells.",

Patients with HF had significant ventricular dyssynchrony compared with a normal population.

    "49": "The management of pediatric migraine requires a balance of biobehavioral measures coupled with agents for acute treatment and, if needed, daily preventive medicines. A recent American Academy of Neurology practice parameter has critically reviewed the limited data regarding the efficacy and safety of medicines for the acute and preventive therapy of pediatric migraine. The first step is to establish the headache frequency and degree to which the migraines impact upon lifestyle and performance. The next step is to institute nonpharmacologic measures such as regulation of sleep (improved sleep hygiene), moderation of caffeine, regular exercise, and identification of provocative influences (eg, stress, foods, social pressures). A wide variety of therapeutic options exist for patients whose migraine headaches occur with sufficient frequency and severity to produce functional impairment. The most rigorously studied agents for the acute treatment of migraine are ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and sumatriptan nasal spray, all of which have shown safety and efficacy in controlled trials. Daily preventive drug therapies are warranted in about 20% to 30% of young migraine sufferers. The particular drug selected for the individual patient requires an appreciation of comorbidities such as affective or anxiety disorders, co-existent medical conditions such as asthma or diabetes, and acceptability of potential toxicities such as weight gain, sedation, or tremor.",

Removal of Na(+) from basolateral solution almost completely abolished the I(SC) response to TMP, but it was insensitive to apical Na(+) replacement or apical Na(+) channel blocker, amiloride. Pretreatment of colonic mucosa with BAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeable selective Ca(2+) chelator, did not significantly alter the TMP-induced I(SC). No additive effect of forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) was observed on the TMP-induced I(SC), but it was significantly reduced by a protein kinase A inhibitor, H(89). RIA results showed that TMP (1 mmol/L) elicited a significant increase in cellular cAMP production, which was similar to that elicited by the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (10 micromol/L).

Aspirin also inhibits thrombin generation (TG) in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) activated by sodium arachidonate (AA). The effect of the platelet membrane GP IIb-IIIa (integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3)) blocker abciximab on thrombin generation was studied in vitro using PRP. Thirty healthy volunteers taking no medication, and 28 volunteers who had taken aspirin (160 mg/day for 3-4 days), were included in the protocol. Control or in vivo aspirinated PRP, stimulated or not by AA or tissue factor (TF), was investigated for the inhibitory effect of abciximab pre-incubated for 3 minutes. AA and TF added in vitro activated non-aspirinated PRP: lag-time (LT) and time to peak (TTP) were significantly shortened. Peak TG (PTG) and endogenous thrombin potential (ETG) were increased by AA but not TF; thus, AA seems to be more efficient than TF for TG in this system. Abciximab added in vitro to non-activated, non-aspirinated PRP had no effect on LT, TTP, or ETP, but caused a decrease in PTG that was not statistically significant. Abciximab (3 or 4 microg/mL) added in vitro to AA or TF-activated, non-aspirinated PRP produced no effect on TG, although in aspirinated platelets both LT and time to peak were prolonged. AA as well as TF added in vitro to PRP or in vivo aspirinated PRP increased TG, although AA seems to be more efficient in our assay system. Abciximab, which affects non-aspirinated, nonactivated PRP weakly, has no effect on AA or TF in activated control PRP or in vivo aspirinated PRP.",

The benefits of beta blockers extend across the boundaries of age, gender, and ethnicity, and include diabetic patients with heart failure and/or previous myocardial infarction. Unfortunately, beta blockers remain underutilized in many high-risk patients who would likely benefit from their use. This paper reviews the protective role of beta blockade in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and examines some of the potential barriers to appropriate beta blocker use in patients with compelling indications.", 
    "56": "Increasing systolic blood pressure and heart rate during the early morning results in increased myocardial oxygen demand. The use of beta blockers during this period may decrease cardiac workload, particularly in beta-blocker sensitive patients. The impact of a new chronotherapeutic beta blocker was assessed in 44 hypertensive patients. Patients were randomized to delayed-release propranolol (INP) dosed at 10 p.m. or to traditionally dosed propranolol (ILA) dosed at 8 a.m. for 4 weeks, following which they were switched to the alternative formulation for 4 weeks. Thirty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and pharmacokinetic measurements were obtained. INP and ILA resulted in significant reductions in mean 24-hour blood pressure (-9.0/-6.9 mm Hg and -10.4/-7.7 mm Hg, respectively). The top 25% of responders to high-dose propranolol (sensitive patients) were compared on each formulation. Mean trough reductions were -8.0/-6.7 mm Hg and -7.6/-5.8 mm Hg, respectively. Mean blood pressure reductions in the beta-blocker sensitive patients (n = 11) between 6 a.m. and noon were -15.2/-11.9 mm Hg on INP and -8.0/-4.6 mm Hg on ILA. Heart rate reduction was -14.1 bpm and double product reduction was -3319 in the INP patients between 6 a.m. and 12 noon compared with -10.5 and -2209 in the ILA patients. This study suggests that INP and ILA are effective once-a-day beta blockers, but the use of delayed-release propanolol results in a greater reduction in double product between 6 a.m. and noon in beta-blocker sensitive patients than does traditionally dosed propranolol.",

We present herein the first case of SCLE induced by acebutolol. A 57-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of a cutaneous eruption of the photo-exposed areas. One month ago, the patient had started a treatment with oral acebutolol to cure a hypertension of 1-year evolution. Physical examination revealed erythematous scaly annular plaques, involving the face, arms and trunk. Immunologic serology findings revealed a positive titer of antinuclear antibodies up to 1/1,280 with positivity of antihistone and Ro/SSA antibodies. Acebutolol was stopped, and the lesions cleared completely 4 months later. Literature data, along with our case, suggest a link between acebutolol therapy and the onset of a lupus syndrome. Although this is the first report of acebutolol-induced SCLE, we should be aware of this occurrence, and avoidance of acebutolol is recommended in patients with stigmata of lupus erythematosus.",

Here, we verified the expression of K(V)2.1 channel protein in mouse and human islets of Langerhans. We then probed the function of K(V)2.1 channels in islet glucose responses by comparing the effect of hanatoxin (HaTx), a specific blocker of K(V)2.1 channels, with a nonspecific K(+) channel blocker, tetraethylammonium (TEA). Application of HaTx (1 microM) blocked delayed-rectifier currents in mouse beta-cells, resulting in a 40-mV rightward shift in threshold of activation of the voltage-dependent outward current. In the presence of HaTx, there was negligible voltage-activated outward current below 0 mV, suggesting that K(V)2.1 channels form the predominant part of this current in the physiologically relevant range. We then employed HaTx to study the role of K(V)2.1 in the beta-cell Ca(2+) responses to elevated glucose in comparison with TEA. Only HaTx was able to induce slow intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) oscillations in cells stimulated with 20 mM glucose, whereas TEA induced an immediate rise in [Ca(2+)](i) followed by rapid oscillations. In human islets, HaTx acted in a similar fashion. The data were analyzed using a detailed mathematical model of ionic flux and Ca(2+) regulation in beta-cells. The results can be explained by a specific HaTx effect on the K(V) current, whereas TEA affects multiple K(+) conductances. The results underscore the importance of K(V)2.1 channel in repolarization of the pancreatic beta-cell plasma membrane and its role in regulating insulin secretion.",

In this study, bupranolol and SR 59230A were further evaluated for their potential alpha-adrenoceptor mediated effects (i.e., agonist and/or antagonist properties) in rat intralobar pulmonary artery and compared with BRL 37344 and CL 316243. Bupranolol induced a relaxation in phenylephrine-precontracted arteries, but had no effect in prostaglandin F2alpha(PGF2alpha) -precontracted ones. SR 59230A also elicited a relaxation in phenylephrine-precontracted arteries. In PGF2alpha -precontracted arteries, SR 59230A induced a contractile response that was insensitive to the irreversible alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine. BRL 37344 at high concentrations, but not CL 316243, produced slight relaxation in both phenylephrine- and PGF2alpha -precontracted arteries. The contractile response to phenylephrine was antagonized by bupranolol and SR 59230A in a competitive manner (pA2: 6.38 and 7.08 respectively). The concentration-response curve to phenylephrine was also shifted to the right by BRL 37344 (mean pKb: 4.45), but not by CL 316243 (100 microM). This study indicates that the aryloxypropanolamine derivatives bupranolol and SR 59230A exhibit competitive antagonist, but no agonist properties on alpha1-adrenoceptors, SR 59230A also inducing alpha-adrenoceptor-independent contraction. Among the phenylethanolamines, BRL 37344 but not CL 316243, also exerts an antagonist effect on alpha1-adrenoceptors, with a much lower potency than the aryloxypropanolamines studied.",

There was no evidence for EP3 receptor coupling to Gq-mediated protein kinase C signaling. Isolated hearts from tg and wt mice were subjected to 60 minutes of no-flow ischemia and 45 minutes of reperfusion.

Alternans voltage in lead vector magnitude (eVM) was measured during atrial pacing (90, 110 beats/min (bpm)). After eVM was measured at baseline, propranolol was administered, and eVM was measured again. In a subset of 18 patients (10 with VT and 8 with SVT), isoproterenol was administered prior to propranolol infusion. After propranolol infusion, eVM of both the VT and the SVT groups decreased significantly compared to baseline. The changes in absolute value of eVM at 110 bpm after propranolol infusion were greater in the VT group than in the SVT group (-1.3 +/- 0.8 microV vs -0.5 +/- 0.8 microV, P < 0.05). The eVM values of both the VT and the SVT groups increased after administration of isoproterenol compared to the baseline value.

The use of beta-blockers was associated with a better survival (P = 0.0005). This effect persisted after correcting for age, heart rate, EF, and ischemic etiology. The beneficial effect of beta-blocker was unrelated to its effect on heart rate. Digoxin use was associated with a lower survival only on univariate analysis (P = 0.006), but not after adjusting for other variables on a Cox regression model (P = 0.093).

Online SPE LC-MS/MS methods were developed in the automated mode for the quantification of model compounds (propranolol and diclofenac) directly in rat plasma. Accuracy and precision using online SPE LC-MS/MS with conventional C18 and monolithic columns were in the range of 88-111% and 0.5-14%, respectively. Total analysis cycle time of 4 min per sample was demonstrated using the C18 column. Monolithic column allowed for 2 min total cycle time without compromising the quality and validation criteria of the method. Direct plasma sample injection without on-line SPE resulted in poor accuracy and precision in the range of 41-108% and 3-81%.

    "111": "PF9404C ((2'S),(2S)-3-isopropylamine, 1-[4-(2,3-dinitroxy)propoxymethyl]-phenoxy-2'-propranol) is the S-S diesteroisomer of a novel blocker of beta-adrenergic receptors with vasorelaxing properties. It causes a concentration-dependent relaxation of rat aorta helical strips precontracted with 10(-6) M norepinephrine (NE; IC50 33 nM). It is equipotent to nitroglycerin (NTG; IC50 49 nM), but much more potent than isosorbide dinitrate (ISD; IC50 15,000 nM). In rat aorta smooth muscle cells, at 10 microM, PF9404C increased the formation of cGMP from 3 pmol/mg protein in basal conditions to 53 pmol/mg protein, suggesting that the mechanism of its vasorelaxing effects involves the slow generation of NO. This is supported by the facts that (i) ODQ (a blocker of guanylate cyclase) inhibited the vasodilatory effects of PF9404C; and (ii) PF9404C generates NO, as indirectly measured by the Griess reaction. In the electrically driven guinea pig left atrium, PF9404C blocks the inotropic effects of isoproterenol in a concentration-dependent manner. Its IC50 (30 nM) was similar to that of S-propranolol (22.4 nM) and lower than that of metoprolol (120 nM) or atenolol (192 nM). The beta adrenergic ligand (-)-[3H]-CGP12177 (4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one hydrochloride) (0.2 nM) is displaced from its binding sites in rat brain membranes with a K(i) of 7, 17, 170, and 1200 nM for PF9404C, S-(-)propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol, respectively. PF9404C blocks 45Ca2+ entry into bovine adrenal chromaffin cells induced by direct depolarization with 70 mM K+ or by the nicotinic agonist dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP). PF9404C exhibits about 3-fold higher potency than NTG to relax the majority of the vessels studied, especially when they were contracted with K+, and shows a certain selectivity of action for the renal artery. It produces auto-tolerance that is ca. 20-fold less pronounced than that observed with NTG. Cross-tolerance in preparations pre-exposed to PF9404C and later relaxed with NTG, was much greater than auto-tolerance. This makes PF9404C a useful pharmacological tool for the development of novel NO-donor compounds with a lesser degree of vascular tolerance than those currently available.",

Incidence of heart rhythm disturbances and values of parameters of echocardiogram were similar in both groups.", 
    "113": "The beta-adrenoceptor subtype that mediates adrenaline-induced relaxation was pharmacologically identified in smooth muscle cells of the isolated guinea-pig trachea. Adrenaline produced a concentration-dependent relaxation with a pD(2) value of 7.1. The concentration-response curve for adrenaline was shifted rightwards in a competitive fashion by the beta(1)-/beta(2)-nonselective antagonists propranolol and bupranolol, with pA(2) values of 8.85 and 8.97, respectively. Adrenaline-induced relaxation was not affected by the beta(1)-selective antagonists atenolol and CGP-20, 712A within the concentration ranges supposed to antagonize the beta(1)-subtype (atenolol, <or=10(-6) M; CGP-20, 712A, <or=10(-8) M). By contrast, the concentration-response curve for adrenaline was shifted rightwards in a competitive fashion by atenolol at concentrations >or=3x10(-6) M with a pA(2) value of 5.77. The concentration-response curve for adrenaline was also competitively antagonized by the beta(2)-selective antagonists butoxamine and ICI-118,551 with pA(2) values of 6.86 and 8.73, respectively. The pA(2) values of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol, bupranolol, atenolol, butoxamine and ICI-118,551) tested against adrenaline were consistent with the values when tested against salbutamol, a beta(2)-selective adrenoceptor agonist. The present findings provide evidence that the relaxant response of the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig trachea to the adrenal medulla hormone, adrenaline, is mainly mediated through beta(2)-adrenoceptors.",

A thyroid radioiodine uptake scan was 2.2% at 25 hours. Pathology examination of the neck mass disclosed anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. His thyrotoxicosis was managed with beta-adrenergic blockade. The thyroid carcinoma was treated palliatively with external beam irradiation. During week 9 after the patient's initial presentation, symptomatic hypocalcemia developed, with an ionized serum calcium level of 0.75 mmol/L (normal range, 1.15 to 1.29) and a parathyroid hormone level of 21.2 pg/mL (normal range, 10 to 65).

Microparticles were characterized in terms of morphology, size, swelling properties, encapsulation efficiency and drug release. The physical state of the drug and the polymer was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Propranolol hydrochloride (PH) was a beta-blocker, used for the treatment of hypertension and was chosen as a model of hydrophilic drug. SEM studies showed spherical particles with smooth surfaces for chitosan hydrochloride (CH-HCl), whereas rather gross surface defects resulted from the incorporation of poly(methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride) (PVM/MA). In vitro release studies revealed a sustained release of propranolol HCl from microparticles and in particular chitosan hydrochloride provided the lowest release of drug.",

The method involved a simple single-step liquid-liquid extraction with diethyl ether/dichloromethane (70/30). The analyte was chromatographed on Waters symmetry C18 reversed-phase chromatographic column by isocratic elution with water:acetonitrile:formic acid (30:70:0.03, v/v) and analyzed by mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The precursor to product ion transitions of m/z 406.4-151.5 and m/z 409.1-228.1 were used to measure the analyte and the internal standard (I.S.), respectively. The chromatographic runtime was 2 min and the weighted (1/x2) calibration curves were linear over the range 50-10,000 pg/mL. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, absolute recovery, freeze-thaw stability, bench-top stability and re-injection reproducibility. The limit of detection and lower limit of quantification in human plasma were 10 and 50 pg/mL, respectively. The within- and between-batch accuracy and precision were found to be well within acceptable limits (<10%). The analyte was stable after three freeze-thaw cycles (deviation <10%). The average absolute recoveries of nebivolol and tamsulosin, used as an internal standard, from spiked plasma samples were 73.4+/-3.7 and 72.1+/-2.0%, respectively.

    "120": "In aged Fischer 344 (F334) rats, sympathetic innervation of the spleen is markedly diminished compared with young rats. To determine if this diminished noradrenergic (NA) innervation maintains a functional connection with the immune system, 3- and 17-month-old male F344 rats were treated with the NA-selective neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), to ablate peripheral NA nerve fibers. In sympathectomized rats immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), a T-dependent protein antigen, anti-KLH IgM, IgG, IgG1, IgG2b antibody titers were increased in young and old rats 14 days after immunization compared to vehicle controls. Furthermore, the number of IgM and IgG anti-KLH antibody-secreting spleen cells was elevated 7 and 14 days post-immunization. These effects were prevented by pretreatment with desipramine, a catecholamine uptake blocker that blocks 6-OHDA uptake and subsequent sympathectomy. Chemical sympathectomy also increased KLH-induced proliferation in vitro by spleen cells from old, but not young animals. Isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, elicited a rise in cAMP in spleen cells from NA-intact young and old rats, but the increase was attenuated in spleen cells from old rats. These results demonstrate that, although NA innervation in the F344 rat spleen is diminished with age, sympathetic signaling of the immune system remains intact. Thus, the SNS can inhibit antibody produced in response to a protein antigen in both young and old F344 rats.",

The extracts were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Chromatography was performed isocratically on Alltech Prevail C18 5 microm analytical column, (150 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.). The method had a chromatographic run time of 3.5 min and a linear calibration curve over the range 0.1-200 ng ml(-1) (r2>0.997992). The limit of quantification was 0.1 ng ml(-1). This HPLC-MS/MS procedure was used to assess the bioequivalence of two carvedilol 25 mg tablet formulations (carvedilol test formulation from Laborat\u00f3rios Biosint\u00e9tica Ltda and Coreg from Roche Qu\u00edmicos e Farmac\u00eauticos S.A standard reference formulation). A single 25 mg dose of each formulation was administered to healthy volunteers. The study was conducted using an open, randomized, two-period crossover design with a 2-week wash-out interval. Since the 90% CI for C(max) and AUCs ratios were all inside the 80-125% interval proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration Agency, it was concluded that carvedilol formulation elaborated by Laborat\u00f3rios Biosint\u00e9tica Ltda is bioequivalent to Coreg formulation for both the rate and the extent of absorption.", 
    "122": "In the present study, we observed that isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) agonist, stimulated rat C6 glioma cell proliferation, while propranolol, a beta-AR blocker, greatly reduced the proliferative effect of TNF-alpha on C6 cells. The gene and protein expressions of both beta1- and beta2-ARs were enhanced in C6 cells after TNF-alpha treatment, and the increase in beta-AR was due to an increased number of binding sites and not due to increase in receptor affinity. We further showed that protein kinase C (PKC) was involved in the TNF-alpha-induced beta-AR expression.

Others have asked, If baroreflex mechanisms are functioning normally, how can arterial pressure be so variable? We reanalysed data from nine healthy young adult men and women and tested the hypotheses that during brief periods of observation, human baroreflex sensitivity fluctuates widely and rhythmically. We estimated vagal baroreflex sensitivity with systolic pressure and R-R interval cross-spectra measured over 15 s segments, moved by 2 s steps through 20-min periods of frequency- and tidal volume-controlled breathing. We studied each subject at the same time on three separate days, with fixed protocols that included two physiological states, supine and passive 40 deg upright tilt, before and after beta-adrenergic, cholinergic, and angiotensin converting enzyme blockade. Minimum, mean and maximum (+/-s.d.) supine control baroreflex sensitivities averaged 5 +/- 3, 18 +/- 6, and 55 +/- 22 ms mmHg(-1). In most subjects, moderate ongoing fluctuations of baroreflex sensitivity were punctuated by brief major peaks, yielding frequency distributions that were skewed positively. Fast Fourier transforms indicated that baroreflex sensitivity fluctuations (expressed as percentages of total power) concentrated more in very low, 0.003-0.04 Hz, than ultra low, 0.0-0.003 Hz, frequencies (77 +/- 7 versus 11 +/- 8%, P < or = 0.001, rank sum test). Autoregressive centre frequencies averaged 0.012 +/- 0.003 Hz. The periodicity of very low frequency baroreflex sensitivity fluctuations was not influenced significantly by upright tilt, or by variations of autonomic drive or angiotensin activity. Our analysis indicates that during ostensibly 'steady-state' conditions, human vagal baroreflex sensitivity fluctuates in a major way, at very low frequencies.", 
    "140": "We used a free-recall paradigm to establish a behavioral index of the retrograde and anterograde interference of emotion with episodic memory encoding. In two experiments involving 78 subjects, we show that negatively valenced items elicit retrograde amnesia, whereas positively valenced items elicit retrograde hypermnesia. These data indicate item valence is critical in determining retrograde amnesia and retrograde hypermnesia. In contrast, we show that item arousal induces an anterograde amnesic effect, consistent with the idea that a valence-evoked arousal mechanism compromises anterograde episodic encoding. Randomized double-blind administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol compared with the selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake-inhibitor reboxetine, and placebo, demonstrated that the magnitude of this emotional amnesia and hypermnesia can be upregulated and downregulated as a function of emotional arousal and central NE signaling. We conclude that a differential processing of emotional arousal and valence influences how the brain remembers and forgets.", 
    "141": "Coronary heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality in the United States, with 84 percent of persons 65 years or older dying from this disease. Secondary preventive measures, including lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy, are important for elderly patients because of the variable impacts on morbidity and mortality rates and quality of life. Participating in light to moderate activities significantly decreases mortality rates in elderly patients. Smoking cessation translates into a reduction in overall mortality and morbidity rates at least equal to that of other preventive measures such as aspirin or beta-blocker therapy. Recent studies on the effects of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to below 100 mg per dL have shown a substantial reduction in coronary heart disease mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction rates, with a persistent effect in patients older than 75 years. Hypertension, manifesting mostly as isolated systolic blood pressure elevation, also should be treated aggressively. Conventional medical therapies for hypertension (e.g., diuretics, beta blockers) and newer agents (e.g., calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), together with sodium restriction, have had a positive effect on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity rates in older patients. With the increasing prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, interventions targeting weight reduction and glucose control should be emphasized. Whereas weight-loss strategies are poorly defined in this population, the management of diabetes through dietary modification, exercise, and medications is similar across age groups. The target hemoglobin A1C level is less than 7 percent. Elderly patients are prone to depression and social isolation, and they are more likely to have a lower socioeconomic status than younger patients, which may negatively affect participation in rehabilitation programs and compliance with medical advice and therapy. Strategies aimed at these factors have shown variable results and remain ill-defined.", 
    "142": "Thorough and timely anesthesia preoperative evaluation is essential for good patient outcomes. Perioperative care is becoming more complex and comprehensive, while older and sicker patients are being considered for major thoracic surgery. In addition to pulmonary and wound care, prevention of cardiac complications with beta-blocker therapy, multimodal pain control, tighter glycemic control, nutritional support, and prevention of thromboembolism are important perioperative goals. Early identification of significant medical and nonmedical issues allows for complete evaluation and planning and decreases the likelihood of delays, cancellations, and complications. Good communication and preparation benefit everyone. The implementation of an anesthesia preoperative assessment program or clinic can help achieve these important goals.", 
    "143": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries where it predominantly affects elderly persons with a range of other comorbid conditions requiring polypharmacy.

Other osteoblast markers, procollagen type-I N-terminal propeptide and total alkaline phosphatase activity, were not significantly changed by propranolol. Urine free deoxypyridinoline declined by approximately 10% between 0 and 6 wk (P = 0.019) in the beta-blocker group and was stable thereafter. Serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen also showed a small decrease, but this was not significantly different between groups. Serum albumin concentrations decreased by more than 2 g/liter in the first 2 wk of propranolol treatment, remaining stable subsequently (P = 0.007). Serum creatinine tended to increase in the propranolol group (P = 0.06), as did weight. Bone densities in the lumbar spine and total proximal femur did not change significantly in either group.",

It also influences renal function and fluid balance, effects that might indirectly affect bone metabolism. Current evidence does not justify the use of beta-blockers for treatment of osteoporosis.", 
    "151": "We examined the effects of beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) agonists on monocyte-derived cytokines, interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-12 production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), as in vitro model of sepsis. The study found that beta2-AR agonists inhibited IL-18 and IL-12 production in monocytes, and that AR agonist activity was antagonized by the selective beta2-AR antagonist, butoxamine. The selective beta2-AR agonists salbutamol and terbutaline induced a similar inhibitory pattern of IL-18 and IL-12 production. IL-12 production induced by LPS was inhibited by anti-IL-18 Ab, but IL-18 production by LPS was not inhibited by anti-IL-12 Ab, showing that LPS induced IL-18 production without IL-12 production. Therefore, the stimulation of beta2-AR might be beneficial in the treatment of sepsis through inhibiting LPS-elicited IL-18.", 
    "152": "The aims of the present study were to investigate the vasoactive effects of luteolin and its mechanisms of action on the rat thoracic aorta. Luteolin (4.5-36 micromol/L) caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of endothelium-intact or endothelium-denuded aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine (PE, 10(-6) mol/L) or a high level of K+ (6 x 10(-2) mol/L). Luteolin induced a shift of the PE concentration-response curve to the right and downward. L-NAME and propranolol did not influence the vascular effect of luteolin. However, 5-hydroxydecanoate, tetraethylammonium, BaCl2 and 4-aminopyridine significantly attenuated the vasorelaxant effect of luteolin. In Ca2+ -free medium, medium with graded concentrations of Ca2+, or K+ -free solution, luteolin reduced PE-induced contraction. It is concluded that luteolin induces endothelium-independent relaxation in rat thoracic aorta. The mechanism involves the inhibition of sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels, release from intracellular Ca2+ stores and activation of K+ channels.", 
    "153": "A 10-year-old cat with the paresis of hind limbs was initially diagnosed as a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy followed by acute thromboembolism of caudal abdominal aorta from the findings of the medical examinations. However, this case was proved to be an chronic myocardial infarction due to arteriosclerosis of coronary arteries by the pathologic diagnosis. In the left ventricular, the hypertrophy and the narrowing were slight, and a coagulative infarction was seen obviously. The intramural coronary arteriosclerosis showed thickening of the wall due to medial hyperplasia by fibrosis, and arterial stenosis. Myocardial infarction and arteriosclerosis are scarcely any reports of these lesions in cats. This case is valuable for an extremely rare case of myocardial infarction in the cat.", 
    "154": "Differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and physiology contribute to the phenomenon that women and men frequently respond differently to cardiovascular drugs. Hormonal influences, in addition, can play an important role: for example, the menstrual cycle, menopause, and pregnancy--as a result of fluctuations in concentrations of sexual steroids, and of changes in total body water--can be associated with gender-specific differences in the plasma levels of cardiovascular drugs. Clinical relevance accordingly results, especially for substances with a narrow therapeutic margin. This review treats the most important pharmacodynamic gender-relevant differences in this context, and surveys available evidence on the benefits of therapy of chronic cardiovascular diseases in women. On the whole, the study situation for women is appreciably less favourable than for men: owing to the fact that women are under-represented in most studies, and that few gender-specific analyses have been conducted.",

STUDY SELECTION AND OUTCOMES: We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated beta blocker treatment in patients having non-cardiac surgery. Perioperative outcomes within 30 days of surgery included total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal cardiac arrest, non-fatal stroke, congestive heart failure, hypotension needing treatment, bradycardia needing treatment, and bronchospasm.", 
    "158": "Twenty two trials that randomised a total of 2437 patients met the eligibility criteria. Perioperative beta blockers did not show any statistically significant beneficial effects on any of the individual outcomes and the only nominally statistically significant beneficial relative risk was 0.44 (95% confidence interval 0.20 to 0.97, 99% confidence interval 0.16 to 1.24) for the composite outcome of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal cardiac arrest. Methods adapted from formal interim monitoring boundaries applied to cumulative meta-analysis showed that the evidence failed, by a considerable degree, to meet standards for forgoing additional studies. The individual safety outcomes in patients treated with perioperative beta blockers showed a relative risk for bradycardia needing treatment of 2.27 (95% CI 1.53 to 3.36, 99% CI 1.36 to 3.80) and a nominally statistically significant relative risk for hypotension needing treatment of 1.27 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.56, 99% CI 0.97 to 1.66).",

    "160": "Our previous work has showed that lymphocytes can synthesize catecholamines (CAs). However, role and mechanism of the endogenous CAs in lymphocytes in modulation of immune function are less known. In the present study, we used alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MT), an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and pargyline, an inhibitor of monoamine oxydase, to block the synthesis and degradation of CAs in lymphocytes and then observed changes of lymphocyte proliferation induced by concanavalin A (Con A). Phentolamine and propranolol, antagonists respectively to alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors, were employed to investigate the receptor mechanism. We found that TH mRNA in the Con A-activated lymphocytes was 2.4 times higher in relative density than that in the resting lymphocytes. Similarly, the intracellular and supernatant CAs, including DA, NE and E, of the Con A-stimulated lymphocytes were significantly raised relative to those of the resting cells. alpha-MT (10(-11), 10(-10) and 10(-9) M) facilitated the Con A-induced lymphocyte proliferation, but pargyline (10(-11), 10(-10) and 10(-9) M) attenuated the cell proliferation. Meanwhile, alpha-MT and pargyline respectively led to decrease and increase in the intracellular and supernatant CAs (DA, NE and E) of the Con A-stimulated lymphocytes. Propranolol completely blocked, but phentolamine partly reversed, the suppressive effect of pargyline on the Con A-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Content of cAMP was remarkably increased in the lymphocytes treated with pargyline alone, but it dropped to control level after these cells were treated with propranolol plus pargyline. These results on the one hand further demonstrate the ability of lymphocytes to synthesize CAs and the enhancive ability of the activated lymphocytes to synthesize CAs, and on the other hand reveal an important role of the endogenous CAs in regulation of function of lymphocytes themselves. Besides, our present findings suggest that CAs synthesized by lymphocytes can secrete out of the lymphocytes via paracrine or autocrine pathway and affect lymphocyte function by beta-adrenoreceptor and cAMP mediating mechanism. Thus, it can be implied that CAs in lymphocytes are also involved in the cross-talk in the neuro-endocrine-immune networks.", 
    "161": "In order to further characterize the actions of cocaine on synaptic activity in the hippocampus, recordings of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice preparation were used to monitor drug effects on long-term potentiation (LTP) evoked in response to stimulation of the Schaffer collateral pathway. Cocaine had dose-dependent, biphasic effects on the magnitude of LTP at these excitatory synapses in the stratum radiatum ranging from a significant enhancement of LTP at intermediate drug concentrations (5-10 microM), to an inhibition of LTP at a relatively high drug concentration (30 microM). The local anesthetic lidocaine had only inhibitory effects on the induction of LTP at all concentrations examined (10-75 microM), whereas the monoamine transporter antagonists, WIN 35348 (1 microM) or GBR 12935 (5 microM) significantly enhanced the magnitude of LTP. The D(2)-like dopamine receptor antagonist, eticlopride was effective in preventing this action of cocaine, whereas pretreatment with the D(1/5) antagonist, SCH 23390 was ineffective. These results suggest that endogenously released dopamine, in the presence of cocaine (5-10 microM), can act via D(2)-like receptors to significantly increase the magnitude of LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.", 
    "162": "A sensitive and efficient method was developed for the determination of carvedilol and its metabolites in human urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Urine samples were hydrolyzed with beta-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase (from Helix pomatia) and the target compounds were extracted with liquid-liquid extraction. The extracts were completely derivatized with MSTFA and MBTFA and analyzed by GC-MS using an Ultra-2 column. The linearity of the assay ranges were 0.75-75 ngmL(-1) for carvedilol and o-desmethyl carvedilol (o-DMC), and 3.0-75 ngmL(-1) for 4-hydroxyphenyl carvedilol (4-HPC) and 5-hydroxyphenyl carvedilol (5-HPC). The absolute recovery of carvedilol and its metabolites added to a blank urine sample was 80.1-97.8%. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) of carvedilol and o-DMC were 0.30 and 0.75 ngmL(-1), and its of 4-HPC and 5-HPC were 0.75 and 3.0 ngmL(-1), respectively. The reproducibilities were 1.86-11.5% for the intra-day assay, and 0.70-1.71% for the inter-day assay precision and the degree of inaccuracy was -3.0 to 3.9% at the concentration of 75 ngmL(-1). The proposed GC-MS method was effective for the determination of carvedilol and its three metabolites in human urine.",

Within the group of 5-HT(1B/D)-agonists (triptans), seven substances with 23 dosages and formulations have been approved in Germany that allow the customized treatment of migraine attacks. In addition, several new drugs such as valproic acid or topiramate are now available as drugs of first choice for migraine prevention, as well as the well established beta blockers, thus enabling the physician to tailor the preventative treatment according to the individual needs of the patient.", 
    "164": "Modification of cardiovascular risk factors can reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), effectively extend survival, decrease the need for interventional procedures, and improve quality of life in persons with known cardiovascular disease. Pharmacological treatments and important lifestyle changes reduce people's risks substantially (by 1/3 to 2/3) and can slow and perhaps reverse progression of established coronary disease. When used appropriately, these interventions are more cost-effective than many other treatments, currently provided by the National Health Service [Department of Health National Service Frameworks: coronary heart disease. Preventing coronary heart disease in high risk patients. 2000. HMSO.] Secondary prevention clinics are effective means by which to ensure targets are achieved and assist primary care in long-term maintenance of lifestyle change and drug optimisation. A 2-year hospital-based pilot project was established at the Royal Hospitals, April 2001-April 2003. The aim of the project was to target patients with coronary heart disease, post-MI and/or coronary artery bypass grafting and/or percutaneous coronary intervention, 6 months following their cardiac event. The plan was to assess patient risk factors and medication a minimum of 6 months following their cardiac event to ascertain if government targets were being achieved; secondly, to examine the effectiveness of a hospital-based nurse-led secondary prevention clinic on modifying risk factors and optimising drug therapies.", 
    "165": "The sorption and mobility of six pharmaceuticals were investigated in two soil types with different organic carbon and clay content, and in bacterial biomass (aerobic and anaerobic). The pharmaceuticals examined were carbamazepine, propranolol, diclofenac sodium, clofibric acid, sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin. The sorption experiments were performed according to the OECD test Guideline 106. The distribution coefficients determined by this batch equilibrium method varied with the pharmaceutical tested and the solid matrix type. Ofloxacin was particularly strongly adsorbed (except of the case of using anaerobic biomass for the solid matrix) while clofibric acid was found to be weakly adsorbed. The fate of pharmaceuticals in soil was also assessed using lysimeters. Important parameters that were studied were: the pharmaceutical loading rate and the hydraulic loading rate for adsorption and the rate and duration of a \"rain\" event for desorption. Major differences in the mobility of the six pharmaceuticals were observed and correlated with the adsorption/desorption properties of the compounds.", 
    "166": "Beta-blockade efficiency and safety in anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy (AIC) are poorly documented. Cardiac Heart Failure (CHF) due to an AIC has haemodynamic and histologic particularities: only mild ventricular dilatation, restriction pattern and myocardial and endocardial fibrous thickening. Therefore, beta blockade therapy initiation may cause heart failure decompensation by absence of the usual left ventricular adaptation (improvement of left ventricular compliance allowing maintenance of stroke volume). We describe an AIC patient in whom a first beta-blockade initial administration caused a global cardiac failure; after stabilisation, one month later, a second attempt caused a new cardiac failure. We raise the question of beta-blockade safety in restrictive cardiomyopathies.", 
    "167": "Enhancing the release of acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain is one approach to increasing neuronal activity, restoring central cholinergic tone and improving attention and cognition. ACh release is modulated by both ligand-gated (gamma-amino butyric acid A receptors/benzodiazepine [GABA(A)/BDZ], nicotinic-acetylcholine and serotonin, 5-HT3) and voltage-gated (calcium and potassium) ion channels. Of the ligand-gated channel modulators, the BDZ receptor (BDZR) inverse agonists (beta-CCM, ZK 93426) enhance activity-dependent release in animals, whereas S-8510, a partial inverse agonist, and the BDZR antagonist, flumazenil, show enhancement regardless of the behavioural state of the animal. Some of these agents have undergone limited clinical evaluation for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (ZK 93426, flumazenil, S-8510), but their potential anxiogenic liability makes their therapeutic use uncertain until more clinical data are available. Within the group of nicotinic agonists, ABT-418, though less potent than nicotine and epibatidine in promoting ACh release in vitro, was clinically evaluated based on its in vivo profile. Its lack of oral bioavailability has limited its acceptability, though transdermal administration has been used to circumvent this deficiency. Serotonin 5-HT3 receptor modulators have not been advanced for clinical evaluation for the treatment of AD. Among the voltage-gated ion channel modulators affecting L- or N-type calcium channels, nefiracetam, a nootropic agent, also increased ACh release in animal studies. It is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for AD, though a need for more potent and brain selective calcium channel blockers exists. Potassium channel modulators have been the most studied ACh release enhancing agents and several of these compounds (4-AP, 3,4-DAP, linopirdine) have been clinically evaluated. In AD patients, 4-AP, an A-type K+ channel blocker, elicited inconsistent and unremarkable effects. Linopirdine, whose enhancement of ACh release correlates with its ability to block M-type K+ channels, also produced disappointing clinical results, which may have been related to its suboptimal pharmacokinetic profile. Further work in this series has provided a compound (DMP 543) that should be a more reliable indicator of whether a blocker of this ion channel can activate the cholinergic system in man. This agent is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for AD.", 
    "168": "Valsartan is the second orally-active, non-peptide angiotensin II receptor blocker to reach the market in Europe and the USA for the treatment of hypertension. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that this blocker is specific for the AT(1) receptor and has no affinity for the angiotensin II AT(2) receptor. Experimentally, valsartan dose-dependently inhibits the vasoconstriction induced by angiotensin II and lowers blood pressure in renin-dependent models of hypertension. Pharmacologically, oral valsartan is characterised by a low bioavailability but a rapid absorption and distribution with a half-life in keeping with once-daily administration. Thus, after oral administration, the maximal plasma concentration is reached 2 h after dosing and the elimination half-life is about 6 h. Clinically, several dose-finding and comparative studies have demonstrated that valsartan is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Valsartan has also been shown to be effective in severe hypertension. Valsartan is at least as effective as ACE inhibitors, diuretics, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. However, none of the side-effects observed with these latter agents, including cough and lower limb oedema, has been observed with the administration of valsartan. Three large clinical trials are now underway to demonstrate whether valsartan can reduce morbidity and mortality: one in hypertensives with a high cardiovascular risk profile (VALUE), one in patients with heart failure previously treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (VAL-HeFT) and one in post-myocardial infarct patients (VALIANT). These studies will further define the place of valsartan beyond the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "169": "Cardiovascular complications are the major cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing major vascular surgery. This is related to the frequent presence of an underlying coronary artery disease. This paper reviews the pathology of perioperative cardiac complications and cardiac risk assessment and risk reduction strategies. Guidelines of the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association for the evaluation of cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery may provide the necessary framework for the assessment and management of patients undergoing major vascular surgery. Based on the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines and data from contemporary studies, patients without risk factors are considered to be at low risk and do not require additional evaluations for coronary artery disease. Patients with 1 or 2 cardiac risk factors represent an intermediate-risk group for perioperative cardiac complications. If beta-blockers are prescribed, the probability of cardiac complications is low and there is no need for further noninvasive testing. Patients with 3 or more risk factors are at high risk for cardiac complications and the use of noninvasive testing may help further refine cardiac risk based on the presence and absence of test-induced myocardial ischemia. beta-Blockers should be prescribed to all patients, and coronary revascularization should be reserved for high-risk patients who have a clearly defined need for revascularization independent of the need for major vascular surgery.",

In all patients the presence of esophageal varices was confirmed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasonography and Doppler ultrasonography of the portal vein was performed. The patients were monitored for: the velocity of blood flow in the portal vein, the cross sectional area of the portal vein and the portal vein congestion index. Data analysis used t-Student test, Pearson and Spearman correlation. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant.",

    "174": "beta 2 -Adrenergic receptor agonists can reduce the release of GM-CSF by human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). These effects are considered anti-inflammatory and are ascribed to the activity of the (R)-enantiomer within the racemate of the agonist. However, the effect of the (S)-enantiomer on GM-CSF release, once thought to be inert, has not been extensively explored. Objective We hypothesized that the (S)-enantiomer may counter the effects of the (R)-enantiomer, potentially increasing GM-CSF release. Therefore, the effects of administration of individual and combined enantiomers on GM-CSF release were examined.",

In contrast, (S)-enantiomers significantly increased GM-CSF release by as much as 34% ( P < .05) over release with no drug, and by 25% to 40% ( P < .05) when added with (R)-enantiomers. The decremental effect of dexamethasone was amplified by (R)-enantiomers but inhibited by (S)-enantiomers. Both propranolol and ICI-118,551 alone increased GM-CSF release in a concentration-dependent fashion, similar to (S)-enantiomers.", 
    "177": "We conclude that GM-CSF release by HASMC is downregulated by (R)-enantiomers and enhanced by (S)-enantiomers.

During this time, there were 325 patient contacts (median 8.5 per patient), including 247 calls (median 7 per patient) and 78 clinic visits (median 2 per patient). Brigham and Women's Hospital clinicians adjusted diuretics a total of 109 times (median 2.5 times per patient). When frequency of diuretic adjustments was used to estimate the intensity of care, higher values of blood urea nitrogen at discharge predicted an increased intensity of care during the 90-day follow-up (relative risk [RR] 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.3, P = .02). When frequency of clinic visits, telephone calls, and diuretic adjustments were used to estimate intensity of care, discharge creatinine (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.06, P = .05), discharge blood urea nitrogen (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.23, P = .004), and length of stay (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.13, P = .04) were predictors of the composite end point.",
