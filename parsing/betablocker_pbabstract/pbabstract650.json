    "0": "Epinephrine caused a dose-related release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from the isolated perfused working rat heart. Thus, epinephrine, at 10(-8) M, did not increase release of LDH, but at 10(-6) M, it gave a peak release of 712 +/- 48 mU/g fresh wt. per min (N = 41) 10 min after addition (control: 17 +/- 2 mU/g per min, N = 36). The effects of 10(-7) M epinephrine (peak release: 159 +/- 28 mU/g per min, N = 29) were mimicked by theophylline, 10(-3) M. Increased release of LDH was also achieved by dibutyryl cAMP, 5 X 10(-4) M (399 +/- 67 mU/g per min, N = 6), but not by cAMP, 5 X 10(-4) M. Increased tissue cAMP could be related to the extent of enzyme loss induced by epinephrine or by theophylline. Both tissue cAMP and LDH decreased when propranolol, 10(-5) M, was added to epinephrine 10(-6) M. Epinephrine-induced enzyme loss was also decreased by halving the perfusate Ca2+ or doubling the perfusate Mg2+ or by verapamil, 2 X 10(-7) M, thereby showing a role for Ca2+ entry. However, there was no evidence for excess excitation-coupling with major ATP depletion. Although decreased efficiency of pressure work (\"oxygen wastage\") was a graded phenomenon, it was apparent even with epinephrine, 10(-8) M. As the epinephrine concentration rose, so did heart rate, coronary flow, oxygen uptake, the degree of \"oxygen wastage,\" the level of tissue cAMP, and the extent of enzyme release. At 10(-7) M epinephrine, the efficiency of pressure work was only 68% of control, but there was no depletion of high-energy phosphate compounds despite marked enzyme loss. Rather, there was a small loss of ATP only at the highest epinephrine concentration (10(-6) M) with an increase of phosphocreatine, suggesting that intracellular transfer of energy was impaired. Epinephrine-induced enzyme release and \"oxygen wastage\" could occur at concentrations below 10(-6) M which did not cause detectable depletion of the tissue content of ATP.", 
    "1": "Lanthanum of 0.1 to 0.2 mM caused a twitch inhibition and further showed a marked, long-lasting twitch potentiation during washout in both ventricular strips of bullfrog and atrial or papillary muscles of guinea-pig. It was found that the effect was more conspicuous in the frog heart. A similar potentiation was observed by applying gadolinium instead of lanthanum. The participation of endogeneous catecholamine release is unlikely since the positive inotropic effect was never affected by the presence of beta-adrenergic blocker. The potentiation was not accompanied by any increase in the action potential plateau, suggesting independence of the phenomenon on the calcium current. A marked elevation of the resting tension was produced during a long-term lanthanum perfusion, reflecting the increase in the intracellular calcium level. On the other hand, transient increase in the resting tension was frequently observed on returning to normal Ringer solution. The latter change seemed to result from a transient increase in the resting permeability to calcium ions. The negative or positive inotropic effect by increasing or lowering the external sodium concentration observed under the control condition was strongly depressed during the twitch potentiation. In addition, sodium-free contracture induced by solutions isotonically replaced with sucrose or potassium chloride was augmented both during lanthanum perfusion and during its washout. These results suggest the possibility that the elevation of the intracellular calcium level due to inhibition of Na-Ca exchange mechanism and/or increase in the calcium permeability is the principal cause for the twitch potentiation caused by lanthanum washout.", 
    "2": "Investigation of binding properties of (+), (-) and (+/-) 125Iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) to beta 1-adrenoceptors of guinea pig left ventricle membranes revealed that these radioligands bind to receptors in a high and low affinity state which is not influenced by guanylnucleotides. The contribution of the (+)enantiomer to the binding of the racemic ligand at low receptor concentrations can be neglected since the dissociation time courses of (+/-) and (-) ICYP are identical. The existence of two affinity states of beta-adrenoceptors interacting with the antagonist ICYP was evident from 1: biphasic dissociation kinetics and 2: from curvilinear Scatchard plots.", 
    "3": "Regulation of human beta 2-adrenergic receptors in lymphocytes (determined by (+/-)-125iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding) and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in platelets (determined by 3H-yohimbine binding) was studied. While beta 2-adrenergic receptor number did not change with age, a significant negative correlation between the number of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and age was found; plasma catecholamines, on the contrary, were elevated in the elderly. In healthy women during normal menstrual cycle the number of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors decreased with increasing plasma estradiol levels. Incubation of lymphocyte membranes with isoprenaline (100 microM) and of platelet membranes with clonidine (1-100 microM) led to a reduction of the number of beta 2- and alpha 2-receptors, respectively, without changes in the KD-values. Treatment of hypertensive patients with clonidine (3x150 micrograms/die) for 7 days reduced the number of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in platelets. In platelet membranes from such treated patients inhibition of 3H-yohimbine binding by clonidine and adrenaline was not affected by 10(-4)M GTP. It is concluded, that human alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors undergo regulatory mechanisms similar to those recently described for adrenergic receptors in a variety of animal models.", 
    "4": "Carteolol, 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy)propoxy-3, 4-dihydrocarbostyril hydrochloride was found to be a beta-adrenergic partial agonist in the taenia caecum of guinea pig. Concentration response curves of carteolol and isoprenaline were parallelly shifted by propranolol (10(-7) M) suggesting that site of action of both the drugs was the same beta-adrenoceptor. The pD2-values of carteolol obtained from the concentration action curves in mechanical response and increase of tissue concentration of cyclic AMP were significantly different from its pA2-value against isoprenaline and its pKi-value (negative log of its apparent dissociation constant). A possible explanation of our observation would seem to be as follows. Carteolol and isopranaline interact with the same beta-adrenoceptor where there may be two different sites: a binding site for agonist and binding site for antagonist.", 
    "5": "Cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels in six lines of rat ascites hepatoma cells were determined after the treatment with isoproterenol. The maximum increase of cyclic AMP levels was induced by the treatment with 10(-7) M of isoproterenol in each cell line, though the difference was observed at the time to reach the maximum levels. Following the treatment with 10(-7) M of isoproterenol, cyclic AMP levels increased by 55 to 80% of control in AH-44, AH-130 and AH-7974 cells, by 25 to 45% in AH-41C and AH-109A cells, and slightly in AH-13 cells. The combined cytotoxic effect of isoproterenol and mitomycin C was studied using AH-13, AH-44 and AH-130 cells. The cytotoxicity of mitomycin C on AH-44 and AH-130 cells was potentiated by the pretreatment with 10(-7) M of isoproterenol that was not cytotoxic by itself, but such a potentiation was not observed in AH-13 cells. The cyclic AMP levels were examined in the cells after the combined treatment. Mitomycin C by itself hardly affected the levels in three cell lines. In AH-44 and AH-130 cells, however, the period of the high levels of cyclic AMP was longer in the combined treatment than in the treatment with isoproterenol alone. On the other hand, the cyclic AMP level in AH-13 cells was hardly affected by each agent or the combined treatment. These results suggest that the combination effect of isoproterenol and mitomycin C is closely related to the increase of cyclic AMP in the cells treated with isoproterenol.", 
    "6": "An insulin-dependent diabetic presenting with thirst, polyuria and weight loss was noted to be hypertensive and shown subsequently to have a right adrenal phaeochromocytoma. Pre-operative control of both diabetes and hypertension was achieved with propranolol and phenoxybenzamine, but not with propranolol alone. Full recovery with restoration of normal glucose tolerance and blood pressure followed successful surgery. Analysis of this patient's response to medical therapy provides further evidence that alpha 2 receptors inhibit insulin release in man. Since as many as one-third of phaeochromocytomas are not detected during life, this diagnosis should be considered as an uncommon cause of carbohydrate intolerance in patients with diabetes mellitus, especially if accompanied by continuous or paroxysmal hypertension.", 
    "7": "Trapidil, a coronary vasodilator and positive inotropic agent, was tested for its ability to affect the normal \"fast\" action potentials and the \"slow\" action potentials and contractions of isolated perfused chick hearts, and to affect the tissue cyclic AMP level. At 5 X 10(-3) M, trapidil completely blocked the fast Na+ channels in hearts perfused with normal Tyrode solution, since this dose abolished the action potential when verapamil (2 X 10(-6) M) was present to eliminate the inward slow current. To study effects on the slow channels, the fast Na+ channels were voltage-inactivated by partial depolarization to about -40 mV with an elevated (25 mM) K+-Tyrode solution, resulting in loss of excitability. At low concentrations (1 X 10(-4) - 1 X 10(-3) M), trapidil induced slow action potentials accompanied by contractions, even in the presence of a beta-adrenergic blocker. In contrast, at high concentrations (3 X 10(-3) - 1 X 10(-2) M), trapidil markedly depressed or blocked the isoproterenol-induced slow action potentials. Consistent with this dual action, in hearts perfused with normal Tyrode solution, trapidil exerted a small positive inotropic action at low doses and a considerable negative inotropic action at high doses, even though the intracellular cyclic AMP level was substantially elevated. That is, trapidil has actions similar to those of papaverine. It is concluded that trapidil blocks both fast Na+ channels and slow channels in cardiac muscle, the fast Na+ channels being more sensitive, and that low concentrations of trapidil induce slow channels by elevating the cyclic AMP level because of phosphodiesterase inhibition.", 
    "8": "Ahlquist described the existence of beta-adrenoceptors as structures mediating the positive effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation in the heart. Recently, the role of alpha-adrenoceptors has also been investigated by both biological and radioligand binding studies. The presence of alpha-adrenoceptors has now been demonstrated in the hearts of various mammalian species including man. Stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors causes positive ino-, chrono-, dromo- and bathmotropic effects while that of alpha-adrenoceptors is restricted to positive inotropic effects. Analysis of the effects mediated by alpha-stimulation as carried out in our department showed a clear-cut difference between the mechanisms underlying stimulation of beta- and of alpha-adrenoceptors: that evoked by beta-adrenoceptors is connected to an increase in cAMP, whereas that by alpha-adrenoceptors is not. Moreover, the effect of alpha-stimulation is evidently more dependent on heart rate and on the presence of Ca2+ than that of beta-stimulation. The nature of cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors is apparently distinct from that of other organs as they are stimulated by dopamine and adrenaline but not by the transmitter noradrenaline. Since the alpha-receptor-mediated increase in force of contraction is obviously less energy consuming than that via beta-receptors the heart gains a greater adaptability in adrenergic regulation especially in emergency situations such as myocardial infarction.", 
    "9": "1. Right ventricular hypertrophy was produced in dogs by banding of the pulmonary artery for 28 days (n = 7) and results were compared with those in sham-operated dogs (n = 5). 2. Myocardial noradrenaline and adrenaline levels were depressed in both the hypertrophied right ventricle and the non-hypertrophied left ventricle and plasma levels were increased compared to the control dogs. 3. Myocardial beta-adrenoceptors were assessed in membrane preparations of both ventricles by 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding. No change in binding site concentration (pmol/mg membrane protein) or in binding affinity was found in either the hypertrophied right ventricle or in the left ventricle. 4. Divergent results of studies on beta-adrenoceptors in ventricular hypertrophy are difficult to reconcile.", 
    "10": "The affinities of a number of alpha- and beta-adrenergic binding sites and muscarinic cholinergic binding sites in rabbit urethra and bladder have been determined, using specific radioligand receptor binding assays. There was a greater density of beta-binding sites than alpha-binding sites in the bladder, while, in the urethra, there was a greater density of alpha-binding sites than beta-binding sites. The number of alpha-binding sites was fourfold greater in the urethra, whereas there were fewer beta-binding sites in the urethra. There were fewer muscarinic binding sites in the urethra than in the bladder. The dissociation constant for [3H]dihydroalprenolol at the beta-binding site was 6.4 nM, for [3H]dihydroergocryptine at the alpha-binding site was 2.11 nM, and for 3H-labelled l-quinuclidinyl benzilate at the muscarinic binding site was 0.22 nM.", 
    "11": "Several agents are known that can elevate cyclic AMP levels in lymphoid cells, e.g. isoproterenol, PGE1 and adenosine. We have studied the cyclic AMP increasing effect of these agents on thymocytes from mouse and man and on human peripheral T lymphocytes. In contrast to mouse thymocytes and human peripheral T lymphocytes, human thymocytes appeared to be insensitive to isoproterenol, but did respond to PGE1 and adenosine. Furthermore, the density of beta-adrenergic receptors on the cells was determined by measuring the specific binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol. A correlation was found between the receptor density on the cells and the rise in intracellular cyclic AMP induced by isoproterenol: human thymocytes appeared to have very few beta-adrenergic receptors, in contrast to thymocytes from mouse or to T lymphocytes from human blood. We conclude that the development of beta-adrenergic receptors in T cell ontogeny is different for mice and human beings. Comparison of animal models with the situation in man should be made with caution.", 
    "12": "We studied, with microelectrodes, the effect of lidocaine and 1-verapamil on the upstroke phase of action potentials and conduction velocity in incompletely depolarized ventricular papillary muscle (resting potential, -58 +/- 1 mV) perfused in a high K+ (16.7 mM) Tyrode's solution. The action potential upstroke had a slur and the maximum rate of rise (Vmax) consisted of 2 components: the first large (32 +/- 7 V/sec; Vmax,fast) and the second small (10 +/- 2 V/sec, Vmax,slow). The conduction velocity was slow and ranged about 30-35 cm/sec. Isoproterenol and noradrenaline increased Vmax,slow and decreased Vmax,fast, in a concentration dependent manner (10(-8) - 10(-5)M). These effects were abolished by following application of a beta-blocker, pindolol (1 microgram/ml). Thus, the dominant ionic channel responsible for the slow conduction seemed to alter from the depressed fast channel to the slow channel as the catecholamine concentration was increased. In the absence of isoproterenol, lidocaine (2 micrograms/ml) depressed Vmax with a resultant decrease of conduction velocity to 16.4 +/- 4.2 cm/sec and which was followed by a conduction block, while 1-verapamil was without effect. In the presence of isoproterenol (5 x 10(-7) M), 1-verapamil (1 microgram/ml) depressed the Vmax and decreased the conduction velocity to 16.9 +/- 4.2 cm/sec, just before development of the conduction block, while lidocaine was without effect. These results suggest that the dominant ionic channel responsible for the slow conduction in high K media (16.7 mM), can be readily altered by changes in extracellular catecholamine concentrations and that the slowest possible conduction velocity was approximately the same (about 16 cm/sec) between the depressed fast channel-dependent and the slow channel-dependent conductions. Clinical implications of these findings were discussed.", 
    "13": "The effects of strophathin in a dose of 0.15 mg/kg bw were investigated under alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade by the methods of thermodilution and circulation registration in the pool of the occluded coronary artery in anesthetized dogs. It was determined that strophanthin increased the blood supply of the myocardial ischemic centres, the minute heart volume, and systemic arterial pressure and decreased the general peripheral vascular resistance. The alpha-adrenoblocker, phentolamine (0.025 mg/kg intravenously) decreased the strophanthin stimulant effect on the collateral coronary blood stream and heart activity without changing its chronotropic and vasopressive action. The beta-adrenoreceptor blockade induced by obsidan (0.5 mg/kg) made no changes in the pattern of the glycoside cardiovascular effects and diminished its chronotropic action.", 
    "14": "To elucidate the role of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) in stress-induced prolactin (Prl) release, adult male rats which had received monosodium glutamate (MSG 4 mg/g) on alternate days for the first 10 days of life were subjected to ether stress for 2 min. Blood samples were drawn at 0, 15, 30 and 60 min after etherization through an indwelling jugular catheter implanted 1 day before the experiment. Sixty minutes after etherization the dopamine receptor blocker spiroperidol (0.1 mg/kg) was injected intravenously and another blood sample was withdrawn 60 min later. Although there were no differences in basal levels of plasma Prl between control and MSG-treated animals, a dramatic elevation of plasma Prl was observed in control rats 15 min after etherization, whereas no significant change was seen in MSG-treated animals. Spiroperidol significantly increased plasma Prl in both groups of animals, but the magnitude of the increase in Prl levels of MSG-treated rats was roughly one-third (p less than 0.005) that of control animals. When morphine (3 mg/kg) was injected to test its capability to stimulate Prl release in MSG-treated rats, significant increases of similar magnitude of plasma Prl were observed in both groups. These results show that (1) the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic system is functioning in MSG-treated rats to maintain Prl at low levels, (2) the stimulatory effect of morphine on Prl release is intact in MSG-treated rats, and (3) the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic system is not responsible for stress-induced Prl release, but rather another mechanism located within the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and highly sensitive to destruction by MSG mediates stress-induced Prl release.", 
    "15": "The radioligands [3H]-dihydroergocryptine and [3H]-dihydroalprenolol were used to characterise alpha- and beta-adrenergic binding sites, respectively, in membrane fractions of sheep cerebral cortex. In terms of affinity, density and specificity these sites possess properties similar to those previously characterised in rat brain. Further, in preliminary studies, these sites also appear to be responsive to treatment with estradiol/progesterone as well as to photoperiod. Thus, estrogen treatment can elevate both alpha- and beta-adrenergic binding sites in cortical tissue of sheep kept in natural light. In contrast, artificial light either has no effect or inhibits binding in response to estrogen.", 
    "16": "Studies of regression of myocardial hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) suggest that the adrenergic system may play an important role in the reversal of hypertrophy. The effect of propranolol on reversal of hypertrophy, however, is still controversial. This study describes the effect of propranolol, given alone or in combination with hydralazine in different ratios for 4 wk, on blood pressure (BP), ventricular weight, and myocardial catecholamine (MC) concentrations. The data show that a certain ratio of propranolol to hydralazine (750:30) leads to moderate BP control (196-156 mmHg) without increased MC (634 vs. 552 ng/g) and moderately reduced hypertrophy. Reduction of BP alone with increased MC (hydralazine alone) or reduction of MC without BP control (propranolol alone) failed to reduce hypertrophy. A significant correlation between both ventricular weight and heart rate with MC (r = 0.6) was obtained by multiple regression analysis. This study suggests that adrenergic factors seem to play an important role in modulating structural cardiac response to variations in arterial pressure.", 
    "17": "The mechanism responsible for the depressive myocardial effects of severe respiratory acidosis is unclear; however, sympathetic stimulation and catecholamines are known to be involved. The influence of beta-adrenergic receptor activity on the myocardial response to severe respiratory acidosis was studied in 18 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs. Arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) was raised by increasing the inspired CO2 fraction in O2. In control animals, as PaCO2 increased, heart rate (HR) decreased (PaCO2 approximately 110 mmHg), then returned to control (PaCO2 approximately 220 mmHg), whereas arterial blood pressure (Pa) and cardiac output (Q) remained unchanged from prehypercapnia levels. At PaCO2 greater than 350 mmHg, Pa, HR, and Q decreased and left ventricular function (LVF) curves were depressed. Death occurred at a PaCO2 of 404 +/- 25 mmHg (pH 6.48 +/- 0.02). In a second group of animals, administration of isoproterenol during the increase in PaCO2 did not result in depression of myocardial function, and death did not occur even at a significantly higher PaCO2 (PaCO2 496 +/- 12 mmHg; pH 6.39 +/- 0.02) than in the control group. Administration of propranolol to a third group of animals as PaCO2 increased did not change Pa, HR, and Q; however, LVF curves indicated a more rapid and severe depression of myocardial performance than in control, and death occurred at a significantly lower PaCO2 (PaCO2 220 +/- 25 mmHg; pH 6.65 +/- 0.02). We conclude that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation can prevent hypercapnic heart failure and that beta-adrenergic receptor activity is involved in the mechanism responsible for this failure.", 
    "18": "The ontogeny, circadian rhythm and sex differences of adrenergic receptors were studied in a crude particulate fraction prepared from rat lung. The density of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors ([3H]yohimbine binding sites) decreased rapidly with age from 304 fmol/mg of protein on the 1st day to 123 fmol/mg after the 1st week and then to an undetectable level at 5 weeks of age. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors ([3H]prazosin binding) showed a moderate variation in density, with the greatest density at the 3rd week of age (311 fmol/mg). The density at birth (194 fmol/mg) was higher than the adult (126 fmol/mg). Beta adrenergic receptors ([3H]dihydroalprenolol binding) demonstrated changes in density with a sharp rise in the 3rd week (to 813 fmol/mg from 315 fmol/mg at birth), which was maintained through the 10th week. Unlike receptor densities, the affinity constants were not significantly altered during postnatal development. Alpha-1 and beta receptors in the adult rat lung did not show any significant changes in their densities or their affinities in the two other physiological variables studied (circadian rhythm and sex). During postnatal development, the highest concentration of norepinephrine in the rat lung is reported to be at about 3 weeks of age, which correlates with the changes in both alpha-1 and beta adrenergic receptors, but not alpha-2 receptors. The presence of alpha-2 receptors in the lungs of young, but not mature animals, may suggest an important developmental role, which is not yet understood.", 
    "19": "Modifications in characteristics of the beta-adrenoceptor-cAMP system were observed in leucocytes from 10 patients in the hyperthyroid state after antithyroid treatment. These include 1) an increased number of beta-adrenoceptors without a change in their affinity, 2) an increased magnitude of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by isoprenaline, without a change in the NaF-stimulated enzyme activity, 3) an increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity ratio, and 4) an increased activity of cAMP-phosphodiesterase. Moreover, the plasma cAMP levels were markedly elevated during the hyperthyroid state. It is suggested that the above changes may in part constitute the molecular basis for the reputed catecholamine supersensitivity in the hyperthyroid state.", 
    "20": "In connection with the elucidation of the mechanisms of the acute and chronic haemodynamic stress during cardiac overloading, as well as in investigations on the role of neurotransmitter systems in the genesis of myocardial hypertrophy (MH), we carried out a complex of studies involving modelling of MH induced by treatment of rats with isoprenaline (ISO.) and of rabbits with thyreotom (Tri-iodothyronin +L-Thyroxin). With a view to studying some pathogenetic factors participating in the characteristics of the reproduced pathological states, combinations with oxprenolol, atropine, phentolamine (Phent.) and amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA), which is a GABA-inhibitor, were also applied. The results of the ECG studies performed are the main object of the present article. Marked MH was found in rats injected for 12 days with Iso. in doses of 2 mg/kg, as well as in rabbits which received thyreotom (accompanied with development of arterial hypertension). Considerable functional and morphological damage (with subendocardial fibrous proliferations) were discovered in rats treated with Iso. +Phent. The combinations of oxprenolol and AOAA manifested a protective effect to rabbits with thyrotoxic disturbances. Evident is also the essential role played by the adrenergic mechanisms in MH pathogenesis.", 
    "21": "Forearm blood flow was measured four times per minute by venous occlusion plethysmography during rest and during a brief emotionally stressful mental task. During emotional stress not only was the mean forearm blood flow increased, but the single blood flow values fluctuated more than at rest. The greater fluctuation, expressed statistically as the variance, was an indicator of emotional stress, at least as sensitive as the mean increase in the blood flow. Both a tranquillizer (thioridazine) and a beta-blocker (toliprolol) reduced the greater variance during the emotionally stressful situation in doses insufficient to diminish the mean increase in forearm blood flow.", 
    "22": "1. A comparative study between the effects of ischemia and reperfusion on the hypertrophied heart of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and on the heart of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) was carried out in working heart conditions. 2. The decrease of coronary flow induced by a coronary occlusion had an equal magnitude in the two groups. In the SHR group, the aortic output became null in 40% of the cases, whereas this effect was never seen in WKY group. 3. In reperfusion conditions, the recovery of haemodynamic values was slower in SHR group. The release of LDH and the rhythmic disturbances were also increased. 4. The perfusion of SHR hearts by lidocaine (4.3 10(-5) M), propranolol (7.7 10(-6) M) and verapamil (1.1 10(-7) M) decreased significantly the heart rate and the aortic output. 5. When these substances were added to the perfusion medium, the deleterious effects of reperfusion were greatly reduced. Aortic output recovered more quickly than his basal values and the enzymatic leakage was decreased. None of the hearts fibrillated after lidocaine and propranolol. Ventricular fibrillation continued in 14% of cases after verapamil compared to 80% of cases in the control group.", 
    "23": "The control of hypertension with antihypertensive agents, in the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) can result in regression of established cardiac hypertrophy. This study compared the effects of therapy with oxprenolol (Ox) and with hydrochlorothiazide (Htz) for (1) regression of established left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and (2) blood pressure control. Three groups of SHR and 3 comparable groups of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, matched for age, sex and body wt, were treated with tap water (Gp I), 60-200 mg hydrochlorothiazide kg-1 day-1 (Gp II) and 15-500 mg oxprenolol kg-1 day-1 (Gp III) for 13 weeks. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP mmHg), left ventricular wt/body wt ratio (LVwt/Bwt mg g-1) and left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT mm) were recorded. Oxprenolol lowered both systolic (mean +/- S.E. mmHg, 130 +/- 7 vs 189 +/- 8; P less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressures (mean +/- S.E. mmHg, 104 +/- 6 vs 159 +/- 6; P less than 0.001) and caused regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (mean +/- S.E. mg g-1, 2.91 +/- 0.06 vs 3.10 +/- 0.09; P less than 0.05). In contrast, hydrochlorothiazide did not control blood pressure (mean +/- S.E. mmHg, 183 +/- 5 vs 189 +/- 6 and 152 +/- 5 vs 156 +/- 6), but it did cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (mean +/- S.E. mg g-1, 2.67 +/- 0.03 vs 3.10 +/- 0.09; P less than 0.01). Left ventricular wall thickness, measured in the mid-ventricular region, was significantly reduced only by hydrochlorothiazide (mean +/- S.E. mm, 2.76 +/- 0.06 vs 3.21 +/- 0.01; P less than 0.05). These results suggest that regression of left ventricular hypertrophy can occur with or without control of hypertension in the SHR.", 
    "24": "Tritiated leucine injected into the vitreous of experimental animals was used for detection of the dynamics of axonal transport in the optic nerve in eyes with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Direct quantitative evaluation of axonal transport was performed by means of the liquid scintillation counter. Our results show that topical instillation of beta-blockers, pilocarpine and epinephrine have the most positive influence on the dynamics of axonal transport in eyes with increased IOP. There was a zero or negative influence of physostigmine, neostigmine, echothiophate and partially of clonidine (isoglaucon).", 
    "25": "A range of established and putative antidepressant therapies were studied for the effect of their long-term administration on two facets of presynaptic monoaminergic functioning in rat brain, namely NE, DA, and 5-HT turnover and alpha 2-adrenoceptor sensitivity. Unless stated otherwise drugs (10 mg/kg) were injected i.p. twice daily for 14 days. ECT (100 mA for 1 s) was applied once daily for 10 days. Changes in turnover were indirectly assessed by measuring levels of metabolites. Brain levels of MHPG-SO4 were unchanged by chronic amitriptyline, imipramine, nisoxetine (20 mg/kg), nortriptyline, salbutamol (5 mg/kg), and ECT. Amitriptyline elicited a slight, but significant, increase in brain DOPAC content. Brain levels of 5-HIAA were increased by amitriptyline, imipramine, salbutamol, and ECT. An overall view of the results indicates that no common pattern of change was elicited by the range of antidepressant therapies studied. Central alpha 2-adrenoceptor sensitivity was assessed by investigating the effect of various therapies on the ability of clonidine (25 mg/kg i.p.) to decrease rat brain MHPG-SO4 content. The clonidine-induced fall was attenuated by desipramine, imipramine, and ECT. Amitriptyline, iprindole, mianserin, nisoxetine, nortriptyline, Org 6582 (10 mg/kg once daily), pargyline (25 mg/kg once daily), salbutamol, and trazodone were ineffective. The following chronic antidepressant therapies were investigated for their effect on rat frontal cortex 3H-clonidine binding: amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, iprindole, mianserin, nisoxetine, nortriptyline, pargyline, salbutamol, and ECT. CHronic, but not acute, pargyline decreased 3H-clonidine binding and this was due to a diminished number of binding sites. The induction of subsensitive presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors in rat brain is not a property common to all forms of antidepressant therapies. Hence it cannot be the fundamental mode of action of antidepressants. No correlation exists between the changes in rat cortical 3H-clonidine binding and the observed changes in the sensitivity of central presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "26": "In an endemic area nodular toxic goitre is the dominating type of hyperthyroidism, while Graves' or Basedow's disease with diffuse toxic goitre accounts for only 25 to 30% of the patients. Since antithyroid drug therapy has poor permanent effect and recurrence rates of about 50 to 60% and radioiodine in turn requires higher doses and often repeated application, surgery is to be recommended as the primary treatment of choice for the nodular hyperthyroid goitre. -For Graves' disease the method of therapy is not as clear cut. Operation is indicated mainly when the disease is severe with a larger goitre or in younger age groups (below 40 years) where radioiodine may not be advisable. For preoperative treatment the use of antithyroid drugs in preferred, although iodine perhaps in combination with beta blockers may be used safely as well at least for moderate cases. In the presence of alternative means of treatment surgery should not exceed an operative risk of 0.5-1.5% with virtually no mortality. Our own experiences are based on a retrospective analysis of 702 patients from three hospitals.", 
    "27": "Reserpine- and propranolol-treated rats were given salbutamol, a beta-adrenergic stimulant, intra-peritoneally in an open control study. The results suggest that salbutamol has a therapeutic effect on the depressive behavior of reserpine- and propranolol-treated rats.", 
    "28": "The effects of different factors on leukocyte adherence was evaluated by using human peripheral blood before and after treatment (application). Magnesium ions, anti-inflammatory drugs and dextran have decreased neutrophil adherence. Calcium ions, propranolol, blood transfusion caused a significant decrease in adherence. These findings support the conclusion that the adherence test, which is influenced by numerous factors and whose results had a wide scatter, is not a useful tool in clinical diagnosis.", 
    "29": "The density of beta-adrenergic receptors has been determined on membranes prepared from lymphocytes of normal human volunteers. Long-term administration of propranolol resulted in an increase in the density of receptors, whereas administration of the agonists ephedrine and terbutaline elicited a marked decrease in the density of receptors. These changes may explain the delayed side effects observed when propranolol administration is abruptly discontinued and the decreased efficacy that occurs during long-term administration of an agonist. In other experiments, pindolol, an antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was administered to normal subjects. A marked decrease in the density of receptors occurred within 1 day of administering pindolol. This effect persisted beyond the time at which pindolol administration was discontinued.", 
    "30": "Early trials of beta-blocking drugs in angina indicated an increase in symptoms above pretreatment levels when placebo was substituted for active drug. This was followed by some reports of sudden death after beta-blockade withdrawal. There is evidence of increased beta-receptor sensitivity as suggested by increased responsiveness to isoprenaline after propranolol withdrawal. This may be due to an increased beta-receptor population. Other factors may be a reversal of the reduced free triiodothyroxine, of the rightward shift of the oxyhaemaglobin dissociation curve, and of reduced platelet aggregation, when the beta-blocking drug is stopped. Finally, progression of the disease process may take place during treatment, which is unmasked when treatment is withdrawn. beta-Blocking agents may differ; we have observed that in normal volunteers, withdrawal of pindolol, which has partial agonist properties, was not associated with postblockade increase in response to isoprenaline. The beta-blocker withdrawal syndrome is a real phenomenon, although overall the incidence is low. Besides stopping the beta-blocker, exertion may be a frequent prerequisite for the development of significant clinical sequelae, so exertion should be restricted when stopping a beta-blocking drug. Also the dose should be reduced gradually, particularly the final decrements.", 
    "31": "The possible relevance of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) for beta-blocker-induced changes in plasma lipids was investigated by reviewing the literature and analyzing the results separately for nonselective beta-blockers, beta 1-selective beta-blockers, and those possessing ISA. It was confirmed that with the exception of the nonselective beta-blocker sotalol, beta-blocker therapy has little influence on the plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. The small differences in mean changes in LDL-cholesterol observed among the three groups of beta-blockers are probably of negligible practical importance. More important differences emerged from the pooling of data on plasma triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Here, beta-blockers possessing ISA showed the smallest mean increase in triglycerides and an increase in HDL-cholesterol, which compared favorably with the decrease found for nonselective and beta 1-selective beta-blockers. Of the individual beta-blockers, pindolol exhibited the most favorable lipid profile. A close inverse correlation was found between the changes in triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol in the various studies. This finding, together with other arguments, supports the view that these changes are the result of inhibition of lipoprotein lipase by adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "32": "Pulmonary function can be reduced by beta-blockers. It has been established that no beta-blocker is entirely safe in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. An alternative medication not expected to influence pulmonary function should first be considered. This side effect of beta-blockers develops mostly in patients with reversible bronchial obstruction, and it is much less pronounced in those with irreversible bronchial obstruction. Translated into terms of clinical diagnosis, this means that problems should be expected in patients with bronchial asthma and with asthmatic bronchitis, whereas those with chronic bronchitis and emphysema are much less likely to develop relevant symptoms. It has been demonstrated that beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), such as pindolol, and beta 1-selective blockers have a less marked effect on pulmonary function than nonselective beta-blockers without ISA, such as propranolol. The untoward effect can be compensated by combination with a beta-mimetic agent; this mechanism is most effective during beta 1-selective blockade.", 
    "33": "In a randomized double-blind trial 36 patients with essential hypertension were treated with either metoprolol or pindolol for 6 months following a 6-week placebo period. At the end of the placebo period and after 6 weeks and 6 months of active therapy peripheral hemodynamics at rest and during maximal vasodilatation were studied. Exercise heart rate was reduced to the same extent with both metoprolol and pindolol, indicating that the doses used (metoprolol average 179 mg/day; pindolol average 12 mg/day) were equipotent as regards beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect. The antihypertensive effect was identical with both compounds. However, metoprolol caused a significant reduction of heart rate at rest both at 6 weeks and 6 months. With pindolol the reduction in heart rate was not significant at 6 weeks, and it was clearly much less than with metoprolol. On the other hand, no change in calf vascular resistance was seen during metoprolol therapy, whereas a marked and statistically significant reduction was caused by pindolol. Resistance at maximal dilatation in the forearm did not change with metoprolol, but tended to fall with pindolol after 6 weeks and was significantly reduced after 6 months. This indicates that although metoprolol and pindolol have the same antihypertensive potency, the two agents appear to reduce blood pressure through different mechanisms. Thus, cardiac mechanisms seem to play the most important role with metoprolol, whereas pindolol mainly acts by a reduction in vascular resistance. It also seems that treatment with pindolol normalizes the structural arteriolar abnormality present in hypertension as indicated by the reduction in resistance at maximal vasodilation.", 
    "34": "It was the purpose of the present study to assess the hemodynamic effects of adrenergic beta-receptor blocking drugs possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) and/or beta 1 selectivity, both at rest and during exercise. The hemodynamic effects of seven different beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol, acebutolol, ICI 72,222, ICI 89,406, and pindolol) were studied at rest in patients with ischemic heart disease. Heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), arterial blood pressure (BP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PP) were determined. At rest, it was possible to subdivide the various beta-blockers into three main groups according to the degree of ISA. One group without ISA, including propranolol and atenolol, reduced CO by 25% and HR by 15%. A second group with moderate ISA, represented by practolol, acebutolol and ICI 72,222, reduced CO only by 15% and HR by 10%. A third group with pronounced ISA, represented by pindolol and ICI 89,406, did not change CO and HR significantly. All three groups consisted of drugs both with and without beta 1 selectivity. During exercise, pindolol and propranolol reduced CO, HR, and BP to the same extent. In conclusion, the central hemodynamic response to beta-blockers at rest is determined by the degree of ISA, whereas beta 1 selectivity does not modify the central hemodynamic response to beta-blockade. However, the hemodynamic differences between adrenergic beta-blocking drugs with and without ISA disappear in situations with increased sympathetic drive, such as exercise.", 
    "35": "Despite their common property of competitive beta-adrenoceptor blockade, beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs differ in the presence or absence of several ancillary properties. One of these is partial agonist activity [intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA)]. Drugs of this type are as effective in inhibiting beta-adrenoceptor stimulation as are drugs devoid of ISA, but unlike the latter they produce some stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. This stimulating activity is sufficient to compensate partly or totally for the loss of resting sympathetic drive resulting from blockade of beta-adrenoceptors. Increases in heart rate during physic and psychic stress, however, are reduced to practically the same extent by all beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, whether they possess ISA or not. With pindolol the maximum stimulatory activity is reached at very low doses. Over a dose range wider than that used in clinical practice, the effect of pindolol on resting heart rate is therefore not dependent on the dose but on the heart rate before drug administration. Pindolol is a drug with sufficient ISA to compensate for blockade of sympathetic drive at rest. It therefore does not influence or only slightly reduces normal resting heart rate and cardiac output, and thus does not give rise to reflex increases in total peripheral resistance. During chronic oral treatment of hypertension with pindolol, peripheral resistance is usually reduced.", 
    "36": "After a short introduction on the basic physiology of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, including their subdivisions into pre- and postsynaptic subtypes, the principle of competitive antagonism at the level of postjunctional beta-receptor subtypes is explained. Moreover, properties like membrane-stabilizing potency, beta 1-receptor selectivity (cardioselectivity), and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are discussed at a molecular level. The most frequent applications of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents in cardiovascular disease, neurology, psychiatry, ophthalmology, and endocrine disorders are enumerated and discussed at a pharmacological level, together with side effects, contraindications, and interactions with other drugs.", 
    "37": "The effects of beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation on rat left atrial responses to the full agonist isoproterenol and the partial agonists prenalterol and pirbuterol were studied. Atria from rats implanted with a mini-osmotic-pump subcutaneously delivering isoproterenol at 400 micrograms X kg-1 X h-1 for 4 days were 12-16 times less sensitive to isoproterenol than normal atria. Scatchard analyses indicated that the implantation of these mini-osmotic-pumps produced a 50% decrease in the number of beta-adrenoceptors in the ventricles with no alteration in the binding constant of [3H]dihydroalprenolol. Receptor down-regulation produced a parallel shift to the right of concentration-response curves to isoproterenol, and a complete suppression of responses to both partial agonists. The affinities of the partial agonists for the receptors were not altered; in desensitized atria the partial agonists were functional beta-antagonists blocking the responses to isoproterenol. The data are modeled by equations from classical receptor theory which predict the depression of responses to partial agonists with receptor down-regulation. These results are discussed with respect to the utility of prenalterol and pirbuterol in congestive heart failure since possible tachyphylaxis to these drugs with chronic usage could limit their value.", 
    "38": "We investigated the hemodynamic effects and myocardial salvage actions of sotalol during experimental myocardial infarction in the baboon. Ten baboons received placebo and six were given sotalol. In anesthetized open-chest baboons base-line determinations included heart rate (HR), rate-pressure product (RPP), left ventricular dP/dt, aortic pressures, serum creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) activity, and a 16-point epicardial ST segment map. The left anterior descending coronary artery was then ligated and the measurements were repeated at 15-min and at 2-h intervals up to 12 h after occlusion. At 12 h, coronary blood flow and myocardial CK activity were also measured. Twenty minutes after ligation, either sotalol (3 mumol . kg-1 followed by 2 nmol . kg-1 . min-1) or placebo (saline) was administered intravenously. Sotalol reduced HR but not dP/dt or the degree of afterload. The reduction in HR resulted in a significant decrease in RPP (myocardial O2 consumption). Sotalol administration also resulted in a decrease in coronary blood flow (myocardial O2 supply). There were no significant differences between the two groups in serum CK-MB activity or in the extent of myocardial damage, as predicted by the 15-min ST-segment deviations and myocardial CK activity at 12 h. The reduction in myocardial oxygen demand caused by sotalol was accompanied by a decrease in oxygen supply. As a consequence, no significant reduction in myocardial ischemic damage was found in the group given sotalol.", 
    "39": "Twenty-six patients with essential hypertension were admitted to a protocol comparing the efficacy of the once-a-day administration of acebutolol with twice-a-day administration. A placebo was substituted initially for their beta-blocker therapy. Other therapy was continued in 14 (11, diuretics alone; two, diuretics plus hydralazine or alpha-methyldopa; one, alpha-methyldopa alone). After 4 weeks, lying blood pressures were 160 +/- 16 (SD) mm Hg systolic, and 101 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic. Incremental twice-a-day doses of acebutolol resulted in normotension (lying systolic, 131 +/- 12 mm Hg; diastolic, 84 +/- 5 mm Hg) in all 26 patients (eight on 400 mg, four on 600 mg, seven on 800 mg, one on 1,000 mg, and six on 1,200 mg/day). The same twice-a-day acebutolol dose was continued for two visits, 4 weeks apart, recording pressures at 8 a.m., 12 noon, 4 p.m., and 8 p.m.; followed by two visits, 4 weeks apart, while taking the total daily dose after the 8 a.m. recording. Blood pressures during once-a-day dosing were not different from those during twice-a-day dosing at any time. Highest pressures were at 8 a.m. and lowest were at 12 noon or 4 p.m. Variations during the day in both systolic and diastolic pressures were greater during once-a-day dosing. Plasma acebutolol and metabolite concentrations were proportional to the administered dose. Eighteen patients continued acebutolol for 1 year without adverse effects other than an asymptomatic positive antinuclear antibody test in six. Once-a-day dosing was as effective as twice-a-day dosing in this group of hypertensive patients.", 
    "40": "A contribution by active vasodilation to the hypotensive effect of medroxalol was investigated in anesthetized dogs and reserpinized pithed rats. In anesthetized dogs, intravenous doses of medroxalol, which decreased blood pressure and heart rate, also produced a dose-related vasodilation in the isolated perfused gracilis muscle in situ. This vasodilator effect of medroxalol was completely blocked by propranolol; the hypotensive effect of medroxalol was inhibited 50% by propranolol but not at all by practolol. In reserpinized pithed rats with angiotensin-supported blood pressure, intravenous doses of medroxalol also produced propranolol-sensitive decreases in diastolic blood pressure and did not alter heart rate. Labetalol produced similar effects but was significantly less potent. Comparatively, equivalent amounts of isoproterenol and pindolol decreased diastolic blood pressure but increased heart rate. In the isolated guinea pig trachea, medroxalol produced a propranolol-sensitive relaxation at concentrations that antagonized the relaxant effects of salbutamol. Identical concentrations of medroxalol did not increase rate of isolated guinea pig atria. It is concluded that a substantial portion of the hypotensive effect of medroxalol is due to a beta 2-adrenergic-receptor-mediated vasodilation.", 
    "41": "Adenosine decreased the force of contraction of isolated rat left atria (direct action) and inhibited the positive inotropic action of isoproterenol (indirect action). The direct action of adenosine was not accompanied by changes in cyclic nucleotide levels, while the isoproterenol-induced increase in cyclic AMP level was reduced by the nucleoside. Reserpine pretreatment and pindolol did not affect the direct action of adenosine. Both the direct and indirect actions of adenosine were enhanced by dipyridamole and dilazep and inhibited by 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine and theophylline. Among adenosine derivatives, N6-phenylisopropyladenosine was most potent, and 2'-deoxyadenosine was least effective in inducing the negative inotropic action in the absence and presence of isoproterenol. In atria pretreated with islet-activating protein (IAP) both the direct and indirect actions of adenosine, and the actions of N6-phenylisopropyladenosine were markedly attenuated compared with those in nontreated atria. The isoproterenol-induced increase in cyclic AMP level was not reduced by adenosine in IAP-treated atria. These results indicate that adenosine produces a dual action on rat atria: it decreases the force of contraction directly by a mechanism independent of cyclic AMP metabolism, and inhibits the positive inotropic action of isoproterenol by reducing the drug-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP. IAP attenuates both of these inhibitory actions of adenosine on rat atria.", 
    "42": "We evaluated the hemodynamic effects of combined administration of metoprolol and tocainide in nine patients with uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction. After 24 h of treatment with oral metoprolol (50 mg q.8 h), intravenous tocainide was given (750 mg over 15 min), followed by oral administration of both drugs (50 mg metoprolol q.8 h; 800 mg tocainide, then 400 mg q.8 h). Hemodynamic variables were measured before and after 25 h of oral metoprolol treatment, immediately after intravenous tocainide (at 15 and 30 min), and then during continued oral treatment with both drugs (at 2 h 15 min and 25 h 45 min). Following injection of tocainide, cardiac index changed significantly (2.7-2.3 L/min . m2; p less than 0.01), but the increases in pulmonary wedge pressure (9-13 mm Hg) and total systemic resistance (15.9-18.1 IU) were not significant. During the continued oral treatment with both metoprolol and tocainide no significant hemodynamic interaction was observed. We conclude that the injection of tocainide can slightly and transiently depress left ventricular function in patients treated with metoprolol.", 
    "43": "Nylidrin hydrochloride has weak beta-adrenergic agonist properties with rat mast cells, and shows synergy with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) in raising intracellular cAMP in purified mast cells; both of these properties can be blocked by dl-propranolol. However, the action of nylidrin hydrochloride as an inhibitor of histamine secretion from purified rat mast cells is not antagonized by dl-propranolol, nor is it potentiated by IBMX. Nylidrin-induced elevation of cellular cAMP in purified rat mast cells shows no correlation with nylidrin-induced inhibition of histamine release. Thus, nylidrin hydrochloride inhibits release of histamine from mast cells by a novel, non-adrenergic mechanism, which is not dependent on increased levels of cAMP.", 
    "44": "Active and inactive PRA were measured after 1 h at rest in 16 normal controls and 20 patients with hyperthyroidism. In some of the patients these measurements were repeated after they had become euthyroid or received 90 mg propranolol for 1 week. Inactive PRA was determined as the difference between total PRA after trypsin activation and active PRA. Active PRA was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in untreated patients than in normal subjects; however, the inactive PRA of patients was not different compared with that of normal subjects. Active PRA was normalized, and inactive PRA did not change after achievement of euthyroidism. The proportion of active of total PRA was significantly correlated with the levels of serum thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) in hyperthyroid patients (r = 0.46; P less than 0.05 and r = 0.55; P less than 0.01, respectively). The administration of propranolol reduced active PRA (P less than 0.05) and increased inactive PRA slightly but not significantly. These results indicate that in hyperthyroidism, the in vivo conversion of inactive renin to active renin is probably facilitated by increased sympathetic activity.", 
    "45": "In a randomized parallel-group trial the blood-pressure lowering effect of a new beta-adrenoceptor blocker bopindolol (LT 31-200) in a dose of 1-4 mg once daily (eight patients) was compared with that of propranolol in a dose of 40-120 mg t.i.d. (nine patients). The average blood pressure fell in the bopindolol group from 185/113 mmHg to 135/90 mmHg and in the propranolol group from 183/120 mmHg to 147/102 mmHg. Both changes were statistically significant. This was achieved during a nine week treatment period at the end of which the average dose of bopindolol was 3 mg per day and of propranolol 330 mg per day. One patient receiving bopindolol interrupted the trial because of restlessness and insomnia, and one receiving propranolol because of bronchospasm. Side-effects were, otherwise, mild in both groups. During a one-year treatment period following the comparative trial, the seven patients who had received bopindolol showed no evidence of tachyphylaxia, the blood-pressure remaining well controlled while the dosage was slightly reduced. No new side-effects were reported and the ANA and AMA tests remained negative in all patients.", 
    "46": "There have been numerous investigations into the effect of kidney or liver diseases on the renal or hepatic elimination of drugs, but little is known about the possible consequences of renal insufficiency on the hepatic clearance of medicinal agents. The first reports of diminished presystemic elimination of drugs in renal failure were presented by Bianchetti in 1976 for propranolol and by Levy in 1979 for dextropropoxyphene. We confirmed the fact that the hepatic presystemic elimination of drugs might be diminished by kidney diseases. We studied this phenomenon with the beta-blocking agents tolamolol, bufuralol and oxprenolol. Tolamolol is eliminated from the body mainly by aromatic hydroxylation and, for bufuralol, aliphatic hydroxylation also plays an important role, whereas, for oxprenolol, glucuroconjugation of the unchanged compound is an important route of elimination. After oral administration, the areas under the plasma/blood concentration curves were markedly increased in patients with renal insufficiency as compared to healthy subjects. The clearance approach of Rowland and Tozer led to the conclusion that decrease of the presystemic hepatic elimination might be the main reason for this finding. Cefoperazone is a cephalosporin eliminated to 75% by the biliary route under normal conditions. In a study in which the drug was intravenously infused to both healthy volunteers and patients with renal insufficiency, we found that in some patients the extrarenal clearance was markedly reduced. It is probable that in this situation the patients also suffered from a slight hepatic insufficiency, as sometimes observed in the case of kidney disease associated with a poor physical condition. It is well-known that in patients with terminal liver failure, the kidney may also be involved, producing a condition known as the \"hepato-renal\" syndrome. We feel that there is evidence to support the hypothesis that renal failure can disturb the pharmacokinetics of drugs by processes other than merely reducing their renal excretion. The precise causes of the decreased hepatic elimination found in renal patients remains, however, to be determined.", 
    "47": "Hepatic drug oxidation is a major source of interindividual variations in drug behaviour. A wide spread of the pharmacokinetic parameters of extensively oxidized drugs is a common observation. For such compounds, in the absence of polymodal distribution of the kinetic parameters, no distinct genetic influence can be detected. The discovery that the urinary excretion of debrisoquine and its main hydroxylated metabolite displays a bimodal pattern opened a new field in the study of hepatic metabolism. This new genetic polymorphism now concerns the oxidative metabolism of numerous substances such as antihypertensive agents, antidepressants, antiarrhythmic drugs and various other unrelated compounds. The poor metabolizer phenotype is observed in some 8% of individuals in European populations. We have shown that the oxidative metabolism of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs is under the same genetic control as debrisoquine. Using bufuralol as a test drug, we have studied the influence of polymorphic oxidation on interindividual variations of parent drug and metabolite plasma concentrations. It appears clearly that oxidation polymorphism is a major factor of variability in hepatic drug handling. This fact has important clinical and pharmaceutical implications.", 
    "48": "Administration of the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, prenalterol, affects the acinar cell of the rat parotid in a manner similar to that observed after isoprenaline (IPR) treatment. Sixty minutes after injection of prenalterol, many cells are depleted of their zymogen granules and there is evidence of secretory protein resynthesis. Long term treatment leads to cellular hypertrophy and marked structural changes in the granule population. The cellular alterations are, however, not as pronounced as those observed after IPR injections. This may be due to the combined beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor effect of IPR. With prenalterol, cell damage is obvious in acute experiments. In long term treated animals numerous characteristic autophagic vacuoles are observed, reflecting a reorganization of cytoplasmic components in superstimulated glands. Although prenalterol and IPR give rise to rather similar structural changes in parotid glands, marked differences between effects of the two drugs on gland biochemistry have been noted. It seems evident that different biochemical pathways involved in secretory activity have actions in common with respect to effects on submicroscopical structures.", 
    "49": "The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, alpha blockade, and elimination of the adrenergic nerve function on mucosal blood flow and acid secretion in parietal-cell-vagotomized (PCV) gastric fistula dogs. Isoprenaline inhibited pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion via the beta 1 receptors non-competitively. The effect of isoprenaline was more pronounced after vagotomy than before vagotomy and significantly more pronounced than the effect on parasympathomimetically stimulated (bethanechol) gastric acid secretion. The animals were subjected to chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxy-dopamine, a false neurotransmitter that selectively destroys the adrenergic nerve terminals. Chemical sympathectomy increased the pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion and stabilized the mucosal blood flow at the level before vagotomy, but with an increased ratio between blood flow and acid secretion. One may conclude that the sympathetic nerve system influences gastric function after vagotomy.", 
    "50": "The aim of the present study was, in paired experiments in dogs, to examine the effect of beta-receptor blockade on gastric acid secretion and mucosal blood flow before and after parietal cell vagotomy (PCV). The secretory response to pentagastrin was reduced after vagotomy. beta-Adrenergic blockade had no effect on pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion before PCV, but after PCV beta blockade caused a modest increase in acid secretion, mediated mainly by the beta 2 receptors. A similar trend was seen in man. A marked increase in mucosal blood flow occurred 30 min after propranolol and was followed by a late decrease. One may conclude that a modest beta-adrenergic tone, which reduces secretion, becomes manifest after vagal denervation and that an increase in the ratio between mucosal blood flow and acid secretion was induced by the PCV. This increase cannot be explained as a beta-receptor-mediated effect.", 
    "51": "The influence of adrenergic agonists--phenylephrine (alpha), isoproterenol (beta), and salbutamol (beta 2)--and of adrenergic blockers--phentolamine (alpha), pranolol (beta), and practolol (beta 1)--on the postprandial pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release has been assessed in five Labrador retrievers. Infusions of phenylephrine, 0.12 mg kg-1h-1; isoproterenol, 3 micrograms kg-1h-1; salbutamol, 12 micrograms kg-1h-1, did not significantly affect PP release. Propranolol, 0.5 mg kg-1, and propranolol, 0.5 mg kg-1, + phentolamine, 1 mg kg-1, combined, given as intravenous boluses before the meal significantly reduce PP release (44% and 58% of controls, p less than 0.05), whereas phentolamine, 1 mg kg-1, and practolol, 1 mg kg-1, had no effect. Phenylephrine combined with phentolamine and isoproterenol combined with propranolol and practolol did not influence PP secretion. It is concluded that the postprandial PP release is stimulated by beta 2-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "52": "The effect of dopamine, 0.006, 0.12, 1.2, and 2.4 mg X kg-1 X h1, and the dopamine antagonist sulpiride on postprandial pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release has been studied in dogs. Dopamine reduced PP release, the reduction ranging between 28% and 97% of the integrated PP response after food. The inhibition obtained with dopamine, 0.12 and 2.4 mg X kg-1 X h-1, could be partly reversed (p less than 0.05) by sulpiride, 7.5 mg X kg-1. The concomitant administration of phentolamine, 1.0 mg X kg-1, and propranolol, 0.5 mg X kg -1, partly reversed the inhibition obtained with dopamine, 2.4 mg X kg-1 X h-1 (p less than 0.05). In healthy volunteers basal PP concentration and postprandial PP release were diminished by dopamine, 0.12 mg X kg-1 X h-1 (p less than 0.02). Sulpiride in dogs and haloperidol in volunteers reduced PP release when given without concomitant administration of dopamine. It is concluded that dopamine inhibits postprandial PP release via both dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors.", 
    "53": "The effect of adrenergic agonists and antagonists on the secretion of gastric somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) and gastrin was investigated in an isolated, vascularly perfused rat stomach preparation. Two- to six-fold increases in SLI secretion induced by isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were completely abolished by propranolol but were not influenced by phentolamine. Propranolol did not alter glucagon- and DB-cAMP-induced stimulation of SLI release. Experiments in which the beta 2-agonist salbutamol and the beta 1- and beta 2-blockers practolol and H35/25 were used showed that both subtypes of beta receptors are involved. Gastrin secretion revealed only minor changes in dose-response studies with a wide range of isoproterenol concentrations (2 X 10(-8) to 1.5 X 10(-4) M). The results obtained in this study suggest that in rats 1) the SLI response to adrenergic agonism is predominantly mediated by beta receptors; 2) both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors are involved; 3) under in vitro conditions, adrenergic agonism is a weak stimulus for gastrin secretion.", 
    "54": "An early exercise stress test was carried out in 116 patients 8 to 14 days after a myocardial infarction. This test is in good agreement with the late maximal stress test performed 8 weeks after the infarction, both tests being positive together in 86.4% and negative in 84.6% of the cases. Residual coronary insufficiency is present in 41.4% of the patients during the early test, 47.9% after inferior and 30.2% after anterior infarction. With beta blocking therapy, 28.2% of the patients had a positive test, and 48% without this treatment. The sensitivity of the early test is good after inferior infarction but poor after anterior infarction or during beta blocking therapy. A multivessel disease is disclosed by coronary angiography in 78.5% of the patients with a positive early stress test and in 53.3% in cases with a negative test. In the patients with a positive test, mortality at one year is higher (8.7% versus 2.9%). A coronary angiography should be performed relatively precociously in this group of patients.", 
    "55": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were compared to their controls, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, with respect to contractile responses of aortic preparations and catecholamine concentrations in aorta and superior cervical ganglion (SCG). Contractile responses of aortic preparations to norepinephrine were significantly lower in SHR than in WKY rats, but relaxation responses to isoproterenol were not different. Norepinephrine levels were elevated in SCG and aortas of SHR vs. WKY rats. The results suggest that there are important differences in vascular responses of SHR compared with WKY rats, and raise the question of whether these differences are reflective of transmitter levels and their effects on alpha-adrenergic receptor sensitivity. The results also suggest that lack of beta receptor involvement in the observed alpha receptor desensitization may be important for the development of hypertension in SHR.", 
    "56": "The effect of several beta-blockers on the vasoactive effect of several substances was studied on the perfused isolated rat mesenteric vessels. The agonists were tested while the beta-blocker was infused; the effects were compared in the same experiment with those observed in a control period in which the agonists were injected without simultaneous infusion of beta-blocker. l-propranolol, infused at three different doses, did not modify the vascular effect of either angiotensin II (AII) or vasopressin (VP). On the other hand, the constrictor effect of epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) was significantly reduced. Timolol, but not sotalol, showed the same results. d-propranolol produced the same effect as l-propranolol. A high dose of l-propranolol did not protect alpha adrenoceptors of blockade induced by phentolamine.", 
    "57": "Three topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents without preservatives were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of five microorganisms in vitro. Timolol maleate and befunolol hydrochloride showed no antimicrobial activity; however, bupranolol hydrochloride inhibited microbial growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration of bupranolol hydrochloride was 0.1% for Bacillus subtilis and 0.05% for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.", 
    "58": "Enzyme immunoassays for befunolol (BFE-60) and its main metabolite, M1, were established. These assays were based on the double antibody solid phase principle. Specific antisera to these agents were raised in rabbits by immunization with N-succinyl-BFE-60-human serum albumin (HSA) conjugate and N-succinyl-M1-HSA conjugate, respectively. Antibody was incubated with a mixture of beta-D-galactosidase (beta-Gal) labelled hapten and unlabelled standard or sample drug which had been succinylated prior to assay. The antibody-bound drug was separated from free using anti-rabbit IgG immobilized on a polystyrene ball, and activity of the enzyme on the solid phase was determined fluorometrically. Succinylation of both BFE-60 and M1 resulted in 100-fold increased sensitivity with reduced cross-reactivity. The present immunoassays allow detection of 0.4 pg of BFE-60 (10 pg/ml) and 3 pg of M1 (75 pg/ml). The time courses of plasma levels of BFE-60 and M1 were examined after a single intravenous administration (1 mg/kg) or a single topical instillation (0.2, 1.0 and 5.0%: 50 microliters) to albino rabbits. BFE-60 and M1 in biological fluids required acetone-extraction before assay.", 
    "59": "Recently completed Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial in which propranolol was administered to patients following an acute myocardial infarction resulted in a 26% decrease in total mortality and a 23% decrease in total coronary events in the propranolol-treated patients as compared to the placebo patients during the average follow-up of 25 months. In addition to the decrease in mortality and morbidity, the drug was well tolerated in the patients treated with the drug when compared to those who received placebo. In the patients who received propranolol, there was a decreased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. These results, coupled with the results of other trials using beta-adrenergic blocking agents including sotalol and timolol, strongly supports the beneficial effect of the routine administration of these beta blocking agents in the postmyocardial infarction patients.", 
    "60": "After oral administration of isosorbide dinitrate, plasma concentrations of isosorbide dinitrate and mononitrates can be measured. An attempt was made to identify a number of factors which influence these plasma concentrations. Presence of renal failure, acute or chronic treatment with beta-blocking agents, and chronic cimetidine treatment did not influence the plasma concentrations. In a number of patients with cirrhosis, however, plasma concentrations of isosorbide dinitrate were found to be higher than in noncirrhotic patients.", 
    "61": "beta-Endorphin (200ng), dynorphin1-17 (2 micrograms) and morphine (4 micrograms) suppressed the osmotically-evoked release of oxytocin in anaesthetized lactating rats. ACTH1-24 (0.2-3 micrograms) administered intraventricularly 3 min before beta-endorphin or morphine attenuated their inhibitory action, but when applied afterwards was never seen to reverse their effects although this was achieved with naloxone (lmg X kg-1, i.v.). ACTH however, was ineffective against dynorphin. At higher doses an opiate-like action of ACTH was observed. Thus ACTH may act as a partial antagonist and at higher doses as a partial agonist of the opiate receptor for which it is known to have an affinity. It is suggested that suppression of oxytocin release by endogenous beta-endorphin could be modified by ACTH with which it may be co-released.", 
    "62": "The concentration-beta blocking effect and time-effect relationships of carteolol were examined in eight normal adults given 15 mg i.v. and 20 mg orally on separate occasions. Resting and post-exercise blood pressures and heart rates were assessed before and at various times up to 48 h after each dose. Carteolol, a beta-blocker with some partial agonist activity, produced an insignificant, transient increase in heart rate 2 to 6 h after both doses, and a fall (p less than 0.05) in diastolic blood pressure 4 and 6 h after the intravenous dose and 6 h after the oral dose in the resting supine position, as compared to the corresponding baseline values. All values of the post-exercise heart rate and the double product after each of the doses were significantly (p less than 0.001) below the baseline values for the entire period (48 h) of observation. A significant correlation between the log plasma carteolol concentration (log C) and its beta-blocking effect (E: p less than 0.001, r = 0.508 i.v.; p less than 0.001, r = 0.626, p.o.) was found. The r-values for individuals were higher (0.852 to 0.977, intravenous; 0.817 to 0.981, oral) than for the group as a whole. The slope (m) of the relationship, E = m X log C + r, showed a certain variance within and between individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Methods for estimating the bioavailability of drugs with long elimination half-lives are examined. Provided both absorption and disposition are linear a simple linear regression method is developed which can be used to calculate bioavailability in situations where only an incomplete estimate of the area under the curve (AUC) is available. The regression method and the traditional method of comparing the AUC following an oral dose to the AUC following an i.v. dose were applied to simulated data. It was found that the AUC ratio method works well as long as absorption is complete within the time over which the AUC is computed. The regression method is less precise than the AUC ratio method but is more accurate for drugs with long absorption half-lives. When applied to published data on a beta blocker the two methods produced comparable results. The bioavailability of amiodarone in three human subjects was calculated to be 0.20, 0.44 and 0.98 using the regression method with similar results from the ratio method. It is not possible to estimate the clearance of amiodarone from single dose data.", 
    "64": "In a double-blind, cross-over trial, 10 men with primary hypertension, not adequately controlled with a beta-blocker alone, were also given felodipine or placebo for periods of one week. Placebo was administered single-blind for 2 weeks and 1 week, respectively, before randomization and between treatments. The dose of felodipine ranged from 6.25 mg to 25 mg. The addition of felodipine resulted in a pronounced (20%), statistically significant reduction in blood pressure (BP) and a small but significant increase in heart rate (HR). The effects were seen within 1-2 h and were maximal after 3-4 h. During steady state treatment the duration of BP reduction was at least 12 h. No orthostatic reaction was seen. There was a significant correlation between the plasma concentration of felodipine and change in BP. The most frequently reported side-effects were headache and ankle oedema, the latter probably being due to pronounced pre-capillary vasodilatation. There was no weight increase and thus no indication of general water retention. No clinically significant change in laboratory variables and no influence on the P-Q time were seen. Thus, felodipine in combination with a beta-blocker seems to be a useful addition to the treatment of hypertensive patients whose BP is not adequately controlled with a beta-blocker alone.", 
    "65": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) injected intravenously was found to induce a flow of saliva from both the parotid and the submaxillary gland in the rat. The secretion was slow in onset. The amount of saliva secreted from the parotid gland was less than that from the submaxillary gland. Parotid saliva was very viscous. VIP-evoked parotid saliva was more protein rich than both submaxillary saliva and saliva secreted in response to other sialagogue drugs including the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoprenaline. The effect of VIP was direct; it occurred after removal of the adrenals, after degeneration of intraglandular nerves and in the presence of autonomic blockers. A supersensitivity to VIP was demonstrable. In the parotid and the submaxillary glands the secretory response to VIP was enlarged following parasympathetic denervation and decentralization, respectively, while after sympathetic denervation supersensitivity was only found to develop in the submaxillary gland.", 
    "66": "Pharmacologic agents currently used or being studied for the treatment of schizophrenia are reviewed. Neuroleptic medications are still the mainstay of treatment, but recent studies suggest new approaches to dosage and to the treatment of acute psychosis. Lithium is beneficial in psychotic illnesses with acute onset and a remitting course, regardless of the acute psychotic symptoms. Antidepressant agents may ameliorate depression in psychotic patients, but do not improve psychotic symptoms or social withdrawal. Propranolol's reported antipsychotic action has not been confirmed by controlled studies, but the drug may have a role in treating organic psychoses. The benzodiazepines, clonidine, and carbamazepine all merit more investigation as possible treatments for psychosis. The implications of differential treatment response among schizophrenic patients are discussed.", 
    "67": "The slow-channel blockers constitute a structurally diverse group of drugs with varying mechanisms of action, propensities for site of greatest cardiovascular activity, and clinical efficacy. They share however the property of blocking the slow inward channel in heart muscle and of inhibiting calcium fluxes in smooth muscle. Their in vivo and in vitro actions must be distinguished. The overall actions represent a balance of direct and autonomically-mediated reflex actions interacting with the compounds' varying degrees of intrinsic non-competitive sympathetic antagonism. A knowledge of the pharmacodynamic differences between these drugs allows the physician to select the most appropriate agent for a given clinical situation. The central role of calcium in the cellular processes in the heart and the vascular system forms the basis for the utility of this class of drugs in a wide variety of cardiovascular disorders. Current intensive experimental and clinical investigations are likely to further define the roles of nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem and their congeners in cardiovascular therapeutics. The prospect of development of newer compounds with greater selectivity of action is real. As pointed out by Braunwald (1982 a,b), with further clarification of the mechanisms of actions of these compounds and elucidation of the role of calcium fluxes throughout the body, more specific and potent agents may be developed. The apparent efficacy of the nifedipine congener nimodipine, in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (Allen et al., 1983) may simply be the first of a large number of 'specific' or targeted slow channel blockers. The development of such compounds may offer further therapeutic possibilities in the control of a variety of cardiocirculatory diseases.", 
    "68": "The role of prorenin in relation to beta-blockade has received little attention. We have studied both active renin and prorenin before and during treatment of hypertension with either nadolol or metoprolol in 44 patients. The ratio of active renin to prorenin before treatment was the best predictor of response; the fall in active renin with treatment did not correlate with the fall in blood pressure, whereas prorenin showed an inverse correlation. We suggest that plasma prorenin is an important indicator of the renin status in hypertensive patients."
