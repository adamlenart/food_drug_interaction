    "0": "This investigation examined the stereoselective nature of the steroid-sensitive extraneuronal O-methylation process for the isomers of isoprenaline in the rabbit aorta. The rate of O-methylation of (-)- and (+)-isoprenaline was linear with substrate concentration in the range 0.24 to 4.7 mumol X 1(-1). There was marked preference for the O-methylation of (-)-isoprenaline rather than (+)-isoprenaline at low (less than 0.94 mumol X 1(-1) substrate concentrations. In contrast, at concentrations equal to or greater than 9.4 mumol X 1(-1) the rates of O-methylation of (-)- and (+)-isoprenaline were similar. Phenoxybenzamine (30 mumol X 1(-1) inhibited but did not abolish the O-methylation of both (-)- and (+)-isoprenaline when the isomers were present in a concentration range of 0.24 mumol X 1(-1) to 9.4 mumol X 1(-1). Phenoxybenzamine did not significantly influence the O-methylation of either (-)- or (+)-isoprenaline when the isomers were present at a concentration of 24 mumol X 1(-1). Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) produced an equipotent and marked inhibition of the O-methylation of both (-)- and (+)-isoprenaline at a low (0.24 mumol X 1(-1) substrate concentration. When higher substrate concentrations were used, there was a significantly greater resistance to the inhibition of O-methylation of (-)-isoprenaline than was the case for (+)-isoprenaline. At a concentration of 9.4 mumol X 1(-1), the steroid failed to inhibit the O-methylation of (-)-isoprenaline but was effective in inhibiting the O-methylation of (+)-isoprenaline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "The effect of propranolol on isoniazid elimination kinetics have been investigated in six healthy males. Following propranolol pretreatment of 40 mg at 8-hourly intervals given for three days, isoniazid clearance (13.0 l/hour +/- s.e.m. 2.6 l/hour) was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than that obtained during the control study (16.4 l/hour +/- s.e.m. 3.0 l/hour). However, no significant correlation was demonstrated between the magnitude of the reduction in isoniazid clearance and the depression of the exercise-induced tachycardia caused by propranolol (rs = 0.03, p greater than 0.05). The mechanism of the impairment of isoniazid clearance by propranolol is unlikely due to the change in liver blood flow.", 
    "2": "C57BL/6 inbred mice lack the 1-5 sec bursts of 6-7 cps spindles characteristic of the neocortical EEG of DBA/2 mice during waking. C57BL/6 mice (1) may be unable to generate any synchronized cortical EEG activity, (2) may lack the thalamocortical circuitry required to generate these brief spindle episodes (BSEs), (3) may lack mechanisms that can activate this circuitry or (4) may possess a potent mechanism to suppress BSE initiation and generation. Possibilities 1 and 2 have been eliminated because C57BL/6 mice generate pentobarbital, rostropontine-induced and sleep spindles, and because certain C57BL/6 sleep spindles resembled the BSEs seen in DBA/2 mice. Possibilities 3 and 4 were examined in the experiments reported here. In DBA/2 mice, pentylenetetrazol activates BSEs at subconvulsant doses. In contrast, neither 20 nor 50 mg/kg, IP, pentylenetetrazol activated BSEs in C57BL/6 mice, although the higher dose provoked 4-5 cps slow waves and myoclonic jerks. In DBA/2 mice, the beta-noradrenergic antagonist propranolol has been reported to powerfully release BSEs. In C57BL/6 mice, 10 and 15 mg/kg propanolol weakly released BSEs; fewer than 3 per hour occurred. Hence neither possibilities 3 and 4 are sufficient in themselves to explain the lack of BSEs during waking in C57BL/6 mice. However, simultaneous administration of 10 mg/kg propranolol and 20 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol provoked numerous BSEs in C57BL/6 mice. This suggests that perhaps C57BL/6 mice, as compared to DBA/2 mice, possess both a more powerful noradrenergic mechanism to suppress spindles and a more weakly functioning mechanism to activate BSEs. Hence possibilities 3 and 4 may both be correct.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "With the increasing popularity of breast feeding, the secretion of drugs in breast milk would be of clinical interest. The merits of breast feeding and the composition of breast milk are outlined. The pharmacokinetics of drugs in breast milk may be described by a 3-compartment open model, with breast milk being the third compartment--a deep compartment with limited capacity. Recent clinical studies on secretion of atenolol, propranolol, propoxyphene, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid in breast milk showed that the infant ingested dose was insignificant. Thus, nursing mothers on these drug therapies should be allowed to breast feed their infants. Owing to the lack of adequate clinical data and methodology for studying the secretion of antidepressants in breast milk, there is a need for a sensitive assay. Thus, a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography assay of imipramine and desipramine in breast milk was outlined, with sensitivity of 5 micrograms per liter. With the instrumentational capability of most clinical laboratories, it would be possible to perform drug levels measurement in breast milk. In collaboration with other clinicians, a useful data base could be accumulated for making rational decisions on breast feeding for mothers on drug therapy.", 
    "4": "The natural course of angle recession in a previously traumatized eye and its relationship to the development of glaucoma is still not well defined. Two cases of late-onset glaucoma occurring some 19 and 23 years after the initial contusion injuries to the eye are described. Medical therapy alone was inadequate, and surgical intervention was required in both cases. Life-long follow-up is indicated in patients with significant angle injury following trauma.", 
    "5": "The effects of aspirin (75 mg orally/average-size cat) and propranolol (5 mg orally every 8 hours/average-size cat) alone and in combination on hemostatic determinants in healthy cats were studied. In cats, aspirin alone did not cause a significant effect in platelet numbers, plasma fibrinogen, activated partial thromboblastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, or platelet aggregation response to adenosine diphosphate. Aspirin did, however, significantly reduce the degree of aggregation induced by acid soluble collagen. Propranolol alone or in combination with aspirin did not cause a significant effect on platelet numbers, plasma fibrinogen, activated partial thromboblastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, or platelet aggregation in response to acid soluble collagen, adenosine diphosphate, or adrenaline. It was concluded that aspirin alone at the recommended dosage of one-quarter of a 5-grain tablet (1.25 grains or 75 mg) every other day will significantly affect platelet function and may be of value in the prevention of thromboembolic disease in the cat.", 
    "6": "Male Long-Evans rats were kindled via daily electrical stimulation of the left prepyriform cortex. The animals were then used in two experiments which examined the pharmacological basis of cocaine's effects on three mutually exclusive components of the kindled seizure, which were the following: (a) latency to clonus, (b) clonus duration, and (c) duration of AD outlasting clonus. The first experiment compared the effects produced by cocaine HCl (20 mg/kg, IP), lidocaine HCl (20 mg/kg, IP), and amphetamine sulfate (2.5 mg/kg, IP). The results indicated that both cocaine and lidocaine reduced the duration of kindled AD, latency to clonus, and duration of AD persisting beyond clonus, thus suggesting that these cocaine effects are mediated by local anesthetic mechanisms. Only cocaine reduced clonus duration, which suggests that this cocaine effect is not produced by a local anesthetic action. The second experiment examined the effects of cocaine following the administration of three dose levels of the monoamine antagonists haloperidol, prazosin, yohimbine, propranolol, or metergoline (selected for their ability to block dopamine, alpha-1-norepinephrine, alpha-2-norepinephrine, beta-norepinephrine, and serotonin receptors, respectively). The results of this experiment found no support for a monoaminergic contribution to cocaine's effect on clonus latency or AD after clonus. However, results for prazosin, which reduced clonus duration and exhibited an additive effect with cocaine on this variable, suggest that cocaine's norepinephrine action (especially on the alpha-norepinephrine systems) may modulate clonus duration.", 
    "7": "Episodes of depression and acute psychosis in two patients receiving propranolol hydrochloride are described, and the literature on propranolol-induced depression and psychosis is reviewed. A 42-year-old woman developed severe depression, marked apathy, social withdrawal, and anorexia after taking propranolol hydrochloride (80 mg/day) for three months to control her hypertension. Five days after the dose was reduced to 40 mg/day, there was a major improvement in her depressive symptoms, with a complete resolution in eight days. Upon rechallenge with 80 mg/day of propranolol, she again experienced depressive symptoms. Atenolol 50 mg/day was substituted for the propranolol therapy, and she exhibited a complete remission of her depression. The second patient was a 63-year-old man who had been taking propranolol hydrochloride 160 mg/day for three months without incident. Because of an increased frequency of anginal attacks, the dosage was increased to 240 mg/day. Within two days, he demonstrated such agitation, excitement, and combativeness that he had to be controlled with a 25-mg dose of methotrimeprazine. When the propranolol dose was reduced to 160 mg/day, his psychotic symptoms rapidly cleared. However, when the dose was subsequently increased to 200 mg/day, he again showed increased agitation. After substituting atenolol 100 mg/day for propranolol, the patient's mental status returned to normal. Both of these patients experienced symptoms that were temporarily associated with propranolol. Both patients were subsequently controlled without symptoms with atenolol therapy. Propranolol is a highly lipophilic beta blocker that achieves high concentrations in the brain. When continued beta-blocking therapy is necessary or beta blockade is indicated, a weakly lipophilic agent such as atenolol is indicated.", 
    "8": "The prophylactic anti-migraine effect of the serotonin antagonist pizotifen and the beta 1-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol was compared in a double-blind cross-over study. The dosage of pizotifen was 0.5 mg t.i.d. and that of metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. Thirty-five patients with classical or common migraine were included in the investigation. Five patients withdrew during the course of the study; four because of side effects (three on pizotifen, one on metoprolol) and one because of unassociated illness. The results show that there was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between metoprolol and pizotifen. The tolerance, especially regarding weight gain, was the major drawback with pizotifen, while metoprolol was generally well tolerated.", 
    "9": "Pulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) was calculated in 49 mongrel dogs weighing 18-20 kg during mechanical ventilation, before and during deliberate hypotension with either nifedipine (group N), diltiazem (group D), labetalol (group L), or ethyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol (group E). A 30 per cent decrease in mean arterial blood pressure occurred after two minutes of nifedipine infusion, two minutes after diltiazem, and three minutes after labetalol; these effects lasted two hours after nifedipine administration, 90 minutes after diltiazem and three hours after labetalol. There was an accompanying significant decrease in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Qs/Qt and cardiac output increased significantly after nifedipine infusion. Shunt increased (mean +/- S.E.) from 9.7 +/- 0.8 to 18.25 +/- 1.05 per cent at two minutes (p less than 0.0005); 19.05 +/- 1.2 per cent at 30 minutes (p less than 0.005); 17.5 +/- 1.6 per cent at two hours (p less than 0.01); and 12 +/- 1.1 per cent at three hours (p less than 0.025). No increase in shunt occurred after the administration of diltiazem, labetalol or polyethylene glycol and ethyl alcohol. Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) decreased significantly after nifedipine infusion from 146 +/- 11.5 to 105 +/- 3.5 mmHg two minutes after infusion; to 89.5 +/- 3 mmHg 30 minutes after; 115 +/- 4.75 mmHg two hours after; and 130 +/- 10.75 mmHg three hours later. PaO2 was not significantly different after diltiazem, labetalol, or polyethylene glycol and ethyl alcohol administration. With nifedipine cardiac output increased from 2.25 +/- 0.3 to 3.95 +/- 0.25 after two minutes (p less than 0.005) to 3.85 +/- 0.35 after 30 minutes (p less than 0.005), 3.7 +/- 3 after two hours (p less than 0.01) to 2.9 +/- 1.1 after three hours. No significant increase in cardiac output occurred in groups D or L. These results suggest that only nifedipine infusion significantly alters oxygenation in dogs and therefore its use warrants caution in the presence of a preexisting abnormal Qs/Qt.", 
    "10": "A comparative study of the responses of the gastrointestinal tract of the guinea-pig and of the fruit-eating bat Eidolon helvum to transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) was made. The stomach and rectum of the guinea-pig, the bat and the guinea-pig ileum contracted in response to TNS. These contractions were cholinergic in nature because atropine blocked and physostigmine potentiated them. Tetrodotoxin reversibly abolished these contractions suggesting that they were nerve-mediated. The bat isolated ileum usually responded to TNS with mixed motor and inhibitory components. In some cases, there were only motor or inhibitory components. The motor component was abolished by atropine and potentiated by physostigmine. However, the inhibitory component was non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic (NANC). Tetrodotoxin abolished the motor component without influencing the inhibitory components. Periarterial nerve stimulation of the bat ileum produced a relaxation that was blocked by bretylium, propranolol, phentolamine, reserpine and tetrodotoxin. It is concluded that the bat gastrointestinal smooth muscle, like the guinea-pig, has cholinergic excitatory innervation; however, the bat ileum has both a cholinergic excitatory innervation and a nonadrenergic and non-cholinergic inhibitory component.", 
    "11": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether or not the respiratory epithelium can modulate the responsiveness of bronchial smooth muscle. Paired rings of canine bronchi (4-6 mm OD), in some of which the epithelium had been removed mechanically (by rubbing the luminal surface), were mounted in physiological saline solution, gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2, and maintained at 37 degrees C. The presence or absence of the epithelium was confirmed by histological examination. Removal of the epithelium increased the contractile responses evoked by acetylcholine, histamine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Transmural nerve stimulation evoked similar peak responses in the presence and absence of epithelium. In unrubbed preparations, the peak response was followed by a gradual decrease when the stimulation was continued. This decrease, which persisted in the presence of propranolol, was not observed in epithelium-denuded preparations. In bronchial rings contracted with acetylcholine, isoproterenol produced concentration-dependent relaxations which were significantly greater in rings with epithelium compared with denuded rings. These results suggest that respiratory epithelial cells may generate an inhibitory signal to decrease the responsiveness of bronchial smooth muscle to contractile agonists and augment the effectiveness of inhibitory stimuli.", 
    "12": "In vitro experiments have shown that the antiarrhythmic effects of propafenone are due to a direct depressant action and to a beta-blocking activity. In this study a method was used to evaluate the direct effect and the autonomically mediated actions of an antiarrhythmic agent in a clinical setting. An electrophysiological study was performed twice, at an interval of 24 hr, in 17 patients (age: 52 +/- 17 years) with normal resting and intrinsic heart rate. In the first study the overall effect of intravenous propafenone (1.5-2 mg/kg) was evaluated by comparing the sinus node parameters obtained during the basal state and after drug administration. In the second study the direct depressant effect of the drug was evaluated by comparing the electrophysiological variables obtained following autonomic blockade (propranolol 0.2 mg/kg and atropine 0.04 mg/kg) and after propafenone. In the first study there was no significant change in the sinus cycle length and corrected sinus node recovery time and only a small (9.1%) increase in sinuatrial conduction time, whereas in the second study these variables increased significantly. The degree of increase in sinus cycle length and corrected sinus node recovery time was significantly higher in the second study than in the first one. These data suggest that: (1) propafenone has direct depressant effect on sinus automaticity but this effect is counteracted by autonomically mediated actions (most likely of vagolytic type); (2) the beta-blocking effect of the drug demonstrated in isolated atria is not seen in a clinical setting.", 
    "13": "The effects of endogenous epinephrine (E), released by glucagon injection, and exogenously infused E on plasma norepinephrine (NE) and cardiovascular responses before and after beta-blockade were studied in patients with essential hypertension and in age-matched normotensive controls. The resting plasma NE and E levels were significantly higher in the borderline hypertensive subjects (NE: 251 +/- 21 pg/ml [SEM], p less than 0.005; E: 57 +/- 5, p less than 0.05, n = 18) than in controls (NE: 129 +/- 12; E: 39 +/- 5, n = 18). An intravenous injection of glucagon (1.0 mg) induced a transient rise of both plasma catecholamine levels and blood pressure in every subject studied. Plasma E levels rose transiently and returned to the basal levels by 20 minutes after the injection, whereas plasma NE levels showed a more prolonged rise over 20 minutes. beta-Blockade with propranolol did not affect the plasma E response to glucagon, but inhibited the prolonged rise of plasma NE levels. An intravenous infusion of exogenous E (1.25-1.50 micrograms/min) for 30 minutes caused an apparent rise of both plasma NE levels and blood pressure, which lasted more than 60 minutes after stopping the E infusion. Propranolol did not affect the time course of plasma E but again inhibited the prolonged rise of both plasma NE levels and blood pressure. No significant differences could be observed in the cardiovascular or plasma NE responses to glucagon or to E infusion between normal and hypertensive subjects. These findings lend support to the view that plasma E can act physiologically as a sustained stimulator of presynaptic beta-adrenergic receptors, which leads to an enhanced NE release from peripheral sympathetic nerve terminals and a rise of blood pressure in humans.", 
    "14": "Quinidine was combined with propranolol to restore sinus rhythm in cases of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) in 42 patients. The treatment was started with propranolol and quinidine at a test oral dose of 10 mg and 0.2 g, respectively, thereafter a dose of 0.4 g of quinidine and 10 mg of propranolol every two hours was added. The procedure was stopped when sinus rhythm was achieved, or when the administered quinidine reached the total dose of 1.6 g. Sinus rhythm was restored in 37 patients. The side effects were gastrointestinal disorders in 16 patients, atypical ventricular tachycardia in one case, and embolism of the left femoral artery in another patient.", 
    "15": "In 587 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and no previous MI, electrocardiographically estimated infarct size was related to 1- and 2-year mortality. The overall mortality was higher in patients with transmural MI (Q- or R-wave changes in standard ECG) than in patients with subendocardial infarction (ST-T-wave changes in standard ECG) after 1 year (18.8% compared to 6.5% p less than 0.001) and after 2 years (22.2% compared to 13.8%, p = 0.049). When patients who were alive during primary hospitalization were analyzed separately, slightly higher mortality was found in patients with transmural MI than in subendocardial MI after 1 year (9.6% compared to 4.2%, p = 0.076) while no difference was found after 2 years (13.4% as compared to 11.7%, p greater than 0.2). In a subgroup of patients with anterior MI, precordial mapping with 24 chest leads was analyzed 4 days after arrival in hospital (n = 197). Patients were divided into quartiles according to the sum of R waves, the sum of Q waves, and the number of Q waves. There was a similar overall mortality in each quartile after 1 year and after 2 years regardless of ECG parameters studied. Neither did we find any correlation between the sum of R waves in leads II, III, and aVF on the fourth day in patients with inferior MI and overall 1- or 2-year mortality rate, although there was a trend towards higher mortality with more ECG changes.",

Two drops of timolol 0.5% had been instilled into the conjunctival sac 12-71 minutes before operation.

    "17": "Cardiac lymph, collected from conscious dogs, was monitored for glycogen phosphorylase and creatine kinase (CK) enzymatic activity during control state, circumflex coronary artery (CFX) occlusion, and reperfusion. CFX occlusions, lasting for intervals as short as 10 min, initiated a release of phosphorylase and CK into the cardiac lymph, which was immediately observed during reperfusion of the ischemic tissue. Blood plasma levels did not appear for several hours. In the absence of reperfusion, the appearance of enzymes in cardiac lymph was delayed and peaked later. Glycogen phosphorylase and CK entered the lymph in greater quantities with reperfusion as the length of occlusion was increased. Histological examination of multiple sections of the reperfused hearts showed infarcts in hearts where CFX occlusions lasted 20 min or longer; occlusions of 10-15 min showed evidence of cell injury and death in two hearts and no definable infarct in the majority. Ischemic intervals of short duration release functionally active glycogen phosphorylase and CK, which reflect changes in myocardial cell egress of macromolecules and/or cell death.", 
    "18": "The direct effects of alinidine (N-allyl-clonidine) on the sinus node and atrioventricular (AV) junction were studied in 18 anesthetized dogs. Stimulus frequency-response curves to right stellate ganglion and right cervical vagus stimulations as well as responses to norepinephrine or acetylcholine were determined before and after selective perfusion of alinidine into the sinus node artery. Alinidine (1 microgram/ml) had no effect on spontaneous sinus rate [148 +/- 5 (SE) beats/min]. However, alinidine concentrations of 5, 10, and 25 micrograms/ml produced significant (P less than 0.05) sinus slowing to 138, 127, and 121 beats/min, respectively. Recovery to control rate was dose dependent and took from 4 to 33 min. Sinus rate increases with right stellate stimulations were not affected by alinidine. However, sinus rate decreases with right vagal stimulations were significantly (P less than 0.01) attenuated by alinidine. The negative chronotropic effects of acetylcholine were not influenced by alinidine. Alinidine (1-100 micrograms/ml into AV node artery) had no effect on the A-H interval of the His bundle electrogram. However, alinidine (10 and 25 micrograms/ml) diminished the AV block produced by stimulation of the left vagus in electrically paced hearts but not the negative dromotropic actions of directly administered acetylcholine. Thus alinidine has direct negative chronotropic effects, no effect on sinus node responses to sympathetic stimulation, ability to diminish sinus node and AV junctional responses to vagal stimulations without interference at the cholinergic muscarinic receptor, and 4) no effect on AV nodal conduction.", 
    "19": "To determine the comparative effectiveness and hemodynamic effects of long-term oral treatment with propranolol alone and combined with nifedipine in patients with stable angina pectoris, 20 patients with coronary disease were studied by equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography. Measurements were performed at rest and during supine bicycle exercise before treatment, after 4 weeks on propranolol, 1 hour after institution of combined propranolol and nifedipine treatment, and after 4 weeks on the combined treatment. The reduction in exercise rate-pressure product induced by the combination (17.2 +/- 2.6 X 10(3)) was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) than that attained by propranolol alone (19.3 +/- 2.8 X 10(3)). In patients at rest, neither propranolol nor the combined therapy altered global left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF). Without drugs and on propranolol, exercise EF decreased significantly. On the combined therapy there was a significant improvement in exercise EF compared both with rest values (p less than 0.01) and with exercise EF on propranolol (p less than 0.001). Exercise tolerance, expressed as total work load, significantly increased on propranolol and further increased on combined therapy. Thus the combined propranolol/nifedipine therapy in patients with stable angina proved to be hemodynamically superior to therapy with propranolol alone and safe even in patients with moderately depressed LV function.", 
    "20": "The effect of dl-, d- and I-sotalol on electrophysiologic characteristics of guinea-pig papillary muscles, sheep and rabbit Purkinje fibers was studied. Standard electrophysiologic and voltage clamp techniques were used. At concentrations between 10(-6) and 10(-4) M, the main effect of sotalol consisted of prolongation of the action potential duration. In voltage clamp experiments this effect correlated with a substantial reduction of the time-dependent K current activated during the plateau of the action potential and a small reduction of the background K current. At concentrations above 10(-4) M, a secondary shortening of the action potential concomitant with a fall in maximal rate of depolarization was seen. In voltage clamp experiments this effect correlated with a decrease of a slowly inactivating Na current. In the absence of catecholamines d- and I-sotalol exerted identical effects on action potentials and voltage clamp currents.", 
    "21": "To examine the interaction between normal and nonischemic areas of the left ventricle during acute ischemia, we implanted midwall ultrasonic segment length gauges in the ischemic zone and in nonischemic areas of the canine left ventricle. During acute ischemia, end-diastolic pressure and segment length in the nonischemic areas increased. There was no change from control in the segment length at the time of aortic valve opening and closure. Thus, in nonischemic areas, total segment shortening, as measured by the percent change in segment length from the time of end-diastole to aortic valve closure, increased. This was due to an increase in isovolumic shortening (end-diastole to aortic valve opening) with no change in ejection shortening (aortic valve opening to closure). The progressive increase in isovolumic shortening in nonischemic areas over time was directly paralleled by the progressive development of the isovolumic lengthening or bulge in the ischemic zone. Nonischemic areas, whether adjacent, on the opposite wall, or distant to the ischemic zone, all behaved similarly. Adrenergic blockade did not qualitatively alter these findings. We conclude that acute ischemia induces a mechanical disadvantage which is greater than just the loss of contractile function by the ischemic segment. Despite the apparent hyperfunction of nonischemic areas, the increased total segment shortening is expended in stretching the ischemic zone during isovolumic systole. As a result, there is no significant \"compensatory\" increase in ejection shortening in nonischemic areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "The effects of abrupt withdrawal of atenolol, a long acting cardioselective beta blocker, were studied in 20 patients with severe stable angina pectoris admitted to hospital for coronary arteriography. During the 144 hour postwithdrawal period no serious coronary events occurred. Mean and maximal daily heart rates rose steadily for at least 120 hours. No important arrhythmias were noted on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Treadmill exercise testing at 120 hours showed little reduction in the times to angina, ST depression, and maximal exercise when compared with those recorded at 24 hours. This deterioration was small when contrasted with the improvements in these indices produced by atenolol treatment in a similar group of patients not admitted to hospital. No change in catecholamine concentrations or acceleration of the heart rate response to exercise occurred after atenolol withdrawal, suggesting that rebound adrenergic stimulation or hypersensitivity was absent or insignificant. Catastrophic coronary events after beta blockade withdrawal (the beta blockade withdrawal syndrome) have occurred almost exclusively in patients taking propranolol, many of whom had unstable angina at the time of withdrawal. This study showed that in patients with stable angina, even when severe, the abrupt withdrawal of atenolol can be expected to result in only minor clinical consequences. The risk to any patient of so called rebound events after withdrawal of beta blockade seems to be related to both the clinical setting and the agent being used.", 
    "23": "The P line of alcohol-preferring rats drink pharmacologically significant amounts of ethanol when given free choice between a 10 percent ethanol solution and water. Serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitors and desipramine, a norepinephrine (NE) uptake inhibitor, were found to significantly reduce their ethanol consumption for up to 24 hours after intraperitoneal injection. To determine if this effect of 5-HT uptake inhibitors could be altered by receptor antagonists, some of which are short acting, P rats were trained to drink ethanol by free choice during scheduled availability, with ethanol being presented one hour every four hours during the light cycle. The majority of the ethanol was consumed during the first hour of availability, and the ethanol intake was significantly reduced by the 5-HT uptake inhibitors, fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. Pretreatment with antagonists for 5-HT1, 5-HT2 and alpha- and beta-NE receptor systems failed to alter the fluvoxamine attenuation of ethanol intake. The mechanism by which 5-HT uptake inhibitors alter ethanol preference remains unclear.", 
    "24": "A new method is introduced to recognize the acute pulmonary effect of airborne contaminants in guinea pigs. The method avoids anaesthesia and invasive techniques and requires minimal restraint of the animal. To recognize the acute pulmonary effect, the inspiratory volume of the animal was increased by continuous inhalation of a mixture containing 10% CO2 in 18% O2 and 72% N2. Once a plateau increase in inspiratory volume was reached, the aerosol to be studied was added to this mixture and its effect in reducing inspiratory volume measured. By exposing the animals to different exposure concentrations of carbamylcholine, serotonin and propranolol aerosols, concentration-response relationships were obtained which permitted comparison of their potency. Comparisons were also made with histamine and sulfuric acid aerosols previously studied.", 
    "25": "Metoprolol, a beta 1 blocking agent, is being used with increasing frequency during pregnancy for treatment of disorders such as hypertension or beta-mimetic induced tachycardia. Since it is well documented that beta-blocking agents are able to cross the placenta, the question arises whether these drugs have any adverse effect on the fetal metabolic or cardiovascular system. It was the aim of this animal experimental study to investigate the following questions: 1. Does metoprolol exert a negative influence on fetal metabolic and cardiovascular functions during normoxia? 2. Is the fetal reaction to an acute short period of hypoxemia altered by metoprolol? To answer these questions, experiments were carried out in 6 pregnant sheep at 110-130 days of gestation. In 8 experiments metoprolol was infused into a fetal vein in increasing dosage (0,04-0,32 mg/min). In a second series of experiments (n = 8), an acute hypoxemia was induced by complete reduction of uterine blood flow for 1 minute, and the results obtained with or without metoprolol were compared. Metoprolol does not exert a negative influence on fetal oxygenation, acid-base balance, lactate concentration and blood pressure, although the metoprolol concentration measured in fetal plasma was relatively high (two - to threefold above therapeutic metoprolol levels). Thus, definitive adverse effects on the fetus induced by metoprolol are not recognizable. The fetal sympathoadrenal reaction to an acute hypoxemia, as measured by the concentration of the free catecholamines epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine in the fetal plasma, is also unchanged by metoprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "The adenine derivatives adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine (AD), in concentrations of 10(-3)M and 10(-4)M caused significant and dose-related modifications in the basal acid secretion from isolated whole rat stomach. The first three purine derivatives, ATP, ADP and AMP significantly increased the spontaneous acid secretion. On the other hand, AD caused a significant reduction in the basal acid secretion. When ATP, ADP, AMP and AD were assayed in the presence of the adrenergic and cholinergic blocking agents, ergotamine, 10(-6)M, propranolol, 5 X 10(-7)M and atropine, 10(-6)M, all these purine derivatives, including AD, caused a significant increase in the basal acid secretion.", 
    "27": "To asses haemodynamic effects of short and long term amiodarone on ischaemia-induced left ventricular dysfunction and to compare them with those of glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin), beta-blocking and calcium antagonist drugs, 19 patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease were studied. All patients underwent simultaneous right heart catheterisation and equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography at rest and during symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise. After control measurements without antianginal therapy, 10 patients received 7.5 mg/kg amiodarone intravenously over 5 minutes (short term study) followed by oral administration of amiodarone for 3 weeks (long term study). The remaining 9 patients were studied following the randomised administration of glyceryl trinitrate (0.8 mg sublingually), metoprolol (0.15 mg/kg intravenously) and nifedipine (5 ng/kg/min). During exercise known to provoke angina pectoris without therapy (control study), amiodarone improved myocardial oxygen consumption by reducing heart rate and systolic blood pressure without the negative inotropic effects seen after acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Comparisons with the haemodynamic profiles of other antianginal drugs suggest that amiodarone may be most effective when combined with glyceryl trinitrate or nifedipine for the treatment of ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "28": "The effect on plasma apoproteins A-I and B and HDL cholesterol subfractions of acebutolol given orally over a 6-month period to 18 patients with essential hypertension was studied. The concentration of apoprotein A-I decreased during acebutolol treatment: statistical significance was reached at 3 (p less than 0.05) and 6 months (p less than 0.01). The level of apoprotein B increased slightly but not significantly. The ratio of apo A-I to apo B decreased significantly during acebutolol treatment. The concentration of total HDL cholesterol tended to be slightly but not significantly higher during therapy than before it. This increase was due to the increase of HDL3 cholesterol and this increase was significant (p less than 0.05) at 3 months. The level of HDL2 cholesterol did not change significantly during acebutolol therapy.", 
    "29": "Indocyanine green estimated apparent liver blood flow was measured in normal volunteers following glyceryl trinitrate, propranolol, isosorbide mononitrate and captopril. Glyceryl trinitrate and propranolol significantly reduced apparent liver blood flow. Isosorbide mononitrate did not alter apparent liver blood flow or produce an additional reduction in apparent liver blood flow when combined with propranolol. Captopril did not alter apparent liver blood flow despite a significant fall in mean arterial pressure and rise in plasma renin activity. Captopril and isosorbide mononitrate if shown to reduce portal pressure, do so without a fall in apparent liver blood flow.", 
    "30": "Circulating concentrations of total and free thyroid hormones and thyroid hormone binding proteins were measured in thyrotoxic and euthyroid subjects treated with propranolol. In the thyrotoxic group, total triiodothyronine (T3) concentration fell after propranolol therapy, suggesting an effect of the drug on the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3. In euthyroid subjects, a rise in circulating concentrations of free T4 and reverse T3 (rT3) was observed, while only a small decrease in free T3 was evident. Thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) concentration fell during propranolol treatment while thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA) concentration rose. The changes observed in the euthyroid state are consistent with inhibition of peripheral deiodination of T4 and rT3; an additional effect of propranolol on binding protein metabolism was evident.", 
    "31": "The antihypertensive effect of oral labetalol and propranolol were evaluated in 65 black and 75 white patients with mild to moderate hypertension (standing diastolic blood pressure (StDBP) of 90-115 mmHg) in a double-blind multicenter clinical trial. Following a 4-week placebo phase, labetalol (n = 70) or propranolol (n = 70) was randomly assigned. During a 5-week titration phase, labetalol could be increased from 100 mg BID to 600 mg BID to achieve a StDBP of less than 90 mmHg and a decrement of greater than or equal to 10 mmHg. Propranolol could be titrated from 40 to 240 mg BID. A 3-month maintenance phase was followed by an optional 8-month maintenance phase. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) could be added at any time during the maintenance phase. Supine and standing blood pressures were measured at each visit. Statistical analysis revealed significant (ANOVA, p less than 0.05) treatment by race effects. Therefore, the treatment groups were stratified retrospectively by race. This study demonstrated that labetalol is equally effective in white and black patients, whereas, propranolol is significantly (p less than 0.05) more effective in white than in black patients. Moreover, labetalol is significantly more effective than propranolol in lowering the standing systolic/diastolic blood pressure of black patients (p less than 0.02/p less than 0.001). These blood-pressure effects were accompanied by a significantly greater (p less than 0.04) reduction in heart rate with propranolol. Furthermore, significantly more (p less than 0.05) black patients treated with propranolol compared to those treated with labetalol required the addition of a diuretic for control of their blood pressure.", 
    "32": "A double blind randomized study of 800 patients was carried out to determine if very early intervention with metoprolol (15 mg I.V. followed by oral administration) in suspected acute myocardial infarction affected overall mortality in selected subgroups, (age, site of infarct, delay to intervention). Sudden death occurred less frequently in patients allocated to metoprolol but there was no significant difference in total mortality on discharge, at three months and at twelve months. Ventricular fibrillation after intervention was not significantly reduced. Adverse reactions did not occur significantly more frequently in patients assigned to metoprolol.", 
    "33": "The present experiments were undertaken to examine the involvement of prostaglandins and intrarenal beta-adrenergic system in captopril-induced renin release using conscious dogs. In a first series of experiments, plasma renin activity (PRA) increased 2.5- to 5.2-fold after captopril (1 mg/kg, i.v.) administration. When the same dose of captopril was given in indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.v.)-pretreated animals, PRA similarly increased. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were unchanged throughout the experiment in both non- and indomethacin-pretreated animals. In a second series of experiments, captopril-induced PRA elevation was observed under the condition of propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.)-pretreatment, although propranolol reduced base line PRA. Statistical analysis did not give a definite evidence that propranolol inhibits captopril-induced renin release. MAP and HR were not changed by captopril in propranolol-pretreated animals as well as in non-pretreated animals. These results suggest that prostaglandins and a real functional interaction with the beta-adrenergic system are not involved in the captopril-induced renin release in conscious dogs.", 
    "34": "This heterogeneous group of immunologic causes of pleural effusions includes connective tissue diseases, a syndrome related to tissue injury (postcardiac injury syndrome), a disease of unknown etiology (sarcoidosis), a malignancy, and adverse reactions to drugs. Except in rheumatoid pleurisy and lupus pleuritis, the pleural fluid findings are either nonspecific or have not been characterized fully. The clinical presentation is essential in the presumptive diagnosis of these causes of pleural effusions.", 
    "35": "A randomised double-blind parallel group study was performed to compare the clinical efficacy of bepridil, a new calcium slow channel blocker, with that of propranolol and placebo in patients with chronic stable angina of effort. Efficacy was assessed objectively by dynamic exercise testing using an upright bicycle ergometer and subjectively by patient documentation of anginal frequency and nitrate consumption. The administration of bepridil resulted in a significant improvement in physical work capacity expressed as calculated maximal oxygen uptake (Vo2 max) and exercise time. This was associated with subjective improvement in terms of reduced anginal frequency. Despite baseline differences in exercise performance and anginal frequency between the three treatment groups, the beneficial effects of bepridil were statistically significant when compared to propranolol. Although minor electrocardiographic changes were noted, no adverse effects were evident when bepridil was prescribed in doses of up to 400 mg/day over a 10 week period.", 
    "36": "Thirty-one patients aged 65 y or over suffering from moderate hypertension were studied for 16 weeks using a cross-over design in which metoprolol 100 mg daily and metoprolol 200 mg daily were compared. Both treatment regimes were effective in controlling hypertension and no difference was found between the two with regard to efficacy. The 100 mg regime was, however, better tolerated and we propose this as the preferred metoprolol dose for the aged hypertensive.", 
    "37": "Levobunolol hydrochloride (0.5% and 1%) and timolol maleate (0.5%) are being compared in an ongoing, double-masked, randomized study of 141 patients with ocular hypertension or chronic open-angle glaucoma. Baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) in the three treatment groups ranged from 26 to 27 mm Hg. During the first 15 months of the study, the two drugs have not proved to be significantly different in ocular hypotensive efficacy, with overall mean IOP decreases of 6.8 to 7.6 mm Hg. In addition, the two concentrations of levobunolol have been equally effective in controlling IOP. Neither drug has been associated with any significant ocular side effects. Both drugs have produced significant decreases (five to ten beats per minute) in mean heart rate. The effect on mean blood pressure has been less pronounced: overall decreases have been less than 4 mm Hg for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The results of this ongoing study suggest that levobunolol is as effective and as safe as timolol for the long-term control of IOP.", 
    "38": "The ocular hypotensive effect and the safety of levobunolol hydrochloride (0.5% and 1%) were compared with vehicle in this double-masked study of 42 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. After a washout of ocular hypotensive medication, patients received one of the three test treatments in both eyes twice daily for three months. Both concentrations of levobunolol produced significant reductions in intraocular pressure, while decreases in vehicle-treated patients were minimal. Over the three-month study period, average pressure reductions were approximately 9.0 mm Hg in patients receiving either concentration of levobunolol and 0.5 mm Hg in patients receiving vehicle. Fewer patients were terminated from the study for inadequately controlled intraocular pressure in the levobunolol groups than in the vehicle group. No patients were terminated for drug-related adverse experiences.", 
    "39": "Twenty eight patients were randomly allocated into treatment or placebo groups. The treatment group received a single 400 mg oral dose of acebutolol, the placebo group an identical inert prepation. A blood sample from each patient was subsequently analysed for plasma concentrations of acebutolol and diacetolol, and the electrocardiogram was continuously monitored for changes of rate and rhythm. The plasma concentrations of acebutolol and diacetolol were all above the previously reported minimum levels for effective dysrhythmia control and the nine patients in whom irregularities of rhythm occurred were all in the placebo group. One patient in the treatment group, who was 58 years old, required intravenous injection of atropine for bradycardia and hypotension after induction of anaesthesia. It is suggested that in patients with small body weights and in those patients over 50 years of age the predmedication dose of acebutolol should be reduced to 200 mg.", 
    "40": "The clinical and hemodynamic effects of propranolol, propranolol-verapamil (P-V), propranolol-nifedipine (P-N) and propranolol-diltiazem (P-D) were studied in 19 patients with chronic exertional angina pectoris. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, crossover study design was used in which patients took each treatment for a 4-week period. The 3 combinations equally reduced the incidence of angina attacks and decreased ST-segment depression. Left ventricular hypokinesia during exercise was lessened and end-systolic volume during exercise decreased with all combinations. Because of a corresponding reduction of normokinetic segmental function, global ejection fraction during exercise remained unchanged. Heart size increased (p less than 0.05) and the PR interval lengthened (p less than 0.001) with P-V and P-D compared to P-N. The largest number of adverse clinical reactions occurred with P-V, whereas the fewest occurred with P-D. Almost all patients preferred combined therapy over propranolol and many favored 1 combination over the others. In summary, when therapy with combined beta- and calcium channel-blocking drugs is planned, P-D should be considered the combination of first choice because of its low incidence of adverse clinical effects. In the presence of possible or definite abnormalities of atrioventricular nodal conduction or decreased left ventricular function, P-N should be considered. Although P-V is associated with frequent adverse reactions, a trial may be warranted if the other combinations are unsuccessful.", 
    "41": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in 12 patients with chronic and stable effort angina to study the antianginal and anti-ischemic actions of a single dose of molsidomine in addition to long-term therapy with a long-acting beta-adrenergic blocker (100 mg of atenolol daily). Efficacy was assessed by means of objective endpoints obtained by computer-assisted exercise testing. The mean exercise time to produce angina improved significantly from 330 +/- 38 seconds (mean +/- SEM) in patients after administration of atenolol and placebo to 420 +/- 36 seconds after administration of atenolol and molsidomine. Similar significant improvements were seen in ST segment changes at an identical exercise duration, in maximal heart rate, and in maximal exercise duration. The increased anginal threshold and the reduced ischemic changes were not explained by changes in the rate-pressure product at submaximal levels. Thus molsidomine showed antianginal and anti-ischemic efficacy in the treatment of stable effort angina additional to the effect of long-term therapy with beta-adrenergic blockers.", 
    "42": "The efficacy of captopril treatment was compared with that of propranolol in a single-blind crossover study in 14 patients with essential hypertension uncontrolled on diuretic alone. Both captopril (37.5 to 75 mg daily) and propranolol (60 to 120 mg daily), in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg daily), caused a significant fall in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Heart rate, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone data were consistent with the effects of converting enzyme inhibition or beta blockade. Both drugs were well tolerated. Captopril appeared to be equivalent in efficacy and safety to propranolol when added to hydrochlorothiazide. It may be considered as an alternative step 2 antihypertensive agent, especially in patients experiencing unwanted effects on beta blockers.", 
    "43": "In insulin-deprived alloxan-induced diabetic dogs with severe hyperglycemia and marked hyperglucagonemia, glucagon was not suppressed by intravenous infusion of glucose at a progressively increasing rate up to 24 mg/kg of body weight per min. However, when the hyperglycemia was corrected by phloridzin, a blocker of renal tubular glucose reabsorption, the hyperglucagonemia was readily suppressed by as little as 2 mg of glucose per kg/min. Direct perfusion of phloridzin into the isolated pancreas of nondiabetic dogs had no effect on the in vitro glucagon response to increments in glucose. However, in pancreata isolated from dogs whose glucose levels had been lowered by phloridzin pretreatment, in vitro glucagon suppression in response to glucose increments was more than twice that of controls. This enhancing effect of phloridzin treatment was completely abolished by giving an intravenous infusion of glucose for the 5 hr prior to surgery for isolation of the pancreas. It is concluded that (i) alpha cells have a glucose-sensing system that is independent of insulin and beta cells, and (ii) this system is reversibly attenuated by hyperglycemia. Thus, hyperglycemia, a metabolic consequence of islet cell dysfunction, may be a self-exacerbating inducer of further islet cell dysfunction, a possibility with implications for human diabetes.", 
    "44": "One hundred consecutive patients hospitalized in the coronary care unit for unstable angina, excluding patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina, were randomized within 24 hours of admission to treatment with diltiazem (50 patients) or propranolol (50 patients). Also excluded were patients with previous coronary artery bypass surgery and those receiving a beta-receptor blocking agent at the time of hospital admission. Left ventricular function and the extent of coronary artery disease were similar in the two groups. During the hospital stay, the number of chest pain episodes decreased from a mean (+/- SD) of 0.75 +/- 0.1 per patient per day to 0.26 +/- 0.07 (p less than 0.05) with diltiazem and 0.29 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.05) with propranolol therapy. The circadian distribution of chest pain episodes was affected similarly. After 1 month, 14 of the patients treated with diltiazem were symptom-free compared with 13 treated with propranolol. At a mean follow-up time of 5.1 months (range 1 to 15), death had occurred in two patients in each group and myocardial infarction in five diltiazem- and four propranolol-treated patients (difference not significant). Coronary artery bypass surgery had been performed in 21 diltiazem- and 19 propranolol-treated patients (difference not significant). Only 15 patients were symptom-free, 9 treated with diltiazem and 6 with propranolol. This similar result observed with the two forms of treatment suggests that coronary artery spasm may not be the main factor involved in unstable angina when Prinzmetal's variant angina is excluded. It also suggests that diltiazem can be used as an alternative to the usual treatment with beta-receptor blocking drugs.", 
    "45": "In frogs, positive inotropic effects are transmitted catecholaminergically as they have been blocked with propranolol but not with atropine. Positive chronotropic effects were in some experiments blocked with atropine and not with propranolol (a \"cholinergic type\" of of positive chronotropic effect), the opposite occurred in other experiments (an \"adrenergic type\"). The cholinergic positive chronotropic effects were observed with the initial slow heart rate and were accompanied by negative inotropic effects; the chronotropic effect itself appeared suddenly (with no gradual acceleration of heart rate) and disappeared just as suddenly. The adrenergic effects, on the contrary, were observed with the initial rapid heart rate; they were accompanied by positive inotropic effects and developed and disappeared gradually.", 
    "46": "After aorta-coronary bypass grafting, 164 consecutive patients were randomized to receive propranolol 5 mg every 6 hours orally (n = 82) or to serve as control subjects (n = 82). All patients were receiving beta blockers preoperatively. There were no significant differences between the two groups. The incidence of sustained supraventricular (nonsinus) tachyarrhythmias was 23% in the control group and 9.8% in the treated group (p = 0.02). The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias was 15% in the control group and 2.4% in the treated group (p = 0.005). The overall difference in clinically important arrhythmias was 38% in the control group and 12.2% in the treated group (p = 0.0002). We conclude that low-dose oral propranolol in patients who were receiving beta blockers preoperatively is effective in reducing the incidence of clinically important arrhythmias occurring after aorta-coronary bypass grafting.", 
    "47": "It may be possible to develop new contraceptives that can be administered by mouth and will exert their effects after concentration in cervico-vaginal mucus. D-Propranolol was administered in 80 mg doses by mouth to six healthy female volunteers. Samples of blood plasma and cervico-vaginal mucus were obtained before and on six occasions up to 24 hours after drug ingestion. D-Propranolol was concentrated in cervico-vaginal mucus. No changes in blood pressure, pulse, or forced expiratory peak flow (FEPF) were observed.", 
    "48": "Anaprilin pharmacodynamics was studied in thyrotoxicosis patients. The clinical therapeutic effect of anaprilin, mercazolyl and their combinations was studied. In anaprilin therapy the drug should be individually dosed out with regard to its basal concentration in the blood and the degree of pulse retardation at rest. An adequate anaprilin dose for most patients was 160 mg/day. Anaprilin-mercazolyl combined therapy resulted in more retarded pulse as compared to a single drug therapy with anaprilin. The effect of anaprilin was potentiated by mercazolyl doses which did not by themselves cause a positive cardiovascular effect in the first two weeks of therapy.", 
    "49": "Heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), coronary sinus blood flow (CSF), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), mean arterial (MAP), and coronary arteriovenous difference for oxygen (AVDcO2) were measured in patients with stable angina pectoris without cardiac failure before and 40 to 60 minutes after administration of 2 or 3 mg of molsidomine. In 20 patients these measurements were made in basal state during spontaneous rhythm. In eight of these patients (including three receiving beta blockers) the measurements were made during atrial pacing. In eight other patients, all receiving long-term beta-blocker therapy, the measurements were made during cold pressor test. At the basal state in spontaneous rhythm, a gradual reduction in the LVSP to 70% or less of its initial value was observed in four patients receiving 3 mg of molsidomine (two of whom received beta-blocker treatment). The LVSP was immediately restored by vascular filling. In the 16 other patients molsidomine decreased LVSP, LVEDP, MAP, CO, and double product (DP = LVSP X HR). The AVDcO2 was unchanged. CSF and myocardial oxygen uptake index (MVO2 = CSF X AVDcO2) were decreased. During atrial pacing, hemodynamic and coronary effects were similar to those seen in the basal state. During the cold pressor test, the increases in LVSP, MAP, and LVEDP were significantly reduced by molsidomine. The variations in CSF and coronary resistance (MAP/CSF) were also significantly different after administration of molsidomine, with better metabolic regulation of the coronary circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Fifteen consecutive patients (mean age 54 years) with proven coronary heart disease were studied with radionuclide ventriculography. After resting and exercise control studies, repeat studies were performed after administration of 4 mg of molsidomine sublingually and again after administration of 10 mg of metoprolol intravenously. Rest to exercise ejection fraction (EF) decreased significantly. This was significantly attenuated by molsidomine and by metoprolol. In a subset of nine patients with exercise ischemia, EF showed significant (p less than 0.05) improvement after molsidomine administration (46.7 +/- 13.7% to 57.1 +/- 16.7%), which was diminished to 54.4 +/- 10.5% after metoprolol administration. In the subgroup without exercise ischemia, molsidomine increased the EF to a lesser extent (47.3 +/- 12.7% to 52.6 +/- 13.4%, p less than 0.05). After administration of metoprolol the EF decreased below the control level (44.4 +/- 10.6%). Regional Fourier amplitudes accentuated the differences between the two groups. We conclude that molsidomine and metoprolol improve left ventricular function in patients with coronary heart disease and ischemia during exercise. In patients with reduced left ventricular function without signs of ischemia, molsidomine improves function as well and should be used additionally, if beta blockers are indicated for other reasons.", 
    "51": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are commonly used for the management of hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and angina pectoris; several of these agents are now available for clinical use (1-5). A significant side effect of these agents in patients experiencing reversible airway obstruction is that they block the effects of beta-adrenergic agonists and can precipitate or worsen bronchospasm (6-8). Labetalol, a new adrenergic antagonist with both alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking effects, has been shown to have certain advantages for the management of hypertension and is widely used for this purpose in many countries (9). To evaluate its effects on airway resistance in patients with obstructive lung disease, the authors conducted two separate clinical studies. This article summarizes the results of these trials.", 
    "52": "Fifty-two asthmatic patients with mild to moderate hypertension were screened for bronchosensitivity to propranolol in a double-blind randomized fashion after a 2-week minimum placebo run-in period. Thirty-five patients qualified on the basis of a decrease in 1-second forced expiratory volume FEV1 by greater than or equal to 20% after 80 mg of propranolol with no more than a +/- 15% change after placebo. Of these patients, 18 were then randomly assigned to antihypertensive treatment with labetalol at doses that were increased at weekly intervals (100, 200, 400, 600 mg BID) and 17, with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (25 or 50 mg BID) as needed for control of hypertension. At each placebo washout visit and at each of the four active drug-treatment phase visits, spirometric measurements were obtained just prior to the morning dose of medication and again 2 hours later on the initial visit (i.e., following the initial dose of active treatment) and on each visit when the dosage was increased. Neither HCTZ nor labetalol (average daily doses at the end of the study were 88 and 555 mg, respectively) caused bronchoconstriction: Mean FEV1 did not change from the baseline neither prior to the morning dose (evaluation of the \"chronic\" treatment effect) nor 2 hours after dosing (evaluation of \"acute\" treatment effect). Three patients in each treatment group reported increased dyspnea and two on labetalol and one on HCTZ had increased wheezing; the mean weekly isoproterenol usage per patients was similar for the two treatments (1.3 times/week/pt for labetalol and 1.6 times/week/pt for HCTZ).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Convenience of medicine-taking and lack of side effects are two major factors that favor compliance. Using a simple and convenient once-a-day regimen of minoxidil, nadolol, and chlorthalidone, we treated successfully 30 patients with moderate to severe hypertension. All patients were previously taking at least three medications, usually three to four times a day. Treatment was started with nadolol (160 mg) and chlorthalidone (50 mg) once daily. If diastolic blood pressure remained above 90 mmHg, minoxidil was added at a starting dose of 2.5 mg/day and increased weekly until blood pressure was controlled or the maximum dose of 100 mg/day was reached. The average blood pressure decreased from 170.9/107.0 mmHg (sitting) and 174.1/110.8 mmHg (standing), before the addition of minoxidil, to 138.8/86.7 mmHg (sitting) and 140.0/89.5 mmHg (standing), at the third month of minoxidil therapy. At the sixth month of minoxidil therapy, the figures were 140.9/86.3 and 141.9/89.8 mmHg. With this single-dose program, smooth blood pressure control throughout 24 hours was documented by 24-hour ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring. Hypertrichosis was common but was bothersome only to women patients. Pericardial effusions occurred in five patients, but they were all small and asymptomatic. Subjective side effects of the regimen were usually so mild that all patients who completed the study decided to remain on the same regimen.", 
    "54": "The contractile and relaxant effects of drugs which interact with adreno- and muscarinic receptors were investigated in isolated tissue from the human corpus cavernosum urethrae (CC) and the cavernous artery (Acc). Isolated CC preparations were contracted in a concentration-dependent fashion by noradrenaline (NA), phenylephrine and clonidine in the mentioned order of potency. Prazosin was 300 times more active than rauwolscine in inhibiting NA-induced contractions. In segments of the isolated Acc, clonidine was more potent than NA and phenylephrine, and prazosin and rauwolscine were about equieffective in inhibiting NA-induced contractions. Prazosin was more effective than rauwolscine in CC strips, and rauwolscine more effective than prazosin in Acc segments in inhibiting the noradrenergically mediated part of electrically induced contractions. Isoprenaline, prenalterol and procaterol each relaxed NA-contracted CC preparations in a concentration-dependent way; this effect was blocked by propranolol. Isoprenaline had no relaxant action in Acc segments. Neither acetylcholine (ACh) nor carbachol produced contraction in CC and Acc preparations. ACh, but particularly carbachol, had potent relaxant effects in NA-contracted CC preparations. This effect of ACh and carbachol was blocked by scopolamine. Relaxant, but less potent effects of the muscarinic receptor agonists were found in the Acc segments. It is suggested that there are important differences between penile arteries and erectile tissue proper in the response to adrenoreceptor and muscarinic receptor active drugs. The contractile effect of NA seems to be mediated mainly by alpha 1-adrenoreceptors in the CC and by alpha 2-adrenoreceptors in the Acc. It cannot be excluded that muscarinic receptor-mediated relaxation of NA-contracted CC preparations can be of importance for penile tumescence and erection.", 
    "55": "The effect of beta-endorphin (beta-END) and the role of the adrenal and thyroid glands on body temperature were examined in male rats in a controlled environment room at 24.5 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Relative humidity of 50 +/- 0.3% and a 12L:12D photoperiod (L = 0900 to 2100 hr) were maintained. Rectal temperature (Tr) was measured using thermistors. Corticosterone and thyroid hormones were determined by radioimmunoassay. Intracerebroventricular (IVT) administration of varying doses (0.05 to 50.0 micrograms) of beta-END resulted in a hyperthermia that began 30 min post-IVT injection and continued for an additional hour. Intravenous injections of the same doses of beta-END resulted in little or no Tr response. The beta-END-induced hyperthermia was antagonized by intraperitoneal injection of naloxone. Pretreatment with propranolol, phenotolamine, or both drugs in combination did not block the hyperthermia caused by beta-END. Adrenalectomized or hypophysectomized rats receiving IVT injections of beta-END did not consistently display an increased Tr. beta-Endorphin administration had no detectable effect on serum corticosterone or thyroxine but serum triiodothyronine was decreased. These data suggest the acute hyperthermic action of beta-END is mediated centrally through opiate receptors and does not involve adrenergic receptors.", 
    "56": "A possible relationship between pancreatic islet blood flow (IBF) and the diabetogenic action of streptozotocin (STZ) has been investigated in rats injected ip with saline, glucose, propranolol, phentolamine, yohimbine, or adrenaline. A low dose (25 mg/kg BW) of STZ was given iv 10 min later, and serum glucose concentrations were determined after 3 and 7 days. Measurements of IBF were performed in separate experiments with a microsphere technique 10 min after injection of the drugs. Administration of phentolamine, glucose, or yohimbine was followed by overt diabetes, whereas animals injected with saline, adrenaline, or propranolol failed to become diabetics. Blood flow measurements showed an increase in IBF 10 min after the injection of glucose or propranolol, while there were no significant effects of the other drugs. It is concluded that changes in IBF are of minor importance for the action of agents modulating the diabetogenic effect of STZ. However, the potentiated hyperglycemic effects by glucose, phentolamine, or yohimbine in combination with STZ seemed to coincide with increased insulin secretion, as reflected by elevated serum insulin concentrations at the time of STZ administration.",

Twelve physically active men were examined during 25 min of continuous cycle exercise equivalent to 65% of their maximal oxygen uptake both with and without oral administration of 80 mg of propranolol (Inderal). Heart rate, oxygen uptake, rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and blood lactate concentration were measured during exercise. Muscle biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis after 5 and 25 min of exercise. Beta-adrenergic blockade decreased steady state exercise heart rate by (mean +/- SD) 35 +/- 10 beats . min-1 (P less than 0.001) and oxygen uptake from 2.47 to 2.39 l . min-1 (P less than 0.01). Muscle glycogen decreased from the 5th to the 25th min of exercise, and beta-blockade had no significant effect on this decrease. In contrast to without drug, beta-blockade resulted in a decrease (P less than 0.05) in muscle lactate concentration from the 5th (6.9 mmol . kg-1 w./w.) to the 25th min (4.8 mmol . kg-1 w./w.). Similarly blood lactate levels were lower (P less than 0.05) with than without beta-blockade in the last but not the first 10 min of exercise. The alteration in muscle lactate concentration pattern following beta-blockade, may imply that adrenergic effects per se contribute to the stimulation of glycolysis during submaximal exercise, except in its earliest phase. Nevertheless, the effect is not great enough to produce substantial differences in glycogen utilization.", 
    "58": "Cardiac sarcolemmal membranes were isolated from the rat heart and their ability for Na+-Ca2+ exchange in the absence or presence of diltiazem and verapamil was examined. Maximal Ca2+ influx activity of membranes due to Na+-dependent reaction occurred within 3 min and was about 5 nmol Ca2+/mg protein. Diltiazem (0.1 to 10 microM) depressed the Ca2+ influx activity significantly whereas verapamil (0.1 to 10 microM) had no effect at initial stages of the reaction (10 to 20 sec). The inhibitory effect of diltiazem on Ca2+ influx was found to be of an uncompetitive nature. Sodium was found to cause a rapid Ca2+ efflux from the calcium loaded membrane vesicles; about 70% of the Ca2+ efflux activity was increased by 0.1 to 10 microM of verapamil and 10 microM of diltiazem significantly. The stimulatory effect of these agents on Ca2+ efflux was associated with a change in Ka value from 16 to 5 mM Na+. Both diltiazem (0.1-3 microM) and verapamil (0.1-10 microM) did not affect the membrane Na+-K+ ATPase activity, but diltiazem in high concentrations (10-30 microM) had an inhibitory action. Specific calcium channel blocking agents, nitrendipine and nifedipine, depressed sodium-dependent Ca2+-efflux activity. A beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, propranolol, unlike acebutolol, increased sodium-induced Ca2+-influx at high concentrations (10-100 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "Viable lymphocytes were used to investigate the binding of physiological concentrations of hormones and therapeutic concentrations of anti-asthmatic drugs to [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA, beta antagonist) and [3H]prazosin (alpha antagonist) receptor sites. All studied drugs and hormones inhibited the specific binding of prazosin to receptors identified with 10(-4)M phentolamine. Similar concentrations of drugs and hormones, with the exception of prostaglandin F2 alpha and cimetidine, inhibited the specific binding of DHA to lymphocyte receptors identified with 10(-7)M propranolol. These results confirm current mechanisms of hormone and drug action in asthma.", 
    "60": "The effect of cardiac hypertrophy on beta-adrenergic receptor density and affinity was studied under 4 experimental conditions: in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), in the 2K-1C renal hypertensive rat (RHR), and following subcutaneous infusions of 2 pressor agents; epinephrine (E) and angiotensin II(AII). Using the antagonist 3H-dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]-DHA), the number of binding sites was shown to significantly decrease at both 13 and 24 weeks of age in the SHR when compared to age-matched WKY, with no change in affinity. In the RHR a significant increase in binding sites was observed at both 6 and 10 weeks after clipping, returning towards normal levels following removal of the clipped kidney. Cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension were induced by subcutaneous infusions for up to 2 weeks of both E and AII. E caused an alteration in receptor density, causing a significant decrease with no change in affinity. In contradistinction, although the degree of hypertrophy was the same following AII, no changes in receptor density or affinity were seen. These present experiments confirm our hypothesis that different models of hypertensive hypertrophy are associated with varying changes in beta-adrenergic receptors. This suggests that any consequential changes in myocardial function may be a result of other post receptor mechanisms.", 
    "61": "A case of ventricular tachycardia in a healthy child subsequent to onset of a succinylcholine infusion is described. A 9-year-old male patient was scheduled for an adenoidectomy and bilateral tonsillectomies. There was no history of cardiac arrhythmia. Anesthesia was induced by mask with nitrous oxide and halothane. Immediately after the infusion of 20 mg of succinylcholine, the heart rate was 150 beats/min and then the electrocardiograph (ECG) revealed a short run of ventricular tachycardia. The patient was given 1 mg of propranolol, and enflurane and 100% oxygen were administered. Soon after the propranolol was given, normal sinus rhythm returned. Ventricular tachycardia may occur after a single dose of succinylcholine in a healthy anesthetized child without predisposing disease.", 
    "62": "The contributions of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor mechanisms to epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia, to prandial hepatic glycogenolysis, and to epinephrine-induced inhibition of feeding were investigated in rats, because epinephrine's hyperglycemic and anorectic effect might be related to each other. Intraperitoneal injection of the selective alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine (0.5 mg/kg body weight) but not of the selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (0.5 mg/kg body weight) reduced the hyperglycemic effect of a subsequent epinephrine injection (0.05 mg/kg body weight). In addition, injection of phentolamine (0.5 mg/kg b.w.) or injection of phentolamine plus propranolol (0.5 mg/kg b.w. each) similarly inhibited epinephrine-induced hepatic glycogenolysis. In contrast, phentolamine injection did not affect prandial hepatic glycogenolysis. Neither phentolamine nor propranolol injection was sufficient to affect the inhibition of feeding induced by subsequent epinephrine injection, but the combination of both receptor blockers completely abolished epinephrine's effect on food intake. These findings are not consistent with the idea that epinephrine-induced hypophagia is related to epinephrine's effect on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, the data suggest that catecholamines are not the main contributors to prandial hepatic glycogenolysis in rats.", 
    "63": "Cytosolic proteins binding specifically the progesterone analogue 3H R5020 can be detected in various areas of the central nervous system (CNS) of rat. Our study demonstrates that the concentration of progesterone receptors in the brain of adult, ovariectomized, female rats is maximal in frontal cortex and midbrain and lowest in the cerebellum. Short term administration of the hormone does not alter the beta-adrenergic receptor system, while a prolonged administration of progesterone results in an up-regulation of 3H-DHA binding in the frontal cortex. Such increase in binding activity is due to an increased number of beta-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, high doses of progesterone can also increase the number of beta-adrenergic binding sites in an \"in vitro\" system where brain slices are incubated for few hours in a physiological medium.", 
    "64": "Following a subcutaneous injection of isoprenaline into rats (5 mg X kg-1 b.w.) the cardiac glycogen stores were depleted by about 90% in less than 15 min. Complete restoration of myocardial glycogen was slow (more than 7-8 hours) despite an elevated glycogen synthase activity. A cardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (using atenolol) resulted in a complete restoration of glycogen stores in 30 min. The results indicate that the potential of myocardial tissue for glycogenogenesis is great but this capability is obscured by continuous glycogenolysis induced by a long-term activation of phosphorylase. The relative importance of beta-receptor stimulation and actual glycogen level in the control of cardiac synthase is discussed.", 
    "65": "A rapid and transient decrease in 2'-phosphodiesterase activity in NIH 3T3 mouse cells was observed after adrenaline addition. The decrease of activity was accompanied by an elevation of intracellular cAMP level. The 2'-phosphodiesterase activity changed similarly when cells sink deeper into the resting state. In the latter case, the fall of the enzyme activity was correlated with elevation of the activity of cAMP-dependent proteinkinase and, moreover, a considerable increase of the intracellular level of 2',5'-oligoadenylate was observed. Phosphorylation of proteins by cAMP-dependent proteinkinase in the cell lysate also produced a pronounced drop of 2'-phosphodiesterase activity. Exogenous 2',5'-oligo (A) treatment of the cells resulted in the rise of 2'-phosphodiesterase activity; actinomycin D prevented this effect. The data presented suggest the involvement of two different mechanisms in regulation of 2'-phosphodiesterase activity: cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and induction of 2'-phosphodiesterase by 2',5'-oligoadenylate.", 
    "66": "The chronic treatment of rats with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol causes a double increase in the amount of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cardiac membranes. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the effect of propranolol on the activity and regulatory properties of rat heart adenylate cyclase. Propranolol injections to rats for 3 weeks (10-20 mg/l kg bw) did not influence the enzyme basal activity but caused a rise of a degree of myocardial adenylate cyclase activation by isoproterenol and glucagon.", 
    "67": "Chronic treatment with the antidepressants imipramine or nomifensine, or the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) agents, baclofen or THIP, produced a decrease in the Bmax for binding sites of GABAergic and noradrenergic receptors. Chronic treatment with imipramine or nomifensine produced a decrease in the Bmax of both binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]GABA receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic treatment with baclofen or THIP also produced a decrease in the Bmax of binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol receptor in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These results suggest a possible link between the GABAergic and noradrenergic systems, which may be important in understanding the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs, and suggests a possible role for GABA in affective disorders.", 
    "68": "Responses of the isolated vas deferens of the rat to clonidine (inhibition of contractions to field stimulation at 0.1 Hz) and noradrenaline (contraction of longitudinal muscle) were determined after one or 21 daily injections of the animals with desmethylimipramine, clorgyline, selegiline or tranylcypromine. Desmethylimipramine (10 mg kg-1) and clorgyline (2 mg kg-1) increased the clonidine EC50 in the isolated vas deferens after 21 but not after one daily injection(s). Tranylcypromine (5 mg kg-1) increased clonidine EC50 after both one and 21 injections and selegiline (1 mg kg-1) did not affect clonidine EC50 after either one or 21 injections. Only desmethylimipramine had a significant effect on noradrenaline responsiveness, producing an inconsistent decrease in EC50 with a consistent increase in maximum contractile response after 21 but not after one daily injection(s). Clorgyline (10(-5) M) increased the contractile response of the isolated vas deferens to field stimulation and antagonized the inhibitory effect of clonidine when added directly to the isolated tissue preparation. Neither clorgyline (5 mg kg-1), selegiline (1 mg kg-1) nor tranylcypromine (2.5 mg kg-1) affected significantly the inhibitory response to clonidine (1 microgram kg-1) on contractions of in situ sympathetically stimulated vas deferens in pithed rats. These results show that down-regulation of alpha 2-presynaptic adrenoceptors by chronic treatment with desmethylimipramine and clorgyline occurs in peripheral organs as well as in the central nervous system.", 
    "69": "We compared the effects of methionine enkephalin and leucine enkephalin on contractions of isolated canine tracheal smooth muscle strips induced by field electrical stimulation (ES) and exogenous acetylcholine (approximately 10(-5) M). Methionine and leucine enkephalin (10(-8) to 10(-5) M), when added at the peak of airway contractions induced by ES at 1 Hz, depressed the contractions in a concentration-dependent manner by a maximum of 95 and 99%, respectively. Acetylcholine-induced contractions of similar magnitude were depressed only 4% by methionine enkephalin and 12% by leucine enkephalin. Frequency-response curves (0.5-20 Hz) were also obtained before and after incubation of tracheal strips with 10(-5) M methionine and leucine enkephalin. Enkephalin depressed contractions induced by stimulation at 0.5 and 1 Hz by an average of 98 and 95%, respectively. The inhibitory effect of enkephalin progressively decreased at successively higher stimulus frequencies until at 20 Hz there was no significant difference between airway contractions obtained in the presence and absence of enkephalin. Naloxone (3 X 10(-5) M) antagonized the inhibitory effects of both enkephalins. We conclude that methionine and leucine enkephalins inhibit the release of acetylcholine from the postganglionic parasympathetic neurons that innervate airway smooth muscle.", 
    "70": "Rats were treated with electroconvulsive shock (ECS), desmethylimipramine (DMI), ECS plus DMI, or diazepam. In vitro analyses showed that chronic ECS produced an elevated density of recognition sites for [3H]imipramine (IMI) in platelet membranes, but had no effect on membrane preparations derived from cortical tissue. A similar elevation in receptor binding was seen exclusively in platelets after chronic ECS plus DMI, whereas no effect was observed with DMI alone. Equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values for [3H]IMI were also increased in platelet membranes from rats given chronic ECS or ECS plus DMI treatment. Chronic ECS or DMI administration produced a decreased density of beta-adrenergic recognition sites in frontal cortex and cerebellum as assessed by [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding. The combination of ECS plus DMI produced a similar decrease. In addition, chronic diazepam administration produced a down-regulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor only in the cerebellum. These data provide evidence for the differential regulation of brain and peripheral neurotransmitter recognition sites.", 
    "71": "Sucrose feeding has been shown previously to alter the plasma concentration of several factors which may regulate beta-adrenergic receptors, including corticosteroids and insulin as well as altered sympathetic nervous system (SNS) tone. For this reason we initiated a study of the effects of sucrose feeding on the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system in rat liver plasma membranes. Beta-Adrenergic responsiveness was monitored by measuring isoproterenol stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, while beta-adrenergic receptor characteristics were evaluated by analyzing [125I]iodocyanopindolol [( 125I]CYP) binding. Rats fed rat chow ad lib. supplemented by drinking water containing 10% sucrose solution exhibited a 50-75% reduction in hepatic isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity. This effect of sucrose was also observed in adrenalectomized (ADX) and 6-hydroxydopamine-pretreated animals, ruling out a causal role for corticosteroids or the sympathetic nervous system respectively. No effect was observed on basal, glucagon-, fluoride- or GTP-stimulated adenylate cyclase. A small but significant decrease in [125I]CYP specific binding capacity was observed in liver membranes prepared from sucrose-fed ADX rats, whereas no change in [125I]CYP binding capacity was observed in in sucrose-fed normal rats. These observations suggest that beta-receptor to adenylate cyclase coupling efficiency is decreased by the sucrose diet. The activities of two membrane-associated phospholipid methyltransferases and the content of endogenous S-adenosylmethionine in liver were reduced by sucrose feeding, implying a defect in the methylation pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis. The possible relationship between this latter finding and the observed decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor to adenylate cyclase coupling efficiency is discussed.", 
    "72": "Estradiol-17 beta (E2) produces vasodilation in several systemic vascular beds, but most extensively in the nonpregnant uterus. It has been postulated that E2 induces this vasodilation via blockade of vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors. This hypothesis was tested in six chronically instrumented, nonpregnant sheep by comparing the systemic and uterine hemodynamic responses to intravenous E2, to an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker, phentolamine, and to both agents given together. Uterine blood flow (UBF) increased significantly after E2 administration, from 20 +/- 7 to 233 +/- 37 (SE) ml/min. In contrast, phentolamine had no detectable effect on UBF or on the UBF response to E2 when both were given together. Similar contrasting responses were observed in the effects of E2 and/or phentolamine on the systemic vasculature. When responses to alpha-agonists were evaluated, there was no evidence of alpha-blockade following E2 despite the substantial vasodilation; in contrast, alpha-blockade was present during phentolamine administration when no vasodilation was noted. Therefore, we conclude that E2-induced vasodilation in chronically instrumented sheep is not mediated through blockade of vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "73": "The effects of serotonin (5-HT), histamine (H), and norepinephrine (NE) on bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAE) and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSM) movement were quantitated using a phagokinetic tracking assay. BAE movement was significantly reduced by 5-HT (31%), H (48%), and NE (62%) at concentrations ranging from 10(-10) to 10(-4) M (P less than 0.01). VSM motility was significantly enhanced by 5-HT (17%) and H (25%) at concentrations of 10(-8) and 10(-4)M, respectively (P less than 0.01). NE (10(-4)M) reduced VSM motility by 63% (P less than 0.01). Ketanserin (1 microM) reduced the 5-HT-associated inhibition of BAE movement by 75% (P less than 0.01). Diphenhydramine (1 microM) reduced the H-associated inhibition of BAE movement by 66% (P less than 0.01). Propranolol (1 microM) reduced NE-associated inhibition of BAE movement by 50% (P less than 0.01) and 5-HT-associated inhibition by 45% (P less than 0.05), but phenoxybenzamine had no significant effect. The results suggest 1) BAE and VSM are affected qualitatively in opposite ways by 5-HT and H; 2) the H-associated inhibition of BAE movement appears to be at least partially mediated by H1 receptors; 3) the 5-HT-associated inhibition of BAE movement may be mediated directly by a 5-HT binding component but indirectly by beta-adrenergic receptors; and 4) the NE-associated inhibition of BAE movement appears to be mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "74": "The chronic use of propranolol is characterized by 10%-20% decrements of renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The results of most investigations, however, suggest that the use of nadolol, a long-acting nonselective agent, spares renal function. Similarly, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA)-positive and cardioselective beta-adrenergic inhibitors and the combined alpha-beta blocker, labetalol, appear to preserve renal hemodynamics. The reason(s) for the apparent disparate effects of various beta blockers is uncertain. The pathophysiological mechanisms are probably multifactorial and relate to either diminished cardiac output or increased renal vascular resistance, or both. It is possible that inhibition of renal vasodilator mechanisms plays a role. The explanation for the relative absence of adverse effects with a given medication probably varies from agent to agent. The clinical implications of beta-blocker-induced renal changes are presently unknown. The alterations are probably not clinically important in patients with normal renal function. In patients with underlying renal insufficiency, there is no reason to avoid the use of beta-adrenoceptor blockers. In some patients, however, one may wish to prescribe those beta blockers that tend to spare RPF and GFR.", 
    "75": "The institution of a \"Cardioprophylactic\" drug regimen after myocardial infarction should take into consideration the concept of high or low risk patients for secondary coronary events and the concept of a decremential mortality rate as time elapses after myocardial infarction. Thus, the efficacy of a particular drug in preventing secondary coronary events may vary with the time elapsed from infarction and thus with the underlying patho-physiologic mechanism. Furthermore, the administration of a possible effective or proven effective \"Cardioprophylactic\" drug or drug regimen at a specific time from infarction must take into account the balance between expected benefit and untoward side effects.", 
    "76": "The influence of alpha and beta adrenoceptor blockers on the cardio-respiratory effects of cow's urine concoction (CUC) in rats was studied. The study showed that phenoxybenzamine abolished the pressor response observed in the untreated animal while propranolol had no effect on blood pressure response. The alpha-blocked animals also developed significant post-injection hypotension. Electrocardiographic abnormalities seen in the control group were ameliorated by beta-blockers but alpha-blockers had no such effect. CUC caused an initial depression of respiration with short apnoeic phases and an increase in pulmonary ventilation. The latter was significantly decreased by alpha and beta adrenoceptor blockers. It was concluded that adrenoceptors play an important role in the cardio-respiratory effects of CUC."
