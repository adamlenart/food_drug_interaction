Patients were classified into two groups: Group I received oral atenolol 50 mg twice one day before surgery; and Group II received placebo tablets identical in appearance to atenolol tablets for the same period and interval. All patients in both the groups received intraoperative sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as a hypotensive agent. Hemodynamic variables, amount of sodium nitroprusside used, quality of surgical field, and the amount of homologous blood transfusion and blood loss were compared between groups.",

    "4": "Sickness behavior is a cluster of symptoms that occur as a response to an infection and alterations in the inflammatory response. Under normal circumstances, sickness behavior is fully reversible once the pathogen has been cleared. Aging and chronic illness such as heart failure are associated with enhanced inflammatory activity that lasts for a long duration and no longer represents an adaptive response. The aim of this study was to explore whether inflammation mediates the relationship between impaired cardiac function and a symptom cluster including anhedonia, fatigue, and sleepiness, which might represent sickness behavior in community-dwelling elders. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the factor impaired cardiac function (i.e., N-terminal fragment of pro-brain natriuretic peptide, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the heart failure medications angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blockade, \u03b2-blocker, and diuretics) was associated with both inflammation (i.e., C-reactive protein; \u03b2 = .26) and the symptom cluster (\u03b2 = .31). Inflammation had a significant direct, but smaller, association with the symptom cluster (\u03b2 = .21). By this pathway, inflammation also mediated an indirect association between impaired cardiac function and the symptom cluster (\u03b2 = .05). Including creatinine, blood glucose, ischemic heart disease, previous and current tumor, respiratory disease, age, and body mass index in the SEM model did not change these associations. Our results imply that some aspects of the symptom panorama in elderly individuals with impaired cardiac function or heart failure could represent sickness behavior.", 
    "5": "Intravital microscopy of the pulmonary microcirculation in research animals is of great scientific interest for its utility in identifying regional changes in pulmonary microcirculatory blood flow. Although feasibility studies have been reported, the pulmonary window can be further refined into a practical tool for pharmaceutical research and drug development. We have established a method to visualize and quantify dynamic changes in three key features of lung function: microvascular red blood cell velocity, flow direction, and hemoglobin saturation. These physiological parameters were measured in an acute closed-chest pulmonary window, which allows real-time images to be captured by fluorescence and multispectral absorption microscopy; images were subsequently quantified using computerized analysis. We validated the model by quantifying changes in microcirculatory blood flow and hemoglobin saturation in two ways: 1) after changes in inspired oxygen content and 2) after pharmacological reduction of pulmonary blood flow via treatment with the \u03b21 adrenergic receptor blocker metoprolol. This robust and relatively simple system facilitates pulmonary intravital microscopy in laboratory rats for pharmacological and physiological research.", 
    "6": "Based on the investigation of the effect of microemulsion charge on the chiral separation, a new chiral separation method with MEEKC employing neutral microemulsion was established. The method used a microemulsion containing 3.0% (w/v) neutral surfactant Tween 20 and 0.8% (w/v, 30 mM) dibutyl l-tartrate in 40 mM sodium tetraborate buffer to separate the enantiomers of \u03b2-blockers. The effect of major parameters on the chiral separation was investigated. The applied voltage had little effect on the resolution, but the chiral separation could be improved by suppressing the EOF. Nine racemic \u03b2-blockers obtained relatively good enantioseparation after appropriate concentrations of tetradecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide were added into the microemulsion to suppress the EOF. These results were explained based on the analysis of the separation mechanism of the method and deduced separation equations. The resolution equation of the method was further elucidated. It was found that the fourth term in the resolution equation, an additional term compared to the conventional resolution equation for column chromatography, represents the ratio of the relative movement distance between the analyte and microemulsion droplets relative to the effective capillary length. It can be regarded as a correction for the effective capillary length. These findings are significant for the development of the theory of MEEKC and the development of new chiral MEEKC method.", 
    "7": "Purpose. The aim of this study was to evaluate pressure increases after intravitreal injections (IVI) and the interest in using prophylactic pressure-lowering medications. \u2029Methods. This was a prospective study of 250 anti-vascular endothelial growth factor IVI (ranibizumab) divided into 5 groups of 50 IVI (group 1: no intraocular pressure [IOP]-lowering medication; group 2: apraclonidine 1%; group 3: acetazolamide; group 4: fixed association brimonidine + timolol; group 5: fixed association dorzolamide + timolol). The IOP was measured before, immediately after (T1), 15 minutes after (T15), and 45 minutes after (T45) the IVI using a tonometer. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni as post hoc test if necessary.\u2029Results. The mean IOP peak in group 1 was 46.4\u00b110 mmHg at T1, 21.7\u00b110.2 mmHg at T15, and 15.4\u00b18.6 mmHg at T45. It was not correlated with axial length (r=0.04, p=0.81) or lens status (phakic vs pseudophakic: p=0.88). A mild but significant correlation was found with age (r=0.36, p=0.006). Topical medications produced a significant reduction of IOP at every time point, of around 9 mmHg at T1. The reduction in IOP obtained with acetazolamide was not significant at T1 (-1.6 mmHg, p=0.12), but became significant at T15 and T45 (p=0.011 and p=0.015). \u2029Conclusions. Intraocular pressure spike was high but transient. Topical medications, however, produced a significant reduction in IOP spike as well as in the duration of the increased pressure. It would be advisable to prevent this IOP spike, especially when procedures are repeated, notably in patients with glaucoma.", 
    "8": "We have previously shown that interleukin-6 (IL-6) has neuroprotective effect against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity. The current study aimed to reveal signal transduction pathways involved in the IL-6 neuroprotection. Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) from postnatal 8-day infant rats were exposed to IL-6 (120 ng/ml) for 8 days and stimulated with NMDA (100 \u03bcM) for 15 or 30 min. Dynamic intracellular Ca(2+) fluorescence intensity, cytosolic Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) expression, and apoptosis and necrosis in cultured CGNs were measured by laser scanning confocal microscope, real-time PCR and Western blot, and annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining, respectively. NMDA stimulation of neurons evoked an intracellular Ca(2+) overload, an upregulated expression of cPLA2, and an increase in cell death. Chronic IL-6 exposure prevented the NMDA-evoked neuronal Ca(2+) overload, cPLA2 expression upregulation, and apoptosis and necrosis. Anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody (mAb), a blocker of gp130 that is a 130-kDa signal-transducing \u03b2-subunit of IL-6 receptor complex, blocked these effects of IL-6 preventing NMDA neurotoxicity. AG490, PD98059, or LY294002, inhibitors specific for the intracellular signals, JAK, MAPK, and PI3K, respectively, partially blocked these IL-6 neuroprotective effects. Phosphorylation levels of STAT3, ERK1/2, and AKT, the downstream proteins for these enzymes of JAK, MAPK, and PI3K, respectively, were elevated by IL-6 pretreatment. The enhanced activation of STAT3, ERK1/2, and AKT by IL-6 was abolished by AG490, PD98059, and LY294002, respectively. Anti-gp130 mAb attenuated the activation of all the three detected signaling molecules. The present findings suggest that IL-6 neuroprotection is jointly mediated by the cellular signal transduction pathways, gp130-JAK-STAT3, gp130-MAPK-ERK, and gp130-PI3K-AKT.",

Report of a case of a 6-year-old boy suffering from severe uveitis, and secondary open angle glaucoma. The patient had undergone bilateral cataract surgery, two prior trabeculectomies in the left and one in the right eye. He was under systemic immunomodulation with methotrexate and cyclosporine. He presented with medically uncontrolled glaucoma, with an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 36 and 34\u00a0mmHg in the right and left eye, respectively, under maximal medical antiglaucoma therapy. TD-CPC was performed under general anesthesia, including a total of 20 spots in the right and 34 in the left eye (2,000\u00a0mW, 2\u00a0s/spot) applied in one session. Visual acuity remained stable in the right eye and deteriorated in the left eye from 0.1 to no light perception. Postoperative hypotony was present 1\u00a0month post op and IOP was 14\u00a0mmHg in the left and 17\u00a0mmHg in the right eye, respectively, in the 6-month follow-up with a topical beta-blocker. The anterior chamber was quiet in both eyes. TD-CPC was effective in the short term as IOP lowering therapy in a pediatric patient with refractory uveitic glaucoma.", 
    "11": "In the context of cross-talk between transmembrane signaling pathways, we studied the loci within the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor/G protein/adenyl cyclase system at which PKC exerts regulatory effects of peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) on isoproterenol stimulated adenyl cyclase activity in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Treatment of the cells with ONOO(-) stimulated PKC-\u03b1 activity and that subsequently increased p(38)MAPK phosphorylation. Pretreatment with Go6976 (PKC-\u03b1 inhibitor) and SB203580 (p(38)MAPK inhibitor) eliminated ONOO(-) caused inhibition on isoproterenol stimulated adenyl cyclase activity. Pretreatment with Go6976, but not SB203580, prevented ONOO(-) induced increase in PKC-\u03b1 activity. Studies using genetic inhibitors of PKC-\u03b1 (PKC-\u03b1 siRNA) and p(38)MAPK (p(38)MAPK siRNA) also corroborated the findings obtained with their pharmacological inhibitors in eliminating the attenuation of ONOO(-) effect on isoproterenol stimulated adenyl cyclase activity. This inhibitory effect of ONOO(-) was found to be eliminated upon pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin thereby pointing to a G(i) dependent mechanism. This hypothesis was reinforced by G(i)\u03b1 phosphorylation as well as by the observation of the loss of the ability of Gpp(NH)p (a measure of G(i) mediated response) to stimulate adenyl cyclase activity upon ONOO(-) treatment to the cells. We suggest the existence of a pertussis toxin sensitive G protein (G(i))-mediated mechanism in isoproterenol stimulated adenyl cyclase activity, which is regulated by PKC\u03b1-p(38)MAPK axis dependent phosphorylation of its \u03b1-subunit (G(i)\u03b1) in the pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells.", 
    "12": "The feasibility to attach plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles covalently onto 5 \u03bcm silica particles and use them as stationary phase in nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC) for interaction and oxidation studies was clarified. Before the immobilization, both epoxy silica and aldehyde-activated particles were synthesized, LDL was immobilized to the particles via its protein component and capillary columns were packed with LDL-modified silica materials. The performance of the capillary columns was tested with neutral steroids, and the column with LDL immobilized to aldehyde-activated silica was selected for further studies due to its stronger retention toward steroids. The retention factors of the steroids were used as indicators of the column stability, and the RSDs from 0.8 to 5.7% (n=12) for 168 successive runs within 14 days carried out in the same capillary column and from 0.8 to 3.6% (n=6) in three different capillaries demonstrated that the capillary column was stable and that the capillary column-to-capillary column reproducibility was good. The lifetime of LDL-modified silica stationary phase was around 14 days. The applicability of the column for the separation of steroids and \u03b2-blockers was based mainly on the hydrophobic interactions with lipids of LDL in the stationary phase. The LDL immobilized silica column was successfully exploited also in the copper-mediated in situ oxidation of LDL. The results achieved demonstrated that nano-LC with plasma LDL immobilized silica phase can be exploited as nano-biomimicking tool for interaction studies and as a microreactor for oxidation studies with low consumption of reagents and human materials.", 
    "13": "The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the influence of the mono- and divalent inorganic ions Na(+) and Ca(2+) on the sorption behavior of the monovalent organic cation metoprolol on a natural sandy sediment at pH=7. Isotherms for the beta-blocker metoprolol were obtained by sediment-water batch tests over a wide concentration range (1-100000 \u03bcg L(-1)). Concentrations of the competing inorganic ions were varied within freshwater relevant ranges. Data fitted well with the Freundlich sorption model and resulted in very similar Freundlich exponents (n=0.9), indicating slightly non-linear behavior. Results show that the influence of Ca(2+) compared to Na(+) is more pronounced. A logarithmic correlation between the Freundlich coefficient K(Fr) and the concentration or activity of the competing inorganic ions was found allowing the prediction of metoprolol sorption on the investigated sediment at different electrolyte concentrations. Additionally, the organic carbon of the sediment was completely removed for investigating the influence of organic matter on the sorption of metoprolol. The comparison between the experiments with and without organic carbon removal revealed no significant contribution of the organic carbon fraction (0.1%) to the sorption of metoprolol on the in this study investigated sediment. Results of this study will contribute to the development of predictive models for the transport of organic cations in the subsurface.",

Computational chemistry served as a tool of elucidating the underlying mechanism of molecular interactions responsible for chiral discrimination. The influence of several factors (nature and concentration of chiral auxiliary, selector-selectand ratio, pH, interaction time, etc.) over the obtained SERS spectra was assessed, followed by the construction of the chemometric model with the optimized operational conditions. The performance of the obtained semi-empirical model was established using a validation set of pure enantiomers and its intended use was demonstrated by the assessment of the enantiomeric excess of propranolol in pharmaceutical formulations (tablets) without the need of tedious and expensive chiral separation. The obtained results were also confirmed by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography.", 
    "20": "To investigate the antihypertensive effects and tolerability of aliskiren in comparison with other antihypertensive drugs and placebo in patients with hypertension, a meta-analysis was performed of studies published between 1950 and 2012. A systematic literature search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library was conducted for randomized controlled trials. Weighted mean differences and relative risk with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous and dichotomous data, respectively. In all, 14 studies with 6741 participants were included in the present meta-analysis. Nine studies included trial arms with placebo, four included angiotensin (Ang) AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs), three included Ang-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), two included calcium channel blockers (CCBs), one included a \u03b2-blocker, and one included hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). We found that aliskiren, which lowered blood pressure (BP) effectively in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, was similar to HCTZ but inferior to CCBs in BP reduction, response rates and control rates. Furthermore, aliskiren was superior to ACEIs in lowering diastolic BP (DBP), while it had similar effects to ACEIs on systolic BP (SBP) reduction, response rates and control rates. Additionally, the present meta-analysis showed the superiority of atenolol over aliskiren in DBP reduction and BP response but showed that atenolol was inferior in SBP reduction and BP control. No difference was found in the rates of therapeutic response between aliskiren and ARBs, while more patients achieved BP control with aliskiren. Further studies will be needed to determine the antihypertensive effects and tolerability of aliskiren in comparison with other antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "21": "Adrenaline and cortisol, the major stress hormones, are known for its direct control on stress response in fish. Likewise, as an important stress modifier hormone, thyroid hormone has also been implicated in stress response of fish. We tested whether the hypothesis on the phenomenon of inter-hormonal interference, a process that explains the hormonal interactions, operates in fish particularly between adrenaline, cortisol and thyroid hormones. To achieve this goal, indices of acid-base, osmotic and metabolic regulations were quantified after adrenaline challenge in propranolol pre-treated air-breathing fish (Anabas testudineus). Short-term adrenaline (10 ng g(-1)) injection for 30 min produced a rise in plasma cortisol without affecting plasma T(3) and T(4). On the contrary, blocking of adrenaline action with a non-selective blocker, propranolol (25 ng g(-1)) for 90 min reduced plasma cortisol along with plasma T(4) and that indicate a possible interference of these hormones in the absence of adrenaline challenge. Similarly, a reduction in plasma T(3) was found after adrenaline challenge in propranolol pre-treated fish and that suggests a functional synergistic interference of adrenaline with T(3). Adrenaline challenge in these fish, however, failed to abolish this propranolol effect. The remarkable systemic hypercapnia and acidosis by propranolol pre-treatment were reversed by adrenaline challenge, pointing to a direct action of adrenaline on acid-base indices probably by a mechanism which may not require \u03b2-adrenergic receptor systems. Interestingly, the prominent adrenaline-induced hyperglycemia, hyperlactemia and hyperuremea were not altered by propranolol treatment. Similarly, adrenaline challenge promoted and propranolol reduced the osmotic competencies of the gills, kidneys and liver of this fish as evident in the sodium and proton pump activities. The modified physiologic actions of adrenaline and its modified interaction with THs and cortisol in blocked fish indicate an interaction of adrenaline with cortisol and THs. Our physiologic evidences thus support the hypothesis of the phenomenon of inter-hormonal interference.",

This study aimed to investigate the functional and molecular changes of detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) in high-fat insulin resistant obese mice, focusing on the role of protein kinase C (PKC) and Ca(v)1.2 in causing bladder dysfunction. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed with high-fat diet for 10 weeks. In vitro functional responses and cystometry, as well as PKC and Ca(v)1.2 expression in bladder were evaluated. Obese mice exhibited higher body weight, epididymal fat mass, fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Carbachol (0.001-100 \u00b5M), \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene ATP (1-10 \u00b5M), KCl (1-300 mM), extracellular Ca(2+) (0.01-100 mM) and phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu; 0.001-3 \u00b5M) all produced greater DSM contractions in obese mice, which were fully reversed by the Ca(v)1.2 blocker amlodipine. Cystometry evidenced augmented frequency, non-void contractions and post-void pressure in obese mice that were also prevented by amlodipine. Metformin treatment improved the insulin sensitivity, and normalized the in vitro bladder hypercontractility and cystometric dysfunction in obese mice. The PKC inhibitor GF109203X (1 \u00b5M) also reduced the carbachol induced contractions. PKC protein expression was markedly higher in bladder tissues from obese mice, which was normalized by metformin treatment. The Ca(v)1.2 channel protein expression was not modified in any experimental group. Our findings show that Ca(v)1.2 blockade and improvement of insulin sensitization restores the enhanced PKC protein expression in bladder tissues and normalizes the overactive detrusor. It is likely that insulin resistance importantly contributes for the pathophysiology of this urological disorder in obese mice.",

Neurohormonal activation was interpreted as a necessary compensatory response to maintain cardiac contractility and systemic blood pressure. Therefore, inhibitors of neurohormonal activity (like \u03b2-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) are considered contraindicated in current PAH management guidelines. However, recent data revealed that sympathetic overstimulation is strongly related to mortality, and blockade of neurohormonal activity in experimental PAH improved survival and cardiac function.

Most of the previous studies focus on modeling and analysis the mechanism, and the characteristic of AF. But no one discusses about the prediction of the result after the drug treatment. This paper is the first study to predict whether the drug treatment for AF is active or not. In this paper, the linear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) that models the system output-input relationship by solving linear regression equations with least squares method was developed and applied to estimate the effects of pharmacological therapy on AF. Recordings (224-site bipolar recordings) of plaque electrode arrays placed on the right and left atria of pigs with sustained AF induced by rapid atrial-pacing were used to train and test the ARX models. The cardiac mapping data from twelve pigs treated with intravenous administration of antiarrhythmia drug, propafenone (PPF) or dl-sotalol (STL), was evaluated. The recordings of cardiac activity before the drug treatment were input to the model and the model output reported the estimated wavelet number of atria after the drug treatment. The results show that the predicting accuracy rate corresponding to the PPF and STL treatment was 100% and 92%, respectively. It is expected that the developed ARX model can be further extended to assist the clinical staffs to choose the effective treatments for the AF patients in the future.",

In adult fish, injection of BRL(37344) (\u03b2(3)-AR agonist) resulted in an increase in heart rate (f(H)) (~31%) while stroke volume (Sv) was reduced (-25.9%). Injection of SR(59230A) (\u03b2(3)-AR antagonist) and propranolol (\u03b2(1)/\u03b2(2)-AR antagonist) resulted in increases in dorsal aorta blood pressure (P(DA)) with differing effect on cardiac variables (f(H) and Sv). To confirm specificity of the results, BRL(37344) was injected following sequential injections of phentolamine (\u03b1(1)-AR antagonist), atropine (muscarinic antagonist), propranolol and SR(59230A). While phentolamine had no effect on BRL(37344), atropine completely abolished the influence of BRL(37344) on f(H), Sv and cardiac output (Q). In larval trout, BRL(37344) (10 and 100 \u03bcM) induced a significant concentration-dependent increase in f(H) while SR(59230A) (1 and 10 \u03bcM) and propranolol (1 and 10 \u03bcM) separately caused a significant concentration-dependent decrease. These data suggest that \u03b2(3)-ARs have an important role in regulation of cardiovascular function, and provide evidence for a potential interaction between muscarinic and adrenergic receptors in rainbow trout.",

There was little change in this rate among patients less than 65\u00a0years of age. Among those aged 65\u00a0years and older, there was a substantial increase for discontinuers, with a tripling of the average annual rate of inpatient hospitalizations from 0.45 to 1.48 (all between-group comparisons significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In this older group, both discontinuers and cases experienced more than a 20\u00a0% increase in outpatient service encounters compared to only 9\u00a0% for controls (all between-group comparisons significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

    "117": "Cognitive impairments associated with dysfunction of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are prominent in stress-related psychiatric disorders. We have shown that enhancing noradrenergic tone acutely in the rat mPFC facilitated extra-dimensional (ED) set-shifting on the attentional set-shifting test (AST), whereas chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) impaired ED. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the acute facilitatory effect of norepinephrine (NE) in mPFC becomes detrimental when activated repeatedly during CUS. Using microdialysis, we showed that the release of NE evoked in mPFC by acute stress was unchanged at the end of CUS treatment. Thus, to then determine if repeated elicitation of this NE activity in mPFC during CUS may have contributed to the ED deficit, we infused a cocktail of \u03b1(1)-, \u03b2(1)-, and \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonists into the mPFC prior to each CUS session, then tested animals drug free on the AST. Antagonist treatment prevented the CUS-induced ED deficit, suggesting that NE signaling during CUS compromised mPFC function. We confirmed that this was not attributable to sensitization of adrenergic receptor function following chronic antagonist treatment, by administering an additional microinjection into the mPFC immediately prior to ED testing. Acute antagonist treatment did not reverse the beneficial effects of chronic drug treatment during CUS, nor have any effect on baseline ED performance in chronic vehicle controls. Thus, we conclude that blockade of noradrenergic receptors in mPFC protected against the detrimental cognitive effects of CUS, and that repeated elicitation of noradrenergic facilitatory activity is one mechanism by which chronic stress may promote mPFC cognitive dysfunction.", 
    "118": "In adult rodents, endocannabinoids (eCBs) regulate fast glucocorticoid (GC) feedback in the hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, acting as retrograde messengers that bind to cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) and inhibit glutamate release from presynaptic CRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). During the first two weeks of life, rat pups exhibit significant CRH and ACTH responses to stress although the adrenal GC output remains reduced. At the same time, pups also display increased sensitivity to GC feedback, but it is unclear whether eCBs play a role in mediating fast GC feedback in neonatal life. In our studies, we examined the role of eCBs in the rapid suppression of anoxia-induced ACTH release and determined whether eCB action could be modulated by the levels of circulating GCs present at the time of stress. PND8 pups were subjected to 3-min anoxia with AM251, a CB1R blocker, injected 30 min prior to stress onset. The effects of either metyrapone (MET) (a steroidogenic 11 beta-hydroxylase blocker) or methylprednisolone (PRED) (a synthetic GC) pretreatment on AM251 effect and the stress response were evaluated. Treatment with AM251 before stress onset tended to increase overall ACTH and CORT secretion, and also delayed the return to baseline ACTH. The AM251 effect on ACTH in PND8 pups was lost in MET-treated pups, who exhibited high basal and stimulated ACTH release and no CORT response to stress. Methylprednisolone suppressed ACTH stress responses although AM251 still delayed restoration of ACTH levels to the baseline. This suggests that the eCB effect on ACTH secretion in neonates is most evident when there is a dynamic fluctuation of corticosterone levels. Interestingly, AM251 increased basal and stimulated corticosterone secretion in all treatments including MET, suggestive of a direct action of CB1R blockade on adrenal steroidogenesis.", 
    "119": "In contrast to neutral events, emotionally arousing events often are remembered vividly and with great detail. Although generally adaptive to survival, this emotional memory enhancement may contribute to psychopathology. Blocking the arousal-related noradrenergic activity with a \u03b2 blocker shortly after learning prevents the emotional enhancement of memory. In the present experiment, we tested in 48 healthy subjects whether the administration of the \u03b2 blocker propranolol before the reactivation of already consolidated emotional episodic memories may interfere with their reconsolidation and, thus, reduce the subsequent feeling of remembering associated with these memories. Our results show that propranolol before reactivation abolished the superior memory for emotional relative to neutral stimuli and decreased 'remember' judgments for emotional items, suggesting that \u03b2-adrenergic blockade during reactivation made emotional memories comparable to neutral memories.",

Thus quantification of enantiomeric fractions during the biodegradation process is crucial for assessing the fate of chiral pollutants. This work presents the biodegradation of alprenolol and propranolol using an activated sludge inoculum, monitored by a validated enantioselective HPLC method with fluorescence detection. The enantioseparation was optimized using a vancomycin-based chiral stationary phase under polar ionic mode. The method was validated using a minimal salts medium inoculated with activated sludge as matrix. The method was selective and linear in the range of 10-800 ng/ml, with a R\u00b2>0.99. The accuracy ranged from 85.0 percent to 103 percent, the recovery ranged from 79.9 percent to 103 percent, and the precision measured by the relative standard deviation (RSD) was <7.18 percent for intra-batch and <5.39 percent for inter-batch assays. The limits of quantification and detection for all enantiomers were 10 ng/ml and 2.5 ng/ml, respectively. The method was successfully applied to follow the biodegradation of the target pharmaceuticals using an activated sludge inoculum during a fifteen days assay.

Vilanterol displayed a subnanomolar affinity for the \u03b2(2)-AR that was comparable with that of salmeterol but higher than olodaterol, formoterol, and indacaterol. In cAMP functional activity studies, vilanterol demonstrated similar selectivity as salmeterol for \u03b2(2)- over \u03b2(1)-AR and \u03b2(3)-AR, but a significantly improved selectivity profile than formoterol and indacaterol. Vilanterol also showed a level of intrinsic efficacy that was comparable to indacaterol but significantly greater than that of salmeterol. In cellular cAMP production and tissue-based studies measuring persistence and reassertion, vilanterol had a persistence of action comparable with indacaterol and longer than formoterol. In addition, vilanterol demonstrated reassertion activity in both cell and tissue systems that was comparable with salmeterol and indacaterol but longer than formoterol. In human airways, vilanterol was shown to have a faster onset and longer duration of action than salmeterol, exhibiting a significant level of bronchodilation 22 h after treatment. From these investigations, the data for vilanterol are consistent, showing that it is a novel, potent, and selective \u03b2(2)-AR receptor agonist with a long duration of action.

    "138": "Glaucoma is the second major cause of blindness in the world after cataract. Glaucoma management through eye drops that reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) has major deficiencies including low patient compliance and low bioavailability. Extended wear contact lenses that deliver glaucoma drugs for extended periods could increase patient compliance, while also increasing the bioavailability. To develop extended wear contact lenses that can also provide extended glaucoma therapy, we disperse nanoparticles of PGT (propoxylated glyceryl triacylate) that contain a glaucoma drug timolol. The particles can also be loaded into prefabricated lenses by soaking the lenses in a solution of particles in ethanol. The particle loaded gels can release timolol in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for about a month at room temperature. The most likely rate controlling mechanism is hydrolysis of the ester bond that links timolol to the PGT matrix, but other mechanisms such as water and drug diffusion, drug dissolution, drug-polymer chain cleavage, time-dependent drug permeability within the polymeric matrix, etc. may also be important. Nanoparticle incorporation in the silicone hydrogels results in reduction in ion and oxygen permeabilities, and an increase in modulus, and the impact on each of these properties is proportional to the particle loading. A gel with 5% particle loading can deliver timolol at therapeutic doses for about a month at room temperature, with a minimal impact on critical lens properties. Preliminary animal studies in Beagle dogs conducted with lenses in which particles are loaded by soaking the lenses in ethanol show a reduction in IOP.",

LVNC can be classified into 2 forms: isolated LVNC in the absence of other cardiac anomalies and non-isolated LVNC associated with congenital heart disease. The clinical presentation and the natural history of LVNC are highly variable, ranging from no symptoms to congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and systemic thromboemboli. LVNC is genetically heterogeneous and can be inherited as an autosomal dominant or X-linked recessive disorder. It is also linked to mutations in several genes, encoding the sarcomeric proteins, such as myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7). MYH7 encodes the \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, expressed in the cardiac muscle. The operative indication for patients with non-isolated LVNC is unclear. Here, we report the first successful case of surgical repair of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) in an infant with non-isolated LVNC associated with a novel MYH7 mutation. This mutation leads to the substitution of 7 amino acid residues (671-677) in the actin-binding region of the protein. After the VSD operation, the patient's congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension improved. His condition has remained stable for 18 months with pharmacotherapy comprising diuretics, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and a \u03b2-blocker.

Infection of Porphyromonas gingivalis induced alveolar bone resorption in both Mg\u0394 and wild-type mice. The amount of resorption was significantly larger in the former than the latter. Immunoarray and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses demonstrated that interleukin-17 (IL-17) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) levels were significantly higher in infected Mg\u0394 mice than infected wild-type mice.

A single slow administration of IV epinephrine (0.5 to 1 mg administered over 30 to 60 s) restored sinus rhythm after 30-90 s with only minor side effects. In the ICD patient with recurrent VT and several cardioversions due to transformation of VT to ventricular fibrillation, epinephrine injection led to the avoidance of further shocks. Although potentially harmful, low doses of IV epinephrine used alone or in combination with beta-blocker treatment and electrical cardioversion may be an alternative effective therapy for sustained monomorphic VT refractory to amiodarone.

    "189": "This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of carvedilol for pediatric patients with chronic heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy. Seven pediatric medical centers participated in this prospective study. Pediatric patients (n = 89) were randomly divided into an experimental group (carvedilol treatment) and a control group (conventional treatment). The analysis excluded 12 patients lost during the follow-up period. Carvedilol was added to the therapy of the experimental group after at least 1 month of basic treatment with digoxin, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, and diuretics. The control patients received the same basic treatment but did not receive carvedilol. The initial dose of carvedilol was 0.1 (mg/kg day), and the dose was doubled every 2 weeks until the maximum tolerated dose or 0.8 (mg/kg day) was achieved. The tolerated dose was maintained for 6 months. The Ross scales and echocardiographic parameters including left ventricular diastolic diameter, left ventricular systolic diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular fractional shortening, and serous brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration, as well as clinical progress were compared between the two groups. The Ross scales decreased by 11.94% in the experimental group, which was more than in the control group (2.81%). In addition, changes to other echocardiographic parameters in the experimental group also were superior to those in the control group. The serous BNP concentration in the experimental group decreased by 30.1%, which also was more than the decrease (22.2%) observed in the control group. Clinical improvement was demonstrated by 40%, no change by 35%, and clinical deterioration by 25% of the patients in the experimental group, and by respectively 37.8, 27, and 35.2% of the patients in the control group. These differences were not statistically significant. Only one patient demonstrated a severe adverse event, severe pulmonary infection, and complete atrioventricular block. None of the other carvedilol-treated patients experienced drug-related side effects. Carvedilol can be safely used for treatment of chronic heart dysfunction in pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The results in this study showed an apparent improvement in the cardiac function of these patients. Additional clinical studies are required to determine the most favorable dosing levels and regimens of carvedilol before its safety and efficacy for the pediatric population can be determined conclusively.", 
    "190": "Guidelines recommend combining \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in high-risk heart disease but not in the initial treatment of hypertension. The mechanism of this benefit has not been determined. After 3 weeks of lisinopril (L, 40 mg/day) run-in, 30 subjects entered a single-blinded, forced-titration, crossover study in which carvedilol (C, 20 then 40 mg/day) or a control renin-angiotensin blocker, valsartan (V, 160 then 320 mg/day) were added to L. Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and heart rate monitoring was performed at the end of each period. Rate-pressure product (RPP, systolic BP \u00d7 heart rate, an indicator of cardiac oxygen consumption) was measured over 24 hours, daytime (6 am to midnight), and nighttime (midnight to 6 am) periods. Variability (standard deviation and range) of RPP, BP, and heart rate was also investigated. After 4\u00a0weeks, mean 24-hour systolic BP was about 8 mm Hg lower when either V or C was added to L (P < .01 each). Heart rate was consistently lower with C (8 beats/min over 24 hours, P < .000) but was slightly increased with V (about 2\u00a0beats/min, P\u00a0= NS). Consequently, C lowered RPP to a greater degree than V over 24 hours (about 8% vs. 2%, P < .000) and during daytime and nighttime periods (P < .000 each). In addition, RPP variability (SD but not range) was consistently lower on C than V. When added to L, C reduces the mean and variability (SD) of 24-hour heart rate and cardiac workload to a greater degree than valsartan. These effects may contribute to the outcome benefits observed with \u03b2-blocker-ACE inhibitor combinations.",

    "200": "Interaction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) with other cellular signalling pathways plays an important role in training-induced mitochondrial adaptations. The purpose of this study was to examine whether pyrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a nuclear factor-\u03baB inhibitor and antioxidant, and the \u03b2-adrenergic blocker propranolol would affect the PGC-1\u03b1-induced mitochondrial transcription factors, enzymes and proteins involved in energy metabolism and antioxidant defense in response to endurance training. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 8 weeks) were randomly divided into two groups (n = 24), one subjected to 8 weeks of treadmill training and one remaining sedentary. Each group of rats was subdivided in to three groups that were injected (i.p.) daily with PDTC (50 mg (kg body weight)(-1)), propranolol (30 mg kg(-1)) or saline as a control 1 h before the daily exercise session. Sedentary PDTC-treated rats showed 75% higher PGC-1\u03b1 content (P < 0.01) but lower mitochondrial transcription factor A and phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element binding protein (p-CREB) than control rats. Training increased PGC-1\u03b1 by 57% (P < 0.01), cytochrome c oxidase 4 by 30% (P < 0.05) and p-CREB by 13% (P < 0.05), whereas the mitochondrial mitofusin-2 level was decreased by 24% (P < 0.01). Treatment with PDTC decreased PGC-1\u03b1 and p-CREB content by 34 and 53% (P < 0.05), respectively, in trained rats and abolished training effects on cytochrome c oxidase 4 and mitochondrial mitofusin-2. None of the training effects was abolished by propranolol treatment. Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activity was decreased with PDTC, whereas training-induced glutathione peroxidase activity was unaltered by either drug. The data indicates that nuclear factor-\u03baB-inhibitory and antioxidant properties of PDTC can attenuate PGC-1\u03b1-mediated mitochondrial adaptation to endurance training, whereas the \u03b2-adrenergic pathway has little adverse effect.", 
    "201": "In the failing heart, persistent \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation is thought to induce myocyte death by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent and PKA-independent activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II. \u03b2-adrenergic signaling pathways also are capable of activating cardioprotective mechanisms.", 
    "202": "This study used a novel PKA inhibitor peptide to inhibit PKA activity to test the hypothesis that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor signaling causes cell death through PKA-dependent pathways and cardioprotection through PKA-independent pathways.", 
    "203": "In PKA inhibitor peptide transgenic mice, chronic isoproterenol failed to induce cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and myocyte apoptosis, and decreased cardiac function. In cultured adult feline ventricular myocytes, PKA inhibition protected myocytes from death induced by \u03b21-adrenergic receptor agonists by preventing cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) overload and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II activation. PKA inhibition revealed a cardioprotective role of \u03b2-adrenergic signaling via cAMP/exchange protein directly activated by cAMP/Rap1/Rac/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Selective PKA inhibition causes protection in the heart after myocardial infarction that was superior to \u03b2-blocker therapy.",

The influence of molecularly imprinted polymer particle content and sodium tetraphenylborate additives in polyvinylchloride membrane was shown. The electrodes show near-Nernstian responses down to 10(-4)-10(-5) M propranolol concentration. The potentiometric response of MIP-based sensor for propranolol in mixed nonaqueous medium was shown at first. Sensor selectivity relative to various inorganic cations, atenolol and metoprolol, was reported. Direct potentiometry was used to determine propranolol in aqueous modeling solutions and pharmaceutical preparations with good results.", 
    "206": "Drug permeability determines the oral availability of drugs via cellular membranes. Poor permeability makes a drug unsuitable for further development. The permeability may be estimated as the free energy change that the drug should overcome through crossing membrane. In this paper the drug permeability was simulated using molecular dynamics method and the potential energy profile was calculated with potential of mean force (PMF) method. The membrane was simulated using DPPC bilayer and three drugs with different permeability were tested. PMF studies on these three drugs show that doxorubicin (low permeability) should pass higher free energy barrier from water to DPPC bilayer center while ibuprofen (high permeability) has a lower energy barrier. Our calculation indicates that the simulation model we built is suitable to predict drug permeability.",

    "208": "Ventricular arrhythmias constitute the main cause of sudden cardiac death. In the elderly, their presentation may be manifested by intermittent confusion or unexplained falls. In some cases, they may also be asymptomatic. The primary management goals are to identify and treat the underlying cause and prevent recurrence. With the exception of beta-blockers, none of the other antiarrhythmic drugs available reduce mortality associated with ventricular arrhythmias. In the elderly, these drugs are associated with a higher risk of adverse events. In this article, the authors review the data available regarding evaluation and management of ventricular arrhythmias in the elderly."
