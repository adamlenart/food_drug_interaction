    "0": "We compared the electrophysiologic, inotropic and antiarrhythmic properties of propafenone and two metabolites, 5-hydroxy (5-OH) propafenone and N-depropyl (N-DP) propafenone. In 18 canine Purkinje fibers with normal maximum diastolic potentials, all drugs (1 x 10(-8) to 1 x 10(-5) M) reduced action potential amplitude and duration. However, propafenone and 5-OH propafenone reduced Vmax in a use-dependent fashion at a lower concentration than N-DP propafenone. In 16 Purkinje fibers, slow response action potentials were induced by 22 mM K+ and isoproterenol, 1 x 10(-6) M. Vmax was comparably reduced by all compounds at 1 x 10(-5) M, but action potential amplitude was not affected by 5-OH propafenone. In 16 other Purkinje fibers in which automaticity at low levels of membrane potential was induced by BaCl2 (0.25 mM), only 5-OH propafenone was effective in slowing the automatic rate at therapeutic concentrations (3 micrograms/ml). In 15 guinea pig papillary muscles, all three drugs had negative inotropic effects at concentrations greater than or equal to 1 x 10(-6) M. In conscious dogs with sustained ventricular tachycardia 24 hr after infarction, we injected propafenone or a metabolite through an atrial cannula. At similar plasma levels, neither propafenone (n = 6) nor N-DP propafenone (n = 6) suppressed the arrhythmia, whereas 5-OH propafenone eliminated ventricular tachycardia in four of six dogs, and was more effective against monomorphic than polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Hence, the two major metabolites of propafenone have important electrophysiologic effects, and 5-OH propafenone is more potent than the parent compound as a antiarrhythmic drug in the 24-hr Harris dog.", 
    "1": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that less propranolol was required to block stellate-induced shortening of atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods (ERPs) than was required to prevent stellate-induced shortening of the spontaneous sinus nodal cycle length and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time. Studies were performed in open-chest, neurally decentralized dogs anesthetized with secobarbital. We determined the dose of propranolol (propranolol dose-response curves) required to block the effects of 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 4 Hz bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation on sinus nodal automaticity, AV nodal conduction, and atrial and ventricular ERPs. We found that propranolol at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg eliminated ansae subclaviae-induced shortening of atrial and ventricular ERPs, whereas sinus nodal cycle length and AV nodal conduction time still shortened. These data indicate a differential sensitivity of the sinus and AV nodes compared with atrial and ventricular myocardium to the beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking effects of propranolol in response to efferent sympathetic neural stimulation. Clinical implications are that it might be possible to treat sympathetically mediated ventricular arrhythmias with doses of propranolol that still preserve sinus and AV nodal responses.", 
    "2": "The \"inactive metabolite approach\" was used to design a series of \"soft\" drugs derived from the acidic metabolite of metoprolol. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these novel \"soft\" beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were determined: half-lives in human blood ranged from 5 to 754 min. The rates of in vivo disappearance of representative slow, medium, and fast hydrolyzing esters were determined in rats. In each case rapid and quantitative conversion to the corresponding free acid was observed. This suggests a facile, one-step degradation to the predicted major metabolite. The compounds were tested for their ability to decrease intraocular pressure in a rabbit model. Five of the new compounds exerted an ocular hypotensive action comparable to or greater than that of the reference compound, timolol maleate, and with a prolonged duration of action in some cases. In contrast the new compounds showed reduced and shorter duration systemic activity. The adamantylethyl ester emerges as a potentially effective antiglaucoma agent with significantly improved site-specific activity.", 
    "3": "Fifteen patients who had undergone neurovascular surgery for arteriovenous malformations or cerebrovascular aneurysms and had intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors were studied. The patients had been treated initially with sodium nitroprusside to maintain their arterial BP in a prescribed range, but, because of excessive nitroprusside dose requirements, they were considered either to have refractory BP or to be at risk for thiocyanate toxicity. Intravenous labetalol therapy was started either by frequent bolus pulse therapy every 1 to 2 h or by continuous infusion therapy. The degree of desired arterial BP control and the effects on ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were assessed and compared with the results during nitroprusside therapy. The degree of arterial BP control with labetalol was assessed to be good; 11 patients were weaned off nitroprusside and the remaining four patients had a substantial reduction in their nitroprusside requirements, needing an average of only 1.5 micrograms/kg.min of nitroprusside to control their BP compared with average requirements of 10 micrograms/kg.min of nitroprusside before labetalol therapy. Labetalol therapy improved CPP in six patients and ICP in five patients, with no significant change in cerebral pressure in the remainder. Overall, the CPP in the 15 patients improved from 63 +/- 15 (SD) mm Hg with nitroprusside to 65 +/- 10 mm Hg with labetalol therapy and the ICP decreased from 11.3 +/- 6.1 mm Hg with nitroprusside to 8.6 +/- 3.1 mm Hg with labetalol therapy (p less than .05 by Wilcoxon matched pairs).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "In eight patients with essential hypertension the effect of 50 mg atenolol, once daily for 6 months, on vasodilation during epinephrine infusion and submaximal dynamic exercise was studied. The normal decrease of diastolic blood pressure during bicycle exercise, reflecting a decrease in total peripheral resistance not mediated by circulating epinephrine, disappeared during atenolol treatment. Low-dose infusion of epinephrine had no influence on systolic blood pressure both before and after atenolol. However, the decrease of diastolic blood pressure occurring before atenolol was abolished and the increase in heart rate was attenuated during atenolol treatment. Forearm vascular resistance decreased before and during atenolol to the same extent. So the normal physiologic vasodilation during submaximal dynamic exercise seems impaired during long-term treatment with atenolol. In addition the normal vasodilating response to an increase of circulating epinephrine to levels occurring during daily life stress seems impaired even with the low dose of this beta 1-selective beta-blocker.", 
    "5": "To determine the effects of long-term beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on adult rats with myocardial infarction, we studied 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats with myocardial infarction induced at 20-22 weeks of age. Two days after surgery, the animals were randomized to receive either propranolol (750 mg/l) in their drinking water or water alone for 5 weeks. Plastic, embedded, longitudinal and cross sections of septum (1 micron thick) were prepared for morphometric measurements. In untreated rats, infarction was followed by myocardial hypertrophy, as shown by significant increases in septal area (23%), myocyte length (19%), cross-sectional area (20%), and volume (43%) (p less than or equal to 0.05). In rats with and without infarction, beta-blockade resulted in decreased myocyte dimensions and increased left ventricular cavity dimensions. Propranolol had special effects in rats with infarction, resulting in significant blunting of increased cross-sectional area (15% less, p = 0.04) and a greater increase in left ventricular cavity dimensions (38% more, p = 0.04). Thus, propranolol blunts myocardial hypertrophy and increases left ventricular cavity dimensions in rats with myocardial infarction.", 
    "6": "To elucidate the characteristics of promotion factor(s) in rat serum required for the protein-mediated transport of drugs into the brain, we examined the brain uptake of DL-propranolol as a model drug using the in vivo brain uptake index (BUI) method in rats. The protein-mediated transport was not observed in rats injected with the buffer solution containing either various concentrations of purified rat alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) or rat albumin. When the filtrate from rat serum was used as an injection vehicle to which a physiological concentration of purified rat serum protein(s) was added, the protein-mediated transport of DL-propranolol was observed in the rat brain. Moreover, the ability of protein-mediated transport of DL-propranolol was reduced in rats injected with the dialyzed serum compared with the undialyzed serum. These results suggest that the dialyzable promotion factor in serum is required for the protein-mediated transport of DL-propranolol into the brain.", 
    "7": "We present the case of a 21-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with an episode of profound weakness due to thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, a syndrome of muscular weakness occurring in patients with hyperthyroidism. Prior to the diagnosis, the patient was treated with a parenteral tranquilizer. When hypokalemia was discovered, potassium was administered, resulting in the development of hyperkalemia. Episodes of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis are usually self limited, and recovery of motor strength is complete. However, potassium is frequently administered to hasten recovery and prevent cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory arrest. Serum potassium must, therefore, be monitored carefully in these patients during treatment.", 
    "8": "Stress has been identified as contributing to the development of cardiovascular disease. The pathophysiologic link between stress and disease still remains unclear. Because experimental stress testing in the laboratory permits the examination of the underlying mechanism for stress-induced blood pressure, analyses of cardiovascular reactivity during emotional stress could be of particular clinical importance. The analyses of pooled data during the past 6 years (n = 298, age from 20 to 60 years, normotensive subjects as well as patients with borderline and mild essential hypertension) reveal that stress-induced changes in stroke volume and especially in total peripheral resistance are crucial parameters to analyze the hemodynamic stress response. However, neither those simple nor complex response patterns such as \"hot reactor\" describe clinically distinct subgroups of persons. When physiologic testing was repeated in hypertensive patients after effective long-term antihypertensive therapy with clonidine, oxprenolol, nitrendipine, or enalapril, no attenuation of the stress-induced increase in blood pressure was found in any of these groups. However, heart rate reactivity and stress-induced changes in total peripheral resistance were altered significantly by oxprenolol and nitrendipine. The beta-adrenoceptor blocker decreased heart rate reactivity and increased reactivity of peripheral resistance; the calcium antagonist decreased stress-induced changes in peripheral resistance and increased the heart rate response. The centrally acting sympatholytic regimen and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor had no impact on the hemodynamic response pattern during emotional challenge.", 
    "9": "Pituitary cells were cultured as three-dimensional reaggregates in serum-free chemically defined medium supplemented with different concentrations of dexamethasone. Immunostaining of the cells using a polyclonal antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies raised against choline acetyl transferase (CAT), revealed the presence of CAT immunoreactivity in 4-10% of anterior pituitary cells depending on the antibody used. CAT immunoreactivity was also found in freshly dispersed anterior pituitary cells. CAT-immunoreactive cells could be enriched on BSA and Percoll gradients and codistributed with ACTH-immunoreactive cells in these gradients. Perifusion of the aggregates with the potent muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (Atr) resulted in a dose-dependent (0.1-100 nM) increase in both basal PRL and GH secretion; the response was dependent on the dexamethasone concentration in the culture medium. A similar response to Atr was observed in organ-cultured pituitaries. The specificity of the Atr effect was supported by the findings that the potent and highly specific muscarinic receptor blocker dexetimide showed a similar action, whereas its inactive enantiomer levetimide and the nicotinic receptor blocker hexamethonium failed to do so. Two other muscarinic antagonists, benzatropine and pirenzepine, showed a dose-dependent hormone-releasing action similar to that of Atr, but were less potent than the latter. Pirenzepine was only effective at high molar concentrations, suggesting that an M2 muscarinic receptor subtype was mediating the present phenomenon. Atr also potentiated GH release stimulated by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and PRL release stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, but had no effect on GRF-stimulated GH release. The choline uptake blocker hemicholinium abolished the effect of Atr on GH and PRL release. These data suggest that certain pituitary cells can express CAT activity and that these cells exert a tonic inhibitory activity on GH and PRL release which is mediated by a cholinomimetic substance, possibly acetylcholine, through a muscarinic receptor.", 
    "10": "Hypertension and diabetes mellitus frequently coexist and are independent risk factors for reduced peripheral perfusion. Antihypertensive medications that reduce blood pressure and improve peripheral perfusion would have advantages in diabetic patients with hypertension. In a randomized, two-placebo period, single-blind, two-way crossover study, we determined finger and forearm blood flow, lipid levels, and blood pressure control in 19 diabetic patients with hypertension, with each atenolol or prazosin and placebo period of 4 weeks' duration. Both drugs reduced blood pressure (sitting: 157/95 to 142/84 mm Hg, atenolol; 155/95 to 138/82 mm Hg, prazosin; standing: 154/94 to 144/84 mm Hg, atenolol; 154/94 to 133/81 mm Hg, prazosin). Lipid levels did not change except that low-density lipoprotein levels fell from 148 to 127 mg/dl with prazosin. Atenolol did not change forearm or finger blood flow or vascular resistance. Prazosin increased blood flow and reduced vascular resistance in both finger and forearm. In conclusion, prazosin has a potentially more appropriate hemodynamic profile than has atenolol in diabetic patients with hypertension.", 
    "11": "We compared the relative effects of relaxation therapy, conventional hygienic techniques, and a beta-receptor blocker, atenolol, on control of arterial pressure, left ventricular mass, and diastolic function in patients with mild primary hypertension. Furthermore, we related these effects to baseline neural tone and its changes and assessed the efficacy of relaxation or the pressor surge of \"social stress\" anger. In group I left ventricular mass index was related to both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.46; p less than 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine was related to age (r = 0.33; p less than 0.01). Slope was inversely related to both plasma norepinephrine (r = -0.29; p less than 0.05) and age (r = -0.31; p less than 0.05). Relaxation therapy reduced both supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures, 4.5% and 7.6%, respectively, but did not affect plasma norepinephrine. Hygienic informational therapy reduced plasma norepinephrine by 18%, (p less than 0.05) and did not change blood pressure. Blood pressure responders to nondrug therapy (i.e., diastolic blood pressure reduction of 7% or more) had a 7% reduction of left ventricular mass index (p less than 0.02). On the other hand, atenolol reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 10% and 15%, respectively, (p less than 0.01) and improved left ventricular function by 17% (p less than 0.05) without a significant change in left ventricular mass index. Finally, relaxation therapy but not hygienic therapy reduced systolic blood pressures 4% and 6%, respectively (p less than 0.01), both before and during social stress anger.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "Changes in myocardial segment length (ultrasonic crystals) and myocardial blood flow (15(3) microns microspheres) were studied during 5 min occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery in open chest anaesthetised dogs, and the effects of occlusion without intervention were compared with those of occlusion during bilateral vagal nerve stimulation (n = 11) and occlusion after administration of 1 mg.kg-1 propranolol (n = 9) in the same dogs. Delineation of the perfusion beds of occluded and non-occluded arteries at necropsy verified placement of the crystals at the centres and immediately within the borders of the ischaemic areas. In untreated animals (n = 6) systolic shortening during occlusion decreased by 160(2)% (dyskinesis) in the centre zone and by 61(1)% (hypokinesis) in the border zone of ischaemia, myocardial blood flow decreased by 96(2)% in the centre and 81(2)% at the border, and the changes were reproducible over three successive occlusions. Postsystolic shortening (after peak decline of left ventricular pressure) was reproducible in control animals over three occlusions, was similar in magnitude to the magnitude of dyskinesis (centre zone) or to the degree of hypokinesis (border zone), and persisted after the release of occlusion. Vagal stimulation and propranolol decreased dyskinesis during occlusion but did not affect postsystolic shortening or collateral blood flow within the ischaemic zones. If postsystolic shortening of dyskinetic centre zone segments represents residual active shortening of these segments, as is suggested by other evidence, these results suggest that the oxygen sparing effects for very ischaemic myocardium of vagal stimulation and propranolol do not include a significant reduction in residual active shortening.", 
    "13": "Esmolol hydrochloride degrades in aqueous solutions by the hydrolysis of a labile aliphatic carboxyester group. The products are methanol and ASL-8123. The resulting aliphatic carboxylic acid moiety (ASL-8123) has a pK of 4.80, which is within 1 pH unit of the pH of the formulation. ASL-8123 therefore acts as a \"secondary buffer\" and minimizes the change in pH due to degradation. Equations are presented to calculate the change in the pH when the primary degradation product acts as a secondary buffer. This information can be used in the development of a parenteral product to predict, a priori, the concentration of buffer necessary for optimal pH maintenance. This knowledge can reduce the number of formulation screens required to determine the necessary buffer capacity for optimal drug stability.", 
    "14": "1. The effect of pulmonary venous congestion on tracheal tone was studied in dogs anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose. Pulmonary venous congestion was produced by partial obstruction of the mitral valve to increase left atrial pressure by 10 mmHg. Tracheal tone was measured in vivo by an isometric force displacement method. 2. Tracheal tone increased by 6.3 +/- 0.3 g from a control level of 91.6 +/- 2.8 g when left atrial pressure was increased by 10.5 +/- 0.3 mmHg. This response was abolished by cooling the cervical vagi to 8 degrees C at a point caudal to the origin of the superior laryngeal nerves. Also, sectioning the superior laryngeal nerves abolished this increase in tracheal tone. 3. Afferent activity recorded from rapidly adapting receptors of the airways increased significantly during pulmonary venous congestion. This increase in activity was abolished by cooling the vagi caudal to the recording site to 8-9 degrees C. 4. Administration of propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) failed to abolish this increase in tracheal tone while atropine (3 mg/kg) did so. 5. Stimulation of left atrial receptors without an increase in left atrial pressure and stimulation of right atrial receptors with and without increases in right atrial pressure did not cause any change in tracheal tone. 6. It is suggested that pulmonary venous congestion is associated with a reflex increase in tracheal tone, the afferent limb of which is formed by pulmonary receptors discharging into myelinated fibres in the cervical vagi and the efferent limb by parasympathetic cholinergic fibres in the superior laryngeal nerves. The afferent receptors are likely to be the rapidly adapting receptors. This reflex may be of importance in the development of the respiratory symptoms associated with left ventricular failure.", 
    "15": "In primates, separation of an infant from its mother is a naturally occurring stressor resulting in activation of behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic systems. When separated from their mothers, infant rhesus monkeys emit frequent species-typical distress vocalizations ('coos'). In earlier work we demonstrated that opiate and benzodiazepine systems influence the frequency of coos induced by separation in infant rhesus monkeys. The present studies assessed the role of alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic systems in mediating distress vocalizations. We found that the alpha 2 agonist, clonidine (33 and 67 micrograms/kg), reduced activity levels without affecting separation-induced coos. Only at 100 micrograms/kg were distress vocalizations reduced, and this was associated with behavioral sedation. In the same animals, morphine (0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg) selectively reduced distress vocalizations without affecting activity. Thus, the effects of clonidine, 100 micrograms/kg, appear to be due to non-specific sedation. We next assessed whether antagonism of beta-adrenergic receptors reduces separation distress. We administered propranolol over a wide dosage range to a different group of animals and found that a high dose (20 mg/kg) increased separation-induced coos while decreasing the activity levels. That such a high dose was necessary to affect coo vocalizations suggests that effects on vocalizations are due to non-specific effects of the drug. Unlike propranolol, morphine administered to these animals did not affect activity levels but did selectively reduce distress vocalizations. These findings suggest that alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic systems do not specifically mediate separation-induced coos in infant rhesus monkeys. However, as demonstrated in an earlier study, opiate systems have a prominent role.", 
    "16": "In order to investigate whether initial plasma lipid concentrations could be used to distinguish between high and low responders to an atherogenic diet, rabbits were divided into 3 groups according to their plasma concentrations of cholesterol and phospholipids after 4 weeks on a standard rabbit diet. Plasma cholesterol and phospholipid levels were less than 0.5 mM, less than 1.1 mM, respectively, in group 1 (n = 17), greater than 0.5 mM, less than 1.1 mM, in group 2 (n = 13), and greater than 0.5 mM, greater than or equal to 1.1 mM, in group 3 (n = 14). After 7 weeks on a diet containing 0.25% cholesterol and 3% coconut oil, animals in groups 1 and 2 had a lower increase in their plasma lipid levels compared with group 3. Half of each group was then treated with the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol during the next 14 weeks on the atherogenic diet. At the end of the study, the extent of atherosclerosis both in the aortas and in the coronary arteries of the control animals showed a positive correlation to plasma cholesterol and to plasma phospholipid concentrations integrated over time. The metoprolol-treated animals in groups 1 and 2 had a reduction of atherosclerosis compared with their respective controls. We conclude that subpopulations of rabbits that react differently on an atherogenic diet can be identified by their initial plasma lipid levels, and that metoprolol treatment of low responders to an atherogenic diet significantly reduces atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta.", 
    "17": "1. We have examined the problem of how systolic time intervals (STI) should be corrected for heart rate in clinical pharmacological studies. 2. 'Individual' linear regression equations describing the relationship between STI and heart rate were derived for each of 43 healthy young adults (30 men and 13 women) by measuring STI at different heart rates produced by incremental doses of intravenous atropine. 'Population' equations for each sex were obtained by taking the mean of the 'individual' regression coefficients. 3. In order to assess which method more effectively reduced variability of the STI, 'individual' regression coefficients were derived for eight men who had previously participated in a placebo-controlled study which had used STI to test the cardiovascular effects of calcium antagonists alone and in combination with propranolol. 4. Within-subject variability in rate-corrected STI was similar after application of 'individual' and 'population' regression equations. Between-subject variability tended to be less after the use of 'population' equations. 5. 'Population' regression equations were more effective than 'individual' regression equations in allowing detection of differences between treatments, as judged by F values from ANOVA. 6. In clinical pharmacological studies including measurements of STI in healthy young subjects, 'individual' regression equations appear to have no advantage over 'population' equations derived in a group of subjects of similar age and sex.", 
    "18": "The accommodative response of 12 emmetropic subjects was measured for an array of numbers located at -1, -3 and -5 dioptres using an objective infra-red optometer. Responses were compared for passive (reading numbers) and active (adding numbers) conditions. The imposition of mental effort induced a significant increase in mean response for the -1 D stimulus, a response equivalent to the passive condition at -3 D and a reduction in response at -5 D. Mental effort induced similar responses for the -1 D and -3 D locations when sympathetic innervation to the ciliary muscle was blocked with the beta-receptor antagonist timolol maleate. Responses for the -5 D location were, however, significantly increased. It is proposed that sympathetic inhibition can modify the effect of mental effort on near accommodative responses.", 
    "19": "Coronary arterial occlusion, maintained for 7 days in rabbits was accompanied by a marked and fairly stable drop in macroergic phosphates (ATP, creatine phosphate), seen in the perinecrotic and distant left and right ventricular myocardium. The administration of 0.5 mg/kg propranolol twice daily within 30-40 min after coronary arterial ligation resulted in a significant increase in ATP and the adenine nucleotides pool at a distance from the necrotic focus in the right and left ventricular myocardium on treatment days 3 and 7 and did not affect the recovery of normal creatine phosphate in the same myocardial areas. Propranolol treatment limited progressive death of myocardial cell population, reducing by 37% myocardial infarction size by day 7 of the experimental study, as compared to the situation in the untreated animals.", 
    "20": "Changes in the rate of coronary venous flow through the affected area under the effect of intravenous jet injections of propranolol, 0.1 mg per 1 kg body weight, were assessed in 18 patients of the hyperkinetic central hemodynamic type during acute myocardial infarction. In the first group of patients, whose mean flow rate through the affected wall was 106.2 +/- 5.7 ml/min, the latter parameter decreased in proportion to the drop in double product. In the second group of patients, whose coronary venous flow rate was reduced (51.4 +/- 6.9 ml/min), propranolol-induced drop in the flow rate was less marked, as compared to the drop in double product. It was correlated with dramatically depressed pumping function of the heart.", 
    "21": "1. An animal model suitable for studying placental extraction of large numbers of drugs without the need for major surgical facilities, has been developed in the anaesthetized New Zealand white rabbit with sampling of both arterial and venous blood of the foetoplacental unit. 2. Three drugs with different routes of metabolism were studied: trimazosin, tolmesoxide and acebutolol. There was no extraction across the foetoplacental unit. 3. The clearance of acebutolol differed significantly in rabbits from different suppliers. 4. These results do not suggest a role for the placenta in drug metabolism. They do, however, suggest a previously undescribed genetic determinant of acebutolol metabolism.", 
    "22": "Controversy exists concerning the effects of acute beta-adrenergic blockade on ventilation during exercise. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of acute beta blockade on ventilation and gas exchange during incremental exercise. Nine male subjects underwent incremental exercise on a cycle ergometer (30 W.min-1) to exhaustion, with one trial being performed 60 min after the subject ingested propranolol hydrochloride (Inderal 1 mg.kg-1 BW) while the second test served as control. The treatment order was counterbalanced to preclude any ordering effect on the results, and 1 week separated the tests. Ventilation and gas exchange were monitored by open circuit techniques. No difference (p greater than 0.05) existed in VE, % Hb sat, VCO2, ventilatory threshold, and VE/VCO2 between treatments at the same exercise stage. VO2max was lowered from 3.82 to 3.26 l.min-1 (p less than 0.05) and HRmax was reduced from 190 to 150 bpm (p less than 0.05) as a result of beta blockade. These data suggested that acute beta blockade had no effect on exercise ventilation, but decreased HRmax at comparable work rates. In addition, VO2max and exercise time to exhaustion were hindered, probably due to beta blockade limitation of HRmax, and, thus, oxygen transport.", 
    "23": "The electrophysiologic effects of the beta-1 selective beta adrenergic blocking drug Betaxolol were investigated after intravenous (0.15 mg/kg body weight) and oral (20 mg/day) administration in 11 patients with atrioventricular-nodal reentrant tachycardia. Betaxolol significantly (p less than 0.01) prolonged cycle length, sinus node recovery time, AH-interval, as well as the antegrade functional refractory period of the slow and fast AV-nodal pathway. The effective refractory period of the fast AV-nodal pathway was also markedly increased (p less than 0.05). In only six patients could the effective refractory period of the slow AV-nodal pathway be determined; in the other patients, it was shorter than the effective refractory period of the atrium. The effective refractory period of the atrium and the ventricle was not significantly altered by Betaxolol. Intravenous administration of Betaxolol suppressed induction of tachycardia in eight patients, whereas after oral Betaxolol, tachycardia was not inducible in ten patients. Betaxolol prevented induction of tachycardia in two patients by prolonging antegrade conduction over the slow AV-nodal pathway. The retrograde fast AV-nodal pathway was blocked in eight patients. Presumably the increased effectiveness of oral Betaxolol can be attributed to higher Betaxolol plasma concentrations, reached after oral treatment (58 +/- 38 ng/ml), as compared to intravenous administration (40 +/- 40 ng/ml). There were no false positive results after intravenous testing of Betaxolol.", 
    "24": "The effect of epithelium removal on the responses of porcine airways to exogenously applied agonists and nerve stimulation was examined. Paired rings of third- (segmental), fourth- and fifth-order (subsegmental) bronchi, with and without epithelium, were placed in organ chambers in physiological salt solution (95% O2-5% CO2, 37 degrees C). Removal of the epithelium caused a leftward shift in the concentration-effect curve for acetylcholine (3rd and 4th order). A similar shift occurred for histamine (3rd and 5th order). The relaxation to isoproterenol was reduced by epithelium removal in a similar fashion in the three orders. Removal of the epithelium reduced the maximal response to KCl (3rd and 4th order) and acetylcholine (5th order). The peak response to nerve stimulation showed a significant rightward shift in the absence of epithelium. In fifth-order bronchi, tissues with epithelium showed a significantly greater degree of fade of the response to sustained electrical stimulation. Thus both epithelium-derived relaxing and contracting factors may be released in porcine airways.", 
    "25": "We examined the response of five ponies with recurrent airway obstruction (principals) and five age- and gender-matched controls to the aerosol alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine after blockade with propranolol and atropine. Measurements were made with principal ponies in clinical remission (period A) and during acute airway obstruction (period B). The blockade had no effect on base-line pulmonary mechanics in control ponies during periods A and B or in the principal ponies during period A. However, in the principal ponies during period B, blockade increased dynamic compliance (Cdyn) and decreased pulmonary resistance (RL). Phenylephrine had no effect on the controls during either period. In the principals, phenylephrine decreased Cdyn and increased RL during both periods. The alpha 1-agonist aerosol prazosin shifted the phenylephrine dose-response curves to the right, but prasozin did not bronchodilate the principals during period B. This suggests that the role of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in airway narrowing in ponies with recurrent airway obstruction is minimal. However, the response to phenylephrine in only the principal ponies suggests an increase in alpha-receptor numbers and/or activity in these animals compared with controls.", 
    "26": "The transmembrane migration method has permitted quantification of the effect of drugs on human sperm motility. Calcium ionophores and calcium antagonists have paradoxical effects on motility depending on the stage of sperm maturity. Drugs with membrane stabilizing properties inhibit sperm motility. Propranolol, for example, has been shown to have contraceptive activity when administered intra-vaginally. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the systemic availability of vaginally administered propranolol is markedly greater than after oral administration. Seminal fluid concentrations of propranolol after oral administration are similar to those in plasma, but cervicovaginal mucus concentrations are much higher, and residence times much longer. The clinical consequences of these observations await elucidation.", 
    "27": "The transmembrane migration method determines the effect of a drug concentrated in the chamber containing seminal fluid on human sperm motility by measuring the proportion of sperms that cross the 5 micron pores of a Nucleopore membrane from an aliquot of semen into a buffer solution. Various classes of drugs have been shown by transmembrane migration to immobilize sperm by penetrating the cell membrane, which is a function of the lipid solubility of the drugs. Sperm motility may thus provide a model for the study of membrane stabilizing drugs. Calcium ions have a different effect on sperm motility, depending on the stage of sperm maturity. They increase the motility of immotile sperm collected from the epididymis, inhibit sperm motility in ejaculated semen, and induce a premature acrosome reaction in uncapacitated sperm. Caffeine increases sperm motility and antagonizes the inhibitory effect of propranolol and procaine. Propranolol acts as a vaginal contraceptive by inhibiting sperm motility; however, some of the effect may be systemic, since propranolol drains directly into the inferior vena cava. Orally administered propranolol in men does not seem to reach sperm-immobilizing levels, but in women, oral propranolol accumulates extensively in the cervico-vaginal mucus.", 
    "28": "The monophasic action potential (MAP) has been widely used for the study of drug effects on cardiac repolarization in vivo. There is, however, no study of drug-induced effects on MAP depolarization, i.e. effects on MAP Vmax and/or MAP rise-time. For this study, we developed a method in the anesthetized open chest guinea-pig. MAP signals were recorded and subjected to on-line computerized analysis, in which parameters describing both depolarization and repolarization were calculated. With the MAP electrode kept at the same epicardial position the MAP rise-time did not vary with time. If the influences of heart rate were eliminated, the intra- and interindividual variation in the MAP duration was very low. Sotalol significantly and dose-dependently prolonged MAP duration, but did not affect rise-time, whereas tocainide significantly and dose-dependently shortened MAP duration and increased rise-time. The effect of tocainide on rise-time is most likely secondary to a reduction in conduction velocity due to a decrease in Vmax in the single cell action potential. These results suggest that monophasic action potential recordings coupled with an on-line computerized analysis may be used for rapid and simple evaluation of drug effects, both on cardiac depolarization and repolarization.", 
    "29": "This controlled trial was designed to evaluate the prophylactic effect of nadolol on gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhotic patients with large oesophageal varices who had never bled. Nadolol or placebo was given randomly to two groups of 53 patients. The percentage of patients free of gastrointestinal bleeding 1 year after inclusion in the study was 83 +/- 6% (mean +/- S.D.) in the nadolol group and 80 +/- 6% in the placebo group. In the nadolol and placebo groups, 40 and 47 patients, respectively, were compliant, i.e., took nadolol or placebo continuously. The percentage of patients who were free of bleeding 1 year after inclusion was 97 +/- 3% in the subgroup of compliant nadolol patients. This percentage was significantly higher than that of patients who were free of bleeding in the placebo group (P less than 0.03) as well as in the subgroup of compliant placebo patients (77 +/- 6%; P less than 0.02). We concluded that, although there was no overall significant effect of nadolol on the risk of bleeding in cirrhotic patients in good condition with large oesophageal varices, this study suggests that nadolol reduced the risk of bleeding in compliant patients.", 
    "30": "In lightly anesthetized adult sheep, we determined tracheal mucosal blood flow (Qtr) by measuring the steady-state uptake of dimethyl ether from a tracheal chamber created by an endotracheal tube provided with two cuffs. Qtr normalized for carotid arterial pressure [Qtr(n)] was determined before and after the exposure of the tracheal mucosa to aerosolized phenylephrine (0.25-2.0 mg), isoproterenol (0.05-0.8 mg), and methacholine (2.5-20 mg). The same doses of methacholine were also administered during the intravenous infusion of vasopressin. The measurements were repeated after intravenous pretreatment with the respective antagonists phentolamine, propranolol, and atropine. Mean +/- SE base-line Qtr(n) was 1.2 +/- 0.1 ml.min-1.mmHg-1.10(2). The autonomic antagonists had no effect on mean Qtr(n). Phenylephrine produced a dose-dependent decrease in mean Qtr(n) (-70% at the highest dose), which was blunted by phentolamine, and isoproterenol produced a dose-dependent increase in mean Qtr(n) (40% at the highest dose), which was blocked by propranolol. Methacholine failed to alter mean Qtr(n) even when Qtr was first decreased by vasopressin. We conclude that in lightly anesthetized adult sheep 1) base-line Qtr(n) is not under adrenergic or cholinergic control, 2) a locally administered alpha-adrenergic agonist decreases and beta-adrenergic agonist increases Qtr(n) via specific receptor activation, and 3) a locally administered cholinergic muscarinic agonist has no effect on Qtr(n).", 
    "31": "Cytoskeletal organization in organ cultured embryonic chicken lens was affected by isoproterenol treatment. Immunofluorescent localization of a 49 kD fiber cell-specific cytoskeletal protein showed a cytoplasmic and membrane localization in control lenses. Following isoproterenol treatment, fluorescence was predominantly membrane-associated. Changes in 49 kD distribution as determined by immunofluorescence occurred within minutes of isoproterenol application and were completely blocked by propranolol pretreatment. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic stimulation influences the apparent localization of a fiber cell-specific cytoskeletal protein.", 
    "32": "Previous studies have indicated that some hypertensive patients, following a period of effective treatment with certain antihypertensive drugs, may experience prolonged normotension after drug withdrawal. We have studied the ability of carteolol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, to produce such remissions of hypertension. Thirty-four patients whose diastolic blood pressure was controlled at 90 mm Hg or less with carteolol monotherapy (2.5 to 5.0 mg/d for an average of 328 days) were randomized to a nine-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled drug-withdrawal trial. Those patients randomized to continue carteolol therapy had initially responded to carteolol treatment with reduction in blood pressure from 151 +/- 4/99 +/- 2 to 132 +/- 4/80 +/- 2 mm Hg. Those randomized to treatment with placebo had initially responded with blood pressure reductions from 154 +/- 4/97 +/- 2 to 137 +/- 4/81 +/- 2 mm Hg. Changes in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg +/- SEM) from baseline during carteolol therapy to the final visit at nine months were not different for patients receiving placebo (13 +/- 5/6 +/- 4 mm Hg, recumbent; 11 +/- 6/4 mm Hg, standing) or carteolol (11 +/- 5/7 +/- 3 mm Hg, recumbent; 12 +/- 6/7 +/- 3 mm Hg, standing). The final mean recumbent diastolic blood pressure (86.9 mm Hg) was the same in both groups. Prolonged normotension may follow a period of carteolol treatment, again suggesting the potential importance of periodic withdrawal of antihypertensive medication.", 
    "33": "To determine whether the association of nicardipine with propranolol had additive effects on myocardial metabolism, 16 patients with angina pectoris were studied invasively before and after 1 month of therapy with a combination of nicardipine and propranolol and compared to a group of 42 patients treated with nicardipine (n = 17) or propranolol (n = 25) alone. When data were compared at a fixed heart rate (atrial pacing), mean blood pressure was reduced with combined treatment from 96 +/- 19 to 76 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.003). Myocardial oxygen uptake and coronary sinus flow decreased significantly from 20 +/- 9 to 14 +/- 6 ml/min (p less than 0.015) and from 152 to 111 ml/min (p less than 0.05), respectively. The arterio-coronary sinus difference in oxygen content also decreased (13.3 to 12.5 ml/dl; p less than 0.0025), suggesting an improved balance between oxygen supply and demand. Such changes in coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen uptake were not observed in the group of patients assigned to monotherapy. Lactate uptake rose and the abnormal glutamine production, which worsened with propranolol monotherapy, improved with nicardipine and propranolol (-2.0 to -1.4 mumol/min; p less than 0.05 vs propranolol). The superiority of nicardipine and propranolol over propranolol monotherapy was maintained during a pacing stress test. Thus the combination of nicardipine with a beta blocker had greater oxygen-sparing effects and restored aerobic metabolism better than either drug alone, allowing optimal use of the coronary reserve.", 
    "34": "The effect of cetamolol (an investigational cardioselective beta blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) on the hypokalemic response to epinephrine infusions in normal subjects was evaluated and compared with placebo and two other beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. After two daily doses of cetamolol 15 mg, atenolol (a cardioselective beta blocker) 50 mg; a long-acting propranolol preparation (a nonselective beta blocker) 80 mg; or placebo, 12 men (mean age, 26.7 years) were infused with epinephrine. The resulting average plasma epinephrine level was 1123 pg/mL, whereas average baseline serum potassium levels for the four treatment groups ranged from 3.94 to 4.07 mEq/L. Epinephrine-induced hypokalemia occurred in the placebo group (maximum potassium decrease of 1.00 mEq/L) and in the atenolol group (maximum potassium decrease of 0.59 mEq/L); potassium levels did not decrease but rose slightly in subjects receiving cetamolol or propranolol. Subjects treated with placebo or atenolol also demonstrated statistically significant prolongation of the QTc interval (0.039 seconds with placebo; 0.023 seconds with atenolol) and frequently developed T-wave flattening and U-wave appearance. After pretreatment with cetamolol or propranolol, however, the QTc interval was unaffected, T-wave abnormalities did not occur, and U waves appeared only rarely. The results of this study indicate that cetamolol blocks epinephrine-induced hypokalemia and associated electrocardiographic changes.", 
    "35": "The efficacy and safety of esmolol, a titratable intravenous beta-adrenergic blocking agent with a short elimination half-life (t 1/2 = 9.0 min) was evaluated in a multicenter open-label study for the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (heart rate greater than 100 bpm). The study also investigated the feasibility of transferring patients from esmolol to alternate oral antiarrhythmic agents without loss of therapeutic response. Of the 113 patients studied, 95 (84%) achieved therapeutic response (reduction in heart rate of 15% or more or conversion to sinus rhythm). Most of these patients (93%) achieved the therapeutic response at esmolol doses of 200 micrograms/kg/min or lower. Transfer from esmolol to an oral antiarrhythmic agent(s) was studied in 76 patients. Alternate antiarrhythmic agents used in this study were digoxin (N = 25), propranolol (N = 21), verapamil (N = 10), metoprolol (N = 11), quinidine (N = 2), and a combination of two antiarrhythmic agents (N = 7). Sixty-seven (88%) patients were successfully transferred to oral antiarrhythmic agents without loss of the therapeutic response obtained with esmolol. The most frequent adverse effect observed during the study was hypotension, which resolved quickly (16 +/- 14 min) either by decreasing the dose or by discontinuation of esmolol infusion. This study supports previous observations concerning the safety and efficacy of esmolol in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the majority of patients successfully treated with esmolol can be safely and effectively transferred to oral therapy with alternate antiarrhythmic agents.", 
    "36": "The authors present two patients suffering from tardive akathisia. They also review the available literature on the subject. Propranolol was found to be an effective treatment of tardive akathisia in both patients. The implications of this finding are discussed.", 
    "37": "1. Effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol (40, 80 and 160 mg) and atenolol (50 and 100 mg) on the electroencephalogram and on body sway, were studied in 12 healthy male subjects. The study was double-blind, and included two placebos and an active control, oxazepam (15 mg). Medication was ingested at 11.00 h, and assessments were made before, and at 2 h and 4 h after ingestion. 2. All doses of both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists modified the electroencephalogram, and the changes reported were statistically significant at probability levels of less than 5%. The circadian rise in alpha activity was reduced by both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists as well as by oxazepam. Atenolol also decreased beta activity. 3. Body sway was modified by atenolol and oxazepam (P less than 0.05). The increase with oxazepam was most marked in the low frequency component (0.05-2.25 Hz) of the spectrum, while atenolol modified only the component of higher frequency (2.25-4.0 Hz). 4. These observations suggest that propranolol and atenolol have a sedative effect, and that hydrophilic antagonists are unlikely to be free of central activity. The changes in body sway could imply that peripheral mechanisms may be modified at least with atenolol.", 
    "38": "1. Central effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol (40, 80 and 160 mg) and atenolol (50 and 100 mg) were studied in 12 healthy male subjects. Two placebo ingestions and an active control (oxazepam 15 mg) were included. Single doses were administered double-blind at 11.00 h, and assessments of performance and subjective feelings were made before, 2 h and 4 h after ingestion. 2. Performance was measured using letter cancellation, digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, choice reaction time, finger tapping, short term and immediate memory, critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. Subjective feelings were assessed using twelve visual-analogue scales. 3. Oxazepam impaired performance at letter cancellation (P less than 0.001), digit symbol substitution (P less than 0.05), continuous attention (P less than 0.001), immediate recall (P less than 0.05) and finger tapping (P less than 0.05), but neither of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists affected these measures. Propranolol (40 and 160 mg) also impaired short term memory (P less than 0.05), though it was not possible to establish this effect with atenolol. 4. Subjective alertness was reduced by oxazepam (P less than 0.01) and atenolol (P less than 0.05), while propranolol (40 mg) reduced anxiety (P less than 0.01) and propranolol (80 mg) impaired ability to concentrate (P less than 0.05). 5. The results suggest that both lipophilic and hydrophilic antagonists modify the central nervous system, though impairment may be difficult to establish with conventional tests. The observations on memory and alertness suggest that the central effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may be subtle.", 
    "39": "The effects of topical timolol vs betaxolol on cardiopulmonary exercise performance were studied in a randomised double-masked fashion in 12 healthy male volunteers. Cardiopulmonary parameters were evaluated at the anaerobic threshold and at peak exercise. Intraocular pressure was determined before and after treatment by applanation tonometry. No differences were found in aerobic or peak exercise capacity. Maximal heart rate was slightly lower (P less than 0.05) following treatment with timolol compared with betaxolol. However, a correspondingly higher oxygen pulse (oxygen uptake/heart rate) compensated for this reduction and resulted in no difference in peak performance. At physiological work levels, it was not possible to demonstrate any influence of topical, selective or non-selective, beta-adrenergic blockade on cardiopulmonary exercise performance in these healthy volunteers.", 
    "40": "In the present study 75 patients were double blind randomized either to receive 10 mg propranolol orally 4 times a day (35 patients) or a placebo (40 patients). Episodes of clinically important supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were recorded in the first 4 postoperative days. They appeared in 5 of 35 patients receiving propranolol and in 5 of 40 patients receiving placebo (no statistically significant difference). In conclusion this study indicates the need for further evaluation to clarify if low-dose propranolol or any other drug is effective in reducing the frequency of SVT in the early postoperative period after coronary artery bypass surgery.", 
    "41": "During 1986, 343 consecutive patients who underwent isolated coronary bypass grafting were given 10 mg of propranolol three times daily for six postoperative weeks to help prevent supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. The incidence of these arrhythmias in this group was compared to that in a similar group of 337 consecutive patients who underwent coronary surgery in 1984 at the same institution and did not receive propranolol. There was no significant difference in the overall incidence of such arrhythmias between the propranolol group (10.8%) and the control group (10.4%). In preoperatively beta-blocked patients, the arrhythmia incidence in the propranolol group (9.9%) was lower than that in the control group (13.8%) but the difference did not achieve statistical significance. The two groups were also similar with respect to the ventricular response rates at the onset of the arrhythmia and the effectiveness of therapeutic intervention. These results suggest that propranolol in the above dosage does not significantly reduce the incidence of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias after myocardial revascularisation.", 
    "42": "The effects of atenolol and another three beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on norepinephrine (NE)-induced cardiac responses were examined in isolated and perfused rat hearts following a Langendorff method. Bolus injection of atenolol did not show significant inhibitory effects on NE-induced increases in myocardial contractile force (MCF) and heart rate. Bolus injections of metoprolol and timolol were also ineffective for inhibiting NE-responses. However, both bolus injection and infusion of propranolol or infusion of atenolol, metoprolol and timolol all significantly inhibited NE-responses. On sustained increase in MCF induced by infusion of NE, the inhibitory effect of atenolol was transient, while that of propranolol was continuous. From these results, it is concluded that atenolol displays a different time course of action on NE-induced cardiac responses by bolus injection or infusion because of its pharmacological properties, which may be due to its low lipophilicity.", 
    "43": "Topically applied O-butyryl timolol, O-pivaloyl timolol and levobunolol (0.25 micrograms) antagonized isoproterenol-induced ocular hypotension for 8 hrs whereas timolol (0.25 micrograms) was shorter acting (4 hrs). Timolol (25 micrograms) produced greater antagonism of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia than did O-butyryl and O-pivaloyl timolol (25 micrograms). These results suggest that, at similar doses, O-butyryl and O-pivaloyl timolol produce high concentrations of timolol in ocular tissues and undergo redistribution more slowly into the systemic circulation than does topical timolol. Under certain circumstances, prodrugs may provide a mechanism for increasing selectivity and extending the duration of action in the target organ as well as decreasing systemic effects.", 
    "44": "The acute effects of betaxolol (10 mg, intravenously), a new cardioselective beta-blocker, and propranolol (15 mg, intravenously) on splanchnic and systemic circulations were studied in two matched groups of six patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis. Similar decreases in hepatic venous pressure gradient and azygous blood flow--an estimation of superior portosystemic shunts--were observed after both drugs, whereas hepatic blood flow was not modified. The decreases in heart rate and cardiac index were also similar after betaxolol and propranolol. Both drugs induced a significant decrease in the fraction of cardiac output flowing through superior portosystemic shunts. These findings confirm that the marked effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on splanchnic circulation results both from the reduction in cardiac output and from a vasoconstriction of the portal vein territory, and demonstrate that this vasoconstriction of the portal vein area does not necessitate a beta 2-blocking activity of the drug. The similar efficiency of the two agents in decreasing the hyperkinetic circulation suggests that betaxolol merits further long-term study in the pharmacologic treatment of portal hypertension.", 
    "45": "Since the approval of timolol for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have replaced epinephrine, a pure alpha and beta agonist, as the treatment of choice for glaucoma in aphakic patients. To date, there have been no reports of cystoid macular edema secondary to timolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker that apparently has little intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Betaxolol is a new beta-adrenergic receptor blocker that preferentially blocks beta 1 receptors. We report a case of angiographically proven cystoid macular edema secondary to betaxolol therapy that resolved after discontinuation and recurred after a monocular therapeutic trial.", 
    "46": "Identification of endogenous toxins and characterization of the mechanisms by which toxins produce cell injury and death may help understand both normal modeling of cell populations and connections in the CNS as well as abnormal cell loss. The toxicity of catecholamines intrinsic to the CNS was investigated using the model system of rat cerebral cortex in dissociated cell culture. All catecholamines tested, including norepinephrine (NE), dopamine, and epinephrine, were toxic to neurons as well as glia at a concentration of 25 microM when added to cultures 24 hr after plating. Toxicity was evident after 48 hr exposure to NE, as monitored by loss of cells from the cultures. Toxicity did not seem to be mediated by adrenergic receptors because, although the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (but not the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine) was similar in its toxic effect to NE, the beta-adrenergic antagonist atenolol did not block the toxic effect of NE. Toxicity could be mimicked by hydrogen peroxide, a product of the oxidative degradation of catecholamines. Toxicity of NE was blocked by catalase. The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), supposedly selective for catecholaminergic neurons, was found to be toxic over the same concentration range as NE. These results suggest that endogenous catecholamines may play a role in normal and abnormal cell death, and suggest that caution be used in relying on the specificity of 6-OHDA and other supposedly selective neurotoxins.", 
    "47": "Host kidneys may contribute considerably to hypertension after renal transplantation. Their role in sustaining hypertension is more prominent if glomerulonephritis (GN) than if interstitial nephritis (IN) is the original renal disease. We compared the antihypertensive effect of beta-blockade in IN (n = 10) and GN (n = 19) hypertensive renal transplant recipients with host kidneys in situ with those who had undergone bilateral nephrectomy (BN, n = 10). Pretreatment blood pressures were comparable in BN, IN, and GN patients, being 165 +/- 6/108 +/- 3, 172 +/- 5/104 +/- 3, and 161 +/- 3/104 +/- 1, mmHg, respectively. Blood pressure did not change on beta-blockade in BN patients, whereas it decreased significantly more (P less than 0.001) in GN than in IN patients, changes of mean arterial pressure being -107 +/- 1.0, -14.9 +/- 1.3, and -6.8 +/- 1.6%, respectively. This failure to respond to beta-blockade in patients without host kidneys may be related to low activity of the renin-angiotensin system or to functional denervation of the grafted kidney. Further investigations of this phenomenon may clarify the mechanism of antihypertensive action of beta-blockade as well as the nature of hypertension after renal transplantation.", 
    "48": "The activity of the beta adrenoceptor antagonist tertatolol on renal vasoconstrictions was investigated. Infusion of increasing concentrations of tertatolol (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) progressively inhibited the constrictor responses to bolus injections of norepinephrine and to electrical stimulation in isolated perfused kidneys of both normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Also, in kidneys of normotensive rats the vasoconstrictions caused by serotonin and barium chloride were inhibited by tertatolol. During sustained vasoconstrictions induced by infusion of norepinephrine (6 X 10(-7) M) increasing doses of tertatolol (2.5 X 10(-7) g to 2 X 10(-5) g) caused rapid, reversible dilatations in the rat kidneys. The inhibitory responses caused by tertatolol were not antagonized by propranolol, atropine, hexamethonium, SCH23390, metoclopramide, mepyramine, cimetidine, naloxone, cocaine or indomethacin. During constrictions caused by norepinephrine, methylene blue significantly inhibited the renal vasodilatations caused by tertatolol, acetylcholine, papaverine and nitroglycerin but not those caused by atrial natriuretic factor. Unlike the other vasodilators, tertatolol did not inhibit the constrictions induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha (5 X 10(-6) M) in the rat kidneys. In canine renal arteries with endothelium, tertatolol (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) did not cause relaxations during contractions induced by norepinephrine, electrical stimulation or prostaglandin F2 alpha. Our data illustrate that tertatolol has potent vasodilator properties in the isolated perfused vasoconstricted rat kidney. The dilator response to the beta blocker cannot be inhibited by a variety of classical receptor blockers but ultimately seems to depend on the formation of cyclic GMP.", 
    "49": "Recent behavioral evidence suggests that enhancement of noradrenergic neurotransmission may alter the functional sensitivity of serotonin2 (5-HT2) receptors in the central nervous system. The present studies have examined the effects of two types of noradrenergic denervation [neurotoxic: via N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4) treatment; and pharmacologic: via chronic beta adrenergic receptor blockade] on the 5-HT2-mediated head shake response and cortical beta adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptor number in the rat. No changes in quipazine-induced head shakes were observed 3 days after DSP4 lesion. However, the frequency of head shakes was significantly enhanced 10 days after DSP4 treatment in the presence of a 39% up-regulation of beta adrenergic receptors. Pretreatment with propranolol 10 days after DSP4 lesion selectively antagonized the enhancement of the behavioral response to quipazine without altering base-line response rate, whereas pretreatment with the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin totally blocked head shakes in both control and DSP4-treated rats. Pharmacologic denervation achieved by continuous (14 day) administration of the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol also resulted in a potentiation of the head shake response (274% of control) and an upregulation of beta adrenergic receptors (44%). Conversely, continuous treatment with the beta adrenergic agonist clenbuterol resulted in a marked reduction in head shakes (36% of control) with a concomitant 29% down-regulation of beta adrenergic receptors. 5-HT2 receptor binding was not modified by either DSP4 lesion or continuous administration of beta adrenergic agonists or antagonists. These studies demonstrate that changes in cortical beta adrenergic receptor density may modify 5-HT2-mediated behavior in a manner that is independent of changes in 5-HT2 receptor number.", 
    "50": "This investigation was undertaken to determine the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the regulation of the protein composition of rat parotid saliva. Chronic treatment of rats with dobutamine, a beta 1-adrenergic agonist, resulted in changes in parotid saliva volume, protein concentration, and composition which were essentially the same as those changes which occurred following chronic treatment with isoproterenol, a non-specific beta-adrenergic agonist. Chronic treatment with the beta 2-adrenergic agonist, terbutaline, had no effect on parotid saliva volume, protein concentration, or composition. Chronic treatment of rats with a beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, metoprolol, had different effects on saliva dependent on the manner by which the drug was delivered. Twice-daily injections of metoprolol led to a decrease in flow rate, but protein concentration and composition were unaltered. When metoprolol was delivered by surgically implanted osmotic minipumps, neither the flow of parotid saliva nor its concentration of protein was altered; however, there was a reduction in the proportion of proline-rich proteins in saliva. Comparable changes in parotid saliva protein composition occurred when the minipumps delivered propranolol, a non-specific beta-adrenergic antagonist. Chronic treatment of rats with an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist (clonidine) or antagonist (yohimbine) was without effect on parotid saliva flow rate, protein concentration, or composition. These findings suggest that the synthesis of proline-rich proteins is regulated, in part, by beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, and primarily by the beta 1-receptor subtype.", 
    "51": "Corticotropin (ACTH) secretion by the anterior pituitary is stimulated by catecholamines in vivo and in vitro. The nature of the response in vivo is controversial but appears to be mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors, whereas the response is dependent on alpha-adrenergic receptors in cultured anterior pituitary cells. In the present studies, by using a superfusion technique, we demonstrate that catecholamine stimulation of ACTH release from rat anterior pituitaries changes with time from a predominantly beta-adrenergic-mediated event to a predominantly alpha-adrenergic-mediated event. From 0 to 2 hr after initiating the superfusion, release of ACTH from anterior pituitary glands is stimulated up to 2.4-fold by the beta-adrenergic agonist l-isoproterenol. However, the ACTH secretory response to the alpha-adrenergic agonist l-phenylephrine is less than or equal to 5% of that to l-isoproterenol during the same time period. Beginning 2 hr after the start of the superfusion, the responsiveness to the beta-adrenergic agonist declines, and the response to the alpha-adrenergic agonist increases until, 10 hr after removal, greater than 95% of the catecholamine-inducible ACTH release is mediated by an alpha-adrenergic pathway. The addition of interleukin 1 alone to the medium from the beginning of the superfusion does not modify basal ACTH secretion rates and does not affect the acquisition of the response to phenylephrine. However, the presence of interleukin 1 does allow the maintenance of the full ACTH secretory response to isoproterenol. This effect of interleukin 1 is reversed by an interleukin 1 antagonist. These observations suggest an additional way in which immune regulators might interact with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.", 
    "52": "We have used two different cultured cell lines--S49 lymphoma cells and BC3H-1 muscle cells--to examine the regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors by receptor antagonists. Rather than an increase (\"up-regulation\") of receptor number that such antagonists often produce, we found that certain beta-blockers elicit a decrease (\"down-regulation\") of beta-adrenergic receptors. Alprenolol and propranolol, but not sotalol or ICI 118,551, at concentrations of 10-100 nM down-regulated beta-adrenergic receptors 20-70% following 16-20 hours of treatment of S49 or BC3H-1 cells. Several observations suggest that this phenomenon depends upon beta-receptor interaction, including stereoselectivity [(-)-enantiomers more potent than (+)-enantiomers], blockade of the effect by ICI 118,551, absence of down-regulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors in BC3H-1 cells, and lack of a decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor-independent (forskolin-stimulated) cyclic AMP accumulation in S49 cells. The possibility of retained antagonist interfering with receptor measurement was precluded by the fact that the antagonist-induced decrease in receptor number required several hours incubation and occurred without a prominent change in receptor affinity. The ability of the beta-blockers to elicit down-regulation did not correlate with hydrophobicity of the drugs. Antagonist-induced down regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors did not occur in S49 lymphoma cells that lack the alpha-subunit of Gs, the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein, thus implying a requirement for receptor-alpha s interaction in eliciting beta-receptor down-regulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "We have previously reported that a potent new beta-blocker, tertatolol, when given at therapeutic doses to healthy volunteers, rapidly reduced the number of human mononuclear leukocyte beta-receptors. In the present study, the mechanism of receptor regulation by beta-antagonists incubated with target cells in vitro was investigated. Two different cell types (human mononuclear leukocytes and S49 murine lymphoma cells) were used, and beta-adrenergic receptors were measured using either the hydrophilic ligand 3H-CGP 12177 (specific for surface receptors) or lipophilic 125I-pindolol (which measures total receptors). In a comparison between beta-blockers, tertatolol and bopindolol, but not propranolol and pindolol, were found to rapidly (1 hour at 37 degrees C) reduce the number of beta-adrenergic receptors. This was paralleled by a reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. The reduction in receptors was the same whether surface or total receptors were measured; thus, it was not due to receptor sequestration. This effect was not caused by partial agonist activity (bopindolol is a weak partial agonist); in parallel experiments, tertatolol and bopindolol, but not pindolol (potent partial agonist) and isoproterenol (full agonist), reduced beta-adrenergic receptors. Finally, this effect was not due to irreversible binding: the receptor reduction induced by the irreversible blocker bromo-acetyl-alprenolol-methane (BAAM) was stable for several hours, while the effect of tertatolol and bopindolol was slowly reversed over the same time course. We suggest that tertatolol and bopindolol have two effects on beta-adrenergic receptors: they bind competitively, and then they modify the receptors so that they are no longer available for binding by ligands or catecholamines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "In 1982 we showed that angiotensin II (Agt II) stimulates the bioelectric properties of the isolated toad skin and that this effect is blocked by pretreatment of the skin with indomethacine [J. B. Concha et al., IRCS Med. Sci. 10, 584 (1982)]. Ussing's technique and several inhibitors were used to continue this study on the isolated Pleurodema thaul skin. Serosal Agt II produced a dose-dependent increase in electrical parameters: a maximal concentration of 6 X 10(-6) M Agt II increased potential difference by 43 +/- 7.8% and short-circuit current by 51.5 +/- 7.7%. The responses were not affected by either alpha or beta blockers or by atropine. Indomethacine blocked responses to the calcium ionophore A23187 and to Agt II which were similar to each other. Additive effects of Agt II and of the calcium ionophore A23187 were found. No response to Agt II was obtained when Ca2+-free Ringer was used on the serosal side. Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, verapamil, manganese), pentobarbitone and saralasin blocked the response to Agt II. This pharmacological evidence is in favour of the hypothesis that Agt II activates specific membrane receptors, leading to Ca2+ release and formation of prostaglandins which stimulate adenyl cyclase. This increases cAMP secretion, which in turn increases apical membrane permeability to sodium and enhances the active transport system.", 
    "55": "Three of 27 patients treated for pheochromocytoma between 1974 and 1987 presented with pheochromocytoma multisystem crisis (PMC). This unusual presentation consists of multiple organ system failure, temperature often greater than 40 degrees C, encephalopathy, and hypertension and/or hypotension. Although urgent medical therapy achieved blood pressure control in all three patients, the other manifestations of PMC progressed rapidly in spite of alpha and even beta blockade. The first patient died during attempts to localize a septic focus. The other two patients underwent urgent adrenalectomy and had postoperative improvement in their multiple organ system failure. All three tumors were large and produced markedly elevated levels of epinephrine. In conclusion (1) PMC is an unusual presentation of pheochromocytoma; (2) its manifestations include multiple organ system failure, high fever, encephalopathy, and vascular lability; (3) it may result from increased epinephrine secretion; and (4) successful treatment of PMC demands prompt diagnosis, vigorous medical preparation, and emergency tumor removal if the patient's condition continues to deteriorate.", 
    "56": "The role of endogenous beta-adrenergic activation in the pathogenesis of spontaneous myocardial fibrosis was investigated in male and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. For the purpose of blocking endogenous beta-adrenergic activities, atenolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking a agent, was given at 20, 80 and 320 mg/kg/day mixed in the diet for 12 months. The transverse sections of the ventricles including the vulnerable region for spontaneous myocardial fibrosis was stained by Azan-Mallory method for collagen fibers and examined morphometrically, while being compared with the histological findings from standard hematoxylin-eosin procedure. The fibrosis was graded into 4 classes and compared between nontreated groups and treated groups of both sexes. Fibrous foci developed principally in the subendocardial myocardium. Atenolol failed to produce significant systemic toxic effects not only on weight gains and daily intakes of food but also on death rates. Atenolol did not prevent development of myocardial lesions in both sexes, whereas it significantly promoted fibrosis in the medium and high dose groups of male rats but not at any dose levels in female animals. It is suggested that endogenous beta-adrenergic activation plays no major role in the onset or development of spontaneous myocardial lesions, whereas the adrenergic system may probably control collagen synthesis in myocardial fibrosis.", 
    "57": "Adult calcium tolerant rat ventricular myocytes were maintained under serum-free culture conditions for five days. beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor expression was assessed by radioligand binding determinations using 125I-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) and [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), respectively. The binding data were correlated with myocyte structural integrity and contractile responsiveness to norepinephrine (NE). During the 5 days in primary culture, beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding capacity diminished Bmax = 17.1 to 9.2 fmol/mg protein and Bmax = 169.0 to 26.6 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The affinity of both autonomic receptors was unaltered during the period of observation. The majority of isolated myocytes were viable (65 to 85%) and remained rod-shaped for 5 days as assessed by phase contrast microscopy. Up to 2 days in vitro the rod-shaped myocytes appeared ultrastructurally similar to their in vivo counterparts and displayed intact nuclei and the usual complement of cellular organelles. From day 3, phase contrast as well as transmission electron microscopy revealed a progressive increase in autophagic vacuoles consisting primarily of disrupted mitochondria. The number of myocytes that contracted in response to norepinephrine (NE) decreased from 57.2 to 2.3% by day 5. These data indicate that adult rat cardiac myocytes maintained in serum free culture for 5 days, express beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. There is a rapid decline (50%) in muscarinic cholinergic receptor number and contractile response to NE by day 2. However, the decrease in beta-receptor Bmax by day two is insufficient to explain the severe loss of cell responsiveness to NE. This functional loss may be related, at least in part, to the ultrastructural abnormalities that are first evident at day 2 in culture. Thus, short-term myocyte cultures that retain phenotypic and physiologic characteristics of in vivo cardiac myocytes could provide a useful in vitro system for exploring pharmacologic-functional interactions in the myocardium.", 
    "58": "The effect of no drug or timolol (5 mg/kg, PO, for 1, 2, or 8 weeks on postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge, blood pressure, heart rate and beta-receptor density after acute coronary occlusion of the left anterior descending artery was compared. Beta-receptor density, determined by binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol, was examined in the myocardium (LA = left atrium, RA = right atrium, LV1 = proximal and LV2 = distal left anterior descending artery distribution, LV3 = posterior left ventricle, S = septum, and RV = right ventricle). In control cats (no coronary occlusion or timolol) beta-receptor density of LV2 and LV3 was greater (P less than .05) than LA, RA, LV1, and RV. LV3 was greater (P less than .05) than S and RA, and LA was less than S. Longer treatment with timolol increased beta-receptor density. When compared with no timolol, beta-receptor density was greater in RA after 8 weeks and in LV1 after 2 weeks and not different in LV2 and S. Beta-receptor density and LV3 and RV were greater after 8 weeks than after 1 week or no timolol. Spearman rank correlation coefficients between dose and beta-receptor density revealed an increase (P less than .05) for all heart areas. Heart rate did not vary before timolol and was decreased after all doses of timolol. Timolol increased the mean times to coronary occlusion-induced death although the increase was not statistically significant. Timolol did not prevent postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge associated with arrhythmia. Timolol may increase beta-receptor density and decrease synaptic norepinephrine, causing a decreased release per cardiac sympathetic nerve impulse. Alternatively, molecules of timolol may accumulate in nerve endings and be released in greater concentrations at the receptors. This could explain the protection against coronary occlusion-induced arrhythmia and death.", 
    "59": "1. We describe the actions of a novel and selective 5-HT1-like receptor agonist, GR43175, in a range of isolated tissue preparations containing different 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor types. 2. GR43175 was a potent agonist at 5-HT1-like receptors mediating contraction of the dog isolated saphenous vein and also at those inhibiting neuronally mediated contractions in the same preparations. For both actions, GR43175 was approximately four times weaker than 5-HT. 3. GR43175 was devoid of agonist properties at 5-HT1-like receptors mediating relaxation of the cat isolated saphenous vein. 4. GR43175 was devoid of agonist properties at 5-HT2 receptors mediating contraction of the rabbit isolated aorta, pig coronary artery, greyhound coronary artery and beagle femoral artery. 5. GR43175 was devoid of agonist properties at 5-HT3 receptors mediating depolarization of the rat isolated vagus nerve. 6. The contractile response to GR43175 in the dog isolated saphenous vein was selectively antagonized by methiothepin but was resistant to antagonism by the 5-HT2 receptor blocking drug ketanserin and the 5-HT3 receptor blocking drug MDL 72222. Methiothepin antagonized the contractile action of 5-HT and GR43175 to an equal extent suggesting that both agonists act at the same receptor. 7. The results demonstrate that GR43175 is a highly selective agonist for the 5-HT1-like receptors found in the dog saphenous vein. The absence of an action of GR43175 at 5-HT1-like receptors mediating relaxation of the cat isolated saphenous vein provides further evidence that 5-HT1-like receptors are heterogeneous.", 
    "60": "Acute dog experiments involving the perfusion of donor coronary arteries demonstrated that alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulation in the presence of a beta-adrenergic block resulted in a 30% drop of coronary flow. This response is maintained at low perfusion coronary blood pressure values (up to 25 +/- 13 mmHg, p less than 0.02), whereas coronary dilatation reserve is already fully depleted at 60 +/- 8 mmHg, suggesting that the degree of coronary arterial stenosis associated with coronary insufficiency may be a decisive factor shaping coronary response to alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulation.", 
    "61": "1. Neuronal activity in the central amygdaloid nucleus (ACE) was recorded during a visually guided bar-press feeding task, and the modulatory effects of catecholaminergic blockers were investigated. 2. The feeding task had the following four phases: 1) a cue light to signal the start of bar press, 2) bar press, 3) a short cue tone followed by food delivery, and 4) ingestion reward. Of 278 cells observed, 176 (63%) increased or decreased their discharge rates in one or more phases of the feeding task. Of these, 60 (34%) responded to the cue light, 81 (46%) to the bar press, 66 (37%) to the cue tone, and 176 (100%) during the reward period. In the ingestion reward phase, firing of 128 (73%) increased and firing of 48 (27%) decreased. The reward-related response depended on the nature of food. In the trials with aversion food, some neurons increased firing (n = 6), whereas others showed opposite firing changes (n = 10). 3. The decreased firing rate during the reward period was greatly attenuated in the no-reward tasks (n = 29) and was blocked by electrophoretic application of a beta-adrenoceptive antagonist [sotalol (SOT), n = 26]. Noradrenaline (NA) application mimicked the inhibitory effect on the reward-related activity during extinction trial (n = 4). These results suggest that the decreased firing rate observed during the reward period was modulated by beta-adrenoreceptors. 4. Of 32 neurons tested, the activity of 8 (25%) and 14 (44%) were enhanced by the cue light or bar press, respectively. These effects were attenuated by electrophoretic application of a dopamine (DA) antagonist [spiperone (SPP)] but not by SOT. This indicates that dopaminergic inputs may be related to recognition of visual signals and to motor initiation during the monkey feeding paradigm.", 
    "62": "The purpose of the study was to determine whether catecholamines modulate cholinergic neurotransmission in isolated human airway smooth muscle. Bronchial rings were suspended in organ baths for isometric measurement of tension, and contractions were induced by either electrical field stimulation (EFS) or exogenous acetylcholine (ACh). Isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in that order of potency produced concentration-dependent inhibition of comparable responses to EFS and ACh. However a potency difference of 100-fold for isoproterenol (IC50 = 4.80 X 10(-8) M for EFS and 3.70 X 10(-6) M for ACh) and 10-fold for both epinephrine and norepinephrine was observed for inhibition of responses to EFS compared with responses to ACh. The inhibitory effects of isoproterenol on responses to EFS were prevented by propranolol and ICI 118551 (a beta 2-antagonist) but not by betaxolol (a beta 1-antagonist). Tyramine had no effect on contractions elicited by EFS. These experiments demonstrate that beta-agonists inhibit cholinergic nerve-induced contractions of human bronchi more potently than contractions induced by exogenous ACh, suggesting modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission by prejunctional beta 2-receptors.", 
    "63": "The clearance function of complement receptors on Kupffer cells is depressed after several forms of experimental injury. In vitro studies have shown that stimulation of beta-receptors on macrophages causes a depression of several aspects of macrophage function. The present study evaluated the possibility that the increase in sympathetic activity associated with injury contributes to the depression of Kupffer cell complement receptor function. Complement receptor function was assessed in rats from the hepatic uptake of rat erythrocytes coated with IgM. Isoproterenol caused a depression of receptor function when infused at a rate of 5.0 and 0.5 micrograms/kg/min for 15 min but not after infusion of 0.05 micrograms/kg/min. Infusion of isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine at 0.5 micrograms/kg/min depressed receptor function by 41%, 38%, and 29%, respectively. Beta-receptor blockade with propranolol prevented the depression of receptor function caused by isoproterenol and norepinephrine. Thermal injury depressed receptor function by 65%, and this depression was reduced to 35% by beta-receptor blockade. Therefore, stimulation of beta-receptors on macrophages by increased circulating levels of catecholamines after injury could contribute to the depression of Kupffer cell function caused by injury.", 
    "64": "To test the hypothesis that alpha 2-adrenoceptor activity exerts a dual control of coronary blood flow, i.e., vasoconstriction and augmentation of the vasodilatory effect of adenosine, four doses of adenosine were infused into left anterior descending coronary artery before and during alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation or attenuation in anesthetized open-chest dogs. During a moderate alpha 2-adrenoceptor attenuation (yohimbine or rauwolscine, ic), which did not alter coronary blood flow (CBF) at the base-line condition, the hyperemic response of CBF to infused adenosine was markedly reduced, whereas during the potent attenuation both base-line CBF and adenosine-induced hyperemic CBF were significantly increased. Inversely, the moderate alpha 2-stimulation (0.03 microgram.kg-1.min-1 norepinephrine with prazosin, ic, or 0.04 microgram.kg-1.min-1 clonidine ic, under propranolol pretreatment) augmented the adenosine-induced coronary vasodilation, but the potent alpha 2-stimulation (0.3 microgram.kg-1.min-1 norepinephrine with prazosin ic, or 0.3 microgram.kg-1.min-1 clonidine ic) reduced both base-line CBF hyperemic CBF. In contrast, alpha 2-adrenoceptor activity did not affect papaverine-induced coronary vasodilation. Moreover, the reactive hyperemic flow after a brief coronary occlusion was reduced significantly during the moderate alpha 2-adrenergic attenuation, but it was augmented during the potent one. These results indicate that the moderate activation of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor augments the hyperemic response of CBF to both exogenous and endogenous adenosine, whereas the potent alpha 2-activation may mask this vasodilatory effect through the coronary vasoconstrictive effect.", 
    "65": "Recent studies suggest that beta-adrenergic blocking agents show promise in the management of cardiomyopathies; however, their role in acute myocarditis is unknown. One hundred 3 week old mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 and were given either metoprolol (n = 50) or normal saline solution (n = 50) intraperitoneally for 10 days. Twenty mice from each group were observed for mortality for 30 days. Of the remaining 60 mice, 10 from each group were killed on day 3, 6 or 10 and examined for heart viral titers and pathologic changes. Mortality rate in the metoprolol group was 60% compared with 0% in the saline group (p less than 0.005). Viral titers on day 10 of infection were 10(2.6 +/- 0.2) median tissue culture infective dose for the metoprolol group versus 10(2.1 +/- 0.1) for the saline group (p less than 0.05). Whereas pathologic changes at days 3, 6 and 10 of infection were similar in both groups, on day 30 of infection, inflammation, necrosis and mineralization scores (mean +/- SEM) were 1.1 +/- 0.3, 2.1 +/- 0.4, 2.2 +/- 0.5 for the metoprolol group versus 0.3 +/- 0.1, 0.4 +/- 0.3, 0.4 +/- 0.3 for the saline group, respectively (p less than 0.01). Six noninfected mice received metoprolol intraperitoneally for 10 days; there was no mortality during 30 days of observation. In conclusion, metoprolol administration exerts deleterious effects in acute coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis.", 
    "66": "Rabbit myometrium contains postsynaptic alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta-2 adrenoreceptors. The response to endogenous catecholamines depends on the summation of interactions at these receptors and is influenced by the hormonal environment. Estrogen treatment of ovariectomized rabbits increases the alpha adrenergic contractile response whereas progesterone treatment of estrogen primed animals results in a predominance of the beta adrenergic response, which is inhibition of contractions. Of the receptor subtypes, only the alpha-2 receptor concentration is increased at physiological estrogen concentrations. However, alpha-2 receptors have not been shown to be directly involved in myometrial contraction, which appears to be mediated solely by alpha-1 adrenergic interactions. To test whether alpha-2 receptors might indirectly affect contraction by opposing interactions at the beta receptor, we examined the ability of alpha adrenergic stimulation to reduce myometrial cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) generation. We find that alpha-2 receptors inhibit myometrial ade adenylate cyclase through the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, Gi. In addition, we find that activation of alpha-1 receptors also reduces cAMP generation. This interaction, which can be demonstrated in the absence but not the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, does not appear to be mediated through Gi. These findings illustrate the complexity of adrenergic interactions in tissues containing several adrenergic subtypes.", 
    "67": "In rats synthesis of some acute phase reactants can be induced by a combination of corticosteroids and adrenaline. During fever both hormones show high plasma levels. We studied the effect of fever induced by intra-cerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of PGE2 on the acute phase response. Fever was continuously recorded and 24 h after induction acute phase reactant (APR) response was measured as indicated by the rise of alpha-macrofetoprotein (alpha M FP, alpha 2 macroglobulin of the rat). Controls received 0.9% saline i.c.v. Controls did not develop fever (dTmax less than or equal to 1 degree C) nor did they show significant APR response. The maximal rise in body temperature after PGE2 (2.6 +/- 0.7 degrees C) correlated significantly with the rise in alpha M FP concentration 24 h later. Adrenalectomy prevented the APR response completely but the magnitude of the fever reaction remained the same (2.1 +/- 0.3 degrees C). alpha-Blockade gave a smaller fever response but had no effect on the APR response. In alpha- and beta-blockade, fever response was normal but no APR response was obtained. Destroying the sympathetic nerve supply to the liver with 6-OH dopamine retarded the fever response but again APR response was not impeded. In order to differentiate between the role of fever as such and the effect of PGE2 on APR synthesis, we used heat exposure to induce hyperthermia in normal rats who showed an APR response comparable with that after i.c.v. PGE2. Pretreatment with sodium salicylate before inducing hyperthermia led to a variable rise in alpha M FP. Fever as such, without tissue injury, induces an APR response. The pathway to this effect probably involves circulating corticosterone and adrenaline, possibly via a beta-receptor mediated stimulation.", 
    "68": "In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), 5-day intravenous infusions with the beta-adrenoceptor blockers propranolol (5 mg/kg/day) or tertatolol (0.5 mg/kg/day) caused a chronic reduction of blood pressure (-12% +/- 1% and -28% +/- 1%, respectively, on day 5) and heart rate (-13% +/- 3% and -8% +/- 2%, respectively, on day 5). Propranolol infusion led to a 23%-31% reduction of blood flow through the renal, mesenteric, and hindquarter vascular bed. Tertatolol caused similar flow reductions, with the exception of the renal vascular bed, which was dilated. Tertatolol induced reduction of renal vascular resistance of 29% +/- 2% on day 5. These studies show a long-term renal vasodilatory activity of tertatolol during chronic administration to SHR.", 
    "69": "The clinical benefit of beta-adrenoceptor partial agonists is still debated. To clarify the situation, epanolol, ICI 141,292 [N-[-2-(3-o-cyanophenoxy-2-hydroxypropylamino)ethyl]-4- hydroxyphenylactamide], has been developed to assess the role of modest beta-adrenoceptor partial agonist activity in humans. Animal studies have shown that epanolol is a potent beta-adrenoceptor partial agonist with a greater affinity for beta 1- than beta 2-adrenoceptors. In vitro, the PA2 values obtained for espanolol at atrial and tracheal beta-adrenoceptors were 8.42 and 6.33, respectively (isoproterenol as agonist), giving a selectivity ratio of 123. The potency was studied in vivo in the dog, where it was also shown that as an antagonist at the cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptor, it was 18 and 40 times more potent than atenolol and practolol, respectively. Espanolol has less partial agonist activity in the rat than pindolol, but more than practolol. In this species, it is also a classical partial agonist, exhibiting agonist activity at all beta-adrenoceptor blocking doses. This is in contrast to pindolol, which caused predominantly beta-adrenoceptor blockade at low doses and partial agonist activity at higher doses. These differences were confirmed in haemodynamic studies in the dog. In contrast to many other partial agonists, the partition coefficient, log P, of epanolol in octanol and water is low (0.92).", 
    "70": "The objective of the present study was to compare the quantitative differences in the beta 1- vs. beta 2-adrenoceptor affinity and selectivity of cetamolol and its enantiomers to the reference compounds atenolol, betaxolol, and ICI-118,551, using isolated tissues obtained from the dog, guinea pig, and rat. Cetamolol antagonized the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses induced by isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and salbutamol, in tissues from both the dog and guinea pig, in a concentration-dependent manner. For a given tissue, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity of cetamolol (measured as a pA2 or pKB value) was independent of the agonist used. In the dog tissues, cetamolol was more potent at inhibiting responses in the coronary artery (beta 1-adrenoceptors) than in the saphenous vein (beta 2-adrenoceptors). In the guinea pig tissues, the potency of cetamolol was approximately the same in the trachea (mixed beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors) and atria (predominately beta 1-adrenoceptors), but lower in the soleus muscle (beta 2-adrenoceptors). Studies with the S-(-) and R-(+) enantiomers of cetamolol demonstrated that the S-(-) enantiomer was approximately 100-fold more potent at beta 1-adrenoceptors than the R-(+) enantiomer. In rat brain, cetamolol displaced [3H]-dihydroalprenolol bound to homogenates of cortex (beta 1-adrenoceptor binding sites) and cerebellum (beta 2-adrenoceptor binding sites). The potency of cetamolol at beta 1-adrenoceptors was found to be similar to that of betaxolol but greater than that of atenolol. However, the magnitude of the beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity displayed by atenolol and betaxolol was greater than that displayed by cetamolol. In contrast, ICI-118,551 was found to possess potent and selective affinity for beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "71": "Glucocorticoids and thyroid hormones regulate the expression of G-protein-linked receptors, typified by the beta-adrenergic receptor. The influence of glucocorticoids on the steady-state levels of receptor and receptor mRNA were examined in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in culture. Incubation of wild-type CHO cells with dexamethasone, a potent glucocorticoid, elevated both receptor number (as measured by radioligand binding) and receptor mRNA levels (as measured by DNA-excess solution hybridization). Both responses were time- and dose-dependent. Stable transfectant CHO clones harboring the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor cDNA under the control of the SV40 early promoter were investigated for their ability to respond to glucocorticoid stimulation. The cDNA employed in these studies displays glucocorticoid-response elements (GREs) in the coding and 3'-noncoding regions, but lacks GREs identified in the 5'-noncoding regions of the gene. Transfectant clones expressing 200 (X13), 600 (32E), or 1580 (32A) fmol of receptor/10(6) cells, as compared to wild-type CHO clones expressing 15 fmol/10(6) cells, displayed elevated steady-state levels of receptor mRNA. Incubating the transfectant CHO clones with glucocorticoids, however, failed to enhance the level of receptor or receptor mRNA derived from the expression vector employed in the transfection. These data demonstrate for wild-type CHO cells that glucocorticoids stimulate an increase in receptor mRNA and receptor expression, but that in CHO clones stably transfected with a cDNA lacking specifically the GREs in the 5'-noncoding region of the gene, the glucocorticoid-stimulated increase in beta-adrenergic receptor mRNA is not evident.", 
    "72": "Release of [14C]glucosamine-labelled mucins was studied in vitro using well-characterised preparations of rat submandibular acini. Mucin release was stimulated by forskolin, an activator of the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Both stimulated in a dose-dependent manner to the same maximum as that seen with isoproterenol. Neither forskolin nor IBMX added in the presence of isoproterenol increased secretion above the maximum in response to isoproterenol alone, suggesting a similar mechanism of action, mediated by cyclic AMP. Prior exposure of acini to isoproterenol (10 microM) for 45 min, followed by washout resulted in (a) persistent increase in basal secretion which was abolished by propranolol and (b) reduced stimulation of mucin secretion in response to either a second isoproterenol challenge, noradrenaline or forskolin. Thus, exposure of rat submandibular acini in vitro desensitizes the cells to subsequent stimulation. Although this mimics the decreased beta-adrenergic secretory responses seen in submandibular cells from cystic fibrosis patients, results suggest that the isoproterenol-induced desensitization is at the level of beta-receptor and adenylate cyclase, rather than distal to cyclic AMP.", 
    "73": "A sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of labetalol has been developed. A mobile phase consisting of citrate buffer (pH 6.5), acetonitrile and 2-propanol and an RP-8 column were used. The sensitivity of the fluorescence detection was enhanced to 1 ng/ml of labetalol in plasma by optimizing the emitted light. General guidelines for optimization of fluorescence detection are discussed.", 
    "74": "The common genetic deficiency of drug oxidation known as debrisoquine/sparteine-type polymorphism was investigated with bufuralol as prototype substrate. In human liver microsomes the 1'-hydroxylation of bufuralol is catalyzed by two functionally distinct P-450 isozymes, the high-affinity/highly stereoselective P450bufI and the low-affinity/nonstereoselective P450bufII. We demonstrate that P450bufI is unique in hydroxylating bufuralol in a cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH) mediated reaction whereas P450bufII is active only in the classical NADPH- and O2-supported monooxygenation. In microsomes of liver biopsies of in vivo phenotyped poor metabolizers of debrisoquine or sparteine, the CuOOH-mediated activity was drastically reduced. Rabbit antibodies against a rat P-450 isozyme with high bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity (P450db1) precipitated exclusively P450bufI-type activity from solubilized microsomes. Western blotting of microsomes with these antibodies revealed a close correlation between the immunoreactive protein and CuOOH-mediated (+)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation. No immunoreactive protein was detected in liver microsomes of in vivo phenotyped poor metabolizers. These data provide evidence for a specific deficiency of P450bufI and are consistent with the complete or almost complete absence of this protein in the liver of poor metabolizers.", 
    "75": "The possible involvement of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) relaxation of the cat gastric fundus was studied in circular and longitudinal muscle strips. Cumulative transmural stimulation induced a frequency-dependent relaxation, while cumulative administration of VIP induced a concentration-dependent relaxation. Tetrodotoxin almost completely antagonized the relaxation induced by transmural stimulation (1 Hz), but did not influence the relaxation induced by VIP (10(-7) M); the latter was not influenced by hexamethonium or propranolol plus phentolamine. Trypsin (30 min incubation) and VIP antiserum (1 h incubation) prevented the relaxation induced by VIP and reduced that induced by transmural stimulation, but did not influence the relaxation induced by isopropylnoradrenaline. Two putative VIP receptor antagonists, [AcTyr1]hGRF-(1-40)OH and [4Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP, did not influence the relaxation induced by VIP or transmural stimulation. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that VIP is involved in the NANC relaxation of the cat gastric fundus, although participation of a non-VIP component cannot be excluded.", 
    "76": "The effects of intravenous infusion with phenylephrine on pressor responses to bolus doses of phenylephrine were examined in conscious rabbits. Four hours infusions failed to attenuate responses except in animals pretreated with phenoxybenzamine to eliminate the alpha 1-adrenoceptor reserve. However, the doses of phenylephrine required to attenuate responses were very large and were not well tolerated. Thus alpha 1-adrenoceptors in rabbit vascular smooth muscles are relatively resistant to in vivo agonist desensitisation compared to alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "77": "We analyzed the costs and effectiveness of routine therapy with beta-adrenergic antagonists in patients who survived an acute myocardial infarction. On the basis of data pooled from the literature, this form of therapy resulted in a 25 percent relative reduction annually in the mortality rate for years 1 to 3 and a 7 percent relative reduction for years 4 to 6 after a myocardial infarction. The estimated cost of six years of routine beta-adrenergic-antagonist therapy to save an additional year of life was $23,400 in low-risk patients, $5,900 in medium-risk patients, and $3,600 in high-risk patients, assuming that the entire benefit of earlier treatment is lost immediately after six years. Under a more likely assumption--that the benefit of six years of treatment wears off gradually over the subsequent nine years--the estimated cost of therapy per year of life saved would be $13,000 in low-risk patients, $3,600 in medium-risk patients, and $2,400 in high-risk patients. As compared with coronary-artery bypass grafting and the medical treatment of hypertension, routine beta-adrenergic-antagonist therapy has a relatively favorable cost-effectiveness ratio.", 
    "78": "The effect of ionophoretically applied serotonin (5-HT) was tested on cutaneous sensory responses of multireceptive dorsal horn neurones in the anaesthetized rat. Three types of 5-HT action were discerned: selective inhibition of nociceptive responses (10/18 cells), non-selective inhibition of responses to both noxious and innocuous stimuli as well as to excitatory amino acids (4/18 cells) and non-selective excitation of evoked responses (1/18 cells). A few cells (3/18) were unaffected by 5-HT. The use of agonists, shown to discriminate between subtypes of 5-HT1 receptor revealed that a 5-HT1A receptor agonist mimicked the non-selective effects of 5-HT, whereas a 5-HT1B receptor agonist mimicked the selective antinociceptive effects of 5-HT. A 5-HT2 receptor agonist, in contrast, was without effect. Both the selective and the non-selective effects were reversed by a 5-HT1 receptor antagonist, but not a 5-HT2 antagonist."
