Because EPI exerts predominantly beta-adrenergic, and NE predominantly alpha-adrenergic effects in circulating concentrations, we hypothesized that these changes could lead to uterine arteriole vasoconstriction.", 
    "1": "Uterine microvessels (73-120 microm internal diameter, n = 18) were harvested from near-term pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats, isolated and studied in a pressurized no-flow state with video microscopy. Drugs were applied extraluminally to the superfusion reservoir and the steady-state vessel diameter recorded. Dose-response curves were constructed for NE with and without the addition of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist prazosin, EPI (after 20%-30% preconstruction with the thromboxane analog U46619) with and without the addition of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, and NE in the presence of 10(-8) M EPI. Washout experiments modeled the changes in circulating maternal catecholamines observed during onset of analgesia: 10(-8) M EPI and 10(-6.5) M of NE (the EC50) were added simultaneously, then washed with NE only, and then with the beta2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline and NE. The washout protocol was repeated in the presence of propranolol.", 
    "2": "NE caused dose-dependent vasoconstriction (P < 0.0001), which was blocked by prazosin (P < 0.0001). EPI, added to U46619-preconstricted microvessels, caused vasodilation at lower concentrations and vasoconstriction at higher doses (P < 0.0001). Propranolol converted this response to monophasic dose-dependent vasoconstriction (P < 0.0001). Pretreatment of nonprecontracted vessels with EPI, 10(-8) M, significantly attenuated NE-induced vasoconstriction (P < 0.0001). In washout experiments, removal of EPI with continued presence of NE resulted in vasoconstriction that was reversed by terbutaline. Propranolol blocked the effect of both EPI and terbutaline.", 
    "3": "The results demonstrate that EPI, in concentrations found in the plasma of laboring women, vasodilates uterine resistance vessels and attenuates NE-induced vasoconstriction. This observation may have implications for changes in uterine blood flow that may accompany the onset of labor analgesia in human parturients, as effective analgesia is accompanied by an acute decrease in circulating EPI levels.", 
    "4": "In liver cirrhosis, variceal bleeding is the last in a chain of events initiated by the increase in portal pressure (estimated in clinical practice by the hepatic venous pressure gradient). When hepatic venous pressure gradient goes above 10 mmHg the patient is at risk of developing varices, and when hepatic venous pressure gradient reaches 12 mmHg variceal bleeding might develop. Currently, there is not any effective therapy for the prevention of the development of varices. When varices are small, beta-adrenergic blockers might prevent the enlargement of the varices, and may reduce the risk of variceal bleeding. In patients with medium to large varices, beta-blockers are clearly effective in reducing the risk of variceal bleeding. Endoscopic band ligation might be more effective than beta-blockers, but available evidence is still very weak.", 
    "5": "Adrenoceptors mediate effects of endogenous catecholamines and have been shown to affect the neuronal development. Microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) is an important cytoskeleton protein whose phosphorylation in response to extracellular signal is involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and neuronal plasticity. The present study was designed to determine the effect of activation of adrenoceptor by epinephrine on MAP-2 phosphorylation in differentiation PC12 cells and, if so, to explore the mediating mechanism. We found that epinephrine could significantly increase the phosphorylation of MAP-2c at ser136 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in differentiated PC12 cells as well as microtubule arrays. Differentiated PC12 cells express alpha 2A-adrenoceptor, whose antagonists could block these mentioned effects of epinephrine, and clonidine which is the agonist of alpha 2-adrenoceptor could mimic the effect of epinephrine. Moreover phosphorylation of ERK and PKC was induced by epinephrine, and ERK and PKC specific inhibitors concentration-dependently prevented epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of MAP-2c at ser136. In addition, pretreatment of PC12 cells with epinephrine partly inhibited 30 microM nocodazole induced neurites retraction. These findings suggest that epinephrine induces phosphorylation of MAP-2c at ser136 through a alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated, ERK/PKC-dependent signaling pathway, which may contribute to the stabilization of neurites.",

IOPs at 9 AM were taken at screening, baseline, and weeks 2, 6, and 12. A descriptive study with mean change from baseline IOP, the primary efficacy parameter.", 
    "8": "Seventy-eight evaluable patients (32 brinzolamide and 46 levobetaxolol). Patients on no prestudy IOP-lowering therapy randomized to brinzolamide had mean IOP change from baseline ranging from -4.1 mm Hg (week 2) to -5.0 mm Hg (week 6). When all brinzolamide patients are considered, there was little mean change from baseline IOP due to the large number of patients enrolled without a washout of prior IOP-lowering therapy. Levobetaxolol patients had mean change from baseline, ranging from -1.8 mm Hg (week 6) to -2.9 mm Hg (week 2). Levobetaxolol patients on no prestudy therapy had mean IOP change from baseline ranging from -2.9 mm Hg (week 12) to -4.0 mm Hg (week 2). Brinzolamide was more efficacious for glaucoma associated with systemic or ocular abnormalities and less efficacious for primary congenital glaucoma. Levobetaxolol was most efficacious for primary congenital glaucoma. Adverse events were predominantly nonserious and did not interrupt patient continuation in the study.",

    "10": "We developed extended wear silicone hydrogel soft contact lenses that deliver ophthalmic drugs for an extended period of time ranging from weeks to months. Silicone hydrogels comprising of N,N-dimethylacrylamide, 3-methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane, bis-alpha,omega-(methacryloxypropyl) polydimethylsiloxane, 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate were prepared with varying ratios of monomers and transport of three different ophthalmic drugs, timolol, dexamethasone, and dexamethasone 21-acetate was explored. All the silicone hydrogels of 0.1 mm thickness exhibit diffusion limited transport and extended release varying 20 days up to more than three months depending on the compositions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic components of silicone hydrogels. Also, there are multiple time scales in transport of at least certain molecules, which is perhaps due to the complex microstructure of these gels. The mechanical and physical properties of lenses such as ion permeability, equilibrium water content, transparency, and surface contact angles of some of the gels are suitable for contact lens application.", 
    "11": "The aim of this paper was to describe a case of massive atenol and nifedipine poisoning, complicated by the co-existence of liver cirrhosis, where standard therapies (fluid replacement, vasopressors and inotropic agents, insulin, glucagon, calcium and bowel decontamination) were ineffective in restoring an adequate heart rate, blood pressure, renal and intestinal blood flow. This led to consequent anuric renal insufficiency and incipient multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS). The patient recovered completely after Continuous Veno-Venous Hemo-Dia-Filtration (CVVHDF); this treatment removed atenolol from blood, with predicted clearance levels. The patient was a 45-year old female with a history of hypertension, liver cirrhosis, neurological and psychiatric disorders, with a massive atenolol (69.6 microg/mL) and nifedipine (63 ng/mL) overdose. CVVHDF at an ultrafiltration rate of 1 500 mL/h was started on day 1. From day 2 onwards, as the plasma atenolol concentration decreased, the blood pressure rose at a slow but constant rate. On day 5, there was restoration of an adequate blood pressure, which restored both renal and intestinal function, and also improved MOFS. The standard therapeutic approach was ineffective at eliminating both substances from the blood, and the clinical picture became worse due to incipient MOFS. CVVHDF was used in order to maintain the fluid and electrolyte balance and also to clear the beta blocker from the blood. The clearance kinetics of atenolol were consistent with the expected clearance values, on the basis of a CVVHDF ultrafiltration flow of 1 500 mL/h, which corresponds to a creatinine clearance of about 25 mL/min.", 
    "12": "Biological aging is an independent risk factor for many cardiovascular diseases; some are treated with beta-blockers that may protect dysfunctional endothelium during aging by increasing NO, decreasing ONOO, and restoring NO/ONOO balance. A nanotechnological approach was used to simultaneously monitor NO and ONOO produced by a single aortic endothelial cell from Wistar-Kyoto rats of different ages. beta-blockers (metoprolol and atenolol) were administered 2 weeks before the animals were sacrificed. Nanosensors were placed near the endothelium, and calcium ionophore- stimulated NO and ONOO release was measured. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) undergoes uncoupling with aging, manifested by a decrease in NO (from 503 +/- 12 to 163 +/- 5 nmol/L) and a 3-fold increase in ONOO for 16-week-old and 110- week- old rats, respectively. Metoprolol reversed eNOS uncoupling, increased the production rate and concentration of NO, and increased an overall ratio of NO]/ONOO]. This effect was not observed with atenolol, but L-arginine, sepiapterin, and superoxide dismutase were beneficial.", 
    "13": "This aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of endothelial dysfunction in patients with primary hypertension and to determine the usefulness of nebivolol, a selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, as a potential treatment for endothelial dysfunction. Of 176 patients with stage I hypertension, 36 patients (20%), the majority of whom were overweight/obese, were found to have abnormal results with myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (MP-SPECT) under cold pressor test conditions. These 36 patients were treated for 28 days with 5 mg/d nebivolol, after which only 3 (8.3%) still had abnormal MP-SPECT results. The mean ischemia score was consistent with moderate risk and decreased significantly after treatment with nebivolol. All hemodynamic variables measured (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate) were also reduced significantly by treatment with nebivolol. Endothelial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its reversal has considerable implications for clinical outcomes in affected patients. The cold pressor testing results of this study suggest that nebivolol may have beneficial anti-ischemic effects in the coronary arteries of patients with hypertension. However, these findings need to be confirmed in larger randomized controlled trials, ideally comparing nebivolol with other blood pressure lowering agents or NO synthase inhibitors.", 
    "14": "Dopamine is reported to be a coronary vasodilator; however, the exact mechanism of dopamine action in the coronary circulation remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that dopamine-induced activation of coronary ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels may be associated with coronary vasodilation. We therefore investigated the direct effects of dopamine on coronary KATP-channel activity.", 
    "15": "We used patch-clamp configurations to investigate the effects of dopamine on coronary KATP-channel activity.", 
    "16": "Application of dopamine (10 to 10 M) to the bath solution during cell-attached recordings induced a concentration-dependent increase in KATP-channel activity. In contrast, dopamine failed to activate KATP channels in inside-out patches. Dopamine-induced coronary KATP-channel currents in cell-attached patches were inhibited by pretreatment with the selective D1-like antagonist, Sch-23390, but they were not influenced by the selective D2-like antagonist, domperidone, or the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol. The selective D1-like agonist, SKF-38393, and the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, mimicked the dopamine effects on coronary KATP channels. Furthermore, pretreatment with an inhibitor of protein kinase A, Rp-cAMPS, abolished the dopamine-induced KATP-channel activation.",

    "18": "Eugenosedin-B is able to block serotonin (5-HT) and alpha/beta receptors and to inhibit platelet aggregation. In Wistar rats, intravenous injections of eugenosedin-B (2.4, 7.2, 12 micromoL/kg) caused a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. In contrast, intracisternal injection of eugenosedin-B (0.3, 0.03 micromoL) and an alpha2-antagonist yohimbine (0.03 micromoL) increased blood pressure and heart rate. Eugenosedin-B and yohimbine prevented hypotension induced by intracisternal injection of an alpha2-agonist clonidine (38 pmol). In in vitro experiments, eugenosedin-B (10, 10, 10 M) competitively antagonized norepinephrine-, clonidine-, and 5-HT (10 to 10 M)-induced vasocontractions in isolated rat aorta. It also competitively antagonized the isoproterenol (10 to 10 M)-induced positive inotropic effects in isolated rat atrium. These findings clearly suggest that eugenosedin-B possesses alpha1, alpha2, beta1, and 5-HT2A receptor blocking activities. In isolated rabbit ear artery sensitized with 16 mM K, eugenosedin-B antagonized 5-nonyloxytryptamine- and 5-HT-induced vasocontractions, indicating it also blocked 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors. In radioligand-binding experiments, eugenosedin-B had significant binding affinities on alpha1, alpha2, beta1, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2A receptors. In human platelets, eugenosedin-B inhibited epinephrine and 5-HT-induced aggregations. It also had competitive binding effects in human platelet with [H]yohimbine (alpha2), [H]ketanserin (5-HT2A). We conclude that hypotensive and vasorelaxant effects of eugenosedin-B can be attributed to its multiple actions on the blockade of 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, alpha1/2 and beta1 receptors, and its ability to reduce platelet aggregation attributed to its blockade of alpha2 and 5-HT2A receptors.", 
    "19": "Dosing equivalency of carvedilol and metoprolol remains a debate. Degree of beta 1-blockade is best assessed by blunting of the exercise-induced heart rate. Accordingly, the authors have investigated dosing equivalency by examining baseline and peak exercise heart rates and norepinephrine levels in subjects with chronic heart failure treated with carvedilol or metoprolol. Thirty-seven subjects treated with carvedilol (32.9 +/- 3.5 mg; n = 23) or metoprolol succinate (XL) (96.4 +/- 15.9 mg; n = 14) referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing were studied prospectively. Carvedilol versus metoprolol XL subjects did not differ with respect to baseline heart rate (73 +/- 2 vs 70 +/- 3 bpm), or baseline plasma norepinephrine levels (597.5 +/- 78.3 vs 602.1 +/- 69.6 pg/mL), P = NS. However, despite similar peak exercise norepinephrine levels (2735.8 +/- 320.1 vs 2403.1 +/- 371.6 pg/mL), heart rate at peak exercise was higher in subjects receiving carvedilol (135 +/- 4 bpm) than those receiving metoprolol XL (117 +/- 6 bpm), P = 0.02. Similar norepinephrine release and more complete beta 1-blockade is observed in well-matched subjects with chronic heart failure treated with a mean daily dose of metoprolol XL 96.4 mg compared with carvedilol 32.9 mg.",

Information requested included physician specialty; experience level; details about patient preparation, including the use, dose, route, and timing of premedication; and acceptable heart rate and rhythm. A total of 142 surveys were analyzed, with comparison of parameters across specialties (radiology, cardiology, or shared) and experience levels.",

All sites administer beta-blockers. Target heart rate was reported as < or = 65 beats per minute (bpm) by 89% of responders. Despite most centers aiming for a heart rate of < or = 65 bpm, the maximum allowable heart rate is > 65 bpm in 80% of centers. Patients with arrhythmia are scanned in at least 25% of sites. Most sites (84%) administer nitroglycerin. Significant differences between specialties were noted for experience levels, timing and route of beta-blocker administration, and for target heart rate. The likelihood of scanning in the setting of arrhythmia and beta-blocker timing correlated with experience levels.", 
    "23": "These 64-MDCT coronary artery data from 2006 reveal consensus for a range of patient preparation parameters. Use of beta-blockers and nitroglycerin is routine, and the target heart rate is usually < or = 65 bpm. However, differences were noted for beta-blocker protocols and acceptable heart rate and rhythm, and some differences in practice are associated with experience level and specialty.", 
    "24": "We have reported therapeutic effectiveness of pharmacological stimulation of beta2 adrenoreceptors (ARs) to attenuate the cardiac remodeling and myocardial infarction (MI) expansion in a rat model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) post-MI. Furthermore, the combination of beta2 AR stimulation with beta1 AR blockade exceeded the therapeutic effectiveness of beta1 AR blockade. However, these studies were relatively short (6 weeks). In this study, in the same experimental model, we compared different effects, including survival benefit, of combined therapy with the beta1 AR blocker, metoprolol, plus the beta2 AR agonist, fenoterol (beta1-beta2+), and either therapy alone (beta1- or beta2+) during the 1-year study. Therapy was started 2 weeks after permanent ligation of the left coronary artery. Cardiac remodeling, MI expansion, and left ventricular function were assessed by serial echocardiography and compared with untreated animals (nT). Sixty-seven percent mortality in nT was reduced to 33% in the beta1-beta2+ (p < 0.01). Progressive cardiac remodeling observed in nT and beta1- was significantly attenuated in beta1-beta2+ during the first 6 months of treatment. In beta1-beta2+, MI expansion was completely prevented, and functional decline was significantly attenuated during the entire year. Myocardial apoptosis was significantly reduced in both beta1-beta2+ and beta1-. A reduction of cardiac beta1 AR density and decreases in chronotropic and contractile responses to beta2 AR-specific stimulation in the absence of a reduction of beta2 AR density in nT were precluded in rats receiving combined therapy. The results demonstrate the cardioprotective and survival benefit of long-term combination therapy of beta2 AR agonists and beta1 AR blockers in a model of DCM.",

Of the 55,000 patients who have been screened through KEEP, approximately 13,000 (29%), or nearly 1 in 3 patients, have been identified as having CKD. Once a patient has been diagnosed with CKD, clinicians must address risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and kidney-specific diseases (e.g., glomerular diseases) that contribute to the process of renal decline. The NKF through the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative has assembled a series of guidelines addressing dialysis adequacy, vascular access, anemia, nutrition, CKD, bone and mineral metabolism, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.",

    "29": "Previous studies suggest that activation of the CNS melanocortin system reduces appetite while increasing sympathetic activity and arterial pressure. The present study tested whether endogenous activity of the CNS melanocortin 3/4 receptors (MC3/4-R) contributes to elevated arterial pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), a model of hypertension with increased sympathetic activity. A cannula was placed in the lateral ventricle of male SHR and Wistar (WKY) rats for chronic intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusions (0.5 muL/h). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded 24 hour/d using telemetry. After 5-day control period, rats were infused with MC3/4-R antagonist (SHU-9119, 1 nmol/h-ICV) for 12 days, followed by 5-day posttreatment period. MC3/4-R antagonism increased food intake in SHR by 90% and in WKY by 125%, resulting in marked weight gain, insulin resistance, and hyperleptinemia in SHR and WKY. Despite weight gain, MC3/4-R antagonism reduced HR in SHR and WKY ( approximately 40 bpm), while lowering MAP to a greater extent in SHR (-22+/-4 mm Hg) than WKY (-4+/-3 mm Hg). SHU9119 treatment failed to cause further reductions in MAP during chronic adrenergic blockade with propranolol and terazosin. These results suggest that endogenous activity of the CNS melanocortin system contributes to the maintenance of adrenergic tone and elevated arterial pressure in SHR even though mRNA levels for POMC and MC4R in the mediobasal hypothalamus were not increased compared to WKY. These results also support the hypothesis that weight gain does not raise arterial pressure in the absence of a functional MC3/4-R.",

The aim of this study was to determine and compare epithelial tightness and permeability of currently available corneal cell culture models to avoid interlaboratory variability and to assess their usefulness for in-vitro permeation studies. Pure epithelial cell culture models (CEPI, SIRC and HCE-T cell lines), primary cultures of human corneal epithelium (HCEpiC) and the two commercially available models (RHC and Epiocular), as well as organotypic human cornea constructs (HCC, HCC-HCE-T), were investigated and data were compared with those obtained from the excised bovine cornea. Barrier properties were assessed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability of three passively absorbed substances (mannitol, testosterone and timolol maleate) with different physico-chemical properties. TEER experiments revealed weak barrier functions for all of the investigated epithelial models (<or=100-200 Omega cm2), except the HCE-T cell line. Transport studies confirmed TEER results insofar that models showing low TEER values also had higher permeation rates in comparison with the excised bovine cornea. However, models based on HCE-T cells demonstrated similar barrier properties to isolated corneal tissue. The corneal models investigated in our laboratory show clear differences in epithelial barrier function. In-vitro systems comprising the HCE-T cell line seem to be most appropriate to replace excised animal cornea for assessing corneal permeability.",

    "32": "Glaucoma and ocular hypertension are highly prevalent conditions in individuals over the age of 40 and are commonly seen together in patients with cardiovascular disease. Many of the antiglaucoma medications, when systemically absorbed, affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems of patients and can cause cardiovascular toxicity. Such adverse effects are frequently associated with the long-term use of potentially toxic agents in elderly people, who are most prone to chronic eye disease. Moreover, patients may not associate their symptoms with the topical eye medications, and consequently may not report adverse drug effects. Drug-drug interactions can also occur when patients are taking medications for both cardiovascular disease and glaucoma. In this review, the systemic toxicity of these agents is reviewed, along with possible drug-drug interactions. Mention is made of other antiglaucoma medications used alone and in combination with topical beta-blockers. Identification of genetic loci-a bold new step toward glaucoma treatment-is mentioned briefly at the end of the article.",

The specific maximum consumption rate and saturation constant of acetate and propionate degraders were estimated through fitting the model to experimental data taken from continuous and batch experiments.

    "43": "The cardiogenic capacity of embryonic stem (ES) cells has been well-investigated. However, little is known about the development of adrenoceptor (AR) systems during the process of ES cell differentiation, which are critically important in cardiac physiology and pharmacology. In this present study, we investigated the expression profile of adrenoceptor subtypes, beta-adrenergic modulation of muscarinic receptors and adrenoceptor-related signaling in cardiomyocytes derived from ES cells (ESCMs). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that undifferentiated mouse ES cells expressed alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, alpha(1D)- and beta(2)-AR mRNA. However, beta(1)-AR was only expressed after vitamin C induction. The expressions of alpha(1A)-, alpha(1D)- and beta(1)-ARs increased significantly while alpha(1B)- and beta(2)-ARs showed no significant change during the differentiation process. Furthermore, we detected the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. Both alpha(1)-AR and beta-AR could activate extracellular responsive kinase in ESCMs. Isoprenaline could inhibit the expression of M(2) muscarinic receptor protein. CGP20712A, a beta(1)-AR antagonist, up-regulated the expression of M(2) muscarinic receptor while ICI118551, a beta(2)-AR antagonist, showed no effect. These results indicated that functional adrenoceptors and tyrosine hydroxylase, a critical enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, were differentially expressed in ESCMs. Adrenoceptor-related signaling pathways and beta-adrenergic modulation of muscarinic receptors were established during differentiation.",

    "45": "Many patients affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) die before reaching endstage renal disease because of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent guidelines and position statements have therefore defined CKD as a cardiovascular risk equivalent, and patients in all stages of CKD are considered in the highest risk group for development of CVD. Heart failure (HF) is the main cardiovascular complication that occurs in renal patients and its incidence increases proportionally with the reduction of glomerular filtration rate. In fact, pressure and volume overload, that are inherent to the abnormalities of homeostasis typical of CKD, lead to concentric/eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Initially, LVH is adaptative because energy is spared by maintaining stable wall stress. However, in the long term, LVH becomes maladaptative, inducing systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction that, in turn, lead to symptomatic left ventricular failure. Nowadays, it is well established that several classes of drugs, including reninangiotensin system antagonists, beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists, improve survival in patients with HF. In fact, all major guidelines on HF recommend such drugs as standard therapy. The problem for nephrologists is that the general approach and recommendations for the management of HF in the general population may not be completely safe in renal patients with HF. This review is conducted with the purpose to provide more information on the efficacy and safety of HF therapy in renal patients.",

Anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane and fentanyl under intraaortic balloon pump support. When patient's heartbeat exceeded a pacemaker rate, blood pressure decreased to below 60 mmHg. We tried to perform CRT by adjusting its program above his heart rate, and then blood pressure returned to normal levels. After coronary arterial bypass had been established, it was difficult to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) because his own heart rate was over 100 beats min(-1). For the purpose of controlling the heart rate, we administered landiolol intravenously. After injecting a total of 2.5 mg of landiolol, his heart rate was reduced and subsequently CRT started to work, which induced a stable hemodynamic condition enough to wean from CPB. According to our clinical experience, it is important to perform a rapid treatment against tachycardia in a patient with CRT Thus, landiolol is useful for such a rapid treatment against tachycardia with maintaining the hemodynamics.",

    "55": "The importance of central beta-adrenergic system has been essentially investigated in aversive/emotional learning tasks. However, recent data suggest that the beta-adrenergic system is also required for incidental taste learning. In the present study we evaluated in rats whether beta-adrenergic receptor activity is required for taste habituation, an incidental taste learning, and also for conditioned taste aversion (CTA) learning, an associative learning. To address this issue, a low dose of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol was infused before learning in either the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or the insular cortex (IC), two forebrain areas reported to play a key role in taste memory formation. Incidental taste learning was assessed using a single presentation of the sweet taste saccharin 0.1%, which is sufficient to increase saccharin consumption (relative to water baseline) during a second presentation. CTA was assessed by pairing the first saccharin 0.1% presentation with a delayed gastric malaise, thus causing a decrease in saccharin consumption (relative to water baseline) during a second presentation. Propranolol infusion in BLA (1microg/0.2microl) or IC (2.5microg/0.5microl) before the first taste exposure impaired incidental taste learning but did not affect CTA. These results highlight the important role played by the beta-adrenergic receptor activation in cortical and amygdaloid structures during taste learning. Moreover, they are the first to suggest that incidental learning is more sensitive to blockade of noradrenergic system than associative learning.",

The PREHACOR study recruited 3193 hypertensive patients, aged 74 +/- 6 years, 67% male, with CHD. Regular exercise assessed by questionnaire was defined as recreational activity >20 min/day, >3 times/week. Endpoints at 6 months were new cardiovascular events (NCEs: myocardial infarction and hospitalization for stroke, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or coronary revascularization). New cardiovascular events occurred in 376 patients (11.8%), with 17 deaths (0.5%). New cardiovascular events patients were older, with higher body mass index, and were more likely to have diabetes, arrhythmia, history of congestive heart failure, and noncardiac organ damage than non-NCE patients. Blood pressure was significantly and similarly reduced in both groups. Multivariate logistic regression associated NCEs positively and independently with a history of congestive heart failure (odds ratio [OR] 2.50; confidence interval [CI] = 1.9-3.23), noncardiac target organ damage (OR 1.51; CI = 1.20-1.90), and beta-blocker use (OR 1.28; CI = 1.02-1.59), and inversely and independently with combination low-dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor + diuretic therapy (OR 0.66; CI = 0.45-0.95) and regular exercise (OR 0.70; CI = 0.54-0.90).

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm of the proximal descending thoracic aorta. Due to the typical location (aortic isthmus), the pseudoaneurysm was thought to be the result of deceleration injury sustained by the patient in the previous motor vehicle accident.

As a model of the neurodegenerative action of Abeta, we have previously shown that acutely applied Abeta inhibits the induction of LTP in the hippocampus in vitro. In the present studies, we have studied the effect of beta-adrenoceptor activation on the Abeta inhibition of LTP. Pharmacological activation of beta2 adrenoceptors, but not of beta1 adrenoceptors, was found to prevent the Abeta evoked inhibition of LTP in the dentate gyrus of adult animals. The prevention of the effect of Abeta was shown to occur via the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway as the adenylate cyclase-stimulating agent forskolin prevented the Abeta inhibition of LTP, an action prevented by the PKA inhibitor, Rp-8-Br-cAMPs. We suggest microglia as a likely site of action of the neuroprotective effect of beta2 adrenoceptor activation. Therapeutic treatment for AD may include agents that activate beta2 receptors and elevate cAMP.", 
    "67": "Adaptive changes in serotonergic 5HT1 receptor signalling are believed to underlie the therapeutic effectiveness of antidepressant drugs. Since cells are continuously exposed to neurotransmitters/neuromodulators, spatially and temporally integrated, the responsiveness of a receptor system is dependent upon the physio-pathological state of the cell and the interaction between different neurotransmitters. In the present work, we investigated heterologous regulation of 5HT1 receptors induced by norepinephrine (NE) in human platelets. NE platelet treatment induced a time and concentration dependent 5HT1 receptor desensitisation mediated by both alpha and beta receptors through activation of intracellular protein kinases. In particular NE, through PKC activation, regulated 5HT1 receptor phosphorylation on threonine residues, causing in turn serotonin receptor-G protein uncoupling and functional responsiveness drop. These results suggest that high NE levels (released i.e. during stress disorders) may play an important role in regulating the 5HT1 responsiveness and in controlling effectiveness of drugs acting on these neurotransmitter systems.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the proteins with differential protein expression levels in the proteome of vascular smooth muscle cells (A7r5) incubated separately with individual enantiomers of atenolol using an iTRAQ-coupled two-dimensional LC-MS/MS approach. Our results indicated that some calcium-binding proteins such as calmodulin, protein S100-A11, protein S100-A4, and annexin A6 were down-regulated and showed relatively lower protein levels in cells incubated with the S-enantiomer of atenolol than those incubated with the R-enantiomer, whereas metabolic enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase, glutathione S-transferase P, NADH-cytochrome b(5) reductase, and alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase precursor were up-regulated and displayed higher protein levels in cells incubated with the S-enantiomer relative to those incubated with the R-enantiomer. The involvement of NADH-cytochrome b(5) reductase in the intracellular anabolic activity was validated by NAD+/NADH assay with a higher ratio of NAD+/NADH correlating with a higher proportion of NAD+. The down-regulation of the calcium-binding proteins was possibly involved in the lower intracellular Ca2+ concentration in A7r5 cells incubated with the S-enantiomer of atenolol. Ca2+ signals transduced by calcium-binding proteins acted on cytoskeletal proteins such as nestin and beta-tropomyosin, which can play a complex role in phenotypic modulation and regulation of the cytoskeletal modeling. Our preliminary results thus provide molecular evidence on the metabolic effect and possible link of calcium-binding proteins with treatment of hypertension associated with atenolol.",

Despite the clear evidence of beta blockers (BBs) effectiveness, there is a general reluctance to use them in patients with COPD due to a perceived contraindication and fear of inducing adverse reactions and bronchspasm. BBs are well tolerated in patients with cardiac disease and concomitant COPD with no evidence of worsening of respiratory symptoms or FEV1, and the safety of BBs in patients with COPD has been demonstrated, but their use in this group of patients remains low. The cumulative evidence from trials and meta-analysis indicates that cardioselective BBs should not be withheld in patients with reactive airway disease or COPD. Patients with COPD have a high incidence of cardiac events necessitating careful consideration of prophylactic treatment. The benefits of beta blockade in this group appear to outweigh any potential risk of side effects according to the available evidence. In this article, we will discuss the use of BBs in patients with COPD and review the evidence for their use and safety in this group of patients.",

    "92": "A reliable basal heart rate (HR) measurement in freely moving newborn mice was accomplished for the first time by using a novel noninvasive piezoelectric transducer (PZT) sensor. The basal HR was approximately 320 beats/min at postnatal day (P)0 and increased with age to approximately 690 beats/min at P14. Contribution of autonomic control to HR was then assessed. Sympathetic blockade with metoprolol significantly reduced basal HR at both P6 (-236 +/- 23 beats/min; mean +/- SE) and P12 (-105 +/- 8 beats/min), but atropine was without effect, indicating the predominant tonic adrenergic stimulation and absence of vagal control for basal HR in newborn mice. In contrast to stable basal HR during 5-min recording, HR measured by ECG (ECG-HR) was markedly decreased because of the restraint stress of attaching ECG electrodes, with accompanying freezing behavior. ECG-HR lowered and further decreased gradually during 5 min (slow cardiodeceleration) at P0-P3 and rapidly decreased and gradually recovered within 5 min (transient bradycardia) at P9-P14. The response was not uniform in P4-P8 mice: they showed either of these two patterns or sustained bradycardia (9-29%), and the number of mice that showed transient bradycardia increased with age (30-100%) during the period. Studies with autonomic blockade suggest that the slow cardiodeceleration and transient bradycardia are mediated mainly by withdrawal of adrenergic stimulation and phasic vagal activation, respectively, and the autonomic control of HR response to restraint stress is likely to change from the withdrawal of adrenergic stimulation to the phasic vagal activation at different stages during P4-P8 in individual mice. The PZT sensor may offer excellent opportunities to monitor basal HR of small animals noninvasively.", 
    "93": "We recently documented sex differences in the susceptibility to reperfusion-induced sustained ventricular tachycardia and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in conscious rats. However, the effect of sex on ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is under-investigated. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that gonadal hormones influence the ventricular arrhythmia threshold (VAT) induced by coronary artery occlusion as well as the response to beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. The VAT was defined as the time from coronary occlusion to sustained ventricular tachycardia resulting in a reduction in arterial pressure. Male and female intact and gonadectomized (GnX) rats were instrumented with a radiotelemetry device for recording arterial pressure, temperature, and ECG, as well as a Doppler ultrasonic flow probe to measure cardiac output and a snare around the left main coronary artery. The VAT was determined in conscious rats by pulling on the snare. The VAT was significantly longer in intact females (5.56 +/- 0.19) vs. intact males (4.31 +/- 0.14 min). This sex difference was abolished by GnX. Specifically, GnX decreased the VAT in females (4.55 +/- 0.22) and increased the VAT in males (5.14 +/- 0.30 min). Thus male sex hormones increase and female sex hormones decrease the susceptibility to ischemia-induced sustained ventricular tachycardia. beta-Adrenergic receptor blockade increased the VAT in intact males and GnX females only. Thus gonadal hormones influence the response to beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Uncovering major differences between males and females in the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system may result in sex-specific optimization of patient treatments.", 
    "94": "Labetalol, a combined alpha1, beta1, and beta2 adrenoceptor-blocking drug, has been shown to have analgesic properties in vivo. To determine the underlying mechanisms, we examined its effects on GABAA receptor-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and spontaneous firings of rat ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) neurons, either mechanically dissociated, or in acute brain slices. These PAG neurons mediate opioid-mediated analgesia and pain transmission and are under tonic control of GABAergic interneurons. An increase in GABAergic transmission to these neurons yields an inhibitory hyperpolarized state and may interrupt pain signal transmission. Using patch clamp techniques, we found that labetalol reversibly increases the frequency of sIPSCs without changing their mean amplitude. This indicates that labetalol enhances GABAergic synaptic transmission by a presynaptic mechanism. Metoprolol, a specific beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist, also reversibly enhanced sIPSC frequency. In the presence of metoprolol, labetalol-induced increase in sIPSC frequency was significantly attenuated or even abolished. These results suggest that labetalol shares the same pathway as metoprolol in enhancing GABAergic transmission via an inhibition of presynaptic beta1-adrenoceptors. We further showed that labetalol reversibly reduced the firing rate of PAG neurons. This reduction was significantly attenuated in the presence of bicuculline, a selective antagonist of GABAA receptors. These data indicate that labetalol-induced inhibition of PAG cell firing is attributable to its potentiation of GABAergic transmission. Based on these data, we postulate that labetalol-induced analgesia is at least in part ascribed to its antagonistic effects on presynaptic beta1-adrenoceptors.",

AC and TL did not change these indexes. Changes of HRV indexes were closely related to changes of HR particularly HR min (r=0.53 - 0.84). Linear regressions of these relations did not differ between three drugs except for low frequency indexes of HRV between AC and TL. According to the equations the differences in HRV indexes between the drugs were well explained by the differences in HR changes. When all patients were evaluated together statistical significance of increase in rMSSD, pNN50 and HFP was not reached until HR average decreased by 10 bpm or more. The effect of TL on HR and HRV is very similar to AC what suggests its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or anticholinergic properties.",

The beta-blocker of the third generation nebivolol is known as a good antihypertensive agent. The aim of our study was to evaluate effects of nebivolol on structural and functional parameters of cardiac remodeling in patients with AH without heart failure. We examined 28 patients with AH aged 49.99 +/- 5.26 years, with average arterial pressure 154.42 +/- 94.37 mm Hg and ejection fraction (EF) > 60%. All of them underwent routine clinical examination and echocardiography (EchoCG) with calculation of additional indexes, and than were given nebivolol 5 mg. After 3 months and 1 year of treatment with nebivolol we assessed antihypertensive effect and the state of cardiac hemodynamics using EchoCG with calculation of remodeling indexes. After 3 months of therapy myocardial stresses (systolic - MSs and diastolic - MSd) were reduced (from 154.28 +/- 11.65 to 132.77 +/- 11.37 U, p < 0.02, and from 184.17 +/- 14.1 to 159.87 +/- 13.34 U, p < 0.02, respectively), and diastolic function improved. After 1 year of antihypertensive treatment LV diastolic function remained normal, while thickness of LV wall decreased (from 0.41 +/- 0.03 to 0.37 +/- 0.02 U, p=0.01). MS continued to decrease with high degree of significance. At the end of the first year we revealed decrease of MSs/ESVI from 9.66 +/- 1.77 at the start of treatment to 6.1 +/- 0.69 (p < 0.005) and MSd/EDVI from 3.21 +/- 0.4 to 2.57 +/- 0.38 (p < 0,005). Increase of EF/MSs (from 0.47 +/- 0.05 to 0.61 +/- 0.07, p < 0.02) was also revealed after 1 year treatment with nebivolol. There were 32% individuals in the studied group, who had concentric type of LV remodeling at the beginning, after 3 months this number decreased to 16%, and at the end of first year no patients had this type of remodeling. Thus, it was shown that nebivolol is able to interfere with the processes of structural and functional rearrangement of the myocardium, preventing development of systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the heart.",

At baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment with carvedilol we carried out 24-hour BP monitoring, single photon emission computer tomography of the brain, and assessed the state of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. According to data of 24-hour BP monitoring marked lowering of BP parameters occurred under the influence of therapy. This was accompanied with 26% decrease of the number of hypoperfused sectors of the brain (chi2=6.04, =0.014). During adenosine test number of hypoperfused sectors decreased from 136 to 117 (chi2=2,10, =0,147) what evidenced for a tendency to improvement of reactivity of cerebral vessels in response to vasodilating influences. The preparation exerted favorable effect on metabolic parameters and lowering of level of postprandial glycemia in dynamics of treatment was statistically significant.",

Treatment with both superselective beta-adrenoblockers was associated with significant lowering of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. Antihypertensive effect of bisoprolol was significantly more pronounced than that of nebivolol. Bisoprolol and nebivolol significantly increased concentration of testosterone (by 82 and 85%, respectively) and prolactin (by 77 and 83%, respectively), lowered levels of estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone, improved vascular blood flow in penile arteries, and did not worsen sexual function.",

This study tests the hypothesis that differences that are especially noted in the early morning period, when cardiovascular risk is highest, in 24-hour blood pressure (BP) control exist between these 2 beta-blockers. This was a small, randomized open-label study with blinded end point evaluation in 36 hypertensive patients. All participants received hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg for 2 weeks before randomization to either 50 mg atenolol or metoprolol succinate given every morning; both treatments were force-titrated to 100 mg/d at 4 weeks. The primary end point was the change in early morning ambulatory systolic BP. Early morning (12 AM-6 AM) systolic BP differences were 3+/-14 mm Hg with atenolol vs -7+/-8 mm Hg with metoprolol succinate (P=.03). The overall 24-hour changes in systolic BP were 1+/-15 mm Hg with atenolol vs -9+/-11 mm Hg with metoprolol (P=.03). In conclusion, metoprolol succinate was more effective in sustaining 24-hour and early morning BP reductions compared with atenolol in a small group of hypertensive patients also treated with once-daily low-dose hydrochlorothiazide. It is possible that differences in outcome between atenolol-based and other therapies may be the result of inadequate dosing of atenolol, a medication that may not be effective for the entire 24-hour period.",

These posthoc analyses from the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study evaluated losartan- versus atenolol-based therapy on the primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction and other end points in 4963 women. Fewer events occurred in women versus men. Women in the losartan group had significant reductions in the primary end point (215 [18.2 per 1000 patient-years] versus 261 [22.5 per 1000 patient-years]; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82 [95% CI: 0.68 to 0.98]; P=0.031), stroke (109 versus 154; HR: 0.71 [95% CI: 0.55 to 0.90]; P=0.005), total mortality (HR: 0.77 [95% CI: 0.63 to 0.95]; P=0.014), and new-onset diabetes (HR: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.59 to 0.94]; P=0.015) versus the atenolol group, with no between-treatment difference for myocardial infarction (HR: 1.02 [95% CI: 0.74 to 1.39]; P=0.925), cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.64 to 1.14]; P=0.282), or hospitalization for heart failure (HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.68 to 1.28]; P=0.677).

Risk reductions for the primary composite end point, stroke, total mortality, and new-onset diabetes were significantly greater with losartan- versus atenolol-based treatment in women with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in the LIFE study. The risk reductions for losartan, along with the tests for the interaction of treatment and gender, indicated that the treatment effect was consistent in men and women for all of the end points tested, with the exception of hospitalization for angina.",

However, less is known about gender differences in this response. Baseline and annual echocardiograms until the end of study or a primary end point occurred were assessed in 863 hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy aged 55 to 80 years (mean: 66 years) during 4.8 years of randomized losartan- or atenolol-based treatment in the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension Echocardiography substudy. Left ventricular hypertrophy was diagnosed as left ventricular mass divided by height(2.7) >or=46.7 g/m(2.7) and 49.2 g/m(2.7) in women and men, respectively, and systolic function as ejection fraction and stress-corrected midwall fractional shortening. Women included more patients with obesity, isolated systolic hypertension, and mitral regurgitation (all P<0.01). Ejection fraction, stress-corrected midwall shortening, and prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy were higher in women at baseline and at the end of study (all P<0.01). In particular, more women had residual eccentric hypertrophy (47% versus 32%; P<0.01) in spite of similar in-treatment reduction in mean blood pressure. In logistic regression, left ventricular hypertrophy at study end was more common in women (odds ratio: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.16 to 2.26; P<0.01) independent of other significant covariates. In linear regression analyses, female gender also predicted 2% higher mean in-treatment ejection fraction and 2% higher mean stress-corrected midwall shortening (both beta=0.07; P<0.01).

    "132": "Tonic activation of adrenergic drive has been found to be associated with aging, and its further activation is also seen in aging patients with major surgery or congestive heart failure. Nevertheless, its potential effect on the aging heart remains enigmatic. In the present study, at baseline, significant inflammatory and apoptotic changes were found in the aging mouse (20 months old), as evidenced by increases in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, myocardial apoptosis in the heart, and C-reactive protein (CRP) release in the circulation. These phenotypic changes in aging animals can be induced in young animals (3 months old) by chronic beta-adrenergic receptor (AR) stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO), and they can be markedly reduced in aging animals by chronic beta-blockade with propranolol. Compared with young animals, chronic beta-AR stimulation with ISO in aging animals induced larger increases in iNOS expression, nitrotyrosine formation in the heart, and nitric oxide (NO) production and CRP release in the circulation; it also accelerated myocardial apoptosis and resulted in an enlarged infarct size when animals were subjected to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (MI/R). However, the pretreatment of 1400W (N-(3-(aminomethyl) benzyl)acetamidine)-a specific iNOS inhibitor-significantly reduced iNOS-mediated nitrative stress associated with a marked decrease in myocardial apoptosis and infarct size in aging mice. These results demonstrate that tonic activation of the beta-adrenergic system associated with aging induces proinflammatory and proapoptotic changes in the heart and that additional beta-AR stimulation results in an exaggerated nitrative stress, mediated by iNOS, that is associated with more severe myocardial injury in aging mice.", 
    "133": "After an MI, elderly persons should have their modifiable coronary artery risk factors--such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes--intensively treated. Aspirin or clopidogrel, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors should be given indefinitely, unless contraindications exist. Long-acting nitrates are effective antianginal and anti-ischemic drugs. There are no Class I indications for the use of calcium channel blockers after MI. Postinfarction patients should not receive Class I antiarrhythmic drugs, sotalol, or amiodarone. Those at very high risk for sudden cardiac death should have an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Hormonal therapy should not be used in postmenopausal women after MI. The indications for coronary revascularization are prolongation of life and relief of unacceptable symptoms despite optimal medical management.", 
    "134": "Lifestyle interventions constitute the initial strategy for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women. However, pharmacotherapy is often indicated for control of major cardiovascular risk factors, and abundant clinical trial data support the morbidity and mortality benefit of a number of categories of drug therapy following a coronary event. Although women have increasingly been enrolled in clinical trials of pharmacotherapy, under representation of women in most research studies limits the gender-specific assessment of outcomes. Equally importantly, recent randomized clinical trial data have highlighted inappropriate preventive therapies for women (i.e. those lacking effectiveness and potentially imparting harm). Decision-making data for drug therapy for women also derive from a number of clinical trials conducted solely in women. The drug classes reviewed in this article include omega-3 fatty acids, aspirin, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists or blockers, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), aldosterone antagonists, antioxidants, folic acid and vitamins B(6) and B(12), and menopausal hormone therapy and selective estrogen-receptor modulators. Information is sparse regarding specific cardiovascular pharmacotherapies for elderly women, and women of racial and ethnic minorities. Owing to the under representation of the subset of women in many trials, analysis by age, race and ethnicity is not appropriate. This information gap presents a major challenge for future studies, as these subgroups constitute populations of women at high cardiovascular risk.", 
    "135": "Approximately 72 million people in the US experience hypertension. Worldwide, hypertension may affect as many as 1 billion people and be responsible for approximately 7.1 million deaths per year. It is estimated that approximately 1% of patients with hypertension will, at some point, develop a hypertensive crisis. Hypertensive crises are further defined as either hypertensive emergencies or urgencies, depending on the degree of blood pressure elevation and presence of end-organ damage. Immediate reduction in blood pressure is required only in patients with acute end-organ damage (i.e. hypertensive emergency) and requires treatment with a titratable, short-acting, intravenous antihypertensive agent, while severe hypertension without acute end-organ damage (i.e. hypertensive urgency) is usually treated with oral antihypertensive agents. The primary goal of intervention in a hypertensive crisis is to safely reduce blood pressure. The appropriate therapeutic approach of each patient will depend on their clinical presentation. Patients with hypertensive emergencies are best treated in an intensive care unit with titratable, intravenous, hypotensive agents. Rapid-acting intravenous antihypertensive agents are available, including labetalol, esmolol, fenoldopam, nicardipine and sodium nitroprusside. Newer agents, such as clevidipine and fenoldopam, may hold considerable advantages to other available agents in the management of hypertensive crises. Sodium nitroprusside is an extremely toxic drug and its use in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies should be avoided. Similarly, nifedipine, nitroglycerin and hydralazine should not to be considered first-line therapies in the management of hypertensive crises because these agents are associated with significant toxicities and/or adverse effects.", 
    "136": "The incidence of and mortality from both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) increase with age. In addition, the average age of patients with COPD and CVD is also increasing as a result of improvements in both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Coronary artery disease is a compelling indication for beta-adrenoceptor antagonist use in a population in whom beta-adrenoceptor antagonism is often viewed as contraindicated. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists have been proven to improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality but have been under-utilized in patients with COPD with concomitant CVD because of a fear of bronchoconstriction and adverse effects, particularly in the elderly. The advanced age of patients with COPD and CVD, along with the sheer number of patients with these diseases, necessitates that clinicians understand the treatment of these co-morbidities using seemingly conflicting therapy in the form of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. We review changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the elderly, the role of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in CVD and the literature regarding the safety and mortality benefits of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in elderly patients with COPD and concomitant CVD. We conclude that cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists appear to be safe to use in elderly male patients with mild-to-moderate COPD who have a compelling indication for beta-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy. Data in female patients are very limited. Nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists should be avoided in general, except in patients with heart failure who might benefit significantly from the use of carvedilol. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists have been shown to improve mortality in older patients with coexisting CVD and COPD.", 
    "137": "Noradrenaline is known to modulate memory formation in the mammalian hippocampus. We have examined how noradrenaline and selective beta-adrenoceptor (AR) agonists affect memory consolidation and how antagonists inhibit memory consolidation in the avian hippocampus. Injection of selective beta-AR agonists and antagonists at specific times within 30 min of a weakly or strongly reinforced, single-trial, bead discrimination learning test in 1-day-old chicks allowed us to determine the pattern of beta-AR involvement in hippocampal memory processing. Different beta-AR subtypes were recruited in temporal sequence after learning in the order beta(1), beta(3), and beta(2.) We provide evidence that the effect of manipulation of beta(1)-ARs by selective agonists and antagonists within 2.5 min of training parallels the action of NMDA receptor agonists and antagonists. Activation of beta(3)- and beta(2)-ARs facilitated memory but utilized different mechanisms: beta(3)-ARs by stimulating glucose uptake and metabolism, and beta(2)-ARs by increasing the breakdown of glycogen--with both metabolic events occurring in astrocytes and affecting intermediate memory. The different receptors are activated at different times within the lifetime of labile memory and within 30 min of learning. We have defined separate roles for the three beta-ARs in memory and demonstrated that the avian hippocampus is involved in learning and memory in much the same way as the hippocampus in the mammalian brain.",

Using needle electrodes, transmural unipolar electrograms were recorded across the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV). Activation-recovery interval (ARI) was measured in each electrogram to estimate local repolarization during RV pacing at the cycle length of 750 ms after the creation of complete atrioventricular block. Before propranolol, epinephrine, 0.5 microg/kg, did not induce VA in any experiment. However, a dose of 1.0 microg/kg induced polymorphic VA following multiple premature ventricular complex (PVC) in four of six experiments. Epinephrine, 0.5 microg/kg, shortened ARI at all sites and lessened LV transmural ARI dispersion. Neither ARI nor its dispersion could be determined after 1.0 microg/kg of epinephrine because of the induction of PVC, polymorphic VA, or both. Propranolol (i) prevented epinephrine-induced PVC and polymorphic VA in all experiments, (ii) slightly prolonged ARI at all sites, along with a decrease in LV transmural ARI dispersion, and (iii) reversed the epinephrine-induced shortening of ARI.", 
    "140": "In this LQT3 model, an increase in adrenergic activity by epinephrine had dose-dependent, opposite effects on ventricular electrical stability. Since beta-adrenergic blockade suppressed epinephrine-induced PVC and polymorphic VA, it might be considered for supplemental therapy to suppress VA in patients presenting with LQT3.",

This effect was mimicked with the use of cAMP-raising agents isobutylmethylxanthine and forskolin and required activation of the protein kinase A. Inhibition of the JNK pathway by ex-4 or IBMX and forskolin was concomitant with a rise in the levels of islet-brain 1 (IB1), a potent blocker of the stress-induced JNK pathway.

Data were extracted for adults newly identified with hypertension between 1995 and 2003. Drug utilization was measured as a time-dependent variable; thus, the use of combination therapies was captured for any given day for each patient in the sample.

Over 40% (41.6%) of these episodes involved one medication only, but patients frequently used dual (26.9%) and three or more (15.9%) therapies in combination. The frequency of prescribed antihypertensive therapies, as well as the length of, and adherence to, these therapies were described. Descriptively, medication adherence appeared to be lower among patients who received therapy for longer duration, indicating higher probability of missed doses and more frequent therapy changes.",

    "160": "Approximately 50% of the mortality in chronic dialysis patients is due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and arrhythmia are all common conditions and predispose to sudden death, which accounts for 60% of all cardiac deaths in this population. Despite advances in dialysis therapy, the mortality from CVD remains substantially unchanged, partly due to the lack of evidence-based strategies for improving the outcome of cardiac diseases in this population. Activation of the sympathetic adrenergic system is well documented in chronic dialysis patients and is likely involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial hypertrophy, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmia. Given the proven benefit of beta-blockers in patients with normal kidney function with similar cardiac comorbidities, beta-blockers would seem to be attractive agents to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the patient population with advanced chronic kidney disease. However, the value of beta-blockade in patients on chronic dialysis remains unclear. This uncertainty surrounding the efficacy is compounded by the risk of side effects to these patients, such as hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia. In addition, numerous studies have suggested suboptimal usage of beta-blockers in the dialysis population; this is seen even in high risk patients, such as those with established coronary artery disease. In this review, we will focus on sympathetic nervous system activation in kidney disease and highlight the benefit and risks of beta-blockers usage in the chronic dialysis patient population.", 
    "161": "The present investigation was undertaken to study the comparative effectiveness of beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and calcium channel blocker verapamil on L-thyroxine-induced alteration on glycemic control and histamine sensitivity on rats and guinea pigs, respectively. Injection of L-thyroxine sodium every alternate day for 3 weeks in guinea pigs (75 microg/kg, i.p.) and rats (75 mg/kg, s.c.) produced a condition similar to thyrotoxicosis. Verapamil and propranolol administered daily in the third week along with L-thyroxine to two separate groups of hyperthyroid animals reversed thyroxine-induced loss in body weight, reduction in serum TSH levels, and rise in body temperature. Effect on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity was studied on rats. Compared to normal rats, L-thyroxine-treated animals showed a state of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance. Propranolol (10 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment significantly decreased fasting serum glucose levels without affecting serum insulin levels, AUC glucose, and K(ITT) values. Treatment with verapamil (5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced fasting serum glucose and insulin levels, AUC glucose, and significantly increased K(ITT) values. Effect of propranolol (15 mg/kg, orally) and verapamil (20 mg/kg, orally) treatment on histamine sensitivity was studied on L-thyroxine-treated guinea pigs. Compared to normal guinea pigs, L-thyroxine-treated guinea pigs showed an increased sensitivity to histamine-induced asphyxia. Verapamil treatment reversed this increased histamine sensitivity while propranolol aggravated it. In conclusion, compared to propranolol, verapamil has advantageous effects on glucose metabolism, insulin and histamine sensitivity and could therefore be a valuable addition as an adjunctive therapy option currently available for thyrotoxicosis associated with diabetes and/or anaphylaxis.",

    "164": "This is a retrospective, non-randomized study. Consecutive adults within 24 h of hospital admission who received intravenous bolus labetalol or nicardipine infusion as first-line antihypertensive therapy were identified. Hemodynamic data were collected through 24 h of therapy.", 
    "165": "Ninety patients received either labetalol (N = 64) or nicardipine (N = 26) initially for blood pressure (BP) management. Stroke types were 54% intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), 22% subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 23% ischemic stroke and were similar between the two drug groups. Baseline patient characteristics and disease severity (APACHE II and GCS) were similar between groups. The average total daily labetalol dose was 40 (10-340) mg and nicardipine infusion was 5 (1-14) mg/h. Initial BP was similar in the two groups. The nicardipine group had less BP variability (N 8.19 vs. L 10.78 mmHg; p = 0.003), fewer dosage adjustments [L 4 (1-17), N 2 (0-5); p < 0.001] and fewer additional antihypertensive agents (L 33%, N 8%; p = 0.013) administered during the 24-h observation period. In patients with ICH, 33% of nicardipine-treated patients achieved target BP within the first 60 min versus 6% of the L group (p = 0.02). Overall, incidence of hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) (L 3%; N 0%) and bradycardia (HR < 60 beats per min) (L 20.6%; N 12%) were comparable between the groups.",

    "167": "Obesity is a known risk factor for hypertension and diabetes, both of which ultimately promote renal dysfunction. In the current study, we investigated the association between body mass index (BMI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 8,168 Japanese individuals (2,924 women, 5,244 men) who underwent general health screening. CKD was diagnosed if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (designated as low eGFR) and/or if the urinary albumin/creatinine value was equal to or greater than 30 mg/g (designated as albuminuria). Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, and smoking habits showed that, in men, both overweight (BMI 25-29 kg/m(2)) and obesity (BMI >or=30 kg/m(2)) were associated with increased prevalence of low eGFR and albuminuria, whereas, in women, obesity was associated with albuminuria, but neither overweight nor obesity was associated with low eGFR. After multivariate adjustment, logistic regression analysis showed that BMI had a graded association with both low eGFR and albuminuria in men. On the other hand, in women, the second and third BMI quartiles were associated with a lower prevalence of albuminuria in comparison with the first BMI quartile. Essentially the same results were obtained when the subjects were subdivided according to the presence and absence of hypertension. Our data showed that overweight and obesity were associated with increased risk for CKD in Japanese individuals undergoing a general health screening, irrespective of the presence or absence of hypertension, although there was a gender difference in these associations.", 
    "168": "We previously reported that a resting heart rate measured at home (home HR) of >or=70 beats per minute was a powerful predictor of the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, and identified factors affecting home HR in the general Japanese population. The present study examines factors affecting home HR in hypertensive patients treated with antihypertensive medications. Home HR was measured using a home blood pressure (BP) device. Information about the characteristics of the patients was collected using questionnaires administered by a physician. Among 3,400 patients, 3,086 measured home HR both in the morning and evening. The mean values of home HR in the morning and evening were 67.2+/-9.1 and 69.6+/-9.2 beats per minute, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that lower age, diabetes mellitus, habitual smoking, higher diastolic BP, and the lack of beta-blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use were determinants of elevated morning or evening home HR. These results suggest that adequate control of risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as smoking and diabetes mellitus or use of heart rate-lowering agents might help to decrease home HR in treated hypertensive patients.", 
    "169": "The aim of investigation was to assess efficiency and safety of the lypophilic beta-adrenobloker taliton (carvedilol) in patients with ischemic cardiomiopathy. 20 patients with ischemic cardiomiopathy entered an open trial, mean age 59 years. All patients received basic therapy (ACE-inhibitors, diuretics, aspirin) and taliton. Starting dose of taliton was 3,125 mg twice daily. Dose increased with 2-weekly interval till target dose 25 mg twice daily. Duration of investigation was 6 months. The efficacy of treatment was assessed by the clinical examination, the results of echocardiography and 24 h monitoring of ECG. After treatment with taliton for 6 months increased ejection fraction, left ventricle sizes and volumes decreased, on 24 monitoring of ECG ST depression decreased. There was no side effects of taliton.", 
    "170": "During insulin secretion, pancreatic alpha-cells are exposed to Zn(2+) released from insulin-containing secretory granules. Although maintenance of Zn(2+) homeostasis is critical for cell survival and glucagon secretion, very little is known about Zn(2+)-transporting pathways and the regulation of Zn(2+) in alpha-cells. To examine the effect of Zn(2+) on glucagon secretion and possible mechanisms controlling the intracellular Zn(2+) level ([Zn(2+)](i)), we employed a glucagon-producing cell line (alpha-TC6) and mouse islets where non-beta-cells were identified using islets expressing green fluorescent protein exclusively in beta-cells. In this study, we first confirmed that Zn(2+) treatment resulted in the inhibition of glucagon secretion in alpha-TC6 cells and mouse islets in vitro. The inhibition of secretion was not likely via activation of K(ATP) channels by Zn(2+). We then determined that Zn(2+) was transported into alpha-cells and was able to accumulate under both low and high glucose conditions, as well as upon depolarization of cells with KCl. The nonselective Ca(2+) channel blocker Gd(3+) partially inhibited Zn(2+) influx in alpha-TC cells, whereas the L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel inhibitor nitrendipine failed to block Zn(2+) accumulation. To investigate Zn(2+) transport further, we profiled alpha-cells for Zn(2+) transporter transcripts from the two families that work in opposite directions, SLC39 (ZIP, Zrt/Irt-like protein) and SLC30 (ZnT, Zn(2+) transporter). We observed that Zip1, Zip10, and Zip14 were the most abundantly expressed Zips and ZnT4, ZnT5, and ZnT8 the dominant ZnTs. Because the redox state of cells is also a major regulator of [Zn(2+)](i), we examined the effects of oxidizing agents on Zn(2+) mobilization within alpha-cells. 2,2'-Dithiodipyridine (-SH group oxidant), menadione (superoxide generator), and SIN-1 (3-morpholinosydnonimine) (peroxynitrite generator) all increased [Zn(2+)](i) in alpha-cells. Together these results demonstrate that Zn(2+) inhibits glucagon secretion, and it is transported into alpha-cells in part through Ca(2+) channels. Zn(2+) transporters and the redox state also modulate [Zn(2+)](i).", 
    "171": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of floating and drug release behaviour of poly(vinyl acetate)-based floating tablets with membrane controlled drug delivery. Propranolol HCl containing tablets with Kollidon SR as an excipient for direct compression and different Kollicoat SR 30 D/Kollicoat IR coats varying from 10 to 20mg polymer/cm2 were investigated regarding drug release in 0.1N HCl. Furthermore, the onset of floating, the floating duration and the floating strength of the device were determined. In addition, benchtop MRI studies of selected samples were performed. Coated tablets with 10mg polymer/cm2 SR/IR, 8.5:1.5 coat exhibited the shortest lag times prior to drug release and floating onset, the fastest increase in and highest maximum values of floating strength. The drug release was delayed efficiently within a time interval of 24 h by showing linear drug release characteristics. Poly(vinyl acetate) proved to be an appropriate excipient to ensure safe and reliable drug release. Floating strength measurements offered the possibility to quantify the floating ability of the developed systems and thus to compare different formulations more efficiently. Benchtop MRI studies allowed a deeper insight into drug release and floating mechanisms noninvasively and continuously.", 
    "172": "We have previously shown that glycine binding sites on presynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs) can tonically regulate glutamate release in the rat visual cortex. In the present study, we investigated the subunit composition of these presynaptic NMDA-Rs. We recorded miniature a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) using whole-cell voltage clamp in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the rat visual cortex with the open-channel NMDA receptor blocker, MK-801, in the recording pipette. We found that the frequency of mEPSCs is significantly reduced by 7-chloro-kynurenic acid (7-Cl KYNA) an NMDA-R glycine binding site antagonist, and glycine reverses this effect. Using a specific antagonist for NR2B-NMDA-Rs, Ro 25-6981 [(alphaR,betaS)-alpha-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-beta-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol hydrochloride], instead of 7-Cl KYNA, we found that the frequency of mEPSCs is also significantly reduced but glycine cannot reverse this effect. Moreover, Zn(2+), an NR2A-NMDA-R antagonist, did not affect mEPSC frequency. These results suggest that presynaptic NR2B-containing NMDA-Rs are located in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the rat visual cortex, and that the glycine binding site of these type NMDA-Rs tonically regulates glutamate release.", 
    "173": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the specificities of the irradiation of drugs in frozen aqueous solution. The structures of the degradation products were determined to gain insight into the radiolysis mechanisms occurring in frozen aqueous solutions. Metoclopramide hydrochloride and metoprolol tartrate were chosen as models. The frozen solutions were irradiated at dry ice temperature by high energy electrons at various doses. The drug purity (chemical potency) and the radiolysis products were quantified by HPLC-DAD. Characterization of the degradation products was performed by LC-APCI-MS-MS. The structures of the radiolysis products detected in irradiated frozen aqueous solutions were compared to those detected in solid-state and aqueous solutions (previous studies). For both metoclopramide and metoprolol, solute loss upon irradiation of frozen aqueous solutions was negligible. Five radiolysis products present in traces were identified in irradiated metoclopramide frozen solutions. Three of them were previously identified in solid-state irradiated metoclopramide crystals. The two others were formed following reactions with the hydroxyl radical (indirect effect). Only one fragmentation product was observed in irradiated metoprolol frozen solutions. For both drugs, radiosterilization of frozen solutions, even at high doses (25 kGy), was found to be possible.",

    "175": "The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and the possible mechanism of action of the synthesized drug isoeugenodilol (a new third-generation beta-adrenoceptor blocker) on the growth factor-induced proliferation of cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and neointimal formation in a rat carotid arterial balloon injury model. Isoeugenodilol significantly inhibited 10% FBS, 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB, and 20 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation. In accordance with these findings, isoeugenodilol revealed blocking of the FBS-inducible progression through the G(0)/G(1) to the S phase of the cell cycle in synchronized cells. Neointimal formation, measured 14 days after injury, was reduced by the oral administration of isoeugenodilol (10 mg/kg/day). In an in vitro assay, isoeugenodilol inhibited the migration of VSMCs stimulated by PDGF-BB. These findings indicate that isoeugenodilol shows an inhibitory potency on neointimal formation due to inhibition of both migration and proliferation of VSMCs. In addition, isoeugenodilol in concentration-dependent manner decreased the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in both VSMCs and balloon-injured carotid arteries. The levels of phosphorylated MEK1/2 and Pyk2 as well as intracellular Ca(2+) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were in concentration-dependent manner reduced by isoeugenodilol. Taken together, these results indicate that isoeugenodilol may suppress mitogen-stimulated proliferation and migration partially through inhibiting cellular ROS and calcium, and hence, through activation of the Pyk2-ERK1/2 signal pathway. This suggests that isoeugenodilol has potential for the prevention of atherosclerosis and restenosis.", 
    "176": "The recently reported X-ray structure of the Beta2-adrenergic receptor, the first reported crystal structure of a ligand-mediated GPCR, is used to explore its utility in computer-aided drug design. Validations were conducted with known beta blockers. This was followed by high-throughput docking studies with proprietary and commercial databases to further validate the X-ray structure's usefulness as a design tool and to explore the potential for discovery of novel chemical classes acting as Beta2 inhibitors. Our results include the finding of ligands with traditional beta-blocker motifs as well as new motifs, thereby serving to both validate the approach and project its usefulness in the finding and design of novel compounds."
