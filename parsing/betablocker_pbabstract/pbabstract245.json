Echocardiogram revealed diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricle (ejection fraction 32%). Thallium scintigraphy demonstrated patchy perfusion defects. She was diagnosed as having congestive heart failure due to myocardial fibrosis, and was treated successfully with diuretics, cardiotonics, and beta-blocker. Scintigraphy may be useful to detect an early cardiac involvement in patients with systemic sclerosis, and intense pharmacological treatment might be started even before the patient develops symptoms.",

The study had an open, randomized, 2-period crossover design with a 1-week washout period. Plasma samples were obtained over a 24-hour interval. Atenolol concentrations were analyzed by combined reversed phase liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection (lambda(EX) = 258 nm, lambda(EM) = 300 nm). From the atenolol plasma concentration versus time curves, the following pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained: AUC(0-24h), AUC(0- infinity ), and C(max). The geometric mean of test/reference 50-mg tablets individual percent ratio was 102.2% for AUC(0-24h), and 101.6% for C(max). The 90% confidence intervals (CI) were 100.2% to 105.4% and 100.9% to 103.5%, respectively. Since the 90% CI for both C(max) and AUC(0-24h) were within the 80% to 125% interval proposed by the Food and Drug Administration, it was concluded that atenolol (50-mg tablets) test formulation was bioequivalent to the reference formulation, with regard to both the rate and extent of absorption.",

All dogs were medicated with a beta1-adrenergic antagonist. Subsequent examinations showed that the dynamic LVOT obstruction and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy had almost completely resolved. Dynamic LVOT obstruction is a rare condition of young dogs of different breeds. The precise aetiology of the condition remains uncertain. Whether resolution of the outflow obstruction in these four cases was a consequence of treatment or due to changes in ventricular architecture brought about by ageing cannot be established.", 
    "14": "A restricted access media-molecularly imprinted polymer (RAM-MIP) for propranolol (PRP) has been prepared for direct injection analysis of beta-blockers in biological fluids. First, the MIP for PRP was prepared using methacrylic acid and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the functional monomer and cross-linker, respectively, by a multi-step swelling and polymerization method. Next, a 1:1 mixture of glycerol monomethacrylate and glycerol dimethacrylate was used for hydrophilic surface modification, and added directly to the MIP for PRP after 4 h from the start of polymerization. Then further polymerization was carried out for 20 h. The obtained RAM-MIP for PRP showed excellent molecular recognition ability for PRP, good ones for alprenolol (ALP) and pindolol, and fair ones for other beta-blockers. The RAM-MIP was applied for direct injection analysis of ALP enantiomers in a rat plasma sample by a column-switching HPLC system using a beta-cyclodextrin phenylcarbamate-bonded silica column as the analytical column. The calibration graph, constructed from peak area versus each ALP enantiomer concentration, was linear with a correlation coefficient of > 0.999 over the concentration ranges of 12.5-250 ng ml(-1). The limit of quantitation was 12.5 ng ml(-1) with a 50 microl injection. This method could be applicable for the assay of ALP enantiomers at the therapeutic plasma levels, and have wide applicability for the assay of beta-blockers in biological fluids.", 
    "15": "1 There is good evidence that beta-blockers improve ventricular function, disease progression and survival in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of atenolol therapy on the sympathetic nervous system at rest and after ergometric exercise, on left ventricular function and on baseline plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). 2 Twenty-two patients [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <36%; New York Heart Association II-III] were studied before atenolol treatment. Because of cardiac events (new Hospital admission or death) only 13 patients completed 1 year of treatment. Baseline noradrenaline (NE) concentrations were similar in patients and controls while ANF was higher in patients than in controls (328 +/- 35 pg ml(-1) vs. 37 +/- 3 pg ml(-1); P<0.01). 3 Patients with events showed higher NE (540 +/- 87 pg ml(-1) vs. 303 +/- 44 pg ml(-1); P<0.01) and ANF (460 +/- 70 pg ml(-1) vs. 291 +/- 44 pg ml(-1); P<0.03) at rest; and greater NE response to exercise (2.003 +/- 525 pg ml(-1) vs. 694 +/- 121 pg ml(-1); P<0.005). Atenolol treatment improved LVEF (19.5 +/- 1.9% vs. 33 +/- 3.9%; P<0.001), increased exercise tolerance (9 +/- 3.2 min vs. 17 +/- 4.8 min; P<0.001) and decreased plasma ANF (292 +/- 42 pg ml(-1) vs. 133 +/- 35 pg ml(-1); P<0.01). 4 Reduced basal dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG)/NE ratio (3.4 +/- 0.46 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.35; P<0.01) was observed in patients compared with healthy volunteers. Atenolol increased DHPG plasma levels (1.398 +/- 129 pg ml(-1) vs. 913 +/- 86 pg ml(-1); P<0.005) but the DHPG/NE ratio during exercise was not modified after treatment, suggesting that re-uptake of released NE is not changed by beta-blocker treatment. 5 In conclusion, the fact that atenolol treatment improves ventricular dysfunction and clinical status without changing plasma NE levels in CHF patients, suggests that plasma NE is a poor surrogate measurement for cardiac sympathetic activity in this pathology. In addition, decrease in plasma ANF produced by atenolol treatment may reflect the improvement of ventricular function.", 
    "16": "The authors summarize the up-to-date knowledge relating to the pharmacological treatment of atrial fibrillation. They emphasize that drug treatment continues to be in the forefront of the therapy of the arrhythmia, which can now be considered to constitute a cardiovascular epidemic. In the era following the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AF-FIRM) trial, the strategy of pharmacological treatment will certainly change: in place of \"rhythm control\", which in recent decades has been overforced in patients identical with the elderly, cardiac patients with an impaired left ventricular function who were enrolled into AFFIRM, there will be a more frequent use of ventricular \"rate control\". Naturally, this does not mean that, in certain patient groups, an effort should not be made to restore and maintain the sinus rhythm. In cases involving congestive heart failure and structural heart disease complicated by a depressed left ventricular systolic function, atrial fibrillation is currently treated with antiarrhythmic drugs possessing low proarrhythmic activity that prolong refractory period (Class 3), and with the even safer mortality-reducing beta-receptor blockers. The classical antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) are being increasingly forced into the background, and the areas of indication of the novel Na(+)-channel blocker antiarrhythmics (propafenone, flecainide) have also narrowed: they are administered only in the event of atrial fibrillation in patients with a structurally intact heart or left ventricular hypertrophy. After a brief survey of the more important aspects of ventricular rate control, and of the drugs available, the research trends aimed at the progression of the pharmacological treatment of atrial fibrillation are outlined. The clinical introduction of procedures based on myocardial gene therapy is now a realistic therapeutic approach as concerns atrial fibrillation too.",

Trials with different drugs and other therapeutic modalities including beta-blockers, intravenous amiodarone and override suppression of automatic atrial foci by atrial pacing have shown partial success as preventive measures. However, a comparison between those three interventions has not been reported.", 
    "19": "Thirty-six consecutive patients that underwent CABG at our institution were randomly assigned to atrial pacing (18 patients) and intravenous amiodarone (18 patients) after baseline clinical, electrocardiographic and hemodynamic assessment. All patients received concomitant oral metoprolol or atenolol right after extubation. Thirty-three patients who had CABG at our center in the previous two months and that only received beta-blockers during their perioperative period served as a control group.", 
    "20": "The majority of baseline clinical and hemodynamic characteristics were similar in all groups. Only one patient (5.6%) developed AF in the atrial pacing group versus five (27.8%) on amiodarone and six (18.2%) who only received beta-blockers. That finding, however, did not attain statistical significance (p > 0.05). After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds of occurrence of AF was 77% lower in atrial pacing patients (OR = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.02, 2.20; p = 0.09) and 2.36 times higher in those on amiodarone (95% CI: 0.55, 10.24; P = 0.053) when compared to patients which only received beta blockers. Since only one patient on right atrial pacing developed atrial fibrillation, the analysis of the median time to onset and median duration of atrial fibrillation was restricted to those assigned to amiodarone and those who only received beta-blockers showing no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). Although no statistical significance was achieved, the median hospital stay was one-day shorter in the beta-blockers group. Most of the side effects were minor and resolved without sequelae.",

While the molecular mechanisms governing E. coli O157:H7 pathogenesis have been intensively investigated, the role of host factors has received less attention. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the enteric catecholamines norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) modulate interactions of the cecal mucosa with E. coli O157:H7. Full-thickness sheets of murine cecum were mounted in Ussing chambers and short circuit current and tissue electrical conductance were periodically determined to assess active transepithelial ion transport and ionic permeability, respectively. Neurochemicals and stationary-phase E. coli O157:H7 were exposed respectively to the contraluminal and luminal aspects of the mucosa. Epithelial adherence of E. coli O157:H7 was quantified by a bacterial adhesion assay after 90 min of luminal E. coli O157:H7 exposure. DA and NE increased E. coli O157:H7 adherence relative to untreated control tissues at 50% effective concentrations of 3.8 microM and 4.2 microM respectively. Pretreatment of tissues with either the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol prevented the action of NE. The effect of DA was prevented by the dopamine antagonist haloperidol. The drugs did not impair tissue viability or transepithelial conductance. The present findings suggest that enteric catecholamines modulate E. coli O157:H7 adherence to the cecal epithelium. Conditions associated with elevated catecholamine release, such as stress exposure, may influence host susceptibility to E. coli O157:H7 infection.", 
    "23": "In this study we investigated diurnal changes in the activation state of the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) in the rat pineal gland. In animals housed under a lighting regimen with 12 h of light, we found an increase in phosphorylated p90RSK during the dark phase, and this increase was abolished by treatment with propranolol or continuous exposure to light. To determine the intracellular mechanism involved, rat pinealocytes were treated with norepinephrine. Norepinephrine caused a parallel increase in phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK (p42/44(MAPK)) and p90RSK that was reduced by prazosin or propranolol, indicating involvement of both alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Treatment with dibutyryl cGMP, 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or ionomycin mimicked norepinephrine-stimulated p90RSK phosphorylation, whereas dibutyryl cAMP caused a decrease in p90RSK phosphorylation. Inhibition of p42/44(MAPK) activation by UO126 was effective in reducing norepinephrine-stimulated p90RSK phosphorylation. Moreover, UO126 had an inhibitory effect on norepinephrine-stimulated arylalkyl-N-acetyltransferase activity. These results indicate that the adrenergically regulated nocturnal increase in p90RSK phosphorylation is mainly mediated through a cGMP-->p42/44(MAPK)-dependent mechanism.", 
    "24": "We determined the cardiovascular effects of microinjecting the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, into the rostral raphe pallidus (RPa) on arterial pressure (AP), heart rate (HR) and cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (CSNA) in urethane-chloralose anesthetized, artificially-ventilated rats. In 26 animals, microinjection of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline (2 mM, 30 nl), into RPa increased CSNA (+234+/-64% of control), HR (+91+/-10 bpm) and mean AP (+16+/-3 mmHg). A similar tachycardia was evoked after removal of both adrenal glands, but was absent after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with atenolol. Equivalent percentage increases in CSNA and HR were evoked by disinhibition of the rostral RPa neurons after inhibition of cardiovascular sympathetic premotor neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) with bilateral microinjections of the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol (6 mM, 50 nl) which markedly lowered CSNA, HR and AP. These results indicate that RPa contains a population of neurons, possibly sympathetic premotor neurons with direct projections to spinal cardiac sympathetic preganglionic neurons, that receive a tonic, GABAergic inhibition and thus do not contribute markedly to resting levels of CSNA and HR, but when disinhibited, they can produce large increases in CSNA and HR comparable to those seen during certain stress responses.", 
    "25": "An interim analysis of the AASK trial at three years demonstrates a renoprotective effect [slower decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), delayed onset of significant decrease in GFR, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death, and a decrease in urinary protein excretion] of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, as compared to the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP-CCB), amlodipine, in patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency. The beneficial effect occurred in the presence of similar levels of blood pressure control and was apparent in patients with proteinuric (beyond the threshold of \"dipstick positive\" proteinuria, 300 mg/day) and non-proteinuric hypertensive nephrosclerosis. At the time of the interim analysis, the effectiveness of the beta-blocker metoprolol was not significantly different from that of the ACE inhibitor. The data suggest that DHP-CCBs should be used with caution in the presence of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency.", 
    "26": "The foundation on which the treatment of obesity rests is made up of the procedures aimed at unbalancing the equation of energy balance in favour of calorie consumption. Pharmacological treatment is aimed at favouring a reduction of calorie intake or stimulating calorie production. Depending on their mechanism of action, the drugs that are used in the treatment of obesity can be divided into appetite inhibitors, inhibitors of food intake or blockers of fat digestion and stimulators of thermogenesis. Amongst the appetite inhibitors, besides the adrenergic agents such as those of the amphetamine type, which are forbidden because of their addictive effect, are the serotonin uptake inhibitors such as dexfenfluramine (withdrawn in 1997) and fluoxetine. The recent commercialisation of sibutramine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with an appetite inhibiting and thermogenesis stimulating effect, offer new perspectives in this field. Amongst inhibitors, mention is deserved by orlistat that inhibits the absorption of upto 30% of ingested fat without causing secondary effects of significance. In the area of thermogenic drugs there are the ephedrine-caffeine association, and the adrenergic beta antagonists, which are still being researched. There are numerous future perspectives amongst which are leptin, analogs of GLP-1 and cholecystokinin and neuropeptide Y antagonists. It is necessary to have reliable predictive elements that make it possible to know the most useful drugs, as well as the sort of patients who will benefit most from the different pharmacological treatments.",

More recently, some investigators reported cases of elderly patients who had improved clinical conditions and left ventricular (LV) systolic function, but neither the prevalence nor the clinical variables associated with this phenomenon have ever been characterized in this population. To assess the prevalence and the predictors of \"improvement\" of HF, we prospectively analyzed 87 patients with a recent diagnosis of HF and LV systolic dysfunction, aged >70 years, who were consecutively admitted to our center for functional class impairment (New York Heart Association class III and IV). After discharge, patients underwent clinical and echocardiographic evaluations every 6 months. During follow-up (17 +/- 9 months) improvement was documented in 31 subjects (36%). The variables associated with improvement in the multivariate analysis were the absence of diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 5.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 19.9, p = 0.007), history of arterial hypertension (OR 3.9, CI 1.3 to 11.1, p = 0.01), and beta-blocker therapy (OR 3.4, CI 1.1 to 10.8, p = 0.03). An improvement in clinical status and LV systolic function is not infrequently observed in patients >70 years of age who have a recent diagnosis of HF. This behavior occurs prevalently in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy who have a history of arterial hypertension, and is inversely related to the presence of diabetes mellitus.",

New data from HOPE, LIFE, and ALLHAT underscores the importance of blood pressure reduction for patients with coronary artery disease. Despite our improved understanding of the mechanism by which the various classes of antihypertensive medications achieve their effect, it remains the case that blood pressure reduction remains more important than the medication used to achieve the reduction. For most patients with coronary artery disease, combination therapy will be required to achieve a target blood pressure of less than 140/80. When tolerated, this therapy should include a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor, both of which are of prognostic benefit for patients with coronary artery disease. There are also attractions in choosing calcium antagonists because of their efficacy in controlling anginal symptoms (Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers if already on a beta-blocking agent and rate-limiting calcium channel blockers if beta blockers are contraindicated). Thiazide diuretics have proven themselves effective again in the ALLHAT study and are likely to be an integral part of treatment for the great majority of patients with coronary artery disease.",

Cardiac remodeling plays important roles in the progression of cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction, valvular heart diseases, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. In addition to cardiac myocytes, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix proteins and coronary vasculature are also involved in the remodeling process. Cardiac remodeling is associated with alterations of many mediators such as neurohumoral factors, cytokines, enzymes, ion channels, oxidative stress and mechanical stress. Although remodeling is initially an adaptive response to maintain normal cardiac function, it gradually becomes maladaptive and leads to progressive decompensation. Recent research has attempted to elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms of cardiac remodeling and to develop novel therapeutic strategies for heart failure. The modulation of remodeling process is effective for preventing the progression of heart failure.", 
    "46": "The study was aimed to examine the effects of different types of hyperlipidemia on the pharmacokinetics of lipophilic propranolol and hydrophilic atenolol. Thirty subjects were divided into four study groups: normolipemics, hypercholesterolemics, hypertriglyceridemics, and patients with mixed form of hyperlipidemia. The drugs were administered orally at a single dose of 80 mg for propranolol and 100 mg for atenolol, using a cross-over study design. Pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs were calculated using a noncompartmental open model. The results of the present study demonstrated a possible influence of dyslipidemia on pharmacokinetics of both the lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. As for the lipophilic drug propranolol, a significant decrease in elimination rate constant was found (from 0.24 +/- 0.08 h(-1) to 0.16 +/- 0.04 h(-1), p < 0.03) in comparison to normolipemic subjects. In the case of the hydrophilic atenolol, the most marked alterations were also seen in subjects with mixed form of hyperlipidemia, especially significantly lower values of area under the concentration-time curve (8950.8 +/- 2060.5 ng/ml x h and 6715.4 +/- 1813.8 ng/ml x h, p < 0.05) as well as higher elimination rate constant (0.08 +/- 0.03 h(-1) and 0.13 +/- 0.05 h(-1), p < 0.05) in comparison with the controls, respectively. Total body clearance per kg of body weight of propranolol as well as atenolol was not influenced by dyslipidemias. The results of the study indicate that lipid metabolism disturbances might to some extent influence the pharmacokinetics of propranolol and atenolol, with the most significant alterations seen in the patients with mixed form of hyperlipidemia.",

    "51": "It has recently been reported that light/dark transitions lead to changes in choroidal blood flow. Several observations indicate that these changes in choroidal perfusion are triggered at least in part by neural mechanisms. In the present study we hypothesised that the choroidal blood flow response to changes in retinal illumination may be modified by either the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine or by the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol. In 15 healthy subjects the response of choroidal perfusion was studied in a randomised placebo-controlled three way cross-over study using laser Doppler flowmetry and laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude. Before drug administration a transition from light to dark reduced both choroidal haemodynamic parameters by 8%-12%. Neither propranolol nor atropine altered basal choroidal blood flow or choroidal blood flow responses to light/dark transitions. Our data indicate that neither muscarinic nor beta-receptors are involved in the choroidal blood flow response to changes in retinal illumination. Further studies are required to elucidate which mechanisms contribute to this blood flow behaviour of the choroid.",

    "86": "Loss of adequate endothelial cell function (associated with various cardiovascular syndromes such as hypertension) is most widely quantified by assessing flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) or measuring plasma markers such as von Willebrand factor (vWF). However, the relationship between these two methods is unclear, as is their relationship to 10-year cardiovascular risk (defined by the Framingham equation) and their response to intensive cardiovascular risk factor management. We tested the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship between vWF and FMD by measuring both in 132 subjects, of whom 89 were hypertensive (mean blood pressure, 167/91 mmHg) and 43 were healthy normotensive (mean blood pressure, 133/80 mmHg). High-resolution ultrasound assessed endothelium-dependent brachial artery FMD following reactive hyperaemia after occlusion. Plasma vWF was defined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These measurements were repeated in the patients after 6 months of intensive cardiovascular risk factor management. vWF and FMD correlated significantly (r = -0.517, P < 0.001), and both correlated with 10-year cardiovascular risk using the Framingham equation (vWF, r = 0.48, P < 0.001; FMD, r = -0.624, P < 0.001). Following 6 months intensive cardiovascular risk factor management, plasma vWF was significantly reduced whereas FMD significantly increased (both P < 0.002). We conclude that two fundamentally different methods for assessing endothelial function correlate well with each other, as well as with 10-year cardiovascular risk. Six months of intensive risk factor management is beneficial to the endothelium, as defined by improved vWF and FMD. These methods might therefore be useful indices to identify patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, and may also assist in the understanding of early developments in the pathogenesis of vascular risk in hypertension.",

The chemicals, tested at different concentrations, were benzalkonium chloride (BAC), sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), polyoxyethylene-20-stearyl ether (PSE), polyethoxylated castor oil (PCO), deoxycholic acid sodium salt (DC) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). For these substances, definite correlations were found between promoting activity for permeation of TM and modification of electrophysiological parameters. These parameters were in all cases significantly altered by all agents at all concentrations after a 5-h contact. However, after a 1-h contact, 0.001% PSE and CPC did not significantly modify the corneal resistance, while PCO and PSE did not significantly modify the transcorneal potential at the tested concentrations. Only 0.001% PSE, a nonionic surfactant used as solubilizer and emulsifier, active as promoter for TM, did not modify both electrophysiological parameters to a significant extent after 1 h.

    "97": "Sympathetic nervous system activity (SNSA) is believed to participate in the genesis of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTA) but understanding has been impeded by the number and complexity of effects and the paucity of data from humans. New information from studies of genetic disorders, animal models, and spontaneous human arrhythmias indicates the importance of the temporal pattern of SNSA in arrhythmia development. The proarrhythmic effects of short-term elevations of SNSA are exemplified by genetic disorders and include enhancement of early and delayed afterdepolarizations and increased dispersion of repolarization. The role of long-term elevations of SNSA is suggested by animal models of enhanced SNSA signaling that results in apoptosis, hypertrophy, and fibrosis, and sympathetic nerve sprouting caused by infusion of nerve growth factor. Processes that overlap short- and long-term effects are suggested by changes in R-R interval variability (RRV) that precede VTA in patients by several hours. SNSA-mediated alterations in gene expression of ion channels may account for some intermediate-term effects. The propensity for VTA is highest when short-, intermediate, and long-term changes are superimposed. Because the proarrhythmic effects are related to the duration and intensity of SNSA, normal regulatory processes such as parasympathetic activity that inhibits SNSA, and oscillations that continuously vary the intensity of SNSA may provide vital antiarrhythmic protection that is lost in severe heart failure and other disorders. These observations may have therapeutic implications. The recommended use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers to achieve a constant level of inhibition does not take into account the temporal patterns and regional heterogeneity of SNSA, the proarrhythmic effects of alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation, or the potential proarrhythmic effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Further research is needed to determine if other approaches to SNSA modulation can enhance the antiarrhythmic effects.", 
    "98": "Hypertension is twice as common in patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. It accounts for up to 75% of cardiovascular disease risk leading to the substantial increase in morbidity and mortality. Control of blood pressure in people with diabetes has been shown in randomized controlled trials to decrease cardiovascular risk and improve outcome especially in preventing stroke. A target blood pressure goal of <130/80 mm Hg is currently recommended for patients with diabetes. However, less than 1/3 of these patients achieve such a goal. This is in part due to the inherent difficulty in controlling blood pressure in these patients where hypertension is usually associated with increased salt sensitivity, volume expansion and isolated systolic hypertension. Therefore, patients with diabetes usually require multiple medications for optimal blood pressure control. Calcium channel antagonists have been shown in large clinical trials to be both safe and effective in controlling blood pressure in diabetic patients and will continue to play a major role in the management of hypertension in this population, particularly in the combination therapy that these patients usually require.",

The increase amounted to 47% of the effect of xamoterol and was blocked by propranolol. On isolated, electrically stimulated, left ventricular muscle-strip preparations from failing human myocardium, bucindolol did not change the force of contraction under control conditions. In myocardial preparations pretreated with metoprolol (30 micromol/L, 90 minutes, subsequent washout), bucindolol significantly increased the force of contraction (P<0.001 vs control). In nonfailing atrial myocardium, isoproterenol pretreatment (1 micromol/L, 60 minutes) abolished the positive inotropic effect of xamoterol that was present under control conditions (P<0.05 vs control).

While further investigation is warranted in certain subgroups, the use of beta-adrenergic blockers in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV heart failure should now be considered routine. The purpose of this article is to outline and review the five major clinical trials of beta-blocker therapy in chronic heart failure; the US Carvedilol heart failure Program (USCP), the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS-II), the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in chronic Heart Failure (MERIT-HF), the Beta-blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) and the Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival trial (COPERNICUS), and to aid the reader in the selection of appropriate candidates for beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "106": "The therapeutic efficacy and safety of beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs has been well established in patients with angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension and reducing the risk of mortality and nonfatal reinfarction on survival of acute myocardial infarction. The calcium antagonists are used for the treatment of patients with angina pectoris, long-term systemic hypertension, and the management of hypertensive emergencies and also for a multitude of other cardiovascular and noncardiovascular conditions. Because adverse cardiovascular effects can occur, however, patients being considered for combination treatment with propranolol and diltiazem must be selected carefully and observed closely. In this article, we present a suicidal case of drug overdose with propranolol and diltiazem with unusual electrocardiographic changes.", 
    "107": "Sudden cardiac arrest survivors have a high risk of suffering from recurrent arrhythmic events. Recent studies have shown that these patients have a significantly decreased mortality rate, if they are supplied with an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognosis of patients with electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic drug therapy in comparison to patients with ICD. 204 consecutive survivors of sudden cardiac arrest were enrolled in this study. All patients were examined with an initial electrophysiologic study (EPS) with programmed ventricular stimulation. Patients were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs (if the inducible tachycardia was suppressed) or with the implantation of an ICD. The maximal follow-up period was 120 months, the mean period was 53.3 +/- 31.4 months (ICD) versus 60.3 +/- 35.5 months (EPS, nonsignificant). Patients with ICD showed an overall mortality rate of 14.6%, whereas EPS-guided patients had a mortality rate of 43.2% (p < 0.001). The cardiac and arrhythmogenic mortality rates were significantly lower in the ICD group (12 vs. 43%, p < 0.01, and 1 vs. 16%, p < 0.001, respectively). A reduction of the mortality risk was observed in the ICD group by up to 61% (all-cause mortality), 52% (cardiac mortality) and 97.2% (arrhythmogenic mortality). In arrhythmic event survivors with ICD, arrhythmic and overall mortality rates are significantly lower compared to patients with an EPS-guided drug therapy. In the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death, ICD should be the first choice of antiarrhythmic therapy.", 
    "108": "The simultaneous occurrence of essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus is exceedingly common. In recent years the treatment of the cardiovascular and renal complications has not only become more specific but more effective. The evidence-based medicine data have been provided through many large multicenter studies and strongly support the promise not only of effective treatment in retarding the progression of target-organ involvement, but also the potential of reversal. These dramatic therapeutic improvements have been made possible by wedding the involved pathophysiologic disease mechanisms with the actions of pharmacologic agents. Inherent in this concept is the promise of retarding the development of the cardiovascular and renal morbid events and also reducing their associated mortal endpoints.", 
    "109": "Several large, prospective, randomized, clinical outcome trials have shown that calcium channel blockers are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs compared with placebo and reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of treated patients. In other studies, when compared with conventional antihypertensive drugs, they demonstrated similar blood pressure-lowering effects and similar reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with the exception of a higher incidence of heart failure and fatal myocardial infarction in some studies. However, considering all the evidence available today, these drugs should be considered safe for the treatment of the uncomplicated hypertensive patient in combination with other drugs. They can also be used as first-line therapy for older, stroke-prone hypertensive patients. In addition, when a calcium channel blocker is indicated for better blood pressure control, its use should not be withheld for safety concerns.", 
    "110": "Marked interpatient variability exists in blood pressure response to beta-blocker monotherapy. We tested the hypothesis that 2 common polymorphisms in the gene for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor are associated with antihypertensive response to metoprolol in patients with uncomplicated hypertension.",

Patients took 50 mg metoprolol twice daily with weekly titration to response or 200 mg twice daily. After a minimum of 4 weeks at stable dose, treatment phase 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was repeated. The codon 49 and 389 genotypes for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor were determined by polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. Multilinear regression was performed to determine the impact of genotype and other variables on blood pressure response to metoprolol.", 
    "112": "Patients homozygous for Arg at codon 389 had a nearly 3-fold greater reduction in daytime diastolic blood pressure (-13.3% +/- 8.4% versus -4.5% +/- 8.2%, P =.0018) compared with those who carried the variant allele. The haplotype pair (diplotype) for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor was also a significant predictor of response, with patients having the Ser49Arg389/Ser49Arg389 diplotype demonstrating a decline in blood pressure of 14.7 mm Hg versus 0.5 mm Hg in patients with the Gly49Arg389/Ser49Gly389 diplotype. In multiregression analysis, baseline daytime diastolic blood pressure, codon 389 genotype, and codon 49 genotype were significant predictors of blood pressure after treatment.",

    "119": "The perinatal data of 66 fetuses with SVT were retrospectively studied from January 1990 to December 2000. Junctional tachycardia was found in 50 fetuses and atrial flutter was found in 16 fetuses. Two groups were studied depending on the absence (n=40) or the presence of hydrops (n=26) at the time of the diagnosis. All fetuses but one were treated prenatally via the mother. Anti-arrhythmic drugs used were: digoxin, sotalol, flecainide or amiodarone.", 
    "120": "Group of fetuses with no hydrops: digoxin was used in 32 cases and allowed 26 fetuses to be converted to sinus rhythm (80%). One intra uterine death (IUD) occurred in this group. Hydropic fetuses group: nine fetuses were converted to sinus rhythm using either flecainide (n=7) or amiodarone (n=2) as first line therapy, whilst digoxin alone or in association with sotalol failed to restore sinus rhythm in all cases. After first line therapy, SVT persisted in 10 fetuses. Nine fetuses received amiodarone alone or in association with digoxin as second line therapy, five of whom were converted to sinus rhythm. Among the 18 alive neonates treated by amiodarone in utero, three presented elevated thyroid stimulating hormone at day 3-4 and required thyroid hormonal substitution therapy for 2-6 months with normal outcome.", 
    "121": "Glutamatergic synaptic transmission is mediated primarily through the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR); the regulation of this receptor underlies many forms of synaptic plasticity. In particular, phosphorylation of GluR1, an AMPAR subunit, by PKA at serine 845 (S845) increases peak open channel probability and is permissive for both the synaptic expression of the receptor and NMDA-receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). Robust NMDAR activation activates PKA as well as other signaling enzymes; however, we find that maximal NMDAR activation dephosphorylates GluR1 at the PKA site S845. Coincident inhibition of phosphatases blocks NMDAR-induced dephosphorylation of S845, but surprisingly does not promote PKA phosphorylation at this site. However, we find that phosphorylation of S845 is increased by the activation of a Gs-coupled receptor, the beta1-adrenergic receptor. Interestingly, this divergent signaling occurs despite a more robust coupling of the NMDAR to cAMP generation. In addition, NMDAR activation plays a dominant role in S845 regulation, because activation of beta1AR after NMDAR activation has no detectable effect on S845 phosphorylation. These data (1) demonstrate highly specific coupling between these receptors and this substrate, (2) provide an example of a substrate critical in NMDAR-dependent LTP that is incompletely regulated by the NMDAR, and (3) highlight the importance of identifying the physiological signals that regulate these critical synaptic substrates.", 
    "122": "The incorporation of antitachycardia pacing (ATP) into implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) has provided a better tolerated alternative to shocks. ATP has been shown to be effective in terminating approximately 80% to 90% of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) episodes. Although ATP is routinely used, little is known about predictors of ATP failure. Based on the evaluation of stored electrograms, we aimed to prospectively follow patients with ICDs, and to analyze parameters affecting ATP effectiveness. One hundred eighteen consecutive patients received ICDs for standard indications. Before discharge, empirical, standardized ATP therapy was programmed in all patients within VT zones. A total of 1,218 spontaneous tachycardia episodes occurred in 51 patients during a mean follow-up of 24.5 +/- 12 months. Among these, 888 VTs were diagnosed. One hundred four fast VTs were detected in the ventricular fibrillation zone and treated with primary shock delivery. ATP was attempted 881 times in the remaining 784 VT episodes. ATP terminated 640 VTs successfully, ATP failed in 55 VTs finally reverted by shocks, and 89 VTs converted to a slower VT outside the VT zone. Fifty-one of these slower VTs reverted spontaneously, and 38 were redetected and treated. Finally, in primary intention-to-treat basis, ATP was successful in 691 VTs (88%) and unsuccessful in 93 VTs (12%). There was no influence of VT cycle length on ATP success rate. Furthermore, ATP efficacy was similar between patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35% or >35%, between daytime and nighttime, as well as between patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. A faster heart rate immediately preceding the onset of VT (103 +/- 19 vs 78 +/- 14 beats/min, respectively, hazard ratio 4.08, 95% confidence interval 2.11 to 7.89, p <0.001), and absence of beta-blocker therapy (82% vs 93%, respectively, hazard ratio 2.71, 95% confidence interval 1.72 to 4.29, p = 0.02) were found, by Cox proportional-hazard analysis, to be the sole independent predictors of ATP ineffectiveness in ICD recipients. Thus, the present study identified both preceding sinus tachycardia (reflecting an increased sympathetic tone) and lack of beta-blocker use as independent risk factors for reduced success of ATP therapy in terminating VT. Therefore, modification of sympathetic tone may be beneficial for patients with ICDs.",

    "124": "The data source was a survey among practising ophthalmologists in Switzerland assessing their experience with glaucoma patients/ocular hypertensives put for the first time on the fixed combination of timolol and dorzolamide. A total of 98 patients underwent the therapy switch in at least one eye. The intraocular pressure (IOP) change between the baseline visit before switch to the timolol-dorzolamide fixed combination occurred, and the first follow-up control after the switch, served as an indicator of compliance.", 
    "125": "The IOP decreased on average from 19.43 +/- 5.64 mmHg to 17.97 +/- 3.58 mmHg (p < 0.01). The time to the follow-up visit ranged from 4 to 354 days, and the magnitude of IOP change demonstrated a significant dependence on the time to the follow-up visit, also when corrected for baseline IOP level. A total of 87 (85.3%) continued on the timolol-dorzolamide fixed combination therapy after the first control visit. In 68 of these 98 patients the contralateral eyes underwent the same therapy switch, and their IOP followed an identical pattern of behaviour.", 
    "126": "The average IOP decrease of 1.5 mmHg upon therapy switch to the timolol-dorzolamide fixed combination suggests a better efficacy due to improved compliance. Short-term compliance benefit seems to be more pronounced. The high timolol-dorzolamide fixed combination therapy continuation rate reflects an improvement in compliance and subjectively-perceived convenience.", 
    "127": "We hypothesized that abnormal oxidative stress in chronic heart failure (CHF) could be related to endothelial damage and platelet activation, and that the vasodilating beta-blocker carvedilol would have beneficial effects on these processes compared with a selective non-vasodilating cardioselective beta-blocker, bisoprolol. We therefore assessed the effects of introducing carvedilol and bisoprolol in a prospective manner on indices of oxidative stress [lipid hydroperoxides (LHP)], endothelial damage [von Willebrand factor (vWf)], platelet activation (soluble P-selectin) and coagulation (fibrinogen) and their inter-relationships in stable outpatients with CHF in sinus rhythm. We recruited 46 patients [23 male; age 64 +/- 13 years (mean +/- S.D.); range 38-85 years] with CHF. Baseline levels of serum LHP (P<0.002), plasma vWf (P<0.001) and soluble P-selectin (P=0.02), but not fibrinogen (P=0.16), were higher in CHF patients compared with 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. After treatment for 2 months, systolic blood pressure fell in both arms of the study (both P<0.01), but there were no statistically significant (defined as P<0.01) decreases in LHP, vWf, fibrinogen or soluble P-selectin levels with either carvedilol or bisoprolol. In conclusion, patients with CHF have increased levels of plasma LHP and vWf, indicating increased oxidative stress and endothelial damage respectively. Contrary to the proposed antioxidative effects of carvedilol, initiating and titrating such therapy did not result in a reduction in levels of LHP in CHF.", 
    "128": "Supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) present as recurrent palpitations. Unlike ventricular tachycardias, these arrhythmias usually carry a benign prognosis. It is important to exclude structural heart disease in these patients. Though vagal manoeuvres and drug therapy are useful for acute termination of SVTs, recurrences are common. Catheter ablation is safe, highly effective and has a curative potential. It obviates the need for long-term medical therapy as it eliminates the arrhythmia in these patients.", 
    "129": "Recognising ventricular origin of a broad QRS tachycardia helps to appropriately identify and manage patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the emergency. Relatively simple clinical and ECG clues help in reaching the correct diagnosis in the majority of patients. Management strategies vary with the clinical diagnosis and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is indicated for chronic prophylactic therapy in patients with coronary artery disease and serious ventricular arrhythmias, especially in those with ventricular dysfunction. The role of this device in patients with stable VT and ejection fractions > 0.35 deserves closer scrutiny. Radiofrequency ablation mostly plays an adjunctive role. Anti-arrhythmic drugs (amiodarone/sotalol and beta-blockers) are required to prevent frequent recurrences. A hybrid approach combining all these therapeutic modalities is often needed. Prognosis in patients with specific VT syndromes such as right ventricular outflow VT, left ventricular fascicular VT and left ventricular outflow VT is excellent with drugs. Radiofrequency ablation is curative in such syndromes.", 
    "130": "Although the renin angiotensin system (RAS) is a major regulator of vascular homeostasis, the role of the RAS in tumor angiogenesis is little understood. Here we show that host angiotensin II (ATII) type 1 (AT1) receptor plays an important role in angiogenesis and growth of tumor cells engrafted in mice. Subcutaneous B16-F1 melanoma-induced angiogenesis as assessed by tissue capillary density and microangiography was prominent in WT mice but was reduced in AT1a receptor-deficient (AT1a-/-) mice. Consequently, tumor growth rate was significantly slower, and the mouse survival rate was greater, in AT1a-/- mice than in WT mice. Tumor growth was also reduced in WT mice treated with TCV-116, a selective blocker of AT1 receptor. Because the beta-galactosidase gene was inserted into the AT1a gene locus in AT1a-/- mice, the site of beta-galactosidase expression represents the AT1a receptor expression in these mutant mice. In tumor-implanted AT1a-/- mice, the major site of the beta-galactosidase expression was macrophages in tissues surrounding tumors. Moreover, the number of infiltrated macrophages was significantly lower in AT1a-/- mice than in WT mice, and double-immunofluorescence staining revealed that these macrophages expressed VEGF protein intensively. Therefore, the host ATII-AT1 receptor pathway supports tumor-associated macrophage infiltration, which results in enhanced tissue VEGF protein levels. The host ATII-AT1 receptor pathway thereby plays important roles in tumor-related angiogenesis and growth in vivo.", 
    "131": "Effects of topical application of adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists on epidermal barrier repair rate after barrier disruption were studied. Agonists and antagonists of beta1-adrenergic receptor did not affect the barrier repair rate. On the other hand, beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists, procaterol and alprenol, delayed barrier recovery and the beta2 receptor antagonist, ICI-118551, blocked the delay. Moreover, topical application of ICI-118551 or beta1,2 receptor antagonist, clenbuterol alone accelerated barrier recovery. Antagonists of alpha1 and alpha2 receptors did not affect barrier recovery. The delay of barrier repair induced by prodaterol hydrochloride was blocked by a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, verapamil or nifedipine. In cultured human keratinocytes, procaterol increased the intracellular calcium concentration and the increase was blocked by ICI-118551 and also by verapamil or nifedipine. Topical application of ICI-118551 partially blocked the epidermal hyperplasia induced by acetone treatment under low environmental humidity. These results suggest that the beta2-adrenergic receptor is specifically associated with skin barrier homeostasis.", 
    "132": "Congenital ectopic junctional tachycardia (EJT) is a rare arrhythmia presenting in the first 6 months of life. It is often resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs and its poor prognosis (35% mortality) explains its often complex management. The authors report two cases which illustrate its unpredictability with a potential to degenerate to serious ventricular arrhythmias. The possibility of progression to atrioventricular block, increased by antiarrhythmic therapy, may lead to implantation of a cardiac pacemaker. The poor outcome of the two babies underlines the severity of these arrhythmias.", 
    "133": "The authors report the first case of adrenergic ventricular tachycardia observed in two 11 year old homozygotic twins. Syncope on exercise led to the investigation of the first twin with confirmation of the diagnosis by exercise stress testing. The same investigations led to the demonstration of the condition in the second asymptomatic twin. The two patients were treated with nadolol and there has been no recurrence of syncope with a 2 year follow-up. Adrenergic ventricular tachycardia is a rare arrhythmia with a risk of sudden death which may be prevented by betablocker therapy. An exhaustive familial inquiry is essential, but is only positive in one out of three cases. Mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene (hRyRZ) and also in the calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) have recently been reported. Progress in the understanding of the genetics of this condition should improve primary preventive measures.", 
    "134": "Propanolol and metoprolol exert adrenoceptor-independent effects including scavenging of free radicals and inhibition of protein kinase C leading to inhibition of leukocyte migration and radical release as a consequence. Whether topically used metipranolol and timolol exert such effects is unknown. Neutrophil chemotaxis was tested using modified Boyden microchemotaxis chambers. Respiratory burst activity of neutrophils was detected fluorometrically. Radical scavenging properties were tested using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Metipranolol and timolol inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis at doses in the micromolar range, oxygen free radical production triggered with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe was inhibited at higher concentration. Protein kinase C involvement, suggested to trigger free radical production with phorbol myristate acetate, was antagonized. A direct radical scavenging effect of the beta-blockers was also seen. Inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis and free radical production is a novel mode of action of metipranolol and timolol that may be relevant for beneficial effects in the topical treatment of eye disease.",

Transdermal patches of propranolol hydrochloride (PPN) were formulated employing ethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone as film formers. The pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) performance of PPN following transdermal administration was compared with that of oral administration. This study was carried out in a randomized cross-over design in male New Zealand albino rabbits. The PK parameters such as maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), time for peak plasma concentration (t(max)), mean residence time (MRT) and area under the curve (AUC(0-alpha)) were significantly (P<0.01) different following transdermal administration compared to oral administration. The terminal elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of transdermally delivered PPN was found to be similar to that following oral administration. In contrast to oral delivery, a sustained therapeutic activity was observed over a period of 24 h after transdermal administration compared to oral administration. The relative bioavailability of PPN was increased about fivefold to sixfold after transdermal administration as compared to oral delivery. This may be due to the avoidance of first pass effect of PPN. The sustained therapeutic activity was due to the controlled release of drug into systemic circulation following transdermal administration.", 
    "143": "This study was designed to examine short-term blood pressure variability (BPV) in patients with different severity and forms of chronic medically treated hypertension. Power spectral analysis of BPV was performed from continuous finger blood pressure (Finapres) recordings. Ten patients with renovascular hypertension (RVHT), 34 with severe essential hypertension (SEHT) and 29 with mild essential hypertension (MEHT) as well as healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied. The RVHT group was characterized by reduced low frequency (LF) power of both systolic and diastolic BPV (P =0.004 and P =0.003 respectively) when compared with the control group. There was also a tendency to lower total power of diastolic BPV (P =0.094). On the contrary, the SEHT group had increased total power of diastolic BPV (P =0.044). However, in the SEHT group, we found no differences in the LF and high frequency power of systolic and diastolic BPV when compared with controls. The MEHT group presented with lower LF power of systolic and diastolic BPV (P =0.028 and P =0.003 respectively) and, in addition, high frequency power of diastolic BPV was lower than in the control group (P =0.020). When the hypertensive groups were compared with each other, total power and LF power of diastolic BPV (P =0.043 and P =0.039 respectively) were lower in the RVHT group than in the SEHT group. In addition, total power of diastolic BPV was lower (P =0.030) in the MEHT group than in the SEHT group. No differences were observed in BPV between the RVHT and MEHT groups. The results show that BPV in hypertensive patients groups behaved differently. This suggests that both the aetiology and severity of hypertension have a significant influence on short-term BPV measured in laboratory conditions and that different control mechanisms are operating in these clinically distinctly different hypertension groups.",

The combination of brimonidine and latanoprost produced significantly greater mean IOP reductions at each visit in both trials.

    "145": "Although the widespread introduction of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists into the management of congestive heart failure (CHF) has led to significant improvements in morbidity and mortality, it is also apparent that clinical responses to this therapy vary substantially. With the recognition that functionally significant genetic polymorphisms of the beta2-adrenoceptor exist with clinically relevant allelic frequency, we hypothesized that beta2-adrenoceptor genotype may affect the response to carvedilol. The clinical response, influence on left ventricular function and beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2AR) genotype was determined in 80 patients treated with carvedilol. A clinically significant improvement in left ventricular function (good responder) was defined as an absolute improvement of 10% in the left ventricular ejection fraction or 5% in the fractional shortening. Consistent with studies performed in vitro on the influence of beta2AR genotype and receptor desensitization, subjects who were homozygous for the allele encoding the Gln27 polymorphism displayed a significantly lower proportion of good responders than patients who were homozygous or heterozygous for the Glu27 polymorphism (26% versus 63%, P=0.003). These data demonstrate a significant influence of beta2AR genotype in the response to carvedilol in CHF patients. Accordingly, determination of beta2AR status may be of value in the tailoring of individual therapy in patients with CHF.",

IC50 for quinidine block of basal IKs was 5.8+/-1.2 micromol/L, versus 19.9+/-3.2 micromol/L (P<0.01) for PKA-stimulated current. A similar >3-fold shift was apparent in the absence of KCNE1 and with the IKs-specific blocker chromanol 293B. The first current recorded after channels were held at rest and exposed to the drug was reduced approximately 40%, and further depolarizations increased the block with a time constant (tau) of 181+/-27 seconds. By contrast, PKA-stimulated channels displayed a <5% first-pulse block and much slower block development (tau=405+/-85 seconds). Alanine substitution at 3 potential PKA target sites (S27, S468, and T470) generated an IKs that did not increase with PKA stimulation; this mutant retained wild-type drug sensitivity that was unaffected by PKA.", 
    "148": "Activation of this key intracellular signaling pathway blunts drug block. The onset of block and the data with the PKA-resistant mutant support the concept that phosphorylation of the KCNQ1 subunit directly modulates drug access to a binding site on the channel. These data identify a novel mechanism for modulation of drug-channel interactions that may be especially important during beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "149": "In this study we evaluated the expression of five sodium channel (NaCh) Alpha-subunit genes after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in the rat and the effects of treatment with the NaCh blocker and experimental neuroprotective agent RS100642 as compared to the prototype NaCh blocker mexiletine. The expression of Na(v) 1.1, Na(v) 1.2, Na(v) 1.3, Na(v) 1.7, Na(v) 1.8 and the housekeeping gene beta-actin were studied in vehicle or drug-treated rats at 6, 24 and 48 h post-MCAo using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. RS100642 (1 mg/kg), mexiletine (10 mg/kg), or vehicle (1 ml/kg) was injected (i.v.) at 30 min, 2, 4, and 6 h post-injury. Following MCAo only the Na(v) 1.1 and Na(v) 1.2 genes were significantly down-regulated in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the injured brains. RS100642 treatment significantly reversed the down-regulation of Na(v) 1.1 (but not Na(v) 1.2) at 24-48 h post-injury. Mexiletine treatment, on the other hand, had no significant effect on the down-regulation of either gene. These findings demonstrate that treatment with a neuroprotective dose of RS100642 significantly reverses the down-regulation of Na(v) 1.1 caused by ischemic brain injury and suggests that RS100642 selectively targets the Na(v) 1.1 Alpha-subunit of the NaCh. Furthermore, our findings strengthen the hypothesis that ischemic injury may produce selective depletion of voltage-gated NaChs, and suggest that the Na(v) 1.1 NaCh Alpha-subunit may play a key role in the neuronal injury/recovery process.", 
    "150": "The involvement of G-proteins in generating the slow poststimulus afterdepolarising potential (sADP) induced by muscarinic receptor activation in immature (P10-20) rat olfactory cortical brain slice neurones was investigated under whole-cell patch clamp, using GTP-gamma-S (G-protein activator) or GDP-beta-S (G-protein blocker)-filled electrodes. In control experiments using K methylsulphate electrodes, cell resting potential (V(m)) and spike firing properties were unaffected over 10-15 min recording, although input resistance (R(N)) was slightly increased ( approximately 14%). Oxotremorine-M (OXO-M; 10 microM) produced a reversible slow depolarisation, an increase in R(N) ( approximately 90%) and induction of a slow poststimulus inward tail current (I(ADP)) (measured under voltage clamp at -60 mV) that was sustained during drug exposure (up to 15 min); the amplitude of slow inward rectifier (I(h)) currents activated from -50 mV were also apparently increased. By contrast, in GTP-gamma-S-loaded cells, R(N) was consistently decreased ( approximately 22%) and spike firing threshold (V(th)) was raised ( approximately 5 mV) after 10 min recording. In approximately 60% of loaded cells, a persistent muscarinic slow inward current and I(ADP) were induced by OXO-M; I(h) relaxation amplitude was also significantly decreased. The effects of GTP-gamma-S on R(N), V(th) and I(h) were partly counteracted by adding Ba(2+) (100 microM) to the bathing medium or mimicked by adding baclofen (GABA(B) receptor agonist; 100 microM) to normally-recorded cells. Intracellular GDP-beta-S (up to 30 min) had no effect on cell membrane properties or I(h), but irreversibly blocked the muscarinic slow inward current and I(ADP) induced by OXO-M. We conclude that both muscarinic responses require G-protein-linked transduction mechanisms for their generation.",

    "156": "When planning treatment for patients with hypertension, current guidelines emphasise the importance of risk stratification, based on blood pressure, the presence of end-organ damage and other cardiovascular risk factors. Because the beneficial effect of antihypertensive therapy seems to be linked to the degree of blood pressure reduction, guidelines recommend reducing blood pressure below 140/90mm Hg, with a lower target in patients who are young or who have diabetes mellitus (with or without nephropathy) or non-diabetic nephropathy. Blood pressure reduction can be achieved with several classes of drugs, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists and calcium channel antagonists. Calcium channel antagonists have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke and major cardiovascular events. However, it is still controversial whether different treatment regimens based on different drug classes can offer advantages beyond similar degrees of blood pressure control in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The International Nifedipine GITS Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) was a controlled clinical trial aimed at comparing the efficacy of a long-acting calcium channel antagonist, nifedipine gastrointestinal-transport-system (GITS), versus co-amilozide, a combination of the diuretics hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and amiloride, on morbidity and mortality in high-risk hypertensive patients. Nifedipine GITS and HCTZ/amiloride were equally effective at reducing blood pressure and the risk of primary outcomes (a composite of death from any cardiovascular or cerebrovascular cause, non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure). Results from other studies indicate that there may be greater benefits for stroke and smaller benefits for coronary artery disease with calcium channel antagonist-based regimens than with diuretic or beta-blocker-based regimens. However, there is at present insufficient evidence to recommend a specific drug choice based on patient risk profile. Thus, the choice of antihypertensive drug(s) should be according to efficacy and tolerability. In addition to the reductions in cardiovascular risk, two substudies of INSIGHT showed that nifedipine GITS was able to prevent the progression of intima media thickness in the common carotid artery and slow the progression of coronary calcification. The clinical significance of this effect in the prevention of cardiovascular events still remains to be established.",

Although a large number of options exist within each class, by considering the above factors, the choice is narrowed to only 1-2 preferred options. These drugs should then be added to the P- or Personal-drug list. By only prescribing agents on the P-drug list, the prescriber will become more familiar with their closing, adverse effects, and interactions, resulting in improved patient outcomes. Also when a new drug becomes available, it clearly needs to be better for the patient in terms of these factors, before it is added to the P-drug list.",

    "161": "Cardiovascular complications are the major cause of perioperative and late morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing major vascular surgery. This is related to the frequent presence of underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD may be asymptomatic because of reduced exercise capacity due to pre-existing non-cardiac conditions like stroke or claudication. Careful preoperative evaluation of CAD and perioperative management with beta-blockers and statins may offer the physician a unique opportunity to improve patients' perioperative and long-term outcome.", 
    "162": "The role of noradrenergic neurotransmission was analyzed in striatal cholinergic interneurons. Conventional intracellular and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made of cholinergic interneurons in rat brain slice preparations. Bath-applied noradrenaline (NA) (1-300 microm) dose-dependently induced both an increase in the spontaneous firing activity and a membrane depolarization of the recorded cells. In voltage-clamped neurons, an inward current was induced by NA. This effect was not prevented by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, whereas it was mimicked by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol and blocked by the beta1 antagonists propranolol and betaxolol. Interestingly, forskolin, activator of adenylate cyclase, mimicked and occluded the membrane depolarization obtained at saturating doses of both dopamine and NA. Accordingly, SQ22,536, a selective adenylate cyclase inhibitor, reduced the response to NA. Analysis of the reversal potential of the NA-induced current did not provide homogeneous results, indicating the involvement of multiple membrane conductances. Because cAMP is known to modulate Ih, the effects of ZD7288, a selective inhibitor of Ih current, were examined on the NA-induced membrane depolarization/inward current. ZD7288 mostly reduced the response to NA. However, both KT-5720 and H-89, selective protein kinase A (PKA) blockers, failed to prevent the excitatory action of NA. Likewise, calphostin C, antagonist of PKC, genistein, inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, and 8-Bromo-cGMP, blocker of PKG, did not affect the response to NA. Finally, double-labeling experiments combining beta1-adrenoceptor and choline acetyltransferase immunocytochemistry by means of confocal microscopy revealed a strong beta1-adrenoceptor labeling on cholinergic interneurons. We conclude that NA depolarizes striatal cholinergic interneurons via beta1-adrenoceptor activation, through a cAMP-dependent but PKA-independent mechanism.", 
    "163": "The effects of long-term cold exposure on muscle and liver mitochondrial oxygen consumption in hypothyroid and normal rats were examined. Thyroid ablation was performed after 8-wk acclimation to 4 degrees C. Hypothyroid and normal controls remained in the cold for an additional 8 wk. At the end of 16-wk cold exposure, all hypothyroid rats were alive and normothermic and had normal body weight. At ambient temperature (24 degrees C), thyroid ablation induced a 65% fall in muscle mitochondrial oxygen consumption, which was reversed by thyroxine but not by norepinephrine administration. After cold acclimation was reached, suppression of thyroid function reduced muscle mitochondrial respiration by 30%, but the hypothyroid values remained about threefold higher than those in hypothyroid muscle in the warm. Blockade of beta- and alpha1-adrenergic receptors in both hypothyroid and normal rats produced hypothermia in vivo and a fall in muscle, liver, and brown adipose tissue mitochondria respiration in vitro. In normal rats, cold acclimation enhanced muscle respiration by 35%, in liver 18%, and in brown adipose tissue 450% over values in the warm. The results demonstrate that thyroid hormones, in the presence of norepinephrine, are major determinants of thermogenic activity in muscle and liver of cold-acclimated rats. After thyroid ablation, cold-induced nonshivering thermogenesis replaced 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine-induced thermogenesis, and normal body temperature was maintained.", 
    "164": "The G-protein G(salpha) exists in three isoforms, the G(salpha) splice variants G(salphashort) (G(salphaS)) and G(salphalong) (G(salphaL)), and the G-protein G(alphaolf) that is not only involved in olfactory signaling but also in extrapyramidal motor regulation. Studies with beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)AR)-G(salpha) fusion proteins showed that G(salpha) proteins activate adenylyl cyclase (AC) in the order of efficacy G(salphaS)>G(salphaL) approximately G(alphaolf) and that G(salpha) proteins confer the hallmarks of constitutive activity to the beta(2)AR in the order of efficacy G(salphaL)>G(alphaolf)>G(salphaS). However, it is unclear whether such differences between G(salpha) proteins also exist in the nonfused state. In the present study, we co-expressed the beta(2)AR and dopamine D(1)-receptor (D(1)R) with G(salpha) proteins at different ratios in Sf9 insect cells. In agreement with the fusion protein studies, nonfused G(alphaolf) was less efficient than nonfused G(salphaS) and G(salphaL) at activating AC, but otherwise, we did not observe differences between the three G(salpha) isoforms. Thus, it is much easier to dissect differences between G(salpha) isoforms using beta(2)AR-G(salpha) fusion proteins than nonfused G(salpha) isoforms.",

The presented study shows how only by using an additional isocratic pump, a second column and a 10-port valve the throughput is twice of that of a conventional single column system with the same sensitivity. Analytes and matrix were separated and eluting peaks of the first column were detected while the second column was equilibrated.

    "166": "Authors present comparison of the previous results on the influence of free amino acids of the aqueous humor in rabbits and human on the pH of the aqueous humor in vitro. Four clinically used antiglaucomatics were added (2% Trusopt--pH 5.33; 0,005% Xalatan--pH 6.4; 0.5% Timoptol--pH 6.80 and 1% Pilocarpine--pH 5.87) into the aquired aqueous humor of rabbits (pH 7.59) and human (pH 7.11 +/- 0.11). After their instillation pH of the aqueous humor immediately decreased towards acid levels. The pH changes after Timoptol, Xalatan and Pilocarpine showed a similar time pattern and after return to the baseline values the pH shifted to alkaline levels. In case of Trusopt instillation the pH value reached the baseline of the aqueous humor after 240 min. Almost no pH changes were recorded from 240 min up to 24 hours after all tested antiglaucomatics. From the wiev on the speed of activity and effectivity depending on time required to reach the initial pH value of the aqueous humor we to make this order: Pilocarpine>Timoptol>Xalatan>Trusopt. Comparing our results the effect of antiglaucomatics is connected with different composition and also with shift of the aqueous humor pH towards slightly alkaline level (similar effect in rabbits and human). Results presented in this work are theoretical but also practical contribution to the treatment of glaucoma. (Fig. 1, Ref. 38.).", 
    "167": "Migraine is a paroxysmal disorder with attacks of headache, nausea, vomiting, photo- and phonophobia and malaise. This review summarises new treatment options both for the therapy of the acute attack as well as for migraine prophylaxis. Analgesics like aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in treating migraine attacks. Few controlled trials were performed for the use of ergotamine or dihydroergotamine. These trials indicate inferior efficacy compared to serotonin (5-HT)1B/D-agonists (further on called \"triptans\"). The triptans (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan) are highly effective. They improve headache as well as nausea, photo- and phonophobia. The different triptans have minor differences in efficacy, headache recurrence and adverse effects. The knowledge of their different pharmacological profile allows a more specific treatment of the individual migraine characteristics. Migraine prophylaxis is recommended, when more than 3 attacks occur per month, if attacks do not respond to acute treatment or if side effects of acute treatment are severe. Substances with proven efficacy include the beta-blockers metoprolol and propranolol, the calcium channel blocker flunarizine, several 5-HT antagonists and amitriptyline. Recently antiepileptic drugs (valproic acid, gabapentin, topiramate) were evaluated for the prophylaxis of migraine. The use of botulinum-toxin is under investigation.",

    "169": "Numerous recent investigations on the development and morphology of atherosclerotic lesions have shown programmed cell death or apoptosis to be an important factor in atherogenesis. Enzymes known as caspases are essential for completion of the apoptotic program. With regard to the origin of signals inducing apoptosis, there are two ways of initiating caspase activation: (a) cellular death receptor-mediated activation; and (b) activation mediated by mitochondrial permeability and expression of the p53 oncogene. Both of these pathways are involved in atherogenesis. Oxidative stress, angiotensin II and cholesterol overload are the primary factors that induce apoptosis in vascular cells. Considering apoptosis in endothelial cells, exposed phosphatidylserine on the cell membrane activates thrombin increasing the probability of arterial thromboses. Further progression of atherosclerosis is promoted by the formation of apoptotic bodies with oxidized phospholipids exposed on the membrane; these also activate adhesion of monocytes. Apoptosis of smooth muscle cells is usually observed in the fibrous portion of an atherosclerotic plaque in which the cells produce collagen important for plaque stability. As apoptosis occurs in smooth muscle cells, the fibrous cap grows thinner. This can result in both plaque rupture, formation of thrombi as well as calcification of the plaque from apoptotic smooth muscle cells remnants. Smooth muscle cells apoptosis is beneficial in that it offers protection to the walls of arteries against proliferative restenosis induced by invasive procedures. Apoptosis of macrophages contributes to the formation and progression of the lipidic core and promotes thrombosis of atherosclerosis in damaged arteries. By contrast, apoptosis of macrophages diminishes the production of matrix methaloproteinases that decompose collagen fibers. New facts concerning the effects of antioxidants (selenium, vitamin C and vitamin E), inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, beta-blockers, calcium chanel blockers, and statins are also considered in this review."
