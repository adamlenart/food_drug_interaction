    "0": "Maternal and fetal responses to i.v. admission of propranolol (4 mg/4 min) were investigated in 10 'steady-state' sheep experiments performed on 5 ewes and their fetuses at 101-128 days of gestation. Observations were made at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 120 min from the start of infusion. Transient decrease in fetal heart rate (p less than 0.05) was observed at 15 min, accompanied by fetal acidosis, which persisted throughout the experiment. Mean fetal pCO2 increased significantly at 5, 15 (p less than 0.025) and 75 min (p less than 0.05). Fetal pO2 decreased at 15 min (p less than 0.025). Oxygen saturation (O2%) decreased at 15 (p less than 0.001) and 60 min (p less than 0.025). Concomitant decreases in O2 content were noted at 15 (p less than 0.005), 30 (p less than 0.05), 60 (p less than 0.025) and 90 min (p less than 0.05). Mean fetal base excess decreased at 30 min (p less than 0.05). Mean maternal heart rate decreased at 15 (p less than 0.010) and 30 min (p less than 0.005), followed by an increase at 75 (p less than 0.05) and 90 min (p less than 0.05). Mean uterine blood flow remained unchanged during infusion and up to 90 min. However, it increased at 105 (p less than 0.025) and 120 min (p less than 0.05). It is suggested that propranolol causes definite fetal adverse effects and its usage during pregnancy must be limited to absolutely indicated situations.", 
    "1": "4 children, ages 11-14 years, were diagnosed as having primary ventricular arrhythmias (3 ventricular tachycardia, 1 multifocal premature ventricular contractions) without underlying heart disease. All 4 patients were treated initially with standard antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, propranolol, procainamide) and either did not respond (3 patients) or experienced drug toxicity (quinidine - 1 patient) necessitating withdrawal of antiarrhythmic therapy. Amiodarone, a new antiarrhythmic agent, was initiated in a single oral daily dose of 10 mg/kg/day. All patients have shown a significant clinical response to oral amiodarone with either complete suppression of ventricular tachycardia in 2 patients, near complete suppression in 1 and abolition of multifocal premature ventricular contractions in the fourth patients. 2 patients have had corneal microdeposits detected by slitlamp examination and are receiving methylcellulose eye drops; no other adverse reactions have been encountered during the follow-up of 6 months to 3 years.", 
    "2": "Plasma protein binding of one acidic drug, cloxacillin, and one basic drug, alprenolol, was determined by equilibrium dialysis at +37 degrees C during pregnancy and the 1st postnatal week in 12 women and their newborn infants and in 7 nonpregnant women (controls). A significant increase in fraction free cloxacillin in maternal plasma occurred during pregnancy already from the 2nd trimester compared to the controls (p less than 0.01) and was most pronounced at delivery (median values 0.126 and 0.069, respectively). A similarly increased fraction free cloxacillin was found in cord blood (median value 0.108) which further increased during the 1st postnatal week (range 0.112-0.164). In maternal plasma the binding capacity returned to the values of the controls during the same time period. The binding of cloxacillin was significantly correlated with the concentration of albumin (p less than 0.01). High correlation was also found between binding of the basic drug alprenolol and concentration of orosomucoid (p less than 0.005). This was most obvious in the newborn infants with low concentrations (range 0.1-0.3 g/l) and in the mothers during the puerperium with high concentrations of orosomucoid (range 0.7-2.5 g/l). On the basis of plasma protein binding data in the mother and her child, a maternal to fetal plasma concentration ratio was calculated. For cloxacillin this ratio was close to unity (1.03), while it was significantly above unity for alprenolol (1.72). At equilibrium, therefore, the total plasma concentration of alprenolol in the mother can be expected to exceed the concentration in her infant.", 
    "3": "Eighteen patients with idiopathic hypertension were studied to assess the anti-hypertensive control, both at rest and during exercise of increasing doses of hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol and a combination of hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol. Each active treatment period was given for four weeks with an intervening four week placebo period, with assessments made at 2 to 4 hours and 22 to 24 hours following tablet intake. The results show that the resting systolic and diastolic values for all active treatment periods were significantly different from placebo. During exercise, the systolic blood pressure levels were significantly reduced by all active treatments with the greatest overall reduction being achieved by either metoprolol or the metoprolol-hydrochlorothiazide combination. However, the exercise induced increase in systolic blood pressure was reduced by approximately 25% by both metoprolol and the combination product, when compared to placebo, but not by the diuretic alone.", 
    "4": "Seventy-two patients with acute alcoholic delirium were examined cliniconeurophysiologically. The Athena scale, neurovegetative indices as well as those of adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and DOPA excretion were used for delirium gravity estimation. Proceeding from these data an attempt was made to use the beta-blocking agent obsidan for combined delirium treatment. The data obtained allow using the pathogenetic drugs for differentiated search of delirium treatment. Application of obsidan, an agent blocking hyperactivity of central adrenergic mechanisms in abortive and typical delirium promoted the removal of affective disorders, normalized hemodynamics and prevented early exhaustion of adrenergic mechanisms. Thus, obsidan produces favorable therapeutic effects when used in a complex of measures for alcoholic delirium treatment.", 
    "5": "In this study, we have investigated the importance of partial agonist activity during myocardial ischemia by comparing the effects of equiblocking doses of oxprenolol, which possesses partial agonist activity, to propranolol which does not. In the isolated, globally ischemic (low-flow) rat heart, when propranolol or oxprenolol was added alone during the ischemic period, only propranolol reduced enzyme leakage relative to control. However, when the hearts were perfused (10 min) prior to ischemia with these drugs, both beta blockers caused a significant reduction in enzyme leakage. Under conditions of enhanced sympathetic drive (in the presence of 0.01 microM isoproterenol), both beta blockers reduced enzyme leakage to differing extents. In hearts with low sympathetic drive (reserpine pretreatment), enzyme leakage was unaffected by propranolol and exacerbated by oxprenolol. The results of this study suggest that oxprenolol and propranolol influence ischemic damage to differing extents and that this difference is due to partial agonist activity. Also, the protective action of all beta-blocking compounds depends greatly on the background level of sympathetic drive.", 
    "6": "Earlier studies in our laboratory (23) showed evidence of dose-related acute injury to the myocardium after exposure of rats to ionizing radiation. Biochemical, histological, and electrocardiographic parameters were studied. In further continuation of this study, the effects of intervention by pretreatment with propranolol (10 mg/kg body weight) and hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg body weight) have been studied. The above drugs were administered to male albino rats weighing 150 to 200 g 30 min before exposure to 6000-rad single-dose gamma radiation over the precordial area. The parameters observed were cardiac glycogen, serum enzymes, lactate, pyruvate, blood sugar, adrenal ascorbic acid, and histology of the myocardium. The beneficial effects of this procedure are discussed.", 
    "7": "In the present study, the effects of morphine and pethidine on coronary vessel resistance (CPP), blood pressure (BP), and experimental myocardial infarction-induced cardiac arrhythmia were investigated. Both morphine and pethidine induced a fall in CPP and BP and inhibited the cardiac arrhythmia. The morphine effects on CPP and BP were largely blocked by mepyramine. The effects of pethidine, on the other hand, were not blocked by mepyramine, propranolol, or atropine. An interesting dose dependent inhibition of cardiac arrhythmia was observed with pethidine.", 
    "8": "Pharmacokinetics of acebutolol have been studied in hypertensive aged patients (79.4 +/- 3.8 years) and in young healthy subjects (23.4 +/- 0.7 years) after intravenous (0.35 mg/kg bolus) and oral administration (400 mg). Acebutolol and diacetolol, the main metabolite, plasma levels were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. After intravenous administration, apparent volume of distribution (1.5 vs. 2.4 liter . kg-1, p less than 0.05) and total body clearance (6.2 vs. 8.8 ml . min-1 . kg-1, n.s.) of acebutolol are smaller in elderly than in young men. After oral administration, maximum plasma levels (28.03 vs. 9.68 micrograms . l-1 . kg-1) and area under the curve (163.1 vs. 57.5 micrograms . l-1 . h . kg-1) are significantly higher in aged patients than in young subjects (p less than 0.001). Acebutolol and diacetolol plasma half-lives increase in elderly patients (11.6 vs. 7.2 h and 14.8 vs. 12 h respectively). These results suggest a possible accumulation of acebutolol and diacetolol in elderly.", 
    "9": "The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated in 58 open-chest anaesthetised dogs; 23 were controls, 15 were given intravenous propranolol 1 mg . kg-1 before and at 6 h intervals after coronary ligation, nine had bilateral cervical vagal nerve stimulation (VS) before and for 4 to 6 h after coronary ligation, and 11 had both VS and propranolol. None of the 20 dogs undergoing VS developed ventricular fibrillation within the first hour after coronary ligation compared to nine of the remaining 38 (P less than 0.05). Compared to controls, myocardial creatine kinase (CK) depletion in the epicardial layer of the infarct centre measured 24 h after coronary ligation was significantly less in the groups treated separately with vagal nerve stimulation and propranolol. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) measured at 15 min after coronary ligation was reduced to the normal myocardium by the interventions, but was unchanged at the infarct centre. Severely ischaemic myocardium (MBF less than or equal to 20% of normal) was better protected by the interventions than was moderately ischaemic myocardium. At 15 min after coronary ligation, the heart rate--blood pressure product (RPP) was reduced compared with controls by propranolol (18% reduction, P less than 0.05), reduced more by vagal stimulation (by 37%, P less than 0.001) and still more by vagal stimulation with propranolol (by 43%, P less than 0.001). Preservation of CK in myocardium with MBF less than or equal to 20% of normal was improved by VS and propranolol given separately roughly in proportion to reduction in RPP, but further reduction in RPP by VS and propranolol together did not improve CK levels further. We conclude that there may be an optimum level of indices of oxygen demand for preservation of very ischaemic myocardium in experimental infarction.", 
    "10": "The apex ejecting isolated rat heart perfused with media containing 3 X 10(-5) mol . litre-1 adriamycin for 40 min demonstrated the following changes in contraction patterns: (a) a ten-fold increase in end-diastolic pressure; (b) a 45% decrease in developed pressure; (c) a 17% decrease in coronary flow; (d) a 27% increase in time to peak pressure; (e) a 26% increase in time for pressure to fall 50% during relaxation; and (f) a 65% decrease in maximum (+) and (-) dP/dt. In rats pretreated 1 h before death, verapamil, propranolol, and hydralazine significantly attenuated the cardiac depression produced by adriamycin. The combinations of verapamil and hydralazine, or propranolol and hydralazine were especially efficacious. Particularly striking was the protection afforded against an increase in diastolic pressure. Digoxin pretreatment afforded no protection. It is postulated that the acute depressive effects of adriamycin may be related to calcium overload.", 
    "11": "Broad-breasted white male turkeys develop hypertension, tachycardia and aortic arteriosclerosis spontaneously by approximately 5 weeks of age. When fed B-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), aortic tensile strengths are lowered, and a high percentage of the turkeys die from aortic dissecting aneurysms. There are essentially no deaths from aneurysms when either dl-propranolol or reserpine is fed in concert with BAPN; practolol and soltalol partially protect the BAPN-fed turkey from lethal aneurysms while hydralazine and phenelzine sulphate potentiate mortality from aneurysms. Dl-propranolol decreases and reserpine increases dP/dtmax and both drugs lower arterial pressure and heart rate when fed with BAPN. Such diets also decrease the ultrastructural disarray of collagenous and elastic fibres in the media of the abdominal aorta that occurs from the feeding of BAPN and thereby raise aortic tensile strength. Sotalol and practolol when fed to BAPN-fed turkeys lower blood pressure and dP/dtmax, but neither drug affects aortic tensile strength and both counteract the deleterious effect of BAPN on the ultrastructure of collagenous and elastic fibres to a minor degree. Phenelzine sulphate does not affect arterial pressure while hydralazine reduces arterial pressure; both drugs decrease aortic tensile strength and increase the ultrastructural disruption of aortic elastin and collagen in the BAPN turkey. The results suggest that dl-propranolol, reserpine, phenelzine sulphate, and hydralazine have an action on aortic tissue and indicate the usefulness of the BAPN-fed turkey as a model for identifying potential drug effects on aortic elastin and collagen.", 
    "12": "1 Increases in heart rate and forearm blood flow following graded intravenous bolus injections of isoprenaline sulphate, were measured in a double-blind randomised study of six subjects who received either placebo, practolol 50 mg, practolol 200 mg, propranolol 10 mg or propranolol 40 mg. 2 Dose related increases in forearm blood flow were produced by the graded boluses of isoprenaline sulphate. 3 Practolol 50 mg attenuated the heart rate response to isoprenaline but did not significantly affect the changes in forearm blood flow. Practolol 200 mg further attenuated the heart rate responses but also decreased the forearm blood flow responses. 4 Propranolol 10 mg and propranolol 40 mg significantly attenuated both the heart rate and forearm blood flow responses. The effect on forearm blood flow tended to be greater than the effect on heart rate. 5 Practolol 200 mg had the same effect on heart rate responses as propranolol 10 mg but a significantly smaller effect on the forearm blood flow responses. 6 The measurement of forearm blood flow following intravenous bolus injections of isoprenaline provides useful information about the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonism of propranolol and practolol. However, application of the technique may be limited by the magnitude of the heart rate response and by the short-lived nature of the increase in forearm blood flow.", 
    "13": "1 Differences in ability to attenuate isoprenaline tachycardia between the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol and the non-selective drug propranolol, when administered in equivalent anti-exercise tachycardia oral doses, were measured in four normal volunteers. 2 Propranolol at all dose comparisons showed a greater potency in antagonism of isoprenaline tachycardia than atenolol; this ranged from 6 at the lowest doses (40 and 50 mg respectively) to 13 at the highest doses (320 and 400 mg respectively). 3 After doses of each drug which produced equal inhibition of exercise tachycardia, isoprenaline induced a greater increase in heart rate and greater decrease in diastolic blood pressure after pre-treatment with atenolol than after propranolol. 4 The contribution of this isoprenaline induced vasodilatation to the reduced tachycardia response, 1 h after 25 mg oral atenolol, was measured in the same four subjects by correction of the hypotension with an intravenous angiotensin infusion. Reversal by angiotensin of the 17 mm Hg average fall in diastolic blood pressure during the sustained isoprenaline infusion did not reduce the tachycardia. 5 The hypotension that results from isoprenaline stimulation of unblocked vasodilator beta 2-adrenoceptors in normal subjects pre-treated with atenolol appears to make a negligible contribution to the tachycardia response and does not explain the different abilities of cardioselective and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs to antagonise isoprenaline tachycardia. Our results are compatible with the presence of beta 2-adrenoceptors in human atria.", 
    "14": "Local (reduction of intraocular pressure) and systemic (inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia) effects of 1% and 0.25% pindolol eye drops have been studied in a balanced cross-over double-blind trial in 12 healthy volunteers. Both concentrations produced a comparable reduction in intraocular pressure while the inhibition of exercise tachycardia was significantly less with the lower concentration.", 
    "15": "In a minority of conscious sheep, the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response is blunted (\"nonresponders\"). The purpose of this investigation was to determine if this blunted response is related to an increased activity of H2-histamine receptors, beta-adrenergic receptors, or the generation of inhibitory prostaglandins. We measured pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, and pulmonary blood flow for the calculation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in 5 \"nonresponders\" and 5 sheep with a typical hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response (\"responders\") while breathing room air and 13% O2 (balance, N2). Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) was also determined as a measure of the severity of hypoxia. During hypoxia, mean PVR increased by 6% (p = NS) in the \"nonresponders\" (PaO2, 49 +/- 4 mmHg), and by 70% (p less than 0.01) in the \"responders\" (mean PaO2, 46 +/- 4 mmHg). Metiamide (H2-blocker) and propranolol (beta-adrenergic blocker) pretreatments did not restore the hypoxic pulmonary vascular response in the \"nonresponders,\" whereas pretreatment with indomethacin (prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor) caused mean PVR to increase by 48% (p less than 0.01) during hypoxia, indicating a partial restoration of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. In the \"responders,\" the hypoxic pulmonary vascular response was not potentiated by indomethacin pretreatment (68% increase in mean PVR). We conclude that some sheep exhibit a blunted hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response caused by enhanced production of inhibitory prostaglandins.", 
    "16": "The effect of renal nerve stimulation (RNS) on renal venous outflow and urinary excretion of endogenous norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine was examined in anesthetized dogs. In the unstimulated denervated kidney, there was a negative venoarterial concentration difference for all catecholamines. Low-level RNS (LLRNS) caused small changes in renal hemodynamics and renal venous outflow of dopamine and increased norepinephrine outflow by 3.22 +/- 0.95 pmol X min-1 X g-1 (n = 5, P less than 0.05). High-level RNS (HLRNS) reduced renal blood flow by 50% and increased renal venous outflow of norepinephrine and dopamine by 9.58 +/- 0.67 and 0.46 +/- 0.05 pmol X min-1 X g-1, respectively (n = 27, P less than 0.01 for both). Renal uptake of epinephrine was unchanged by HLRNS. The urinary excretion of norepinephrine but not dopamine was increased to a similar degree following RNS at both levels. HLRNS caused a similar increase of the urinary norepinephrine excretion from the contralateral denervated and unstimulated kidney. This could be explained by the increase in arterial norepinephrine (from 0.74 +/- 0.08 to 1.20 +/- 0.14 nM, P less than 0.01) caused by HLRNS as shown by experiments with intravenous infusions of norepinephrine. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine counteracted the hemodynamic response to HLRNS and enhanced the renal venous outflow and urinary excretion of norepinephrine and dopamine. Our results indicate that renal nerves release dopamine as well as norepinephrine and that urinary catecholamine excretion is a poor indicator of intrarenal catecholamine release.", 
    "17": "Quinidine was evaluated during serial electrophysiologic testing with programmed ventricular stimulation in 89 patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. In 30 of the 89 patients, quinidine therapy prevented the initiation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) during programmed ventricular stimulation. In 8 additional patients no single drug tested was effective, and quinidine in combination with either mexiletine (7 patients) or propranolol (1 patient) prevented the initiation of VT during electrophysiologic testing. The mean serum concentrations of quinidine in the patients who responded and those who failed to respond were 2.9 +/- 0.8 and 2.8 +/- 1.1 micrograms/ml, respectively; however, but nonresponders were characterized by more severe congestive heart failure and an increased incidence of digitalis use. During chronic therapy (24 +/- 3 months) with quinidine either alone or in combination with a second antiarrhythmic drug in the 38 patients whose arrhythmia had been suppressed during electrophysiologic testing, 32 (84%) remain symptom-free while 3 have had recurrent arrhythmia and 3 discontinued quinidine because of adverse effects. These data demonstrate that quinidine, when selected on the basis of electrophysiologic testing, provides effective long-term prophylaxis against recurrent ventricular arrhythmia and that approximately 40% of patients tested are likely to respond either to quinidine alone or quinidine in combination with another antiarrhythmic agent.", 
    "18": "Forty-five patients survived a cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed with the patients taking no antiarrhythmic medications. Sustained VT was induced in 26 patients (58%) and nonsustained VT in 8 (18%). With treatment aimed at the underlying heart disease (plus empiric antiarrhythmic therapy in 2 patients), the 11 patients who had no inducible VT have had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or cardiac arrest over a follow-up period of 19 +/- 9 months (mean +/- standard deviation). Conventional antiarrhythmic drugs suppressed the induction of VT and were used for chronic treatment in 9 of 34 patients (26%) with inducible VT. Three of these 9 patients had recurrent VT or sudden death, whereas 6 have had no recurrence over follow-up of 20 +/- 7 months. In the 25 of 34 patients in whom the induction of VT was not suppressed by conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, 23 were treated with amiodarone (daily dose 550 +/- 120 mg), and 2 underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with either aneurysmectomy or map-directed endocardial resection. One of the latter 2 patients died suddenly 12 months after surgery. Among the 23 patients treated with amiodarone, 2 had fatal VT or sudden death and 21 (91%) did not, over 18 +/- 14 months of follow-up. In survivors of a cardiac arrest, the chief value of electrophysiologic testing is in identifying patients without inducible VT, who appear to have a low risk of recurrent sudden death with treatment directed at the underlying heart disease. Serial electropharmacologic testing with conventional antiarrhythmic drugs is disappointing, with a low incidence of arrhythmia suppression.", 
    "19": "Left ventricular function was evaluated with rest and supine bicycle exercise-multigated blood pool scans in 53 patients who had previously undergone coronary angiography for evaluation of a chest pain syndrome. There were 21 normal patients (less than 25% stenosis in any coronary artery, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure less than or equal to 12 mm Hg, and normal left ventriculography) and 32 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (greater than 50% narrowing in 1 or more major coronary arteries). Thirty-two (60%) were receiving propranolol at the time of the study. The normal patient group had a significant increase in mean ejection fraction (EF) during exercise (+0.08 +/- 0.09), while the CAD group had no increase (0 +/- 0.11; p less than 0.05). Mean end-systolic volume decreased significantly in the normal group (-5 +/- 8 ml/m2) but demonstrated no significant change in the CAD group (1 +/- 12 ml/m2; p less than 0.05 compared with normal patients). There was no significant change in mean end-diastolic volume in either group. Mean ejection rate, mean peak systolic pressure/end-systolic volume ratio, and mean pulmonary blood volume ratio also differed in the normal versus CAD patients. Despite mean differences, there was considerable overlap in both groups of individual EF responses: 8 of 21 (38%) of the normal group did not have an increase in EF of 0.05 with exercise, while 15 of 32 (47%) of the CAD group did have an increase in EF of 0.05 with exercise. However, the addition of peak systolic pressure/end-systolic volume ratio and pulmonary blood volume (exercise/rest) ratio improved the sensitivity for detecting CAD from 53 to 84% without adversely affecting specificity. Thus, there is a wide spectrum of left ventricular EF responses to supine exercise. In our patient population, EF alone was an insensitive and nonspecific marker of CAD. The addition of other parameters of global left ventricular function, which may be generated using radionuclide angiography, helps distinguish patients with CAD from normal subjects.", 
    "20": "The microelectrophysiologic effects of d,l-propranolol were observed to be biphasic when a wide range of concentrations was used in canine atrial tissue; therefore, the 2 isomers were used separately to test the hypothesis that the opposite effects of propranolol could be separated by isomeric isolation. Whole atria were detached from dog hearts and 3 by 0.5 cm strips were cut from the atria. Transmembrane action potentials were monitored from the atrial strips mounted in an isolation chamber containing Tyrode's solution. Concentrations of d-propranolol, l-propranolol, and the d,l-racemate ranging from 0.03 to 1.0 micrograms/ml were added to the bath and the effects observed for 60 minutes. In lower concentrations d,l-propranolol decreased the effective refractory period and activation time while increasing maximal rise velocity, action potential amplitude, and resting membrane potential. Higher concentrations produced the opposite effects. The l-isomer produced effects very similar to those of the lower concentrations of the racemate, whereas the d-form mimicked those effects of the higher concentrations of the racemic mixture. We conclude that d,l-propranolol is capable of exerting 2 opposite electropharmacologic actions, which may be demonstrated by varying the concentration of d,l-propranolol or by separating the isomers.", 
    "21": "The effect of propranolol on global and segmental left ventricular function at rest and after postextrasystolic potentiation was studied in 12 patients with chest pain. Heart rate was controlled with atrial pacing, and left ventricular cineangiograms were performed before and after 0.15 mg/kg of propranolol. During each ventriculogram a premature ventricular stimulus was introduced by means of a programmed stimulator. Propranolol decreased global left ventricular ejection fraction from 64 +/- 4.5 to 58 +/- 4.6 (p less than 0.03). Postextrasystolic potentiated global ejection fraction was not affected by propranolol (78 +/- 3.5 vs 73.6 +/- 3.4; p = NS). The area ejection fraction of the anteroapical region was decreased after propranolol (64 +/- 4.8 vs 52 +/- 6.5; p less than 0.01); however, the postextrasystolic potentiated area ejection fraction was not affected by propranolol (78 +/- 2.6 vs 71 +/- 4.6; p = NS). Frame by frame analysis of the ventriculograms demonstrated that propranolol depressed global and segmental left ventricular function by affecting the second one-third ejection fraction without influencing the first or third one-third ejection fraction. Propranolol has a small depressant effect on global and segmental left ventricular function in patients with coronary artery disease. Postextrasystolic potentiated global and segmental left ventricular function and early systolic ejection phase indices are not altered by propranolol and therefore may be useful in assessing left ventricular function in patients with coronary artery disease who are taking propranolol.", 
    "22": "This article describes the effects of chronically administered phenobarbital (180 mg/day p.o.) in dogs on the bioavailability of single 40-mg oral doses of propranolol and on the pharmacokinetics and the patterns of propranolol metabolism in urine after both oral (40 mg) and i.v. (6 mg) doses. Phenobarbital decreased the bioavailability of propranolol from 7.7 to 3.5%. By using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technique, the quantitative metabolic pattern of i.v. propranolol was unaltered by phenobarbital, but increases in hydroxylation and induction of new metabolites were observed for oral propranolol after phenobarbital treatment. Chronic phenobarbital treatment led to significant decreases in the half-lives of propranolol after both i.v. and oral doses. Little change was observed in the hepatic blood flow, systemic clearance or intrinsic oral clearance. These data demonstrate the completely nonrestrictive elimination of propranolol. With phenobarbital, both the extent of plasma protein binding and the distribution into erythrocytes change significantly, yet the overall clearance remains unaltered. The half-lives fell in responses to the binding-induced reduction in the apparent volume of distribution.", 
    "23": "The biosynthesis and metabolism of phospholipids and neutral glycerides were studied in the bovine retina. Radioactive glycerol was used as a precursor. Phentolamine and d- and dl-propranolol were found to produce similar effects on lipid metabolism in the retina. Marked stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PhI) synthesis and maximal inhibition of phosphatidylcholine (PhC), diacylglycerol (DG), and triacylglycerol (TG) formation were observed within 5 min after exposure to 0.5 mM dl-propranolol. Pulse-chase experiments showed a high turnover rate in DG and a reversibility of the propranolol-induced changes produced during the synthesis of PhC, TG, DG, monoacylglycerol (MG), and phosphatidylserine. All reversals of the drug-induced biosynthetic profiles approached control values 60 min after incubation in drug-free medium. However, complete reversal was not achieved in any of the cases under these conditions. Propranolol appeared to inhibit both the formation of DG from phosphatidic acid and the further metabolism of DG, probably to MG. Phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis showed some recovery from this inhibition. Synthesis of PhI was greatly stimulated by preincubation with propranolol and was further enhanced by reincubation in the presence of propranolol. However, this effect was not reversed by reincubation without the drug. The active de novo biosynthesis of retinal phospholipids and glycerides is a very dynamic pathway that may be redirected by amphiphilic drugs. In addition, the partial reversal of modifications induced in the flux of [2-3H]glycerol through the lipids can occur during short-term reincubations of retinas in drug-free medium.", 
    "24": "The onset of essential hypertension early in life is indicated by the high tracking of blood pressure during adolescence; intervention in adults with mild hypertension has been found successful. How, then, can high blood pressure levels in children be modified to prevent early hypertensive cardiovascular disease in adulthood? In an entire biracial town (population 9000) we surveyed 1604 (89%) of all children aged 8--18 years for blood pressure and reexamined those in the upper decile of mean blood pressure (for each race, sex, and height) on three additional occasions. On each examination nine blood pressures were taken by trained observers. All children consistently in the top decile were randomly allocated into either a treatment (n = 50) or comparison (n = 50) group. These two groups and an additional midrange blood pressure comparison group (n = 50) were followed regularly using school facilities including community and school programs. Treatment consisted of 1) dietary guidance; 2) modifications of school lunches and snacks with healthy substitutes; 3) parental involvement; 4) a low dose diuretic and beta-antagonist given by usual standards. All study groups were monitored for blood pressure in a blind manner. In 6 months of observation, blood pressure in the treatment group remained 5 and 3 mm Hg (systolic and diastolic) less than controls (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01). An orchestrated community-wide attack on early-stage hypertension is feasible and seems to offer exciting potential for prevention of early hypertensive disease.", 
    "25": "Studies of cardiac performance in hypertension have often been restricted to cardiac output determinations, although the latter alone are inadequate for that purpose. To define the range of cardiac performance in hypertension, the response of left ventricular filling pressure to increased workload (static exercise) was determined in 39 subjects--eight normotensive (NT) volunteers, seven patients with borderline hypertension (BLH), and 24 essential hypertensives (EH), of age-matched groups. A rise of mean pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) by 5 mm Hg or more during maximum handgrip (HG) was considered \"abnormal\" for a workload (SBP x HR x 10(-3)) increase of greater than or equal to 25%. All NT subjects and all patients with BLH as well as 16 of the 24 EH (EH-I) showed normal cardiac performance by this definition. In contrast, PWP increased greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg during HG in eight patients with EH (EH-II). The calculated increase in cardiac workload was not significantly different among the four groups (+5, 5.8, 5.4 and 5.5 respectively). Beta blockade (propranolol, 10 mg i.v.) slowed heart rate in all subjects and reduced SBP x HR product in all groups both at rest and during HG. Responses of PWP to HG were widely divergent in the different patients. However, as a group those patients with \"impaired cardiac performance\" before propranolol (EH-II) had a greater reduction in performance following propranolol than EH-I or NT. This study suggests that adrenergic support of cardiac performance might be important in some hypertensive patients with no evidence of heart failure.", 
    "26": "Electrophysiologic studies before and after administration of 50 mg of intravenous (IV) acebutolol were performed in 20 patients. Four of the 20 had persistent preexcitation, two had intermittent preexcitation, and 14 had a concealed retrogradely conducting accessory pathway (AP). Acebutolol depressed anterograde AP conduction with loss of preexcitation in one patient and increased the effective refractory period of AP in the remaining three; in most, it depressed anterograde normal pathway conduction. The longest atrial paced cycle length producing atrioventricular (AV) nodal block increased from 290 +/- 7 to 39 +/- 6 msec (mean +/- SEM) after acebutolol (p less than 0.01). Acebutolol had no significant effect on retrograde AP conduction. Sustained AV reentrant tachycardia was inducible in all 20 patients before acebutolol and in 19 after acebutolol. The cycle length of tachycardia increased from 323 +/- 8 to 352 +/- 8 msec after acebutolol (p less than 0.01), reflecting an increment of A-H interval from 148 +/- 8 to 174 +/- 9 msec (p less than 0.01). Electrophysiologic studies were reported after 800 mg of oral acebutolol given in four divided doses at six-hour intervals in eight patients. The results were comparable to those of IV acebutolol. Thus, acebutolol depresses AV nodal conduction and slows the rate of AV reentrant tachycardia, but is generally ineffective in inhibiting the induction of sustained tachycardia. It occasionally depresses anterograde AP conduction.", 
    "27": "The central effects of atenolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, were investigated in six healthy men. Two flash-fusion threshold (2FFT), simple reaction time (SRT), digital copying (DCT), symbol-digit modalities (SDMT), and Gibson's spiral maze tests (GSMT) and mood rating scales for tension, alertness, depression, detachment, and anxiety were used. Each subject took 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg atenolol and identical placebo orally in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study and the psychomotor tests were performed at 0, 2, 3, 5, and 8 hr. 2FFT was prolonged at 3 hr after all doses and at 2 and 5 hr with 100, 200, and 400 mg. The maximum effect was achieved with 200 mg and mean 2FFT correlated with mean plasma atenolol concentration. SRTs were prolonged after all doses at between 2 and 5 hr. The DCT and the retest gain of the SDMT were both lower than after placebo at 2 hr with 100, 200, and 400 mg. The time taken to perform the GSMT was not altered by active drug, but the number of errors was lower at 2 hr with 100 and 200 mg. The self-rating mood scales showed a subjective decrease in tension 2 hr after 400 mg. The results show that atenolol exerts central effects in man.", 
    "28": "Eight hypertensive patients who had been followed in an outpatient clinic during long-term therapy with propranolol (40 to 160 mg twice daily) were studied during a 24-hr stay in the ward. The usual oral dose was given and the total and free plasma concentrations were determined during the 24 hr and the urinary excretion of unchanged drug was measured. Average free plasma concentration of propranolol (y free) was calculated from: y free = Excreted propranolol (ng/24 hr)/Creatinine clearance (ml/24 hr). There was a significant relationship between log y free and average free plasma concentration (means free) determined from the directly measured plasma concentration curve: log y free = 0.0743 means free - 0.0466 (r = 0.98, P less than 0.001). In another group of propranolol-treated hypertensive patients there was a significant positive relationship between orosomucoid concentration and reciprocal of the free propranolol fraction in plasma. From this relationship the average total drug concentration (y total) was calculated from y free; there was a significant correlation with directly measured total plasma level: log y total = 0.0038 . means total + 1.0895 (r = 0.91, P less than 0.001). It is suggested that individually determined values of y free below 30 ng/ml and y total below 400 ng/ml (the concentration range studied) can be used to calculate the average mean 24-hr free and total plasma concentrations.", 
    "29": "The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether muscarinic cholinergic agonists exerted a negative chronotropic effect in the absence of endogenous norepinephrine in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocardial strips. The chronotropic response to physostigmine (10(-6) M) in control, reserpine-pretreated animals, and in the presence of increased norepinephrine release induced by superfusion of tyramine (10(-5) M), was studied. The control rates in the control, reserpine-pretreated, and tyramine-treated groups were 106 +/- 40, 93 +/- 31, 109 +/- 28/min, respectively. Propranolol (10(-6) M) produced a 23% slowing in rate in control animals and an 8% slowing in reserpine pretreated animals (P less than 0.01), suggesting basal secretion of norepinephrine. Tyramine (10(-5) M) produced a 28% increase in rate in control animals (P less than 0.05) and tyramine (10(-4) M) produced no increase in reserpine-pretreated animals. Physostigmine produced similar negative chronotropic response in control, reserpine-pretreated, and tyramine-treated groups of 45, 49, and 28%, respectively. Physostigmine produced no change in measured Purkinje fiber action potential characteristics, except for a decreased rate of spontaneous diastolic depolarization. Our results demonstrate that physostigmine slows the spontaneous rate in control, reserpine-pretreated and tyramine-treated groups, indicating that muscarinic cholinergic agonists exert a direct negative chronotropic effect at postjunctional cell surface receptors, independent of the presence or level of adrenergic tone.", 
    "30": "We have investigated the effects of iv administered noradrenergic agonists and antagonists on plasma GH concentration in the adolescent baboon, Papio papio, with the aim of defining the relative roles of adrenergic receptor subtypes (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2) in the regulation of GH release. Clonidine (0.02 mg/kg) or UK-14,304 (0.02 mg/kg), potent centrally acting alpha 2 noradrenergic agonists, were infused into 24 animals pretreated with either saline, or selective alpha 1 and alpha 2 noradrenergic antagonists. Both agonists potently augment plasma GH, producing peak levels of 30-60 ng/ml 15 min post infusion. These responses can be prevented by the prior infusion of the alpha 2 antagonist, piperoxane (1.0 mg/kg), but not by the alpha 1 antagonist, prazosin (2.0 mg/kg). Log dose response curves of the 2 agonists demonstrate a greater potency for UK-14,304 vs. clonidine on a molar basis. In animals pretreated with monoamine depleting agents (reserpine and alpha-methyl paratyrosine) the plasma GH response to an infusion of clonidine (0.02 mg/kg) is significantly enhanced (P less than 0.001). Beta-Adrenoreceptor antagonism by propranolol (0.02 or 1.0 mg/kg) or the more selective beta 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551 (0.02-1.0 mg/kg), results in a rapid and significant (P less than 0.01) increase in plasma GH. The beta 1-antagonist, practolol (0.2-2.0 mg/kg), does not alter plasma GH levels. It is proposed that in the baboon, noradrenaline acts on alpha 2-noradrenergic receptors to stimulate GH release and on beta 2-noradrenergic receptors to inhibit GH release.", 
    "31": "After noting bradycardia-induced supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in two successive children with SVT, we analyzed Holter monitor recordings done on 66 children with suspected or proved SVT. Ten children had apparent reentry SVT. The most common mode of initiation (eight of 10 patients) was not premature atrial beats, but sudden sinus pause with a junctional escape beat (JEB), usually fused with the delayed sinus P wave, initiating the tachycardia. Electrophysiologic studies in five children who had this mode of initiation showed evidence of reentry in four, possibly by dual atrioventricular nodal (AVN) pathways. Since sudden sinus pause and JEB are relatively uncommon in adults, the disappearance of this phenomenon with age may be the most significant reason why children often have less tachyarrhythmia as they get older. Both propranolol and digoxin significantly increased the numbers of episodes of SVT in the three patients tested with serial Holter monitoring.", 
    "32": "In neurosurgical patients autoregulation of cerebral perfusion is often lost. Therefore, a sudden increase in blood pressure may lead to an increase in cerebral blood flow and cerebral oedema may follow. The influence of labetalol, a new alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, on intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure was investigated in dogs without and with mass lesions. During hypotension with labetalol the intracranial pressure remained unchanged and the cerebral perfusion pressure decreased to the same extent as mean arterial pressure (30%). Labetalol seems to be suitable to treat hypertension perioperatively in neurosurgical patients but it is not a suitable drug for induced hypotension.", 
    "33": "The hemodynamic effects of a fixed dose of 10 mg i.v. Labetalol were evaluated in 9 CAD patients during a surgical procedure for myocardial revascularisation. The results show a significant mean decrease in heart rate (HR) (-13%), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-16%) and rate pressure product (RPP) (-28%). Other hemodynamic parameters were not significantly affected. These results were confirmed by a clinical study where in a series of 110 CAD patients 21 were treated during the surgical procedure with incremental doses of Labetalol to control high systolic blood pressure and tachycardia. Administration of a mean dose of 24.3 mg of Labetalol resulted in a significant decrease of RPP (-38%). No side effects related to Labetalol were encountered.", 
    "34": "High-performance liquid chromatographic assays for propranolol and its major metabolites in plasma and breast milk are described. The breast milk/whole plasma ratios of propranolol in three lactating women were in the range of 0.33 to 1.65. The half-life of elimination of propranolol from breast milk was 6.5 +/- 3.4 h (mean +/- SD), which was significantly longer (t = 1.844, df = 4, p less than 0.01) than the half-life of elimination of propranolol from plasma, which was 2.6 +/- 1.2 h (mean +/- SD). The half-life of elimination of the propranolol metabolite naphthoxylactic acid from breast milk was 4.2 +/- 0.9 h (mean +/- SD), which was not significantly different (t = 0.042, df = 4, p greater than 0.05) from the mean half-life of elimination from plasma, which was 4.2 +/- 1.2 h (mean +/- SD). The penetration of propranolol glucuronide into breast milk was slower and to a lesser extent than that of propranolol and naphthoxylactic acid. The maximum dose, calculated from the results presented in this paper, ingested as either propranolol or as propranolol glucuronide in breast milk by the neonate would be less than 0.1% of the maternal dose.", 
    "35": "Twelve male subjects were given placebo or 160 mg propranolol, in divided doses, during a 24-hr period before drinking a beverage containing 0 or 50 ml ethanol/70 kg body weight. Tests designed to measure mental and motor performance were administered 75 min after the last dose of propranolol. The tests performed included the wobble board (WB), pursuit meter (PM), delayed auditory feedback (DAF), pegboard (PB), tapping, time estimation (TE), and a modified Cornell medical index (CMI). A mean blood ethanol concentration of 48.0 +/- 9.1 mg/dl and a mean plasma propranolol level of 33.1 +/- 13.1 ng/ml were achieved. Ethanol alone significantly impaired performance in 12 out of 20 tests (p less than 0.05). Propranolol significantly (p less than 0.05) antagonized the decrement in psychomotor performance induced by ethanol on the PM. In all other tests, there was no significant interaction between ethanol and propranolol. Propranolol alone had no significant effect on the psychomotor tests. When the drugs were combined, the subjective symptoms, as measured by the CMI, showed a trend toward being additive. This study suggests that no adverse interaction occurs between therapeutic doses of propranolol and minimum impairment doses of ethanol.", 
    "36": "Twenty patients with hypertension uncontrolled by existing therapy with two or three antihypertensive agents (a beta-blocker plus a thiazide diuretic in 10 and with the addition of hydralazine or prazosin in the other 10) were studied to assess the effects of additional long-term administration of nifedipine. Eighteen patients received 10 mg nifedipine 3-times daily and 2 received 20 mg twice daily. Patients were followed-up at monthly intervals. The results showed that mean blood pressure levels were reduced at 1 month and adequate control was achieved and maintained in 12 (60%) of the patients. Five of those who continued with the combined treatment remained non-responders and 3 patients had to stop nifedipine because of side-effects (flushing and headaches). Four other patients reported similar side-effects. No changes were evident in weight, pulse rate or the haematological and biochemical parameters studied.", 
    "37": "An open study was carried out in 251 hypertensive patients, all but 10 of whom had been treated previously, mainly with beta-blockers or dihydralazine, to collect data primarily on the incidence of side-effects when long-term treatment with labetalol was substituted. Dosage ranged from 100 to 2400 mg per day (mean 654 mg per day) and treatment was continued for between 6 and 18 months (mean 7.8 months) in 229 patients. Labetalol proved to be at least as effective as previous therapy in the majority of patients and, although side-effects were reported in approximately half the study population, most were mild and transient requiring withdrawal in only 10%, within a few days or weeks in 20 patients. Scalp tingling was the most frequent of the side-effects particular to this drug. Postural hypotension and bradycardia was usually not very marked and troubles with micturition or sexual problems did not occur often. There was an improvement in Raynaud's and similar syndromes and arteritis in patients with these symptoms who had previously been receiving beta-blocking agents.", 
    "38": "An open study was carried out in general practice to assess the efficacy and tolerance of a timolol (10 mg)/hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg)/amiloride (2.5 mg) preparation in 558 hypertensive patients previously receiving multi-dose antihypertensive therapy, and to determine whether the results were influenced by the manner in which the doctor conducted this change in therapy. Patients received 1 or, if necessary, 2 tablets once daily over a period of 12 weeks and were randomly allocated on entry to one of two groups. One group was given a full explanation for the change in therapy, the other group was simply told that treatment was to be changed. The results showed that the change in treatment led to a significant reduction in blood pressure in both groups, at a dosage of 1 tablet daily in over half the patients, and the majority (88%) preferred the new form of treatment. Patient acceptance was good and the number of reports of adverse symptoms decreased during the study period. There was no significant difference in any of the results between the two groups.", 
    "39": "1. The effects of phentolamine, propranolol, D 600, theophylline, papaverine and an extract of Ginkgo biloba were studied with respect to the two phases of the contractile response induced by norepinephrine in an isolated rabbit aorta. 2. Phentolamine (3 x 10(-6) M) inhibits the rapid phase of the contraction of the rabbit aorta brought on by norepinephrine (NE) 10(-5) M more strongly than the tonic phase. Propranolol (10(-6) M) potentiates this rapid phase. 3. D 600 inhibits the slow phase with an EC50 = to 3.8 x 10(-8) M. 4. Papaverine and theophylline increase the relaxation that follows the rapid phase of contraction. The slow phase is inhibited only by papaverine. 5. The extract of Ginkgo biloba (Gb) at a concentration of 3 mg/ml has the same type of effect as papaverine 3 X 10(-5) M.", 
    "40": "Pharmacokinetic interactions of oral timolol maleate 10 mg, with food (3566 kJ), single oral doses of prazosin 1 mg and dihydralazine 25 mg, and with a 1 week pretreatment with phenobarbitone 100 mg daily were examined in a randomized crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. After fasting, the peak level (Cmax = 29.1 +/- 3.2 ng/ml; mean +/- SEM) was reached at 1.3 +/- 0.1 h (Tmax). The total area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) was 154.4 +/- 33.8 ng x h/ml, total clearance (Cltot) 751.5 +/- 90.6 ml/min, renal clearance (Clren) 97.2 +/- 10.1 ml/min, elimination half-life (t1/2) 2.9 +/- 0.3 h and 24-h recovery in urine (X0u-24) 11.1 +/- 1.4% of the dose. Food and prazosin did not significantly affect the fate of timolol maleate. Dihydralazine enhanced Cmax (38.2 +/- 4.6 ng/ml) only when compared to phenobarbitone treatment, and did not affect any other parameters. Phenobarbitone pretreatment somewhat lowered Cmax (25.5 +/- 3.9 ng/ml), AUC0-infinity (117.5 +/- 22.1; p less than 0.05 vs food) and X0u-24 (8.7 +/- 1.2%), evidently by increasing Cltot (957.5 +/- 116.9 ml/min; p less than 0.05 vs food), but it did not affect Clren. It is concluded that the pharmacokinetics of timolol maleate can be altered to a limited extent in opposite directions by dihydralazine and phenobarbitone.", 
    "41": "The absorption and disposition of metoprolol have been evaluated in 10 healthy, non-smoking, elderly individuals (mean age 73.1 years) by simultaneous determination of [3H]-metoprolol and unlabelled metoprolol. The labelled drug was given as an intravenous tracer dose, immediately followed by oral metoprolol 25 mg. The experiment was preceded by administration of metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d. for 3 days. The volume of distribution, elimination half-life and total body clearance were almost the same as previously observed in healthy, young subjects. The mean systemic availability was about 39% in the elderly, which is lower than the mean of 55% observed in a control group of young volunteers who received 50 mg b.i.d. In the elderly, the mean plasma concentration of alpha-OH-metoprolol was about twice as high as that of the parent drug, whereas the opposite was true of the control group. The results indicate that age-related physiological changes have a negligible effect on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol.", 
    "42": "The disposition of oral metoprolol was studied in 5 women during the last trimester of pregnancy and 3 to 5 months after delivery. After a single oral dose of 100 mg the individual peak plasma concentration in the pregnant state was only 20-40% of that after pregnancy. The plasma half-lives of metoprolol were about the same during (average 1.3 h) and after pregnancy (average 1.7 h). By contrast, the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve was much smaller during (mean 262 nmol/1 X h) than after (mean 1298 nmol/1 X h) pregnancy, resulting in an average apparent oral clearance (Clo) of metoprolol that was 4.4 times higher during (362 ml X kg-1 body-weight X min-1) than after pregnancy. The increased Clo in pregnancy is assumed to be due to enhanced hepatic metabolism of the drug. The possible clinical consequence of the difference in the disposition of metoprolol is discussed.", 
    "43": "The effect of isosorbide-dinitrate (ISDN) 20 mg 4 times daily against placebo has been tested in 12 patients with stable effort induced angina pectoris receiving prophylactic treatment with metoprolol. ISDN did not decrease the attack rate or nitroglycerine consumption, nor was exercise tolerance increased after it. Left ventricular function, assessed by radionuclide ventriculography, increased in 6 out of 8 patients (p less than 0.1). It is concluded that ISDN has no place in the treatment of haemodynamically intact patients with severe angina pectoris in spite of beta-blocking treatment, but that it may be of value in the treatment of patients with left ventricular failure, including those whose left ventricular failure has been brought about by beta-blocking treatment necessitated by angina pectoris.", 
    "44": "Prognosis in congestive cardiomyopathy (COCM) with marked dilatation and heart failure is poor. A low rate of spontaneous recovery was observed. A high level of circulating catecholamines is often found, which may explain the common finding of resting tachycardia. An early series of COCM patients with tachycardia responded surprisingly well when chronic beta-blockade was added to the conventional treatment of failure. Later, even patients without tachycardia were included with a period of placebo preceding beta-blocker treatment in order to exclude patients with spontaneous recovery. Acute beta-blockade was surprisingly well tolerated, possibly because the reduction in contractility was compensated for by an increase in myocardial compliance. After long-term beta-blockade, improvement was observed after 6 months and further improvement was seen after 24 months. In patients improving functionally, there was reduction in heart size and left ventricular end diastolic diameter and increase in working performance. For the whole group, there was a decrease in rapid filling wave in apex cardiogram, reduction in third heart sound and increase in ejection fraction. Changes in the reverse way were seen in these three variables after beta-blocker withdrawal and relapse into heart failure occurred in 6/15 patients. Changes in diastolic function may be an early important effect of beta-blockade in COCM. Increase in survival was seen when beta-blocker-treated patients with COCM were compared to well matched COCM controls. It is suggested that increased sensitivity to sympathetic stimulation contributes to the pathogenesis in some patients with COCM and that improvement in myocardial function explains prolonged survival.", 
    "45": "1. The effects of daily administration of propranolol on the distribution of cardiac output were studied in the late pregnant guinea-pig. 2. The animals were given either saline, 5 or 50 mg/kg per day of l-propranolol for 15 days during the last trimester of gestation. 3. Blood flow responses were assessed by injecting 15 microns microspheres into the conscious animal one to two days prior to parturition. 4. The fraction of cardiac output reaching the placentas was significantly reduced in both groups (P less than 0.5 and P less than 0.001, respectively), while flow to all other organs studied remained unaltered. 5. It is suggested that propranolol exerts a selective effect on the placental vascular bed in the guinea-pig.", 
    "46": "The influence of inflammatory disease on the pharmacokinetics of atenolol and metoprolol was investigated after administering single oral 100 mg doses of the drugs to six subjects. Each subject had a respiratory tract infection with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of over 20 mm in the first hour and a body temperature of at least 38.5 degrees. Since the subjects subsequently received atenolol and metoprolol when they were healthy, each person acted as his own control. Inflammatory disease had no influence on the kinetics of metoprolol. In contrast, mean peak plasma levels and AUC for atenolol were significantly lower, both by about 40 per cent, during infectious disease compared to the healthy state (p less than 0.05), where as renal clearance of atenolol slightly increased from 110.8 +/- 14.7 ml min-1 in the healthy state to 128 +/- 21.6 ml min-1, when the ESR's were elevated. The elimination half-life of atenolol, about 10 h, was not affected by the health status of the subjects. Reduced absorption in the gastro-intestinal tract and enhanced elimination of atenolol from plasma might account for the decreased AUC and peak plasma levels of the drug during inflammatory disease.", 
    "47": "The influence of 35 commonly used drugs on measurement of metanephrines in urine was evaluated. Two concentrations of drugs were chosen for study based on usual doses and the percent of dose excreted unchanged in the urine. At \"medium\" drug concentrations, only phenylephrine falsely elevated metanephrine levels, whereas at a 10-fold higher drug concentration, guanethidine, hydrocortisone, imipramine, isoetharine, levodopa, phenobarbital, and phenylephrine caused positive interference. Propranolol and theophylline caused a negative interference at the two concentrations studied. The significance of these results is discussed.", 
    "48": "Up to now betablockers were regarded as relatively contraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The effects of metoprolol were studied in hypertensive patients (stage I, WHO) with PVD of pelvic and thigh type (stage II according to Fontaine). An initial dose of 100 mg metoprolol followed by 100 mg 90 min after the first oral administration, twice a day was administered for 8 weeks. Blood pressure decreased from 181/105 to 163/96 mm Hg. Pulse rate was lowered from 72 to 68/min (p less than 0.001). Estimated doppler pressure in the posterior tibial artery decreased from 123 to 119 mm Hg. Venous occlusion plethysmography showed a slight but not significant decrease at rest and during reactive hyperemia. During long-term treatment the pain-free walking distance increased significantly from 225 to 348 m. No side effects were seen. Thus, metoprolol as a beta 1-selective betablocker is not contraindicated in patients with intermittent claudication.", 
    "49": "1. The aim of this study was to investigate an eventual influence of hypercholesterolemia on drug kinetics in the rabbit. Pharmacokinetic of propranolol, phenytoin and lidocain was studied in groups of male \"Fauve de Bourgogne\" rabbits. Each compound was administered by intravenous single dose injection, dosage being 1 mg/kg for propranolol, 10 mg/kg for phenytoin, and 3,5 mg/kg for lidocain. Propranolol plasma levels were determined by spectrofluorimetric method; plasma concentrations of phenytoin and lidocain were determinated according to a gas chromatographic method. 2. Our data showed variations of pharmacokinetic parameters for propranolol and phenytoin only. For propranolol the total body clearance (0,178 +/- 0,064 and 0,115 +/- 0,048 l.kg-1.mn-1; p less than 0,05) and the volume of distribution (9,32 +/- 3,10 and 6,02 +/- 0,96 l.kg-1; p less than 0,01) were significantly diminished; half-life (40,25 +/- 19,45 and 45,62 +/- 32,20 mn) remained inchanged. For phenytoin, total body clearance (3,28 +/- 0,94 and 1,43 +/- 0,50 l.kg-1.mn-1; p less than 0,001) was significantly diminished; half-life (136,4 +/- 29,4 and 324,9 +/- 131,6 mn; p less than 0,001) significantly increased; volume of distribution (0,62 +/- 0,13 and 0,62 +/- 0,10 l.kg-1) remained unchanged. 3. These variations may be related to changes in the plasma binding for propranolol and in the hepatic metabolism for propranolol and phenytoin.", 
    "50": "Diabetic patients without evidence of vascular disease often reveal non-specific ST-T changes and prolonged QTc intervals in their ECGs. In an attempt to elucidate the role of autonomic dysfunction in the etiology of these changes, we compared the ECGs and beat to beat variations in 22 patients with changes in repolarization before and one hour after beta blockade. None had clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease. In 19 patients (86%) the ST-T changes persisted after beta blockade. Heart rate was 75.6 +/- 15.3/min before and 64.3 +/- 9.6/min after beta blockade, while the QTc interval was 0.43 +/- 0.02 sec before and 0.41 +/- 0.02 sec after propranolol. Beat to beat variation during deep breathing is diminished in diabetic patients. Beta blockade reversed this phenomena. We conclude that while beat to beat variations and prolongation of QTc are likely to be consequent to autonomic neuropathy, the ST-T changes do not appear to be due to increased sympathetic tone and their etiology is yet to be determined.", 
    "51": "This review is an attempt to demonstrate the safety and usefulness of the simple maneuver of carotid sinus stimulation with selected subjects undergoing exercise tests. In a variety of circumstances the addition of CSP before or after treadmill walking can yield clinically relevant information relating to arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, symptoms, and pacemakers. Further applications and benefits of these combined procedures remain to be clarified and expanded for judicious application with attention to safeguards.", 
    "52": "Labetalol is an alpha- and beta-blocking agent commonly used in anti-hypertensive therapy. Because of its beta-blocking and local anesthetic effect, labetalol via peridural catheter was supposed to reduce pain in patients suffering from gynecologic cancers. Thirty patients with terminal carcinomas (breast, uterus, ovary), whose pain was caused either by bone metastases or by primary invasion cancer, were treated. Peridural catheters were inserted and fixed at various levels, thoracic or lumbar, and 50 mg labetalol was injected every 4 h at the beginning and every 12-24 h on the following 2-3 days. The analgesia started immediately during the injection. No sensitive damage or neurovegetative block appeared. In 40% of the patients the catheter was removed after a 3-day treatment because of the definitive suppression of pain. Other analgesics were not required during the treatment; no tolerance to the drug was developed. The peridural catheter remained in situ for an average period of 4-30 days. Afterward it was possible to treat more cases as outpatients depending on their general conditions and with the help of their family doctors. After a few days of therapy, almost all the patients reported a burning pain at the site of the injection; this problem was easily resolved by prior injection of a 4-mg dose of betamethasone.", 
    "53": "The effects of a single dose of alinidine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), the N-allyl-derivative of clonidine, on heart rate and blood pressure were investigated in healthy volunteers and in patients with hyperkinetic heart syndrome, at rest and during bicycle exercise. In healthy volunteers plasma catecholamine levels were also determined. Alinidine did not change heart rate at rest in the healthy volunteers but it did significantly reduce exercise-induced tachycardia, whereas blood pressure and plasma catecholamine levels were not significantly affected by alinidine, either at rest or during exercise. In patients with hyperkinetic heart syndrome, alinidine reduced heart rate at rest and during exercise to a similar extent as propranolol (0.1 mg/kg i.v.). The blood pressure did not change with alinidine but it was significantly reduced by propranolol. The observation that an alinidine-induced reduction of heart rate occurs without a concomitant fall in blood pressure, and without a clonidine-like symphatho-inhibitory action, is in line with experimental findings suggesting a specific bradycardic action of alinidine under short-term conditions.", 
    "54": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on ventilatory parameters and on subjective complaints was studied in 73 patients suffering from hyperventilation syndrome. The beta-blockade made the PA,CO2 increase as much as tranquillizer therapy. No effect of any kind of therapy was found on the subjective complaints. A remarkable dissociation was found between the measured ventilatory parameters and the quantified subjective complaints. It is concluded that beta-blockade is an effective therapy for the basic problem of hypocapnia in the hyperventilation syndrome; in this respect it is to be preferred over other therapies such as tranquillizers.", 
    "55": "To assess the possible involvement of the monoaminergic neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin in the maintenance of spatial working memory rats were treated with antagonists 0 or 2 hr after completing the first 4 choices in an 8 arm maze. Haloperidol (0.25-1 mg/kg), when administered 2 hr after Choice 4, produced a small but consistent impairment in performance on retention tests given 5 hr after the first 4 choices. This deficit closely resembled natural forgetting in terms of the type of errors committed. By contrast, haloperidol in the same doses given 0 hr after Choice 4 or 3 hr before the first 4 choices did not affect retention. Likewise treatment with propranolol (10-20 mg/kg), phentolamine (5-20 mg/kg) or methysergide (5-15 mg/kg) did not impair spatial memory, regardless of when these drugs were injected within the session. Evidently dopaminergic neuronal systems are important in the maintenance of normal spatial working memory.", 
    "56": "Pindolol is a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with relatively marked intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Stimulant effects in isolated, perfused mesenteric vessels (beta 2) equal those of isoprenaline. Effects on guinea-pig atria (beta 1) are negligible and those on guinea-pig trachea (beta 1 and beta 2) and cat atria (beta 1 and beta 2) are equivalent to 40-50% of the maximum effects of isoprenaline. It is concluded that the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of pindolol is exerted principally on the beta 2-adrenoceptor. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect of pindolol is largely confined to the (-)enantiomer, whereas its stimulant effects are shared equally by the (+) and (-)enantiomers. Removal of the side chain hydroxyl group of pindolol does not diminish stimulant activity, but abolishes blocking activity. Pindolol-induced stimulation and blockade of beta-adrenoceptors may be brought about by different configurations of the molecule. Vasodilator effects observed in vitro and in vivo suggest that beta-adrenoceptor stimulation may make an important contribution to the antihypertensive effect of pindolol in man.", 
    "57": "In control and cold-adapted rats the oxygen tension (pO2) was measured polarographically in the fast (gastrocnemic) and slow (soleus) muscles before and after blocking of beta-adrenoreceptors or the denervation of the muscle. The beta-adrenoreceptor blockade decreases the pO2 in both types of muscles in the control group of rats, whereas in cold-adapted rats the decrease of pO2 both types of muscles in the control group of rats, whereas in cold-adapted rats the decrease of pO2 is less pronounced in the coleus and remains unchanged in the gastrocnemic muscle. The sciatic nerve dissection augments the pO2 in both muscles, the increase being larger in cold-adapted rats as compared to the control group. It seems that the dependence of the oxygenation processes in muscles on nervous control and on the state of beta-adrenoreceptors increases during adaptation to cold mainly in the slow muscles.", 
    "58": "Studies on spontaneous lipid chemiluminescence, the concentration of malonic dialdehyde and Schiff bases in the zone of ischemia and myocardial infarction in rats with myocardial infarction induced by coronary occlusion have shown that obsidan (propranolol) inhibits free radical lipid peroxidation. The drug increases the animals' survival rate, improves the ECG readings, diminishes the size of the infarct zone, reduces the number of postcoronary occlusion arrhythmias, and exerts an antifibrillatory action. Inhibition of free radical lipid peroxidation plays a role in the therapeutic effect of obsidan.", 
    "59": "Nine patients with stable angina (group 1) underwent maximal treadmill stress testing and thallium-201 (201T1) myocardial scintigraphy after intravenous propranolol hydrochloride, and after placebo. Though seven of the nine patients exercised longer after propranolol than after placebo, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Propranolol, however, significantly reduced the mean maximum rate pressure product. Comparison of the perfusion scans on and off propranolol showed that in 36 out of 90 of the myocardial segments recorded (nine patients, five segments scanned twice per patient), only one of the scans showed a defect. In 24 out of 36 of these the propranolol scan was negative, the defect appearing in the placebo scan. Defects present on both scans but differing significantly in size occurred in 22 out of 54 view pairs (nine patients, three views after exercise and three views after redistribution on propranolol and on placebo), and in 19 of these the smaller defect was seen in the propranolol scan. In one of the nine patients, the propranolol scan was normal (false negative), whereas defects corresponding to angiographically proven coronary artery lesions were seen on the placebo scan. Six patients (group 2) were maximally exercised after propranolol and then re-exercised to the same rate pressure product on placebo. Again 16 out of 60 of the segment pairs disagreed and in 10 of these the unmatched defect was present on the placebo scan. In 10 out of 14 discrepant view pairs, the smaller defect occurred on the propranolol scan. Thus in patients taking propranolol, negative results do not exclude coronary artery disease, and perfusion defects (if present) though accurately reflecting the presence of disease may underestimate its true extent.", 
    "60": "Direct effects of islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, on membrane preparations from rat heart tissues were studied. The native IAP was without effect, but its A-protomer, an active subunit, was effective after reduction of disulfide bonds in the peptide chain; it catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the membrane Mr = 41,000 protein. Simultaneously, muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase was abolished. Carbachol, an agonist of muscarinic receptors, bound to membranes with the Hill coefficient smaller than unity. The affinity for the carbachol binding was lowered and the Hill coefficient was increased by guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), reflecting the muscarinic receptor coupling to the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (N). Carbachol bound to the A-promoter-treated membranes with a lower affinity and a higher Hill coefficient, and these kinetic values were not altered by Gpp(NH)p, indicating that treatment of membranes with the A-protomer of IAP uncoupled muscarinic receptors from N. This IAP-sensitive N is Ni involved in the cyclase inhibition. Neither beta-adrenergic activation of adenylate cyclase nor beta-agonist binding to membranes was affected by the A-protomer of IAP. Thus, N (Ns) coupled to beta-receptors is not the site of its action. Although the affinity and the Hill coefficient for beta-agonist binding was not affected by preactivated cholera toxin either, the effect of Gpp(NH)p to alter these kinetic parameters was much smaller in the cholera toxin-treated membranes than in non-treated membranes. Thus, cholera toxin modified beta-receptor coupling to Ns in a manner quite different from IAP-induced modification of muscarinic receptor coupling to Ni.", 
    "61": "The tremorogenic effect of nicotine was studied in control rats and in rats withdrawn for 16-48 h from chronic ethanol administration. The intensity of tremor was measured electronically. Rats withdrawn from ethanol showed a marked hypersensitivity to the tremorogenic action of nicotine. Propranolol abolished the nicotine-induced tremor in the control rats. Propranolol did not, however, reduce the intensity of nicotine-induced tremor in rats withdrawn from ethanol. Thus, the observed hypersensitivity does not seem to be mediated by a sympathetic beta-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "62": "The effect of penbutolol (Betapressin), a stereospecific beta-adrenergic antagonist, on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of intravenous lidocaine was evaluated in seven healthy volunteers. Subjects received a single 100-mg lidocaine intravenous dose of lidocaine hydrochloride, once in the control state and a second time during coadministration of penbutolol, 60 mg daily. Lidocaine volume of distribution was significantly increased during penbutolol treatment (4.9 vs 3.4 l/kg, p less than 0.005), resulting in a significant prolongation of elimination half-life (2.5 vs 2.0 h, p less than 0.025). The mechanism of the distributional shift is not established, but may result from a change in the pattern of peripheral blood flow and therefore the profile of tissue uptake of lidocaine. Total metabolic clearance of lidocaine, however, was not significantly altered by penbutolol (23.0 vs 19.4 ml/min/kg). The present study of healthy volunteers suggests that penbutolol increases lidocaine volume of distribution. If the finding also applied to patients, a higher loading dose of lidocaine might be necessary.", 
    "63": "Normal and cardiac denervated dogs, with an electromagnetic aortic flowprobe implanted at least 14 days before the experiments, ran at different speeds on a 25% graded treadmill. The experiments were carried out before and after blockade of betareceptors in the heart by PO administration of 125 mg X kg-1 practolol per day. Changes in stroke volume, heart rate, and cardiac output were measured. After beta-adrenergic blockade, only two of the seven dogs with denervated hearts were prepared to run at a limited number of speeds. Time constants of the cardiac output changes at the onset of exercise were significantly different (P less than 0.001) for the normal (11.5 +/- 0.7 s, mean +/- SEM) and the denervated dogs (29.5 +/- 1.1 s), but in normal dogs did not change with practolol (11.8 +/- 0.8 s). The steady state relationship between cardiac output (CO) and work per unit time performed on the treadmill (P) was for normal dogs: CO = 156 + 1.55P, for normal dogs after practolol treatment: CO = 156 + 0.43P (slope significantly different, P less than 0.05), and for dogs with denervated hearts: CO = 121 + 2.06P (not significantly different from normal dogs). It was concluded that changes in the venous or arterial system alone are not sufficient to increase cardiac output appreciably during exercise. The magnitude of the cardiac output increase depends more on the presence of intact beta-receptors than on the presence of intact cardiac nerves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "The kinetics of oxygen uptake (VO2) were assessed in 17 normal subjects with beta-blockade and placebo. beta-blockade was achieved with either 50 mg oral metoprolol or 40 mg oral propranolol, each twice per day. Tests were conducted on the cycle ergometer at work rates approximating 80% of the work rate at ventilatory anaerobic threshold. Work rate was initiated as a square wave starting from prior rest. Data obtained 48 h, 1 week, and 4 weeks after starting drug or placebo were pooled to increase the number of points for regression analysis of kinetic parameters. While there were no differences in the plateau values for VO2 with and without beta-blockade, the rate of adaptation to steady state was significantly slower with beta-blockade than with placebo (P less than 0.05). This resulted in an increase of oxygen deficit by approximately 200 ml O2. Cardiac output measured by CO2 rebreathing was significantly reduced by beta-blockade (metoprolol by 4.1%, propranolol by 12.2%, both P less than 0.05). Blood lactate concentration was unaffected by beta-blockade. It was concluded that the influence of beta-blockade on the oxygen transport system was responsible for the significantly slower increase of VO2 to steady state in submaximal exercise.", 
    "65": "Three groups of healthy volunteers were given oral doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg, respectively, of the beta-receptor blocking drug mepindolol sulphate (Corindolan). Plasma levels of the active compound mepindolol were measured by means of a sensitive and specific HPLC method. Mepindolol was rapidly absorbed reaching maximum concentrations of 21 +/- 7 ng/ml (5 mg), 47 +/- 23 ng/ml (10 mg) and 54 +/- 29 ng/ml (20 mg) 1--3 h after administration. The AUC ratio of the three doses studied was 1 : 1.9 : 3.0 suggesting incomplete absorption in the 20 mg group. The biological half-life of the drug was calculated to be 3--4 h, independently of the dose administered.", 
    "66": "1. 15 schizophrenic patients diagnosed according to criteria of I.C.D.-9 were treated with d1-propranolol in a 4 week open study. 2. A fixed dose schedule was followed and a maximum dose of 1920 mg/day was reached by day 17. 3. Results revealed a significant reduction in core schizophrenic symptoms of CPRS & BPRS starting between 1st and second weeks of therapy. Higher doses were well tolerated and serious bradycardia occurred only in 3 patients. 4. The implications of these results are discussed.", 
    "67": "1. The association of antagonism of apomorphine-induced climbing with potentiation of apomorphine-induced gnawing in mice has been suggested as a means to detect \"atypical\" neuroleptics. 2. Clozapine, many compounds with central anticholinergic activity and propranolol have been demonstrated to possess this profile of activities. 3. Pharmacological manipulations with cholinomimetics suggest a cholinergic modulation of the gnawing behavior induced by apomorphine. 4. The observations with propranolol cannot be explained either by a cholinergic link nor by beta-adrenergic antagonism.", 
    "68": "Triiodothyroacetic acid, triac, when given to rats during pregnancy, causes hypertrophy and intracellular disarray in the hearts of their offspring and concurrent treatment with dl propranolol can prevent the latter abnormality. Further experiments have been carried out to test the effect of dl oxprenolol and d propranolol on triac-induced myofibrillar disarray. Administration of dl oxprenolol at the same time as triac prevented disarray but a higher dose than that of dl propranolol was required to produce this effect. Disarray was also prevented by d propranolol. Selective consideration of the membrane stabilising, beta blocking and agonist activities of dl oxprenolol and d and dl propranolol leads to the conclusion that although direct or indirect beta stimulation by triac may play a small part in its disruptive effect on the developing myocardium, its main deleterious action can be blocked by membrane stabilisation.", 
    "69": "The results are summarized of 13 published investigations of the beta-blocker 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone hydrochloride (carteolol hydrochloride, Endak, Endak mite) with a total of 378 patients suffering from cardiac rhythm irregularities (tachycardias, extrasystoles (ES), arrhythmias). Carteolol is markedly effective against sinus tachycardia caused by functionally dependent cardiac arrhythmia, hyperthyroidism or other factors. Average daily doses of 2-10 mg produced convincing reductions in the heart rate (up to 23.5%) within two weeks. This was particularly the case for patients with initial rates of more than 100 beats/min. whereas the normal heart frequency was not affected by carteolol. The substance was also effective against beat rate increases caused by stress in patients with sinus tachycardia. Ventricular extrasystoles (63.4% efficacy) and supraventricular extrasystoles (80% efficacy) could be effectively improved. A double-blind trial of carteolol against propranolol in the treatment of extrasystoles indicates the superiority of carteolol after three weeks. Patients with frequency of 10-19 ES/min were, in particular, significantly more frequently improved. The frequency of side-effects was 4%; a discontinuation of therapy was requisite in 4 patients (1.1%).", 
    "70": "The ability of 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone hydrochloride (carteolol hydrochloride, Endak, Endak mite) to lower the blood pressure was tested in an open clinical study on 66 patients with I-III degree essential hypertension. The results for 49 of the 66 patients were interpretable after 4 weeks, and for 39 of them after 12 weeks. Even with a single dose of 5 mg/day 33 of the patients had normalized blood pressures after 4 weeks (systolic less than 160, diastolic less than 95 mmHg); in a further 6 patients 10 mg led to normal blood pressure. For 10 patients, 4 weeks on 10 mg did not lead to an adequate response. After 12 weeks, of the 39 cases that could be checked, 19 were normalized on 5 mg, 2 on 10 mg and another 4 on 15 mg. Even 15 mg was insufficient to reduce the blood pressure of 14 of the patients adequately. Carteolol, at doses of 5-15 mg/day, caused a therapeutically acceptable lowering of the blood pressure in 60-80% of cases of essential hypertension of all 3 degrees of severity. Only 5 of the patients suffered from side-effects, none of which caused the treatment to be abandoned. A bradycardia was never observed during up to 12 weeks of continuous treatment. Tachycardias reverted to sinus rhythms of normal frequency. Blood pressure measurement by the patients themselves proved successful.", 
    "71": "1. The dose-response relation and duration of action of the beta-blocking agent 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone hydrochloride (carteolol hydrochloride, Endak, Endak mite) were investigated by means of exercise testing under randomized, double-blind conditions in two groups of healthy probands (n = 9 and n = 9, respectively). 2. The effect of 2 mg carteolol p.o. on changes in heart rate, ischemic ST-segment depression, and blood pressure was studied in 10 patients with coronary heart disease using an exercise test performed 2 h after ingestion of the drug. 3. In terms of exercise heart rate, a clear dose-response relation was demonstrated over the range of dosages (1 and 5 mg) employed. Exercise heart rate was reduced by 10% after a single dose of approximately 0.5 mg. The beta-blocking effect of 0.2 mg carteolol, however, remains unconfirmed. A dosage increase from 5 to 25 mg yields only a slight additional effect. The therapeutically attainable maximal reduction in the rise in exercise heart rate should be about 20%. 4. 24 h after a single dose of carteolol, 60-90% of the initial drug effect was still evident. 5. Resting and standing heart rate were not influenced significantly by 1, 2, 5 or 25 mg carteolol. The groups displayed a somewhat variable response. 6. 2 h after intake of 2 mg carteolol, mean ischemic ST-segment depression was reduced by somewhat more than 50%. Blood pressure at rest remained unchanged, whereas the rise in systolic blood pressure during exercise was lowered significantly. 7. In comparison with other beta-blocking agents, carteolol was effective at low dosage levels and retained considerable potency 24 h after ingestion. In many cases, once--daily administration should be adequate to yield a satisfactory clinical response.", 
    "72": "In 17 patients with coronary heart disease the influence of the beta-blocking agent 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone-hydrochloride) (carteolol hydrochloride, Endak, Endak mite) (0.4 mg i.v.) on heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac index, stroke volume index and pulmonary artery pressure at rest and during exercise was investigated. During exercise heart rate and cardiac index decrease significantly (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.05, respectively). The differences in the stroke volume indices are not significant. The relationship between stroke volume index and mean pressure in the pulmonary artery shows a slight decrease after administration of carteolol at rest and a small increase of the mean pressure in the pulmonary artery during exercise. In patients with coronary heart disease left ventricular function does not change significantly at rest and during exercise after administration of carteolol.", 
    "73": "Studies of the acute toxicity of 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone hydrochloride (carteolol hydrochloride, Endak, Endak mite) in various species by different modes of administration revealed comparatively slight necropsy and histological changes despite characteristic clinical features of poisoning, There were only minor discrepancies in LD50 between the different species, and no sex differences were observed. The LD50 was 2000-4000 times the therapeutic dose. Death is thought to be due to excessive enhancement of the pharmacological action of the sympathomimetic component with extreme abnormalities of blood distribution and interference with cardiac and lung function. In subchronic and chronic toxicity tests in rats no effects due to the drug were demonstrable for doses of up to 150 mg/kg. In dogs the highest dose free from side-effects was between 3 and 30 mg/kg. Above 10 times the therapeutic dose there was some increase in brown adipose tissue, but this is not thought to be of any pathological significance. No teratogenic effects were detected in experiments on mice, rats and rabbits, and no embryotoxic or fetotoxic activity was seen except for doses high enough to produce toxic effects in the mother animals. No carcinogenic properties were identified. Tests for mutagenic effects (S. typhimurium, E. coli, cytogenetic studies in rats, dominant lethal test) yielded negative results.", 
    "74": "From investigations in rats and dogs it is known that the proportion of 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone hydrochloride (carteolol hydrochloride, Endak, Endak mite) absorbed after oral administration is 60-80%. In dogs (as in human beings) most of it is excreted via the kidneys, but in rats biliary elimination predominates. In addition to 8-hydroxycarteolol--which also possesses pharmacological activity--the main metabolites found in dogs and rats are glucuronides of carteolol and 8-hydroxycarteolol. The elimination half-lives in dogs, rats and rabbits are between 1.2 and 3.0 h. Distribution studies point to the existence of a blood-brain barrier (rats and dogs) and a placental barrier (mice). The apparent volume of distribution measured after i.v. injection was from 2.5 to 8.5 l/kg depending on species. Passage into the milk was demonstrated in rats. Plasma protein binding is minimal. In a long-term study in dogs there was no evidence of cumulation except at the very high dosage of 200 mg/kg.", 
    "75": "A short survey of the chemistry of beta-blockers provides a description of the synthesis of carteolol hydrochloride (5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone- hydrochloride), the new pharmaceutically active substance of Endak and Endak mite tablets, and outlines some of its properties.", 
    "76": "The influence of aluminium hydroxide and magnesium oxide on the oral bioavailability of quinidine, procainamide and propranolol in the dog was investigated. The administration of aluminium hydroxide with a quinidine sulfate capsule causes a significant decrease of maximal plasma concentration (Cpmax) and a shift in tmax (time to reach Cpmax). The area under the curve is not significantly decreased. Administration of magnesium oxide together with a quinidine sulfate capsule or a sustained-release preparation of quinidine bisulfate causes a significant decrease of both Cpmax and the area under the curve. A shift of tmax was observed for the conventional preparation only. The administration of aluminium hydroxide with procainamide hydrochloride diminishes only Cpmax in a significant way. Administration of magnesium oxide together with procainamide hydrochloride has no influence on the different parameters. Administration of aluminium hydroxide or magnesium oxide with propranolol hydrochloride has a significant negative influence on both the Cpmax and the area under the curve.", 
    "77": "A study was carried out in 40 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The treatment administered was a fixed drug combination of oxprenolol (160 mg) and chlorthalidone (20 mg) in a single morning dose for 16 weeks. As a result, resting and standing blood pressure decreased significantly) (p less than 0.001). As regards clinical tolerance, this was adequate although treatment had to be discontinued in three patients. The minor side effects observed in other patients did not necessitate withdrawal of therapy. Only minor changes of the biochemical parameters were observed. It may be concluded that some patients with mild to moderate hypertension can be adequately treated with a single daily dose of a fixed drug combination of oxprenolol and chlorthalidone.", 
    "78": "In a randomized cross-over study the acute effects of intravenous labetalol (1-2 mg/kg; mean dose 86.5 mg) were compared with those of diazoxide (3-5 mg/kg; mean dose 253.8 mg) in 13 severely hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure above 110 mm Hg (36.3 kPa) and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 165.4 mm Hg (22.0 kPa). Within five minutes following injection of both drugs an immediate fall in arterial pressure was observed (P less than 0.05), which was even more pronounced during subsequent minutes (P less than 0.01). The reduction in MAP after 30 minutes averaged 20% (P less than 0.01), with no significant differences between the drugs under trial or administration schedules. Diazoxide did not increase the heart rate as much as expected (P greater than 0.10), while labetalol slowed it down moderately but significantly (P less than 0.05). There were no notable changes in the blood levels of glucose and potassium and no particular side-effects were observed. It is concluded that the acute effects of intravenous labetalol are comparable to those of diazoxide and that labetalol can be used with advantage as a complemental alternative to diazoxide in the emergency treatment of some hypertensive crises."
