    "0": "Severe hypertension is a common clinical problem in the United States, encountered in various clinical settings. Although various terms have been applied to severe hypertension, such as hypertensive crises, emergencies, or urgencies, they are all characterized by acute elevations in BP that may be associated with end-organ damage (hypertensive crisis). The immediate reduction of BP is only required in patients with acute end-organ damage. Hypertension associated with cerebral infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage only rarely requires treatment. While nitroprusside is commonly used to treat severe hypertension, it is an extremely toxic drug that should only be used in rare circumstances. Furthermore, the short-acting calcium channel blocker nifedipine is associated with significant morbidity and should be avoided. Today, a wide range of pharmacologic alternatives are available to the practitioner to control severe hypertension. This article reviews some of the current concepts and common misconceptions in the management of patients with acutely elevated BP.", 
    "1": "To identify the localization and expression of bradykinin (BK)-B2 receptors in rat retina and examine the effects of BK on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity using cultured rat retinal neurons.", 
    "2": "An immunohistochemical study using a specific antibody against BK-B2 receptor was performed with rat retina. Primary cultures were obtained from the retina of fetal rats (gestation day 17-19). Expression of BK-B2 receptor mRNA was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using total RNA obtained from cultured retinal neurons. Cultured cells were exposed to glutamate (1 mM) for 10 minutes and followed by incubation in glutamate-free medium for 1 hour. The effects of BK were assessed by simultaneous application of BK with glutamate. The neurotoxic effects on retinal cultures were quantitatively assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method.", 
    "3": "Immunohistochemical study demonstrated that BK-B2 receptors were expressed in the ganglion cell, inner nuclear layers, and outer nuclear layers. Furthermore, BK-B2 receptor mRNA expression was observed in cultured retinal neurons. Cell viability was markedly reduced by 10-minute exposure to 1 mM glutamate followed by a 1-hour incubation in glutamate-free medium. Simultaneous application of BK at concentrations of 0.001 to 1 microM with glutamate demonstrated dose-dependent protection against glutamate neurotoxicity. The protective action of BK (1 microM) was inhibited by simultaneous application of BK-B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe140 (1 microM). Furthermore, 1 microM BK had protective effects on neurotoxicity induced by 1 microM ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 500 microM), a nitric oxide (NO)-generating agent. However, BK did not inhibit neurotoxicity induced by 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1, 10 microM), an NO and oxygen radical donor.", 
    "4": "These results suggest that BK-B2 receptors were distributed in rat retinas and cultured retinal neurons and that BK had a protective action against glutamate neurotoxicity through BK-B2 receptors in cultured retinal neurons. It is suggested that BK-induced protection against glutamate neurotoxicity took place downstream to NO generation and upstream to oxygen radical generation.", 
    "5": "Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) are commonly used in clinical pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases. Carvedilol and nebivolol possess beneficial effects on myocardial function in situations of oxidative stress associated with intracellular calcium overload. This preservation of contractile function might be due to direct scavenging capacities or to compensation of the intracellular calcium overload through direct impact on myofilament calcium sensitivity. Accordingly, we measured the relation between calcium and force in the absence and in the presence of 10(-6) M carvedilol, nebivolol, or propranolol in skinned right ventricular trabeculae of rabbit hearts. In rabbit myocardium, nebivolol (10(-6) M) altered the pCa50% by a rightward shift (less sensitive) from 5.72 +/- 0.05 to 5.57 +/- 0.05 (p < 0.05). Maximal force development was reduced by nebivolol. In contrast, the same concentration of propranolol or carvedilol did not influence calcium sensitivity and force development. In additional experiments, we repeated this protocol in trabeculae from human failing hearts. As in rabbit trabeculae, nebivolol shifted the pCa50% by 0.16 +/- 0.04 pCa units to the right (p < 0.05). Experiments with intact rabbit trabeculae confirmed depressed contractility: when all beta-adrenoceptors were blocked by 10(-6) M propranolol, subsequent addition of 10(-6) M nebivolol reduced developed force of these muscles significantly from 3.1 +/- 0.9 to 1.7 +/- 0.4 mN/mm2. We conclude that nebivolol desensitizes cardiac myofilaments slightly, whereas neither propranolol nor carvedilol had an effect.", 
    "6": "Carvedilol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with multiple actions, which may contribute to superior cardioprotection in heart failure and myocardial infarction. We hypothesized that carvedilol may modulate presynaptic norepinephrine release in the heart. Therefore, we compared the effects of carvedilol (racemate and both enantiomers) and beta1-selective as well as nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockers on norepinephrine release in isolated perfused rat hearts under normoxic and brief ischemic conditions. Exocytotic release of endogenous norepinephrine was induced by paired electric field stimulations to compare the release before (S1) and after (S2) beta-adrenoceptor blocker application. Metoprolol, bisoprolol, and pindolol (0.1-10 microM) had essentially no effect on exocytotic norepinephrine release under normoxic and ischemic conditions. In contrast, carvedilol exerted a biphasic concentration-response curve (increase followed by suppression) on norepinephrine release. The increase in norepinephrine release was more pronounced with R-carvedilol than with S-carvedilol, indicating an effect independent from beta-receptor antagonism. During ischemia, the facilitatory effect of carvedilol on norepinephrine release was lost, resulting in a concentration-dependent suppression of the release. These results indicate that carvedilol in contrast to classic beta1-selective and -nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockers has pronounced effects on cardiac norepinephrine release with a remarkable difference between normoxic and ischemic conditions. Whereas a facilitation of norepinephrine release prevailed in normoxia, we observed a suppression of the release in ischemia. It remains to be established whether this unique action of carvedilol on cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission is of clinical relevance.", 
    "7": "In has been found that sphingosine, propranolol, imipramine and phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, TPA) have a stimulatory effect on phospholipase D activity in glioma C6 cells. The cells were prelabelled with [1-(14)C]palmitic acid and phospholipase D-mediated synthesis of [(14)C]phosphatidylethanol was measured. The enhancing effect of TPA was almost completely blocked by a specific protein kinase C inhibitor, GF 109203X. In contrast, GF 109203X failed to inhibit the sphingosine, imipramine and propranolol stimulatory effects, indicating that their stimulation was independent of protein kinase C. The effect of TPA on phospholipase D was also blocked by imipramine and propranolol, whereas sphingosine additively potentiated TPA-mediated phospholipase D activity, both at shorter and longer (2-60 min) times of incubation. These results suggest that in glioma C6 cells, sphingosine is not only involved in a different phospholipase D activation than the TPA regulatory system, but also that it operates in a different compartment of the cell.", 
    "8": "In portal hypertension, the mechanisms responsible for nitric oxide (NO) overproduction and vasodilation have not yet been clearly identified. One hypothesis is that NO synthase (NOS) 3 is overactivated because of shear stress in endothelial cells caused by hyperkinetic circulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate aortic NOS3 after a reduction of blood flow by long-time beta-adrenoceptor antagonist administration.", 
    "9": "Propranolol or atenolol was administered by gavage in portal vein-stenosed and sham-operated rats. The vascular reactivity of thoracic aortic rings to phenylephrine, total aortic NOS activity, and aortic NOS3 messenger RNA and protein expressions were studied.", 
    "10": "After propranolol or atenolol administration, the aortic hyporesponse returned to normal in portal vein-stenosed rats. Total aortic NOS activity was higher in portal vein-stenosed aortas and significantly decreased after beta-blocker administration. Aortic NOS3 expressions were more marked in portal vein-stenosed aortas than in controls, but NOS3 expressions were reduced after propranolol administration.", 
    "11": "In portal hypertension, aortic NOS3 activity and expressions are enhanced but return to normal after beta-blocker administration. These results suggest that in portal hypertension, increased shear stress, related to high blood flow, induces enhanced aortic NOS3.", 
    "12": "Aseries of oxypropanolamine derivatives of 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine were synthesized and evaluated for inotropic, chronotropic and coronary vasodilating activities in the canine heart, affinity to beta(1)-adrenergic receptor in turkey erythrocytes and affinity to the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor in the rat lung. Among these compounds, 4-acetyl-6-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy)propoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine showed 2.1-fold more potent affinity to the beta(1) receptor than propranolol and 7-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy)propoxy-N-butyryl-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine showed 2.5-fold more potent affinity to the beta(2) receptor and furthermore 4386-fold more potent selectivity to the beta(2) receptor than propranolol. In addition, 4-acetyl-6-[3-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)amino-2-hydroxy]propoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine showed 1.1-fold more potent affinity to the beta(1) receptor than propranolol and also 1147-fold more potent selectivity to the beta(1) receptor. With a few exceptions, negative inotropic and chronotropic actions of these compounds were dependent on the size of the 4-substituent obeying the order: unsubstituted < acetyl < propanoyl < butanoyl, while the benzoyl substituent conferred even stronger negative actions in the 6-oxypropanolamine derivatives. Neither negative inotropic and chronotropic actions related with affinity to beta(1)-adrenoceptor nor coronary vasodilator action related with affinity to beta(2)-adrenoceptor were observed. 4-acetyl-7-[3-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)amino-2-hydroxy]propoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine exerted potent positive inotropic, chronotropic and coronary vasodilating actions. The inotropic and chronotropic actions of the latter compound may be attributed to the release of intrinsic catecholamines, as concluded by the absence of beta(1)-adrenoceptor affinity and disappearance of activity in the presence of a beta-blocker.", 
    "13": "Previous studies suggest that the antifibrillatory action of class I and III drugs is due to prolongation of the atrial wavelength. The aim of the present study was to directly evaluate the electrophysiological action of antifibrillatory drugs in a goat model of chronic atrial fibrillation (AF).", 
    "14": "Six goats were instrumented with multiple atrial electrodes, and sustained AF was induced by electrical remodeling. During sustained AF, the effects of intravenous infusion of cibenzoline, hydroquinidine, flecainide, and d-sotalol on AF cycle length (AFCL), refractory period (RP(AF)), conduction velocity (CV(AF)), pathlength (PL(AF)), wavelength (WL(AF)), temporal (AFCL-RP(AF)), and spatial (PL(AF)-WL(AF)) excitable gap were studied. The RP(AF) was measured by determining the earliest moment at which single stimuli could capture the fibrillating atria. CV(AF) was measured during regional entrainment of AF. Contrary to our expectation, cardioversion of AF could not be attributed to prolongation of WL(AF). Hydroquinidine and d-sotalol did not affect WL(AF) significantly, whereas cibenzoline and flecainide even shortened WL(AF) by 18% and 36%, respectively. PL(AF) was increased by hydroquinidine and d-sotalol by 30%, whereas cibenzoline and flecainide did not prolong PL(AF). The only parameter that correlated consistently with cardioversion of AF was a widening of the temporal excitable gap (cibenzoline 176%, hydroquinidine 105%, flecainide 86%, d-sotalol 88%).", 
    "15": "Pharmacological cardioversion of AF cannot be explained by prolongation of WL(AF). An alternative explanation for the antifibrillatory effect of class I and III drugs may be a widening of the temporal excitable gap.", 
    "16": "Both retrospective studies and prospective randomized trials have shown that beta-blockers improve survival and reduce the risk of reinfarction in patients with myocardial infarction. To evaluate whether beta-blockers exert similar protective benefits during and after coronary intervention, we studied the incidence of postprocedure creatine kinase (CK)-MB elevation in patients with or without prior beta-blocker therapy and its effect on intermediate-term ( approximately 1 year) survival.", 
    "17": "We prospectively analyzed 1675 consecutive patients undergoing coronary intervention; of these patients, 643 (38.4%) were on beta-blocker therapy before the intervention. The incidence of CK-MB elevation after coronary intervention was 13.2% in patients on beta-blocker therapy before intervention and 22.1% in patients who were not on beta-blockers (P<0.001). Patients with prior beta-blocker therapy had lower persistent/recurrent postprocedure chest pain and lower preprocedure and postprocedure heart rates and mean blood pressures compared with patients who were not on beta-blockers (P<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed prior beta-blocker therapy as the sole independent factor for lower CK-MB release after coronary intervention. During intermediate-term follow-up at 15+/-3 months, patients on beta-blocker therapy before intervention had lower mortality rates compared with those not on beta-blockers (0.78% versus 1.96%; P=0. 04), although the benefit was independent of the reduction in CK-MB release.", 
    "18": "Our nonrandomized, prospective analysis suggests that prior beta-blocker therapy has a cardioprotective effect in limiting CK-MB release after coronary intervention and that it is associated with a lower mortality at intermediate-term follow-up.", 
    "19": "To determine the role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in propranolol transport in cultured rabbit conjunctival epithelial cell layers (RCEC).", 
    "20": "The localization of P-gp in the cultured RCEC as well as in the excised conjunctiva was determined by immunofluorescence technique. The role of P-gp in transepithelial transport and uptake of propranolol in conjunctival epithelial cells cultured on Transwell filters was evaluated in the presence and absence of P-gp competing substrates, an anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody (4E3 mAb), or a metabolic inhibitor, 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP).", 
    "21": "Immunofluorescence studies revealed positive staining in the apical membrane of cultured RCEC and in the apical surface of the superficial cell layers in the excised conjunctiva, but not the basolateral membrane of cultured RCEC. Transport of propranolol showed preference in the basolateral-to-apical direction. The net secretory flux was saturable with a Km of 71.5 +/- 24.0 nM and a Jmax of 1.45 +/- 0.17 pmol/cm2/hr. Cyclosporin A, progesterone, rhodamine 123, verapamil, 4E3 mAb and 2,4-DNP all increased apical 50 nM propranolol uptake by 43% to 66%. On the other hand, neither beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, and alprenolol) nor organic cation transporter substrates (tetraethylammonium (TEA) and guanidine), affected apical 50 nM propranolol uptake.", 
    "22": "The energy-dependent efflux pump P-gp appears to be predominantly located on the apical plasma membrane of the conjunctival epithelium. It may play an important role in restricting the conjunctival absorption of some lipophilic drugs.", 
    "23": "In addition to having anti-sympathotonic effects, beta-blockers are thought to have some adrenoceptor-independent properties. Such ancillary effects are described for carvedilol acting as oxygen radical scavenger and for propranolol which blocks protein kinase C and phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. The goal of our in vitro experiments was to identify ancillary effects of the widely used beta-blockers metoprolol and atenolol in neutrophils. Neutrophil chemotaxis was tested using the leading front assay in a modified Boyden microchemotaxis chamber. Respiratory burst activity was detected fluorometrically. Inhibition of protein kinase C activity was tested with purified alpha-, beta- and gamma-isoenzyme preparation. Metoprolol dose-dependently inhibited formyl peptide-stimulated neutrophil chemotaxis and formylpeptide- and phorbol myristate acetate-triggered oxygen free radical production. These actions were not affected by the competitive presence of the beta-receptor agonist, orciprenaline. Effects of metoprolol, as well as of propranolol, and the signaling enzyme blockers were strongly time dependent. Propranolol mimicked effects of staurosporine on respiratory burst, whereas the effects of metoprolol were similar to bisindolylmaleimide, a specific protein kinase C blocker. Atenolol, a hydrophilic beta-blocker, neither affected neutrophil chemotaxis nor respiratory burst. In a cell-free system, metoprolol did not interfere with the activity of the purified protein kinase C alpha-, beta- and gamma-isoenzymes. Adrenoceptor-independent inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis and free radical production is a novel mode of action of metoprolol that may be relevant for beneficial effects ot the beta-blocker in heart failure and endothelial preconditioning.", 
    "24": "SK&F 96365 (1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxyl]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imid azole hydrochloride) is widely used as an effective inhibitor of receptor-linked and capacitative Ca2+ entry. Since this inhibitor has additional effects such as inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, sarco- and endoplasmic reticula Ca2+ pumps and cell proliferation, its molecular mechanism of action remains to be solved. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of SK&F 96365 on microtubule protein isolated from bovine brain in vitro. SK&F 96365 depolymerized the polymerized microtubules in a concentration-dependent manner. This result suggests that SK&F 96365 directly depolymerizes microtubules, an effect that may contribute to the various actions of this compound.", 
    "25": "We previously reported a highly sensitive chemiluminescence high-performance liquid chromatographic method to determine catecholamines in plasma. In this study, we employed this method to measure the cardiac function and plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration in conscious rats. Benidipine, 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (4 mg/kg), and beta-blocker (propranolol, 30 mg/kg) were administered orally to conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, and blood pressure, heart rate and plasma NE levels were measured. Plasma NE concentration was used as an index of sympathetic nervous system activity in conscious rats. The basal plasma NE levels were significantly higher in SHRs than in WKY rats (P<0.05), indicating the activity of the basal sympathetic nervous system in SHRs was elevated. The sensitivity of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic nervous response was reduced in SHRs as compared to that in WKY rats. The concomitant administration of benidipine and a beta-blocker decreased heart rate without affecting the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic nervous response, indicating that propranolol might suppress mainly the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor. The present study suggested the high activity of the basal sympathetic nervous system and the reduced response of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic nervous system in SHRs compared to WKY rats in the conscious condition.", 
    "26": "To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction by latanoprost and timolol, and to study factors of prognostic value for assessing this reduction.", 
    "27": "We analyzed 829 patients included in three phase 111 studies comparing six months' treatment with 0.005% latanoprost once daily and 0.5% timolol twice daily in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Analysis of covariance controlled for differences in baseline IOP and sex was used to assess the IOP reduction.", 
    "28": "Latanoprost reduced diurnal IOP (average of morning, noon and afternoon assessments) by 7.7 mmHg (31%) and timolol by 6.5 mmHg (26%) after six months of treatment. Thus the diurnal IOP was reduced 1.2 mmHg (18%) more with latanoprost than with timolol (p<0.001). Latanoprost-treated patients showed a further decrease in morning IOP of 0.7 mmHg (9%, p<0.001) from the initial morning IOP reduction obtained at two weeks. No such further decrease in IOP was seen with timolol. Higher baseline diurnal IOP resulted in a larger diurnal reduction during treatment with both drugs (p<0.001). Diurnal IOP in women was reduced 0.7 mmHg (11%) less than males with both drugs (p<0.001).", 
    "29": "Latanoprost was more effective than timolol in reducing mean diurnal IOP. The effect after two weeks was maintained for timolol while with latanoprost there was a further, significant IOP reduction from two weeks to six months. Baseline IOP was the only factor of clinical importance found to be of prognostic value for assessing the IOP reduction.", 
    "30": "A 72-year old male with an old myocardial infarction who had drug-refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient did not take his prescribed beta-blocking agent for two days, following which he experienced six discrete shocks for spontaneous VT while riding his bicycle. Both 5J and 30J cardioversions were ineffective at terminating the VT and accelerated VT developed following the shocks. After admission, an electrophysiological study was performed while he was taking the beta-blocking agent, both low and high energy cardioversions reproducibly terminated the clinical VT without showing any accelerated rhythm. These findings suggest that the increase in sympathetic discharge may enhance the proarrhythmic potential of ICDs.", 
    "31": "Cardiovascular death continues to be a major problem in renal failure. Structural abnormalities of the heart and the vasculature contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk. They are ameliorated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, but because of the nonspecifity of ACE inhibition, it is uncertain whether the beneficial effect is mediated by interfering with angiotensin II (Ang II) or by modulating other effector systems, for example, bradykinin.", 
    "32": "To assess a potential role of bradykinin, subtotally nephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats (SNX) received either the ACE inhibitor Ramipril (Rami, 0.2 mg/kg body weight p.o.), the specific B2 bradykinin receptor antagonist Hoe140 (0.2 mg/kg body weight, s.c.), or a combination of both, and were compared to sham-operated controls. To separately assess the effect of Ramipril on development and reversal of structural abnormalities, animals were either treated from the third day after SNX or from the fourth week after SNX onward (0.01 mg/kg body weight, p.o.).", 
    "33": "Heart and aorta were evaluated by morphometric and stereologic techniques. The weight of the perfused left ventricle, as an index of cardiac hypertrophy, was significantly higher in untreated SNX. While it was significantly lower in animals with early and late Ramipril treatment, the beneficial effect was completely antagonized by Hoe140. The wall-to-lumen ratio of intramyocardial arterioles was significantly higher in untreated SNX compared with controls, but failed to be modified by administration of either Ramipril or Hoe140. In the heart, the intercapillary distance was significantly higher in SNX, but it was not lowered by either early or late Ramipril or Hoe140 treatment. Treatment of SNX with Hoe140 alone, however, resulted in a marked further increase in intercapillary distance. The wall thickness of the aorta was significantly higher in SNX than in controls; early and late Ramipril treatment prevented such increase, and this effect was antagonized by Hoe140.", 
    "34": "These findings illustrate that bradykinin plays an important role for the beneficial effect of Ramipril in preventing (and potentially reversing) abnormal cardiovascular structure in uremic hypertensive rats.", 
    "35": "Hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous disease, both clinically and genetically. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy(HCM) is important causes of sudden cardiac death and death from congestive heart failure, although HCM has a relatively benign prognosis. The prognosis of dilated cardiomyopathy(DCM) has improved due to advances in earlier diagnosis and therapy, however, sudden cardiac death and death from congestive heart failure still occur in DCM. Accordingly, it is of importance to know possible risk factors on risk stratification for a high-risk group in HCM and DCM. Possible risk factors may contribute to the construction of therapeutic strategies for the prevention of sudden cardiac death or death from congestive heart failure in patients with HCM and DCM.", 
    "36": "Newer drug therapy for patients with cardiomyopathies has been introduced with standard one. Beta-blocker therapy improves the prognosis in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic DCM and even in asymptomatic ones with LV dysfunction. The combined therapy of ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker, the intermittent intravenous infusion of inotropic agents and the supplement of phosphodiesterase inhibitor on induction of beta-blocker therapy also elucidate the effectiveness in DCM patients.", 
    "37": "The effects of drug treatment on cardiac events for 11 years from January 1986 to December 1996 were investigated in 1,483 patients with myocardial infarction, 1,164 men and 319 women (mean age 60.1 +/- 11.2 years), followed up for 17.4 +/- 20.9 months. Seventy-one patients (4.8%, 33 cases per 1,000 person-year) had cardiac events (recurrent myocardial infarction, sudden death and death by congestive heart failure). Multivariate analysis showed treatment with cholesterol lowering agents and beta-blockers reduced cardiac events, whereas administration of antiarrhythmic agents increased cardiac events. Univariate analysis showed that the incidence of cardiac events was 2.2% in patients treated with cholesterol lowering agents but 6.2% in patients without treatment, showing a significant difference (p < 0.01). The incidence was 3.2% for patients treated with beta-blockers and 6.8% for those without (p < 0.01), showing that beta-blockers were also effective to reduce cardiac events. Antiplatelet agents were also effective (3.7% vs 7.1%, p < 0.01). Calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and warfarin were not effective. Nitrates (6.0% vs 3.1%, p < 0.01) and antiarrhythmic agents (13.7% vs 3.6%, p < 0.01) increased the incidence of cardiac events. A placebo-controlled, double blind, large clinical multicenter study is required to confirm these results.", 
    "38": "Compounds varying in selectivity as 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists have recently been reported to produce benzodiazepine-like antianxiety effects in mice. To assess the cross-species generality of these findings, the present experiments compared the effects of diazepam (0.625-5 mg/kg) with those of several non-selective (MM-77, 0.03-1 mg/kg and pindobind-5-HT(1A), 0.1-5 mg/kg) and selective (WAY100635, 0.01-10 mg/kg, p-MPPI, 0.01-3 mg/kg and SL88.0338, 0.3-10 mg/kg) 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists in three well-validated anxiolytic screening tests in rats: punished lever-pressing, punished drinking, and the elevated plus-maze. In the punished lever-pressing conflict test, none of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists modified rates of punished responding, whereas in the punished drinking test, WAY100635 (0.3-1 mg/kg), SL88.0338 (3-10 mg/kg), p-MPPI (1 mg/kg), MM-77 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), but not pindobind-5-HT(1A), produced clear anticonflict activity. However, the increase in punished responding with the 5-HT(1A) compounds was smaller than that produced by diazepam, indicating weaker anxiolytic-like activity. In the elevated plus-maze test, WAY100635 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg), SL88.0338 (0.3-10 mg/kg), MM-77 (0.01-3 mg/kg), pindobind-5-HT(1A) (0.1-3 mg/kg), but not p-MPPI, showed anxiolytic-like activity on traditional behavioral indices, increasing the percentage of time spent in open arms and the percentage of open arm entries. As was the case in the punished drinking test, the magnitude of the positive effects of the 5-HT(1A) compounds was generally smaller than that of diazepam. Of the ethological measures recorded in the plus-maze, all compounds markedly decreased risk assessment (i.e. attempts) over the entire dose-range, but only diazepam clearly increased directed exploration (i.e. head-dipping). Although the present results demonstrate that 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists elicit anxiolytic-like effects in rats, this action appears to be test-specific and, unlike previous findings in mice, smaller than that observed with benzodiazepines. The data are discussed in relation to the possible relevance of species differences in 5-HT(1A) receptor function and the nature of the anxiety response studied.", 
    "39": "Gentamicin is an antibiotic effective against gram negative infections, whose clinical use is limited by its nephrotoxicity. Since the pathogenesis of gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity involves oxygen free radicals, the antioxidant carvedilol may protect against gentamicin-induced renal toxicity. We therefore tested this hypothesis using a rat model of gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Carvedilol (2 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 3 days before and 8 days concurrently with gentamicin (80 mg/kg BW). Estimations of urine creatinine, glucose, blood urea, serum creatinine, plasma and kidney tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) were carried out, after the last dose of gentamicin. Kidneys were also examined for morphological changes. Gentamicin caused marked nephrotoxicity as evidenced by increase in blood urea, serum creatinine and decreased in creatinine clearance. Blood urea and serum creatinine was increased by 883% and 480% respectively with gentamicin compared to control. Carvedilol protected the rats from gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity. Rise in blood urea, serum creatinine and decrease in creatinine clearance was significantly prevented by carvedilol. There was 190% and 377% rise in plasma and kidney tissue MDA with gentamicin. Carvedilol prevented the gentamicin induced rise in both plasma and kidney tissue MDA. Kidney from gentamicin treated rats, histologically showed necrosis and desquamation of tubular epithelial cells in renal cortex, whereas it was very much comparable to control with carvedilol. In conclusion, carvedilol with its antioxidant property protected the rats from gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity.", 
    "40": "The atypical neuroleptics, clozapine and olanzapine, have superior therapeutic efficacy against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, compared with the typical neuroleptics. Recently, it has been suggested that the ability of clozapine and olanzapine to induce Fos expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), contribute to their therapeutic efficacy. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuropharmacological effects of clozapine and olanzapine in the mPFC remain elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that clozapine- and olanzapine-induced Fos expression in the mPFC are inhibited by propranolol. We also show that clozapine and olanzapine induce Fos expression in the locus coeruleus. These results suggest that clozapine and olanzapine increase noradrenaline release by stimulating noradrenergic neuronal activity in the locus coeruleus and, consequently, increased noradrenaline induce Fos expression in the mPFC via beta-adrenergic receptors. This postulated sequence may be one of mechanisms by which clozapine-like atypical neuroleptics are more effective for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.", 
    "41": "Previous studies have suggested that women with acute myocardial infarction receive less aggressive therapy than men. We used data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project to determine whether women and men who were ideal candidates for therapy after acute myocardial infarction were treated differently.", 
    "42": "Information was abstracted from the charts of 138,956 Medicare beneficiaries (49 percent of them women) who had an acute myocardial infarction in 1994 or 1995.

The difference was especially pronounced among older women; for a woman 85 years of age or older, the adjusted relative risk was 0.75 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.83). Women were somewhat less likely than men to receive thrombolytic therapy within 60 minutes (adjusted relative risk, 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 0.96) or to receive aspirin within 24 hours after arrival at the hospital (adjusted relative risk, 0.96; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 0.97), but they were equally likely to receive beta-blockers (adjusted relative risk, 0.99; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.03) and somewhat more likely to receive angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (adjusted relative risk, 1.05; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.08).

The study examines beta-adrenoceptor-G-protein coupling and intrinsic activity of bucindolol, carvedilol and metoprolol in human ventricular myocardium. 3. Radioligand binding studies ([(125)I]-Iodocyanopindolol) were performed in membrane preparations of human failing and nonfailing myocardium. Functional experiments were carried out in isolated muscle preparations of human left ventricular myocardium from failing hearts. 4. Bucindolol and carvedilol bound non-selectively to beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors and exerted guanine nucleotide modulatable binding. Metoprolol was 35-fold beta(1)-selective and lacked guanine nucleotide modulatable binding. 5. All beta-blockers antagonized isoprenaline-induced enhancement of contractility. 6. In preparations in which the coupling of the stimulatory G-protein to adenylate cyclase was facilitated by forskolin, bucindolol increased force of contraction in three and decreased it in five experiments. Carvedilol increased force in one and decreased it in six experiments. Metoprolol decreased force in all experiments by 89. 4+/-2.2% (P<0.01 metoprolol vs carvedilol and bucindolol). The negative inotropic effect of metoprolol was antagonized by bucindolol. 7. It is concluded that differences in intrinsic activity can be detected in human myocardium and have an impact on cardiac contractility. In human ventricular myocardium, bucindolol displays substantially higher intrinsic activity than metoprolol and carvedilol. Bucindolol can behave as partial agonist or partial inverse agonist depending on the examined tissue. 8. Differences in intrinsic activity may contribute to differences in beta-adrenoceptor regulation and possibly to differences in tolerability and outcomes of patients with heart failure.",

The mechanisms underlying vasodilator effect of nicotine on mesenteric resistance blood vessels and the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing (CGRPergic) vasodilator nerves were studied in the rat. 2. Mesenteric vascular beds isolated from Wistar rats were perfused with Krebs solution, and perfusion pressure was measured with a pressure transducer. 3. In preparations with intact endothelium and contracted by perfusion with Krebs solution containing methoxamine, perfusion of nicotine (1 - 100 microM) for 1 min caused a concentration-dependent vasodilator response without vasoconstriction. 4. The nicotine-induced vasodilation was markedly inhibited by hexamethonium (nicotinic cholinoceptor antagonist, 10 microM) and blocked by guanethidine (adrenergic neuron blocker, 5 microM). 5. Either denervation by cold storage (4 degrees C for 72 h) or adrenergic denervation by 6-hydroxydopamine (toxin for adrenergic neurons, 2 mM for 20 min incubation, twice) blocked the nicotine-induced vasodilation. 6. Neither endothelium removal with perfusion of sodium deoxycholate (1.80 mg ml(-1), for 30 s) nor treatment with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 100 microM), atropine (muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonist, 10 nM) or propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, 100 nM) affected the nicotine-induced vasodilation. 7. In preparations without endothelium, treatment with capsaicin (depleting CGRP-containing sensory nerves, 1 microM) or human CGRP[8 - 37] (CGRP receptor antagonist, 0.5 microM) markedly inhibited the nicotine-induced vasodilation. 8. These results suggest that, in the mesenteric resistanc artery of the rat, nicotine induces vasodilation, which is independent of the function of the endothelium and is involved in activation of CGRPergic nerves. It is also suggested that nicotine stimulates presynaptic nicotinic cholinoceptors on adrenergic nerves to release adrenergic neurotransmitters, which then act on CGRPergic nerves to release endogenous CGRP from the nerve.", 
    "52": "Briefly after withdrawal of the (T-type) calcium channel blocker mibefradil from the market, four cases of life-threatening interaction of mibefradil with dihydropyridines were reported. We investigated in vitro whether mibefradil interacts with a dihydropyridine, as described for other non-dihydropyridine compounds. Rat working hearts were used to examine functional interactions between amlodipine and mibefradil. Gallopamil and another T-type-channel blocker, ethosuximide, were included for comparison. Effects of mibefradil, (+)- and (-)-gallopamil on [3H](+)-isradipine binding were studied in membranes from tsA201-cells transfected with alpha(1c)-, alpha(2)delta-, and beta(1a)- or beta(2a)-calcium channel subunits. Mibefradil increased negative inotropic effect of amlodipine, but not of gallopamil. Gallopamil and ethosuximide showed no influence on contractile effects of amlodipine. Furthermore, mibefradil concentration-dependently caused bradycardic rhythm disturbance. The same type of arrhythmia was observed combining low concentrations of mibefradil with amlodipine, or with gallopamil, respectively. Amlodipine alone, or the combination of gallopamil or ethosuximide with amlodipine did not cause any arrhythmia. Binding studies showed a concentration-dependent positive allosteric interaction between [3H](+)-isradipine and mibefradil, but not with [3H](+)-isradipine and gallopamil enantiomers. Molecular and functional evidence points to an interaction between a dihydropyridine and mibefradil. Mibefradil caused rhythm disturbances and potentiation of negative inotropy when combined with amlodipine.", 
    "53": "Previous studies in asthmatic subjects and guinea pigs have demonstrated attenuation of bronchoconstriction in repeated exposures to clean cold dry air. In the present animal study, we have simulated short-lasting human exposures to subfreezing urban air containing sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)). The anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated guinea pigs had 4 consecutive 10-min exposures either to clean cold dry air or to cold air with graded concentrations of SO(2) (0-5 ppm) or NO(2) (0-4 ppm). Peak expiratory flow (PEF) and tidal volume (V(T)) were continuously measured both during and after highly controlled exposures. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and histological samples were obtained after finishing the consecutive exposures. Cold air + SO(2) at 1 and 2.5 ppm (n = 12) produced immediate concentration-dependent increases in the lung function responses compared to the preceding single exposure to clean cold dry air in the same animals (DeltaPEF = -32.7 +/- 6.1% and -35.6 +/- 6.5% vs. -27.0 +/- 3.1%; DeltaV(T) = -22.4 +/- 4.4% and -28.3 +/- 4.7% vs. -18.1 +/- 2.9%). In a multivariate analysis, these responses were significantly larger than the attenuated lung function responses to the corresponding second and third clean cold dry air exposures (p <. 05). The fourth exposure to cold air + SO(2) at 5 ppm produced a smaller response (DeltaPEF = -25.3 +/- 4.8% and DeltaV(T) = -17.8 +/- 3.7%) than cold air with the lower SO(2) concentrations. Cold air + NO(2) at 1 and 2.5 ppm (n = 12) produced roughly similar lung function responses to the preceding single exposure to clean cold dry air in the same animals, and there was no significant attenuation of bronchoconstriction as with the consecutive exposures to clean cold dry air. The largest decreases in lung functions (DeltaPEF = -33.8 +/- 6.7% and DeltaV(T) = -26.2 +/- 6.8%) were recorded during the fourth exposure, which was to cold air + NO(2) at 4 ppm. In the cold air + SO(2) group, there was a significantly lower proportion of macrophages in the differential count of BALF white cells compared to the clean cold dry air group. In addition, there was eosinophilic infiltration within and below the tracheal epithelium in all guinea pigs exposed to either clean cold dry air, cold air + SO(2), or cold air + NO(2). In conclusion, the addition of moderate concentrations of SO(2) or NO(2) to clean cold dry air counteracted the attenuation of bronchoconstriction induced by repeated cold dry air exposures in guinea pigs. Cold air + SO(2) also decreased the proportion of macrophages in BALF white cells.", 
    "54": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the respiratory effects of single and repeated controlled exposures to clean warm humid and cold dry air in a new model of anesthetized, mechanically ventilated guinea pigs, and to compare findings with known effects in humans. Intratracheal air (T(tr)) and retrotracheal tissue (T(oe)) temperatures and peak expiratory airflow (PEF), tidal volume (V(T)), heart rate, and blood pressure of hyperventilating animals were measured continuously. Four consecutive 10-min exposures to warm humid air (n = 7) produced slight airway warming and minimal lung function changes during the exposure. In a single 10-min exposure to cold dry air (n = 39), T(tr) decreased from (means +/- SEM) 36.1 +/- 0.3 degrees C to 26.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C (Delta = -9.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C) and T(oe) from 36.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C to 35.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C (Delta = -0.9 +/- 0.1 degrees C). PEF and V(T) decreased in response to airway cooling with maximal decrements within the first 2-4 min from the beginning of the exposure period. The maximal decrease in PEF was from 21.7 +/- 0.3 ml s(-1) to 15.9 +/- 0.5 ml s(-1) (Delta = -26.7%) and that in V(T) from 5.2 +/- 0.1 ml to 4.2 +/- 0.1 ml (Delta = -19.2%) (p <.05 for both changes). The decreases in lung functions attenuated significantly during the course of the 10-min exposure to cold dry air, indicating adaptation. Consequently, the decrements in PEF and V(T) at 5, 7.5, and 10 min were significantly smaller than those at 3 min. In four consecutive 10-min exposures to cold dry air (n = 15), there were no statistically significant differences in T(tr) or T(oe) decreases between the exposure periods. The largest decreases in the lung function parameters were during the first exposure period, whereas there were significantly smaller responses during the second and third exposure periods (p <.05). Thus, a highly reproducible airway cooling and an immediate bronchoconstriction were produced in response to cold dry air hyperventilation in guinea pigs. During the course of cold-air exposure and in repeated exposures, there was a significant attenuation of the bronchial response, which resembled the refractoriness of the asthmatic airways to repeated hyperventilation of cold or warm dry air. The present guinea pig model seems to be well suited for production of complementary animal data on the pathophysiological effects of cold dry air on the tracheobronchial airways.",

In this study the elution range and the prediction of octanol-water partitioning for the DDCV micellar system was examined. Through incorporation of DDCV in mixed micelles and unilamellar vesicles, enhancement of the elution range was observed. The mixed micelles contained a second anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), while the vesicles were composed of DDCV and the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Enantioselectivity, as well as other chromatographic and electrophoretic parameters, were compared between the mixed micelles, vesicles, and DDCV micelles. The hydrophobicity of the DDCV system was also evaluated as a predictor of n-octanol-water partition coefficients for 15 beta amino alcohols. The correlation between the logarithm of the retention factor (log k) and log P(ow) for seven hydrophobic beta-blockers and eight beta-agonists were r2 = 0.964 and r2 = 0.814, respectively.", 
    "56": "The capillary electrophoretic separation of cationic enantiomers with single-isomer multivalent anionic resolving agents was reexamined with the help of the charged resolving agent migration model. Three general model parameters were identified that influence the shape of the separation selectivity and enantiomer mobility difference curves: parameter b, the binding selectivity (K(RCD)/K(SCD)), parameter s, the size selectivity (mu0(RCD)/mu0(SCD)), and parameter a, the complexation-induced alteration of the analyte's mobility (mu0(RCD)/mu0). In addition to the previously observed discontinuity in separation selectivity that occurs as mu(eff) of the less mobile enantiomer changes from cationic to anionic, a new feature, a separation selectivity maximum was predicted to occur in the resolving agent concentration range where both enantiomers migrate cationically provided that (i) K(RCD)/K(SCD) <1 and mu0(RCD)/mu0(SCD) >1 and (K(RCD)mu0(RCD))/(K(SCD)mu0(SCD)) > 1, or (ii) K(RCD)/K(SCD) >1 and mu0(RCD)/mu0(SCD) <1 and (K(RCD)mu0(RCD))/(K(SCD)mu0(SCD)) <1. This hitherto unseen separation selectivity pattern was experimentally verified during the nonaqueous capillary electrophoretic separation of the enantiomers of four weak base analytes in acidic methanol background electrolytes with octakis(2,3-diacetyl-6-sulfato)-gamma-cyclodextrin (ODAS-gammaCD) as resolving agent.",

A new DOI-CE separation mode based on electrokinetic chromatography is also introduced (DOI-EKC). Whereas conventional CZE and DOI-CZE are limited to the separation of charged compounds with different electrophoretic mobilities, DOI-EKC is shown to be capable of separating compounds with the same or similar electrophoretic mobilities. In contrast to conventional EKC with charged pseudostationary phases that often interact too strongly with analytes of opposite charge, the neutral pseudostationary phases appropriate for DOI-EKC are simultaneously compatible with anionic and cationic compounds. This work describes two buffer additives that dynamically suppress electroosmotic flow (EOF) at a higher pH (6.5) than in a previous study (4.4), thus allowing DOI-CZE of several pharmaceutical bases and weakly acidic positional isomers. Several DOI-EKC systems based on nonionic (10 lauryl ether, Brij 35) or zwitterionic (SB-12, CAS U) micelles, or nonionic vesicles (Brij 30) are examined using a six-component test mixture that is difficult to separate by CZE or DOI-CZE.

    "64": "The aim of this study was to develop methods for the design of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) tablets with specified drug profiles. This was achieved by the use of a mathematical model developed to predict the release kinetics of water-soluble drugs from HPMC matrices. The required model parameters were determined experimentally for propranolol HCl and chlorpheniramine maleate in 0. 1 N HCl and phosphate buffer pH 7.4, respectively. Then, the effects of the dimensions and aspect ratio (radius/height) of the tablets on the drug release rate were evaluated. Independent experiments were conducted to verify the theoretical predictions. Acceptable agreement between theory and experiment was found, irrespective of the type of release medium and drug. However, statistical analysis revealed a structure in the resulting residuals. Drug release rates are overestimated at the beginning and underestimated at the end of the process. Possible explanations and modifications of the model are thoroughly discussed. Both, theoretical and experimental data showed that a broad spectrum of drug release patterns can be achieved by varying the size and shape of the tablet. The effect of the initial matrix radius on release was found to be more pronounced than the effect of the initial thickness. The practical benefit of the proposed method is to predict the required size and shape of new controlled drug delivery systems to achieve desired release profiles, thus significantly facilitating the development of new pharmaceutical products.",

KB-R7943 (0.03- 3 micromol) induced negative inotropic effects and negative followed by positive chronotropic effects in the right atrium and negative inotropic effects in the left ventricle. Neither atropine nor hexamethonium affected the cardiac responses to KB-R7943. Propranolol attenuated the positive chronotropic response to KB-R7943 but imipramine did not. Tetrodotoxin potentiated the positive chronotropic response to KB-R7943 in 6 of 11 isolated atria. When NaCl infusion increased atrial contractile force and atrial rate, KB-R7943-induced negative inotropic and chronotropic responses were attenuated in a dose-dependent manner. CaCl2 infusion potentiated the negative chronotropic response to KB-R7943 but did not affect the inotropic response significantly. On the other hand, ouabain (17 nmol) attenuated the negative inotropic response, but not chronotropic response, to KB-R7943. These results suggest that KB-R7943-induced cardiac effects relate to the Na+ activity, probably mediated through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger modifies the pacemaker activity and myocardial contractility in the dog heart.",

    "71": "The release of leptin by pieces of human adipose tissue incubated in primary culture for 24 or 48 hours in the presence of dexamethasone was reduced by isoproterenol. An inhibition of leptin release was observed at 24 hours in the presence of isoproterenol and was mediated by beta1-adrenergic receptors, since it was blocked by the specific beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP-20712A. The inhibitory effect of 33 nmol/L isoproterenol on leptin release was reversed in the presence of 0.1 nmol/L insulin to a 2-fold stimulation of leptin release. These data suggest that the primary mechanism by which insulin stimulates leptin release is to blunt the inhibitory effects of beta1-adrenergic receptor agonists, and low concentrations of catecholamines actually enhance the stimulation of leptin release by insulin.",

    "73": "Effect of a nonspecific beta adrenergic blocker - propranolol (40 mg per os) on thermoregulatory responses of cold water immersed (12.5 degrees C) humans was studied. Propranolol attenuates resting and cold induced thermogenesis, rectal temperature, heart rate and systolic blood pressure, but increases production of adrenaline and cortisol. Propranolol has no effect on the threshold body temperature for induction of cold thermogenesis and on central thermosensitivity. The following conclusions are drawn from consideration of the data presented: During the early phase of cooling (20 min after the start of cooling) the thermogenesis mediated by beta adrenergic receptors may cover about 80% of the total metabolic increase induced by cold. After about 30 min of cooling the relative proportion of beta adrenergic thermogenesis starts to decline, reaching 20% of the total cold thermogenesis at the end of cooling.It can be suggested from consideration of the data that, in man, the beta adrenergic receptors in the heart, blood vessels, adipocytes and muscles participate in mediating effect of cold on cardiovascular and thermoregulatory responses. Furthermore, these data imply that human adrenergic thermogenesis is produced outside of the brown adipose tissue. Thus, physiological mechanisms mediating adrenergic thermogenesis in humans appear to be different from those in small mammals.",

The effect on [Ca(2+)](i) of mastoparan and of PTTH was inhibited by cadmium and the antagonist of T-type calcium channels, amiloride, and not influenced by the L-type calcium channel blocker nitrendipine, suggesting that the same or similar plasma membrane channels are involved in the action of mastoparan and of PTTH. Pertussis toxin prevented the mastoparan-induced increase of [Ca(2+)](i), whereas the effect of PTTH is not influenced by pertussis toxin. Intracellular addition of GDP-beta-S failed to inhibit the PTTH-stimulated increase in [Ca(2+)](i) suggesting that G proteins are not involved in the stimulatory mechanism of PTTH.",

However, the neural mechanisms by which CCK controls motility are not well known. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between CCK and the enteric nervous system through the study of the effects of CCK-8 on ascending excitation. Anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared with a strain-gauge sutured to the duodenum wall. An electrode holder was placed in the duodenum lumen to elicit ascending contraction. Electrical field stimulation of the duodenal mucosa (4 Hz, 0.6 ms, 30 V) induced an ascending excitation which was blocked by hexamethonium (10 mg kg-1; n=5) and atropine (0.3 mg kg-1; n=5), but enlarged by L-NNA (10(-5) mol kg-1; n=5). CCK-8 (3 \u00bf 10(-9) mol kg-1 10 min-1) blocked ascending excitation and an inhibition of the induced phasic activity was observed instead (n=18). Individually, none of the CCK receptor antagonists (L-364 718 and L-365 260) (3 \u00bf 10(-7) mol kg-1; n=6 each) blocked the inhibition of ascending excitation induced by CCK-8. However, simultaneous infusion of both antagonists abolished CCK-8 effect on electrical stimulation (n=5). Similarly, none of the CCK-8 agonists (A-71623, A-71378, gastrin) modified the ascending excitation. In contrast, the simultaneous infusion of A-71623 and CCK-4 (n=4) induced an effect similar to CCK-8. In conclusion, CCK-8 blocked ascending contraction elicited by electrical field stimulation of duodenal mucosa by means of simultaneous activation of CCK-A and CCK-B receptors.",

Using manometric pullthroughs and a sleeve sensor, we found the ICJ demonstrated sustained tone that was resistant to tetrodotoxin. Ileal distension decreased ICJ pressure by 22.2 \u00bf 10.1% (11.9 \u00bf 2.7-10.1 \u00bf 2.6 mmHg; P=0.002) and colonic distension augmented ICJ pressure by 23.5 \u00bf 8.6% (12.8 \u00bf 1.5-15.6 \u00bf 2.1 mmHg; P=0.02). Bethanecol and Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) increased ICJ pressure (P=0.002, P=0.01, respectively). Sodium nitroprusside and isoproterenol reduced ICJ pressure (P=0.004, P=0.02, respectively). In the presence of L-NAME, the early inhibitory ileo-ICJ response was abolished, while early and late inhibitory responses were abolished by further addition of propranolol but not by the addition of hexamethonium, atropine, prazosin or yohimbine. The excitatory colo-ICJ response was replaced by inhibition in the presence of L-NAME. We concluded that: (1) the porcine ICJ displays myogenic tone which is influenced by excitatory muscarinic and inhibitory nitrergic and beta adrenergic pathways (2) an inhibitory ileo-sphincteric reflex mediated by nitrergic and beta adrenergic postganglionic neural pathways (3) both excitatory and inhibitory neurogenic colo-sphincteric reflexes exist, and the excitatory pathway involves nitrergic neurotransmission.",

    "78": "A total of 164 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, capsular glaucoma or ocular hypertension were included in a three-month, open-label, randomised multicentre study. Patients with open-angle glaucoma were required to have IOP at least 22 mmHg and patients with ocular hypertension were required to have IOP at least 27 mmHg, on treatment with one or two ocular hypotensive drugs of which at least one had to be a beta-blocker. All patients were treated with timolol, 5 mg/ml twice daily, for a 2-4 week run-in period. They were then randomised to latanoprost, 50 g/ml once daily, or timolol 5 mg/ml plus dorzolamide, 20 mg/ml twice daily. The difference in mean diurnal IOP change from baseline to month 3 was compared in the two groups.", 
    "79": "When patients were switched to latanoprost, mean diurnal IOP was reduced by 5.2 mmHg (23%) compared to 4.0 mmHg (17%) in the group in which dorzolamide was added to timolol. The difference of 1.2 mmHg was statistically significant (p= 0.005). The majority of adverse events during both treatments were judged as mild.",

After 6 months without symptoms he again experienced several attacks of tachycardia. Resting ECG merely revealed an epsilon potential and negative T waves in V1-V3. Right ventricular contrast injection revealed inferolateral dyskinesia. EPS demonstrated both the known VT and a second, morphologically different one (LBBB with LAD). These findings indicated arrhythmogenic right-ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARCV). A cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted (ICD) and over the subsequent 8 months he had six episodes of VT which were quickly terminated by the ICD.",

    "85": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that manifests clinically with variable degrees of tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. Tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease is characterised by prominent tremor of one or more limbs with a relative lack of significant rigidity and bradykinesia. Despite the lack of other disabling motor symptoms, the tremor of tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease can be very disabling, especially if a postural and kinetic component exists. A wide variety of treatments for Parkinson's disease tremor are currently available and include use of oral medications, injections with botulinum toxin and neurosurgical procedures. Some of the first line medications (levodopa, dopamine agonists, anticholinergics) are very effective in controlling tremor. However, some patients with Parkinson's disease tremors are unresponsive to first line drugs and treatment with second line medications (clozapine, amantadine, clonazepam, propranolol, neurontin) should be attempted. In the small number of patients with disabling tremor that is refractory to all medications, neurosurgical intervention should be considered. Both thermocoagulation and deep brain stimulation at several different neuroanatomical sites (thalamus, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus) offer good to excellent tremor control with relatively low risk to the patient.", 
    "86": "Two groups of drugs commonly used for the treatment of hypertension are atenolol and amlodipine. These drugs are reported to have conflicting changes on pulmonary responses. In order to study the effect of hypertension and antihypertensive treatment on pulmonary responses, 40 patients with essential hypertension having diastolic blood pressure between 90-114 mmHg on three consecutive weekly visits were taken. Pulmonary responses were tested at the end of 2 weeks of placebo washout period and then at the end of 6 weeks of treatment with either atenolol or amodipine. Using a computerized autospiror along with the weekly recordings of heart rate and blood pressure, the various pulmonary and cardiac parameters were taken. Analysis of the result showed that atenolol treatment resulted in significant decline of forced vital capacity (FVC), % forced vital capacity (%FVC), and forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1) whereas amlodipine did not show any significant change on pulmonary parameters.",

A comparative cost analysis was also performed. Thirty patients received either esmolol (n = 15) or diltiazem (n = 15) for AF/AFL. During the first 6 hours of treatment, 66.6% of esmolol-treated patients converted to sinus rhythm compared with 13.3% of the diltiazem-treated patients (P <.05). At 24 hours, 66.6% of the diltiazem group converted to SR compared with 80% of the esmolol group (not significant). Drug-induced side effects, time to rate control (<90 beats/min), number of patients requiring cardioversion, and length of hospitalization were similar for the two groups.

Timolol was associated with lowered pulse rates and reductions in the spirometry measurements. 41% of patients using brimonidine complained of systemic side effects and over 55% of patients using betaxolol complained of ocular irritation. 28% of patients required an alteration in their glaucoma management.", 
    "93": "Latanoprost appears to be a useful primary treatment for glaucoma patients, in view of superior IOP control and a low incidence of local and systemic side effects. Timolol causes a reduction in measurements of respiratory function, a concern in view of the potential subclinical reversible airways disease in the elderly glaucoma population. Brimonidine is associated with substantial, unpredictable systemic side effects and betaxolol causes ocular irritation and weak IOP control. Spirometry is advised in all patients receiving topical beta blocker therapy to control their glaucoma.", 
    "94": "Agents that alter adrenergic receptors, such as \"beta-blockers,\" also alter memory storage. However, reports suggest that beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as propranolol, have conflicting behavioral effects with acute vs chronic dosing. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of chronic propranolol on retention for a spatial learning task. Adult male ICR mice were given daily injections of propranolol (2, 4, 8, or 12 mg/kg ip) or 0. 9% NaCl for 15 days prior to, and during, trials in a Morris water maze. Mice received five massed acquisition (escape) trials in each of three daily sessions, followed by a single 60-s probe trial on the fourth day. The location of the submerged platform was constant for each animal over acquisition trials, but varied across animals; starting position varied across trials. A 5 (dose) x 3 (trial blocks) mixed factorial ANOVA for escape time yielded a significant trial blocks effect only (p <.001), showing performance improving over sessions. Time spent in the target quadrant on the probe trial was shorter under all doses of propranolol when compared to vehicle group (all p <.001), indicating poorer retention of prior platform location. This effect, however, was not dose-related. Swim speed was not significantly affected by propranolol. These data demonstrate that chronic dosing with propranolol can impair retention of spatial learning, which cannot be attributed to reduced arousal or motor function.",

Patients had ECG monitoring for 48 hours, and time of reversion, adequacy of rate control, and numbers of adverse events were compared. After 48 hours, those still in atrial fibrillation underwent cardioversion according to a standardized protocol. After 48 hours of therapy and attempted cardioversion, the number of patients whose rhythms had successfully reverted were compared.",

In those patients whose rhythms did not revert to sinus rhythm, there was superior ventricular rate control in the sotalol group at both 24 and 48 hours compared with those who received either amiodarone or digoxin.

    "103": "We have previously reported that human airway smooth-muscle (ASM) cells produce abundant interleukin (IL)-8, a major neutrophil chemoattractant involved in asthma exacerbations. Here, we tested the effects of the beta(2)-agonists salbutamol (Salbu) and salmeterol (Salme) on IL-8 release and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced IL-8 release from ASM cells. We found that TNF-alpha strongly enhanced IL-8 release in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, whereas Salbu, Salme, the direct adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (FSK), and the cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) analogue 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) alone weakly stimulated IL-8 release. TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml)-induced IL-8 release was markedly inhibited by the steroids dexamethasone (Dex) (0.1 to 10 microM) and fluticasone (Flut) (0.01 to 1 microM) but unaffected by Salbu, Salme, FSK, or 8-Br-cAMP. However, a combination of Dex (1 microM) or Flut (0.1 microM) with Salbu (10 microM), Salme (1 microM), FSK (10 microM), or 8-Br-cAMP (10 and 100 microM) significantly enhanced the inhibition by Dex or Flut alone. Experiments with KT5720, a selective inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A; rolipram, a selective inhibitor of type IV phosphodiesterase; and ICI-118,551, a beta(2)-receptor antagonist, suggested that the synergistic inhibition was mediated by beta(2)-receptor in a cAMP-dependent manner. This novel synergistic interaction of beta(2)-agonists and steroids may partly explain the benefits that result when these agents are combined to treat asthma.", 
    "104": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of latanoprost 0.005% (Xalatan, Pharmacia & Upjohn), brimonidine (Alphagan, Allergan), and dorzolamide (Trusopt, Merck Inc.) when added to a beta-blocker in patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma. This was a multicenter, retrospective analysis which included all reviewed patient records in which latanoprost, brimonidine or dorzolamide were added to a beta-blocker for at least three months. Patients who were treated for less than three months, who failed therapy due to ineffectiveness of the medicine or an adverse event also were included. The study included 141 patients. Latanoprost (n = 50) showed an intraocular pressure of 16.7 +/- 3.3 mm Hg (-6.3 +/- 4.1 mm Hg, P < 0.001), brimonidine (n = 24) 17.4 +/- 4.9 mm Hg (-4.2 +/- 4.5 mm Hg, P < 0.001), and dorzolamide (n = 67) 20.1 +/- 6.1 mm Hg (-3.1 +/- 5.1 mm Hg, P < 0.001) at three months. A significant difference was observed in the absolute level of intraocular pressure (P < 0.005) and the change from baseline between groups (P < 0.005) at three months. A significant difference was observed between groups in the success rate of therapy between latanoprost (70%), brimonidine (58%) and dorzolamide (40%) (P = 0.008). No significant differences were observed between groups for rate or type of adverse events leading to discontinued therapy. This study showed that latanoprost, when added to beta-blockers, compares favorably in ocular hypotensive efficacy and is similar in safety to brimonidine and dorzolamide.", 
    "105": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering activity and possible mechanism of action of the synthetic, non-psychotropic cannabinoid dexanabinol (HU-211) [(+)(3S,4S), 7-hydroxy-delta-6-tetrahydrocannabinol 1,1 dimethylheptyl], following intravenous (i.v.) administration in the rabbit. IOP (pneumatonometry), aqueous humor inflow rate (fluorophotometry), blood pressure, and heart rate (computerized physiograph system connected to central ear artery cannula) were measured in unanesthetized albino rabbits. Intravenous administration of HU-211 resulted in a dose-related reduction in IOP; a maximal IOP reduction of 5.0 +/- 0.2 mmHg was observed 4 hr after a 0.5 mg/kg dose. No significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate were observed during the first hr following this dose of HU-21 1. Pupil diameter did not change significantly during the 5 hr following the 0.5 mg/kg i.v. dose. No significant change in the rate of aqueous humor inflow occurred during the 6 hr after a 0.5 mg/kg dose of HU-211, thereby implicating outflow changes as the major source of IOP reduction. IOP reduction by HU-211 following pre-treatment with the alpha2 adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.v.), was only 30% of that of HU-211 alone. IOP reduction following pretreatment with the alpha2 agonist, clonidine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), was twice as large as that of HU-211 alone. Pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), resulted in a 50% reduction in the IOP-lowering effect of HU-211. In summary, HU-211, administered i.v., is an effective IOP-lowering agent, devoid of any significant side effects (blood pressure, heart rate or pupil diameter, all of which have been reported previously for cannabinoids). Involvement of the adrenergic system is indicated in mediating the IOP-lowering effects of HU-211 that appear to reflect a change in fluid outflow from the eye.", 
    "106": "The activity on intraocular pressure (IOP) of SR121463, a selective non-peptide arginin-vasopressin (AVP) V2 receptor antagonist, was investigated in a rabbit model of ocular hypertension. We first demonstrated that, in vitro, SR121463 displayed high competitive affinity for rabbit vasopressin V2 receptors (Ki = 2.1 +/- 1.2 nM). In vivo, SR121463 was instilled once (at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 3%), or for 10 days (20 instillations) at 1% concentration, in the eye of ocular hypertensive rabbits (intraocular injection of 0.14 mg alpha-chymotrypsin). SR121463 also was instilled at 1% in the normotensive eye or intravenously injected (100 microg/kg) to ocular hypertensive rabbits. SR121463 was compared to timolol 0.5% or to clonidine 0.25%. Additionally, local and systemic safety aspects were examined. Results showed that SR121463 was locally well-tolerated and had no anesthetic effect. A significant decrease in IOP of the hypertensive eye was observed for concentrations of SR121463 > or =1%. This decrease was comparable to that obtained with reference compounds. A similar activity was found after intravenous administration. No tachyphylaxis was observed after 10 days, and no contralateral or systemic effect was noted. Also, when applied on the normotensive eye or when intravenously injected, SR121463 had no effect on the normotensive eye. These results on IOP and the good local and systemic safety profile, suggest that a potent vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, SR121463, could be of value for the treatment of glaucoma, through a mechanism of action that remains to be elucidated.", 
    "107": "The mechanisms responsible for pathological iron deposition and mitochondrial insufficiency that have been documented in the brains of Alzheimer (AD) patients remain poorly understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that low-micromolar concentrations of amyloid1-40 (A40) and amyloid 1-42 (A42), peptides implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, increase levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA and protein in cultured rat astroglia. Furthermore, 6 days of exposure to amyloid augments the sequestration of 55FeCl3-derived iron by astroglial mitochondria without affecting the disposition of this metal in whole-cell and lysosomal compartments. Mitochondrial iron deposition was not observed in the amyloid-treated glia when diferric-transferrin served as the metal donor. We had previously shown that inhibitors of HO-1 and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP) block the uptake of mitochondrial iron in astrocytes exposed to the pro-oxidant effects of dopamine and several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, in the current study, amyloid-induced mitochondrial iron trapping was significantly attenuated by co-administration of the HO-1 transcriptional suppressor, dexamethasone (DEX) or the MTP blocker, cyclosporin A (CSA). Thus, the marked enhancement of HO-1 expression previously demonstrated in AD-affected neurons and astroglia may transduce amyloid (oxidative) stress into the abnormal patterns of iron deposition and mitochondrial insufficiency characteristic of this disease. Finally, in experiments employing cytotoxic concentrations of A40, we provide evidence that inhibition of HO-1 transcription and related mitochondrial iron deposition may be an important mechanism by which DEX protects tissues subjected to amyloid stress.", 
    "108": "Experiments on frog neuromuscular junction preparations with extracellular recording of nerve terminal action potentials and single-quantum end-plate currents (EPC) were used to assess the time course of evoked quantum secretion of mediator by analyzing histograms of the distribution of true synaptic delays. These studies showed that noradrenaline, isoproterenol, and dobutamine change the kinetics of secretion of quanta, leading to synchronization of the process of mediator release; substances blocking beta-adrenoceptors (atenolol, propranolol) blocked this effect. Clonidine and phenylephrine, which activate alpha-receptors, had no effect on the kinetics of secretion, while the alpha-blocker phentolamine had no effect on the synchronizing action of noradrenaline. Reconstruction of multiquantum EPC from changes in the level of synchronization in the release of individual quanta, showed that EPC amplitude increased in response to noradrenaline by 17%, and that this was due only to alterations in the time course of secretion. These data led to the conclusion that there is a special presynaptic mechanism which facilitates the action of sympathomimetics, acting via beta-adrenoceptors.",

Sixty-seven percent of the losartan-treated and 64% of the atenolol-treated patients remained on monotherapy throughout the study. Only 1.5% of the losartan-treated patients withdrew because of a clinical adverse event (CAE) compared with 7.2% in the atenolol-treatment group (P= 0.035).

We have previously shown that mRNA levels for ET-1, ET-3, and their receptors are upregulated under hyperhexosemic conditions. In this study, an endothelin antagonist was used to assess the effects of endothelin blockage on the production of two basement membrane transcripts, fibronectin and collagen alpha1 (IV). The microvascular basement membranes were analyzed using ultrastructural morphometry. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, galactose-fed rats (30% galactose in diet), and nondiabetic, non-galactose-fed control rats were studied after 1-month and 6-month follow-up. Simultaneously, similar animal groups were treated with a general ET receptor blocker (bosentan, 100 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) and investigated. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for fibronectin and collagen alpha1 (IV) was conducted after 1 month of follow-up with comparison to beta-actin housekeeping gene using slot blot hybridization and densitometry. Basement membrane thickness was assessed after 6 months of follow-up in diabetic rats, using the orthogonal intercept method. After 1 month of follow-up, increased fibronectin and collagen alpha1 (IV) mRNA were present in the retina of diabetic and galactosemic animals, and the bosentan-treated groups exhibited mRNA levels similar to the control animals. After 6 months of follow-up, diabetes and galactose feeding induced basement membrane thickening, which was partially prevented by bosentan treatment. The above findings indicate that increased production of extracellular matrix proteins leading to thickening of microvascular basement membrane, secondary to hyperhexosemia, may be mediated via augmented ET production.",

To induce myopia, chicks (n = 56) were fitted with either monocular translucent diffusers or -15 D spectacle lenses from day 8. The drug treatment protocol comprised topical applications of 0.4% benoxinate, a local anaesthetic (to improve drug absorption), followed either by 0.5% timolol or distilled water (control), either daily (1000 hr) or twice daily (1000, 1600 hr). Refractive errors and ocular dimensions were measured on days 12 and 17. We also verified the ocular hypotensive effect of timolol in both normal (n = 8) and myopic (n = 12 diffusers; n = 12-15 D lenses) chicks. Here, we took baseline IOP measurements, instilled timolol and then monitored IOP over a further 5-9 hr. We found no difference in the amount of myopia produced in the timolol and control groups at either measurement time point (e.g. day 17, once per day application, diffusers: -26.9 +/- 3.3 D vs -22.7 +/- 9.1 D; lenses: -14.9 +/- 3.8 D vs -14.9 +/- 3.6 D). This was in spite of the fact that timolol did lower IOP in both normal and myopic chicks (27 and 18% reduction, respectively) While timolol does have an ocular hypotensive effect in the chick, it does not inhibit the development of myopia in this animal model.", 
    "123": "Betaxolol, a beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, is widely used in the treatment of glaucoma. In addition to its ocular hypotensive effects, betaxolol has been suggested to act as a retinal neuroprotective agent (Osborne et al., 1997). To investigate possible mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects, we tested the actions of betaxolol on ion channels and calcium signaling in isolated retinal ganglion cells. Betaxolol (50 microM) reduced by about 20% the high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca channel currents in ganglion cells isolated from tiger salamander retina. In contrast, the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol (10 microM) and timolol (50 microM) had no inhibitory actions on HVA Ca channel currents. The L-type Ca channel antagonist, nisoldipine, blocked the HVA Ca channel current partially and the remaining current was not inhibited by betaxolol. Outward current was inhibited in the presence of betaxolol. Both iberiotoxin (IBTX; 10 nM), a selective inhibitor of large-conductance Ca-activated K channels, and Cd2+ (100 microM), which suppresses Ca-activated K channels subsequent to its block of Ca channels, reduced outward current and the remaining current was not blocked significantly with betaxolol. In the presence of betaxolol, Na channel currents were reduced by about 20%, as were currents evoked by glutamate (10 mM) and GABA (1 mM). Current clamp recordings from isolated ganglion cells showed that betaxolol had several effects on excitability: spike height decreased, repetitive spike activity was suppressed, spike width increased and hyperpolarization following spikes was reduced. Calcium imaging in isolated rat retinal ganglion cells revealed that betaxolol inhibited glutamate-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that betaxolol has a diversity of suppressive actions on ganglion cell ion channels and that, as a consequence, one of the net actions of the drug is to reduce Ca2+ influx. The subsequent reduction in [Ca2+]i may contribute to the apparent neuroprotective actions of betaxolol in promoting ganglion cell survival following ischemic insult, as may occur in glaucoma and retinal disease.", 
    "124": "Packed-column supercritical fluid chromatography (pSFC) with a fast composition gradient is used as a rapid screening tool for combinatorial chemistry. The advantages of fast analysis speed and fast recovery to initial conditions are demonstrated. Retention time reproducibility is similar to isocratic analyses by pSFC and ranges from 0.37 to 0.64% relative standard deviation. A mixture of beta-blockers illustrates the 'normal phase' retention mechanism. For these solutes and a range of analytes, the peak width is relatively constant. Such behavior permits the classical peak capacity equation to be reduced to a simple, straightforward form. Using this as a performance metric, pSFC is shown to be 5-10 times faster than reversed phase HPLC for library screening.",

Evidence of heart failure was more marked in TG mice with a greater increase in weights of the right ventricle and lungs and a higher prevalence of atrial thrombus (P<0.05 in each case). In hypertrophied TG hearts, endogenous alpha-MHC mRNA transcripts in LV were maintained at 1 and 3 weeks, but were reduced by approximately 40% relative to the sham-operated group at 8 weeks after TAC. Transgene expression, measured as human beta(2)AR mRNA, was reduced by 45% at 1 and 3 weeks and by 70% at 8 weeks after TAC. beta(2)AR binding sites were reduced by 35, 47 and 65%, respectively, at 1, 3 and 8 weeks.",

    "129": "Selective and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were used to block the increases in fluid and protein secretion caused by sympathomimetic stimulation of the mandibular gland of red kangaroos during intracarotid infusion of isoprenaline. Atenolol or ICI118551 at antagonist:agonist ratios up to 300:1 caused increasing but incomplete blockade of fluid secretion and protein release. Both selective antagonists had equal potency and both antagonists were more effective at blocking protein release than at blocking fluid secretion. Consequently, the mechanisms underpinning fluid secretion are more sensitive to beta-sympathomimetic stimulation than those causing protein release. Propranolol at antagonist:agonist ratios of 300:1 was more potent than the selective antagonists, almost totally blocking the increases in fluid secretion and protein release. The data are consistent with the acini of the kangaroo mandibular gland having both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors and with the increased fluid secretion and protein release by isoprenaline being mediated by both receptor subtypes.", 
    "130": "Numerous studies have addressed the antihypertensive properties of I(1)-imidazoline receptor agonists such as moxonidine, but very few authors examined their cardiac antiarrhythmic potency. Due to the important role of the sympathetic nervous system in the genesis of neurogenic cardiac arrhythmias, we investigated the antiarrhythmic effects of moxonidine and compared them to those of propranolol in an experimental model of neurogenic arrhythmias. Chronic bipolar electrodes were implanted within the posterior hypothalamus of six halothane-anesthetized rabbits. Every 15 days, after three 10-min-interval control electrical stimulations, we compared the effects of randomized i.v. administrations of moxonidine (25 microg/kg), propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), and saline (0.9% NaCl) on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and ECG during 2.5 h with six stimulations every 20 min. We observed that: 1) in control conditions, intrahypothalamic stimulation increased MAP (DeltaMAP = 17 +/- 2 mm Hg) and HR (DeltaHR = 60 +/- 1 beats/min), and triggered extrasystoles (number of extrasystoles = 55 +/- 2) and abnormal complexes (number of abnormal ECG complexes = 37 +/- 1), which occurred with a 6.4 +/- 0.4-s delay and 33 +/- 1-s duration; 2) moxonidine and propranolol induced almost equihypotensive (DeltaMAP = -12 +/- 2 and -10 +/- 2 mm Hg) and pronounced bradycardic effects (DeltaHR = -47 +/- 10 and -78 +/- 9 beats/min, respectively). Arrhythmias were significantly reduced by moxonidine and propranolol: Deltanumber of extrasystoles = -83 and -98%; Deltanumber of abnormal ECG complexes = -33 and -79%; Deltadelay = +65 and +188%; Deltaduration = -35 and -58%, respectively. Our results show that moxonidine presents an antiarrhythmic potency comparable to that of propranolol that should be predominantly related to their central action. However, additional studies are required to determine whether these antiarrhythmic effects are of central and/or peripheral origin.", 
    "131": "Stress-induced hyperglycemia can lead to significant deterioration in glycemic control in individuals with diabetes. Previously, we have shown in normal dogs that, after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of carbachol (a model of moderate stress), increases in both the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of glucose and endogenous glucose production (GP) occur. However, in hyperglycemic diabetic dogs subjected to the same stress, the MCR of glucose does not increase and glycemia therefore markedly deteriorates because of stimulation of GP. Our aims were to determine the following: 1) whether insulin-induced acute normalization of glycemia, with or without beta-blockade, would correct glucose clearance and prevent the hyperglycemic effect of stress, and 2) whether hyperinsulinemia per se could correct these abnormalities. Stress was induced by ICV carbachol in 27 experiments in five alloxan-administered diabetic dogs subjected to the following protocols in random order: 1) basal insulin infusion (BI) to restore normoglycemia; 2) basal insulin infusion with beta-blockade (BI+block); 3) normoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp with threefold elevation of insulin above basal (3x BI); and 4) normoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp with fivefold elevation of insulin above basal (5 x BI). The BI+block protocol fully prevented stress-induced hyperglycemia, both by increasing MCR (deltaMCR at peak: 0.72 +/- 0.25 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) vs. no change in BI, P < 0.05) and by diminishing the stress-induced increment in GP observed in BI (deltaGP at peak: 3.72 +/- 0.09 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) for BI+block vs. 14.10 +/- 0.31 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) for BI, P < 0.0001). In contrast, 3x BI and 5x BI treatments with normoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps proportionately increased basal MCR at baseline, but paradoxically were not associated with an increase in MCR in response to stress, which induced a twofold increase in GP. Thus, in alloxan-administered diabetic dogs, stress increased GP but not MCR, despite normalization of glycemia with basal or high insulin. In contrast, beta-adrenergic blockade almost completely restored the metabolic response to stress to normal and prevented marked hyperglycemia, both by limiting the rise in GP and by increasing glucose MCR. We conclude that acute normalization of glycemia with basal insulin or hyperinsulinemia does not prevent hyperglycemic effects of stress unless accompanied by beta-blockade, and we speculate that short-term beta-blockade may be a useful treatment modality under some stress conditions in patients with diabetes.", 
    "132": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation provides short term haemodynamic support to the failing myocardium, but may be deleterious over longer periods as chronic catecholamine excess appears to contribute to disease progression and increased mortality in this condition. Therefore, blockade of sympathetic activation represents a logical, if somewhat counter-intuitive, approach to the management of the patient with systolic CHF. Pharmacological approaches to blockade of this system include inhibition of central sympathetic outflow (using central sympatholytics, e.g. rilmenidine, moxonidine), blockade of the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway (dopamine beta hydroxylase antagonists) and blockade of the cardiac effects of sympathetic activation (beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents). Beta-blockers have now been extensively studied in patients with symptomatic CHF of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II and III severity. Provided beta-blocker therapy is carefully up-titrated from sub-therapeutic doses and given for at least three to four months, these agents have been associated with favourable long term haemodynamic, functional and mortality outcomes. Furthermore, beta-blockers delay disease progression in CHF by reversing the pathological myocardial remodelling process that accompanies the disease. Non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs appear to be of particular benefit in CHF therapy. Myocardial beta2 receptors are down-regulated to a lesser extent than beta1 receptors in CHF, therefore blockade of the beta2 receptor sub-type may assume greater importance in inhibiting the deleterious effects of sympathetic activation on the myocardium in this disease. Newer agents that possess additional vasodilator properties (carvedilol, bucindolol, nebivolol) may be useful in overcoming the initial negative inotropy of the beta-blocking component of the drug, however, it is unlikely that vasodilation contributes greatly to long term clinical benefits. Drugs such as carvedilol are also anti-oxidant, anti-proliferative and have anti-endothelin actions; the clinical significance of these properties is yet to be determined. Unanswered questions remain regarding the use of beta-blockers in heart failure. Ongoing studies are further examining mechanisms underlying the clinical benefits of these agents as well as their therapeutic potential in NYHA Class IV patients, heart failure post-myocardial infarction and patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.",

Before the availability of ATPICD, 22 patients were treated with sotalol as part of a randomised study comparing the efficacy of sotalol to amiodarone. After ATPICD became available sotalol was used in 49 patients in whom intravenous testing predicted sotalol to be effective and ATPICD were implanted in 68 patients in whom sotalol was predicted to be ineffective at electrophysiological testing. Thus, 68 patients were treated with an ATPICD and 71 with sotalol.",

Kaplan-Meier estimates of total mortality at 36 months were 12% with ATPICD and 25% with sotalol (p=0.09).

    "138": "Theoretical mechanistic biochemistry (TMB) analysis was used to predict the therapeutic effects of calcium channel blockers in the drug management of hypertension, cerebrovascular disorders (CVD) and coronary artery disease (CAD). This analysis was extended to acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) a non-calcium channel blocker which is nevertheless commonly used in the management of the same disorders. TMB data have suggested nisoldipine, nicardipine and nimodipine as agents of choice in the management of cerebrovascular disease, e.g. in transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). The same agents were found preferable in the management of coronary artery disease. It is noteworthy that atherosclerosis and vascular spasm are common pathogenic events in both conditions. For lowering blood pressure, without compromising cerebral and coronary blood flows TMB data suggested nisoldipine, nicardipine, nimodipine and nifedipine in that preferential order. For tissue selectivity, TMB data have identified nisoldipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine and nitrendipine for vascular tissue and that verapamil, diltiazem and aspirin have little or no tissue selectivity. TMB data have gone further to suggest a combination of nicardipine, nisoldipine or nimodipine with beta-blockers in order to reduce the frequently uncomfortable reflex tachycardia often induced by some calcium channel blockers. By and large, TMB predicted data have been found to correlate reasonably well with clinically observed and reported therapeutic effects of calcium channel blockers. Their consistency in the management of hypertension, cerebrovascular disease and coronary artery disease is apparent in this study.",

Beta blocker ingestion is unlikely to result in symptoms if the patient remains asymptomatic for 6 hours after the time of ingestion.", 
    "143": "A conscious rabbit model with microdialysis sampling of endogenous aqueous humor ascorbate was developed in order to assess the pharmacodynamics of beta-blocker modulation of aqueous humor production. CMA/20 microdialysis probes were implanted in the anterior chamber of each eye of rabbits (n = 6). After a 2 week recovery period, an i.v. bolus of 14C-ascorbate (20 microCi) was administered. Blood samples and aqueous humor microdialysis probe effluent were collected and analysed for endogenous and 14C-ascorbate to estimate the basal rate of ascorbate blood to aqueous humor secretion (Ro). After a 1 hr washout, each rabbit received a series of three doses of 3H-propranolol (750-3000 microg, 16.5 microCi mg(-1)) every 60 min into the lower cul-de-sac of each eye. Probe effluent was analysed for endogenous ascorbate and 3H-propranolol; ascorbate and propranolol in the iris/ciliary body, vitreous and aqueous was determined at the end of the experiment. Nonlinear least-squares regression analysis of the concentration-time profiles for aqueous humor ascorbate was performed to estimate the change in aqueous humor flow. The average basal aqueous humor ascorbate secretion rate was approximately 48/microg hr(-1). Propranolol (1500 microg) produced significant increases in aqueous humor ascorbate, this observation is consistent with a reduction in aqueous humor production (approximately 47%). Analysis of intraocular tissue ascorbate indicated that propranolol inhibited ascorbate secretion at the 3000 microg dose, the highest dose examined in this study; this inhibition was not observed at the 750 microg or 1500 microg doses. Changes in aqueous humor production precipitated by the administration of beta-adrenergic antagonists can be estimated by measuring changes in aqueous humor ascorbate concentrations in the conscious rabbit. Microdialysis sampling of aqueous humor for endogenous ascorbate provides a relevant analytic tool to estimate modulatory effects of anti-glaucoma drugs on aqueous humor production.", 
    "144": "The effects of norepinephrine (NE) on the electrophysiological activities of single hypothalamic arcuate neurons were studied using extracellular recording of 385 neurons from 169 brain slices in rats. The results showed that: (1) of 236 neurons selected randomly and tested with NE application, 137 (58.0%) were excited, 67 (28.4%) were inhibited, and 32 (13.6%) failed to respond; (2) substitution of low Ca(2+)-high Mg(2+) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for normal ACSF abolished the NE-induced inhibitory effect but failed to abolish the excitatory effect; (3) both the NE-induced excitatory and inhibitory effects were antagonized partly by phentolamine, prazosin, and propranolol but not by yohimbine; (4) naloxone and glibenclamide, a blocker of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive (K(ATP)) channels, blocked the NE-induced inhibitory effect; and (5) neurons that were inhibited by NE were also inhibited by morphine and cromakalim, an agonist of K(ATP) channels, and moreover, the morphine-induced inhibitory effect could be blocked by glibenclamide, while the cromakalim-induced inhibitory effect was not blocked by naloxone. These results imply that: (a) NE excites arcuate neurons through a mechanism that is insensitive to lowering the extracellular Ca(2+) suggesting a direct postsynaptic response through alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic receptors, while NE inhibits cells through at least an inhibitory interneuron in arcuate and so is dependent on a Ca(2+)-sensitive presynaptic release mechanism; and (b) the inhibitory interneuron may be opioidergic, being excited first through alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic receptors, after which the released opioids inhibit the neurons being recorded with an involvement of activation of K(ATP) channels. This possibility needs to be substantiated in much more detail.", 
    "145": "Regional haemodynamic responses to recombinant murine or human leptin were assessed in conscious, chronically-instrumented, male, Long-Evans rats (350 - 450 g). Human, but not murine, leptin caused a slight hindquarters vasoconstriction, but neither peptide had any effect on mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate. In the presence of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551, a hindquarters vasoconstrictor response to human leptin was not seen, and there was a tachycardia, as there was to murine leptin. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, (L-NAME), did not influence the cardiovascular effects of murine or human leptin. The results indicate that the previously reported sympathoexcitatory effects of murine leptin in anaesthetized rats are not manifest as regional haemodynamic changes in conscious rats, and this is not due to beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilator mechanisms opposing any vasoconstrictor responses. Moreover, the ability of L-NAME to unmask a pressor effect of murine leptin in anaesthetized rats may not be apparent in the conscious state.", 
    "146": "Using in vivo microdialysis in the frontal cortex of the freely moving rat we evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with the serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine in the presence and absence of the 5-HT(1A)/beta-adrenergic antagonist (+/-)pindolol. Chronic vehicle treated animals produced no significant response to a challenge with fluoxetine (10 mg kg(-1)) on day 8 and 15. Alternatively, a significant (P<0.05) decrease in extracellular 5-HT was observed in control animals upon challenge with the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.03 and 0.1 mg kg(-1)). Conversely, animals treated with fluoxetine (10 mg kg(-1) o.d.) for 7 and 14 days produced a significant (P<0.05) 2 fold increase in extracellular 5-HT when challenged with fluoxetine (10 mg kg(-1)) on day 8 and 15. Moreover, no significant decrease in extracellular 5-HT was observed upon challenge with either dose of 8-OH-DPAT. Animals chronically treated with (+/-)pindolol (10 or 20 mg kg(-1) b.i.d.) produced a significant dose-related increase in extracellular 5-HT upon challenge with fluoxetine on day 15 only. Furthermore, both doses produced a significantly blunted response to the low dose challenge of 8-OH-DPAT (0.03 mg kg(-1)). In addition, 20 mg kg(-1) (+/-)pindolol treated animals also had no response to the higher 0.1 mg kg(-1) dose of 8-OH-DPAT. Animals treated for 14 days with a combination of (+/-)pindolol (10 or 20 mg kg(-1)) and fluoxetine were not significantly different from vehicle treated animals when challenged with fluoxetine or 8-OH-DPAT. Taken together it would therefore appear that although (+/-)pindolol alone has sufficient intrinsic activity to produce a desensitization of the 5-HT(1A) receptor, when given in combination with fluoxetine it is able to prevent the desensitization induced by not only fluoxetine but also itself. This may suggest that the clinical augmentation of antidepressant action by pindolol, when co-administered with a SSRI, is via antagonism of the 5-HT(1A) receptor.", 
    "147": "Betaxolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist used for the treatment of glaucoma, is known to be neuroprotective in paradigms of ischaemia/excitotoxicity. In this study, we examined whether betaxolol and other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists interact directly with neurotoxin binding to sites 1 and 2 of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Na(+) channel) in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes. Betaxolol inhibited specific [(3)H]-batrachotoxinin-A 20-alpha-benzoate ([(3)H]-BTX-B) binding to neurotoxin site 2 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 9.8 microM. Comparison of all the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists tested revealed a potency order of propranolol>betaxolol approximately levobetaxolol>levobunolol approximately carteolol>/=timolol>atenolol. None of the drugs caused a significant inhibition of [(3)H]-saxitoxin binding to neurotoxin receptor site 1, even at concentrations as high as 250 microM. Saturation experiments showed that betaxolol increased the K(D) of [(3)H]-BTX-B binding but had no effect on the B(max). The association kinetics of [(3)H]-BTX-B were unaffected by betaxolol, but the drug significantly accelerated the dissociation rate of the radioligand. These findings argue for a competitive, indirect, allosteric mode of inhibition of [(3)H]-BTX-B binding by betaxolol. Betaxolol inhibited veratridine-stimulated Na(+) influx in rat cortical synaptosomes with an IC(50) value of 28. 3 microM. Carteolol, levobunolol, timolol and atenolol were significantly less effective than betaxolol at reducing veratridine-evoked Na(+) influx. The ability of betaxolol to interact with neurotoxin site 2 of the Na(+) channel and inhibit Na(+) influx may have a role in its neuroprotective action in paradigms of excitotoxicity/ischaemia and in its therapeutic effect in glaucoma.", 
    "148": "The smooth muscle relaxant responses to the mixed beta(3)-, putative beta(4)-adrenoceptor agonist, (-)-CGP 12177 in rat colon are partially resistant to blockade by the beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A suggesting involvement of beta(3)- and putative beta(4)-adrenoceptors. We now investigated the function of the putative beta(4)-adrenoceptor and other beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in the colon, oesophagus and ureter of wildtype (WT) and beta(3)-adrenoceptor knockout (beta(3)KO) mice. (-)-Noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline relaxed KCl (30 mM)-precontracted colon mostly through beta(1)-and beta(3)-adrenoceptors to a similar extent and to a minor extent through beta(2)-adrenoceptors. In colon from beta(3)KO mice, (-)-noradrenaline was as potent as in WT mice but the effects were mediated entirely through beta(1)-adrenoceptors. (-)-CGP 12177 relaxed colon from beta(3)KO mice with 2 fold greater potency than in WT mice. The maintenance of potency for (-)-noradrenaline and increase for (-)-CGP 12177 indicate compensatory increases in beta(1)- and putative beta(4)-adrenoceptor function in beta(3)KO mice. In oesophagi precontracted with 1 microM carbachol, (-)-noradrenaline caused relaxation mainly through beta(1)-and beta(3)-adrenoceptors. (-)-CGP 12177 (2 microM) relaxed oesophagi from WT by 61.4+/-5.1% and beta(3)KO by 67.3+/-10.1% of the (-)-isoprenaline-evoked relaxation, consistent with mediation through putative beta(4)-adrenoceptors. In ureter, (-)-CGP 12177 (2 microM) reduced pacemaker activity by 31.1+/-2.3% in WT and 31.3+/-7. 5% in beta(3)KO, consistent with mediation through putative beta(4)-adrenoceptors. Relaxation of mouse colon and oesophagus by catecholamines are mediated through beta(1)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors in WT. The putative beta(4)-adrenoceptor, which presumably is an atypical state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor, mediates the effects of (-)-CGP 12177 in colon, oesophagus and ureter.",

Firing rates of serotonin-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus and CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons were monitored and the effects of pindolol given alone or in combination with an SSRI (fluoxetine) or a 5-HT(1A) antagonist (WAY-100,635) were determined.", 
    "159": "Pindolol inhibited the firing rates of serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Recovery to baseline firing rates was gradual, but this inhibition could be acutely reversed by WAY-100,635. A range of pindolol doses failed to block the inhibitory effects of fluoxetine on dorsal raphe cell firing. In the hippocampus, pindolol also inhibited cell firing as a function of dose, although these effects were insensitive to WAY-100,635 treatment.", 
    "160": "The ability of pindolol to inhibit serotonergic dorsal raphe cell firing is indicative of its agonist potential and is consistent with previous studies. The lack of observable antagonism of the SSRI-induced slowing of raphe unit activity casts doubt on the suitability of this mechanism of action to account for the positive findings in clinical studies utilizing pindolol/SSRI combinations. The 5-HT(1A)-independent inhibition of hippocampal CA3 cell firing by pindolol suggests that this compound invokes multiple pharmacologic actions, all of which need to be assimilated into any proposed mechanism of action.", 
    "161": "Most drug metabolizing cytochrome P450s (P450) are predominantly expressed in the liver. In contrast, human CYP1B1 is an extrahepatic P450 which is overexpressed in many tumours and has been strongly implicated in the activation of carcinogens. Rare allelic variants of the CYP1B1 gene which encode an inactive protein have been identified. However, four polymorphisms which most likely do not abolish functionality have been described. In this report, we have characterized the functional consequences of these. A CYP1B1 cDNA, identical to a cDNA published previously, served as a template to introduce allelic changes either separately or in combination. The resulting effects on CYP1B1 activity were determined in membranes isolated from Escherichia coli which coexpressed CYP1B1 together with P450 reductase. None of the allelic changes affected the CYP1B1 expression level. The allelic changes Arg48 to Gly, Ala19 to Ser and Asn453 to Ser had little influence on the Vmax and the Km of the CYP1B1 mediated 2- and 4-hydroxylation of estradiol. In contrast, the Km of these metabolic pathways was increased at least three-fold by the allelic change Va432 to Leu or by simultaneously changing Val432 to Leu and Asn453 to Ser. However, these alterations had little effect on the kinetic parameters of other CYP1B1 mediated reactions such as the epoxidation of (-)-trans-(7R,8R)-benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-dihydrodiol as determined by (r-7,t-8,t-9,c-10)-benzo[a]pyrene tetraol formation, or such as the O-dealkylation of ethoxyresorufin and the 1'-hydroxylation of bufuralol. Molecular modelling suggests that amino acid residue 432 of CYP1B1 may be involved in the interaction between CYP1B1 and P450 reductase. Since 4-hydroxyestradiol has been implicated in hormonal carcinogenesis and CYP1B1 is expressed in target tissues, the data presented demonstrate that polymorphisms in CYP1B1 have the potential to affect disease susceptibility.", 
    "162": "Beta-blocker intoxication is not frequent but can produce particularly severe or fatal conditions which must not be underestimated. Severity of beta-blocker intoxication varies from one compound to another. The more toxic drugs are propranolol, sotalol, oxprenolol, metoprolol, atenolol, acebutolol, labetalol, and carvedilol. Besides the drug type, history taking can provide a precise assessment of risk, particularly important in when elderly patients with a cardiovascular history have taken more than 20 tablets, when emergency care is provided late, and when other cardiotoxic or psychotoxic drugs have been coingested.", 
    "163": "The diagnosis of beta-blocker intoxication must be suspected in any case associating hypotension and bradycardia. The main cardiovascular complications are cardiogenic shock, atrio-ventricular conduction disorders, and obviously life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia with cardiac arrest. Centrally induced respiratory arrest is a rare but dreadful consequence which can occur suddenly even without hemodynamic failure. Neurologic toxicity is mainly expressed by consciousness disorders and more sporadically by seizures. Laboratory tests show variable serum potassium, lactic acidosis, hypoxia-hypercapnia resulting from hypoventilation, and rarely hypoglycemia. The ECG should be recorded early because electrocardiographic signs usually appear before clinical signs and QRS enlargement is a factor predictive of severe ventricular arrhythmia.", 
    "164": "The patient must be placed in an intensive care unit for continuous multiparametric monitoring. Besides gastric evacuation and symptomatic measures, treatment essentially requires glucagon for its positive inotropic effect after high intravenous doses. If glucagon infusion is ineffective or unavailable, an alternative would be to use high doses of vasoactive agents, choosing isoproterenol or epinephrine as the first intention drugs.", 
    "165": "The separation factor of two compounds in chromatography is the ratio of their equilibrium constants or retention factors. This parameter is universally employed to investigate their resolution and to optimize the experimental conditions of their analysis. In enantioseparations, the situation is more complex because there is a mixed retention mechanism. The retention factor is the sum of two contributions, one enantioselective, the other nonselective. Although both contribute to retention, the latter being identical for the two enantiomers and does not contribute to their separation. We show how these two contributions can be measured and how it becomes necessary to distinguish between the apparent, alpha(app), and the true, alpha(true), separation factors. The existence of nonselective sites is responsible for alpha(app) being less than alpha(true). Depending on the difference between these two factors, the more effective approach to improve a separation is either to increase the enantioselectivity or to reduce the nonselective interactions. Practical applications to separations of different beta-blockers on cellobiohydrolase are discussed. The apparent enantioselectivity of alprenolol is larger and increases faster with increasing pH than that of the more hydrophobic propranolol, in spite of the importance of hydrophobic interactions in the enantioselective mechanism. These two unexpected properties are discussed and explained."
