The clinical findings were tachycardia with irregular pulse, right heart failure and regurgitant tricuspid murmur that increased with inspiration. The chest radiograph and the echocardiogram showed right ventricular dilatation and severe tricuspid regurgitation without pulmonary hypertension.

Comprehensive searches were performed using Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for randomized controlled trials comparing timolol and brimonidine. Two reviewers independently assessed trials for eligibility and quality and extracted data. A random effects model was used to combine studies. Outcome was defined as the absolute mean intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction from baseline to end-point for efficacy, and relative risk (RR) for adverse events. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to explore heterogeneity according to trial design and quality. Ten publications reporting on eight trials with 2387 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Two further trials were commented on qualitatively. IOP reduction was not significantly different between timolol and brimonidine. Weighted mean difference (WMD) of IOP reduction was 0.24 mmHg (favouring brimonidine) with a 95% confidence interval of -0.57 to 1.04 mmHg. There was significant heterogeneity between studies (chi(2) (13) = 73.75, P < 0.00001, I(2) = 91%). Subgroup analysis showed no significant WMD for studies where data were analysed from end-points >/=6 months or <6 months. Meta-regression analysis showed increased WMD IOP reduction in favour of brimonidine with increased trial quality (t(3) = -4.58, P = 0.01), but no significant association with trial duration (t(3) = 0.73, P = 0.51) or size (t(3) = -0.59, P = 0.57). The RR of ocular allergy was much lower with timolol than brimonidine (RR = 0.08, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.47).

The dietary administration of beta-adrenergic agents as repartitioning agents induced a significant decrease in AnR concentration in the testicle, in GR levels in the lymphoid tissues and in beta-AR concentrations of different target organs of male chickens.

We compared an exposure or \"intervention\" group of patients targeted by the action with a comparisonor \"control\" group of patients not targeted by the action. The data sources are a longitudinal database for 200,000 NHI enrolees, corresponding NHI registration data of health care facilities, and an archive recording all historical data on the reimbursement rates of drugs covered by the NHI. We adopted a fixed effects linear regression model to control for unobserved heterogeneity among patient-hospital groups. Additional descriptive statistics were applied to examine whether any inappropriate consumption of drugs in the three classes existed.",

The average magnitudes of the decreases for the three classes of drugs mentioned above were 14.8%, 5.8% and 5.8%, respectively. In contrast, there was no reduction for the comparison group. The number of days of the prescription increased significantly from the pre- to the post-action period for both exposure and comparison groups. The total expense also significantly increased for both patient groups. For the exposure group, the average magnitudes of the growth in the total expenditure for the three classes of drugs were 47.7%, 60.0% and 55.3%, respectively. For the comparison group, they were 91.6%, 91.6% and 63.2%, respectively. After the action, approximately 50% of patients obtained more than 180 days of prescription drugs for a six-month period.", 
    "59": "The 2001 price adjustment action, based on generic grouping, significantly reduced the daily expense of each of the three classes of cardiovascular drugs. However, in response to this policy change, hospitals in Taiwan tended to greatly expand the volume of drugs prescribed for their regular patients. Consequently, the total expenditures for the three classes of drugs grew substantially after the action. These knock-on effects weakened the capability of the price adjustment action to control total pharmaceutical expenditures. This means that no saved resources were available for other health care uses. Such expansion of pharmaceutical consumption might also lead to inefficient use of the three drug classes: a large proportion of patients obtained more than one day of drugs per day in the post-action period, suggesting manipulation to increase reimbursement and offset price controls. We recommend that Taiwan's government use the NHI data to establish a monitoring system to detect inappropriate prescription patterns before implementing future policy changes. Such a monitoring system could then be used to deter hospitals from abusing their prescription volumes, making it possible to more effectively save health care resources by reducing drug reimbursement rates.",

It is estimated that there are around 1 million patients in Poland after myocardial infarction (MI) requiring medical care. Implementation of optimal treatment in these patients is a significant clinical and social problem.

Of particular importance is that all patients who have had an acute MI should receive optimal treatment with a combination of the drugs that are recommended as class I by the ESC guidelines. Recent registries showed that some of these drugs, including aspirin, clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and statins, are commonly used in clinical practice in Poland. Recently, it has been highlighted that pharmacological therapy in MI patients should be extended by adding newer agents of the class I recommendations such as omega-3 acid ethyl esters and in selected patients, eplerenone.",

Objectives. We evaluated TAFI concentrations in patients with essential hypertension in relation to blood pressure. Additionally, we studied TAFI activator, thrombin activity (thrombin-antithrombin complexes--TAT, prothrombin fragments F1 + 2), thrombomodulin (TM)--a marker of endothelial cell injury, degree of plasmin generation (plasmin-antiplasmin complexes [PAP]), other markers of endothelial cell injury--von Willebrand factor (vWF).", 
    "62": "Seventy-two patients with essential hypertension (27 untreated, 13 treated with enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI]), 32 with beta-blocker, betaxolol). In every hypertensive patients ambulatory blood pressure measurements and echocardiography were performed.", 
    "63": "All hypertensive patients did not differ with respect to age, creatinine, fibrinogen, D-dimers. In ACEI-treated patients a significantly higher TAFI concentration was observed when compared to beta-blocker-treated patients. In beta-blocker-treated patients both diastolic and systolic blood pressure were lower than in ACEI treated patients as well as ejection fraction, while serum triglycerides were higher. Diastolic blood pressure correlated significantly with TAFI concentrations in untreated patients (r = 0.27, p < 0.05), and in beta-blocker-treated patients (r = 0.25, p = 0.05), TAFI activity was inversely associated with interventricular septal diameter (r = -0.75, p < 0.01) in patients treated with ACEI.", 
    "64": "Elevated TAFI concentrations and enhanced thrombin generation in hypertensive patients may contribute to atherosclerosis progression in this population. Differences in the studied parameters may be due to a small sample size, monotherapy and potential effects of antihypertensive drugs on glicemia, ejection fraction and triglycerides.", 
    "65": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to lower central augmentation index (cAI), an index of arterial wave reflection, more than beta-blockers. We tested whether this is also true for long-term treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).", 
    "66": "One-hundred and fifty-six subjects with essential hypertension were randomised to treatment with either irbesartan or atenolol. cAI and central blood pressure (BP) were determined by pulse wave analysis from the radial and the carotid artery after six and after 18 months treatment.", 
    "67": "Peripheral and central systolic and diastolic BP were reduced to a similar extent in the two groups. cAI was reduced with irbesartan, but increased with atenolol (derived from the carotid artery: -6+/-10 vs. -4+/-12% after six months, p<0.001; -4+/-12 vs. +1+/-11% after 18 months; p=0.011). Furthermore, central to peripheral pulse pressure (PP) amplification was unaffected by treatment with irbesartan, but decreased with atenolol.", 
    "68": "Although treatment with irbesartan and atenolol similarly decreased peripheral and central BP, only treatment with irbesartan had beneficial effects on arterial wave reflection and preserved PP amplification. These haemodynamic effects may at least partly explain the reported differential effects of ARB versus beta-blocker treatment on cardiovascular mortality in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "69": "Pharmacological treatment of hypertension is effective in preventing cardiovascular and renal complications. Calcium antagonists (CAs) and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists (ARBs)] are widely used today to initiate antihypertensive treatment but, when given as monotherapy, do not suffice in most patients to normalise blood pressure (BP). Combining a CA and either an ACE-inhibitor or an ARB considerably increases the antihypertensive efficacy, but not at the expense of a deterioration of tolerability. Several fixed-dose combinations are available (CA + ACE-inhibitors: amlodipine + benazepril, felodipine + ramipril, verapamil + trandolapril; CA + ARB: amlodipine + valsartan). They are expected not only to improve BP control, but also to facilitate long-term adherence with antihypertensive therapy, thereby providing maximal protection against the cardiovascular and renal damage caused by high BP.", 
    "70": "Cardioprotection with beta-receptor antagonists improves outcome in high risk patients undergoing elective surgery. Recent trials have demonstrated an association between beta blocker (BB) use and improved outcomes after injury. The mechanisms through which BB result in improved outcomes remain poorly elucidated. In vitro evidence supports that BB modulates the postinjury inflammatory response. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of BB on inflammatory profiles in injured patients at increased risk for heart disease.", 
    "71": "A pseudo-randomized, controlled trial of injured patients over 55 admitted to the intensive care unit was conducted. Patients were randomized to receive continuous BB or standard of care. Patients with a reported history of prehospital BB use were enrolled into an observational arm of the trial, continued on BB, and analyzed with the continuous BB group. Plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline and day 1, 2, and 4 after BB initiation. Cytokine data were log transformed for normality assumptions. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test for within-group differences in cytokine levels over time.", 
    "72": "Forty-two patients were enrolled. Seventeen patients were randomized to the control group and 25 patients received continuous BB (10 randomized/15 observational). There was no difference in gender, age, prior history of heart disease, or admission heart rate, systolic blood pressure or initial base deficit between groups. Baseline levels of IL-6 and IL-1beta did not differ between groups. Levels of IL-6, but not IL-1beta, decreased over time in patients receiving BB (p = 0.04), whereas levels in controls remained unchanged (p = 0.27). There were no BB related complications.",

    "74": "Intense exercise decreases the cerebral metabolic ratio of oxygen to carbohydrates [O(2)/(glucose + (1/2)lactate)], but whether this ratio is influenced by adrenergic stimulation is not known. In eight males, incremental cycle ergometry increased arterial lactate to 15.3 +/- 4.2 mm (mean +/- s.d.) and the arterial-jugular venous (a-v) difference from -0.02 +/- 0.03 mm at rest to 1.0 +/- 0.5 mm (P < 0.05). The a-v difference for glucose increased from 0.7 +/- 0.3 to 0.9 +/- 0.1 mm (P < 0.05) at exhaustion and the cerebral metabolic ratio decreased from 5.5 +/- 1.4 to 3.0 +/- 0.3 (P < 0.01). Administration of a non-selective beta-adrenergic (beta(1) + beta(2)) receptor antagonist (propranolol) reduced heart rate (69 +/- 8 to 58 +/- 6 beats min(-1)) and exercise capacity (239 +/- 42 to 209 +/- 31 W; P < 0.05) with arterial lactate reaching 9.4 +/- 3.6 mm. During exercise with propranolol, the increase in a-v lactate difference (to 0.5 +/- 0.5 mm; P < 0.05) was attenuated and the a-v glucose difference and the cerebral metabolic ratio remained at levels similar to those at rest. Together with the previous finding that the cerebral metabolic ratio is unaffected during exercise with administration of the beta(1)-receptor antagonist metropolol, the present results suggest that the cerebral metabolic ratio decreases in response to a beta(2)-receptor mechanism.", 
    "75": "Cardiovascular medications are ubiquitous and are frequently implicated in accidental or intentional overdose. It is common that combined use of these drugs may lead to hypotension and even shock, followed by metabolic derangements. We report a case in which an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was used in the management of self-poisoning with verapamil, amlodipine, metoprolol, and ibuprofen. In presenting this case of combined massive drug ingestion, we outline early strategy in the Emergency Department and some alternative treatment options. Beyond pharmacological and conservative procedures, we implemented an invasive approach that included temporary pacing, mechanical ventilation, and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP). Such intense treatment was necessary due to the critical state of the patient. In our opinion, the use of the IABP contributed to the final recovery of our adolescent patient. Combined mechanical and pharmacological treatment may protect from multi-organ insufficiency, including permanent central nervous system injury. It is hoped that reporting our experience will raise awareness of alternative treatment options for ingestions of cardiovascular medications.", 
    "76": "Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor but most patients remain asymptomatic for many years. Successful therapy not only needs to be effective, it also needs to be well tolerated. beta-blockers are well established as effective antihypertensive agents. However, one major drawback to the currently available beta-blockers, particularly the noncardioselective beta-blockers, is their side-effect profile, including sexual dysfunction, fatigue, depression and metabolic abnormalities such as impaired glucose tolerance and lipid abnormalities. Nebivolol (Bystolic), a novel, highly cardioselective, third-generation beta-blocker that recently received approval by the US FDA for the treatment of hypertension in the USA, is effective in treating blood pressure and has a favorable side-effect profile. Studies conducted in Europe, where nebivolol has been available for some time for the treatment of hypertension, have shown that nebivolol achieves blood pressure reductions comparable to other beta-blockers but with fewer side effects. Additionally, nebivolol has demonstrated similar efficacy in blood pressure reduction when compared with calcium channel blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. When combined with hydrochlorothiazide there was an additive antihypertensive effect. Lastly, nebivolol exhibits a vasodilatory property that is related to its effect on nitric oxide, an intrinsic vasodilator produced in the vascular endothelium. Nebivolol enhances nitric oxide bioavailability. Studies have also demonstrated nebivolol's ability to function as an antioxidant and decrease markers of oxidative stress. These effects are believed to ultimately produce a modulation of the endothelial dysfunction typically seen in hypertension.", 
    "77": "The purpose of the present study is to develop and evaluate the potential of nanoemulsions for increasing the solubility and the in vitro transdermal delivery of carvedilol. Pseudoternary phase diagrams were developed and various nanoemulsion formulations were prepared using oleic acid and isopropyl myristate (IPM) (1:1) as the oil, Tween 80 as surfactant, and Transcutol P as cosurfactant. The prepared nanoemulsions were subjected to physical stability tests. Transdermal permeation of carvedilol through rat abdominal skin was determined with Keshary-Chien diffusion cell. Significant increase (P < 0.05) in the steady state flux (Jss) and permeability coefficient (Kp) was observed in nanoemulsion formulations as compared to control or drug-loaded neat components. The highest value of these permeability parameters was obtained in optimized formulation B3, which consisted of 0.5% w/w of carvedilol, 6% w/w of oleic acid:IPM (1:1), 22.5% w/w of Tween 80, 22.5% w/w of Transcutol P, and 49% w/w of distilled water and in which the solubility of the drug was 4500-fold higher. The optimized nanoemulsion was characterized for pH, conductivity, viscosity, droplet size, droplet shape, and refractive index. Thermodynamic studies showed that there had been a significant decrease of 88% in activation energy (Eact) when the drug was incorporated in nanoemulsion. The irritation studies suggested that the optimized nanoemulsion was a non-irritant transdermal delivery system.", 
    "78": "Congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysms are extremely rare in Spain. The lesion consists of a defect that allows the aortic media to separate from the annulus fibrosus of the aortic valve, causing it to dilate with arterial pressure. The natural course of the aneurysm involves the risk of complication due to bacterial endocarditis, with conduction blocks or myocardial ischemia. Rupture of the aneurysm, usually into a right chamber, causes a left-right shunt that leads to heart failure and death if untreated. We present the case of a previously asymptomatic 60-year-old woman who presented with a clinical picture that led to a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, and in whom there occurred a coincident rupture of a congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. We describe the anesthetic procedure and emphasize the importance of intraoperative echocardiography throughout the resection of the aneurysm.", 
    "79": "The present work investigates effectiveness of basil oil, a volatile oil containing alcoholic terpenes, as a potential penetration enhancer for improved skin permeation of labetolol hydrochloride (LHCl) with reference to camphor, geraniol, thymol, and clove oil. Saturation solubilities of LHCl were determined in water, vehicle (ethanol:water, 60:40 v/v) and vehicle containing 5% w/v terpenes. Comparable (P > 0.05) saturation solubilities were found suggesting an insignificant increase in LHCl flux across rat skin on account of thermodynamic activity. Permeation of LHCl in vehicle per se and in presence of 5% w/v enhancer was investigated by performing in vitro rat abdominal skin permeation studies using a side-by-side glass diffusion cell. Various parameters viz. steady state flux, permeability coefficient, lag time, partition coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and enhancement ratios (ER) were calculated from the permeation data. Basil oil produced the maximum enhancement (ER = 46.52) over neat vehicle, among all enhancers. Activation energies for LHCl permeation in water, vehicle per se and in presence of 5% w/v basil oil were found to be 23.16, 18.71, and 10.98 kcal/mole, respectively. Lowering of activation energy in presence of basil oil suggests creation of new polar pathways in the skin for enhanced permeation of LHCl. Basil oil is proposed as a promising penetration enhancer for improved transdermal drug delivery of labetolol.",

The survival rate was best in the High dose group. Left ventricular hypertrophy and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the myocardium were significantly attenuated in the High dose group, but not in the Low dose group, and oxidative stress was most suppressed in the High dose group.

HFPEF accounts for nearly 50% of cases of heart failure, and its prevalence is increasing as the population ages. It is seen most often as acute rapid-onset or flash pulmonary edema, in a patient with no or few symptoms except for these acute episodes, often associated with a precipitating factor. Diagnosis of HFPEF is facilitated by the development of plasma assays of natriuretic peptides and of Doppler echocardiography. Its causes, which must be identified, are mainly hypertensive, diabetic or ischemic cardiomyopathy, often combined. Its prognosis is similar to that of systolic heart failure and leads to frequent hospitalization for acute decompensation. Its treatment calls for the same therapeutic arsenal as for systolic heart failure, except among patients with diabetes.",

Esmolol is also the drug of choice in ect sessions for patients without cardiovascular risk factors but who develop prolonged hypertension or tachycardia. A possible alternative is labetalol, but its longer half-life is a disadvantage, particularly if it is administered in a high dose.

In situ hybridization data revealed an intense distribution of beta1-and beta2-adrenoceptor mRNA in the BLA. Real-time PCR analysis of rat amygdala revealed significant transcriptional expression levels of both beta-adrenoceptors, with beta2-adrenoceptors outnumbering beta1-adrenoceptors in a ratio of 2.9 to 1. Bath application of the selective beta1-adrenoceptor agonist xamoterol hemifumarate (10 microM) facilitated the excitatory field synaptic potential evoked in the BLA by stimulation of the external capsule by 186.5+/-10.7% of control amplitude. In the presence of the selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol hydrochloride (30 microM), the facilitating effects of field excitatory synaptic potential induced by the agonist were reduced to 126.1+/-2.3 % of control amplitude in the BLA. Bath application of the selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonist salmeterol (15 microM) facilitated the excitatory field synaptic potential evoked in the BLA by stimulation of the external capsule by 167.3+/-9.7 % of control amplitude. In the presence of the selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 HCl (30 microM), the facilitating effects of field excitatory synaptic potential induced by the agonist were reduced to 121.1+/-4.1 % of control amplitude in the BLA.

    "119": "Monitoring surveys throughout America and Europe have demonstrated the widespread presence of organic synthetic substances such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals in surface water. To avoid deleterious effects on the aquatic system, many countries determine water quality criteria for pesticides. For each substance, the comparison of the concentration measured in water with its criterion gives an indication of the pressure this substance put on the aquatic system. However, in the environment, aquatic organisms are not only exposed to single pesticides but typically to mixtures of these substances. It is therefore of particular importance to take mixtures into account when defining water quality criteria, which is rarely done yet. We recently developed a method to define consistent and comparable water quality criteria for mixtures of herbicides having a similar mode of action. These criteria are calculated based on species sensitivity curves; the method assumes that these curves are parallel for substances having similar mode of action. The aim of this study was to apply our method to six organophosphates (insecticides) and to three \u03b2-blockers (pharmaceuticals), other groups of compounds commonly detected in surface water. We found some evidence that the developed methodology gives consistent results for these groups too. The hypothesis of parallelism was accepted in 2/3 (\u03b2-blockers) and 2/6 of the cases (organophosphates) for both species sensitivity curves based on effect concentrations 50% and on no-observed effect concentrations. The use of water quality criteria for mixture is illustrated by two case studies, which show the importance of taking mixtures into account in water quality legislation.", 
    "120": "Bradyarrhythmias (BA) have been reported in patients with sleep apnea (SA), but the incidence of SA in patients with BA remains unclear. A case-control study was conducted to assess the prevalence of high-risk features of SA in patients with documented BA on 24-hour Holter monitoring compared with patients without BA. Controls were age-matched patients selected from those with no evidence of BA on 24-hour Holter monitoring. BA were defined as the presence of pauses of >3 seconds, regardless of the mechanism, and/or heart rate <40 beats/min during presumed waking hours (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.). High-risk features of SA were determined by the Berlin Questionnaire, with positive results defined as having '2 of 3 positive high-risk categories. Body mass index (BMI), hypertension, beta-blocker use, and other underlying characteristics were cataloged. Nineteen patients with documented BA and 47 with no BA were identified. The mean ages and BMIs in the active and control groups were not statistically significant. High-risk features for SA were present in 57.8% of patients in the BA group compared with 21.3% in the control group (p = 0.003). After controlling for age, BMI, hypertension, and beta-blocker use, patients with BA were 6 times more likely to have high-risk features of SA compared with those without BA (logistic regression odds ratio 6.1, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 24, p = 0.012). In conclusion, irrespective of BMI, age, and other underlying risk factors, the presence of daytime BA was highly associated with high-risk features of SA.",

We describe 8 patients who presented with exercise-induced symptoms as adults, have a negative family history, and responded to beta-blocker therapy. The study evaluated exercise treadmill electrocardiographic data from patients referred for exercise-induced VA. Inclusion criteria consisted of development of bidirectional, pleomorphic, or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with exercise, adult age at first onset, negative family history, and no evidence of structural heart disease. We correlated VA configurations with respect to heart rate before and after beta-blocker therapy. Patients displayed a pattern of increasing ventricular complexity with increasing heart rate. The appropriate beta blocker (n = 7) or calcium channel blocker (n = 1) was defined as the dose that resulted in control of symptoms. Three patients showed suppression of VA with sinus tachycardia at peak heart rate. Six patients had decreased VA defined as absence of higher complexity arrhythmias. With drug therapy, average heart rate associated with premature ventricular complex couplets/triplets increased, whereas duration and complexity of premature ventricular complexes decreased. One patient had an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator placed but has had no discharges from the device since starting the appropriate beta blocker. In conclusion, these patients appear to respond well to beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker therapy with decreased ectopic complexity and an increased heart rate threshold for inducing VA.", 
    "122": "Little is presently known regarding whether a rhythm-control or a rate-control strategy is more frequently used in patients hospitalized for atrial fibrillation (AF). This study was conducted to assess patient and physician characteristics associated with each treatment strategy and with the use of anticoagulants. Hospitalizations for primary diagnoses of AF were examined using hospital claims from January 2000 to December 2004. Patients who received antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation, or cardioversion for AF were categorized as receiving rhythm control. Patients managed only with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin were categorized as receiving rate control. Characteristics associated with rhythm compared with rate control and anticoagulant use with CHADS(2) score were determined. The study cohort included 155,731 hospitalizations from 464 hospitals. Of these, 75,397 (48%) were categorized as involving rhythm control and 80,334 (52%) as involving rate control. Care by a noncardiologist (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31 to 0.36) and increasing age >65 years (adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.88) were associated with lower odds of rhythm versus rate control; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was associated with greater odds (adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.81 to 2.84) of rhythm control. Warfarin use was greater in the rhythm-control group compared with the rate-control group (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.52 to 1.60), and warfarin use was greater with a CHADS(2) score > or =2 (unadjusted OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.24). In conclusion, rhythm- and rate-control strategies were used equally in patients hospitalized for AF. Some observations, such as greater use of the rate-control strategy with increasing age, were consistent with recommendations, but others, such as lower use of warfarin in the rate-control group, were not.", 
    "123": "To evaluate whether the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) influenced the rate of prescription of evidence-based cardiovascular preventive therapies and attainment of therapeutic goals in patients with stable coronary heart disease, 7,884 patients (mean age 65.4 years; 81.7% men; 22.4% with CKD) attended to in 1,799 primary-care centers and who had had a coronary event requiring hospitalization in the previous 6 months to 10 years were recruited. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the MDRD Study equation. Results indicated that patients with CKD received more diuretics (47.6% vs 32.8%; p = 0.034), calcium channel blockers (29.3% vs 23.2%, p = 0.027); and blockers of the angiotensin-renin system (76.4% vs 65.3%; p <0.001). The lower prescription rate of antiaggregants, beta blockers, and statins in subjects with CKD did not reach statistical significance in multivariate analysis. A lower percentage of subjects with CKD achieved good control of blood pressure (39.2% vs 65.4%; p <0.001) and glycosylated hemoglobin (43.9% vs 53.4%; p <0.001) relative to patients without CKD. Only 11.8% of patients with CKD had optimum control of all risk factors. Using multivariate analysis, the presence of CKD was inversely related to the degree of risk-factor control, especially in groups with low GFR. In conclusion, patients with stable coronary heart disease and CKD attended to in primary-care centers had poorer control of coronary heart disease risk factors than those with normal GFR despite receiving a similar rate of prescription of evidence-based cardiovascular disease preventive therapies.", 
    "124": "Heart rhythm disorders in children are not different, on electrocardiographic trace, from heart rhythm disorders in adults with the exception of incidence which is different according to the age. Paticularly, atrial flutter (FlA) and fibrillation (FA) are very uncommon arrhythmias in the general pediatric population. Generally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, in our experience, is a temporary heart rhythm disturbance connected to specifical and resovable reasons with the exception of Fontain's surgical correction of congenital heart diseases or cardiopathies with dilatation of both atria. Presenting symptoms, symptom history (e.g., frequency, duration, and severity), risk assessment, previous response to alternative treatment options, convenience and patient preference for a specific treatment option, and costeffectiveness of a treatment option are among the many factors that should be considered. Treatment of atrial flutter and fibrillation in pediatric age involves several options: Pharmacological therapy, Transoesophageal atrial pacing (TEAP), Electrical cardioversion and Catheter ablation. In this review we evaluated the physiopathology, the clinical features and the current terapeutical strategies for these arrythmias in paediatric age.", 
    "125": "Atrio-ventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is a rare supra-ventricular tachycardia (SVT) in children and becomes more frequent in adolescents. Most of children with an AVNRT have a healthy heart thus rarely experiencing severe symptoms. Because of haemodynamic instability or risk of complications, recurrences of SVT may require a chronic therapy. Interruption of dual atrio-ventricular nodal physiology is the basic mechanism to terminate AVNRT. This may be achieved by using anti-arrhythmic drugs or through Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RF). We aim to review the literature on the use of anti-arrhythmic drugs for the management of AVNRT in children aged more than 1 year and discuss the recommended dosages and the duration of a long term therapy. In the absence of comparative trials of risks and benefits between pharmacological therapy and RF and because of a greater clinical experience with anti-arrhythmic drugs, these last but not the least continue to be first-line therapy in the management of most SVT in children. Trials on pharmacotherapy in children with SVT in general and AVNRT in particular are lacking, use of anti-arrhythmic drugs being extrapolated from adult literature. Although Adenosine is becoming more used since it is the safest and effective drug in the acute setting, Digoxin continue to be the drug of first choice. Beta-blockers and Class I anti-arrhythmic are the second choice drugs with Flecainide being the preferred anti-arrhythmic drug for treatment failures. Amiodarone is rarely used as a chronic therapy in resistant cases. With the new advances in the RF technology, this therapy is becoming more safe and effective for AVNRT in children. Therefore, additional well-designed controlled trials are needed to further evaluate the comparative efficacy of anti-arrhythmic drugs in the management of AVNRT in children, as well as to evaluate dosing and toxicity in various age groups and determine the duration of a chronic therapy as compared to a potential RF.", 
    "126": "Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) is the most common cause of supraventricular tachycardia in young children. In nearly 70% of cases, there is manifest preexcitation on electrocardiogram. In the rest, the accessory pathway is concealed. Drugs control AVRT by affecting conduction through the atrioventricular node (beta-blockers, digoxin, verapamil) or accessory pathway (flecainide, propafenone) or both (sotalol, amiodarone). Adenosine is the drug of choice in acute management of AVRT in hemodynamically stable children. In adenosine-resistant cases, intravenous flecainide, procainamide, esmolol, propafenone and amiodarone are other treatment options. Hypotension and bradycardia can occur during administration of these drugs. Verapamil may be used to treat AVRT using a concealed pathway. Verapamil should be avoided in infants and in patients with decreased cardiac function. In chronic management, catheter ablation is the preferred treatment in older children with frequent AVRT. In infants and small children, ablation is associated with higher risk, and pharmacologic management is recommended. Beta-blockers are the preferred first line drugs for chronic management. In patients with concealed accessory pathway, digoxin and calcium channel blockers are alternative options. Sotalol, flecainide, propafenone and amiodarone can be prescribed in resistant cases. Flecainide and propafenone should be avoided in children with structurally abnormal hearts because of a higher risk of proarrhythmia. The initiation of flecainide, propafenone and sotalol therapy is recommended in an inpatient setting to monitor for proarrhythmias.", 
    "127": "Tachyarrhythmias can occur at any age from the developing fetus through adulthood. However, in deference to adult-onset ischemic cardiac issues, abnormal heart rhythms occurring in the young are often due to developmental alterations of the cardiac conduction tissue, genetically-inherited changes of myocardial cellular ion membrane properties and both pre- and post-surgical repair of associated structural congenital heart anatomical defects. And different from adults, abnormal rhythms occurring in the young can spontaneously disappear with progressive patient growth. Both supra- and ventricular tachyarrhythmias occur in the young although atrial rhythm abnormalities far exceed those of the ventricle. In both, pharmacologic therapies to alter tissue conduction and refractoriness remain the mainstay for initial intervention in the infant and young child, reserving more invasive and potentially harmful ablation therapies for drug-refractory cases. The purpose of the review is to present common and uncommon tachyarrhythmias which can occur in the fetus and throughout infancy. Emphasis will be placed on their electrocardiographic identification, recognition of any associated structural congenital heart defects and recommended pharmacologic management. Drug therapies will be divided according to mechanism of action and discussions of which particular agent is potentially best-suited to treat which specific tachyarrhythmia.

    "134": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a common condition that may be lethal when it is unrecognized. Current guidelines suggest repair as the aneurysm diameter reaches 5.0 to 5.5 cm. Most aortic aneurysms are detected incidentally when imaging is done for other purposes or through screening programs. Ninety percent of these aneurysms are below the threshold for intervention at the time of detection. A number of studies have sought to determine factors that lead to progression of aneurysmal disease that might be amenable to intervention during this period of observation. We review these studies and make recommendations for the medical management of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. On the basis of our current knowledge of the causes of aneurysm, a number of approaches have been proposed to prevent progression of aneurysmal disease. These include hemodynamic management, inhibition of inflammation, and protease inhibition. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association clinical practice guidelines rules of evidence have helped to define strength of evidence to support these approaches. Level A evidence (from large randomized trials) is available to indicate that observation of small aneurysms in men is safe up to a size of 5.5 cm and that propranolol does not inhibit aneurysm expansion. Level B evidence (from small randomized trials) suggests that roxithromycin or doxycycline will decrease the rate of aneurysm expansion. A number of studies agree that tobacco use is associated with an increased rate of aneurysm expansion. Level B and C evidence is available to suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) may inhibit aneurysm expansion. There are animal data but no human data demonstrating that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, will decrease the rate of AAA expansion. A pharmacological agent without important side effects that inhibited aneurysm expansion could change current approaches to aneurysm treatment. Additional studies are needed to clarify the potential role of doxycycline, roxithromycin, and statin therapy in the progression of aneurysmal disease.",

The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 4736 subjects with isolated systolic hypertension aged >or=60 years. Atrial fibrillation was an exclusion criterion from the trial. Participants were randomly assigned to stepped care treatment with chlorthalidone and atenolol (n=2365) or placebo (n=2371). The occurrence of atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular events over 4.7 years as well as the determination of cause of death at 4.7 and 14.3 years were followed. Ninety-eight subjects (2.06%) developed atrial fibrillation over 4.7 years mean follow-up, without significant difference between treated and placebo groups. Atrial fibrillation increased the risk for: total cardiovascular events (RR 1.69; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.36), rapid death (RR 3.29; 95% CI 1.08 to 10.00), total (RR 5.10; 95% CI 3.12 to 8.37) and nonfatal left ventricular failure (RR 5.31; 95% CI 3.09 to 9.13).

    "136": "Hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Antihypertensive treatment, particularly blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, contributes to prevent atherosclerosis-mediated cardiovascular events. Direct comparison of different antihypertensive treatments on atherosclerosis and particularly plaque stabilization is sparse. ApoE(-/-) mice with vulnerable (2-kidney, 1-clip renovascular hypertension model) or stable (1-kidney, 1-clip renovascular hypertension model) atherosclerotic plaques were used. Mice were treated with aliskiren (renin inhibitor), irbesartan (angiotensin-receptor blocker), atenolol (beta-blocker), or amlodipine (calcium channel blocker). Atherosclerosis characteristics were assessed. Hemodynamic and hormonal parameters were measured. Aliskiren and irbesartan significantly prevented atherosclerosis progression in 2-kidney, 1-clip mice. Indeed, compared with untreated animals, plaques showed thinner fibrous cap (P<0.05); smaller lipid core (P<0.05); decreased media degeneration, layering, and macrophage content (P<0.05); and increased smooth muscle cell content (P<0.05). Interestingly, aliskiren significantly increased the smooth muscle cell compared with irbesartan. Despite similar blood pressure lowering, only partial plaque stabilization was attained by atenolol and amlodipine. Amlodipine increased plaque smooth muscle cell content (P<0.05), whereas atenolol decreased plaque inflammation (P<0.05). This divergent effect was also observed in 1-kidney, 1-clip mice. Normalizing blood pressure by irbesartan increased the plasma renin concentration (5932+/-1512 ng/mL per hour) more than normalizing it by aliskiren (16085+/-5628 ng/mL per hour). Specific renin-angiotensin system blockade prevents atherosclerosis progression. First, evidence is provided that direct renin inhibition mediates atherosclerotic plaque stabilization. In contrast, beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker treatment only partially stabilize plaques differently influencing atherogenesis. Angiotensin II decisively mediates plaque vulnerability. The plasma renin concentration measurement by an indirect method did not confirm the excessive increase of plasma renin concentration reported in the literature during aliskiren compared with irbesartan or amlodipine treatment.",

    "145": "Beta-blockers, eg, atenolol, are the cornerstone therapy for thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) in patients with Marfan syndrome; however, continued aortic dilatation has been reported. We have demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 were upregulated during progression of TAA in Marfan syndrome, accompanied with degenerated elastic fibers and vasomotor dysfunction. We hypothesized that doxycycline, a nonspecific inhibitor of MMPs, would ameliorate TAA by attenuating elastic fiber degeneration and improving vasomotor function. A well-characterized mouse model of Marfan syndrome (Fbn1(C1039G/+)) was used. Mice were untreated (n=40), given doxycycline (0.24 g/L, n=30), or given atenolol (0.5 g/L, n=30) in drinking water at 6 weeks of age. The Fbn1(+/+) mice served as control (n=40). At 3, 6, and 9 months, aortic segments from the ascending, arch, and descending portions were used to obtain the \"average\" value of the whole thoracic aorta. TAA was prevented in the doxycycline group, whereas mild aneurysm was evident in the atenolol group. Doxycycline improved elastic fiber integrity, normalized aortic stiffness, and prevented vessel weakening. The impairment of vasocontraction and endothelium-dependent relaxation in the untreated and atenolol groups were improved by doxycycline. The upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta in the Marfan aorta was suppressed by doxycycline. Doxycycline augmented expression ratios of tissue inhibitors of MMP to MMPs. Intraperitoneally injected neutralizing antibodies against MMP-2 and -9 yielded similar effects to doxycycline. We concluded that long-term treatment with doxycycline, through the inhibition of MMP-2 and -9, is more effective than atenolol in preventing TAA in Marfan syndrome by preserving elastic fiber integrity, normalizing vasomotor function, and reducing transforming growth factor-beta activation.",

We tested the hypothesis that BP values recorded with the non-invasive Finapres device do not always produce sequences coincident with sequences detected from central BP measurements. Finapres recordings of resting BP in the finger, ascending aorta (Millar catheter-tip transducer) and ECG were obtained from 34 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, including 24 patients treated with betablockers. Coincidence of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) sequences was expressed by the sensitivity of the Finapres to detect a simultaneously occurring sequence in aortic pressure. The influence of different criteria to detect and accept sequences from beat-to-beat values of systolic BP (SBP) and cardiac interval (RRi) on the Finapres sensitivity was also assessed. The Finapres was able to detect 70.7% of all three beat intra-arterial sequences when the selection criteria was based on the correlation coefficient between SBP and RRi (>0.85), but decreased to 27.5% when the P-value of the linear regression was limited to 0.05. Changing the thresholds for minimum changes in SBP and RRi also had significant effects on sensitivity, as well as in the corresponding values of BRS. Significant differences in BRS were obtained between invasive and non-invasive estimates, but there was no difference between non-invasive estimates calculated from coincident and non-coincident sequences. Non-invasive, compared with intra-arterial estimates of BRS by sequence analysis are not influenced by coincidence of sequences if acceptance of sequences is based on the correlation coefficient criteria (>0.85).",

The aim of the present study was to determine whether the pineal gland and its secretory product melatonin regulate collagen accumulation in the scar of the infarcted heart and to explain the mechanisms of its action. To induce myocardial infarction in rats the left coronary artery was ligated. Metoprolol at the dose of 0.2 mg/100 g body weight (b.w.) was injected intraperitoneally to inhibit melatonin secretion. Pinealectomy was performed on some animals. For the in vitro study, cells were isolated from the heart scar and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 3% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Collagen content was evaluated as hydroxyproline content according to the Woessner method. Melatonin subcutaneously injected into the rats at the doses of 30 microg/100 g or 60 microg/100 g b.w. increased collagen accumulation in the heart scar. The doses of 3 microg/100 g b.w. and 300 microg/100 g b.w. were not effective. Surgical and pharmacological pinealectomies had opposite effects and reduced collagen content in the scar. However, melatonin administration (60 microg/100 g b.w.) to pinealectomized rats reversed the effect of pinealectomy and normalized collagen levels in heart after infarction. Cells isolated from the heart scar were identified as myofibroblasts. Melatonin (10(-7)-10(-8) m) increased collagen accumulation in the cultures. Collagen accumulation in the scar of the infarcted heart is regulated by melatonin and it exerts effects directly on the myofibroblasts of the infarcted area. Therefore, melatonin-induced collagen accumulation in the infarcted heart could be considered as the event improving the tensile strength of the scar and retarding the development of complications.",

The drugs differ in molecular weight and degree of dissociation in aqueous environments; both are parameters that significantly influence drug diffusivity. AZ, DP, and TM-loaded cylindrical rods (10 mm length, 0.6 mm diameter) were fabricated by photoinduced cross-copolymerization of PPF and N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP) in molds. The released amounts of AZ, DP, TM, and NVP were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The effects of drug properties and loading on the release kinetics were investigated. The in vitro release of AZ, DP, and TM was well sustained from the polymer matrices over a period of approximately 210, 270, and 250 days, respectively. The release kinetics correlated with the HPLC retention profiles of the different drugs. Following a small initial burst release (<10%), a dual modality release controlled by diffusion and bulk erosion was found for all drugs. Drug release rates of up to 4 microg/day were reached. Matrix drug loading generally affected the extent of the burst release, release kinetics, as well as the matrix water content and matrix degradation that were determined gravimetrically.

The objective of this study was to investigate the secretion and physiological function of annexin B1. We expressed a green fluorescent protein-tagged annexin B1 (GFP-anxB1) in living SiHa cells and showed that it was secreted upon stimulation with dexamethasone (Dex). This secretion was not inhibited by brefeldin A but was blocked by pre-treatment with the intracellular calcium-specific chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM). Furthermore, we describe for the first time that annexin B1 can bind to the extracellular surface of human eosinophils and produce Ca(2+)-influx. The Ca(2+)-influx induced apoptosis in eosinophils, which was inhibited by pre-loading the Ca(2+) channel blocker 1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-metho-xyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole, HCl (SKF-96365).

MSCTA with 64-slice CT scanners has successfully been validated for the evaluation of clinically relevant lumen reduction of the coronary arteries with high negative predictive values and for the simultaneous assessment of pulmonary embolism, coronary artery stenoses, and aortic dissection and aneurysm in patients with chest pain (\"triple rule out\"). However, certain limitations continue to exist including partial volume effects due to heavy calcium deposits in the coronary artery wall, impaired assessability of coronary artery branches smaller than 2 mm in diameter, and impaired assessability of patients with a high heart rate and/or arrhythmia. While MSCT has mainly been tested to detect obstructive CAD, an accurate assessment of regional and global ventricular function, as well as of the aortic and mitral valves, might be feasible using DSCT, since image reconstruction is possible in virtually any phase of the cardiac cycle with a sufficiently high temporal resolution. DSCT is a robust method for the evaluation of patients with higher heart rates and arrhythmias and, in most cases, obviates the need for beta-blocker premedication.

Short-term treatment effects were not related to prognosis.", 
    "212": "Low time domain HRV carries independent prognostic information regarding cardiovascular death in stable angina pectoris. The simple DI method provided equally good or better prognostic information than conventional, more laborious HRV methods.", 
    "213": "Dopamine is used to treat heart failure, particularly after cardiac surgery in infants, but the mechanisms of action are unclear. We investigated differences in the effect of dopamine on L-type calcium current (I(Ca)) between newborn (NB, 1-4 days) and adult (AD, 3-4 mo) rabbit ventricular myocytes. Myocytes were enzymatically dissociated from NB and AD rabbit hearts. I(Ca) was recorded by using the whole cell patch-clamp technique. mRNA levels of cardiac dopamine receptor type 1 (D1), type 2 (D2), and beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Dopamine (100 microM) increased I(Ca) more in NB (E(max) 87 +/- 10%) than in AD ventricular cells (E(max) 21 +/- 3%). Further investigation of this difference showed that mRNA levels of the D1 receptor were significantly higher in NB, and, with beta-AR blockade, dopamine increased I(Ca) more in NB than AD cells. Additionally, SKF-38393 (selective D1 receptor agonist) significantly increased I(Ca) by 55 +/- 4% in NB (P < 0.05, n = 4) and by 11 +/- 1% in AD (P < 0.05, n = 6). Dopamine in the presence of SCH-23390 (D1 receptor antagonist) increased I(Ca) in NB cells by 67 +/- 5% and by 22 +/- 2% in AD cells, suggesting a role for beta-AR stimulation. Selective blockade of beta(1)- or beta(2)-receptors (with block of D1 receptors) showed that the beta-AR action of dopamine in the NB was largely mediated via beta(2)-AR activation. Dopamine produces a larger increase in I(Ca) in NB cardiomyocytes compared with ADs. The mechanism of action is not only through beta(2)-ARs but also due to higher expression of cardiac D1 receptor in NB.", 
    "214": "We evaluated correlates of prolonged use of evidence-based therapies in patients discharged after non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS).", 
    "215": "598 cardiologists enrolled 2443 patients at outpatient clinics 2-12 months after discharge for NSTE ACS. The use of cardiac medications for secondary prevention (antiplatelets, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzymes, and statins) was evaluated.", 
    "216": "A total of 2386 (97.7%) patients were on either antiplatelet monotherapy (n=623, 26.1%) or combination therapy (n=1763, 73.9%) at follow-up. Combination antiplatelet therapy declined by 23 percentage points (82.3% to 59.4%) 9-12 months after discharge, whereas use of other cardiac medications remained constant or increased. After multivariable analysis, the strongest predictors of combination antiplatelet therapy were PCI with a stent (odds ratio [OR] 3.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.12-6.67), drug-eluting stents (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.73-6.08), late PCI (OR 3.21, 95% CI 2.12-4.87) and statins at discharge (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.40-2.80). Among the independent predictors of beta-blocker and statin use were extent of coronary artery disease and cardiac medications prescribed at discharge.", 
    "217": "After NSTE ACS, implementation of recommendations on long-term use of evidence-based therapies depends largely on in-hospital management. A variety of clinical characteristics are also predictive of long-term use.", 
    "218": "Beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization through activation of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 is an important mechanism of early cardiac dysfunction after brain death. We hypothesized that acute beta-blockade can prevent myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization after brain death through attenuation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 activity, resulting in improved cardiac function.", 
    "219": "Adult pigs underwent either sham operation, induction of brain death, or treatment with esmolol (beta-blockade) for 30 minutes before and 45 minutes after brain death (n = 8 per group). Cardiac function was assessed at baseline and for 6 hours after the operation. Myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor signaling was assessed 6 hours after operation by measuring sarcolemmal membrane adenylate cyclase activity, beta-adrenergic receptor density, and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 expression and activity.", 
    "220": "Baseline left ventricular preload recruitable stroke work was similar among sham, brain death, and beta-blockade groups. Preload recruitable stroke work was significantly decreased 6 hours after brain death versus sham, and beta-blockade resulted in maintenance of baseline preload recruitable stroke work relative to brain death and not different from sham. Basal and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were preserved in the beta-blockade group relative to the brain death group and were not different from the sham group. Left ventricular G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 expression and activity in the beta-blockade group were markedly decreased relative to the brain death group and similar to the sham group. Beta-adrenergic receptor density was not different among groups.", 
    "221": "Acute beta-blockade before brain death attenuates beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and preserves early cardiac function after brain death. These data support the hypothesis that acute beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization is an important mechanism in early ventricular dysfunction after brain death. Future studies with beta-blocker therapy immediately after brain death appear warranted.", 
    "222": "Hypertension is a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality and is combined with additional CV risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, smoking and obesity in many hypertensive individuals. The prevention of CV disease with antihypertensive therapy has been widely demonstrated, with a 30-40% reduction in stroke and a 20% reduction in coronary events in patients receiving antihypertensive drugs compared with untreated hypertensive individuals. Even small decreases in blood pressure (BP) correlate with a significantly lower incidence of CV events; this is independent of drug class used, but dependent on the extent of BP reduction achieved. All antihypertensive drugs lower BP to a similar extent and are suitable for long-term therapy. Treatment guidelines recommend that antihypertensive treatment should be initiated early to reach a target BP value of \u2264140/90 mmHg, or lower in high-risk patients, in order to maximize the long-term benefits in CV mortality and morbidity reduction. However, the proportion of patients responding to monotherapy is generally low; therefore, first-line therapy with a combination of antihypertensive drugs is recommended in non-responders and those with multiple risk factors or subclinical organ damage. The combination of \u03b2-blocker/thiazide diuretic is frequently used in clinical practice and as reference treatment in clinical trials. Nebivolol, a third-generation cardioselective vasodilatory \u03b2-blocker, shows an additive effect in reducing systolic and diastolic BP when combined with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). In monotherapy non-responders, the combination improves response and BP normalization rates compared with monotherapy. Since pharmacokinetic studies have shown that fixed-dose nebivolol-HCTZ therapy is bioequivalent to the two agents administered concomitantly, this combination is useful in monotherapy non-responders and for those who require rapid BP control to prevent end-organ damage. In addition, a simplified regimen improves patient compliance - a major obstacle to achieving target BP levels. In addition to providing enhanced BP reduction and control, nebivolol-HCTZ is well tolerated, with a similar incidence of adverse events to that observed with either monotherapy, and a neutral impact on lipid and glucose metabolism."
