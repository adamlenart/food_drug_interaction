Adequate treatment often requires a combination of angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE)-inhibitors and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Metoprolol is still the most frequently used beta-adrenoceptor antagonist in this setting. Some clinical trials have shown carvedilol to be superior in improving the metabolic situation and prevention of secondary disorders caused by diabetes. Therefore carvedilol may be the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist of choice for treatment of patients at high cardiovascular risk and especially for diabetes type 2.

    "24": "Systolic anterior motion is an under-recognized cause of acute systemic hypotension during noncardiac surgery. This dynamic event has come to light with the introduction of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, which provides anatomic and functional images in real time. The cause of this abnormal motion is still uncertain, although it is thought that changes in the shape and function of the left ventricle allow displacement of the mitral valve annulus so that 1 or more leaflets can be pulled toward the outflow tract and obstruct it during the systole. It is important to recognize and diagnose this phenomenon as a cause of hypotension during noncardiac surgery because it can be treated with volume replacement and beta-blockers. The results of such measures can be monitored on intraoperative echocardiographic images. Volume replacement should increase the size of the ventricle and the beta-blockers should decrease the hyperdynamic state. We report a case of abnormal systolic motion during noncardiac surgery that was managed with the help of echocardiography.", 
    "25": "Structural analysis of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for hormones and neurotransmitters has been hindered by their low natural abundance, inherent structural flexibility, and instability in detergent solutions. Here we report a structure of the human beta2 adrenoceptor (beta2AR), which was crystallized in a lipid environment when bound to an inverse agonist and in complex with a Fab that binds to the third intracellular loop. Diffraction data were obtained by high-brilliance microcrystallography and the structure determined at 3.4 A/3.7 A resolution. The cytoplasmic ends of the beta2AR transmembrane segments and the connecting loops are well resolved, whereas the extracellular regions of the beta2AR are not seen. The beta2AR structure differs from rhodopsin in having weaker interactions between the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane (TM)3 and TM6, involving the conserved E/DRY sequences. These differences may be responsible for the relatively high basal activity and structural instability of the beta2AR, and contribute to the challenges in obtaining diffraction-quality crystals of non-rhodopsin GPCRs.", 
    "26": "Nebivolol is a highly selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist with vasodilator properties involving the vascular endothelium, but its effect on the smooth muscle cells (SMC) is still unclear. In this paper, we tested the effect of nebivolol on renal artery smooth muscle cells and investigated the cellular mechanism involved. To this purpose, the denuded renal arteries isolated from mice were studied in vitro using the myograph and the nitric oxide (NO) sensor techniques, while the SMC in culture were analyzed by the patch-clamp technique. The myograph technique was used to assay the vasodilator effect of nebivolol on the arterial muscular layer, and to establish the optimal dose of the drug to be tested on single SMC by the patch-clamp technique. Using both the myograph and the patch-clamp techniques, we examined the potential contribution of beta(2)-adrenoceptors and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels to the nebivolol-induced effects, by exposing the denuded arteries and SMC cultures to specific inhibitors such as butoxamine (100 micromol/l), tetraethylammonium (TEA, 1 mmol/l), and iberiotoxin (100 nmol/l). The direct measurement of NO using the NO sensor enabled us to evaluate if nebivolol induces/or not the release of NO in denuded renal arteries. The results of this study show that nebivolol exerts vasodilator effects on the SMC in the denuded renal arteries and the maximal response is achieved at a concentration of 50 micromol/l. Nebivolol effects involve binding to the beta(2)-adrenoceptors and the subsequent activation of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels in SMC, with no contribution of NO. Taken together, the study brings new insights into the mechanism underlying the nebivolol-induced arterial vasodilation.",

Although beta blockers improve cardiovascular outcomes, patients with COPD often do not receive them owing to concerns about possible adverse pulmonary effects. There are no published data about beta blocker use among inpatients with COPD exacerbations. A study was undertaken to identify factors associated with beta blocker use in this setting and to determine whether their use is associated with decreased in-hospital mortality.",

Sample preparation was performed by solid-phase extraction of 2 ml of human plasma using Oasis MCX cartridges and the enantioselective separations were achieved using a Chirobiotic V chiral stationary phase. The chromatography was carried out using gradient elution with a mobile phase composed of methanol:acetic acid:triethylamine which was varied from 100:0.05:0.04 to 100:0.05:0.1 (v/v/v) over 30 min and delivered at a flow rate 1 ml/min. The internal standard was R,S-propranolol-d7 and the analytes were quantified using a single quadrupole mass spectrometer employing APCI interface operated in the positive ion mode with single ion monitoring. The enantioselective separation factors, alpha, were 1.15 and 1.07 for S- and R-propranolol and R- and S-hyoscyamine, respectively. The standard curves were linear for all target compounds with coefficients of determination (r2) ranging from 0.9977 to 0.9999. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were <or=13.2% and <or=10.2%, respectively. The assay was used to analyze plasma samples from seven subjects who had received i.v. infusions of R,S-propranolol and R,S-hyoscyamine. The initial data indicate that R-propranolol was eliminated faster than S-propranolol (CL/f=2.34+/-0.13 L/kg min vs. 2.07+/-0.22 L/kg min) and that R-propranolol had a larger volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss/f=705+/-165 L/kg vs. 589+/-130 L/kg). In the case of R,S-hyoscyamine, S-hyoscyamine was eliminated faster than R-hyoscyamine (CL/f=0.0537+/-0.0073 L/kg min vs. 0.0439+/-0.0086 L/kg min), while the volumes of distribution at steady-state were similar for the hyoscyamine enantiomers (Vss/f=7.82+/-2.66 L/kg vs. 7.73+/-1.39 L/kg).",

Fifty patients formed our ascorbic acid group, and another 50 patients formed our control group. All patients were older than 50 years, were scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting, and had been treated with beta-blockers for at least 1 week before surgery. The mean age of the population was 60.19+/-7.14 years; 67% of the patients were men. Patients in the ascorbic acid group received 2 g of ascorbic acid on the night before the surgery and 1 g twice daily for 5 days after surgery. Patients in the control group received no ascorbic acid. Patients in both groups continued to receive beta-blockers after surgery. Telemetry monitoring was performed in the intensive care unit, and Holter monitoring was performed for 4 days thereafter. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 4% in the ascorbic acid group and 26% in the control group (odds ratio, 0.119; 95% confidence interval, 0.025-0.558, P = 0.002). We conclude that ascorbic acid is effective, in addition to being well-tolerated and relatively safe. Therefore, it can be prescribed as an adjunct to beta-blockers for the prophylaxis of post-bypass atrial fibrillation.",

Summary of Case- A previously healthy 64-year-old woman with no history of vascular disease was found unresponsive at home. She was taken to the emergency room where a CT head revealed an SAH due to a ruptured aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery. On admission, an ECG showed deeply inverted T-waves and QT prolongation, typical of SAH. Cardiac troponin was measured at 1.2 ng/mL, and later increased to 3.7 ng/mL. A transthoracic echocardiogram on the next day revealed a large left ventricular wall abnormality, characteristic of apical ballooning with an ejection fraction of 25% to 30%. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was started on low dose beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. She had an uneventful cardiac recovery within 5 days at which time a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction with no wall motion abnormality.",

Three trials compared laser trabeculoplasty with trabeculectomy. The risk of uncontrolled IOP was significantly higher in the trabeculoplasty group at six months but significant heterogeneity was observed at two years.

Different laser technology and protocol modalities were compared to the traditional laser trabeculoplasty and more evidence is necessary to determine if they are equivalent or not. There is no evidence to determine the effectiveness of laser trabeculoplasty compared to contemporary medication (prostaglandin analogues, topical anhydrase inhibitors and alpha2-agonists) and also with contemporary surgical techniques. Also there should be further investigation in to the effectiveness of laser trabeculoplasty in specific racial groups, specific diagnostic groups, such as pseudoexfoliation and pigmentary glaucoma and different stages of OAG.

The beta-AR density of patients with severe HF (New York Heart Association functional [NYHA] class III) was significantly lower than that of those with NYHA functional class I or class II HF (3.24 +/- 0.96 vs. 4.24 +/- 0.73 pmol/mL; P < 0.05).", 
    "61": "A reduction in beta-AR density measured by (11)C-CGP PET was observed in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. This downregulation may be due to the increased presynaptic sympathetic tone as assessed by (123)I-MIBG imaging.", 
    "62": "Although beta(2)-adrenoceptors represent 15-25% of beta-adrenoceptors in the guinea pig heart, their functionality is controversial. We assessed the inotropic effects of beta(2)-adrenoceptor partial agonists in right papillary muscles. Salbutamol induced a small but significant concentration-dependent negative inotropic effect (NIE, -5% at 60 nM) followed by a moderate positive inotropic effect (+36% at 6 microM) due to activation of beta(1)-adrenoceptors. In the presence of 4 microM atenolol, the concentration-dependent NIE (-12% at 6 microM) was biphasic, best described by a double logistic equation with respective EC(50) values of 3 and approximately 420 nM, and was insensitive to SR59230A. In muscles from pertussis toxin-treated guinea pigs, the salbutamol-induced positive inotropic effect was sensitive to low concentrations of ICI-118551 in an unusual manner. Experiments in reserpinized animals revealed the importance of the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes. PKA inhibition reduced and suppressed the effects obtained at low and high concentrations, respectively, indicating that its activation was a prerequisite to the NIE. The effect occurring at nanomolar concentrations depended upon PKA/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) activations leading to nitric oxide (NO) release via the arachidonic acid/cyclooxygenase pathway. NO release via PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor was responsible for the inotropic effect observed at submicromolar concentrations, which is negatively controlled by cPLA(2). The possibility that these effects are due to an equilibrium between different affinity states of the receptor (G(s)/G(i) coupled and G(i) independent with different signaling pathways) that can be displaced by ICI-118551 is discussed. We conclude that beta(2)-adrenoceptors are functional in guinea pig heart and can modulate the inotropic state.", 
    "63": "Curcuma longa is a main constituent of many traditional Chinese medicines, such as Xiaoyao-san, used to manage mental disorders effectively. Curcumin is a major active component of C. longa and its antidepressant-like effect has been previously demonstrated in the forced swimming test. The purpose of this study was to explore the possible contribution of serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the behavioral effects induced by curcumin in this animal model of depression. 5-HT was depleted by the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 100 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to the administration of curcumin, and the consequent results showed that PCPA blocked the anti-immobility effect of curcumin in forced swimming test, suggesting the involvement of the serotonergic system. Moreover, pre-treatment of pindolol (10 mg/kg, i.p., a beta-adrenoceptors blocker/5-HT(1A/1B) receptor antagonist), 4-(2'-methoxy-phenyl)-1-[2'-(n-2''-pyridinyl)-p-iodobenzamino-]ethyl-piperazine (p-MPPI, 1 mg/kg, s.c., a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist), or 1-(2-(1-pyrrolyl)-phenoxy)-3-isopropylamino-2-propanol (isamoltane, 2.5 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist) was found to prevent the effect of curcumin (10 mg/kg) in forced swimming test. On the other hand, a sub-effective dose of curcumin (2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a synergistic effect when given jointly with (+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, (8-OH-DPAT, 1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist), anpirtoline (0.25 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(1B) receptor agonist) or ritanserin (4 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist), but not with ketanserin (5 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist with higher affinity to 5-HT(2A) receptor) or R(-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI, 1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(2A) receptor agonist). Taken together, these results indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of curcumin in the forced swimming test is related to serotonergic system and may be mediated by, at least in part, an interaction with 5-HT(1A/1B) and 5-HT(2C) receptors.",

The present study was conducted to determine whether ELFEFs influence the neuronal differentiation of NSCs isolated from the brain cortices of newborn mice by modulating Ca(v)1-channel function. In cultures of differentiating NSCs exposed to ELFEFs (1 mT, 50 Hz), the percentage of cells displaying immunoreactivity for neuronal markers (beta-III-tubulin, MAP2) and for Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 channels was markedly increased. NSC-differentiated neurons in ELFEF-exposed cultures also exhibited significant increases in spontaneous firing, in the percentage of cells exhibiting Ca2+ transients in response to KCl stimulation, in the amplitude of these transients and of Ca2+ currents generated by the activation of Ca(v)1 channels. When the Ca(v)1-channel blocker nifedipine (5 microM) was added to the culture medium, the neuronal yield of NSC differentiation dropped significantly, and ELFEF exposure no longer produced significant increases in beta-III-tubulin- and MAP2-immunoreactivity rates. In contrast, the effects of ELFEFs were preserved when NSCs were cultured in the presence of either glutamate receptor antagonists or Ca(v)2.1- and Ca(v)2.2-channel blockers. ELFEF stimulation during the first 24 h of differentiation caused Ca(v)1-dependent increases in the number of cells displaying CREB phosphorylation. Our data suggest that ELFEF exposure promotes neuronal differentiation of NSCs by upregulating Ca(v)1-channel expression and function.",

    "83": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) molecular weight on the release kinetics of two ophthalmic model drugs, acetazolamide (AZ) and timolol maleate (TM), from matrices prepared by photo-induced copolymerization of PPF with N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP). PPF macromers of different number average molecular weight (M(n)) and polydispersity index (PI) were used in the experiments. Photo-crosslinked matrices were loaded with 5wt.% AZ or TM. The amounts of released drug and NVP were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The release kinetics of both drugs was influenced by the molecular weight of the constituent PPF macromer. An increased M(n) led to an increased burst release and an accelerated drug release. Dependent on the PPF M(n), the initial AZ loading was released within periods ranging from 35 days (M(n) = 3670, PI = 1.9) to 220 days (M(n) = 2050, PI=1.5). TM-loaded matrices revealed similar release kinetics dependent on the PPF M(n). The amount of released NVP from photo-crosslinked matrices during the course of a release experiment was independent of the PPF M(n) for both drugs. Matrix swelling and erosion were determined gravimetrically. The network structures of non-loaded matrices were further characterized by determining their crosslinking densities and the relative double bond conversions of fumaric acid (FAA) and NVP. Independent of PPF M(n), PPF and NVP similarly participated in the formation of the PPF/polyNVP copolymer network. The observed differences in drug release might therefore be explained by differences in the microstructural organization of the copolymer networks. Overall, the results demonstrate that drug release kinetics from photo-crosslinked PPF/polyNVP matrices is strongly dependent on the M(n) of the PPF macromer.",

    "88": "We planned to determine the primary effects and mechanisms of urocortin II, a member of the corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) family highly expressed in the cardiovascular system, on coronary blood flow and myocardial function in vivo. Urocortin II was infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery in 25 anaesthetized pigs whilst measuring haemodynamic variables, coronary blood flow, ventricular dP/dt(max) cardiac output and percentage of segmental shortening. This infusion was repeated after blockade of the autonomic nervous system, nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) or subtype 2 of the CRF receptors. In all experiments changes in heart rate and aortic blood pressure were prevented. Intra-coronary urocortin II increased, within 60 s, coronary blood flow (15+/-3.2%, P<0.05), dP/dt(max) (12.7+/-2.6%, P<0.05), cardiac output (16+/-2.3%, P<0.05) and percentage of segmental shortening (19.8+/-3.8%, P<0.05). Blockade of NOS abolished only the coronary effects whereas blockade of subtype 2 of the CRF receptors abolished all cardiac and coronary effects. It was shown for the first time that urocortin II administration primarily increases coronary blood flow and myocardial function through the release of nitric oxide and activation of subtype 2 of the CRF receptors in the anaesthetized pig. This provides a mechanism through which a local increase of urocortin II levels can help improve a compromised cardiovascular function.",

    "102": "We recently documented that paraplegia (T(5) spinal cord transection) alters cardiac electrophysiology and increases the susceptibility to ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by programmed electrical stimulation. However, coronary artery occlusion is the leading cause of death in industrially developed countries and will be the major cause of death in the world by the year 2020. The majority of these deaths result from tachyarrhythmias that culminate in ventricular fibrillation. beta-Adrenergic receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that chronic T(5) spinal cord transection increases the susceptibility to clinically relevant ischemia-reperfusion-induced sustained ventricular tachycardia due to enhanced sympathetic activity. Intact and chronic (4 wk after transection) T(5) spinal cord-transected (T(5)X) male rats were instrumented to record arterial pressure, body temperature, and ECG. In addition, a snare was placed around the left main coronary artery. The susceptibility to sustained ventricular tachycardia produced by 2.5 min of occlusion and reperfusion of the left main coronary artery was determined in conscious rats by pulling on the snare. Reperfusion culminated in sustained ventricular tachycardia in 100% of T(5)X rats (susceptible T(5)X, 10 of 10) and 0% of intact rats [susceptible intact, 0 of 10 (P < 0.05, T(5)X vs. intact)]. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade prevented reperfusion-induced sustained ventricular tachycardia in T(5)X rats [susceptible T(5)X 0 of 8, 0% (P < 0.05)].

Our hypothesis is that all these etiologies together led to the events but not in their typical mechanisms and raises the possibility that swallowing can be considered a carotid massage equivalent in patients with neck masses not physically extending to the carotid sinus.",

    "120": "The antidepressant selective serotonin transporter inhibitors (SSRIs) are clinically active after a delay of several weeks. Indeed, the rapid increase of serotonin (5-HT) caused by SSRIs, stimulates the 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors, which exert a negative feedback on the 5-HT neurotransmission. Only when autoreceptors are desensitized, can SSRIs exert their therapeutic activity. The 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist pindolol has been used to accelerate the clinical effects of antidepressant by preventing the negative feedback. Using the alpha-[(11)C]methyl-L-tryptophan/positron emission tomography (PET), the goal of the present double-blind, randomized study was to compare the changes in alpha-[(11)C]methyl-L-tryptophan trapping, an index of serotonin synthesis, in patients suffering from unipolar depression treated with the SSRI citalopram (20 mg/day) plus placebo versus patients treated with citalopram plus pindol (7.5 mg/day). PET and Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS-17) were performed at baseline, and after 10 and 24 days of antidepressant treatment. Results show that the combination citalopram plus pindol, compared to citalopram alone shows a more rapid and greater increase of an index of 5-HT synthesis in prefrontal cortex (BA 9). This research is the first human PET study demonstrating that, after 24 days, the combination SSRIs plus pindolol produces a greater increase of the metabolism of serotonin in the prefrontal cortex, an area associated to depressive symptoms.",

Thermodynamic functions of solubility, solvation, and transfer processes were deduced. It was found that transfer processes for the drugs moving from water into n-octanol are determined mainly by the entropy term. Distribution coefficients of the compounds in the water/n-octanol system were derived and compared with analogous coefficients calculated from saturation solubility data in the individual solvents. The impact of mutual dissolution of water and n-octanol molecules in the water/n-octanol system on distribution coefficients is discussed.", 
    "122": "For many years, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers or betaAR antagonists) have provided significant morbidity and mortality benefits in patients who have sustained acute myocardial infarction. More recently, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists have been found to provide survival benefits in patients suffering from heart failure, although the efficacy of different beta-blockers varies widely in this condition. One drug, carvedilol, a nonsubtype-selective betaAR antagonist, has proven particularly effective in the treatment of heart failure, although the mechanism(s) responsible for this are controversial. Here, we report that among 16 clinically relevant betaAR antagonists, carvedilol displays a unique profile of in vitro signaling characteristics. We observed that in beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR)-expressing HEK-293 cells, carvedilol has inverse efficacy for stimulating G(s)-dependent adenylyl cyclase but, nonetheless, stimulates (i) phosphorylation of the receptor's cytoplasmic tail on previously documented G protein-coupled receptor kinase sites; (ii) recruitment of beta-arrestin to the beta2AR; (iii) receptor internalization; and (iv) activation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), which is maintained in the G protein-uncoupled mutant beta2AR(T68F,Y132G,Y219A) (beta2AR(TYY)) and abolished by beta-arrestin2 siRNA. Taken together, these data indicate that carvedilol is able to stabilize a receptor conformation which, although uncoupled from G(s), is nonetheless able to stimulate beta-arrestin-mediated signaling. We hypothesize that such signaling may contribute to the special efficacy of carvedilol in the treatment of heart failure and may serve as a prototype for a new generation of therapeutic beta2AR ligands.",

The use of Schiotz tonometer for estimation of intraocular pressure requires the use of topical anesthesia, poses risk of infection and injury to cornea and puts the animal under stress. Therefore, in this study noncontact tonometer was used to estimate intraocular pressure in rabbits and the technique is described for the first time. Twenty-five rabbits were subjected to intraocular pressure estimation using Schiotz as well as noncontact tonometer by two independent observers. All intraobserver and interobserver differences were within two standard deviation from the mean, indicating good repeatability and reproducibility of the two methods. A good linear correlation was observed between measurements done by Schiotz and noncontact tonometers with the correlation coefficient (r(2)) of 0.9122 and regression equation y = 1.632x + 4.8684. No significant difference was observed in percent change in intraocular pressure in timolol-treated, water-loaded rabbits using noncontact tonometer and Schiotz tonometer. Noncontact tonometer provides an easy, quick and safe method for intraocular pressure estimation, which is comparable to the conventional method of Schiotz tonometry.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of beta(1) blockade on coronary blood flow and CFR in patients with IDC. Fourteen patients with IDC and 10 control subjects underwent time-averaged peak coronary flow velocity (APCFV) measurements (centimeters per second) in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery at baseline and at maximal hyperemia before and after beta(1) blockade with intravenous esmolol. CFR was defined as APCFV at maximal hyperemia/APCFV at baseline. Although there were no significant differences in APCFV at baseline between patients with IDC and controls, patients with IDC had significantly lower APCFV at maximal hyperemia than controls (54.2 +/- 12.0 vs 75.1 +/- 18.6, p <0.05) and decreased CFR (2.39 +/- 0.38 vs 3.50 +/- 0.54, respectively, p <0.05). After beta(1) blockade, a significant decrease in APCFV at baseline (19.5 +/- 3.7 vs 22.9 +/- 5.0, p <0.05) and enhancement of APCFV at maximal hyperemia (59.5 +/- 13.3 vs 54.2 +/- 12.0, p <0.05) were observed in patients with IDC, but not in control subjects, leading to significant improvement in CFR (3.06 +/- 0.40 vs 2.39 +/- 0.38, p <0.05). In conclusion, patients with IDC had alterations in coronary blood flow and decreased CFR that improved after beta(1) blockade. These alterations in microvascular function, which are partially reversed by beta blockade, may be 1 of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the improved prognosis of patients with IDC under such therapy.", 
    "142": "Beta blockers used for the treatment of hypertension may be associated with increased risk for new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM). A search of Medline, PubMed, and EMBASE was conducted for randomized controlled trials of patients taking beta blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension with data on new-onset DM and follow-up for > or =1 year. Twelve studies evaluating 94,492 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Beta-blocker therapy resulted in a 22% increased risk for new-onset DM (relative risk 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 1.33) compared with nondiuretic antihypertensive agents.

Multivariate meta-regression analysis showed that a higher baseline body mass index (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.33, p = 0.034) was a significant predictor of new-onset DM. The risk for DM was greater with atenolol, in the elderly, and in studies in which beta blockers were less efficacious antihypertensive agents and increased exponentially with increased duration on beta blockers. For the secondary end points, beta blockers resulted in a 15% increased risk for stroke, with no benefit for the end point of death or myocardial infarction. In conclusion, beta blockers are associated with an increased risk for new-onset DM, with no benefit for the end point of death or myocardial infarction and with a 15% increased risk for stroke compared with other agents. This risk was greater in patients with higher baseline body mass indexes and higher baseline fasting glucose levels and in studies in which beta blockers were less efficacious antihypertensive agents compared with other treatments.",

Additionally, the number of neurons with alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-like immunoreactivity in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) was found to be much lower in LgA rats than in ShA and drug-naive rats. In contrast, UK14304 (alpha 2 receptor agonist) and betaxolol (beta 1 receptor antagonist) had no effect on cocaine self-administration in either group. The data suggest that activation of the alpha 1-noradrenergic system, perhaps in the BNST, is associated with increased motivation for cocaine in rats with extended access.",

Columns packed with the ground biogels were on-line coupled to a C18 HPLC column for evaluation of the entrapped protein binding properties using propranolol. Binding capacities (at saturation) were approximately 3.7 and 7.1 microg of propranolol (drug-protein molar ratios 1.4 and 2.7) for the biogels prepared at pH 5 and 7, respectively.

Carvedilol at concentrations >or=1 microM increased [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 20 microM. The Ca2+ signal was reduced partly by removing extracellular Ca2+. Carvedilol induced Mn2+ quench of fura-2 fluorescence, implicating Ca2+ influx. The Ca2+ influx was sensitive to La3+, econazole, nifedipine, and SKF96365. In Ca2+-free medium, after pretreatment with 1 muM thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump inhibitor), carvedilol-induced [Ca2+]i rises were abolished; and conversely, carvedilol pretreatment inhibited a major part of thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i rises. Inhibition of phospholipase C with 2 microM U73122 did not change carvedilol-induced [Ca2+]i rises. At concentrations between 1 and 50 microM, carvedilol killed cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The cytotoxic effect of 1 microM (but not 30 microM) carvedilol was fully reversed by prechelating cytosolic Ca2+ with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM). Apoptosis was induced by 30 (but not 1) microM carvedilol. Collectively, in HA59T hepatoma cells, carvedilol induced [Ca2+]i rises by causing Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum in a phospholipase-C-independent manner and Ca2+ influx via store-operated Ca2+ channels. Carvedilol-caused cytotoxicity was mediated by Ca2+ and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner.",

    "166": "In most individuals with hypertension, blood pressure (BP) shows a moderate to marked increase around the time of awakening, which has been linked to increases in cardiovascular complications occurring at this time of day. Many antihypertensive agents do not adequately control early morning BP, particularly when administered once daily in the morning. Points to consider in selecting an effective antihypertensive drug include pharmacokinetics and formulation of the agent and timing of administration. Agents with long pharmacologic half-lives, such as the angiotensin II receptor blocker telmisartan, the calcium antagonist amlodipine, and the beta-blocker bisoprolol, are examples of antihypertensive drugs with demonstrated efficacy in controlling early morning BP. Bedtime administration of chronotherapeutic preparations is also effective for controlling early morning BP. Given the association between early morning BP and cardiovascular risk, future clinical trials should focus on the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs during this important period of risk.", 
    "167": "The American Heart Association scientific statement on the treatment of hypertension in the prevention and management of ischemic heart disease was published recently. The main recommendations were as follows: (1) For most adults with hypertension, the blood pressure (BP) goal is <140/90 mm Hg but should be <130/80 [corrected] mm Hg in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, known coronary artery disease (CAD), CAD equivalents (carotid artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurism, and peripheral vascular disease), or 10-year Framingham risk score of >/=10%. For those with left ventricular dysfunction, the recommended BP target is <120/80 mm Hg. (2) For primary CAD prevention, any effective antihypertensive drug or combination is indicated, but preference is given to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and thiazide diuretics. (3) For the management of hypertension in patients with established CAD (stable or unstable angina, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction), beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors (or ARBs) are the basis of treatment. If further BP lowering is needed, a thiazide diuretic and/or a dihydropyridine CCB (not verapamil or diltiazem) can be added. If a beta-blocker is contraindicated or not tolerated, diltiazem or verapamil can be substituted. (4) If there is left ventricular dysfunction, recommended therapy consists of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, a beta-blocker, and either a thiazide or loop diuretic. In patients with more severe heart failure, an aldosterone antagonist and hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate (in black patients) should be considered.",

Darusentan treatment decreased mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in a dose-dependent fashion compared with placebo; the largest reductions were observed at week 10 (300-mg dose) (systolic, -11.5+/-3.1 mm Hg [P=.015;] diastolic, -6.3+/-2.0 mm Hg [P=.002]). Darusentan (300 mg) also decreased mean 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime ambulatory blood pressures from baseline to week 10. Darusentan was generally well tolerated; mild to moderate edema and headache were the most common adverse events. This study demonstrates a clinical benefit from a new class of antihypertensive agent in patients classified as resistant by the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines.",

In the present study, we evaluated the metabolism of carvedilol in beta-NF- and VD(3)-treated Caco-2 cells. The metabolism of R-carvedilol was not significant in non-treated Caco-2 cells, whereas S-carvedilol was significantly metabolized in the cells. The metabolism of R- and S-carvedilol was significantly increased by the treatment of Caco-2 cells with 50 microM beta-NF for 3 d. In contrast, the treatment of Caco-2 cells with 250 nM VD(3) for 2 weeks did not induce a significant change in the metabolism of R- and S-carvedilol. The metabolism of carvedilol in beta-NF-treated Caco-2 cells was markedly inhibited by a substrate of UGTs, baicalein. In addition, the expression of UGT1A1, 1A6, and 1A9 mRNA was increased in beta-NF-treated Caco-2 cells as compared with non-treated cells. These findings indicated that carvedilol was metabolized stereoselectively by the beta-NF-inducible enzyme in Caco-2 cells. The UGT1A subfamily in intestinal epithelial cells may be partly responsible for first-pass (presystemic) metabolism of the drug.",

    "178": "Beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors (AR) play a pivotal role in regulation of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and agonists and antagonists at both beta AR subtypes are frequently used in treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Both beta-1 and beta-2 AR genes have several polymorphisms that encode different amino acids. This review summarizes new insights into the functional importance of these polymorphisms, as well as their relationship to cardiovascular diseases and their impact on responses to adrenergic drug treatment. At present, it seems that, for cardiovascular diseases, beta-1 and beta-2 AR polymorphisms do not play a role as disease-causing genes; they might, however, be associated with disease-related phenotypes. In addition they could influence adrenergic drug responses. Thus, the Arg389Gly beta-1 AR polymorphism might predict responsiveness to beta-1 AR agonist and blocker treatment: patients homozygous for the Arg389 beta-1 AR polymorphism should be good responders, while patients homozygous for the Gly389 beta-1 AR polymorphism should be poor or nonresponders. Furthermore, the Arg16Gln27 beta-2 AR seems to have strong impact on long-term agonist-induced beta-2 AR desensitization. Thus, patients carrying this haplotype appear to suffer from rapid loss of therapeutic efficacy of chronic agonist treatment, as has been demonstrated in asthma patients. Moreover, the Arg16Gln27 beta-2 AR haplotype might have some predictive value for poor outcome of heart failure. Future large prospective studies have to replicate these findings in order to reach the final goal of pharmacogenomic research: to optimize and individualize drug therapy based on the patient's genetic determinants of drug efficacy.",

Tablets containing Na-alginate and CP in the ratio of 5:1 (F2) had the maximum percentage of in vitro drug release without disintegration in 12 hours. The swelling index was proportional to Na-alginate content and inversely proportional to CP content. The surface pH of all tablets was found to be satisfactory (7.0 +/- 1.5), close to neutral pH; hence, buccal cavity irritation should not occur with these tablets. The mechanism of drug release was found to be non-Fickian diffusion and followed zero-order kinetics. The formulation F4 was optimized based on good bioadhesive strength (28.9 +/- 0.99 g) and sustained in vitro drug permeation (68.65% +/- 3.69% for 12 hours). The behavior of formulation F4 was examined in human saliva, and both the drug and the buccal tablet were found to be stable. The formulation F4 was applied to rabbit oral mucosa for in vivo studies.
