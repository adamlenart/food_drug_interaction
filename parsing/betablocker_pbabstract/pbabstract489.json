This study identifies a possible mechanism underlying these divergent observations by building on established morphology of the ventricular wall. It is hypothesized here that the generation of fiber stress as a manifestation of myocardial contraction increases fluid pressure in the myocytes and the interstitial spaces. This increase in fluid pressure in turn generates the pressure in the ventricular cavity. Thus there are two quantities of interest: intramyocardial fluid pressure (IFP) and intramyocardial fiber stress (IFS). To test the hypothesis, we conducted experiments on conditioned dogs, utilizing a side-mounted catheter-tip strain gauge transducer to sense IMP as the sum of IFP and some component of IFS. In addition, a recessed end-tip fiber-optic transducer with its sensing element shielded from local myocardial fibers was employed to sense IFP. Both IFP and IMP were measured at various depths in the left ventricular free wall. The effects of inotropic interventions by administration of epinephrine and propranolol, mechanical interventions via clamping of the aorta and ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and neural interventions by stimulation of the ansa subclavian of the stellate ganglion and right vagus were recorded. A transmural gradient in the wall for both IMP and IFP was observed. Systolic values of IFP recorded in the endocardium match those of LVP, with peak IMP exceeding both. The results support the hypothesis and offer an interpretation of the long-standing controversy regarding the magnitude of IMP with respect to LVP.", 
    "1": "Medullipin I causes a delayed onset depressor response when injected intravenously into rats. The glyceryl compounds selachyl alcohol (SA) and monoolein (MO) cause similar vasodepression. The neutral lipid 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (HAG) was suggested by Blank et al to be medullipin I (Med I, formerly ANRL). Biologic comparisons were made between Med I and various glyceryl compounds, including SA, MO, HAG, alkyl glyceryl ethers of phosphatidyl choline (termed APRL by us), diacylated SA, and the n-butyl boronic acid derivative of SA and MO. The n-butyl boronic acid derivative of Med I also was evaluated. The delay in onset of the depressor response to Med I was reduced by the injection of Med I into the portal vein; that of SA and MO was not. Med I, SA, and MO were activated by the liver, while APRL and HAG were not. Tween 20 inhibited Med I, SA, and MO, but not APRL and HAG. Proadifen (SKF 525A) inhibited Med I, but not SA and MO. The n-butyl boronic acid derivatives of SA, MO, and Med I were inactive. Med I, like SA and MO, appeared to have two hydroxyl groups in close proximity. It was concluded that Med I is neither HAG, APRL, SA, nor MO.", 
    "2": "Aortic compliance in normotensive and hypertensive Chinese subjects undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization was compared by using a newly described method that allows for determination of the pressure dependence of compliance if one assumes a value for the exponential coefficient of the pressure-volume relation of the large arteries. Under baseline conditions in the normotensive and hypertensive groups at mean aortic pressures of 96.3 and 128.6 mm Hg, aortic compliance averaged 1.47 and 0.80 ml/mm Hg, respectively. Compliance in the hypertensive group at a diastolic pressure of 99.4 mm Hg (which was nearly equal to the mean normotensive pressure) was 1.072 ml/mm Hg--still significantly lower than in the normotensive group. During nitroprusside infusion, however, the compliances in the hypertensive group increased to levels equal to or greater those in the normotensive group. Thus, these data confirm that aortic compliance is lower in hypertensive than in normotensive humans. They further demonstrate that the lower compliance cannot be attributed entirely to the elevated blood pressure, suggesting that excess smooth muscle tone may be partly responsible.", 
    "3": "We examined genetically determined oxidation polymorphisms of metoprolol and mephenytoin in 200 unrelated, healthy Japanese subjects and in 98 mainland Chinese subjects simultaneously. This examination was done according to the respective reported phenotyping criteria by use of the urinary metabolic ratio of metoprolol and of the percentage of excretion of 4-hydroxymephenytoin 8 hours after dose administration. The frequencies of occurrence of poor metabolizers (PMs) in the Japanese versus the Chinese subjects were 0.5% versus 0% for metoprolol and 22.5% versus 17.4% for mephenytoin, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in these frequencies between the two Oriental populations. However, Chinese extensive metabolizers (EMs) showed a significantly lower excretion of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (p less than 0.01) and 4-hydroxymephenytoin (p less than 0.001) than that of Japanese EMs, and the mode of the distribution histogram of the Chinese EMs for the two test probes was skewed compared with that of the Japanese EMs. The findings indicate that the two Far Eastern Oriental subject groups have a lower frequency of PM phenotype of debrisoquin/sparteine-type oxidation and a greater incidence of PM phenotype of mephenytoin oxidation compared with the respective frequencies reported from white subjects. However, the explanation for the observation that the metabolic capacities of the test drugs differed between the EMs of the two populations who had a similar ethnic origin and who resided in the same geographic area remains obscure.", 
    "4": "The clinical course of a 29-month-old girl who was referred for evaluation after ingesting ninety 0.2-mg tablets of levothyroxine is reported. Despite an initial thyroxine (T4) level of 282 micrograms/dl and a triiodothyronine (T3) level of 1,837 ng/dl at 48 hours postingestion, her symptoms were mild and included irritability, vomiting, tremor, and tachycardia. Treatment was limited to activated charcoal and propranolol. Thyroid hormone levels fell to normal by 13 days postingestion. The child's clinical course was benign. Even after massive acute ingestions of levothyroxine, children's symptoms are usually mild and may be controlled with propranolol. This conservative approach should be considered before expensive and potentially dangerous therapies are undertaken.", 
    "5": "To determine the effect of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) on exercise performance during beta blockade, 12 hypertensive men were studied. The subjects underwent graded treadmill testing while taking pindolol (a beta blocker with ISA), propranolol (a beta blocker without ISA) and placebo, in a double-blind, crossover fashion. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen consumption (VO2), cardiac output and stroke volume were determined at 25, 45, 60 and 75% of each subject's VO2 max. Heart rate was significantly lower with pindolol compared with placebo at all stages of exercise, but significantly higher compared with propranolol at all stages of exercise except at 75% of VO2 max and at VO2 max (no significant differences between the 2 beta blockers were recorded at these stages). Mean arterial pressure was statistically equivalent with pindolol and propranolol at all stages of exercise and significantly lower while beta-blocked compared with placebo conditions at 45, 60 and 75% of VO2 max. Cardiac output and VO2 were statistically equivalent across all 3 treatments at all submaximal levels of exercise. It was concluded that, although heart rate was significantly higher with pindolol compared with propranolol at the 3 lower rates of work, cardiac output and VO2 were not different between the drugs, thus making little impact on exercise performance.", 
    "6": "Previous investigation, predominantly in the short-term canine model, has documented a potent antifibrillatory effect of beta-adrenergic blockade. To determine whether the protection afforded by beta blockade is species- and model-specific, we studied 23 chloralose-anesthetized cats. Eight animals were studied over a short term and underwent serial determinations of the ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold prior to and 1 minute after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and immediately following reperfusion of a 10-minute occlusion. Beta-blocking doses of intravenous propranolol (P) (0.5 mg/kg) attenuated the fall in VF threshold during acute ischemia. Increasing the dose of P to 1 mg/kg did not provide further protection, nor did P protect against reperfusion VF. The other 15 animals underwent a preliminary surgical procedure during which the LAD was completely and irreversibly occluded (nine animals) or in which a sham procedure was performed (six animals). Two weeks later, we measured ventricular refractoriness at several left ventricular sites, ventricular inducibility using programmed electrical stimulation, and VF thresholds both before and after administration of intravenous P (1 mg/kg). Ventricular refractory periods in the infarcted zones were significantly increased compared with normal sites and with values obtained in sham-operated animals. In addition, VF thresholds in the infarcted animals were lower than those obtained in the sham-operated group. Before treatment, a reproducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia was induced by means of programmed stimulation in seven of the nine chronically infarcted animals but in none of the sham-operated animals (p less the 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Isolated rat pineal glands were incubated in vitro in a medium containing [14C]dopamine or [14C]tyrosine, and the tissue contents of 14C-labelled and total dopamine and noradrenaline were determined by HPLC followed by electrochemical detection and scintillation spectrometry. During incubation with [14C]dopamine, the labelled amine accumulated in pineal glands and was partially converted into [14C]noradrenaline. Nomifensine, a neuronal amine uptake blocker, largely inhibited the accumulation of [14C]dopamine and the formation of [14C]noradrenaline. These experiments demonstrated dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity in the sympathetic nerves of the pineal gland. During incubation with [14C]tyrosine, formation of [14C]dopamine and [14C]noradrenaline was observed in the pineal tissue, indicating that noradrenaline can also be synthesized from dopamine, endogenously formed in the gland. Electrical stimulation of the stalk region of the pineal gland during incubation with [14C]dopamine enhanced the accumulation of [14C]dopamine and synthesis of [14C]noradrenaline. Electrical stimulation also enhanced the formation of [14C]dopamine during incubation with [14C]tyrosine. Compared to that at midday, the tissue content of endogenous noradrenaline at midnight was enhanced by 50% and that of dopamine by 450%. The in vitro accumulation of [14C]dopamine, as well as the synthesis of [14C]dopamine and [14C]noradrenaline, was also increased at midnight. In conclusion, sympathetic nerves in the rat pineal gland contain tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase, the two enzymes required for the synthesis of noradrenaline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "There is still debate about whether the ciliary muscle is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. We investigated the amplitude and the dynamics of accommodation under influence of the non-selective beta-blocker timolol. For this purpose the variations in thickness of the human lens during step-like changes in accommodation were measured with high-resolution A-scan echography. Results showed that the dynamics of accommodation, expressed in the time constants of the response, were affected as well as the amplitude.", 
    "9": "Discrepancies between clinic and ambulatory BP measurements may be important in the assessment of antihypertensive drug efficacy. Trimazosin (50-200 mg twice daily) and propranolol (40-160 mg twice daily) were compared in 22 hypertensive subjects in a randomised double-blind cross-over study. Daytime ambulatory BP was measured with a non-invasive portable recorder (Remler M2000). Clinic BP measurements were made with a random zero sphygmomanometer. While both drugs reduced clinic supine BP (trimazosin by 16/10 mmHg, P less than 0.01/P less than 0.001; propranolol by 25/14 mmHg, P less than 0.001/P less than 0.001), equivalent decreases on ambulatory measurement occurred with propranolol (28/11 mm/Hg, P less than 0.001/P less than 0.001) but not trimazosin (8/3 mmHg, P less than 0.05/NS). This difference in drug efficacy persisted throughout the 12-hour dosing interval. We conclude that clinic BP measurements alone cannot be relied upon to reflect accurately changes in BP induced by antihypertensive drugs. Moreover this study confirms the necessity for ambulatory BP measurement in the evaluation of antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "10": "The effects of bunazosin and propranolol administration on hypertension and serum levels of lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins were studied in a controlled, randomized multicenter study. After a 4-week washout period, 48 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomly assigned to either the bunazosin or the propranolol group. Twenty-four were treated with bunazosin (1 to 3 mg t.i.d.) and 24 with propranolol (10 to 40 mg t.i.d.) for 12 weeks. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly in both groups. After 12 weeks of bunazosin treatment, significantly lowered apolipoprotein (apo) B and apo B/apo A-I ratio (p less than 0.05, in both cases) were observed, in contrast to no changes in the propranolol group. Although the changes were not significant, bunazosin tended to decrease the ratio of total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol. There were no significant changes in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apo A-I, apo A-II, apo C-II, apo C-III and apo E for either bunazosin or propranolol. The difference between the two drugs was significant for the apo B/apo A-I ratio (p less than 0.05). Bunazosin monotherapy was shown to be as effective in reducing blood pressure as propranolol. In addition, its favorable effects on lipoprotein metabolism seem to offer an additional advantage in mitigating coronary risk.", 
    "11": "We present a general review of the literature concerning the role of the 31 P spectroscopy in studying the metabolic effects of drugs like verapamil, chlorpromazin, propranolol, acebutolol, 2-mercaptopropionylglycine, insulin, 2-deoxyglucose, cardioplegic solutions, as well as perfluorocarbon solutions on the energy status of the ischemic myocardium. Using 31 P spectroscopy several important results have been found concerning the changes of the concentration of the high energy phosphates and of the intracellular pH during myocardial ischemia. It is now possible to gain interesting insights into the metabolic effects of different drugs. By using these drugs, changes in the high energy phosphates, as PCr and ATP were attenuated during the myocardial ischemia. A better recovery of the PCr and ATP contents during reperfusion was noted. The myocardial pH changes during ischemia are attenuated compared to controls. A good correlation between the preservation of the high energy phosphates and myocardial pH and the recovery of the ventricular function was described. An in vivo documentation of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is now possible. A short overview is presented about the phosphorylation potential and its prognostic value for various cardiac diseases. The 31 P spectroscopy successfully shifted the research interest towards biochemical processes at the cellular level in the diagnosis and therapy monitoring. It extends our knowledge on the pathophysiology of the myocardium.", 
    "12": "Sotalol was compared with amiodarone in this open randomized multicentre study of patients with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation not associated with acute myocardial infarction refractory to or intolerant of Class I drugs. 16 of 30 patients treated with amiodarone completed 12 months on therapy, five were withdrawn because of recurrent ventricular tachycardia and nine because of presumed adverse drug reactions, compliance problems or protocol violation. Four of those who were withdrawn died within 12 months. Sixteen of 29 patients completed 12 months on sotalol, one was withdrawn because of ventricular tachycardia and nine because of presumed adverse drug reactions, poor compliance or the need for coronary artery surgery. Three died on treatment and two after withdrawal but within 12 months of entering the study. When the results are analysed by intention to treat there was no significant difference in antiarrhythmic efficacy or in the incidence of side-effects severe enough to warrant withdrawal from the trial. There was an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction in those treated with sotalol, which, because of its pharmacokinetics, is an attractive alternative to amiodarone for patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias who can tolerate beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "13": "Twenty-four drug-free patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of panic disorders (and their age- and sex-matched normal controls) slept in the laboratory for 3 consecutive nights. Panic patients showed a slightly longer sleep latency and a lower sleep efficiency than their normal controls. They also had more overall movement time and more body movements during stage 2 sleep. Eight panic attacks were recorded arising out of sleep. Six of them occurred in the transition phase between stage 2 and stage 3 sleep. The nocturnal panic attacks of these patients are unique, different from stage 4 sleep terrors, and different from dream anxiety attacks.", 
    "14": "Efficacy of drug therapy in reduction of enzymatically estimated infarction size, was often assessed by enzymatic prediction method. But the drawback of this method is that, this can assess neither the utility of early administration of drug therapy nor the clinical effects of the drug. Predicted infarction size (PIS) does not include reinfarctions. Therefore, in such studies cases of reinfarctions are either to be excluded or PIS should be compared with modified infarction size (MIS). Moreover, a large number of patients (not a few ones) should be included in trial for correct assessment of the utility of therapy.", 
    "15": "The unit impulse response theory has been adapted to characterize the transport profile of drugs into the central nervous system (CNS). From the obtained input function, the cumulative plasma volume (V) cleared by transport into the CNS in time can be calculated. Simulation studies demonstrated that transport governed by passive diffusion resulted in a linear relationship between V and time, while the slope of the line, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) clearance, proved to be an adequate and model independent parameter to characterize drug transport into the CNS. The error in the result of the numerical procedure could be limited to less than 10% of the theoretically predicted value. Superposition of 5 or 10% random noise on simulated data did not result in significant differences between the calculated and theoretically predicted clearance values. Simulations of carrier-mediated transport resulted in nonlinear transport curves; the degree of nonlinearity, and thus the detectability, was dependent on the initial degree of saturation of the system, the rate of desaturation, as caused by drug elimination processes and the noise level on the data. In vivo experiments in the rat were performed, using atenolol, acetaminophen, and antipyrine as model drugs. Linear transport relationships were obtained for all drugs, indicating that transport was dependent on passive diffusion or a low affinity carrier system. BBB-clearance values were 7 +/- 1 microliters/min for atenolol, 63 +/- 7 microliters/min for acetaminophen and 316 +/- 25 microliters/min for antipyrine. These experiments validate the applicability of the presented technique in in vivo studies.", 
    "16": "The effect on exercise performance and on the subjective perception of fatigue of the opioid receptor blocker naloxone, the nonselective beta-blocker timolol, and the combination of these two was studied in a double-blind randomized cycle ergometry test in healthy young men. Cumulative work at exhaustion was reduced by 25% after timolol (P less than 0.002) and by 34% after naloxone/timolol (P less than 0.02) but not after naloxone, compared with placebo. Naloxone alone had no influence on the subjective perception of fatigue (Borg scale rating), but significantly higher ratings were obtained by timolol and by naloxone/timolol. The present study does not support the hypothesis that opioid peptides are of importance for maximal exercise capacity and subjective perception of fatigue during short-term dynamic exercise in healthy young men.", 
    "17": "In 13 patients, affected by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and essential hypertension, antihypertensive-efficacy and effects of a new calcium-channel blocker (gallopamil) associated with a diuretic agent (chlorthalidone) on left ventricular systolic and diastolic performance assessed by phonocardiographic methods. The results were compared to those obtained, in the same group of patients, with a selective beta-blocker (atenolol) associated with the same diuretic agent (chlorthalidone). With both therapeutic regimens a statistically significant reduction of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure was observed; both agents were able to reduce hemodynamic gradient in systole which characterize HOCM; however, the treatment with gallopamil plus chlorthalidone determined greater effects on left ventricular diastolic function as compared to the treatment with atenolol plus chlorthalidone; both treatments determined bradycardia.", 
    "18": "The effect of intracoronary and intravenous propranolol on coronary vasomotion was evaluated in 30 patients with coronary artery disease. Luminal area of a normal and a stenotic coronary segment was determined at rest, during supine bicycle exercise and 5 min after 1.6 mg sublingual nitroglycerin administered at the end of the exercise test using biplane quantitative coronary arteriography. Patients were divided into 3 groups: Group I (n = 12) served as control Group II consisted of 10 patients with intracoronary administration of 1 mg propranolol and Group III of 8 patients with intravenous administration of 0.1 mg/kg propranolol prior to the exercise test. In the control Group there was coronary vasodilation (+23%, p less than 0.01) of the normal and coronary vasoconstriction (-29%, p less than 0.001) of the stenotic vessel segment during bicycle exercise. After sublingual administration of 1.6 mg nitroglycerin there was vasodilation of both normal (+40%, p less than 0.001 vs rest) and stenotic (+12%, NS vs rest) segments. In Group II intracoronary propranolol was not accompanied by a change in coronary area but both normal (+13%, p less than 0.05) and stenotic (+22%, p less than 0.05) segments showed coronary vasodilation during bicycle exercise. After sublingual nitroglycerin there was further vasodilation of both normal (+31%, p less than 0.001 vs rest) and stenotic (+45%, p less than 0.01 vs rest) arteries. In Group III intravenous administration of propranolol was associated with a decrease in coronary luminal area of both normal (-24%, p less than 0.001) and stenotic (-41%, p less than 0.001) segments. During dynamic exercise there was coronary vasodilation of both segments when compared to the data after intravenous injection of propranolol but there was no change in luminal area (normal vessel-2%, NS vs rest; stenotic vessel-3%, NS vs rest) when compared to the resting data. After sublingual administration of 1.6 mg nitroglycerin both normal (+21%, p less than 0.001) and stenotic (+46%, p less than 0.001) segments showed coronary vasodilation. It is concluded that supine bicycle exercise in patients with coronary artery disease is associated with vasodilation of the normal and vasoconstriction of the stenotic coronary arteries. Intravenous administration of propranolol is followed by coronary vasoconstriction of both normal and stenotic coronary arteries probably due to secondary mechanisms (reduction in heart rate and contractility) because it is not observed after intracoronary injection of propranolol and it is overridden by bicycle exercise and sublingual nitroglycerin.", 
    "19": "Life-time microscopy showed possible direct effects of obsidan on lymph vessels and flow in the experiment. With local application of the drug there was a short-term constriction, higher frequencies and lower amplitudes of lymphangionic pulsation; during its intramuscular injection, sustained dilator effects, two-phase shifts in the frequency and limitation of pulse amplitude were seen. With the two routes of obsidan administration heterogenous, unpersistent changes in the linear velocity of lymph flow were observed.", 
    "20": "Hypertension after carotid endarterectomy has a variable incidence ranging up to 56%. Blood pressure (BP) control is essential due to possible increased risk of morbidity from neurologic deficits or cardiovascular complications. This study evaluated intravenous labetalol for control of hypertension after carotid endarterectomy. Sixty ASA II-IV patients were studied; 20 developed BP high enough for treatment with labetalol. The anesthetic technique was standardized. Labetalol was administered at the conclusion of surgery as a 20-mg bolus over two minutes followed by 40 mg every 10 minutes until the desired BP was achieved (BP less than or equal to 10% above average preoperative BP or less than 150 mmHg, systolic) or 300 mg had been given. The mean total dose of labetalol was 42.0 +/- 33.0 mg (mean +/- SD) and mean time to reach the desired BP was 16.2 +/- 21.4 minutes. Systolic, diastolic, mean arterial pressure and heart rate significantly decreased after labetalol treatment and remained so for the remainder of the 180-minute study period. There was no hypotension, bradycardia, evidence of myocardial ischemia or central nervous system dysfunction present with labetalol treatment. Blood samples were obtained for determination of plasma renin activity, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in 10 patients who developed hypertension and received labetalol, and 10 patients who did not develop hypertension. In the patients developing hypertension, there was a significant elevation in epinephrine just before treatment, that decreased by 30 minutes after treatment. Norepinephrine levels became significantly elevated five minutes after labetalol treatment in the group with hypertension and remained elevated for 120 minutes. Concomitantly, there was a significantly lower plasma renin activity seen in this group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "The hemodynamic actions of the new dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker amlodipine were assessed and compared with those of nitrendipine using anesthetised dogs and were also investigated in conscious dogs with and without beta-adrenergic blockade. After bolus intravenous administration, amlodipine (25 to 1600 micrograms/kg) or nitrendipine (1 to 128 micrograms/kg) was administered to anesthetised dogs at 30-minute intervals, caused dose-related reductions in systemic and coronary vascular resistances with corresponding increases in cardiac output and coronary flow. Nitrendipine, unlike amlodipine, caused marked acute hypotension. The onset of action of amlodipine was markedly slower than that of nitrendipine, and effects were maintained for 30 minutes--recovery from nitrendipine was largely complete at 30 minutes. In conscious dogs, amlodipine (250, 500, 1000 micrograms/kg IV) caused dose-related reductions in systemic vascular resistance that approached maximum within 5 minutes and persisted for over 4 hours. Reflex increases in heart rate, cardiac output, and cardiac contractility were attenuated by prior treatment with propranolol, resulting in earlier and greater falls in blood pressure, but no marked adverse effects on cardiac contraction or conduction. In the absence of propranolol, maximum falls in blood pressure occurred 3 to 4 hours after the dose, possibly as a result of the changed baroceptor sensitivity induced by amlodipine. These results show amlodipine to have the basic hemodynamic profile of other dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, but in addition it demonstrates a slower onset and longer duration of action; the reasons behind these pharmacodynamic properties are discussed.", 
    "22": "The interim results of a multicentered clinical trial with the combination therapy therapy Pilogel/topical beta-blocker (twice daily) in patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension are discussed. Six patients were treated with Pilogel and a topical beta-blocker for one month. Four out of six patients responded well to the combination therapy. Most patients experienced some difficulty in applying the gel and their eyelids stuck together on awakening. In two patients a superficial punctate keratitis was observed. We found an average decrease in intra-ocular pressure (IOP) of 22.5% 22.5 hours after Pilogel administration, but there was some tendency towards higher evening values compared to morning values. In view of the appearance of a corneal haze as described by Johnson et al. during long-term treatment, longer follow-up is necessary.",

The concentrations of partial agonist that cause stimulant effects greatly exceed those that cause blockade. Alberto Kaumann suggests that such non-conventional partial agonists, often analogues of pindolol, may act through a third heart beta-adrenoceptor, which resembles the beta 3-adrenoceptor of white adipocytes and smooth muscle of airways and ileum.", 
    "24": "Rehabilitative treatment with the beta-blocker anaprilin was performed in 58 patients with coronary heart disease within early periods (on days 7 to 21) after aortocoronary bypass surgery. Group 1 patients were given oral anaprilin. Group 2 patients took the drug by sinusoidal modulated current electrophoresis. With the latter drug administration, its negative chronotropic effect and abolished adverse decrease in myocardial contractivity were detected in the patients from that group. Bearing in mind the results of pharmacokinetic studies, it was suggested that the therapeutic effect of small blood anaprilin concentrations was due to the electrophoresis-induced passage of only its therapeutically beneficial left isomer and L-propranolol glucuronide, a metabolite.", 
    "25": "Plasma membrane vesicles (PMVs) of Trypanosoma cruzi adhered to L6 myoblast host cells as a function of time and concentration in saturation phenomena in a similar fashion to that reported in a previous publication. The initial adhesion rate (A0) of T. cruzi PMVs to L6 myoblasts in tissue culture was inhibited by acetylcholine (10(-5) M), isoproterenol (10(-5) M) and norepinephrine (10(-8) M) (range 29.1-50.3% of control). Atropine, the antagonist of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (10(-5) M), and propranolol or pindolol, the antagonists of beta-adrenergic receptors (10(-5) M), were also equal inhibitors of the T. cruzi PMV to L6 myoblast adhesion rate (range 26.1 to 55.5% of control). The alpha-adrenergic receptor ligands yohimbine and phentolamine (10(-5) M) showed no A0 inhibitory activity in similar assays. The interaction of T. cruzi PMVs with type I host muscle sarcolemma receptors was clearly defined in assays which used porcine heart atrial membranes (PAMs) immobilized on cationic polyacrylamide beads. In this parasite membrane-host cell membrane assay system, 10(-10) M atropine and 5 x 10(-9) M propranolol produced a shift of an S-shaped T. cruzi PMV to PAM saturation isotherm to the right, suggesting that a negative cooperative interaction was produced between the intramembrane ligand binding site and another, surface heterotropic T. cruzi PMV adhesion site. Atropine and propranolol were equieffective inhibitors of the T. cruzi striated muscle sarcolemma recognition process, raising the possibility that T. cruzi attachment molecules annexed pairs of muscarinic cholinergic and beta-adrenergic receptors to effect adhesion of the two membrane surfaces.",

Widespread pruritic, urticarial papules developed at times of stress and exercise, each papule being surrounded by a striking blanched vasoconstricted halo. The halo hives could be replicated with an intradermal injection of adrenaline. This is the first report of adrenergic urticaria from Thailand.", 
    "27": "We studied interactions among the noradrenergic (NA) and the muscarinic cholinergic (ACh) systems in the regulation of ocular dominance plasticity in kitten visual cortex. The cortex was bilaterally infused with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) for a week. Upon termination of the 6-OHDA infusion, one hemisphere was infused with a muscarinic ACh agonist, bethanechol, through the same, chronically implanted cannula for the second week together with monocular lid suture. The other hemisphere received an infusion of the vehicle solution alone. (1) Only in the hemisphere infused with bethanechol at relatively high concentrations did we obtain a clear shift in ocular dominance. We also found that the effect of bethanechol was concentration-dependent. (2) By comparing necessary concentrations of bethanechol and NA for the respective maximal effects, we noted that the former was at least 100-fold less effective than the latter in restoring the plasticity. (3) The cortical infusion of bethanechol did not restore the plasticity to the propranolol-pretreated cortex; the ocular dominance distribution remained virtually unchanged. This result was interpreted as suggesting that functioning beta-adrenoreceptors are needed for the cortical effect of activating the muscarinic ACh receptors to become detectable. (4) The expected shift in ocular dominance following monocular deprivation was partially suppressed, when highly concentrated scopolamine, a muscarinic ACh antagonist, was used, indicating that the involvement of the ACh system in this matter was indirect. The concentration of scopolamine needed for the half-maximum effect was 172-fold higher than that of propranolol. We thus conclude that the involvement of the muscarinic ACh system in ocular dominance plasticity is secondary to that of the NA-beta-adrenoreceptor system.",

Propranolol hydrochloride, spiked with 4-(3) H labelled compound, was administered i.v. or orally to male Wistar rats and blood concentrations of parent material determined by liquid scintillation counting after extraction into toluene. An i.v. dose-linearity study indicated dose-independent pharmacokinetics for propranolol at 1-2 mg kg-1, with a mean Cls, Vss, MRTi.v. and t0.5 beta of 0.076 L min-1 kg-1, 4.74 L kg-1, 57.81 min and 47.10 min, respectively. At 5 mg kg-1, there was evidence of non-linearity with MRTi.v. increased by about 250%, Vss by 170% and t0.5 beta by 230% compared with the lower doses. After oral administration of propranolol (10 mg kg-1) in aqueous solution, with or without Tween 80 (6%), the mean absorption time (MAT) and terminal half-life were approximately 55 min and 86 min, respectively. The MAT for propranolol administered in a 50% octanoic and lauric acid (1:1 by weight) oil-in-water emulsion, stabilized with 6% Tween 80 (129-90 min), was significantly longer compared with that for a 50% Miglyol 812 oil-in-water emulsion containing the same surfactant (16.55 min). The terminal half-life of propranolol administered in the fatty acid formulation (128.96 min), unlike that for the Miglyol emulsion (54-37 min), was significantly longer compared with that observed after i.v. administration (t0.5 beta = 47 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The effects of several metabolic inhibitors (50 microM) on the initial uptake rate of propranolol (0.5 to 500 micrograms mL-1) by the minced lungs (0.4 g) isolated from 7-week-old rats has been investigated in oxygenated, pH 7.4 Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer solution (20 mL) containing 3% BSA at 37 degrees C for 5 min. The effect of the incubation temperature was also examined. Metabolism of propranolol was almost insignificant (i.e. less than 1.3% of the initial load). The overall initial uptake rate was considered to be a combination of apparent linear transport and saturable processes. For the control uptake rate, the linear transport rate constant was 1.26 +/- 0.16 g-1 mL-1 min-1, while Vmax and Km' of the capacity limited uptake process were estimated as 0.727 +/- 0.074 mg g-1 min-1 and 24.8 +/- 2.71 micrograms mL-1, respectively. No metabolic inhibitor tested had an effect on the linear transport rate of propranolol but 2,4-dinitrophenol and potassium cyanide inhibited saturable uptake rate (i.e. Vmax) of propranolol significantly (P less than 0.01) while ouabain, phloridine and iodoacetic acid did not do so significantly. Reduction of the incubation temperature to 15 degrees C decreased and at 25 degrees C tended to decrease, both linear transport and saturable uptake rates.", 
    "30": "The role of the vagus nerve and adrenoceptor stimulation in acid secretion after pylorus-ligation in the rat has been examined. All drugs were administered intraperitoneally. Atropine (5 mg kg-1) depressed the H+ output (111 mumols +/- 33.8 vs 412.5 mumols +/- 62.2, mean +/- s.e.m., n = 10, P less than 0.001); cimetidine (40 mg kg-1) did not enhance this action, while vagotomy was more effective than atropine (32.7 mumols +/- 4.9, mean +/- s.e.m., n = 10, P less than 0.05). Atropine (10 mg kg-1) produced a similar depression to the 5 mg kg-1 dose. Cimetidine (100 mg kg-1) depressed the H+ output (248.5 mumols +/- 46.8, mean +/- s.e.m., n = 10, P less than 0.05). Propranolol (5-20 mg kg-1) had no significant effect on the H+ output but dose-dependent inhibition was produced by phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine; an inhibition similar to that achieved by vagotomy was seen with the 20 mg kg-1 dose. Both these drugs (5 or 10 mg kg-1) had no significant effect on the H+ output when given with atropine (5 mg kg-1) but the H+ output was significantly lower than that produced by either drug at the same dose given alone. Atropine (5 mg kg-1) with phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine (20 mg kg-1) produced H+ output not significantly different from that with vagotomy or either alpha-adrenoceptor given alone at 20 mg kg-1, but the result was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than the H+ output with atropine (5 mg kg-1) alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "Intramuscular injection of xylazine induced dose-dependent vomiting in cats (ED50 = 0.277 mg/kg); administration of standard dose of xylazine (2 mg/kg, 2 times the 100% emetic dose) induced vomiting in 100% of the cats studied. The xylazine-induced vomiting was antagonized by adrenoceptor antagonists possessing alpha 2-blocking activity, which were yohimbine, tolazoline, and phentolamine. Of these antagonists, yohimbine was the most effective; the maximal antagonistic effect was seen at 1 mg of yohimbine/kg, a dose at which the other drugs had little or no effect. At the doses studied, prazosin and phenoxybenzamine, adrenoceptor antagonists with alpha 1-blocking activity, did not prevent vomiting induced by xylazine. Beta-Adrenoceptor (propranolol), dopamine receptor (domperidone and chlorpromazine), a cholinoceptor (atropine), an opiate receptor (naloxone), and a histamine-receptor (diphenhydramine) antagonists, at the doses studied, did not prevent xylazine-induced vomiting. Pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine failed to prevent xylazine-induced vomiting. These results indicated that xylazine-induced vomiting in cats is mediated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors and suggested that the alpha 2-adrenoceptors mediating the vomiting attributable to xylazine may not be presynaptic alpha 2-receptors located on noradrenergic nerve terminals.", 
    "32": "The possible involvement of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in sympathetic control of renal blood flow was investigated in the pig in vivo. Exogenous NPY caused renal vasoconstriction with a threshold effect at an arterial plasma concentration of 164 pmol 6(-1). Stimulation of the renal nerves (0.59, 2 and 10 Hz) in control animals evoked rapid and frequency-dependent reduction in renal blood flow and overflow of NPY-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) and noradrenaline (NA) from the kidney, suggesting co-release from sympathetic nerves. Following the administration of the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists phenoxybenzamine and propranolol, the vasoconstrictor response to exogenous NA was reduced by 98%, whereas that of NPY was unaltered. The response to nerve stimulation with 0.59 Hz was abolished, whereas relatively slowly developing reductions in renal blood flow by 7 and 28% were obtained upon stimulation with 2 and 10 Hz respectively. The nerve stimulation-evoked overflow of NA at 0.59 and 2 Hz, but not at 10 Hz and not that of NPY-LI, was enhanced after adrenoceptor blockade. Twenty-four hours after reserpine treatment (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) the contents of NPY-LI and NA in the renal cortex were reduced by 80 and 98% respectively. Sectioning of the renal nerves largely prevented the reserpine-induced depletion of NPY-LI, but not that of NA. Nerve stimulation of the denervated kidney with 2 and 10 Hz 24 h after reserpine treatment evoked slowly developing and long-lasting reductions in renal blood flow by 6 and 52% respectively. These responses were associated with overflow of NPY-LI, which was similar to and threefold higher than that observed in controls at 2 and 10 Hz respectively, while no detectable overflow of NA occurred. Repeated stimulation with 10 Hz resulted in a progressive fatigue of the vasoconstrictor response and the associated overflow of NPY-LI, giving a high correlation (r = 0.86, P less than 0.001) between the two parameters. It is concluded that NPY is a potent constrictor of the renal vascular bed. Furthermore, although NA is the likely transmitter mediating most of the responses to low to moderate nerve activation under control conditions, the data suggest that NPY may mediate the non-adrenergic reductions in renal blood flow evoked by high-frequency sympathetic nerve stimulation after reserpine treatment.", 
    "33": "It has been reported that catecholamine release is associated with stressful events and that adrenaline administration induces hyperfibrinolysis. To examine the possible involvement of the adrenoreceptor mechanism in the regulation of fibrinolytic activity at rest and to maximum exercise, 12 healthy volunteers (six males and six females, age range 19-21 yr) were orally medicated with two formulations of a beta blocker. The drug treatments consisted of 1) a single dose of OM756 alpha 10 mg propranolol \"Inderal\" tablet, 2) a single dose of a generic 10 mg propranolol tablet, and 3) a single dose of generic placebo. The drug administrations were assigned to the subjects using a complete Latin square design and double-blind procedure and were separated by 7 d. Two hours after the administration of the respective drug treatment, subjects exercised to maximal capacity using a graded exercise protocol on a bicycle ergometer. Prior to and 2 h after the drug administration and immediately after maximum exercise, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen consumption were measured and venous blood was removed and analyzed for fibrinolytic activity using a standard fibrin plate method. ANOVA showed that the resting and maximum heart rates were significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) following oral premedication with either of the two formulations of beta blocker, while blood pressure and oxygen consumption were unaffected. ANOVA also showed no difference in the resting fibrinolytic activity 2 h post-administration of the drug treatments but a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in the normal fibrinolytic response to maximum exercise. It was concluded, therefore, that the resting level of fibrinolytic activity is not mediated via an adrenergic pathway but that the enhanced fibrinolytic activity to maximum exercise is partially regulated via an adrenoreceptor mechanism.", 
    "34": "A new technique is described for the characterization and quantification of beta-adrenergic receptors in biologically viable slices of myocardium from the hamster right ventricle using the hydrophilic radioligand, [3H]CGP-12177 (CGP). Binding was stereospecific, saturable, of high affinity, reversible, displaceable by appropriate drugs, and highly positively correlated with increasing tissue concentrations. Bmax for CGP binding to myocardial slices from 50-day-old male Golden Syrian hamsters was 3.28 +/- 0.15 fmol/mg wet weight, while Kd was 0.21 +/- 0.02 nM. Freezing resulted in a close to 50% loss of receptor number with no apparent change in affinity. The slice preparation may be utilized to detect in vivo changes in myocardial cell surface receptors, as evidenced by the fact that the number of receptors in slices from ischemic guinea pigs was increased (Bmax = 15.5 +/- 1.25 fmol/mg wet wt) compared with sham-operated controls (Bmax = 10.4 +/- 0.38 fmol/mg wet wt). The minimal tissue disruption associated with this procedure, as well as its speed, simplicity, and relatively low cost, suggest that the myocardial slice preparation provides an important methodology for the study of beta-adrenergic receptor binding in the semiintact myocardium.", 
    "35": "Pharmacologic intervention is critical to the management of myocardial ischemia. Four classes of drugs are now used in therapeutic regimens for ischemia. beta-Adrenergic blockers decrease ischemia by blocking beta 1-mediated inotropic and chronotropic effects, thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen consumption. Calcium channel blockers alter fast- and slow-response action potentials by decreasing transmembrane calcium flux, resulting in decreased conduction velocity and heart rate and prolonged effective refractory period. These effects positively influence ischemia and atrial dysrhythmias. Additionally, these agents decrease excitation-contraction coupling in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in coronary and peripheral vasodilation. Organic nitrates and nitrites decrease vascular smooth muscle contraction and preload, and afterload, precipitating a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption and ischemia. They also improve blood flow to areas of compromised flow. Thrombolytic agents are administered in acute situations to dissolve the occluding thrombus, but they must be used within a few hours of the injury. These drugs activate the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which breaks down the clot into fibrin degradation products. The choice of agents is determined by the etiology of the patient's ischemia, his or her response to the drug, and the presence of concomitant disease processes.", 
    "36": "Recent studies have shown that the beta-blockers can be effective treatments for neuroleptic-induced akathisia. However, the relative contributions of beta-1 versus beta-2 blockade to the therapeutic effect of beta-blockers remains unclear. We treated nine patients who had neuroleptic-induced akathisia with low doses (25-100 mg/day) of the beta-blocker metoprolol. At these doses metoprolol causes selective blockade of beta-1 receptors. Seven patients improved after metoprolol; no further substantial changes were seen after subsequent treatment with propranolol. This finding suggests that neuroleptic-induced akathisia can be improved by selective beta-1 blockade.",

    "38": "1. The force of the electrically driven rat right ventricle strip is increased by isoprenaline but not by procaterol, a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist. The effects of some beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists on the responses of the strip to isoprenaline have been determined. 2. Metoprolol (a beta 1-adrenoreceptor-selective antagonist) at 3 x 10(-8)-3 x 10(-7) moll-1 and ICI 118,551 (a potent beta 2-adrenoreceptor-selective antagonist) at 10(-7)-10(-6) moll-1 had no effect on maximum responses to isoprenaline and caused parallel rightward shifts of the isoprenaline response curves. The pA2 values for metoprolol and ICI 118,551 were 7.86 and 7.40, respectively. Thus the isoprenaline responses of the rat right ventricle strip are due to stimulation of beta 1-adrenoreceptors. 3. Metoprolol at 10(-6) moll-1 acted as a dual antagonist of the responses of the ventricle strip to isoprenaline causing parallel rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves which was due to beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonism and a depression of the maximum response to isoprenaline which was probably due to membrane stabilizing activity. 4. Low concentrations of (+/-)-pindolol (10(-8) moll-1), (+)-pindolol (10(-7) moll-1), (-)-pindolol (10(-8) moll-1) and mepindolol (10(-10) moll-1) had no effect on isoprenaline maximum responses and caused parallel rightward shifts of isoprenaline response curves. Both (+/-)- and (-)-pindolol at 10(-7) moll-1, mepindolol at 10(-9)-10(-7) moll-1 and bopindolol at 10(-9)-10(-7) moll-1 reduced the isoprenaline maximum responses and caused non-parallel rightward shifts of the isoprenaline response curves. 5. BAAM (an irreversible beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist) treatment (3 x 10(-6) moll-1) for 30 min followed by 60 min washout reduced the isoprenaline maximum responses and caused a non-parallel rightward shift of the isoprenaline response curve. The kA (dissociation constant) for isoprenaline was 1.10 x 10(-6) moll-1. Calculation of receptor occupancy demonstrated that in order to produce a maximal response of the rat right ventricle strip, isoprenaline had to occupy 73% of the beta 1-adrenoreceptors. 6. The use of the rat right ventricle strip, a tissue with a small beta 1-adrenoreceptor reserve for isoprenaline, allows a definitive characterization of reversible (e.g. metoprolol) and irreversible (e.g. BAAM) beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists. It is suggested that (+/-)- and (-)-pindolol, mepindolol and bopindolol may be slowly dissociating beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists.", 
    "39": "Radionuclide determination of left ventricular ejection fraction was performed at hospital discharge and one month later in 60 patients who had suffered acute myocardial infarction. At the first determination, the patients were randomized into two groups. In the first group, the cardiologist who cared for the patients was provided with the result of the determination of the ejection fraction whereas, in the second group, the result was withheld. At a 'blinded' evaluation two months after hospital discharge, 7 of those patients (24%) from the group where the cardiologist knew the ejection fraction and 11 of the patients (38%) in whom this result was withheld complained of angina pectoris on exertion (ns). The medication of the patients did not differ in the two groups. No significant difference was found in the values of the ejection fraction in patients with and without angina pectoris. In this controlled study, we were not able to document a clinical effect by routinely determinating left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with acute myocardial infarction in the treatment of angina pectoris.", 
    "40": "Esmolol infusion at rates of 200, 300, and 400 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 was used to potentiate hypotension (mean arterial pressure = 60 mm Hg) induced with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in 10 male patients undergoing radical cancer surgery during nitrous oxide-oxygen and fentanyl anesthesia. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (radial arterial catheter), and plasma levels of renin activity (PRA), norepinephrine (N), epinephrine (E), and dopamine (D) were measured: 1) while patients were awake; 2) after induction of anesthesia (nitrous oxide, 60% in oxygen, fentanyl = 5 micrograms/kg followed by an infusion at 10 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1); 3) after surgery had begun; 4) after 20 minutes of SNP-induced hypotension; 5) after 20 minutes of esmolol at each of the above infusion rates; and 6) after the completion of surgery. Compared to awake values, SNP-induced hypotension (mean infusion rate = 3.1 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 +/- 0.6 SE) during surgery resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) increases in heart rate, PRA, N, and D. Infusion of esmolol resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) dose-dependent reductions in SNP requirement to maintain MAP = 60 mm Hg.

    "41": "Cell surface [3H]CGP 12177 binding sites in 10-wk streptozocin-diabetic rats decreased by 41% (P less than 0.01) compared with that in the control rats. In contrast, there was no difference in the total cell receptor concentration between the control and the diabetic rats, which was measured by hydrophobic antagonist [125I]-iodocyanopindolol binding. Forty-eight-hour in vivo insulin treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) increased cell surface beta-adrenergic receptor concentration by 37% above that in diabetic rats without any change in total receptor concentration in the cells. However in vitro treatment of 8 nM insulin, 33 mM glucose, or 10 mM 3-hydroxybutyrate for 2 h showed no effect on [3H]CGP 12177 binding. In contrast, 10 microM isoproterenol-dependent decrease and the recovery of cell surface receptors after the removal of the agonist were significantly (P less than 0.01) impaired in diabetic rats compared with those of control rats. These results indicate that only cell surface beta-adrenergic receptors decrease in diabetic rats, which may be associated with abnormalities in the receptor distribution. The decrease in cell surface receptor number closely associates with the diabetic state and is reversed by the short-term insulin treatment.", 
    "42": "The role of elevated plasma epinephrine concentrations in the regulation of plasma leucine kinetics and the contribution of beta-receptors were assessed in man. Epinephrine (50 ng/kg per min) was infused either alone or combined with propranolol (beta-blockade) into groups of six subjects fasted overnight; leucine flux, oxidation, and net plasma leucine forearm balance were determined during 180 min. Constant plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations were maintained in all studies by infusing somatostatin combined with insulin and glucagon replacements. Plasma leucine concentrations decreased from baseline during epinephrine infusion by 27 +/- 5 mumol/liter (P less than 0.02) due to a 22 +/- 6% decrease in leucine flux (P less than 0.05 vs. controls receiving saline) and to an increase in the metabolic clearance rate of leucine (P less than 0.02). Leucine oxidation decreased by 36 +/- 8% (P less than 0.01 vs. controls). beta-Blockade abolished the effect of epinephrine on leucine flux and oxidation. Net forearm release of leucine increased during epinephrine (P less than 0.01), suggesting increased muscle proteolysis; the fall of total body leucine flux was therefore due to diminished proteolysis in nonmuscle tissues, such as splanchnic organs. Nonoxidative leucine disappearance as a parameter of protein synthesis was not significantly influenced by epinephrine. Plasma glucose and FFA concentrations increased via beta-adrenergic mechanisms (P less than 0.001). The results suggest that elevation of plasma epinephrine concentrations similar to those observed in severe stress results in redistribution of body proteins and exerts a whole body protein-sparing effect; this may counteract catabolic effects of other hormones during severe stress.",

    "44": "The activity of cationic amphiphilic compounds to affect artificial phospholipid-membranes was compared with the membrane-stabilizing cardiodepressant potency of the drugs. The twenty-one investigated catamphiphilic compounds belonged to various pharmacological groups including antiarrhythmic, local anaesthetic, beta-blocking, antimalarial, and psychoactive drugs. The perturbing action of the drugs on phospholipid-membranes was evaluated by determining the drug-effect on the temperature of the phase-transition from the gel to the liquid crystalline state in liposomes of dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid by means of differential scanning calorimetry. The ability to interact with the polar headgroups of phospholipid-membranes was measured by recording the effects of the cationic compounds on the binding of 45Ca2+ to monomolecular layers of phosphatidylserine. The cardiodepressant action was observed in Langendorff-preparations of guinea-pig hearts. The drug-effect on excitability was indicated by the elevation of the threshold-intensity of 50 Hz alternating current to induce ventricular arrhythmia. For the sake of comparison, the negative chronotropic and inotropic effects were evaluated. There was only a moderate correlation found between the activities of the drugs to reduce the transition temperature and to inhibit 45Ca2+ -binding (r = 0.69). This result probably reflects that both methods look upon different consequences of the drug-phospholipid interaction. The membrane-stabilizing, anti-excitatory potency corresponded favourably with the ability of the drugs to affect the phospholipids. Almost 80% of the variance between the anti-excitatory potencies could be accounted for by the drug-phospholipid interactions. The negative chronotropic and inotropic effects accompanying the anti-excitatory actions were similar for most of the drugs. The results of the study are compatible with the hypothesis that the interaction with phospholipid-membranes is a major determinant of the membrane-stabilizing cardiodepressant potency of cationic amphiphilic drugs.", 
    "45": "The incidence and duration of intraoperative silent myocardial ischemia have been shown to be significantly correlated with the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction in patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery. To assess the effectiveness of intraoperative beta blockade in limiting such silent myocardial ischemia, a group of 48 patients was treated with oral metoprolol immediately prior to peripheral vascular surgery. The total duration of intraoperative silent myocardial ischemia, the percentage of intraoperative time silent myocardial ischemia was present, the number of intraoperative episodes of silent myocardial ischemia, and the intraoperative heart rate in the treated patients were compared with those in 152 similar but untreated peripheral vascular surgery patients. The patients treated with oral metoprolol had significantly less intraoperative silent ischemia with respect to relative duration and frequency of episodes, a significantly lower intraoperative heart rate, and less intraoperative silent myocardial ischemia in terms of total absolute duration. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic activation may play a major role in the pathogenesis of silent myocardial ischemia during peripheral vascular surgery.", 
    "46": "Circadian variation of the onset of acute myocardial infarction has been noted in many studies and may carry important pathophysiologic implications. However, only a few previous studies have attempted subgroup analyses. In 4,796 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction, the time of symptom onset was recorded. As in other studies, the peak of onset occurred in the morning from 6:01 AM to 12:00 noon, and 28% of the population (1.16 times the average percentage for the other time periods) experienced symptom onset in that period (p less than 0.001). There was a second, lower peak (25%) in the evening between 6:01 PM and 12:00 midnight, which was also observed in some previous studies. We sought to determine whether or not the presence of subgroups with specific clinical characteristics would exhibit different patterns and thereby contribute to these peaks in the overall population. In patients with a history of congestive heart failure (n = 606) or with non-Q wave infarction (n = 832), a pronounced peak (29%) occurred only in the evening. Two nearly equal peaks were observed in patients older than 70 years of age (n = 1,422), smokers (n = 2,057), diabetics (n = 767), women (n = 1,213), and patients taking beta-blocking drugs (n = 847).

    "47": "To assess the efficacy and predictability of solitary beta-adrenergic blocker (BB) therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT), 30 patients (16 men and 14 women) with a mean age of 55 years, who initially had sustained ventricular tachycardia (70%) or ventricular fibrillation (30%), were studied. Results of baseline arrhythmia tests showed VT on ECG monitoring in 57% of the patients, during exercise in 50%, induced by programmed stimulation in 69%, increasing to 86% during isoproterenol. BB therapy prevented inducible VT during programmed stimulation in 37% of the patients, prevented VT on ECG monitoring in 54%, and prevented VT during exercise in 83%. Long-term BB therapy was given to 24 of 30 patients, whereas six other patients with hemodynamically unstable VT during BB therapy received other long-term treatment. During a mean follow-up of 824 days, 6 of 24 patients had recurrent VT. BB therapy was discontinued in two patients because of side effects. Long-term success was predicted by left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 45%, absence of coronary disease, and age less than 60 years (all p less than 0.02). Neither suppression of arrhythmia during exercise testing, nor results of programmed stimulation or ECG monitoring were predictive of outcome. Thus beta-adrenergic blockers can be effective as solitary antiarrhythmic therapy in selected patients with VT.", 
    "48": "The 3 to 5-year clinical outcomes of 627 consecutive patients selected for treatment with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) at Emory University Hospital for one- or two-vessel coronary artery disease with involvement of the left anterior descending coronary artery, between July 1981 and June 1983, and 865 patients in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study with similar coronary artery disease involvement selected for medical therapy between 1975 and 1979 were compared. Cox analyses and stratified life table analyses were used to adjust for differences in 13 variables including concurrent medical therapy. Complete follow-up was obtained in 97% of PTCA patients and 99% of medically treated patients. After correction for baseline differences in significantly predictive variables, there was no difference between the relative risk of death after PTCA vs medical therapy (RR = 0.7; p = 0.36). However, results of analysis of prospectively defined subsets showed a potential survival benefit after PTCA for patients with an ejection fraction less than 50% (RR = 0.2; p = 0.02) and also for patients with two-vessel disease (RR = 0.2; p = 0.04). For the groups as a whole there was no difference in risk of infarction after PTCA and medical therapy (RR = 0.8; p = 0.58). However, for patients with 90% to 99% LAD stenosis there was a trend toward lessened risk of infarction after PTCA (RR = 0.6; p = 0.15). No patient subset had a higher risk of death or infarction with PTCA (p less than or equal to 0.15). The likelihood of later surgery was increased after PTCA (RR = 1.5; p = 0.002). Angina, employment, and activity levels were improved after PTCA. Thus PTCA compared to medical therapy was associated with improved functional status and may decrease the risk of death and infarction in certain patient subsets. However, bypass surgery was more often performed in patients initially treated with PTCA. These data should be interpreted in light of their nonrandomized study origin and generation from different clinical sites.",

    "51": "U-46619, a stable epoxymethano analog of thromboxane A2 elicited a direct positive inotropic effect on guinea pig left atrium paced at a constant rate (EC50 = 2.5 nM). This novel observation contrasts with previous reports of a decrease in myocardial contractility by thromboxane mimetic compounds in coronary-perfused preparations, an action recognized as secondary to vasoconstriction. The positive inotropic effect of U-46619 was competitively antagonized by the specific thromboxane receptor blocker L-655,240 (pA2 = 8.02; identical to that reported in smooth muscle), but was unaffected by blockers of alpha 1-, beta 1-, and H1-receptors and by cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors. Increased tissue levels of inositol phosphates, but not cAMP, were associated with the positive inotropic action of U-46619, in analogy to the actions of alpha 1- and H1-receptor agonists. However, the inotropic effect of U-46619 and the concomitant increase in phosphoinositide breakdown were both selectively antagonized by L-655,240. Thus, U-46619 acts on specific thromboxane receptors in guinea pig left atrium and elicits a positive inotropic effect that probably results from an increase in phosphoinositide metabolism.", 
    "52": "It is uncertain how changes in the beta-adrenoceptor population influence the contractility of developing heart. To resolve this we have examined postnatal developmental changes in the adrenergic responsiveness of the rabbit heart. The inotropic effect of isoproterenol on isolated left ventricular papillary muscles from rabbits aged 3, 21, and 90 days was compared with the relative number of beta-adrenoceptors at each age measured using [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) as the specific ligand. The maximum tension developed in response to isoproterenol increases from 37 +/- 7 to 175 +/- 33% above control twitch tension between 3 and 21 days of age; this is followed by a decrease to 68 +/- 12% in the young adult. During this period of development, there is a decline in EC50 towards increased sensitivity. These differences are partially accounted for by an increase in the numbers of specific [3H]DHA binding sites from 17.3 +/- 2.3 to 56.6 +/- 9.9 fmol/mg wet tissue weight from 3 to 21 days, and a subsequent decrease to 32 +/- 4.5 fmol/mg tissue in the young adult. The proportionally larger increase in contractility compared with the number of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites during the first 3 weeks of life is discussed in terms of the developmental changes in the efficacy of coupling between receptor occupancy and contraction.", 
    "53": "The p-trifluoromethylanilide congener of isoprenaline, tert-butyl N-[(S)[( 4-[(R)-6-[2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-2- hydroxyethyl]amino]heptanamido]phenyl]methyl][(N-methylcarbamoy l) methyl]carbamoyl]methyl]carbamate (1S,4R)-4,7,7-trimethyl-3-oxo-2- oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-1-carboxylate (1:1) (Ro 17-2218) was investigated for its effects in various pharmacological tests in vitro and compared to the parent compound. As Ro 17-2218 represented a mixture of four diastereomers, the pure isomers were synthesized. They had a purity of 97-98%. By pharmacological testing of the diastereomers the highest potency was found in the 6R,2'R-isomer Ro 17-8648, while the potency of the 6S,2'S-isomer, Ro 17-9651 was lower by three orders of magnitude. The amorphous hydrochloride Ro 17-8648/001 had 1/10 the potency of the respective crystalline camphanate Ro 17-8648/003. (R)-6-[(R)-[2-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]-N-[4- (trifluoromethyl) phenyl]heptan amide (Ro 17-8648/003) was found to have potent beta-agonist properties with clear beta 1-selectivity in radioligand binding studies. It exerted an extremely tight binding to membrane receptors. As a full beta-agonist it elicited positive inotropic effects in isolated cardiac tissues, with a potency 10-360 times that of isoprenaline and an extremely long duration of action. Electrophysiological studies in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscles confirmed the beta 1-receptor-mediated effects of the compound.", 
    "54": "In order to reveal endogenous beta-adrenomimetic in the blood the authors proposed the biological testing of the serum and plasma on the isolated myometrium of the rat. For this purpose obsidan was used as a beta-adrenoblocker. It was shown that endogenous beta-adrenomimetic different from adrenaline was present in the blood of males, nonpregnant and pregnant females and parturients. Besides, its concentration increased in pregnancy and remained high early in labor.", 
    "55": "Bete-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol and norepinephrine enhanced phagocytosis in Paramecium. Stimulation was stereospecific, dose-dependent and inhibited by the beta-agonists propranolol and alprenolol. Phorbol ester and forskolin potentiated the stimulatory effect of catecholamines on Paramecium phagocytosis. The dansyl analogue of propranolol (DAPN) was used for fluorescent visualization of the beta-adrenergic receptor sites in Paramecium which have been found to be localized at the cell membrane and within the membrane of the nascent digestive vacuoles. The appearance of the characteristic fluorescent pattern has been blocked by 1-propranolol.", 
    "56": "The secretion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and its adaptation to pharmacologic and hemodynamic interventions were investigated in 36 patients with sinus rhythm. To provoke standardized secretion of ANF all patients underwent two periods of rapid right ventricular pacing for 4 min with a 15 min interval. Immediately after the first pacing eight patients received 5 mg verapamil, 10 patients 5 mg atenolol and 10 patients 4 mg molsidomine intravenously. Eight patients remained untreated and served as controls. The amounts of atrial pressure increments due to pacing were identical (70% over basal pressure) in all patients. After molsidomine, but not after the other drugs, basal right atrial pressure was lowered. In controls the secretion of ANF due to the second stimulation was significantly (2.5-fold) larger than the secretion induced by the first stimulation. In patients receiving verapamil the secretion response after the second pacing was blunted. Atenolol did not affect the release of ANF. After molsidomine the upward regulation of the ANF secretion rate - seen in controls - was abolished. Thus, the myoendocrine cells are capable for a fast upward regulation of their ANF secretion rate after repeated stimuli. Verapamil directly blocks stimulated ANF secretion, whereas beta-blockade shows no effect. Molsidomine seems to impair enhanced ANF release by lowering basal atrial pressure.", 
    "57": "It has been shown that the addition of a beta-adrenergic catecholamine to a trout red blood cell suspension induces a 60-100-fold increase of sodium permeability resulting from the activation of a cAMP-dependent Na+/H+ antiport. Subsequent addition of propranolol almost instantaneously reduces the intracellular cAMP concentration, and thus the Na permeability, to their basal values (Mah\u00e9 et al., 1985). If glutaraldehyde (0.06-0.1%) is added when the Na+/H+ exchanger is activated after hormonal stimulation, addition of propranolol no longer inhibits Na permeability: once activated and fixed by glutaraldehyde, the cAMP dependence disappears. Glutaraldehyde alone causes a rapid decrease in the cellular cAMP concentration. In its fixed state the antiporter is fully amiloride sensitive. The switching on of the Na+/H+ exchange by cAMP is rapidly (2 min) followed by acute but progressive desensitization of the exchanger (Garcia-Romeu et al., 1988). The desensitization depends on the concentration of external sodium, being maximal at a normal Na concentration (145 mM) and nonexistent at a low Na concentration (20 mM). If glutaraldehyde is added after activation in nondesensitizing conditions (20 mM Na), transfer to a Na-rich medium induces only a very slight desensitization: thus the fixative can \"freeze\" the exchanger in the nondesensitizing conformation. NO3- inhibits the activity of the cAMP-dependent Na+/H+ antiporter of the trout red blood cell (Borgese et al., 1986). If glutaraldehyde is added when the cells are activated by cAMP in a chloride-containing medium, the activity of the exchanger is no longer inhibited when Cl- is replaced by NO3-. Conversely, after fixation in NO3- medium replacement of NO3- by Cl- has very little stimulatory effect. This indicates that the anion dependence is not a specific requirement for the exchange process but that the anion environment is critical for the switching on of the Na+/H+ exchanger and for the maintenance of its activated configuration.", 
    "58": "In order to study the regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor number and function in response to prolonged physical effort, lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptor density (determined by (-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding), lymphocytic basal and isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) production and concentrations of plasma catecholamines were measured before and during 3 h running exercise in eight healthy volunteers. A significant (P less than 0.01) increase of the lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptor density from 45 +/- 4 to 81 +/- 9 fmol mg-1 protein (mean +/- SEM) took place during the first hour of exercise. As the exercise was continued for up to 2.1-3 h, the receptor densities did not change significantly any more and remained elevated (72 +/- 9 fmol mg-1 protein) in comparison to the resting levels (P less than 0.02). The isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production of the lymphocytes increased during the first hour of running from 190 +/- 36 to 269 +/- 56 pmol mg-1 protein (P less than 0.01) and returned to the resting level at the end of the exercise (182 +/- 38 pmol mg-1 protein). The mean levels of plasma catecholamines increased approximately sixfold during the first hour of exercise and remained elevated until the end of the running. This study demonstrates that the beta-adrenergic receptor system is activated in lymphocytes during prolonged aerobic physical exercise. This activated state becomes, however, attenuated within 2-3 h of exercise as indicated by a diminishing ability of beta-adrenoceptors to mediate catecholamine-induced cAMP production.", 
    "59": "Isolated ventricular myocytes from adult (16 to 20 weeks) spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive (WKY) rats were utilized to examine adrenergic and cholinergic receptor expression and interaction. Binding assays were performed using quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) for cholinergic and beta-adrenergic receptors, respectively. In addition, cAMP was measured as an index of adrenergic-cholinergic control of adenylate cyclase. Data from radioligand binding experiments indicated that muscarinic cholinergic receptors were depressed (22%) in SHR myocytes, while beta-adrenergic receptor density was comparable to that of WKY myocytes. Heterologous receptor modulation in isolated myocytes as assessed by displacement analysis with and without guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP), showed that carbachol displacement of QNB was shifted five fold to the right in the presence of GTP and that the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol did not prevent the GTP-mediated binding alteration. In contrast, carbachol modulated the GTP-shift of ICYP displacement by isoproterenol and these effects were comparable in both WKY and SHR myocytes. Furthermore, the ability of carbachol to blunt the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol was also comparable in myocytes isolated from adult SHR and control animals. Thus, the observed decrement in muscarinic cholinergic receptor expression did not alter adrenergic-cholinergic interactions as assessed by displacement assays using guanine nucleotides, or the control of cAMP levels. In addition, isolated myocytes provide a useful system for analyzing receptor expression and regulation and how these parameters may be altered in the hypertensive heart.", 
    "60": "In this report, we analyze the expression of the type II receptor for the Fc region of IgG (Fc gamma RII) in resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine B lymphocytes. Fc gamma RII is encoded by two genes, alpha and beta. The beta gene encodes two mRNA, beta 1 and beta 2, which are generated by alternative splicing. Using an S1 nuclease protection assay, we found that resting and activated B lymphocytes express predominantly the beta 1 transcript. Very low levels of the beta 2 mRNA were detected in this assay, while no expression of the alpha transcript could be detected. Quantitative Northern blot analysis showed that the amount of Fc gamma RII beta mRNA was increased 9-fold in LPS-activated B lymphocytes. The expression of Fc gamma RII during the various phases of B cell activation was then studied by immunofluorescence using the monoclonal antibody 2.4G2. LPS stimulation induced an increase of the Fc gamma RII cellular pool as well as of its expression at the surface of B lymphocytes. The rise in Fc gamma RII surface expression occurred after the induction of class II antigens (Ia) and before transferrin receptor induction. Fc gamma RII expression was found to be enhanced during the G1 phase of the cell cycle since (a) only large cells (i.e. those that had entered the G1 phase) expressed an increased amount of Fc gamma RII and (b) blocking the entry of activated cells into the S phase (with the ion channel blocker quinine) did not affect the Fc gamma RII induction by LPS. Furthermore, only B cell activators that induced cells to enter into G1 [LPS and F(ab')2 anti-IgM antibodies, but not interleukin 4] caused an increase in the expression of Fc gamma RII. These results show that the increase in the membrane expression of Fc gamma RII occurs during the early G1 phase, establishing it as a marker for the entry of B lymphocytes into the cell cycle.", 
    "61": "Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) synthesized in the anterior (AL) and intermediate lobe (IL) of the rat pituitary gland, is a prohormone precursor of several peptide hormones that may participate in the regulation of blood pressure. We therefore studied the biosynthesis of POMC by measuring the incorporation of 3H-tyrosine into the IL of 32-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) of the Aoki-Okamoto strain and their normotensive controls, the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY). Under basal conditions, POMC biosynthesis was significantly reduced in the SHR (1130 +/- 102 cpm/30 min/IL, n = 13) when compared to the WKY (1515 +/- 163 cpm/30 min/IL, N = 12, P less than 0.05, t test). There was also an inverse correlation between systolic blood pressure and POMC biosynthesis in both the WKY (Y = 8.4 +/- 1.38X + 2097 +/- 673, r = 0.86 +/- 0.06, N = 5), and SHR (Y = 5.7 +/- 1.8X + 1122 +/- 336 r = 0.57 +/- 0.13, N = 3). The decreased POMC biosynthesis was associated with a higher dopamine content in IL in SHR compared to WKY (1.56 +/- 0.53, n = 17 v 0.51 +/- 0.16, n = 17 pmol/IL, P less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Oral administration of three different antihypertensive agents (propranolol, captopril, or hydralazine) for 12 weeks normalized blood pressure and POMC biosynthesis in the SHR but had no effect on either variable in the WKY. Because POMC biosynthesis in IL increased with normalization of blood pressure in the SHR, the decreased POMC biosynthesis in SHR may be a consequence rather than a cause of the elevated blood pressure in SHR.", 
    "62": "A mouse beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) DNA clone was transfected and expressed in a mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line (Kin8) that lacks both beta 2AR and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The receptor displayed a characteristic beta 2AR agonist binding profile that was similar to that observed in beta 2AR-transfected PKA+ mouse adrenocortical tumor cells (Y1). Isoproterenol treatment of beta 2AR-transfected Kin8 and Y1 cells resulted in a rapid loss of surface beta 2AR, as determined by the binding of the hydrophilic beta 2AR radioligand [3H]CGP 12177 [( 3H]CGP), followed by a decrease in adenylate cyclase activity. Sequestration of beta 2AR in Kin8 cells was beta 2AR agonist specific, temperature dependent, and rapidly reversible. Repeated treatment and recovery from isoproterenol incubation resulted in a cycling of surface [3H]CGP binding. The reappearance of [3H]CGP binding following short isoproterenol treatment was not affected by cycloheximide treatment of the cells. Prolonged incubation of beta 2AR-transfected Kin8 cells with isoproterenol resulted in the down-regulation of beta 2AR protein without a change in beta 2AR mRNA levels. Polysome profiles of control and down-regulated cells revealed that translation of beta 2AR mRNA is inefficient and does not change upon prolonged agonist treatment. Protein synthesis was required to reverse the down-regulation of beta 2AR. These results indicate that neither sequestration nor down-regulation of beta 2AR depends on PKA.", 
    "63": "It has been proposed that the change in sensitivity of the uterus to catecholamines during the oestrous cycle may result from changes in beta-adrenoceptor density in the myometrium. In the present work we applied the technique of light-microscopic autoradiography using the radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol to study the density and distribution of beta-adrenoceptors in the rat uterus during the normal oestrous cycle, following ovariectomy, and after ovariectomy with oestradiol replacement. We found that beta-adrenoceptor density in the endometrium, but not the myometrium, varied during the oestrous cycle, being highest during pro-oestrous. The endometrium of the ovariectomized rats was devoid of any beta-adrenoceptors, whilst that of the oestradiol-treated rats was very intensely labelled. Following ovariectomy there was an increase in beta-adrenoceptor density in the myometrium, but this was not observed in the animals given oestradiol replacement. It appears that both the presence and density of beta-adrenoceptors in rat endometrium is dependent on circulating oestrogens.", 
    "64": "Adrenergic activity regulates renal function by several mechanisms. Renal nerves not only exert vasoconstrictor functions but also may influence glomerular hemodynamics by beta-adrenergic activity, especially via the effects on renin angiotensin activity. Little is known of the specific glomerular hemodynamic alterations resulting from beta 1-adrenergic blockade. Current studies examined the effects of 4-6 days of treatment with atenolol (50 mg/kg), a beta 1-selective adrenergic antagonist, on glomerular hemodynamics in plasma volume-expanded Munich-Wistar rats. Atenolol treatment reduced blood pressure both in the awake state and during micropuncture. This reduction in blood pressure contributed to a decrease in nephron filtration rate (48 +/- 1 in untreated rats vs. 40 +/- 1 nl.min-1.g kidney wt-1 in the atenolol-treated group, P less than 0.05) by reduction in nephron plasma flow (182 +/- 2 vs. 154 +/- 4 nl.min-1.g kidney wt-1 in the atenolol-treated rats). No other determinant of glomerular ultrafiltration was influenced by atenolol treatment. Since beta 1-adrenergic blockade may influence the generation of angiotensin II, the response to angiotensin II infusion was assessed and found not to differ from control untreated animals. These studies demonstrate that beta 1-receptor blockade reduced nephron filtration rate by decreasing mean arterial blood pressure and nephron plasma flow without significant modifications in vascular resistance and the glomerular hydrostatic pressure gradient.", 
    "65": "Although active transport of potassium into human platelets has been demonstrated previously, there is hitherto no evidence that human platelets have an ouabain-inhibitable Na-K ATPase in their membrane. The present study demonstrates active rubidium (used as an index of potassium influx), 86Rb(K), influx into platelets, inhibitable by ouabain, and also demonstrates the presence of specific [3H]ouabain binding by the human platelet. This 86Rb(K) influx was stimulated by adrenaline, isoprenaline, and salbutamol, but noradrenaline caused a mild inhibition. Active 86Rb(K) influx by platelets was inhibited markedly by timolol, mildly by atenolol, but not by phentolamine. Therefore, active 86Rb(K) influx in human platelets is enhanced by stimulation of beta adrenoceptors of the beta 2 subtype. The platelet may therefore replace the leukocyte in future studies of Na-K ATPase activity. This would be a considerable advantage in view of the ease and rapidity of preparation of platelets.", 
    "66": "The antinociceptive action of U-50,488H [( trans-(+/-)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)- cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide]), a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist, was antagonized by serotonergic (5-HT) but not by noradrenergic receptor antagonists. U-50,488H (i.c.v.) was antagonized by more than 2-fold by i.c.v. administered pindolol, methysergide, mianserin, ketanserin or pirenperone. A similar degree of antagonism of U-50,488H (i.c.v.) was found after intrathecal (i.t.) treatments with pindolol or methysergide but not with mianserin, ketanserin or pirenperone. When U-50,488H was given i.t., its antinociceptive action was antagonized by pindolol or methysergide administered i.t. but potentiated by mianserin, ketanserin or pirenperone administered i.t. Tolerance to the antinociceptive action of U-50,488H was induced in mice using slow release preparations of U-50,488H. A smaller degree of cross-tolerance to the antinociceptive action of 5-HT also developed. 5-HT receptor antagonists (pindolol or ketanserin) were coadministered with U-50,488H to test for their effect on the development of tolerance to U-50,488H. A greater degree of tolerance was observed after ketanserin administration whereas the development of tolerance was partially blocked by the coadministration of pindolol. Changes in the properties of the kappa-opioid, 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor binding sites in the cortical, striatal and spinal tissues of control and U-50,488H-tolerant mice were investigated. There were no significant changes in the maximum binding values of [3H]ethylketazocine, [3H]-5-HT or [3H]ketanserin. The Kd values of all ligands increased approximately 2-fold in most of the regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "Most antibodies known to interact with beta-adrenergic receptors do not exhibit subtype selectivity, nor do they provide quantitative immunoprecipitation. A monoclonal antibody, G27.1 raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor of hamster, is selective for the beta 2 subtype. G27.1 provides nearly quantitative immunoprecipitation of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor from hamster lung that has been photoaffinity-labeled and solubilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Immunoprecipitation is completely blocked by nanomolar concentrations of the immunizing peptide. This antibody interacts with beta 2-adrenergic receptors from three rodent species, but not with those from humans. When C6 glioma cells, which contain both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors, are photoaffinity-labeled in the absence or presence of subtype-selective antagonists, subtype-selective photoaffinity-labeling results. G27.1 can immunoprecipitate beta 2-, but not beta 1-, adrenergic receptors from these cells. Similar results were obtained following subtype-selective photoaffinity-labeling of membranes from rat cerebellum and cerebral cortex. The beta-adrenergic receptors from C6 glioma cells and rat cerebral cortex exist as a mixture of two molecular weight species. These species differ in glycosylation, as shown by endoglycosidase F digestion of crude and immunoprecipitated receptors.", 
    "68": "We tested the hypothesis that sympathetic nerves influence cardiocyte organelle volumes and capillarity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with long-standing hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. SHR and their normotensive, Wistar Kyoto (WKY), controls were treated with 6-hydroxydopamine from birth to prevent the establishment of the sympathetic nervous system. To determine whether beta adrenergic receptors were the major pathway of sympathetic influence, another group of SHR and WKY were chronically treated from weaning with the beta 1 adrenergic antagonist, metoprolol. In SHR sympathectomy failed to alter, while metoprolol attenuated, hypertension. Stereological analyses of perfuse-fixed hearts showed that in both SHR and WKY mitochondria/myofibrils volume ratio was increased by long-term sympathectomy, mainly by limiting mitochondrial volume density, even though this intervention failed to alter left ventricular mass. In contrast, long-term beta 1 blockade attenuated hypertrophy in SHR but had no effect on mitochondria/myofibrils volume ratio. Capillary numerical density was increased significantly in sympathectomized SHR and WKY. However, despite this increase, capillary volume density was similar in control and sympathectomized rats, since capillary diameter was less in the latter. Metoprolol-treated SHR showed a trend toward higher capillary numerical densities consistent with their attenuation of hypertrophy. These findings indicate that sympathetic nerves, either directly or indirectly, inhibit cardiocyte mitochondrial growth and capillary proliferation during both normal and pressure-overload induced cardiac enlargement.", 
    "69": "To examine whether an acute pituitary-adrenal response to stress may occur in vivo in the absence of hypothalamic-pituitary connections, we measured plasma beta-endorphin (beta-EP) and corticosterone (C) in rats after acute thermal injury. beta-EP rose significantly after thermal injury in normal rats and rats bearing pituitary-to-kidney autotransplants but not in animals with pituitary aspiration without reimplantation. Corticosterone responses paralleled beta-EP but were significant only in normal controls. Propranolol pretreatment did not reduce postburn beta-EP and C rises in autotransplanted animals. Therefore, since circulating factors contribute in vivo to pituitary-adrenal responses, the widespread practice of using \"stress hormone\" responses to quantitate perioperative stress or pain may in some circumstances be flawed.", 
    "70": "In attempt to elucidate whether the beta-adrenoceptor is involved in the control of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion, plasma immunoreactive ANP level was measured at rest, in recumbent and upright positions, and during graded maximal ergocycle exercise in nine healthy male subjects (23 +/- 0.5 years of age) treated for 3 days with nonselective beta-blockers propranolol (150 mg/day) or pindolol (15 mg/day) or with placebo. The effects of beta-blockers, which differ by their hemodynamic actions at rest because of the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of pindolol, were compared. Maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) during beta-blockade was not significantly different from the placebo value. Resting heart rate was not affected by pindolol treatment but was decreased with propranolol (-10 beats/min). Both beta-blockers caused a reduction in heart rate at all the exercise intensities. Mean blood pressure was not affected by beta-blockade at rest but was significantly reduced during exercise. During placebo treatment, plasma ANP increased in response to exercise intensities greater than 65% of VO2max. At 100% VO2max plasma ANP was nearly doubled (101.5 +/- 14 pg/ml) compared with the basal value in upright position (56.6 +/- 15 pg/ml). beta-Blockade caused a marked elevation in plasma ANP at all the levels of activity. Despite different hemodynamic responses to pindolol and propranolol, both beta-blockers produced similar increases in the basal level of plasma ANP. These rises were maintained in the course of exercise tests, and no significant difference was found between propranolol and pindolol. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor mechanisms are not directly responsible for tonic and exercise-induced ANP secretion in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Two commonly used drug combinations were studied as premedications before surgical 3rd molar removal under local anaesthesia. The study was randomized, crossover and double-blind in 12 patients. Our routine premedication for lengthy operations, consisting of diazepam 10 mg p.o. plus i.m. scopolamine 0.006 mg/kg and morphine 0.2 mg/kg, was compared with a combination of diazepam 10 mg p.o. plus metoprolol 50 mg p.o. The latter combination was expected to cause fewer central nervous system side effects and be more suitable for out-patient surgery. Drug levels in blood, physiological and biochemical indicators of operation-related stress, CNS side effects, and the patients' subjective preferences were monitored. Both combinations were equally accepted by the patients, but the diazepam/scopolamine/morphine combination caused clearly more side effects after discharge than diazepam/metoprolol. The operation-related haemodynamic changes and plasma catecholamine responses were similar after both premedications.", 
    "72": "Catecholamine-induced lipolysis was investigated in nonobese females and males. Isolated subcutaneous adipocytes were obtained from the abdominal and gluteal regions. The lipolytic effect of noradrenaline was four to fivefold more marked in abdominal adipocytes than in gluteal fat cells. This regional difference was more apparent in females than in males. No site differences were observed when lipolysis was stimulated with agents acting at different postreceptor levels. The beta-adrenergic lipolytic sensitivity was 10-20 times greater in abdominal adipocytes from both sexes than in gluteal adipocytes. Abdominal adipocytes from females showed a 40 times lower alpha 2-adrenergic antilipolytic sensitivity than did gluteal adipocytes, but the adenosine receptor sensitivity was similar in both sites. Beta-receptor affinity for agonists displayed no site or sex variation. Abdominal adipocytes showed a twofold increased beta-adrenoceptor density than did gluteal cells from both sexes. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor density was similar in all regions, but in females the affinity of clonidine for these sites was 10-15 times lower in the abdominal fat cells compared with gluteal cells. In conclusion, regional differences in catecholamine-induced lipolysis are regulated at the adrenoceptor level, chiefly because of site variations in beta-adrenoceptor density. Further variations in the affinity properties of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor in females may explain why the regional differences in catecholamine-induced lipolysis are more pronounced in women than in men.", 
    "73": "A double-blind, crossover comparison of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of controlled-release metoprolol (CR) 100 mg and 200 mg, metoprolol plain tablet 100 mg, metoprolol Durules 200 mg, and placebo was carried out in 10 healthy Chinese subjects. Standardized treadmill exercise tests according to the Bruce protocol were performed at a steady state of medication, before and 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after the dose, and multiple blood samples were collected for determination of the metoprolol concentration. The plasma metoprolol levels over 24 hours were more uniform after metoprolol CR than Durules and the plain tablet. The mean peak concentrations for CR 100 mg, 200 mg, Durules, and the plain tablets were 231, 426, 790, and 1105 nmol/l, respectively. The corresponding fluctuation incides were 1.1, 1.5, 2.2, and 5.0. The effects on exercise heart rate (EHR) were investigated at steady state. Metoprolol CR produced more even reduction in EHR over 24 hours than Durules and plain tablets. All four treatments gave similar maximal reduction in EHR of about 20% at 2 hours after the dose. In conclusion, once daily metoprolol CR showed almost even blood levels and provided relatively constant levels of beta1 blockade over 24 hours in healthy Chinese subjects.", 
    "74": "Ribose improves the function of the rat heart in various pathological conditions through its effects on cardiac energy metabolism, while having no direct haemodynamic actions. We therefore studied its functional and metabolic effects in closed chest rats when given in combination with prazosin, verapamil or metoprolol, all of which have direct effects on the circulation. Ribose administration for 24 h at 200 mg.kg-1.h-1 did not affect heart function but increased the available pool of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate in heart (four fold) and skeletal muscle (1.7-fold), as assessed by the incorporation of 14C-adenine into the adenine nucleotides. The utilisation of adenine for adenine nucleotide synthesis, expressed as the ratio of adenine nucleotide radioactivity to tissue extract radioactivity, was 70% in heart and 20% in skeletal muscle under control conditions, and 97% and 88% after 24 h of ribose administration. Ribose decreased the 14C-adenine incorporation into the adenine nucleotides in kidney, lungs and liver. After 24 h infusion of prazosin (100 micrograms.kg-1.h-1), heart rate and LVdP/dtmax were not changed, but LVSP (-20%), mean aortic pressure (-16%) and peripheral resistance (-40%) were decreased. Cardiac output was enhanced (+40%). Verapamil (2mg.kg-1.h-1) and metoprolol (2mg.kg-1.h-1) infused for 24 h decreased the pressure-rate and pressure-volume product of the left ventricle to the same extent (-40%). Verapamil had no influence on cardiac output, while metoprolol depressed it (-30%). Simultaneous administration of prazosin, verapamil or metoprolol with ribose did not affect the ribose induced increase in the myocardial 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pool.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Little is known of the significance of perivascular peptides in hypertension. In this study we have investigated the circulating levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) and substance P- like immunoreactivity (SP-LI) during and after treatment of severe hypertension. Seventeen patients with a mean blood pressure of 204/127 mmHg were included. Circulating levels of CGRP-LI and SP-LI in normotensive controls were 35 +/- 4 and 1.2 +/- 0.1 pmol/l, respectively. In the hypertensives CGRP-LI was significantly lower (22 +/- 3 pmol/l: P less than 0.05) while SP-LI did not differ (1.6 +/- 0.3 pmol/l) from the normotensives. After treatment the circulating level of CGRP-LI was still significantly lower (16 +/- 2 pmol/l: P less than 0.001) while SP-LI remained unchanged when compared with the controls. These observations suggest an involvement of vascular afferent nerves in the aetiology of hypertension in man.", 
    "76": "1. Evidence suggests that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its receptors are present in the peripheral nervous system. We have now investigated the effect of GABA and related substances on non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) neurally-evoked bronchoconstriction in the anaesthetised guinea-pig. 2. Bilateral vagal stimulation (5 V, 5 ms, 3 or 5 Hz) for 30 s, after propranolol (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) and atropine (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) evoked a NANC bronchoconstrictor response manifest as a mean tracheal pressure rise of 21.9 +/- 1.04 cmH2O (n = 70). The bronchoconstrictor response was reproducible for any given animal. 3. GABA (10 micrograms-10 mg kg-1 i.v.) did not alter basal tracheal pressure but reduced the NANC bronchoconstrictor response to vagal stimulation in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 = 186 micrograms kg-1 with a maximal inhibition of 74 +/- 3.4% at 10 mg kg-1). Neither the opioid antagonist naloxone (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) nor the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (2.5 mg kg-1 i.v.) had any significant effect on the inhibitory response produced by GABA (500 micrograms kg-1). 4. GABA-induced inhibition was not antagonised by the GABAA-antagonist bicuculline (2 mg kg-1 i.v.). 5. The GABAB-agonist baclofen (10 micrograms-3 mg kg-1 i.v.) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the NANC response (ED50 = 100 micrograms kg-1 with a maximal inhibition of 35.5 +/- 2.8% at 3 mg kg-1). The GABAA-agonist, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-C] pyridin-3-ol (THIP), also inhibited the NANC bronchoconstrictor response. However, the dose of THIP required for this effect was high (3 mg kg- ') and the effect ( <10% inhibition) was small. 6. Substance P (SP; 5upgkg-1 or 25pgkg-1), produced a bronchoconstrictor response equivalent to that produced by NANC vagal stimulation. This response was significantly increased by injection of GABA. Baclofen had no significant effect on responses evoked by exogenous SP. 7. We conclude that GABA inhibits the release of transmitter from NANC nerves via an action at GABAB receptors and that GABA might play a role in the regulation of neurogenic responses in the airways.", 
    "77": "Growth hormone (GH) release and cAMP content were measured in monolayer cultures of anterior pituitary cells after beta-adrenergic and GH-releasing factor (GRF) receptor activation. Isoproterenol (Iso, ED50-20 nM) was less potent than GRF (ED50-20 pM) in stimulating GH release. Iso caused a rapid stimulation of GH release that was maximal after 15 min and declined thereafter, while GRF caused a more gradual increase in GH secretion that was maximal after 30 min and remained elevated after 3 h. Both Iso- and GRF-stimulated GH release were preceded by an increase in cAMP content in the pituitary cells. Further, the addition of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to the medium enhanced the GH-stimulatory and cAMP-accumulating effects of both secretagogues. Experiments performed with native catecholamines and synthetic catecholamine agonists and antagonists indicated that the GH-stimulatory effect of Iso was mediated by a mixed population of beta 1-adrenergic and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Additionally, experiments performed with cultured GH3 tumor cells, found that incubation with GRF, Iso, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, forskolin, or cholera toxin caused an increase in cAMP content in the cells. However, compared to the responses observed in primary pituitary cultures the GH secretory response to these agents was comparatively small. Together, these studies suggest that a mixed population of beta 1-adrenergic and beta 2-adrenergic receptors may act, at least in part, on somatotrophs in the anterior pituitary to stimulate GH release. Although both GRF and beta 2-adrenergic receptor agents affect GH release through a common second messenger system, their differing pharmacokinetic properties suggest distinct intracellular mechanisms.", 
    "78": "The antihypertensive effect and safety of doxazosin once daily as well as the effect on serum lipids was compared with that of atenolol once daily in 40 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. During the first 4 weeks, all patients received placebo therapy. During the subsequent 46 weeks, patients were randomized to doxazosin or atenolol treatment. Treatment was initiated with 1 mg doxazosin or 50 mg atenolol once daily. The dose could be doubled biweekly for 10 weeks until a final dose of 16 mg doxazosin or 100 mg atenolol was reached. The patients then entered the maintenance phase for 36 weeks. The average final dose of doxazosin was 9.2 +/- 1.3 (SEM) mg and that of atenolol was 76.5 +/- 6.2 mg. During the 46 weeks of active treatment, the recumbent diastolic blood pressure (DBP) tended to be lower (p less than 0.05) in patients receiving atenolol at 10, 12, and 22 weeks of treatment. Recumbent systolic BP (SBP) and standing SBP and DBP were not different, however, between patients receiving doxazosin and those receiving atenolol. Recumbent and standing heart rate (HR) were lower (p less than 0.01) during atenolol. The decrease in serum total triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol after 46 weeks of doxazosin was different (p less than 0.05) from the changes observed during atenolol therapy. Our data indicate that the antihypertensive action of doxazosin is accompanied by favorable effects on serum lipids.", 
    "79": "The effect of four calcium antagonists (nifedipine, nitrendipine, nisoldipine, and verapamil) on hypoxia-induced changes in right ventricular parameters were examined in anesthetized closed-chest rats using an ultraminiature catheterization technique. The effect of the calcium antagonists was compared to the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin, the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril, and the vasodilator nitroglycerin. The animals were exposed to two successive 5-min hypoxic periods separated by a normoxic interval of 60 min, during which the animals received an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of the substances tested. Hypoxia caused a marked rise in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and a moderate increase in RVdP/dtmax. Heart rate (HR) was only slightly enhanced. The functional response to the second hypoxic period did not differ from the first one in NaCl-infused animals. All calcium antagonists reduced the hypoxic pressure increase in a dose-dependent manner and ultimately abolished it. Nisoldipine was the most effective substance, followed by nifedipine, nitrendipine, and verapamil. In contrast, prazosin and propranolol did not influence the hypoxic pressure response. Administration of captopril and nitroglycerin attenuated the increase in RVSP. Thus, as compared with the other substances tested, calcium antagonists were the most effective drugs that antagonized the hypoxia-induced increase in RVSP.", 
    "80": "The mechanism of action of a new orally active dopamine (DA) prodrug, TA-870 (N-(N-acetyl-L-methionyl)-O,O-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)(DA) was studied. When TA-870 (1 mg/kg) was injected in anesthetized dogs, renal vascular resistance was decreased and renal blood flow was increased. The renal vasodilatory effect of TA-870 correlated with the plasma level of DA but not with the level of de-ethoxycarbonyl metabolite of TA-870 (i.e., N-(N-acetyl-L-methionyl)DA; DEC-TA-870). The renal vasodilatory effect of TA-870 was inhibited strongly by haloperidol and slightly by propranolol. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine enhanced the renal vasodilatory effect of TA-870. In the isolated rabbit splenic artery, TA-870 and DEC-TA-870 showed no effects, whereas dopamine showed a contracting effect, which was inhibited by phentolamine. In the propranolol- and phentolamine-treated splenic artery, TA-870 and DEC-TA-870 caused weak relaxant effects on PGF2 alpha-induced contraction. These effects were not antagonized by metoclopramide. On the other hand, DA showed a strong relaxant effect, which was competitively inhibited by metoclopramide. In addition, TA-870 and DEC-TA-870 further relaxed the artery that had been maximally relaxed by DA. We concluded that TA-870 and DEC-TA-870 exert weak vasodilatory effects that are different from that of DA in vitro, and that TA-870 exerts its vasodilatory effect after its conversion to free DA in vivo.", 
    "81": "Recent electrophysiological studies with cell membrane patches of cardiac myocytes and an electrically excitable cell line derived from rat pituitary tumor suggested that voltage activated calcium channels must be phosphorylated to respond to membrane depolarization (Armstrong and Eckert 1986; Trautwein and Kameyama 1986). In view of the \"phosphorylation hypothesis\" we investigated the adenylate-cyclase activity, the characteristics of beta-adrenergic and calcium channel agonist binding sites in control and desensitized (exposure to isoproterenol) human embryonal cells (HEC), and in fragmented membrane preparations of canine coronary smooth muscle. Our results suggest that down-regulation of the membrane-bound beta-adrenergic receptors, induced by isoproterenol in human embryonal cells and also in adult canine vascular tissue, results in physical translocation of beta-adrenergic binding sites into the light membrane fraction. This phenomenon is accompanied with an increased intracellular concentration of cAMP in and an increased binding of the calcium channel agonist (3H) BAYK 8644 to both HEC and canine smooth muscle membrane preparations. It could be concluded that phosphorylation of beta-adrenergic receptors regulates not only the beta subcellular distribution of the beta receptors but also the availability of calcium channel agonist binding sites in the cellular membrane.", 
    "82": "beta-N-Oxalylamino-L-alanine (BOAA) and beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) were tested for their ability to produce acute excitotoxicity in in embryonic chick retina. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) release and histology were monitored in retina treated with various concentrations of BOAA, BMAA, kainate (KA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), or glutamate. BOAA and BMAA caused retinal lesions similar to those produced by the excitatory amino acids. BOAA was slightly less potent than KA, whereas BMAA had a potency similar to glutamate. BOAA, like KA and NMDA, caused a dose-dependent increase in GABA release. Addition of the NMDA antagonist (+)-MK-801, completely blocked acute excitotoxicity caused by NMDA or BMAA but was ineffective against KA or BOAA. Kynurenate, a nonspecific glutamate receptor antagonist, and DIDS, a Cl- channel blocker, were effective in blocking all agonist-induced toxicity. It is concluded that BOAA and BMAA cause excitotoxic damage in retina; BOAA induces toxicity through a non-NMDA type glutamate receptor and BMAA through the NMDA receptor.", 
    "83": "Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3; ethyl ester) in combination with atherogenic or non-atherogenic high fat diets was fed to young adult male marmoset monkeys for a period of 30 weeks. EPA markedly reduced the raised plasma cholesterol level evident when feeding an atherogenic diet but did not influence the cardiac membrane cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio. EPA and its elongation product 22:5 n-3 was incorporated into cardiac membrane phospholipids at the expense of linoleic and arachidonic acids. Dietary EPA increased cardiac beta-AR affinity and reversed the decreased beta-AR affinity evident when feeding an atherogenic diet.", 
    "84": "Positive compliance is essential for the successful treatment of coronary heart disease. To study the reasons for non-compliance of patients with angina pectoris 50 patients out of a sample of 2000 persons were recruited. Randomized telephone-calls were used. The 50 angina pectoris patients were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Another questionnaire was sent to all general practitioners and specialists for internal diseases in Austria. 675 doctors replied. The responding physicians reported a 68.9% positive compliance of the patients to pharmaceutical treatment of angina pectoris. Nevertheless most of the physicians believe that about half of the patients sometimes forget to take their medicine or change their therapeutic scheme or don't take the prescribed drugs if they have no symptoms. Patients suffering from angina pectoris confirm compliance problems, but significantly less often than doctors.", 
    "85": "Intraperitoneal administration of 0.8 mg/kg N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) to rats significantly reduced alpha-adrenoceptor binding in cerebral cortical membranes without affecting beta-adrenoceptor sites. A selective reduction in alpha 1-adrenoceptors was achieved by injecting yohimbine prior to EEDQ, whereas prazosin pretreatment yielded a selective reduction in alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding. Administration of EEDQ decreased norepinephrine-stimulated inositol phosphate and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in cerebral cortical tissue as well as the cAMP response to isoproterenol in combination with 6-fluoronorepinephrine without modifying the second messenger response to isoproterenol alone. The results suggest that, under the proper conditions, EEDQ administration can selectively diminish rat brain alpha-adrenoceptor number and function, yielding a procedure that may be useful for defining the behavioral and physiological properties of these sites.", 
    "86": "In patients with chronic renal disease, hypertension represents an important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular complications. Moreover, it appears possible that the progression of chronic renal failure may be slowed by carefully adjusted antihypertensive therapy. Therefore, blood pressure needs to be monitored very closely in patients with kidney disease and, when indicated, antihypertensive treatment should be started as soon as blood pressure begins to rise. Antihypertensive treatment of patients with non-oliguric renal failure has usually been started with dietary salt restriction and diuretic monotherapy. Other drugs, such as beta-blockers, sympathicolytic and/or vasodilating agents have been added successively. The possibility of beginning antihypertensive therapy with alternative compounds (beta-blocker, calcium antagonists and converting enzyme inhibitors) in patients with non-oliguric renal failure is discussed."
