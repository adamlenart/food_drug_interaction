    "0": "The beta-adrenergic catecholamine isoproterenol produces a large, rapid, but often a transient, elevation in cellular content of cyclic AMP. We have used the S49 mouse lymphoma cell line, in which genetic variants with specific defects in the pathway of cyclic AMP generation and function have been isolated, to study the increase and subsequent decrease in cyclic AMP levels (termed refractoriness) following incubation of cells with isoproterenol. In wild type S49 cells, isoproterenol produces a peak response in the cellular content of cyclic AMP within 30 min, but the cyclic AMP level falls rapidly thereafter, approaching basal levels by 6 h. Neither inactivation of the drug nor secretion of a nonspecific inhibitor of adenylate cyclase appears to account for the refractoriness. Because isoproterenol refractory cells can still be stimulated by cholera toxin, refractoriness to isoproterenol does not represent a generalized decrease in cellular cyclic AMP response. Particulate preparations from refractory cells have a selective loss of isoproterenol-responsive adenylate cyclase activity, but their activation constants and stereoselectivity for (-)- and (+)-isoproterenol are unaltered. In addition, refractory cells have decreased specific binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol. This decrease appears to represent a reduction in the number, but not the affinity, of beta-adrenergic receptor sites. Similar studies in an S49 clone that lacks the enzyme cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase yield essentially identical findings. Because kinase-deficient cells do not induce the cyclic AMP-degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase after the cellular content of cyclic AMP is increased, induced of phosphodiesterase cannot account for refractoriness to isoproterenol. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase does not appear to be required for either the decrease in beta-adrenergic receptors and isoproterenol-responsive adenylate cyclase, nor does it appear to be required for the development of refractoriness to isoproterenol. In contrast, an S49 clone lacking hormone-responsive adenylate cyclase activity but retaining beta-adrenergic receptors does not appear to lose receptors after being incubated with isoproterenol, either alone or together with dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Therefore, in this clone, receptor occupancy alone or in combination with elevated cyclic AMP levels is insufficient to cause refractoriness. Refractoriness thus appears to require intact adenylate cyclase. This suggests that adenylate cyclase may exert regulatory controls on beta-adrenergic receptors in addition to generation of cyclic AMP.", 
    "1": "Determination of specific GTPase (EC 3.6.1.--) activity in turkey erythrocyte membranes was achieved using low concentration of GTP (0.25 muM), inhibition of nonspecific nucleoside triphosphatases by adenosine 5'(beta,gamma-imino-triphosphate (App(NH)p) and suppression of the transfer of gamma-32P from GTP to ADP with an ATP regeneration system. Under these conditions catacholamines caused a 30--70% increase in GTP hydrolysis. The stimulation of GTPase activity by catecholamines required the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. DIfferent batches of membranes revealed the following specific activities (pmol 32Pi/mg protein min): basal GTPase (determined in the absence of catecholamine), 6-- 11; catecholamine-stimulated TTPase, 3--7; and residual non-specific NTPase 3--5. The stimulation of GTPase activity by catecholamines fulfilled the stereospecific requirements of the beta-adrenergic receptor, and was inhibited by propranolol. The concentrations of DL-isoproterenol which half-maximally activated the GTPase and adenylate cyclase were 1 and 1.2 muM, respectively. The following findings indicate that the catecholamine-stimulated GTPase is independent of the catalytic production of cyclic AMP by the adenylate cyclase. Addition of cyclic AMP to the GTPase assay did not change the rate of GTP hydrolysis. Furthermore, treatment of the membrane with N-ethylmaleimide (MalNEt) at 0 degrees C which caused 98% inhibition of the adenylate cyclase, had no effect on the catecholamine-stimulated GTPase. The affinity and specificity for GTP in the GTPase reactions are similar to those previously reported for the stimulation of the adenylate cyclase. The apparent Km for GTP in the basal and the catecholamine-stimulated GTPase reaction was 0.1 muM. These GTPase activities were inhibited by ITP but not by CTP and UTP. It is proposed that a catecholamine-stimulated GTPase is a component of the turkey erythrocyte adenylate cyclase system.", 
    "2": "Under the voluntary reporting scheme 499 cases of adverse drug reaction or reactions were reported. Noteworthy items included immediate hypersensitivity-type reactions to anaesthetic agents, a number of life-threatening reactions to anti-inflammatory drugs, paradoxical increase in blood pressure with high-dose pindolol and rebound hypertension after cessation of clonidine. A further 904 reactions were reported during an intensive survey in general practice and 342 from the ongoing hospital monitoring studies in units at the Auckland and Hutt hospitals. Data from numerous sources are now being channelled through the Committee's administrative centre. During the 11th year of operations 499 reports were received under the spontaneous reporting scheme. Additionally 342 reactions derived from the established hospital monitoring programmes at the Auckland Hospital and School of Medicine and the Hutt Hospital were notified to the Committee, and a further 904 reactions were received as a result of the intensive monitoring survey of drug reactions in general practice carried out in October and November 1975. The significance of each of these sets of data is substantially different and they will be discussed separately.", 
    "3": "The changes in plasma catecholamine concentration (deltaC) following beta-blockade (practolol, 15 mg) and atropinisation (Atropine, 1.8 mg) have been studied on 5 healthy male subjects during exercise on a motor driven treadmill. The results showed that for a given V-2 and % VO2 max, beta blockade was without effect on delta C (except in one athletic subject, but atropine produced a rise in deltaC. In relation to Q, both drugs produced an increase in deltaC, but for a given cardiac frequency (fH) deltaC was higher with beta blockade, and lower with atropinisation than found in control experiments. The intra- and inter-subject variability of delta C in relation of fH was resolved by considering the change in cardiac frequency calculated from baseline value obtained during walking at 6.44 km/h on the level, and expressed as a percentage of the maximal fH attainable for given individuals under the different drug and control conditions (%deltafH). It was concluded that during short term exercise, the rise of deltaC in relation to %deltafH reflects both the myocardial sensitivity to vagal and beta blockade, and the circulatory vasoconstrictor control of blood vessels which is required to sustain increases in systemic and muscle blood flow.", 
    "4": "The effects on the blood pressure and heart rate responses of different adrenergic stimulants (norepinephrine, sympathomim, epinephrine and isoproterenol) and blocking agents (phenoxybenzamine and propranolol) were studied in control (N=55) and exercising (N=52) albino rats under anaesthesia. The test rats exercised by regular swimming for 10-14 weeks. Alpha stimulation and beta blocking produced smaller responses while alpha blocking and beta stimulation were followed by greater changes after training as compared with the control animals. The assumption of a modified adrenergic receptor sensitivity could not be substantiated by the results; the observations indicate rather a complex change in the autonomous regulation following regular physical exercise.", 
    "5": "25 patients suffering from different hepatic diseases were studied in order to investigate the elimination of the beta-receptor blocking drug pindolol in hepatic disease. Following an overnight fasting period the patients received simultaneously 3 mg pindolol intravenously and 1000 mg antipyrine orally. Plasma samples were taken at certain time intervals for 24 hs and urine was collected for 72 hs for the measurements of drug concentrations in plasma and urine. From these measurements different pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for both drugs used in the present study according to a one-compartment open model. The total body clearance of antipyrine was selected as a parameter of the metabolic capacity of the liver microsomal enzyme system and was compared with the pharmacokinetic parameters calculated for pindolol by means of linear regression. There was no significant correlation between the total body clearance of antipyrine and the kinetic parameters of pindolol in any of the 25 patients irrespective of the differences in liver disease. On the other hand, 14 patients suffering from cirrhosis of the liver showed a significant correlation between the total body clearance of antipyrine and the overall elimination rate constant or metabolic clearance of pindolol. No correlation was found between antipyrine clearance and total body clearance of pindolol, as some patients with intact renal function excreted a higher proportion of pindolol in the urine as liver function decompensated. The mechanism of such compensatory elimination is unknown. In conclusion, the total body clearance of antipyrine known to represent metabolic liver function showed a significant correlation with the metabolic clearance of pindolol in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. For the other liver diseases investigated, too few patients were studied to calculate an adequate correlation.", 
    "6": "The aim of the trial was to see whether it was possible to improve morbidity and mortality in both males and females with diastolic pressures between 90 and 109 mm Hg. The initial calculations suggested that it would be necessary to screen between 250-500,000 people to obtain 18-36,000 subjects. This was the number predicted to obtain a statistically significant end-point on current knowledge of morbidity and mortality in this age range. The initial aim was to mount a trial of feasibility with the following objectives: (1) To recruit up to 1000 adults of both sexes aged 35 to 64 years with diastolic pressures in the 90-109 mm Hg range. (2) To determine the acceptability of the trial to asymptomatic subjects as well as their physicians. (3) To show that selected drugs (bendrofluazide and propranolol) adequately control pressure without undue side-effects. (4) To assess the psychological effects of inclusion in the trial. (5) To examine the cost and efficiency of different types of recruitment and supervision. These objectives have now been largely achieved with over 1500 subjects in the study at 2 1/2 years and a drop-out rate of about 13% in all. It appears that the best method of recruitment and supervision is through family practices with supporting staff, particularly in the screening phase. Both the selected drugs reduce the blood pressure significantly and although the placebo groups also show a maintained fall of pressure, the difference from the treated groups is significant. There is no evidence of increased psychological stress by inclusion in the trial and those with psychological symptoms at the outset improve in comparison with their control subjects outside the trial. In order to reach an end-point which will give data of statistical significance, the trial should now be expanded as rapidly as possible towards the goal of recruiting 18-36,000 subjects.", 
    "7": "The systemic hemodynamic was investigated in 145 young male patients with borderline hypertension and 85 control subjects. Response of the cardiac output, stroke volume and the heart rate to sequential parasympathetic, beta-adrenergic and alpha-adrenergic blockade was used for assessment of the autonomic nervous tone. These investigations suggest that the apparently \"innocent\" minimal blood pressure elevation in borderline hypertension is associated with a number of physiologic abnormalities: The cardiac output, heart rate and stroke volume can be elevated. In all patients the peripheral resistance is abnormal. An abnormal distribution of plasma renin values is detectable. The plasma volume is decreased in a proportion of patients. A number of these abnormalities can be explained by a neurogenic mechanism. The elevation of the cardiac output is entirely neurogenic. In a substantial minority of patients, the elevation of peripheral resistance is attributable to increased sympathetic drive. Indirect evidence indicates that the plasma renin elevation in borderline hypertension may also be neurogenic. Hypothetically the decreased plasma volume may stem from sympathetic effects on postcapillary vessels, but at the present there is no experimental evidence of support this view. The change in autonomic function in borderline hypertension involves both the sympathetic and parasympathetic efferents. Increased sympathetic stimulation is coupled with decrease parasympathetic inhibition. This points toward abnormal integration of the autonomic control, presumably in the medulla oblongata. The mechanism of the autonomic abnormality is not fully elucidated. The role of baroreceptors requires further investigation. In some patients the altered autonomic integration appears to be related to psychosomatic mechanisms.", 
    "8": "The new method for simultaneous determination of noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (A) and dopamine in 50 mul plasma has proved specific, sensitive and readily reproducible. In 6 healthy volunteers NA was 190 pg/ml and A 63 pg/ml in the supine position and rose during graded upright exercise to NA 819 pg/ml and A 161 pg/ml (150 watts; p less than 0.001 and less than 0.05 respectively). NA and A paralleled exercise tachycardia (r = 0.894; p less than 0.001) and renin stimulation (r = 0.620; p less than 0.001). 21 patients with essential hypertension exhibited relatively higher NA concentrations both at rest and during graded exercise (p less than 0.05 for both). Exercise-stimulated NA and A further rose following 0.15 mg/kg propranolol i.v. (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05 respectively). With increasing age and blood pressure, plasma catecholamine concentrations rise while the reactivity of heart rate and renin secretion decreases. Acute pharmacological blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors increases catecholamine overflow in similar fashion to the physiological dissociation of plasma catecholamines and adrenoceptor responsiveness.", 
    "9": "Hemodynamic and renin studies at rest and during graded upright ergometry were performed in 21 patients with essential hypertension before and after propranolol. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade reduced exercise-stimulated cardiac and renin responses significantly more when compared with the corresponding effects at rest. Propranolol increased peripheral resistance at rest but not during exercise. The degree of the individual hemodynamic changes after propranolol correlated better with the corresponding control values than with age or renin. A direct relationship between the percent reduction of heart rate and renin responses after acute beta-blockade indicates a parallel suppression of cardiac and renal receptor functions.", 
    "10": "(1) The apparent [3H]epinephrine binding parameters of plasma membranes from rat liver and ascites hepatomas such as AH-7974, AH-371A and AH-130, as measured by equilibrium dialysis and/or Millipore filtration, were almost similar to each other. The epinephrine binding sites in the plasma membranes were heterogenous (alpha, beta-receptors and non specific sites), but the pattern of these binding sites in the liver membranes appeared almost similar to that in the hepatoma membranes. 2. The beta-receptor seemed to be specifically involved in the epinephrine-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase of the liver membranes. In spite of the presence of almost similar beta-receptors and adenylate cyclase, the adenylate cyclase of hepatoma membranes was found to be less sensitive to the epinephrine-mediated activation. 3. GTP alone was found to activate adenylate cyclase of liver and hepatoma membranes to some extents when the concentration of ATP was lower (0.3 mM). When GTP was added with epinephrine, a marked, synergistic activation of adenylate cyclase was observed in liver plasma membranes, but not in hepatoma ones. 4. The synergistic activation of adenylate cyclase by epinephrine plus GTP showed a characteristic kinetic feature, reaching a maximal peak within 1 min or so after mixing. 5. Binding of [3H]epinephrine to liver membranes proceeded monophasically in the absence of GTP, while it proceeded biphasically in the presence of GTP, showing the retardation of binding at some earlier stages. GTP added at the time of binding equilibrium induced the temporary release of bound epinephrine from the beta-receptors. The GTP-induced temporary release of bound epinephrine, occurring within 4-5 min after the addition of GTP, was less marked in the hepatoma membranes as compared with the liver membranes. 6. Possible impairment of the GTP-dependent coupling mechanism in the receptor-adenylate cyclase system of hepatoma plasma membranes was suggested.", 
    "11": "The effect of metoprolol, a new beta1-adrenoceptor blocking agent, was compared to practolol in the treatment of hypertension in seventeen asthmatics during concurrent optimum bronchodilator therapy with a selective beta2-adrenoceptor-stimulant. The two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were given at two dose levels, practolol (200 mg and 400 mg) daily, and metoprolol (100 mg and 200 mg) daily, in a twice-daily dosage schedule, at 12 h intervals, for 17 days. The comparison was made double-blind and a crossover design was used. The drugs were given in randomized order. The study started with a run-in placebo period and there was a washout period on placebo between the treatment periods. Spirometry, blood pressures and heart rates were recorded in a standardized manner. At the lower dose levels no influence on FEV1 was noted, and no difference was found between the two active drugs. At the higher dose level FEV1 was reduced by both beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs. Four out of twelve patients given the higher dose experienced exacerbation of their asthma. The heart rate fell with both drugs and at both dose levels. During the placebo period a marked increase of heart rate was noted. The blood pressure fell at both dose levels compared to placebo, no difference being recorded between the two drugs. Metoprolol and practolol are equally effective beta1-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. In this study it was found that metoprolol could be used in asthmatics who had indications for beta-adrenoceptor blockade, provided that the total daily dose did not exceed 100 mg. Optimal bronchodilator treatment with a bronchoselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist is an absolute prerequisite in order to avoid the risk of aggravation of asthma.", 
    "12": "Methods of expressing the effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs on exercise heart rate have been evaluated using a standardised exercise test. In six normal subjects given atropine (0.04 mg/kg) on two separate occasions, the mean +/- s.e. mean exercise heart rate rose by 10.3 +/- 1.8 beats/min and by 11.0 +/- 1.6 beats/min respectively. This increase was designated the 'vagal effect and was not significantly different in the two studies. After atropinsation, propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) reduced mean +/- s.e. mean exercise heart rate by 45.3 +/- 2.6 beats/min and 0.4 mg/kg by 50.8 +/- 4.5 beats/min. This mean sympathetic blockade was not altered significantly by increasing the dose of propranolol but, in four of the six subjects, the larger dose produced an increased effect of 4, 6, 12 and 16 beats/min, suggesting that maximum sympathetic blockade may not have been produced by 0.2 mg/kg. Knowledge of the vagal effect in each subject with standardised exercise enabled prediction to be made of the exercise heart rate after propranolol (0.4 mg/kg) without previous atropinisation. Propranolol (0.4 mg/kg) was then given intravenously to each subject and the actual exercise heart rate measured. There was no significant difference between the predicted and observed exercise heart rates. Propranolol (0.6 mg/kg) without atropine was then given to the four subjects who had shown increased effect with (0.4 mg/kg) and the sympathetic blockade was measured. In one subject, a further increase in sympathetic blockade of 10 beats/min was found. The intrinsic heart rate at rest and on exercise was measured for propranolol (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) and, for propranolol (0.6 mg/kg), the intrinsic heart rate on exercise was calculated. At rest, although no significant difference was found between the two dose levels, three subjects did not appear to have maximum autonomic blockade at 0.2 mg/kg. Similarly, several subjects had lower intrinsic heart rates on exercise after 0.4 or 0.6 mg/kg than after 0.2 mg/kg. The intrinsic heart rate on exercise was significantly greater than that obtained at rest. Using the maximum sympathetic blockade obtained in each subject as the sympathetic component of exercise, the effects of increasing oral doses of practolol on exercise heart were measured as percentage blockade of sympathetic effect and this was compared with other conventional methods of measuring beta-adrenoceptor blockade. It was found that percentage blockade of sympathetic effect correlated most closely with both percentage and absolute reduction of exercise heart rate. Correlations with exercise heart rate after drug and percentage inhibition of tachycardia, whilst also significant, did not appear as good. When the effects of practolol were expressed in terms of the potential blockade, a plateau occurred between 70 and 80% of 'maximum' sympathetic blockade. The failure to achieve higher levels with practolol may be the result of its partial agonist or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "13": "The effects of hydraulic compression on heart rate and respiratory frequency were studied in liquid-breathing, hypothermic (17-31 degrees C) mice. Increasing the hydrostatic pressure caused a bradycardia that was first evident at 25 at. and progressed to 48% of the control heart rate at 175 at. The bradycardia was reversed, although incompletely, by decompression. Similar changes in respiratory frequency were seen. Autonomic blockage with atropine and propranolol did not change the response patterns to any major extent. Compression rate (2-6 at. x min-1) did not seem to influence the degree of heart-rate reduction. Compression caused an increase in colonic temperature, and decompression a decrease (0.5 degree C for a pressure change of 100 at.). These temperature changes could be ascribed partly to adiabatic heating and cooling of the body tissues as revealed by similar changes in dead animals and partly to increased metabolic heat generation in connection with compression-induced convulsions. The temperature changes, although partly accounting for the hysteresis in the heart-rate changes during compression/decompression, were not responsible for the major effects. It was concluded that high pressure causes bradycardia by a direct action on cardiac-pacemaker cells.", 
    "14": "Ninety-one patients with angiographically proved coronary artery disease and stable angina were randomly assigned into surgical and medical therapy. Graded exercise tests were performed on entry into the study and repeated in 1 year. Ventricular arrhythmias during exercise and 8 minutes of recovery were studied. Arrhythmias were graded on a scale of 0 to 7 by their presumed severity. On entry, both groups were similar in the severity of coronary disease, exercise capacity, and frequency and severity of exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias. At 1 year, the frequency and severity of arrhythmias remained unchanged in both groups, whereas the surgically treated patients showed a marked improvement in their exercise capacity (p less than 0.005). The medically treated patients had a slight deterioration in their work capacity which, however, did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.08). Twelve patients died suddenly. In seven medically treated patients who died suddenly, the frequency and severity of ventricular arrythmias on exercise were not different from those of the rest of the medical patients. In the five surgically treated patients who died suddenly, one had multiform premature ventricular beats, a second developed ventricular fibrillation (2 years before dying suddenly), and a third had no arrhythmias during exercise. Two died before the 1 year evaluation. Successful coronary surgery improves exercise capacity without decreasing associated ventricular arrhythmias. Exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, with the exception of ventricular fibrillation, may not be closely associated with the risk of sudden death.", 
    "15": "1. In eighteen subjects with mild to moderate hypertension the effectiveness of the new vasodilator drug L6150 (Lepetit) was studied. Its mechanism of action was identified by systemic and renal blood flow measurements and by estimating changes in plasma renin and aldosterone concentration and plasma volume. The reflexly induced hyperkinetic circulatory state could be completely corrected by adding propranolol or prevented by pretreatment with the latter drug. 2. Sodium retention was an invariable phenomenon. It was not due to a stimulation of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone axis since plasma aldosterone was significantly decreased, presumably as a consequence of plasma volume expansion.", 
    "16": "1. In a health examination survey of 2322 men, aged 49-50 years, the prevalence of hypertension was 7-5%. All men with a supine diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 105 mmHg were invited to a hypertension clinic. 2. Two years' treatment in eighty-six men achieved a blood pressure reduction of 31/16 mmHg, which was maintained for a 4 years period and considered satisfactory in 80% of the subjects. Propranolol was used in more than 80% of the cases. 3. The study indicates that it is possible to obtain acceptable blood pressure control in the community.", 
    "17": "1. Patients with moderate to severe hypertension were studied during a 12 weeks period, while taking a slow-release formulation of oxprenolol once daily, in a dose equal to their previous total daily dose of oxprenolol given in divided doses. 2. There were no significant differences between blood pressure at the beginning and end of the 12 weeks period. 3. Once-daily dosage offers advantages of patient compliance.", 
    "18": "1. Propranolol, when used for treating arterial hypertension, may influence determinants of both cardiac and vascular function; the consequent changes in cardiac performance may result from the interaction of different and possibly opposite effects. 2. Cardiac funtion was investigated in fifty-four primary hypertensive men in the pretreatment state and after 3 weeks of propranolol therapy at a daily dose of 320 mg. 3. beta-Receptor blockade caused depression of pre-injection left ventricular function, which was unrelated to the direction and the extent of changes in peripheral circulation. 4. The ejection left ventricular function could be either depressed or improved depending on the direction to which treatment shifted the vascular resistance, and consequently, the impedance to left ventricular ejection. 5. Withdrawal of the adrenergic support is probably the major factor responsible for the poor ventricular adaptation to an augmented impedance.", 
    "19": "1. The effect of long-term treatment with prindolol on blood pressure, total body potassium (Kt), exchangeable sodium (Nae) and plasma renin activity was investigated in twelve patients with essential hypertension. 2. Systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly reduced from 164/112 to 127/90 mmHg under basal conditions. 3. Before treatment Nae in patients with essential hypertension was significantly higher than in normotensive individuals. After an average of 16 weeks on prindolol Nae in patients with essential hypertension was significantly decreased, despite an average increased in body weight of 2 kg in the patients. 4. In contrast to the decrease in Nae, Kt was found to be significantly increased after long-term treatment with prindolol. Kt values of patients before and after prindolol, however, did not differ significantly from the corresponding sex- and age-dependent normal values. 5. Plasma renin activity was slightly diminished under basal and orthostatic conditions; the stimulatory effect orthostatis was not abolished but reduced by prindolol. 6. It is suggested that the changes in sodium balance contribute to the anti-hypertensive effect of prindolol in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "20": "1. Intravenous infusion of propranolol (3-86 micronmol h-1 kg-1) for 2 h lowered arterial pressure in the conscious rabbit whereas similar infusions of practolol (37-6 micronmol h-1 kg-1) did not. 2. The fall in blood pressure produced by propranolol was accompanied by a decrease in splanchnic nerve activity. Practolol did not change splanchnic nerve activity. 3. A centrally mediated decrease in sympathetic nervous activity makes an important contribution to the hypotensive action of propranolol in the rabbit. This effect is not shown by practolol.", 
    "21": "1. Acute oral administration of metoprolol and propranolol to ten normal males resulted in equal reduction in heart rate both supine and after passive tilting to 60 degrees. 2. Tilted systolic blood pressure was reduced by both agents but metoprolol alone reduced supine systolic blood pressure. 3. Tilted but not supine diastolic blood pressure was reduced by both agents. 4. Metoprolol and propranolol both reduced the rise in plasma renin activity induced by tilting. 5. No effect of tilting was observed on plasma aldosterone.", 
    "22": "1. Blood pressure was controlled to the same extent whether propranolol or pindolol was given once or three times/day. 2. The anti-hypertensive action of beta-receptor-blocking drugs persisted for 36-48 h when administration ceased.", 
    "23": "1. After some exclusions, 169 severe uncomplicated essential hypertensive patients presenting consecutively were divided into two groups according to their treatment. Of these, 121 had been given longterm treatment containing propranolol (PC group) and forty-eight had been treated with hypotensive agents excluding any beta-receptor-blocker group, the non-beta-receptor-blocker (NBB) group. 2. There were no significant differences in myocardial infarction risk factors between the two groups. 3. After a mean follow-up of 5-25 years, nine of the 121 subjects (7-5%) in the PC group had suffered first infarctions and fifteen of the forty-eight subjects (31%) in the NBB group, a significant difference (P less than 0-01). 4. It was concluded that the presence of propranolol had prevented more or caused fewer infarctions, perhaps a combination of both, than had the older hypotensive agents unsupported by beta-receptor blockade.", 
    "24": "1. Labetalol (AH 5158) is a new drug which has both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist activity. Labetalol has been compared with propranolol and placebo for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension (150/100 to 189/114 mmHg), in a double-blind cross-over trial with three 10 week treatment periods. 2. Both drugs reduced blood pressures in nine of the ten patients who have completed the trial. Relative to placebo labetalol caused decreases in supine pressures similar to those caused by propranolol (average -10/-10 and -10/-9 mmHg respectively), with a greater effect on standing (labetalol -20/-19; propranolol -8/-12 mmHg; P less than 0-01) and after exercise (labetolol -27/-18 and propranolol -16/-14 mmHg). 3. Labetalol and propranolol caused a similar fall in supine pulse rate (-11/min and -13/min respectively), but there was less bradycardia on standing (labetalol -11/min; propranolol -18/min; P less than 0-001) and after exercise (labetalol -17/min; propranolol -23/min; P less than 0-001). 4. The average dose ratios of labetalol to propranolol was 2-4:1 (w/w). 5. These results suggest that the effect of labetalol on blood pressure involves both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist properties. 6. Further evaluation of labetalol is warranted as it may have some advantages in respect of producing less bradycardia, improved peripheral blood flow and less effect on airways resistance than 'pure' beta-receptor-blocking agents.", 
    "25": "1. Labetalol, a compound with both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking actions, was given intravenously (1-5-2-0 mg/kg) in twenty recumbent hypertensive patients. 2. There was a rapid reduction in systolic and diastolic pressures in all, maintained up to 24 h in some subjects. 3. Severe hypotension was not seen in recumbent subjects, but postural hypotension was common. 4. Labetalol caused significant lowering of heart rate. 5. Labetalol induced significant and related lowering of plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations, most obviously when these were initially high. 6. In a cross-over comparison in five patients against 10 mg of propranolol intravenously, labetalol was more effective in lowering blood pressure, but less effective in lowering pulse rate or plasma angiotensin II.", 
    "26": "1. Haemodynamic and renin responses to dynamic exercise before and after intravenous beta-adrenoreceptor blockade with propranolol were compared in twenty-one patients with essential hypertension and either high (n = 7), normal (n = 7) or low plasma renin activity (n = 7). 2. Renin and heart-rate responses to exercise and beta-receptor blockade diminished from high-renin to normal and to low-renin patients, effects which were blunted with increasing age. 3. Among the renin groups cardiac output, stroke volume, diastolic pulmonary artery pressure, systemic pressure and peripheral vascular resistance as well as their changes produced by exercise and acute beta-receptor blockade were not significantly different. 4. Long-term anti-hypertensive propranolol effects correlated with pre-treatment renin status, renin stimulation and its suppression by acute beta-receptor blockade as well as with the exercise tachycardia and the patient's age. 5. The results suggest different adrenergic control mechanisms in renin sub-types of essential hypertension, age being a modulating factor.", 
    "27": "1. Central and regional haemodynamics and leg metabolism at rest, during and after a prolonged exercise were studied in seven untreated hypertensive males before and after a long-term treatment (6 weeks) with an unselective beta-receptor-blocking drug (alprenolol). 2. Alprenolol treatment (200-400 mg, twice daily) decreased arterial blood pressure at rest and during exercise; it reduced heart rate in relation to drug plasma concentrations during and after exercise; it left cardiac output unchanged; it reduced leg blood flow at rest, but had no effect on leg blood flow during exercise. 3. Alprenolol treatment also decreased lipolysis and lactate release in relation to drug plasma concentrations during exercise.", 
    "28": "1. Plasma noradrenaline was measured in fifty-nine patients with mild to severe essential hypertension and in fifteen normotensive control subjects under basal and orthostatic conditions. 2. In patients with essential hypertension mean plasma noradrenaline concentrations were significantly higher than in control subjects under basal and orthostatic conditions. 3. In patients with essential hypertension basal diastolic blood pressure correlated closely with the corresponding plasma noradrenaline concentrations. 4. Long-term treatment with prindolol of patients with essential hypertension led to a significant fall in diastolic and systolic blood pressure and heart rate and to a significant decrease in plasma noradrenaline concentrations under basal and orthostatic conditions. 5. The adrenergic response to upright posture, reflected by an increase in plasma noradrenaline, was not abolished by prindolol. 6. It is concluded that the anti-hypertensive effect of prindolol in patients with essential hypertension is at least partially mediated by a decrease of sympathetic nervous activity.", 
    "29": "1. Acebutolol, a beta1-receptor blocker, has, at a daily dose of 800 mg, a mild but significant anti-hypertensive effect in moderate sustained essential hypertension with normal or low plasma renin activity. 2. Prediction of its anti-hypertensive effect is better based on the evaluation of the sympathetic nervous system responsiveness to head-up tilt than on the evaluation of plasma renin activity or dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. 3. The anti-hypertensive effect of acebutolol is better explained on the basis of inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system activity than on the basis of suppression of plasma renin activity. 4. A positive correlation between plasma renin activity and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase in patients on diuretics suggests the common dependence of these two variables on sympathetic overactivity.", 
    "30": "1. Serum dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was determined in normotensive control subjects and patients with labile or established essential hypertension. The enzyme activity was 25-9 +/- 1-9 (SEM) 29-6 +/- 2-5 and 25-1 +/- 1-9 micronmol min-1 1-1, for control, labile and established hypertensive subjects respectively. 2. Neither blood pressure nor serum dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was changed in normotensive control subjects by administration of phentolamine; however, in patients with essential hypertension blood pressure was significantly decreased (P is less than 0-01) and serum dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was slightly increased. With propranolol administration, blood pressure and the serum enzyme activity were not significantly changed in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. 3. Our results suggest that there is no correlation between serum dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity and blood pressure.", 
    "31": "1. The hypotensive effect of propranolol and its correlation with the changes in heart rate, plasma volume and plasma renin activity produced by this drug were studied in normotensive rats and in rats with spontaneous, renovascular and deoxycorticosterone-induced hypertension. 2. No correlation was found between the fall in arterial pressure and the reduction in heart rate and plasma volume. On the contrary, a direct correlation was found between the hypotensive response and plasma renin activity: rats with high renin showed the maximum response, those with low renin no response. 3. Studies on blood volume distribution in different organs and the direct measurement of blood flow in the splanchnic bed demonstrated a significant correlation between the effect of propranolol on capillary permeability and the haemodynamic changes which it causes, namely a significant increase in portal venous pressure.", 
    "32": "1. Oral and intravenous administration of metoprolol to adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with established hypertension lowered arterial blood pressure within 4 days of treatment. 2. Steady state plasma concentrations of metoprolol were similar to those of patients during anti-hypertensive treatment with this drug. 3. The neuroeffector function of portal veins of SHR treated orally for 14 days or intravenously for 4 days was not impaired when studied in vitro. This is in contrast to previous findings after long-term treatment. 4. It is concluded that the anti-hypertensive effect of metoprolol in SHR in many respects resembles that observed in patients. It is suggested that impairment of vasomotor nerve control may contribute to the anti-hypertensive effect of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists.", 
    "33": "1. Plasma catecholamines and adrenergic correlates of cardiac function were compared in young men with borderline hypetension, classified according to renin status (group 1). Plasma catecholamines were increased and cardiac pre-ejection periods were shortened in 'high'-renin patients. 2. Plasma catecholamines were raised in 70% of 'high'-renin patients with primary hypertension (group 2), were related directly with age in normotensive females and were related inversely with catecholamine responses to postural stress in both normotensive and hypertensive subject (P less than 0-01). 3. The raised catecholamines of four 'high'-renin patients with pronounced features of sympathetic nerve activity-acricatures were elevated further during,hypertensive periods. Mean arterial blood pressures were reduced 20-30% after either alpha- or beta-receptor blockade. Catecholamines were reduced after beta-receptor blockade. 4. There appears to be a spectrum of neurogenic 'gain' in primary hypertension; it is suppressed in 'low'-renin hypertension, directly related to blood pressure in 'normal'-renin hypertension, increased in 'high'-renin hypertension and achieves a maximum in caricatures. Neurogenic factors seem to be important in the cause and maintenance of 'high'- and 'normal'-renin hypertension respectively. The caricatures may be examples of a severe form of hypothalamic stimulation.", 
    "34": "1. The immediate short-term effects of intravenous injections of propranolol on plasma renin activity were studied in thirty-one normal subjects, 102 patients with benign essential and sixty-six patients with renal hypertension. 2. In essential hypertensive patients and normal subjects a marked fall in plasma renin activity was observed within 15 min, which was directly proportional to initial plasma renin values. In contrast, in patients with renal hypertension the fall observed was much less pronounced, or totally absent. 3. These differences in response to propranolol, which were particularly pronounced in patients with high initial renin values, suggest a dominant role of sympathetic tone at the juxtaglomerular apparatus for basal renin release in normal individuals and essential hypertensive subjects only. 4. The observations also indicate that sympathetic activity plays no part in the control of basal renin secretion in patients with renal hypertension, in whom basal renin secretion may be maintained by the renal baroreceptors.", 
    "35": "1. Plasma renin activity (PRA) in peripheral venous blood of patients with renovascular hypertension was found to be high (thirty-five), normal (twenty-one) and low (three). Twenty-one patients with high PRA were cured or improved after successful surgery, as were eight of eleven with normal PRA and one with a low PRA. After surgery high PRA values became normal or low. 2. A beta-receptor-blocking agent (oxprenolol) decreased PRA in twenty-eight patients (responders) and it either did not modify or increased PRA in the other fifteen (non-responders). All fourteen non-responders were cured by surgery, as were thirteen out of fifteen responders; ten non-responders became responders after surgery. Oxprenolol suppressed renin secretion of both kidneys of two patients with essential hypertension, and it either decreased (six) or did not modify (four) renin secretion from the ischaemic kidney. 3. PRA measurement in renal veins of twenty-six patients with renovascular hypertension showed that only the ischaemic kidney contributes to the peripheral PRA, renin secretion being suppressed in the contralateral kidney. The suppression of renin secretion from the ischaemic kidney produced either by nephrectomy (nine) or by aortorenal by-pass (six) normalized blood pressure. 4. Peripheral PRA values are of poor diagnostic significance and PRA unresponsiveness to a beta-receptor-blocking drug and the suppression of renin secretion from the ischaemic kidney are characteristic findings of renovascular hypertension curable by appropriate surgery.", 
    "36": "1. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and renin dependency of the blood pressure was analysed in ten patients with various forms of hypertension before and during treatment with volume depletion and/or propranolol. Renin dependency was tested by infusion of the specific competitive angiotensin II antagonist Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II (P113). 2. The P113-induced fall of the blood pressure did correlate with the log PRA (r=0-888, P less than 0-001). This correlation was found irrespective of different types of hypertension and treatment schedules. 3. During volume depletion, PRA was stimulated and renin dependency of the blood pressure increased. Propranolol therapy suppressed PRA during normovolaemia as well as during volume depletion, and this was accompanied by a decrease of the renin dependency. 4. No incication was found that a given PRA is of special importance for blood pressure elevation in different patients. 5. Suppression of PRA by propranolol is one of the anti-hypertensive mechanisms of this drug.", 
    "37": "Prostaglandins A2, B1, E1, E2, F1alpha and F2alpha were added to cultures of human epidermal cells (keratinocytes) for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, and the effects on 3H-thymidine uptake into DNA was measured. At 70 mu/ml all prostaglandins tested except PGF2alpha inhibited the uptake of 3-thymidine greater than 50%. However, at 35 mug/ml, PGA2 and PGB1 were the only two prostaglandins to show significant inhibition, 96% and 51% respectively. At 17.5 mug/ml only PGA2 caused substantial inhibition, 68%. In order to determine if the PGA2 action was mediated by membrane receptors propranolol, phentolamine, metiamide and prostynoic acid were added in conjunction with PGA2. None of the above receptor antagonists were able to reduce the PGA2-induced inhibition of 3H-thymidine uptake. These results indicate that the pre-incubation of human keratinocytes with prostaglandins for 24 hours results in a decrease of 3H-thymidine incorporation in DNA. The precise mechanism of action is unknown at this time.", 
    "38": "In a previous experiment, fetopathic effects of caffeine were significantly reduced by pretreatment with propranolol at dosage levels of 2.5 to 10 mg/kg. The present experiments were undertaeken to investigate the relation between time intervals of propranolol pretreatment and its effect on reducing fetopathy. Furthermore, the effect of timolol, another beta-adrenergic blocking agent, on reducing fetopathy was compared with that of propranolol. Propranolol (5 mg/kg) administered 15, 30 or 60 minutes before caffeine treatment significantly reduced the caffeine-induced fetopathy. The optimal effect was found when propranolol was given 30 minutes before caffine. The reduction in fetopathy by timolol pretreatment was comparable to that of propranolol. The results lend support to the hypothesis that the fetopathic effect of caffeine is linked with released catecholamines in material or fetal issues of mice.", 
    "39": "Electrophysiologic study in 30 patients with documented SVT, 16 of whom had preexcitation, and in 24 control subjects were reported. The mechanism of SVT were found to be various and to include reentry confined to the AV node, SA node or the atrium, reentry through accessory pathway and ectopic atrial automaticity. It was noted that some of SVT might use concealed accessory pathway in VA direction while the some of SVT in WPW syndrome might not utilize accessory pathways. Electrophysiological properties in cases with SVT did not differ from those observed in controls. There were no differences in the mode of electrophysiological action of drugs between XVT and control groups. Both propranolol and procaine amide slightly depressed AV conduction. However, the action of the drugs on echo zone were not the same. The basic mechanisms of the action of the drugs in SVT were discussed.", 
    "40": "Parzosin, 0.001 to 10 mg/kg, was administered intravenously to anesthetized normal rats. In the dose range 0.001 to 0.01 mg/kg, the drug induced highly significant, dose-related falls in blood pressure, pulse pressure and heart rate. With doses above 0.01 mg/kg, there was a plateau in hypotensive efficacy and a diminution in negative chronotropic activity. Both actions of prazosin (0.01 mg/kg) were unaffected by vagal blockade with atropine, while hypotensive potency was unimpaired after beta-adrenoreceptor blockade. The vasodilator, diazoxide, lowered blood pressure, widened pulse pressure and caused tachycardia in rats pre-treated with pentolinium. In contrast, all effects of prazosin were abolished by ganglion blockade. These findings, together with the absence of compensatory tachycardia or gross renin hypersecretion during prazosin-induced hypotension, are compatible with an antisympathotonic mode of action for the drug. However, consistent with its effects on cyclic nucleotide distribution, prazosin appears to enhance isoprenaline-induced beta-receptor stimulation.", 
    "41": "The analysis of the parameters of haemodynamics and gas exchange in connection with the tolerance of physical exercises in 57 patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease treated with Obsidan permitted to distinguish two variants of response to the exercises. The first is characterized by a greater increase of the cardiac output and by a slighter participation of the oxygen utilization coefficient and oxygen pulse in ensuring the oxygen regimen of work. The prescription of Obsidan is rational in the first variant of response to the physical exercises.", 
    "42": "Blood pressure increases will increase heart rate in intact chick embryos, prior to the development of neural control. Similarly, in surgically isolated hearts, increases in intraventricular fluid pressure will increase the rate of beat. However, fluid pressure applied equally to both interior and exterior surfaces of the isolated heart does not result in increased heart rate. Therefore, we conclude that the increased pressure stretches the heart muscle and that this stretch stimulates the increased heart rate. While heart rate is clearly influenced by blood pressure, the reverse is not true. Propranolol reduces the heart rate to about half normal in intact embryos but does not significantly alter the blood pressure.", 
    "43": "Systemic and pulmonary haemodynamics were studied at rest in the supine and upright position, and during exercise in the sitting position at 75 and 150 Watt, in 13 hypertensive men aged 50-8 +/- 8-7 years before and after 13 months treatment with oral oxprenolol (120 to 160 mg t.i.d.) supplemented by oral hydrallazine (50 to 75 mg t.i.d.) during the last 6 months. Pressures were recorded by means of catheters inserted percutaneously into the pulmonary and brachial artery; cardiac output was determined according to Fick. Treatment resulted in a significant reduction of systemic systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures at rest in the supine position and during exercise, and of systolic pressures in the upright posture. Pulmonary systolic and mean pressures increased slightly at rest in the supine position and during exercise, and no changes occurred at rest in the upright position. The left ventricular filling pressure was unchanged at rest both in the supine and upright position; it increased slightly during exercise. The haemodynamic changes by which systemic pressure was reduced were those typical of beta-adrenergic blockade: reduction of cardiac output resulting from a decrease of both heart rate and stroke volume, while the total systemic vascular resistance was unchanged at rest in the supine position but increased in the upright posture and during exercise. The A-V O2 difference increased remarkably. This long-term observation again suggests that the acute haemodynamic effects of an antihypertensive regimen can be modified during long-term application. It did not give evidence of a readjustment of the vascular resistance occurring, at least not in the upright position and during exercise, as has been suggested for long-term beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "44": "The effects of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, DL-propranolol, and of the antithyroid drug, carbimazole, upon some manifestations of thyroxine (T4)-induced changes in peripheral metabolism were studied in rats. Propranolol lowered the heart rate, but did not alter the following changes induced by T4: increment in heart rate, increase in heart or kidney weight, increase in urinary hydroxyproline, decrease in body weight gain or increase in serum T4. Carbimazole administration lowered serum T4 and reduced weight gain, but had no effect upon heart rate or hydroxyproline excretion.", 
    "45": "The ventilatory effects of beta-adrenergic blockade during steady-state exercise were studied in eight normal subjects using intravenous propranolol hydrochloride (0.2 mg/kg). Heart rate decreased in all subjects by an average of 17%. Coincident with the phase of decreasing heart rate was a significant decrease in both minute ventilation (VE) and CO2 output (VCO2), averaging 9.6 and 9.2%, respectively. Both functions returned to prepropranolol levels after heart rate had reached its reduced steady-state value. The change in VE was significantly correlated with the change in VCO2 (r = 0.85, P less than 0.005), and was associated with negligible changes in endtidal CO2 tensions and ventilatory equivalents for CO2. We interpret these studies as showing that the transient isocapnic hypopnea concomitant with an acute reduction in cardiac output was secondary to a transient decrease in CO2 flux (cardiac output x mixed venous CO2 content). This decrease in VE appears to be induced by the acute decrease in cardiac output (\"cardiodynamic hypopnea\"), in fashion similar to the previously described cardiodynamic hyperpnea.", 
    "46": "A study on the effect of acebutolol, a new beta receptor antagonist, on the resting and post-exercise heart rate and rate-pressure product was carried out in 8 normal volunteers. Intravenous administration of 10 and 20 mg acebutolol was compared with 10 and 20 mg practolol administered at weekly intervals. In the oral study, increasing doses of acebutolol were administered over a period of 20 days. The heart rate and blood pressure was recorded before and at the completion of 4-minute exercise period. The exercise was carried out on a bicycle ergometer at 150 watt per minute for 4 minutes. In a dose to dose comparison, the potencies of acebutolol and practolol administered intravenously were of the same order, in decreasing the resting and post-exercise heart rate and rate pressure product. Their duration of action was also similar. In the oral study, the peak effect was achieved at a dosage of 200 mg per day (100 mg twice daily) of acebutolol. Acebutolol decreased the resting as well as post-exercise rate-pressure product (cardiac work load). This may be the mechanism for the reported beneficial effect in angina pectoris. Acebutolol was well tolerated and no serious side-effects were observed.", 
    "47": "The relationship between cumulative doses of practolol and atenolol and resultant decreases in exercise tachycardia has been examined in 4 healthy volunteers. Continuous intravenous infusions of practolol (0.4 mg/kg), atenolol (0.12 mg/kg) and saline were administered between 7 and 12 minutes of bicycle exercise. The mean (+/- S.E.M.) heart rate (HR) at 7 min. for practolol (133 +/- 5.1) and atenolol (132 +/- 2.8) were significantly (p less than .01) reduced to 115 +/- 2.3 and 104 +/- 2.9 beats/min. respectively. The pre-infusion HR in the saline study (132 +/- 1.2) was unchanged (133 +/- 4.6) at 12 min. The relationship between the log cumulative dose of each drug and the per cent fall in HR/min was linear for each subject. The log dose-response curve (mean of 4 subjects) for practolol (y = 9.6x + 18.1) was more horizontal than for atenolol (y = 18.4x + 38.6).", 
    "48": "A method is described for the preparation of isolated bovine parathyroid cells. Fresh, minced bovine parathyroid tissue is incubated with 2 mg/ml collagenase and 50 mug/ml DNAse for 1 h at 37 C with periodic pipetting. Parthyroid cells are separated from contaminating fat cells and red cells by low speed centrifugation. The resulting cell preparation is indistinguishable from parathyroid cells in intact bovine glands by light and electron microscopy. Hormone release is linear for at least 3 h at both high (2.0 mM) and low (0.5 mM) calcium concentrations and is inversely proportional to divalent cation concentration between 0.3 mM and 1.0 mM calcium as been observed previously both in vivo and in vitro. As in previous studies, hormone release is also stimulated up to 2-fold by 10(6) M (-)isoproterenol, an effect blocked by 10(-6)M (-)propranolol, suggesting a beta-adrenergic effect. Such a cell preparation should be useful for studying hormone binding and effects on cyclic nudleotides and cellular transport phenomena in both normal amd abnormal tissue.", 
    "49": "To characterize the pattern of pacemaker dominance in the ventricular specialized conduction system (VSCS), escape ventricular pacemakers were localized and quantified in vivo and in virto, in normal hearts and in hearts 24 hours after myocardial infarction. Excape pacemaker foci were localized in vivo during vagally induced atrial arrest by means of electrograms recorded from the His bundle and proximal bundle branches and standard electrocardiographic limb leads. The VSCS was isolated using a modified Elizari preparation or preparations of each bundle branch. Peacemakers were located by extra- and intracellular recordings. Escape pacemaker foci in vivo were always in the proximal conduction system, usually the left bundle branch. The rate was 43+/-11 (mean+/-SD) beats/min. After beta-adrenergic blockade, the mean rate fell to 31+/-10 beats/min, but there were no shifts in pacemaker location. In the infarcted hearts, pacemakers were located in the peripheral left bundle branch. The mean rate was 146+/-20 beats/min. In isolated normal preparations, the dominant pacemakers usually were in the His bundle, firing at a mean rate of 43+/-10 beats/min. The rates of pacemakers diminished with distal progression. In infarcted hearts, the pacemakers invariably were in the infarct zone. The mean firing rates were not influenced by beta-adrenergic blockade. The results indicate that the dominant pacemakers are normally in the very proximal VSCS, but after myocardial infarction pacemaker dominance is shifted into the infarct. Distribution of pacemaker dominance is independent of sympathetic influence.", 
    "50": "The efficacy and side effects of the combined administration of propranolol and phenoxybenzamine were examined in 19 patients with moderate and moderately severe essential hypertension. By titrating the dosage of both drugs against pulse rate and blood pressure response, propranolol was given between 80 and 160 mg. and phenoxybenzamine between 20 and 50 mg. per day in divided doses. There was a substantial reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both recumbent and upright positions without orthostatic hypotension. Normal blood pressure (140/90 mm. Hg or less) or near normal (150/100 mm. Hg or less) was attained in 14 of the patients in the recumbent and 17 in the upright position. Pulse rate also decreased significantly, whereas body weight increased but not significantly so. Except for a reduction of ejaculation in three out of six male subjects, no symptomatic side effects were detected, and no changes in the liver or renal function or in blood count were observed. Despite the short duration of therapy, 3 to 10 weeks, this study clearly demonstrates that propranolol and phenoxybenzamine given together in individualized doses are very effective in lowering arterial blood pressure with minimal side effects.", 
    "51": "In a previous investigation, parasympathetic activation of the submandibular gland in the cat was found to cause a considerable increase of regional tissue osmolality, the degree of which was related to the evoked functional hyperemia; intra-arterial hypertonic infusion to the resting gland producing tissue hyperosmolality of similar magnitudes caused graded and marked dilatations (Lundvall and Holmberg 1974). It was concluded that hyperosmolality contributes significantly to the functional hyperemia response. In the present study evidence is presented to indicate that tissue hyperosmolality is a mediator of the dilatation associated with sympathetic activation as well. An increase of tissue hyperosmolality, as traced in the venous effluent, was found at all frequencies of sympathetic stimulation (2-16 Hz). At high stimulation rates it sometimes exceeded the resting control level by more than 20 mOsm/kg H2O. There was a direct relation between the degree of venous hyperosmolality and the hyperemia response observed immediately after cessation of stimulation. Comparison of the dilator effects evoked by sympathetic stimulation and by hypertonic infusion to the resting gland indicated that tissue hyperosmolality is an important causal factor for the nerve induced dilatation, especially at low and moderate stimulation rates.", 
    "52": "A methods of prolonged epicardial surface mapping of myocardial infarction by serial epicardial ECG's is described. The progression of infarction following coronary artery ligation in dogs was monitored over a 4 day period and the early and late changes in the configuration of the epicardial ECG's associated with the underlying myocardial injury were defined. The determination of the infarct size by surface mapping in vivo correlated accurately with the final infarct size determined by dehydrogenase staining in vitro. Treatment with propranolol resulted in a significant reduction in the infarct size. Treatment with intra-aortic balloon pumping did not alter the size of the myocardial infarction induced in this experimental model.", 
    "53": "The influence of fusaric (5-butylpicolinic) acid on vascular contractile or relaxing response was examined in different isolated arterial preparations of the rabbit. Prior exposure (10 minutes) to 1 x 10(-4) to 1 x 10(-3) M fusaric acid decreased contractile responses elicited with norepinephrine, histamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, angiotensin II and KCl in helical strips of rabbit aorta and superior mesenteric, carotid, renal, and femoral arteries. Fusaric acid produced a shift to the right and down in the dose-response curves to all tested agonists, and antagonized acetylcholine and serotonin most effectively among these agonists. These results indicate that fusaric acid antagonized nonspecifically these contractile agonists. When blood vessels were contracted with prostaglandin F2alpha, fusaric acid caused relaxation of rabbit aorta and superior mesenteric, carotid, renal, and femoral arteries in a dose-dependent fashion. Among blood vessels tested superior mesenteric arteries were relaxed the most effectively by fusaric acid. The concentration of fusaric acid which induced 50% relaxation of aortic strips was about 10-fold higher than that of papaverine. Propranolol and atropine did not affect fusaric acid-induced relaxation, suggesting that fusaric acid did not work through beta adrenergic or cholinergic receptors. Ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl-ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid which chelates with Ca++ caused blood vessel relaxation in doses similar to those of fusaric acid. As fusaric acid is known to chelate Ca++, a possible mechanism of fusaric acid to relax blood vessel through Ca++ depletion is discussed briefly.", 
    "54": "Minoxidil has a direct dilator effect on the systemic arterial smooth muscle. It is potentially an important drug in the treatment of systemic hypertension, especially when combined with beta blockade, which is used to control the associated tachycardia and increase in cardiac output. However, recent observations have suggested that minoxidil might cause pulmonary hypertension. Consequently, we examined the acute effect of monoxidil and propranolol, separately and in combination, on the pulmonary vasculature of the anesthetized dog and the awake calf during normoxia and hypoxia. In both species minoxidil reduced pulmonary vascular resistance. In the dogs this appeared to be the result of a direct action on the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle and in the cattle it was secondary to beta-receptor stimulation. Propranolol alone in the cattle increased the pulmonary pressor response to hypoxia. While we have not examined the possibility that chronic administration of minoxidil might cause pulmonary hypertension by some other mechanism, our acute studies suggest that it reduces, rather than increases, pulmonary vascular resistance. Furthermore, there seems to be a species difference in the mode of its action in dogs and cattle.", 
    "55": "Beta adrenergic blockade was studied in vitro with human tracheal muscle strips and guinea pig tracheal chains. It was shown in isolated smooth muscle from both man and guinea pig that the order of potency for the three beta-blocking agents studied was: propranolol greater than sotalol greater than practolol. Under the conditions of this study, propranolol was about 30,000 times and sotalol about 30 times as potent as practolol. The order of potency suggests that the nature of adrenergic blockade induced by practolol on tracheal smooth muscle is only weakly beta2-relative to the blocking effects of propranolol and sotalol. Beta adrenergic blockade by propranolol, sotalol, and practolol produced different degrees of increased histamine lethality in mice. Whereas both propranolol at 0.01 mg/kg and sotalol at 1.0 mg/kg resulted in 100% histamine-induced lethality, practolol at 50 mg/kg resulted in only 50% histamine-induced lethality. These data, when added to those from our previous studies, suggest that the mechanisms responsible for resistance to the effects of histamine in untreated mice are at least partially mediated by the beta2-adrenergic system. Thus, in three different tissues, the blocking activity of practolol was shown to be less than that of sotalol or propranolol.", 
    "56": "Metyrapone, at low doses (0.5-1.0 mM), stimulated the output of both PGE and PGF from the isolated uterus of the pregnant rat determined following extraction of bath fluid, chromatographic separation and bioassay of the prostaglandin. At higher doses (2-4 mM), metyrapone inhibited PGF output, but had no effect on PGE output. Uterine activity was rapidly inhibited by metyrapone in a dose-related manner. This inhibition was not related to PG output as, at 1 mM metyrapone, activity was inhibited and PG output stimulated. Both metyrapone and papaverine produced dose-dependent inhibition of the activity of the isolated rabbit ileum, papaverine being 10 times more potent than metyrapone. Propranolol antagonised the response of the ileum to isoprenaline, but had no effect on the response to metyrapone. These observations confirm earlier data, suggsting that metyrapone exerts a differential effect on uterine PGE and PGF production and indicate that metyrapone has a direct inhibitory effect on smooth muscle activity.", 
    "57": "The canine right atrium was perfused with arterial blood led from a carotid artery of the heparinized support dog and suspended in a bath filled with blood. In 5 non-spontaneously beating preparations, the frequency-force relationship was investigated by electric stimulation at a frequency range from 0.017 to 3 Hz. At a low frequency level, a large peak tension developed. At 0.5 Hz, minimum values of developed tension were obtained. At a range of 0.5-3 Hz, the developed tension increased with the frequency. Higher frequencies than 4 Hz usually caused pulsus alternans. The staircase phenomena were not influenced by treatment with propranolol or atropine. Therefore, there may be no participation of the autonomic nerve stimulation on the frequency-force relationship. Effects of pentobarbital, (+/-)-verapamil and manganese on the frequency-force relationship were investigated with both the blood-perfused, isolated atrium preparations and isolated ventricular preparations. Pentobarbital and manganese chloride produced a uniform depression of the developed tension at all frequencies but the depression with (+/-)-verapamil was greater at higher frequencies in both atrial and ventricular muscles.", 
    "58": "Whether or not pressor responsiveness changes in unanesthetized rats during recurrent sympathetic excitation was determined by recording blood pressure and heart rate continuously while the posterior hypothalamus was stimulated repeatedly with constant currents. Because preliminary tests showed that telestimulation with a radio-controlled stimulator produced erratic responses, awake rats were routinely stimulated in a conventional manner by connecting them through wires to a square-wave stimulator. Although tachycardia was the most common chronotropic effect, bradycardia also occurred, and both responses were occasionally seen in the same rat at different times. Inhibition of chronotropic responses by combined pharmacologic blockage with propranolol and atropine did not affect corresponding pressure responses in normotensive rats. Renal and spontaneously hypertensive rats always had larger pressor responses than normotensive ones, and, in spite of individual variations, responsiveness generally remained unaltered during 3-6 h of repeated hypothalamic stimulation. These results indicate that in awake normotensive or hypertensive rats cardiovascular responses to posterior hypothalamic stimulation continue unabated even when stimulation is repeated for hours.", 
    "59": "The authors report on the effects of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, on 10 patients with pathological panic states. Propranolol was effective in treating acute pathological panic, but modest doses of the drug administered for brief periods of time did not alleviate chronic panic attacks associated with agoraphobia. The drug suppressed panic associated with depressive syndromes but did not affect the depression and had no clear effect on anticipatory anxiety. The authors suggest that further study of these findings may clarify other clinical problems.", 
    "60": "Subtotal thyroidectomy was performed in 40 patients with thyrotoxicosis in whom propranolol alone was used as preparation for surgery. Propranolol was given orally in a dose of 40 mg every 6 h for a mean preoperative period of 17 days (range 4-60 days) and continued for seven days after operation. The mean +/- SE blood loss at operation was only 160 +/- 20 ml. The period of follow-up was from three to nine months. Recurrent thyrotoxicosis has not occurred in any patient. Low levels of total serum triiodothyronine (T3) and total serum thyroxine (T4) were observed in the early postoperative weeks in some patients and were associated with symptoms of mild hypothyroidism, but by six months in the presence of a raised serum thyrotropin (TSH) the thyroid hormone levels returned to normal. Permanent hypothyroidism developed in only two patients. Despite normal or low total serum T3 and T4 levels, the TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was absent in all patients one week after operation. At four weeks and at eight weeks, the response was absent or sub-normal in 70% and 20% of the patients respectively, indicating a delay in the recovery of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis previously exposed to high levels of T3 and T4. It is considered that subtotal thyroidectomy for thyrotoxicosis in patients prepared with propranolol is an acceptable procedure which has some advantages over the conventional preparation with carbimazole and potassium iodide, not the least of which are the potential reduction in preparation time, the more flexible timing of operation, and the reduced operative blood loss.", 
    "61": "1. In a cross-over study between hydrallazine and prazosin in fifteen patients, also treated with the beta-receptor-blocking agent propranolol, 1 mg of prazosin was found to be equipotent with 30 mg of hydrallazine. 2. All patients were known to tolerate dydrallazine. In one patient prazosin treatment was discontinued because of severe headache. In four patients minor, non-persistent initial side effects were found. These might have been avoided by using a smaller starting dose. One patient fainted on the second day of prazosin treatment, probably from a micturition syncope. 3. Prazosin may be used as an alternative to hydrallazine. 4. The final status of prazosin as an anti-hypertensive drug is uncertain.20", 
    "62": "1. A within-patient comparison showed that bethanidine, methyldopa and propranolol produced similar control of the blood pressure. 2. Unlike bethanidine, propranolol did not produce postural and exercise hypotension; methyldopa was intermediate in effect. 3. Overall side effects were of a similar incidence though there were differences in incidence of particular side effects.", 
    "63": "The pilot phase of the British multicentre randomized controlled trial of treatment for mild hypertension has shown: (1) that unselected subjects, aged 35-64 years, with mild hypertension are willing to enter and remain in a long-term trial even though asymptomatic; (2) that the differences of mean systolic and mean diastolic pressure achieved between treated and control subjects is sufficient to produce the expected difference in terminating events with the 18000 patients calculated as needed for the full-scale trial; (3) that side effects with the two selected active primary regimens (bendrofluazide and propranolol) are common but mild (no serious side effects or toxic reactions have been reported); (4) that the work load imposed by the trial, though considerable during screening and the initiation of patients into the trial, can largely be taken by specially trained nursing staff, and when screening is completed the trial does not impose a heavy burden of follow-up examinations; (5) that there are no adverse psychological effects caused by alerting asymptomatic people to their raised pressure and enrolling them into a prolonged programme of clinical attendance; (6) that the total costs of carrying out a full-scale trial--estimated at about lb.2m ($U.S. 4m)--are commensurate with the potential annual savings in health service expenditure whether the trial shows treatment to be effective or unwarranted.", 
    "64": "1. Serial measurements of plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PA) and blood pressure were performed overnight in patients with borderline (group 1) and sustained essential hypertension (group 2) before and after acute and chronic administration of either propranolol or pindolol. 2. Group 1 patients exhibited a typical rhythm of recumbent PRA with low values before midnight and large increases early in the morning. 3. In contrast, no rhythm and very low PRA values were observed in patients of group 2. Blood pressure was higher in group 2 than in group 1. There was a significant correlation between the hyporeninaemic and hypotensive effect of either acute (r = 0-79) or chronic (r = 0.4) beta-receptor blockade. 4. In group 1, after beta-receptor blockade the day-night profile of renin was similar to that observed in group 2 before treatment. Thus, in this latter subgroup, low-renin profiles might reflect reduced beta-adrenoreceptor activity. 5. Plasma aldosterone was lower in group 2 but appeared to be inappropriately high relative to renin. 6. The data suggest that in hypertensive patients classified according to their blood pressure and recumbent PRA profiles a significant relationship exists between changes in PRA and arterial pressure. Thus patients with high PRA respond better to treatment than patients with low renin. We conclude that in the patients studied sympathetic nervous system activity mainly determined renin values as well as anti-hypertensive effectiveness of the beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "65": "1. The effects of timolol alone and in combination with a fixed dose of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride have been studied in a double-blind, controlled study in fifty-four patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. 2. After a 4 weeks placebo period patients were randomly assigned to enter groups receiving timolol alone (group A), hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride (group B) or timolol + hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride (group C). Each treatment was carried out for 6 weeks. 3. The use of timolol (10 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) and amiloride (2-5 mg) in a combination tablet given twice daily gave better control of blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension than did equivalent dosages of timolol alone or of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. 4. Clinical and laboratory side effects were minimal.", 
    "66": "1. The beta1-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent atenolol was studied in the treatment of twelve out-patients with essential hypertension. 2. With a mean dose of 110 mg of atenolol daily (range 75-200 mg/day) we observed a pronounced decrease in blood pressure. 3. Only minimal side effects were seen. 4. Cardiac output decreased from 4-6 to 3-4 l/min during treatment. This decrease did not correlate with the decrease in blood pressure but correlated well with the changes in calculated total peripheral resistance.", 
    "67": "1. A double-blind cross-over evaluation of the anti-hypertensive effect of metoprolol vs placebo was carried out in a series of twenty-three patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension who were receiving 25 mg of chlorthalidone daily as their basic treatment. An individually determined dose of metoprolol (75-300 mg) was used. 2. Metoprolol, as compared with placebo, produced a statistically significant reduction of blood pressure, both in supine and standing positions. 3. During the double-blind cross-over study mild side effects were more common at the beginning of metoprolol/chlorthalidone treatment than during placebo/chlorthalidone, but these tended to diminish or disappear with time. 4. Metoprolol in combination with chlorathalidone appears to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for mild and moderate hypertension in patients not responding to chlorthalidone alone.", 
    "68": "1. The anti-hypertensive actions of timolol and hydrochlorothiazide were analysed in a double-blind 2 x 2 factorial trial in twenty patients with essential hypertension. Each patient went through four phases of 8 weeks in randomized order, receiving timolol alone, hydrochlorothiazide alone, timolol plus hydrochlorothiazide, and placebo. 2. Supine mean arterial pressure fell from 119 mmHg in the placebo phase, to 110 mmHg during the thiazide phase, 106 mmHg during the timolol phase, and to 101 mmHg during the combined timolol plus hydrochlorothiazide phase. 3. Factorial analysis revealed that the hypotensive actions of the beta-receptor-blocking drug and the diuretic were additive, without any synergism or antagonism. 4. Plasma renin activity measured in ng 3 h-1 ml-1 rose from 5-02 in the placebo phase to 9-54 in the diuretic phase, but fell to 1-79 in the beta-receptor blockade. It was unchanged in the combined therapy phase, despite the greater drop in blood pressure. These results suggest that the fall in plasma renin activity during beta-receptor blockade is of little importance in the hypotensive action of beta-receptor-blocking drugs.", 
    "69": "1. Atenolol (ICI 66.082, Tenormin) is a new beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent, devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane-stabilizing properties. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier. 2. Atenolol given to hypertensive patients in initial open trials reduced arterial blood pressure significantly. 3. A double-blind comparison between atenolol and placebo in forty-five patients with essential hypertension demonstrated that atenolol gave a statistically significant reduction of blood pressure (delta 28/15 mmHg, P less than 0-005). 4. The optimum anti-hypertensive dose of atenolol in patients with mild to moderately severe essential hypertension was 200 mg daily. 5. Atenolol was compared with propranolol in thirty patients with essential hypertension. No statistically significant differences of anti-hypertensive effect were observed between the two drugs. 6. Long-term results (up to 2 years) in 117 hypertensive patients indicate that drug tolerance is good. No serious toxic effects were observed. 7. In four of twelve hypertensive patients with obstructive airways disease atenolol had to be withdrawn owing to deterioration of ventilatory function.", 
    "70": "1. The interaction of phentolamine with the beta-receptor blocker oxprenolol was studied in a controlled trial. 2. The combination was generally well tolerated. 3. Oxprenolol alone produced modest but significant reductions in supine, standing and post-exercise blood pressures. Small reductions were seen only with sustained phentolamine administration. 4. The combined effect of the two drugs appeared to be additive only at the lower doses of oxprenolol. 5. Labetalol produced significantly greater reductions in supine and standing blood pressure than combined oxprenolol-phentolamine. At a daily dose of 400 mg, postural hypotension was not seen, though transient symptoms were frequent.", 
    "71": "1. The anti-hypertensive effect of atenolol was greater than that of bendrofluazide. 2. The change in systolic blood pressure caused by bendrofluazide showed a significant inverse correlation iwth the plasma renin concentration (r=-0-47; P less than 0-01). 3. The correlation between the change in systolic blood pressure caused by atenolol and the plasma renin concentration was not significant (r =0-28; 0-1 greater than P greater than 0-05). 4. Plasma renin concentration was unaffected by atenolol.", 
    "72": "Sotalol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent devoid of intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity and local anaesthetic properties, was assessed in a double-blind cross-over study for the symptomatic treatment of 10 patients with thyrotoxicosis. The heart rate and clinical thyrotoxicosis index were significantly lower than with the placebo or with no treatment. The values of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine in the serum did not change. Because of its pure beta-adrenergic blocking effect, sotalol is suitable for the symptomatic treatment of thyrotoxicosis.", 
    "73": "The effectiveness of metoprolol in relieving angina pectoris was compared with that of propranolol at equipotent dosages in a series of 20 patients. Before double-blind periods propranolol was given in gradually increased dosages to obtain a maximal effect for each individual patient. The responses were monitored using subjective assessment based on attack rate and nitroglycerin consumption, as well as objective maximal exercise testing. Both compounds significantly increased the exercise tolerance on a bicycle ergometer, and relieved angina as assessed subjectively. No significant differences were found between the responses to metoprolol and propranolol. The mean increase in exercise tolerance amounted to 36% with metoprolol. Biochemical monitoring revealed no harmful effects. Two cases of rebound phenomenon were observed at the transition from metoprolol to placebo. It was concluded that metoprolol is a useful new cardio-selective beta-blocking compound equipotent to propranolol in the treatment of angina pectoris.", 
    "74": "Thirty patients with thyrotoxicosis were randomly divided into 3 groups of ten which were treated for 8 weeks with either practolol, propranolol or placebo. The pills were administered in a double blind manner and the investigator had the option of doubling the dose at each visit. Propranolol and practolol were equally effective, and better than placebo, at relieving the patients general well-being as well as the tachycardia, subjective and objective tremor, skin warmness and moistness and the intensity of the thyroid bruit.", 
    "75": "1. Seven healthy sodium-replete male volunteer subjects remained supine during and for at least 1 h before the study. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded continuously, and peripheral venous blood samples were taken every 15 min for determinations of plasma renin activity. 2. All subjects were studied twice: after 3 days of oral practolol (100 mg, three times daily) and after a similar period on placebo. Each study consisted of an intravenous infusion of isoprenaline in graded doses (0-20 microng/min in the placebo phase; 0-16 microng/min in the practolol phase), followed after rest for 2 h by an intravenous infusion of salbutamol (0-20 microng/min after placebo; 0-80 microng/min after practolol). 3. Both salbutamol and isoprenaline produced dose-related increases in systolic blood pressure, heart rate and plasma renin activity and decreases in diastolic pressure. 4. The increases in heart rate and plasma renin activity induced by either agonist were competitively blocked by practolol, as was the fall in diastolic blood pressure induced by isoprenaline; the salbutamol-induced fall of diastolic blood pressure was unaffected by practolol. 5. Comparison of dose ratio--1 estimates confirmed that practolol selectively blocked increases in heart rate and plasma renin activity due to salbutamol; no selective blockade against isoprenaline-induced changes was shown. 6. Selective blockade of salbutamol-induced changes indicate that a beta1-adrenoreceptor mediates changes in plasma renin activity.", 
    "76": "An indirect method for obtaining a reliable measure of the rate of glucose transport into adipocytes is described. Evidence is presented that altered levels of 3':5'-cyclic AMP can influence the transport of glucose into adipocytes. When cyclic AMP levels were lowered with antilipolytic agents (insulin, nicotinic acid, or clofibrate), rates of glucose transport were increased. In contrast, when adipose tissue levels of cyclic AMP were elevated by lipolytic hormones or theophylline, glucose transport when cyclic AMP levels were elevated by lipolytic agents. Agents that can raise cyclic AMP but inhibit lipolytic (procaine, amitryptyline, and phenylethylbiguanide) reduced the rate of glucose transport. Other data are presented that are consistent with the conclusion that cyclic AMP inhibits glucose transport into adipocytes.", 
    "77": "The increase in aldosterone and plasma renin activity (PRA) observed after stimulation of extrahypothalamic sites within the brain of the rhesus monkey was prevented by the prior administration of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol. alpha-Adrenergic blockade by phentolamine had no inhibiting effect. Propranolol only partially reduced the response of aldosterone to lateral hypothalamic stimulation in spite of inhibition of PRA; a partial reduction in aldosterone was also obtained from this site after dexamethasone treatment without any effect on PRA. It was concluded that the increase in aldosterone observed after extra-hypothalamic stimulation was mediated mainly through the renin-angiotensin mechanism whereas in the case of the hypothalamus, release of ACTH was also a contributory factor.", 
    "78": "The contractile responses of the rat detrusor muscle to noradrenaline were increased 2-3 weeks after partial denervation but had returned to control values 6-9 weeks after the denervation, probably because of reinnervation of denervated muscle cells. 6-9 weeks after partial denervation the excitatory alpha-adrenoceptor mediated response to stimulation of the remaining intact nerves was predominant, masking the subsequent inhibitory beta-receptor response, which at this time was seen only after alpha-receptor blockade. The possibility of an outgrowth of adrenergic fibres activating alpha-receptors in muscle cells normally not innervated by adrenergic nerves is discussed.", 
    "79": "1 Aminophylline and other methylxanthines increase brain tryptophan and hence 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover. The mechanism of this effect of aminophylline was investigated. 2 At lower doses (greater than 100 mg/kg i.p.) the brain tryptophan increase could be explained by the lipolytic action of the drug, i.e. increased plasma unesterified fatty acid freeing plasma tryptophan from protein binding so that it became available to the brain. 3 Plasma unesterified fatty acid did not increase when aminophylline (109 mg/kg i.p.) was given to nicotinamide-treated rats but as both plasma total and free tryptophan rose, a tryptophan increase in the brain still occurred. 4 The rise in brain tryptophan concentration following the injection of a higher dose of the drug (150 mg/kg i.p.) could no longer be explained by a rise of plasma free tryptophan as the ratio of brain tryptophan to plasma free tryptophan rose considerably. Plasma total tryptophan fell and the plasma insulin concentration rose. 5 The increase of brain tryptophan concentration after injection of 150 mg/kg aminophylline appeared specific for this amino acid as brain tyrosine and phenyllanine did not increase. However as their plasma concentrations fell the brain/plasma ratio for all three amino acids rose. 6 The higher dose of aminophylline increased the muscle concentration of tryptophan but that of tyrosine fell and that of phenylalanine remained unaltered. The liver concentrations were not affected. 7 The aminophylline-induced increase of the ratio of brain tryptophan of plasma free tryptophan no longer occurred when the drug was given to animals injected with the beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent propranolol or the diabetogenic agent streptozotocin. 8 The changes in brain tryptophan upon aminophylline injection may be explained by (a) increased availability of plasma tryptophan to the brain due to increased lipolysis and (b) increased effectiveness of uptake of tryptophan by the brain due to increased insulin secretion.", 
    "80": "The thickness of the left ventricular free wall and internal chamber diameter were continuously measured by pairs of ultrasonic crystals together with left ventricular pressure in normal conscious dogs. During the resting state, wall thickness decreased abruptly with the onset of atrial contraction from 10.5 mm to an average end-diastolic valueof9.8 mm. In contrast to most previous studies, there was no change in wall thickness during isovolumic systole, and with ejection the wall thickened by 31.3 percent of end-diastolic wall thickness. Atrial pacing, phenylephrine, isoproterenol and propranolol produced significant changes in chamber size with reciprocal changes in wall thickness. In addition, changes in the extent and velocity of left ventricular chamber shortening in the minor equator were associated with comparable reciprocal changes in the extent and velocity of free wall thickening (correlation coefficients 0.97 to 0.99). During acute coronary occlusion, progressive reductions in the extent and velocity of regional wall shortening with partial ischemia were associated with comparable changes in systolic wall thickening characteristics (r = 0.96 and 0.95), and holosystolic elongation in fully ischemic areas was associated with holosystolic wall thinning. During chronic pressure overload, despite wall thickening, the relation between chamber shortening and wall thickening were retained and direct computation of dynamic wall stress variations was possible. These measurements allowed precise definition of the dynamics of the left ventricular wall during normal and abnormal cardiac states. The demonstration that in the absence of regional dysfunction analysis of wall thickness in a single region of ventricular free wall can be used to describe myocardial and overall left ventricular function, as well as regional function in the presence of ischemia, constitutes a new approach to the assessment of cardiac function that has potential for echocardiographic applications.", 
    "81": "VO2 max, maximum oxygen uptake, has been measured in 4 normal young men, before and after beta-adrenergic blockade (0.5 to 5 mg Pindolol by mouth). Pindolol induces bradycardia and reduces VO2 max. A statistically significant positive correlation appears between posology of Pindolol and bradycardia, this posology and reduction of VO2 max, and finally between bradycardia and reduction of VO2 max. These correlations indicate that the reduction of VO2 max is best explained by a circulatory limitation of oxygen supply to active muscles.", 
    "82": "Nineteen patients with ischemic heart disease were randomized into two groups and received either metoprolol or H 87/07. Heart catheterization was performed, and the groups were studied at rest and during exercise--before and after intravenous drug administration. During work metoprolol gave a statistically significant reduction in left ventricular work (expressed as pressure-rate product) of about 20%, mainly depending on a reduction in heart rate. Cardiac output decreased by 21%. Stroke volume was almost unchanged. The abnormal increase in left ventricular filling pressure during work was slightly, but not significantly, reduced by the drug. For H 87/07 no significant changes were found in the corresponding variables. This seems, however, to depend on an inadequate dosage, since not even the heart rate during work was significantly reduced. In conclusion, in the doses used metoprolol has been shown to be a potent beta-adrenoceptive antagonist in contrast to H 87/07.", 
    "83": "1. Nine men aged 20-33 years with essential hypertension measured their own blood pressure at home, lying and standing, three times daily, under conditions of everyday living. The last 14 days' readings (eighty-four observations) from control and treatment periods of at least 4 weeks' duration were used to calculate mean pressures. 2. In eight patients, propranolol (40 mg thrice daily with meals) significantly lowered \"mean blood pressure\" (diastolic+1/3[systolic-diastolic]) but methyclothiazide (5 mg with breakfast) did not. In five subjects, prindolol (5 mg thrice daily with meals) significantly lowered \"mean blood pressure\" but methyclothiazide (5 mg with breakfast) did not. 3. In six subjects there was no significant difference between \"mean blood pressure\" when taking propranolol doses 120 mg with breakfast, 60 mg with breakfast and with the evening meal, and 40 mg with each meal. In five subjects there was no significant difference between \"mean blood pressure\" when taking metoprolol 200 mg with breakfast and 100 mg with breakfast and with the evening meal. In four subjects there was no significant difference between \"mean blood pressure\" when taking prindolol 30 mg with breakfast, 15 mg with breakfast and with the evening meal, and 10 mg with each meal. 4. In young males with essential hypertension, beta-adrenoreceptor blockers were more effective than a thiazide diuretic in lowering blood pressure, and were effective in a single daily dose."
