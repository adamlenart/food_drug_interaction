    "0": "Twenty-eight genetically obese and 24 lean barrows (65.0 and 68.7 kg average BW, respectively) were allotted within genotype to a 16% CP corn-soybean meal basal diet or this basal diet + 20 ppm ractopamine (a phenethanolamine beta-adrenergic agonist) and allowed ad libitum access to feed for 48 d. Compared to lean pigs, obese pigs had lower ADG, gain to feed ratio, longissimus muscle area, predicted amount of muscle, and weights of trimmed loin and ham, ham lean, heart, spleen, kidney and gastrointestinal tract (P less than .05). Obese pigs also had shorter carcass but higher dressing percentage, backfat thickness, fat depth, fat area, untrimmed loin weight and fasting plasma urea N concentration (P less than .05). Dietary supplementation with 20 ppm ractopamine reduced daily feed intake and improved gain to feed ratio in both lean and obese pigs (P less than .05). Pigs fed ractopamine had shorter carcasses, less fat depth and fat area, smaller weights of stomach and colon plus rectum, but higher dressing percentages, longissimus muscle areas, weights of trimmed Boston butts, picnics and loins, ham lean and predicted amounts of muscle than pigs not fed ractopamine (P less than .05). Supplemental ractopamine had no effect on fasting plasma concentrations of urea N, nonesterified fatty acids, triglyceride or glucose (P greater than .05). No genotype x ractopamine interactions for the criteria described above were detected (P greater than .05). These results suggest that ractopamine will improve the efficiency of feed utilization and carcass leanness in swine with different propensities for body fat deposition.", 
    "1": "The effect of dietary ractopamine and protein level on growth performance, individual muscle weight and carcass composition of finishing pigs were evaluated in two experiments. Twelve barrows and 12 gilts (Exp. 1) and 32 barrows (Exp. 2) with an average initial weight of 64 kg were penned individually and offered ractopamine at 0 or 20 ppm in diets containing 13 or 17% CP in 2 x 2 factorial experiments for 28 d. In both experiments, dietary ractopamine improved daily gain (P less than .1) and gain-to-feed ratio (P less than .05) at 17% dietary protein level but depressed these response criteria at 13% protein level. Leaf fat was reduced (P less than .05) and longissimus muscle depth was increased (P less than .1) by feeding ractopamine regardless of dietary CP concentration. Longissimus, psoas major, semitendinosus, biceps and quadriceps femoris (P less than .05) and tensor facia latae (P less than .1) muscles were 8 to 22% heavier with ractopamine feeding at 17% dietary CP level. Results from both trials suggest that ractopamine improves growth rate and carcass leanness at the higher dietary protein level but improves only carcass leanness at the lower protein level.", 
    "2": "Six trials involving 888 pigs (Study 1) and three trials involving 360 pigs (Study 2) were conducted at various geographical locations in the U.S. and Canada to evaluate the effect of ractopamine hydrochloride on the performance and carcass characteristics of finishing swine. All trials were conducted using a randomized complete block design. Trial data were pooled within study for statistical analysis. Pigs averaged approximately 64.5 kg (Study 1) and 65.9 kg (Study 2) initially and had ad libitum access to a 16% crude protein corn-soybean meal or barley-soybean meal diet. Ractopamine was included in the diet at 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 or 30 ppm (Study 1), or at 0, 5, 10, 15 or 20 ppm (Study 2); diets were fed for an average of 45 d (Study 1) and 50 d (Study 2) to a final weight of about 104.3 kg (Study 1) and 106.6 kg (Study 2). Carcass dissection data were collected in three of the six trials in Study 1 (0, 5 and 20 ppm ractopamine) and in all three trials in Study 2 (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 ppm ractopamine). All ractopamine levels improved (P less than .05) ADG and feed: gain (Studies 1 and 2) above those of control pigs. Ractopamine levels of 10 to 30 ppm (Studies 1 and 2) improved (P less than .05) dressing percentage over controls. Pigs fed ractopamine at 5 and 20 ppm (Study 1) and 10, 15 and 20 ppm (Study 2) had increased (P less than .05) dissected leanness compared with controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "An automated drug delivery system that provides closed-loop feedback control of the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation is described. The control system was designed using a mathematical model of the effect of esmolol infusion in the ventricular rate. The model was developed in system identification experiments with anesthetized dogs in which atrial fibrillation was induced and maintained by rapid atrial pacing. A control system of variable structure, which incorporates a transient controller and a regulator, was designed to perform satisfactorily over a wide range of subject responses to drug infusion. The transient controller brings the ventricular rate to the setpoint with little overshoot. When the ventricular rate is near the setpoint, the drug infusion rate is calculated by the regulator. The drug infusion rate is constrained to ensure smooth transitions in the hemodynamic state of the patient and for safety. Feasibility of the system was demonstrated in computer simulations and animal experiments.", 
    "4": "A patient with tardive neuroleptic-induced akathisia was investigated with multiple pharmacological challenges. It was noted that the patient responded positively to benztropine, bromocriptine, and propranolol, and negatively to physostigmine, and showed little or no response to discontinuation of neuroleptics and challenges with metoclopramide, metoprolol, atenolol, and clonidine. The implications of this pharmacological characterization for the understanding of the pathophysiology of tardive akathisia in relation to acute akathisia and tardive dyskinesia are discussed.", 
    "5": "Beta-adrenergic receptors were localized and quantified with autoradiographic methods in frozen sections of eyes of albino rabbits using [125I]cyanopindolol and [3H]dihydroalprenolol. Quantification in albino rabbits revealed highest beta 2-adrenoceptor densities in the ciliary body, the corneal epithelium and the corneal endothelium. Moreover, the iris showed significant amounts of specific binding, whereas the retina and sclera are nearly free of these receptors.", 
    "6": "Using records of the Saskatchewan Prescription Drug Plan, we determined the incidence of antidepressant use (a marker for depressive symptoms) in patients who received beta-blockers or other treatments for chronic diseases (diuretics, antihypertensives, and hypoglycemics) during 1984, but not in the previous 6 months. Antidepressants initiated within 12 months after the study drug were counted. Of the 3218 new beta-blocker users, 6.4% received concurrent prescriptions (ie, within 34 days) for an antidepressant and beta-blocker. Only 2.8% of the reference group (no study drug use) received an antidepressant. A greater proportion of patients prescribed propranolol (9.5%) received an antidepressant than those prescribed other \"lipophilic\" (3.9%) or \"hydrophilic\" (2.5%) beta-blockers. Incidence ratios for propranolol revealed the overall risk antidepressant use was 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 5.5) times that of the reference group and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.7 to 2.5) times that of all other study drug users. For propranolol, relative risk of antidepressant use (drug/reference group) varied with age and was greatest in the 20- to 39-year-old group (17.2; 95% CI, 13.7 to 21.5).", 
    "7": "To test the possibility that catecholamines have an influence on the function of the endolymphatic sac (ES), which is known to absorb the endolymph, the effect of catecholamines on the ES direct current potential (ESP) was examined in the guinea pig. The ESP was recorded extradurally by the posterior occipital approach. Isoproterenol (Iso), epinephrine (Epi), and norepinephrine (NE) were administered intravenously for 4 min using an infusion pump. Catecholamines reversibly depressed the ESP with the rank order of potency Iso greater than Epi greater than NE. The threshold doses were 0.021, 0.27, and 1.94 micrograms/kg for Iso, Epi, and NE, respectively. beta-Antagonist (propranolol) blocked the action of catecholamines on the ESP but alpha-antagonist (phentolamine) did not. This indicates that beta-adrenergic action induces the ESP change. This study implies that catecholamines may regulate the function of the ES.", 
    "8": "The principal difficulty in determining the subtype of coronary vascular beta-receptors in vivo is to avoid the local metabolic coronary vasodilation that occurs secondary to activation of myocardial beta-receptors. Therefore, a nonbeating cardiac preparation without chronotropic or inotropic effects is needed. In this study, the coronary circulation was perfused at constant pressure in closed-chest chloralose-anesthetized dogs. The increase in coronary blood flow due to intracoronary injections of the combined beta 1- and beta 2-agonist isoproterenol was determined during prolonged asystoles after the cessation of cardiac pacing in atrioventricular heart-blocked animals. Both beta 1-selective (practolol and L 650,744) and beta 2-selective (ICI 118,551) antagonists blocked isoproterenol-induced coronary vasodilation. In contrast, isoproterenol vasodilation in the femoral circulation was blocked by beta 2- but not by beta 1-selective antagonists. In conclusion, both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors in coronary resistance vessels are stimulated by isoproterenol to produce vasodilation during prolonged asystoles, when cardiac chronotropic and inotropic effects are absent.", 
    "9": "We describe here further observations on a novel motor phenomenon that can be recorded regularly from the canine ileum in the late postprandial period, i.e., when residue of a meal reaches the distal small bowel. We reported before that this unique pattern of motility consisted of intraluminal pressure waves at a frequency (20-24/min) much greater than that of the ileal slow wave. In the current experiments, we document that these intraluminal pressure waves coincide with contraction of the circular muscle layer, as recorded from serosal strain gauges. However, the cellular origin and propagation of these contractile events are still unclear. By studying dogs with ileal loops and those with an intact bowel, we conclude that this is a local response of the ileum to the arrival of nutrients in its lumen and that it is under cholinergic control. This report supports the concept that the ileum may be particularly sensitive to its local intraluminal environment.", 
    "10": "Therapeutic efficacy is often studied with observational surveys of patients whose treatments were selected nonexperimentally. The results of these surveys are distrusted because of the fear that biased results occur in the absence of experimental principles, particularly randomization. The purpose of the current study was to develop and validate improved observational study designs by incorporating many of the design principles and patient assembly procedures of the randomized trial. The specific topic investigated was the prophylactic effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy after an acute myocardial infarction. To accomplish the research objective, three sets of data were compared. First, we developed a restricted cohort based on the eligibility criteria of the randomized clinical trial; second, we assembled an expanded cohort using the same design principles except for not restricting patient eligibility; and third, we used the data from the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT), whose results served as the gold standard for comparison. In this research, the treatment difference in death rates for the restricted cohort and the BHAT trial was nearly identical. In contrast, the expanded cohort had a larger treatment difference than was observed in the BHAT trial. We also noted the important and largely neglected role that eligibility criteria may play in ensuring the validity of treatment comparisons and study outcomes. The new methodologic strategies we developed may improve the quality of observational studies and may be useful in assessing the efficacy of the many medical/surgical therapies that cannot be tested with randomized clinical trials.", 
    "11": "Although the stepped-care approach remains the cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy, the patient's profile must also be considered. Important issues include the patient's age, race and activity level, potential for hypertensive complications, presence of other diseases, cost of medications and probability of adherence to the recommended drug regimen. Nonpharmacologic treatment based on lifestyle changes is a useful adjunct to drug therapy, but it is not sufficient to control hypertension in most patients. Selection of pharmacologic therapy must be based on a knowledge of each drug's mode of action and side effects, as well as the characteristics of special patient populations.", 
    "12": "Recently, it was suggested that long-term administration of an inhaled beta 2-agonist might increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to histamine, possibly as a consequence of subsensitization to the inhaled beta 2-agonist. To test this hypothesis, we studied two groups of patients with asthma or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An experimental group of 15 patients, inhaling 400 micrograms of salbutamol four times daily during 1 year and subsequently 40 micrograms of ipratropium bromide four times daily for 6 months, and a control group, consisting of 22 patients with the opposite treatment regimen. The BHR, the response in FEV1 to cumulative doses of salbutamol, and the number of beta 2-adrenoceptors and antagonist affinity of these receptors on circulating lymphocytes were assessed at the start of the study and at 6-month intervals for 1 1/2 years. The BHR increased significantly (p = 0.001) during the year salbutamol was inhaled and returned to about the value at the start of the study after inhaling ipratropium bromide for 6 months. No change occurred in the bronchodilating responses to cumulative doses of salbutamol, nor was any change observed in the number and the affinity of beta 2-adrenoceptors on lymphocytes. It was concluded that long-term use of salbutamol caused a small but significant increase in BHR. The increase in BHR was not caused by subsensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptors to salbutamol.", 
    "13": "Impaired function of the adrenergic-receptor system has been postulated to contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. Using the dorsal hand-vein compliance technique, we compared the changes in diameter of superficial hand veins in response to phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, and to isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, in 14 untreated patients with allergic asthma and in 16 nonatopic control subjects. There were no significant differences in the median effective dose of phenylephrine that produced 50% of maximal venoconstriction (ED50) or in the maximal response (Emax) between the two groups. Bronchial hyperreactivity (assessed by methacholine-challenge tests) in the patients with asthma was uncorrelated with the ED50 or Emax of isoproterenol. These results demonstrate no evidence for a generalized change in alpha- or beta-adrenergic responsiveness on smooth muscle cells in asthma. Hand-vein responsiveness to isoproterenol was unchanged after treatment for 7 days with oral terbutaline (5 mg three times per day). Thus, unlike leukocytes, smooth muscle appears not readily susceptible to beta-adrenoceptor desensitization in vivo. Local infusions of prednisolone or dexamethasone during 2 hours and systemic administration of dexamethasone (24 hours) caused a significant fall in the Emax for isoproterenol. The mechanism of attenuation of beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness by corticosteroids remains to be determined.", 
    "14": "Immunosympathectomy produced by treatment of newborn rats with antibodies to nerve growth factor (NGF) delays ovarian development and disrupts estrous cyclicity. While these alterations have been ascribed to loss of sympathetic neurons innervating the ovary, the treatment also causes partial loss of ovarian sensory innervation. The present experiments were undertaken to determine if selective interference with ovarian noradrenergic/sympathetic action would result in alterations of ovarian development similar to those caused by NGF antibodies (NGF Ab). We have used two approaches to disrupt catecholamine action on ovarian cells: 1) inhibition of beta-adrenoreceptors by local delivery of receptor blockers to the ovaries of juvenile rats; and 2) elimination of the sympathetic innervation by long term postnatal treatment with guanethidine (GD), an adrenergic neuron blocking agent. When GD is administered chronically it produces an autoimmune-mediated destruction of peripheral sympathetic nerves, without affecting cholinergic or sensory neurons. Of the receptor blockers tested, FM-24, a nonreversible antagonist, resulted in a sustained 70% decrease in available receptors throughout the 10-day period studied. In spite of this, the timing of puberty, assessed by the age at vaginal opening and first ovulation, was not delayed, suggesting that activation of the remaining receptors by an intact innervation suffices to maintain a normal noradrenergic influence. GD treatment initiated at the end of the first week of postnatal life and maintained for three weeks slowed the juvenile-peripubertal rate of body growth, delayed the time of vaginal opening and first ovulation, and disrupted subsequent estrous cyclicity, but did not affect the animals' fertility. The ovaries of GD-treated rats exhibited a striking loss of sympathetic (norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y) nerves but a normal sensory innervation (represented by fibers containing calcitonin gene-related peptide). The concentration of beta-adrenoreceptors in granulosa cells was reduced, suggesting follicular immaturity. Direct assessment of this inference by morphometric analysis of the ovaries revealed that follicular development was retarded. The progesterone and estrogen response of juvenile ovaries to gonadotropins in vitro were also reduced. At this time, circulating LH levels were slightly decreased, but neither LHRH content in the median eminence nor the LHRH response to prostaglandin E2 in vitro were affected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "15": "To guide the choice of medical versus surgical therapy for patients with descending (type B) aortic dissection (tear in the descending aorta without involvement of the ascending aorta), multivariate survival analysis was applied to 136 patients admitted to two medical centers between 1975 and 1988 with acute (n = 89) or chronic (n = 47) descending dissection: group 1, all 136 patients; group 2, 106 patients without rupture, pulse loss, or visceral organ compromise; and group 3, 56 patients from group 2 without major cardiac or renal disease (23 surgical and 33 medical). Group 3 medical and surgical subgroups were well matched for baseline characteristics and were potential candidates for either mode of therapy. By Cox model analysis, significant predictors of mortality were pleural rupture, other dissection complications, increasing age, and cardiac disease (all p less than 0.01). Surgical versus medical therapy was not an independent determinant of survival in any of the three groups for acute or chronic dissection. Survival probabilities for all group 3 patients at 1, 5, and 10 years were 0.94, 0.87, and 0.32 (medical) and 0.90, 0.80, and 0.50 (surgical). Despite the limitations of this retrospective study (including the possibility of undefined treatment selection biases), these data suggest that medical or early surgical therapy is associated with equivalent outcome in selected patients with uncomplicated acute or chronic descending aortic dissection.", 
    "16": "Quality of life indexes were assessed in 780 patients 10 years after randomization to medical therapy (n = 390) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (n = 390) in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study. At 10 years, mortality was 21.8% in the medical group and 19.2% in the surgical group (p = NS), and 144 (37%) of the medical group had undergone surgery because of increasing chest pain. At study entry, 22% of medical and surgical patients were angina free; at 1 and 5 years after entry, the frequency of asymptomatic patients was 66% and 63% in the surgical group and 30% and 38% in the medical group. However, by 10 years after entry, the proportion of patients free of angina had fallen to 47% in the surgical group and to 42% in the medical group. Activity limitation and use of beta-blockers and long-acting nitrates were less in the surgical than the medical group at 1 and 5 years after entry but little different from the medical group at 10 years after entry. Throughout follow-up, recreational status, employment status, frequency of heart failure, use of other medications, and hospitalization frequency were similar between the two groups. Thus, indexes of quality of life such as angina relief, increased activity, and reduction in use of antianginal medications initially appear superior in patients with stable manifestations of ischemic heart disease assigned to surgery, but by 10 years after entry, these advantages are much less apparent. Although the observed similarities of the medically and surgically assigned groups at 10 years reflect return of symptoms in the surgical group to some extent, a more important explanation is the performance of late surgery in a large proportion of the medically assigned patients, rendering them asymptomatic.", 
    "17": "Despite considerable interest in the use of beta-blocking agents in congestive heart failure (CHF), their clinical application is limited because of their negative inotropic effects. Beta blockers with vasodilating properties may have the advantage of overcoming this, however. Carvedilol, a beta-blocking agent with vasodilating properties, was evaluated in 17 patients with chronic CHF secondary to ischemic heart disease with a resting left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 45%, who were being maintained on diuretics. Exercise testing, radionuclide ventriculography, and right-sided cardiac catheterization were performed and intraarterial blood pressure measured before and after 8 weeks of carvedilol therapy in a dosage of 12.5 to 50.0 mg twice a day. Twelve patients completed the study and 5 withdrew. Symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement was demonstrated in 11 of the 12 patients. Heart rate and intraarterial blood pressure were both reduced by chronic therapy. Mean +/- standard deviation exercise time improved from 4.3 +/- 1.6 to 7.1 +/- 2.7 minutes (p less than 0.0001), as did resting left ventricular ejection fraction, from 27 +/- 9 to 31 +/- 11% (p less than 0.02). Pulmonary arterial wedge pressure fell from 19 +/- 7 mm Hg to 12 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and total systemic vascular resistance from 1,752 +/- 403 to 1,497 +/- 310 dynes/s/cm-5/m2 (p less than 0.02). Stroke volume index improved also, from 31 +/- 6 ml to 40 +/- 6 ml (p less than 0.0005). These hemodynamic changes were mediated partly by vasodilation, diminished myocardial oxygen demand and reduction of sympathetic overactivity in the failing heart. These data suggest that carvedilol may have beneficial effects in patients with chronic CHF secondary to coronary artery disease.", 
    "18": "The effects of dilevalol on vascular adrenoceptors were investigated using helical strips of cat arteries. In coronary arteries partially pre-contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), the concentration-relaxant response curves for isoproterenol were shifted to the right by dilevalol with a potency similar to that of propranolol, although dilevalol itself did not relax the arteries. Contractions induced by norepinephrine of mesenteric arteries were attenuated by low concentrations of prazosin but were not influenced by yohimbine of up to 10(-8) M. In contrast, the norepinephrine-induced contractions of middle cerebral arteries were attenuated by yohimbine but only slightly attenuated by prazosin. With mesenteric arteries, treatment with dilevalol (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) attenuated the contractions induced by norepinephrine and phenylephrine in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, contractions induced by norepinephrine and clonidine in middle cerebral arteries were not attenuated by treatment with dilevalol of up to 10(-6) M. Treatment with low concentrations of dilevalol (10(-8) to 10(-7) M) potentiated the contractile response to the electrical stimulation of adrenergic nerves in mesenteric arteries while high concentrations (3 x 10(-7) to 10(-5) M) attenuated it. The potentiation was reversed to attenuation by pretreatment with propranolol. Treatment with isoproterenol (10(-10) to 10(-9) M) also potentiated the contractile response to the electrical stimulation in the arteries. Isoproterenol did not cause any relaxation of mesenteric arteries precontracted with PGF2 alpha. Attenuations by clonidine of the response to the electrical stimulation in the arteries did not significantly differ in control arteries and those treated with a high concentration (10(-6) M) of dilevalol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "beta-Blockers are widely used in the treatment of high blood pressure. To study clinical and pharmacological role of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density, assessed by 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding, was investigated in 10 hypertensive patients (8 male, 2 female) aged 20-62 years before and after treatment with mepindolol (5 mg o.i.d.). After 3 months of therapy, both systolic (from 169.7 +/- 28.3 mmHg to 146.5 +/- 17.6 mmHg) and diastolic (from 108.7 +/- 17.5 mmHg to 93.6 +/- 8.7 mmHg) blood pressure decreased significantly. Similarly heart rate decreased after treatment (from 76.5 +/- 10.1 b/min to 62.7 +/- 3.4 b/min). Mepindolol treatment decreased beta 2-adrenoceptor density from 1112.2 +/- 459.6 sites/cell to 295.1 +/- 131.2 sites/cell. Plasma noradrenaline values did not correlate with lymphocyte beta 2-receptor number both before and after treatment. Our results show that ISA may play an important role in modulating beta 2-adrenoceptor density on lymphocyte surface. This biological effect could be relevant in reducing the so called \"propranolol rebound effect\".", 
    "20": "Oestrogen and progesterone influence myometrial and cervical responses at different levels of the mechanisms regulating uterine contractility. One of these mechanisms could involve alterations in the adrenoceptor concentrations. This study was undertaken to assess the effects of treatment with the antiprogestogen RU-486 on the concentrations of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in pregnant rabbit myometrial and cervical membranes by means of a radioligand binding technique. The probable relative oestrogen dominance due to the antiprogestogen treatment selectively decreased the alpha 2-adrenoceptor subtype in the cervix, where an alpha-adrenoceptor dominance was found on day 27 of pregnancy. The results indicate a heterologous regulation of alpha-adrenoceptors by sex steroids, i.e. suppression of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor concentration by antiprogestogen treatment.", 
    "21": "Metopirone, a blocker of the 11 beta-hydroxylase, was used to suppress cortisol synthesis in the eel, producing a pharmacological adrenalectomy. After 1 and 2 days, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) immunoreactivity was reduced in the preoptic nucleus (PON) and was increased in the rostral neurohypophysis (NH) where CRF fibers ended in close proximity to ACTH cells. After 4 days, immunoreactive (ir) CRF increased in the PON or was similar to that of controls, and was reduced in the rostral NH. It was not affected in the caudal NH among intermediate lobe (IL) ramifications. Arginine vasotocin (AVT) immunostaining was often slightly increased in the PON, but changes were not apparent in the pituitary and AVT-ir fibers remained very scarce in the rostral NH. Metopirone significantly increased the cross-sectional area of CRF- and AVT-ir perikarya in the parvocellular region and the number of these perikarya as well as the ratio of CRF to AVT cell bodies in the totality of the PON. Colocalization of CRF and AVT, barely detected in control eels, occurred in 9.6% of CRF perikarya after 1-2 days, but in only 2.4% after 4 days. ACTH cells were rapidly and markedly stimulated. These immunocytochemical studies suggest that CRF synthesis, axonal transport, and release are increased in metopirone-treated eels, acting on the pituitary to stimulate ACTH release and interrenal cell activity. The participation of AVT in ACTH cell stimulation is less clear. These data are compared to those reported in mammals.", 
    "22": "In 15 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, the effects of diltiazem (120 mg twice daily) were compared with those of atenolol (50 mg once daily), the two drugs in combination, and placebo in a randomized double-blind cross-over study with treatment phases of 4 weeks duration. Blood pressure was reduced in the active treatment phases (supine blood pressure: diltiazem, 172/92 mmHg; atenolol, 172/92 mmHg; diltiazem plus atenolol, 164/88 mmHg; pooled estimate of s.e.m. by analysis of variance = 3/1) compared with placebo (180/101 mmHg). Factorial analysis confirmed fully additive antihypertensive effects of the drugs in combination. The time interval from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex (P-R interval) was longer during combination therapy (0.184s) compared with either diltiazem (0.175s) or atenolol (0.174s) alone, or placebo (0.164s); s.e.m. by analysis of variance = 0.003. No clinically significant conduction disturbances occurred. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was elevated by atenolol but not diltiazem. Thus, in subjects with uncomplicated essential hypertension, diltiazem and atenolol had equal antihypertensive efficacy when used alone, and fully additive effects in combination, on both blood pressure and cardiac conduction.", 
    "23": "This randomized double-blind controlled study analyzed the hemodynamic effects of penbutolol, a new levo-rotatory betablocker, using radionuclide angiography. Twenty cirrhotics with esophageal varices were randomized: 10 received 40 mg/day of penbutolol orally and the others a placebo. Angioscintigraphy was performed before and after an 8-day treatment period. Three cases in the penbutolol group were lost due to software damage, hence the data of 17 patients were analyzed. The two groups were similar for age, sex, etiology of cirrhosis and hepatic function. The index of portal perfusion decreased significantly (-29%; p = 0.018), and the hepatic artery index increased significantly (+23%; p = 0.018), whereas no changes were observed after placebo. The heart rate decreased significantly after penbutolol (-9%; p = 0.021); while neither penbutolol nor placebo modified the ejection fraction. In conclusion, penbutolol decreased portal perfusion index (the compensatory increase of hepatic artery index confirmed this change) without significant modification of total hepatic blood flow and systemic hemodynamics. Angioscintigraphy is reasonably accurate, reproducible, safe and can be considered suitable for routine use in the assessment of liver hemodynamics.", 
    "24": "Although agonist-induced desensitization of adrenergic receptors has been previously demonstrated, the regulation of adrenergic receptors during acute psychological stress has not been investigated in humans. We studied 30 first year medical students during final examination week and one month earlier. Platelet alpha 2 receptor binding was measured using 3H-yohimbine and leukocyte beta 2 receptor binding was measured with 125I-CYP (Iodocyanopindolol). During final examination week, platelet alpha 2-receptor binding affinity was significantly reduced, while levels of plasma catecholamines and reported anxiety were significantly increased, compared with the earlier period. Students showing the greatest increases in plasma norepinephrine and in reported anxiety also demonstrated the greatest reductions in alpha 2 receptor binding affinity. These data show that acute psychological stress can produce adrenergic receptor desensitization, possibly through increased levels of circulating norepinephrine.", 
    "25": "The characteristics of [125I]monoiodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding to beta-adrenoceptors of cultured aortic smooth muscle cells derived from 4-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and the Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY) were examined. During optimization of the binding assays, we found that the specific binding of ICYP by intact cells was masked by a high level of nonspecific ICYP accumulation in intact cells presumably owing to the lipophilic nature of ICYP. Optimal specific ICYP binding requires that the cells be gently lysed with hypotonic dilution followed by a freeze-and-thaw cycle. Under most experimental conditions tested, the total number of ICYP binding sites in WKY aortic muscle cells was considerably and consistently smaller than that in SHR cells. There was no difference in the Kd values for ICYP binding to SHR and WKY cells. However, when ICYP binding was carried out using crude membrane fractions with well-defined plasma membrane content isolated from aortic muscle strips of adult rats, we found no difference in the number of beta-adrenoceptor sites between SHR and WKY. Morphological evidence indicated that cultured SHR aortic muscle cells contained a greater proportion of larger cells with multinuclear features. These results suggest that an increase in the number of beta-adrenoceptor density per cell in SHR may be associated with cellular hypertrophy of aortic smooth muscle cells. We conclude that under cultured conditions, a higher incidence of polyploid smooth muscle cells in the SHR as compared with WKY was expressed earlier than under in vivo conditions. Therefore, the interpretation of results obtained from cultured cell studies in relation to under in vivo conditions should be exercised with caution.", 
    "26": "1. Experiments were performed in cats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to assess the responses of knee joint blood vessels to nerve stimulation under control conditions and in the presence of different adrenoceptor antagonists in order to establish the nature of neurotransmitters released from articular nerve fibres. 2. The posterior articular nerve (PAN) supplying the knee was stimulated at different intensities, and frequency-response curves were obtained. In fourteen animals electrical stimulation of PAN produced an initial vasoconstriction during stimulation which in eight of these was followed by a prolonged dilatation on cessation of stimulation. The constrictor response was increased as a function of frequency but was little altered with increasing intensity beyond a threshold level. 3. The constrictor response to electrical stimulation of PAN was markedly reduced by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (10(-5) M, the alpha 1-blocker prazosin (10(-5) M), and guanethidine (10(-5) M) which inhibits the release of noradrenaline, ATP, and neuropeptide Y from sympathetic nerve endings. 4. The constrictor response to PAN stimulation was unaffected by the alpha 2-blocker rauwolscine and the P2-purinoceptor desensitizer alpha,beta-methylene ATP. 5. The dilator response was due to activation of afferent fibres as it could also be produced by direct electrical stimulation of the L7 dorsal roots. 6. The dilator response to stimulation of PAN or the L7 dorsal root was reduced by prior intra-articular injection of 100 micrograms of the substance P antagonist D-Pro4-D-Trp7,9,10-SP4-11. 7. These results suggest that the vasoconstrictor response to electrical stimulation of PAN is most likely to be mediated via noradrenaline acting mainly upon alpha 1-adrenoceptors. As the dilator response to articular nerve stimulation is reduced by a substance P antagonist, the mediator inducing this response may be substance P or a related neurokinin.", 
    "27": "The state of the lymphatic heart perfusion has been studied experimentally on dogs with intact myocardium (control 1), with acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) model (control 2) and during injection of heparin, rheogluman and obsidan in AMI. It has been stated that AMI induces acute distress of the lymphatic heart perfusion system occurring at the first minutes after the onset of the focal myocardial ischemia. Heparin, rheogluman and obsidan demonstrated selective stimulating effect on the function of the lymphatic myocardial system.", 
    "28": "The effects of increased cytosolic calcium on cardiac mechanics were studied in open chest dogs instrumented with ultrasonic crystals and a miniature pressure transducer. Calcium was increased either by promoting calcium influx with Bay K 8644 (Bay K) or by increasing extracellular calcium concentration. A single dose of Bay K (10 micrograms/kg/min) was administered to each dog. Bay K increased LV systolic pressure, maximal rate of rise of LV pressure (LV + dP/dt), mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (Vcf), and calculated LV end-systolic wall stress. The time constant of isovolumic pressure decay (T) was calculated following two different methods: (a) a semilogarithmic method (Tz), and (b) using the linear relation between LV - dP/dt vs LV pressure (T1). Whereas Tz decreased from 31.7 +/- 2.6 to 26.7 +/- 1.7 ms (P less than 0.05), no changes were detected in T1 (46.3 +/- 4.4 vs 50.9 +/- 4.0 ms N.S.) The asymptote value (PB) decreased after Bay K from -9 +/- 2.8 to -22.5 +/- 4.2 mmHg (P less than 0.05). The same results were obtained when the changes in the loading conditions of the heart produced by Bay K were controlled by mechanical manoeuvers or after beta-blockade with propranolol. When calcium chloride was administered in amounts that will produce equal contractile changes as Bay K, a decrease in PB was also observed (from -14.7 +/- 1.6 to -27.7 +/- 6.1 mmHg (P less than 0.05]. Tz decreased from 29.6 +/- 3.6 to 22.5 +/- 2.9 ms (P less than 0.05) and no changes in T1 (52.5 +/- 5 vs 52.4 +/- 7.3 ms, N.S.) were detected. The decrease in the asymptote reported herein could induce a false decrease in the time constant if the altered values of PB are not considered, or another method of calculation of the time constant is used. Neither Bay K nor elevated extracellular calcium concentration modified the diastolic compliance. Changes in loading conditions or a cAMP pathway can be ruled out as a cause of the decrease in PB, since the results were reproduced under controlled loading conditions and beta blockade. These data suggest that increasing cytosolic calcium does not alter either the relaxation rate or the diastolic compliance but does decrease the value toward left ventricular pressure decays.", 
    "29": "Recent reports suggested that a complex alteration in beta-receptor function occurs in failing human myocardium. We evaluated beta-receptor-subtype activity in an experimental model of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced cardiomyopathy in the rat. Through pulmonary hypertension, MCT causes right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), either associated with heart failure or not, beta-Receptor function was evaluated in both failing-hypertrophic and hypertrophic hearts in binding studies with [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) and by measuring adenylate cyclase (AC) activity. In the right failing ventricle, beta 1- but not beta 2-receptor density was decreased. Lesion-associated modifications in the adenylate cyclase system were also observed: isoproterenol- and guanosine 5' [beta, gamma-imido]triphosphate [Gpp(NH)p]-stimulated cyclic AMP formation was reduced in the right failing ventricle, while the cyclic AMP responses to NaF and forskolin were unchanged. On the other hand, no changes in either beta-receptor density or function were found in hypertrophic ventricles. MCT-induced heart failure in the rat is thus associated with a selective decrease of beta 1-receptor density and function. These results suggest that MCT-induced cardiac failure may be an appropriate model in which to investigate heart insufficiency further.", 
    "30": "Sixty-one patients (41 men, 20 women) aged 29-73 years, with moderate to severe hypertension, were enrolled in a multicentre study to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dilevalol (D) and captopril (C). At the end of the baseline period, supine diastolic blood pressure (SuDBP) was 105-140 mm Hg on hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg once daily and placebo t.i.d. Patients were randomly assigned to D + HCTZ (n = 29) or C + HCTZ (n = 32) and entered phase II titration of D (100-800 mg b.i.d.) or C (12.5 mg b.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d.). If SuDBP was greater than 99 mm Hg, hydralazine was added (25 mg once daily to 50 mg b.i.d.). If SuDBP was less than or equal to 99 mm Hg, patients entered phase III, a 3-month maintenance period. Demographic profiles were not significantly different between the two groups. Baseline supine BP (mean +/- SEM) was similar in the two groups (D + HCTZ: 182 +/- 3/112 +/- 1; C + HCTZ: 179 +/- 4/113 +/- 1 mm Hg), as was baseline standing BP (D + HCTZ: 175 +/- 3/114 +/- 2; C +/- HCTZ: 173 +/- 4/113 +/- 1 mm Hg). At the end of phase II, there were no significant differences between treatments with respect to the changes in BP from baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "The involvement of rolipram-sensitive phosphodiesterase (PDE IV) in regulation of cardiac contraction was investigated by studying the effect of selective inhibitors (rolipram, denbufylline, Ro 20-1724) on guinea pig left atria contraction. In contrast to milrinone and SK&F 94120 (inhibitors of the cyclic GMP-inhibited PDE, PDE III), (+/-)-rolipram and denbufylline (0.1-30 microM) did not produce any positive inotropic effect in normal (2.5 mM) or elevated (3-3.2 mM) external CaCl2 concentration. In these conditions, Ro 20-1724 produced only a slight but significant increase of contraction over control levels. In the presence of forskolin (an adenylate cyclase activator) or SK&F 94120 (a PDE III inhibitor), which produced an increase of the response to electrical stimulation of approximately 10%, (+/-)-rolipram, denbufylline, and Ro 20-1724 all exerted concentration-dependent positive inotropic effects (mean EC50 values were 20, 25, and 125 nM, respectively, in the presence of forskolin). Rolipram exhibited stereospecificity: the (-)-enantiomer was 10 times more potent than the (+)-enantiomer. Neither preincubation of the atria with atenolol nor pretreatment of the guinea pigs with reserpine significantly modified the effect of PDE IV inhibitors obtained in the presence of forskolin. These data show that in the presence of cyclic AMP-dependent positive inotropic agents, PDE IV inhibitors exert a positive inotropic effect which probably does not involve enhanced catecholamine release from sympathetic nerve endings. This suggests that PDE IV may play a role in regulation of cardiac contraction in physiologic conditions in which the sympathetic outflow produces a stimulation of adenylate cyclase in cardiac cells.", 
    "32": "Eight normotensive subjects received single and multiple doses of cromakalim (1 mg) and placebo in a randomised double-blind cross-over study to examine general tolerance to cromakalim and its effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and pressor responses to norepinephrine (NE) and angiotensin II (AII). In a second study, 10 hypertensive patients whose BP control was unsatisfactory with atenolol 50-100 mg received additional treatment with placebo followed by cromakalim 1 mg daily for 4 weeks. Assessments were made of BP, HR, apparent hepatic blood flow and renal blood flow (RBF), pulmonary function, and the pharmacokinetics of atenolol. Cromakalim was generally well tolerated in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects. In the normotensive group, cromakalim produced a reflex increase in HR without any detectable decrease in BP: average (placebo-subtracted) increases in HR at 4 h were 16 beats/min with subjects in an erect position after the single dose and 14 beats/min after 7 days. Cromakalim had no effect on pressor responses to NE and AII. Addition of cromakalim to atenolol was associated with modest further reductions in BP between 0.5 and 3 h after drug administration, with maximal reductions of 21/14 mm Hg (subjects in supine position) 2 h after the first dose. Cromakalim had no effect on apparent liver blood flow and RBF, pulmonary function, and the steady-state pharmacokinetics of atenolol. Single and multiple 1-mg doses of cromakalim are well tolerated but are associated with only modest vasodilator activity.", 
    "33": "We compared the effects of a low (0.09 microgram/ml) concentration of propranolol expected to produce only beta-adrenoceptor blockade and a high concentration (0.9 microgram/ml) expected to produce additional direct local anesthetic-like electrophysiological effects on basic and premature action potentials. Both isolated dog cardiac Purkinje and ventricular muscle fibers were examined using conventional microelectrode techniques. The low concentration of propranolol produced no significant electrophysiological change in either fiber type. The high concentration of propranolol shortened the action potential duration and refractoriness while decreasing the maximal upstroke velocity (Vmax) in both Purkinje and ventricular muscle fibers at a constant basic cycle length. In Purkinje fibers, the high concentration also slowed the kinetics of restitution of the action potential duration (tau c from 124.6 +/- 6.5 to 201.4 +/- 16.0 ms, p less than 0.01, n = 7), slowed the recovery kinetics of Vmax, and shifted the early portion of the normalized restitution curve toward longer action potential duration values in both fiber types. The range of premature action potential durations, defined as the difference between action potential durations during the first 100 ms of restitution, was decreased by the high concentration of propranolol in both Purkinje and ventricular muscle fibers by 39.5% and 33.9%, respectively. These findings indicate that (a) low concentrations of propranolol produced no direct electrophysiological effect, and (b) high concentrations of propranolol produced several potential antiarrhythmic effects in addition to the previously reported effects on Vmax and the action potential duration.", 
    "34": "The elderly are reported to be less sensitive to the beta-blocking effects of propranolol. However, age-related changes in the stereoselective pharmacokinetics or protein binding of propranolol enantiomers could have confounded the results of previous studies because only 1-propranolol contributes significantly to the beta-blocking effects of the racemate. To avoid these confounding variables, we studied 10 young (mean 28 years) and 10 elderly (mean 64 years) subjects, and determined the cardiac beta-receptor sensitivity in terms of unbound, active 1-propranolol. The doses of isoproterenol required to increase heart rate (HR) by 25 beats/min were determined before and during a continuous infusion of propranolol. The serum concentration of 1-propranolol was determined by enantioselective high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the unbound fraction was determined by equilibrium dialysis. The apparent in vivo receptor dissociation constant for unbound 1-propranolol increased from 0.066 +/- 0.047 ng/ml in the young to 0.218 +/- 0.264 ng/ml in the older group (p less than 0.05). The unbound fraction was decreased in the older subjects (0.141 +/- 0.023 vs. 0.121 +/- 0.025, p less than 0.05) because of an increase in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentration (55 +/- 11 mg/dl vs. 72 +/- 19 mg/dl, p less than 0.05). Advancing age was associated with a decreased sensitivity to isoproterenol (rs = 0.76, p less than 0.05) and to unbound 1-propranolol (rs = 0.45, p less than 0.05). We conclude that the older subjects have (a) decreased sensitivity to the beta-blocking effects of 1-propranolol and to the agonist effects of isoproterenol, and (b) a lower unbound fraction of 1-propranolol.", 
    "35": "In pregnant-rat myometrium (day 21 of gestation), isoprenaline-induced cyclic AMP accumulation, resulting from receptor-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase, was negatively regulated by prostaglandins [PGE2, PGF2 alpha; EC50 (concn. giving 50% of maximal response) = 2 nM] and by the muscarinic agonist carbachol (EC50 = 2 microM). PG-induced inhibition was prevented by pertussis-toxin treatment, supporting the idea that it was mediated by the inhibitory G-protein Gi through the inhibitory pathway of the adenylate cyclase. Both isoprenaline-induced stimulation and PG-evoked inhibition of cyclic AMP were insensitive to Ca2+ depletion. By contrast, carbachol-evoked attenuation of cyclic AMP accumulation was dependent on Ca2+ and was insensitive to pertussis toxin. The inhibitory effect of carbachol was mimicked by ionomycin. Indirect evidence was thus provided for the enhancement of cyclic AMP degradation by a Ca2(+)-dependent phosphodiesterase activity in the muscarinic-mediated effect. The attenuation of cyclic AMP elicited by carbachol coincided with carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphate (InsP3, InsP2 and InsP) generation, which displayed an almost identical EC50 (3 microM) and was similarly unaffected by pertussis toxin. Both carbachol effects were reproduced by oxotremorine, whereas pilocarpine (a partial muscarinic agonist) failed to induce any decrease in cyclic AMP accumulation and concurrently was unable to stimulate the generation of inositol phosphates. These data support our proposal for a carbachol-mediated enhancement of a Ca2(+)-dependent phosphodiesterase activity, compatible with the rises in Ca2+ associated with muscarinic-induced increased generation of inositol phosphates. They further illustrate that a cross-talk between the two major transmembrane signalling systems contributed to an ultimate decrease in cyclic AMP in the pregnant-rat myometrium near term.", 
    "36": "Airway smooth muscle plasma membranes are rich in K+ channels of various types. Charybdotoxin (ChTX) is a potent blocker of the high-conductance Ca(++)-activated K+ channel in smooth muscle and produces a concentration-dependent contraction of guinea pig trachea. In the present study, pharmacologic experiments were performed on carbachol-contracted (0.34 microM) guinea-pig trachea contracted further with ChTX in order to determine if Ca(++)-activated K+ channels play a role in the responses to cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent bronchodilators. Relaxation concentration response curves to the beta-agonists, isoproterenol and salbutamol; the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, aminophylline; the cAMP mimic, N6-2'-O-adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate the guanylate cyclase activator, sodium nitroprusside; and the K+ channel agonists, BRL-34915 and pinacidil, were obtained in the absence and presence of ChTX. The concentration response curves to isoproterenol and salbutamol were shifted to the right (approximately 27-fold and greater than 40-fold, respectively) by 180 nM ChTX, whereas concentration response curves to N6-2'-O-adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate and aminophylline were affected significantly less (shifted approximately 7.5-fold). Concentration response curves to the cGMP-dependent relaxant sodium nitroprusside were also altered by ChTX (17-fold rightward shift at 180 nM). In the presence of 60 nM ChTX, the concentration response curves to the above relaxants were shifted only 3- to 5-fold. In contrast, ChTX (60 and 180 nM) failed to produce a significant rightward shift in the concentration response curves to BRL-34915 or pinacidil. Relaxation to BRL-34915 was however, blocked by glybenclamide, suggesting differences in the mechanism of relaxation. Contraction of tissues with depolarizing concentrations of KCl (20-80 mM) inhibited responses to all bronchodilators. These results suggest that hyperpolarization of tracheal smooth muscle as a result of opening various types of K+ channels can lead to relaxation of carbachol-contracted tracheal smooth muscle.", 
    "37": "The metabolic actions of the vasoactive peptides vasotocin and isotocin and the alpha-agonist phenylephrine are examined in hepatocytes isolated from three teleost species: brown bullhead, rainbow trout, and American eel. These three compounds influenced hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis with significant species differences. Vasotocin and isotocin affected only eel hepatocytes activating gluconeogenesis by 1.7-fold and glycogenolysis by 3-fold. Phenylephrine increased glycogenolysis by 7-fold in bullhead hepatocytes and gluconeogenesis by 1.4-fold in trout cells. Vasotocin and phenylephrine actions were correlated with increases in adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP). The vasotocin effects were unaffected by beta- and alpha-antagonists supporting a V2-type receptor on eel hepatocytes. Phenylephrine effects were abolished by propranolol and reduced by prazosin and yohimbine (alpha 1- and alpha 2-antagonists, respectively). Phenylephrine, therefore, affected fish hepatocyte metabolism either by a mixed alpha/beta-receptor mechanism emphasizing beta-adrenoceptors or the classic alpha/beta agonist/antagonist scheme defined for mammals is not appropriate for these fish preparations.", 
    "38": "To examine the presence and time course of beta-adrenergic antagonism produced by amiodarone, the heart rate, QT interval and arrhythmia frequency in response to graded doses of isoproterenol were evaluated in eight patients treated with oral amiodarone for sustained ventricular tachycardia. Measurements were made before and every 2 days after beginning oral amiodarone therapy (600 mg twice daily). Isoproterenol was given in doses of 12.5, 25 and 50 ng/kg body weight per min. The mean heart rate at rest decreased from 73.1 +/- 17.8 beats/min on day 0 to 57.8 +/- 15.0 beats/min after 12 days of amiodarone therapy. A significant linear decline in heart rate at rest was observed until day 6 (p less than 0.05 for all comparisons). On all days isoproterenol produced a progressive increase in heart rate that reached 115.5 +/- 20.2 beats/min on day 0 and 94.2 +/- 18.5 beats/min on day 12. Amiodarone blunted the heart rate increase produced by isoproterenol on days 2 to 12 (p less than 0.05 versus day 0). This effect was present by day 2 and did not change significantly thereafter. The mean corrected QT (QTc) interval increased from 430 +/- 30 ms on day 0 to 449 +/- 63 ms on day 12. A significant linear increase in QTc interval was observed until day 6 (p less than 0.05 for all comparisons). There was no systematic effect of isoproterenol on the QTc interval. Five of eight patients had a significant number of isoproterenol-induced premature ventricular complexes. Ventricular ectopic activity in response to isoproterenol was abolished after 4 days of amiodarone therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Stress reactions exist in many conditions in which plasma interleukin 6 (IL-6) is elevated. Examples are burns and sepsis. In these situations fever is often present. These stress situations are always accompanied with high levels of adrenalin and corticosteroids. These hormones, especially when given together, elicit a definite response of acute phase proteins in normal rats. In two stress models, (i) laparotomy and (ii) fever induced by administration of PGE2 in the lateral intracerebral ventricle, we observed a rise of adrenalin and corticosteron followed by an elevated level of plasma IL-6. Therefore, we studied the effect of adrenalin and corticosteron on the plasma level of IL-6. Adrenalin evokes high levels of IL-6, and this effect can be blocked by propranolol. When IL-6 release is blocked in this way, the response of alpha 2 macroglobulin and the cysteine protease inhibitor, both fast-reacting acute phase proteins in rat, is strongly depressed. Isoprenalin, an adreno beta 2 agonist, also causes very high levels of IL-6, indicating that the release of IL-6 can be mediated by an adreno beta 2 receptor whose presence has been demonstrated in monocytic cells. The results suggest a relation between stress situations and IL-6 and may be another factor besides the presence of endotoxins, virus, etc. explaining the high levels of IL-6 observed in many serious clinical situations.", 
    "40": "Rats were bilaterally olfactory bulbectomized. At 15 days post-lesion, olfactory bulbectomized (OB) rats exhibited significant deficits in the acquisition of passive avoidance learning compared to sham lesioned rats. beta-Adrenoceptor binding in the amygdala, hippocampus and cerebral cortex was assayed with (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Scatchard analyses revealed no difference between OB and sham rats in maximal binding density (Bmax) in any of the three tissues. However, in the OB rats, the affinity of the beta-adrenoceptor for the ligand was significantly increased in the amygdala and hippocampus but not in the cortex. Bulbectomy did not affect the ratio of beta 1- to beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes in the three brain tissues. In amygdala and hippocampus but not cerebral cortex, bulbectomy resulted in an increase in the proportion and the affinity of the high-affinity beta-adrenoceptor binding sites for isoproterenol. The affinity of the low-affinity sites in the hippocampus was also increased in the OB rats. The results suggest that olfactory bulbectomy causes supersensitivity of the amygdaloid and hippocampal beta-adrenoceptor by increasing the degree of coupling of the receptor with the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding protein (Gs protein).", 
    "41": "To evaluate knowledge of, attitudes to, and use of illegal drugs and other forms of \"doping\" in sport 1015 Italian athletes and 216 coaches, doctors, and managers (technicians) were interviewed after selection on a quota basis. Overall, 30% of athletes, managers, and coaches and 21% of doctors indicated that athletic performance can be enhanced by drugs or other doping practices. Over 10% of athletes indicated a frequent use of amphetamines or anabolic steroids at national or international level, fewer athletes mentioning blood doping (7%) and beta-blockers (2%) or other classes of drugs. These proportions were 2-3 times higher for occasional use than for frequent use. Estimates by managers and coaches were much the same as those of athletes when allowance was made for larger random variation. 62% of athletes who acknowledged doping reported pressure to do so from coaches and managers. According to over 70% of athletes access to illegal substances was not difficult. Both athletes and technicians awarded higher scores to risk than to efficacy for any substance, although 42-67% of athletes and technicians regarded amphetamines and anabolic steroids as efficacious. 82% wanted stricter controls not only during competitions but also during training.", 
    "42": "Hormones, neurotransmitter and autacoid receptors, localized on the plasma membrane, do not interact directly with their respective downstream effector (i.e., an ion channel and/or an enzyme that synthesizes a second messenger), but control their target systems via activation of an intermediary guanine nucleotide binding protein on G protein, which serves as signal transducer. Traffic of these pathways is regulated via a GTP (on)-GDP (off) switch, which is triggered by the receptor. The combination of classical biochemistry and recombinant DNA technology has resulted in the discovery of many members of the G protein family. Receptor desensitization is a main criterion of G protein-coupled receptors with important pharmacological implications. Multiple mechanisms are responsible for the loss of sensitivity that follows against exposure. The process is initiated by uncoupling the receptor from its G protein, which is due to receptor phosphorylation by specific kinases. In the case of the beta-adrenergic receptor, two particular kinases - beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) and protein kinase A--are involved. Further steps of desensitization are receptor sequestration or internalization, an event as rapid and transient as receptor uncoupling, and receptor downregulation, which requires more prolonged agonist exposure. Finally, antagonists are able to induce a receptor-G protein interaction in a reverse manner to agonists. Whereas agonists stimulate both, the GDP dissociation from the G protein and the association of GTP, antagonists markedly decrease GTP association. Moreover, in the turkey erythrocyte adenylyl cyclase system antagonists decrease the GTP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity almost at basal levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Dexamethasone increases glutamine synthetase activity and mRNA abundance in L6 muscle cells in culture, apparently by a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated process. The data in this report reveal that increased glutamine synthetase mRNA abundance is attributable at least in part to an enhanced rate of transcription of the glutamine synthetase gene. \"Nuclear runoff\" assays of glutamine synthetase gene expression were performed with purified myonuclei from dexamethasone-treated or untreated L6 skeletal muscle cells. These assays showed glutamine synthetase transcription to be increased approximately 2-fold as early as 1 h after incubation of cells with dexamethasone (10(-7) M); there was no increase in the rate of transcription of the beta-tubulin gene, which served as a control. The increase in glutamine synthetase gene transcription correlates with increased glutamine synthetase enzymatic activity after dexamethasone treatment. Studies with actinomycin D indicated that the half-life of glutamine synthetase mRNA (7-8 h) is not altered by dexamethasone. Therefore, the degradation of glutamine synthetase mRNA is not affected by dexamethasone, and the increased glutamine synthetase mRNA level is attributable to increased transcription. The dexamethasone-mediated increase in glutamine synthetase mRNA abundance is glucocorticoid receptor-mediated; RU38486 (a glucocorticoid receptor blocker) completely blocked the effect of dexamethasone. The dexamethasone-mediated increase in glutamine synthetase gene transcription and steady-state mRNA level was not blocked by cycloheximide, indicating a direct effect.", 
    "44": "The effects of N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) and sotalol on membrane current systems of guinea-pig ventricular myocytes were examined and compared with those of quinidine using patch-clamp techniques. All of the drugs prolonged the action potential duration (i.e. Class III effect) in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscles. In isolated ventricular cells. NAPA (300 microM) and sotalol (100 microM) produced a decrease in the delayed outward potassium current (IK) concomitantly with a slight decrease in the calcium current (ICa), which was similar to quinidine (10 microM). NAPA also slightly depressed the inward rectifier potassium current (IKrect). Thus, NAPA and sotalol both inhibited IK, and this action appears to be mainly responsible for their Class III effect.", 
    "45": "Rapid reestablishment of myocardial blood supply is the ideal in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolysis and, in selected cases, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary bypass surgery may limit the extent of myocardial necrosis and improve survival. An open, infarct-related artery after thrombolysis carries a better prognosis, but it remains to be established whether the persistent lesion needs to be treated by PCTA or surgery in all patients. Early intravenous beta blockade reduces inhospital mortality by approximately 15% in patients without thrombolysis, while calcium antagonists, despite their theoretical promise and in vitro results, are not effective in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction. Only diltiazem seems to reduce the incidence of reinfarction in patients with non-Q-wave infarction. Aspirin reduces mortality in patients with unstable angina pectoris and in patients with acute myocardial infarction with or without concomitant thrombolysis.", 
    "46": "To elucidate the mechanism of thyroid hormone-induced hyperinsulinemia, the acute and direct effect of thyroid hormone administration on insulin secretion was investigated in rats in vivo and in vitro. In the perfused rat pancreas, the addition of thyroxine (10 micrograms/dL) or 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (150 ng/dL) to the perfusing medium did not affect insulin secretion. The administration of thyroxine (40 micrograms/kg, s.c.) in vivo increased the plasma insulin level from 11 +/- 2 microUnits/mL (mean +/- SD) to 30 +/- 7 microUnits/mL, while blood glucose and plasma glucagon were unchanged. This phenomenon was inhibited completely by the preadministration of oxprenolol hydrochloride (2 mg/kg, s.c.), and inhibited partly by the preadministration of metoprolol tartrate (35 mg/kg, s.c.). These results suggest that thyroid hormone induces hyperinsulinemia via beta-adrenergic stimulation in the rat.", 
    "47": "In a randomized 6-month study of 201 patients, the antihypertensive efficiency of the calcium antagonist nitrendipine, the beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol, mepindolol, the beta blocker with intrinsic activity and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were compared as monitored by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements. The study was designed so that a comparable decrease in casual BP values was obtained with all 4 drugs. If normotension was not achieved with monotherapy, a diuretic also was administered. Pretreatment casual BP and mean 24-hour ambulatory BP values did not differ between the 4 groups. Normotension as assessed by casual BP measurements was observed in all 4 groups after 6 months of therapy, there being no significant differences between the groups. However, significantly more diuretics were required in the mepindolol (n = 14) and in the enalapril (n = 20) groups compared to the nitrendipine (n = 5) and metoprolol (n = 7) groups. Despite comparable casual BP control, the 4 groups differed significantly in their mean 24-hour measurements. The greatest systolic and diastolic BP decreases were seen in the metoprolol group. Metoprolol was also the most effective drug in decreasing the frequency of systolic pressure peaks greater than 180 mm Hg. Both beta blockers and enalapril significantly decreased the morning BP increase compared to the values before treatment, while nitrendipine did not. These data show that casual BP measurement is not a good predictor of 24-hour BP in patients taking hypertensive therapy. Despite an equal degree of \"office\" BP control, different antihypertensive regimens do not confer the same degree of \"nonoffice\" BP control.", 
    "48": "Efficient expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) of the human interferon-beta gene (IFN-beta) gene and of a chemically synthesized IFN-beta gene variant (506 base pairs; synIFN-beta) adapted to the E. coli codon usage, both fused to the E. coli atpE ribosome-binding site, is controlled either by primary sequence or by mRNA secondary-structure in the translational initiation region. High level expression of the natural human atpE/IFN-beta gene fusion is governed by the nucleotide composition preceding the initiator codon AUG. A single U----C exchange in the -2 or -1 position preceding the initiator codon AUG reduces the translational efficiency from 18% of total cellular protein to only 8% or 4%, respectively, while both U----C substitutions reduce IFN-beta expression below 1%. These sequence alterations interfere with efficient ribosome binding as revealed by toeprinting. They provide further evidence for the influence of the anticodon-flanking regions of tRNA(fMet) upon the initiation rate of translation. In contrast, translation of the synthetic variant atpE/synIFN-beta gene fusion is controlled by a moderately stable stem-loop structure (delta G = -4 kcal/mol; 37 degrees C) located within the coding region and overlapping the 30 S ribosomal subunit attachment site. That the stability of the hairpin interferes with the initiation of translation is inferred from site-directed mutagenesis and toeprint analyses. mRNA half-life in these variants is positively correlated with the rate of translation and involves two major endonucleolytic cleavage site 5'-upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno region.", 
    "49": "Focal electrical stimulation of the ventrolateral pontine tegmentum in conscious rats induced antinociception in approximately one-half of the animals screened, as indicated by a marked suppression of the thermally evoked tail-flick flexion reflex. The effectiveness of ventrolateral pontine stimulation in elevating tail-flick latency was significantly reduced by intrathecal microinjection of 30 micrograms of the non-selective alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine, and was largely abolished by a 60-micrograms dose of this drug. The blockade of ventrolateral pontine stimulation-produced antinociception by phentolamine was maximal by 15 min postinjection, and was still evident 60 min after drug microinjection. Ventrolateral pontine stimulation-produced antinociception was also attenuated by intrathecal administration of the alpha 2-selective antagonist yohimbine (37 micrograms) and the opioid antagonist naloxone (30 micrograms), but not the alpha 1 antagonist WB-4101 (37 micrograms), the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (111.6 micrograms) nor the serotonergic antagonist methysergide (30 micrograms). However, the antagonism of pontine stimulation-produced antinociception by naloxone was unlike that of phentolamine and yohimbine, in that it developed slowly and was only evident at 60 min postinjection. Hence naloxone's site of action may be distant from the injection site. These data indicate that the thermal antinociception produced by stimulation of the ventrolateral pons is mediated through spinal alpha 2-receptors and opioid receptors of uncertain location. The close proximity of many of the effective electrode placements to the rostral A5 and ventral subcoerulear A7 noradrenergic cell groups suggests that noradrenergic spinopetal projections arising from these groups are involved in mediating the antinociception induced by stimulating these sites.", 
    "50": "Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) cannot currently be prevented. Different medical regimens have been largely unsuccessful. Experimental studies suggest roles for beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium antagonists. Controlled clinical studies have failed to show any decrease in restenosis rate for calcium antagonists. Corresponding studies for beta blockers are lacking. This study evaluates 541 consecutive PTCA procedures, 455 (86%) in patients treated with beta blockers after PTCA (76% metoprolol, 14% atenolol, 4% sotalol, 6% others) and 86 (14%) in patients without beta blockers. Angiographic success was achieved in 483 of 620 lesions (78%), and was not significantly different with or without beta blockers (79 vs 73%, p greater than 0.05). The procedure success rate and the complication rates (myocardial infarction, emergency coronary artery bypass grafting, death) did not differ with or without beta blockers (p greater than 0.05). Follow-up angiograms for 426 of the 483 successfully dilated lesions (88%) revealed that a total of 155 stenoses had recurred (36%). The restenosis rate was not significantly different with (368) or without (58) beta blockers (36 vs 38%, p greater than 0.05). For beta blockers with calcium antagonists (84% nifedipine, 13% diltiazem, 2% verapamil, 1% others), the restenosis rate was 97 of 250 (39%) vs 36 of 118 (31%) (p greater than 0.05). This retrospective study indicates that treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers after PTCA, alone or in combination with calcium antagonists, does not influence either the success rate or the restenosis rate and can be continued if indicated from an antiischemic viewpoint.", 
    "51": "Recombinant turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptors expressed in murine L cells exhibited characteristic avian subtype selectivity for agonists and antagonists. In 10 of the 11 clones studied, no agonist-induced internalization of receptor was observed, although agonist-induced uncoupling of receptor and adenylyl cyclase occurred rapidly. GTP caused little or no decrease in affinity for beta-adrenergic agonists. Such behavior is commonly observed in avian erythrocytes. In contrast, one clone was susceptible to agonist-induced receptor internalization and down-regulation even though it exhibited characteristic avian beta-adrenergic ligand-binding properties. The affinity of this variant receptor for agonists was also notably reduced by GTP. Electrophoresis of affinity-labeled receptor from this clone indicated an apparent size of about 33 kDa, about 12 kDa less than that of the native or recombinant turkey beta-adrenergic receptor. Genomic DNA from this cell line that encodes the receptor was cloned and partially sequenced. The coding region of the original receptor cDNA was interrupted after codon 412 (out of 483) and was followed by 36 base pairs of novel sequence prior to the first in-frame stop codon. These results suggest that the lack of both hormone-induced internalization and GTP-sensitive, high affinity binding of agonists that is characteristic of the beta-adrenergic receptor in avian erythrocytes is due to intrinsic properties of the receptor. The restoration of these phenomena in a C-terminally truncated mutant receptor suggests the importance of the C-terminal domain in determining these processes.", 
    "52": "The determination of beta-blockers has posed pharmaceutical analysts with a variety of problems arising from the essential characteristics of these compounds as bases and the variability of physicochemical properties of individual drugs. Liquid chromatography has become the favoured method of analysis and to a certain extent there is a standardised approach to analysis based on either solvent or solid-phase extraction and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to fluorescence detection. The analyst must be aware of interactions occurring during extraction stages. All manipulations should be fully evaluated for individual drugs and metabolites prior to use. Other analytical options are chosen for specific or more demanding applications. The use of unmodified silicas for the liquid chromatography of beta-blockers (and other basic drugs) is an example of a potential alternative mode of chromatography. The stereoselectivity of the pharmacology of beta-blockers has spawned a great deal of literature describing the resolution of enantiomers by chromatographic methods. It is envisaged that this area will achieve greater prominence in the future as drug development pursues optical purity. The demand for the availability of enantiomerically pure pharmaceutical preparations will certainly see developments for preparative-scale separations as well as analytical methods and will surely promote developments in new and established methods of chromatography.", 
    "53": "Several (aryloxy)propanolamines and related compounds (i.e. 5-13, 16-18, 20-24, 27-33, 35, 37-39, 41, and 42) were synthesized and investigated for their class III electrophysiological activity and class II (beta-blocking) effects with use of in vitro and in vivo models. Structure-activity relationships are discussed for a series of 30 compounds. A number of these compounds prolonged the action potential duration at 95% repolarization of isolated canine cardiac Purkinje fibers by 20% (C20APD95) at concentrations of less than 1.0 microM, with no significant effects on cardiac conduction. beta-Adrenergic receptor binding studies showed that some of these compounds were 2-20 times more potent for cardiac beta 1 receptors than for beta 2 receptors. In particular, compounds 32, 41, 1, and especially (S)-1 were found to be orally active class III agents in anesthetized mongrel dogs (1 or 3 mg/kg, id) and efficacious at suppressing programmed electrical stimulation induced arrhythmias in halothane-anesthetized dogs. The profile of these compounds was similar to that found for sotalol. Compound (S)-1, which was more potent than sotalol in the PES study and equieffective in the halothane/epinephrine dog model, is being investigated further as a combined class III/II antiarrhythmic agent.", 
    "54": "Hyperactivity of the noradrenergic sympathetic system is one of the essential \"compensatory\"mechanisms in chronic left ventricular failure. The ensuing stimulation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors results in an increase of heart rate and contractility which, to some extent, counterbalances the alteration of left ventricular function, but rapidly reaches its limits: the excessive shortening of diastoles and, mostly, the increase of myocardial oxygen demand neutralize the beneficial haemodynamic effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation, especially when ischaemia is the cause of the heart failure; the chronic exposure of adrenergic receptors to noradrenaline in high concentrations leads to desensitization, to a \"down regulation\" which primarily affects the beta 1 receptors and spares, at least partly, the myocardial beta 2 receptors which seem to play a quantitatively important inotropic role, particularly in chronic heart failure. These new data on the physiology of the cardiac noradrenergic system have major therapeutic consequences: in practice, the positively inotropic beta-stimulants can only be used for a short period in acute episodes of heart failure; - the use of beta-blockers in low doses is now considered in the treatment of some forms of heart failure; the mechanism of their therapeutic action remains controverted, and their long-term effectiveness in a large patient population is under study; - a new pharmacological class, beta-adrenoceptor partial agonists, seems to give satisfactory clinical and haemodynamic results in mode-rate heart failure, A wider clinical evaluation is needed to determine the therapeutic role of theses new pharmacodynamic agents.", 
    "55": "Eltoprazine (DU 28853) inhibits offensive aggressive behaviour in several animal species. We characterized the binding of radiolabelled eltoprazine in rat brain by autoradiography. [3H]Eltoprazine displayed saturable and high-affinity binding to several brain areas, including the basal ganglia, hippocampal formation and cerebral cortex (Kd values ranging from 4.2 to 9.5 nM). The maximal binding capacities (Bmax) for [3H]eltoprazine were similar to those for [3H]5-HT and were highest in the substantia nigra and subiculum. Competition with eltoprazine for [3H]ligand binding to the various 5-HT1 receptor subtypes revealed preferential binding to 5-HT1A (IC50 values ranging from 42 to 50 nM) and 5-HT1B (IC50 values ranging from 25 to 38 nM) recognition sites. The drug had moderate affinity for 5-HT1C sites (IC50 = 282 nM). Addition of GTP or its stable analogue Gpp(NH)p to the radioligand assay caused a marked reduction (50-90%) in both [3H]eltoprazine and [3H]5-HT binding. These effects were substantially less in the choroid plexus. The binding of the antagonist (-)[125I]Iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) to 5-HT1B recognition sites, as quantified in the subiculum and substantia nigra, was either unaltered or slightly enhanced by the addition of 10(-3) M GTP. Furthermore, GTP did not affect the competition for [125I]ICYP binding by the 5-HT1-antagonist methiothepin, whereas it did significantly reduce the displacement by eltoprazine, resulting in an almost twofold increase in IC50 values. The data indicate that the anti-aggressive drug eltoprazine preferentially binds to 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor sites and that this interaction is modulated by guanine nucleotides.", 
    "56": "To facilitate functional and mechanistic studies of receptor-G protein interactions, [corrected] the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor (h beta-AR) has been expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This was achieved by placing a modified h beta-AR gene under control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. After induction by galactose, functional h beta-AR was expressed at a concentration several hundred times as great as that found in any human tissue. As determined from competitive ligand binding experiments, h beta-AR expressed in yeast displayed characteristic affinities, specificity, and stereoselectivity. Partial activation of the yeast pheromone response pathway by beta-adrenergic receptor agonists was achieved in cells coexpressing h beta-AR and a mammalian G protein (Gs) alpha subunit-demonstrating that these components can couple to each other and to downstream effectors when expressed in yeast. This in vivo reconstitution system provides a new approach for examining ligand binding and G protein coupling to cell surface receptors.", 
    "57": "A cDNA coding for an allelic variant of rat IID1, designated IID1v, was isolated that produced a P-450 having a 10-fold lower catalytic activity toward the substrate bufuralol when expressed in COS-1 cells (Matsunaga, E., Zanger, U. M., Hardwick, J. P., Gelboin, H. V., Meyer, U. A., and Gonzalez, F. J. (1989) Biochemistry, 28, 7349-7355). IID1 and IID1v cDNA-deduced proteins differed in sequence by 4 amino acid residues. IID1 has Val, Phe, Arg, and Leu while IID1v has Ile, Leu, Gln, and Phe at amino acid positions 123, 124, 173, and 380, respectively. Chimeric cDNAs between IID1 and IID1v were constructed and expressed in hepatoma cells using vaccinia virus. A chimera having the Phe (IID1v) at amino acid 380, with the remaining 3 variant amino acid residues of IID1, was found to have a 17-fold decrease in Vmax and a 2 to 3-fold decrease in Km for (+)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation when compared to a converse chimera having Ile (IID1) in a background of IID1v sequence. Although this enzyme lacked significant bufuralol metabolism, it was able to carry out debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation. In contrast, the chimera having Ile (IID1) at position 380 was lacking in debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation. Type I difference spectra analysis revealed that both forms could bind debrisoquine with similar spectral dissociation constants. These data demonstrate that the single amino acid substitution Ile380----Phe differentially decreases the catalytic activity of IID1 toward bufuralol but not debrisoquine.", 
    "58": "The antagonist carazolol has been used as a fluorescent probe for the binding site of the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR). The fluorescence properties of carazolol are dominated by the emission of the carbazole group, with the fine structure of the spectrum, but not the quantum yield, sensitive to the environment of the probe. The fluorescence emission spectrum of the bound probe is consistent with an extremely hydrophobic environment in the binding site of the receptor. Binding of carazolol to the purified beta AR increases the polarization of the fluorophore. Exposure to collisional quenchers has demonstrated the bound carazolol to be completely inaccessible to the solvent. Furthermore, the fluorescence of bound carazolol is not quenched by exposure to sodium nitrite, a F\u00f6rster energy acceptor which has an R0 value of 11.7 A with carazolol. Thus, physical analysis of the binding site of the beta AR by carazolol fluorescence indicates that the antagonist binds to the beta AR in a rigid hydrophobic environment which is buried deep within the core of the protein.", 
    "59": "The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of 40 mg of the beta-blocker penbutolol (Betapressin TM; Hoechst Ltd., Frankfurt/Main) in comparison to placebo on the insulin consumption on the blood sugar profile in twelve insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) patients. The patients were treated with penbutolol and placebo for a period of three days, and then were examined with the help of the glucose-controlled insulin infusion system. The blood sugar profile and insulin consumption over a 24 hour period was not affected by either penbutolol or placebo, nor could any changes be measured in these parameters when measured after food intake. After a submaximal exercise load on the bicycle ergometer (1 watt per kg body weight) following an evening meal, no difference could be observed between penbutolol and placebo in the above-mentioned parameters. The same was also true for hormonal parameters as STH, ACTH, cortisol, and catecholamines. These findings demonstrated that medication of penbutolol over a three-day period has no influence on the baseline blood sugar profile and insulin consumption or on insulin consumption after food intake during rest and physical exercise.", 
    "60": "Whereas i.v. administration of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) to support dogs increased heart rate and decreased systemic blood pressure, sinus rate and contractile force increased in isolated right atria perfused with blood from the support dogs. VIP injected intraarterially into isolated atria induced dose-dependent positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Intracardiac parasympathetic nerve stimulation attenuated the positive cardiac responses to VIP, but neither propranolol, imipramine, nor tetrodotoxin influenced the responses to VIP. VIP given to isolated left ventricles also increased the contractile force in a dose-dependent manner. However, VIP induced a greater maximum atrial contractility than ventricular contractility. This may indicate that VIP receptor density in the ventricle was lower than in the atrium, as it has recognized that VIP-ergic nerves innervate the right atrium more densely than the left ventricle. We therefore suggest that the positive cardiac responses to VIP, together with the VIP-ergic innervation in dog hearts and vagal activation, attenuate the VIP-mediated responses at site(s) in the cyclic AMP cascade.", 
    "61": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with triiodothyronine (100 micrograms/100 g/day) for 2, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days and the biochemical and ultrastructural changes of the brown adipose tissue were investigated. Results showed that the tissue weight, DNA and phospholipid content increased very early (by day 2 or 4) and that triglycerides increased later. These hormonal effects are not inhibited by the beta 1-antagonist propranolol. From the morphological point of view, triiodothyronine administration induced the early proliferation and maturation of adipocyte precursors (interstitial cells and preadipocytes). It is concluded that triiodothyronine administration causes a very early hyperplasia in the brown adipose tissue similar to that observed during exposure to cold by mechanisms that may not be secondary to the involvement of norepinephrine.", 
    "62": "1. Effects of single doses of captopril (12.5, 25 and 50 mg) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and on body sway were studied in fourteen healthy male subjects. Oxazepam (15 mg), as an active control, and two placebos were included in the study, together with a single dose of atenolol (100 mg). Medication was administered double-blind at 11.00 h, and assessments made before and at 2 and 4 h after drug ingestion. 2. There were no changes in the EEG with captopril. Oxazepam reduced the circadian rise in alpha activity, while atenolol decreased beta power. Delta activity was modified by both oxazepam and atenolol. 3. A reduction in lower frequencies of body sway (0.05-1 Hz) occurred with captopril, while the spectra were unaffected by oxazepam. Atenolol increased (P less than 0.05) activity in the frequency range 0.75-2.75 Hz. 4. These observations suggest that captopril is free of central effects such as sedation that may occur with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Reduced body sway with captopril could reflect improved integration of central and peripheral control of posture.", 
    "63": "1. Central effects of single doses of captopril (12.5, 25 and 50 mg) were studied in fourteen healthy male subjects. Two placebos and an active control drug, oxazepam (15 mg), were included, together with a single dose of atenolol (100 mg). The drugs were administered double-blind at 11.00 h, and performance and subjective feelings were assessed before and from 1.5-2.5 h and 3.5-4.5 h after ingestion. 2. Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, together with critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. Subjects assessed their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analogue scales. 3. Captopril did not impair performance on any of the tests, but improved short-term memory (P less than 0.05) and increased the number of letters cancelled (P less than 0.05). Oxazepam reduced the number of substitutions completed in the digit symbol test (P less than 0.01), accuracy on continuous attention (P less than 0.05), number of letters cancelled (P less than 0.05), and rate of finger tapping (P less than 0.05), and increased choice reaction time (P less than 0.001). Atenolol reduced the rate of finger tapping (P less than 0.05), but increased the number of letters cancelled (P less than 0.05). 4. No effects on mood or on subjective feelings were evident with captopril. Oxazepam reduced subjective alertness (P less than 0.05), and atenolol increased feelings of sleepiness (P less than 0.05). 5. Although these observations suggest that central effects may exist with captopril, no adverse consequences have been established on performance or on subjective assessment of mood. Captopril may, therefore, be an appropriate drug for hypertensive patients engaged in skilled activity.", 
    "64": "The study was undertaken to examine 221 patients with unstable angina (UA) in the acute period and repeatedly on average of 5.3 years later. Myocardial infarction and sudden coronary death were regarded as unfavorable outcomes of UA. Out of all the patients included into the study, 33 (15%) developed myocardial infarction on days 2-28 of hospital stay, which resulted in death in 7 patients; 6 more patients died suddenly. The hospital mortality rate was 5.8%. Of 175 patients discharged from the unit, 31 developed myocardial infarction in the late period, 1 case ended with a fatal outcome, sudden coronary death was observed in 32 cases. The mortality rates by years were the following: 10.2% within the first year, 17.4% for 3 years, and 28.2% for 5 years. The choice of a complex of initial signs mostly significant for defining the risk for complications with the use of Cox's model of proportional risks indicated that the outcome of UA was affected by the following significant factors: 1) ST segment depression in the leads V4-V6; 2) duration of aggravated condition; 3) duration of coronary heart disease; 4) the number of resting anginal episodes; 5) a patient's fitness on his admission to hospital; 6) a history of arterial hypertension; 7) negative T waves in the leads V4-V5.",

IOP changes in response to levobunolol and to changes in position were significant (p less than 0.0001). However, pressure rises relative to position were not significantly different in eyes treated with drug vs placebo. Levobunolol did not alter relative changes in IOP from changes in body position.

If the resting diastolic pressure exceeded 95 mmHg after four weeks of treatment the dose(s) were doubled for a further four weeks. Initial sitting blood pressures were 187 +/- 21/105 +/- 5 mmHg in the nifedipine group and 181 +/- 19/106 +/- 6 in the atenolol group. At four weeks, eight patients given nifedipine and nine given atenolol had their doses doubled. At eight weeks sitting blood pressures were 159 +/- 19/85 +/- 7 and 162 +/- 21/87 +/- 8 respectively, with 18/20 patients given nifedipine and 16/21 given atenolol having a sitting diastolic pressure equal to or less than 95 mmHg. One patient given nifedipine was withdrawn because of unacceptable ankle oedema and one given atenolol withdrawn because of worsening angina. Both drugs were equally acceptable to the patients and neither caused a change in their sense of well-being.", 
    "67": "A multicentre randomised double-blind trial was performed in order to compare the therapeutic efficacy and acceptability of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril with those of atenolol in mild to moderate hypertension. After one month of placebo, 173 patients with supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 125 mmHg were randomised to receive perindopril 4 mg once daily or atenolol 50 mg once daily. Monthly assessments were made for three months. Treatment was adjusted at these visits if supine DBP was greater than 90 mmHg; the dose was first doubled (8 mg perindopril or 100 mg atenolol once daily) and then hydrochlorothiazide was added. The pretreatment blood pressure levels were similar in both groups. Supine DBP was 105.5 +/- 0.9 mmHg (n = 85) in the perindopril group and 106.9 +/- 0.9 mmHg (n = 88) in the atenolol group. At the end of the third month, the study target blood pressure (supine DBP less than or equal to 90 mmHg) was achieved in a significantly (P = 0.006) larger percentage of patients in the perindopril group (78%) than in the atenolol group (58%). This appeared to be due to a greater potentiation of the antihypertensive effect by the addition of diuretic to perindopril than to atenolol. The fall in systolic blood pressure was significantly greater in the perindopril group than in the atenolol group (supine: 26.5 +/- 2.0 mmHg vs. 20.6 +/- 2.0 mmHg; P = 0.042) although the fall in DBP was comparable (supine: perindopril 17.4 +/- 0.9 mmHg, atenolol 15.6 +/- 1.1 mmHg; P = 0.195).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "Interogan variation in tissue distribution of weakly basic drugs such as quinidine, propranolol, and imipramine was investigated as a function of binding to phosphatidylserine (PhS) in tissues. Tissue distributions of these drugs were determined using 10 different tissues at a steady-state plasma concentration and were expressed as tissue-to-plasma partition coefficients (Kp values). The concentration of PhS in the tissue was determined by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. Plotting of Kp values, except for brain, against the tissue PhS concentrations showed a linear relationship, indicating that PhS is a determinant in the interorgan variation of these tissue distributions. Further, differences in tissue distribution among the drugs was considered to be due to the difference in binding potency to PhS. Drug binding parameters to individual standard phospholipid were determined using a hexane-pH 4.0 buffer partition system. Binding was highest to PhS, and a linear relationship was found between the log nK [product of the number of binding sites (n) and the association constant (K) for PhS binding] obtained in vitro and Kp values of drugs in tissues in vivo. The empirically derived equation, Kp = 14.3 x (log nK) x (PhS conc.) - 8.09, was found to predict Kp values in vivo of weakly basic drugs. Thus, a determinant of interorgan variation in the tissue distribution of the weakly basic drugs studied was the tissue concentration of PhS and the drug binding affinity to PhS.",

Similar to the human results, this difference was due to a stereoselective renal clearance (mL/min/kg) in favor of S(-)-AT [14.9 +/- 5.78, S(-)-AT; 13.0 +/- 4.88, R(+)-AT; p less than 0.05].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Fifty-one patients had coronary artery disease with a previous myocardial infarction and there were 17 patients without coronary disease: 11 patients had right and/or left ventricular dysplasia, one patient an aortic-valve replacement, and five patients had no visible heart disease. Prior to sotalol patients were treated with a mean of 3.6 +/- 1.3 antiarrhythmic class I drugs. None of these drugs prevented SMVT or VF. During control PVS (PVS 1), VF was induced in 8 patients (12%), SMVT in 47 patients (69%), and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in 13 patients (19%). After loading with oral d,l-sotalol (320 mg/day), PVS (PVS 2) was repeated 4.2 +/- 3.3 weeks after PVS 1. In one of the patients (1%) VF was inducible, in 15 patients (22%) SMVT was induced, and in 18 patients (26%) NSVT was induced. In 34 patients (50%) either no or a short ventricular response was inducible. Our data show that oral d,l-sotalol is an effective antiarrhythmic agent in patients with SMVT or VF.", 
    "72": "The effects of noradrenaline (NA) and acetylcholine (ACh) on 90 paraventricular neurons from 31 hypothalamic slices prepared from rat were observed. After perfusing the brain slices with NA (10(-6) mol/L, 3 min), discharge rate of 14/73 (17%) nonphasic and 7/12 (58.3%) phasic neurons was significantly increased, while that of 10/73 (12%) nonphasic and 2/12 (16.6%) phasic neurons was significantly decreased, even ceased. 50/73 (64%) of the nonphasic and 3/12 (25%) of the phasic neurons were non-responsive. The effects of NA on the nonphasic neurons were completely blocked by alpha receptor blocker phentolamine. The effects of NA on phasic neurons were partly blocked by phentolamine or propranolol (beta receptor blocker). After perfusing hypothalamic slices with ACh (10(-7) mol/L, 3 min), the firing rate of 15/73 (19%) nonphasic and 6/12 (50%) phasic neurons was increased, while that of 9/73 (11%) nonphasic and 2/12 (16.6%) phasic neurons was decreased. 54/73 (69%) nonphasic and 4/12 (33.3%) phasic neurons were non-responsive. The effect of ACh on the neurons could be reversed by atropine. The effect of scopolamine (M blocker) is similar to that of atropine. The experimental results suggest that the excitatory or inhibitory effect of NA or ACh on paraventricular neurons has mediated respectively by alpha, beta or M receptors.", 
    "73": "In a double blind cross-over study, 28 patients, 5 male and 23 female, aged 31 +/- 14 years, after a run-in period of 8 weeks, were treated for 3 months with acetylsalicylic acid and for another 3 months with metoprolol, both in a prophylactic mode. Attack frequency was reduced significantly with both therapeutic regimens (ASA p less than 0.001, metoprolol p less than 0.00005). Reduction of attacks below 50% was seen with metoprolol in 14 cases, and with ASA in three cases. Even though ASA was of statistically significant efficacy in migraine prophylaxis, it clearly is not the drug of first choice in migraine prophylaxis.", 
    "74": "Propranolol is an established agent in migraine prophylaxis. Uncontrolled studies have suggested an action in the acute attack. We present the first double-blind placebo controlled study of propranolol in 27 unselected patients with common (migraine without aura) and classical (migraine with aura) migraine. There were 23 pairs of headaches in the 14 patients who completed the study. No difference was found, when the data were analysed by headache pair or by patient, in severity duration and subjective assessment of efficacy between those treated in an attack with propranolol 40 mg and placebo.", 
    "75": "Under conservative stomatological treatment the behaviour of peripheral stress parameters is investigated in connection with an estimation of the subjective state of health as well as for the first time in the ambulatory stomatology the STH secretion as an expression of a central stress reaction. The possibility of the central nervous as well as cardiovascular influence by an unusual premedication form of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent \"Obsidan\" is estimated in various stages of treatment in comparison to a placebo application.", 
    "76": "In order to evaluate the effects of one-year antihypertensive treatment on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, 65 patients whose diastolic blood pressure was in the range 95-120 mmHg were randomly allocated to groups that received either hydrochlorothiazide or metoprolol, or both drugs when the response to one of them was insufficient to control blood pressure. Blood pressure was effectively reduced in all groups. Patients on hydrochlorothiazide showed a significant increase (P less than 0.01) in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after 3 months of treatment. A significant increase in triglycerides was observed after 6 and 12 months, together with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) after 12 months (P less than 0.05) of treatment in patients on metoprolol. In patients treated with both hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol, total cholesterol increased after 3 (P less than 0.001) and 6 months (P less than 0.05), triglycerides increased after 6 (P less than 0.01) and 12 months (P less than 0.01), and LDL-C increased after 3 (P less than 0.05), 6 (P less than 0.001) and 12 months (P less than 0.01) of treatment, respectively. In 61% of the patients, three or more lipid parameters were affected during the study period. We conclude that long-term antihypertensive treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and particularly with both drugs, can induce lipid effects that deserve recognition, because in some cases these might counteract the possible benefit of a reduction in blood pressure on the prevention of coronary heart disease.", 
    "77": "Forty-one patients admitted with first episode of bleeding from esophageal varices were enrolled in a trial of the efficacy of oral propranolol to prevent rebleeding during the course of endoscopic sclerotherapy until obliteration. Single-blind randomization to sclerotherapy alone or with propranolol was used. At monthly endoscopy the varices were injected with 1% Aethoxysclerol until obliteration. If bleeding recurred, additional sclerotherapy was given. There was no intergroup difference in time to eradication of varices (8.1 vs. 7.7 months). The cumulative number of bleedings from varices and from distal esophageal ulcerations was identical in the two study groups. Five patients in the control group but only one in the propranolol group died of bleeding in the study period, a difference of only borderline significance (chi 2 = 4.08, df = 1). There were no specific side effects of propranolol. Thus propranolol did not significantly reduce the frequency of rebleeding until variceal obliteration, but could have had some influence on the gravity of rebleeding.", 
    "78": "1. Standard microelectrode techniques were used to investigate the influence of N-ethylmaleimide on the action potential, slow response action potential and force of contraction of guinea-pig papillary muscles. 2. N-ethylmaleimide, 3 x 10(-5) to 10(-4) mol l-1, concentration-dependently increased the force of contraction. The positive inotropic effect developed quickly and, with the largest drug concentration, was followed by a progressive decline of the contractile force. The action potential duration was progressively shortened by N-ethylmaleimide. 3. The effects of N-ethylmaleimide were not prevented in the presence of tetrodotoxin 3 x 10(-8) mol l-1 and propranolol 4 x 10(-6) mol l-1 or by a reduction of the Na(+)-concentration to 70 mmol l-1. 4. Verapamil, 10(-6) mol l-1, reduced the positive inotropic, but not the action potential shortening effect of N-ethylmaleimide. 5. In K(+)-depolarized muscles in the presence of propranolol and tetrodotoxin, N-ethylmaleimide 10(-4) mol l-1 increased the maximum depolarization velocity and the duration of the slow response action potential. The latter effect was transient and was followed by a progressive reduction of the action potential duration. 6. The most likely explanation for the action potential shortening effect of N-ethylmaleimide seems to be an increase of an outward potassium current while the transient inotropic effect of the drug may be caused, at least in part, by an increase of the slow inward calcium current.", 
    "79": "Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol at concentrations of 5.5 x 10(-8) M were found to elicit lipolysis in a cell-free system containing lipid droplets from fat cells and lipase solution. In the cell-free system, the beta-blockers propranolol and dichloroisoproterenol at concentrations of 1 microM inhibited lipolysis induced by norepinephrine, whereas similar concentrations of the alpha-blockers phenoxybenzamine and yohimbine did not inhibit lipolysis. The binding of norepinephrine to endogenous lipid droplets was inhibited by propranolol, but not by phenoxybenzamine. We concluded that the propranolol-sensitive, phenoxybenzamine-insensitive binding of norepinephrine to endogenous lipid droplets is involved in lipolysis in fat cells. Treatment of endogenous lipid droplets with phospholipase C, but not phospholipase D, trypsin, chymotrypsin, or neuraminidase, inhibited the propranolol-sensitive binding of norepinephrine to the droplets. These results suggest that the phosphate group of phospholipid in endogenous lipid droplets may be the site of propranolol-sensitive binding of norepinephrine. The physiological significance of the propranolol-sensitive binding is discussed.", 
    "80": "Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure responses to nonsignal auditory stimuli were measured in rats after saline or pharmacological blockade of the sympathetic or vagal innervation of the heart. HR responses to the low-intensity stimulus were predominantly deceleratory, whereas responses to the high-intensity stimulus were more notably acceleratory. Both stimuli elicited a biphasic pressor-depressor response, although potential baroreflex influences accounted for only a small proportion of the HR response variance. Deceleratory responses to the low-intensity stimulus were eliminated by scopolamine and thus appeared to be predominantly of vagal origin. Acceleratory response to the high-intensity stimulus appeared to be mediated primarily by sympathetic activation because it was substantially attenuated by the beta 1 antagonist atenolol. Furthermore, HR responses to the low-intensity stimulus appeared to reflect coactivation of both sympathetic and vagal systems.", 
    "81": "Traumatic microhyphema is an entity encountered in emergency rooms and general ophthalmology practices. The management of traumatic microhyphema has not been well defined in the literature. We discuss the effectiveness of our treatment regimen and the incidence of rebleed in patients with microhyphema.", 
    "82": "The genotoxic potential of the beta-adrenergic blocker penbutolol was assessed using the Ames and HGPRT tests, unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) and alkaline elution assays. In the Ames test, penbutolol was tested for cytotoxicity and genotoxic activity in concentration ranges of 0.8-500 micrograms/plate and 0.1-125 micrograms/ml in the HGPRT, UDS and alkaline elution assays. In the Ames test penbutolol showed significant toxicity above 500 micrograms/plate. In the mammalian cells (V79) used for the HGPRT test and A459 cells used for alkaline elution and UDS assays, penbutolol was cytotoxic at concentrations above 30 micrograms/ml. In another series of experiments, male Wistar rats were treated i.p. with penbutolol (1, 10 and 100 mg/kg) and after 2 h liver nuclei were isolated and formation of single DNA-strand breaks was measured. The results of the present study demonstrate the absence of genotoxic activity of penbutolol in the 5 strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538) and in the strain of Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. In V79 cells, penbutolol showed no mutagenic effects at the HGPRT locus in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Additionally, no significant incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA in the UDS test or formation of DNA-strand breaks in the alkaline elution assay was detected in the non-toxic concentration range of penbutolol with or without metabolic activation. Furthermore, penbutolol did not cause DNA damage in liver nuclei isolated from penbutolol-treated rats.", 
    "83": "The cardioselective beta-blocker atenolol and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were compared for efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life factors in 30 patients with hypertension whose hypertension was inadequately controlled with diuretic alone. Atenolol (50 to 100 mg once a day) and enalapril (2.5 to 40 mg once a day), combined with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once a day), had similar levels of efficacy and safety. A comprehensive battery of psychologic assessments for quality of life was administered, including measures of anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, memory, and psychomotor function. These five conceptually based clusters were first analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance procedures, followed by univariate analyses of the individual variables composing each domain. In general, neither atenolol nor enalapril was associated with major changes in psychologic functioning. The only data cluster with a statistically significant change was memory function, primarily as a result of lower scores of the digit span (backward) test, for atenolol relative to enalapril. These preliminary findings suggest that atenolol and enalapril have comparable degrees of efficacy and safety, with no major disparities in quality-of-life effects, for hypertensive patients with a history of taking diuretics and this sort of quality-of-life assessment can be performed during trials of antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "84": "The relationship of left ventricular systolic function and heart rate to serum l-propranolol concentrations was determined in 10 healthy male volunteers during maximal exercise treadmill testing. Peak aortic blood flow acceleration (ACL), measured by Doppler ultrasonography, was used to evaluate left ventricular systolic function. Repeated exercise testing was performed on two separate days after long-term oral administration of 40 mg propranolol or placebo every 6 hours in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. Pharmacodynamic relationships were determined by fitting percent change in ACL and heart rate at maximal exertion with 1-propranolol with the Emax model (maximal effect) and nonlinear regression. Reductions in systolic function and heart rate during exercise were related directly to 1-propranolol. Propranolol was significantly (p less than 0.05) more potent in reducing heart rate (EC50, 10.6 +/- 9.2 ng/ml) compared with ACL (EC50, 19.2 +/- 8.9 ng/ml). However, Emax of propranolol for reducing ACL was significantly greater than that for reducing heart rate (-46.7% +/- 6.9% versus -29.5% +/- 15.9%; p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the concentration-effect relationship for 1-propranolol and its negative inotropic effect differ from its negative chronotropic effect.", 
    "85": "Enantio- and diastereoselective aspects of oxidative metabolism of metoprolol (1) were examined in the presence of rat liver and human liver microsomes using a pseudoracemate of 1, made up of equal molar (2R)-1-d0 and (2S)-1-d2, as substrate. Both O-demethylation and alpha-hydroxylation showed only slight enantioselectivity, 2R/2S ratios being 1.18 and 0.93 for these pathways in rat liver microsomes and 1.09 and 0.92 in human liver microsomes. In the presence of the rat liver microsomal fraction, alpha-hydroxylation yielded predominantly the 1'R-hydroxy product, 1'R/1'S ratio greater than 12, regardless of the stereochemistry of the side chain. In humans (extensive metabolizers) administered a single 50 mg oral dose of pseudoracemic metoprolol tartrate, urinary alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (2) accounted for 9.3 +/- 2.4% of the dose, 2R/2S ratio 0.85 +/- 0.14, and the carboxylic acid metabolite 4, accounted for 52.7 +/- 6.8% of the dose, 2R/2S ratio 1.15 +/- 0.09. The data suggested that preferential O-demethylation of the (2R)-enantiomer of 1 could contribute to the 2S greater than 2R plasma ratio of metoprolol enantiomers observed in this population."
