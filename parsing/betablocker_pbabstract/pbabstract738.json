    "0": "A method for the determination of propranolol and six of its metabolites, as well as their glucuronide and/or aryl sulfate conjugates in human urine is described. Propranolol and its basic and neutral metabolites are extracted into ether at pH 9.8, evaporated to dryness, reconstituted, separated on a reversed-phase, high-pressure liquid chromatographic system and quantitated using fluorescence detection. The aqueous urine aliquot is then made acidic and the acid metabolites extracted and measured using similar methods. The presence of 2% sodium metabisulfite in all urines collected is essential to ensure the stability of 4-hydroxy-propranolol during collection and storage. Preliminary data is presented from 24-h urine samples collected from three patients chronically receiving propranolol.", 
    "1": "1. Plasma propranolol concentrations were measured in healthy old and young subjects following single oral doses of 40 mg, single i.v. infusions of 0.15 mg kg-1 and after nine 40 mg oral doses given four times daily. 2. In each of the three studies, the elderly had higher plasma propranolol concentrations than the young despite having similar apparent volumes of distribution. 3. The terminal half-life of propranolol was similar in the two groups after oral propranolol but significantly shorter in the young after intravenous dosing (P less than 0.05). 4. The bioavailability assessed from the concentration-time curves after i.v. and oral dosing was greater in the elderly (P less than 0.05). 5. The differences between peak concentrations observed in old and young subjects after single oral doses were maintained during chronic therapy and there was a correlation between the individual values obtained on multiple therapy with that after a single dose (P less than 0.05). 6. Ageing appears to affect the pharmacokinetics of propranolol in two ways. Firstly, distribution to the tissues appears to be slowed. Secondly, the increased bioavailability following oral administration suggests diminished intrinsic clearance by metabolism.", 
    "2": "The pharmacodynamic effect of propranolol (80 mg b.i.d.) on the renal and systemic circulation was studied after 1 and 8 months of treatment in 13 patients with essential hypertension, using non-invasive radioisotope techniques. Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) fell from (mean +/- S.E.M.) 244 +/- 18 to 208 +/- 14 after 1 month and to 187 +/- 13 ml/min.m2 after 8 months of treatment. Concomitantly cardiac index (CI) fell from 3.24 +/- 0.15 to 2.62 +/- 0.11 and 2.75 +/- 0.10 l/min.m2, respectively. The coefficient of correlation between the decreases in ERPF and CI was 0.49. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 138 +/- 5 to 118 +/- 5 and 116 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively. Left ventricular work was reduced by 30.2 and 27%, while peripheral resistance was unchanged. Total plasma volume was increased from 19.3 +/- 0.5 to 20.3 +/- 0.6 ml/cm after 1 month, but was within the same range as the control values after 8 months of treatment. Pulmonary plasma volume was unchanged, indicating that there was no pooling of plasma in the pulmonary circulation. The interventricular circulation time was increased from 6.9 +/- 0.4 s to 8.4 +/- 0.3 s and varied with the change in heart rate. It is concluded that the fall in ERPF might be explained by reduced cardiac output in addition to interference with the hemodynamic autoregulation in the kidney.", 
    "3": "Kinetic studies of the metabolism of alprenolol were performed with isolated microsomes from the rat, guinea-pig, dog and man at an initial substrate concentration of 0.17--150 micrometer. In all species the rate of aromatic hydroxylation reached a plateu above 50 micrometer of alprenolol in contrast to the rate of desisopropylation, where consistent saturation level was not obtained. The Km-values for the aromatic hydroxylation in the guinea-pig and man, 2,7 micrometer and 1.3 micrometer respectively, showed no concentration dependency in contrast to the rat (Km1 = 0.20 micrometer, Km2 = 26 micrometer) and the dog (Km1 = 0.78 micrometer, Km2 = 66 micrometer). The apparent Km-value of 0.20 micrometer for aromatic hydroxylation in the rat seemed to be of the same order of magnitude as reported spectral dissociation constant (Ks = 0.34 micrometer). In vivo experiments in the rat by oral administration of 7--700 mu mol/kg demonstrated a dose-dependent presystemic elimination of alprenolol. The urinary excretion of hydroxy-alprenolol was significantly lower after the highest dose. It is proposed, that the saturation of the aromatic hydroxylation, catalyzed by a high affinity site or subspecies of cytochrome P-450 with a low capacity, contributes to the dose-dependent kinetics in vivo.", 
    "4": "A preoperative patient with pheochromocytoma was satisfactorily treated with oral labetalol, while a conspicuous increase in urinary output of catecholamines (CA) and of vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) was observed after labetalol therapy. Exaggerated increases in urinary CA and in VMA were also confirmed in normal volunteers immediately after oral labetalol. These effects of labetalol on urinary CA and VMA, however, were proved to be largely due to the interference with the usual photometries rather than due to its stimulation of CA release. Therefore, it should be emphasized that clinical evaluations of CA and its metabolites must be performed before labetalol therapy to avoid an erroneous diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.", 
    "5": "The renal effects of the beta-adrenergic blockers, propranolol, practolol and butoxamine, were examined in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. All the beta-blockers, infused i.v., increased urine volume (V), urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) and p-aminohippuric acid clearance without change in inulin clearance. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis, did not affect the renal effects of these beta-blockers. Phentolamine abolished the renal effects of practolol, but not those of propranolol and butoxamine. Haloperidol abolished the renal effects of propranolol and butoxamine, but not those of practolol. A high correlation was found between the increased UNaV and the increased urinary phosphate excretion by butoxamine but not by propranolol and practolol. Therefore, it is suggested that alpha-adrenergic stimulation is involved in the mechanism of diuresis by practolol, a beta1-blocker, and that dopaminergic stimulation is involved in the diuresis caused by butoxamine, a beta2-blocker. Propranolol is similar to butoxamine, and partially similar to practolol.", 
    "6": "The effect of intravenous acebutolol versus saline solution on frequent premature ventricular complexes was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized study in 20 patients, including 3 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Frequent premature ventricular complexes were abolished or reduced by 75% or more in none of 12 patients given saline solution but in 18 of 20 patients (90%) given acebutolol (P less than 0.001). This therapeutic effect of acebutolol persisted for at least 2.5 hours in 17 of 20 patients (85%), for at least 3.5 hours in 14 (70%) and for at least 4 hours in 8 (40%). Acebutolol was well tolerated by the three patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These data indicate that intravenous acebutolol is useful in the treatment of premature ventricular complexes.", 
    "7": "Five patients, age 3 weeks to 11 years, presented with supraventricular tachycardia that remained uncontrolled following adequate digitalization. Four of these patients underwent invasive electrophysiologic studies to determine the mechanism of the arrhythmias. Of these four patients, three had concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and one patient had evidence of dual A-V nodal pathways. Propranolol was added to the medical treatment and was administered orally in doses ranging from 7 to 14 mg/kg/day (average 9 mg/kg/day). All five children remain free of their tachycardia except for one patient who occasionally has supraventricular tachycardia with febrile illnesses. No adverse reactions to these high doses of propranolol were encountered.", 
    "8": "The effect of the use of the so-called heparin lock for blood sampling on the binding of propranolol has been studied and a cumulative dose-response curve to heparin constructed. The use of this method of blood sampling introduced considerable artifactual changes into the measurement of propranolol's plasma binding. The free fraction rose from 9.9% to 13.4% after only 50 U of heparin was used to flush the cannula. The increase in the free fraction of propranolol showed excellent correlation with the increase in free fatty acid levels (p less than 0.001, r = 0.996). The importance of ensuring that sampling techniques do not introduce artifactual changes in pharmacokinetic studies is emphasized.", 
    "9": "Propranolol may be uniquely useful in cardiac surgical procedures, since beta adrenergic blockade can prevent the hypokalemia and associated arrhythmias which result from systemic hypothermia. To determine the effects of hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (HCPB) on the in vivo handling of propranolol, serial drug plasma concentrations (Cp) were measured during HCPB in 12 patients who had been treated chronically with propranolol prior to surgery. Although no further propranolol was given during the procedure, Cp values (corrected for plasma volume dilution) were higher during hypothermia than in the preoperative period, falling to or below control levels after rewarming. Due to the variables inherent in patient surgery, meaningful kinetic analysis could not be carried out. Therefore, intravenous propranolol (1 mg/kg) was given twice to each of 5 dogs, first after anesthesia only, then after anesthesia and systemic cooling to 26 degrees in a water bath Cp values measured serially over 2 hr after drug administration were consistently higher during hypothermia. Compared with the paired normothermic control studies, hypothermia markedly reduced the apparent volume of distribution (6.78 +/- 1.65 vs 2.08 +/- 0.58 L/kg; p less than 0.001) and the total body clearance of propranolol (64.4 +/- 11.0 vs 32.3 +/- 7.2 ml/kg/min; p less than 0.005). These data show that hypothermia substantially alters the pharmacokinetics of propranolol, resulting in plasma drug levels higher than those predicted from kinetic patterns derived under normothermic conditions.", 
    "10": "We studied the relative rates of release of active and inactive renin by the kidney in anesthetized pigs. Renin concentration was determined in arterial and renal venous plasma as follows: (1) before and after stimulation of renin release with isoproterenol or furosemide, (2) after suppression of renin release by extracellular fluid volume expansion, and (3) after administration of propranolol or indomethacin. Inactive renin was activated by dialysis of plasma at pH 3.3 for 24 hours. Renin concentration was estimated by radioimmunoassay determination of angiotensin I after a 3-hour incubation with excess homologous renin substrate. Following isoproterenol, the release of active renin increased from 8 +/- 4 (SEM) to 58 +/- 34 ng/min, and inactive renin increased from 53 +/- 33 to 321 +/- 136 ng/min. Similarly, furosemide stimulated the release of both active and inactive renin. Both forms of renin were suppressed by propranolol or indomethacin. Although changes in renin release following volume expansion were not statistically significant, the direction of change for both forms of renin was similar. Following logarithmic conversion of the rate of release, the plot of active vs. inactive renin formed a straight line. Values for active renin as a percentage of the total renin in simultaneously drawn arterial and renal venous plasma samples were not different. Thus, under the conditions of these experiments, release of active and inactive renin appears to be controlled by similar mechanisms. Both stimulation and suppression of renin release result in parallel changes in release of the two forms. Data on relative amounts of active renin in arterial and renal venous plasma suggest that there is no systemic conversion of the two forms.", 
    "11": "In conscious renal-hypertensive dogs (one kidney Grollman type) oral administration of 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid-bis-(2-propoxyethyl)-ester (niludipine, Bay a 7168) (1 and 3 mg/kg) produced a rather prompt fall of blood pressure and an increase in heart rate. With 3 mg/kg p.o. of niludipine a fall of blood pressure was marked at its peak effect attained about 45 min after dosing and lasted about 3 h. Prior administration of propranolol (30 mg/kg p.o.) greatly prevented an increase in heart rate accompanying the fall of blood pressure produced by 3 mg/kg p.o. of niludipine but was of no effect on the antihypertensive action. These results, taken together with previous results indicating niludipine to have a potent coronary vasodilator action, suggest that niludipine will be useful as an antihypertensive drug, especially when hypertension is associated with ischemic heart disease or when the reduction of blood pressure is urgent. Combined use of niludipine with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent is recommended.", 
    "12": "Effects of beta-receptor blockade by oxprenolol, which significantly prevented subendocardial necroses during hemorrhagic shock in dogs, on shock tolerance and myocardial function were analyzed. Overall mortality was not altered by beta-receptor blockade. Cardiac output and contractility (dp/dtmax) before, during and after a hypovolemic period of 120 to 210 min with mean arterial pressure = 40 +/- 5 mmHg showed no significant difference with or without oxprenolol treatment. Increase of heart rate during hemorrhage was abolished completely by oxprenolol and as a consequence of this duration of the diastolic filling period was about three times longer (p less than 0.001) and stroke volumes were greater. Stress metabolism was improved. Hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis were diminished and arterial oxygen tension was higher in the treated group. Incidence of lethal ventricular fibrillation was higher and pulsus alternans found only in the control group. The beneficial effects of beta-receptor blockage on the course of hemorrhagic shock are explained by the prevention of the catecholamine induced tachycardia and thereby increased coronary perfusion and decreased myocardial oxygen consumption and by the intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity of oxprenolol.", 
    "13": "The beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol had in itself no notable influence on the blood glucose level in rats, but in combination with chlorpropamide it considerably delayed and enhanced the hypoglycaemic and liver glycogenolysis depressing actions of chlorpropamide. This effect was still more pronounced when the rats were treated in addition to propranolol and chlorpropamide with thyroxine or glanduitrine, which in themselves act as stimulators of liver glycogenolysis. The simultaneous administration of propranolol and chlorpropamide depressed considerably the liver glycogenolysis induced by prolonged fasting and inhibited completely the liver glycogenolysis observed after hepatectomy. The reports available in the literature on propranolol-precipitated hypoglycaemia in patients are surveyed and it is supposed that the beta-adrenergic blocking agent produces hypoglycaemia primarily through the depression of liver glycogenolysis. This observation supports the hypothesis that the adrenergic beta-receptors play an important role in the sympathetic control of liver glycogenolysis.", 
    "14": "Direct effects of 5-(3-tert.-butylamino-2-hydroxy) propoxy-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril hydrochloride (carteolol) on chronotropic and inotropic activity were investigated in seventeen isolated atrium preparations which were suspended in a bath and perfused with arterial blood from the heparinized donor dog. Carteolol has little adrenergic beta-receptor stimulating effect in doses which block prominent positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of norepinephrine. At relatively larger doses, however, carteolol produced a long-lasting positive chronotrophic and inotropic effect. At extremely larger doses, carteolol produced a negative inotropic effect with little or slight negative chronotropic effect. In propranolol-treated preparations, carteolol induced less positive effects. Propranolol-induced negative chronotropic and inotropic effects were significantly reduced by treatment with carteolol. From these results, carteolol has not only potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking property but also sympathomimetic activity, and different beta 1-type cardiac adrenergic receptors may probably be suggested.", 
    "15": "In the present paper physico-chemical and analytical studies on penbutolol sulfate (Hoe 893d) are reported. In addition to an interpretation of ultraviolet and fluorometric spectra, data are given regarding the dissociation constant, solubility, distribution, and protein binding. The substance and its major metabolte, as well as their glucuronides, are detectable by means of a selective fluormetric method. Moreover, mention is made of the results of a human pharmacokinetic study.", 
    "16": "The effect of a selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonist on histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion was studied in conscious gastric-fistula dogs. A dose-dependent inhibition was found, most pronounced for the lowest doses of histamine. The inhibition was on the volume, whereas the acidity was unchanged. The pulse rate was increased by the beta2-agonist and by histamine. Propranolol prevented the inhibition of acid secretion as well as the increase in pulse rate. Practolol had no effect on the inhibition of acid secretion but reduced the increase in pulse rate. Dose-response experiments with six doses of histamine and two doses of the beta2-agonist showed unchanged calculated maximal response and an increase in D50. It is concluded that the beta2-agonist inhibits histamine-induced acid secretion in the dog, but to a lesser degree that pentagastrin-induced acid secretion, as found in earlier experiments. The inhibition follows competitive kinetics, and beta2-receptors are probably involved. The influence of beta2-sympathomimetics on the mechanism of gastric acid secretion is discussed.", 
    "17": "Autonomic nervous control of heart rate (HR) during hypoxia was studied longitudinally using 9 chronically catheterized fetal lambs (109 day to term) and 10 newborn lambs (2--28 days old). Changes in heart rate (deltaHR) during hypoxia were age-dependent. Before 120 days of gestation deltaHR was insignificant, but between 120 days to term bradycardia occurred. The newborn response was marked tachycardia. Autonomic influences on HR were quantified using atropine and propranolol blockade. In fetal lambs, antagonistic increases in parasympathetic and sympathetic outflows were evident during hypoxia. In hypoxic lambs 120 days to term, net bradycardia reflected predominant parasympathetic cardio-deceleration; before 120 days of gestation both the parasympathetic and sympathetic outflows increased, but no net deltaHR occurred. In hypoxic newborn lambs, sympathetic and parasympathetic changes contributed synergistically to the net tachycardia. Thus the pattern of autonomic control of HR during hypoxia differs in fetal and newborn lambs. Changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic influences are antagonistic in the fetus, but synergistic in the newborn.", 
    "18": "The inhibitory properties of beta-2-thienyl-dl-alanine on rat phenylalanine hydroxylase from crude liver and kidney homogenates were assessed in vitro and in vivo, as well as its effects on the intestinal transport of phenylalanine, by using a perfusion procedure in vivo. The apparent K(m) for liver phenylalanine hydroxylase changed from 0.61mm in the absence of the inhibitor to 2.70mm in the presence of 24mm-beta-2-thienyl-dl-alanine, with no significant change in the V(max.). For kidney the corresponding values were 0.50 and 1.60mm respectively. A single dose of beta-2-thienyl-dl-alanine (2mmol/kg) failed to inhibit phenylalanine hydroxylase in either organ. Repeated injections during a 4-day period caused a decline of the enzymic activity to about 40% of controls. Intestinal absorption of phenylalanine when perfused at 0.2-2.0mm concentration was also competitively inhibited by beta-2-thienyl-dl-alanine. Its K(i) value was estimated at 81mm. The limited inhibitory effects of beta-2-thienyl-dl-alanine towards hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase and phenylalanine intestinal transport, and its rapid metabolism, as suggested by the small elimination of this compound in the urine and its virtual absence from animal tissues, are factors that restrict its potential usefulness as an inducer of phenylketonuria in rats or as an effective blocker of phenylalanine absorption by the gut.", 
    "19": "Autorhythmometry of blood pressure by an individual over an age-span of 67 to 72 years showed a strong circadian rhythm superimposed upon significant circaseptan and circannual rhythms. Automatic BP monitoring with an Arteriosonde throughout 24-hour spans on 4 separate occasions, before and during treatment, also indicated a prominent circadian BP rhythm and a treatment-related reduction in circadian mesor. The concept of a blood pressure mesor reference for the antimesor-hypertensive treatment constitutes a valuable guideline in the control of \"familial\" mesor-hypertension.", 
    "20": "A method for monitoring therapeutic levels of the beta-blocking and antiarrhythmic drug propranolol in serum has been developed as a high performance liquid chromatography technique using bonded nitrile columns in a reverse phase mode with an aqueous methanol mobile phase containing acetate as a counterion. The performance characteristics of eight different types of reverse phase columns are discussed with evaluation for use in the method. The present method combines basic organic (cyclohexane) extraction with fluorescence detection of the chromatographic effluent to provide a specific, rapid, precise, and reliable technique that has been successfully used to monitor propranolol metabolites or other drugs. The method is shown to compare well with other methods and is suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring by routine clinical laboratories.", 
    "21": "The onset of DOCA-salt hypertension in male Sprague-Dawley rats was prevented during 11 weeks of oral treatment with indapamide (0.5, or 10.0 mg/kg) or propranolol (60 mg/kg) administered in the diet. The body weights of the indapamide treated groups were significantly (P < 0.01) greater, at weeks 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11, while the body weights and food intake of the propranolol treated group were significantly (P < 0.05) lower at week 11, than the control group. A significant reduction in heart wet weight (P < 0.001) was measured in the indapamide treated animals only. No significant diuresis nor natriuresis was measured in any group during week 11 of treatment. When all groups were subjected to an increased salt load, four weeks after cessation of drug treatment only the indapamide (10 mg/kg) treated animals failed to show an increased blood pressure. Vascular reactivity studies carried out six weeks after termination of drug treatment, indicated a significant (P < 0.01) reduction in pressor activity elicited by electrical stimulation of the entire sympathetic outflow in indapamide (10 mg/kg) treated pithed rats. No significant difference in the pressor activity elicited by noradrenaline (5 x 10(-8) - 5 x 10(-6) g/kg, i.v.) or tyramine (10(-5) - 5 x 10(-5) g/kg i.v.) was observed in any treatment group. In conclusion, chronic oral treatment with indapamide or propranolol, prevented the onset of DOCA-salt hypertension in rats. A long lasting antihypertensive action of indapamide involving the sympathetic nervous system is also indicated.", 
    "22": "Cardiovascular complications of severe tetanus are essentially represented by cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. An excess of catecholamines is responsible for these complications. Tetanus toxin causes indeed a sympathetic overactivity which is due partly to a central stimulation and partly to a peripheral one. All that means the best treatment of cardiovascular complications of tetanus is represented by adrenergic blocking agent.", 
    "23": "Fifty nine patients suffering from slight or moderate essential arterial hypertension underwent hypotensive treatment. After one week of wash-out, therapeutic administration of tienilic acid in doses of 500 mg per day was begun; in the third week we combined a non diuretic hypotensive drug (prazosin, propranolol, alfametil-dopa). At the beginning of the study all patients underwent an ECG, a clinical cardiological examiniation, funduscopy examination, funduscopy examination, a heart X - ray in 3 standard positions and a routine blood test which was repeated during and at the end of the treatment. The patients' blood pressure taken in an upright and supine position, showed statistically significant reductions for both systolic and diastolic values in all 3 groups, whereas the routine blood tests gave evidence of a marked reduction in the uriacid, triglycerides and potassium levels. In order to correct the latter we had to administer high oral doses of potassium, and in one case admittance to hospital was necessary since the potassium level was lower then 2.5 mEq/l.", 
    "24": "Morphological studies of the heart muscle were carried out in healthy rats as well as treated with hydralazine or binazine after administration of adrenaline, noradrenaline, isoprenaline, regitine or propranolol. Hydrazinophtalazines (25 mg/kg body wt, daily) were given during 7 months. After discontinuation of this treatment the drugs were administered during 15 days. Evident changes (e.g. inflammatory infiltrations, focal necrosis and fibrosis) were found after administration of noradrenaline, adrenaline or isoprenaline. No differences were found in the reactivity to catecholamines in healthy and hydrazinophtalazine-treated rats.", 
    "25": "EEG changes as well as the mechanisms of the hyperglycaemic effect of triethyltinsulphate (TET), a compound known to induce brain oedema, were investigated in cats and rabbits, respectively. Considerable EEG alterations characterized by slow waves appeared in some minutes after TET administration. The hyperglycaemic effect of TET like that of epinephrine could be prevented by the administration of 1 mg/kg of the beta blocker, pindolol. It is suggested that the hyperglycaemic effect of TET is brought about by sympathetic activation.", 
    "26": "Topically applied bupranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, has been shown to have a marked effectiveness in lowering the intraocular pressure of the normal and glaucomatous eyes. The effects were not only seen in the treated eyes but also in the untreated, contralateral eyes. The contralateral response was independent of the ongoing diurnal variation of the intraocular pressure. Instillation of the drug into the nasal cavity induced decrease of the intraocular pressure in both eyes, the extent of which was comparable to the contralateral response induced by ocular instillation. These observations suggest that the contralateral response is caused by systemically absorbed drug, probably due to the action on the central locus regulating the intraocular pressure. Instillation of pilocarpine did not show any similar contralateral response.", 
    "27": "The effect of combined treatment with an oral beta-blocking agent (propranolol tablets 40 mg twice a day) and a local alpha- and beta-agonist (epinephrine eyedrops twice a day) was studied in 10 healthy volunteers. Propranolol was given in a double-blind randomized manner, while adrenalin was given unmasked. Propranolol and adrenalin proved to have an additive reducing effect on the intraocular pressure. The effect of propranolol alone was stronger than that of adrenalin.", 
    "28": "Acebutolol at therapeutic dosage may considerably disturb the determination of urinary 17-oxosteroids by Zimmerman's reaction. This interference, very variable according to the various technics which may be used, depends mainly on the pH of the urine at the time of extraction. In very acid medium (pH less than 1,5) no acebutolol metabolite passes into the solvents of low polarity; in very alkaline medium, (pH greater than 13) the passage la quantitative. The estimation of 17-oxost\u00e9roids in the presence of acebutolol, is possible provided the extraction is carried out in sufficiently acid medium, such as that used for hydrolysis in presence of hydrochloric acid. This is moreover the procedure used for classical methods were no interference is observed. The selective estimation of acebutolol and of its metabolites may be carried out simply by Zimmerman's reaction, after extraction at pH 13 of non-hydrolysed urine, thanks to the absence of conjugated derivatives.", 
    "29": "Rates of isolated embryonic chick hearts (ECH) and embryonic rat hearts (ERH) of various ages were maintained constant by field stimulation and the characteristics of their inotropic responses to isoproterenol (Iso) were investigated. Exposure to Iso produced concentration, age, species and calcium dependent increases in contractility that were prevented by propranolol (3x10(-6) M). The slopes of the linear portions of the concentration-response curves increased with age (14-20 days) in the ERH, the maximal slope and inotropic effect being observed in the 18-day-old heart, whereas they decreased with age (3-7 days) in the ECH, the minimal slope but maximal inotropic effect being observed in the 5-day-old heart. At 10(-7) M, Iso produced approximately maximal responses at all ages in the ECH but elicited only minimal responses at all ages in the ERH, approximately ten times this concentration being required to produce maximal responses in the ERH. Reducing the calcium concentration of the bathing medium significantly increased the sensitivities of the hearts of both species to the inotropic effects of Iso. Iso-induced positive inotropic responses were also demonstrated in isolated, driven ventricles from 4-day-old ECH. These results indicate that functional, beta-adrenergic, inotropic receptors are present in the embryonic hearts of both species and undergo changes in responsiveness during embryonic development which are species-dependent.", 
    "30": "The hypotensive effect of Timolol eye drops (0.25 and 0.50%) in maintenance treatment of 64 patients with elevated intraocular pressure has been studied. The patients were treated for a period of mean 13 months. In 44 patients mostly comprising ocular hypertensives, a significant reducation in IOP (32%) could be maintained with Timolol alone (P less than 0.001). In patients with a high starting baseline pressure of previous maladjustable glaucoma it was necessary to start combined treatment. Pilocarpine, epinephrine or acetazolamide appeared to have additive pressure-lowering effect to Timolol. A significant correlation was present between pre-treatment and Timolol treated intraocular pressures. Thus a pre-treatment IOP above 25 mmHg may indicate a critically hypotensive effect below an IOP of 20 mmHg with Timolol alone. No significant interfernce with visual acuity, pupullary size, blood pressure, or pulse rate was noted. Existing visual field defects in three patients were slightly aggravated and in four patients, with a pathological optic disc, visual field loss developed. In seven patients transient sensations of dry eyes and rose-bengal staining dots on the cornea developed.", 
    "31": "The blood levels of propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene, three components of a new antihypertensive combination, Dociteren, were studied in patients with mild hypertension after single dosage. The blood levels of propranolol in the combination did not differ from the blood levels obtained after a single dose of propranolol given alone.", 
    "32": "A multi-centre, open study was carried out in 140 hypertensive patients to investigate the hypotensive effect of 2 tablets of a fixed combination of 100 mg metoprolol plus 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide when taken either once-daily or twice-daily, each for 4 weeks. Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements were taken at rest, during and after exercise, on entry and at the end of each treatment period. The mean resting blood pressures were 168/108 mmHg, 151/98 mmHg and 150/96 mmHg at pre-trial, after the twice-daily dosage period and after the once-daily dosage period, respectively. The corresponding figures for exercise blood pressure were 191/115 mmHg, 176/105 mmHg, and 174/102 mmHg. Few side-effects were reported. It is concluded that once-daily dosing with this combination product is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for mild to moderate hypertension throughout the full 24-hour period.", 
    "33": "The effect of single i. v. dosis of propranolol, 1.5 mg/kg of body weight, on the oxidative processes in rabbit myocardium at the mitochondrial level was investigated. Analyses were carried out at minutes 0 and 15 after intravenous infusion of propranolol. Under the influence of propranolol the mitochondrial oxygen uptake was reduced. This finding reveals the metabolic background of the antianginal effect of propranolol. Simultaneously, however, the mitochondrial metabolic efficiency was negatively affected, as manifested by decreases in mitochondrial respiration control, oxidative phosphorylation, and phosphorylation rate. The described changes signalize a disturbance in myocardial energy production and represent a subcellular metabolic background of potential myocardial damage during administration of propranolol.", 
    "34": "The effects of a single daily dose of 100 mg. of atenolol and an equivalent dose of propranolol were compared during a crossover, 15 day blind trial in a group of young labile hypertensives. Arterial pressure, heart rate, systolic time intervals and the carotid pulse upstroke time, recorded by external non-invasive procedures, were measured before and 4 and 8 hours after the last dose of both drugs. Both beta blocking agents significantly reduced and stabilized the arterial BP and the heart rate to normal values. However, a tendency to return to abnormal values was observed 8 hours after propranolol administration. Both drugs provoked an increase in the pre-ejection period, but with propranolol this increase was related to a larger isovolumetric contraction time, pointing to a negative inotropic action. The carotid pulse upstroke time was increased to normal values with atenolol. Propranolol failed to alter this value. Atenolol in a single oral daily dose is recommended in the treatment of labile hypertension.", 
    "35": "A study is presented on the effectiveness of timolol maleate in the treatment of 76 cases of various types of glaucoma. Timolol lowered intraocular pressure significantly in almost every diagnostic category, although there was marked variability within the diagnostic categories themselves. The therapeutic trial approach is suggested as an aid in selecting persons who will respond adequately to timolol drops.", 
    "36": "Data from clinical records of patients using timolol confirm the ocular hypotensive effect of the drug in secondary glaucoma, aphakic glaucoma, ocular hypertension, and when used in combination with various other forms of glaucoma therapy. No serious local or systemic side effects were noted. Although many adrenergic agents ultimately produce tachyphylaxis, this effect is infrequent in timolol therapy.", 
    "37": "The effect of short-term administration of timolol on the permeability of the corneal endothelium to fluorescein was measured in normal subjects (single drop) and in a small group of glaucoma patients (one week's treatment). No effect on the endothelium was found in the normal eyes. In the glaucomatous eyes, endothelial permeability was higher than normal when measured after one week without topical medications and normal when measured after one week on timolol treatment. No evidence was found that short-term administration of this drug disturbs the barrier function of the endothelium.", 
    "38": "The authors present a case of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) in an almost fatal relapse with quadriplegia, bulbar paralysis and coma. Intravenous hematin produced an immediate arousal from coma and allowed a gradual resumption of bulbar and autonomic functions. Persistent tachycardia and hypertension necessitated huge doses of intravenous propranolol. Both hematin and propranolol administrations were followed by a remarkable decrease in urinary amino-levulinic acid and porphobilinogen excretion. Nevertheless, after the acute stage, the patient was left with a severe generalized muscle wasting. After 7 months of intensive physical therapy, complete recovery of all neuromuscular functions was achieved. The modern aspects of the management of AIP are presented; the efficacy and the limits of hematin and propranolol therapy are discussed.", 
    "39": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out in 10 hypertensive patients who were subject to frequent attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon and suffered from cold hands, to assess the peripheral vasoconstrictor effects of penbutolol. After a wash-out period of 2 weeks on placebo, patients received two 14-day treatment periods, in random order, with either 20 mg penbutolol twice daily or placebo separated by a second 2-week single-blind wash-out period on placebo. The results of digital blood flow measurements showed that penbutolol did not produce any additional vasoconstrictor effect on digital circulation. The significance of these findings is discussed.", 
    "40": "1 Fourteen hypertensive patients were studied by intra-arterial BP monitoring to quantify the effects of standardized physiological stresses: Valsalva manoeuvre, isometric, treadmill and bicycle exercise, and 60 degree tilting before and after labetalol treatment. 2 The dose of labetalol ranged from 100--600 mg three times daily and the response was judged on outpatient clinic recordings. 3 The drug produced a sustained reduction of BP and heart rate responses during dynamic exercise and the Valsalva manoeuvre, but the degree of change from the lowered baseline were not changed by labetalol. The fall in BP on cessation of exercise was decreased rather than increased. 4 The response to controlled isometric muscle contraction was affected in a similar fashion. 5 Tilting produced a fall in BP after treatment, and this was most marked in those patients on the highest doses. However, compensatory increases in diastolic BP were observed.", 
    "41": "1 Fifteen patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction and systemic BP of greater than 160/110 mmHg were treated with an incremental infusion of labetalol. 2 Systemic BPs were safely and effectively lowered to less than 130 mm Hg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic in all pateints. 3 Heart rate, mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure cardiac index and stroke work index were significantly reduced. 4 The dose of labetalol varied from 30 mg--440 mg and was significantly higher (mean 295 mg) in those patients with pre-existing systemic hypertension compared with others (mean 133 mg). 5 No side-effects occurred and all patients survived to leave hospital.", 
    "42": "1 The circulatory effects of labetalol have been studied in 88 patients undergoing plastic surgery, 8 patients with carcinoma of the breast, 10 with carcinoma in the head and neck, and in 2 patients with phaeochromocytoma, each anaesthetized twice. 2 The use of labetalol intravenously produced hypotension and a bloodless operating field in patients undergoing plastic surgery and in those undergoing radical surgery for the removal of carcinoma. 3 Two patients with phaeochromocytoma pre-treated with oral labetalol before anaesthesia, had well controlled BPs and heart rates during surgery, although in one instance additional intravenous labetalol was required. 4 Pre-operative preparation of patients with phaeochromocytoma with labetalol seems to be simpler and safer than previous techniques involving drugs with separate alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-blocking effects.", 
    "43": "1 Nineteen pregnant patients whose mean arterial pressure (MAP) was persistently greater than or equal to 103.3 mmHg were given labetalol or methyldopa. 2 Singificant falls (P less than 0.001) in BP only occurred in the group treated with labetalol, and daily BP control was better in this group. 3 Two severely hypertensive patients were successfully treated with intravenous labetalol. 4 There was a higher incidence of spontaneous labour in the labetalol group and a significant difference (P less than 0.05) in the Bishop score of the cervix between the two groups. 5 There were no apparent detrimental effects on the foetus antenatally, during labour or post partum. 6 Slight breathlessness in one patient treated with labetalol was the only side-effect observed but drowsiness, headache and postural hypotension were reported in patients receiving methyldopa.", 
    "44": "1 Labetalol, a hypotensive agent combining alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist properties, was used to treat severe hypertensive disease complicating pregnancy. 2 Effective reduction in BP was achieved in all but 3 of the 25 patients treated. Careful monitoring of feto-placental function was undertaken to ensure the maintenance of fetal well-being. Maternal and fetal side-effects were minimal and it was not necessary to discontinue the drug in any patient. 3 Labetalol was estimated in the cord blood of the fetus at delivery as well as in the breast milk of mothers on day 3 post partum. There were no adverse effects of the drug on the infants and significant hypotension did not occur. 4 The reults suggest that labetalol has a direct action on fetal lung maturation and this, together with its effective hypotensive effect, contributes to the low perinatal mortality (3.5%) observed. 5 Oculotoxicity due to the labetalol was not observed in the infants delivered. 6 It is concluded that the efficient hypotensive action of labetalol, together with apparent freedom from maternal and fetal side-effects, and consequent improved perinatal mortality, suggest that it is a suitable drug for use in pregnancy complicated by hypertension.", 
    "45": "1 In nine hypertensive subjects with angina pectoris, labetalol diminished the incidence of chest pain occurring spontaneously or induced by exercise. 2 Labetalol lowered BP in all subjects. 3 Exercise tolerance at maximum levels was increased by labetalol. 4 Improved cardiac function by labetalol may be related to decreased afterload on the left ventricle, and diminished oxygen utilization by the myocardium.", 
    "46": "1 Diazoxide 300 mg and labetalol 150 mg were each injected intravenously on separate occasions into five patients with essentail hypertension. The reduction in BP caused by labetalol was slightly greater than that produced by diazoxide. 2 In contrast the reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) by labetalol was not statistically significant, whereas diazoxide gave a greater and statistically significant reduction in CBF. 3 These observations suggest that labetalol may have an advantage over diazoxide for the rapid reduction in BP.", 
    "47": "1 Six previously untreated emergency admissions to hospital with severe hypertension were given oral treatment with labetalol. 2 Pre-treatment diastolic BP exceeded 130 mmHg, and clinical evidence of either accelerated hypertension or encephalopathy was present. 3 Hypotensive response after treatment followed two patterns. 4 Quick-responders (n = 3) showed a sharp fall in BP to normal levels within 2 h, which was subsequently sustained for 10 or more hours. The daily dose of labetalol eventually required to achieve good BP control in this group was relatively low: 600--1200 mg. 5 Slow-responders (n = 3) showed a gradual, less marked fall in BP, which was sustained for many hours. These patients required further doses of labetalol to reduce BP to normal. The eventual daily dose of labetalol that ensured good BP control was high: 1200--2400 mg. 6 Heart rate was little changed by treatment. 7 Complications or side-effects were not observed.", 
    "48": "1 The effects of labetalol, bethanidine and combined treatment with both drugs were compared in a within-patient randomized cross-over study in mild essential hypertension. Attention was directed to whether or not labetalol and bethanidine differed in their pattern of effect on arterial BP and whether evidence of synergism was apparent. 2 At the doses used labetalol significantly lowered systolic and diastolic BPs and heart rate lying, sitting, standing and after exercise. The dose of bethanidine used did not affect heart rate significantly while lowering systolic and diastolic BPs only after exercise and less clearly on standing. Combined treatment lowered BPs on standing and after exercise and heart rate after exercise. 3 The type and frequency of side-effects were similar with bethanidine and labetalol but were much less with combined treatment. 4 No evidence of synergism was observed.", 
    "49": "1 Thirty-two hypertensive patients have been treated with labetalol for periods of up to 7 years. 2 Ten patients observed for 6 years from time of stabilization of dosage, did not show any tolerance to labetalol. 3 Postural and exercise hypotension were not seen in these patients over this prolonged follow-up, although they were seen in other patients given over 2 g labetalol daily.", 
    "50": "1 The pharmacokinetics of labetalol were studied in twelve hypertensive patients, ten of whom were not receiving other therapy. 2 Following intravenous administration there was a three- to fourfold variation in terminal elimination half-life, volume of distribution and total plasma clearance. The mean elimination half-life was 3.25 hours. 3 Following oral administration the drug was absorbed rapidly. Systemic availability varied from 11-86% (mean 33%). 4 Plasma levels correlated poorly with the acute effect on BP, raising the possibility of labetalol acting in a deep tissue compartment or alternatively an active metabolite contributing to its effect.", 
    "51": "1 Mean steady-state plasma concentrations of labetalol (labetalol Css) in 17 hypertensive patients undergoing chronic treatment with this drug, have been examined in relation to dose, fall in BP, and beta-blockade. 2 A significant relationship (rs = 0.81, P less than 0.001) was observed between labetalol Css and daily dose. 3 No correlation was found between labetalol Css and antihypertensive response. 4 In thirteen patients, there seemed to be significant relationship between labetalol Css and beta-blockade (rs = 0.72, P less than 0.005). In three patients, the degree of beta-blockade was disproportionate to the drug concentration.", 
    "52": "1 The efficacy of labetalol in the treatment of severe hypertension (diastolic greater than or equal to 115 mm Hg) was studied retrospectively. Ten patients were followed for more than 6 months. At 6 months, eight were well controlled and the mean dose in those was 975 mg daily. Four of these were receiving labetalol alone; two were on labetalol and diuretic only. 2 Three patients were resistant to doses of 1600, 1800 and 2400 mg daily respectively; two of these were controlled with increased doses of vasodilator drugs. In two cases labetalol had produced large falls in the standing BP while not influencing the supine BP. 3 Three other resistant patients were seen, of whom one merely required an increase in dose to 2200 mg daily and the addition of a diuretic. Both the others were elderly, had severe vascular disease, and suffered disabling postural hypotension on a dose of labetalol which did not influence the supine BP. 4 Labetalol can control severe hypertension. There remain patients whose supine BP is not influenced by a dose of labetalol which produces marked postural hypotension.", 
    "53": "1 Labetalol was given to 41 hypertensive patients in a divided dosage of 150--2,400 mg daily for periods ranging from 1--64 months. 2 Monotherapy with labetalol was adequate in 12 out of 19 patients with essential hypertension and in 15 out of the 22 with renal hypertension. 3 Following a single dose of labetalol 200 mg orally a hypotensive response was seen between 1.5 and 2 hours. 4 In the doses used there was no exercise or postural hypotension. 5 No reduction in overall renal function attributable to labetalol was seen.", 
    "54": "1 The hypotensive action of labetalol was evaluated during 24 h by continuous intra-arterial ambulatory monitoring in 14 patients. The dose used ranged from 300--1800 mg daily. 2 The drug caused a significant reduction of systolic BP in 19 and diastolic BP in 20 of the 24 h of monitoring. Heart rate was also reduced but less markedly than BP. 3 The rapid early morning increase in BP was also effectively controlled. 4 The mild pre-waking increase in BP was not significantly reduced. 5 Labetalol treatment reduced the variation in systolic BP from the lowest observed quarter-hourly mean as compared with pre-treatment values. 6 The quarter hourly mean values were consistently smooth and revealed no sudden variations which might have resulted from postural hypotension.", 
    "55": "1 The effect of an intravenous bolus of labetalol (0.6--1.6 mg/kg body weight) on central and peripheral haemodynamics was studied in nine subjects with essential hypertension and in eleven subjects with chronic renal disease and hypertension. 2 The BP reduction amounting to 20/13 mmHg was entirely due to the lowering of the total peripheral vascular resistance. This also included the vascular resistance in the muscles. 3 This peripheral vasodilatation was not counteracted by a reflex increase of the cardiac output. 4 The reflex tachycardia and overshoot of BP in Valsalva's manoeuvre were largely abolished. 5 Central and peripheral venous BPs, vascular volume of the forearm and venous distensibility did not show any significant change after treatment with labetalol. 6 In spite of the lowering of the vascular resistance of the forearm by labetalol, forearm blood flow was not significantly affected due to the parallel decrease in the perfusion pressure. 7 Plasma renin activity fell after labetalol in all instances.", 
    "56": "Nine ski-jumpers from the Finnish Olympic team were given 40 mg of oxprenolol or placebo on a cross-over double-blind basis when participating in four internal competitions. Six ski-jumpers improved their performances when on oxprenolol. The improvement was mainly seen in the lengthening of the jumps. The tachycardia, apparently evoked by the emotional and physical strain associated with the actual jump, approached rather extreme levels (up to 170 beats/min) immediately after landing. The enhancement in the heart rate was effectively prevented by a gentle beta-blockade. The most common unwanted effect recorded was numbness in the legs after climbing up to the tower platform, reported 9 times out of 18 possible occasions after oxprenolol but never after placebo. The fact that three of the jumpers (out of 9) performed worse when on oxprenolol makes the toxic/benefit ratio (1:2) unacceptably high for the medication.", 
    "57": "The effects of catecholamines (CA) and certain related compounds in the superfusate were examined on the intracellularly recorded potential from horizontal cells in the fish (Eugerres plumieri) retina. The stimulated retinal area consisted of a central spot 1.0 mm in diameter and an annulus 2.0 mm in inner diameter and 4.0 mm in outer diameter; both forms of monochromatic stimuli were centered relative to the recording microelectrode. Each of the CA (dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline) produced an analogous effect on the hyperpolarizing response of all types of horizontal cells. The depolarizing response of the C (R/G)-type cells was found to change variably with the CA. The effect of dopamine (DA) among the CA was most pronounced when they were used at an equivalent amount. With 10--50 microM, the action of DA was variable but in general its effect was to increase slightly both center and surround responses. In some cases, however, DA initially augmented the surround and reduced the center response. Large amounts of the CA (100--200 microM) augmented the center response and attenuated the surround response considerably; these reciprocal changes usually were associated with moderate depolarization of the cells (5--10 mV). Recovery then occurred in 15--20 minutes. These results indicate that the CA, up to a certain amount, do not directly affect the transmission from photoreceptors to horizontal cells, since the center response became larger. At the same time, the lateral propagation of an S-potential appears to be selectively affected by the CA, suggesting that the adrenergic system participates in this phenomenon. When an excess of these compounds (200-500 microM) was given, the cells were rapidly depolarized to near 0 MV and eventually the light-induced responses were abolished. Large amounts (5--10 mM) of metabolic products of the CA (DOPAC and VMA) were found to reduce the center response slightly more than the surround. alpha-Methylnoradrenaline, 5-hydroxydopamine, and serotonin also caused the same but less effect on horizontal cells as did DA. Reserpine and clonidine mimicked the CA effect only if these compounds had been preceded by repeated applications of one of the CA or if the retina had been pretreated with Marplan. Propranolol, haloperidol, and apomorphine affected neither the horizontal cell membrane potential nor the CA effect. However, phentolamine in large amounts (500 microM) markedly diminished the DA action. Therefore, alpha-adrenergic receptors appear to be involved in the CA-induced changes observed in the horizontal cell response.", 
    "58": "A multicentre, open study of general practice patients with essential hypertension who were currently being treated with oxprenolol and cyclopenthiazide was undertaken in which the patients were transferred to Trasidrex for 12 weeks. Weight, blood pressure, heart rate and side-effects were assessed pre-trial and at 4-week intervals. A global assessment was also made at the same time intervals. The mean serum potassium remained virtually unchanged after 12 weeks treatment with Trasidrex. Blood pressure control was marginally improved during the study and it is thought possible that better patient compliance might explain this. Trasidrex was tolerated equally as well as the free combination.", 
    "59": "Five dialysis patients with residual hypertension were treated with a new sustained-release formulation of propranolol (160 mg per capsule) in a dosage of 1 to 2 capsules per day. Four of these patients developed persistent cold, numb, blue and clumsy fingers. The symptoms resolved when the drug was withdrawn.", 
    "60": "A study was carried out to evaluate the long-term effects and side-effects of a combination product containing the beta-blocker pindolol (10 mg) and the diuretic clopamide (5 mg) in 15 patients with moderate hypertension. All patients completed the 2-years' study. The dose of the combination was increased until blood pressure normalized or a maximum dose of 3 tablets (equivalent to 30 mg pindolol and 15 mg clopamide) daily was reached. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded monthly and detailed medical examinations were done regularly throughout the study. A mean dose of 2 tablets of the combination product (20 mg pindolol and 10 mg clopamide) produced a significant reduction in blood pressure. In all but 1 patient, blood pressure control was achieved and maintained. No tolerance developed. Heart volume showed a marked decrease. No side-effects of clinical importance were noted.", 
    "61": "The effect of acetylcholine (Ach) on smooth-muscle strips isolated along the transversal axis of cat lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is studied. Ach in low concentrations (10(-11)--10(-9) g/ml) causes contraction of the muscle strips. Increase of the concentration to 10(-8) g/ml leads to biphasic effect: contraction with relaxation. Inhibitory response predominates at Ach 10(-6) and 10(-5) g/ml. Atropine (10(-6) M) eliminates the excitatory phase but it has no effect on the second relaxation phase. Propranolol (10(-6), 2 X 10(-6) M) as well as phentolamine turn the inhibitory response to Ach into contraction. Noradrenaline leads to LES contraction while isoprenaline induces relaxation. In smooth-muscle LES strips from cats pretreated with reserpine (1 mg/kg for 3 days), Ach in the concentrations used (10(-5), 10(-6) g/ml) leads to contraction. The changes observed are membrane-dependent -- the contraction is accompanied by depolarization, relaxation by hyperpolarization. The inhibitory effect of Ach on LES smooth muscle is discussed in the light of the hypothesis of Burn and Rand (1960) about the release of noradrenaline under the effect of Ach.", 
    "62": "The acute administration of propranolol or phentolamine resulted in a small (16-19%) but significant reduction in the rate of ethanol disappearance in vivo in the naive Wistar rat. A reduction of essentially similar magnitude was also observed in ethanol-treated rats and pair-fed (sucrose) control animals, following the administration of these blockers.", 
    "63": "17 patients with stable angina pectoris due to coronary occlusive disease had serial graded exercise tests performed while on no medication, after treatment with propranolol and after an 8-week exercise reconditioning regimen while taking propranolol. The patient whose angina-free exercise capacity on beta-blockade is 2.5 METs or greater is likely to benefit from an exercise program."
