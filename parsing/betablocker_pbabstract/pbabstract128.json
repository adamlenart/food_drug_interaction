In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 12 participants, six males and six females, underwent cold pressor-induced sympathetic activation followed by placebo or treatment with 40 mg propranolol. Aerodynamic and acoustic parameters of voice were collected at baseline, during cold pressor and after treatment with propranolol or placebo. Fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, maximum airflow declination rate, voice onset time, speaking rate, and subglottal pressure were measured at baseline, during cold pressor-induced stress, and after treatment with propranolol or placebo. Cardiovascular measures served as indicators of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation by cold pressor and antagonism by propranolol, and were collected during all conditions. Cold pressor appeared to adequately agonize the SNS as indicated by significant increases in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. Propranolol appeared to adequately antagonize the SNS for the participants. Jitter ratio demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the participants treated with propranolol. Speaking rate demonstrated a small but significant increase in the placebo control group during cold pressor. Gender differences were observed in a few measures. Cold pressor adequately agonized and propranolol adequately antagonized the SNS. No statistically significant differences across subjects were observed in the voice parameters during cold pressor-induced stress before treatment. Jitter ratio increased significantly during propranolol treatment and cold pressor. Speaking rate demonstrated a statistically significant increase during cold pressor in the placebo control group. Gender differences were observed, but were few.",

Nonselective beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) antagonists have beneficial effects on hyperdynamic circulation and are in clinical use. In this context, the role of the beta(3)-AR is undefined. Here we investigated their expression and role in portal hypertension in patients and rats with liver cirrhosis. We analyzed cirrhotic human and rat tissues (liver, splanchnic vessels) and primary rat cells. Protein expression of beta(3)-AR was determined by western blot and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Activities of Rho-kinase and the nitric oxide (NO) effector protein kinase G (PKG) were assessed by way of substrate phosphorylation (moesin, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein [VASP]). Cyclic 3',5' adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation was determined by an enzyme-immunoassay kit. The effects of selective beta(3)-AR agonists (CGP12177A, BRL37344) and antagonist (SR59230A) were investigated by collagen matrix contraction of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), in situ liver perfusions, and in vivo hemodynamic parameters in bile duct ligation and carbon tetrachloride intoxication in cirrhotic rats. In cirrhosis of humans and rats, beta(3)-AR expression is markedly increased in hepatic and in splanchnic tissues. Stimulation of beta(3)-AR leads to relaxation of HSCs by way of cAMP accumulation, and by inhibition of Rho-kinase activity; any role of NO and its effector PKG was not observed. beta(3)-AR agonists decrease intrahepatic resistance and portal pressure in cirrhotic rats.",

    "31": "Expression of beta(2)-adrenoceptors (beta(2)-ARs) within the nociceptive system suggested their potential implication in nociception and pain. Recently, we demonstrated that these receptors are essential for neuropathic pain treatment by antidepressant drugs. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the stimulation of beta(2)-ARs could in fact be adequate to alleviate neuropathic allodynia. Neuropathy was induced in mice by sciatic nerve cuffing. We demonstrate that chronic but not acute stimulation of beta(2)-ARs with agonists such as clenbuterol, formoterol, metaproterenol and procaterol suppressed neuropathic allodynia. By using a pharmacological approach with the beta(2)-AR antagonist ICI 118,551 or a transgenic approach with mice deficient for beta(2)-ARs, we confirmed that the antiallodynic effect of these agonists was specifically related to their action on beta(2)-ARs. We also showed that chronic treatment with the beta(1)-AR agonist xamoterol or with the beta(3)-AR agonist BRL 37344 had no effect on neuropathic allodynia. Chronic stimulation of beta(2)-ARs, but not beta(1)- or beta(3)-ARs, by specific agonists is thus able to alleviate neuropathic allodynia. This action of beta(2)-AR agonists might implicate the endogenous opioid system; indeed chronic clenbuterol effect can be acutely blocked by the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole. Present results show that beta(2)-ARs are not only essential for the antiallodynic action of antidepressant drugs on sustained neuropathic pain, but also that the stimulation of these receptors is sufficient to relieve neuropathic allodynia in a murine model. Our data suggest that beta(2)-AR agonists may potentially offer an alternative therapy to antidepressant drugs for the chronic treatment of neuropathic pain.",

We examined the pathophysiologic role of ETB-receptors on ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT/VF) during myocardial infarction (MI). MI was induced by coronary ligation in two animal groups, namely in wild-type (n = 63) and in ETB-receptor-deficient (n = 61) rats. Using a telemetry recorder, VT/VF episodes were evaluated during phase I (the 1st hour) and phase II (2-24 h) post-MI, with and without prior beta-blockade. Action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) was measured from monophasic epicardial recordings and indices of sympathetic activation were assessed using fast-Fourier analysis of heart rate variability. Serum epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured with radioimmunoassay. MI size was similar in the two groups. There was a marked temporal variation in VT/VF duration; during phase I, it was higher (p = 0.0087) in ETB-deficient (1,519 +/- 421 s) than in wild-type (190 +/- 34 s) rats, but tended (p = 0.086) to be lower in ETB-deficient (4.2 +/- 2.0 s) than in wild-type (27.7 +/- 8.0 s) rats during phase II. Overall, the severity of VT/VF was greater in ETB-deficient rats, evidenced by higher (p = 0.0058) mortality (72.0% vs. 32.1%). There was a temporal variation in heart rate and in the ratio of low- to high-frequency spectra, being higher (<0.001) during phase I, but lower (p < 0.05) during phase II in ETB-deficient rats. Likewise, 1 h post-MI, serum epinephrine (p = 0.025) and norepinephrine (p < 0.0001) were higher in ETB-deficient (4.20 +/- 0.54, 14.24 +/- 1.39 ng/ml) than in wild-type (2.30 +/- 0.59, 5.26 +/- 0.67 ng/ml) rats, respectively.

    "48": "Evidence from both animal and human research suggests that the formation of emotional memories is triggered by the beta-adrenergic system. To confirm whether modulation of central beta-adrenergic transmission is specifically involved in the neural signature of memory performance, the pre-encoding effect of propranolol (80 mg) on event-related potentials (ERPs) was measured in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study in 46 male healthy subjects using high density EEG and source imaging analysis during encoding and retrieval (after 1 week) of IAPS pictures of unpleasant, neutral and pleasant contents; for recognition 90 old pictures were randomly mixed with 90 new pictures. During retrieval correctly remembered old pictures elicited a significantly larger positive voltage change over the centro-parietal cortex than new pictures. Propranolol significantly reduced this old/new difference of the mean ERP amplitudes (500-800 ms) for unpleasant but not for neutral and pleasant memories. This effect correlated with salivary alpha-amylase activity, a surrogate for central adrenergic stimulation. In conclusion, propranolol selectively blocked the neural signature of unpleasant memories by mechanisms in which the parietal cortex seems to be specifically involved.", 
    "49": "Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and transcutaneous oximetry (TcPO(2)) are non-invasive techniques, widely used in the clinical setting, for assessing microvascular blood flow and tissue oxygen tension, e.g. recording vascular changes after radiotherapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. With standardized procedures and improved reproducibility, these methods might also be applicable in longitudinal studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of facial skin and gingival LDF and facial skin TcPO(2). The subjects comprised ten healthy volunteers, 5 men, aged 31-68 years. Gingival perfusion was recorded with the LDF probe fixed to a custom made, tooth-supported acrylic splint. Skin perfusion was recorded on the cheek. TcPO(2) was recorded on the forehead and cheek and in the second intercostal space. The reproducibility of LDF measurements taken after vasodilation by heat provocation was greater than for basal flow in both facial skin and mandibular gingiva. Pronounced intraday variations were observed. Interweek reproducibility assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.74 to 0.96 for LDF and from 0.44 to 0.75 for TcPO(2). The results confirm acceptable reproducibility of LDF and TcPO(2) in longitudinal studies in a vascular laboratory where subjects serve as their own controls. The use of thermoprobes is recommended. Repeat measurements should be taken at the same time of day.",

However, whether persistence or development of increased QRS over time is associated with an increased incidence of heart failure in hypertensive patients, independent of blood pressure lowering and regression of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has not been examined.", 
    "51": "The relation of QRS over time to incident heart failure was examined in 8945 hypertensive patients without history of heart failure who were randomly assigned to losartan-based or atenolol-based treatment. During 4.7 +/- 1.1 years follow-up, heart failure hospitalization occurred in 282 patients (3.2%): in 157 with in-treatment QRS less than 110 ms (4.6 per 1000 patient-years) and in 125 with persistence or development of QRS 110 ms or more (13.4 per 1000 patient-years). In univariate Cox analyses in which QRS during the study was entered as a time-varying covariate, in-treatment persistence or development of a QRS 110 ms or more was associated with a 153% increased risk of developing heart failure [hazard ratio 2.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.00-3.20]. After adjusting for treatment, baseline risk factors for heart failure, incident myocardial infarction and for baseline and in-treatment electrocardiographic LVH and blood pressure, persistence or development of a QRS 110 ms or more remained associated with a 102% increased risk of new-onset heart failure (hazard ratio 2.02, 95% CI 1.49-2.74).",

    "53": "Pharmacological modulation of beta-adrenoceptor function is one of the critical issues in the treatment of patients with concurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF). A volume of published evidence sustains the role of long-acting beta(2)-agonists in the treatment of stable COPD, but beta-agonists seem to be detrimental when used for long term in CHF. beta(2)-agonists may exacerbate heart failure and, in any case, they induce adverse cardiac effects in COPD patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. The adverse effects of beta(2)-agonists are likely to be exacerbated in COPD patients with coexistent CHF. beta-Blockers are the standard treatment in CHF, but they can worsen FEV(1) and airway hyperresponsiveness and reluctance exists to prescribe these agents to COPD patients, despite the anticipated beneficial cardiovascular effects. Although the literature is reassuring, there are currently no prospective long-term studies on the safety of beta-blockers in COPD. Therefore, although beta-blockers can be introduced in any medical setting for treating patients with concurrent COPD and CHF, it still seems appropriate to only use those beta-blockers that are more selective for the beta(1)-AR but without ISA at the lowest dose and to titrate them slowly with attention to lung function and symptoms, adding an inhaled antimuscarinic agent when bronchodilation is needed.", 
    "54": "Columns containing immobilized lipoproteins were prepared for the analysis of drug interactions with these particles by high-performance affinity chromatography (HPAC). This approach was evaluated by using it to examine the binding of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to the drugs propranolol and verapamil. HDL was immobilized by the Schiff base method onto silica and gave HPAC columns with reproducible binding to propranolol over 4-5days of continuous operation at pH 7.4. Frontal analysis experiments indicated that two types of interaction were occurring between R- or S-propranolol and HDL at 37 degrees C: saturable binding with an association equilibrium constant (K(a)) of 1.1-1.9x10(5)M(-1) and nonsaturable binding with an overall affinity constant (n K(a)) of 3.7-4.1x10(4)M(-1). Similar results were found at 4 and 27 degrees C. Verapamil also gave similar behavior, with a K(a) of 6.0x10(4) M(-1) at 37 degrees C for the saturable sites and an n K(a) for the nonsaturable sites of 2.5x10(4)M(-1). These measured affinities gave good agreement with solution phase values. The results indicated that HPAC can be used to study drug interactions with HDL, providing information that should be valuable in obtaining a better description of how drugs are transported within the body.", 
    "55": "Partial peptide sequence of a 36 kDa protein from common bean embryo axes showed 100% identity with a reported beta-subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein from soybean. Analysis of the full sequence showed 96.6% identity with the reported soybean G(beta)-subunit, 86% with RACK1B and C from Arabidopsis and 66% with human and mouse RACK1, at the amino acid level. In addition, it showed 85.5, 85 and 83% identities with arcA from Solanum lycopersicum, Arabidopsis (RACK1A) and Nicotiana tabacum, respectively. The amino acid sequence displayed seven WD40 domains and two sites for activated protein kinase C binding. The protein showed a constant expression level but the mRNA had a maximum at 32 h post-imbibition. Western immunoblotting showed the protein in vegetative plant tissues, and in both microsomal and soluble fractions from embryo axes. Synthetic auxin treatment during germination delayed the peak of RACK1 mRNA expression to 48 h but did not affect the protein expression level while the polar auxin transport inhibitor, naphtylphtalamic acid had no effect on either mRNA or protein expression levels. Southern blot and genomic DNA amplification revealed a small gene family with at least one member without introns in the genome. Thus, the RACK1/arcA homolog from common bean has the following features: (1) it is highly conserved; (2) it is both soluble and insoluble within the embryo axis; (3) it is encoded by a small gene family; (4) its mRNA has a peak of expression at the time point of germination stop and (5) its expression is only slightly affected by auxin but unaffected by an auxin transport blocker.",

The bidirectional permeability of the eight sesquiterpenes was studied from the apical (AP) side to the basolateral (BL) side or from the BL side to the AP side. The eight compounds were assayed by HPLC. Transport parameters and apparent permeability coefficients ( P(app)) were then calculated. The bidirectional P(app) values of the eight compounds were compared with those of propranolol, a marker of high permeability and transcellular transport. The transport of the eight sesquiterpenes was concentration-dependent in the range of 10-200 microM. Lower recoveries of ICL, BSE and DML than other sesquiterpenes were found during transport. The results indicated that all the sesquiterpenes are well absorbed mainly by the passive diffusion via the transcellular pathway and metabolism may be involved during the absorption of ICL, BSE and DML.", 
    "57": "Systolic dysfunction and heart failure are major public health problems associated with a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. During the past 2 decades, considerable progress has been made in defining the underlying pathophysiology and the appropriate therapies in heart failure. In patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), sustained sympathetic overactivation leads to down-regulation of beta receptors and uncoupling of the receptors from adenylate cyclase. The clear understanding of the pivotal role of sympathetic overactivation in CHF has led to the evaluation of beta- blocker therapy in CHF. A number of large randomized clinical trials have been conducted with a variety of beta-blockers, and although most of them have shown benefit, there have been differing findings with different molecules. beta-blockers are now considered part of the standard therapy for all patients with symptomatic CHF. Despite the strong evidence supporting their use, beta-blockers continue to be underutilized in CHF.",

Nadolol is useful in the treatment of severe and refractory arrhythmias, particularly in some genetically determined ion-channel diseases, such as long-QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.Quinidine is still used in refractory atrial fibrillation recurrences. Recent studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of quinidine in the treatment of rare genetically determined ion-channel diseases at high risk of sudden death, such as Brugada syndrome and short-QT syndrome.We hope that scientific societies can influence healthcare and pharmaceutical institutions, in order to restore the availability of two cardiovascular drugs that are extremely important in the care of arrhythmic patients.",

Overall mortality in cecal ligation and puncture was similar between metoprolol (40%; n = 10) and saline (50%; n = 10) pretreatment (p = .56), but the median time to death was increased by 33 hrs in metoprolol-treated rats (p = .03). Metoprolol pretreatment reduced hepatic expression of proinflammatory cytokines and lowered plasma interleukin-6 (both p < .05). Myocardial protein expression of interleukin-18 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, key mediators of cardiac dysfunction in sepsis, were also reduced (p < .05). Peripheral beta1-adrenoceptor blockade commenced 6 hrs after lethal endotoxemia or fecal peritonitis did not improve survival.

Our results showed that PAF-16 at micromolar concentrations rapidly (<or=1 min) induces stable but wash-sensitive echinocytosis and hemolysis, but no substantial phosphatidylserine exposure. In conclusion, our study characterizes PAF-16 as a highly membrane partitioning non-permeable molecule accumulating in the outer membrane leaflet.

    "74": "Oxysterols, such as 7beta-hydroxy-cholesterol (7beta-OH) and cholesterol-5beta,6beta-epoxide (beta-epoxide), may have a central role in promoting atherogenesis. This is thought to be predominantly due to their ability to induce apoptosis in cells of the vascular wall and in monocytes/macrophages. Although there has been extensive research regarding the mechanisms through which oxysterols induce apoptosis, much remains to be clarified. Given that experimental evidence has long associated alterations of calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis to apoptotic cell death, the aim of the present study was to determine the influence of intracellular Ca(2+) changes on apoptosis induced by 7beta-OH and beta-epoxide. Ca(2+) responses in differentiated U937 cells were assessed by epifluorescence video microscopy, using the ratiometric dye fura-2. Over 15-min exposure of differentiated U937 cells to 30 muM of 7beta-OH induced a slow but significant rise in fura-2 ratio. The Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine and the chelating agent EGTA blocked the increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+). Moreover, dihydropyridine (DHP) binding sites identified with BODIPY-FLX-DHP were blocked following pretreatment with nifedipine, indicating that the influx of Ca(2+) occurred through L-type channels. However, following long-term incubation with 7beta-OH, elevated levels of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) were not maintained and nifedipine did not provide protection against apoptotic cell death. Our results indicate that the increase in Ca(2+) may be an initial trigger of 7beta-OH-induced apoptosis, but following chronic exposure to the oxysterol, the influence of Ca(2+) on apoptotic cell death appears to be less significant. In contrast, Ca(2+) did not appear to be involved in beta-epoxide-induced apoptosis.", 
    "75": "Burn patients have the highest metabolic rate among critically ill or injured patients. Because propranolol decreases energy expenditure and muscle protein catabolism, in this study, we hypothesized that propranolol would improve healing process and decrease wound-healing time. This study was a double-blind randomized clinical trial; a total of 79 burn patients who referred to this center from January 2006 to January 2007 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Thirty-seven patients were randomly placed in propranolol group and 42 in control group. The propranolol group received propranolol orally with the dose of 1 mg/kg/d and maximum dose of 1.98 mg/kg/d given in six divided doses. This dose was adjusted to decrease the resting heart rate by 20% from each patient's baseline value. The control group received placebo. The most common cause of burn in both groups was flame followed by flash. Patients with superficial burns in the propranolol group needed less time to heal for acceptable wound healing in superficial burns (16.13+/-7.40 days vs 21.52+/-7.94 days; P=.004). We also found that patients with deep burn injury needed less time to be ready for skin graft (28.23+/-8.43 days vs 33.46+/-9.17 days; P=.007) when compared to that of the control group. The use of propranolol decreased the size of the burn wound that finally needed skin graft. Patients in the propranolol group with an average burn size of 31.42% TBSA finally needed 13.75% of TBSA skin graft compared with that of control patients with an average burn size of 33.61% TBSA who needed 18.72% of TBSA skin graft, and patients in the control group with an average burn size of 33.61% TBSA finally needed 18.72% of TBSA skin graft (P=.006). Patients in the propranolol group had a shorter hospital stay period than the control group (30.95+/-8.44 days vs 24.41+/-8.11 days; P=.05).

    "99": "Remodeling myocytes show a typical switch between the embryonic and classical features of apoptosis and/or hypertrophy representing a signal of death (ie, apoptosis) and a signal of life (ie, hypertrophy). The adult myocyte, however, is a terminal cell; usually it is unable to reproduce and death is not genetically programmed (apoptosis), but occurs by necrosis. The reinstatement of apoptosis and development of hypertrophy during remodeling could be part of the switch forward to the embryonic phenotype with reinstatement of the early embryonic genetic program. Hypertrophy and apoptosis are \"sons\" of the same \"mother\": the local, tissue neuroendocrine-neurohumoral response to a mechanical stretch of the myocytes consequent to the geometric changes imposed on the viable myocytes by the necrotic ones. As expected, the life and death cycle is very closely regulated by several autocrine systems, one of which is linked to the interleukin-6 family via a regulatory protein named GP-130. Activation of the GP-130 slows down the death signals, thus favoring hypertrophy and reducing fibrosis.", 
    "100": "Guanidine is an active ingredient extracted from Galega officinalis. It is considered as ligand for imidazoline receptor due to the similarity of chemical structure. Previous studies showed that an activation of imidazoline I2 receptor (I2R) in adrenal gland lowered plasma glucose through releasing beta-endorphin to stimulate the opioid-mu receptor in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ rats). However, the effect of guanidine on I2R remains unclear. In the present study, we observed that guanidine decreased plasma glucose in STZ rats, which was blocked by I2R antagonist (BU224) but not by opioid receptor antagonist (naloxone) or opioid-mu receptor antagonist (naloxonazine). The stimulatory effect of guanidine on glucose uptake in skeletal muscle from Wistar rats was observed and this effect was also abolished by BU224. Then, we used amiloride, an established blocker of I(2A), to differentiate the subtype of I2R for this action of guanidine. Results show that guanidine-induced glucose uptake into skeletal muscle was not blocked by amiloride except at concentrations higher than 2microM showing the mediation of I(2B)R. Taken together, the decrease of plasma glucose by guanidine seems not related to release of endogenous opioid to activate opioid-mu receptor but through direct activation of imidazoline I2R while the I(2B) subtype is responsible for increase of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. Thus, guanidine can be applied as the ligand or agonist of imidazoline I(2B) receptor.", 
    "101": "In this report, we describe the clinical results of ivabradine use in a patient with a serious form of unstable angina. For this patient, it was proposed that no other therapeutic, pharmacologic or surgical, option was available. The patient is a 75-year-old woman who presented with repeated episodes of retrosternal chest pain. She notably had a history of type II diabetes mellitus treated by insulin for several years and complicated by diabetic macro-angiopathy. ECG tracings recorded during these episodes showed abnormalities of the lateral repolarization phase of ischaemic nature. There was no measured increase in cardiac enzymes. She was transferred to our CCU with a diagnosis of unstable angina. In our CCU, the patient was treated with nitrates, metoprolol, aspirin, clopidogrel and atorvastatin at maximal sustainable doses. Following persistent clinical-instrumental instability, she was subjected to coronary angiography. This study revealed severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease not amenable to surgery or angioplasty revascularization. In addition to the therapy already provided, a beta-blocker (metoprolol 50 mgx2/die) and diltiazem (30 mgx2/die) were added despite their potentially dangerous and adverse chronotropic effects. Despite this treatment, the patients heart rate remained high (between 80 and 100 beats/min). This heart rate appeared to be the main driving cause of her anginal symptoms. At this point, the use of ivabradine seemed the only option, even though use would be off-label compared to current indications for the drugs use. We started with a low dose of 2.5 mg/b.i.d. and titrated up to 5 mg b.i.d. As we titrated, we witnessed a gradual reduction in heart rate. A consequent stabilization of her clinical pattern progressed into an almost unexpected asymptomatic state. After about a week of clinical observation, the patient recovered. After three months, she remains asymptomatic.",

    "116": "We reported previously that chromogranin A (Chga) knockout (KO) mice are hypertensive and hyperadrenergic. Here we sought to determine the basis of such alterations by probing physiological, biochemical, and pharmacological responses to perturbations of the autonomic nervous system. In the conscious state, KO mice had substantially elevated basal high blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR); immobilization stress caused increments in systolic BP and HR in both wild-type (WT) and KO mice, with higher maxima but blunted increments in the KO state. Catestatin (CST; CHGA(352-372)) selectively diminished stress-induced increments in BP and HR in KO mice, implicating CST as an antihypertensive peptide, even in stressful conditions. Heightened plasma catecholamines in KO mice returned to WT level after CST. Stress caused further increments in catecholamines in WT mice but no change in KO mice. KO mice displayed diminished baroreflex sensitivity in response to either phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside, accounting for exaggerated pressor and depressor responses to these compounds; baroreceptor function was normalized by CST. To probe the relative roles of endogenous/basal sympathetic vs. parasympathetic tone in control of BP and HR, we used the muscarinic-cholinergic antagonist atropine or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol; HR and BP responses to each antagonist were exaggerated in KO animals. We conclude that ablation of Chga expression results in global disturbances in autonomic function, both sympathetic and parasympathetic, that can be abrogated (or rescued), at least in part, by replacement of CST. The results point to mechanisms whereby CHGA and its CST fragment act to control cardiovascular homeostasis.",

    "122": "The presence of many human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment is now a worldwide concern, yet little is known of the chronic effects that these bioactive substances may be having on aquatic organisms. Propranolol, a non-specific beta adrenoreceptor blocker (beta-blocker), is used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease in humans. Propranolol has been found in surface waters worldwide at concentrations ranging from 12 to 590ng/L. To test the potential for ecologically relevant effects in fish in receiving waters, short-term (21 days) adult reproduction studies were conducted, in which fathead minnows were exposed to nominal concentrations of propranolol hydrochloride [CAS number 318-98-9] ranging from 0.001 to 10mg/L (measured concentrations typically from 78 to 130%). Exposure of fish to 3.4mg/L (measured) over 3 days caused 100% mortality or severe toxicity requiring euthanasia. The most sensitive endpoints from the studies were a decrease in hatchability (with regard to the number of days to hatch) and a concentration-related increase in female gonadal somatic index (GSI), giving LOEC(hatchability) and LOEC(female GSI) values of 0.1mg/L. Concentration-related decreases in weights of male fish were also observed, with LOEC(male wet weight value) of 1.0mg/L, and the LOEC(reproduction) value was 1.0mg/L. Collectively, these data do not suggest that propranolol was acting as a reproductive toxin. Plasma concentrations of propranolol in male fish exposed to nominal concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0mg/L were 0.34 and 15.00mg/L, respectively, which constitutes 436 and 1546% of measured water concentrations. These compare with predicted concentrations of 0.07 and 0.84mg/L, and thus to a degree support the use of partition coefficient models for predicting concentrations in plasma in fish. In addition, propranolol plasma concentrations in fish exposed to water concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0mg/L were greater than the human therapeutic plasma concentration and hence these data very strongly support the fish plasma model proposed by Huggett et al. [Huggett, D.B., Cook, J.C., Ericson, J.F., Williams, R.T., 2003a.

    "123": "The present study was aimed at determining which rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms are involved in the hydroxylation of tyramine to dopamine and at determining whether the reaction can take place in the brain. Moreover, we examined the relative distribution of the CYP2D subfamily's activity in the rat brain, focusing our attention on dopaminergic structures. The study was conducted with cDNA-expressed CYP isoforms (rat CYP1A1, 2A2, 2B1, 2C6/11/13, 2D1/2/4/18, 2E1, 3A2 and human CYP2D6) and with rat brain microsomes. Of the rat CYP isoforms tested, only CYP2D2, 2D4 and 2D18 (but not CYP2D1) were capable of forming dopamine from tyramine. The rat CYP2D isoforms were less efficient than the human CYP2D6 and the efficiency of both human and rat enzymes was higher for m-tyramine (K(m)=256, 143 and 87 microM; V(max)=0.47, 0.23 and 9.55 pmol/pmolCYP/min for CYP2D4, 2D18 and 2D6, respectively) than for p-tyramine (K(m)=433 and 688 microM, V(max)=0.12 and 0.19 pmol/pmolCYP/min for CYP2D4 and 2D18, respectively). Brain microsomes were able to metabolize tyramine to dopamine. The reaction was inhibited by the CYP2D inhibitor quinine and by anti-CYP2D4 antibodies, which suggests that CYP2D4 is the isoform governing tyramine hydroxylation to dopamine in the rat brain. A relatively high level of CYP2D activity (bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation) was found in the substantia nigra, the cerebellum, the nucleus accumbens and the truncus cerebri. The results are discussed in the context of the likelihood of CYP2D-mediated dopamine synthesis in vivo, the implications for Parkinson's disease and the addiction process.",

The inhibition by WIN 55,212-2 (10 microM) was reversible and prevented by nifedipine (3 microM), suggesting a selective action on L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs). WIN 55,212-2 action exhibited all the features of voltage-independent Ca2+ channel modulation: (1) no changes of the activation kinetics, (2) equal depressive action at all potentials and (3) no facilitation following strong prepulses. At variance with WIN 55,212-2, the CB1R inverse agonist AM-251 (10 microM) caused 20% increase of Ca2+ currents. The inhibition of LTCCs by WIN 55,212-2 was prevented by overnight PTX-incubation and by intracellular perfusion with GDP-beta-S. The latter caused also a 20% Ca2+ current up-regulation. WIN 55,212-2 action was also prevented by application of the PKA-blocker H89 or by loading the neurons with 8-CPT-cAMP. Our results suggest that LTCCs in GT1-7 neurons are partially inhibited at rest due to a constitutive CB1R activity removed by AM-251 and GDP-beta-S. Activation of CB1R via PTX-sensitive G proteins and cAMP/PKA pathway selectively depresses LTCCs that critically control the synchronized spontaneous firing and pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in GT1-7 neurons.", 
    "132": "Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 is one of the most investigated CYPs in relation to genetic polymorphism, but accounts for only a small percentage of all hepatic CYPs (approximately 2-4%). There is a large interindividual variation in the enzyme activity of CYP2D6. The enzyme is largely non-inducible and metabolizes approximately 25% of current drugs. Typical substrates for CYP2D6 are largely lipophilic bases and include some antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiarrhythmics, antiemetics, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and opioids. The CYP2D6 activity ranges considerably within a population and includes ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs), extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs). There is a considerable variability in the CYP2D6 allele distribution among different ethnic groups, resulting in variable percentages of PMs, IMs, EMs and UMs in a given population. To date, 74 allelic variants and a series of subvariants of the CYP2D6 gene have been reported and the number of alleles is still growing. Among these are fully functional alleles, alleles with reduced function and null (non-functional) alleles, which convey a wide range of enzyme activity, from no activity to ultrarapid metabolism of substrates. As a consequence, drug adverse effects or lack of drug effect may occur if standard doses are applied. The alleles *10, *17, *36 and *41 give rise to substrate-dependent decreased activity. Null alleles of CYP2D6 do not encode a functional protein and there is no detectable residual enzymatic activity. It is clear that alleles *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *11, *12, *13, *14, *15, *16, *18, *19, *20, *21, *38, *40, *42, *44, *56 and *62 have no enzyme activity. They are responsible for the PM phenotype when present in homozygous or compound heterozygous constellations. These alleles are of clinical significance as they often cause altered drug clearance and drug response. Among the most important variants are CYP2D6*2, *3, *4, *5, *10, *17 and *41. On the other hand, the CYP2D6 gene is subject to copy number variations that are often associated with the UM phenotype. Marked decreases in drug concentrations have been observed in UMs with tramadol, venlafaxine, morphine, mirtazapine and metoprolol. The functional impact of CYP2D6 alleles may be substrate-dependent. For example, CYP2D6*17 is generally considered as an allele with reduced function, but it displays remarkable variability in its activity towards substrates such as dextromethorphan, risperidone, codeine and haloperidol. The clinical consequence of the CYP2D6 polymorphism can be either occurrence of adverse drug reactions or altered drug response. Drugs that are most affected by CYP2D6 polymorphisms are commonly those in which CYP2D6 represents a substantial metabolic pathway either in the activation to form active metabolites or clearance of the agent. For example, encainide metabolites are more potent than the parent drug and thus QRS prolongation is more apparent in EMs than in PMs. In contrast, propafenone is a more potent beta-blocker than its metabolites and the beta-blocking activity during propafenone therapy is more prominent in PMs than EMs, as the parent drug accumulates in PMs. Since flecainide is mainly eliminated through renal excretion, and both R- and S-flecainide possess equivalent potency for sodium channel inhibition, the CYP2D6 phenotype has a minor impact on the response to flecainide. Since the contribution of CYP2D6 is greater for metoprolol than for carvedilol, propranolol and timolol, a stronger gene-dose effect is seen with this beta-blocker, while such an effect is lesser or marginal in other beta-blockers. Concordant genotype-phenotype correlation provides a basis for predicting the phenotype based on genetic testing, which has the potential to achieve optimal pharmacotherapy. However, genotype testing for CYP2D6 is not routinely performed in clinical practice and there is uncertainty regarding genotype-phenotype, gene-concentration and gene-dose relationships. Further prospective studies on the clinical impact of CYP2D6-dependent metabolism of drugs are warranted in large cohorts of subjects.", 
    "133": "The utility of a liquid extraction based sealing surface sampling probe (SSSP) for the direct mass spectrometric analysis of targeted drugs and metabolites in dried blood spots (DBSs) and whole mouse thin tissue sections was demonstrated. The accuracy and precision for the quantitative analysis of a minimum of 50 ng/mL sitamaquine or acetaminophen in DBSs on paper were well within the required 15% dictated by internationally recognized acceptance criteria for assay validations. Analysis of whole-body mouse thin tissue sections from animals dosed with propranolol, adhered to an adhesive tape substrate, provided semiquantitative information for propranolol and its hydroxyproranolol glucuronide metabolite within specific organs of the tissue. The relative abundances recorded for the two compounds in the brain, lung, kidney, and liver were in nominal agreement with previously reported amounts based on analysis using a liquid microjunction surface sampling probe (LMJ-SSP), whole-body autoradiography (WBA), and high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The ability to sample and analyze from tape-adhered tissue samples, which are generally employed in WBA analysis, presents the possibility of consecutive WBA and SSSP-MS analysis of the same tissue section. This would facilitate assignment, and possibly quantitation, of the different molecular forms of total drug related material detected in the WBA analysis. The flexibility to sample larger or smaller spot sizes, alternative probe sealing mechanisms, and a reduction in internal volumes and associated sample carryover issues will be among the first simple improvements necessary to make the SSSP-MS method a practical DBS and/or thin tissue section analysis tool or to expand its use to other surface sampling applications.",

Because impaired endothelial activity is attributed a major causal role in the pathophysiology of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure, the endothelium-agonistic properties of nebivolol suggest that this drug might provide additional benefit beyond beta-receptor blockade. Although lesser beta-blocker-related side effects have been reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or impotence taking nebivolol, side effects and contraindications overlap those of other beta-blockers. Clinically, this compound has been proven to have antihypertensive and anti-ischemic effects as well as beneficial effects on hemodynamics and prognosis in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Further studies are now necessary to compare the benefit of nebivolol with that of other drugs in the same class and, most importantly, its prognostic impact in patients with hypertension.", 
    "139": "A 61-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes was referred for the evaluation of multiple bilateral adrenal tumors. While Cushingoid features were not apparent, an elevated cortisol level in response to a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (187.7\u00a0nmol/l), an elevated urinary cortisol level (170.9\u00a0nmol/day), and a weak response to a cosyntropin-releasing hormone (CRH) provocation test were observed. Furthermore, the serum cortisol level increased in response to a posture test or isoproterenol infusion. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed as having ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH) with subclinical Cushing's syndrome associated with the aberrant expression of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. After 2\u00a0months of propranolol therapy, the serum cortisol responses to a posture test and isoproterenol infusion, the cortisol level in response to a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (102.1\u00a0nmol/l), and the urinary cortisol level (165.9\u00a0nmol/day) all normalized. While the suppression of cortisol secretion was sustained for 24\u00a0months, glucose metabolism and adrenal size were unaffected. To our knowledge, this is the first report of AIMAH accompanied by subclinical Cushing's syndrome associated with the aberrant expression of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, propranolol inhibited cortisol hypersecretion in the present case. Additional cases or controlled studies are needed to determine the potential effect of propranolol on metabolic disorders and adrenal size in patients with AIMAH.",

The sample was pretreated with a simple procedure of protein precipitation and an isotope-labeled d5-bisoprolol was used as internal standard. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Capcell Pak C(18) MG III column (100 mm x 2.0 mm, 5 microm). The protonated ion of the analyte was detected in positive ionization by multiple reaction monitoring mode. The mass transition pairs of m/z 326.3 --> 116.3 and m/z 331.3 --> 121.3 were used to detect bisoprolol and the internal standard, respectively. Linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect, dilution test and stability were evaluated during method validation over the range of 0.5-100 ng/mL. The validated method was successfully applied to analyze human plasma samples in a bisoprolol bioavailability study.",

By contrast, PKO2 decreased (50%) under the same conditions (P < 0.05). Beta-blockade reduced baseline heart rate (20%) and abolished the compensatory increase in cardiac output after hemodilution (P < 0.05). This attenuated the cerebral blood flow response and reduced PBrO2 (50%), without further decreasing PKO2. Cerebral HIF-1alpha protein levels were increased in beta-blocked hemodiluted rats relative to hemodiluted controls (P < 0.05). Systemic catecholamine and erythropoietin levels increased comparably after hemodilution in both groups, whereas angiotensin II levels increased only after beta-blockade and hemodilution.",

    "145": "Slow coronary flow (SCF) is the phenomenon of slow progression of angiographic contrast in the coronary arteries in the absence of stenosis in the epicardial vessels in some patients presenting with chest pain. There are no definite treatment modalities for patients with SCF. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of nebivolol in patients with slow coronary flow by monitoring its effects on endothelial function and different markers of inflammation. Forty-two patients (16 females, 26 males; mean age, 55 +/- 10) with slow coronary flow (SCF) were included in the study. After baseline assessment, the patients were administered nebivolol 5 mg once daily. After 12 weeks of nebivolol therapy, the biochemical and ultrasonographic examinations were repeated. Chest pain relief was detected in 38 patients after treatment (90%). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and high sensitive CRP were significantly decreased after nebivolol therapy. Among brachial artery dilation variables that reflect endothelial function, basal resistive index (RI), post-flow mediated dilation RI, and post-nitrate mediated dilation RI were significantly decreased after therapy. Nebivolol is effective at improving endothelial function in patients with SCF. It controls chest pain, decreases CRP, and has favorable effects on brachial artery dilation variables in patients with coronary slow flow.",

We measured LV pressure simultaneously with a high-fidelity pressure catheter and calculated LV ejection fraction (EF) with the biplane Simpson method and 2D echocardiography. Maximal positive dP/dt (dP/dt(max)) was used as the gold standard measurement of LV contractility. We compared LV twist and apical rotation and EF against dP/dt(max) by linear mixed model. LV apical rotation and twist showed dose-dependent increases and decreases after dobutamine and esmolol infusion, respectively. However, basal rotation did not change significantly during different inotropic conditions. There was a stronger association between dP/dt(max) and LV twist (R(2)=0.747, P<0.001) and apical rotation (R(2)=0.726, P<0.001) than between dP/dt(max) and EF (R(2)=0.408, P<0.001), and this trend was more apparent with coronary ligation irrespective of the ligation site. There was also a high association between dP/dt(max) and apical rotation alone, both with (R(2)=0.805, P<0.001) and without (R(2)=0.748, P<0.001) coronary ligation. Apical rotation alone showed comparable accuracy to LV twist. Apical rotational velocity also showed a high association with dP/dt(max) (R(2)=0.669, P<0.001) and LV twist (R(2)=0.892, P<0.001).",

In vitro electrophysiological studies revealed a profound defect in sodium channel function characterized by approximately 10-fold slowing of inactivation, increased persistent current, slowing of recovery from inactivation, and depolarized voltage dependence of activation and inactivation. Single-channel recordings demonstrated increased frequency of late openings, prolonged mean open time, and increased latency to first opening for the mutant. Subjects carrying this mutation responded clinically to the combination of mexiletine with propranolol and survived. Pharmacologically, the mutant exhibited 2-fold greater tonic and use-dependent mexiletine block than wild-type channels. The mutant also exhibited enhanced tonic (2.4-fold) and use-dependent block ( approximately 5-fold) by propranolol, and we observed additive effects of the 2 drugs on the mutant.",

During mean follow-up of 4.7+/-1.1 years, new-onset AF occurred in 701 patients (7.9%). Patients with new AF had smaller decreases in HR to last in-treatment ECG or last ECG before AF (-2.7+/-13.5 versus -5.2+/-12.5 bpm), whether on losartan- (-0.4+/-13.5 versus -2.2+/-11.7 bpm) or atenolol-based treatment (-5.3+/-12.8 versus -8.3+/-12.6 bpm, all P<0.001). In univariate Cox analyses, higher HR on in-treatment ECGs was associated with an increased risk of new-onset AF, with a 15% greater risk of AF for every 10 bpm higher HR (95% CI 8% to 22%). In alternative analyses, persistence or development of a HR> or =84 (upper quintile of baseline HR) was associated with a 46% greater risk of developing AF (95% CI 19% to 80%). After adjusting for treatment with losartan versus atenolol, baseline risk factors for AF, baseline and in-treatment systolic and diastolic pressure and the known predictive value of baseline and in-treatment ECG left ventricular hypertrophy for new AF, higher in-treatment HR remained strongly associated with new AF with a 19% higher risk for every 10 bpm higher HR (95% CI 10% to 28%) or a 61% increased rate of AF in patients with persistence or development of a HR> or =84 (95% CI 27% to 104%, all P<0.001).",

Maximal force (F(max)) was lower, whereas Ca(2+) sensitivity was higher in untreated MI compared with sham (both P<0.05). The difference in Ca(2+) sensitivity was abolished by treatment of cells with the beta-adrenergic kinase, protein kinase A. beta-blocker therapy partially reversed F(max) and Ca(2+) sensitivity to sham values and significantly reduced passive force. Despite the lower myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity in MI+beta compared with untreated myocardium, the protein kinase A induced reduction in Ca(2+) sensitivity was largest in cardiomyocytes from myocardium treated with beta-blockers. Phosphorylation of beta-adrenergic target proteins (myosin binding protein C and troponin I) did not differ among groups, whereas myosin light chain 2 phosphorylation was reduced in MI, which coincided with increased expression of protein phosphatase 1. beta-blockade fully restored the latter alterations and significantly reduced expression of protein phosphatase 2a.",

From these parameters, left ventricular contractility (indexed by the end-systolic pressure-volume ratio), total peripheral resistance, and effective arterial elastance (E(a)) were derived. Overall, EF increased by 7-percentage points after 6 months of therapy (from 25+/-9 to 32+/-9, P<0.0001). This change was due to an increase in stroke volume (P<0.001) with no significant change in end-diastolic volume (P=0.15). The EF change correlated with increased contractility, decreased HR and decreased total peripheral resistance (P<0.003 in each case). In those patients whose EF increased at least 5 points, approximately 60% of the increase was due to HR reduction, approximately 30% was due to increased contractility, and <20% was due to the decrease in total peripheral resistance.",

Hence beta-blocking drugs (such as beta2ADR antagonists and inverse agonists) may cause acute bronchoconstriction which, in turn, may be attenuated by anti-cholinergic agents. Although beta2-agonists are highly effective for the acute relief of bronchoconstriction, their chronic use is accompanied by an adaptive reduction in beta2ADR numbers and associated desensitization of response, resulting in increased exacerbations and rare cases of death.

Furthermore, the use of antihypertensive drugs has been suggested to reduce the incidence of dementia, including Alzheimer disease. In this study, we examined the effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker, olmesartan, on beta-amyloid-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Oral administration of a low dose of olmesartan attenuated cerebrovascular dysfunction in young Alzheimer disease-model transgenic mice (APP23 mouse), without a reduction in the brain beta-amyloid level. Moreover, treatment of APP23 mice with olmesartan decreased oxidative stress in brain microvessels. Using an acute mouse model induced by ICV administration of beta-amyloid 1-40, we assessed the effect of oral administration of olmesartan on spatial learning evaluated with the Morris water maze. Olmesartan significantly improved cognitive function independent of its blood pressure-lowering effect, whereas there was no improvement by other types of antihypertensive drugs (hydralazine and nifedipine). We found that pretreatment with a low dose of olmesartan completely prevented beta-amyloid-induced vascular dysregulation and partially attenuated the impairment of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

A multicompartment model accurately described the absorption and distribution of atenolol and verapamil as well as the metabolism of verapamil and distribution of the metabolite, norverapamil. The accurate description of atenolol data required inclusion of an intermediate compartment in addition to paracellular clearance, whereas verapamil and norverapamil were modeled in the absence of paracellular clearance. The absorption of verapamil was well characterized by linear kinetics, whereas the formation and distribution of norverapamil were well characterized by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The model identified EDTA as a modulator of physical barriers, ketoconazole as an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and PSC-833 and GF-120918 as specific P-gp inhibitors. These results demonstrate the utility of a physiologically based model to characterize (i) the drug distribution across the in situ perfused rat intestine and (ii) the effect of chemical modulators in this biological system.", 
    "193": "Inconsistent results were reported for the solid-state nature of the racemic species of the pharmaceutical relevant compound propranolol hydrochloride. In this work the binary phase diagram of the propranolol hydrochloride enantiomers is studied. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used as analytical methods. The type of the racemic species, the presence and extent of partial solid solutions and the stability regions of polymorphic forms in the system were investigated. The identified binary phase diagram is sketched. Finally, the feasibility of crystallization-based resolution is discussed."
