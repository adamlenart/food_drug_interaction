    "0": "Diuretic monotherapy has been recommended by the fifth report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-V) as a preferred initial treatment for hypertension. Thiazide diuretics are commonly used to treat hypertension because of their demonstrated efficacy, favorable safety profile, low acquisition cost, and their proven ability to reduce blood pressure-related morbidity and mortality. Once-daily low-dose hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg/ day) or chlorthalidone (15 mg/day) effectively reduces blood pressure in patients with stage 1 or stage 2 hypertension in comparison with placebo. Blood pressure reductions with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone are comparable to that achieved with higher doses (25 and 50 mg/day). Additional blood pressure reductions can be attained with concomitant use of once-daily low-dose hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a beta blocker, or a calcium antagonist. Once-daily low-dose hydrochlorothiazide provides clinically meaningful blood pressure lowering while minimizing adverse effects, such as electrolyte disturbances, cholesterol elevations, and increases in serum uric acid levels.", 
    "1": "The aim of this review is to assess the prevalence of complications and responses to various antihypertensive drug therapies in ethnic minority groups in the United States. In some instances, these comments are extended to responses of citizens in their countries of origin. The incidence of hypertension, mortality from hypertensive heart disease, stroke, and hypertensive renal disease are higher in African Americans. Although some Hispanic Americans have a lesser risk for hypertension, they have a greater risk for other risk factors such as diabetes and dyslipidemia. There is a similar association between income and mortality for both African Americans and Hispanic Americans. When compared to European Americans and other ethnic minorities, African Americans respond less favorably to beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Nevertheless, the observed response in African Americans to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers is clinically significant. The available literature indicates that Asian American responses to calcium antagonists seem to be more favorable than responses to ACE inhibitors and equivalent to their responses to diuretic and beta blocker therapy. Although there are few published studies of drug efficacy in Hispanic Americans, there appears to be no hierarchy in response to the various antihypertensive drug classes. Ethnicity is not an accurate criterion for predicting poor response to any class of antihypertensive therapy. Thus, there is little justification to use racial profiling as a criterion for the avoidance of selected drug classes because of presumed lack of efficacy. Observed differences in the incidence of hypertension and its poor outcomes have led some investigators to postulate that the etiology of hypertension in ethnic minority groups is intrinsically different from whites. Awareness of racial differences in hypertension outcomes evolved in the United States within a historical context that does not fully appreciate that race is often a surrogate for many social and economic factors that influence health status and healthcare delivery. Poor outcomes in ethnic minority groups occur in many diseases, not only hypertension. The goal of ethnicity-related research should be to describe the diversity of disease expression in humans and to target at-risk groups for prevention and early intervention. The use of racial descriptors to explain genetic differences in ethnic groups should take a lesser priority.", 
    "2": "The spiropyrrolizidine oximes 236 and 222 and a related spiropyrrolizidine alkaloid, nitropolyzonamine, block nicotinic receptor channels in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and in human medulloblastoma TE671 cells. In PC12 cells with an alpha 3 beta 4(5)-nicotinic receptor, both the spiropyrrolizidine oxime 236 and nitropolyzonamine had IC50 values of about 1.5 microM, while spiropyrrolizidine oxime 222 had an IC50 value of 2.6 microM versus carbamylcholine-elicited sodium-22 influx. In TE671 cells with an alpha 1 beta 1 gamma delta nicotinic receptor, the spiropyrrolizidine oximes 236, 222, and nitropolyzonamine had IC50 values of 9.5, 14, and 67 microM, respectively. The inhibitions by the spiropyrrolizidine oxime 236 and nitropolyzonamine appeared to be noncompetitive in nature in both cell lines. In rat cerebral cortical membranes, binding of [3H]nicotine to alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic receptors was not inhibited significantly by 10 microM concentrations of the spiropyrrolizidine oxime 236, or by nitropolyzonamine, as expected for a noncompetitive blocker. Both compounds at 10 microM had marginal effects on a variety of central receptors, but did inhibit binding of [3H]1,3-di(2-tolyl) guanidine to sigma receptors in mouse brain membranes with IC50 values of about 0.5 microM. The spiropyrrolizidine oxime 236 at 10 microM had no effect on batrachotoxin-elicited sodium influx in guinea pig cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes or on ATP-elicited calcium influx in PC12 cells. Such spiropyrrolizidines represent a new structural class of blockers of nicotinic receptor channels with selectivity for ganglionic-type receptors.", 
    "3": "Capillary electrophoresis offers a new way of characterizing interactions between different bile salts and drugs. The observed interactions were characterized with modified model functions known from affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) an micellar electrokinetic capillary electrophoresis (MECC). The methodical background of both methods is the change of the ionic mobility of the drug caused by partition between phases and aggregation with the bile salt molecules, respectively. This phenomenon is described by two different physicochemical models. A parameter estimation was carried out in order to obtain the partition coefficients KP as well as constants for the aggregate formation KA. Furthermore, an expression about the specific molar volume of the micelles and stoichiometric coefficients can be given.", 
    "4": "In vitro incubation of Listeria monocytogenes immune spleen cells in the presence of the catecholamines epinephrine or norepinephrine inhibited the alpha/beta-interferon (IFN alpha/beta) synthesis induced by the mitogen lipopolysaccharide, in a manner that appeared to be concentration-dependent. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of both catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine on the synthesis of IFN alpha/beta was prevented by incubating immune spleen cells in the presence of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist agent.", 
    "5": "A series of trimetoquinol (1, TMQ) analogs were designed and synthesized based on the lead compound 2, a diiodinated analog of trimetoquinol which exhibits improved selectivity for beta 2-versus beta 1-adrenoceptors (AR). To determine the influence of 1-benzyl substituents of trimetoquinol on beta 2-AR binding affinity and selectivity, we replaced and/or removed the 3'-, 4'-, and 5'-methoxy substituents of trimetoquinol. Replacement of the 4'-methoxy group of 2 with an amino (21c) or acetamido (15) moiety did not significantly alter beta 2-AR and thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TP) receptor affinity. Substitution with a 4'-hydroxy (18) or -iodo (21b) group did not significantly alter beta 2-AR affinity, but greatly reduced TP receptor affinity (380- and 1200-fold, respectively). Further, the beta 2-AR can accommodate larger substituents such as a benzamide at the 4'-position (26b). Other monoiodo derivatives (24, 26a) have similar or slightly lower affinity to both beta 2-AR and TP receptor compared to their diiodo analogs. Interestingly, removal of the 4'-substituent of 3',5'-diiodo analogs increased beta 2-AR affinity with little or no effect on beta 1-AR and TP binding. Thus, analog 21a displayed highly potent (pKi 9.52) and selective (beta 2/beta 1 = 600) binding affinity for beta 2-AR. On the other hand, trifluoromethyl substituents at the 3'- and 5'-positions (27) essentially abolished binding affinity at beta 2-AR and TP receptors. The differential binding effects of the aforementioned trimetoquinol modifications on the receptor systems may reflect differences in the binding pocket that interacts with the benzyl portion of trimetoquinol analogs. Thus, manipulation of the 1-benzyl moiety of trimetoquinol (1) has resulted in analogs that exhibit potent beta 2-AR binding affinity and significantly lower beta 1-AR and TP receptor affinities.", 
    "6": "Essential hyperhidrosis (EH) is caused by an unexplained overactivity of the sympathetic fibers which pass through the upper dorsal sympathetic ganglia D2 and D3. Since the D2 and D3 ganglia are also involved in the sympathetic cardiac innervation, cardiocirculatory autonomic function may also be abnormal in EH. In order to study the function of the sympathetic nervous system in EH, and to assess the effects of thoracoscopic sympathiocolysis, cardiocirculatory autonomic function tests were performed in 13 consecutive patients with EH, before (baseline) and 6 weeks after the thoracoscopic intervention. Baseline data were also compared with data obtained from 13 matched healthy volunteers: EH patients showed an increased heart rate at rest, but only in the standing position (94 +/- 18.5 vs 78 +/- 10.9 bpm, P < 0.01), as well as an increased ratio of low to high frequency power of the heart rate variability in the standing position (5.92 +/- 4.4 vs 2.8 +/- 2.5, P < 0.05). Exercise tests were normal in every EH patient. After sympathiocolysis, heart rate at rest (sitting on the cycloergometer) had decreased (75.4 +/- 13 vs 90.4 +/- 16.5 bpm, P < 0.05), as well as heart rate at maximal exercise (165.2 +/- 14.8 vs 180 +/- 10 bpm, P < 0.05). Exercise capacity and the cardiorespiratory responses to exercise were, however, unchanged after sympathicolysis. Resting heart rate in the lying (66 +/- 10 vs 76 +/- 15 bpm, P < 0.05) and standing positions (82 +/- 13.8 vs 94 +/- 18.5 bpm, P < 0.05), and the diastolic blood pressure reaction to a handgrip test (73.6 +/- 8.6 vs 84.7 +/- 11.6 mmHg, P < 0.05) were also lowered after sympathicolysis. In conclusion, patients with EH show an overfunctioning of the sympathetic system which is characterised by an increased reaction to stress (standing, exercise), whereas resting sympathetic tone is unaffected. Thoracoscopic D2-D3 sympathicolysis corrects this hyperfunction and has a partial beta-blocker-like activity, which results in a decrease in heart rate at rest and during maximal exercise, and in the diastolic blood pressure response to the handgrip test. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term consequences of this procedure.", 
    "7": "The effect of intracerebrovenricularly (i.c.v.) injected choline on blood pressure was investigated in rats made hypotensive by blocking peripheral alpha-adrenoceptors or autonomic ganglionic transmission. Choline (50-150 micrograms; i.c.v.) increased blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner and 150 micrograms of choline restored blood pressure to the resting level. The pressor response to choline was associated with an increase in plasma vasopressin levels. Pretreatment with mecamylamine (50 micrograms; i.c.v.), but not atropine (10 micrograms; i.c.v.), blocked both the pressor and vasopressin responses to i.c.v. choline. The vasopressin receptor antagonist, [beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopenta-methylene-propionyl1,O-Me-T ry2,Arg8] vasopressin (10 micrograms/kg; i.v.), given 5 min after i.c.v. choline (150 micrograms), abolished the pressor effect of choline and blood pressure returned to the pre-choline levels. It is concluded that the precursor of acetylcholine, choline, can increase blood pressure and reverse hypotension in alpha-adrenoceptor or ganglionic transmission blocked rats, by increasing plasma vasopressin.", 
    "8": "Two members of a family with (autosomal dominant) dilated cardiomyopathy and symptomatic short-lasting ventricular tachyarrhythmias were each treated with an ICD in the course of their disease. One patient had an episode of torsades de pointes induced by amiodarone, and the ICD failed to recognize some events. Cardiac arrest recurred in this setting. Treatment with bisoprolol was helpful in maintaining an acceptable functional status and in preventing multiple shocks until transplantation became mandatory. Bisoprolol was not tolerated by the second patient, who had several episodes of syncope because of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. His functional course went downhill fast, and he received a heart transplantation 16 months after implantation of an ICD, which had not delivered any shocks, in spite of one symptomatic short ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "9": "There is now some evidence that major depression is accompanied by biochemical and immune changes pointing to the presence of a chronic inflammatory response. The latter condition is reportedly characterized by changes in iron (Fe) metabolism and the erythron, such as decreased serum Fe and transferrin (Tf) and increased serum ferritin, lower number of red blood cells (RBC), lower hematocrit (Htc) and hemoglobin (Hb). The aim of the present study was to examine Fe metabolism and the erythron in 38 major depressed subjects versus 15 normal volunteers, as well as the effects of antidepressant treatments on these variables. Major depressed subjects had significantly lower serum Fe and Tf, a lower number of RBC, lower Htc and Hb, and a significantly increased number of reticulocytes than normal controls. Serum ferritin was significantly higher in major depressed patients with melancholia than in those with simple major depression and normal controls. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), MC Hb (MCH), MC Hb concentration (MCHC) and RBC distribution width (RDW) were not significantly different between major depressed subjects and normal controls. Treatment with antidepressants during 5 weeks had no significant effect on the alterations in number of RBC and reticulocytes, Htc, Hb, Fe and Tf. There were significant relationships between the above Fe and erythron variables and established immune-inflammatory markers of major depression, e.g., lowered serum albumin and zinc and the increased electrophoretically-separated alpha 1-globulin fraction. The results suggest that the disorders in Fe metabolism and the erythron during major depression may be induced by the immune-inflammatory response in that illness.", 
    "10": "Repeated oral administration of propranolol (PL, 100 mg/kg daily, for 5, 10 and 15 days) to male Wistar rats increased PL N-desisopropylase and decreased PL 4-,5- and 7-hydroxylase activities in liver microsomes. The increase was highest at the 10 day time point whereas the decrease was relatively constant over the 15 day treatment period. There were no significant changes in the total content of cytochromes P450 (P450) or cytochrome b5 or in NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity during the PI, treatment. The enhanced N-desisopropylase activities were markedly inhibited by alpha-naphthoflavone (a P450-1A1/2 inhibitor), and moderately by triacetyloleandomycin (a P450-3A1/2 inhibitor) and diethyldithiocarbamate (a P450-2E1 inhibitor). Phenacetin O-deethylase activity, an index of P450-1A2, was significantly increased on day 5, 10 and 15 of the treatment, whereas p-nitrophenol hydroxylase activity was elevated on day 10 only. The PL N-desisopropylation showed a strong and significant correlation with phenacetin O-deethylation, and a weaker but significant correlation with p-nitrophenol hydroxylation. Immunoblot analysis revealed that a protein band corresponding to P450-1A2 was increased by PL pretreatment, and protein band corresponding to P450-3A tended to be increased slightly, but other protein band corresponding to the subfamily of P450-2B, -2C, or -2E was not changed. Pretreatment of rats with P450 inducers (beta-naphthoflavone, phenobarbital, acetone and dexamethasone) increased PL N-dealkylase activity in liver microsomes. Furthermore, antibodies raised against P450-1A and -3A enzymes suppressed PL N-desisopropylation in a concentration-dependent manner, but P450-2E antibody did not. Reconstitution studies showed that P450-1A1, -1A2, -2E1 and -3A2 exhibited catalytic activities for PL N-dealkylation. These results suggest that P450-1A2 is a major PL N-desisopropylase in the PL-treated rats, and P450-3A related enzyme(s) and P450-2E1 as a moderate or minor enzyme are also involved in PL N-dealkylation in native and PL-treated rats.", 
    "11": "The objectives of this study were to apply the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) guideline for heart failure to the measurement of quality of care in the ambulatory setting, to compare the results for two large practices and to design an educational intervention for the two practices being studied.", 
    "12": "A retrospective chart review was conducted on a random sample of 50 patients with heart failure selected from each of two outpatient practices: the general internal medicine practice and the family medicine practice at a large academic medical center. Five medical review criteria were developed from the AHCPR guideline for heart failure to compare the two practices with each other and the guidelines.

    "13": "Assessment of left ventricular function occurred in 79% of all cases. Of eligible patients, 68% were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is). Of those patients treated with enalapril and captopril, 30% and 12%, respectively, were receiving the target dose as defined in the AHCPR guidelines. Of patients not eligible for treatment with ACE-Is, none were treated with hydralazine and nitrates. When the ejection fraction was less than or equal to 40%, 81% of eligible patients were treated with ACE-Is, whereas 59% were treated with ACE-Is when the ejection fraction was greater than 40%. Calcium channel blockers were used in the treatment of 42% of patients. A statistical difference (P = .05) was found between the two practices for documentation of left ventricular function, the use of ACE-Is for patients with ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%, and the use of calcium channel blockers and beta blockers.", 
    "14": "In the practices studied, there is underutilization of the documentation of left ventricular function, ACE-Is in eligible patients, target doses of ACE-Is, and the use of hydralazine and nitrates for ineligible patients. A higher proportion of patients receive ACE-I therapy when the ejection fraction is less than or equal to 40%. There may be inappropriate use of calcium channel blockers in some patients. There is unexplained clinical variation between the two practices studied.", 
    "15": "Scorpion venoms contain active neurotoxins known to act selectively at the level of voltage sensitive Na+ and K+ channels on mammal nervous system. In the present report, we show for the first time that the venom of scorpion Buthus occitanus tunetanus (Bot) contains compounds able to activate another cell function in non excitable cells. Addition of this venom to the culture media of 3T3-L1 adipocytes or freshly dissociated rat adipocytes rapidly increases lipolysis as estimated by glycerol release (approximately 3 to 4 fold over basal values) in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 approximately 12 +/- 1.25 micrograms/ml; n = 3). Bot venom effect was lower and not additive to the effect produced by isoproterenol (IPE) (10 microM), a main lipolytic agent, n = 3. In Sephadex G-50 size exclusion chromatography, the lipolytic activity was excluded and not associated to the included neurotoxic fraction. Furthermore, no lipolytic effect could be detected in the Na+ channel specific toxin II purified from Androctonus australis hector (AaHII) or the K+ voltage-dependent channel toxin from Androctonus mauritanicus mauritanicus (KTx). Propranolol (a non selective beta adrenoreceptor (beta AR) antagonist), alprenolol and pindolol (selective beta 1/beta 2 antagonists) totally inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the lipolytic response to Bot venom (IC50 approximately 1 x 10(-7), 7.5 x 10(-8) and 3 x 10(-7)M, respectively), suggesting that venom stimulated lipolysis through the beta AR pathway. The pharmacological profiles of molecules acting more selectively on beta AR subtypes such as CGP 12177 (beta 1/ beta 2 antagonist with beta 3 agonist properties), CGP 20712A (beta 1 antagonist) and ICI 118551 (beta 2 antagonist) strongly suggest that lipolytic action of venom mainly involves the beta 2/beta 1 AR subtypes.", 
    "16": "In the present double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 36 untreated patients (57.8 +/- 8.4 years) with mild to moderate hypertension were included. After a 14 days' placebo period they were treated with a combination of 20 mg retarded nifedipine and 25 or 50 mg atenolol for six weeks each. Group A started with 25 mg, group B with 50 mg atenolol. Casual sitting blood pressure was measured automatically every second week, routine laboratory parameters and side effects were evaluated at the end of placebo and the verum periods. The blood pressure of the two groups was comparable during placebo and was reduced by 31.6/14.7 mmHg in group A or 29.9/15.8 mmHg in group B (p < 0.001 vs. placebo) after six weeks. In the second treatment period with verum, blood pressure was not further reduced. Both combinations were equally efficient also in the female and the elder subgroups (> 60 years) who were characterized by higher systolic blood pressure. The response rates were 83% and 86% for the combination with 25 and 50 mg atenolol respectively. Heart rate was significantly reduced in all groups during 50 mg atenolol. Laboratory parameters were not altered by treatment. Frequency and severeness of side effects were equal in both groups. It is concluded that in patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension the combination of 20 mg retarded nifedipine with 25 mg atenolol is equally efficient to the combination with 50 mg atenolol.", 
    "17": "A heptadecapeptide (orphanin FQ or nociceptin) was recently identified as an endogenous ligand for the orphan opioid-like receptor. Here we report that intrathecal orphanin FQ produces dose-dependent depression of a spinal nociceptive flexor reflex in the rat. Furthermore, administration of orphanin FQ in rats with intrathecal catheters produced behavioural antinociception in the tail flick test with no signs of sedation or motor impairment. The reflex depressive effect of orphanin FQ was not reversed by antagonists of opioidergic, alpha 2-adrenergic and GABA-A receptors. Thus, orphanin FQ may suppress nociceptive input at the spinal level through an novel mechanism. Orphanin FQ or agonists of its receptor may represent novel analgesics for pain conditions which are not responsive to existing pharmacological therapy.", 
    "18": "In order to investigate the role of the 5-HT1A receptors of the amygdala in modulating anxiety, rats were implanted with bilateral cannulae aimed at the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala complex and infused with either artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) or the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (50-200 ng) and tested in two animal models of anxiety. In the elevated plus-maze test, no significant effects were detected in this dose range. In contrast, 8-OH-DPAT caused an overall reduction in levels of social investigation, thus indicating anxiogenic actions in the social interaction test. At 50 ng, 8-OH-DPAT had a selective action on anxiety, while at 200 ng there was a concomitant reduction in locomotor activity and, in some animals, signs of the 5-HT1A syndrome. Evidence that the anxiogenic effect of 8-OH-DPAT (50 ng) was due to activation of 5-HT1A receptors came from the finding that (-)-tertatolol, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, reversed this effect at a dose (1.5 micrograms) which was silent when given alone. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist, midazolam (1 and 2 micrograms) was bilaterally administered into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala and evoked clear-cut anxiolytic effects in the social interaction test. These data indicate that the agonist activation of post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala may produce anxiogenic effects, while agonist activation of BDZ receptors in the same areas evokes anxiolytic effects. Our results from the social interaction test are similar to those previously reported from tests of anxiety using punished paradigms, but contrast with those found in the elevated plus-maze. Thus, it is concluded that either the two tests have different sensitivities to midazolam and 8-OH-DPAT or more intriguingly, the tests are evoking fundamentally different states of anxiety, with that evoked by the plus-maze being mediated via brain areas or receptors different from those studied here.", 
    "19": "The study was conducted on the patients suffering from left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Ninety four cases of LVH were randomly divided into treated group (74 cases) and control group (20 cases) treated with Xinjikang capsule (XJK) and Metoprolo respectively. The results showed that XJK has remarkable reverse effects on LVH (P < 0.01). The control group although showed some effect of improvement, in comparison with pretreatmental measurement the difference was insignificanty (P > 0.05). While in comparing the two groups, the difference of effect was very significant (P < 0.01). XJK could also alleviate and eliminate to the cause of LVH, such as improving heart function and microcirculation, decreasing blood viscosity, apolipoprotein, myocardial oxygen consumption, increasing superoxide dismutase. All these parameters measured after XJK treatment were significantly different from that before treatment. The difference of them between XJK treated group and control group was also significant (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). It suggested XJK capsule has reversing effect on LVH.",

All the hospitals in Sweden with a coronary care unit or its equivalent were sent a postal enquiry about early heart attack care including use of various medications and educational level of health care providers. In all, 84 of 86 hospitals (98%) answered the enquiry. Prior to hospital admission, 10% of the hospitals used thrombolytic agents, 10% used beta-blockers and 55% used aspirin. In only 4% of hospitals was thrombolytic treatment initiated in the emergency department and in 17% beta-blockers were initiated. The proportion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients who received thrombolytic treatment varied from 10% to more than 80%, with a mean value of 41%. The proportion of AMI patients who received intravenous beta-blockade varied from 0 to 93%, with a mean value of 24%. This survey indicates that the vast majority of hospitals in Sweden use thrombolytic agents in more than 30% of AMI patients and aspirin in more than 80% of AMI patients. The use of intravenous beta-blockade is lower than expected. Considering the strong association between the delay before instituting therapy and outcome, it is surprising that treatment is not initiated more frequently outside hospital or in the emergency department.",

The Karakul breed is a unique model for the study of adipocyte metabolism in that a wide range of adipocyte volumes exist within an individual, and the Karakul adipose tissue appears to be particularly sensitive to adrenergic regulation.", 
    "38": "The relationship between the Ki of the B2 adrenoceptor and EC50 values characterizing receptor down-regulation induced by isoproterenol and six beta antagonists classified as having weak to strong intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) was determined using L6 myoblasts. It was hypothesized that if receptor loss induced by beta antagonists with ISA was mediated through cAMP, EC50 = Ki. EC50/Ki ratios for (-)isoproterenol, (-) and (+) celiprolol were 0.006, 0.01 and 0.08, respectively (p < 0.05); ratios for (-)pindolol and dilevalol were 19 and 9.5, respectively (p < 0.05). EC50/Ki ratios for acebutalol and (-)alprenolol were not significantly different from 1.0. Isoproterenol and dilevalol maximally down-regulated receptor density 89 and 83%, respectively, followed by (+)celiprolol, 54%; (-)celiprolol, 53%; acebutalol, 41%; (-)pindolol, 36% and (-)alprenolol, 31%. Receptor loss was blocked in each case by ICI118,551 or sotalol. A sensitive radioimmunoassay failed to detect increased cAMP accumulation following pretreatment with concentrations of acebutalol, (-)alprenolol, celiprolol and (-)pindolol 100 times their respective Ki values. Isoproterenol and dilevalol stimulated cAMP accumulation 100- and 2-fold over basal, respectively. We conclude that receptor loss induced by beta antagonists with ISA is mediated through the beta 2 adrenoceptor and in at least some cases is cAMP-independent.", 
    "39": "The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and the polysomnographic findings of a sample of patients affected by sleep-related painful erections (SRPE). In a 6-y period 18 patients were diagnosed as having SRPE. The mean age at the onset of the disease was 39.8 +/- 11.6 y and the mean duration of SRPE was 5.4 +/- 3.5 y. According to ICSD criteria, about 60% of patients had a severe form of the disease. None of the patients met any DSM IV Axis-I and Axis-II diagnoses. Twelve patients complained of excessive daytime sleepiness. SRPE patients, compared to age-matched controls, showed a reduced sleep efficiency, an increased wake after sleep onset and a reduced percentage of REM sleep. This study confirms that in SRPE there are no clear predisposing factors, no familial pattern, but REM sleep fragmentation. Concerning the pharmacological treatment, in the history of patients, propranolol and paroxetine, but not amitriptiline and lorazepam, showed a temporary efficacy in some patients.", 
    "40": "The fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension complicating pregnancy primarily results from pre-eclampsia. This review focuses on recent developments in the areas of prevention and management. It specifically analyses studies designed to determine whether low-dose aspirin or calcium supplements, taken throughout pregnancy, reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia, a debate on whether we have been too aggressive in terminating pregnancies in patients with severe pre-eclampsia remote from term, and the efficacy of parenteral magnesium sulfate in the prevention or treatment, or both, of the eclamptic convulsion. We conclude that neither aspirin nor calcium appears to improve the gestational outcome, although large trials currently under way may alter this view. The debate on 'conservative' versus aggressive management of early-onset severe pre-eclampsia seems to be more apparent than real. After years of acrimonious debate there are data to support the superiority of magnesium over phenytoin to prevent pre-eclampsia and the efficacy of the drug in reducing recurrent convulsions in eclampsia. However, whether 'prophylactic' therapy is indeed necessary or whether blood pressure control alone will prevent eclampsia remains to be determined.", 
    "41": "MORTALITY FROM MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: Primary prevention of coronary heart disease in hypertension is important because the mortality among those who have suffered a myocardial infarction is around 50% within 1 month of the infarction. Although the mortality of those who reach hospital has about halved over the last decade (to about 8%), prevention is the only way to affect coronary mortality overall. OVERALL PREVENTION OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE: There are several proven strategies, involving both drugs and lifestyle changes. Stopping smoking is the most powerful, but exercise and reduction of dietary fats and salt are also important; the latter will need co-operation with the food industry. TREATING HYPERTENSIVES WITH A CORONARY RISK: Lipid-lowering drugs will be needed for some, but not all hypertensives, depending on the coronary risk. Some drug treatments which lower blood pressure (e.g. short-acting formulations of nifedipine) may not reduce the coronary risk; further data or newer preparations are awaited. Potassium-sparing diuretics (particularly in elderly patients) and/or beta-blockers remain the first choice for primary prevention. If a calcium channel blocker is needed, verapamil or diltiazem are useful in patients with no left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "42": "The purpose of this study was to compare 2% dorzolamide three times daily with 2% pilocarpine four times daily to determine patient preference, tolerability, and impact on daily life in patients concurrently receiving 0.5% timolol twice daily for treatment of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Seventy-five patients were enrolled in this 4-week, randomized, two-period, crossover study. The Comparison of Ophthalmic Medications for Tolerability questionnaire was used to assess patient preference and perception of side effects and activity limitations resulting from the study medications. IOP measurements were obtained 2 hours after drops were instilled and visual field tests were performed at baseline and at the end of each crossover period. Significantly more patients receiving pilocarpine than dorzolamide reported adverse experiences and discontinued the drug because of these adverse experiences. Similarly, patients reported more interference with their daily life because of side effects and activity limitations when receiving pilocarpine. Vision difficulties, accommodation difficulties, and brow ache were reported more often and were considered more bothersome by patients receiving pilocarpine. Bitter/unusual taste was reported more frequently and was considered more bothersome by patients receiving dorzolamide. Patients also reported missing fewer doses and were more satisfied with their medication when receiving dorzolamide. All of these changes were considered statistically significant. IOP control was not significantly different with either dorzolamide or pilocarpine. However, patients experienced a significant worsening of the mean defect of automated visual field examinations when receiving pilocarpine. At the end of the study, among patients with a preference, dorzolamide was preferred to pilocarpine by a ratio of more than 9:1. Overall, 81.9% of patients preferred dorzolamide. Thus dorzolamide demonstrated better tolerability and less adverse impact on daily life than pilocarpine.", 
    "43": "Treatment of high blood pressure has considerably postponed the development of heart failure in these patients. The repercussions of high blood pressure on the heart first consist in diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricule and then in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are to be considered as the drugs of first choice in these patients. In the future, beta-blockers could play an important role in the management in some categories of patients.", 
    "44": "The purpose of this study was to describe the prognosis during 5 years of follow-up in a consecutive population of patients discharged from hospital after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in relation to clinical history, level of initial care, complications during hospitalization, and medication at discharge. All patients admitted to a single hospital from February 15, 1986 to November 9, 1987 due to AMI, regardless of age and whether or not they were treated in the coronary care unit, and who were discharged alive from hospital were included in the study. There were 862 patients with AMI, 740 of whom were discharged alive. Information on medication at discharge was available in 713 patients (96%). In a multivariate analysis taking into account age, sex, history of cardiovascular diseases, whether patients were admitted to coronary care unit or not, complications during hospitalization, and medication at discharge, the following factors appeared to be independent predictors of mortality: age (p < 0.001), history of AMI (p < 0.001), congestive heart failure in hospital (p < 0.001), whether beta-blockers had been prescribed at discharge (p < 0.01), and a history of diabetes (p < 0.01). This study indicates that in consecutive patients surviving the hospital phase of AMI, the development of complications while in hospital and the manner in which medication was prescribed at discharge independently influenced their long-term prognosis, but age was the most important factor in long-term prognosis.", 
    "45": "There are a number of cardiovascular conditions in which calcium channel antagonists (CCAs) are accepted as first-line therapy, including Prinzmetal's angina and Raynaud's phenomenon. The real issue is whether symptomatic relief of angina or effective reduction of blood pressure (BP) is matched by a good safety record. In effort angina, verapamil is as safe as metoprolol, and nifedipine (tablet form) is as safe as atenolol. In unstable angina, intravenous diltiazem is better than intravenous nitroglycerin; there are no similar data on beta-blockade. Short-acting nifedipine is contraindicated in unstable angina. There is no place for CCAs in acute phase myocardial infarction and short-acting nifedipine is contraindicated. In the post-MI phase, two specific groups of patients benefit from diltiazem or verapamil: (1) those who had non-Q-wave infarcts and (2) those who are hypertensive. The DAVIT studies argue for the safety and efficacy of verapamil but do not allow comparisons with standard beta-blocker therapy. In the treatment of hypertension, the recommendation often made that a low-dose diuretic should be first-line therapy holds for the elderly with systolic hypertension but is not based on prospective studies in the case of younger patients. High-dose diuretics may have adverse effects, as reported in two case-controlled studies. Prospective outcome data favoring beta-blocker monotherapy as first-line therapy are limited, especially in the elderly, while case-control studies suggest an increased incidence of cardiac death in those treated by beta-blockers. CCAs may be the preferred first-line antihypertensive treatment for those groups in whom low-dose diuretics are unlikely to work as monotherapy.", 
    "46": "Fast-absorbed and short-acting dihydropyridines (e.g., nifedipine capsules) cause intermittent hemodynamic effects associated with sympathetic hyperactivity. In contrast, long-acting dihydropyridines, such as nifedipine GITS and amlodipine, provide, during chronic treatment, stable hemodynamic effects with little or no activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This markedly different pattern of hemodynamic changes may explain why the short-acting drugs cause little to no regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, may make angina worse, and may negatively affect cardiac outcome, whereas the long-acting drugs decrease LV mass as anticipated from the fall in blood pressure and, at least in stable coronary artery disease, produce an outcome comparable with beta-blockers. In hypertension, beta-blocker treatment appears to be associated with a short fall in positive outcome, perhaps in part related to increased rates of sudden death. Such an adverse outcome may also be due to sympathetic hyperactivity, possibly during treatment via cardiac alpha-receptors, but also during the common short periods of noncompliance due to actual increased sympathetic responses. For both drug classes, we suggest that long-acting agents be considered, providing therapeutic coverage well beyond the normal dosing interval.", 
    "47": "1. Marked action potential duration (APD) prolongation with agents such quinidine is often a precursor of early after-depolarizations and triggered activity, thought to be underlying mechanism of torsade de pointes. Episodes of torsade de pointes commonly occur following a pause. 2. We recently demonstrated that quinidine, but not disopyramide, produced marked further prolongation of APD immediately following pauses of 2-10s interpolated into a basic drive train in canine Purkinje fibres. 3. We report here experiments aimed at further elucidating the mechanisms of this phenomenon. 4. We used standard microelectrode techniques to record action potentials from canine Purkinje fibres driven at a baseline interstimulus interval (ISI) of 1000 ms. 5. We were able to reproduce the phenomenon of post-pause prolongation of APD with amitriptyline, which blocks both sodium and potassium channels, as does quinidine. Furthermore, we showed that the kinetics of interaction of amitriptyline, with the sodium channel, are similar to those known to exist for quinidine (time constant of recovery from blockade 2.3 +/- 0.6s). 6. In contrast, we were unable to reproduce post-pause prolongation of APD with three pure class III antiarrhythmic agents, D-sotalol, clofilium and dofetilide. 7. We propose that quinidine and amitriptyline behave similarly, in that they both produce two separate, opposing effects on APD. During a pause, the sodium channel-blocking action of these compounds diminishes exponentially, allowing the potassium channel blocking effect to become manifest as post-pause prolongation of APD. None of D-sotalol, clofilium or dofetilide exhibits significant sodium channel blockade and, thus, these agents do not manifest post-pause prolongation of repolarization. Disopyramide does produce sodium channel blockade, but recovery from this effect is much slower than for quinidine or amitriptyline (time constant 12-50s). Thus, we propose insufficient recovery occurs during the intervals under study to uncover the action potential-prolonging effect of the unopposed potassium channel blockade for disopyramide.", 
    "48": "In 2 infants with asplenic syndrome associated with total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), a repair of TAPVR was done under mild hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) using esmolol, an ultra short-acting beta-blocker to obtain good operative field without aortic-cross clamping. Both cases were weaned from CPB uneventfully. Pulmonary venous obstruction was not found after surgery. This strategy seems to be applicable in pediatric cardiac surgery which is mainly limited to the atrial level.", 
    "49": "1. Cardiovascular effects of centrally administered endothelin-1 (ET-1) were studied in control and propranolol-treated anesthetized rats using a radioactive microsphere technique. 2. In the control group, blood pressure, cardiac output, and stroke volume were decreased, and heart rate was not altered after the administration of ET-1.ET-1 produced a reduction in blood flow to the brain, heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, portal system, musculoskeletal system, and skin. 3. Propranolol significantly attenuated the decrease in blood pressure, cardiac output and stroke volume induced by centrally administered ET-1. The reduction in blood flow to the brain, heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, portal system, musculoskeletal system and skin induced by centrally administered ET-1 was blocked by propranolol. 4. It is concluded that centrally administered ET produces significant cardiovascular effects which are mediated through the sympathetic nervous system and could be antagonized by propranolol. These findings can also be helpful in explaining some of the beneficial effects of propranolol in various cardiovascular disorders involving central ET mechanisms.", 
    "50": "1. The effect of R-alpha-methylhistamine, a histamine H1 receptor agonist, was studied on cardiovascular hemodynamics in bilateral vagotomized, anesthetized guinea pigs. 2. R-alpha-methylhistamine (100 micrograms/kg, IV) a dose that selectively activates histamine H3 receptors, produced hypotension and bradycardia. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) and rate pressure product (RPP) were also decreased at this dose. 3. Pretreatment with the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium (20 mg/kg, IV) blocked the blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), TPR, and RPP effects of R-alpha-methylhistamine (100 micrograms/kg, IV). Hexamethonium did not block the hypotensive and TPR lowering actions of the muscarinic agonist methacholine (1 and 3 micrograms/kg, IV). 4. Pretreatment with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.5 mg/kg IV), blocked R-alpha-methylhistamine's (100 micrograms/kg, IV) effects on BP, TPR, and RPP. Prazosin did not antagonize the bradycardia effect of R-alpha-methylhistamine. 5. Pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (1 mg/kg, IV) did not alter the BP, TPR, or RPP actions of R-alpha-methylhistamine. The HR effects of R-alpha-methylhistamine were blocked by atenolol. 6. The hemodynamic effects of R-alpha-methylhistamine were compared to the hemodynamic profile of the calcium channel blocker, verapamil (0.5 mg/kg, IV). Verapamil had little effect on TRP and had a greater cardiac depressant effect as evidenced by a significant reduction in HR and cardiac output (CO). 7. In summary, these results show that activation of prejunctional H3 receptors with R-alpha-methylhistamine decreases basal, BP, HR, TPR, and RPP in anesthetized guinea pigs. The fall in BP is mediated by a decrease in TPR. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of R-alpha-methylhistamine on sympathetic control of the vasculature appears to impart a greater physiologic effect on the H3-histamine mediated hypotension than its inhibitory effects on sympathetic agents to the heart.", 
    "51": "The modulation of the production of prostacyclin and thromboxane from cat and cat aortic tissue slices by different vasoactive agents has been studied in order to reveal whether the release of these main two vasoactive prostanoids goes in parallel or may be controlled independently. Norepinephrine, isoproterenol, phentolamine, propranolol, angiotensin II, vasopressin, bradykinin, thrombin, verapamil, gallopamil, dopamine or methionin enkephalin were added to the incubation medium and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of prostacyclin) and TxB2 (the stable metabolite of thromboxane) were determined in the supernatant by radioimmunoassay. The ratio of the release of prostacyclin and thromboxane was computed. Norepinephrine increased both prostacyclin and thromboxane release. Isoproterenol increased the ratio of prostacyclin and thromboxane released in cat aortic tissue slices. Phentolamine and propranolol had no effects. Angiotensin II induced a slight but statistically insignificant increase in the ratio of the two prostanoids released. Vasopressin increased thromboxane release only. Bradykinin stimulated the prostacyclin while thrombin stimulated the thromboxane release. Verapamil decreased both prostacyclin and thromboxane production. Gallopamil decreased prostacyclin release and increased thromboxane release from vessel wall slices in a certain concentration range causing a characteristic dose dependent minimum in the ratio of prostacyclin and thromboxane release. Dopamine separately increased prostacyclin release while enkephalin had no significant effect. The data obtained show that in vascular tissue some unidentified yet cytophysiological mechanisms might exist which specifically control the activities of the prostacyclin synthase and thromboxane synthase enzymes.", 
    "52": "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a key inducer of differentiation of uncommitted T helper (TH) cells toward the TH1 phenotype, which regulates cellular immunity, whereas IL-10 inhibits TH1 functions and potentiates TH2-regulated responses (i.e., humoral immunity). To examine the potential effects of stress on TH1/TH2 balance, we studied the ability of three prototype stress hormones-dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) and the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine-to alter the production of IL-12 (p70) and IL-10 induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in human whole blood. Dexamethasone inhibited LPS-induced bioactive IL-12 production in a dose-dependent fashion and at physiologically relevant concentrations; it had no effect on IL-10 secretion. The glucocorticoid-induced reduction of IL-12 production was antagonized by RU 486, a glucocorticoid-receptor antagonist, suggesting that it was mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. Norepinephrine and epinephrine also suppressed IL-12 production in a dose-dependent fashion and at physiological concentrations; both catecholamines, however, dose-dependently increased the production of IL-10. The effects of either catecholamine on IL-12 or IL-10 secretion were blocked completely by propranolol, a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, indicating that they were mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor. These findings suggest that the central nervous system may regulate IL-12 and IL-10 secretion and, hence, TH1/TH2 balance via the peripheral end-effectors of the stress system. Thus, stress may cause a selective suppression of TH1 functions and a shift toward a TH2 cytokine pattern rather than generalized TH suppression. The TH1-to-TH2 shift may be responsible for the stress-induced susceptibility of the organism to certain infections. Through the same or a reciprocal mechanism, states associated with chronic hyperactivity or hypoactivity of the stress system might influence the susceptibility of an individual to certain autoimmune, allergic, infectious, or neoplastic diseases.", 
    "53": "The association of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) production as well as arachidonic acid release with the phospholipase D (PLD)-linked mechanism was studied in rat peritoneal mast cells. Stimulation of mast cells with cross-linking of the high-affinity Fc receptor for IgE caused increases in the release of arachidonic acid and PGD2, which are suppressed almost completely by ethanol or RHC 80267, a diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor. Ethanol did not influence inositol phosphate release in response to an antigen. An increase in diacylglycerol, that is inhibited by propranolol, was observed, with a peak within 1 min. Antigen stimulation induced little production of lysophosphatidylcholine, while ionomycin as a control markedly induced the production. However, the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity in the cytosol of antigen-stimulated cells increased to the level in ionomycin-stimulated cells. The addition of the ADP-ribosylation factor-containing fraction prepared from bovine brain, that is known to specifically activate PLD, to permeabilized mast cells in the presence of GTP gamma S, apparently increased arachidonic acid and PGD2 release, but not in the presence of ethanol. Furthermore, arachidonic acid release by an antigen was enhanced by melittin, that activates PLA2, but PGD2 production was not. These results suggest that antigen-stimulated PGD2 production as well as arachidonic acid release are strongly associated with the sequential PLD-linked pathway.", 
    "54": "We previously reported that blockade of the phosphoinositide breakdown response to the sodium channel agonist veratrine provides a simple measure of local anesthetic actions at sodium channels. For such a model to be considered useful, it should show specificity for compounds whose primary actions are not upon sodium channels, but which have local anesthetic properties at high concentrations. In addition, it should be able appropriately to distinguish local anesthetic enantiomers. Such results were found in the present study. Thus, (-)-propranolol inhibited the phosphoinositide breakdown response to veratrine with an IC50 value of -20 microM, whereas the response to the sodium ionophore monensin was not affected. With respect to local anesthetic enantiomers, (S)-RAC-109 was 4-fold more potent than the (R)-enantiomer, IC50 values of -5 and -20 microM, respectively, being found. A considerable reduction in potency was, however, found when the side chain was lengthened by one carbon atom (IC50 for the racemate >100 microM). Such a pattern of activity is consistent with the literature, and further validates the use of blockade of veratrine-stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown as a simple biochemical measure of local anesthetic effects at sodium channels.", 
    "55": "The authors have shown that stimulation of cardiac alpha 1-adrenoceptors confers immediate cardioprotection in the isolated rat heart against post-ischemic dysfunction, and have recently demonstrated that in vivo treatment of rats with norepinephrine (NE) induces cardiac heat shock protein 72 and myocardial adaptation to ischemia 24 h after treatment. To characterize the delayed myocardial adaptive response induced by NE further, the present study examined its time course and effects of adrenoceptor antagonism and protein synthesis inhibition on this adaptive response during optimal myocardial protection. Rats were treated with NE (3.1 mumol/kg, i.p.) or normal saline (0.4 ml, i.p.), and hearts isolated at 2, 4, 24, 72 and 168 h after injection. Isolated hearts were subjected to 25 min of normothermic global ischemia and 40 min of reperfusion by the Langendorff technique, and left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) was assessed. There was no difference in baseline LVDP among groups. Post-ischemic LVDP recovered to 44.7 +/- 2.1 mmHg in pooled saline control. LVDP was significantly improved in hearts isolated at 4, 24 and 72 h after injection of NE (66.3 +/- 3.8, 68.6 +/- 2.7 and 72.6 +/- 8.3 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.05 v control) but not in hearts isolated at 2 or 168 h. Effects of antecedent adrenoceptor antagonism and protein synthesis inhibition were examined in hearts isolated at 72 h after NE treatment. Prazosin pretreatment (2.4 mumol/kg, i.p.) abolished the delayed myocardial adaptive response induced by NE at 72 h (post-ischemic LVDP 48.3 +/- 6.1 mmHg, P > 0.05 v control) while propranolol pretreatment (3.4 mumol/kg, i.p.) had no effect (post-ischemic LVDP 67.3 +/- 3.7 mmHg, P < 0.05 v control). Cycloheximide pretreatment (3.6 mumol/kg, i.p.) also abolished the beneficial effect of NE at 72 h (post-ischemic LVDP 50.2 +/- 6.0 mmHg, P > 0.05 v control). In conclusion, administration of NE to rats can induce delayed and sustained cardioprotection against post-ischemic myocardial dysfunction. NE-induced myocardial adaptation to ischemia at 72 h is mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors and appears to require protein synthesis.", 
    "56": "The involvement of NOergic nerve in vagal reflex-mediated tracheal dilatation during bronchoconstriction was investigated using the guinea pig in vivo tracheo-bronchi separated preparation. Inhalation of 0.01% histamine to the bronchial site induced a biphasic, vagal reflex tracheal response, i.e., constriction followed by dilatation slightly after bronchial constriction. The reflex tracheal dilatation was inhibited by 49% by local treatment of the tracheal site with 1% propranolol. The residual dilatation in the presence of atropine and propranolol was significantly inhibited by 1% oxyhemoglobin or 1% carboxy-PTIO, NO scavengers. Cyclic GMP content in the tissue of the tracheal site during the reflex tracheal dilatation significantly increased. The increase in cyclic GMP was reduced by treatment of the tracheal site with 1% N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. These results support a hypothesis that reflex tracheal dilatation during bronchoconstriction may be mediated by not only adrenergic but also NOergic nerves in guinea pigs.", 
    "57": "Evaluation of safety and efficacy of new drugs is based largely on data from clinical trials involving a limited number of patients. This approach does not necessarily detect the rare adverse events that may only be observed when very large numbers of patients are studied. Consequently, we designed a double-blind 12-week trial comparing the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril (n = 5,053), with a well-established beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, metoprolol (n = 506). Essentially hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mm Hg) received either 10 mg quinapril or 50 mg metoprolol once daily, and the doses were doubled at 4-week intervals to a maximum of 40 and 200 mg, respectively, in nonresponders. Responder rates were similar under both regimens. Adverse events were assessed by interview as well as by a standard questionnaire. The overall prevalence of adverse events reported by standard questionnaire was higher than that reported spontaneously during interviews. With respect to typical ACE inhibitor adverse reactions (e.g. cough and taste disturbances), there was no difference between quinapril and metoprolol independent of the mode of reporting. In summary, both drugs showed comparable overall tolerance and safety. The discrepancy between spontaneously reported and questionnaire-reported adverse events was noteworthy, and this finding prevailed in a volunteer group of 327 patients who were treated with quinapril for 52 weeks. Thus, a questionnaire is of great significance in addition to the patient history/interview in a large-scale, double-blind study designed to learn about details of drug safety.", 
    "58": "In a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel study, we assessed basal and post-therapeutic sympathetic activity both in supine and standing positions in mildly to moderately hypertensive patients by two different methods: frequency domain indices of heart rate variability (HRV) and plasma levels of both noradrenaline (NA) and its metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DOPEG). Patients were evaluated on placebo and after 8 weeks of treatment with either cilazapril, 2.5-5 mg/day (13 patients) or atenolol, 50-100 mg/day (14 patients). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure was similarly reduced (p < 0.01) by both cilazapril and atenolol. Heart rate decreased with atenolol by 14 beats per min (p < 0.001) but did not change with cilazapril. When compared to the placebo, cilazapril did not modify sympathetic activity indices of HRV but did significantly reduce NA and DOPEG levels in both the supine and standing (p < 0.05) positions. As expected, atenolol reduced (p < 0.05) sympathetic activity indices of HRV but did not modify NA levels in either position. Moreover, while on placebo, patients showed no significant correlations between values of NA or DOPEG, nor in any of the HRV indices. We conclude that: (1) the antihypertensive effects of cilazapril and atenolol are similar, but in these patients, sympathetic activity indices showed divergent results both before and after therapy; (2) this may be due to different aspects of sympathetic activators, assessed independently by different methods, and (3) these discrepancies must be taken into account when evaluating autonomous nervous system parameters.",

    "60": "Large conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels were studied in smooth muscle cells enzymatically dissociated from rabbit pulmonary artery. The current-voltage relationship of single channels recorded in cell-attached patches revealed strong inward rectification, which disappeared after patch excision. Cell permeabilization with saponin, beta-escin or equinatoxin II also removed rectification. These observations imply the existence of fast open channel block by an intracellular substance(s). Application to the cytosolic side of inside-out patches of Na+ ions, mono- di- and trinucleotides, taurine, reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione, or peptides extracted from pulmonary artery smooth muscle, did not reproduce the inward rectification. Patch treatment with either alkaline phosphatase or protein kinase A alpha-subunit, which strongly affected open state probability, was also incapable of reducing the outward single channel current. Mg2+ ions applied from the cytosolic side induced concentration- and voltage-dependent block of the outward single channel currents with a Kd of 7.9 +/- 2.3 mM, resulting in inward rectification qualitatively similar to that observed in cell-attached patches. An increase in the Mg2+ concentration of the intracellular solution induced a significant decrease in the outward whole-cell current at depolarized potentials. Another putative endogenous channel blocker, the polyamine putrescine, was not effective. However, its metabolites spermidine and spermine reduced the amplitude of the outward single channel current with Kd values of 4.9 +/- 0.6 and 1.4 +/- 0.4 mM, respectively. Pre-incubation of the cells with the irreversible inhibitor of polyamine synthesis difluoromethylornithine abolished the rectification in the cell-attached patches. These results suggest that intracellular polyamines may underlie at least part of the inward rectification of the Ca2+ activated K+ channel in this tissue, but that intracellular Mg2+ is unlikely to play a major role.",

    "62": "In order to evaluate the effect of beta-blocking agents with and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) on work efficiency in healthy subjects, we studied the haemodynamic and gas exchange parameters, as well as blood lactate concentrations, during a graded maximal bicycle exercise test performed after perorally given propranolol (PRO) and pindolol (PIN) in seven healthy men. The medications (PRO: 80 mg x 2/day, PIN: 10 mg x 2/day, for seven days) were given in a placebo (PLA) controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over fashion. Both the drugs reduced heart rate and blood pressure during exercise equally compared with the placebo. The oxygen uptake at submaximal work loads, as well as at the maximum, was constantly and equally reduced by PRO and PIN compared with PLA. The anaerobic threshold was reached at a slightly lower oxygen uptake for both the drugs compared with the placebo (P < 0.05). No significant difference was, however, observed in the work levels at which the ventilatory anaerobic threshold was reached. Moreover, the gross efficiency, i.e. the amount of work performed at a certain energy consumption level (aerobic + anaerobic), was increased by both PRO (26.7 +/- 0.5%, P < 0.02 vs PLA: 24.7 +/- 0.5%) and PIN (26.5 +/- 0.5%, P < 0.05 vs PLA) at a submaximal work load of 240 W. The results indicate that beta-blocking agents propranolol and pindolol slightly and equally reduce maximal work performance, but increase the efficiency of submaximal work in a way that a certain amount of external work can be done with smaller consumption of oxygen. These findings may contribute to the benefit of beta-blocking agents in patients with coronary heart disease.",

    "64": "After 4 days of drug treatment with comparable doses of propranolol (40 and 80 mg), metoprolol (50 and 100 mg), or placebo, mood (POMS) and anxiety states (STAI) were assessed in healthy volunteers, before and after 1 h of treadmill walking exercise at 50% maximum oxygen uptake.", 
    "65": "Compared to placebo, resting \"tension\", \"depression\", and \"total mood disturbance\" were significantly higher on propranolol 80 mg, but all were reduced with exercise. \"Fatigue\" and \"confusion\" were also higher on propranolol, and were unaffected by exercise. \"Fatigue\" was also higher than placebo after exercise on metoprolol 100 mg. \"Anxiety\" was unaffected by drug treatment or exercise.", 
    "66": "The evidence that beta blockers, and particularly propranolol, have adverse effects on mood was confirmed. It would be preferable to prescribe a beta blocker which does not adversely alter mood states. However, exercise significantly reduced the measures of \"tension\" and \"depression\" which were adversely increased by propranolol. Exercise prescription may therefore not only be compatible with beta blockade, but a highly desirable adjuvant therapy.", 
    "67": "1. The effect of beta-adrenoceptor activation on release of the neutrophil chemoattractant, interleukin-8 (IL-8), was examined in human transformed bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE cells). 2. The combined beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, time- (100 nM, 2-18 h) and concentration- (1-30 nM) dependently increased IL-8 protein content in the cell culture supernatant as measured by an enzyme immunosorbent assay standardized for DNA by fluoro-colorimetry. 3. Isoprenaline (1-100 nM, 15 min) increased cyclic AMP concentration-dependently. 4. The effect of isoprenaline (100 nM) was inhibited by the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (10 microM). The maximum magnitude of IL-8 increase caused by beta-adrenoceptor activation was 40% of that caused by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha 100 ng ml-1). 5. The selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (1 microM), increased IL-8 protein similarly to isoprenaline and the cyclic AMP analogue, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mM) produced a corresponding effect. 6. Pretreatment with isoprenaline (100 nM) followed by TNF-alpha (20 ng ml-1) increased IL-8 additively. 7. In conclusion, beta-adrenoceptor stimulation increased the release of the neutrophil chemoattractant, IL-8 in 16HBE cells, via an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP. beta-adrenoceptor stimulation adds to the IL-8 increase caused by the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. If this mechanism exists in vivo, beta-adrenoceptor activation may increase neutrophil chemotaxis into the airways.", 
    "68": "Growth hormone (GH) has a lipolytic effect in adipose tissue but this effect may differ in adipose tissue from various fat depots. This latter possibility was investigated in the present study, in which the effects of GH in vivo on catecholamine-induced lipolysis and the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in isolated adipocytes from different fat depots of hypophysectomized rats were investigated. Female and male Sprague-Dawley rats were hypophysectomized or sham-operated at 45 days of age. One week after the operation, hormonal replacement therapy with L-thyroxine and hydrocortisone acetate was given. In addition, groups of rats were treated with GH (1.33 mg/kg per day, given as two daily subcutaneous injections). After 1 week of hormonal treatment, adipocytes were isolated from the parametrial, epididymal and inguinal fat pads, and glycerol release after catecholamine-stimulation and 125I-cyanopindolol binding were measured. Hypophysectomy resulted in a marked decrease in the lipolytic response to catecholamines. GH treatment significantly increased catecholamine-induced lipolysis with similar effects in adipocytes from parametrial or epididymal and inguinal fat depots in both female and male rats. There were no differences between norepinephrine compared with isoproterenol-induced responses. 125I-cyanopindolol binding was reduced after hypophysectomy and normalized by GH treatment, without differences between parametrial and inguinal adipose tissue regions. We conclude that the lipolytic effects of GH in the rat may partly be mediated by a stimulatory effect on beta-adrenergic receptors in adipocytes. In addition, GH exerted similar effect on catecholamine induced lipolysis and beta-adrenergic receptors in adipocytes from parametrial, epididymal and inguinal fat depots.", 
    "69": "Although heart failure secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction remains a serious disease with high morbidity and mortality, pharmacologic intervention has been shown to be associated with improved survival and a decreased number of hospitalizations. Primary-care providers must be aware of the potential benefits of recent therapeutic advances and current treatment recommendations for patients with heart failure to receive optimal care. Important aspects of nonpharmacologic care are dietary restrictions, exercise training, and through patient education and counseling. Pharmacologic therapy includes diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and other vasodilating agents, and digoxin. ACE inhibitors are currently recommended for all patients with left ventricular dysfunction in whom use of these agents is not contraindicated. The mortality and morbidity from heart failure even with ACE inhibitors remain high, however. Promising clinical findings with such investigational agents as vesnarinone and pimobendan and the new-generation beta-blocker carvedilol suggest future new treatments to further improve the prognosis of these patients.", 
    "70": "Tilt table testing is widely used in the management of patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. However, the exact pathophysiologic mechanism of this disorder is still under debate. Likewise, therapy of these patients continues to represent a challenge in many cases. Therefore, the present study aimed to gain further insight into the pathophysiology of this syndrome and to examine easily accessible clinical parameters that can improve therapy selection.", 
    "71": "In 16 patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, changes in endogenous catecholamine concentrations were determined during repeated tilt table testing before and during treatment with metoprolol. Tachycardia preceded syncope in 8 of 10 responders compared to only 1 of 6 nonresponders (P < 0.05). In responders, the relative increase in epinephrine levels averaged 197% +/- 51% during drug-free tilting and 75% +/- 33% during repeated testing while on beta-blocker therapy (P < 0.05). In nonresponders, there was a smaller relative increase in epinephrine averaging 137% +/- 35% at baseline tilt. During repeated tilt testing, a similar increase was observed in these patients with recurrent syncope (156% +/- 104%; P = NS compared to baseline).", 
    "72": "In patients with neurocardiogenic syncope who show both an increase in epinephrine concentration during tilt test and sinus tachycardia prior to the onset of symptoms, beta-blocker treatment is very effective. These findings confirm the major role of sympathetic activation as a trigger of syncope. Particularly, heart rate changes at the onset of syncope may allow early identification of patients responding to antiadrenergic therapy.", 
    "73": "The study was carried out to assess the effect of nitric oxide (NO) generation or inhibition of NO synthase on the cardiac response to beta- and alpha 1-adrenergic agonists. In addition, we determined the effects of the cell-permable analogue of cGMP, 8-bromo-cGMP (8Br-cGMP).", 
    "74": "Experiments were done in electrically-paced isolated perfused rat hearts as well as in ventricular myocytes. Hearts were exposed to either the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol (0.1 microM), or the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine (2 microM in the presence of equimolar concentrations of propranolol), either with each drug alone or in the presence of the NO donors S-nitrosoacetylpenicillamine (SNAP, 10 microM) and 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1, 10 microM), the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (10 microM) or 8Br-cGMP (50 microM). These concentrations of SNAP and 8Br-cGMP increase tissue cGMP levels approximately 3-fold after 15 min treatment. Myocardial contractility was assessed by determining left ventricular pressure with a fluid-filled balloon inserted into the left ventricle. Similar experiments were performed in myocytes in which cell shortening and intracellular calcium transients were determined although concentrations of isoproterenol and phenylephrine in myocytes were higher (1 and 5 microM, respectively) than those used in isolated hearts in order to achieve optimum responses.", 
    "75": "In isolated hearts isoproterenol increased developed pressure by about 50%, which was totally prevented by SNAP and SIN-1 and unaffected by L-NAME. 8Br-cGMP, however, did not significantly diminish the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol. Phenylephrine increased developed pressure of isolated hearts by about 30%, but this was totally unaffected by either SNAP, SIN-1 or 8Br-cGMP. In myocytes, isoproterenol significantly increased the calcium transient by more than 50% and cell shortening by about 70%. Both effects were significantly attenuated by SNAP, SIN-1 and 8Br-cGMP but unaffected by L-NAME. Phenylephrine significantly increased cell shortening and the calcium transient, but these responses were unaffected either by SNAP or 8Br-cGMP.", 
    "76": "The present study demonstrate that NO as well as guanylate cyclase inhibitors and, to a lesser extent, 8Br-cGMP attenuate beta-receptor-mediated cardiac responses and supports the concept that NO serves as an endogenous regulator of beta-mediated effects of catecholamines in the heart. In addition, our findings suggest that the antiadrenergic effects of NO are restricted to these receptors but likely do not involve alpha 1-mediated effects.",

Spectral analysis comprised two frequency domain components: high-frequency power (HF), reflecting parasympathetic activity and low-frequency power (LF), in particular the LF: HF ratio, reflecting sympathetic function. Pre-synaptic sympatho-adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 8.00 am plasma noradrenaline.",

    "83": "Metabolic degradation of a soluble highly branched (-->3)-beta-D-glucan, SSG, was examined in mice using a macrophage blocker, gadolinium chloride (GdCl3). Intraperitoneally administered SSG distributed in the liver was slowly degraded, and after 5 weeks about 30% of the SSG became anionic. In addition, it is suggested that the metabolites would contain fewer branching points as assessed by the reactivity to limulus factor G. On the other hand, in the spleen, the molecular weight and the degree of branching of SSG were not changed for at least 5 weeks. Blockade of Kupffer cells by GdCl3 did not significantly change the distribution ratio of SSG in the liver. However, the treatment significantly delayed the degradation of SSG. These results suggested that Kupffer cells play important roles, not in the distribution, but in the oxidative degradation of SSG in the liver. In addition, splenic macrophages did not significantly contribute to the metabolic degradation of SSG.",

    "89": "Sinus arrest or atrioventricular block are rare but serious adverse effects of diltiazem. The risk of developing such adverse reactions may be somewhat exacerbated by concomitant beta-adrenergic blocker therapy. In patients with hypertension or coronary heart disease, combination therapy with diltiazem and a beta-blocker usually enhances therapeutic benefit relative to monotherapy, but adverse effects attributable to this combination, especially in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or latent cardiac conduction deficits, may be limiting. Therefore, such combination therapy may not be suitable in patients with atrioventricular block grade I, bradycardia or hypotension, and patients on the combined therapy should always have their blood pressure, heart rate and atrioventricular conduction on ECG monitored. If combination therapy with diltiazem and propranolol or metoprolol is commenced, or in the case of impaired renal function, an adjustment of the beta-blocker dosage may be required. Clinical studies on the combined use of diltiazem and beta-adrenergic blockers mostly concern the treatment of angina pectoris in patients with coronary heart disease. Although very few cases of severe bradycardia and conduction abnormalities have been reported in patients with uncomplicated hypertension on diltiazem and beta-blockade combination, there seems to be a potential for the occurrence of significant conduction disturbances with the combined treatment, and precautions should apply also for hypertensive populations.", 
    "90": "Quality of life is an important attribute of antihypertensive therapy. Previous studies have not addressed the importance of a patient's prior pharmacotherapy on quality of life, which may serve as the basis of reference for a new therapy. Nor have previous studies compared commonly used quality of life instruments for consistency, or investigated whether improvement or worsening of quality of life correlates with adverse events or blood pressure reduction. Two hundred eighteen hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure (95 to 114 mm Hg) after a 4- to 5-week placebo washout period were enrolled in a randomized double-blind, parallel group dose-escalation trial to compare the effects of amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg), bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg)/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 6.25, and enalapril (5 to 20 mg) on blood pressure, adverse events, and quality of life. Three quality of life instruments (General Well-Being Index, Vital Signs Quality of Life, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) were administered during original therapy, after placebo washout, and after 12 weeks of optimally titrated clinical trial pharmacotherapy. Our results demonstrated that removal from prior therapy had no detectable influence on subsequent evaluation of quality of life. The three quality of life instruments were consistent with the changes observed with the three therapies: a trend toward better quality of life with amlodipine and bisoprolol/HCTZ. Adverse events, but not systolic or diastolic blood pressure reduction correlated directly with changes in quality of life.", 
    "91": "Antihypertensive treatment is known to slow down the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with time. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to be more effective in this regard than conventional antihypertensive therapy. In a recent prospective, randomized, double blind trial in 257 patients with essential hypertension, the loss of GFR, determined with 51Cr-EDTA clearance, was significantly less with an ACE inhibitor (cilazapril) than with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker (atenolol) during the first year of treatment. However, after 2 years, the two therapies were equally effective in this regard, thereby creating doubts about the long-term superiority of ACE inhibition in this regard. In order to elucidate whether the superior renal preservation with the ACE inhibitor was a transient effect, GFR was measured after 1 more year of treatment, i.e., after 36 months. At that time, the decline in GFR was significantly smaller in the ACE inhibitor group as compared to the beta-adrenoceptor blocker group (-3.0 [-5.5, -1.0; 95% CI] v -7.0 [-9.0, -4.5; 95% CI] mL/min x 1.73 m2; P = .026). This demonstrates that in the treatment of essential hypertension ACE inhibition preserves GFR significantly better than beta-adrenoceptor blockade during long-term therapy.", 
    "92": "The effects on blood pressure (BP), renal function, and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) of 14 years of antihypertensive treatment were studied and compared to the changes seen with normal aging. The studied groups included randomly selected men with newly diagnosed primary hypertension at baseline (n = 23) and normotensive (NT) men of the same age (n = 11). The hypertensives (HT) were treated with beta-blockers either as monotherapy or combined with diuretics or hydralazine. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR; inulin clearance), renal blood flow (RBF, para-aminohippurate clearance), renal vascular resistance (RVR), and 24-h UAE were determined. The two groups were investigated at baseline (before treatment) and after 7 and 14 years. At baseline, BP and RVR were significantly increased and RBF was significantly decreased in the HT over that in the NT. The BP in the HT was significantly reduced after 7 years of treatment and a further but nonsignificant reduction to 139 +/- 14/88 +/- 6 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) was seen after 14 years. GFR in the HT was significantly reduced from 103 +/- 15 mL/min to 84 +/- 19 mL/min (mean +/- SD) after 7 years, but no further reduction was seen after 14 years. During the 14 years RBF decreased and RVR increased in the HT but these changes were of the same magnitude as in the NT. The UAE did not change significantly during the study. In conclusion, good blood pressure control with conventional antihypertensive treatment in mild to moderate primary hypertension seems to protect the kidney from progressive decline in GFR and increase in UAE. The increase in RVR and the decrease in RBF seen during 14 years of antihypertensive treatment was of the same magnitude as that seen with normal aging.",

After 12 months of dapiprazole treatment, the difference from the pretreatment mean intraocular pressure (IOP) value was statistically significant (P = .005). After 12 and 36 months of treatment, an hour-to-hour comparison of diurnal IOP curve values showed a statistically significant difference in all cases (P < .001). Although further investigations may be necessary to reach a definite conclusion, dapiprazole appeared to have a beneficial, stable in time effect in these patients.", 
    "94": "To investigate the role of dopamine (DA) in the secretion of progesterone and ovarian oxytocin (OT) in cattle in vivo and in vitro studies were performed. Luteal slices (middle stage of the luteal phase) were incubated-with five different amounts of DA (10(-3)-10(-7) M) and after 1, 2 and 4 h medium was collected for the progesterone and OT determination. The only 10(-5) M of DA enhanced OT medium concentrations (P < 0.05-0.001) and this response increased within duration of the incubation. The same dose of DA affected (P < 0.05-0.001) progesterone release during the incubation period. Next we wanted to study whether this mechanism will operate in conscious cattle. Mature heifers had cannulae inserted into the aorta abdominalis through the coccygeal artery for local infusion of saline or drugs, and into the jugular vein and the cava vena caudalis for the blood sample collection. In Experiment 2 six heifers on days 10-12 of the cycle received in Latin square design DA (8.4 micrograms/kg/min) for 2h, and they were pre-treated for 2 h with saline or for 1 h with droperidol (DROP; 1 microgram/kg/min) or with 4 micrograms/kg/min of beta-blocker, propranolol (PROP). DA increased (P < 0.05) OT plasma concentrations in all groups but secretion of progesterone was not changed (P > 0.05). DA decreased prolactin concentrations if pre-infused with saline and PROP and DROP diminished this effect of DA. Data suggest that DA affected OT release from both pituitary and from the ovary. Hence in Experiment 3 we wanted to elucidate whether DA caused those effects itself of after its conversion to the noradrenaline (NA). DA was given in six heifers as in Experiment 2 and blood samples were taken simultaneously from the vena cava and from the jugular vein. Within a few minutes from the start of DA infusion, large amount of DOPAC was measured by HPLC in blood. Next NA increase (P < 0.01) was observed in both veins but it was always higher (P < 0.05) in the vena cava. However, OT concentration in blood samples from both veins was not different (P > 0.05). Data indicate that DA can stimulate the secretory function of CL in cyclic heifers supposedly after its conversion to NA.", 
    "95": "The purpose of this study is to characterize the in situ absorption properties of ocular membranes using a cylindrical cell. Drug disappearance in the cell was determined as in situ absorption after an application of drug solution into the cell on the comea, sclera (bulbar conjunctiva and sclera layer), or palpebral conjunctiva. Tilisolol was used as a model of an ophthalmic beta-blocker. Tilisolol disappeared from the conjunctival and scleral surfaces although hardly any disappearance of tilisolol from the corneal surface was observed. Depletion of drug from the precorneal space was much faster in situ than extrapolated from permeability measurements (in vitro) of the separate tissues. This may arise from an influence of blood flow. The in situ apparent permeability coefficient of tilisolol through the conjunctiva was almost constant at various concentrations of drug (5-100 mM), suggesting a passive diffusion of tilisolol that was affected by medium pH. A high concentration of tilisolol in the aqueous humor was observed in the corneal application although the scleral and conjunctival applications showed a slight concentration of tilisolol. The corneal route was a dominant route of access to the aqueous humor. Access to the vitreous body for tilisolol was 4 times more effective through the sclera than through the cornea. On the other hand, the corneal application showed an extremely low concentration of tilisolol in plasma compared to the scleral and conjunctival applications. Thus, the in situ method using a cylindrical cell is a useful method for investigation of the ocular absorption of ophthalmic drugs.", 
    "96": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene product, is exclusively located on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. Recent studies using isolated rat canalicular liver plasma membrane (cLPM) vesicles indicate that daunomycin (DNM) is a substrate for the ATP-dependent P-gp efflux system in the rat liver. The isoforms of P-gp present in cLPM and in cancer cell lines differ in that the major form present in the liver represents the gene product of mdr2 in mice (MDR3 in humans; class III) while the isoform of P-gp in cancer cells is the gene product of mdr1 in mice (MDR1 in humans, class I). The objective of this study was to examine the inhibitory effects of various organic compounds, most of which have been studied previously in MDR cancer cells, on P-gp-mediated [3H]DNM uptake into cLPM. Also, the stereospecificity of P-gp for its substrates was investigated by comparing the inhibitory effects of the enantiomers and the racemic mixtures of verapamil and propranolol. DNM exhibited ATP-dependent active transport into rat liver cLPM with a Km of 26.8 +/- 13.4 microM and a Vmax of 4.9 +/- 0.8 nmol/45 s/mg of protein (n = 4). ADP, AMP, and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue did not increase DNM transport over the control value. Thirty-one potential inhibitors were examined; only acridine orange, doxorubicin, verapamil, propranolol, phosphatidylcholine, beta-estradiol glucuronide, and DNM itself showed statistically significant inhibition of [3H]DNM uptake into cLPM. These results suggest that only a limited number of substrates bind to or are transported across the hepatic canalicular membrane via P-gp. Phosphatidylcholine, a substrate for the gene product of the class III P-gp gene, produced significant inhibition of [3H]DNM transport (30.6% at a 10-fold-higher substrate concentration), suggesting that transport may be mediated, at least in part, by this P-gp gene product. There were no statistically significant differences in the inhibitory effects of the enantiomers and racemate of verapamil on [3H]DNM transport into cLPM, but the enantiomers of propranolol exhibited stereospecific inhibition of DNM transport. (R)-(+)-Propranolol produced a statistically significant inhibition of [3H]DNM transport similar to that observed with the racemic mixture, while (S)(-)-propranolol showed no inhibition. These findings suggest that bile canalicular P-gp may exhibit stereospecificity of binding or transport for its substrates.", 
    "97": "We compared the effect of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium antagonists on the circadian blood pressure (BP) profile in essential hypertension. We reviewed all studies published between 1980 and August 1993 reporting the circadian efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and using ambulatory BP monitoring. In all, 815 patients with essential hypertension were assessed in 51 studies of eight different beta-blockers, six ACE inhibitors, and eight calcium antagonists. As main outcome measures, relative (percentage) BP reductions during the day and at night were compared between the three classes of antihypertensive drugs. Results were also separated for different dosing schemes (once and more than once daily). With all three classes of antihypertensive agents, the percentage night BP reduction was approximately 1-3% less as compared with percentage reductions during the day. Only for systolic BP (SBP) of the calcium antagonists administered once daily was this difference significant [2.2%, confidence interval (CI) 0.3-4.0%, p < 0.05], due to a higher statistical power in this group of agents. Our results show that beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium antagonists are comparably effective during the day and at night, and no evidence indicates that either of the three agents is preferable to obtain the best possible antihypertensive effect at night.", 
    "98": "We examined the effect of carvedilol as compared with that of a combination of propranolol and doxazosin on lethal reperfusion injury in 21 feline hearts subjected to 40-min regional ischemia and 180-min reperfusion. A control group (n = 7) was compared with one group given carvedilol, a nonselective beta - and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker and antioxidant (n = 7) and another group given nonselective beta - and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol and doxazosin (n = 7) during initial reperfusion. Infarct size (IS: percent of area at risk, AAR) determined by staining the myocardium with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC), was reduced both in the carvedilol-treated group (median 1.8%, p < 0.05) and in the group given propranolol/doxazosin (median 6.5%, p < 0.05) as compared with controls (median 14.4%). Treatment with carvedilol reduced IS more than did treatment with propranolol/doxazosin (p < 0.05). Longitudinal segment shortening measured with sonomicrometry, improved in both treatment groups as compared with control (p < 0.05), but to a greater extent in the group treated with carvedilol. In circumferential segments, only carvedilol significantly improved segment shortening. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) after reperfusion was reduced in both treatment groups as compared with control. Oxidized glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) measured at the end of reperfusion did not differ between groups. Carvedilol protected against lethal reperfusion injury mainly through blockade of adrenoceptors.", 
    "99": "Recombinant cDNA expression systems for CYP2D6 have been shown to have significant catalytic activity with respect to the N-dealkylation of propranolol. However, the involvement of CYP2D6 in this reaction in human liver is inconclusive. We have re-evaluated the role of CYP2D6 in the dealkylation of S-(-)-propranolol using a bank of 10 human livers characterized for their specific CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 activities, the latter enzyme being known to be involved substantially in the formation of N-desisopropylpropranolol. Using quinidine (1 microM) or LKM-1 antibodies as selective inhibitors of CYP2D6, the contribution of this enzyme to net N-desisopropylation of S-(-)-propranolol (10 microM) by microsomes from the range of livers was found to vary from nil (poor metabolizer genotype) to 60%. N-desisopropylpropranolol formation inhibitable by quinidine was highly correlated with specific CYP2D6 activity, as measured by the alpha-hydroxylation of metoprolol (rs = 0.90; P < 0.001). The two livers with the highest proportion of CYP2D6-mediated N-dealkylation had relatively high ratios of specific CYP2D6 to CYP1A2 activity. These findings emphasize that data obtained using microsomes from single human livers or pooled microsomes from several livers may be misleading inasmuch as the relative contribution of different isoenzymes to the same metabolic reaction may show considerable between-subject variation.", 
    "100": "1. Racial differences in propranolol enantiomer kinetics following oral dosing were previously documented in our laboratory. The purpose of this study was to more completely describe propranolol kinetics in black and white subjects with the goal of gaining a better understanding of the mechanism(s) responsible for racial differences in oral propranolol kinetics. 2. Twelve white and 13 black healthy males were included in the study. Poor metabolizers of dextromethorphan and mephenytoin were excluded. Subjects took oral propranolol 80 mg every 8 h for 16 doses and received an intravenous dose of radiolabelled propranolol with the 16th dose. Serum and urine samples were collected for 24 h after the 16th dose. Serum concentrations of R- and S-propranolol and urine concentrations of its three primary metabolites were determined by h.p.l.c. 3. Apparent oral clearances of R- and S-propranolol were higher (P < 0.05) in blacks than whites (R-propranolol: 5036 +/- 4175 ml min-1 vs 2854 +/- 879 ml min-1; S-propranolol 3255 +/- 1723 ml min-1 vs 2125 +/- 510 ml min-1; blacks vs whites). 4. R- and S-propranolol clearances were higher in blacks than whites (R-propranolol 1069 +/- 316 ml min-1 vs 841 +/- 161 ml min-1; S-propranolol 947 +/- 271 ml min-1 vs 771 +/- 142 ml min-1; blacks vs whites, P < 0.05). 5. There were trends (P > 0.05 < 0.10) toward higher side chain oxidation, 4-hydroxylation and R-propranolol glucuronidation in blacks compared with whites. Ethnic differences in the enantiomeric ratios of partial metabolic clearance values were not observed. 6. We conclude the higher propranolol oral clearances in black subjects are explained by blacks having slightly higher hepatic metabolism via all three of its major metabolic pathways. Higher propranolol clearances among black subjects were also observed and we conclude this finding is explained largely by the higher hepatic metabolism, but also by slightly higher liver blood flow among black subjects.",

When the cause of syncope has been diagnosed, the appropriate therapy to prevent future attacks will be defined in many instances. One form of syncope, known as neurocardiogenic syncope, can be difficult to treat. Recent trials have suggests the use of beta-blockers, fludrocortisone, disopyramide, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be helpful in some patients.", 
    "105": "The aim of the present study was to analyse quantitatively, on a cat gastrocnemius muscle preparation in vivo, the effects of local angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by enalaprilat on total regional vascular resistance (tone) and its distribution to the large-bore arterial resistance vessels (> 25 microns), the small arterioles (< 25 microns) and the veins. Associated effects on capillary pressure and fluid exchange were also studied. Close-arterial infusion of enalaprilat (0.05-0.20 mg kg muscle tissue min-1) elicited a moderate dilator response in all three consecutive sections of the muscle vascular bed, an increase in capillary pressure and transcapillary fluid filtration. This dilation could be abolished by the selective bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (2 mg kg-1 min-1, i.a.), indicating that the dilator mechanism of ACE inhibition was an increased local concentration of bradykinin, and hardly at all a decreased concentration of angiotensin (AT) II. The generalized dilator response to ACE inhibition along the vascular bed suggested a relatively uniform distribution of ACE from artery to vein and this was further supported by the finding that a close-arterial infusion of AT I (0.04-0.32 microgram kg-1 min-1), which was vasoactive only after conversion to AT II by local ACE, elicited a generalized constrictor response in all three vascular sections. In contrast, infused AT II (0.01-0.16 microgram kg-1 min-1) constricted almost selectively the large-bore arterial vessels. The specific angiotensin AT1-receptor antagonist losartan (2 mg kg-1 min-1, i.a.) abolished the constrictor response to AT II but did not affect vascular tone under control conditions, indicating that AT II is not involved in the initiation of basal vascular tone in muscle. These results, taken together, indicate that under basal conditions vascular ACE contributes to the local control of vascular tone in skeletal muscle by degrading the endogenous dilator bradykinin, and not by converting AT I into vasoconstrictor AT II.",

Although effective in lowering intraocular pressure and helping to preserve sight, beta blockers also may have adverse influences on the cardiac, pulmonary, and central nervous systems, and on endocrine functions.

    "107": "At clinically relevant doses, selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) increase the extracellular concentration of 5-HT in the midbrain raph\u00e9 nuclei, thereby activating inhibitory somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Consequently, the firing activity of 5-HT neurons is reduced and the enhancement of extracellular 5-HT concentration in forebrain is dampened. Overriding this feedback by using antagonists of 5-HT1A autoreceptors permits SSRIs to produce a marked increase of extracellular 5-HT in the forebrain. Hence, combined treatment with an SSRI and a 5-HT1A antagonist increases the extracellular concentration of 5-HT more so than the former drug alone. The treatment of patients with major depression using an SSRI and pindolol, a 5-HT1A/ beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, markedly reduced the latency of the antidepressant response in previously untreated patients and induced a rapid improvement in treatment-resistant patients.", 
    "108": "The effects of ICV injections of adrenaline (30 nmol in 1 microL of saline) on blood glucose levels were investigated in conscious adult pigeons. This procedure increased blood glucose levels at 15-45 min after treatment. Previous ICV injection of propranolol (50 nmol) suppressed the increase observed at 15 min. The higher propranolol dose (100 nmol) was more effective than the lower dose (50 nmol) at blocking adrenaline-induced hyperglycemia. On the other hand, the ICV pretreatment with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, slightly potentiated the hyperglycemia caused by ICV injection of adrenaline. The IP administration of propranolol (100 nmol) or phentolamine (100 nmol) before adrenaline ICV failed to induce change in the hyperglycemic response induced by this catecholamine. Both IP and ICV injections of these adrenergic blockers, before ICV injections of saline, evoked no changes in baseline glycemic levels. Therefore, elevation of blood glucose concentration by ICV adrenaline and blockade of the response by propranolol suggest the involvement of a central beta-adrenergic mechanism in the neural control of glycemia in pigeons.", 
    "109": "The effects of IAA-94, a chloride channel blocker and/or low chloride perfusate on afferent arteriolar (AA) constriction by angiotensin II (Ang II), norepinephrine (NE) and increasing pressure (80 to 160 mm Hg) were assessed using isolated perfused hydronephrotic kidneys. In the first series of experiments, Ang II (0.3 nM) constricted AAs by 33 +/- 3% (N = 5, P < 0.01). Subsequent addition of diltiazem (10 microM) restored the decrements in the AA diameters. In the presence of diltiazem (10 microM), increasing pressure did not constrict AAs. In the second series of experiments. elevation of pressure constricted AAs by 20 +/- 2% (N = 7. P < 0.01). Subsequent addition of IAA-94 (30 microM) failed to alter the basal AA diameter and myogenic responsiveness. However, Ang II-induced AA constriction was abolished by IAA-94. In the third series of experiments, decreasing extracellular chloride exaggerated AA constriction by 0.1 nM of Ang II (from 13 +/- 2 to 20 +/- 3%, N = 6, P < 0.05). Similarly, low chloride perfusate enhanced NE (0.1 microM)-induced AA constriction (from 14 +/- 2 to 19 +/- 2%, N = 6, P < 0.05). In contrast, myogenic responsiveness was not influenced by reducing chloride concentrations. The present data provide evidence that both Ang II and NE induce AA constriction by opening chloride channels and subsequent activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and suggest that the myogenic response is mediated by activating voltage-dependent calcium channels independently of chloride channels.",

Little information is available regarding the prescribing patterns of antihypertensives in the primary care setting in Israel. The use of antihypertensives in 200 patients of the Maccabi Health Fund was, therefore, examined from April to June 1994. Sixty-four per cent of patients received monotherapy and 36% combination therapy. The most commonly prescribed medication for monotherapy were angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (33.6%), followed by beta-blockers (28.1%) and calcium channel antagonists (26.6%). Diuretics were prescribed to 7.0% of the patients. Analysis of overall drug utilization showed that diuretics were used in 21.5% of patients, beta-blockers in 39.5%, calcium channel blockers in 46% and ACE inhibitors in 40% of patients. Despite the growing evidence of the benefits of diuretics and beta-blockers, our results show a low utilization of these agents in comparison to other countries. It may be speculated that the lack of national guidelines, the absence of utilization reviews by third party providers as well as differences in patient population and climate conditions may all contribute to the current prescribing habits of physicians in the Israeli community.",

The beta-adrenoceptor blocking and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-releasing properties of capsinolol (N-[4-(2-hydroxy-3 (isopropylamino) propoxy)-3-methoxybenzyl]-nonanamide), derived from nonivamide, were investigated under in vivo and in vitro conditions. 2. Capsinolol (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mg kg-1, i.v.), as well as (+/-)-propranolol, produced a dose-dependent bradycardia response and a temporary pressor action in urethane-anaesthetized normotensive Wistar rats. These cardiovascular effects were different from the vagus reflex and parasympathetic efferent effects shown by capsaicin (0.1 mg kg-1, i.v.) in the rat. 3. Capsinolol (1.0 mg kg-1) inhibited the tachycardia effects induced by (-)-isoprenaline, but had no blocking effect on the arterial pressor responses induced by (-)-phenylephrine. The findings suggest that capsinolol possesses beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity, but it has no alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity. 4. In guinea-pig isolated tissues, capsinolol (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) antagonized (-)-isoprenaline-induced positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of the atria and tracheal relaxation responses in a concentration-dependent manner. The parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curve of (-)-isoprenaline suggests capsinolol is a beta-adrenoceptor competitive antagonist. 5. Capsinolol (10(-5) to 10(-4) M) exhibited a positive cardiotonic effect that was not inhibited by (+/-)-propranolol and reserpine, but was inhibited by capsazepine (10(-6) M) and CGRP8-37 (10(-6) M). This effect was independent of intrinsic sympathomimetic effects. 6. An immunoassay of released CGRP from guinea-pig isolated perfused heart indicated that capsinolol increases the release of CGRP and thus produces positive cardiotonic effects. 7. In conclusion, capsinolol is a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with capsaicin-like cardiotonic properties unrelated to traditional intrinsic sympathomimetic effects. It is suggested that capsinolol causes CGRP release from cardiac sensory neurones via a non-adrenergic mechanism and then activates CGRP receptors on cardiac muscle.", 
    "124": "The present studies investigated the role of beta adrenergic receptors in mediating arousal from anesthesia and the effects of stress on this process. In support of previous findings by others, it was found that blockade of beta-1 and beta-2 receptors by propranolol delayed arousal from halothane anesthesia and that this effect was attributable to blockade of beta-1 receptors because it was duplicated by betaxolol but not by ICI 118,551. Restraint stress also produced a delay in arousal from both halothane and hexobarbital anesthesia. This effect, which was observed at 0.5 but not 24 h after the stress, could not be explained by a stress-induced alteration in the metabolism of the anesthetic, as no difference in brain concentration of hexobarbital was found between stressed and control mice. The parallel effects of beta-1 blockade and stress further supports the hypothesis that stress produces an impairment in function at either the beta-1 receptor or some process coupled to this receptor.", 
    "125": "The present experiments were performed to examine the effects of a new muscarinic M1-receptor agonist, (-)-YM796 ((-)-S-2,8-dimethyl-3-methylene-1-oxa-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane L-tartrate monohydrate), on yawning and oxytocin secretion from the posterior pituitary gland in rats YM796, at doses of 2.5-50 mg/kg (SC), elicited yawning. The yawning response was markedly increased by pretreatment with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, pindolol (20 mg/kg, IP), which per se did not elicit yawning. The yawning induced by YM796 (10 mg/kg, SC) in combination with pindolol (20 mg/kg, IP) was inhibited by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, SC), a muscarinic receptor antagonist, and pirenzcpine (300 micrograms/ rat, ICV) and EEDQ (N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline) (5 mg/kg, IP), muscarinic M1-receptor antagonists, but not by spiperone (0.5 mg/kg, SC), a dopamine D2-receptor antagonist, 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide) (100 micrograms/rat, ICV), a muscarinic M3-receptor antagonist, and [d(CH2)5, Tyr(Mc)2, Orn8]-vasotocin (100 ng/rat, ICV), an oxytocin receptor antagonist. YM796 at 2.5-50 mg/kg (SC) did not exert an action on prolactin levels but increased oxytocin secretion from the posterior pituitary gland in rats. This augmentation of oxytocin secretion by YM796 was inhibited by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, SC) and pirenzepine (3 mg/kg, SC), but not by mecamylamine (1 mg/kg, IP), a nicotinic receptor antagonist. The present findings obtained with YM796 suggest that the muscarinic M2-receptor stimulation participates in causing yawning behavior and oxytocin secretion in rats.", 
    "126": "Electrophysiological studies indicate that certain 5-HT1A receptor antagonists increase the basal firing rate of some but not all raphe neurons by antagonizing the inhibitory endogenous serotonin tone operating on the somatodendritic pulse-modulating presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. This effect should enhance the synaptic concentration of 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine) in serotonergic terminal fields, which may then activate postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. However, in vivo microdialysis studies show that generally such 5-HT1A antagonists by themselves do not increase the basal 5-HT release but potentiate the ability of serotonin reuptake blockers to increase the neuronal serotonin terminal output in the rat brain via the above mechanism. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether antagonism of the proposed endogenous serotonin tone on the 5-HT1A autoreceptors can potentiate the activity of other postsynaptic serotonin receptors. To this end, we utilized the head-twitch response (HTR) in mice as an in vivo model of postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor function. The selective and silent 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, S-(-)UH 301, by itself, in a dose-dependent manner, produced the HTR in normal but not in reserpinized animals. The 5-HT2A antagonist, SR 46349B, completely prevented S-(-)UH 301-induced HTR. Pretreatment with S-(-)UH 301 also potentiated 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced HTR both in normal and in the reserpinized mice. At low doses (0.06-0.25 mg/kg), the 5-HT2A selective agonist, 8-OH DPAT, significantly but partially inhibited 5-HTP-induced HTR. However, further attenuation was not observed following the administration of larger doses of 8-OH DPAT. Depending upon the dose used, S-(-)UH 301 pretreatment not only antagonized but also broke through the inhibitory effect of 8-OH DPAT on 5-HTP-induced HTR. The selective (sertraline) and nonselective (cocaine) serotonin reuptake blockers potentiated the ability of 5-HTP to induce the head-twitch behavior in mice. Pretreatment with S-(-)UH 301 enhanced the potentiating effect of serotonin reuptake blockers on the 5-HTP induced HTR. These results suggest that an endogenous 5-HT tone via the discussed mechanism controls the terminal field synapticactivity of serotonergic neurons in mice. In addition, disinhibition of pulse-modulating 5-HT1A autoreceptors by S-(-)UH 301 can potentiate the synaptic effects of serotonin reuptake blockers as well as the serotonin precursor 5-HTP. However, a more firm general conclusion regarding antagonism of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors leading to indirect functional enhancement of other postsynaptic serotonergic receptors can only be made when the above hypothesis is further tested with other selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonists (such as WAY 100 635), which we were unable to obtain. The present study is the first report to show that a selective 5-HT1A antagonist by itself can produce a serotonin-mediated function via indirect stimulation of another serotonin receptor subtype in mice.", 
    "127": "Animal studies have documented the presence of marked, species-dependent, developmental changes in the properties of the L-type calcium current in cardiac myocytes. In an effort to understand the postnatal changes which occur in the calcium current in human heart, we characterized the calcium current in atrial myocytes isolated from 17 pediatric and older children (ages 3 d to 14 y) and 12 adult (ages 43-79 y) human hearts using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. In contrast to animal models, we found no evidence for age-related changes in calcium current density, steady-state inactivation, or kinetics of recovery from inactivation, suggesting that, in human atrium, calcium channels are in many aspects functionally mature at the time of birth. However, statistically significant differences were found in the kinetics of calcium current inactivation, with calcium current measured in cells isolated from pediatric human atria inactivating approximately 2-fold faster than cells isolated from adult hearts. These results suggest a possible role for age-related changes in calcium current inactivation in the shortened action potential duration observed in pediatric compared with adult human atrium.", 
    "128": "Many cardiovascular drugs have been implicated as causes of depression. With the exception of beta-blockers, few have been studied in formal epidemiologic designs. I present a new approach to such analyses that effectively controls for confounders that are stable over time. I analyzed the exposure histories of 11,244 incident antidepressant users, using the Odense University PharmacoEpidemiologic Database. All persons starting both beta-blockers and antidepressants during a predefined period were identified. If beta-blockers do not cause depression, this particular population should show equal numbers of persons starting either drug first. A depression-provoking effect of beta-blockers would generate an excess of persons starting beta-blockers first, that is a nonsymmetrical distribution of prescription orders. Confounders causing the two drugs to be co-prescribed would rarely be expected to affect the symmetry. The initial screening showed nonsymmetrical prescription orders for a wide range of cardiovascular drugs. After adjustment for an increasing incidence of antidepressant prescribing, I found a depression-provoking effect only for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (rate ratio = 1.29; 95% confidence interval = 1.08-1.56) and calcium channel blockers (rate ratio = 1.31; 95% confidence interval = 1.14-1.51).

In competition studies, ICI-89406 (beta 1-antagonist) and ICI-118551 (beta 2-antagonist) bound with high affinity, fitting a two-site model. Isoproterenol increased intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation (half-maximal effective concentration = 200 nM). Propranolol completely inhibited isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 270 nM]. ICI-89406 and ICI-118551 inhibited cAMP accumulation by 50% (IC50 = 1.5 microM and 1.7 microM, respectively). The combined addition of ICI-89406 and ICI-118551 resulted in a curve indistinguishable from that of propranolol. The beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNAs have been demonstrated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In initial and terminal IMCD cells, propranolol (3 microM) inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 80%, whereas ICI-89406 (3 microM) and ICI-118551 (3 microM) resulted in only partial inhibition (50%).

    "130": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats fed a condensed milk diet were classified as either \"obesity susceptible\" (OS) or \"obesity resistant\" (OR) based on body weight increases attained after 12 wk. Overall caloric intake in OS rats was higher than in chow-fed controls, and OS rats were heavier than chow-fed controls or OR rats. There were no significant differences in blood glucose, serum insulin, ventricular weight, basal blood pressure, or heart rate. Pressor responses recorded after combined blockade with atropine and propranolol to eliminate reflex effects were identical for vasopressin, but those to norepinephrine were larger in OS than in OR rats, whereas those to angiotensin were larger in OS than in control rats. When baroreflex sensitivity was assessed using intravenously infused sodium nitroprusside or phenylephrine to alter systemic arterial pressure, differences in reflex tachycardia were equivocal, but reflex bradycardia was clearly inhibited in OS rats. These results show that, although basal blood pressure was unaffected in OS rats, their impaired reflex bradycardia along with enhanced pressor responsiveness to norepinephrine could predispose them to subsequent development of hypertension.",

In view of our previous findings of norepinephrine-mediated increase in O2 consumption (Vo2) in the perfused hindlimb of this species, the present study examined the effect of alpha-adrenoceptors on the thermogenesis of conscious bettongs at rest by infusing adrenergic agents via an indwelling catheter in the tail vein. The resting Vo2 was 22.9 +/- 1.9 mmol.kg-1.h-1. Norepinephrine (10-80 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) stimulated Vo2 in a dose-dependent manner with the maximal increment of 46.7%. Naphazoline (an alpha 1,alpha 2-adrenergic agonist) and phenylephrine (an alpha 1-adrenergic agonist) also elicited increases in Vo2 with maximal values of 29.6 and 34.8%, respectively. In contrast, the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine had no significant effects. Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers were used to antagonize the submaximal increase in Vo2 elicited by norepinephrine. As a dose of 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine abolished the effects of naphazoline and phenylephrine and reduced norepinephrine-induced Vo2 by 45.5%. The beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol inhibited the norepinephrine-induced Vo2 by 58.8% at 20 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. A combination of the two antagonists blocked 82.5% of the norepinephrine-induced Vo2. Pretreatment of the animal with indomethacin (1 mg/kg), a known inhibitor of prostaglandin cyclooxygenase, had no effect on phenylephrine-elicited Vo2. Taken together, these results indicate that alpha 1-adrenoceptors are directly involved in norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis in non-BAT tissue(s).", 
    "132": "Coronary vasoconstriction is a component of the baroreflex response to bilateral carotid occlusion. The central pathways responsible for this reflex constriction are incompletely understood, but previous studies show that activation of parabrachial nucleus (PBN) elicits coronary vasoconstriction and that PBN shares prominent anatomic connections with other central baroreflex centers, including the nucleus of the tractus solitarius. Therefore, we examined whether PBN plays a role in baroreflex mediated coronary constriction and whether cell bodies rather than fibers passing through this region are involved. Anesthetized cats were instrumented for continuous measurements of heart rate, arterial pressure, and coronary flow velocity. Bilateral carotid occlusion following propranolol and vagotomy increased arterial pressure (63 +/- 10%) and an index of coronary vascular resistance (34 +/- 6%). Bilateral microinjections of lidocaine (1%, 400 nl) into PBN reversibly attenuated the coronary constriction (19 +/- 5%) with little effect on the change in arterial pressure. It was further demonstrated that autoregulatory responses to the increase in pressure could not fully account for the observed changes in coronary constriction. In a separate group of animals, kainic acid (50 mM, 300 nl) abolished the baroreflex increase in coronary resistance (43 +/- 1 vs. -9 +/- 9% after) without affecting the increase in arterial pressure (54 +/- 12% increase before vs. 55 +/- 20% increase after kainic acid). We conclude that PBN is a necessary component of the baroreflex pathway mediating coronary vasoconstriction. Furthermore, cell bodies in PBN, rather than simply fibers passing through that region, participate in the reflex coronary vasoconstriction.",

    "134": "A MEDLINE search using the words 'resistant hypertension', 'refractory hypertension' and 'treatment resistance, hypertension' was carried out to identify relevant articles. The bibliographies of articles were used to screen for other relevant articles. All available English-language articles on the epidemiology, prognosis and management of hypertension resistant to standard treatment were reviewed.", 
    "135": "Resistant hypertension is an important public health problem and a common reason for referral of patients to specialized hypertension clinics. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension are at increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and renal failure. Many factors may play a role in the development of resistant hypertension, including misdiagnosis (pseudoresistance), noncompliance, occult secondary causes for hypertension, volume overload, obesity, cigarette smoking, excess alcohol intake, sleep apnea, interfering medications and suboptimal combinations of antihypertensives. Only beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics have been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertension. The trials evaluating third-line agents in patients with resistant hypertension have demonstrated additional blood pressure lowering with all classes of agents, and the randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated any statistically significant differences between the agents in either efficacy or tolerability.", 
    "136": "Evaluation of the patient with resistant hypertension should include 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and an extensive search for hypertensive end organ damage. Contributing factors should be sought and stepped care should still form the basis for treatment decisions. The choice of third-line agent should be dictated by the patient's renin profile, current medication and any concomitant diseases.", 
    "137": "A sensitive and selective liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric assay for the determination of the dihydropyridine aryloxypropanolamine compound Z6568 and its monoacidic metabolites in plasma, urine and tissues has been developed and validated. Z6568 and the acidic metabolites were isolated from the biological matrices by solid-phase extraction, separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and detected by mass spectrometry using a thermospray interface. Filament ionization and negative-ion detection were used, monitoring the molecular ion of Z6568 and a major fragment of the acidic metabolites. The analysis of spike plasma, urine and tissues demonstrated good accuracy and precision of the assay with a detection limit of 0.5 ng ml-1 for Z6568 and 2 ng ml-1 for the metabolites. Data relative to the optimization of the extraction procedure, mass spectrometric conditions and the validation protocol are reported. The method was used to investigate the metabolic fate and tissue distribution in laboratory animals.", 
    "138": "The B subunit of verotoxin (VT1B) from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli is responsible for the attachment of the holotoxin to the cell surface, by binding to the glycolipid, globotriaosyl ceramide. After receptor-mediated endocytosis, the toxin is targeted to the Golgi complex by a process of retrograde transport. We took advantage of this unique property of VT1B to measure the pH of the Golgi complex in intact live cells. Purified recombinant VT1B was labeled with either rhodamine or fluorescein for subcellular localization by confocal microscopy. After 1 h at 37 degrees C, VT1B accumulated in a juxtanuclear structure that colocalized with several Golgi markers, including alpha-mannosidase II, beta-COP, and NBD-ceramide. Moreover, colchicine and brefeldin A induced dispersal of the juxtanuclear staining, consistent with accumulation of VT1B in the Golgi complex. Imaging of the emission of fluorescein-labeled VT1B was used to measure intra-Golgi pH (pHG), which was calibrated in situ with ionophores. In intact Vero cells, pHG averaged 6.45 +/- 0.03 (standard error). The acidity of the Golgi lumen dissipated rapidly upon addition of bafilomycin A1, a blocker of vacuolar-type ATPases, pHG remained constant despite acidification of the cytosol by reversal of the plasmalemmal Na+/H+ antiport. Similarly, pHG was unaffected by acute changes in cytosolic calcium. Furthermore, pHG recovered quickly toward the basal level after departures imposed with weak bases. These findings suggest that pHG is actively regulated, despite the presence of a sizable H+ \"leak\" pathway. The ability of VT1B to target the Golgi complex should facilitate not only studies of acid-base regulation, but also analysis of other ionic species.", 
    "139": "Ethanol (EtOH) suppresses natural killer (NK) cell activity in the spleen in a binge drinking model in mice. Direct effects of EtOH and its metabolites are not the major cause of this suppression. In this study, the role of catecholamines, glucocorticoids and opioids in EtOH-induced suppression of NK cell activity in mice was evaluated. In addition, the role of GABA-A receptors was examined. The catecholamine antagonists phentolamine, nadolol and propranolol (delivered by a timed-release pellet) respectively exacerbated, partially blocked and had no effect on EtOH-induced suppression of NK cell activity. Chemical sympathectomy significantly reduced the suppression of NK cell activity by EtOH. The glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 (mifepristone) did not affect EtOH-induced suppression of NK cell activity, and exogenous corticosterone only marginally suppressed NK cell activity. The opioid antagonist naltrexone (delivered by a timed-release pellet) did not block suppression of NK cell activity by EtOH. Thus glucocorticoids and opioids are not the major causes of EtOH-induced suppression of NK cell activity, and catecholamines seem only partially responsible for this effect. Involvement of GABA-A receptors was suggested by the ability of Ro15-4513 to decrease EtOH-induced NK suppression. Other agents were less effective, which suggested a possible role for the diazepam-insensitive GABA-A sites that are recognized by Ro15-4513. The failure of diazepam to suppress NK activity also suggests that increased chloride flux through diazepam-sensitive GABA-A receptors (which is caused by EtOH as well as diazepam) does not mediate NK suppression in this model.", 
    "140": "Although several hormones that promote hepatocyte proliferation also activate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and mobilize Ca2+, the role of PI-PLC in the growth-stimulating effect of these agents is not clear. We have investigated this issue further, by exposing freshly isolated adult rat hepatocytes to vasopressin, angiotensin II, norepinephrine (in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker timolol) or PGF2 alpha, and examined both acute responses and the subsequent DNA synthesis when the cells were grown in monolayer culture. All the agonists elevated the level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and enhanced the DNA synthesis, amplifying the response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), and this comitogenic effect could be exerted by a single exposure of the cells 24 h prior to the addition of EGF. The acute activation of PI-PLC, measured as the early rise (peak 15-60 s) in InsP3, was 8-10-fold with vasopressin or angiotensin II, 3-4-fold with norepinephrine, and approximately 2-fold with PGF2 alpha. For all the agonists, a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ in 100% of the cells and a maximal increase in glycogen phosphorylase activity were evoked at concentrations that approximately doubled the level of InsP3. However, the growth-stimulatory effects of these agonists showed a different order of efficacy as compared to the activation of PI-PLC; in terms of the maximal stimulation of DNA synthesis, the effects were: norepinephrine approximately PGF2 alpha > angiotensin II > vasopressin. Also, norepinephrine, PGF2 alpha, and angiotensin II, but not vasopressin, further enhanced the DNA synthesis when their concentrations were increased above those yielding maximal elevation of InsP3. In experiments where vasopressin and angiotensin II were combined, their effects on the DNA synthesis were additive while the InsP3 responses were not. The results show that the extent of the initial activation of PI-PLC is not the determinant for the magnitude of the growth effects of Ca(2+)-mobilizing hormones in hepatocytes. This suggests either (a) that the proliferative response to these agents is determined by the activity of PI-PLC at a later time, or its integral over an extended part of the prereplicative period, rather than by the acute activation, or (b) that additional, PI-PLC-independent, mechanisms are required."
