    "0": "Recently, a functional, negatively inotropic, beta(3)-adrenoceptor was characterized in the human heart. Several studies now suggest that this receptor might play an important role in the pathophysiology of heart failure, by counterbalancing the effects of a beta(1)- and beta(2)-stimulation. Therefore, this review summarizes the rationale and effects of beta-adrenergic blockade in chronic heart failure and specifically addresses the question of the potential use of beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of heart failure and other pathophysiological conditions associated with a decreased cardiac contractility.", 
    "1": "After acclimatization to high altitude, maximal exercise cardiac output (QT) is reduced. Possible contributing factors include 1) blood volume depletion, 2) increased blood viscosity, 3) myocardial hypoxia, 4) altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) function affecting maximal heart rate (HR), and 5) reduced flow demand from reduced muscle work capability. We tested the role of the ANS reduction of HR in this phenomenon in five normal subjects by separately blocking the sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the ANS during maximal exercise after 2-wk acclimatization at 3,800 m to alter maximal HR. We used intravenous doses of 8.0 mg of propranolol and 0.8 mg of glycopyrrolate, respectively. At altitude, peak HR was 170 +/- 6 beats/min, reduced from 186 +/- 3 beats/min (P = 0.012) at sea level. Propranolol further reduced peak HR to 139 +/- 2 beats/min (P = 0.001), whereas glycopyrrolate increased peak HR to sea level values, 184 +/- 3 beats/min, confirming adequate dosing with each drug. In contrast, peak O(2) consumption, work rate, and QT were similar at altitude under all drug treatments [peak QT = 16.2 +/- 1.2 (control), 15.5 +/- 1.3 (propranolol), and 16.2 +/- 1.1 l/min (glycopyrrolate)]. All QT results at altitude were lower than those at sea level (20.0 +/- 1.8 l/min in air). Therefore, this study suggests that, whereas the ANS may affect HR at altitude, peak QT is unaffected by ANS blockade. We conclude that the effect of altered ANS function on HR is not the cause of the reduced maximal QT at altitude.", 
    "2": "Exercise is now considered an important component of management in chronic heart failure (CHF), but little is known about central hemodynamic changes that occur during different exercise modalities in these patients. Seventeen patients (ejection fraction 25 +/- 2%) undertook brachial artery and right heart catheterization and oxygen consumption assessment at rest, during submaximal and peak cycling (Cyc), and during submaximal upper and lower limb resistance exercise. Cardiac output (CO) increased relative to baseline during peak Cyc (P < 0.05) but did not change during submaximal Cyc or upper or lower limb exercise. Heart rate (HR) was lowest during upper limb exercise and progressively increased during lower limb exercise, submaximal Cyc, and peak Cyc, with significant differences between each of these (P < 0.01). Conversely, stroke volume (SV) decreased during submaximal Cyc and lower limb exercise and was lower during peak and submaximal Cyc and lower limb exercise than during upper limb exercise (P < 0.05). CHF patients are dependent on increases in HR to increase CO during exercise when SV may decline. Resistance exercise, performed at appropriate intensity, induces a similar hemodynamic burden to aerobic exercise in patients with CHF.", 
    "3": "Heat acclimation upregulates 72-kDa heat shock protein (HSP72) and predisposes to faster activation of the heat shock response (HSR). This study investigates the role played by beta-adrenergic signaling and/or plasma thyroxine level in eliciting these features by using rats undergoing 1) heat acclimation (AC; 34 degrees C, 2 and 30 days); 2) AC with beta-adrenergic blockade; 3) AC-maintained euthyroid; 4) hypothyroid; 5) hyperthyroid; and 6) controls. The hsp72 mRNA (RT-PCR) and HSP72 levels (Western blot) were measured before and after heat stress (2 h, 41 degrees C, rectal temperature monitored). beta-Adrenergic blockade during AC abolished HSP72 accumulation, without disrupting HSR. Low thyroxine blunted the HSR at posttranscriptional level, whereas thyroxine administration in hyperthyroid and AC-maintained euthyroid rats arrested heat stress-evoked hsp72 transcription. We conclude that beta-adrenergic signaling contributes to the high HSP72 level characterizing the AC state. Thyroxine has two opposing effects: 1) direct repressive on rapid hsp72 transcription after heat stress; and 2) indirect stimulatory via beta-adrenergic signaling. Low thyroxine could account for diminished HSP72 synthesis via lower heat production and thermoregulatory set point.", 
    "4": "Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure. However, direct evidence of oxidative stress generation in the human failing myocardium has not been obtained. Furthermore, the effect of carvedilol, a vasodilating beta-blocker with antioxidant activity, on oxidative stress in human failing hearts has not been assessed. This study was therefore designed to determine whether levels of lipid peroxides are elevated in myocardia of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and whether carvedilol reduces the lipid peroxidation level. Methods and Results- Endomyocardial biopsy samples obtained from 23 patients with DCM and 13 control subjects with normal cardiac function were studied immunohistochemically for the expression of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)-modified protein, which is a major lipid peroxidation product. Expression of HNE-modified protein was found in all myocardial biopsy samples from patients with DCM. Expression was distinct in the cytosol of cardiac myocytes. Myocardial HNE-modified protein levels in patients with DCM were significantly increased compared with the levels in control subjects (P<0.0001). Endomyocardial biopsy samples from 11 patients with DCM were examined before and after treatment (mean, 9+/-4 months) with carvedilol (5 to 30 mg/d; mean dosage, 22+/-8 mg/d). After treatment with carvedilol, myocardial HNE-modified protein levels decreased by 40% (P<0.005) along with amelioration of heart failure.",

    "6": "Prolonged agonist exposure often induces downregulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although downregulation of the prototypical beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) has been extensively studied, the underlying mechanisms have yet to be resolved. As even less is known about the beta(1)-subtype, we investigated the downregulation of human beta(1)AR stably expressed in Chinese hamster fibroblasts in response to the agonist isoproterenol or the cell-permeable, chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP). While either effector mediated decreases in both beta(1)AR binding activity and steady-state beta(1)AR mRNA levels, there were significant differences in their actions. Whereas agonist-mediated downregulation of beta(1)AR followed first-order kinetics, that induced by CPT-cAMP was delayed for several hours and approximately 50% of the former. Furthermore, agonist but not CPT-cAMP induced beta(1)AR internalization, and inhibiting internalization also suppressed agonist-mediated downregulation. The latter, however, was more sensitive than the former to agonist concentration (EC(50) of 0.3 vs 48 nM). Thus, at < or =1 nM agonist, downregulation occurred without internalization and with a pattern similar to that mediated by CPT-cAMP. The amounts of beta(1)AR downregulated or internalized were proportional to initial receptor levels but reached saturation at approximately 2 and 3 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. The fate of beta(1)AR protein during downregulation was determined by immunoblotting with anti-C-terminal antibodies. In agonist-treated cells, beta(1)AR protein disappeared with time and without any immunoreactive degradation products. Agonist-mediated downregulation of the human beta(1)AR appears to be a complex process that consists of both agonist- and cAMP-specific components. The former involves both receptor internalization and degradation whereas the latter involves a reduction in receptor mRNA.", 
    "7": "This 3-month multicenter, open-label study of 89 geriatric patients with glaucoma evaluated the substitution of brimonidine twice daily for topical beta blockers that had been used for at least 6 months. The primary outcome measures were reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) from baseline at 2 hours postdose, change in cardiac and respiratory function, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. Patients were queried about adverse events at each visit and completed a quality-of-life questionnaire at the final evaluation. In this cohort with a mean age of 75.4 years, the average duration of topical beta-blocker therapy was 5 years. Brimonidine twice daily produced an additional mean reduction in IOP of 8.2% (1.4 mm Hg; P<.001). Eighty-eight percent of patients (60/68) reported being at least as satisfied with brimonidine as with their previous beta-blocker regimen, and 46% (31/68) reported greater satisfaction with brimonidine. Additionally, 40% of patients (27/68) noted increased energy after the switch, and 43% (29/68) described brimonidine as more soothing than topical beta blockers. In this elderly population, the replacement of topical beta blockers with brimonidine twice daily significantly decreased IOP, improved quality of life, and enhanced patient satisfaction.",

    "17": "Cross talk between adrenergic and insulin signaling systems may represent a fundamental molecular basis of insulin resistance. We have characterized a newly established beta(3)-adrenoceptor-deficient (beta(3)-KO) brown adipocyte cell line and have used it to selectively investigate the potential role of novel-state and typical beta-adrenoceptors (beta-AR) on insulin signaling and action. The novel-state beta(1)-AR agonist CGP-12177 strongly induced uncoupling protein-1 in beta(3)-KO brown adipocytes as opposed to the beta(3)-selective agonist CL-316,243. Furthermore, CGP-12177 potently reduced insulin-induced glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. Neither the selective beta(1)- and beta(2)-antagonists metoprolol and ICI-118,551 nor the nonselective antagonist propranolol blocked these effects. The classical beta(1)-AR agonist dobutamine and the beta(2)-AR agonist clenbuterol also considerably diminished insulin-induced glucose uptake. In contrast to CGP-12177 treatment, these negative effects were completely abrogated by metoprolol and ICI-118,551. Stimulation with CGP-12177 did not impair insulin receptor kinase activity but decreased insulin receptor substrate-1 binding to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and activation of protein kinase B. Thus the present study characterizes a novel cell system to selectively analyze molecular and functional interactions between novel and classical beta-adrenoceptor types with insulin action. Furthermore, it indicates insulin receptor-independent, but PI 3-kinase-dependent, potent negative effects of the novel beta(1)-adrenoceptor state on diverse biological end points of insulin action.", 
    "18": "Dyspnoea, defined as a sensation of an uncomfortable awareness of breathing, is one of the most frightening and distressing symptoms for patients with cancer. It is very common in cancer patients with and without direct lung involvement. The gold standard of diagnosis and assessment is the patient's self-report. Measurements of respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and arterial blood gases do not measure dyspnoea. Fast, safe, and effective relief of the symptom is possible whether or not identifiable reversible causes exist. Opioids are the first line of therapy for such relief. Medical management can be directed at the underlying cause when the potential benefits outweigh the burdens of such treatment. In rare cases for which symptomatic treatment does not control dyspnoea to the patient's satisfaction, sedation is an effective, ethical option.",

The present study extends the initial antiarrhythmic assessment of I(Ks) blockade by demonstrating prevention of ischemic malignant arrhythmias in dogs with recent (8.0 +/- 0.4 days) anterior myocardial infarction with the coadministration of a subeffective dose of L-768673 and a subeffective, minimally beta-adrenergic blocking dose of timolol. Administered individually, neither 0.3 microg/kg i.v. L-768673 nor 1.0 microg/kg i.v. timolol prevented the induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) by programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) or the development of malignant ventricular arrhythmia in response to acute coronary artery thrombosis. In contrast, coadministration of 0.3 microg/kg i.v. L-768673 + 1.0 microg/kg i.v. timolol suppressed the induction of VT by PVS (8/10, 80% rendered noninducible versus 1/10, 10% noninducible in vehicle group; p < 0.01) and prevented the development of acute ischemic lethal arrhythmias (3/10, 30% incidence versus 8/10, 80% incidence in vehicle group; p < 0.05). Concomitant administration of low-dose L-768673 + timolol produced modest increases in QTc and paced QT intervals (4.5 +/- 1.2 and 5.5 +/- 1.4%; both p < 0.01), increases in noninfarct zone relative and effective refractory periods (7.0 +/- 1.7 and 12.3 +/- 3.0%; both p < 0.01), and lesser increases in infarct zone relative and effective refractory periods (5.3 +/- 1.6 and 5.8 +/- 1.4%; both p < 0.01). These findings suggest that concomitant low-dose I(Ks) and beta-adrenergic blockade may constitute a potential pharmacologic strategy for prevention of malignant ischemic ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "28": "We examined the effects of short and prolonged exposure to carvedilol, an antihypertensive and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, on voltage-dependent Na(+) channels in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Carvedilol (1-100 microM) reduced (22)Na(+) influx induced by veratridine, an activator of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels. Carvedilol also suppressed veratridine-induced (45)Ca(2+) influx and catecholamine secretion in a concentration-dependent manner similar to that of (22)Na(+) influx. Prolonged exposure of the cells to 10 microM carvedilol increased [(3)H]saxitoxin ([(3)H]STX) binding, which reached a plateau at 12 h and was still observed at 48 to 72 h. Scatchard analysis of [(3)H]STX binding revealed that carvedilol increased the B(max) value (control, 14.9 +/- 0.9 fmol/10(6) cells; carvedilol, 23.8 +/- 1.2 fmol/10(6) cells) (n = 3, P < 0.05) without altering the K(d) value, suggesting a rise in the number of cell surface Na(+) channels. The increase in [(3)H]STX binding by carvedilol was prevented by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, whereas carvedilol changed neither alpha- nor beta(1)-subunit mRNA levels of Na(+) channels. The carvedilol-induced increase of [(3)H]STX binding was abolished by brefeldin A and H-89, inhibitors of intracellular vesicular trafficking of proteins from the trans-Golgi network and of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), respectively. The present findings suggest that short-term treatment with carvedilol reduces the activity of Na(+) channels, whereas prolonged exposure to carvedilol up-regulates cell surface Na(+) channels. This may add new pharmacological effects of carvedilol to our understanding in the treatment of heart failure and hypertension.", 
    "29": "beta-Adrenergic stimulation of cardiac muscle activates protein kinase A (PKA), which is known to phosphorylate proteins on the thin and thick filaments of the sarcomere. Cardiac muscle sarcomeres contain a third filament system composed of titin, and here we demonstrate that titin is also phosphorylated by the beta-adrenergic pathway. Titin phosphorylation was observed after beta-receptor stimulation of intact cardiac myocytes and incubation of skinned cardiac myocytes with PKA. Mechanical experiments with isolated myocytes revealed that PKA significantly reduces passive tension. In vitro phosphorylation of recombinant titin fragments and immunoelectron microscopy suggest that PKA targets a subdomain of the elastic segment of titin, referred to as the N2B spring element. The N2B spring element is expressed only in cardiac titins, in which it plays an important role in determining the level of passive tension. Because titin-based passive tension is a determinant of diastolic function, these results suggest that titin phosphorylation may modulate cardiac function in vivo.", 
    "30": "We recently reported that 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) (5-HT(2A)) receptor activation on cultured glial cells induces glutamate release [J. Neurosci. Res. 67 (2002) 399]. Here we use C6 glioma cells to examine the role of calcium in this response. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) increases glutamate release from C6 glioma cells, an effect blocked by low calcium conditions. The calcium ionophores ionomycin and calcimycin also released glutamate from C6 glioma cells in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The effect of 5-HT was reduced by the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (1-[6[[(17 beta)-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione), but not its inactive enantomer U73343(1-[6[[(17 beta)-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-2,5-pyrrolidinedione). The protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine and calphostin C had no effect on the response to 5-HT, whereas the response was blocked by thapsigargin and caffeine. Neither the L-type calcium channel blockers, nifedipine and verapamil, nor the N-type calcium channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA inhibited the effect of 5-HT, whereas NiCl(2) and KCl blocked the response to 5-HT. We conclude that the 5-HT-induced efflux of glutamate from C6 glioma cells is Ca(2+)-dependent and involves, at least in part, the mobilisation of Ca(2+) from inositol (1,4,5) tris phosphate (IP(3)) sensitive intracellular stores.", 
    "31": "Chronic ethanol consumption contributes to cardiovascular dysfunction possibly related to loss of Mg(2+). This study was designed to examine the role of dietary Mg(2+) supplementation on chronic ethanol ingestion-induced vascular alteration. Rats were fed an ethanol liquid diet supplemented with or without Mg(2+) for 12 weeks. The force-generating capacity was examined in thoracic aortic rings. Ethanol-consuming animals exhibited significantly elevated blood pressure. In aorta with intact endothelium, the contractile responses to norepinephrine and KCl were greatly attenuated and potentiated, respectively. Interestingly, the ethanol-induced alterations in blood pressure and vasoconstrictive response were restored by Mg(2+) supplementation. Pretreatment with the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol in intact aortic rings abolished the difference in response to norepinephrine between the control and ethanol groups, which implies the involvement of a weakened beta(1)-adrenoceptor component in vessels from the ethanol-fed rats. The norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in intact aorta rings was completely abolished by the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. In endothelium-denuded aorta, the contractile response to norepinephrine or KCl was not significantly different between the ethanol and Mg(2+) groups. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation to carbamylcholine chloride was not altered by either ethanol or Mg(2+) supplementation. Sodium nitroprusside-induced vasorelaxation was depressed by ethanol, and restored by Mg(2+), in aorta with or without endothelium. These data suggest that chronic ethanol consumption contributes to alterations of endothelium-dependent and -independent vascular response. These alterations can be compensated by dietary Mg(2+) supplementation.", 
    "32": "The two enantiomers of propranolol antagonize generalized tonic-clonic seizures in DBA/2 mice with the (-)-enantiomer being about 1.5 times more potent than the (+)-enantiomer. Metoprolol was less active and atenolol was unable to affect audiogenic seizures. In combination with conventional antiepileptic drugs, both propranolol enantiomers tested in doses not affecting the occurrence of audiogenic seizures increased the anticonvulsant activity of diazepam, phenobarbital, valproate and lamotrigine and tended to increase that of carbamazepine and phenytoin. The effect was more pronounced with the (-)-enantiomer. This increase was associated with an enhancement of motor impairment, however, the therapeutic index of combined treatment of the antiepileptic drugs with both propranolol enantiomers was more favourable than the combination with saline alone. Metoprolol was also able to decrease the ED(50) values of the antiepileptic drugs, whereas atenolol showed no effects. Since neither enantiomer of propranolol significantly influenced the total and free plasma levels of the antiepileptics, pharmacokinetic interactions are not likely. In addition, (+)- and (-)-propranolol did not significantly affect the hypothermic effects of the antiepileptics tested. In conclusion, both enantiomers of propranolol and metoprolol showed an additive anticonvulsant effect when co-administered with some conventional antiepileptic drugs, most notably diazepam, phenobarbital, lamotrigine and valproate, implicating a possible therapeutic relevance of such drug combinations.", 
    "33": "Since the enantioselective pharmacokinetic profiles of R,S-sotalol in cardiac patients are controversial, the present investigation aimed to study the kinetic disposition of sotalol enantiomers in patients with tachycardia.

They had tachycardia, normal renal function and had been chronically treated with tablets of sotalol 160 mg b.i.d. The patients were submitted to blood samples collection at zero, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after drug administration. The quantitation of sotalol enantiomers were performed by a stereoselective HPLC method with fluorescence detection previously published. A one open compartment model was applied and the main pharmacokinetic parameters obtained for R-/S-sotalol were, respectively (Mean +/- SD): CSSMAX = 1007 +/- 307/1040 +/- 340 ng/mL; TMAX = 1.82 +/- 0.6/1.83 +/- 0.6 h; AUCSST = 6959 +/- 2153/7388 +/- 2563 ng.h/mL; CISSr/F = 2.7 +/- 1.2/2.5 +/- 1.2 mL/min/kg and VdSS/F = 1.9 +/- 0.9/2.0 +/- 1.0 L/kg. The pharmacokinetic parameters of R,S-sotalol were within the published range and the kinetic parameters for the isomers were grouped as two independent samples and statistically compared. In conclusion, stereoselective pharmacokinetic for sotalol was not observed in cardiac arrhythmic patients, i.e., both R- and S-sotalol enantiomers have the same pharmacokinetic profile.", 
    "34": "Adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland is the leading type of cancer in women. Among these breast cancers those that are estrogen-responsive respond well to existing therapeutic regimens while estrogen non-responsive cancers metastasize widely, demonstrate a high relapse rate, and respond poorly to therapy. Over-expression of the arachidonic acid-metabolizing enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 and lypoxygenases is frequently observed in breast cancer, particularly the non-estrogen-responsive type, suggesting a role of the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade in the growth regulation of these malignancies. Adenocarcinomas of the lungs, pancreas and colon also frequently over-express AA-metabolizing enzymes, and recent evidence suggests that the growth-regulating AA-cascade in these malignancies is under beta-adrenergic control. Our current experiments have therefore tested the hypothesis that in analogy to these findings adenocarcinomas of the breast are also regulated by beta-adrenergic receptors via stimulation of the AA-cascade. Analysis of DNA synthesis by [3H]-thymidine incorporation assays in three estrogen-responsive and three estrogen non-responsive cell lines derived from human breast cancers demonstrated a significant reduction in DNA synthesis by beta-blockers and inhibitors of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenases in all cell lines. Analysis of AA-release in one of the most responsive cell lines demonstrated a time-dependent increase in AA-release in response to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Analysis by RT-PCR revealed expression of beta2-adrenergic receptors in all cell lines whereas beta1-adrenergic receptors were not found in two of the estrogen non-responsive cell lines. Our data suggest that a significant subset of human breast cancers is under control of beta-adrenergic receptors via stimulation of the AA-cascade. These findings open up novel avenues for the prevention and clinical management of breast cancer, particularly the non-estrogen-responsive types. Moreover, our findings suggest that cardiovascular disease and adenocarcinomas in a variety of organ systems, including the breast may share common risk factors and benefit from similar preventive and treatment strategies.",

Using dynamic positron emission tomography, myocardial perfusion at rest and perfusion reserve after dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg/min) were measured. Myocardial glucose uptake and plasma levels of catecholamines were also estimated. Carvedilol treatment reduced the rate-pressure product (8,781 +/- 2,672 vs 6,342 +/- 1,346, p <0.01) and improved ejection fraction (29 +/- 7% vs 37 +/- 11%, p <0.001), whereas no changes were observed in the control group. Perfusion at rest was unchanged in the placebo group (0.81 +/- 0.17 vs 0.86 +/- 0.23 ml/g/min, p = NS), whereas the carvedilol-treated group showed a significant reduction (0.88 +/- 0.26 vs 0.75 +/- 0.16 ml/g/min, p <0.05). Dipyridamole-induced hyperemia was significantly reduced after carvedilol treatment (1.51 +/- 0.45 vs 1.31 +/- 0.51 ml/g/min, p <0.001), whereas myocardial perfusion reserve was unaltered. Carvedilol did not alter myocardial glucose uptake (0.33 +/- 0.14 vs 0.32 +/- 0.12 micromol/g/min, p = NS) or the plasma catecholamines levels. We therefore conclude that in patients with congestive heart failure, carvedilol reduced resting and hyperemic perfusion. No effect on glucose uptake or catecholamine levels was observed. The reduced perfusion at rest must reflect reduced perfusion demand and thereby a higher threshold for myocardial ischemia and protection against myocardial damage or malignant arrhythmia. These effects may serve as a pathophysiologic explanation for the reduced mortality in patients with congestive heart failure who receive carvedilol.", 
    "36": "Simple, rapid and sensitive spectrophotometric procedures were developed for the analysis of atenolol, timolol maleate, propranolol hydrochloride, metoprolol tartarate, betaxolol hydrochloride, levobunolol hydrochloride and bisprolol fumarate in pure form as well as in their pharmaceutical formulations. The methods are based on the reaction of these drugs as n-electron donors with the sigma-acceptor iodine, and the pi-acceptors: 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane, 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone, tetracyanoethylene, 2,3,5,6-tetrabromo-1,4-benzoquinone (bromanil) and 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (chloranil). The obtained charge-transfer complexes were measured at 365 nm for iodine (in 1,2-dichloroethane), at 840, 420, and 470 nm for 7,7,8,8-tetracyan-oquinodimethane, tetracyanoethylene and 2,3-di-chloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (in acetonitrile), respectively, and at 450 and 440 nm for bromanil and chloranil (in ethanol), respectively. Due to the rapid development of colors at ambient temperature, the obtained results were used on thin-layer chromatograms for the detection of the investigated drugs. Beer's plots were obeyed in a general concentration range of 4-120 microg ml(-1) with correlation coefficients not less than 0.9991. The proposed procedures could be applied successfully to the determination of the investigated drugs in tablets and ophthalmic solutions with good recovery; percent ranged from 98.03+/-0.98 to 100.30+/-0.90. The association constants and standard free energy changes using Benesi-Hildebrand plots were studied.", 
    "37": "The study was aimed at investigating the possible involvement of noradrenergic mechanisms in the lateral septum (LS) for elaboration of male sexual behavior in rats. In this study, norepinephrine (NE), yohimbine (YOH), isoproterenol (ISOP), propranolol (PROP), saline (SAL) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were injected bilaterally in the LS in six different groups of sexually active male rats, and various components of sex behavior were recorded. The application of NE (3 microg) and alpha(2)-antagonist YOH (1 microg) produced a stimulation of most of the components of male sexual behavior, and there was increase in sexual arousal as well as performance. The microinfusion of nonspecific beta-agonist ISOP (2 microg) also produced a stimulation of copulatory behavior whereas beta-antagonist PROP (2 microg) produced an inhibition. The stimulation of male sexual behavior by YOH application at the LS could be due to an increased release of NE by its blocking effect on presynaptic alpha(2)-receptors. These results suggest that the noradrenergic system in the LS has stimulatory effect upon male sexual behavior, probably acting through beta-receptors.",

The norepinephrine-induced increase in PLD activity was completely blocked by the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin and was unaffected by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Further characterisation of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes with selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists demonstrated a complete inhibition of the norepinephrine-induced phospholipase D activation by WB 4101 (alpha(1A)-selective: 0.06+/-0.01 microg/mg) and by BMY 7378 (alpha(1D)-selective: 0.07+/-0.01 microg/mg).

As a trigger mechanism, atrial extrasystoles were simulated by constant asynchronous pacing at a cycle length of 1000 ms from randomly selected right or left atrial electrodes, using a biatrial epicardial multielectrode with 128 bipoles. Additionally, a transvenous pacing lead was screwed into the interatrial septum. Four electrodes located in the high and low right (HRA/LRA) and left atrium (HLA/LLA) were selected for preventive multisite stimulation. Constant pacing at a cycle length 30 ms below sinus rate was applied from the following site(s): HRA, septal, HRA+LRA, HRA+LLA, HRA+LRA+LLA and HRA+LRA+HLA+LLA (order randomized). Number and duration of AF episodes were studied during 10 min intervals, separated by 5 min pauses, respectively. To validate the model, the protocol was repeated 10 min after i.v. bolus administration of D,L-sotalol (1 mg/kg body weight).",

To avoid possible direct activation of atrial myocardium, we also applied a train (50-100 ms duration) of high frequency stimuli (200 Hz) coupled to each atrial paced beat so that the train fell within the atrial refractory period. Stimulation in the LPA at an average of 14+/-7 V induced heart rate slowing, APDs were seen followed by AT/AF at a voltage of 20+/-6 V, P=0.002. Stimulation in the LPA resulted in APDs arising from a variety of sites including the left pulmonary veins (superior or inferior) and the left atrial appendage. After beta-blockade (intravenous esmolol or propranolol, 1 mg/kg) the voltage threshold for induction of AF rose from 14+/-7 to 25+/-10 V, P=0.02. Upon the addition of intravenous atropine (1-2 mg) the arrhythmic response (AF) to stimulation was completely abolished. Atrial pacing threshold was unchanged after autonomic blockade. Local application of radiofrequency energy (average number=3+/-2) across the metallic splines of the basket catheter in the LPA (70-80 V for 60 s) caused abolition of both the slowing and the arrhythmic response to LPA stimulation.",

Mitral stenosis is the most frequently encountered rheumatic valvular lesion. A variety of pregnancy-associated cardiovascular changes often exacerbate the signs and symptoms of valvular lesions. Pregnancy should not be allowed to proceed, if possible, in patients with uncorrected severe valvular lesions or mechanical heart valves requiring anticoagulation, as maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality are high. For those with milder disease, pregnancy is best undertaken after the valvular lesion has been rectified or stabilised. Recent advances in the management of valvular disease include the use of beta-blockers for patients with mitral stenosis, vasodilators in those with aortic and mitral regurgitation, and percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty for mitral and aortic stenosis. Application of these therapies in the pregnant patient is as yet unclear, and management decision needs to be individualized, weighing the risk and benefit to ensure maternal survival and to promote fetal well-being.",

Both alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and neurogenic blockade induced an upward shift in the dose-response curve for both EDV and EIDV. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade did not change resting FBF or EIDV, but induced a significant decrease in EDV (P = 0.015). Neuropeptide Y(1) receptor blocker induced no significant changes in resting FBF, EDV and EIDV and neither did saline. No changes in blood pressure or heart rate were induced by any of the blockades. 4. Whereas beta-adrenoceptor blockade impaired EDV, alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and neurogenic blockade caused a general vasodilation that was not endothelium dependent. Neuropeptide Y does not seem to influence blood flow in the resting forearm.",

    "74": "The mechanisms of malaria parasite clearance in the host are not well understood, but are ascribed to the intact spleen, the site for parasite clearance. The infection induces a huge increase in spleen volume and cellularity. There is, however, a lack of studies on the splenic production of chemokines, which are small proteins that control homing and activation of immune cells and must be crucial for organized tissue growth. We studied the spleen cell production of SDF-1, a primordial chemokine of the CXCL12 class, through mRNA Reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction of both isoforms, alpha and beta, in lethal (Plasmodium berghei ANKA) and non-lethal recrudescent malaria (Plasmodium chabaudi CR) in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse strains. In non-lethal P. chabaudi malaria in C57BL/6 mice, SDF-1alpha mRNA production clearly peaked before the control of parasitemia, a fact not observed in the same mouse strain infected with lethal P. berghei, when this production was lower and without peaks. The infection of BALB/c mice infected with the same Plasmodium species led to a similar evolution of parasitemia and also chemokine production, albeit at lower levels. SDF-1beta synthesis was more constant and regular during both infections, presenting some variation but usually occurring at all the experimental times. Supplementation of lethal models with SDF-1alpha i.p., at the time when endogenous stromal cell chemokine production peaked in non-lethal models, induced a clear reduction in parasitemia, probably with prolonged host survival. Blocking SDF-1 action by administration of T-140, a CXCR4 receptor blocker, caused an increase in circulating parasites in the usually benign non-lethal P. chabaudi malaria in C57BL/6 mice, mainly at recrudescence of parasitemia. These data suggest that SDF-1alpha production in the spleen plays an important role in rodent malaria, and its supplementation was found to partially correct defects in the control of malaria in lethal models.",

Possible stratification factors, such as sex, diagnosis, presence of psychotic features, HAMD scores at baseline, pindolol augmentation and SSRIs plasma levels did not significantly influence the observed results. The investigated MAOA and 5-HT-2A gene variants, therefore, do not seem to play a major role in SSRI antidepressant activity.", 
    "76": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of tablet surface area/volume (SA/Vol) on drug release from controlled-release matrix tablets containing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). Soluble drugs (promethazine HCl, diphenhydramine HCl, and propranolol HCl) were utilized in this study to give predominantly diffusion-controlled release. Drug release from HPMC matrix tablets with similar values of SA/Vol was comparable within the same tablet shape (i.e., flat-faced round tablets) and among different shapes (i.e., oval, round concave, flat-faced beveled-edge, and flat-faced round tablets). Tablets having the same surface area but different SA/Vol values did not result in similar drug release; tablets with larger SA/Vol values hadfaster release profiles. Utility of SA/Vol to affect drug release was demonstrated by changing drug doses, and altering tablet shape to adjust SA/Vol. When SA/Vol was held constant, similar release profiles were obtained with f2 metric values greater than 70. Thus, surface area/volume is one of the key variables in controlling drug release from HPMC matrix tablets. Proper use of this variable has practical application by formulators who may need to duplicate drug release profiles from tablets of different sizes and different shapes.",

The coronary anastomosis was performed using a brief local occlusion of the coronary artery. An anastomosis between the left ITA and the CFX was done first, and then the right ITA and the LAD were anastomosed.

Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PI4P5K) catalyses the production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which stimulates phospholipase D1 (PLD1) activity in mammalian and yeast cells. PLD1 catalyses the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA), which has been shown to activate PI4P5Ks in mammalian and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. In the present study, PI4P5K activity in the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans was identified. A gene with significant sequence homology to the S. cerevisiae PI4P5K was cloned and designated MSS4. This gene was demonstrated to encode a functional PI4P5K by expression in S. cerevisiae. This enzyme was found to be membrane-associated and was stimulated by PA. Within the first 20 min after induction of polarized hyphal growth induced by a shift to elevated temperature, PI4P5K activity increased 2.5-fold. This stimulation was not observed when hyphae were induced by a combination of elevated temperature and serum. A lack of PLD1 activity resulted in the loss of induction of PI4P5K activity during the morphogenetic switch. Furthermore, the addition of propranolol attenuated the stimulation of PI4P5K activity during morphogenesis. These results suggest that PA derived from PLD1 activity stimulates C. albicans PI4P5K during the switch to the hyphal form under some conditions.",

Both WIN-55212-2 (150 microg kg(-1)) and HU 210 (100 microg kg(-1)) had pressor, renal, and mesenteric vasoconstrictor and hindquarters vasodilator actions, although the effects of HU 210 were much more sustained than those of WIN-55212-2. Lower doses of the cannabinoids (WIN-55212-2, 50 microg kg(-1), HU 210, 10 microg kg(-1)) had less consistent actions. All the significant cardiovascular effects of WIN-55212-2 and HU 210 were antagonized by pretreatment with AM 251 (3 mg kg(-1)). Furthermore, pretreatment with the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551, inhibited the hindquarters vasodilator effects of WIN-55212-2 and of HU 210. On the basis of the present findings, and our earlier work, it is suggested that, in conscious rats, the pressor and vasoconstrictor effects of HU 210 and WIN-55212-2 involve cannabinoid-receptor-mediated increases in sympathetic activity. The accompanying hindquarters vasodilator actions of these agonists are cannabinoid receptor-mediated and appear to involve beta(2)-adrenoceptors.", 
    "87": "The mechanisms regulating leptin secretion were investigated in isolated rat white adipocytes. Insulin (1-100 nM) linearly stimulated leptin secretion from incubated adipocytes for at least 2 h. The adrenergic agonists norepinephrine, isoproterenol (two nonselective beta-agonists), or CL-316243 (potent beta3) all inhibited insulin (10 nM)-stimulated leptin release. The inhibitory effects of norepinephrine and isoproterenol could be reversed not only by the nonselective antagonist propranolol but also by the selective antagonists ICI-89406 (beta1) or ICI-118551 (beta2), the beta2-antagonist being less effective than the beta1. Insulin-stimulated leptin secretion could also be inhibited by a series of agents increasing intracellular cAMP levels, such as lipolytic hormones (ACTH and thyrotropin-stimulating hormone), various nonhydrolyzable cAMP analogs, pertussis toxin, forskolin, methylxanthines (caffeine, theophylline, IBMX), and specific inhibitors of phosphodiesterase III (imazodan, milrinone, and amrinone). Significantly, antilipolytic agents other than insulin (adenosine, nicotinic acid, acipimox, and orthovanadate) did not mimic the acute stimulatory effects of insulin on leptin secretion under these conditions. We conclude that norepinephrine specifically inhibits insulin-stimulated leptin secretion not only via the low-affinity beta3-adrenoceptors but also via the high-affinity beta1/beta2-adrenoceptors. Moreover, it is suggested that 1) activation of phosphodiesterase III by insulin represents an important metabolic step in stimulation of leptin secretion, and 2) lipolytic hormones competitively counterregulate the stimulatory effects of insulin by activating the adenylate cyclase system.", 
    "88": "Pancreatic beta-cells have an intrinsic oscillatory Ca2+ activity supposed to be synchronized among the islets by cytoplasmic Ca2+ transients elicited by nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) neurons. To improve the understanding of this process, the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured in two insulin-releasing cell lines using dual wavelength microfluorometry and the indicator fura-2. INS-1 cells but not RINm5F cells were found to generate transients of [Ca2+]i in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker methoxyverapamil. These transients differed from those occurring in native beta-cells persisting in the presence of thapsigargin or during prolonged exposure to ATP. Moreover, the [Ca2+]i transients were poorly synchronized whether or not the INS-1 cells had physical contact. If appearing in native beta-cells, the type of [Ca2+]i transients now observed may interfere with the coordination of the beta-cell rhythmicity evoked by NANC neurons.",

Administrated beta 2-agonists were observed to result in reducing iNOs activity in the rats with BA, while propranolol intensified iNOs expression.", 
    "90": "The rectum has an intrinsic nervous mechanism represented by the enteric nervous plexus (ENP) and an extrinsic one mediated by the parasympathetic nerves. Rectal distension evokes the rectoanal inhibitory reflex, which acts through the ENP and is considered the main mechanism responsible for defecation. However, the role of the parasympathetic innervation compared to the role of the intrinsic mechanism of the defecation act has so far not been sufficiently addressed in the literature. The current study investigated this point. Twelve dogs were anesthetized. The anal and rectal pressures were recorded during rectal balloon distension with normal saline in 10 ml increments until the balloon was expelled to the exterior. The test was repeated after ENP block with a (phentolamine) and b (propranolol) adrenoceptor blocking agents and then after rectal denervation by bilateral pelvic ganglionectomy. The rectal balloon was expelled to the exterior at rectal balloon distension with 30 to 40 ml. After separate administration of phentolamine and propranolol, it was dispelled at a distending volume of 50 to 60 ml, and after rectal denervation at a volume of 80 to 90 ml. The results were reproducible. The balloon expulsion test suggests that the intrinsic defecation reflex is weaker than the extrinsic one for inducing defecation, although the two reflexes appear to be complementary. The difference between them in inducing defecation might be significant to our understanding the defecation act in the neurogenic rectum, a point that needs further study.",

The mean increase in serum potassium was 1.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l after nadolol, 0.9 +/- 0.6 after betaxolol and 0.6 +/- 0.6 after placebo. This effect was significantly larger after nadolol than after placebo (p = 0.01), but this relation was not significant with respect to betaxolol (p = 0.30).

In the present study, an active principle was isolated from the methanol extract by biological activity-guided fractionations and identified as asarone. We evaluated neuroprotective actions and action mechanisms of the isolated asarone as well as the alpha- and the beta-asarone obtained commercially. The isolated asarone inhibited the excitotoxicity induced by the exposure of cortical cultures for 15 min to 300 microM NMDA in a concentration-dependent manner, with the IC50 of 56.1 microg/ml. The commercially obtained alpha- and beta-asarone exhibited more potent inhibitions of the NMDA-induced excitotoxicity than the isolated asarone. Their respective IC50 values were 18.2 and 26.5 microg/ml. The excitotoxicity induced by glutamate (Glu) was also inhibited, but with much less potency than the toxicity induced by NMDA. The IC50 values for the alpha-, beta-, and the isolated asarone were 89.7, 121.7, and 279.5 microg/ml, respectively. Based on the receptor-ligand binding studies using a use-dependent NMDA receptor-channel blocker [3H]MK-801, asarone inhibited the specific bindings in a concentration-dependent fashion. These results indicate that asarone, the major essential oil component in AGR, exhibits neuroprotective action against the NMDA- or Glu-induced excitotoxicity through the blockade of NMDA receptor function. The alpha-asarone was found to exhibit more potent inhibition of [3H]MK-801 bindings, which is consistent with its more potent neuroprotective action than the beta- or the isolated asarone.",

Highly soluble drugs, metoprolol and ranitidine, and poorly soluble drugs, acyclovir and furosemide, were chosen as model drugs. The dissolution profiles of both innovator and generic IR products were determined using USP apparatus 2 at 50 rpm and apparatus 3 at 5, 15, and 25 dips per minute (dpm). The dissolution profiles from USP apparatus 3 were compared to those from USP apparatus 2 using the f(2) similarity test. The dissolution profile from USP apparatus 3 generally depends on the agitation rate, with a faster agitation rate producing a faster dissolution rate. It was found that USP apparatus 3 at the extreme low end of the possible agitation range, such as 5 dpm, gave hydrodynamic conditions equivalent to USP apparatus 2 at 50 rpm. With appropriate agitation rate, USP apparatus 3 can produce similar dissolution profiles to USP apparatus 2 or distinguish dissolution characteristics for the IR products of metoprolol, ranitidine, and acyclovir. Incomplete dissolution was observed for the furosemide tablets using USP apparatus 3. Although it is primarily designed for the release testing of extended-release products, USP apparatus 3 may be used for the dissolution testing of IR products of highly soluble drugs, such as metoprolol and ranitidine, and some IR products of poorly soluble drugs, such as acyclovir. USP apparatus 3 offers the advantages of avoiding cone formation and mimicking the changes in physiochemical conditions and mechanical forces experienced by products in the gastrointestinal tract.",

The efficacy of beta-blockers in recurrent syncope is controversial. The value of HUT in predicting efficacy of therapy has not been investigated. Fifty-six patients (44+/-18 years, 36 women) with recurrent syncope (> 1 event in the last 6 months) of suspected neurocardiogenic origin were included in the study. Independent of the response to HUT, patients were randomized to receive metoprolol or propanolol at the maximal tolerated dose (28 patients, group A, 86+/-23 vs 98+/-29 mg/d) or no pharmacological therapy (28 patients, group B). The primary endpoint was the first recurrence of syncope. During the 1-year of follow-up, 20 patients of group A and 8 of group B had no recurrence. In group A, of 20 patients without recurrences 12 had a positive and 8 a negative HUT result while of 8 patients with recurrences 5 had a positive and 3 a negative response to HUT. In the group B, of 20 patients with recurrences 10 had a positive and 10 a negative HUT result while of 8 patients without recurrences 4 had a positive and 4 a negative response to HUT. In a multivariate Cox-regression analysis, medical therapy was the only independent factor for predicting recurrence of syncope (P = 0.004); HUT had no influence in this regard (P = 0.773). In conclusion, lipophilic beta-blockers appear efficacious in preventing recurrent syncope of suspected neurocardiogenic origin. The efficacy of therapy seems to be not predicted by HUT.",

We contrasted findings with the responses of practicing cardiologists in the state. The survey asked cardiologists to describe their recent patterns of beta blocker usage, to comment on the severity of generally recognized contraindications to beta blocker administration, and to speculate on reasons why West Virginia's rates of beta blocker use in AMI were lower than rates in most other states. Our study revealed that beta blocker use in AMI declined significantly with patient age, and that rates of use in larger hospitals exceeded those in smaller hospitals. There was little difference attributable to the specialty of the admitting physician. We also observed a positive association between the use of beta blockers in AMI and other appropriate interventions, such as the use of aspirin and revascularization. Cardiologists said they were using more beta blockers in AMI than five years ago, and speculated that high rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and non-specialist physicians were responsible for low rates in West Virginia.",

A total of 808 subjects were treated in a treatment period of 16 weeks. 142 subjects discontinued the trial prematurely, mainly because of adverse events (n=58). The mean attack frequency in the double-blind period was 2.0 for the FLU 5 mg group, 1.9 for the FLU 10 mg group, and 1.9 for the propranolol group. The mean attack frequency in the last 28 days of the double-blind period was 1.8 for FLU 5 mg, 1.6 for FLU 10 mg, and 1.7 for propranolol. Both flunarizine groups were at least as effective as propranolol (P<0.001 in one-sided test). The percentage of responders (defined as subjects for whom attack frequency decreased by at least 50% compared to run-in) in the last 28 days of the double-blind period was 46% (118/259) for FLU 5 mg, 53% (141/264) for FLU 10 mg, and 48% (125/258) for propranolol. Statistical analysis showed that FLU 10 mg is at least as effective as propranolol (P<0.001) and showed a trend for noninferiority of FLU5 and propranolol (P=0.053). No statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were found for any of the secondary parameters. Overall, 190 subjects reported one or more adverse events during the run-in phase: 54 (20.5%) in the FLU 5 mg group, 76 (27.7%) in the FLU 10 mg group and 60 (22.3%) in the propranolol group. The results of this equivalence trial show that 10 mg flunarizine daily with a drug-free weekend is at least as effective as 160 mg propranolol in the prophylaxis of migraine for all evaluated parameters (one-sided equivalence tests) after 16 weeks of treatment. In addition, 5 mg flunarizine proves to be at least as effective as 160 mg propranolol when looking at the mean attack frequency for both the whole double-blind period and the last 28 days of treatment. However, in the analysis of responders, 160 mg propranolol seems to be slightly better than 5 mg flunarizine. In addition, no significant differences between the three treatments were found with regard to safety: all three treatments were generally well-tolerated and safe.", 
    "120": "The molecular mechanism of glomerular injury in hypertension remains to be clarified. In this study, to examine the possible role of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors in hypertensive glomerular injury, we specifically measured glomerular PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in various models of hypertensive rats using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. A high-salt diet significantly enhanced glomerular PDGF beta-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation of Dahl-salt sensitive rats (DS-rats) without an increase in its protein levels, and this enhancement was associated with an elevation of blood pressure and glomerular injury. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) at hypertensive phase also had higher glomerular PDGF beta-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation levels than control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), while SHR did not. Thus, DS-rats and SHRSP, which are well known to represent severe glomerular injury, had the enhanced PDGF beta-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, while SHR, a hypertensive model without significant glomerular injury had no increased tyrosine phosphorylation. Treatment of DS-rats or SHRSP with benidipine, a calcium channel blocker, significantly lessened the increase in glomerular PDGF beta-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, reduction of urinary protein and albumin excretion. These results suggest that the enhanced activation of glomerular PDGF beta-receptors may be responsible for the development of hypertensive glomerular injury and that the suppression of this receptor activation by a calcium channel blocker may contribute to its renal protective effects.", 
    "121": "We evaluated the protective effects of long-term treatment with betaxolol, a specific beta-antagonist, on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 gene expression in the left ventricle of Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats fed a high-salt diet. In addition, we evaluated the relations between these effects and coronary microvascular remodeling, expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) belonging to one subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and expression of p70S6 kinase belonging to one subfamily of ribosomal S6 kinases. Betaxolol (0.9 mg/kg/day, subdepressor dose) was administered for 5 weeks, from 6 weeks of age to the left ventricular hypertrophy stage at 11 weeks of age. Increased PDGF A-chain and TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein expression were suppressed by betaxolol. Upregulated activities of ERK1/2 and p70S6 kinase phosphorylations were decreased by betaxolol. Betaxolol administration resulted in significant improvements in the wall-to-lumen ratio, perivascular fibrosis and myocardial fibrosis. Thus, we conclude that ERK1/2 and p70S6 kinase activities may play a key role in coronary microvascular remodeling of Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats, and that beneficial effects of betaxolol on cardiovascular remodeling may be at least partially mediated by decreased PDGF A-chain and TGF-beta1 expression in the left ventricle.", 
    "122": "Large and small arteries are remodelled in hypertension - their structure, function and mechanics are altered. These changes contribute to elevated blood pressure and to the complications of hypertension. The present paper concentrates on small (resistance) artery changes in hypertension. In hypertension, these vessels exhibit a form of remodelling known as 'eutrophic' remodelling, in which smooth muscle cells are restructured around a smaller lumen, without true hypertrophy, particularly in milder forms of hypertension. Changes in these small arteries are the first manifestation of target organ damage in patients with hypertension. In more severe forms of hypertension and in secondary hypertension, hypertrophic remodelling has been reported. Stiffness of the vessel wall may be decreased initially; later, as hypertension becomes more severe, the wall of resistance vessels may become stiffer. Endothelial dysfunction occurs in a percentage of patients, similar to the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Interruption of the renin-angiotensin system may correct many of these abnormalities. The present report investigated the effects of angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists on small arteries of hypertensive patients compared with the beta-blocker atenolol in different studies. Beta-blocker treatment did not modify either the structure or the function of small arteries in contrast to the AT1 antagonist losartan in a double-blind, randomized, one-year study. Patients previously treated with atenolol to lower blood pressure, but whose small artery structure and function did not improve, were examined. These hypertensive patients were switched to the AT1 antagonist irbesartan for one year. Gluteal subcutaneous biopsies showed that the structure and endothelial function of small arteries that had remained altered by atenolol treatment were corrected by irbesartan treatment, although blood pressure control with irbesartan was identical to that previously achieved with atenolol. Improved outcomes in clinical trials using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists may be a result of the vascular protective effects offered by these agents.", 
    "123": "Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were developed to better antagonize the effects of chronic overactivation of angiotensin II. In clinical studies, ARBs have consistently been shown to be more tolerable than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis). Although many studies evaluating the benefits of ARBs in clinical practice are underway, relatively little information exists as to their benefits concerning cardiovascular events. In heart failure patients with ACEi intolerance, ARBs may improve survival. In patients who can tolerate an ACEi, ARBs reduce hospitalization. Due to a possible detrimental interaction when an ARB is added to the treatment of patients already taking an ACEi and a beta-blocker, the use of ARBs in such heart failure patients is not generally indicated. ARBs also preserve renal function and may reduce cardiovascular events in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. However, there is no convincing evidence that ARBs improve the survival of these patients. Thus, ARBs should be used on their own merits and should not be used as substitutes for ACEis in this patient population. Studies to establish the status of ARBs in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases are ongoing, but until they are completed, care should be taken in extrapolating the effects of ARBs to those of ACEis.",

Skull-based percutaneous power delivery was derived from cochlear implant technology. We used this system in 4 patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. Exercise capacity, quality of life, device parameters, and native heart function were monitored serially. One patient died from right heart failure at 3 months. The other patients were discharged from hospital between 3 and 8 weeks postoperatively and are currently New York Heart Association I or II. Follow-up lasted between 9 and 20 months.

    "128": "The passive and iontophoretic permeability of timolol maleate (TM) through porous and dense artificial membranes was investigated in order to select the most optimal membrane for a transdermal drug delivery system. For the meso-porous membranes (pore diameter 2-50 nm), the TM permeability for passive diffusion and iontophoresis was practically the same. For the micro-porous membranes (pore diameter<2 nm), a significant transport contribution of iontophoresis was observed, which was more pronounced when higher current densities were applied. The electrical resistance of all the porous membranes was lower than the electrical resistance of human skin. For dense membranes, passive and iontophoretic TM permeability was significantly lower than for porous membranes and in most cases their electrical resistance was comparable or even higher than the resistance of human skin. For most of the membranes studied the average adsorption of TM at 37 degrees C was low (0.02-0.33 mg/cm(2)) and independent of the TM concentration. For the meso-porous mixed cellulose acetate-cellulose nitrate membrane the TM adsorption was significantly higher and increased with the TM concentration. Based on our results, the optimum membrane for an iontophoretic transdermal TM delivery system is the LFC 1 micro-porous membrane because it mainly controls the TM delivery (TM iontophoretic permeability: 0.86 x 10(-6) cm/s), has very low electrical resistance (0.9-1.5 komega cm(2)) and the TM adsorption to it is low (0.15 mg/cm(2)). The therapeutic plasma TM concentration is achievable by application of this membrane in realistic sizes (5-64 cm(2)) and by application of current densities between 0.13 and 0.5 mA/cm(2).", 
    "129": "The degradation rate of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is typically modified by copolymerization of the glycolide with lactide. In the present study, the degradation rate of PDLLA was modified by a novel linking of PLA with 2,2'-bis(2-oxazoline). This modification resulted in formation of a more rapidly degrading poly(ester amide) (PEA) for controlled drug release. The hydrolytic degradation of PDLLA and PEA films was studied in PBS (pH 7.4, USP XXIV, 37 degrees C); the resulting decrease in molecular weight was determined by size exclusion chromatography and the weight loss of films was measured. Drug releases of guaifenesin (mw 198.2), timolol (mw 332.4), sodium salicylate (mw 160.1) and FITC-dextran (mw 4400) from PDLLA and PEA films and microspheres were examined in PBS (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C). The degradation rate of PEA was substantially greater than that of PDLLA. The release profiles of all small model drugs (mw <332.4) from PDLLA films were biphasic or triphasic, while the release profiles of small model drugs from PEA films varied extensively. Due to the faster weight loss of PEA, FITC-dextran (mw 4400) was released substantially more rapidly from PEA microspheres than from PDLLA microspheres. In conclusion, all model drugs, except guaifenesin, were released faster from PEA preparations than from PDLLA preparations.",

    "135": "Peroxynitrite is a strong oxidizing agent that is formed in the reaction of nitric oxide and superoxide anion. It is capable of oxidizing and nitrating a variety of biological targets including DNA, and these modifications may be responsible for a number of pathological conditions and diseases. A recent study showed that peroxynitrite reacts with 2',3',5'-tri-O-acetylguanosine to yield a novel compound, tri-O-acetyl-1-(beta-D-erythro-pentafuranosyl)-5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole, and, unlike other peroxynitrite-mediated guanine oxidation products, it is a stable and significant component formed even at low peroxynitrite concentrations. In this work, we studied the in vitro formation of the guanine-derived product, 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole, in synthetic oligonucleotides and DNA treated with peroxynitrite. When calf thymus DNA or oligonucleotides were reacted with peroxynitrite at ambient temperature, the modified base 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole was generated along with several other products. The oligonucleotides containing the 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole modification were purified by reverse-phase and anion-exchange HPLC and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry. 5-Guanidino-4-nitroimidazole formation in peroxynitrite-treated DNA was characterized after enzymatic digestion of the reacted DNA to the nucleoside level. HPLC purification and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (with selected reaction monitoring) enabled the analysis of this modified nucleoside with high sensitivity. The yield of 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole formed in single-stranded DNA was approximately 10-fold higher than that found in duplex DNA. With calf thymus DNA, 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole was dose-dependently formed at low peroxynitrite concentrations. In stability tests, a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole modification was only partially cleaved by hot piperidine and was a weak substrate for Fpg glycosylase repair enzyme; in addition, this site was not cleaved by endonuclease III. These results suggest that nuclear DNA containing 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole may not be quickly repaired by DNA repair enzyme systems. Finally, primer extension experiments revealed that this lesion is a potential DNA replication blocker when polymerization is catalyzed by polymerase alpha and polymerase I (Klenow fragment, lack of exonuclease activity) but not with human polymerase beta. Replication fidelity experiments further showed that 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole may cause G-->T and G-->C transversions in calf thymus polymerase alpha and E. coli polymerase I.", 
    "136": "The most striking clinical effects of hyperthyroidism are on the heart. These effects concern both heart rate and function. The increased contractility is mainly based on the indirect inotropic effect of peripheral vasodilation as a consequence of hyperthyroidism. Although contractility at rest is enhanced in hyperthyroidism, cardiac reserve is decreased due to diminished chronotropic, inotropic and vasodilatory reserve. In hyperthyroid patients, the clinical impression is often that of a hyperadrenergic circulation. However, the sensitivity of the heart for catecholamines is not increased. The diminution of palpitations by beta-adrenergic blockers in hyperthyroid patients is due to both a decrease in heart rate and atrial extrasystoles, and is not the consequence of a normalisation of cardiac contractility. Heart failure is almost exclusively found in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease. In the case of serious heart failure a rapid reduction of circulating thyroid hormone by means of thyreostatics is important as well. There is no consensus as to whether patients with thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation should be treated with oral anticoagulants. However, most experts recommend oral anticoagulants for elderly patients (> 60 years) or patients with additional risk factors for embolism.",

This study was among the first randomized, controlled pediatric antihypertensive medication trials, in which the combination drug bisoprolol fumarate/hydrochlorothiazide (B/HT) was compared with placebo. The study comprised a 2-week single-blind placebo screening period, a 6-week double-blind dose titration period, a 4-week double-blind dose maintenance period, and a 2-week double-blind dose-tapering period. One hundred and forty subjects were enrolled to achieve 94 randomized subjects treated either with B/HT ( n=62) or placebo ( n=32). B/HT induced significant reductions compared with placebo for average sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) (9.3 vs. 4.9 mmHg, P<0.05) and sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) (7.2 vs. 2.7 mmHg, P<0.05). The placebo-subtracted BP reductions were greater in younger children and those with more-severe baseline hypertension. The percentage of subjects with BP less than the 90th percentile at study completion was 45% for B/HT and 34% for placebo ( P=NS). Although the study demonstrated that B/HT reduced BP safely compared with placebo, the large placebo effect and failure of most subjects to achieve target BP control make it uncertain whether B/HT is appropriate first-line therapy for pediatric hypertension, particularly in adolescents with mild-to-moderate BP elevation.", 
    "138": "Glucose absorption via the sodium glucose-linked transporter (SGLT)-1, decreases the glucose concentration in the ruminant forestomach and may ameliorate or prevent ruminal lactic acidosis. Because acidotic ruminants show increased sympathetic activity, the possibility of adrenergic modulation of SGLT-1 was investigated. Glucose uptake into ovine ruminal epithelia was measured in Ussing chambers after the addition of 200 micromol/L (14)C-labeled glucose to the mucosal solution. Glucose uptake decreased (P < 0.05) by >50% in comparison with control after mucosal addition of the SGLT-1 inhibitor, phlorizin (100 micromol/L). Serosal preincubation with 100 micromol/L epinephrine increased (P < 0.05) the phlorizin-sensitive glucose uptake in the absence and presence of indomethacin (10 micromol/L). The effect of epinephrine was simulated by beta- (100 micromol/L isoproterenol) and beta(2)-receptor agonists (10 micromol/L terbutaline), as well as by direct stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (10 micromol/L forskolin). The serosal addition of methoxamine, clonidine, dobutamine or BRL 37344 had no effect. Inhibition of protein kinase A with 2 micromol/L H 89 completely abolished the stimulation of glucose uptake by epinephrine. We conclude that ruminal SGLT-1 can be stimulated via beta(2)-dependent generation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate.",

The cause of myocardial enzyme release could be an obvious angiographic complication of the procedure but, most frequently, is neither clinically nor angiographically clear. Different clinical series have identified clinical, angiographic and procedural risk factors for CK-MB elevation after otherwise successful coronary intervention, including unstable angina, diffuse atherosclerosis and aggressive procedures such as atheroablation. Microembolization of atherothrombotic plaque material appears to be the pathogenetic mechanism. Periprocedural administration of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors has been shown to reduce subsequent myocardial infarction and long-term mortality. Beta-blockers may also have a protective effect against post-procedural CK-MB elevations and follow-up cardiac events. New distal protection devices are under investigation and appear promising. The risk of inducing myocardial damage during percutaneous intervention should be considered before attempting the procedure. The use of platelet IIb/IIIa inhibitors and protection devices should be considered in high-risk patients.",

    "152": "Acute effects of Ace, Meth and IL-1 on AChE activity, ACh and CRF mRNA levels in, and CRF-release from the hypothalamus were studied in vitro. The hypothalamus samples were dissected from the rat brain and were incubated in vitro with IL-1, Ace or Meth in the presence or absence of Dex, Atrop, PTL, PROP and GABA. Ace and Meth, but not IL-1, inhibited AChE activity, while all three compounds; (1) increased ACh and CRF mRNA levels in and CRF release from; (2) activated the CRE promoter region of CRF-gene in: and (3) increased cFos binding to the AP-1 region of the CRF-gene in the hypothalamus. Dex suppressed the effects of IL-1, possibly by inducing the nGRE regulatory sites of the CRF-gene. Dex, however, did not modulate the effects of Ace and Meth on the hypothalamus, which may be attributed to the failure of Dex to modulate the CRF-gene's nGRE regulatory sites. Atrop caused 80-90% inhibition of the effects of IL-1, but caused only 50-65% inhibition of the effects of Ace or Meth on CRF mRNA levels in and CRF release from the hypothalamus. PTL did not affect, while PROP slightly attenuated the effects of IL-1 and the insecticides on the hypothalamus. GABA attenuated the effects of the insecticides but not the effects of IL-1 on the hypothalamus. This suggests that the IL-1-induced augmentation of CRF synthesis in and release from the hypothalamus is mediated through a cholinergic pathway, while the insecticide-induced augmentation of CRF synthesis in and release from the hypothalamus is mediated through the cholinergic and GABAergic pathways. The insecticides, but not IL-1, disrupt feedback regulation of CRF synthesis in and release from the hypothalamus.", 
    "153": "Building upon its promising initial performance, the online coupling of capillary isotachophoresis (cITP) to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is extended to trace impurity analysis. By simultaneously concentrating and separating dilute charged species on the basis of their electrophoretic mobility, cITP greatly facilitates NMR structural elucidation. cITP/NMR appears particularly attractive for identifying trace charged synthetic and natural organic compounds obscured by large excesses of other components. A 9.4 microL injection of 200 microM (1.9 nmol) atenolol in a 1000-fold excess of sucrose (200 mM) is analyzed by cITP/NMR. A microcoil, the most mass sensitive NMR probe, serves as the detector as it provides optimal NMR observation of the capillary-scale separation. cITP successfully isolates the atenolol from the sucrose while concentrating it 200-fold to 40 mM before presentation to the 30 nL observe volume microcoil, thereby enabling rapid 1H NMR spectral acquisition of atenolol (experimental time of 10 s) without obstruction from sucrose. For this particular probe and sample, the stacking efficiency is near the theoretical limit as 67% of the sample occupies the 1 mm long microcoil during peak maximum. A multiple-coil probe with two serial 1 mm long microcoils arranged 1 cm apart has been developed to facilitate peak trapping and sample band positioning during cITP/NMR.", 
    "154": "Type 2 diabetes characteristically involves disturbances of the beta-cell function including reduced insulin secretion in response to elevated glucose. In experimental diabetes, beta cells are often \"blind\" to glucose, and clonal beta-cell lines chronically exposed to glucose show impaired glucose sensing. The present study focuses on the effect of long-term exposure to high-glucose concentrations on insulin secretion, insulin store, and insulin mRNA content in the beta-cell line INS-1. The cellular insulin mRNA content has been shown to be reduced by approximately 90% on such exposure for 4 days. This decrement could be partly counteracted by subsequent culture for 4 days at low glucose, while daily alternate culture in high and low glucose did not prevent the insulin mRNA content from being reduced. The insulin release from cells cultured at high glucose was simultaneously reduced by 50%. This change was, however, not reversed by subsequent culture at low glucose, a pattern also found for the intracellular insulin stores. The suppression of insulin mRNA, insulin release, and intracellular insulin stores induced by high glucose was completely neutralized by the metabolic glucokinase blocker, mannoheptulose, while 2-deoxyglucose, a phosphoglucose isomerase blocker, had no impact. This suggests that glucokinase activity may have a negative regulatory effect. Addition of D-glyceraldehyde (DG) induced an increase in insulin release, while insulin mRNA remained unaltered. It would therefore seem that at least one glucose metabolite is involved in the glucose desensitization in INS-1 cells, which opens the prospect of regulatory factor(s), which possess(es) negative, as well as positive, actions.",
