Beta-adrenergic receptor block has been shown to be effective in controlling the disproportionate increase in heart rate, maintaining a favorable hemodynamic profile and apparently improving the efficiency of the cardiovascular system in order to maintain tissue perfusion. They have also been shown to modulate favorably catecholamine-induced immunosuppression and to decrease insulin resistance, protein catabolism, and proinflammatory cytokine expression associated with cardiovascular dysfunction. Selective beta-1 blockers appear to provide better results than non-selective blockers, even suggesting a positive impact on mortality. Future clinical trials are still needed to confirm these findings and define the scope of their benefits.",

The transdermal PPL\u2009\u00b7\u2009HCl gel was prepared by a direct swelling method, which chose hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as the matrix and used terpenes plus alcohols as permeation enhancer. Permeation studies of PPL\u2009\u00b7\u2009HCl were carried out with modified Franz diffusion cells through piglet skin. Our results pointed to that among all studied permeation enhancers, farnesol plus isopropanol was the most effective combination (Q24, 6027.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009563.1\u2009\u03bcg/cm(2), ER, 6.8), which was significantly higher than that of control gel (p\u2009<\u20090.05). High percutaneous penetration with related lower plasma drug level of PPL\u2009\u00b7\u2009HCl gel was confirmed by microdialysis technique in rats using the homemade PPL\u2009\u00b7\u2009HCl oral solution as a control. Clinical studies also confirmed the excellent therapeutic response and few side effects of the PPL\u2009\u00b7\u2009HCl gel.

However, individual patient responses to these pharmacotherapies vary widely. The variability in response cannot be explained entirely by clinical characteristics, and genetic variation may play a role. The purpose of this chapter is to examine the current knowledge in the field of beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor pharmacogenetics in HF. \u03b2-blocker and ACE inhibitor pharmacogenetic studies performed in patients with HF were identified from the PubMed database from 1966 to July 2011. Thirty beta-blocker and 10 ACE inhibitor pharmacogenetic studies in patients with HF were identified.The ACE deletion variant was associated with greater survival benefit from ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers compared with the ACE insertion. Ser49 in the \u03b21AR, the insertion in the \u03b12CAR, and Gln41 in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase (GRK)-5 are associated with greater survival benefit from \u03b2-blockers, compared with Gly49, the deletion, and Leu41, respectively. However, many of these associations have not been validated. The HF pharmacogenetic literature is still in its very early stages, but there are promising candidate genetic variants that may identify which HF patients are most likely to benefit from beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors and patients that may require additional therapies.",

In this study PRP was used as an adjuvant in combination with Plasmodium berghei (P. berghei) whole blood stage (PWBS) antigens. BALB/c mice were immunized three times with a 2-week interval, either PWBS vaccine alone or in combination with the adjuvant alum or propranolol. The control group received phosphate buffered saline. Evaluation of the cellular and humoral immunity was performed by measurement of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, lymphocyte proliferation, total IgG and IgG2a in the control and immunized groups. Furthermore, Clinical evaluations were carried out by analyze survival rate and parasitemia of the mice. Our results showed that the mice immunized with propranolol induced higher levels of antibody, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 as well as stronger lymphocyte proliferative responses compared with other groups. This resulted in improved protective immunity against Plasmodium berghei. Administration of the PRP as an adjuvant in combination with the PWBS Antigen vaccine can shift the immune responses to a T helper1 pattern and enhance the protective immunity.",

RADA 16 is a simple and versatile self-assembling peptide with a designed structure formed of two distinct surfaces, one hydrophilic and one hydrophobic that are positioned in such a well-ordered fashion allowing precise assembly into a predetermined organization. A \"smart\" architecture in nanostructures can represent a good opportunity to use RADA16 as a carrier system for hydrophobic drugs solving problems of drugs delivery. In this work, we have investigated the diffusion properties of Pindolol, Quinine and Timolol maleate from RADA16 in PBS and in BSS-PLUS at 37\u00b0C. A sustained, controlled, reproducible and efficient drug release has been detected for all the systems, which allows to understand the dependence of release kinetics on the physicochemical characteristics of RADA16 structural and chemical properties of the selected drugs and the nature of solvents used. For the analysis various physicochemical characterization techniques were used in order to investigate the state of the peptide before and after the drugs were added. Not only does RADA16 optimise drug performance, but it can also provide a solution for drug delivery issues associated with lipophilic drugs.",

Myocardial bridging is usually benign, but has been associated with exercise-related cardiac events. Guidelines for athletic participation in these patients are primarily based on reports from the general population with myocardial bridging. We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, Ovid and Google Scholar for articles addressing exercise-related cardiac events associated with myocardial bridging. We identified 69 cases of which only 35 were well defined. We conclude that there are insufficient data to form definitive guidelines as to how physically active individuals with myocardial bridging should be managed. Prudence suggests that management should be individualized for those with possible symptoms. Beta adrenergic blockade is recommended as initial medical therapy. Surgery should be restricted to those with continued symptoms despite beta blocker therapy.

We have performed a repositioning screen for WNT-TCF response blockers aiming to recapitulate the genetic blockade afforded by dominant-negative TCF. We report that Ivermectin inhibits the expression of WNT-TCF targets, mimicking dnTCF, and that its low concentration effects are rescued by direct activation by TCF(VP16). Ivermectin inhibits the proliferation and increases apoptosis of various human cancer types. It represses the levels of C-terminal \u03b2-CATENIN phosphoforms and of CYCLIN D1 in an okadaic acid-sensitive manner, indicating its action involves protein phosphatases. In vivo, Ivermectin selectively inhibits TCF-dependent, but not TCF-independent, xenograft growth without obvious side effects. Analysis of single semi-synthetic derivatives highlights Selamectin, urging its clinical testing and the exploration of the macrocyclic lactone chemical space. Given that Ivermectin is a safe anti-parasitic agent used by > 200 million people against river blindness, our results suggest its additional use as a therapeutic WNT-TCF pathway response blocker to treat WNT-TCF-dependent diseases including multiple cancers.",

Acute administration of Intralipid to anesthetized rats increased both triglycerides and free fatty acids, associated with a simultaneous increase in total pancreatic and islet blood flow. A preceding abdominal vagotomy markedly potentiated this and led acutely to a 10-fold increase in islet blood flow associated with a similar increase in serum insulin concentrations.

Our study primarily aimed for further depiction of the signaling receptors involved in MT mediated pigment translocations in the fish. Melanophore Size Index (MSI) was employed as a recording parameter for the responses of melanophores to MT and various antagonists. MT has induced aggregation as well as dispersion in D-L region and aggregation in band region melanophores during summer season. During winter, MT-induced responses were only of aggregatory type in D-L region, while in the band region there was an increase in the sensitivity. The responses of the melanophores to MT were reversible. The aggregation of innervated melanophores induced by MT on the D-L and band regions was partially mediated through the neurotransmitters released under the influence of MT and partially by the specific MT receptors. Luzindole and K185 have completely blocked the aggregatory responses of D-L and band region melanophores. Aggregatory receptors may be of the conventional \u03b1-MT type.

The present study investigated the effects of the beta-blocker sotalol (SOT) at 3 environmentally relevant concentrations on life-history traits of the New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Based on the pharmacodynamic properties of SOT, the authors hypothesized reduced numbers of embryos in the brood pouches, decelerated growth of adult snails, and smaller size of neonates, but no effect on mortality rates of adults. Contrary to the hypothesis, the total number of embryos was significantly higher after 56 d of exposure at nominal concentrations of 0.05\u2009\u00b5g/L and 1.0\u2009\u00b5g/L by 107% and 73%, respectively. No differences in embryo numbers were observed at earlier time-points. Therefore, the mode of action seems to be an extension of the reproductive period rather than an increase of the embryo production. Furthermore, our results indicate a hormetic dose-response relationship, because no effects were observed at the highest test-concentration (6.5\u2009\u00b5g/L). Mortality, growth of adult snails, and neonate sizes were not affected by the beta-blocker. Given the strong influence on reproduction, the effects of sublethal concentrations of SOT and other beta-blockers deserve better consideration in ecotoxicological risk assessment.",

Forty-two rats were pretreated with AT (1.5 mg \u00b7 kg(-1)), 0.9% saline solution (SS; 0.1\u00a0mL), or IPC and then subjected to prolonged occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery for 60 minutes leading to I followed or not by 120 minutes of R, according to the group. For IPC, 5 minutes of I prior to 10 minutes of R were established. After this process of I or I-R, the right lung of each animal was adequately prepared for staining with hematoxylin and eosin and subsequent histologic analysis for quantification of inflammatory infiltrate was done. The left lung was frozen and prepared for assessment of oxidative stress by the quantification of thiobarbituric acid-reactivity substances (TBARS). Histologic analysis showed an important inflammatory infiltrate in the I-R\u00a0+ SS (I-R\u00a0+ SS\u00a0= 4.5), which was significantly (P\u00a0< .05) reduced by IPC (I-R\u00a0+ IPC\u00a0= 3.0) or AT (I-R\u00a0+ AT\u00a0= 3.0).

    "68": "The \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist Propranolol has been successfully used to treat infantile hemangioma. However, its mechanism of action is so far unknown. The hypothesis of this research was that \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists may interfere with endothelial cell differentiation of stem cells. Specifically, the effects of the non-specific \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-adrenoceptor) antagonist Propranolol, the \u03b21-adrenoceptor-specific antagonist Atenolol and the \u03b22-adrenoceptor-specific antagonist ICI118,551 on vasculogenesis of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were investigated. All three \u03b2-blockers dose-dependently downregulated formation of capillary structures in ES cell-derived embryoid bodies and decreased the expression of the vascular cell markers CD31 and VE-cadherin. Furthermore, \u03b2-blockers downregulated the expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165), VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) and phospho VEGF-R2, as well as neuropilin 1 (NRP1) and plexin-B1 which are essential modulators of embryonic angiogenesis with additional roles in vessel remodelling and arteriogenesis. Under conditions of \u03b2-adrenoceptor inhibition, the endogenous generation of nitric oxide (NO) as well as the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was decreased in embryoid bodies, whereas an increase in NO generation was observed with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP). Consequently, vasculogenesis of ES cells was restored upon treatment of differentiating ES cells with \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists in the presence of NO donor. In summary, our data suggest that \u03b2-blockers impair vasculogenesis of ES cells by interfering with NO generation which could be the explanation for their anti-angiogenic effects in infantile hemangioma.",

It has been detected at concentrations ranging from ng L(-1) to low \u03bcg L(-1) in waste and surface waters. The present study aimed to assess the sub-lethal effects of atenolol on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and to determine its tissue-specific bioconcentration. Juvenile rainbow trout were exposed for 21 and 42 days to three concentration levels of atenolol (1 \u03bcg L(-1) - environmentally relevant concentration, 10 \u03bcg L(-1), and 1000 \u03bcg L(-1)). The fish exposed to 1 \u03bcg L(-1) atenolol exhibited a higher lactate content in the blood plasma and a reduced haemoglobin content compared with the control. The results show that exposure to atenolol at concentrations greater than or equal to 10 \u03bcg L(-1) significantly reduces both the haematocrit value and the glucose concentration in the blood plasma. The activities of the studied antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) were not significantly affected by atenolol exposure, and only the highest tested concentration of atenolol significantly reduced the activity of glutathione reductase. The activities of selected CYP450 enzymes were not affected by atenolol exposure. The histological changes indicate that atenolol has an effect on the vascular system, as evidenced by the observed liver congestion and changes in the pericardium and myocardium. Atenolol was found to have a very low bioconcentration factor (the highest value found was 0.27). The bioconcentration levels followed the order liver>kidney>muscle. The concentration of atenolol in the blood plasma was below the limit of quantification (2.0 ng g(-1)). The bioconcentration factors and the activities of selected CYP450 enzymes suggest that atenolol is not metabolised in the liver and may be excreted unchanged.",

Although randomized studies have found that sotalol can significantly delay time to AF recurrence, its association with mortality is less clear, particularly among those with coronary artery disease. We examined outcomes of 2,838 patients with coronary artery disease and AF. Using Cox proportional hazards modeling, landmark analysis, and time-dependent covariates for drug therapy, we compared cumulative survival among patients treated with sotalol (n\u00a0= 226), amiodarone (n\u00a0= 856), or no AAD (n\u00a0= 1,756). Median follow-up was 4.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2.0-7.4). The median age was 68 years (IQR 60-75). Compared with those treated with amiodarone or no AAD, patients treated with sotalol were less likely to be black (6% vs 13% vs 13%) and have a previous myocardial infarction (35% vs 51% vs 48%) or a left ventricular ejection fraction <40% (13% vs 26% vs 21%). In follow-up, persistence of sotalol was limited; 97% of patients treated with sotalol were treated for <25% of the follow-up period. In adjusted analysis accounting for time on therapy, sotalol use was associated with an increased risk of all-cause death compared with no drug (hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.96, p\u00a0= 0.0009), but a decreased risk of death compared with amiodarone (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.91, p\u00a0= 0.0141). In conclusion, sotalol therapy was more frequently used in patients with fewer co-morbidities, often discontinued early in follow-up, and was associated with increased mortality compared with no AAD but\u00a0decreased mortality relative to amiodarone.", 
    "76": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy resulting from the deposition of misfolded amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptide in the walls of brain's blood vessels is exhibited by the majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, suggesting that alterations in protein quality control contribute to AD-associated vascular dysfunction. The present work addressed the role of ER stress in the amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and subsequent A\u03b2 generation in brain endothelial cells (ECs). For that purpose, the RBE4 cell line was exposed to the classical ER stressors thapsigargin or brefeldin A to mimic the altered ER homeostasis observed in AD. In treated cells, an increase in the levels of markers of ER stress (XBP1 and GRP78) and of the ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway (caspase-12, JNK, and CHOP) was observed concomitantly with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Under these conditions, a significant ER-to-mitochondria Ca(2+) transfer was also found, which culminated in mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload and activation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, it was showed that prolonged ER stress induces intracellular APP accumulation, which colocalizes with the ER chaperone GRP78, and activation of \u03b2-secretase, leading to increased intracellular A\u03b2 levels, together with a decrease in secreted A\u03b2. Finally, it was demonstrated that ER stress-induced changes in A\u03b2 levels and apoptotic cell death can be ameliorated by a blocker of the mitochondrial Bax channel. These observations suggest that chronic ER stress triggers APP accumulation in early comportments along the secretory pathway in brain ECs and increases its amyloidogenic processing and A\u03b2 generation leading to apoptotic cell death.", 
    "77": "In a previous research, we described that vagal stimulation increases the infarct size by sympathetic co-activation. The aim of this study was to determine if hemodynamic changes secondary to the vagal stimulation are able to activate sympathetic compensatory neural reflexes, responsible for increasing the infarct size. A second goal was to determine if intermittent vagal stimulation avoids sympathetic activation and reduces infarct size by muscarinic activation of the Akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3 \u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) pathway. Rabbits were subjected to 30 min of regional myocardial ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion without vagal stimulation, or the following protocols of right vagus nerve stimulation for 10 min before ischemia: (a) continuous vagal stimulation and (b) intermittent vagal stimulation (cycles of 10 s ON/50 s OFF). Continuous vagal stimulation increased the infarct size (70.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3 %), even after right vagal section (68.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 %) compared with control group (52.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7 %, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Bilateral vagotomy, pacing, and esmolol abolished the deleterious effect, reaching an infarct size of 43.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1, 43.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1, and 46.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6 % (p\u2009<\u20090.05), respectively. Intermittent stimulation reduced the infarct size to 29.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0 % (p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs I/R). This effect was blocked with atropine (50.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6 %, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Continuous vagal stimulation induced bradycardia and increased the loading conditions and wall stretching of the atria. These changes provoked the co-activation reflex of the sympathetic nervous system, observed by the rise in plasmatic catecholamine levels, which increased the infarct size. Sympathetic co-activation was abolished by continuous vagal stimulation with constant heart rate or parasympathetic deafferentation. Intermittent vagal stimulation attenuated the sympathetic tone and reduced the infarct size by the muscarinic activation of the Akt pathway and GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition. Continuous stimulation only phosphorylated Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 when esmolol was administered.",

In a post hoc analysis, we compared the baseline population characteristics of both dexpramipexole studies and analyzed EMPOWER efficacy outcomes and laboratory measures in subgroups defined by significant inter-study differences. Results showed that, compared with phase II, the proportion of El Escorial criteria (EEC) definite participants decreased (p = 0.005), riluzole use increased (p = 0.002), and mean symptom duration increased (p = 0.037) significantly in EMPOWER. Baseline creatinine (p < 0.001) and on-study creatinine change (p < 0.001) correlated significantly with ALSFRS-R in EMPOWER. In the EMPOWER subgroup defined by EEC-definite ALS, riluzole use, and < median symptom duration (15.3 months), dexpramipexole-treated participants had reduced ALSFRS-R slope decline (p = 0.015), decreased mortality (p = 0.011), and reduced creatinine loss (p = 0.003). In conclusion, significant differences existed between the phase II and EMPOWER study populations in ALS clinical trials of dexpramipexole. In a post hoc analysis of EMPOWER subgroups defined by these differences, potential clinical benefits of dexpramipexole were identified in the subgroup of riluzole-treated, short-symptom duration, EEC-definite ALS participants.

The modified multiwalled CNT samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results of analyses showed that CNTs were successfully cross-linked with 2HP-\u03b2-CD. To evaluate the enantio-separation property of the products, the separation of metoprolol chiral forms on the initial and final products was examined.

Moreover, the optimal mass of adsorbent as well as optimal mass of functional groups is estimated to achieve maximum enantio-separation efficiency.

The other is that Chinese individuals reacted to propranolol differently from American Whites. Whether the difference of sensitivity is due to the \u03b2 adrenoceptor (\u03b2-AR) expression pattern of hemangioma initiating cells remains unclear. In the present study, we isolated hemangioma-derived stem cells (hemSCs) from proliferative IHs and analyzed the biological characteristics and \u03b2-AR expression pattern of hemSCs by immunostaining, Western blotting and multilineage differentiation assay as well. We also tested the effects of propranolol on hemSCs by evaluating VEGF expression, proliferation and apoptosis related parameters. Our results indicated that CD133(+) hemSCs located pre-vascular in proiferative IH tissues. Both \u03b21 and \u03b22-AR were expressed, while \u03b22-AR was dominant on hemSCs. Propranolol at 100-150 \u03bcM inhibited proliferation of hemSCs, not did 50 \u03bcM. Propranolol down-regulated VEGF expression of hemSCs, instead of inducing apoptosis. The adipogenic potential was enhanced by propranolol. Therefore, our current results suggested propranolol could not induce apoptosis of hemSCs, but played a curative role though suppressing VEGF synthesis and enhancement of adipogenesis of hemSCs. Our results might partially provide the insight of mechanism of relapse in some cases on cessation of propranolol treatment.",

However, propranolol treatment also led to improper induction of PPAR\u03b4 and suppression of C/EBP\u03b1, RXR\u03b1, and RXR\u03b3. Taken together these data indicate that propranolol promoted dysregulated adipogenesis and inhibited the HemSCs from becoming functional adipocytes, ultimately resulting in cell death. Understanding this mechanism behind propranolol's effectiveness will be a vital factor in producing more effective therapies in the future.",

    "134": "Astrocytes modulate synaptic transmission via release of gliotransmitters such as ATP, glutamate, D-serine and L-lactate. One of the main problems when studying the role of astrocytes in vitro and in vivo is the lack of suitable tools for their selective activation. Optogenetic actuators can be used to manipulate astrocytic activity by expression of variants of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or other optogenetic actuators with the aim to initiate intracellular events such as intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) and/or cAMP increases. We have developed an array of adenoviral vectors (AVV) with ChR2-like actuators, including an enhanced ChR2 mutant (H134R), and a mutant with improved Ca(2+) permeability (Ca(2+) translocating channelrhodopsin, CatCh). We show here that [Ca(2+)]i elevations evoked by ChR2(H134R) and CatCh in astrocytes are largely due to release of Ca(2+) from the intracellular stores. The autocrine action of ATP which is released under these conditions and acts on the P2Y receptors also contributes to the [Ca(2+)]i elevations. We also studied effects evoked using light-sensitive G-protein coupled receptors (opto-adrenoceptors). Activation of opto\u03b11AR (Gq-coupled) and opto\u03b22AR (Gs-coupled) resulted in astrocytic [Ca(2+)]i increases which were suppressed by blocking the corresponding intracellular signalling cascade (phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase, respectively). Interestingly, the bulk of [Ca(2+)]i responses evoked using either optoAR was blocked by an ATP degrading enzyme, apyrase, or a P2Y1 receptor blocker, MRS 2179, indicating that they are to a large extent triggered by the autocrine action of ATP. We conclude that, whilst optimal tools for control of astrocytes are yet to be generated, the currently available optogenetic actuators successfully initiate biologically relevant signalling events in astrocytes.",

The adrenergic and glucocorticoid systems are involved in postnatal maturation of pathways related to energy metabolism and calves show elevated plasma concentrations of cortisol and catecholamines during perinatal life. We tested the hypothesis that hepatic glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and \u03b1\u2081- and \u03b2\u2082-adrenergic receptors (AR) in neonatal calves are involved in adaptation of postnatal energy metabolism and that respective binding capacities depend on colostrum feeding. Calves were fed colostrum (CF; n=7) or a milk-based formula (FF; n=7) with similar nutrient content up to d 4 of life. Blood samples were taken daily before feeding and 2h after feeding on d 4 of life to measure metabolites and hormones related to energy metabolism in blood plasma. Liver tissue was obtained 2 h after feeding on d 4 to measure hepatic fat content and binding capacity of AR and GR. Maximal binding capacity and binding affinity were calculated by saturation binding assays using [(3)H]-prazosin and [(3)H]-CGP-12177 for determination of \u03b1\u2081- and \u03b2\u2082-AR and [(3)H]-dexamethasone for determination of GR in liver. Additional liver samples were taken to measure mRNA abundance of AR and GR, and of key enzymes related to hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. Plasma concentrations of albumin, triacylglycerides, insulin-like growth factor I, leptin, and thyroid hormones changed until d 4 and all these variables except leptin and thyroid hormones responded to feed intake on d 4. Diet effects were determined for albumin, insulin-like growth factor I, leptin, and thyroid hormones. Binding capacity for GR was greater and for \u03b1\u2081-AR tended to be greater in CF than in FF calves. Binding affinities were in the same range for each receptor type. Gene expression of \u03b1\u2081-AR (ADRA1) tended to be lower in CF than FF calves. Binding capacity of GR was related to parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism, whereas \u03b2\u2082-AR binding capacity was negatively associated with glucose metabolism.

    "149": "Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside that acts via G-protein coupled receptors. In vertebrates, arterial or venous adenosine injection causes a rapid and large bradycardia through atrioventricular node block, a response mediated by adenosine receptors that inhibit adenylate cyclase and decrease cyclic AMP concentration. Chronic developmental hypoxia has been shown to alter cardioregulatory mechanisms in reptile embryos, but adenosine's role in mediating these responses is not known. We incubated snapping turtle embryos under chronic normoxic (N21; 21\u00a0% O2) or chronic hypoxic conditions (H10; 10\u00a0% O2) beginning at 20\u00a0% of embryonic incubation. H10 embryos at 90\u00a0% of incubation were hypotensive relative to N21 embryos in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia caused a hypotensive bradycardia in both N21 and H10 embryos during the initial 30\u00a0min of exposure; however, f H and P m both trended towards increasing during the subsequent 30\u00a0min, and H10 embryos were tachycardic relative to N21 embryos in hypoxia. Following serial \u22651\u00a0h exposure to normoxic and hypoxic conditions, a single injection of adenosine (1\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1)) was given. N21 and H10 embryos responded to adenosine injection with a rapid and large hypotensive bradycardia in both normoxia and hypoxia. Gene expression for adenosine receptors were quantified in cardiac tissue, and Adora1 mRNA was the predominant receptor subtype with transcript levels 30-82-fold higher than Adora2A or Adora2B. At 70\u00a0% of incubation, H10 embryos had lower Adora1 and Adora2B expression compared to N21 embryos. Expression of Adora1 and Adora2B decreased in N21 embryos during development and did not differ from H10 embryos at 90\u00a0% of incubation. Similar to previous results in normoxia, H10 embryos in hypoxia were chronically tachycardic compared to N21 embryos before and after complete cholinergic and adrenergic blockade. Chronic hypoxia altered the development of normal cholinergic and adrenergic tone, as well as adenosine receptor mRNA levels. This study demonstrates that adenosine may be a major regulator of heart rate in developing snapping turtle embryos, and that chronic hypoxic incubation alters the response to hypoxic exposure.",

    "155": "Carvedilol is a novel \u03b2-adrenoreceptor blocker, with antioxidant properties inhibiting lipid peroxidation and preventing the depletion of endogenous antioxidants. Moreover, carvedilol was reported to enhance the expression of Bcl-2 gene, which has antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects. There are few researches testing the protective effect of carvedilol on the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and nephropathy. In this study, we induced diabetes mellitus in male Wistar albino rats. We investigated carvedilol, as well as vitamin E, administrated in healthy and diabetic rats for 6 weeks to compare their effects on biochemical parameters and the expression of Bcl-2 protein in both myocardial and renal tissues by immunohistochemistry. The study showed that the diabetic rats not only had renal dysfunction and more myocardial damage, but also showed lower expression of Bcl-2 protein. Carvedilol and vitamin E treatments were associated with better renal function and less myocardial damage, lower blood glucose, and lipid peroxidation, higher antioxidant capacity, better serum lipids, and higher expression of Bcl-2 protein in diabetic rats. These results indicate that carvedilol and vitamin E treatments partly protect against myocardial and renal damage probably via their antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties in diabetic rats.",

    "158": "S-esmolol at half the rate (\u03bcg kg min) of RS-esmolol provided the same degree of HR control over all infusion rates. RS-esmolol lowered BP by 3, 6, 11, 20, and 38 mmHg at 90, 300, 600, 1,000, and 2,000 \u03bcg kg min, compared with 2, 4, 5, 10, and 16 mmHg at 45, 150, 300, 500, and 1,000 \u03bcg kg min for S-esmolol. Decreased BP with RS-esmolol was attributed to decreases in left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) (-34 mmHg), LVdP/dt+max (-702 mmHg/s), and cardiac output (-1 l/min). R-esmolol also decreased BP (-10 mmHg), LVDP (-10 mmHg), LVdP/dt+max (-241 mmHg/s), and cardiac output (to -0.2 l/min). S-esmolol reversed these trends toward pre-esmolol values by increasing BP (+13 mmHg), LVDP (+12 mmHg), LVdP/dt+max (+76 mmHg/s), and cardiac output (+0.4 l/min).",

    "160": "A few studies in animals and humans suggest that metoprolol (\u03b21-selective adrenoceptor antagonist) may have a direct antiatherosclerotic effect. However, the mechanism behind this protective effect has not been established. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of metoprolol on development of atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice and investigate its effect on the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Male ApoE(-/-) mice were treated with metoprolol (2.5 mg/kg/h) or saline for 11 weeks via osmotic minipumps. Atherosclerosis was assessed in thoracic aorta and aortic root. Total cholesterol levels and Th1/Th2 cytokines were analyzed in serum and macrophage content in lesions by immunohistochemistry. Metoprolol significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque area in thoracic aorta (P < 0.05 versus Control). Further, metoprolol reduced serum TNF\u03b1 and the chemokine CXCL1 (P < 0.01 versus Control for both) as well as decreasing the macrophage content in the plaques (P < 0.01 versus Control). Total cholesterol levels were not affected. In this study we found that a moderate dose of metoprolol significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque area in thoracic aorta of ApoE(-/-) mice. Metoprolol also decreased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and CXCL1 and macrophage content in the plaques, showing that metoprolol has an anti-inflammatory effect.", 
    "161": "High-performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) was utilized to examine the binding of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) with drugs, using R/S-propranolol as a model. These studies indicated that two mechanisms existed for the binding of R- and S-propranolol with VLDL. The first mechanism involved non-saturable partitioning of these drugs with VLDL, which probably occurred with the lipoprotein's non-polar core. This partitioning was described by overall affinity constants of 1.2 (\u00b10.3)\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6)\u00a0M(-1) for R-propranolol and 2.4 (\u00b10.6)\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6)\u00a0M(-1) for S-propranolol at pH\u00a07.4 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The second mechanism occurred through saturable binding by these drugs at fixed sites on VLDL, such as represented by apolipoproteins on the surface of the lipoprotein. The association equilibrium constants for this saturable binding at 37\u00a0\u00b0C were 7.0 (\u00b12.3)\u2009\u00d7\u200910(4)\u00a0M(-1) for R-propranolol and 9.6 (\u00b12.2)\u2009\u00d7\u200910(4)\u00a0M(-1) for S-propranolol. Comparable results were obtained at 20 and 27\u00a0\u00b0C for the propranolol enantiomers. This work provided fundamental information on the processes involved in the binding of R- and S-propranolol to VLDL, while also illustrating how HPAC can be used to evaluate relatively complex interactions between agents such as VLDL and drugs or other solutes.",

N-type Ca(2+) channels (NCCs) play an important role in sympathetic nervous system activation by regulating the calcium entry that triggers release of neurotransmitters from peripheral sympathetic nerve terminals. We have investigated the ability of NCC blockade to prevent lethal arrhythmias associated with heart failure.",

In this mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy leading to sudden arrhythmic death, cardiac structure and function did not significantly differ among the control, cilnidipine, and nitrendipine groups. However, cilnidipine dramatically reduced arrhythmias in dnNRSF-Tg mice, significantly improving their survival rate and correcting the imbalance between cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity. A \u03b2-blocker, bisoprolol, showed similar effects in these mice. Genetic titration of NCCs, achieved by crossing dnNRSF-Tg mice with mice lacking CACNA1B, which encodes the \u03b11 subunit of NCCs, improved the survival rate. With restoration of cardiac autonomic balance, dnNRSF-Tg;CACNA1B(+/-) mice showed fewer malignant arrhythmias than dnNRSF-Tg;CACNA1B(+/+) mice.",

In competition radioligand binding studies at human recombinant receptors, GSK-961081 displayed high affinity for hM2 (Ki = 1.4 nM), hM3 muscarinic receptors (Ki = 1.3 nM) and h\u03b22-adrenoceptors (Ki = 3.7 nM). GSK-961081 behaved as a potent h\u03b22-adrenoceptor agonist (EC50 = 0.29 nM for stimulation of cAMP levels) with 440- and 320-fold functional selectivity over h\u03b21- and h\u03b23-adrenoceptors, respectively. In guinea pig isolated tracheal tissues, GSK-961081 produced smooth muscle relaxation through MA (EC50 = 50.2 nM), BA (EC50=24.6 nM), and MABA (EC50 = 11 nM) mechanisms. In the guinea pig bronchoprotection assay, inhaled GSK-961081 produced potent, dose-dependent inhibition of bronchoconstrictor responses via MA (ED50 = 33.9 \u00b5g/ml), BA (ED50 = 14.1 \u00b5g/ml), and MABA (ED50 = 6.4 \u00b5g/ml) mechanisms. Significant bronchoprotective effects of GSK-961081 were evident in guinea pigs via MA, BA, and MABA mechanisms for up to 7 days after dosing. The lung selectivity index of GSK-961081 in guinea pigs was 55- to 110-fold greater than that of tiotropium with respect to systemic antimuscarinic antisialagogue effects and was 10-fold greater than that of salmeterol with respect to systemic \u03b22-adrenoceptor hypotensive effects. These preclinical findings studies suggest that GSK-961081 has the potential to be a promising next-generation inhaled lung-selective bronchodilator for the treatment of airway diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

TCM usually occurs following a variety of emotional stressors, but physical stressors can also trigger the condition, as highlighted by the present case. TCM can occur after an acute medical illness; therefore, physicians should be aware of this condition as a potential cause of inotrope-resistant hypotension. In patients with hypotension and moderate-to-severe left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, inotropic agents should be avoided, because they can worsen the degree of obstruction. Instead, beta-blockers are preferred, because they are capable of resolving the obstruction and consequently improve the haemodynamics.",

In 72.5% of patients (37 eyes) the average IOP was almost 3 times lower than at the baseline and achieved target values (15-17 mm Hg), thus allowing to avoid surgical intervention. In 27.5% of patients (14 eyes), despite a significant decrease of IOP, surgical treatment was considered still necessary due to glaucoma progression and, therefore, drainage surgery was performed.",

    "175": "Application of electrical field to the heart during the refractory period of the beat has been shown to increase the force of contraction both in animal models and in heart failure patients (cardiac contractility modulation, or CCM). A direct increase in intracellular calcium during CCM has been suggested to be the mechanism behind the positive inotropic effect of CCM. We studied the effect of CCM on isolated rabbit cardiomyocytes and perfused whole rat hearts. The effect of CCM was observed in single cells via fluorescent measurements of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and cell length (L). Cells were paced once per second throughout these recordings, and CCM stimulation was delivered via biphasic electric fields of 20 ms duration applied during the refractory period. CCM increased the peak amplitude of both [Ca(2+)]i and L for the first beat during CCM compared to control, but then [Ca(2+)]i and L decayed to levels lower than the control. During CCM, all contractions had a faster time to peak for both [Ca(2+)]i and L; after stopping CCM the rise times returned to control levels. In the whole rat heart, the positive inotropic effect of CCM stimulation on left ventricular pressure was completely abolished in the presence of metoprolol, a beta-1 adrenergic blocker. In summary, the CCM-induced changes in intracellular calcium handling by cardiomyocytes did not explain the sustained positive inotropic effect in the whole heart and the \u03b2-adrenergic pathway may be involved in the CCM mechanism of action.", 
    "176": "The prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the brain is crucial for memory. Norepinephrine elicits an important influence on mPFC functions. The stimulation of \u03b2-adrenoceptors (\u03b2-ARs) may play a critical role in the consolidation of long-term memory. The present study examines the possible role of \u03b2\u2081-ARs located in the mPFC on morphine-induced amnesia in rats. The animals were bilaterally implanted with chronic cannulas in the mPFC, trained in a step-through-type passive avoidance task and tested 24 h after training to measure step-through latency. Our present results indicated that posttraining intraperitoneal administration of morphine (2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced the step-through latency. Different doses of xamoterol (0.01, 0.1 and 1 \u00b5g/rat) have shown no significant change in the step-through latency, but posttraining intra-mPFC microinjection of atenolol (0.2 and 0.4 \u00b5g/rat) had an amnesic effect. Moreover, atenolol-caused amnesia was reversed by an ineffective dose of xamoterol (0.1 \u00b5g/rat). On the other hand, coadministration of an ineffective dose of atenolol (0.1 \u00b5g/rat) with an ineffective dose of morphine (2.5 mg/kg) induced an amnesic effect. Meanwhile, xamoterol had no effect on morphine-induced amnesia. These results suggest that \u03b2\u2081-ARs of the prelimbic region in the mPFC may play an important role in morphine-induced amnesia.",

Epidemiological studies demonstrate a relevant association between heart rate and survival in individuals without diagnosed cardiovascular disease and with cardiovascular disease like hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. Whereas a goal directed pharmacological heart rate reduction is not supported by clinical evidence for primary prevention it plays a prognostic role for patients with CAD\u200a and chronic heart failure. Moreover heart rate can be characterized as an independent risk factor for patients with heart failure and potentially for those with CAD.

Similarly, early pharmacological management can modulate the pathophysiological alterations after cardiac surgery, leading to an improvement in the early and long-term outcome.

Several therapies are currently available to treat this chronic illness; however, clinical response to these treatment options exhibit significant interpatient variation. It is now clearly understood that genetics is a key contributor to diversity in therapeutic response, and evidence that genetic polymorphisms alter the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical response of heart failure drugs continues to accumulate. This suggests that pharmacogenomics has the potential to help clinicians improve the management of heart failure by choosing the safest and most effective medications and doses. Unfortunately, despite much supportive data, pharmacogenetic optimization of heart failure treatment regimens is not yet a reality. In order to attenuate the rising burden of heart failure, particularly in the context of the recent paucity of new effective interventions, there is an urgent need to extend pharmacogenetic knowledge and leverage these associations in order to enhance the effectiveness of existing heart failure therapies. This review focuses on the current state of pharmacogenomics in heart failure and provides a glimpse of the aforementioned future needs.",

Multivariate regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis that exposure to a care management intervention increased the likelihood of having the appropriate medication or procedures performed, as well as increased medication persistency. Statistically significant clinical metric improvements occurred in each of the 5 conditions studied. Increased medication persistency was found for beta-blocker medication for members with coronary artery disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker and diuretic medications for members with heart failure, bronchodilator and corticosteroid medications for members with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and aspirin/antiplatelet medications for members with diabetes.
