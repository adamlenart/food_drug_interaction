The fact that this stimulation is not inhibited by a beta-blocker (propranolol) and that the stimulation by prostaglandin E2 and adrenaline is additive indicates that each drug acts independently on the epidermal adenyl cyclase system. In other words, prostaglandins E1 and E2 act on a site other than the beta-receptor of adenyl cyclase in epidermis. The stimulation by prostaglandins E1 and E2 is not additive; hence they probably act on the same site. Concentrations of prostaglandin E above 3X10(-7) M are effective in causing stimulation. This concentration may be within the physilogical range and the contribution of endogenous prostaglandin levels in the control of intracellular cyclic AMP levels cannot be disregarded.", 
    "1": "Beta-Phenylethylamine on injection into mice produced both an early and late phase of increased locomotor activity. The early phase produced by 50 mg phenylethylamine/kg was inhibited by pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine, alpha-methyl-tyrosine, diethyldithiocarbamate, pimozide and haloperidol, but not by propranolol, protriptyline and reserpine. The late phase produced by 100 mg phenylethylamine/kg was blocked only by pimozide and haloperidol, both of these in doses at least ten times higher than those required to block the early phase. From these results it was concluded that the increased early phase of locomotor activity was due to the release of dopamine and noradrenaline synthetic pathway, but not intact reserpine sensitive amine stores. In contrast the late phase of locomotor activity was independent of catecholamine stores and appeared to be produced by a direct action by either phenylethylamine or metabolites on dopamine receptors.", 
    "2": "In short-term incubations of fat cells isolated from human adipose tissue, noradrenaline (0.2-2x10--5 M), a mixed alpha and beta-adrenergic agonist, stimulated only slightly cyclic AMP accumulation. In the presence of the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent phentolamine (0.05-5mug/ml), noradrenaline markedly augmented the amount of labelled cyclic nucleotide. The stiumlatory effect of noradrenaline and noradrenaline plus phentolamine was abolished by propranolol (0.1-10 mug/ml). Theophylline (10--4-10--3 M) slightly increased the (3-H) cyclic AMP levels per se and magnified the stiumulatory action of other agents, but did not mimic the potentiating effect of phentolamine on noradrenaline action.", 
    "3": "The effects of several cyclic nucleotide analogs and of phosphodiesterase inhibitors on the release of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity (DBH) by electrical stimulation were studied in the isolated, perfused cat spleen. N-6-butyryl-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (mbcAMP), 8-methylthio-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate, 8-bromo-3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) and two potent phosphodiesterase inhibitors: 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine and 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxy-benzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (Ro 20-1724) enhanced the overflow of NE and total H and reduced pressure responses elicited by nerve stimulation. A concomitant outflow of DBH activity was observed in the presence of mbcAMP, 8-Br-cGMP or Ro 20-1724. Synergistic effects on the nerve stimulation-mediated overflow of NE and DBH were obtained with low concentratons of Ro 20-1724 and mbcAMP (5 muM). Adenosine 5'-monophosphate produced a very slight increase in nerve stimulated release of NE and DBH activity in concentrations which inhibited pressor responses considerably. cAMP produced slight inhibition of pressure responses but failed to influence the release of either NE or DBH activity during nerve stimulation. In contrast to the enhanced overflow of NE and DBH activity induced by nerve stimulation, with the exception of Ro 20-1724, the spontaneous release of these substances was not modified by any of the cyclic nucleotide analogs or phosphodiesterase inhibitors examined. This effect of Ro 20-1724 can probably be explained by the ability of this compound to inhibit the activity of monoamine oxidase and therefore reduce the formation of deaminated metabolites. The present results suggest that cyclic nucleotides are not directly responsible for the release of the adrenergic neurotransmitter, but may facilitate the normal process of release by nerve stimulation. Phentolamine, a blocker of the alpha adrenergic receptors, produced a marked increase in the nerve stimulation-mediated overflow of NE, total H and DBH activity and inhibited pressure responses. This effect was several times greater than that produced by either cyclic nucleotide analogs or phosphodiesterase inhibitors. In addition, the effect of phentolamine was not modified by prior treatment with 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine or Ro 20-1724, suggesting that the effect of phentolamine is not related to its ability to inhibit phosphodiesterase and is probably not mediated via an increase in cAMP.", 
    "4": "The effects of the gastrointestinal hormones secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK) were investigated on rat portal-vein mechanical activity. Doses of 0.03-0.60 units/ml Boots secretin; 0.18-0.60 units/ml pure, natural secretin; and 0.12-0.60 units/ml CCK elicited dose-dependent decreases in amplitude and simultaneous increases in frequency of spontaneous contractions that were unaffected by alpha-or beta-adrenergic or cholinergic blocdade. These effects were mimicked by isoproterenol, theophylline, and cyclic AMP, and all agents tested were also effective in reducing K-or norepinephrine-induced tension. Additionally, subthreshold doses of CCK and secretin elicited responses when given in combination, and the effects of the hormomes at all doses were potentiated by theophyline, indicating an interaction berween these hormones on rat portal vein thatmay involve cyclic AMP. It is suggested that part of the mechanism of hormone-induced mesenteric vasodilatation may involve a direct relaxing effect of the hormones on vascularsmooth muscle.", 
    "5": "A deep inspiration from functional residual capacity to total lung capacity, performed at a low flow rate by a group of 40 unselected adult patients with asthma, yielded an immediate and transient increase (71 per cent, P smaller than 0.001) in specific airway resistance. In 2 of the 40, deep inspiration provoked an attack of asthma. The effect of deep inspiration can be attributed to a vagal bronchoconstrictor reflex, because it was prevented or decreased in most of the cases by inhalation of an anticholinergic drug. Beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol potentiated in a minority of subjects the bronchoconstrictor response to deep inspiration. Deep expiration also induced a bronchoconstrictor effect, which was weaker than that of deep inspiration. It follows that functional studies of asthmatics may be biased if the technique requires maximal respiratory maneuvers.", 
    "6": "Morphine in intravenous doses ranging from 10 mug/kg to 8 mg/kg was shown to be effective in stimulating GH release in the unanesthetized rat. The response to the log of the dose was linear over a range of 10 to 1000 mug/kg. Somatostatin (GH-release inhibiting factor) administered SC in a dose of 200 mug/kg 5 min before morphine prevented the GH rise. Neither inhibitors of catecholamine or serotonin synthesis nor blockage of alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors had any effect on the response. The response was partially blocked in animals with large hypothalamic ventromedial (VMN) lesions. Such lesions completely abolished the GH response to pentobarbital. These results indicate that morphine is a remarkably potent agent for stimulation of GH release but the precise mechanism and site of action of the drug remain to be determined.", 
    "7": "Forty-two patients with angina pectoris have completed a randomized, double-blind trial comparing tolamolol 100 mg and 200 mg with propranolol 80 mg, practolol 100 mg, and placebo, all given three times a day. Tolamolol 200 mg thrice daily was found to be equivalent to propranolol 80 mg thrice daily in anti-anginal efficacy. Anginal attack rates and trinitrin consumption were significantly reduced by all active treatments as compared with the placebo but tolamolol and propranolol were the most effective. Tolamolol 200 mg thrice daily was most effective in reducing blood pressure, while propranolol was most effective in reducing the resting heart rate. All treatments except the placebo significantly increased the amount of exercise which could be performed before angina appeared (exercise work), while tolamolol 200 mg thrice daily significantly reduced Robinson's index when compared with all other active agents. The degree of S-T segment depression induced by exercise was significantly lessened by both tolamolol and propranolol but not by practolol or placebo. There was no difference in patient preference between tolamolol and propranolol but tolamolol at both dose levels was preferred to practolol. Both tolamolol and propranolol are potent adrenergic beta-receptor antagonists and equal in anti-anginal efficacy but tolamolol has the advantage of being cardioselective. It is superior to practolol.", 
    "8": "Thyroid storm was observed in a patient with Grave's disease after stimulation of release of epinephrine and norepinephrine with 2-DG. Measurements of catecholamine secretion before and during onset of thyrotoxic crisis suggested the important bearing of increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system on pathogenesis of thyroid storm.", 
    "9": "[3-H]Epinephrine binding to isolated purified rat liver plasma membranes is a reversible process. An initial peak in binding occurs at about 15 min and a plateau occurs by 50 min. Optimal binding occurred at a membrane protein concentration of 125mug. Rat liver plasma membranes stored at-70 degrees C up to 4 weeks showed no difference in epinephrine binding capacity as compared to control fresh membranes. Epinephrine binding to liver plasma membranes was decreased by 79% by phospholipase A2 (phosphatide acylhydrolase EC 3.1.1.4), 81% by phospholipase C (phosphatidylcholine choline phosphohydrolase EC 3.1.4.3) and 59% by phospholipase D (phosphatidylcholine phosphatidohydrolase EC 3.1.4.4). Trypsin and pronase digestion of the membrane decreased epinephrine binding by 97 and 47% respectively. In the presence of 10-3M Mg-2+ ions, increasing concentrations of QTP decreased epinephrine binding to liver plasma membranes. A maximal effect was demonstrated with 10-5M GTP, representing an inhibition of 52% of the control. In a Mg-2+ -free system, epinephrine binding was unaffected by GTP. However, in a Mg-2+ -free system, increasing concentrations of ATP cause increasing inhibition of hormone binding. ATP at 10-3 M reduced epinephrine binding to 28% of the control. GRP (10-5 M) was shown to inhibit epinephrine uptake rather than epinephrine release from the membrane. [3-H]Epinephrine binding to isolated rat epididymal fat cells shows an initial peak within 5 min followed by a gradual rise which plateaus after 60 min. Epinephrine binding increased nearly linearly with increasing fat cell protein concentration (40-200 mug protein). GTP (10-5 M) and ATP (10-4 M) decreased epinephrine binding to rat epididymal fat cells by 41%. Nearly complete inhibition of binding was demonstrated with 10-2-10-3M ATP. Epinephrine analogs that contain two hydroxyl groups in the 3 and 4 position on the benzene ring act as inhibitors of [3-H]epinephrine binding to rat adipocytes. Alteration of the epinephrine side chain has relatively little influence on binding. Analogs in which one of the ring hydroxyl groups is missing or methylated are poor inhibitors of [3-H]epinephrine binding. Alpha-(phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine) and beta-(propranolol and dichorisoproterenol) adrenergic blocking agents were tested with respect to their ability to influence [3-H]epinephrine binding and their influence on epinephrine-stimulated lipolysis. Only dichloroisoproterenol significantly inhibited epinephrine binding (by 25%). The two beta-adrenergic blocking agents caused an inhibition of epinephrine-stimulated glycerol release, with propranolol being most effective. Phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine had no significant effect on the epinephrine stimulation of glycerol release by fat cells.", 
    "10": "Isoproterenol plus guanylyl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) activate frog erythrocyte adenylate cyclase to a level much higher than the sum of the activities produced by the catecholamine and the synthetic nucleotide tested separately. Propranolol, the beta-receptor blocking agent, failed to inhibit activity when added after the enzyme system had been preincubated with both isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p. However, if propranolol was added after only one of the two components had been added, it inhibited the effect of isoproterenol. Production of the propranolol-resistant state by treatment with isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p did not require the presence of the productive substrate (MgATP). The activated propranolol-resistant state persisted following various treatments of the enzyme preparation including extensive washings of the membranes; considerable activity was retained even after sonication or treatment with the detergent Lubrol-PX, treatments which caused inactivation of the native enzyme. Extensive dilution of the membranes following pretreatment with isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p did not significantly reduce to the activity of the enzyme. Readdition of isoproterenol after dilution caused some inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, indicating apparently that the beta-receptor has not become inaccessible. In contrast, preincubation with isoproterenol alone failed to render the enzyme system refractive to propranolol, and dilution readily reduced the activity to negligibly low values. Preincubation with Gpp(NH)p alone also produced a persistent active state but the activity was much lower than that obtained throught the combined action of isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p. The findings suggest that the hormone may be required only to facilitate the initial interaction of the enzyme with Gpp(NH)p. The differences, in this respect, between Gpp(NH)p and the more labile natural nucleotide, GTP, are discussed.", 
    "11": "Isolated kidney cortex tubules from starved rats have been used to study the actions of catecholamines on renal adenosine 3':5' monophosphate (Ado-3':5'-P) levels and gluconeogenesis. In accordance with previous workers, norepinephrine was found to increase glucose formation from lactate and pyruvate and to a smaller degree from malate, succinate, fumarate and glutamine. The stimulatory effect of 0.5 muM norepinephrine was additive to that of 0.1 mM Ado-3':5-P, indicating an Ado-3':5'-P-independent mechanism of catecholamine action. The effects of parathyroid hormone and oleate on gluconeogenesis were also additive to that of norepinephrine. A comparative study of the actions of different catecholamine derivatives revealed that gluconeogenesis was stimulated in parallel to the alpha-adrenergic potency of the hormones, whereas Ado-3':5'-P levels were increased according to the known beta-stimulatory potency of the agents. Although isoproterenol was by far the most effective in raising Ado-3':5'-P levels, it was without effect on glucose formation from pyruvate, when added at 0.1 muM. At the same concentration, phenylephrine, which had no effect on Ado-3':5'-P levels, was the best stimulator of gluconeogenesis. The alpha-receptor blocking agent phentolamine inhibited the stimulatory effect of catecholamines on gluconeogenesis with a 50 times higher potency than propranolol, a beta-blocking agent. The fact that the stimulatory effect of Ado-3':5'-P was also blocked by propranolol, indicated an unspecific mechanism of action of this substance. The results indicate that the stimulatory effect of catecholamines on renal gluconeogenesis are mediated by an alpha-receptor and that they are independent from the stimulation of renal adenyl cyclase by these agents.", 
    "12": "Keratoconjunctivitis sicca, conjunctival scarring, fibrosis, metaplasia, and shrinkage developed in 27 patients as an adverse reaction to practolol. Rashes, nasal and mucosal ulceration, fibrous or plastic peritonitis, pleurisy, cochlear damage, and secretory otitis media also occurred in some cases. Three patients suffered profound visual loss though most retained good vision. Symptoms and signs improved on withdrawal of the drug, but reduction of tear secretion persisted in most patients.", 
    "13": "An antibody which sticks to the intercellular region of xenogenic epidermal tissue has been shown by indirect immunofluorescence to be present in the serum of patients with practolol-induced eye damage. These antibodies and those found in patients with pemphigus were compared for their ability to bind to isolated epidermal cells. Binding was achieved only with the pemphigus antibody, which suggests that it may have a different specificity from the antibody associated with practolol-induced eye damage.", 
    "14": "Experience in a hypertension clinic attended by 591 patients over a 13-year period has shown marked changes in the pattern of use of hypotensive agents. Thiazides have been used throughout the period in almost all cases. Methyldopa was used for most patients for almost a decade. Since 1967 there has been a steady increase in the use of beta adrenergic blocking agents, and these are now used for over 60% of patients attending the clinic. Combination beta adrenergic blocking agents with peripheral vasilodators such as hydrallazine and prazosin have provided a very effective means of controlling the blood pressure in moderate and severe hypertension. Prazosin, a new peripheral vasodilator, has been used in the treatment of 295 patients. In most cases it has been used in combination with a thiazide diuretic and beta adrenergic blocking agent. Open studies have demonstrated that this is an effective hypot .ensive agent. Side effects are few and are counteracted by combination with a beta adrenergic blocking agent. Prazosin and hydrallazine are being compared in double-blind studies.", 
    "15": "The effect of propranolol on certain insulin-induced metabolic changes in man. The effects of 0.2 mg/kg/body weight propranolol perfused in 10' on insulin-induced (0.15 I.U./Kg i.v.)changes in blood glucose, pyruvate, lactic acid, phosphorus, and potassium levels were examined in 12 normal volunteers. The blood glucose curve was substantially unaffected. Insulin-induced increases in lactate and pyruvate were inhibited to a varying degree, namely 78% (61-93%) and 44% (0.94%) respectively. The fall in phosphorus was reduced in a more constant manner (mean 48; range 37-57%) in all subjects, while that of potassium was not altered. The data indicate that these insulin-induced changes are significantly, though variably, attributable to beta-adrenergic activity on the part of endogenous catecholamines released during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia.", 
    "16": "1. The cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase in homogenates of the submaxillary gland and pancreas was found to be associated mainly with the 300,000 times g supernatant fraction. A Lineweaver-Burk plot showed a high-affinity (Km app. = 1.6 muM) and a low-affinity (Km app. greater than 100muM) component for the cyclic AMP substrate. The enzyme was magnesium dependent, and strongly inhibited by papaverine, theophylline and caffeine. Cyclic GMP inhibited cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, but only in concentrations greatly exceeding that of the cyclic AMP. Calcium did not alter the activity of the enzyme. The activity of the submaxillary cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase was not influenced by noradrenaline, dopamine, histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine or gamma-amino butyric acid, and that of the pancreatic enzyme by acetylcholine, pancreozymin or secretin. 2. Adenylate cyclases from guinea-pig submaxillary gland and cat pancreas are particulate enzymes. The highest specific activity was recovered from the 1500 times g pellet. Guineo-pig submaxillary adenylate cyclase was activated by fluoride, noradrenaline, isoprenaline and adrenaline. The noradrenaline activation was blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, but not by the alphs-adrenoceptor blocker, phentolamine. Neither acetylcholine nor carbachol had any effect on the adenylate cyclase activity. The apparent Km value for the 10- minus 4 M noradrenaline activated adenylate cyclase activity was completely aboliched by 5 mM calcium. Cat pancreatic adenylate cyclase was clearly and consistently activated by secretin, but not by pancreozymin or carbachol.", 
    "17": "A comparison of antiarrhythmic activity of substances (stimulation of the heart with electric current and measuring the duration of the refractory peroid) as against their local anesthetic properties (the eye cornea of the rabbit and the ischiatic nerve of the frog) proved the existence of a close correlation between the ability of substances to abolish arrhythmia, caused by an electric stimulation of the heart, and their capacity to produce a conduction anesthesia in the ischiatic nerve of a decapitated frog.", 
    "18": "To determine the roles of portal circulation and the hepatic arteries during states of shock, the authors studied on 38 dogs, the effects of 30 minutes clamping of the sub-diaphragmatic part of the inferior vena cava, the portal vein and the hepatic artery, either together or successively. They measured the pressure in these various vessels, the transhepatic flow, using Xenon133, and calculated the intra-hepatic resistance. The animals were then treated with Tham, isoprenaline and propanolol. Tolerance to clamping was improved significantly when the animals were treated with the association of these drugs. The portal pressure and the systemic arterial pressure, rapidly returned to normal. This was also the case with hepatic, venous or arterial blood flow. There was a remarkable stability between the sinusoidal and biliary resistances, compared with disturbances in control groups. The already well known beneficial effect of Tham was increased by the apparently paradoxical association of isoprenaline and propranolol. In fact, with this dosage, they counter-balanced their reciprocal disadvantages. Finally, a study of blood flow and vascular resistance in the liver, suggests the existence of two components in splanchnic shock, hepatic and visceral.", 
    "19": "A possible role of the autonomic nervous system in the left ventricular response to acute regional myocardial ischemia was sought in conscious dogs instrumented for measurement of left ventricular pressure, internal diameter, and aortic flow. Ischemia produced by occluding the left circumflex coronary artery caused tachycardia and reduced contractility. Changes during control occlusions were compared with those during occlusion.s after beta-adrenergic blockade, parasympathetic blockade, and combined sympathetic and parasymphatetic blockade. Beta-blockade did reduce the tachycardia and slightly reduced left ventricular diameter changes in response to coronary occlusion. Results obtained in animals following surgical cardiac sympathectomy indicated reduced tachycardia and no effects on other parameters. The principal effect of parasympathetic blockade was to augment the increase in end diastolic diameter during occlusion Right atrial pacing indicated this change was due to higher initial heart rates. Combined parasympathetic and sympathetic blockade did not alter inotropic responses to coronary occlusion. Results indicated that inotropic support due to changes in activity in autonomic nerves is not increased during acute occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery.", 
    "20": "An examination of 25 patients with hypertensive disease of the I-II stage proved that following propranolol treatment the systolic and mean arterial pressure, the rate of cardiac contractions and the minute blood volume accrue on physical effort to a lesser extent, and the circulation time, diastolic pressure and peripheral resistance ot the blood flow-to the same degree as before the medication. Changes in the phasic structure of the left ventricle of the heart in physical exertion are less marked than they were prior to the treatment. Propranolol does not materially change the level of the oxygen consumption on effort; the lactic acid level and the ratio lactate/pyruvate in the blood rise against the background of the medication with this drug to a some-what lesser degree than before the treatment.", 
    "21": "Respiratory and cardiovascular reflexes have been elicited from receptors in the nose and larynx in the anaesthetized dog. Cigarette smoke in the nose causes reflex apnoea, bradycardia and vasoconstriction, probably due to systemic absorption through the nose. Stimulation of laryngeal nerve also results in reflex apnoea, bradycardia, and limb vasoconstriction. When asphyxia supervenes due to apnoea, stimulation of the carotid body chemoreceptors occurs which normally cause, as primary effects, hyperpnoea and bradycardia. However, it has been shown that stimulation of the laryngeal receptors inhibits the carotid body respiratory reflex and facilitates the carotid body cardio-inhibitory reflex, the latter leading to temporary cardiac arrest. The clinical implications of this finding are discussed.", 
    "22": "Some sympatholytic agents have been tested for the ability to counteract either the hepatotoxic or the lethal effect of A. phalloides in rats. Propranolol displayed a marked preventive action on the liver damage induced by the poison, but only a moderate influence on the lethality. Reserpine was uneffective in terms of liver derangement, but exerted some protection against the general toxic effect of A. phalloides. Other alpha- or beta-adrenolytic compounds failed to afford any significant protection with respect to both liver injury and lethality. It is suggested that propranolol might interfere with transport or binding of phallotoxins to the liver.", 
    "23": "Several agents used clinically in the treatment of angina pectoris were studied in an atherosclerotic rabbit model previously shown to be useful in differentiating antianginal drug activity. Intravenously administered isosorbide dinitrate afforded protection against pacing-induced S-T segment depression in a dose-related manner. Drugs with no protective effect included pentaerythritol tetranitrate, chromonar, and papaverine. Propranolol also did not prevent pacing-induced S-T segment depression, due in part to the overriding of the beneficial negative chronotropic effect of this drug by pacing.", 
    "24": "In our attempt to find an anesthetic agent which did not influence the renin-angiotensin system in the rat, the effect of widely used injectable and gaseous anesthetics and narcotic agents on renin release was chacterized. All of the agents studied induced dose- and time-related increases in serum renin activity when administered in anesthetic doses. Preliminary experiments in anesthetic doses. Preliminary experiments indicated that cardiovascular effects were highly variable, giving little insight into the relationship between renin release and cardiovascular changes. Propranolol impaired most of the anesthesia-induced renin release and impaired aldosterone release with the one agent (urethane) studied. Renin release by two anesthetic agents (ketamine and urethane) appeared to be mediated premarily through the beta-adrenermediated primarily through the beta-adrenergic receptor mechanism, but equivocal results were obtained with other agents (pentobarbital and morphine). It is possible that other anesthetics, as with urethane, may induce aldosterone release by way of renin release. This anesthesia-induced renin release and the extensive biologic activities of angiotensin and aldosterone suggest a potential for influencing many investigations, particularly those involving cardiovascular and endocrine systems.", 
    "25": "The influence of amantadine on the contractile responses of the rat uterus to oxytocin in the presence of several ionic modifications of the external medium was studied both in situ and in vivo. Oxytocic effects of amantadine were observed in vivo (1 and 5 mg/kg), and in vitro (9.3 times 10-7 M to 2.8 times 10-6 M); possible competitive partial potentiation of the contractile effect of oxytocin was also observed. Amantadine, 9.35 times 10-6, 1.3 times 10-5 and 1.8 times 10-5 M, significantly reduced oxytocic activity. Calcium ions antagonized the oxytocic and antioxytocic effects of amantadine. Excess K+ and the presence of Mg2+ ions (1.8 mM/l and 1.08 mM/l respectively) reversed the antioxytocic effect of amantadine. Propranolol also reversed the antioxytocic effect of amantadine. It is postulated that the oxytocic effect of amantadine may be related to antagonism of calcium; antioxytocic activity may be explained by stabilization of the resting cell membrane, inhibiting ionic flow, and also by its catecholamine-liberating activity.", 
    "26": "LSD and BOL were found to be equally potent in increasing the rat brain DOPA accumulation after decarboxylase inhibition. However, at the doses selected, the DOPA levels after haloperidol and apomorphine were increased by LSD but not by BOL. It is suggested that this difference is due to LSD's activating effect on central serotoninergic receptors.", 
    "27": "The cardiovascular effects of dopamine (DA) were studied in anesthetized dogs with special attention to the susceptibility of these effects to inhibition by catecholaminergic receptor blocking drugs. Dopamine given by rapid i.v. injection at 1 and 3 mug/kg produced depressor responses whereas doses from 9 to 81 mug/kg produced pressor resposes and increases in cardiac contractile force. Propranolol inhibited the increases in cardiac contractility whereas phenoxybenzamine potentiated the depressor effect of low doses of DA and reversed the pressor effect of high doses. Bulbocapnine blocked the depressor effect of DA in both phenoxybenzamine and propranolol-treated dogs. Pimozide, however, had no effect on the depressor response to DA. In hemodynamic studies, DA reduced blood pressure, total peripheral resistance and renal vascular resistance. Cardiac output and renal blood flow were increased. Bulbocapnine, but not pimozide, abolished the effects of DA on blood pressure, vascular resistance and renal blood flow. In conscious dogs, pimozide abolished apomorphine-induced emesis (an effect mediated by DA receptors in the central nervous system) whereas bulbocapnine had no effect. Therefore, the peripheral vascular and central dopamine receptors may be pharmacologically distinct.", 
    "28": "The influence of the nervous system on the response of the coronary vessels to ischemia was evaluated by observing the reactive hyperemia subsequent to a 10 second occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery in 19 awake dogs. Sympathectomy produced by pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine, chronic total surgical cardiac denervation, beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, and alpha blockade with phentolamine did not significantly after the reactive hyperemic response. Thus cardiac denervation did not impair the ability of the coronary vasculature to respond to a brief ischemic stimulus.", 
    "29": "A constant pressure perfusion of the sinus node artery was performed in 10 in situ and in 3 isolated SA node preparations. The selective administration of apomorphine caused a negative chronotropic effect which was not blocked by treatment with atropine. The sinus deceleration was usually produced by apomorphine, 10-300 mug, while sinus irregularity and finally atrioventricular nodal rhythm in the in situ preparation or sinus arrest in the isolated one resulted from doses above 1 mg. In the in situ preparation at a higher dose from 300 mug to 1 mg, a slight sinus acceleration was occasionally induced following sinus deceleration; In this time, a fall in blood pressure was usually observed; This acceleration response to apomorphine was inhibited by propranolol. From these results, it is concluded that apomorphine induces direct depressive action on the SA node and, in extremely high doses, a slight sinus acceleration may be induced by reflex mechanism.", 
    "30": "To study ionic effects on hypothalamic control of feeding, seven sheep were each prepared with six bilateral medial-hypothalamic guides. Hypothalamic loci were identified where feeding resulted following 1 mu 1 injections of calcium chloride and/or magnesium chloride. Doses of 1 and 2 mumol were most effective to induce feeding, and potassium chloride was not effective. Injections of phentolamine, LB-46, carbachol, atropine, or prostaglandin E1 did not inhibit the feeding responses following magnesium chloride injections into magnesium ion responsive loci. Feeding following calcium chloride injections into calcium ion responsive loci was blocked by atropine and reduced by phentolamine. Carbachol and prostaglandin E1 elicited feeding when injected into magnesium but not calcium ion responsive loci. Injections of carbachol followed by magnesium chloride resulted in greater feeding than when either chemical was injected alone. Calcium and/or magnesium ion bound feeding loci were in the anterior, ventromedial, dorsomedial, posterior and lateral hypothalamus, and the mammillary bodies. These ions elicited feeding in sheep perhaps by decreasing excitability of feeding-inhibitory neural pathways in the hypothalamus.", 
    "31": "Blood oxytocin was determined on 10 Holstein cows during normal milking and during milking when epinephrine was injected intravenously before or after udder stimulation. The average peak oxytocin concentration during normal milking was 399.7 muU/ml plasma and was reached at 1 min after teat cup application. Oxytocin concentration in blood plasma declined rapidly after peak concentration and dropped to 30.5 muU/ml plasma within 4 min after the start of milking. By 5 min after removal of the teat cups, it had declined to less than 4 muU/ml plasma. The administration of epinephrine, either before or after udder washing, inhibited milk ejection as indicated by milk production and oxytocin concentrations. Peak oxytocin concentrations were 1.05 muU/ml plasma 1 min after teat cup application when epinephrine was injected before udder washing and 8.6 muU/ml plasma at teat cup application when epinephrine was injected after udder washing. These results and the use of a beta receptor blocker to inhibit the effect of epinephrine at the myoepithelial cell level indicated that epinephrine inhibited release of oxytocin from the neurohypophysis.", 
    "32": "We have used a continuous intravenous infusion of glucose (6 mg/kg/min), insulin (80 mU/min), epinephrine (6 mug/min), and propranolol (0.08 mg/min) to directly assess insulin resistance in 14 untreated adult onset diabetics with a mean (plus or minus SE) fasting plasma glucose level of 217 plus or minus 17 mg/100 ml. During the infusion endogenous insulin secretion is inhibited and steady-state plasma glucose and insulin levels are achieved after 90 min. Since similar steady-state levels of plasma insulin are achieved in all subjects, the plasma glucose concentration observed during the steady-state period is a measure of an individual's insulin resistance. Under these conditions, the mean (plus or minus SE) steady-state plasma glucose level of the 14 diabetic patients was 350 plus or minus 16 mg/100 ml, while that of 12 normal subjects was 121 plus or minus 4 mg/100 ml. Additional studies were performed in which control subjects and patients with diabetes had their fasting plasma glucose levels acutely raised or lowered to comparable levels before receiving the basic infusion mixture of glucose, insulin, epinephrine, and propranolol. The results of these studies indicated that differences in initial plasma glucose levels could not account for the different glucose responses of the two groups to the basic infusion. Finally, the mean (plus or minus SE) steady-state plasma glucose level of 104 plus or minus 17 mg/100 ml observed during the same basic infusion in five patients with fasting hyperglycemia (mean plus or minus SE, 142 plus or minus 12 mg/100 ml) secondary to chronic pancreatitis suggested that neither chronic hyperglycemia nor hypoinsulinemia per se necessarily lead to insulin resistance. These results demonstrate that marked insulin resistance exists in adult onset diabetics with fasting hyperglycemia. Since previous studies have documented the presence of insulin resistance in patients with chemical diabetes, the possibility exists that insulin resistance may be characteristic of adult onset diabetes mellitus.", 
    "33": "The effect of posterior hypothalamic stimulation on cardiac susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation (VF) was studied in 34 dogs. VF threshold was determined by inducing a sequence of early extrasystoles (R/T pulsing). Hypothalamic stimulation was associated with sinus tachycardia, systemic hypertension, and a 40% reduction in VF threshold. The effects of hypothalamic stimulation on the VF threshold persisted when heart rate acceleration and the pressor response were prevented. Cervical vagotomy and bilateral adrenalectomy were likewise without effect on fibrillation threshold changes. However, the decrease in threshold was abolished by beta-adrenergic blockade. It is concluded that the reduction in VF threshold associated with hypothalamic stimulation derives from the direct action of sympathetic nerves upon the myocardium, rather than from secondary hemodynamic effects.", 
    "34": "Contractions of rabbit testicular capsules in vitro and in vivo in response to prostaglandin F2a, epinephrine, and acetylcholine were measured in the presence of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Contractions induced by these agents were markedly inhibited at 10-7 M concentrations of PGE1 in both preparations. Even so, lower levels of PGE1 (10-8 or 10-9 M) potentiated epinephrine- or acetylcholine-induced stimulation of increased tonus in vovo. Epinephrine, PGE1, and PGF2a caused increased tonus and contractions in vitro and in vovo; however, acetylcholine stimulated the testicular capsule much more in vivo than in vitro. The control log dose-response curve for epinephrine stimulation showed a slight decrease in the upper concentration range. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, more than overcame this decrease and also prevented a theophylline inhibition of epinephrine-induced contraction. Prostaglandin E1's bimodal effect gives it the ability to modulate testicular contractions by increasing stimulation by other agonists in vovo at low concentrations of PGE1 but inhibiting it at higher concentrations. Thus PGE1 is a potential regulator of testicular capsular motility and possibly sperm transport and hemodynamics.", 
    "35": "Spectral analysis was used to investigate variations of heart period in 13 decerebrate cats under different conditions of neural input to the heart. Spectral density plots in intact animals showed three well-defined peaks: P1 (1.5-2.5 cycles/min), P2 (6-10 cycles/min), and P2 (respiratory frequency). In the presence of sympathetic input only the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased; when only vagal input was present the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were increased and there was no change in P3; when neither sympathetic nor vagal input was present the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased. In addition, the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were increased and there was no change in P3; when neither sympathetic nor vagal input was present the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased. In addition, the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were found to be significantly correlated with the mean heart period under the condition of vagal control only. It is concluded that P3 is related to sinus arrhythmia and that P1 and P2 may be related to spontaneous rhythms that are an intrinsic feature of the dynamic regulation of heart period by the vagus system. Sympathetic activity plays no role in the genesis of these rhythms.", 
    "36": "The objectives of this study were to describe in greater detail the initial rise and spontaneous decline in acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and to investigate a number of mechanisms that could have caused this secondary vasodilation. With the onset of isocapnic hypoxia (Pao2 of 28, 44, or 56 mmHg), pulmonary vascular resistances increased to maximum values at 3 min and then spontaneously declined toward control values. Pulmonary perfusion pressures rose to maxima at approximately 4 min and then also declined. During severe hypoxic exposures (Pao2 of 30-37 mmHg) this secondary vasodilation was found not to be due to beta-adrenergic-induced vasodilation, withdrawal of alpha-adrenergic-induced vasoconstriction, vasodilation caused by a sustained increase in pulmonary blood flow, fatigue of the vascular smooth muscle contractile mechanism, or release of vasodilatory prostaglandins. It is suggested that the decline in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction may be due to an exhaustion of a chemical mediator, release of a pulmonary vasodilator agent, or myogenic stress relaxation.", 
    "37": "An abrupt reduction of medium osmolarity by as little as 20 mosM evoked a discrete short-lived insulin secretory response from perifused chopped pancreas or isolated islets. The insulin response occurred earlier than that induced by either glucose or tolbutamide. None of the usual modifiers of insulin secretion significantly altered this secretory response. Glycolytic inhibitors, adrenergic agonists and blocking agents, cholinergic blocking agents, mitotic spindle inhibitors, and agents influencing sodium pump activity failed to alter hyposmolar-induced insulin secretion. Manipulation of the perifusion medium calcium concentration was the only procedure tested that influenced the secretory response. Perturbations of medium calcium concentration that increased the tissue-to-medium calcium gradient augmented the hyposmolar-induced insulin response and those that decreased tissue-to-medium calcium gradient greatly inhibited the response. The precise cause of the insulin response to a decrease in bathing fluid osmolarity remains undefined; however, the stimulus is not specific for insulin because increases in glucagon and amylase were also elicited by the hyposmolar stimulus.", 
    "38": "The uterine and cardiovascular responses to the adrenergic beta2-receptor stimulator terbutaline (TRB) were investigated in 14 patients in normal term labor. TRB, administered intravenously at a rate of 10 to 20 mug per minute, effectively inhibited uterine activity in advanced labor and also expulsion. Intravenous injection of TRB, 250 mug, diminished oxytocin-induced uterine hyperactivity. No serious side effects of the drug were observed; the circulatory effects were minimal, except for a tolerable maternal tachycardia. The mode of action and clinical application of TRB for inhibition of unwanted uterine activity are discussed.", 
    "39": "Dose-responses curves were established in 10 normal subjects by measuring, with a body plethysmograph, the changes of specific airway conductance (SGaw) produced by aerosolized acetylcholine. Doses of acetylcholine producing a 50 per cent decrease of control SGaw (ED50) were found to be largely variable among individuals. Beta-adrenergic blockade with intravenous propranolol (0.2 mg per kilogram) resulted in a mean potentiation of the acetycholine effect (mean ED50 after propranolol was significantly lower than mean ED50 before). This potentiating effect of propranolol, however, was also subjected to individual variations, suggesting individual variability of the sympathetic system. The range of variation in acetylcholine sensitivity was not narrowed by propranolol treatment and no correlation was found between initial acetylcholine sensitivity and propranolol potentiation. This suggests that variability of the sympathetic system is not the main factor in determining individual variation in acetylcholine sensitivity. Even when propranolol was very effective in increasing airway sensitivity, this sensitivity was still less marked than usually encountered in asthmatic patients. This suggests that beta-adrenergic blockade cannot create, if alone, the bronchial hypersensitivity characteristic of asthma.", 
    "40": "Ten patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) (group 1) and five patients with combined COLD and cardiac disease (group 2) were studied at rest and during exercise after an intravenous (IV) slaine control followed by IV propranolol (0.2 mg/kg). During rest propranolol did not alter significantly measurements of lung volume in groups 1 or 2. Following propranolol the mean airway resistance (AR) in group 1 increased from 4.49 to 5.2 cm H2O/L/sec (P smaller than 0.02) and airway conductance (Gaw) decreased from 0.28 to 0.24 L/sec-1 cm. H2O1 (P smaller than 0.02). In group 2 following propranolol, the mean AR increased from 3.60 to 4.67 cm H2O1 (P smaller than 0.05), and Gaw decreased from 0.30 to 0.23 L/sec-1/cm H2O1 (P smaller than 0.05). During exercise, from control to propranolol, the heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate blood pressure (HR x BP) decreased significantly for both groups 1 and 2 except for the systolic pressure in group 2. The duration of exercise and exercising PO2 were not significantly altered from control to propranolol in groups 1 and 2, indicating that the small but statistically significant changes in AR and Gaw did not interfere with symptom tolerated maximal exercise in these patients and were therefore not clinically important.", 
    "41": "Recent evidence has suggested that cardiac factors may play a role in the evolution of arterial hypertension. To test the possibility that an increase in cardiac-performance can lead to a sustained increase in systemic blood pressure, we electrically stimulated the left stellate ganglion of six conscious dogs continuously for a 7-day period and monitored cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. In all six dogs, stimulation elicited an abrupt rise in systemic blood pre-sure that was entirely due to rise in cardiac output that lasted at least 6 hours. After 1 day of continuous stimulation, cardiac output retured to control values, but blood pressure remained elevated. After 7 days of stimulation, blood pressure was increased by an average of 25 mm Hg and peripheral resistance by 35 plus and minus 4%. Measurements of blood volume, plasma renin activity, circulating catecholamines (three of the six dogs), and sodium balance showed that none of these factors could explain the development pf this sustained hypertension. Pharmacologic blockade with phenoxybenzamine prevented in large part the rise in blood pressure in short-term stellate ganglion stimulations, whereas propranolol had very little effect on the pressor response, although it nearly abolished the increase in cardiac output. The data indicate that continuous stimulation of the stellate ganglion in conscious dogs leads to substained rises in both blood pressure and peripheral resistance; these changes are apparently mediated by increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "42": "Effects of a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent, 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy) propoxy-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril hydrochloride (OPC-1085), on the coronary circulation and myocardial metabolism were investigated in anesthetized open-chest dogs and isolated perfused dog hearts. In anesthetized open-chest dogs, OPC-1085 antagonized the responses to isoproterenol of heart rate, Vmax, mean blood pressure, myocardial oxygen consumption, coronary blood flow and redox potential. The antagonistic potency of OPC-1085 was stronger than propranolol. OPC-1085 3 to 30 mug/kg caused appreciable decreases, but in doses of 100 to 1,000 mug/kg caused increases in heart rate and Vmax. The effect of OPC-1085 on max dp/dt was similar to that on Vmax. However, propranolol 3 to 3,000 mu-g/kg caused only decreases in heart rate, Vmax and max dp/dt. OPC-1085 3,10 mu-g/kg while propranolol 30, 100 mu-g/kg caused a fall in myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow. In isolated perfused hearts, intracoronary injection of OPC-1085 0.1 mg almost completely suppressed isoproterenol-induced augmentation of heart rate, myocardial contractile force and coronary blood flow and reduction of redox potential. OPC-1085 0.1 mg caused slight increases in heart rate, myocardial contractile force and myocardial oxygen consumption. It is concluded that OPC-1085 is a more potent beta-adrenergic blocking agent than propranolol and possesses a weak negative inotropic effect in doses of 3 to 30 mu-g/kg and a intrinsic sympathomimetic activity in doses of 100 to 1,000 mu-g/kg.", 
    "43": "Experiments were conducted on 200 male albino rats. It was shown that prolonged administration of sympatholytics (ornide or actadine) and also of a blocker of the alpha-adrenorecptors with phentholamine or of beta-adrenoreceptors with inderal led to the accumulation of zinc in the cytoplasm of beta-cells, reduction of the content in them of specific aldehyde-fuchsinophilic granularity, neoformation of the islands of Langerhans and to increase in the animal sensitivity to the exogenous insulin.", 
    "44": "ICI 66082, a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, was found to produce hypoglycaemia in fasted rats. In fed rats a hyperglycaemic response was observed. The drug produced hypoglycaemia in fed adrenalectomised animals. The hypoglycaemic response to ICI 66082 was accompanied by elevations in plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI) concentrations. The drug also reduced plasma glucose and increased IRI in moderately alloxan-diabetic rats. In severely diabetic animals The drug did not increase IRI concentrations and did not unequivocally lower plasma glucose concentrations. In vitro experiments showed ICI 66082 to increase glucose uptake by rat diaphragm muscle and epididymal adipose tissue. the hypoglycaemic response may be mediated by increases in plasms IRI concentrations with a possible contribution from direct effects of the drug on peripheral glucose utilization. As these responses differ from those published in relation to other beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs it is unlikely that the effects are due to beta-adrenoceptor blockade. However, like other beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs ICI 66082 reduced isoprenaline-mediated increase in plasma IRI.", 
    "45": "Propranolol is able to increase the amount of the titratable groups of mitochondrial membranes. This effect occurs with sonicated particles and with liposomes, too. The phenomenon is only seen in the presence of salt solutions, not in sucrose. Propranolol increases the fluorescence of anilino-naphthalene sulphonate (ANS) in mitochondrial suspensions. The increase is counteracted by increasing concentrations of potassium chloride. It is suggested that the increase of the titratable groups results from a decrease of the aggregation of the phospholipids of the membranes. At the same time the environment of the bound ANS molecules is more hydrophobic in sucrose than in potassium chloride. The amount of the buffering groups and the hydrophilicity are in direct and the amount of the buffering groups and the fluorescence of ANS in inverse correlation.", 
    "46": "Effects of nitroglycerin, dipyridamole, adenosine, reactive hyperemia, propranolol, norepinephrine and sympathetic nerve stimulation on retrograde coronary blood flow were investigated in dogs with experimental coronary occlusion. The retrograde blood flow (RF), pressure and conductance of the occluded left anterior descending coronary artery were measured and compared with the flow (CF), pressure and conductance of the non-occluded circumflex artery. The RF increased during sympathetic nerve stimulation and after the administration of nitroglycerin and norepinephrine, while it decreased during reactive hyperemia and following injection of dipyridamole, adenosine and propranolol. The RF/CF ratio was increased by nitroglycerin and propranolol, whereas it was lowered by dipyridamole and adenosine. The results suggest that nitroglycerin and propranolol may produce a redistribution of myocardial blood flow and that the collateral vessels are little influenced by sympathetic nerve stimulation.", 
    "47": "Clinical, ECG and X-ray data as well as catheterizational and angiographic data on 20 patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis were analysed. The problems of medical and surgical treatment of the disease were discussed. The indications for surgical treatment were defined on the basis of the authors' surgical experience (5 operated on patients) and literature data.", 
    "48": "1. Log dose-response curves to isoprenaline from spontaneously contracting muscle strips from rabbit uterus have been obtained. The effects of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, the beta- adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol and practolol, and (+)-propranolol on the log dose-response curves were studied. 2. Phentolamine 5.3 times 10- minus 7 M had a stimulating effect on the muscle strips, moving the log dose-response curve of isoprenaline to the right. Phenoxybenzamine 2.9 times 10- minus 5 M had no effect on the curves. 3. Propranolol 3.4 times 10- minus 6 M had no effect on the curves from circular muscle strips, with either phentolamine 5.4 times 10- minus 7 M or with phenoxybenzamine 2.9 times 10- minus 5 M as alpha-blocker. The curves from the longitudinal muscle strips were shifted somewhat to the right, the same shift, however, being obtained with (+)-propranolol 3.4 times 10- minus 6 M. 4. Practolol 3.8 times 10- minus 6, 3.8 times 10- minus 5 and 3.8 times 10- minus 4 M was without effect on the curves, either in the circular or in the longitudinal strips. 5. It is concluded that neither propranolol at 3.4 times 10- minus 6 M nor practolol act as beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in oestrogen dominated rabbit uterus. In all other tissues investigated, propranolol or practolol block the effect of isoprenaline. Whether the effect of isoprenaline in this tissue may be termed a beta-effect, is then a question of definition. In addition there is no evidence for any extraneuronal uptake mechanisms for isoprenaline. 6. Variations in sensitivity to beta-stimulation with the time of the year were observed, the sensitivity being greatest in the winter and lowest in the summer.", 
    "49": "Diethyl ether elicited a dose-dependent increase in the intrinsic frequency of contraction of isolated rat atrial preparations. The maximum effect (plus 34 per cent) occurred with 230 mg ether/100 ml medium. This ether concentration corresponds to a partial pressure of 29.2 mm Hg or 3 MAC. The positive chronotropic action of ether was not reduced in atria obtained from rats pretreated with reserpine (4 mg/kg, ip) although this treatment markedly reduced the effect of tyramine on frequency of contraction. The positive chronotropic response to 0.01 muM isoproterenol was inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist 0.3 mgM dl-propranolol but remained unimpaired in the presence of 0.3 mgM d-propranolol (a much weaker antagonist). In contrast, the atrial response to ether was similar in the presence of either d- or dl-propranolol. Atropine, in concentrations that completely blocked the negative chronotropic action of acetylcholine, did not increase the frequency of contraction, suggesting that the positive chronotropic effect of ether is not due to an atropine-like activity of ether. Our results indicate that the positive chronotropic effect of ether on isolated rat atrial preparations is not mediated via catecholamine release, nor does it represent direct stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors or block of cholinergic receptors. (Key words: Anesthetics, volatile, diethyl ether; Heart, atria, diethyl ether.).", 
    "50": "An increase of cAMP/cGMP concentration ratio is the earliest stimulus-coupled biochemical change that has been measured in the adrenal medulla during the trans-synaptic induction of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase [EC 1.14.16.2; L-tyrosine, tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating)]. In adrenal medulla of rats receiving reserpine alone (16 mumol/kg intraperitoneally) or reserpine and propranolol (40 mumol/kg intraperitoneally 30 min before reserpine), or exposed to 4 degrees for 4 hr, the extent and duration of the increase of the cAMP/cGMP concentration ratio exceeds the critical value that is required to activate the protein kinases (EC 2.7.1.37; ATP:protein phosphotransferase). Gel filtration experiments indicate that during this activation, the catalytic subunit of the protein kinase (low-molecular-weight enzyme) is released from the holoenzyme. The activation of protein kinase lasts longer than the increase in the cAMP/cGMP concentration ratio and appears to be an obligatory early event that mediates the increase of tyrosine monooxygenase synthesis. The trans-synaptic induction of the monooxygenase in adrenal medulla appears to be due to an increased synthesis of the enzyme;the rate for monooxygenase degradation is proportional to the number of enzyme molecules that are present at various stages of the induction process.", 
    "51": "Electrical activity of the dog's esophagus was evoked by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve and recorded by using a suction electrode placed on the serosal surface of the esophagus. Neuromuscular blocking agents (d-tubocurarine and succinylcholine) blocked this activity, while atropine had no effect. Hexamethonium (in doses which did not effect neuromuscular transmission in the diaphragm) and high doses of nicotine significantly depressed the evoked esophageal electrical activity, while lower doses of nicotine facilitated the response. The results suggest that a certain proportion of the striated muscle of the esophagus is innervated by processes from the intermediate ganglion cells in the Auerbach plexus.", 
    "52": "The role of adrenergic stimuli in the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in man was evaluated. Intradermal injections of isoproterenol, 0.15 mg, or epinephrine, 0.3 mg, caused significant prompt increases in serum PTH levels. These increases were not accompanied by any changes in serum calcium (Ca) during the period of observation. Phenylephrine, 1.5 mg, intradermally, did not cause any significant changes in serum PTH or serum Ca. Propranolol infusion alone significantly inhibited the basal secretion of PTH. This inhibition by propranolol was overcome by isoproterenol administration. The results indicate that 1) beta adrenergic agents increase PTH secretion whereas alpha adrenergic agents have no effect, 2) beta adrenergic stimuli probably play an important physiological role in basal PTH secretion in man.", 
    "53": "Recent clinical and experimental data on the long Q-T syndrome (LQTS) are presented and discussed. The pathogenesis of LQTS is dependent on an imbalance between various components of the cardiac sympathetic innervation. A congenital decreased activity through the right cardiac sympathetic nerves seems to be the more likely pathogenetic mechanism for the majority of cases. Other forms of sympathetic imbalance, including left or even right hyperactivity, are, however, possible in isolated cases. Beta-blockers, at full blocking dose, represent the therapy of choice and are greatly effective in reducing the mortality (from 73 per cent to 6 per cent). If syncopal attacks are not eliminated by the medical therapy, the the ablation of the left stellate ganglion along with the first thoracic ganglia is the most rational and specific therapy. The possiblity for the correctly diagnosed and treated patients to escape an otherwise impending death calls urgently for diffusion of the knowledge about the long Q-T syndrome.", 
    "54": "Cardiovascular diseases and their treatment in the aged are discussed under the headings of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, cardiac failure (with special reference to the use of diuretics and digoxin), infective carditis and thyroid disorders. Advanced age modifies the approach to treatment; the choice of drugs and the dosage must be adjusted accordingly. Possible drug interactions should also be considered. A rehabilitation program is of great benefit for many elderly cardiac patients. It should be planned individually and involve psychologic and environmental factors as well as medical therapy. After successful treatment of the acute episode, even the aged patient can undertake rewarding activities in his remaining lifetime.", 
    "55": "The relationship between bronchial asthma and the beta adrenergic system is considered both from the physiopathologic and therapeutic point of view. A brief analysis of the sympathetic system is performed. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for bronchodilation mediated through its beta-receptors. To evaluate this activity, beta adrenergic blockers such as propanolol are used. When this agent is administered, a descent of conductance is observed. On this condition, vagal stimulation brings about bronchoconstriction. At bronchial level, it seems that the beta-adrenergic system antagonizes vagal effect. From the physiopathologic point of view, Szentivanyi (1968) suggested a spontaneous beta block in the asthmatic. Other theories refer to a pathologic sensitivity of the peripheral bronchial receptors. The natural beta-adrenergics and the beta-adrenergic drugs enhance the synthesis of cAMP by stimulating the adenil cyclase system. This effect brings about relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle. Considering the therapeutic effects, a comparative study of bronchodilators is performed. From all, Salbutamol has an intense broncholytic effect with little effect on heart dynamics. When sympathomimetics are bound to use in asthma, drugs such as Salbutamol and Terbutalina should be preferred because of its low cardiogenic effects. Its administration per os has rendered doubtful results.", 
    "56": "Slices of human skin obtained with a keratome were pre-incubated with [3H]adenine to label the ATP pool from which cyclic AMP was subsequently formed. The accumulation of radioactive cyclic AMP was measured as an index of adenyl cyclase activity. The data showed that both the ability to incorporate [3H] into ATP and adenyl cyclase activity were significantly lower in psoriatic plaques than in uninvolved skin of the psoriatic patients, or in normal skin of control subjects. The response of adenyl cyclase to the stimulation of 3.3 muM adrenaline was less than five fold in psoriatic plaques as compared to twelve to thirty-two fold in the uninvolved skin. The response to the stimulation of prostaglandin E2 (5 mug/ml) showed no significant difference between the plaque and normal skin. The adenyl cyclase activity in uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients appeared normal. Propranolol (10 muM) blocked the stimulatory effect of adrenaline but not that of PGE2 in normal skin. These results suggest that the adenyl cyclase system of the skin has different regulatory sites for adrenaline and PGE2 and that the enzyme is defective in the epidermis of the psoriatic plaque, especially at the adrenaline regulatory site.", 
    "57": "The cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) content of pig skin was measured several seconds to minutes after removal of the skin from the body. It increased very rapidly, reached a maximum by 2 min after removal (4 times higher than the initial level), then decreased very slowly. Propranolol injected into the animal before or added after the removal of the skin did not suppress this phenomenon. The practical significance of this finding (increase of cyclic AMP level in skin after ischaemia) is obvious-in order to measure cyclic AMP level in vivo, the sample must be frozen immediately to avoid an 'artificial' increase in cyclic AMP."
