Propafenone was administered intravenously as a 2 mg/kg bolus followed by infusion of 0.0078 mg/kg/min for 120 min and orally in dosage of 300 mg three times every 8 hours if arrhythmia persisted. Bisoprolol was administered in a single dose at the very beginning of propafenone treatment and only in patients from group B at a dose of 5 or 10 mg.

    "6": "Achievement of the highest separation efficiency and quick delivery of results are key requirements in liquid chromatography for enhancing productivity and reducing analysis cost, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. This work concerns two of the most popular current solutions to get fast separations: the use of a silica-based monolithic column (Chromolith Performance RP-18e) and a small-particle packed column (1.8-\u03bcm Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18, which needs dedicated instruments allowing higher backpressures). Both columns succeeded in the full separation of phenols and \u03b2-adrenolytic drugs, which are compounds that interact with residual silanols, giving rise to wider peaks. The results were compared with those obtained with a special column designed to avoid silanol interaction, containing 5\u00a0\u03bcm particles (XTerra MS C18). Chromolith gave the shortest times at the expense of higher solvent consumption at the high flow rates needed. In contrast to other studies, comprehensive conclusions on the chromatographic performance, in terms of selectivity, peak shape, resolution, and analysis time, are derived from the inspection of the whole experimental domain using retention and peak shape modelling. In the literature, column comparison is usually carried out based on the performance for selected mobile phases (very often a single one), which offers deceiving results.",

LVRR was noted in 97 (38%) of 253 patients at midterm. The baseline predictors of LVRR were higher systolic blood pressure, QRS duration <120 ms, use of a \u03b2-blocker, and a small indexed LV end-systolic dimension. In landmark survival analysis from the midterm evaluation, LVRR, low midterm NT-proBNP level, and continuous use of a \u03b2-blocker were independently related to good long-term results.",

The notes of patients diagnosed with idiopathic VT in the last 13 years (n: 22) were included in the study. The median age of onset was 11 years (1 month-16 years). We evaluated the findings regarding the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of these patients. The most common initial symptom was palpitation, in 15 cases. Five children with idiopathic VT were symptom-free. VT was of right ventricular origin in 10 patients and left ventricular origin in 8 patients. Beta-blockers were the mainstay of medical treatment in right VT and calcium channel blockers (Ca-channel blocker) were mostly used in left VT cases. The success rate of RFA was 57% in right VT and 100% in left VT. The median follow-up was 41 months (9 months-60 months), and all patients are alive currently with no symptoms. VT without demonstrable cardiac pathology is associated with a good prognosis. Treatment is unnecessary for asymptomatic non-sustained VT.

    "33": "The rank order of PDE families contributing to global cAMP-PDE activity was PDE4> PDE3 \u200a=\u200a PDE1. PDE7 mRNA expression but not activity was confirmed. The Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based cAMP sensor, Epac1-camps, was used to monitor the time course of cytosolic cAMP changes. A pulse application of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor (\u03b2-AR) agonist isoproterenol (Iso) induced a transient FRET signal. Both \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-AR antagonists decreased the signal amplitude without affecting its kinetics. The non-selective PDE inhibitor (IBMX) dramatically increased the amplitude and delayed the recovery phase of Iso response, in agreement with a role of PDEs in degrading cAMP produced by Iso. Whereas PDE1, PDE3 and PDE7 blockades [with MIMX, cilostamide (Cil) and BRL 50481 (BRL), respectively] had no or minor effect on Iso response, PDE4 inhibition [with Ro-20-1724 (Ro)] strongly increased its amplitude and delayed its recovery. When Ro was applied concomitantly with MIMX or Cil (but not with BRL), the Iso response was drastically further prolonged. PDE4 inhibition similarly prolonged both \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-AR-mediated responses. When a membrane-targeted FRET sensor was used, PDE3 and PDE4 acted in a synergistic manner to hydrolyze the submembrane cAMP produced either at baseline or after \u03b2-AR stimulation.", 
    "34": "Our study underlines the importance of cAMP-PDEs in the dynamic control of intracellular cAMP signals in RASMCs, and demonstrates the prominent role of PDE4 in limiting \u03b2-AR responses. PDE4 inhibition unmasks an effect of PDE1 and PDE3 on cytosolic cAMP hydrolyzis, and acts synergistically with PDE3 inhibition at the submembrane compartment. This suggests that mixed PDE4/PDE1 or PDE4/PDE3 inhibitors would be attractive to potentiate cAMP-related functions in vascular cells.",

The present meta-analysis aimed to critically review the current evidence on the efficacy of propranolol in the management of airway haemangiomas, and explore potential adverse events and treatment failures. A literature review was performed in Medline and other available database sources, along with critical analysis of pooled data. Seventeen studies were included in the analysis. No study represented Level I evidence. The total number of treated patients was 61; 14 patients received propranolol as single-treatment. The comparative effectiveness of propranolol vs. systemic steroids was documented in 35 children, and showed superior outcome in the vast majority (94%, p < 0.001). The mean obstruction before propranolol administration was 72%, and after intervention was 20% (p < 0.001). The mean referral-age for children with airway haemangiomas was 2.4 months, the mean starting-age of propranolol treatment was 5.1 months and the mean follow-up period was 8.4 months. Four children failed to respond (6.5%), and in seven the haemangioma relapsed after discontinuation of treatment (11.5%). The results of the present study suggest that propranolol can be recommended for the treatment of airway haemangiomas, as it was found to be effective and outperformed the previously-considered gold standard treatment methods, with fewer side-effects. Immediate treatment with propranolol should be initiated once a diagnosis of symptomatic airway haemangioma is confirmed, and cardiovascular assessment has been performed. Children should remain on propranolol until the haemangioma enters the phase of involution. Active parental monitoring is essential to ensure treatment safety.", 
    "37": "Muscarinic receptors (MR) are main cardioinhibitory receptors. We investigated the changes in gene expression, receptor number, echocardiography, muscarinic/adrenergic agonist/antagonist changes in heart rate (HR) and HR biorhythm in M(2) KO mice (mice lacking the main cardioinhibitory receptors) in the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV). We hypothesize that the disruption of M(2) MR, key players in parasympathetic bradycardia, would change the number of receptors with antagonistic effects on the heart (\u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors, BAR), while the function of the heart would be changed only marginally. We have found changes in LV, but not in RV: decrease in M(3) MR, \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor gene expressions that were accompanied by a decrease in MR and BAR receptor binding. No changes were found both in LV systolic and diastolic function as assessed by echocardiography (e.g., similar LV end-systolic and end-diastolic diameter, fractional shortening, mitral flow characteristics, and maximal velocity in LV outflow tract). We have found only marginal changes in specific HR biorhythm parameters. The effects of isoprenaline and propranolol on HR were similar in WT and KO (but with lesser extent). Atropine was not able to increase HR in KO animals. Carbachol decreased the HR in WT but increased HR in KO, suggesting the presence of cardiostimulatory MR. Therefore, we can conclude that although the main cardioinhibitory receptors are not present in the heart, the function is not much affected. As possible mechanisms of almost normal cardiac function, the decreases of both \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor gene expression and receptor binding should be considered.",

It can be found in 5% of all surgical patients, and it is far more common in cardiac (10% - 65% of patients) than in non-cardiac procedures. In a number of patients it remains asymptomatic, but may be accompanied by very severe symptoms of hypotension, heart failure, syncope, systemic or pulmonary embolism, perioperative myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular insult and increased operative mortality. Patients whose postoperative course is complicated by atrial fibrillation require longer hospitalization. Possible predisposing factors of this arrhythmia are numerous and are associated with surgery, extensive coronary heart disease and revascularization, and preoperative diseases. According to the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology orally applied beta-blocker, amiodarone and sotalol can be used for prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation. Following the recommendations, treatment of postoperative atrial fibrillation should include beta-blockers, amiodarone, and in patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, digoxin. Due to the increased risk of stroke, an anticoagulant protection is necessary. Many studies have been conducted with results supporting the prophylactic use of amiodarone and beta-blockers, while the treatment with new agents such as magnesium, statins, omega-3 fatty acids and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is still being investigated.",

As BG was being explored for the first time for its pharmaceutical application, physicochemical, microbiological, rheological, and stability studies were carried out on this gum. In the present investigation, the physicochemical properties, such as micromeritic, rheological, melting point, moisture content, pH, swelling index, water absorption, and volatile acidity, were evaluated. The gum was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction studies (PXRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Gastroretentive floating tablets of BG were prepared with the model drug propranolol HCl by direct compression methods. The prepared tablets were evaluated for all their physicochemical properties, in vitro buoyancy, in vitro drug release, and rate order kinetics. PBG 04 was selected as an optimized formulation based on its 12-h drug release and good buoyancy characteristics. The optimized formulation was characterized with FTIR, DSC, and PXRD studies, and no interaction between the drug and BG was found.

    "67": "Unexpected induction of arrhythmias in the heart is still one of the major risks of new drugs despite recent improvements in cardiac safety assays. Here we address this in a novel emerging assay system. Eleven reference compounds were administrated to spontaneously beating clusters of cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CM) and the responses determined using multi-electrode arrays. Nine showed clear dose-dependence effects on field potential (FP) duration. Of these, the Ca(2+) channel blockers caused profound shortening of action potentials, whereas the classical hERG blockers, like dofetilide and d,l-sotalol, induced prolongation, as expected. Unexpectedly, two potent blockers of the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Ks)), HMR1556 and JNJ303, had only minor effects on the extracellular FP of wild-type hPSC-CM despite evidence of functional I(Ks) channels. These compounds were therefore re-evaluated under conditions that mimicked reduced \"repolarization reserve,\" a parameter reflecting the capacity of cardiomyocytes to repolarize and a strong risk factor for the development of ventricular arrhythmias. Strikingly, in both pharmacological and genetic models of diminished repolarization reserve, HMR1556 and JNJ03 strongly increased the FP duration. These profound effects indicate that I(Ks) plays an important role in limiting action potential prolongation when repolarization reserve is attenuated. The findings have important clinical implications and indicate that enhanced sensitization to repolarization-prolonging compounds through pharmacotherapy or genetic predisposition should be taken into account when assessing drug safety.",

In the final method, the enantiomers of metoprolol and four stereoisomers of \u03b1-OH-Met were separated using Chiral CBH, the enantiomers of COOH-Met were separated employing Chiral AGP. The analytes were detected in SRM mode by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The method was applied for the chiral analysis of the analytes in treated wastewater samples from Uppsala, Sweden. The enantiomers and diastereoisomers of \u03b1-OH-Met were detected and analyzed in the samples. The concentrations of the three first eluting stereoisomers of \u03b1-OH-Met were between 54 and 61 pM. Interestingly, the last eluting stereoisomer was found to be present at a concentration of 151 pM at the same sampling occasion. This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first time the stereoisomers of \u03b1-OH-Met have been detected in wastewater samples. The enantiomers of metoprolol were determined to be 1.77 and 1.86 nM in the same matrix. The enantiomers of COOH-Met were not detected above the method detection limit (42 pM) in treated wastewater samples. The developed LC-MS/MS methods were validated in wastewater samples.",

Propranolol (40 mg orally) significantly reduced heart rate, but had no effect on self-reported mood. Importantly, propranolol made participants more likely to judge harmful actions as morally unacceptable, but only in dilemmas where harms were 'up close and personal'. In addition, longer response times for such personal dilemmas were only found for the placebo group. Finally, judgments in personal dilemmas by the propranolol group were more decisive. These findings indicate that noradrenergic pathways play a role in responses to moral dilemmas, in line with recent work implicating emotion in moral decision-making. However, contrary to current theorising, these findings also suggest that aversion to harming is not driven by emotional arousal.

The findings suggested better BP control with CCB-diuretic relative to other combinations used.", 
    "107": "Although stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes have great potential for the therapy of heart failure, it is unclear whether their function after grafting can be controlled by the host sympathetic nervous system, a component of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Here we demonstrate the formation of functional connections between rat sympathetic superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons and pluripotent (P19.CL6) cell-derived cardiomyocytes (P19CMs) in compartmentalized co-culture, achieved using photolithographic microfabrication techniques. Formation of synapses between sympathetic neurons and P19CMs was confirmed by immunostaining with antibodies against \u03b2-3 tubulin, synapsin I and cardiac troponin-I. Changes in the beat rate of P19CMs were triggered after electrical stimulation of the co-cultured SCG neurons, and were affected by the pulse frequency of the electrical stimulation. Such changes in the beat rate were prevented when propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, was added to the culture medium. These results suggest that the beat rate of differentiated cardiomyocytes can be modulated by electrical stimulation of connected sympathetic neurons.", 
    "108": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a significant role in metabolism. In this study, we report the use of atomoxetine (a clinically applicable norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) for (18)F-FDG PET imaging of BAT and its effects on heat production and blood glucose concentration. Fasted-male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered with intravenous (18)F-FDG. The same rats were treated with atomoxetine (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) 30 min before (18)F-FDG administration. To confirm the \u03b2-adrenergic effects, propranolol (\u03b2-adrenergic inhibitor) 5 mg/kg was given intraperitoneally 30 min prior to atomoxetine administration. The effect of atomoxetine on BAT metabolism was assessed in fasted and non-fasted rats and on BAT temperature and blood glucose in fasted rats. In (18)F-FDG PET/CT images, interscapular BAT (IBAT) and other areas of BAT were clearly visualized. When rats were fasted, atomoxetine (0.1 mg/kg) increased the (18)F-FDG uptake of IBAT by factor of 24 within 30 min. Propranolol reduced the average (18)F-FDG uptake of IBAT significantly. Autoradiography of IBAT and white adipose tissue confirmed the data obtained by PET. When rats were not fasted, atomoxetine-induced increase of (18)F-FDG uptake in IBAT was delayed and occurred in 120 min. For comparison, direct stimulation of \u03b2(3)-adrenreceptors in non-fasted rats with CL-316, 243 occurred within 30 min. Atomoxetine-induced IBAT activation was associated with higher IBAT temperature and lower blood glucose. This was mediated by inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake transporters in IBAT leading to increased norepinephrine concentration in the synapse. Increased synaptic norepinephrine activates \u03b2(3)-adrenreceptors resulting in BAT hypermetabolism that is visible and quantifiable by (18)F-FDG PET/CT.",

Effects of Iva were compared with those of \u03b2-blockade using metoprolol [(Met), 250 mg/kg/day]. Iva, but not Met, reversed myocardial fibrosis, alone and in combination with MU. MU-induced restoration of deranged E-C coupling was enhanced by Iva to a greater extent than Met: both Iva and Met enhanced the recovery of the Ca(2+) transient amplitude and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content, but Iva alone maintained MU-induced normalization of L-type Ca(2+) current and t-tubule abnormalities. Met prevented MU-induced reduction in the myocardial size (myocardial atrophy); Iva had no effect on this parameter.",

The physico-chemical characterization of nanoemulsions, regarding mean diameter, pH, zeta potential, osmolarity, viscosity and surface tension, underlined their feasibility to be instilled into the eyes. Single components and emulsions were tested ex vivo on rabbit corneas to evaluate corneal irritation, that was measured according to opacity test. A marked decrease in corneal opacity was observed using the drug formulated in nanoemulsions rather than in aqueous solutions. Drug permeation and accumulation studies were performed on excised rabbit corneas. An increase in drug permeation through and accumulation into the corneas were observed using TM-AOT compared to TM due to an increase of lipophilicity of the drug as ion-pair. The introduction of chitosan (a positive charged mucoadhesive polymer) into emulsions allowed to increase TM permeation probably due to the interaction of chitosan with corneal epithelial cells.",

    "125": "Platelet-derived growth factor-CC (PDGF-CC) is the third member of the PDGF family, and has been implicated both in embryogenesis and development of the CNS. The biological function of this isoform however, remains largely unexplored in the context of HIV-associated dementia (HAD). In the present study, we demonstrate that exposure of human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y to HIV transactivator protein Tat resulted in decreased intrinsic expression of PDGF-CC as evidenced by RT-PCR and western blot assays. Reciprocally, pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with PDGF-CC abrogated Tat-mediated neurotoxicity by mitigating apoptosis and neurite & MAP-2 loss. Using pharmacological and loss of function approaches we identified the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling in PDGF-CC-mediated neuroprotection. We report herein a novel role about the involvement of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channel 1 in modulation of calcium transients in PDGF-CC-mediated neuroprotection. Furthermore we also demonstrated PDGF-CC-mediated inactivation of the downstream mediator--glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) evidenced by its phosphorylation at Ser-9. This was further validated by gain and loss of function studies using cells transfected with either the wild type or mutant GSK3\u03b2 constructs. Intriguingly, pretreatment of cells with either the PI3K inhibitor or TRPC blocker resulted in failure of PDGF-CC to inactivate GSK3\u03b2, thereby suggesting the intersection of PI3K and TRPC signaling at GSK3\u03b2. Taken together our findings lead to the suggestion that PDGF-CC could be developed as a therapeutic target to reverse Tat-mediated neurotoxicity with implications for HAD.", 
    "126": "The objective of the study was to explore the prevalence and characteristics of myocardial bridging in patients who underwent coronary angiography and to also evaluate the correlation between bridged coronary segments and atherosclerosis. For this purpose, clinical materials of 1,500 patients who had received coronary angiography were retrospectively analyzed. The location and length of the myocardial bridge were recorded as well as the extent and location of coronary artery stenosis was described. Segments proximal and distal to the bridging were evaluated for coronary arteriosclerosis as were the remaining coronary segments. We found that myocardial bridging was present in 179 (11.9 %) patients. Bridges were frequently (84.9 %) localized in the mid-distal segment of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Myocardial bridging was not considered a significant risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis (odds ratio 0.58) compared with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The incidence of coronary arteriosclerosis in the distal segments was significantly less affected than the proximal segments (P < 0.01). It was, therefore, concluded that myocardial bridging frequently localized in the mid-distal segment of the LAD artery. The presence of myocardial bridging promotes proximal atherosclerosis but it is not an additional risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis.", 
    "127": "This study evaluated the effects of early treatment with \u03b2-adrenergic blocker metoprolol on ventricular remodeling and function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by using high frequency ultrasound. The relationship between the efficacy and the expression level of cardiac myocardial inflammatory cytokine was examined in rats. The rat model of AMI was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery. The surviving rats were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: MI control (MI) group and MI metoprolol (MI-B) group, with the rats undergoing sham operation serving as normal control (Sham). MI-B group was given metoprolol for 4 weeks (refer to the CCS-2 protocol) and the other two groups received equal volume of saline via intragastric (i.g.) administration. The ventricular remodeling and function were evaluated by high frequency ultrasound 4 weeks after the treatment. Then all rats were sacrificed for pathological examination and immunohistochemistrical detection of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1. Compared with the MI group, the left ventricular end-systolic dimension, end-diastolic dimension, end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume of the MI-B group were significantly decreased (P<0.01), while the left ventricular anterior wall end-diastolic thickness, ejection fraction and fractional shortening were obviously increased (P<0.01). The conspicuous improvement in the left ventricular morphology and function was coincident with the markedly reduced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression and the increased IL-10 expression. We are led to conclude that early metoprolol treatment for AMI can regulate myocardial inflammatory cytokine expression to improve cardiac function and the underlying mechanism might be that it decreases the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases the level of its anti-inflammatory counterparts in cardiac myocytes. Our study also showed that echocardiography is a useful technique for the structural and functional assessment of left ventricle after acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "128": "Pharmacogenetics involves complex interactions of gene products affecting pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, but there is little information on the interaction of multiple genetic modifiers of drug response.

In contrast, the minor allele carrier combination (13% subset) exhibited additive efficacy loss. These disparate effects are likely due to the higher proportion (42% vs. 8.7%, P\u200a=\u200a0.009) of high-affinity NE binding sites in \u03b2(1)389 Arg vs. Gly ARs, which converts \u03b1(2C)Del minor allele-associated NE lowering from a therapeutic liability to a benefit.",

    "132": "To assess the prognostic significance of blood pressure (BP) variability, we followed health outcomes in a family-based random population sample representative of the general population (n=2944; mean age: 44.9 years; 50.7% women). At baseline, BP was measured 5 times consecutively at each of 2 home visits 2 to 4 weeks apart. We assessed within-subject overall (10 readings), within- and between-visit systolic BP variability from variability independent of the mean, the difference between maximum and minimum BP, and average real variability. Over a median follow-up of 12 years, 401 deaths occurred and 311 participants experienced a fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular event. Overall systolic BP variability averaged (SD) 5.45 (2.82) units, 15.87 (8.36) mmHg, and 4.08 (2.05) mmHg for variability independent of the mean, difference between maximum and minimum BP, and average real variability, respectively. Female sex, older age, higher-mean systolic BP, lower body mass index, a history of peripheral arterial disease, and use of \u03b2-blockers were the main correlates of systolic BP variability. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, overall and within- and between-visit BP variability did not predict total or cardiovascular mortality or the composite of any fatal plus nonfatal cardiovascular end point. For instance, the hazard ratios for all cardiovascular events combined in relation to overall variability independent of the mean, difference between maximum and minimum BP, and average real variability were 1.05 (0.96-1.15), 1.06 (0.96-1.16), and 1.08 (0.98-1.19), respectively. By contrast, mean systolic BP was a significant predictor of all end points under study, independent of BP variability. In conclusion, in an unbiased population sample, BP variability did not contribute to risk stratification over and beyond mean systolic BP.", 
    "133": "Tolbutamide and gliclazide block the K(ATP) channel K(ir)6.2/Sur1, causing membrane depolarization and stimulating insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. We examined the ability of the EPAC-selective cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM to potentiate the action of these drugs and the mechanism that might account for it. Insulin secretion stimulated by both 200 \u03bcM tolbutamide and 20 \u03bcM gliclazide, concentrations that had equivalent effects on membrane potential, was inhibited by thapsigargin (1 \u03bcM) or the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nicardipine (2 \u03bcM) and was potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at concentrations \u22652 \u03bcM in INS-1 cells. Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 \u03bcM but not 1 \u03bcM. Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 \u03bcM) did not stimulate insulin secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 \u03bcM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of insulin secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 \u03bcM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (1 \u03bcM). Our data demonstrate that the actions of both tolbutamide and gliclazide are strongly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM, that gliclazide can stimulate phospholipase C activity via a partially pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism, and that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of tolbutamide action may involve activation of a 2-APB-sensitive Ca(2+) influx.",

To test for peripheral versus central effects, the peripherally acting \u03b2-blocker sotalol was also examined. Experimental stimuli were brief superficial noxious heat stimuli applied to the volar forearm. Non-painful cold stimuli were included to test for specificity.

    "138": "Intracranial aneurysms (IA) are a relatively frequent vascular abnormality. The prevailing opinion is that cerebral aneurysmal disease is related to hemodynamic and genetic factors, associated with structural weakness in the arterial wall which was acquired by a specific, often unknown, event. Possibly the trigger moment of aneurysm formation may depend on the dynamic arterial growth, which is closely related to aging/atherosclerosis. In most individuals, an endovascular/microsurgical approach is possible in order to obliterate the IA. However, in a number of patients with an unruptured IA (UIA), the neurosurgeon's decision is to just \"sit back, observe, and wait\", based on the favorable natural history of some of the UIAs. Furthermore, some individuals need to be kept under close observation since they have a higher chance of developing IA, especially those with at least two affected first-degree relatives with an IA, subjects with polycystic kidney disease, and patients who have undergone an aneurysm intervention. In these examples prophylactic strategies should be adopted, if it is at all possible. The main question is deciding the best option of clinical treatment for these cases, when surgical approach is contraindicated, or for those subjects who are more prone to develop an IA. In the present article, we hypothetically suggest a pharmacologic form of treatment with statins, beta-adrenergic blocker agents, and/or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blockers to inhibit or slow down IA formation, taking into consideration some pathophysiological aspects related to aneurysmal development, such as: hemodynamic stress, arterial wall inflammation, nitric oxide formation, and atheromatous disease.", 
    "139": "Yokukansan (YKS) is a traditional Japanese medicine consisting of seven medicinal herbs that is used for the treatment of neurosis, insomnia, and the behavioral/psychological symptoms of dementia. This study examined the effects of YKS on morphine tolerance and physical dependence in mice. Daily oral administration of YKS (0.5 or 1.0 g/kg) for 3 weeks significantly attenuated morphine tolerance and naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal signs (jumps and body weight loss) without affecting the analgesic effect of morphine. The inhibitory effect of YKS on withdrawal jumps in morphine-dependent mice was blocked by a single pretreatment with an \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, but not by an \u03b1(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin. A similar inhibitory effect on withdrawal jumps was observed by repeated administration of yohimbine. The membrane expression of \u03b1(2A)-adrenoceptors in the pons/medulla was decreased in morphine withdrawn animals; this reduction was prevented by repeated administration of YKS or yohimbine. Competitive radioligand and [(35)S]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding assays revealed that YKS and its constituent herbs, Glycyrrhiza (GR) and Uncaria hook (UH), had specific binding affinity for and antagonist activity against the \u03b1(2A)-adrenoceptor. Certain chemical constituents, including GR -derived glycyrrhizin and its metabolite, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, and UH-derived geissoschizine methyl ether (GME), shared such activities. Repeated administration of GR, UH, glycyrrhizin or GME significantly inhibited morphine withdrawal signs. These results suggest that YKS and its active constituents inhibit morphine tolerance and physical dependence, and that the latter is due at least in part to the prevention of the decreased membrane expression of the \u03b1(2A)-adrenoceptor in the brainstem by its prolonged blockade.",

    "148": "Angiotensin may promote endothelial dysfunction through iron accumulation. To research this, bovine endothelial cells (ECs) were incubated with iron (30 \u00b5mol\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9) with or without angiotensin II (100 nmol\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9). After incubation for 6 h, it was observed that the addition of angiotensin enhanced EC iron accumulation by 5.1-fold compared with a 1.8-fold increase for cells incubated with iron only. This enhanced iron uptake was attenuated by losartan (100 nmol\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9), d-propranolol (10 \u00b5mol\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9), 4-HO-propranolol (5 \u00b5mol\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9), and methylamine, but not by vitamin E or atenolol. After 6 h of incubation, angiotensin plus iron provoked intracellular oxidant formation (2'7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) fluorescence) and elevated oxidized glutathione; significant loss of cell viability occurred at 48 h. Stimulated prostacyclin release decreased by 38% (6 h) and NO synthesis was reduced by 41% (24 h). Both oxidative events and functional impairment were substantially attenuated by losartan or d-propranolol. It is concluded that angiotensin promoted non-transferrin-bound iron uptake via AT-1 receptor activation, leading to EC oxidative functional impairment. The protective effects of d-propranolol and 4-HO-propranolol may be related to their lysosomotropic properties.",

Previously, we have shown that the human (h) \u03b2(1)AR is cleaved in its N terminus by a metalloproteinase, both constitutively and in a receptor activation-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the specific events involved in \u03b2(1)AR regulation, focusing on the effects of long-term treatment with \u03b2-adrenergic ligands on receptor processing in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293(i) cells. The key findings were verified using the transiently transfected h\u03b2(1)AR and the endogenously expressed receptor in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. By using flow cytometry and Western blotting, we demonstrated that isoproterenol, S-propranolol, CGP-12177 [4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one], pindolol, and timolol, which displayed agonistic properties toward the \u03b2(1)AR in either the adenylyl cyclase or the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, induced cleavage of the mature cell-surface receptor. In contrast, metoprolol, bisoprolol, and CGP-20712 [1-[2-((3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxy)phenoxy)ethylamino]-3-[4-(1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)phenoxy]-2-propanol], which showed no agonistic activity, had only a marginal or no effect. Importantly, the agonists also stabilized intracellular receptor precursors, possibly via their pharmacological chaperone action, and they stabilized the receptor in vitro. The opposing effects on the two receptor forms thus led to an increase in the amount of cleaved receptor fragments at the plasma membrane. The results underscore the pluridimensionality of \u03b2-adrenergic ligands and extend this property from receptor activation and signaling to the regulation of \u03b2(1)AR levels. This phenomenon may contribute to the exceptional resistance of \u03b2(1)ARs to downregulation and tendency toward upregulation following long-term ligand treatments.",

VEGF-C gene expression and VEGF-C production in the cell supernatant were evaluated by real-time PCR and by ELISA, respectively. The results showed that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation by different concentrations of norepinephrine or blocking by propranolol did not markedly alter VEGF-C expression by SCC-9 and SCC-25 cells. VEGF-C protein levels produced by oral malignant cell lines after stimulation with different norepinephrine concentrations or blocking with propranolol was statistically similar (p\u2009>\u20090.05) to those of the control group (nonstimulated OSCC cell lines). Our findings suggest that stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors by means of norepinephrine does not seem to modulate the VEGF-C expression in OSCC cell lines. These findings reinforce the need for further studies in order to understand the responsiveness of oral cancer to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation or blockage, especially with regard to VEGF-C production.",

    "190": "These data indicate that this model could be an appropriate alternative to excised mucosa for the in-vitro evaluation of nasal drug absorption.", 
    "191": "A highly crystallizable T4 lysozyme (T4L) was fused to the N-terminus of the \u03b2(2) adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for catecholamines. We demonstrate that the N-terminal fused T4L is sufficiently rigid relative to the receptor to facilitate crystallogenesis without thermostabilizing mutations or the use of a stabilizing antibody, G protein, or protein fused to the 3rd intracellular loop. This approach adds to the protein engineering strategies that enable crystallographic studies of GPCRs alone or in complex with a signaling partner.", 
    "192": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to achieve or maintain the adequate erection for intercourse. Heart failure is a major risk factor for erectile dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with erectile dysfunction in systolic heart failure.", 
    "193": "In a cross-sectional study 100 male patients with systolic heart failure were selected using convenience sampling method. IIEF-5 questionnaire (the International Index of Erectile Function, 5-item version), MLHFQ (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and CES-D (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) were used to obtain data.", 
    "194": "Mean score of erectile dysfunction was 14.02 \u00b1 6.26 and 80% of heart failure patient had erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction was significantly associated with age (P < 0.001), education (P = 0.019), occupation (P = 0.002), hemoglobin level (P = 0.003), left ventricular ejection fraction (P = 0.030), cholesterol level (P = 0.001), renal dysfunction (P = 0.009), use of digoxin (P = 0.014), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (P < 0.001), beta blocker (P = 0.001), diuretics (P = 0.035), depression (P < 0.001) and quality of life (P < 0.001).",

    "196": "Primary stabbing headache (PSH) is defined by the presence of short stabbing pains in the first branch of the trigeminal nerve. According to population-based studies, it is very prevalent, but most cases present stabbing pains with low frequencies and intensities that do not lead the patient to seek medical attention.", 
    "197": "We report on 67 cases of PSH attended in the headache service of a tertiary hospital. In the study, the demographic and clinical characteristics are studied, treatment response is reviewed and the features of PSH are compared in terms of whether it was the only headache or was accompanied by others.", 
    "198": "The study involved 67 patients (51 females and 16 males) diagnosed with PSH between January 2008 and January 2012, of a total number of 1668 (4%) patients attended in the above-mentioned service.", 
    "199": "Age at onset: 34.5 \u00b1 16.7 years. Forty-nine cases (73.1%) were associated to another headache, above all migraine. Stabbing pains were often bilateral; 38 (56.7%) patients suffered more than one a day and 11 (16.4%) had more than 10 per day. They lasted less than five seconds in 48 patients (71.6%) and more than 10 seconds in 11 of them (16.4%), with an intensity of 6.8 \u00b1 1.5. The age of onset of PSH was higher if it was the only type of headache than if it was accompanied by others. Twenty-six (38.8%) patients required preventive treatment for the associated headache and 16 (23.8%) took indomethacin, with a similar response in the two groups (73 versus 75%). CONCLUSIONS; PSH is not infrequent in headache clinics, but its phenotype differs from that reported in population-based studies. The characteristics of PSH vary depending on whether it is the only headache or is associated with others. Preventive treatment is often required and patients respond well to it.",

    "201": "The study was prospective and randomized controlled trial. Acebutolol and diltiazem versus placebo were compared, among 117 patients postpneumonectomy or lobectomy at the Thoracosurgery Clinic, Poznan University of Medical Sciences in Poland. Patients who were enrolled in the study were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: those who received acebutolol (Group 1) or diltiazem (Group 2) and compared with patients without antiarrhythmic drugs (Group 0). Each group consisted of 39 patients. The patients were continuously monitored postoperatively with 24 ECG (Holter monitor) in the intensive care unit.",

    "203": "Acebutolol and diltiazem appear to have been non-effective for the treatment or prevention of AF. Side effects were mild. In comparison to diltiazem, however, acebutolol had a beneficial effect on the circulatory system. Patients who had received acebutolol proved to have had fewer tachycardia episodes and supraventricular ectopy during the postoperative period. It seems that acebutolol can be useful, especially in patients with sympathetic activity dominance.",

    "205": "A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients admitted between November 2009 and January 2011 with ICH and SAH to compare effectiveness and safety between both agents. Percent time spent at goal was set as the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes included blood pressure variability, time to goal, incidence of bradycardia, tachycardia, and hypotension.", 
    "206": "A total of 81 patients were available for analysis, 10 initiated on labetalol (LAB), 57 on nicardipine (NIC), and 14 required the combination of these agents (COMB) to reach goal. We found no difference between NIC, LAB, and the COMB groups in the median percent time at goal [88 % (61-98); 93 % (51-99); 66 % (25-95), (p = NS)]. Median percentage of blood pressure variability, hypotension, and bradycardia were also comparable between groups, however, more tachycardia was observed in the COMB group versus both LAB and NIC groups (45 vs. 0 vs. 3 %; p < 0.001). Mean time to goal SBP in 24 patients who had BP readings available at 1st h of initiation was 32 \u00b1 34 min in the NIC group and 53 \u00b1 42 min in the LAB group (p = 0.03).",

    "208": "The effect of \u03b2-blockers in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients who have undergone primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been adequately evaluated. Using a large multi-center registry in Japan, we identified 3,692 patients who underwent PCI within 24 h from onset of STEMI and were discharged alive from 2005 to 2007. Three-year cardiovascular outcomes were compared between the 2 groups of patients with (N = 1,614) or without (N = 2,078) \u03b2-blocker prescription at discharge. Compared with patients in the no-\u03b2 group, patients in the \u03b2 group were younger, more frequently male, more often had hypertension and atrial fibrillation but less often had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than in the no-\u03b2 group. Statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers were more frequently prescribed in the \u03b2 group. Crude incidence of cardiac death and/or recurrent myocardial infarction (cardiac death/MI) tended to be higher in the \u03b2 group (7.6 vs. 6.2%, log-rank p = 0.1). After adjusting for potential confounders, \u03b2-blockers were associated with significantly higher risk for cardiac death/MI (hazard ratio 1.43, 95% CI: 1.06-1.94, p = 0.01). \u03b2-Blocker prescription at discharge was not associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in patients who underwent PCI after STEMI. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the role of \u03b2-blocker therapy in these patients.", 
    "209": "Over-expression of c-fos may play a role in some diseases. Research pertaining to the expression of c-fos in acute myocardial \u0131nfarction (AMI) is rare, and the detailed role of c-fos in AMI has not been reported. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to elucidate the detailed effect of c-fos on AMI rats and evaluate the effect of a metoprolol intervention. An AMI rat model was established for the purposes of this study. The expression of c-fos in AMI was evaluated via immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization. Simultaneously, we investigated the effect of c-fos on AMI rats via medicinal treatment with c-fos monoclonal antibody, isoproterenol, and metoprolol. Positive c-Fos protein expression and c-fos mRNA expression in cardiomyocytes were increased at 1, 3, 7, and 10 days after ligation in AMI rats compared with a sham-operated group. Peak expression occurred at 3 days after ligation. The weight percentage fraction of infarct size was decreased in rats treated with c-fos monoclonal antibody compared with the control normal saline treatment group. The weight percentage fraction of infarction size was increased after c-fos was increased via the administration of isoproterenol. c-Fos protein expression and the infarct size in rats treated with metoprolol were also decreased compared with the control normal saline treatment group. The results showed that c-fos expression rapidly increased after coronary ligation; c-fos plays an important role in myocardial lesions and is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of AMI as well. Metoprolol can inhibit the expression of c-fos and has a positive therapeutic effect on rats after AMI; the involvement effect of metoprolol on myocardial infarction might be correlated with its effect on the inhibition of c-fos.", 
    "210": "This study investigated the degradation pathway of metoprolol, a widely used \u03b2-blocker, in the ozonation via the identification of generated ozonation by-products (OPs). Structure elucidation of OPs was performed using HPLC coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry. Seven OPs were identified, and four of these have not been reported elsewhere. Identified OPs of metoprolol included aromatic ring breakdown by-products; aliphatic chain degraded by-products and aromatic ring mono-, di-, and tetrahydroxylated derivatives. Based on the detected OPs, metoprolol could be degraded through aromatic ring opening reaction via reaction with ozone (O3) and degradation of aliphatic chain and aromatic ring via reaction with hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH).", 
    "211": "Most patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) usually complain of a reduced exercise capacity, and several factors have been advocated as possible causes of this clinical feature. The present single-center study was designed to investigate exercise capacity and its main clinical determinants in HCM patients. One hundred ninety seven patients of 223 evaluated underwent a complete clinical assessment, including Doppler echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and, in most cases, cardiac magnetic resonance. The HCM population (male 75\u00a0%; age 47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016\u00a0years; NYHA class I or II 95\u00a0%; left ventricular ejection fraction 61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0%; resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient \u226530\u00a0mmHg 22\u00a0%; late gadolinium enhancement presence 58\u00a0%) showed slightly reduced mean peak oxygen uptake values (pVO2 75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0%, 23.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0ml/kg/min) with a significant reduction of the achieved percentage of peak heart rate reserve (%pHRR 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0%). Adopting a pVO2 <80\u00a0% cut-off value, 59\u00a0% of HCM patients showed a reduced exercise capacity. Age, male gender, left atrial size, chronotropic and systolic blood pressure response, ventilatory efficiency, late gadolinium enhancement presence and \u03b2-blocker therapy were independently associated with pVO2 (R (2)-adjusted index 0.738). A %pHRR cut-off value of 74\u00a0% appeared to most accurately predict an impaired exercise capacity (area under curve 0.90). A great prevalence of reduced exercise capacity is present in NYHA class I-II HCM patients. Notwithstanding its multifactorial genesis, few parameters might be adopted in identifying this feature. In this context, %pHRR value might represent a reliable and easy-to-obtain tool for the clinical evaluation of HCM patients.", 
    "212": "Emerging evidence implicates novel roles for post-translational prenylation (i.e., farnesylation and geranylgeranylation) of various signaling proteins in a variety of cellular functions including hormone secretion, survival and apoptosis. In the context of cellular apoptosis, it has been shown previously that caspase-3 activation, a hallmark of mitochondrial dysregulation, promotes hydrolysis of several key cellular proteins. We report herein that exposure of insulin-secreting INS 832/13 cells or normal rat islets to etoposide leads to significant activation of caspase-3 and subsequent degradation of the common \u03b1-subunit of farnesyl/geranylgeranyl transferases (FTase/GGTase). Furthermore, the above stated signaling steps were prevented by Z-DEVD-FMK, a known inhibitor of caspase-3. In addition, treatment of cell lysates with recombinant caspase-3 also caused FTase/GGTase \u03b1-subunit degradation. Moreover, nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, markedly attenuated etoposide-induced caspase-3 activation, FTase/GGTase \u03b1-subunit degradation in INS 832/13 cells and normal rat islets. Further, nifedipine significantly restored etoposide-induced loss in metabolic cell viability in INS 832/13 cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that etoposide induces loss in cell viability by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase-3 activation and degradation of FTase/GGTase \u03b1-subunit. Potential significance of these findings in the context of protein prenylation and \u03b2-cell survival are discussed."
