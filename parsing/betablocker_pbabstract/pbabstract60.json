Abrupt heart rate reduction in this condition may be deleterious as is illustrated by two cases. Both patients were referred in cardiogenic shock after inappropriate treatment with a beta-blocking agent, initiated as a symptomatic treatment of a sinus tachycardia.Thus even if beta-blocking agents provoked a paradigm shift in the understanding of heart failure and became a cornerstone of the treatment, therapy should be initiated with knowledge of the underlying condition.", 
    "1": "Emerging evidence suggests the involvement of altered microRNA (miRNA) regulation in heart failure pathogenesis. We established a rat volume-overload heart failure model, and examined miRNA expression in normal rats and in the heart failure model, both with and without treatment with bisoprolol. Using miRNA microarrays, we identified 46 differentially expressed miRNAs in the rat heart failure model compared with normal rats. We also identified 18 differentially expressed miRNAs following treatment of normal rats with bisoprolol. Treatment with bisoprolol reversed, to varying degrees, the expression of 10 of the 46 miRNAs whose expression was differentially expressed in the heart failure model. Bioinformatic category analysis of the predicted target genes of these 10 miRNAs suggested that several encode ion-binding proteins. Our results showed that bisoprolol intervention can significantly improve cardiac function and decrease myocardial reconstruction in chronic heart failure. These data suggest that the expression of many miRNAs changes during heart failure, and that bisoprolol may exert its cardioprotective effects in part by reversing the differential expression of some of these genes.",

Patients with mild to moderate reactive airway disease, probably both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, may have a limited fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) following single-dose administration of \u03b2-blocker, whereas no change in FEV1 has been reported following long-term administration. In a murine model of asthma, long-term administration of \u03b2-blockers resulted in a decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. In keeping with this, long-term administration of a nonselective \u03b2-blocker to steroid-na\u00efve asthma patients has shown a dose-dependent improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness, and either an asymptomatic fall in FEV1 or no significant change in FEV1. Furthermore, available studies show that bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled methacholine is reversed by salbutamol in patients on regular therapy with a \u03b2-blocker. On the other hand, a recent placebo-controlled trial of propranolol and tiotropium bromide added to inhaled corticosteroids revealed no effect on airway hyperresponsiveness and a small, not statistically significant, fall in FEV1 in patients classified as having mild to moderate asthma.",

There is an increasing body of evidence supporting improved outcome with expanded use of NSBB and antibiotic therapy beyond current indications.

In the EU, it is approved for use (in addition to standard optimal therapy) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity in adult patients with chronic systolic heart failure (HF) and mild symptoms. This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of eplerenone in this indication and briefly summarizes its pharmacology. In the EMPHASIS-HF study, relative to placebo, the addition of eplerenone to optimal background therapy significantly reduced the risk of death from CV causes or hospitalization for HF in patients with chronic systolic HF and mild symptoms. Benefits of eplerenone therapy over placebo were also observed in several secondary outcomes, including: death from any cause or hospitalization for HF; death from any cause; hospitalization for any reason; or hospitalization for HF. Eplerenone was generally well tolerated in this study, with the most frequent adverse event being hyperkalaemia, which is a known adverse event of the drug class. Sexual adverse events (e.g. gynecomastia) occurred in <1 % of eplerenone recipients, reflecting the selectivity of eplerenone for mineralocorticoid receptors. Based on these results, European guidelines have been updated and recommend the use of an MRA to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and premature death in all patients with persisting symptoms (New York Heart Association class II-IV) and a left-ventricular ejection fraction of \u226435 %, despite treatment with ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin receptor blocker if an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated) and a \u03b2-blocker.",

    "24": "In the intact mouse hippocampus patterned afferent stimulation does not lead to long-term depression (LTD) at Schaffer collateral (Sc)-CA1 synapses, but the same synapses express robust LTD (<24 h) if test-pulse or patterned afferent experience is coupled with novel spatial learning. This suggests that the failure of sole afferent stimulation to elicit LTD relates to the absence of neuromodulatory input related to increased arousal or novelty during learning. Locus coeruleus (LC) firing increases during novel experience, and in rats patterned stimulation of the LC together with test-pulse stimulation of Sc-CA1 synapses leads to robust LTD in vivo. This effect is mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. Here, we explored if activation of beta-adrenergic receptors supports the expression of LTD in freely behaving mice. We also explored if beta-adrenergic receptors contribute to endogenous LTD that is expressed following spatial learning. Patterned stimulation of Sc-CA1 synapses at 3 Hz (200 pulses) resulted in short-term depression (STD). Pretreatment with isoproterenol, an agonist of beta-adrenergic receptors, resulted in robust LTD (<24 h). Test-pulse stimulation under control conditions elicited field potentials that were stable for the 24-h monitoring period. Coupling of test-pulses with a novel spatial object recognition task resulted in robust endogenous LTD (<24 h). Pretreatment with propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, completely prevented endogenous LTD that was enabled by learning and prevented object recognition learning itself. These data indicate that the absence of LTD in freely behaving mice, under standard recording conditions, does not reflect an inability of mice to express LTD, rather it is due to the absence of a noradrenalin tonus. Our data also support that spatial object recognition requires beta-adrenergic receptor activation. Furthermore, LTD that is enabled by novel spatial learning critically depends on activation of beta-adrenergic receptors that are presumably activated by noradrenalin released by the LC in response to the novel experience.",

    "30": "We investigated healthy control myocardium (n=5) and myocardium from patients with compensated hypertrophy (n=25) and HF (n=32). In hypertrophy, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase A (PKA) both phosphorylated RyR2 at levels that were not different from healthy myocardium. Accordingly, inhibitors of these kinases reduced the SR Ca(2+) leak. In HF, however, the SR Ca(2+) leak was nearly doubled compared with hypertrophy, which led to reduced systolic Ca(2+) transients, a depletion of SR Ca(2+) storage and elevated diastolic Ca(2+) levels. This was accompanied by a significantly increased CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2. In contrast, PKA-dependent RyR2 phosphorylation was not increased in HF and was independent of previous \u03b2-blocker treatment. In HF, CaMKII inhibition but not inhibition of PKA yielded a reduction of the SR Ca(2+) leak. Moreover, PKA inhibition further reduced SR Ca(2+) load and systolic Ca(2+) transients.", 
    "31": "In human hypertrophy, both CaMKII and PKA functionally regulate RyR2 and may induce SR Ca(2+) leak. In the transition from hypertrophy to HF, the diastolic Ca(2+) leak increases and disturbed Ca(2+) cycling occurs. This is associated with an increase in CaMKII- but not PKA-dependent RyR2 phosphorylation. CaMKII inhibition may thus reflect a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction.",

    "36": "In the present study, we compared the cardioprotective effects of TRV120023, a novel angiotensin II (ANG II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) ligand, which blocks G protein coupling but stimulates \u03b2-arrestin signaling, against treatment with losartan, a conventional AT1R blocker in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and regulation of myofilament activity and phosphorylation. Rats were subjected to 3 wk of treatment with saline, ANG II, ANG II + losartan, ANG II + TRV120023, or TRV120023 alone. ANG II induced increased left ventricular mass compared with rats that received ANG II + losartan or ANG II + TRV120023. Compared with saline controls, ANG II induced a significant increase in pCa50 and maximum Ca(2+)-activated myofilament tension but reduced the Hill coefficient (nH). TRV120023 increased maximum tension and pCa50, although to lesser extent than ANG II. In contrast to ANG II, TRV120023 increased nH. Losartan blocked the effects of ANG II on pCa50 and nH and reduced maximum tension below that of saline controls. ANG II + TRV120023 showed responses similar to those of TRV120023 alone; compared with ANG II + losartan, ANG II + TRV120023 preserved maximum tension and increased both pCa50 and cooperativity. Tropomyosin phosphorylation was lower in myofilaments from saline-treated hearts compared with the other groups. Phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I was significantly reduced in ANG II + TRV120023 and TRV120023 groups versus saline controls, and myosin-binding protein C phosphorylation at Ser(282) was unaffected by ANG II or losartan but significantly reduced with TRV120023 treatment compared with all other groups. Our data indicate that TRV120023-related promotion of \u03b2-arrestin signaling and enhanced contractility involves a mechanism promoting the myofilament response to Ca(2+) via altered protein phosphorylation. Selective activation of \u03b2-arrestin-dependent pathways may provide advantages over conventional AT1R blockers.", 
    "37": "In heart failure (HF), the impaired left ventricular (LV) arterial coupling and diastolic dysfunction present at rest are exacerbated during exercise. We have previously shown that in HF at rest stimulation of \u03b23-adrenergic receptors by endogenous catecholamine depresses LV contraction and relaxation. \u03b23-Adrenergic receptors are activated at higher concentrations of catecholamine. Thus exercise may cause increased stimulation of cardiac \u03b23-adrenergic receptors and contribute to this abnormal response. We assessed the effect of L-748,337 (50 \u03bcg/kg iv), a selective \u03b23-adrenergic receptor antagonist (\u03b23-ANT), on LV dynamics during exercise in 12 chronically instrumented dogs with pacing-induced HF. Compared with HF at rest, exercise increased LV end-systolic pressure (PES), minimum LV pressure (LVPmin), and the time constant of LV relaxation (\u03c4) with an upward shift of early diastolic portion of LV pressure-volume loop. LV contractility decreased and arterial elastance (EA) increased. LV arterial coupling (EES/EA) (0.40 vs. 0.51) was impaired. Compared with exercise in HF preparation, exercise after \u03b23-ANT caused similar increases in heart rate and PES but significantly decreased \u03c4 (34.9 vs. 38.3 ms) and LVPmin with a downward shift of the early diastolic portion of LV pressure-volume loop and further augmented dV/dtmax. Both EES and EES/EA (0.68 vs. 0.40) were increased. LV mechanical efficiency improved from 0.39 to 0.53. In conclusion, after HF, \u03b23-ANT improves LV diastolic filling; increases LV contractility, LV arterial coupling, and mechanical efficiency; and improves exercise performance.",

    "48": "Toxicity of metoprolol (MET) alone and in mixtures with its photocatalytic degradation intermediates obtained by using TiO2 Wackherr and Degussa P25 under UV irradiation in the presence of O2 was evaluated in vitro in a panel of three histologically different cell lines: rat hepatoma (H-4-II-E), human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) and human fetal lung (MRC-5). Both catalysts promoted a time-dependent increase in the toxicity of the photodegradation products, and those obtained using Degussa P25 photocatalyst were more toxic. The most pronounced and selective toxic action of MET and products of its photodegradation was observed in the hepatic cell line. The higher toxicity of the mixtures obtained using Degussa P25 catalyst could be explained by a different mechanism of MET degradation, i.e. by the presence or higher concentrations of some intermediates. Although the concentrations of intermediates obtained using TiO2 Wackherr catalyst were higher, they did not affect significantly the growth of the examined cell lines, indicating their lower toxicity. This suggests that a treatment aiming at complete mineralization should be performed bearing in mind that the type of catalyst, the concentration of target molecule, and the duration of the process are significant factors that determine the nature and toxicity of the resulting mixtures. Although the EC50 values of MET obtained in mammalian cell lines were higher compared to the bioassays for lower trophic levels, the time-dependent promotion of toxicity of degradation mixtures should be attributed to the higher sensitivity of mammalian cell bioassays.",

Isoprenaline (an agonist of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor) significantly increased the gain of reflex bradycardia without affecting blood-pressure increases, leading to increased baroreflex sensitivity. Our results suggest that norepinephrine in the PVN facilitates the phenylephrine-induced baroreflex via \u03b2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "50": "Feedback activation of neurohormonal pathways in the setting of kidney or heart failure contributes to the development and progression of dysfunction in the other. Diabetes and its management independently activate these same pathogenic pathways, feeding into this vicious cycle and contributing to a poor prognosis. One of the most important of these neurohormonal pathways is the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The activity of the SNS in increased in patients with chronic kidney disease, even in the absence of renal impairment or heart failure. There is a strong relationship between SNS overactivity and prognosis, and evidence that blockade of SNS reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. However, modulation of SNS is underutilised as a strategy to protect both the diabetic kidney and the heart. This is partly because of the historically poor tolerability, adverse haemodynamic and metabolic effects, lack of selectivity of \u03b2-blockers and the lack of specificity of other interventions that might modify SNS activation. The advent of \"vasodilating \u03b2-blockers\" with better tolerability as well as more favourable effects on renal function and metabolic profiles opens the door for their more widespread utility in patients with diabetes. Radiofrequency renal sympathectomy and baroreflex activation technologies also offer exciting new ways to tackle the challenge of sympathetic overactivity.",

AV blocking drugs included antiarrhythmic agents classes II-IV and digoxin. Fifty-five patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Forty-seven patients had an indication for a PPM at the initial hospital admission, despite drug discontinuation. Of the remaining 8 patients who were discharged without a PPM, 3 subsequently experienced events: 2 had recurrence of AV block requiring a PPM, and 1 experienced syncope. Thus, in total, 49 (89%) patients had a final indication for a permanent pacemaker (PPM). Of patients receiving beta-blocker monotherapy, 26 (96%) had an indication for a PPM.

    "58": "Reflex vasoconstriction is attenuated in aged skin due to a functional loss of adrenergic vasoconstriction. Bioavailability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor for catecholamine synthesis, is reduced with aging. Locally administered BH4 increases vasoconstriction through adrenergic mechanisms in aged human skin. We hypothesized that oral sapropterin (Kuvan, a pharmaceutical BH4) would augment vasoconstriction elicited by whole-body cooling and tyramine perfusion in aged skin. Ten healthy subjects (age 75 \u00b1 2 yr) ingested sapropterin (10 mg/kg) or placebo in a randomized, double-blind crossover design. Venous blood samples were collected prior to, and 3 h following ingestion. Three intradermal microdialysis fibers were placed in the forearm skin for local delivery of 1) lactated Ringer, 2) 5 mM BH4, and 3) 5 mM yohimbine + 1 mM propranolol (Y+P; to inhibit adrenergic vasoconstriction). Red cell flux was measured at each site by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) as reflex vasoconstriction was induced by lowering and then clamping whole-body skin temperature (Tsk) using a water-perfused suit. Following whole-body cooling, subjects were rewarmed and 1 mM tyramine was perfused at each site to elicit endogenous norepinephrine release from the perivascular nerve terminal. Cutaneous vascular conductance was calculated as CVC = LDF/mean arterial pressure and expressed as change from baseline (\u0394CVC). Plasma BH4 was elevated 3 h after ingestion of sapropterin (43.8 \u00b1 3 vs. 19.1 \u00b1 2 pmol/ml; P < 0.001). Sapropterin increased reflex vasoconstriction at the Ringer site at Tsk \u2264 32.5\u00b0C (P < 0.05). Local BH4 perfusion augmented reflex vasoconstriction at Tsk \u2264 31.5\u00b0C with placebo treatment only (P < 0.05). There was no treatment effect on reflex vasoconstriction at the BH4-perfused or Y+P-perfused sites. Sapropterin increased pharmacologically induced vasoconstriction at the Ringer site (-0.19 \u00b1 0.03 vs. -0.08 \u00b1 0.02 \u0394CVC; P = 0.01).

Sapropterin increases both reflex (cold-induced) and pharmacologically induced vasoconstriction through adrenergic mechanisms and may be a viable intervention to improve reflex vasoconstriction in aged humans.", 
    "59": "Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a proglucagon-derived peptide released from enteroendocrine cells and neurons. We recently reported that GLP-2 induced hypotension. In the present study, we characterized the mechanisms of GLP-2-induced hypotension. GLP-2 was administered peripherally or centrally to male Wistar rats anesthetized with urethane and \u03b1-chloralose. The rats were vagotomized or systemically pretreated with atropine, prazosin, or propranolol before the GLP-2 administration. The central and peripheral administration of GLP-2 reduced mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). The maximum change of MAP (maximum \u0394MAP) was reduced by vagotomy or prazosin, but not propranolol. The effects of the central but not peripheral administration of GLP-2 were reduced by atropine. These results suggest that GLP-2 modulates vagal afferent inputs and inhibits the sympathetic nervous system in the brain to induce hypotension.",

    "67": "Amygdala excitatory synaptic strengthening is thought to contribute to both conditioned fear and anxiety. Thus, one basis for behavioral flexibility could allow these pathways to be weakened and corresponding emotion to be attenuated. However, synaptic depression within the context of amygdala-dependent behavior remains poorly understood. Previous work identified lateral amygdala (LA) calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) as a key target for synaptic removal in long-term depression (LTD) and persistent fear attenuation. Here we demonstrate that LA neurons express two equally potent forms of LTD with contrasting requirements for protein kinase and phosphatase activity and differential impact on CP-AMPAR trafficking. Selective removal of CP-AMPARs from synapses is contingent on group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1) and PKC signaling, in contrast to an alternate LTD pathway that nonselectively removes AMPARs and requires calcineurin (PP2b). Intriguingly, the balance between these forms of LTD is shifted by posttraining activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in fear conditioned mice, resulting in selective augmentation of mGluR-dependent depression. These results highlight the complexity of core mechanisms in LTD and suggest that norepinephrine exposure mediates a form of synaptic metaplasticity that recalibrates fear memory processing.",

This subanalysis was conducted to compare the efficacy of three combination therapies in a subset of 834 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (287 patients treated with benidpine-ARB, 283 patients treated with benidipine-BB and 264 patients treated with benidipine-TD). The incidence of composite cardiovascular events as the primary end point did not differ among these three groups. The incidence of hard end points and cerebrovascular events among these groups did not differ either, although the incidence among all patients in the COPE trial was lower in the benidipine-TD group than in the benidipine-BB group. The incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus was higher in the benidipine-TD group than in the benidipine-ARB group among patients with CKD. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was maintained even after 12 months of treatment in patients with a baseline eGFR <60 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2) regardless of the treatment group, although the eGFR decreased over time in all patients in the three groups.

In this study we used a rodent model for characterizing cardiac autonomic modulation in rats that differ widely in their level of aggressive behavior. To reach this goal, high-aggressive (HA, n\u200a=\u200a10) and non-aggressive (NA, n\u200a=\u200a10) rats were selected from a population (n\u200a=\u200a121) of adult male Wild-type Groningen rats on the basis of their latency time to attack (ALT, s) a male intruder in a resident-intruder test lasting 600 s. In order to obtain information on their cardiac autonomic modulation, ECG recordings were subsequently obtained via radiotelemetry at rest, during stressful stimuli and under autonomic pharmacological manipulations, and analyzed by means of time- and frequency-domain indexes of heart rate variability. During resting conditions, HA rats (ALT<90 s) displayed reduced heart rate variability, mostly in terms of lower vagal modulation compared to NA rats (ALT>600 s). Exposure to stressful stimuli (i.e. restraint and psychosocial stress) provoked similar tachycardic responses between the two groups. However, under stress conditions HA rats displayed a reduced vagal antagonism and an increased incidence of tachyarrhythmias compared to NA rats. In addition, beta-adrenergic pharmacological stimulation induced a much larger incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in HA rats compared to NA counterparts. These findings are consistent with the view that high levels of aggressive behavior in rats are associated to signs of cardiac autonomic impairment and increased arrhythmogenic susceptibility that may predict vulnerability to cardiac morbidity and mortality.",

We found that these infants presented higher values of transfer function gain, which indicates impaired cerebral autoregulation, with a decreasing trend towards normality. We hypothesised that this trend was due to a vasodilation effect of the maternal use of labetalol due to accumulation, which disappeared by the third day after birth. Therefore, we investigated the values of pulse pressure in order to find evidence for a vasodilatory effect. We found that lower values of pulse pressure were present in these infants when compared with a control population, which, together with increased transfer function gain values, suggests an effect of the drug on the cerebral autoregulation.",

Mechanistically, we showed that murine hepatocytes express \u03b1 and \u03b2 adrenoceptors; that PRL directly induces hepatocyte injury and death as evidenced by increased release of lactate dehydrogenase, FASL and TNF-\u03b1 from hepatocytes in the presence of PRL; and that PRL activated the apoptotic pathway in primary hepatocyte cultures, as indicated by upregulation of Fas receptor and caspase-8 proteins. The \u03b2-AR antagonist PRL therefore appears to enhance liver injury through induction of hepatocyte death via the death pathway. Further studies are now required to extrapolate these findings to humans but meanwhile, \u03b2-AR antagonists should be avoided or used with caution in patients with non-cirrhotic NASH as they may worsen liver injury.",

We determined the utilization and variation of preoperative AF prevention and assessed the comparative effectiveness of alternative drugs using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons multicenter Contemporary Analysis of Perioperative Cardiovascular Surgical Care (CAPS-Care) registry. Among 2,177 patients who underwent high-risk CABG and/or valve surgery, the mean age was 71 \u00b1 9, 66% were men, 26% had chronic lung disease, and 21% had cerebrovascular disease. Overall use of AF prophylaxis was 84% and varied across sites (range 52% to 100%). The most common preventive agents were beta blockers (72%), followed by calcium antagonists (17%). Postoperatively, 30% (n\u00a0= 646) developed AF at a median of 2 (25th to 75th percentiles: 1 to 3) days after surgery. Increasing age, height, white race, body mass index >35, New York Heart Association class IV heart failure, preoperative dialysis, and concomitant aortic valve replacement were associated with greater odds of postoperative AF (p <0.05 for all). Preoperative amiodarone use was associated with a trend to reduction of postoperative AF (26%, adjusted odds ratio 0.72 [95% confidence interval 0.51 to 1.00], p\u00a0= 0.052). After adjustment, the odds of postoperative AF were not statistically different across agents. In conclusion, use of AF prophylaxis before surgery varied significantly. In this high-risk population, we were unable to demonstrate that any of the commonly used preventive agents were associated with lower rates of AF compared with alternatives or no treatment.",

    "109": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is commonly associated with heart failure (HF) in clinical practice since they share the same pathogenic mechanism. Both conditions incur significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the prognosis of COPD and HF combined is poorer than for either disease alone. Nevertheless, usually only one of them is diagnosed. An active search for each condition using clinical examination and additional tests including plasma natriuretic peptides, lung function testing, and echocardiography should be obtained. The combination of COPD and HF presents many therapeutic challenges. The beneficial effects of selective \u03b21-blockers should not be denied in stable patients who have HF and coexisting COPD. Additionally, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers may reduce the morbidity and mortality of COPD patients. Moreover, caution is advised with use of inhaled \u03b22-agonists for the treatment of COPD in patients with HF. Finally, noninvasive ventilation, added to conventional therapy, improves the outcome of patients with acute respiratory failure due to hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD or HF in situations of acute pulmonary edema. The establishment of a combined and integrated approach to managing these comorbidities would seem an appropriate strategy. Additional studies providing new data on the pathogenesis and management of patients with COPD and HF are needed, with the purpose of trying to improve quality of life as well as survival of these patients.",

We calculated the annual cost of some of the most commonly prescribed glaucoma medications in Mexico, according to their average wholesale price (AWP) and dose regimen. Annual costs ranged from USD4.97 for Imot 15 ml (timolol 0.5 %; Laboratorios Sophia) to USD675.39 for Alphagan 5 ml (brimonidine 0.2 %; Allergan, Inc.). \u03b2-Blockers were the least expensive glaucoma medications (range USD20.44-55.44). Alphagan 5 ml was 250 % more expensive than other selective \u03b1(2)-agonists. Of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, dorzolamide 2 % was less expensive than brinzolamide 1 % (USD326.91 vs. USD418.96). The annual cost for prostaglandin analogs ranged from USD235.58 for bimatoprost 0.03 % to USD337.78 for latanoprost 0.005 %. Some fixed combinations were less expensive than separate combinations. The average annual cost for all treatments increased by 27.87 \u00b1 10.09 % between 2009 and 2012. Annual glaucoma therapy cost seems to be lower in Mexico than in other countries, due to a lower AWP, especially for some medications made by Mexican laboratories.",

    "116": "Periodontal diseases are initiated primarily by Gram-negative, tooth-associated microbial biofilms that elicit a host response that causes osseous and soft tissue destruction. Carvedilol is a \u03b2-blocker used as a multifunctional neurohormonal antagonist that has been shown to act not only as an anti-oxidant but also as an anti-inflammatory drug. This study evaluated whether Carvedilol exerted a protective role against ligature-induced periodontitis in a rat model and defined how Carvedilol affected metalloproteinases and RANKL/RANK/OPG expression in the context of bone remodeling. Rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 10/group): (1) non-ligated (NL), (2) ligature-only (LO), and (3) ligature plus Carvedilol (1, 5 or 10 mg/kg daily for 10 days). Periodontal tissue was analyzed for histopathlogy and using immunohistochemical analysis characterized the expression profiles of MMP-2, MMP-9, COX-2, and RANKL/RANK/OPG and determined the presence of IL-1\u03b2, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1, myeloperoxidase (MPO), malonaldehyde (MDA) and, glutathione (GSH). MPO activity in the group with periodontal disease was significantly increased compared to the control group (p<0.05). Rats treated with 10 mg/kg Carvedilol presented with significantly reduced MPO and MDA concentrations (p<0.05) in addition to presenting with reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 \u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (p<0.05). IL-10 levels in Carvedilol-treated rats remained unaltered. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated reduced expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, RANK, RANKL, COX-2, and OPG in rats treated with 10 mg/kg Carvedilol. This study demonstrated that Carvedilol affected bone formation/destruction and anti-inflammatory activity in a rat model of periodontitis.", 
    "117": "Gap junctions have an important role in cell-to-cell communication, a process obviously required for embryo implantation. Uterine luminal epithelium (LE) is the first contact for an implanting embryo and is critical for the establishment of uterine receptivity. Microarray analysis of the LE from peri-implantation mouse uterus showed low-level expression of 19 gap junction proteins in preimplantation LE and upregulation of gap junction protein, beta 2 (GJB2, connexin 26, Cx26) in postimplantation LE. Time course study using in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence revealed upregulation of GJB2 in the LE surrounding the implantation site before decidualization. Similar dynamic expression of GJB2 was observed in the LE of artificially decidualized mice but not pseudopregnant mice. To determine the potential function of uterine gap junctions in embryo implantation, carbenoxolone (CBX), a broad gap junction blocker, was injected i.p. (100 mg/kg) or via local uterine fat pad (10 mg/kg) into pregnant mice on Gestation Day 3 at 1800 h, a few hours before embryo attachment to the LE. These CBX treatments disrupted embryo implantation, suggesting local effects of CBX in the uterus. However, i.p. injection of glycyrrhizic acid (100 mg/kg), which shares similar structure and multiple properties with CBX but is ineffective in blocking gap junctions, did not affect embryo implantation. Carbenoxolone also inhibited oil-induced artificial decidualization, concomitant with suppressed molecular changes and ultrastructural transformations associated with uterine preparation for embryo implantation, underscoring the adverse effect of CBX on uterine preparation for embryo implantation. These data demonstrate that uterine gap junctions are important for embryo implantation.", 
    "118": "Berberine, an isoquinoline plant alkaloid, protects neurons against neurotoxicity. An excessive release of glutamate is considered to be one of the molecular mechanisms of neuronal damage in several neurological diseases. In this study, we investigated whether berberine could affect endogenous glutamate release in nerve terminals of rat cerebral cortex (synaptosomes) and explored the possible mechanism. Berberine inhibited the release of glutamate evoked by the K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and this phenomenon was prevented by the chelating extracellular Ca(2+) ions and the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1, but was insensitive to the glutamate transporter inhibitor DL-threo-beta-benzyl-oxyaspartate. Inhibition of glutamate release by berberine was not due to it decreasing synaptosomal excitability, because berberine did not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of berberine on glutamate release was associated with a reduction in the depolarization-induced increase in cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration. Involvement of the Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channels in the berberine action was confirmed by blockade of the berberine-mediated inhibition of glutamate release by the Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channel blocker \u03c9-agatoxin IVA. In addition, the inhibitory effect of berberine on evoked glutamate release was prevented by the mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors. Berberine decreased the 4-AP-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and synapsin I, the main presynaptic target of ERK; this decrease was also blocked by the MEK inhibition. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of berberine on evoked glutamate release was prevented in nerve terminals from mice lacking synapsin I. Together, these results indicated that berberine inhibits glutamate release from rats cortical synaptosomes, through the suppression of presynaptic Cav2.1 channels and ERK/synapsin I signaling cascade. This finding may provide further understanding of the mode of berberine action in the brain and highlights the therapeutic potential of this compound in the treatment of a wide range of neurological disorders.",

    "123": "Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a family of many diseases, and these diseases share some clinical, genetic, and radiologic features. The disease process in the spine at the beginning is spinal inflammation, in which TNF \u03b1 is the principal cytokine involved. Therefore, the dramatic clinical and pathologic response of anti-TNF \u03b1 therapy in SpA is based upon the presence of increased TNF \u03b1 in synovial tissues and sacroiliac joints, which perpetuates chronic inflammation. The increased Toll-like receptors (TCR) 2 and 4 in the serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or synovial tissues of ankylosing spondyloarthritis (AS) or SpA patients suggest that SpA is highly associated with innate immunity. Any drug including anti-TNF \u03b1 blocker which can downregulate the TCR, infiltrated neutrophils, or CD163+ macrophages in the synovial tissue is the rationale for the management of SpA. Like rheumatoid arthritis, the increased TH22 and TH17 cells either in blood, synovial fluid, or synovial tissues were also demonstrated in SpA. Thus, TH17 and TH22 may be reasonable cellular targets for therapeutic intervention. Drugs (anti-IL6R or anti-IL6) which can reduce the binding of IL6 and IL6R to the cell surface may be beneficial in SpA. Many proteins are implicated in the new bone formation (syndesmophyte) or ankylosis in AS or SpA. The enhanced BMP and Wnt pathway will activate osteoblasts which promote the new bone formation. However, no drug including anti-TNF \u03b1 can stop or prevent the syndesmophyte in AS. In summary, looking for new targeting therapies for either anti-inflammation (beyond anti-TNF) or anti-bone formation (including anti-TGF \u03b2 or PDGF) is warranted in the future.", 
    "124": "Global change requires plant ecologists to predict future states of biological diversity to aid the management of natural communities, thus introducing a number of significant challenges. One major challenge is considering how the many interacting features of biological systems, including ecophysiological processes, plant life histories, and species interactions, relate to performance in the face of a changing environment. We have employed a functional trait approach to understand the individual, population, and community dynamics of a model system of Sonoran Desert winter annual plants. We have used a comprehensive approach that connects physiological ecology and comparative biology to population and community dynamics, while emphasizing both ecological and evolutionary processes. This approach has led to a fairly robust understanding of past and contemporary dynamics in response to changes in climate. In this community, there is striking variation in physiological and demographic responses to both precipitation and temperature that is described by a trade-off between water-use efficiency (WUE) and relative growth rate (RGR). This community-wide trade-off predicts both the demographic and life history variation that contribute to species coexistence. Our framework has provided a mechanistic explanation to the recent warming, drying, and climate variability that has driven a surprising shift in these communities: cold-adapted species with more buffered population dynamics have increased in relative abundance. These types of comprehensive approaches that acknowledge the hierarchical nature of biology may be especially useful in aiding prediction. The emerging, novel and nonstationary climate constrains our use of simplistic statistical representations of past plant behavior in predicting the future, without understanding the mechanistic basis of change.",

    "126": "Hypertension (HTN) is a worldwide health problem and a major preventable risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) events. Achieving an optimal blood pressure (BP) target for patients with HTN will often require more than one BP-lowering drug. Combination therapy is not only needed, but also confers many advantages such as better efficacy and a better tolerability. A better compliance and simplicity of treatment is noted with the single-pill combination (SPC). In addition, for those patients who do not achieve BP target when receiving dual combinations, triple SPCs are now available, and their efficacy and safety have been tested in large clinical trials. BP-lowering drugs used in combination therapy should have complementary mechanisms of action, leading to an additive BP-lowering effect and improvement in overall tolerability, achieved by decreasing the incidence of adverse effects. On the basis of large, outcome-driven trials, preferred dual combinations include an angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) combined with a calcium channel blocker (CCB), or an ARB or ACEI combined with a diuretic. Acceptable dual combinations include a direct rennin inhibitor (DRI) and a CCB, a DRI and a diuretic, a beta-blocker and a diuretic, a CCB and a diuretic, a CCB and a beta-blocker, a dihydropyridine CCB and a non-dihydropyridine CCB, and a thiazide diuretic combined with a potassium-sparing diuretic. Some combinations are not recommended and may even be harmful, such as dual renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibition. Currently available triple SPCs combine a renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitor with a CCB and a diuretic. Combination therapy as an initial approach is advocated in patients with a systolic BP more than 20 mmHg and/or a diastolic BP more than 10 mmHg above target and in patients with high CV risk. In addition, using SPCs has been stressed and favored in recent international guidelines. Recently, triple SPCs have been approved and provide an attractive option for patients not achieving BP target on dual combination. The effect of such a strategy in the overall management of HTN, especially on further reducing the incidence of CV events, will have to be confirmed in future clinical and population-based studies.",

VK-II-36 is a novel carvedilol analog that suppresses sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release but does not block the \u03b2-receptor. The effect of VK-II-36 on SAN function remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether VK-II-36 can influence SAN automaticity by inhibiting the Ca(2+) clock. We simultaneously mapped intracellular Ca(2+) and membrane potential in 24 isolated canine right atriums using previously described criteria of the timing of late diastolic intracellular Ca elevation (LDCAE) relative to the action potential upstroke to detect the Ca(2+) clock. Pharmacological interventions with isoproterenol (ISO), ryanodine, caffeine, and VK-II-36 were performed after baseline recordings. VK-II-36 caused sinus rate downregulation and reduced LDCAE in the pacemaking site under basal conditions (P < 0.01). ISO induced an upward shift of the pacemaking site in SAN and augmented LDCAE in the pacemaking site. ISO also significantly and dose-dependently increased the sinus rate. The treatment of VK-II-36 (30 \u03bcmol/l) abolished both the ISO-induced shift of the pacemaking site and augmentation of LDCAE (P < 0.01), and it suppressed the ISO-induced increase in sinus rate (P = 0.02). Our results suggest that the sinus rate may be partly controlled by the Ca(2+) clock via SR Ca(2+) release during \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation.",

Adverse pulmonary vascular remodelling and chronic systemic inflammation characterize both diseases. Concurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The cornerstones of therapy are beta-blockers and beta-agonists, whose pharmacological properties are diametrically opposed. Each disease is implicated in exacerbations of the other condition, greatly increasing hospitalizations and associated health care costs. Such multimorbidity is a key challenge for health-care systems oriented towards the treatment of individual diseases. Early identification and treatment of cardiopulmonary disease may alleviate this burden. However, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies require further validation in patients with both conditions.", 
    "150": "Aquatic organisms are unintentionally exposed to a large number of pharmaceutical residues in their natural habitats. Ecotoxicological studies have agreed that these compounds are not harmful to aquatic organisms, as their environmental concentrations are typically too low. However, recent reports have shown biological effects at such low concentrations when biological endpoints related to the therapeutic effects are assessed. Therefore, conservation of molecular targets is now addressed as a key aspect for the development of more efficient test strategies for pharmaceutical environmental risk assessment, providing the rationale for the mode of action (MOA) approach. In the present study the MOA approach was used to investigate the interactive effects of fluoxetine (FX) and propranolol (PROP) on the Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis). Indeed, organisms in the environment are exposed to pharmaceutical mixtures throughout their lifetime, and particular combinations may be of concern. The antidepressant FX increases serotonin (5-HT) levels in the synaptic cleft by inhibiting 5-HT reuptake. PROP, a prototypical \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist, also blocks 5-HT1 receptors, which are negatively coupled to cAMP-mediated signaling. Cell signaling alterations potentially triggered by 5-HT1 receptor occupation were therefore assessed after a 7-day mussel exposure to FX or PROP, alone or in combination, each at 0.3 ng/L concentration. FX decreased cAMP levels and PKA activities in digestive gland and mantle/gonads, in agreement with an increased occupation of 5-HT1 receptors. PROP caused a decrease in cAMP levels and PKA activities in digestive gland and an increase in cAMP levels in mantle/gonads, consistent with a differential expression of adrenergic and 5-HT receptors in the two tissues. Co-exposure to FX and PROP provides significant indications for antagonistic effects of the pharmaceuticals, consistent with a direct (PROP) and indirect (FX) action on the same molecular target. Interestingly, FX induced over-expression of a 5-HT1 gene product, and PROP counteracted such increase when the mixture was administered, while having per se no effect. Finally, mRNA expression of the ABCB gene encoding the MXR-related transporter P-glycoprotein was reduced by both pharmaceuticals in the digestive gland, while decreased by FX, increased by PROP, and not affected by the mixture in mantle/gonads. Since transcription of this gene product is under cAMP/PKA modulation, the impairment of regulatory pathways triggered by low concentrations of pharmaceuticals have the potential to affect the ability of animals to elaborate strategies of defense or adaptation toward further stress factors. In this specific case, the pharmaceutical mixture limits the detrimental effects of the single compounds.",

This retrospective study explored the utility of a 24-hour hospitalization for the initiation of propranolol therapy in children with problematic IHs by evaluating the effects of systemic propranolol on hemodynamics and blood sugar levels. Thirty-one children were admitted to the hospital to begin oral propranolol at a dose of 2 mg/kg/per day. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and blood glucose (BG) measurements were obtained at baseline and 1 to 3 hours before and after each dose of propranolol. No caregivers reported any adverse effects during the hospitalization. On average, HR decreased by 5 beats per minute (bpm) (p < 0.01) and systolic BP decreased by 4 mmHg (p < 0.01) after propranolol administration. There was no statistically significant change in diastolic BP or BG with propranolol therapy. Over the first three doses of propranolol we saw statistically significant attenuation of the effects of propranolol on HR, with HR approaching baseline values during the hospitalization (p = 0.04). We did not see statistically significant changes in BP over the course of three doses of propranolol. This study suggests that 24-hour hospitalization with hemodynamic monitoring may not be necessary for safe initiation of propranolol therapy in otherwise healthy infants.

Bisoprolol was associated with fewer postoperative strokes than the less selective agents (odds ratio = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.04-0.91). Multivariable risk-adjustment in the \u03b2-blockers-exposed patients comparing bisoprolol with the less selective agents was associated with a similarly reduced stroke rate.", 
    "205": "The use of metoprolol and atenolol is associated with increased risks of postoperative stroke, compared with bisoprolol. These findings warrant confirmation in a pragmatic randomized trial.", 
    "206": "The Affordable Care Act creates financial incentives for hospitals to minimize readmissions shortly after discharge for several conditions, with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to be a target in 2015. We aimed to develop and validate prediction models to assist clinicians and hospitals in identifying patients at highest risk for 30-day readmission after PCI.", 
    "207": "We identified all readmissions within 30 days of discharge after PCI in nonfederal hospitals in Massachusetts between October 1, 2005, and September 30, 2008. Within a two-thirds random sample (Developmental cohort), we developed 2 parsimonious multivariable models to predict all-cause 30-day readmission, the first incorporating only variables known before cardiac catheterization (pre-PCI model), and the second incorporating variables known at discharge (Discharge model). Models were validated within the remaining one-third sample (Validation cohort), and model discrimination and calibration were assessed. Of 36,060 PCI patients surviving to discharge, 3760 (10.4%) patients were readmitted within 30 days. Significant pre-PCI predictors of readmission included age, female sex, Medicare or State insurance, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Post-PCI predictors of readmission included lack of \u03b2-blocker prescription at discharge, post-PCI vascular or bleeding complications, and extended length of stay. Discrimination of the pre-PCI model (C-statistic=0.68) was modestly improved by the addition of post-PCI variables in the Discharge model (C-statistic=0.69; integrated discrimination improvement, 0.009; P<0.001).", 
    "208": "These prediction models can be used to identify patients at high risk for readmission after PCI and to target high-risk patients for interventions to prevent readmission."
