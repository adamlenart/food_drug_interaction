    "0": "In vitro incubation studies with bovine parathyroid gland slices compared the relative responsiveness of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion to isoprotherenol, epinephrine or norepinephrine. Isoproterenol was the most potent and norepinephrine the least potent of the three stimuli, suggesting a beta 2 type of an adrenergic response. However in this in vitro system, tazalol, a selective beta 1 adrenergic agonist significantly stimulated PTH secretion, whereas terbutaline, a selective beta 2 agonist had no effect. In addition, practolol, a selective beta 1 adrenergic antagonist blocked isoproterenol- or tazolol-stimulated PTH secretion. In vivo studies in normal human subjects showed that injection of te nonselective beta agonist, isoproterenol, (0.15 mg s.c.) significantly increased, whereas injection of the selective beta 2 agonist, terbulatine (0.3 mg s.c.) had no effect on serum PTH levels. These latter studies with putative selective beta adrenergic agents suggest that the beta adrenergic receptor mediating PTH secretion is of the beta 1 type (in contrast to the studies above with nonselective agents). The studies suggest that the beta adrenergic receptor mediating PTH secretion apparently differs from the classical beta 1 receptor described in th myocardium or the classical beta 2 receptor described in the bronchial smooth muscle.", 
    "1": "Nadolol is a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug without intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilising activity. Its inherently long duration of activity makes it suitable for once daily administration in both hypertension and angina pectoris, and in these conditions it has been as effective as propranolol given in a traditional regimen 4 times daily. However, other beta-blocking drugs can also be given with reduced frequency, especially in hypertension; and some, such as atenolol (a longer acting 'cardioselective' agent) or long-acting preparations of other beta-blockers, have also been given once daily in angina prophylaxis. Nevertheless, nadolol is one of a few beta-blocking drugs which have clearly been shown to be effective in both hypertension and angina with once daily administration. Other specific properties of nadolol, such as its excretion entirely in unmetabolised form, may offer advantages over other existing beta-blocking drugs in specific patients, while some properties (such as lack of 'cardioselectivity') may be disadvantageous in others. The choice of a beta-blocking drug should thus be based on a knowledge of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the different beta-blocking drugs, and a careful consideration of how such properties can best be applied to benefit the individual patient.", 
    "2": "The two major urinary metabolites of 14C-timolol in man, involving oxidation and hydrolytic cleavage of the morpholine ring, are also observed in both Sprague-Dawley rats and CRCD-1 mice. These are the N-T(4-[3-(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-ylT-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine and 1-(1,1-dimethylethylamino-3-([4-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl]oxy)-2-propanol. The former was previously identified erroneously as the isomeric compound 1-(1,1-dimethylethylamino)-3-([4-(N-2-hydroxyethylglycolamido)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl]oxy)-2-propanol. Rats and mice had two additional metabolites in common, 1-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-3-([4-(2-hydroxy-4-morpholinyl)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl]oxy)-2-propanol and a compound now proposed to be the corresponding morpholino lactone 1-[1,1-dimethylethyl)-amino]-3-([4-(2-oxo-4-morpholinyl)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl]oxy)-2-propanol but for which the corresponding isomeric morpholino lactam structure 1-[(1,1-dimethylenthyl)-amino]-3-([4-(3-oxo-4-morpholinyl)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl]oxy))-2-propanol was tentatively proposed in an earlier publication. A metabolite observed in the rat, but not in the other species studied, was 4-(4-morpholinyl)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-ol-1-oxide. The metabolic pattern in these rodents does not change significantly after repeated doses. A scheme summarizing the metabolic fate of timolol in man and laboratory animals is presented.", 
    "3": "1 The pharmacological effects and the pharmacokinetics of betaxolol (SL 75212), a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were compared with those of propranolol and a placebo in a double-blind trial involving six healthy volunteers. 2 Heart rate (HR), myocardial contractile force (MCF), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured at rest and during vigorous exercise before and at intervals up to 25 h after oral administration of the drugs. In addition, plasma renin activity (PRA) at rest and blood levels of betaxolol and propranolol were determined. 3. Betaxolol proved to be a potent and long-lasting beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, devoid of intrinsic beta-sympathomimetic activity. Its beta-adrenoceptor blocking action was shown to four-fold that of propranolol at the cardiac and renal levels and to last at least 25 h after drug intake. 4 The peak blood level of betaxolol was reached 2 to 4 hr after its administration, the first-pass loss is likely to be low and the half-life is 12.3 h. These pharmacokinetic data are perfectly consistent with the long duration of the pharmacological effects of betaxolol in man.", 
    "4": "Intravenous injection of isoprenaline and salbutamol into rats caused an inhibition of the spontaneous contractions of uterus and increased the uterine cAMP level in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of isoprenaline (0.036 nmol/kg) were diminished or completely prevented by propranolol (0.07-7 mumol/kg). Intravenous infusion of the beta-adrenergic agonists during one hour increased the uterine cAMP level. The highest level of cAMP measured was at 3 min. after start of infusion, thereafter it declined first rather fast but later more slowly. This time pattern of cAMP was very similar to what was seen during incubation of uterine tissue with isoprenaline in vitro. Pretreatment with isoprenaline three times daily 4-7 days before the experiments, decreased both the degree of inhibition and the increase of cAMP in uterus caused by an intravenous injection of isoprenaline. A slight effect on the cAMP rise was detectable after one day of pretreatment, and it seemed to have reached its maximal effect after 4 days, since no further decline in the cAMP response was seen when the pretreatment was prolonged. A dessensibilization to beta-adrenergic agonists was thus seen in uterus after excessive stimulation of isoprenaline in vivo.", 
    "5": "CM6804 effect has been studied about some parameters of the intracellular action potential (AP) of guinea pig autorythmic auricle. Auricle was preserved alive under Tyrode oxygenated solution at 37 degrees C. AP is measured by a fluctuating intracellular glass microelectrode. At a concentration of 5 . 10(-5) M, CM doesn't alter the resting membrane potential, it causes a small overshoot reduction, it decreases the maximum depolarization rate and the heart rate, it increases the action potential duration. Overshoot and maximum depolarization rate decrease prove that CM modifies the membrane permeability probably by a diminution of the sodium rapid inward current. CM action is similar to others aryl-oxy-propyl propanolamine like propranolol.", 
    "6": "Labetalol has been used in 83 patients with severe hypertension resistant to a wide number of drugs. Adequate blood pressure control was achieved in 50 patients. Seven patients with a response in blood pressure had administration of the drug ceased because of side effects. Twenty-two of these resistant patients had little fall in blood pressure. Labetalol can be used safely in severe resistant hypertension and is indicated when a thiazide and beta-blocking drug has failed to reduce blood pressure.", 
    "7": "The effect of once-daily atenolol, sustained-release oxprenolol (a new formulation of oxprenolol presented as a compressed tablet in a waxed matrix), and long-acting propranolol (a new formulation presented as spheriods in a capsule) was studied in a double-blind crossover trial in 23 carefully selected hypertensive outpatients. After a run-in period with matching placebo each patient received atenolol (100 mg/day), sustained-release oxprenolol (160 mg/day), long-acting propranolol (160 mg/day), and placebo according to a randomised sequence. After four weeks' treatment with sustained-release oxprenolol blood pressure in the two to four hours before the next dose was not significantly lower than after placebo. The effectiveness of atenolol and of the new formulation of propranolol in reducing blood pressure was confirmed. These results suggest that the present formulation of sustained-release oxprenolol should be reconsidered.", 
    "8": "The reaction between 2,4-dichlorobenzeneboronic acid, 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzeneboronic acid or the 1,3-propanediamine derivatives of the boronic acids and the 3-isopropylaminopropan-2-ol side chain of the beta-blocking drugs occurs essentially as an on-column thermal reaction in the gas phase. Derivatization of the side chain of the beta-blocking drugs by transboronation is shown to be the method of choice for general application as it affects the detector background signal very little compared to the use of the boronic acid itself. The transboronation reaction can be used for the determination of alprenolol in plasma extracts with a detection limit of 2.5 ng ml-1 using the electron-capture detector. The ultimate sensitivity of the method is limited by the detector background signal resulting from some column decomposition of the transboronation reagent.", 
    "9": "Myocardial pH was measured continuously with a micro pH electrode inserted into the left ventricular wall in dogs. Anterior descending coronary flow was reduced to about 1/3 of the original flow by partial occlusion of the coronary artery. Myocardial pH decreased from 7.50--7.60 to 7.06--7.24 after partial occlusion. Drugs were injected intravenously during ischemia of the heart caused by partial occlusion. l-Propranolol (1 mg/kg) reduced heart rate and increased the pH from 7.06 +/- 0.04 to 7.48 +/- 0.04 (P less than 0.01). d-Propranolol (1 mg/kg) reduced heart non-significantly and increased the pH from 7.24 +/- 0.05 TO 7.56 +/- 0.05 significantly (P less than 0.05). In other studies, the effect of l- and d-propranolol on both heart rate and metabolic responses to isoproterenol (500 micrograms/kg i.p.) was studied. Isoproterenol increased heart rate and also elevated the blood levels of glucose and lactate. l-Propranolol inhibited these responses to isoproterenol. d-Propranolol did not inhibit the heart rate response but inhibited the blood lactate response to isoproterenol significantly. The blood glucose response to isoproterenol was inhibited by d-propranolol non-significantly. The action of both l- and d-propranolol on ischemic myocardial pH may be related to their action on cardiac metabolism as well as to their local anesthetic action.", 
    "10": "beta-Receptors were identified in rat brain by a light microscopic autoradiographic technique. The procedure involved binding 3H-labeled dihydroalprenolol to beta-receptors in intact slide-mounted tissue sections and generating autoradiograms by the apposition of emulsion-coated cover slips, Biochemical analysis of the binding indicated that these conditions provided a high degree of selective labeling of beta-receptors. High densities of receptors were found in superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, throughout the caudate-putamen, in the periventricular nucleus of the thalamus, in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, and in other areas. These results are in agreement with other electrophysiological and histochemical data. This radiohistochemical approach should be an important addition to other methods for mapping functional catecholamine neuronal pathways and sites of hormonal action.", 
    "11": "We report the possibility of treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents in glaucoma-therapy. In open-angle glaucoma the therapy with beta-adrenergic blocking agents is often the best one. The combination of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with miotics is the therapy of choice in the treatment of closure-angle glaucoma. In special forms of glaucoma it is necessary to decide if the best therapy is the treatment with beta-adrenergaic blocking agents alone or a combined treatment of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with miotics. The beta-adrenergic blocking agent timolol (Chibro-Timoptol) and bupranolol (Ophtorenin) lower in the intraocular pressure to a greater extent than other beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Timolol eye drops and bupranolol eye drops are therefore the best beta-adrenergic blocking agents in therpay of glaucoma.", 
    "12": "Not all functional types of headache are of psychogenic orgin. Many are due to minor irritative lesions or to refractory anomalies. Only a very small number of headache types can be regarded as psychogenic without further examination. In most cases functional and organic causes are involved. A detailed analysis of the evolution and localization of headache, together with thorough internal and neurological examinations are necessary to enable one to categorize a headache with any confidence. If depression and tension prevail, it is important to reduce the patient's consumption of painkillers by means of antidepressive agents, autogenic training or betablockers.", 
    "13": "The principal causes of death for persons aged between 55 and 64 years are identified from Australian mortality data for 1966 and 1977. Four conditions--ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, bronchial carcinoma, and chronic airways disease--account for 62% of deaths in this age group, with 36% of deaths being attributed to ischaemic heart disease. Changes in age-specific mortality rates during the period from 1966 to 1977 are described for each of these four conditions. There have been substantial reductions in mortality from vascular disease in both sexes, and this trend has accelerated since 1974. A recent fall in mortality from bronchial carcinoma and chronic airways disease is indicated for males, while death rates from these disorders continue to increase rapidly for females. The introduction of beta-blockade in the treatment of vascular disease, and changes in the pattern of cigarette smoking are discussed in relation to these mortality trends.", 
    "14": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the beta-blocking agent timolol on postganglionic cardiac and preganglionic splanchnic sympathetic and vagal neural discharge, ouabain-induced arrhythmia, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. Cats were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose, given atropine, and pretreated with timolol (5 mg/kg, i.v. infused at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min for 10 min). Bolus injections of ouabain (25 microgram/kg, i.v.) were given every 15 min until the animals died; the first injection was given 15 min after the end of the timolol infusion. When compared with cats (n = 13) receiving only ouabain, timolol (n = 11 cats) increased the time to ouabain-induced arrhythmia and death from 23 +/- 3 to 48 +/- 7 and 46 +/- 3 to 76 +/- 9 min, respectively (p less than 0.05). Both heat rate and mean arterial blood pressure had decreased from 137 +/- 4 to 104 +/- 6 beats/min and 133 +/- 6 to 103 +/- 7 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.05); ouabain did not reverse the decreases. Neural activity monitored from the vagus and from the postganglionic cardiac and preganglionic splanchnic sympathetic nerves was not significantly altered by the infusion of timolol. The administration of ouabain after timolol did not alter splanchnic nor vagal discharge. Most important was the observation that postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge exhibited both increases and decreases, i.e., a nonuniform neural discharge, at the time of ouabain-induced arrhythmia and that the ouabain-induced nonuniformity did not occur in the cats pretreated with timolol. Thus, the protective effect of timolol may be due, in part, to prevention of the nonuniform postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge and to the prevention of ouabain-induced increases in vagal discharge. The establishment of beta-blockade and a direct negative inotropic action may also have contributed to the antiarrhythmic action of timolol.", 
    "15": "A sensitive gas chromatographic method for the quantitative analysis of atenolol in human plasma and urine is described. Atenolol is extracted with dichloromethane containing heptafluorobutanol to improve the extraction ability. Derivatization with trifluoroacetic anhydride in diethyl ether gives a bistrifluoroacetyl derivative which is more selectively detected by an electron-capture detector than is the corresponding heptafluorobutyryl derivative. The method allows determination down to 20 nmol/l (5 ng/ml) in 1 ml of sample with a relative standard deviation below 10%.", 
    "16": "The indication for either digitalis or exercise-therapy has to be reevaluated continuously. Reserpine enhances the toxic effect of digitalis. Beta-receptorblockers and nitrates complement each other and should be administrated on a large scale (supplemented prophylactically by nitrocompounds before exercise). The monotherapy aimed at should be initiated with a beta-receptorblocker in patients up to 50 years of age. Diuretics are the second type of drugs. Exercise therapy is contraindicated absolutely in cases of complex ventricular extrasystoles and relatively contraindicated for simple ventricular extrasystoles.", 
    "17": "Digitonin-solubilized turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptors were reconstituted by dialysis into human erythrocyte acceptor membranes which lack beta receptors. Incorporation of turkey beta receptors into acceptor membranes was directly proportional to the quantity of soluble protein added to the reconstitution system. Reconstituted beta receptors demonstrate saturable [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding (Bmax = 11.1 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg, K = 77.8 +/- 8.6 pM) and stereospecificity ((-)-propranolol, K = 11.0 nM; (+)-propranolol, K = 2000 nM; (-)-isoproterenol, K = 250 nM; (+)-isoproterenol, K = 82 micro M). Reconstituted beta receptors appear to be incorporated into acceptor membranes as integral proteins. Reconstituted beta receptors cannot be extracted by high salt or pH (3 to 11); detergent is required for resolubilization of reconstituted beta receptors. Adenylate cyclase stimulation was not obtained in reconstituted membranes since acceptor membranes lack a catalytic subunit. However, guanine nucleotide regulation of agonist affinity was observed indicating a functional reconstitution. GTP (100 micro M) produces a 5-fold decrease in the affinity of isoproterenol for reconstituted beta receptors. Experiments with sulfhydryl reagents indicate that the reconstituted beta receptor couples with the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein of the acceptor membranes. These data describe the successful reconstitution of a beta receptor and indicate that the reconstituted beta receptor can interact with the GTP binding protein of human erythrocyte acceptor membranes.", 
    "18": "Nine uraemic patients not being treated by dialysis received intravenous propranolol 1 microgram/kg/min for 85 minutes after a priming dose of 1 mg. Fifteen days later, six of them received intravenous metoprolol 1.2 microgram/kg/min after a priming dose of 1.2 mg. Plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin fell significantly after propranolol but not after metoprolol, whereas no change in plasma concentrations of ionised calcium and phosphate occurred with either drug. Heart rate fell similarly with both drugs. The fact that propranolol acutely suppressed PTH and calcitonin secretion in uraemic patients indicates that further studies are warranted to assess the long-term effects of the drug on the secretion of these hormones and on renal osteodystrophy. The contrast between the responses to propranolol and metoprolol supports the concept that PTH and calcitonin secretion is modulated through specific beta 2-receptors.", 
    "19": "The catecholamine-propranolol antagonism was studied on guinea-pig papillary muscles. 1. A competition between propranolol and catecholamine, the latter subject to saturable elimination from the extracellular space, for a homogeneous populations of beta-adrenoceptors of the cellular surface does not suffice to explain the influence on the inotropic effects. 2. The antagonism was differentiated into a \"surmountable\" and an \"unsurmountable\" component by means of the stereospecific influence of propranolol on maximal catecholamine effects in regard to velocity of contraction and acceleration of relaxation. The \"unsurmountable\" component was explained by a competition for intracellular beta-adrenoceptors, in addition to the competition at the beta-adrenoceptors of the cellular surface (\"surmountable\" component).", 
    "20": "Leftventricular parameters of pressure, volume and contractility were recorded in the guinea pig treated with propranolol and digoxin. Propranolol shifts the isovolumetric pressure-volume-relation to higher enddiastolic volume. Pressure, rate of pressure rise, and heart rate considerably decrease. Cardiodepression of high-dose propranolol treatment is reversed in part by digoxin. Conclusions for application of beta-blockers, especially in imparied ventricular function, are discussed.", 
    "21": "The author reports the regulation of IOP in 31 patients using Timolol maleate. The patients were suffering from various forms of Glaucoma. It proved possible to stabilize IOP in 21 patients during clinical treatment. Follow-ups were continued for up to 31 weeks after discharge.", 
    "22": "Myocardial substrate extraction, coronary sinus flow, left ventricular pressure, and cardiac output were measured in 11 patients with angina pectoris at three pacing rates before and after atenolol (0.2 mg/kg). Left ventricular pressures, and the product of systolic pressure time index and heart rate did not change, but max dP/dt and KV max fell after atenolol. Only at the lowest pacing rate did the drug reduce cardiac output. Coronary sinus blood flow and myocardial oxygen uptake did not change after atenolol. At the highest pacing rate before atenolol four patients developed angina, accompanied by a rise in end-diastolic pressure. After atenolol angina was abolished in three, but the end-diastolic pressure still rose at the highest pacing rate. Myocardial lactate extraction ratio fell as heart rate increased, and was lower in the patients who developed angina. After atenolol, lactate extraction ratio increased significantly at the highest and lowest pacing rates. Myocardial pyruvate extraction rose after the drug. Arterial concentrations of hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate fell after atenolol, but the decrease in their extraction was not significant. Myocardial extraction of free fatty acids was related to arterial concentration, which fell after atenolol. The changes in lactate and pyruvate extraction after atenolol were related inversely to changes in arterial free fatty acid concentration suggesting that the improvement in myocardial metabolism could have been secondary to reduced peripheral lipolysis. The increase in lactate extraction was associated with relief of angina, but did not abolish the rise in end-diastolic pressure induced by pacing.", 
    "23": "Urinary excretion of prostaglandin E (PGE) in 8 patients with Bartter's syndrome measured by the radioimmunoassay method was not augmented over the normal values. In one of them, urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, chloride and PGE, serum sodium, potassium and chloride, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were studied before and after the administration of propranolol, spironolactone, indomethacin and potassium chloride. Neither propranolol nor spironolactone affected any of these parameters. Indomethacin promptly reduced urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, chloride and PGE, and markedly suppressed the renin-aldosterone system. Serum potassium was elevated, but remained still in hypokalemic range. Potassium chloride was most effective in raising the serum potassium level during the first 4 weeks of administration. These results suggest that overproduction of renal PGs is not the primary cause of Bartter's syndrome, and that the renal potassium wastage is one of the etiological factors in this syndrome. It has also been suggested that hyperreninemia in this syndrome was associated in some way with renal PGs, not PGE but other series of PGs.", 
    "24": "Aromatic hydroxylation of oxprenolol administered ip to rats produced 4'- and 5-hydroxyoxprenolol in 9.4% and 2.8% of the administered dose, in a ratio of ca. 3.5 to 1, as determined after deconjugation of the urinary metabolites by 8-glucuronidase. After HPLC separation, the metabolites were determined by mass spectral (CIMS) techniques using specifically deuterated 4'- and 5'-hydroxyoxprenolol-d2 as standards. From in vivo metabolic experiments using a pseudoracemate of oxprenolol prepared from (2R)-oxprenolol-d2 and (2S)-oxprenolol-d0, greater 4'-hydroxylation of the (2R)-enantiomer was shown to occur by 3.1 fold, and greater 5'-hydroxylation also of the (2R)-enantiomer occured by 1.4 fold. These results could occur because of stereoselectivity in the metabolic hydroxylation process and/or could reflect possible enantiomeric enrichment of the oxprenolol presented to the liver due to stereoselective tissue binding of the (2S)-enantiomer or could be due to stereoselectivity in the metabolism of oxprenolol by one or more competing pathways.", 
    "25": "Hemodynamic changes during the cold pressor test were examined in Type I labile (juvenile labile) hypertensive patients, Type II labile (middle aged labile) hypertensive patients, established hypertensive patients and normal subjects. In normal, Type I labile hypertensive and established hypertensive subjects, the pressor response during the test was accounted for chiefly by a rise in peripheral resistance. In Type II labile hypertensive patients, an increase in blood pressure during cold stimuli was accompanied by an augmented cardiac output. Therefore, Type II labile hypertension is separated clearly from other types of hypertension with respect to hemodynamic changes during the test. In Type II labile hypertensive patients, however, diazepam reduced an increase in cardiac output during the test, resulting in hemodynamic changes similar to those of normal subjects. After atropinization, the hemodynamic pattern of Type I and established hypertensives changed similar to that of Type II labile patients during the cold pressor test. It is concluded that an excessive cardiac output caused by the cold stimuli is a distinctive hemodynamic characteristics of Type II labile hypertensive patients, and this distinctive hemodynamic characteristics might be due to the decreased parasympathetic tone.", 
    "26": "The effects of oxprenolol on blood pressure levels, pulmonary ventilatory function, myocardial contractility and myocardial oxygen consumption are described in 66 patients with essential hypertension and no clinical evidence of obstructive lung disease of heart failure. Two groups of patients were treated with medication for a total of 16 weeks. Group 1 received oxprenolol and diuretics for the first eight weeks and a placebo plus diuretics for the second eight weeks. Group 2 received the same drugs in reverse order. The results of the study indicate that oxprenolol is an effective antihypertensive drug that does not hamper lung volume capacity or myocardial contractility and markedly reduces myocardial oxygen consumption, although it may cause a mild increase in airway resistance.", 
    "27": "Observations were made in 5 healthy subjects who exercised before and 1, 3, 6, 8 and 24 h after the oral administration on separate occasions of 160 mg oxprenolol, 160 mg slow release oxprenolol, 160 mg long acting propranolol and 400 mg sotalol. Blood samples were obtained before and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h after drug administration and assayed for drug concentration. Although the plasma concentration of oxprenolol after S.R. oxprenolol was significantly less at 1 and 2 h and significantly greater at 24 h than after conventional oxprenolol, there was little difference between the effects of the two drugs on an exercise tachycardia. The plasma level of propranolol and the reduction in an exercise tachycardia after L.A. propranolol increased slowly to reach a peak at 6 h and then declined gradually to 24 h. The maximum plasma concentration and effect after sotalol occurred at 3 h and then declined with an elimination half-life of 12.1 h. At 24 h the percentage reduction in an exercise tachycardia was 8.3 +/- 2.5 after oxprenolol, 10.0 +/- 2.3 after S.R. oxprenolol, 18.0 +/- 3.2 after L.A. propranolol and 14.7 +/- 3.4% after sotalol.", 
    "28": "Six schizophrenic patients received propranolol hydrochloride to evaluate pharmacological, endocrinological, and antipsychotic properties of the drug. They had previously been unsuccessfully treated with phenothiazines. After a drug-free period of two weeks, propranolol was administered in gradually increasing doses. After two to four weeks, a low dose of phenothiazines was added. The clinical effect was evaluated using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale. Three of the six patients showed a definite improvement with propranolol therapy given as a sole treatment. Propranolol in plasma was positively correlated to dosage. The proportion of its major metabolite, 4-hydroxy-propranolol, decreased with increasing drug dose. Melatonin and prolactin levels in serum decreased noticeably with propranolol treatment. When phenothiazines were added, prolactin increased above drug-free levels. These results support the view that propranolol has an antipsychotic potential that needs further evaluation in clinical trials.", 
    "29": "Timolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, recently became available for the treatment of glaucoma. We report the occurrence of acute bronchospasm in a previously asymptomatic asthmatic patient following topical use of timolol. Therapy with the drug was discontinued, and four weeks later the patient was challenged with two drops of 0.5% timolol. A 25% decrease in forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) was demonstrated at one hour. The fall in FEV1 was even greater (47%) when the patient was rechallenged with four drops. We emphasize the need to avoid topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents in asthmatic patients.", 
    "30": "To determine whether beta blockers prevent the more rapid onset of effort angina during the postprandial state, metoprolol 100 mg was given before and after an 800-calorie meal in 12 male patients with stable angina and coronary artery disease. Three graded treadmill exercise tests were done daily on 2 days. After an overnight fast the first test on each day was done after a placebo to detect day-to-day variations. The second test was done 90 min after metoprolol or placebo given orally in a double-blind randomized fashion. Immediately thereafter the patients ate their meal and did their third test 30 min later. There was no significant difference between the first test on each day. After placebo the postprandial state was associated with an earlier onset of effort angina (310 and 370 sec, p less than 0.01) and with greater heart rate and systolic blood pressure rises for any work load. After metoprolol, however, there was no significant difference between the pre- and postprandial findings. During the postprandial state metoprolol delayed the onset of angina more than placebo (385 and 310 sec) and positive electrocardiogram (310 and 228 sec) and induced lowering of maximal heart rate (120 and 144 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (157 and 187 mm Hg) (p less than 0.01). Metoprolol slowed the rapid onset of effort agina during the postprandial state.", 
    "31": "The kinetics and dose-response characteristics of metoprolol were examined in a series of hypertensive patients. In 14 the elimination half-life of metoprolol after single 100-mg doses (4.1 +/- 0.6 hr) was prolonged (p less than 0.05) after 6 to 12 wk of therapy (5.6 +/- 0.7 hr). In 5 patients receiving 100 mg twice daily evidence of nonlinear metoprolol kinetics emerged, because the area under the concentration-time curve at steady state was 86.8% more (p less than 0.02) than predicted from a single dose. Kinetic data from single doses of metoprolol appear to be a poor predictor of steady-state kinetics. Single metoprolol dosage also induced a fall (p less than 0.01) in blood pressure with pretreatment levels (163/108), reaching a minimum at 5 hr (133/189). During long-term therapy incremented doses of metoprolol between 100 and 600 mg/day in 34 hypertensive patients resulted in a relatively horizontal dose-response curve at doses above 200 mg/day.", 
    "32": "The relationship between plasma levels of 4 propranolol metabolites--naphthoxylactic acid (NLA), 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH), naphthoxyacetic acid (NAA), and propranolol glycol (PG)--and propranolol plasma levels was determined in healthy, adult male subjects after increasing single oral doses of propranolol. NLA was present at plasma levels 6 to 25 times that of propranolol. More than 90% of circulating NLA was in the plasma fraction, where it was 95% protein bound. The ratio of plasma concentrations of the pharmacologically active metabolite 4-OH to propranolol approached unity 0.5 hr after propranolol, 160 mg or 320 mg orally, but fell rapidly. Plasma levels of NAA were in the same range as propranolol, especially as time progressed. PG circulated at plasma levels less than 12% of propranolol. As oral doses of propranolol were increased from 20 to 320 mg, there was a decrease in intrinsic plasma clearance (Cli) from 425 to 200 1/hr. Half-life rose from 3 to 5 hr. Urinary recovery of 4-OH fell as Cli rose. Urinary recovery of propranolol conjugates, NLA, and N-desisopropylpropranolol (NDIPP) rose as Cli fell. Our results suggest that naphthalene ring oxidation of propranolol represents a high-affinity low-capacity enzymatic pathway(s) that plays an important role in the extensive hepatic extraction of propranolol after small doses orally. Plasma NLA and plasma NAA were determined before and after hemodialysis in 14 uremic patients receiving long-term propranolol therapy. Mean plasma NLA was 4.372 ng/ml, and mean plasma NAA level was 238 ng/ml when mean plasma propranolol level was 15 ng/ml.", 
    "33": "Seven healthy subjects were given oral propranolol (1 mg/kg) alone or in combination with hydralazine 25, 50, or 100 mg on separate occasions. Hydralazine induced variable increases in the peak concentrations (p less than 0.05) and in the area under the propranolol concentration: time curves (p less than 0.02) without change in the recovery of 14 C-propranolol/metabolites in urine or in the systemic clearance of propranolol; i.e., oral hydralazine enhanced the systemic availability of propranolol by alteration of \"first-pass\" (hepatic) clearance. The results indicate the possibility of change in presystemic clearance without reciprocal change in systemic clearance and also suggest that propranolol or any other high-clearance drug should be administered in fixed relationship to hydralazine and other drugs capable of altering \"first-pass\" hepatic extraction (either due to alteration in splanchnic blood flow or competitive inhibition of metabolism) if large variations in plasma concentrations are to be avoided.", 
    "34": "Effects of hypoxia on arterial tone, efflux of potassium, and efflux of norepinephrine were monitored for isolated canine coronary arteries labeled with radioactive potassium (42K) and norepinephrine (3HNE). Hypoxia elicited transient relaxation and subsequent sustained contraction accompanied by marked increases in the effluxes of 42K and 3HNE. After sympathetic nerve injury with 6-hydroxydopamine or cold storage, arteries responded to hypoxia with sustained relaxation. Sustained relaxation occurred also after pretreatment with L-propranolol, but not with D-propranolol or phentolamine. Inhibition of hypoxic contraction by L-propranolol did not alter 42K or 3HNE efflux. Colchicine, an inhibitor of the exocytosis of NE, suppressed hypoxic 3HNE efflux and contraction, but not 42K efflux. Proadifen inhibited 42K and 3HNE efflux as well as contraction. During proadifen-inhibited 42K efflux, exogenous K+ augmented overflow of 3HNE, indicating that proadifen relaxed the hypoxic artery primarily by inhibiting K+-dependent exocytosis of NE. The ratio of NE to dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was similar in effluents from oxygenated arteries exposed to elevated K+ concentrations and in effluents from hypoxic arteries. Thus, hypoxia evoked exocytotic release of norepinephrine which promoted contraction by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "35": "Sixty-one consecutive men, mean age 56 years, who fulfilled criteria for unstable angina and who responded to medical therapy, underwent submaximal exercise testing prior to hospital discharge and at least 3 days after their last episode of angina. Forty-two patients were receiving propranolol at the time of exercise. Submaximal exercise was targeted to 120 beats/minute and strict criteria for the premature termination of each study were followed. Follow-up data were available on 55 patients post-discharge over a period of 6 to 36 weeks. No patient suffered recurrence of unstable angina or myocardial infarction due to the exercise test. Exercise was prematurely terminated by an ischemic response (chest pain and/or ST segment changes) in 34 patients (56%) and by leg fatigue in 13 patients (21%). Only five patients had exercise-induced ventricular ectopic activity, four of whom were not receiving propranolol. Nine patients achieved the target heart rate. Exercise-induced abnormal electrocardiographic changes predicted the postdischarge recurrence of episodes of unstable angina (p less than 0.05). Comparison of predischarge submaximal exercise data with postdischarge maximal exercise shows that recovery in cardiovascular function after unstable angina occurs soon after stabilization and prior to the submaximal test.", 
    "36": "The effect of intravenous adrenaline and of alpha and beta blockade on muscle blood flow in the tibialis anterior muscle of 8 normal subjects and 8 patients with the Becker form of X-linked muscular dystrophy has been assessed using the 133Xe clearance method. Whereas beta receptor responses to stimulation by adrenaline and blocking by propranolol did not differ significantly in the Becker patients and normal controls, the degree of alpha receptor blockade produced by phentolamine was significantly less in the Becker patients, suggesting a quantitative or qualitative abnormality of vascular alpha receptors. This pattern of response was not found in patients with spinal muscular atrophy or polymyositis. The possible significance of these findings is considered.", 
    "37": "The soleus, a slow-contracting, and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL), a fast-contracting muscle, from the guinea-pig were prepared for measurement of isometric contractions in vitro. Insulin, 2.5-55 mu/ml, caused a dose-dependent depression of twitches and subtetanic concentrations of the soleus muscle similar to and additive with that produced by the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, terbutaline. The effect of terbutaline but not that of insulin was blocked by propranolol. Insulin had no apparent effect on the contractions of the EDL, whereas terbutaline increased the force of contraction. When depressed by KCl, however, insulin partially restored the twitch tension in both muscles. The possible role of effects on the Na+-K+ transport is discussed.", 
    "38": "Twenty-one patients continued a double-blind crossover study to compare the prophylactic effect on migraine of propranolol and clonidine. The daily dosage of propranolol and clonidine was 160 mg and 100 microgram, respectively. Statistical analysis did not show any significant difference between the two drugs in respect to headache or nausea. The number of sickleave days and the use of symptomatic drugs were both less on propranolol treatment than on clonidine, but there was no statistically conclusive difference.", 
    "39": "The response of plasma renin activity (PRA) to frusemide, 40 mg given intravenously, was examined before and after oral propranolol 160 mg daily for seven days in normal and hypertensive subjects. Although basal PRA was reduced in many cases, the increase following frusemide was essentially unaltered by propranolol therapy. Evidence is presented that adequate beta adrenoceptor blockade was attained in these studies. Increasing the dose of propranolol to 240 mg daily for seven days in two subjects did not alter renin responsiveness to frusemide. Stimulation of renin release by oral frusemide, examined in one subject, was also unaltered by propranolol therapy. These findings indicate that enhancement of renin activity associated with diuretic use may not be prevented by concurrent propranolol administration. Limitation of the hypotensive action of combined beta blocker-diuretic therapy can therefore be expected. The fact that the renin stimulating effect of frusemide is preserved during beta blockade indicates that this procedure can be used in the investigation of hypertension even in those patients in whom discontinuation of beta blocking treatment may be undesirable.", 
    "40": "Fifty-five patients with recent acute myocardial infarction entered a single-blind cross-over trial to assess the effect of oral practolol 200 mg twice daily on the incidence and nature of ventricular arrhythmias in the first year following myocardial infarction. Patients had 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram tape monitoring at two weeks following infarction and at three-monthly intervals for one year. Twenty-six patients completed the full year of the trial with 12% of tape recordings technically unsatisfactory. A total of 46 periods of comparison of the action of practolol versus placebo therapy were available in thirty patients. Whilst receiving the selective beta adrenergic blocking agent, practolol, there was a significant reduction in the percentage of studied hours during which salvos of ventricular premature beats occurred (P < 0.025), however the percentage of patients in whom salvos were recorded was unchanged. The incidence of all other ventricular arrhythmias was not reduced in the practolol group. When the effect of practolol was related to the site of infarction, anterior or inferior, there was no significant reduction in the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "41": "No correlation was found between blood glucose and simultaneous measurements of plasma propranolol concentration in patients with schizophrenia, on a daily dose of 80 mg to 1800 mg of propranolol as an adjunct to phenothiazine medication. The Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) in ten patients on propranolol and phenothiazines did not differ significantly from those of a matched control group on phenothiazine alone. Two patients with mild diabetes showed no significant change in their GTT after stopping propranolol. These observations accord with the view that relatively high doses of propranolol as an adjunct to phenothiazine medication in schizophrenia are safe from the standpoint of glucose metabolism. This does not apply to the insulin dependent diabetic who is in danger of severe hypoglycaemia when glycogenolysis is blocked by propranolol.", 
    "42": "Penbutolol is a potent long-acting non-cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker with partial agonist activity. A double-blind cross-over comparison of penbutolol given in a single daily dose and propranolol given twice daily in the treatment of ambulant patients with moderate hypertension is described. Fourteen patients completed the study and were treated with each drug for 12 weeks. Penbutolol in daily doses of 20-120 mg and propranolol in daily doses of 80-400 mg produced similar significant reductions in both supine and erect blood pressure. Penbutolol did not reduce heart rate to the same extent as propranolol, in equivalent doses. Penbutolol appears to produce adequate control of moderate hypertension when administered once a day, and this effect appears to be equivalent to divided doses of propranolol. No serious adverse effects were reported, although one patient receiving penbutolol experienced severe eye pains at a dose of 40 mg which resolved on crossing over to treatment with propranolol.", 
    "43": "The chemistry, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, clinical studies, adverse effects, toxicology, indications, contraindications, drug interactions, and dosing of minoxidil, a recently approved antihypertensive agent, are reviewed. Minoxidil is an orally effective vasodilator that selectively relaxes peripheral arteriolar smooth muscle, Reflex tachycardia, renin stimulation, and sodium retention occur when minoxidil is used and so it requires the concomitant use of a diuretic and a sympathoplegic agent, usually a beta blocker. Hirsutism and pericardial effusions are additional adverse effects. Minoxidil is indicated in the management of severe hypertension in patients who do not respond to standard antihypertensive agents. In controlled and unctrolled studies, minoxidil was effective in patients with hypertension secondary to renal or renovascular disease and in patients with essential hypertension. Minoxidil is a potent antihypertensive agent with adverse effects that limit its use to patients resistant or intolerant to other drugs.", 
    "44": "1 Labetalol, an alpha- and beta- adrenoceptor blocking drug, was compared with acebutolol, alone or associated with dihydralazine in forty patients with moderate essential hypertension. 2 Labetalol (400--800 mg daily) seemed to have a slightly higher potency than acebutolol alone (400--800 mg daily). 3 Labetalol (1200--1600 mg daily) had the same potency as the combination of acebutolol (400--800 mg daily) and dihydralazine (50--100 mg daily). 4 Contrarily to acebutolol, the drop in blood pressure with labetalol was not correlated with initial plasma renin activity. 5 Labetalol side effects were minor and did not lead to drug withdrawal.", 
    "45": "Oxprenolol is an experimental beta adrenergic blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. To compare the effects of long-term administration of oxprenolol on hypertension and hemodynamics with the effects of propranolol, 20 patients with essential hypertension were divided in a double-blind random manner into two 10-patient groups and given placebo for 2 wk, followed by equipotent doses of oxprenolol or propranolol for 5 wk and by placebo for another 2 wk. Right heart cardiac catheterization was performed at the beginning and at the end of the 5-wk beta blockade. Heart rates and blood pressures fell markedly with both agents, although standing heart rate was lowered more by propranolol than by oxprenolol. Plasma renin activity was much lower after beta blockade with either drug. There was no correlation between decreases in blood pressure and renin activity. Although during the stress of repeat cardiac catheterization heart rates remained significantly lower than control, the intra-arterial pressures were not altered significantly by oxprenolol or propranolol, nor was there significant change in pulmonary pressure, vascular resistance, or cardiac output. Thus oxprenolol closely parallels the effects of propranolol in essential hypertension. The negative chronotropic action of both drugs is more marked than their antihypertensive activity.", 
    "46": "Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) has been considered to be predominantly under cholinergic-vagal control and may therefore serve as an indicator of vagal tone. We found similar basal plasma concentrations of PP in athletes with bradycardia and in untrained subjects. We further observed that physical exercise--an adrenergic situation--induces a several-fold rise in PP plasma concentration. Maximal plasma PP levels correlated positively with maximal blood pressure. The exercise-induced rise of PP was completely abolished by propranolol. These findings suggest that stimulation of the adrenergic system releases PP and that therefore plasma PP concentrations cannot be used to determine cholinergic-vagal activity.", 
    "47": "Sufentanyl is a newly developed potent, short-acting fentanyl-like morphinomimetic. No independent studies of the peripheral circulation during sufentanyl anesthesia are available. In the present study we compared the effects of sufentanyl and morphine on the peripheral perfusion in dogs. The effects of total beta-blockade during sufentanyl and morphine anesthesia were also evaluated. We elected to record skeletal muscle surface pH (m-pH) continuously as an index of the microcirculation and cellular fractions. Arterial and mixed venous blood gases and acid-base status were measured to determine the respiratory component of changes in m-pH. Hematocrits, plasma electrolytes and plasma proteins were analyzed in order to permit calculations of fluid-shifts between the blood and the interstitial fluid. Sufentanyl (0.01 mg/kg) had no adverse effects on the peripheral perfusion. Morphine (4 mg/kg) caused a severe and rapid fall in m-pH from 7.29 to 7.11 during the 30-min experimental period. At the same time, calculated blood volume decreased by 20%. This hypovolemic deterioration of the circulation was probably caused by a histamine-mediated increase in capillary pressure with filtration of plasma from the circulation to the interstitial fluid. Calculated systemic vascular resistance was not correlated to the quality of the peripheral perfusion. Propranolol administered during sufentanyl and morphine anesthesia did not influence the peripheral perfusion. On the basis of the present study we recommend human studies on sufentanyl, and discourage the use of high-dose morphine anesthesia.", 
    "48": "The developmental change of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat whole brain, except the cerebellum, was studied by binding assays with (--) 3H-dihydroalprenolol. The synaptic membrane fraction, prepared from 2-day-old and 6-week-old rat brains, had binding sites for (--) 3H-dihydroalprenolol, which seemed to represent physiological beta-adrenoceptors. The maximal binding capacity and the dissociation constant for (--) 3H-dihydroalprenolol of the synaptic membrane fraction did not vary with the age of the rats, but the yield of synaptic membrane fraction from the brain of 2-day-old rats was much less. Therefore, the total number of binding sites was less in 2-day-old rats. In addition, there was a significant difference in the inhibitory effects of 1-isoproterenol on binding of (--) 3H-dihydroalprenolol to the synaptic membrane fractions in the 2-day as compared to the tissues from the 6-week-old animals. The developmental changes in the number and nature of beta-adrenoceptors may result in expression of catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "49": "1. Direct radioligand-binding techniques have been used to characterize and quantify adrenoreceptors in human peripheral lung tissue removed at thoracotomy from ten patients, nine of whom had evidence of obstructive airways disease. 2. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol was used to characterize beta-adrenoreceptor sites and [3H]prazosin to identify alpha-adrenoreceptor sites. Binding of both ligands showed saturability, high affinity, rapid kinetics, reversibility and stereospecificity. The rank order of agonists and antagonists inhibiting specific binding correlated well with known physiological potencies. Specificity of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding suggested that the population of lung beta-adrenoreceptors is predominantly of the beta 2 subtype.", 
    "50": "We used a beta-adrenergic antagonist, (-) 3H-dihydroalprenolol, to demonstrate binding sites in purified rat kidney preparations that consistsed of plasma membranes of cells from tubules. The tubular origin of these plasma membranes was shown by electron microscopy and Na-K-ATPase enrichment. The binding was rapid (t1/2, 78 sec) and rapidly reversible (t1/2, 48 sec). The binding sites were saturable and bound 69.8 +/- (SD) 29.1 fmoles/mg of membrane protein. The binding was stereospecific with the isomers of beta-adrenergic agonists and beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, the (-) isomers being about 40 times more potent than the (+) isomers incompeting for these sites. (-) 3H-dihydroalprenolol had a high affinity for the binding sites, expressed by the mean equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) (KD, 7.1 nM). The beta-adrenergic antagonist (-) propranolol also showed high affinity (KD, 62.8 nM). The order of potency for inhibition of binding by beta-adrenergic agonists was: (-) isoproterenol (KD, 0.66 microM) greater than (-) epinephrine (KD, 4.3 microM) greater than or equal to (-) norepinephrine (KD, 13.5 microM). Conclusion. The (-) 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding sites in the rat kidney tubular cell membrane are beta-adrenergic receptor of the beta1 subgroup.", 
    "51": "Ovariectomized post-partum rats exhibit in vivo continuous stable myometrial activity with a frequency of 45--50 pressure cycles per h, and a mean maximum amplitude of 45--50 mmHg for many days. Oestradiol benzoate (5 micrograms) reduced the frequency of intra-uterine pressure cycles to 5 cycles per h by 20 h after treatment. The decrease in frequency was due to increased periods of uterine quiescence. Pretreatment with reserpine caused significant reductions in the concentration of uterine adrenaline and noradrenaline as measured by a fluorometric assay but had no effect on the extent or time-course of oestrogen-induced myometrial quiescence. Neither intravenous infusion of the adrenergic beta-blocker, propranolol, altered the extent or the time-course of the reduction of intra-uterine pressure cycles after oestrogen treatment. These results suggest that the mechanism by which oestrogen induces myometrial quiescence does not involve adrenaline mediation or alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor activation.", 
    "52": "Phentolamine, a blocker of alpha-adrenoceptors, given in a single dose (one hour before or 30 minutes, 8 and 24 hours after liver resection) decreased the mitotic index and the coefficient of mitotic phases, and elevated the glycogen content. The number of two-nucleated cells in rats exposed to phentolamine rose 8 hours after resection (p < 0.05). Obsidan, a blocker of beta-adrenoceptors, administered at the same periods, increased the mitotic index and the coefficient of mitotic phases. It is suggested that phentolamine prolonged the late mitotic phases, inhibiting the entry of the cells into mitosis. Obsidan elicited an opposite effect.", 
    "53": "Experiments were performed on inhalation-sensitized guinea-pigs, with the use of immunoallergic neurohistochemical techniques. Anaphylactic tracheobronchial spasm was shown to be related not only to the degree of sensitization but also to the state of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors. Sensitization, in its turn, changed the function of adrenoreceptors. It increased histamine sensitivity and decreased catecholamine sensitivity of an isolated organ."
