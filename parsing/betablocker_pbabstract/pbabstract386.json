    "1": "The combined effects of microwave radiation and some drugs were studied in an isolated frog auricle preparation. The experiments established that exposure to pulse-modulated 915 MHz microwaves for up to 40 min had no effect on either the rate or the amplitude of spontaneous auricle twitches, unless the average absorbed power was high enough to produce preparation heating. Treatment of the preparation with saline containing (0.6-3.0) 10(-5) M of propranolol or (0.5-1.5) 10(-7) M of atropine altered neither its pacemaker nor its contractile functions; these drugs also had no effect when they were combined with nonthermal microwave irradiation. Caffeine (1 mM) strongly increased the average heart power, which was calculated as the product of twitch rate and amplitude. The caffeine effect appeared to be significantly augmented (by about 15%, P < 0.02) under exposure to burst-type pulsed microwaves (pulse width, 1.5 msec; pause, 2.5 msec; 8 pulses/burst, 16 bursts/s; average SAR, 8-10 W/kg). By itself, this modulation was not effective; the heating of the preparation and saline during exposure was approximately 0.1 degrees C, which could not account for the detected changes. The experimental results demonstrate that caffeine treatment increases the microwave sensitivity of the frog auricle preparation and reveals primarily subthreshold, nonthermal microwave effect.", 
    "2": "Secretory component (SC) acts as a transmembrane polymeric immunoglobulin receptor of epithelial cells and is known to bind to polymeric IgA and to contribute to the secretion of secretory IgA (sIgA). We describe a new biological function for free SC (FSC) by which the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and HLA-DR induced by interferon gamma (IFN gamma) is inhibited in human keratinocytes. This activity coincided with suppression of adenosine cyclic 3,5-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production in keratinocytes. Keratinocytes produced SC after stimulation with IFN gamma and this production was suppressed by the addition of H-7 or propranolol. The addition of propranolol resulted in prolongation of ICAM-1 expression on keratinocytes induced by IFN gamma. These results suggest that endogenously produced SC, as well as exogenously added FSC, acts as an inhibitor of IFN gamma. Therefore, our results suggest that SC plays an antiinflammatory role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases via inhibition in keratinocytes of IFN gamma induced expression of ICAM-1 and HLA-DR.",

Native antioxidants content and activity of antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase increased. Combination of corinfar (30-60 mg/day) with anapriline (80-120 mg/day) inhibits LPO and antioxidant defense activity to optimal leading to normalization of some LPO values and activity of antioxidant enzymes after the treatment.

    "5": "beta-Endorphin is an opioid peptide synthesized in the pituitary, hypothalamus, and immunocytes, known to affect immune responses both when added in vitro and when its synthesis is increased in vivo (e.g., during stress). We show here that, similar to its concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the release of the opioid peptide from these cells after stimulation with polyclonal mitogens such as PHA or Con-A is also age dependent. Moreover, the effect of both mitogens on Ca2+ homeostasis changes with age. Finally, the ionophore ionomycin and the Ca2+ ATPase blocker thapsigargin induce the same age related effect on beta-endorphin release. For these reasons, we suggest that calcium homeostasis might be important for the differences observed in the release of the opioid from cells obtained from younger (< or = 30 years) or older (> or = 45 years) volunteers.",

Initially, two dimensional echocardiography with color doppler examination, ambulatory Holter monitoring, multistage treadmill exercise test, transoesophageal pacing (TEP), recording of ASAECG and SAECG were made. Subsequently, pharmacologic autonomic system blockade was done by using intravenously propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg). The following time-domain parameters of ASAECG were calculated: the root mean square voltage for the last 10, 20, 30 ms of filtered P-wave (RMS 10, 20, 30) and time duration of filtered P-wave (PWD). Moreover, the following parameters of SAECG were analyzed: the root mean square voltage of the signals in the last 40 and 50 ms of the filtered QRS (RMS 40, 50), the total time duration of QRS(t-QRS) and the duration of low amplitude signals < 40 microV (LPD). The autonomic blockade did not change significantly the obtained values of RMS 10, 20, 30 in subjects with MVP as follows: RMS 10 from 5.5 +/- 2.9 microV to 6.3 +/- 2.4 microV, RMS 20 from 8 +/- 3.7 microV to 8.5 +/- 2.4 microV and RMS30 from 10.2 +/- 4.9 microV to 10.3 +/- 3.3 microV. On the other hand, also the values of RMS 10 did not change statistically significant after blockade in control group (from 5.8 +/- 2.2 microV to 5.6 +/- 1.7 microV, p > 0.05), but the values of RMS20 i RMS30 increased significantly in this group, respectively from 7 +/- 3.1 microV to 8.3 +/- 3 microV (p < 0.02) and from 8.4 +/- 3.1 microV to 10.1 +/- 3.6 microV, (p < 0.05). The values of PWD have changed differently in the examined groups being under the influence of the autonomic blockade: in group I decreased from 119 +/- 12 ms to 114 +/- 28 ms (p > 0.05), whereas in group II increased from 110 +/- 13 ms to 116 +/- 9 ms (p < 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Facilitatory effects of prenalterol and albuterol (beta 1- and beta 2-selective adrenergic agonists, respectively) in the absence and presence of propranolol (a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist), ICI 89,406 or ICI 118,551 (beta 1- and beta 2-selective adrenergic antagonists, respectively) on electrical stimulation-evoked release of 3H-NE from rat cerebral cortical slices were assessed. Albuterol (0.1-100 nM) increased evoked release of 3H-NE from the cerebral cortical slices with greater potency than prenalterol (1-100 nM). The beta 2-adrenergic antagonist ICI 118,551 (1 nM) and propranolol (50 nM) abolished the facilitatory effects of albuterol (0.1 and 10 nM). In contrast, the beta 1-adrenergic antagonist ICI 89,406 (1 nM) did not alter the release-enhancing effect of albuterol. Prenalterol (10 and 100 nM)-induced facilitation of evoked release of 3H-NE was abolished by ICI 118,551; propranolol reduced the effect of 10 nM prenalterol and abolished that of 100 nM prenalterol. ICI 89,406 inhibited the effect of 100 nM prenalterol without altering that of 10 nM prenalterol. Basal release of 3H-NE was not altered by the drugs used in this study. These results suggest that facilitation of 3H-NE release induced by beta-adrenergic agonists is mediated primarily by beta 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "8": "A closed chest catheter technique was used in dogs to examine the potential cardiac effects of alprenoxime, a potent new ocular antihypertensive agent. Alprenoxime was designed to undergo metabolic activation to the beta-blocker, alprenolol, specifically within the eye using hydrolase and reductase enzymes that reside in the iris-ciliary body. Previous studies in rabbits confirmed that intraocular pressure (IOP) significantly decreased after topically instilling ophthalmic drops of alprenoxime, while heart rates remained essentially unchanged after intravenous dosing. To further explore the safety and ocular specificity of this potential antiglaucoma drug, several cardiac electrophysiologic parameters were monitored during alprenoxime infusion in anesthetized dogs. In contrast to the pharmacologically significant increases (33-144%) measured after alprenolol or other previously tested beta antagonist infusion, the identical dose of alprenoxime had no effect on sinus cycle length (SCL), conduction times through the bundle of His and atrium (H and AH), or any other monitored cardiac electrophysiologic parameter. No changes greater than 6% from baseline were detected with alprenoxime infusion. Similarly, no beta-antagonist cardiac activity could be detected in isoproterenol stimulated dogs after alprenoxime. The results demonstrate that alprenoxime has no significant cardiac activity at doses much greater than potential therapeutic levels. The study provides further support that the new agent could be safely used in treating glaucoma.", 
    "9": "The three-dimensional solution structure of PMP-D2, a 35 amino acid peptide isolated from the insect Locusta migratoria, has been determined from two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy data. The structure calculations were performed from 222 NOE-derived interproton distances and 11 dihedral angles calculated from the JHN-H alpha coupling constants, using either a combination of distance geometry and restrained simulated annealing or by restrained simulated annealing alone. PMP-D2 contains three disulfide bridges that have been assigned from NMR data and structure calculations and independently confirmed using chemical and enzymatic methods. The core region of PMP-D2 adopts a compact globular fold, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, which consists of a short three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet involving residues 8-11, 15-19, and 25-29. Back-calculation of the NOESY spectra was used to validate the final structures. Analysis of the CD spectra of PMP-D2 under various conditions of ionic strength and in the presence of organic solvents demonstrates the high stability of this molecule. PMP-D2 was recently shown to inhibit Ca2+ currents. This activity is discussed based on the comparison of PMP-D2 three-dimensional structure with the recently established three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+ channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA.",

    "14": "A prolonged rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) may be associated with an increased risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death, particularly in patients with the hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS), myocardial ischemia, or antiarrhythmic medication toxicity. It is known that there are some patients with LQTS who sometimes have a borderline or normal QTc (< or = 0.45 second). Although the QTc has been the standard measurement of ventricular repolarization, it includes both depolarization and repolarization and may not always be a sensitive indicator of the type of repolarization abnormalities seen in LQTS. Intraventricular conduction abnormalities complicate evaluation of the QTc interval. The rate-corrected JT interval (JTc) is a more accurate measurement of ventricular repolarization, and therefore may be a more sensitive means of assessing abnormalities. The QTc on a resting electrocardiogram was determined in 40 patients with LQTS and in 31 patients with right bundle branch block after tetralogy of Fallot repair. These were compared with 1,000 age-matched control subjects. The right bundle branch block group had normal JT and JTc measurements, despite having prolonged QT and QTc intervals compared with controls. The JTc identified 85% of patients affected with LQTS compared with only 58% identified using only the QTc as a marker for the syndrome. The JTc is a more specific measurement of ventricular repolarization than the QTc by eliminating QRS duration variability. It appears to be a more sensitive predictor of repolarization abnormalities, and may be helpful in identifying patients with LQTS who have borderline or normal QTc measurements on resting electrocardiograms.", 
    "15": "Coronary artery disease is an increasingly common medical problem in the elderly, and relatively few studies investigating drug therapy focus on this population. To assess the efficacy and safety of the calcium channel blocker, felodipine, and isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN), as adjunct to optimal beta-blocker therapy in elderly patients, a placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted in 46 patients, aged between 65 and 80 years, with documented stress-induced angina pectoris and myocardial ischemia. With use of a latin-square design, with 3 periods of 4 weeks each, exercise testing was performed after each period. Felodipine, 5 mg once daily, significantly improved both time to ischemic threshold and pain threshold (p = 0.02 and p = 0.003, respectively, vs placebo), and tended to increase total exercise time (p = 0.06 vs placebo). In contrast, ISMN, 20 mg twice daily, did not significantly affect these parameters. Comparison of the 2 active treatment arms showed that, overall, felodipine was more effective than ISMN, with a statistically significant difference for time to ischemic threshold (p = 0.02). With regard to safety, felodipine was also better tolerated than ISMN, which led to more patients discontinuing study medication with ISMN (p < 0.05 between ISMN and felodipine). It is concluded that in elderly patients who are treated with optimal beta blockade, felodipine, but not ISMN, leads to an additional significant reduction in ischemic parameters during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "The chronotropic cardiac effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) were studied in the conscious dog with chronic atrioventricular block. NPY (0.2-5 micrograms/kg i.v.) produced no effect on atrial cycle length (ACL), and increased ventricular cycle length (VCL) and mean arterial blood pressure (MBP). After atropine, NPY produced no effect on ACL and increased MBP. At 0.2 microgram/kg, it shortened VCL, whereas at 1 and 5 micrograms/kg, it lengthened this parameter. After pindolol, NPY produced no effect on ACL, shortened VCL and increased MBP. These results indicate that in the conscious dog, NPY (0.2-5 microgram/kg i.v.) does not exert any chronotropic effect on the sinoatrial node, most likely because of competition between opposite chronotropic effects and/or absence of specific NPY receptors in the sinoatrial node. They also suggest that the ventricular bradycardic effects produced by NPY result mainly from a reflex withdrawal of beta-adrenergic tone and that its ventricular tachycardic effects result from a direct action of NPY on specific receptors located in the His bundle.", 
    "17": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of experimental conditions on the concentrations of atenolol and acetaminophen in brain microdialysate, and to investigate the feasibility of performing repeated experiments within individual rats. Following intravenous bolus administration, reproducible concentration-time profiles were obtained in plasma and in brain dialysate. Based on corrections for in vitro recoveries of the intracerebral probe, the estimated ratio of the AUC in brain extracellular fluid (AUCbrain ECF) over the AUC in plasma (AUCplasma) +/- S.E.M. was 3.8 +/- 0.6% (n = 6) for atenolol and 18 +/- 2% (n = 6) for acetaminophen. Upon intracerebroventricular administration, interanimal differences in kinetics of acetaminophen in brain dialysate were observed while the concentrations of atenolol were below the detection limit of the assay. The influence of the use of isotonic versus hypotonic perfusate solutions on AUCbrain ECF values after intravenous bolus administration of both drugs was determined. Repeated experiments with the isotonic perfusate (24, 48 and 78 h post-surgery) resulted in AUCbrain ECF values with the ratio of 100: 98: 76% for acetaminophen and 100: 103: 98% for atenolol. Using a hypotonic perfusion solution the ratio of AUCbrain ECF values was 100: 154: 114% for acetaminophen and 100: 378: 427% for atenolol. A clear effect of the temperature of the hypotonic perfusate (24 vs 38 degrees C) on acetaminophen AUCbrain ECF values was revealed. The ratio of AUCbrain ECF values obtained at 24: 38 degrees C was 192: 100%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "The effects of different groups of substances (beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, Ca2+ channel blockers and vasodilators) which are known to have antiischemic properties were studied on veratridine-induced hypercontracture. Veratridine increases Na+ influx by slowing the inactivation process of the Na+ channel, thereby inducing a continuously increased Na+ entry in depolarized cells. Veratridine (6.3 x 10(-6) M) produced a change in cell shape from rod-shape to round, resulting from hypercontracture of cells. Before treatment with veratridine the proportion of rod-shaped cells was 70% and fell to 0% 5 min after the treatment with veratridine. dl-Propranolol, d-propranolol, l-penbutolol, d-penbutolol, nisoldipine, and dilazep all inhibited veratridine-induced hypercontracture dose dependently. In contrast, acebutolol, atenolol, timolol, nifedipine, diltiazem, and nitroglycerin did not inhibit the rounding of cells. Concomitantly with the rounding of cells, the [Ca2+]i was increased by veratridine. dl-Propranolol, d-propranolol and dilazep prevented the increase of [Ca2+]i induced by veratridine, whereas timolol and nitroglycerin did not. These results show that dl-propranolol, d-propranolol, l-penbutolol, d-penbutolol, nisoldipine, and dilazep possess Na+ channel blocking actions on the veratridine-modified Na+ channel, thereby preventing excessive Na+ influx and secondary Ca2+ overload.", 
    "19": "Conscious rats exposed to 5 bar (500 kPa) ambient pressure show increased total myocardial blood flow (TMBF) and enhanced cardiac contractility in spite of unaltered mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (CO). Four groups of awake, adapted rats were given injections of atenolol at 1 bar air or 5 bar normoxic N2, or both. Atenolol injected at 1 bar caused a marked reduction of HR, MAP, peak left ventricular pressure (LVP), and rate of LVP rise (+dP/dt) and fall (-dP/dt). In spite of beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade, ambient pressure rise increased HR, LVP, +dP/dt, -dP/dt, TMBF, and calculated cardiac O2 consumption (P < 0.05). A second atenolol injection at 5 bar caused a brief reduction in HR but did not affect cardiac contractility. Rats receiving the first atenolol injection at 5 bar demonstrated unchanged TMBF. We conclude that beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade does not annual the increase in cardiac contractility associated with hyperbaria.", 
    "20": "The time course of beta adrenergic receptor adaptation in response to chronic imipramine treatment (10 or 20 mg/kg) was assessed by quantitative autoradiographic analysis of 125I-pindolol binding in rat brain. Binding of the radioligand was assessed in 18 brain areas, including subregions of the hippocampus, amygdala, septum, hypothalamus and specific cerebral cortical regions. After only 2 days treatment with imipramine at a dose of 20 mg/kg, select cortical regions exhibited a reduction in 125I-pindolol binding. These rapidly adapting cortical regions included the medial prefrontal, lateral frontal, ventrolateral orbital and piriform cortices. After 7 or 21 days treatment with imipramine at 20 mg/kg, 16 of 18 brain regions examined exhibited significant reduction in 125I-pindolol binding. The only regions examined that did not show reduced 125I-pindolol binding for these treatment conditions were the caudate-putamen and anterior hypothalamic area. After 2 days treatment with 10 mg/kg of imipramine, down-regulation of beta adrenergic receptors was not observed in any region. After 7 days treatment with 10 mg/kg, down-regulation of beta adrenergic receptor binding was found only in certain cortical regions: medial prefrontal, lateral frontal, ventrolateral orbital and piriform cortices. Thus, the cortical regions that were most rapidly affected with the 20 mg/kg dose of imipramine (i.e., after 2 days) were also the first to respond with the 10 mg/kg dose of the drug. After 21 days treatment with imipramine at 10 mg/kg, 125I-pindolol binding was reduced in 13 of the 18 regions examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Previous studies have suggested that the beta 3 receptor fails to become desensitized following acute agonist exposure. We have determined whether this resistance to desensitization is an intrinsic property of the human beta 3 receptor by examining beta 3 receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in several cell types. Prior exposure to ISO significantly decreased beta 3 receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in SK-N-MC human neuroepithelioma cells, which natively express the beta 3 receptor. ISO pretreatment significantly desensitized the recombinant beta 3 receptor when stably expressed in 293 cells, but not when the receptor was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Mutant receptors lacking the second exon of the human beta 3 receptor also underwent agonist-induced desensitization when expressed in 293 cells. Additionally, the rat beta 3 receptor, which fails to desensitize in rat adipocytes, underwent agonist-induced desensitization when expressed in 293 cells. Pretreatment with CGP 12177A, a beta 3-selective agonist, also reduced beta 3-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in transfected 293 cells. In contrast, 8-Br-Cyc AMP did not desensitize the beta 3 receptor. Concanavalin A, an inhibitor of receptor sequestration failed to prevent ISO-induced desensitization of the beta 3 receptor. Furthermore, radioligand binding studies showed that ISO pretreatment did not cause a loss of beta 3 receptors from 293 cell membranes. The results of the present study indicate that beta 3 receptor desensitization is dependent upon the cellular background in which this receptor is expressed. Furthermore, the mechanism responsible for beta 3 receptor desensitization does not appear to involve sequestration, cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation or down-regulation of the receptor.",

Compared with WKY values, the significantly higher MAP of SHRs (175 +/- 4 vs. 118 +/- 4 mm Hg) was the result of a significantly elevated TPR (6.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.2 mm Hg/ml/min/100 g; P < .05), because Cl was significantly lower (31 +/- 1.6 vs. 41 +/- 2.5 ml/min/100 g; P < .05). A lower SV (261 +/- 13 vs. 394 +/- 20 microliters/min; P < .05) accounted for the reduced Cl in SHRs, because HR was similar (318 +/- 4 vs. 328 +/- 11 beats/min).

Furthermore, the increase in insulin sensitivity reported for captopril after 6 months (p < 0.05) was not significantly altered during long-term treatment. Also, the raised levels of very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (p < 0.01) and reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.01) induced by most of the beta-adrenergic blockade without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and hydrochlorothiazide persisted. Captopril, on the other hand, did not significantly affect the lipids during prolonged treatment. In conclusion, the magnitude of the metabolic effects induced by antihypertensive treatment during short-term studies was of the same order after long-term treatment over 2 to 3 years and were not significantly different from the results in the short-term studies.", 
    "37": "Mental stress testing is used to study the cardiovascular changes caused by psychologic stress. To examine the effects of cardiac drugs on mental stress-induced changes, it is useful to attain a degree of arousal that can be replicated in serial studies. Skin conductance level, a cholinergically mediated index of arousal, was assessed for its stability in serial studies and under conditions of beta-blockade. In normal subjects, skin conductance increased in response to mental stress (p < 0.001) and was stable across three sessions. In patients with mild hypertension, skin conductance was elevated during mental stress during both placebo and nadolol therapy (p < 0.001). As expected, nadolol reduced baseline and stress-induced peak arterial pressure and heart rate but had no significant effect on skin conductance. Thus skin conductance level can serve as a stable and useful index of autonomic arousal in clinical trials, even in patients using beta-blocking medications.", 
    "38": "Orthostatic stress during tilt table testing (TTT) is used to examine patients who may have vasodepressor syncope. This response is thought to be mediated by activation of left ventricular mechanoreceptors. Isoproterenol, by increasing the rate of discharge of these mechanoreceptors, has been proposed to increase the sensitivity of TTT without decreasing its specificity. This mechanism is not, however, totally consistent with recent observations of vasodepressor responses after cardiac transplantation in patients with denervated hearts. These reports and data showing that not all sympathomimetic agents increase the sensitivity of TTT suggest that more than one mechanism may be responsible for a positive TTT result. Therefore we hypothesized that patients with positive TTT results tests not requiring isoproterenol (iso-independent) would have a different clinical and therapeutic response than patients who required isoproterenol (iso-dependent). One hundred sixty-one consecutive patients who underwent TTT for the evaluation of unexplained syncope were included in the study. TTT was performed without and during isoproterenol infusion. A positive TTT result was defined as syncope or presyncope with a sudden decrease in systolic blood pressure and reproduction of the patient's clinical symptoms. Patients with a positive TTT result underwent a second test after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy with an oral beta-blocking agent; if the result remained positive, TTT was performed again with other agents until a satisfactory therapeutic response was obtained. Sixty-six (41%) of 161 patients had a positive result; 18 (27%) were iso-independent, and 48 (73%) were iso-dependent. There were no significant differences in age, gender, or presence of underlying heart disease between these two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "The effect on kidney function, vasoactive systems and ascites outcome of long-term treatment with propranolol plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate, a combined therapy proven more effective than propranolol alone in decreasing portal pressure in the cirrhotic patient, is unknown. Thirty cirrhotic patients who survived acute variceal bleeding and were treated with propranolol plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate were studied. Portal and systemic hemodynamics (n = 15), inulin clearance, free water clearance, plasma renin activity, aldosterone concentration and prostaglandin E2 excretion (n = 20) were measured before and after 3 mo of treatment. In addition, data on ascites outcome in the entire series after a mean follow-up of 9.6 mo were compared with those of 30 patients undergoing elective sclerotherapy and with those of 30 patients treated with propranolol alone matched for age, sex, presence of ascites, Child-Pugh class and mean follow-up length included in other randomized controlled trials. Combined therapy significantly decreased the hepatic venous pressure gradient and azygos blood flow. In addition, no changes in inulin clearance, free water clearance, plasma renin activity, aldosterone concentration and prostaglandin E2 excretion occurred, despite a mild decrease in mean arterial pressure. Moreover, no differences among the three groups of patients studied in ascites outcome were found. These results suggest that long-term treatment with propranolol plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate does not impair kidney function, vasoactive systems or ascites outcome in cirrhotic patients.", 
    "40": "No prospective studies have compared sotalol and amiodarone during electropharmacologic testing. The purpose of this prospective, randomized study was to compare the electrophysiologic effects of sotalol and amiodarone in patients with coronary artery disease and sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). Patients with coronary artery disease and sustained monomorphic VT inducible by programmed stimulation were randomly assigned to receive either sotalol (n = 17) or amiodarone (n = 17). The sotalol dose was titrated to 240 mg twice daily over 7 days. Amiodarone dosing consisted of 600 mg 3 times daily for 10 days. An electrophysiologic test was performed in the baseline state and at the end of the loading regimen. An adequate response was defined as the inability to induce VT or the ability to induce only relatively slow hemodynamically stable VT. During the follow-up electrophysiologic test, 24% of patients taking sotalol and 41% of those taking amiodarone had an adequate response to therapy (p = 0.30). Amiodarone lengthened the mean VT cycle length to a greater degree than sotalol (28% vs 12%, p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in the effects of sotalol and amiodarone on the ventricular effective refractory period. In patients with coronary artery disease, amiodarone and sotalol are similar in efficacy in the treatment of VT as assessed by electropharmacologic testing. The effects of the 2 drugs on ventricular refractoriness are similar, but amiodarone slows VT to a greater extent than sotalol.", 
    "41": "Recent studies strongly support the prognostic importance of transient silent ischemia. Because patients with silent ischemia are at higher risk of a cardiac event, they are likely to benefit not only from control of symptoms, but also from treatment directed at prevention of ischemia. The efficacy of controlled-release metoprolol 200 mg once daily and diltiazem 60 mg 4 times daily was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in 32 patients with proven coronary artery disease, predominantly asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, positive bicycle exercise test results, and > or = 5 minutes of asymptomatic ST-segment depression on a 24-hour screening ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG). At the beginning and at the end of both 3-week treatment periods, an exercise test was performed and a 72-hour ambulatory ECG was recorded. Both active treatment periods were preceded by a 2-week placebo phase. Both treatments effectively reduced and postponed exercise-induced ST depression and reduced the total ischemic integral on the ambulatory ECG. Only metoprolol significantly reduced the mean number of ischemic episodes (54%, p = 0.0003, vs 31% for diltiazem, p = NS) and the mean duration of ischemia (51%, p = 0.012, vs 27% for diltiazem, p = NS) compared with baseline values. Metoprolol strongly blunted the morning and afternoon peak in the circadian distribution of ischemia, whereas diltiazem did not change the circadian distribution of ischemia at all.", 
    "42": "Of 180 consecutive patients who underwent uneventful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), 25 (13.9%) had at least 1 episode of symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension during the early postprocedure period. Symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension occurred 1 to 10 hours (mean 4 +/- 2) after PTCA. A higher incidence of symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension was found in patients receiving regular treatment with beta blockers (26% vs 10% in patients without beta blockers in their regimen, p < 0.01), diltiazem or verapamil (20% vs 9%, p < 0.025), or both a beta blocker and diltiazem or verapamil (64% vs 11%, p < 0.001). A higher incidence was also associated with angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery compared with angioplasty of the other coronary arteries (22% vs 8%, p < 0.01). It is concluded that symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension is a common occurrence after PTCA. The incidence is higher after PTCA to the left anterior descending coronary artery and in patients receiving diltiazem, verapamil, and beta-blocking agents; it is particularly high in patients receiving a combination of a beta-blocking agent and either diltiazem or verapamil.", 
    "43": "Theoretical considerations and results from experimental studies in animal models suggest that long-term beta-adrenergic blockade should be antiatherogenic. Some of these experimental results indicate that beta-blockers could inhibit atherogenesis and thus prevent clinical events independently of any effects on blood pressure through concomitant reductions in heart rate, blood velocity and energy, endothelial permeability to lipoproteins, and the likelihood of plaque rupture. Any such independent inhibition of atherogenesis implies, in turn, that beta-blockers might be more desirable than alternative antihypertensive therapies in persons at high risk for atherosclerotic diseases. Results of the three major trials directly comparing beta-blockers to diuretics in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease among patients with hypertension were largely inconclusive. However, ancillary data from these and other trials are consistent in demonstrating that beta-adrenergic blockade is associated with anti-coronary heart disease effects and, thus, is perhaps antiatherogenic. A definitive evaluation of the antiatherogenic effects of beta-blockers is not forthcoming because no large clinical trials directly assessing the effect of these drugs on atherosclerosis have been done or are planned.",

In the reperfusion-induced arrhythmias after 5 min of left coronary artery ligation in rats, nebivolol 1.25 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) reduced the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) from 85% in the solvent group to 33% (p < 0.05) and decreased that of ventricular fibrillation (VF) to 20% vs. 67% in the solvent group, (p < 0.05). In ischemia-induced arrhythmias resulting from 20-min coronary artery ligation in rats, nebivolol 1.25 mg/kg i.v. reduced the incidence of VT to 50% as compared with 87% in the solvent group and decreased the incidence of VF to 17% as compared with 67% in the solvent group (p < 0.05). In electrically stimulated hearts in open-chest guinea pigs, nebivolol produced a dose-dependent (0.16-2.5 mg/kg i.v.) increase in VF threshold (VFT). In guinea pigs with ouabain-induced cardiotoxicity, nebivolol 1.25 mg/kg i.v. (n = 7) doubled the doses of ouabain required to provoke toxic ECG changes as compared with those in the solvent-pretreated group. In rats with aconitine-induced cardiac toxicity, nebivolol 1.25 mg/kg i.v. significantly reduced the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias.

Intracellular action potentials (AP) were obtained from explanted hearts of 5 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy in whom orthotopic heart transplantation was performed. The following parameters were recorded: AP amplitude (APA), resting membrane potential (RMP), AP duration at 95 and 50% repolarization (APD95, APD50), maximal upstroke velocity (Vmax), and effective refractory period (ERP) at cycle lengths (CL) of 0.5, 1 Hz, and 1.5 Hz. APD50, APD95, and ERP were significantly prolonged in endocardium at D-sotalol concentration > or = 10(-4) M at all CL. In epicardium, APD50, APD95, and ERP were significantly prolonged at lower D-sotalol concentrations (starting at 3 x 10(-5) M). In contrast to parameters in endocardium, APD50, APD95, and ERP were shortened in epicardial cells at D-sotalol concentrations > or = 3 x 10(-4) M at drive CL of 0.5 and 1 Hz with no effect on Vmax and APA. In endocardium, the prolongation of APD95 and ERP was less at a CL of 1.5 Hz compared with 0.5 Hz at a concentration of 10(-4) M. This frequency-dependent effect was not observed in epicardium. No effects were observed on RMP, APA, or Vmax.

    "56": "To study the effects of the new vasodilating beta-blocking agent carvedilol on a variety of metabolic, hemodynamic, and ECG parameters of importance for the clinical outcome of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we infused epinephrine (EPI) in healthy male volunteers on two separate occasions to serum concentrations of the same level reached in AMI. Before the EPI infusions, the volunteers were pretreated for 2 weeks with either carvedilol or placebo in randomized order. EPI caused significant decreases in serum levels: S-potassium (0.62 mM), S-magnesium (0.07 mM), S-calcium (0.12 mM), and S-phosphate (0.26 mM). After pretreatment with carvedilol, the decreases in S-calcium and S-phosphate were partly prevented and those in S-potassium and S-magnesium were completely inhibited. Short-term treatment with carvedilol significantly decreased S-insulin and serum C-peptide and significantly attenuated the EPI-induced increase in B-glucose observed after placebo. The EPI infusion significantly increased serum concentrations of free fatty acids and glycerol. These increases were significantly attenuated by carvedilol, whereas carvedilol had no significant affects of a variety of other lipid variables. EPI infusion caused a significant (p < 0.01) increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 124.8 +/- 8.1 to 135.8 +/- 12.5 mm Hg and an increase in heart rate (HR) from 71.0 +/- 11.5 to 77.2 +/- 12.2, resulting in a significant increase in rate-pressure product (RPP).

    "57": "The adaptive responses of the cardiovascular system to altitude appear to be dominated by increased sympathetic neural activity. We investigated the combined roles of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems (SNS and PNS, respectively) in the early (days 4-5) and subsequent (days 11-12) phases of acclimatization on Pike's Peak, CO (4,300 m), by spectral analysis of heart rate variability. Male subjects were randomly assigned to groups receiving oral propranolol (240 mg/day; n = 6) or a matched placebo (n = 3). On ascent to altitude, the high-frequency, fractal, and total spectral powers were reduced in the placebo group during days 4-5 and 11-12. At altitude during days 4-5, all three placebo group subjects increased SNS and decreased PNS activities compared with at sea level, and during days 11-12 SNS decreased and PNS increased compared with days 4-5. Relative to the placebo group, propranolol caused lengthening of the R-R interval; increases in high-frequency power, total spectral power, and the PNS indicator; and a decrease in the SNS indicator. Total spectral power tended to decrease at altitude, but there were no effects of altitude on PNS and SNS indicators in the propranolol group. The data from the placebo and propranolol groups suggest that both the PNS and SNS are involved in the elevated heart rate during the early phase of altitude acclimatization. Changes in heart rate variability during days 11-12 at altitude must be considered in light of the possible reductions in sympathetic receptor number noted in previous studies.", 
    "58": "The present study examined the extent to which heart rate changes evoked by acoustic startle stimuli are affected by the development of fear during startle testing. The phasic heart rate responses of rats elicited by a 120-dB startle stimulus were characterized by decelerations that habituated across trials and accelerations that developed across trials in a manner that paralleled the development of freezing behavior. A 92-dB stimulus evoked little freezing or tachycardia, yet evoked decelerations of similar magnitude to the 120-dB stimulus. Pharmacological blockade of autonomic activity was used to uncouple freezing from the heart rate accelerations and to show that the accelerations were not an artifact of the habituating decelerations. These results indicate that heart rate responses to nonsignal stimuli depend critically on a rat's previous experience with those stimuli.",

Following a 30-min training session, pups were injected with either the norepinephrine beta-receptor antagonist propranolol or the beta-receptor agonist isoproterenol. Pups were tested 24 hr later for an acquired relative odor preference for the CS. Propranolol injected immediately following training impaired memory for the CS in a dose-dependent manner. This posttraining effect lasted less than 4 hr. Isoproterenol injected immediately after training also impaired memory performance, even at very low doses. These results suggest that posttraining levels of norepinephrine play a critical role in memory consolidation in the newborn, with elevations or decrements in noradrenergic activity resulting in impaired memory.",

In an attempt to change the beta-adrenergic properties of these compounds from antagonist to agonist, while still retaining the beta 2-selectivity, a series of new completely aliphatic 3-(methyleneaminoxy)propanolamine derivatives were designed in which either a hydroxylic or a methoxylic group was present on the aliphatic portion linked to the oximic carbon. The synthesis of the new compounds and their beta-adrenergic activity, evaluated by means of functional tests on isolated preparations, are described and discussed; the results obtained are then rationalised on the basis of their conformational and reactivity characteristics, determined by means of theoretical methods.", 
    "61": "In multiple sclerosis (MS) up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been attributed to either autonomic dysfunction, inflammation or a combination of the two. We have compared secondary progressive MS patients with normal subjects (NS) and two models of autonomic dysfunction; pure autonomic failure (PAF) and multiple system atrophy (MSA, Shy-Drager syndrome). There was up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on PBMCs in MS and PAF patients but not in MSA patients. Only in PAF patients beta-adrenoceptor up-regulation was correlated with low plasma levels of noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (Ad). In addition to studies in the basal state, measurements also were made after the centrally acting sympatholytic agent clonidine. These were combined with haemodynamic and neurohormonal measurements. After clonidine, there was a fall in blood pressure in NS and MSA patients but not in MS and PAF patients; a rise in growth hormone (GH) in NS and PAF patients but not in MS and MSA patients; and an up-regulation in PBMCs beta-adrenoceptors in NS but not in MS, MSA and PAF patients. Up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on PBMCs in MS could be attributed to autonomic dysfunction but the disparity between MS and PAF patients when considering their plasma levels of NA and Ad argue against. Although the neurohormonal responses to clonidine and the physiological assessment of autonomic function in progressive MS patients, demonstrate central autonomic dysfunction resembling that of the MSA patients, the normal basal beta-adrenoceptor densities in the latter, suggests that the up-regulation of these receptors is independent of the central autonomic dysfunction in MS.",

Flow velocity was obtained by measuring the distance that the leading edge of the contrast medium moved per 0.1 s in the small arteries. Volume flow was obtained from the product of flow velocity and cross-sectional area calculated from the ID of the small arteries. SNS was accomplished with 10- to 15-V square-wave pulses of 2-ms duration at 20-30 Hz for 20-s periods. In response to SNS, arterial ID decreased significantly by 8-13% in the 200- to 500-microns vessels but not in the 100- to 200-microns vessels. In the veins, on the other hand, there was no significant ID decrease in any of the 100- to 500-microns vessels. After alpha-receptor blockade (phentolamine, 2 mg/kg i.v.), there were significant ID increases (4-9%) in the 100- to 500-microns arteries in response to SNS, the maximum increases being in the 100- to 200-microns arteries. After beta-blockade (propranolol, 2 mg/kg i.v.), the ID decrease due to SNS in the 200- to 500-microns arteries was enhanced (24-27%) and, in addition, the 100- to 200-microns arteries exhibited a significant ID decrease (18%). Combined alpha- and beta-blockade completely abolished the ID decrease due to SNS.

    "63": "The stereoselective hydrolysis of O-isovaleryl propranolol (isovaleryl-PL) was studied using phosphate and Tris-HCl buffers (pH 7.4), dog plasma, and liver preparations. The 10000g supernatant, microsomes, and cytosol were prepared from the liver homogenate. The hydrolysis rate of isovaleryl-PL was accelerated in the order Tris buffer < plasma = phosphate buffer < 10000g supernatant of liver = liver cytosol < liver microsomes. The high plasma protein binding of the prodrug brought about the extremely slow hydrolysis rate of isovaleryl-PL in plasma. No difference was observed in the hydrolysis rate between the isomers of isovaleryl-PL in buffers. The hydrolysis rate was 2-3 times faster with the (R)-isomer than with the (S)-isomer using racemate in dog plasma and liver preparations. The hydrolysis of each enantiomer was inhibited by the other enantiomer. For hydrolysis in microsomes the Km values of (R)- and (S)-isomers were same, and the Vmax of the (R)-isomer was 3 times greater than that of the (S)-isomer. These data suggested the mutual interaction of (R)- and (S)-isomers during the hydrolysis process and the rapid hydrolysis of isovaleryl-PL in liver after absorption. The AUC of PL enantiomers after oral administration of racemic isovaleryl-PL was about 2 times higher compared to 2 mg/kg equivalent molar dose of racemic PL in beagle dogs, and the corresponding plasma levels were not stereoselective from both PL and prodrug. The amount of (R)-PL absorbed after administration of a 5 mg/kg dose of racemic PL was 2-fold greater than (S)-PL, because of the stereoselective oxidation and glucronidation of (S)-PL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "1. The circulation of natural killer (NK) cells in vivo is influenced by physical exercise, mental stress, and infusion of beta-adrenoceptor agonists. We have previously presented in vitro data, showing that beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists induce detachment of NK cells from endothelial cells (EC), supporting the hypothesis that NK cells can be recruited from the marginating pool in blood vessels. 2. Because NK cells as well as EC express beta 2-adrenoceptors, the present study was conducted to investigate whether stimulation of the beta-adrenoceptors on NK cells, EC or both cell types is required to induce detachment from EC. 3. Cells were pretreated (15 min) with a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, GR81706, at various concentrations. The duration of beta-adrenoceptor blockade was tested by determining the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production induced by terbutaline (a beta 2-adrenoceptor specific agonist). This receptor-mediated response was effectively inhibited for at least 4 h, whereas the cyclic AMP production in response to forskolin (a direct activator of adenylate-cyclase) was not affected. 4. Functional adhesion assays were then performed to determine the role of beta-adrenoceptors on the different cell types involved (NK and EC) in catecholamine-induced detachment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h to monolayers of unstimulated EC in the presence or absence of cyclic AMP inducing agents, and the percentage of NK cells in the adhering lymphocyte fraction was determined by flow cytometry. 5. Both adrenaline (10(-5) M) and forskolin (10(-5) M) caused detachment of NK cells from EC. After blockade of the P2-adrenoceptors on NK cells by pretreatment with GR81706 (10-6 M), the effect of adrenaline on NK cells adhesion was pretented; after blockade of the beta2-adrenoceptors on EC, NK cell adhesion was still significantly reduced by adrenaline. In all cases, forskolin caused detachment of NKcells.6. To establish further that stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors on NK cells is sufficient to cause detachment,we showed that adrenaline also reduced adhesion of NK cells to monolayers of Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express beta-adrenoceptors.7. Together, these results show that stimulation of beta2-adrenoceptors on NK cells negatively influences their capacity to adhere to EC, and that beta2-adrenoceptors on EC play a negligible role in this phenomenon.",

While CEC is considered an alpha 1B-adrenoceptor antagonist, our earlier studies revealed that it also acted like an agonist in the dog saphenous vein (DSV). The present study characterized the contraction induced by CEC in endothelium-denuded rings from DSV. 2. Concentration-response curves for CEC were constructed in the absence (EC50 value of 11.13 +/- 3.6 microM, n = 8) and presence of propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, 30 nM), rauwolscine (alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 30 nM), prazosin (alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, 30 nM) or methysergide (5HT2 antagonist, 30 nM) or both prazosin and rauwolscine. Pretreatment with methysergide (9.83 +/- 5.14 microM, n = 4) or propranolol (23.78 +/- 12.32 microM, n = 4) had no consistent effect. In the presence of rauwolscine, the concentration-response curve for CEC was significantly shifted to the right with an EC50 value of 48.82 +/- 13.2 microM (n = 8). In the presence of prazosin, the CEC concentration-response curve had an EC50 value of 29.12 +/- 6.42 microM (n = 8). Pretreatment with both prazosin and rauwolscine shifted the concentration-response curve for CEC to the right with an EC50 value of 72.67 +/- 10.69 microM (n = 8, P < 0.05). Maximum responses were significantly reduced only in tissues that were treated with both prazosin and rauwolscine. 3. CEC (100 microM) pretreatment abolished prazosin binding sites and reduced the Bmax for rauwolscine by 50% without affecting the Kd value or the Hill slope.4. In Ca2+-free Krebs solution containing 50 microM EGTA, CEC produced a small transient contraction,suggesting that it can mobilize internally-stored Ca2+ . Pretreatment with rauwolscine abolished the CEC-induced contraction in Ca2+-free medium; prazosin pretreatment reduced but did not abolish CEC response in Ca2+-free medium.5. Restoring Ca2+ (0.5-2.5 mM) to the extracellular solution increased CEC contraction in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching a plateau at around 1.5mM Ca2 . The contraction was insensitive to nicardipine (1 microM), a voltage-operated Ca2+ channel blocker, but was blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by the putative receptor-operated Ca2+ channel blockers, SK&F 96365(1-1O microM) and genistein, also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (10-100 microM).6. We conclude that CEC acts on rauwolscine- and, to a less extent, prazosin-sensitive adrenoceptors inDSV to release internally stored Ca2+ and to open receptor-operated Ca2+ channels. The inhibitory effect on CEC-induced contraction that depended on external Ca2+ by genistein suggests a role forty rosine kinase in the regulation of dihydropyridine-insensitive Ca2+ entry.", 
    "66": "1. Rat or guinea pig isolated tracheae were labelled with [3H]-choline to measure evoked tritium outflow, which reflects neuronal release of [3H]-acetylcholine. Tritium outflow was evoked either by electrical stimulation of the extrinsic vagal nerve (rat tracheae) or by 27 mM potassium (guinea pig tracheae). 2. In rat tracheae isoprenaline (0.01, 0.1 microM) inhibited evoked [3H]-acetylcholine release, whereas beta 2-adrenoceptor-selective agonists (fenoterol, formoterol, salbutamol) were ineffective. 3. The inhibitory effect of isoprenaline was abolished under the following conditions: (i) presence of propranolol (1 microM) or of the beta 1-selective antagonist CGP 20712 A (0.1 microM); (ii) removal of the mucosa at the start of the experiments; (iii) blockade of cyclooxygenase activity by 3 microM indomethacin. 4. In rat isolated tracheae prelabelled with [3H]-arachidonic acid, isoprenaline (0.1 microM) but not formoterol (0.01 microM) enhanced the outflow of [3H]-prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2). This effect was blocked by 0.1 microM CGP 20712 A. 5. In guinea pig tracheae electrical stimulation of the extrinsic vagal nerve did not cause a constant release of [3H]-acetylcholine, but 27 mM potassium elicited a reproducible release of [3H]-acetylcholine. In this species both isoprenaline (0.1 microM) and formoterol (0.01 microM) inhibited evoked [3H]-acetylcholine release. Inhibition was abolished under the following conditions: (i) presence of propranolol (1 microM) or of the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118551 (0.3 microM); (ii) removal of the mucosa at the start of the experiments; (iii) blockade of cyclooxygenase activity by 3 microM indomethacin. 6. In conclusion, the present experiments have demonstrated that activation of beta-adrenoceptors localized in the mucosa mediates inhibition of [3H]-acetylcholine release from the neuroeffector junctions of the pulmonary, parasympathetic nerves most probably by the liberation of inhibitory prostaglandins from the airway mucosa. The adrenoceptor subtype involved differs in rat (beta 1 subtype) and guinea pig (beta 2 subtype) airways.", 
    "67": "1. Exercise and beta-adrenoceptor blockade have important roles in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, but fatigue and a reduced capacity to exercise are commonly reported side effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockers. The reduced capacity to exercise may be partly caused by a reduction in fat metabolism. 2. We investigated the effects of atenolol 50 mg, metoprolol CR/Z0K 50 mg, metoprolol CR/Z0K 100 mg and placebo, on heart rate, energy expenditure, fat oxidation, plasma free fatty acids, glycerol, glucose, lactate, ammonia and perceived exertion during 2 h of treadmill walking at 40% of maximal oxygen uptake in 20 healthy volunteers. 3. Compared with placebo (38.0%), total fat oxidation was significantly lower on atenolol 50 mg (30.1%) and metoprolol CR/Z0K 100 mg (31.0%), but not on metoprolol CR/Z0K 50 mg (33.7%). Reductions in fat oxidation correlated well (r2 = 0.970) with reductions in exercising heart rate, and probably reflected the degree of beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. Maximum plasma ammonia concentration was reached after 45 min of exercise on atenolol, 60 min on metoprolol CR/Z0K 100, and 75 min on metoprolol CR/Z0K 50, and was higher than placebo on all active drug treatments. 4. The greater reduction in fat oxidation with atenolol may be a reflection of a peak in plasma concentration, which is avoided with a controlled release preparation.", 
    "68": "The hypophagic effect of intraperitoneally injected VP (1.5 micrograms/kg) was blocked by concomitant injection of the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin (27 and 40 micrograms/kg). Both the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonists idazoxan (300 micrograms/kg) and yohimbine (500 micrograms/kg) and the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (500 micrograms/kg) failed to block the hypophagia induced by VP (1.5 micrograms/kg). The results suggest that the hypophagic effect of VP is mediated by alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "69": "In patients with essential hypertension, the beta-blockers bevantolol or propranolol were administered once or twice a day for twelve weeks to evaluate the effects on blood pressure, and lipid metabolism. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly in response to both bevantolol and propranolol. The pulse-rate also decreased significantly in both groups. Total cholesterol did not change significantly in both groups. Triglycerides increased significantly in the bevantolol group. HDL cholesterol decreased significantly in the propranolol group. The LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio increased significantly in the propranolol group, while no significant increase was observed in the bevantolol group. The apolipoprotein B/A ratio was elevated in the propranolol group. No serious side-effects were noted during the study in both groups. These results indicate that bevantolol is an effective antihypertensive drug with fewer unfavorable effects on lipid metabolism than propranolol.",

Bilateral injection of either phentolamine, propranolol or atropine into the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVL) all could decrease the INS-pressor response. The latter could also be attenuated by phentolamine (i.v.), but not by propranolol or methyl atropine. These results indicate that the INS-pressor response is mediated by RVL (alpha-, beta- and M-receptors) -sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve system.", 
    "71": "Thirty-eight cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices were investigated by duplex Doppler sonography. In every patient, the portal blood flow mean velocity (cm/sec) and portal blood flow volume (ml/min) were measured. In addition, the pulsatility index [(maximum-minimum)/mean velocity] was measured in the superior mesenteric artery, in the hepatic arteries, in an intrasplenic artery, and in intrarenal arteries. These parameters were measured again 120 to 180 minutes after administration of nadolol (80 mg orally) in 22 patients, 90 minutes after administration of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (20 mg orally) in nine patients, and subsequently after administration of isosorbide 5-mononitrate to 10 of the 22 patients treated earlier with nadolol. Duplex Doppler sonographic parameters also were evaluated in seven patients 120 minutes after administration of a placebo. In five of the 22 patients treated acutely with nadolol, the same parameters were measured again after 60 minutes without any additional drug administration. No hemodynamic changes occurred in response to the placebo. Portal blood flow mean velocity and portal blood flow volume decreased after nadolol and isosorbide-5-mononitrate; mesenteric pulsatility index increased after both nadolol and isosorbide-5-mononitrate. After combined therapy, we observed a further reduction in portal blood flow mean velocity and portal blood flow volume and a significant increase in hepatic, splenic, and mesenteric pulsatility indices. The addition of isosorbide-5-mononitrate to nadolol caused a decrease in portal blood flow mean velocity of more than 17% in all patients. Nadolol caused a slight increase in renal pulsatility index, which was amplified by the addition of isosorbide-5-mononitrate, suggesting a decrease in renal blood flow.", 
    "72": "1. The aim of the study was to characterize the functional beta 1-and beta 2-adrenoceptors of the rat left atrium and to investigate how these functional beta-adrenoceptor responses were altered in hypertension. The contractile responses of the left atrium from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats to isoprenaline, T-0509 and procaterol were characterized. Subsequently, the effects of selective beta 1-(bisoprolol) and beta 2 (ICI 118,551)-adrenoceptor antagonists were investigated on these responses. 2. The maximal combined contractile responses of the rat left atrium to cardiac stimulation and CaCl2, isoprenaline, T-0509 or procaterol were not altered by hypertension. 3. The sensitivities to CaCl2 (pD2 on WKY left atrium = 2.99), isoprenaline (8.82) and T-0509 (8.84) were not altered by hypertension. There was an increase in sensitivity to procaterol from a pD2 value of 7.21 to 7.61 in the left atrium of the SH rat. 4. The basal tension induced by cardiac stimulation alone was inhibited by bisoprolol at > or = 10(-8) M and by ICI 118,551 at > or = 10(-7) M and this inhibitory effect is probably due to membrane stabilizing activity. 5. The pKB values for bisoprolol against isoprenaline, T-0509 and procaterol on the WKY were 8.43, 8.68 and 8.18, respectively, and were not different from SH rat left atrium. 6. The pKB value for ICI 118,551 against isoprenaline was increased from 7.06 on the WKY to 7.44 on the SH rat left atrium. The pKB values for ICI 118,551 against T-0509 and procaterol on the WKY were 7.18 and 8.14, respectively and were not significantly different from the SH rat left atrium values. 7. These results suggest that: (a) procaterol stimulates the beta 1-, in addition to, the beta 2-adrenoceptors of the rat left atrium; (b) functional beta 1-adrenoceptors are not altered in hypertension, and (c) there is probably an increase in the affinity of procaterol and isoprenaline for the beta 2-adrenoceptors which underlies the small increase in the functional beta 2-adrenoceptor response in hypertension.", 
    "73": "In the present study we quantified the contractile protein troponin-T at the cellular and subcellular level in chick embryo cardiomyocytes to investigate the modulation of cardiac development by catecholamines. We analyzed the effects of these drugs on cultures of chick cardiomyocytes obtained from Hamburger and Hamilton's (HH) stage 21, HH stage 29 and HH stage 40 embryos; cardiomyocytes are considered to be mature at HH stage 40. We analyzed the modifications these drugs induced in the transcription of the gene for chick cardiac troponin-T. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and immunobloting showed that cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal concentrations of troponin-T are dependent on the stage of embryonic development analyzed, and on the type of catecholamine added to the culture. The most significant finding was the increase in troponin-T mRNA in the chick heart at HH stage 40, accompanied by an increase in the increase in the expression of this protein in the cytoskeletal compartment after treatment with norepinephrine. At HH stage 21, norepinephrine induced less marked changes in the accumulation of troponin-T in comparison with untreated cardiomyocytes.", 
    "74": "Patients should be referred for cardiac transplantation only after all other means of management of congestive heart failure have been attempted and have been unsuccessful (table 3). An adequate therapeutic trial of conventional and experimental agents including beta blockade and vesnarinone should be completed and be shown to be unsuccessful before transplantation is considered in patients in NYHA class III. Prospective clinical trials need to be completed to define the role of newer therapeutic options. The scarcity of donor organs will probably preclude the use of cardiac transplantation in all patients who may benefit. Alternative methods of cardiac replacement (such as dynamic cardiomyoplasty, permanent implantable mechanical circulatory assistance, and xenografting) must be developed. These methods coupled with better pharmacological treatment will greatly improve the outcome of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.",

During the 15 years of the study period the number of cases increased progressively and the baseline clinical characteristics changed (that is, patients were younger and less severely affected), partly explaining the improvement in survival. None the less, the three mortality curves tended to diverge progressively and the improvement in survival in the different groups was still significant after stratification for the severity of the disease, suggesting that treatment had a sustained effect. A progressively higher proportion of patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and more recently with beta blockers. In group 2, after stratification for the severity of heart failure, patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a better survival than patients who were not. Furthermore, analysis of group 3 showed that beta blockers had a significant additive effect with conventional therapy both by intention to treat and actual treatment.

After 3-week single-blind placebo therapy, patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 94-114 mmHg were randomized to atenolol 50 mg/day (62 patients) or diltiazem-SR 90 mg b.i.d. (60 patients) in a double-blind parallel study. Depending on SDBP response, the dose was increased to 100 mg/day for atenolol and 180 mg b.i.d. for diltiazem-SR. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements and exercise tolerance test by the Bruce protocol were done at the end of placebo and active treatment. Compared with placebo, both atenolol and diltiazem-SR significantly decreased heart rate (HR), sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP), SDBP, ambulatory BP, BP load for waking and sleeping hours, area under the BP curve, rate-pressure product (p < 0.001), and exercise time (NS). Atenolol exerted a greater effect on ambulatory BP, HR, rate-pressure product, waking diastolic BP load, and area under the 24-h BP curve. The drugs were well tolerated and caused no serious side effects necessitating discontinuation of treatment. These findings indicate that (1) monotherapy for hypertension with atenolol or diltiazem-SR is effective and well tolerated, (2) it decreases the 24-h BP load, (3) it does not interfere with exercise capacity.",

OMB ligation resulted in a significant shortening of the refractory period in the ischaemic zone (p < 0.01). In group 2 (n = 12), the alpha 1 blocker bunazosin (0.2 mg.kg-1, intravenously) blunted the shortening of the refractory period in the ischaemic zone induced by OMB ligation (p < 0.01), resulting in a reduction in refractory period dispersion between the ischaemic and non-ischaemic (border and normal) zones. Subsequent administration of the beta blocker propranolol (0.2 mg.kg-1, intravenously) prolonged refractory periods both in the ischaemic and in the non-ischaemic zones (p < 0.05 v p < 0.001). Ventrolateral cardiac nerve stimulation reversed the effects of bunazosin on the refractory period in the ischaemic zone; however, after the addition of propranolol, neural stimulation no longer influenced the refractory period.

This increase in heart rate was reduced significantly to 8% by the VIP antagonist [D-p-Cl-Phe6, Leu17]VIP, 10(-7) M, which alone had no effect on sinus rate. Vagal stimulation reduced sinus rate from a control of 254(SEM 2) to 164(17) beats.min-1 (p < 0.05) at 20 Hz. VIP, 10(-8) M, increased these rates to 284(6) and 220(21) beats.min-1 (p < 0.05). In another eight vagally stimulated hearts, frequencies of 5-20 Hz reduced sinus rate. At 30 Hz heart rate increased in five, and the resultant rate was significantly faster in these [154(10) beats.min-1] than in the remainder [98(12) beats.min-1, p < 0.05]. Vagal stimulation also increased sinus rate (p < 0.05) in four of seven additional hearts perfused with atropine, 2 x 10(-6) M. This increase was completely abolished by [D-p-Cl-Phe6, Leu17]VIP. That the effect was not beta adrenergic was demonstrated in eight experiments using atropine plus propranolol, 1 x 10(-7) M. A vagally induced increment in rate still occurred (p < 0.05) and was abolished by [D-p-CL-Phe6, Leu17]VIP.

    "96": "The small salivary phosphoproteins, histatins and statherins, have important functions in the oral cavity in terms of antimicrobial actions and regulation of calcium phosphate homeostasis. Neither the effects of various physiological stimuli on their secretion nor the nature of the efferent receptor involved in the stimulus-secretion coupling has been determined previously. These aspects are important for improved understanding of the secretory control of salivary proteins and may have implications regarding the effects of specific medications on salivary constituents and oral health. The effects of graded mechanical (chewing on short and long silicone tubings) and gustatory stimulation (0.5, 1.5, and 5.0% citric acid) on the secretion of histatins and statherins were studied in the presence and absence of adrenolytic agents (n = 10). In this model, secretory rates of both proteins increased with increases in flow rate, with 5.0% citric acid representing a particularly potent stimulus. Histatin and statherin secretory rates were significantly reduced by the beta 1-adrenolytic agent (histatins to 58 to 72% and statherins to 11 to 29% of that in corresponding control experiments), but not by the alpha 1-adrenolytic agent. Since the beta 1-adrenergic receptors played an important role in the stimulus-secretion coupling of these proteins, protective salivary functions in the oral cavity may be compromised during beta 1-adrenolytic treatment.", 
    "97": "A circadian variation in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production has recently been demonstrated using magnetic resonance phase imaging. A nightly peak in CSF production was found at approximately 0200, when production is approximately twice the daytime values. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of a beta 1-receptor antagonist, atenolol, on the production of CSF, specifically the nocturnal production peak. CSF production was measured in fourteen healthy volunteers of both sexes in the time interval 1500-1800, with or without drug administration (100 mg orally) at 1800, and a second measurement was made in the time interval 2300-0200. In the absence of drug administration, all nine volunteers showed a significant increase in CSF production at night, from 0.34 +/- 0.06 ml/min in the time interval 1500-1800 to 0.61 +/- 0.05 (SE) ml/min (P < 0.005), confirming the presence of a circadian variation in these individuals. One week later, the experiment was repeated in five of these volunteers, plus an additional five volunteers, but with the administration of 100 mg atenolol orally immediately after the first measurement (at 1800). In five of the volunteers a decrease in CSF production was seen at midnight compared with daytime production values; in two volunteers CSF production remained unchanged, while three volunteers showed increased production.

    "98": "Infective endocarditis is caused by bacterial colonization of the endocardium. Because endocardium modulates mechanical performance of subjacent myocardium, we studied acute effects of bacteria on isolated cardiac muscle and on the functional role of the endocardium. Bacteria, grown in broth at 37 degrees C, were added at increasing concentrations (10(2) to 10(6) bacteria/ml) to cat papillary muscles in Krebs-Ringer solution (1.25 mM Ca2+, 35 degrees C). The endocardial surface was damaged by exposing muscles to a stream of dry air for 30 s. Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis induced significant increases in total peak isometric twitch tension (TT) and maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (Vmax) and significant decreases in time to TT (TtTT) and time to half isometric twitch tension decline (RT 1/2), both before and after removal of endocardial endothelium. This response could also be elicited with bacterial filtrate, after boiling the filtrate or after extracting the polysaccharides from it with KIO4. Increasing Ca2+ concentrations progressively reduced the response to the filtrate. Propranolol slightly, although not significantly, diminished the effects on TT and Vmax while abolishing the effects on TtTT and on RT 1/2. By contrast, Streptococcus bovis and Staphylococcus aureus did not affect TT or Vmax but induced a slight but significant decrease in TtTT at the highest concentration of bacteria. Accordingly, the filtrate of Strep. faecalis induces a positive inotropic effect. The active component is neither a protein nor a polysaccharide, and its effect may be partly beta-adrenoceptor mediated. Strep. bovis and Staph. aureus have negligible acute effects on contractility.", 
    "99": "Chronic exposure to benzodiazepines can result in an \"uncoupling\" of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and benzodiazepine receptors (BzR) both in primary neuronal cell cultures and in vivo. The effect of chronic exposure to BzR ligands was examined in an engineered cell line (WSS-1) stably expressing \"type I\" GABAA receptors. Chronic exposure to flurazepam produced a concentration- (EC50, approximately 1.1 microM after a 48-hr exposure) and time-dependent (t1/2, approximately 3 hr at 100 microM) reduction in the efficacy (Emax) of GABA to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding to BzR, a characteristic of uncoupling in native GABAA receptor isoforms. Uncoupling of GABAA receptors and BzR without concomitant changes in BzR density was also produced by chronic exposure to other, structurally diverse, BzR ligands, including Ro 15-1788 and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, but was not manifested after exposure to the 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake blocker fluoxetine. Chronic (12-48-hr) exposure to flurazepam did not remarkably alter levels of alpha 1 and gamma 2 mRNAs, which constitute GABAA receptors in this cell line. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that uncoupling of GABAA receptors and BzR in this engineered cell line can proceed without the elaboration of additional novel subunits and could involve either post-translational modification of GABAA receptor proteins or changes in subunit stoichiometry.", 
    "100": "Ninety-five patients with acute myocardial infarction were followed up for 6 months to 3 years (mean 25.4 months) in a preliminary study to compare the effects of intravenous magnesium (49 patients) with that of intravenous propranolol (44 patients) given immediately after admission to the intensive care unit. There were four cardiac deaths in the propranolol group and no deaths in the magnesium group (P < 0.046) and 27 per cent of patients who received propranolol subsequently developed cardiac failure as opposed to 12 per cent of those who had received magnesium (P < 0.04). Intravenous magnesium given in the early stages of myocardial infarction reduces the subsequent cardiac death rate possibly by reducing infarct size.", 
    "101": "A total of 266 patients entered into a study comparing the effect of intravenous magnesium and propranolol following acute myocardial infarction. Of these, 97 were able to receive either drug and were therefore randomized into the magnesium (n = 51) or propranolol group (n = 46). 88 patients were unable to receive propranolol and formed a third group (NR) while a further 81 patients could not receive either drug and formed a fourth group (N). The study showed that intravenous magnesium was as effective in preventing potentially lethal arrhythmias as propranolol and could be given to some 70 per cent of such patients whereas propranolol could only be given to 36 per cent.", 
    "102": "This study investigates the metabolism of the divalent cation, magnesium (Mg2+) in the isolated perfused Langendorff's rat heart and ventricular slices in the absence and presence of catecholamines including isoprenaline, noradrenaline and adrenaline. Perfusion of the isolated rat heart with a physiological salt solution containing elevated extracellular Mg2+ [Mg2+]o (2.4 mM-6.0 mM) resulted in a marked and progressive decrease in the amplitude of contraction compared to control [Mg2+]o (1.2 mM). In contrast, perfusion of hearts with low (0-0.6 mM) [Mg2+]o caused a small transient increase in the amplitude of contraction which was often accompanied by arrhythmic activity. Perfusion of the heart with a nominally Mg2+ free medium resulted in a time-dependent net efflux of Mg2+ reaching a steady state after approximately 40-50 min of perfusion. This release of Mg2+ was associated with a concurrent decrease in total heart Mg2+. Stimulation of the heart with the beta adrenergic agonist, isoprenaline (10(-7) M) caused large increases in net Mg2+ efflux which was associated with marked increased in both rate and the amplitude of contraction. Similar effects on Mg2+ efflux were also observed during perfusion of the heart with the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (10(-5) M). Superfusion of paced ventricular segments with either isoprenaline, adrenaline or noradrenaline (all 10(-6) M) also resulted in a marked transient net efflux of Mg2+. Pre-treatment of segments with the beta adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (10(-5) M) competitively blocked the Mg2+ efflux evoked by the catecholamines. Similarly, pre-treatment of segments with the calcium (Ca2+) channel blocker, verapamil (10(-5) M) caused a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in net Mg2+ efflux evoked by isoprenaline. The results of this study indicate that (1) the perturbation of [Mg2+]o has an important influence on myocardial contractility and (2) the mobilization of Mg2+ in the heart is associated with beta adrenergic stimulation possibly via an elevation in intracellular adenosine 3.5 cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP).", 
    "103": "CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and N-acetyltransferase activities were estimated in 100 patients with bladder cancer and 84 control subjects from measurements of theophylline, metoprolol and isoniazid and their metabolites in urine, respectively. The frequency of occurrence of slow acetylators of isoniazid and poor metabolizers of metoprolol were 16.7% and 1.2% in the control group and 16.3% and 2.0% in the cancer patient group. These differences were not significant. The recovery ratio of 1-methyluric acid(1-MU) from theophylline was significantly higher in patients with bladder cancer than in control subjects(0.340 +/- 0.016 versus 0.260 +/- 0.020, p < 0.05). The 1-MU recovery ratio was a significant, independent risk factor among the metabolic capacities tested as shown by logistic regression analysis, controlling for N-acetylation of isoniazid, hydroxylation of metoprolol, age, sex, and smoking. We concluded that the capacity for 3-demethylation of theophylline, as a reflection of CYP1A2 activity, is significantly associated with increased risk of nonoccupational urinary bladder cancer.", 
    "104": "A randomised study was performed on 70 patients undergoing elective coronary by-pass procedure to examine whether the combined, perioperative, 24-hour infusion of nifedipine and metoprolol reduces the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias. The control group received nifedipine only. Repeated assessments of serum enzyme levels and 12-lead-ECG together with a 3-channel Holter monitoring over 48h were used to classify perioperative myocardial ischemia and supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. The two groups did not differ with respect to their demographic data, extracorporeal circulation, aortic cross-clamping time, or number of distal anastomosis. No perioperative myocardial infarction in either group was detected. However, a significantly lower incidence of transient ischemic event was observed in the NM group as compared transient ischemic events was observed in the NM group as compared to the N group. In addition, there was a tendency towards lower CK-MB-level and peak-values of CK- and CK-MB-enzymes in the NM group. With regard to perioperative dysrhythmias, there was a significantly lower incidence of sinus tachycardia and atrial flutter/fibrillation in the NM group as compared to the N group. In addition, postoperative heart rate was lower in the NM group starting from the 6th hour after opening the aortic cross-clamp. In conclusion, the combined perioperative infusion of nifedipine and metoprolol is superior in preventing perioperative myocardial ischemia and decreasing the incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias as compared to a single-drug regimen with nifedipine.", 
    "105": "Hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (RSA) can be elicited by stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation. Buspirone, chlordiazepoxide and imipramine are all anxiolytic and have all been shown to decrease the frequency of RSA. All these compounds have been suggested to affect, directly or indirectly, 5-HT metabolism and function. The present experiments tested the possibility that buspirone, chlordiazepoxide and imipramine reduce RSA frequency via 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Rats received buspirone (10 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) and imipramine (30 mg/kg) after 5-HT depletion with p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA, 100 mg/kg/day for 3 days or 350 mg/kg/day for 2 days) or after pretreatment with 5-HTP (40 mg/kg, to replete 5-HT) as well as pCPA. The frequency-reducing effects produced by buspirone and chlordiazepoxide were unchanged by either dose of pCPA, whereas the frequency-reducing effect of imipramine was completely eliminated by the high dose of pCPA. Pindolol, but not beta-blockers (a combination of metoprolol and ICI118,551), was able to block the effect of imipramine on RSA frequency. Pindolol has been reported to block the effects of buspirone but not chlordiazepoxide. These data suggest that: (1) buspirone obtains its frequency-reducing effects via pre- or post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors rather than 5-HT1A autoreceptors; (2) chlordiazepoxide obtains its frequency-reducing effect via benzodiazepine receptors and GABA with no direct or indirect involvement of 5-HT systems; and (3) imipramine obtains its frequency-reducing effect by increasing the availability of 5-HT at 5-HT1A receptors which are not autoreceptors.", 
    "106": "Long-term treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs has been shown to induce clinical amelioration in patients with chronic heart failure. However, the efficacy of these agents has not been consistent, and the mechanisms of their beneficial effects remain to be established. The present study evaluated the influence of oral metoprolol on symptoms and exercise tolerance of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (3 women and 9 men, left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.45, NYHA functional class II or III). One patient did not tolerate metoprolol, whereas 11 patients terminated the study. After 6 months of beta-blocking therapy, detectable improvements of symptoms (NYHA class and questionnaire-derived symptom score) were observed in 6 patients. Six patients reported an increase in functional capacity [oxygen consumption at peak exercise (VO2p) during cardiopulmonary exercise test]. For the whole group, no significant changes in symptoms and exercise tolerance were detected. During exercise, oxygen pulse (VO2/heart rate) and VO2/RPP (VO2/heart rate/systolic pressure) were significantly increased after 6 months on metoprolol (+35, 9% and +27.1%, respectively; both p < 0.01 vs baseline). In conclusion, beta-blocking therapy was well tolerated by the majority of patients, some of which reported improvement of symptoms and functional capacity. The observed increase on oxygen pulse and Vo2/RPP suggests that beta-blockade may reduce myocardial oxygen requirements in proportion to cardiac work. An increase in the energy available to myocardial cells for synthetic and reparative processes may thus account, at least in part, for the beneficial influence of long-term beta-blockade in heart failure patients.", 
    "107": "To investigate the roles of the autonomic nervous system in the thermic effects of protein and carbohydrates in rats, we determined the urinary excretion of catecholamines and the resting oxygen consumption by means of HPLC-fluorometry and open-circuit respirometry, respectively. Protein administration significantly increased the urinary excretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine over those on water administration. The thermic effect of protein was 16.6% of the basal metabolic rate and was inhibited by phentolamine, prazosin, or atropine, but not by propranolol. These results suggest that the sympathetic nervous system via alpha 1-adrenoceptors and the parasympathetic nervous system are involved in the thermic effect of protein. The administration of carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, and fructose significantly enhanced the urinary excretion of norepinephrine, but only glucose administration increased the urinary excretion of epinephrine. The thermic effects of carbohydrates were 8-9% of the basal metabolic rate and were inhibited by propranolol, but not by phentolamine or atropine. These findings suggest that the sympathetic nervous system via beta-adrenoceptors, but not the parasympathetic nervous system, contributes to the thermic effect of carbohydrates. Thus, we conclude that the autonomic nervous system is involved in the thermic effects of protein and carbohydrates by different mechanisms.", 
    "108": "Tyrosine phosphorylation of the cellular proteins of IL-2-stimulated NK cells was determined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 105-110 kDa protein in a dose-dependent manner. The tyrosine phosphorylation took place within 5 min after the addition of IL-2 to NK cells, and reached a maximal level in 15 min. The degree of the tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with IL-2-induced LAK activity. Staurosporine and pertussis toxin, which slightly suppressed LAK induction, did not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of the 105-110 kDa protein. Genistein, TMB-8 and EGTA completely inhibited LAK induction; however, the calcium channel blocker and chelator did not prevent the protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Anti-IL-2R beta mAb almost completely suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of the 105-110 kDa protein, but anti-IL-2R alpha mAb only slightly suppressed it; this result correlated with that of the suppression of LAK activity. No further suppression of the tyrosine phosphorylation was induced even when both mAbs were added. Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates revealed no association of PLC-gamma 1 or IL-2R beta with the 105-110 kDa protein. These results suggest that both tyrosine phosphorylation of the 105-110 kDa protein and translocation of [Ca++]i are essential for NK-LAK induction, and the tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role in the early stage of IL-2 signalling from the IL-2R beta chain.", 
    "109": "To investigate the distribution and elimination of carteolol in pigmented rabbits, 14C-carteolol eye drops were instilled singly and repeatedly. After single ocular instillation, the radioactivity in the iris and ciliary body reached maximum levels at 24 h. The elimination rate of pigmented tissues decreased at a half-life of approximately 15 days. The concentration of radioactivity in pigmented tissues increased markedly by repeating the ocular instillation and reached a maximum after the 80th repeated instillation. The concentration of radioactivity at 1 h after 80th instillation was 63.7 times that in the iris, 61.1 times that in the ciliary body and 17.2 times that in the retina & choroid after single instillation. No accumulation of radioactivity was found in other ocular tissues.", 
    "110": "Previous studies have shown that beta-adrenergic blocking drugs can reverse ventricular hypertrophy in patients with systemic hypertension. Thirty patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were studied at baseline after withdrawing all previous treatments and after 6 months of treatment with 5-20 mg of bisoprolol, a new beta-selective agent, to assess its possible action on left ventricular mass. Three patients did not finish the study. Blood pressure was reduced to below 160/90 mmHg in 22 of the remaining 27 patients. At the end of follow-up, the left ventricular mass (echocardiography) was reduced from 308.1 +/- 89 g to 262.3 +/- 51 g (p < 0.001) and left ventricular mass index from 165 +/- 47.4 g/m2 to 141.03 +/- 26.7 g/m2 (p < 0.001). The ratio of E wave/A wave velocity of transmitral blood flow measured by Doppler increased from 0.86 +/- 0.44 to 1.07 +/- 0.45 (p = 0.005). Peak filling rate, derived from nuclear ventriculography, changed from 2.05 +/- 0.4 EDV/sec before the treatment to 2.23 +/- 0.47 EDV/sec after it (p = 0.0046). Serum lipids as well as other biochemical tests were unchanged. Left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction did not change, and treadmill exercise time increased from 343 +/- 125 seconds to 420 +/- 135 seconds (p = 0.002). Maximal systolic blood pressure during exercise decreased from 197.2 +/- 19.7 mmHg to 182.9 +/- 25.8 mmHg (p = 0.011). There were few side effects. We conclude that bisoprolol reduces left ventricular mass, preserves systolic function, and improves diastolic function of the left ventricle in hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "111": "In most cases, the antihypertensive therapy for an individual patient is selected through a process of trial and error. This study determined if, by treating each hypertensive patient sequentially, with six antihypertensive drugs, one from each of the major classes, one could decide on the best possible drug for control of hypertension. In a randomized open-label crossover study, 19 patients (16 male and 3 female), 28-70 years of age with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95-110 mm Hg were given atenolol, captopril, clonidine, indapamide, prazosin, and verapamil in a sequential manner. Each drug was started at the minimum recommended or lower dose and titrated upwards every 2 weeks, if well tolerated, until blood pressure was controlled (diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If blood pressure was controlled, the drug was continued for another 2 weeks. A washout period of at least 2 weeks was allowed between drugs. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced significantly with all of the six drugs. In 18 of the 19 patients, blood pressure was controlled with at least one of six drugs, frequently with the lowest dose. The authors conclude that if hypertension is not controlled with the lowest recommended dose of a drug, other antihypertensive drugs should be tried sequentially rather than increasing the dose or adding a second drug.", 
    "112": "Adrenergic receptor blockade has been reported to decrease cardiac adenosine formation and release during hypoxia. We wished to determine whether this occurs by an improvement in the energy supply/demand ratio. Isolated guinea pig hearts were perfused at a constant pressure of 50 mm Hg. Hypoxia (30% O2) was maintained for 20 min while adenosine release and venous PO2 were measured in the coronary venous effluent. beta-adrenergic blockade with 5 microM atenolol did not change hypoxic adenosine release (Control: 15.6 +/- 2.7, Atenolol: 23.6 +/- 5.7 nmol/g/20 min). Addition of 6 microM phentolamine with atenolol significantly reduced hypoxic adenosine release (4.4 +/- 1.4 nmol/g/20 min, P < 0.05). Atenolol was without hemodynamic effects, but addition of phentolamine reduced left ventricular pressure development, heart rate, and oxygen consumption prior to hypoxia. Atenolol plus phentolamine did not change venous PO2 during hypoxia. Treatment with phenoxybenzamine (1 microM) plus atenolol also reduced adenosine release (7.4 +/- 0.8 nmol/g/20 min). Control experiments and atenolol plus phentolamine experiments were repeated using 31P-NMR to measure high energy phosphates. Adrenergic blockade had no effect on phosphate concentrations during normoxia, but resulted in higher [PCr], lower [P(i)] and higher phosphorylation potentials during hypoxia. Adrenergic blockade also prevented the hypoxia-induced rise in intracellular [H+], [AMP] and [ADP] seen in control hearts. The changes in phosphorylation potential are correlated with similar changes in adenosine release in adrenergically intact hearts. We conclude that the primary effect of adrenergic blockade during hypoxia is a reduction in ATP use due to alpha-receptor blockade. This leads to improved high energy phosphate concentrations during hypoxia and a reduction in adenosine formation.", 
    "113": "The effect of social crowding stress on the CRH-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) responsiveness was assessed in rats crowded for 3 days, when the HPA response to neurotransmitter receptors stimulation was powerfully reduced. CRH given systemically dose-dependently increased the secretion of corticosterone. The increase was not affected by pretreatment with prazosin or propranolol, an alpha 1- or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, indicating the lack of involvement of adrenergic receptors in that stimulation. In the corticosterone response to CRH administered icv, a moderate involvement of hypothalamic alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and neuronal noradrenaline seems possible. The corticosterone responses to CRH given by either route to rats exposed to social crowding stress were identical with the responses of unstressed controls. Our results for the first have time shown that social crowding stress does not impair the HPA responsiveness to CRH stimulation.", 
    "114": "This report describes a patient who developed a photosensitivity reaction during the treatment of hypertension with tilisolol hydrochloride, which is a beta-blocker agent Although the data are insufficient to distinguish photoallergy and phototoxicity, clinical and histologic features suggested that the mechanism involved was photoallergic in nature. The action spectrum was mainly the ultraviolet A range. The reaction was reproducible on oral readministration of the drug and exposure to a low dose of UVA. Photopatch testing with the drug was also positive only in the patient. Although the experimental photoallergic reaction was not induced in the guinea pig, phototoxic potential was demonstrated in the animal. To our knowledge, a photosensitivity reaction due to tilisolol hydrochloride has not been previously reported in the English literature.", 
    "115": "Concomitant use of antacid preparations with other medications is common. The potential for antacid-drug interactions is dependent upon the chemistry and physical properties of the antacid preparation. The intragastric release of free aluminum and magnesium ions has potent effects on gastrointestinal function and on drug pharmacokinetics. Antacid-drug interactions may occur secondary to changes in gastrointestinal motility or alterations in gastric and urinary pH. Direct adsorption also results in decreased drug bioavailability. Human drug interaction studies are usually performed with healthy volunteers; extrapolation of these results to clinical situations may not always be valid. However, the current literature would suggest that significant interactions with antacids do occur with certain members of the quinolone, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and cephalosporin classes of drugs. Notable interactions also occur with tetracycline, quinidine, ketoconazole and oral glucocorticoids. These interactions are particularly relevant in the patient with sepsis, cardiac disease or inflammatory syndromes.", 
    "116": "To further evaluate the functional significance of dopamine (DA) receptors in different vasculature, in this study we compared the effects of D1- and D2-receptor agonists on canine coronary and renal arteries by measuring adenylate cyclase (AC) activity as a biomedical index of DA receptor function. It was found that both the selective D1-receptor agonist, fenoldopam, and the D2-receptor agonist, propyl-butyl-dopamine (PBDA), induced a dose-related increases in cAMP formation in coronary and renal arteries; however, the magnitude of increase in the renal artery was remarkably greater than that in the coronary artery. The stimulatory effect on AC activity of fenoldopam was significantly more potent than that of PBDA. The selective D1-receptor antagonist, SCH23390, blocked fenoldopam- and PBDA-induced cAMP production, while the selective D2-receptor antagonist, domperidone, was without effect on the increase of cAMP elicited by PBDA. After beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, fenoldopam still increased the cAMP level significantly but to a much lesser degree. The existence of postsynaptic D2-receptor associated with inhibition of cAMP formation could not be demonstrated in this study. These data suggest the presence of D1-receptors associated with stimulation of AC activity in both renal and coronary arteries. However, there are much fewer receptor sites in the coronary artery than in the renal artery, suggesting less physiological importance of such receptors in the coronary artery than in the renal artery.", 
    "117": "1. We tested the novel thiazole derivative, amthamine, for its ability to stimulate histamine H2-receptors in the human myocardium. 2. Experiments were carried out on isolated, electrically-driven pectinate muscle segments, excised from atrial appendages of patients undergoing corrective heart surgery. 3. Amthamine (0.3-100 microM) induced a positive inotropic activity, resembling histamine in terms of potency and efficacy. In comparison, impromidine was 10-30 times more active than histamine and amthamine, but its maximum effect was significantly lower, while dimaprit was as effective as histamine, but 10 times less potent. 4. The selective histamine H2-blocker, famotidine antagonized in a competitive fashion the amthamine-induced positive inotropic effect. pA2 value of famotidine against amthamine (7.21 +/- 0.45) was close to that measured against histamine (6.88 +/- 0.31) in the same conditions. 5. The effect of amthamine was not modified by beta-adrenoceptor blockade, excluding direct or indirect sympathomimetic activities of the compound. 6. These data provide evidence that amthamine is a selective and full acting histamine H2-receptor agonist in the human heart in vitro.", 
    "118": "The role played by adrenergic, muscarinic and nitric oxide putative neurotransmitters released from autonomic nerve endings onto the pig proximal long posterior ciliary artery (LPCA) was determined. The proximal LPCA in the pig usually supplies both the uveal and retinal circulations. In this study, in vitro ring segments of the artery, passively stretched and with noradrenaline-induced tone, were neurogenically stimulated (NS) using electrical field stimulation with 5-sec trains of 0.2 msec pulses. NS produced a frequency dependent contraction in all vessels which was completely abolished by 10(-6) M tetrodotoxin. 40 Hz stimulation was used throughout the study as it produced a maximal NS contraction. 10(-5) M guanethidine abolished the NS-induced contraction and revealed a NS-induced relaxation, as did the alpha adrenergic blocker, phentolamine, in vessels passively stretched. The beta adrenergic blocker, propranolol, only slightly reduced the NS-induced constriction. In vessels pre-contracted with noradrenaline, NS produced a relaxation (D) which was proportional in magnitude to the tone (C) viz. D = (0.30 +/- 0.04).C + (0.24 +/- 0.06). The muscarinic blocker, atropine, had no effect on the NS-induced relaxation, implying that it is a non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic mediated system. Incubation with Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester reduced the NS-induced relaxation to 48% of its control value, a reduction which was reversed in the presence of excess L-arginine. Damage to endothelial cell function did not reduce the NS-induced relaxation. It is concluded that the autonomic innervation of the proximal LPCA releases both contraction and relaxation neurotransmitters. Contraction is mediated by an alpha adrenergic neurotransmitter. At least two neurotransmitters mediate relaxation, one of which is probably nitric oxide. There is no functional evidence for the release of beta adrenergic neurotransmitter from the sympathetic system or acetylcholine from the parasympathetic system.", 
    "119": "The aim of the study was to analyse the changes in pharmacotherapy of ischaemic heart disease (HD) and arterial hypertension (AH) between 1984 and 1988 using the results of screenings of two independent samples of Warsaw inhabitants. In this period the prevalence of IHD in Warsaw population aged 35-64 increased by 4.3% (from 30.3% to 31.6%) as well as the percentage of treated subjects by 19.5% (from 39.0% to 46.6%). Prevalence of arterial hypertension (AH) decreased in this period by 4.7% (from 35.8% to 34.1%) whereas the percentage of undertaking pharmacotherapy in these patients increased by 47.9% (from 33.8% to 50.0%) as well as the effectiveness of undertaken treatment (goal of treatment: < or = 160/95 mmHg) increased by 115.8% (from 22.8% to 49.2%). In subjects with IHD selected from general population the consumption of nitrates, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers increased and these drugs were the most frequently taken in IHD. In treatment of AH diuretics, the most frequently used in 1984, were replaced, to some extent, in 1988 by beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. Consumption of drugs by general population, expressed in DDD/1000 i/day, changed too--the consumption of beta blockers increased in 1988 twice, of calcium channel blockers 3-fold and of nitrates 1.5 fold, whereas that of dipyridamole decreased by 60%, while comparing of these consumption in 1984.", 
    "120": "We studied the effects of angiotensin (Ang) I and II in a variety of isolated human cardiac tissues contracting under physiological conditions (37 degrees C, 60 beats.min-1). Ang I and II consistently increased the peak developed force of human atrial muscles by 30-40%, an effect that was completely blocked by 10(-6) M saralasine, but not by the combination of prazosin and propranolol. However, neither Ang I or II had significant inotropic effects in right and left ventricular human preparations. We were also able to demonstrate that the positive inotropic effect of Ang II in human right atrial tissue is mediated by the AT1 receptor subtype but not the AT2 receptor subtype.", 
    "121": "Clenbuterol (10-100 microM), a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, potentiated basal (unstimulated) and electrical stimulation-evoked release of 3H-norepinephrine from cerebral cortical slices in a concentration-dependent manner. The beta-adrenergic antagonists propranolol and ICI 118,551 did not antagonize the facilitatory effect of clenbuterol on basal 3H-norepinephrine efflux. Selective down-regulation of beta 2-adrenergic receptors produced by chronic administration of clenbuterol also did not alter this effect of in vitro clenbuterol, despite marked reductions in the density of these receptors. These results suggest that the increase in basal efflux of 3H-norepinephrine observed with clenbuterol was not mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The facilitatory effect of clenbuterol on basal 3H-norepinephrine efflux was Ca(2+)-independent, which may indicate an amphetamine-like mechanism of action. The enhanced basal efflux of 3H-norepinephrine produced by clenbuterol was stereoselective; there was a four-fold increase in basal 3H-norepinephrine efflux with the (+)-isomer of clenbuterol compared with that induced by the (-)-isomer; this contrasts with the stereoselectivity of the isomers for interacting with beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The present results may explain some of the behavioral actions of clenbuterol, particularly those observed after long-term treatment, and may be relevant to the antidepressant actions of this compound.", 
    "122": "We have characterized a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP, EC 3.1.3.4) that is associated with cell membranes from rat brain using [32P]phosphatidic acid as substrate in a simple assay. The enzyme could be activated by Triton X-100, cholic acid and Chaps and inhibited by Lubrol PX and sodium dodecyl sulfate. The optimal pH was between 6.0 and 7.0 Mg2+ was not essential for enzyme activity. The enzyme activity was decreased by about 50% by Ca2+ at concentrations of 0.1 to 1 mmol/l. Zn2+ inhibited the enzyme by 50% at concentrations of about 10 mumol/l in the absence of, and 100 nmol/l in the presence (3 mmol/l) of, Triton X-100. NaF decreased the activity by about 50% at concentrations between 0.3 and 1 mmol/l when Triton X-100 was added, but did not inhibit the enzyme if the detergent was not present. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) did not affect the enzyme. In the absence of Triton X-100, propranolol and metoprolol enhanced the PAP activity. In the presence of 3 mmol/l Triton X-100, the enzyme was inhibited by about 50% by propranolol at a concentration of 10 mmol/l, whereas metoprolol caused only a slight inhibition of PAP. The Km for phosphatidic acid was 150 mumol/l and was changed to 20 mumol/l by 3 mmol/l Triton X-100 without the Vmax being changed. Enzyme activity could be solubilized by 1-5% (w/v) Triton X-100. Gel filtration chromatography showed a M(r) of 320,000. This membrane-associated PAP from neuronal tissue probably belongs among the NEM-insensitive forms of PAP enzymes which have been proposed to play a role in transmembrane signal transduction via phospholipase D.", 
    "123": "Elementary K+ currents were recorded at 19 degrees C in inside-out patches from cultured neonatal rat cardiocytes to elucidate the block phenomenology in cardiac ATP-sensitive K+ channels when inhibitory drug molecules, such as the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, the phenylalkylamine verapamil or sulfonamide derivatives (HE 93 and sotalol), are interacting in an attempt to stress the hypothesis of multiple channel-associated drug targets. Similar to their adult relatives, neonatal cardiac K(ATP) channels are characterized by very individual open state kinetics, even in cytoplasmically well-controlled, cell-free conditions; at -7 mV, tau open(1) ranged from 0.7 to 4.9 msec in more than 200 patches and tau open(2) from 10 to 64 msec--an argument for a heterogeneous channel population. Nevertheless, a common response to drugs was observed. Glibenclamide and the other inhibitory molecules caused long-lasting interruptions of channel activity, after cytoplasmic application, as if drug occupancy trapped cardiac K(ATP) channels in a very stable, nonconducting configuration. The resultant NPo depression was strongest with glibenclamide (apparent IC50 13 nmol/liter) and much weaker with verapamil (apparent IC50 9 mumol/liter), HE 93 (apparent IC50 29 mumol/liter) and sotalol (apparent IC50 43 mumol/liter) and may have resulted from the occupancy of a single site with drug-specific affinity or of two sites, the high affinity glibenclamide target and a distinct nonglibenclamide, low affinity target. Changes in open state kinetics, particularly in the transition between the O1 state and the O2 state, are other manifestations of drug occupancy of the channel. Any inhibitory drug molecule reduced the likelihood of attaining the O2 state, consistent with a critical reduction of the forward rate constant governing the O1-O2 transition. But only HE 93 (10 mumol/liter) associated (with an apparent association rate constant of 2.3 x 10(6) mol-1 sec-1) to shorten significantly tau open(2) to 60.6 +/- 6% of the pre-drug value, not the expected result when the entrance in and the exit from the O2 state would be drug-unspecifically influenced. Sotalol found yet another and definitely distinctly located binding site to interfere with K+ permeation; both enantiomers associated with a rate close to 5 x 10(5) mol-1 sec-1 with the open pore thereby flicker-blocking cardiac K(ATP) channels. Clearly, these channels accommodate more than one drug-binding domain."
