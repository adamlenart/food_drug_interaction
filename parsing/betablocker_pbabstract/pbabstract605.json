Several compounds in the 2-(arylamino)-9,10-dimethoxy-6,7-dihydro-4H-pyrimido [6,1-a]isoquinolin-4-one series display a high order of activity. The most active compounds are the alkyl derivatives of the 2-mesitylamino/2-mesitylimino tautomeric forms. The 2-(mesitylimino)-3-methyl analogue trequinsin is a potent antihypertensive agent and displays a hemodynamic profile characteristic of an arteriolar dilator. It is also a potent inhibitor of both cAMP phosphodiesterase and platelet aggregation.", 
    "1": "We have examined the analysis of pharmacodynamic data in normal subjects receiving propranolol, flecainide or the two together. We find that a second-order polynomial describes accurately the response of the left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output and vascular resistance of the subjects to these drugs. Both single dose and multiple doses of propranolol (80 mg 3 times a day) decreased the left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output, but increased the vascular resistance. On the other hand, single and multiple doses of flecainide (200 mg twice a day) decreased the left ventricular ejection fraction but did not affect either the cardiac output or vascular resistance. These data demonstrate the power of the polynomial formulation in analyzing pharmacodynamic data.", 
    "2": "The mechanism of autoregulation of cardiac cycle length during phasic alterations in perfusion via the sinus node artery is unclear. Inasmuch as transient catecholamine release has been documented during sinus node artery injections, we sought to determine whether autoregulation of cycle length might be related to a beta receptor-mediated process. We used chloralose-anesthetized mongrel dogs. A right thoracotomy was performed, the vagi and sympathetic inputs to the heart were cut and electrograms were recorded from the sinoatrial (SA) node, right atrium, right ventricle and His bundle. The SA node artery was catheterized and distribution verified. Perfusion of normal Tyrode's solution via the SA node artery at 3 ml/min resulted in significant cycle length slowing which was maximal immediately after onset of perfusion. Plots of the derivative of cycle length with respect to time indicated either a monophasic or biphasic pattern of response. Administration of propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.) resulted in a significant prolongation of control cycle length. Perfusion of normal Tyrode's solution after propranolol resulted in significantly greater degrees of cycle length prolongation (as judged by integration of area under cycle length curves) as well as only monophasic response patterns. These results suggest that infusions of normal Tyrode's solution, via the SA node artery, at physiologic flow rates are accompanied by concurrent catecholamine release throughout the infusion. This catecholamine release may contribute to the homeostatic regulation of cardiac cycle length.", 
    "3": "The relation of peripheral circulatory adjustments to exercise training during long-term beta-adrenergic blockade has not been investigated. In 12 healthy men aged 22 to 34 years, blood flow in the calf was evaluated with submaximal exercise before and after a 6 week aerobic conditioning program. During conditioning, six subjects received no drug and six received propranolol, 80 to 120 mg/day in divided doses. Treated and control subjects were studied on entry and at the conclusion of a conditioning program, 72 hours after drug withdrawal in subjects given propranolol. The training was intensive and equivalent in both groups. Control subjects increased maximal oxygen uptake from 47.5 +/- 1.1 to 51.4 +/- 0.4 ml/kg per min (p less than 0.05), whereas those on propranolol did not improve. Immediately after exercise, blood flow in the calf was measured with strain gauge plethysmography after 3 minutes of supine exertion on a cycle ergometer. In control subjects, flow decreased from 15.7 +/- 1.6 to 14.0 +/- 1.4 ml/100 ml per min at 300 kg-m/min of exertion (p less than 0.05) and from 26.5 +/- 3.8 to 21.8 +/- 2.3 ml/100 ml per min at 700 kg-m/min (p less than 0.05). Vascular resistance was unchanged in these subjects at 300 kg-m/min (6.1 +/- 0.8 to 6.7 +/- 1.0 pru) (p = NS), but increased at 700 kg-m/min (4.2 +/- 0.8 to 4.8 +/- 0.7 pru) (p less than 0.05). In subjects given propranolol, no change in flow or resistance occurred after training at either work load.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Nadolol and propranolol effects on lidocaine elimination were followed in six healthy men and women. Each received three separate 30-hr infusions of lidocaine (2 mg/min): one alone, one after 3 days pretreatment with nadolol (160 mg daily), and one after 3 days pretreatment with propranolol (80 mg every 8 hr). Liver blood flow was determined by the systemic clearance of indocyanine green. Steady-state plasma lidocaine levels were increased by nadolol (2.1 +/- 0.2 to 2.7 +/- 0.3 micrograms/ml) and by propranolol (2.1 +/- 0.2 to 2.5 +/- 0.3 micrograms/ml). Lidocaine plasma clearance was decreased by nadolol (1030 +/- 81 to 850 +/- 82 ml/min) and by propranolol (1030 +/- 81 to 866 +/- 75 ml/min). Hepatic blood flow was decreased by nadolol (1275 +/- 77 to 902 +/- 102 ml/min) and propranolol (1275 +/- 77 to 957 +/- 119 ml/min). The hepatic extraction ratio for lidocaine was increased by nadolol (0.86 +/- 0.06 to 0.91 +/- 0.05) and by propranolol (0.86 +/- 0.06 to 0.90 +/- 0.06). Lidocaine intrinsic clearance was not changed by nadolol (8.19 +/- 1.87 to 9.52 +/- 2.36 l/min) or propranolol (8.19 +/- 1.87 to 9.50 +/- 3.13 l/min). Our data indicate that both nadolol and propranolol reduce lidocaine clearance by their effects on hepatic blood flow and not by inhibition of lidocaine metabolism.", 
    "5": "The relative roles of prostaglandins and the sympathetic nervous system in mediating the hypotensive effects of hydralazine were studied in awake dogs with and without pretreatment with indomethacin, propranolol, and phentolamine. In normal dogs, mean aortic pressure decreased 23 +/- 4 mm Hg after administration of hydralazine (cumulative dose of 0.8 mg/kg). This hypotensive effect of hydralazine was potentiated by phentolamine but was abolished by propranolol. Indomethacin caused a paradoxic pressor response (11 +/- 3 mm Hg) to hydralazine, which also was abolished by addition of phentolamine. Hydralazine produced vasodilation in the coronary, skeletal muscle (quadriceps), splanchnic, and renal circulations in normal dogs. The increase in coronary blood flow was associated with increased cardiac oxygen consumption and narrowed arteriovenous oxygen difference across the heart. Propranolol reduced the increases in cardiac oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow, but only indomethacin abolished the narrowed arteriovenous oxygen difference, suggesting that the increase in coronary blood flow was related to both the increased cardiac oxygen demand and prostaglandin-mediated active coronary vasodilation. The decrease in skeletal muscle vascular resistance after hydralazine was abolished by propranolol. Skeletal muscle vascular resistance actually increased after administration of hydralazine in dogs pretreated with both propranolol and indomethacin. These effects were blocked by the addition of phentolamine. Unlike the normal response, renal and splanchnic vascular resistances increased after administration of hydralazine in dogs pretreated with indomethacin. The splanchnic vasoconstriction was abolished by phentolamine, but the renal vascular change was affected by neither phentolamine nor propranolol. The results indicate that hydralazine does not produce uniform vasodilation in all organs and that the cardiovascular actions of hydralazine involve both prostaglandins and the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "6": "Platelets possess alpha 2-adrenergic and serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptors which are thought to mediate the in vitro proaggregatory effects of epinephrine and serotonin, respectively. However, their importance in platelet aggregation in vivo is uncertain. In the present study, we evaluate the ability of yohimbine and ketanserin, relatively selective alpha 2-adrenergic and serotonin antagonists, respectively, to alter cyclic flow reductions in stenosed coronary arteries in open-chest, anesthetized dogs. These cyclic flow reductions, characterized by progressive declines in coronary blood flow interrupted by abrupt and, often spontaneous, restorations of flow, were produced by cylindrical constrictors placed on the left anterior descending coronary artery. A pulsed Doppler flow probe, placed proximal to the constrictor, was used to measure coronary blood flow. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured with 15-micron radiolabeled microspheres before coronary constriction and when coronary blood flow appeared to be at its nadir and zenith during cyclic flow reductions. After the cyclic flow reductions had been observed for 1 hour, yohimbine (1-2 mg/kg), ketanserin (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg), or saline was given, and coronary blood flow and hemodynamics were monitored for another hour. The frequency of cyclic flow reductions and the mean of the three lowest nadirs of coronary blood flow (mean +/- SE) were compared between the first and second hours. Ketanserin, at doses of 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg, virtually abolished cyclic flow reductions in all dogs tested. Yohimbine [1 mg/kg ( n = 14)] was partially effective in reducing the frequency (9.6 vs. 5.5 cyclic flow reductions/hr) and severity of cyclic flow reductions (nadirs of coronary blood flow = 6.2 +/- 2.4 vs. 20.9 +/- 6.1% of control). A higher dose of yohimbine [2 mg/kg (n = 7)] was no more effective. The frequency (9.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 9.3 +/- 1.0 CFR/hr) and severity (17.4 +/- 5.4 vs. 12.4 +/- 3.9% of control coronary blood flow) of cyclic flow reductions were not changed by saline. The relatively selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin (0.01 mg/kg, iv), and the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (1-2 mg/kg, iv), did not affect the frequency or severity of cyclic flow reductions. Thus, the abilities of yohimbine to inhibit and ketanserin to abolish cyclic flow reductions in stenosed canine coronary arteries suggest that serotonin and, possibly, alpha 2-adrenergic agonists may influence cyclic flow alterations importantly in this model.", 
    "7": "From the literature which has appeared over the last decade a selection was made of the three major calcium antagonists: nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem. In the clinical situation, the net hemodynamic and electrophysiological effect of these drugs is the result of complex interactions between their peripheral and their central effects. The degree of baroceptor stimulation and reflex mediated beta-adrenergic activity, which counteracts and influences the intrinsic negative dromotopic, chronotopic and inotropic effects of calcium antagonists, are related to the degree of peripheral dilation. Nifedipine is the most potent arterial vasodilator and is consequently associated with the most intense reflex adrenergenic activity. Although their effects on vascular and cardiac muscle are similar but not identical, there exist major differences in their antiarrhythmic properties. All act as an antiarrhythmic agent when ischemia or reperfusion cause the arrhythmias, while verapamil selectively blocks the A-V node conduction. All three discussed calcium antagonists are effective in treating patients with coronary spasm, variant angina and unstable angina. In our personal experience with 73 patients with unstable angina with prolonged severe pain at rest with transient ST-segments and T-wavechanges without elevated enzyme levels, 21 became asymptomatic within 8 hours of treatment with conventional therapy, which included nitrates and betablockers. Of 52 who remained refractory to such therapy, the addition of 10 mg of nifedipine orally every two hours to a maximum of 60 mg rendered 42 of the 52 asymptomatic within 8 hours. Arguments why we believe that the timely administration of nifedipine to these and similar patients will reduce or delay the incidence of arrhythmias and myocardial infarction are given on the basis of experimental data. Nifedipine greatly dilates coronary arteries, an effect which persists even after the drug's general hemodynamic effects disappear. It is shown that antagonists have anti-ischemic properties which are primarily related to the persistent reduction of the basic coronary vascular tone which increases oxygen supply whilst reduced myocardial contractility leads to decreased oxygen consumption. Furthermore, preservation of cellular integrity is achieved via protection against intracellular Ca2+ excess, as demonstrated by preserved intracellular high energy phosphate. A randomized multicenter trial in the Netherlands is now in progress to clarify the definitive role of beta blockade versus calcium antagonists therapy of their combination in this syndrome.", 
    "8": "Synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was injected intravenously into conscious, adult toads (Bufo marinus) to elucidate the nervous and cardiovascular actions of the hormone. GnRH (0.001-1.0 nmol X kg-1) produced dose-dependent increases in mean arterial blood pressure and pulse pressure, beginning within 3 min after injection. These pressor responses to GnRH were specific to the hormone since they could be inhibited reversibly by [D-pGlu1, D-Phe2, D-Trp3,6]-GnRH. Arterial plasma concentrations of unconjugated catecholamines increased simultaneously with the rise in blood pressure following GnRH injection: the half-maximal pressor dose of GnRH (0.1 nmol X kg-1) caused a 3-fold increase in plasma noradrenaline and a 20-fold increase in plasma adrenaline concentrations. Pretreatment of toads with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin, and a beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, abolished the pressor responses to GnRH. We conclude that GnRH mobilizes catecholamines, which act through alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms to raise blood pressure. Thus, endogenous GnRH or GnRH-like peptides may coordinate the pituitary, nervous and cardiovascular mechanisms which prepare toads for seasonal reproductive activity.", 
    "9": "Effects of direct or indirect (nerve-mediated) muscle stimulation, acetylcholine (ACh), caffeine and procaine on the membrane and mechanical properties of smooth muscle cells of the cat trachea were investigated by means of double sucrose-gap and isometric tension recording methods. Outward current pulses (2 s in duration) applied to the muscle tissue in the presence of tetrodotoxin (10(-7)M), atropine (10(-6)M) and propranolol (10(-6)M) evoked no action potential (spike); however, when the depolarization exceeded 9 mV, a contraction was evoked. The spike and contraction evoked by outward current pulses in the presence of tetraethylammonium (TEA, 10 mM) were suppressed by treatment of the tissue with either Ca2+-free EGTA (2 mM) containing solution or Mn2+ (5 mM). In the presence of procaine (10 mM), outward current pulses evoked an action potential but no contraction. Field stimulation of short duration (50 microseconds) applied to the whole tissue produced an excitation of the intrinsic nerves and evoked excitatory junction potentials (e.j.ps), and when the amplitude of e.j.ps exceeded 4 mV, a twitch contraction occurred. E.j.p. was more effective in producing a contraction than was the membrane depolarization evoked by outward current pulses. Amplitudes of contractions evoked by exogenous ACh (10(-5)M) were much larger than those evoked by 128 mM-[K]0 or caffeine (10 mM), in normal Krebs solution. When the amplitudes of the contractions produced by 128 mM [K]0 were defined as a relative amplitude of 1.0, the mean amplitudes of contraction produced by ACh (10(-5)M) or caffeine were 2.5 +/- 0.20 or 1.2 +/- 0.26, respectively. In Ca2+-free EGTA (2 mM)-containing solution, the contraction induced by 128 mM-[K]0 was rapidly abolished, whereas the contractions evoked by caffeine (10 mM) or the initial phasic contraction produced by ACh (10(-5)M) were largely unaffected. When the amount of Ca2+ stored in the muscle cell was estimated from the amplitude of caffeine-induced contraction evoked in Ca2+-free solution, procaine (10 mM) applied simultaneously with Ca2+, after depletion of Ca2+ from the cells by means of caffeine, increased the amount of Ca2+ stored to 1.31 +/- 0.14 (n = 6) times the control value. However, ACh (10(-7)M) or excess concentrations of [K]0 applied with Ca2+ did not increase the amount of Ca2+ stored in the caffeine-sensitive intracellular compartment. 8 These results indicate that the amount of Ca2 + stored in the smooth muscle cells of the cat trachea may be larger than other visceral smooth muscle and plays an important role in the initiation of contraction, in response to endogenous or exogenous ACh.", 
    "10": "During a 3 year period, seventy patients aged 53 +/- 16 years with a total of 73 arrhythmias were treated over a mean period of 6.8 months (maximum 27 months) with oral propafenone, the usual dose being 900 mg/day. The study covered the whole spectrum of cardiac arrhythmias (32 supraventricular, 41 ventricular), and their relation to the autonomic nervous system. The efficacy was scored from 1 (no effect) to 5 (complete control) as judged by the clinical response, the results of Holter monitoring (175 control and 133 test recordings on therapy), and a comparison was made between the effects of propafenone and other antiarrhythmics: quinidine-like drugs, beta-blockers and amiodarone. With respect to supraventricular arrhythmias: 9 cases of vagally-induced atrial flutter and fibrillation were unaffected by propafenone (mean score = 1.1). On the other hand, the drug was very effective (mean score = 4.1) in 8 cases of adrenergic atrial arrhythmias. In 12 arrhythmias with more varied mechanisms (extrasystoles, tachysystole, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) an intermediate score was obtained (2.8). Three cases of resistant junctional tachycardia due to reentry were improved. At ventricular level, 5 cases of extrasystole sensitive to quinidine were also improved by propafenone (4.6); the difference was more clearcut in 8 cases of benign idiopathic tachycardia (propafenone: 4.1, and quinidine: 2.4). This was more marked in 13 cases of more severe arrhythmia in diseased hearts in which the effect of propafenone (4.1) was superior even to that of amiodarone. However, propafenone was less effective (3.3) than amiodarone in 4 cases of severe polymorphic idiopathic ventricular tachycardia closely related to the autonomic nervous system. The antiarrhythmic effect of propafenone was appreciable in 10 cases of resistant post-infarction ventricular tachycardia, eventually in association with amiodarone. Slowing of the sinus rhythm (-11.6%) with no change in the day/night ratio was due to beta-inhibition. However, in toxic doses this may progress to sinoatrial block (9 cases). A lengthening of the PR interval and duration of QRS was common, but this was not complicated by torsade de pointes, one case of which was successfully treated by propafenone. Secondary gastro-intestinal effects and vertigo were rarely severe enough to warrant stopping therapy. In conclusion, these results show that the introduction of propafenone is a valuable therapeutic advance in the treatment of arrhythmias, especially in those with a favoring adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "11": "To clarify the impact of hypothermia on the hormonal control of glucose metabolism, rats were rendered hypothermic (25 C) after catheterization of the portal vein. Glucose, insulin, glucagon, and catecholamine concentrations were serially monitored, and the regional blood flows were measured, allowing the estimation of hormone outputs. Hypothermia reduced the portal blood flow by 50% without changing arterial blood pressure, blood gases, or pH. Portal plasma insulin secretion dropped (0.05 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.04 mU/min), and glucagon secretion increased (0.81 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.38 +/- 0.10 ng/min). The B cell responses to glucose, arginine, and glucagon were abolished, while the A cell response to arginine was not significantly affected. Glucose intolerance was apparent after iv glucose or arginine loads. Haloperidol and to a lesser extent phentolamine suppressed the cold-induced glucagon rise. Phentolamine and to a lesser extent haloperidol alleviated the cold-induced suppression of insulin release. Propranolol, naloxone, and atropine were relatively inactive. The cold-induced glucose intolerance was not corrected by phentolamine treatment. A marked resistance to iv insulin was apparent in these rats, which is in contrast to a normal sensitivity to iv glucagon.", 
    "12": "The electrophysiological effects of prostacyclin (PGI2) were studied in 10 normal patients. Programmed stimulation was performed before and after infusion of 2.5, 5, 10 ng kg-1 min-1 of PGI2. Then, 0.2 mg kg-1 of propranolol was added to the higher dose of PGI2. We observed a net decrease of the systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure beginning with the lowest dose. There was no effect on sinus node recovery time, atrial, His-Purkinje and ventricular effective refractory periods, AH and HV intervals. Atrioventricular (AV) nodal effective and functional refractory periods could be measured in 5 patients and were decreased in all cases. Sinus cycle length and anterograde and retrograde Wenckebach cycle lengths were significantly decreased by PGI2 in a dose dependent manner. The injection of propranolol increased all these values but did not suppress entirely the effects of PGI2. In conclusion, the electrophysiological effects of PGI2 were marked decreases of sinus cycle length and AV nodal refractoriness which may be partly related to enhanced sympathetic activity.", 
    "13": "The National Registry of Drug-induced Ocular Side Effects has accumulated 13 cases of possible major haemopoietic responses from topical ocular chloramphenicol. Over 75 cases of major haemopoietic events from carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are also reviewed. While numerous reports of local ocular effects secondary to timolol have been received by the Registry, the more significant adverse effects are the same systemic side effects seen with any beta-receptor blocking agent. Data in the Registry have shown that allopurinol may be possibly associated with cataract formation. Severe cardiovascular effects with elevated blood pressure and stroke are uncommon systemic adverse reactions following topical ophthalmic 10% phenylephrine, but these systemic effects have also been seen secondary to concentrations of 2.5%. Other drugs, such as adrenaline (epinephrine), ecothiopate (echothiophate), practolol, thiabendazole, and penicillamine are suspected of causing ocular pseudopemphigoid.", 
    "14": "The increase in plasma renin activity produced by p-chloroamphetamine in unanesthetized rats is blocked by p-chlorophenylalanine and by lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus and the mediobasal hypothalamus. To determine whether the pathway from these areas of the brain to the kidneys that mediates the renin response is sympathetic, the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade and ganglionic blockade on the renin response to p-chloroamphetamine was studied. The increase in plasma renin activity 60 min after the administration of p-chloroamphetamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was prevented by the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)-propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.p.), but not by (+)-propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.p.), given 30 min before p-chloroamphetamine. Sotalol (30 mg/kg, i.p.) injected 30 min before p-chloroamphetamine also blocked the renin response. The ganglionic-blocking drug chlorisondamine lowered blood pressure and increased plasma renin activity by itself. However, p-chloroamphetamine administered 30 min after chlorisondamine produced no further increase in plasma renin activity. Chlorisondamine, by itself, did not produce maximal secretion of renin, since isoproterenol, 30 min after chlorisondamine, produced a large increase in plasma renin activity. The data indicate that the increase in plasma renin activity produced by p-chloroamphetamine is mediated via the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "15": "The effects of several agents on the rates of the fructose 6-phosphate/fructose 1,6-bisphosphate substrate cycle were measured in incubated epitrochlearis muscles of the rat by monitoring the transfer of radiolabel from [6-14C]glucose to the 1-position of glucose residues in glycogen. The cycling rates observed were almost identical with those previously obtained by using the well-established dual-isotope technique. In particular, it was found that the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline increased the cycling rate about 12-fold.", 
    "16": "We describe the results of a prospective study in which 120 women who developed hypertension in the last trimester of pregnancy were randomly allocated in double blind manner to atenolol or placebo. The mean duration of treatment was five weeks. The only difference between groups during the neonatal period was in respiratory distress syndrome, mainly related to spontaneous premature labour, which occurred in six placebo group babies but in none from the atenolol group. Fifty five children from each group have been followed to 1 year of age. All in the atenolol group are developing normally but one child from the placebo group is brain damaged. These findings do not suggest any short or medium term paediatric complications after the use of beta blockers in pregnancy.", 
    "17": "The contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to the thermic effect of intravenously infused glucose and insulin was studied in 10 healthy young men before and after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol during conditions of normoglycemia (90 mg/dl) at two levels of hyperinsulinemia (approximately 90 microU/ml and approximately 620 microU/ml). During steady state conditions of glucose uptake (0.515 +/- 0.046 and 0.754 +/- 0.056 g/min), significant increases were observed in energy expenditure (0.10 +/- 0.02 kcal/min, P less than 0.001, and 0.21 +/- 0.02 kcal/min, P less than 0.01, respectively). Similarly, glucose oxidation increased from 0.100 +/- 0.015 to 0.266 +/- 0.022 g/min (P less than 0.001) at approximately microU/ml insulin and from 0.082 +/- 0.013 to 0.295 +/- 0.018 g/min (P less than 0.001) at approximately 620 microU/ml insulin. Concomitantly, the rate of nonoxidative glucose disposal or \"glucose storage\" was 0.249 +/- 0.033 and 0.459 +/- 0.048 g/min, respectively. At this time the thermic effect of infused glucose/insulin was 5.3 +/- 0.9 and 7.5 +/- 0.7%, and the energy cost of \"glucose storage\" was 0.50 +/- 0.16 kcal/g and 0.47 +/- 0.04 kcal/g at the two different levels of glucose uptake. After beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol, glucose uptake, oxidation, and \"storage\" were unchanged in both studies, but significant decreases in energy expenditure were observed (1.41 +/- 0.06-1.36 +/- 0.05 kcal/min, P less than 0.01 at approximately 90 microU/ml insulin, and 1.52 +/- 0.07-1.43 +/- 0.05 kcal/min, P less than 0.005 at approximately 620 microU/ml insulin) causing significant falls in both the estimated thermic effect of infused glucose/insulin and the energy cost of \"glucose storage\". Regression analysis of the results from both studies indicated a mean energy cost for \"glucose storage\" of 0.36 kcal/g (r = 0.74, P less than 0.001), which fell significantly (P less than 0.005) to 0.21 kcal/g (r = 0.49, P less than 0.05) during beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol. The latter is in close agreement with that calculated on theoretical grounds for the metabolic cost of glucose storage as glycogen, i.e., obligatory thermogenesis. It is concluded that beta-adrenergically mediated sympathetic nervous activity is responsible for almost the entire rise in energy expenditure in excess of the obligatory requirements for processing and storing glucose during conditions of normoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in healthy man, and that the energy cost of \"glucose storage\" is not different at normal (approximately 90 microU/ml) and supraphysiological (approximately 620 microU/ml) plasma insulin concentrations.", 
    "18": "Rings of isolated epicardial coronary arteries made to contract with prostaglandin F2 alpha relax when their sympathetic nerves are stimulated. This response, which is the opposite of that seen in other systemic blood vessels, results from activation by norepinephrine (NE) of beta 1 adrenoceptors, which predominate over alpha 1 adrenoceptors in the main coronary arteries. A modest contraction occurs only when the beta 1 adrenoceptors are blocked. As each branch leaves the main artery, only beta 1 adrenoceptors are present, so that the sole effect of NE is to cause relaxation. Like the terminations of other sympathetic nerves, those to the main coronary arteries or their branch vessels contain alpha 2 adrenoceptors that when activated reduce the output of neurotransmitter. When these prejunctional receptors are inhibited with phentolamine, there is a greater relaxation in response to activation of the sympathetic nerves, which is caused by increased release of NE. Thus, the in vivo observation that phentolamine increases coronary blood flow may be explained by the action of this drug on prejunctional alpha 2 adrenoceptors rather than on alpha 1 adrenoceptors on the smooth muscle cells themselves.", 
    "19": "This review of adrenergic control of coronary arteries is based on studies conducted on isolated vessels. Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors are present in the coronary vasculature but with different distributions. The large coronary arteries have a larger percentage of alpha receptors, which mediate contraction, whereas the small coronary arteries are equipped almost exclusively with beta receptors, which mediate relaxation. The beta receptors are of the subclass beta 1. Both alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptors are present in the large coronaries. The alpha 2 receptors are prejunctional and inhibit neuronal release of norepinephrine (NE), and are also postjunctional and mediate contraction of the vascular smooth muscle. Evidence is reviewed suggesting that coronary alpha and beta receptors may be different conformational states of the same parent macromolecule in which the alpha state predominates at lower temperatures. Contrary to these results we have observed that whereas the response of the large coronary artery to NE at 39 C is predominantly constriction, it is predominantly dilation at 29 C. The characteristic of the adrenergic receptor is clearly temperature dependent.", 
    "20": "Only recently have the cardiac actions of parathyroid hormone and its N-terminal (1-34) fragment (bPTH(1-34] been examined. Parathyroid hormone was found to exert a positive chronotropic effect on the heart tissue of several mammals and one amphibian in vivo and/or in vitro. The purpose of the present study was to examine in vitro the heart tissue of several lower vertebrates, particularly aquatic vertebrates, for responsiveness to bPTH(1-34) and, for comparative purposes, isoproterenol. Heart tissue (atrium or the entire heart) from all the animals studied (trout, mudpuppy, bullfrog tadpole, and adult bullfrog) responded to isoproterenol in a dose-dependent fashion with increased heart rate and contractile force. Only the atria from the adult bullfrog, however, responded in a similar manner to the administration of bPTH(1-34). In all cases propranalol (10(-6) M) was able to block both chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoproterenol but had no effect on the cardiac stimulation induced by bPTH(1-34) in the adult bullfrog atrium. The data suggests that cardiac responsiveness to bPTH(1-34) is associated with a terrestrial as opposed to an aquatic existence.", 
    "21": "This review deals with circulatory adjustments occurring in the limb arteries of hypertensive patients. Measurements of regional blood flow are mandatory, because conclusions drawn from calculated total peripheral resistance often are not applicable to local vascular beds. Limb arteries, which can be followed by easy and noninvasive methods, often are the first choice for study of regional circulation. In this discussion, a few historic studies are cited first; next, the data available on skeletal muscle (forearm and calf) and skin (finger) circulation are reviewed, to show that flow through both muscle and skin is increased in mild and moderate hypertension, while there is a trend to lower values in more severe hypertension. Our own data are derived from 51 untreated patients showing mild to moderate hypertension, matched to 23 normotensive subjects. Flow is measured simultaneously with an ECG-triggered venous occlusion plethysmograph at calf and finger. At rest, calf and finger blood flows are significantly higher and calculated resistance is lower in hypertensive subjects; during reactive hyperemia, blood flow remains higher in hypertensive subjects but calculated resistance increases up to values that are higher, compared to normotensive control subjects; these data are compatible with structural changes in the vascular wall.", 
    "22": "Beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation with isoproterenol (IP) rapidly and reversibly rounded and arborized smooth muscle cells (SMC) cultured from rat aorta. The arborized SMC remained firmly attached to the substratum via a network of long, dendritelike processes. Arborization of the SMC correlated closely with increases in cellular cAMP produced by IP and a variety of other compounds. The intracellular calcium antagonist 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8) also rounded and arborized the SMC. Antitubulin compounds potently blocked arborized by IP, dibutyryl cAMP, and TMB-8. The release of cell-bound 45Ca2+ was followed in the presence and absence of IP. IP strikingly increased the amount of 45Ca2+ that remained cell bound between 20 and 120 min. Propranolol and colchicine prevented IP from inhibiting the release of cell-bound 45Ca2+. These results suggest that the modulation of Ca2+ transport is involved in the arborization of cultured SMC by cAMP.", 
    "23": "The addition of micromolar quantities of dopamine stimulated ion transport in the isolated rabbit corneal epithelium. This response was blocked by pretreatment with the dopamine antagonist, haloperidol, and by the elimination of Cl- from the bathing solutions. The beta-adrenergic antagonist, timolol, was also a potent inhibitor of the epithelial response to dopamine. The presence of the serotonin antagonist, methysergide, or the dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibitor, FLA-63, did not significantly alter the corneal response to dopamine. Following superior cervical ganglionectomy, the epithelial response to dopamine was abolished. These findings are consistent with the idea that Cl- secretion in the rabbit corneal epithelium can be modulated by preterminal dopamine receptors located on the sympathetic nerve fibers; therefore, dopamine stimulation appears to be a serial process mediated by the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals in the epithelium.", 
    "24": "Protein metabolism in skeletal muscle tissue was studied in three groups of patients undergoing thyroid surgery: group I (n = 8), hyperthyroid patients preoperatively treated with an antithyroid drug and T4; group II (n = 8), hyperthyroid patients preoperatively treated with the beta 1-selective adrenoreceptor blocking agent metoprolol; group III (n = 5), euthyroid patients operated on for nodular goiter or adenoma. The study was prospective and hyperthyroid patients were randomly allocated to one of the two preoperative regimens. During operation a biopsy was taken from the sternohyoid muscle and rates of protein synthesis and degradation were measured in incubated muscle tissue. Clinical improvement was equal in the two groups of hyperthyroid patients during preoperative treatment but serum T3 concentrations remained elevated in patients treated with metoprolol. Thus, these patients were biochemically hyperthyroid at the time of operation. The rate of protein degradation was significantly higher in hyperthyroid patients treated with metoprolol than in patients of groups I and III. A significant positive correlation was found between serum T3 and rate of protein degradation in skeletal muscle. Protein synthesis rates were similar in the three groups of patients. This study demonstrated for the first time increased proteolysis in skeletal muscle tissue from patients with high serum T3 concentrations. The results indicate that changes of skeletal muscle protein metabolism in hyperthyroid patients are not normalized by beta 1-blockade despite the fact that this treatment effectively controlled symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism.", 
    "25": "The effect of prostacyclin (PGI2) infusion on plasma renin concentration (PRC) was examined before and after propranolol treatment in sheep. Increasing doses of prostacyclin (0.05, 0.1 or 0.3 micrograms/kg per min) produced dose dependent increases in PRC. There was a significantly lower PRC response after propranolol at 0.3 micrograms/kg per min only.", 
    "26": "The results of the treatment in hypertension with pregnancy by a alpha-beta blocker in 58 women show: the good tolerance of the drug and its lack of teratogenic effect, its quasi-constant efficiency (91%) in hypertension, its benefit repercussion on neonatal weight. However, this therapeutics requires a maternal careful watching all along pregnancy, and especially of the new-born children, with regard to the risk of hypoglycemia.", 
    "27": "The enhanced arrhythmogenic risk of combined treatment with cardiac glycosides and beta-sympathomimetics is referred in some textbooks, but only a few detailed studies on in vivo models are available. We therefore investigated this problem in conscious dogs in an intraindividual study. We determined the dose of acetylstrophanthidin (intravenous infusion of 5 mcg/kg per min), which provoked ventricular premature beats with and without concomitant treatment with the partial beta-agonistic compounds doxaminol (3 mg/kg p.o.), prenalterol (0.4 or 1.0 mg/kg p.o.) or isoprenaline (0.31 +/- 0.100 mcg/kg per min). In some dogs a coronary artery was narrowed in order to reduce the coronary blood supply. The arrhythmogenic dose of acetylstrophanthidin was nearly the same in all the groups investigated (range from 52.1 +/- 5.66 to 59.9 +/- 3.23 mcg/kg). Whereas the arrhythmogenic dose of acetylstrophanthidin was unchanged by beta-sympathomimetics, the combination of the glycoside and each of the beta-agonistic drugs increased the contractile force more than did either single compound. We therefore conclude that the arrhythmogenic risk of the combination of glycosides and beta-sympathomimetics may be--at least in experimental models--less than has been suggested in the past.", 
    "28": "The effects of some beta-adrenergic antagonists such as acebutolol, propranolol, pindolol and oxprenolol (1-1000 microM) were studied on the rat heart sarcolemmal Ca2+ transport activities. Pindolol enhanced sarcolemmal ATP-dependent Ca2+ binding and Ca2+-stimulated ATPase whereas acebutolol had no effect. Both propranolol and oxprenolol had biphasic actions on the sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump activities; the lower concentrations (1 and 10 microM) were stimulatory, but the higher concentrations (100 and 1000 microM) were inhibitory. None of the drugs used in this study had any effect on Mg2+ ATPase and non-specific Ca2+ binding activities of heart sarcolemma except that 1000 microM propranolol decreased Mg2+ ATPase activity significantly. Mitochondrial and microsomal ATP-dependent Ca2+ binding activities were unaffected by these drugs (1-1000 microM), except that 1000 microM propranolol was inhibitory. These results suggest differences among various beta-adrenergic blocking drugs with respect to their actions on sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump in the myocardium.", 
    "29": "Therapy for severe beta-blocker poisoning should be based upon careful supportive therapy. In most cases of poisoning, elimination techniques cannot be expected to remove significant amounts of the drug. Inotropic drugs such as isoproterenol, prenalterol and glucagon in adequate (i.e. large) doses may be necessary to counteract cardiac failure.", 
    "30": "Aqueous humour catecholamine concentrations were assayed in open angle glaucoma, and cataract patients during surgery, under general anaesthesia. Plasma catecholamines were measured at the same time. Aqueous humour noradrenaline is apparently reduced by pretreatment with adrenaline, timolol and pilocarpine. (Noradrenaline concentrations were 0.599 +/- 0.239 ng/ml in glaucoma, and 0.970 +/- 0.445 ng/ml in cataract patients.) Dopamine was found in two of six cataract patients (0.123 and 0.318 ng/ml), and in all the glaucoma group (0.221 +/- 0.170 ng/ml). Plasma noradrenaline concentration was probably increased in glaucoma, when compared to the cataract patients. These results confirm our findings in the non-human primate, and suggest that adrenaline may act, at least in part, by causing denervation or inhibition of noradrenaline release in the anterior segment of the eye, and probably by release of dopamine into the aqueous humour. The unexplained and new finding of dopamine in the aqueous humour may have some bearing on the action of dopaminergic drugs for the treatment of glaucoma. Future treatment of ocular hypertension may rely more on sympathetic denervation than on conventional adrenergic therapy.", 
    "31": "The number of drugs available for treatment of angina pectoris has increased dramatically in recent years; new beta and calcium channel blockers are to be introduced; nitrates are now available in transdermal pads and could become released as buccal tablets or aerosol sprays. A broad understanding of the pharmacological principles of their use is necessary to tailor therapy for each patient.", 
    "32": "Isoprenaline was given i.v. to rats and its ability to change the air pressure necessary to open the Eustachian tube (ET) was studied. Air was injected once a minute into the middle ear via a tube glued to a hole in the tympanic bulla. The rate of pressure increase was 0.7 kPa/sec. The air pressure at which the ET opened was in 10 rats 3.4 +/- 0.3 (SE) kPa. Isoprenaline in a dose of 1 microgram/kg decreased this pressure opening level (Pol) by 0.14 +/- 0.03 kPa and with 10 micrograms/kg by 0.22 +/- 0.03 kPa. These effects were reduced by propranolol. Isoprenaline did not act via released adrenaline. A surface tension lowering substance, Tween 20, instilled into the middle ear, decreased Pol by about 0.9 kPa. It is suggested that isoprenaline evokes a decreased Pol via secretion of surface tension lowering substances.", 
    "33": "Pharmacological properties of the facilitatory presynaptic beta-adrenoceptor mechanism were studied in superfused spiral preparations of guinea-pig pulmonary arteries preloaded with 3H-norepinephrine. (-)-Isoproterenol (0.3 microM)-induced increases in total 3H efflux per pulse evoked by transmural field stimulation (1, 5, 10 and 20 Hz, 10 V, 2 msec pulse width, 100 pulses and 30 min intervals) were neither dependent on impulse-frequencies nor selective at lower frequencies. Isoproterenol increased 3H efflux at 5 Hz in a concentration-dependent manner (1 nM to 1 microM): pD2 was 7.7. Salbutamol increased 3H efflux in a similar manner to isoproterenol: pD2 was 7.4. Prenalterol at 3 microM only slightly increased 3H efflux. Tazolol (10 nM to 3 microM) produced no increases. Atenolol (3 microM) and practolol (3 microM) did not antagonize isoproterenol (0.3 microM)-induced increases in 3H efflux. Butoxamine (3 microM) and H 35/25 (3 microM) did antagonize this parameter. (-)-Epinephrine (1 nM to 0.1 microM) decreased 3H efflux at 5 Hz and concentration-dependently increased this parameter in the presence of 10 microM phentolamine. (-)-Norepinephrine (10 nM to 1 microM) concentration-dependently inhibited evoked 3H efflux and did not increase the parameter in the presence of 10 microM phentolamine, 10 microM cocaine and 10 microM normetanephrine. Thus, there exist presynaptic beta 2-subtype receptors on noradrenergic nerve endings innervating guinea-pig pulmonary arteries.", 
    "34": "A cartridge serum and urine extraction procedure of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, nadolol, employing a cross-linked styrene-divinyl benzene macroreticular resin is described. Samples were analyzed as the silylated derivative by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using selected-ion monitoring. When nadolol was orally coadministered with its deuterated analogue, relative bioavailability could be demonstrated with six or fewer subjects. Employing a base-deactivated GC phase, the limit of detection is 1 ng and 0.5 ng/mL of serum for nadolol and the deuterated analogue, respectively. For levels of less than 10 ng/mL, the respective coefficients of variation are 4 and 2%. For concentrations of greater than 10 ng/mL, the CV is 1% for nadolol and nadolol-d9.", 
    "35": "Before the introduction of effective hypotensive drugs in the early 1950s, survival from untreated hypertension was closely related to blood pressure level. Cardiac failure, stroke, and uremia were the commonest causes of death. Reduction of blood pressure by antihypertensive drugs in malignant hypertension quickly showed that life could be prolonged and vascular damage arrested. The efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in nonmalignant hypertension has been demonstrated in several randomized controlled trials, but the benefit seems to decline the lower the initial blood pressure. Antihypertensive drug treatment has reduced the incidence of cardiac failure, stroke, and uremia, but it has not clearly been shown to reduce the frequency of myocardial infarctions. At present, the choice of an antihypertensive agent is based on its ability to lower pressure in relation to the possible adverse side effects that it produces. The reduction of blood pressure seems to be the basis for the therapeutic effect, rather than any other special property of the drug.", 
    "36": "It has been demonstrated in experiments on guinea-pigs that the beta-adrenoblocker propranolol (1-2 mg/kg) substantially raises bronchial sensitivity to histamine (10 mg/kg). The alpha-adrenoblocker tropaphen (2 mg/kg) potentiates the protective action of adrenaline (5 micrograms/kg) and euphylline (8 mg/kg) in bronchospasm induced by histamine (10 micrograms/kg).", 
    "37": "A 1-week treatment with the hepatocarcinogen beta-blocker DL-1-(2-nitro-3-methyl-phenoxy)-3-tert-butylamino-propan-2-ol (ZAMI 1305) induces the appearance of preneoplastic liver lesions--oval cell hyperplasia, basophilic and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase positive (GGT+) foci--in female Wistar rats, as evidenced by the Solt and Farber short-term test of carcinogenesis. ZAMI 1305-treatment also induces liver DNA damage, as evaluated by alkaline sucrose gradient analysis. The data suggest that the oncogenic B-blocker ZAMI 1305 has initiating activity in the liver of the female Wistar rat.", 
    "38": "Celiprolol has been previously shown in vivo to be an effective beta-adrenergic antagonist with cardio-selectivity and weak intrinsic sympathomimetic activity but no membrane stabilizing or \"quinidine-like\" effects. With in vitro systems reported here, the following was observed. Against the stimulation of adenylate cyclase from dog ventricular muscle by isoproterenol, celiprolol had a Ki of 2.6 X 10(-7) M which was about 1/20 the potency of propranolol. At 100 microM, celiprolol did not affect histamine or dopamine concentration-response curves for the stimulation of adenylate cyclase from guinea-pig cerebral cortex. By itself, up to 1 mM, celiprolol did not affect basal adenylate cyclase activity from either preparation. With in vitro radioligand binding assays to directly measure beta-adrenergic receptor interactions, celiprolol had Ki values of 1.4 X 10(-7) to 8.3 X 10(-6) M. A 35-fold beta selectivity was noted with membranes from rat heart vs. rat reticulocytes, which supports previously reported in vivo data on cardioselectivity. No difference in affinity to beta-receptors was noted with frog vs. turkey erythrocyte membranes which supports the contention that these two non-mammalian systems are not predictive of beta1/beta2 specificity with mammalian systems. Celiprolol also showed some selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonism against (3H)-yohimbine binding vs. (3H)-prazosin binding to membranes from rat cerebral cortex. With rat adipocytes, up to 300 microM celiprolol did not stimulate basal lipolysis in the presence or absence of 10 microM 1-methyl-3-isobutyl-xanthine. Celiprolol inhibited isoproterenol-induced lipolysis with a potency about 2 times greater than practolol. Unlike propranolol, celiprolol at very high concentrations did not show non-specific inhibition of lipolysis induced with cyclic nucleotides. These and other published data would suggest the following: in vitro beta adrenergic receptor antagonist activity can be demonstrated for celiprolol, cardioselectivity is due to a combination of many factors including stereochemistry of the molecule and in vivo distribution and metabolism, celiprolol does not possess \"non-specific\" membrane activity, the \"intrinsic-sympathomimetic activity\" of celiprolol is selectively observed in some but not all in vitro test models, celiprolol has about a 10-fold selectivity for alpha 2-vs. alpha 1-receptors which is relatively unique to beta-antagonists and needs further investigations as to the potential physiological significance.", 
    "39": "An attempt was made to evaluate the possible metabolic interaction with myogenic vascular reactivity during autoregulation of blood flow in sympathectomized cat skeletal muscle. This was done by studying the extent to which a purely myogenic response, elicited by a standardized 2 s vascular transmural pressure impulse stimulus was altered when mean arterial inflow pressure was varied in the range from 160 down to 40 mmHg. The observations were made during the steady state blood flows encountered at the different pressure levels. The data were corrected for the effects of physical factors inherent in altered basal vascular tone and intravascular pressure with the aid of a mathematical model for purely myogenic responses. The results demonstrated a flow dependent decline in myogenic vascular reactivity during reduction of arterial pressure, even in the range where blood flow was autoregulated quite effectively. This suggested a significant metabolic interaction with myogenic reactivity, an interpretation corroborated by a similar decline in myogenic reactivity found during more defined activation of the vascular metabolic control system by graded light muscle exercise. The fact that a significant metabolic interaction was revealed even at such minute flow changes that occur in the autoregulatory range indicates a high 'gain' in the metabolic feedback interacting, directly or indirectly, with myogenic mechanisms in local vascular regulation.", 
    "40": "Twelve healthy male volunteers were treated with 1200 mg/day cimetidine, 300 mg/day ranitidine, or no H2-receptor antagonist (control) for seven days in a sequence determined by Latin-square design. Each treatment period was separated by a seven-day washout. On the third day of each treatment period, 80 mg propranolol every 12 hours for nine doses was initiated. Whole blood concentrations of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol were measured at 12 time points during the 12-hour period following administration of the last propranolol dose. Heart rate was measured before each blood sample was withdrawn. Cimetidine treatment was associated with a 47 per cent increase in the area under the propranolol concentration-time curve and a 17 per cent increase in elimination half-life of propranolol. Ranitidine had no significant effect on the concentration-time profile of propranolol. There were no significant differences in the 4-hydroxypropranolol pharmacokinetic parameters during any of the treatments. There was, however, a significant decrease in the average 4-hydroxypropranolol-to-propranolol steady-state concentration ratio during the cimetidine treatment. There was no significant difference in heart rate between any of the treatments. The elevation of propranolol concentrations during cimetidine treatment is likely due to metabolic inhibition by cimetidine.", 
    "41": "The effects of three beta blockers on liver blood flow and hepatic enzyme activity were investigated. Eight healthy subjects received placebo, 100 mg metoprolol, 40 mg nadolol, and 60 mg propranolol orally three times a day for four days in a randomized block design. On the fourth day of each treatment, beta blockade was measured by inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia and apparent liver blood flow was measured by indocyanine green clearance. Plasma concentrations of the beta blockers were measured 2 hours after the early morning dose. Metoprolol produced the greatest inhibition of exercise tachycardia. All three drugs appeared to reduce liver blood flow, but this was only statistically significant in the case of propranolol. Enzyme inhibition occurred but to a varying extent. Propranolol produced a 36 per cent fall in antipyrine clearance (P less than 0.1) while metoprolol and nadolol both caused a 12 per cent reduction (P less than 0.05 and P = 0.06, respectively). Wide interindividual variation in the plasma concentrations of the drugs limit interpretation, but the results suggest that at the doses used, metoprolol and nadolol may be less likely to cause significant drug interaction by enzyme inhibition than propranolol.", 
    "42": "Recent advances in basic biomedical research have led to the development of clinically useful drugs known as \"second generation\" adrenergic receptor stimulants (agonists) and blockers (antagonists). Adrenergic receptors are now differentiated into 4 distinct subtypes: alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2. The new drugs are more receptor-selective and tissue-specific than older ones and, hence, have increased potential for directed therapeutic action, with relatively less side effects on nontargeted organs. The beta 2-selective agonist terbutaline, eg, causes bronchodilation with less beta 1-cardiac excitation than does the beta 1-beta 2 nonselective agonist isoproterenol. Compared with the latter, the beta 1-selective agonist dobutamine increases myocardial contractile force and cardiac output with less beta 2-mediated vasodilation and hypotension. The beta 1-selective antagonist metoprolol has advantage over the beta 1-beta 2 nonselective blocker propranolol for controlling beta 1-cardiac excitation in patients with compromised pulmonary function. Prazosin, an alpha 1-selective blocking agent, evokes peripheral vasodilation with less reflex tachycardia than does the nonselective alpha 1-alpha 2 blocker phentolamine, probably because the former spares the prejunctional alpha 2-receptors that subserve autoinhibition of norepinephrine release from the sympathetic neuron. The contemporary practice of internal medicine will no doubt include an understanding of the pharmacologic properties associated with the various adrenergic receptor subtypes.", 
    "43": "The purpose of this study was to develop a procedure for the isolation, purification, and structure identification of glucuronic acid conjugates of propranolol and alprenolol and their active metabolites, 4-hydroxypropranolol and 4-hydroxyalprenolol. As both aliphatic and aromatic glucuronides may be formed from 4-hydroxypropranolol and 4-hydroxyalprenolol, the structure identification of these conjugates has to be based on the intact conjugates. Using DEAE-Sephadex anion-exchange chromatography, milligram quantities of these glucuronides were isolated from urine of dogs pretreated with propranolol and alprenolol, respectively. A high degree of purification was achieved by reversed-phase HPLC. Structure identification of the methyl ester-trimethylsilyl derivatives was accomplished by electron impact GC/MS. Only one 4-hydroxypropranolol glucuronide was found, having the glucuronic acid linked to the aromatic hydroxyl group. For 4-hydroxyalprenolol glucuronide, however, two structures were identified, one with the glucuronic acid linked to the aromatic hydroxyl group, and the other with the glucuronic acid linked to the aliphatic hydroxyl group of the side chain. Using this analytical approach, 4-hydroxypropranolol glucuronide was identified in the urine of patients on propranolol therapy. In man, as in the dog, only the aromatic glucuronide was found, i.e. containing an unsubstituted beta-blocking side chain.", 
    "44": "Prior biochemical studies have shown that the ciliary process epithelium, which is involved in the secretion of aqueous humour, is rich in beta-adrenoceptors with pharmacological characteristics similar to those of the beta 2 subclass. The present experiments demonstrate that the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551, is a potent inhibitor of isoprenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity measured in broken cell preparations of rabbit ciliary process. In rabbit cardiac muscle, however, ICI 118,551 is a relatively weak antagonist of isoprenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase, being approximately 100 fold less potent than the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, timolol. ICI 118,551 is also less potent than timolol in inhibiting isoprenaline-sensitive adenylate cyclase of rabbit lung. ICI 118,551 applied topically to eyes of unanaesthetized rabbits causes a dose-dependent decrease in intraocular pressure. Furthermore, in a blind crossover study in rabbits, topically applied ICI 118,551 decreased intraocular pressure for more than 6 h and was more effective than an identical dose of the clinically effective anti-glaucoma agent, timolol. Systemic absorption from topically-applied timolol, but not ICI 118,551, is sufficient to alter cardiac response to subcutaneous administration of isoprenaline. Furthermore, dose-response studies, using direct systemic administration of the two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, revealed that ICI 118,551 is about 60 times less potent than timolol in blocking isoprenaline-induced cardio-acceleration. ICI 118,551, applied to one eye, causes a decrease in intraocular pressure in the contralateral eye, and systemic administration of ICI 118,551 results in decreased intraocular pressure in both eyes, data indicating that at least part of the ocular hypotensive effect of topical ICI 118,551 is mediated through systemic absorption. 8 These findings provide biochemical and physiological evidence that selective beta 2-adrenoceptor blockers such as ICI 118,551, used topically or systemically, may be useful as ocular hypotensive agents with decreased cardiac side-effects.", 
    "45": "The antihypertensive properties of ketanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, was investigated in combination with beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Ketanserin was given 40 mg twice daily to 10 hypertensive patients during 4 weeks in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Ketanserin significantly reduced supine and erect blood pressure compared to double-blind placebo, while no changes in heart rate were seen. When the blood pressure was assessed during 24 h at steady state conditions, the blood pressure reduction was maximal 1-2 h after tablet intake, corresponding to peak plasma concentrations of ketanserin. The blood pressure remained significantly reduced until next tablet intake (12 h). At steady state, on a 40 mg twice daily regimen, Css was 41.6 +/- 4.22, 36.9 +/- 5.19 and 39.8 +/- 4.81 ng/ml, Cmax 102.4 +/- 15.64 ng/ml and tmax 1.6 +/- 0.32 h. A slight sedation was observed in six patients. This side effect occurred 1-2 h after tablet intake and tended to subside with continued treatment.", 
    "46": "The heart rate, cardiac output, coronary sinus blood flow, systolic and end diastolic left ventricular pressures, femoral arterial pressure and coronary oxygen arterio-venous difference were measured in 12 patients with stable coronary artery disease without cardiac failure on long-term betablocker therapy, before and 45 minutes after 2 or 3 mg sublingual molsidomine. The measurements were repeated in 8 patients during a cold pressor test. Under basal conditions, molsidomine decreased the systolic and end diastolic left ventricular pressures, mean femoral arterial pressure, cardiac output and double product. The coronary oxygen arterio-venous difference was unchanged. Coronary sinus flow and myocardial oxygen consumption decreased. In the 2 patients who were given 3 mg molsidomine, a progressive reduction in systolic left ventricular pressure to 70% or less than its initial value, necessitated immediate treatment with volume expanders. During the cold pressor test before molsidomine the systolic and end diastolic left ventricular pressures, mean femoral arterial pressure and the double product increased. Coronary sinus flow was unchanged overall: it decreased in 6 patients, increased in 2 patients and remained the same in 1 patient. Coronary resistance increased in 6 patients and decreased in only one patient. During the cold pressor test after molsidomine there was a significant reduction in the increase of systolic left ventricular pressure, mean femoral artery pressure and double product. Coronary sinus blood flow increased in 5 patients and decreased in only one case. Coronary resistance decreased in half the cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Coronary angiography: proximal isolated left anterior descending artery stenosis (greater than 70%). Thirty five patients were treated medically and 52 underwent coronary bypass surgery on the LAD artery: the results were compared at 18 and 24 months. Six patients were lost to follow-up, 2 from the medical group; the other 33 patients comprised group A. Four surgical patients were lost to follow-up, the other 48 patients comprised group B. The two groups had comparable clinical and epidemiological features. They differed in the incidence of hypertension which was more common in group A (p less than 0.01), in the better quality of the distal LAD artery in group B (p less than 0.01), and in the coexistence of less than 50% stenosis on the right coronary and left circumflex arteries which was commoner in group A (p less than 0.05). The mean follow-up period was comparable in the two groups (group A: 20.5 +/- 4.6 months; group B: 19.8 +/- 5.5 months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "The pathophysiology and mechanisms of toxicity of anthracycline-induced skin damage are reviewed, and the various available therapeutic interventions are discussed. Skin ulcers caused by the vesicant antineoplastic agents doxorubicin hydrochloride and daunorubicin hydrochloride begin slowly, and the extent of the tissue damage produced is often underestimated. Within a week, untreated infiltrations of these agents can advance to serious indurations and ulcerations, causing extensive damage to underlying structures such as tendons and bones. Two theories have been proposed to explain the mechanism of action of anthrocycline-induced tissue damage; one holds that doxorubicin-DNA complexes form causing cell death, and the other holds that these agents are reduced to free radicals that can cause cell-membrane damage. Nonpharmacologic treatment of extravasation consists of stopping the infusion at the first sign of a problem and attempting to aspirate fluid and drug back through the same needle. The application of ice packs for the next 24-72 hours is recommended. A variety of pharmacologic approaches have been evaluated to ameliorate tissue damage. Corticosteroids, sodium bicarbonate, beta-adrenergic agents, and dimethyl sulfoxide have been used with some success. Patients who do not respond to initial conservative treatments should be referred to a plastic surgeon for skin grafting and reconstruction. The best treatment for anthracycline toxicity is prevention.", 
    "49": "We have studied the effect of the intravenous administration of the following drugs on ventricular refractoriness in 35 experiments in open chested beagle dogs: atenolol 0.2 mg X kg-1; nadolol 0.05 mg X kg-1; oxprenolol 0.2 mg X kg-1; pindolol 0.04 mg X kg-1; propranolol 0.2 mg X kg-1; sotalol 0.6 mg X kg-1 and timolol 0.1 mg X kg-1. The animals were anaesthetised with chloralose and urethane. Measurements were made of left ventricular epicardial monophasic action potentials (MAP) (n = 35) and the left ventricular paced evoked response (PER) (n = 25) at a fixed paced cycle length of between 220 and 310 ms. The animals were initially beta-blocked with iv pindolol or propranolol and the drug under study then administered iv 10 min later. The results were as follows: (control and post drug administration) MAP: nadolol 151 +/- 12 SD to 172 +/- 13 SD (p less than 0.001); oxprenolol 153 +/- 21 to 178 +/- 20 (p less than 0.001); sotalol 153 +/- 19 to 176 +/- 20 (p less than 0.001); atenolol 152 +/- 25 to 153 +/- 23 (NS); pindolol 149 +/- 11 to 152 +/- 10 (NS); propranolol 152 +/- 26 to 155 +/- 26 (NS); timolol 144 +/- 23 to 144 +/- 21 (NS).

    "50": "Since the publication in 1977 of joint recommendations by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, the Canadian Heart Foundation and the Ontario Council of Health on the detection and management of hypertension in Canada, several clinical trials on the efficacy of antihypertensive drug treatment in patients with mild hypertension have been undertaken. The Canadian Hypertension Society (CHS) felt that the results of these trials should be reviewed to determine whether existing recommendations on treatment should be changed. Three expert panels appointed by the CHS reviewed evidence on the clinical efficacy of antihypertensive therapy, the diagnosis of hypertension and the treatment of mild hypertension, and formulated recommendations on the care of mildly hypertensive patients in Canada. A consensus conference of biomedical scientists, practising physicians and government representatives reviewed and reached agreement on the panels' recommendations. The final recommendations of the conference are presented in this report.",

In the secondary group mean age and mean duration of symptoms as well as presence of positive ANA and positive Clq binding test were significantly higher than in the primary group. In both groups a beneficial effect of the medication on finger temperature 12 min after finger cooling and on clinical symptoms was established. Secondary Raynaud's syndrome reacted at least as well as primary syndrome.", 
    "52": "Using a newly developed system for culturing canine fundic mucosal cells, we examined regulation of the secretion of somatostatinlike immunoreactivity (SLI) by cholinergic and adrenergic transmitters. Enzyme-dispersed canine fundic mucosa cells were enriched in SLI content by counterflow elutriation and cultured on collagen for 42 h. Epinephrine alone, and in combination with gastrin, stimulated SLI secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. Propranolol did not alter the response to dibutyryl cAMP or gastrin but produced a parallel, rightward shift of the epinephrine dose-response curve with the dissociation constant (Ki) determined to be 14 nM by nonlinear curve fitting. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, enhanced SLI secretion in response to epinephrine, an effect reversed by the alpha 1-agonist methoxamine but not by the alpha 2-agonist clonidine. However, neither methoxamine nor clonidine alone inhibited the response to the beta-selective adrenergic agonist isoproterenol; thus, the existence of an adrenergic alpha 1-inhibitory receptor remained uncertain. Carbachol noncompetitively inhibited SLI secretion stimulated by gastrin, epinephrine, and dibutyryl cAMP. Atropine produced a parallel rightward shift of the carbachol dose-response curve (Ki = 0.4 nM). Pirenzepine also inhibited the effects of carbachol (Ki = 35 nM). Our studies suggest that SLI-containing cells in the canine fundic mucosa possess stimulatory beta-adrenergic receptors and inhibitory muscarinic receptors.", 
    "53": "Effect of ICI 118,587 (corwin, ICI), a new cardioselective beta-partial agonist, on left ventricular (LV) function was studied and compared with that of isoproterenol and propranolol in 10 conscious normal dogs, instrumented with a micromanometer and pairs of ultrasonic crystals for analysis of LV wall motion. Heart rate, LV dP/dt and mean circumferential shortening velocity were measured at rest and during 3 levels of treadmill exercise (Ex). Before drug administration (control), the heart rate, dP/dt, percent shortening and mean circumferential shortening velocity were enhanced linearly along with the graded Ex. The Ex response curve shifted upward during isoproterenol infusion and downward after the administration of propranolol. With ICI, hemodynamic and contractile indexes were enhanced at rest as with isoproterenol, while these indexes were depressed during maximal Ex as after propranolol. The Ex response curve after ICI crossed the control response curve at a moderate level of Ex. Thus ICI exerts positive inotropic and chronotropic effects at rest when basal sympathetic tone is low, whereas it exerts negative inotropic and chronotropic properties at maximal Ex when sympathetic tone is high. The inherent dual action of this drug is expected to open a new field of treatment for ischemic heart disease with or without heart failure.", 
    "54": "We have investigated in normal subjects the possible role of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) and blood ketone bodies (KB) in the regulation of human somatostatin secretion. Heparin injected during the intravenous infusion of a fat emulsion raised FFA levels acutely from 0.4 +/- 0.1 to near 3 mmol/L. Plasma somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) rose from a mean (+/- SEM) basal value of 9.2 +/- 1.0 ng Eq S14/L to 20.0 +/- 6.0 ng Eq S14/L (P less than 0.05). Plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI) level was unchanged and glucagon (IRG) concentration decreased from 156 +/- 20 to 107 +/- 2 ng/L (P less than 0.05). During this test, there was a rise not only in FFA but also in plasma triglycerides (TG) and in blood glycerol and KB levels. The infusion of a fat emulsion alone increased triglyceride and glycerol levels to a similar extent but induced also a mild rise of FFA (0.37 +/- 0.05 to 1.13 +/- 0.5 mmol/L, P less than 0.01), KB (78 +/- 12 to 360 +/- 45 mumol/L, P less than 0.01), and SLI (14.8 +/- 4.6 to 23.8 +/- 7.1 ng Eq S14/L, P less than 0.05). The induction by DL-Na-3-hydroxybutyrate infusion of a rise of KB was associated with a decrease of FFA (P less than 0.05) and SLI (P less than 0.05) without modification of IRI or IRG levels. Phentolamine infusion did not modify the SLI or glucagon response to acute elevations of FFA, whereas propranolol suppressed the increase of SLI without preventing the concomitant decrease of IRG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "Isolated rabbit adrenal glands were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37 degrees C and the catecholamine storage sites were labeled with [3H]epinephrine. Release of radioactivity was evoked by 2-min periods of perfusion with dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP, 100 microM). DMPP-induced efflux of radioactivity was decreased by desipramine (1 microM), cocaine (30 microM), phenoxybenzamine (1 and 10 microM), phentolamine (1, 3 and 10 microM) and propranolol (1 microM). The reduction in DMPP-induced efflux cannot be accounted for by interactions with alpha adrenoceptors, as prazosin (1 microM) and yohimbine (1 microM) were without effect. There also was no correlation between inhibition of DMPP-induced efflux and ability of the drugs to inhibit catecholamine uptake as phentolamine (1 microM) and propranolol (1 microM) did not affect the incorporation of [3H]epinephrine by the gland. In guinea-pig atria, in which the catecholamine storage sites had been labeled with [3H]norepinephrine, efflux of radioactivity was elicited by 1-min periods of contact with DMPP. DMPP-induced efflux of radioactivity from atria was decreased by desipramine (1 microM), cocaine (30 microM), phenoxybenzamine (1 and 10 microM), phentolamine (1 and 10 microM) and propranolol (1 microM) but not by prazosin (1 microM) or yohimbine (1 microM). The inhibition of DMPP-induced efflux in guinea-pig atria could not be correlated with alpha adrenoceptor antagonism or blockade of neuronal uptake. There were differences between the two preparations in the degree of inhibition of DMPP-induced release produced by the above drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "To determine the effects of bucindolol on isolated vascular smooth muscle, rings of canine coronary and femoral arteries and saphenous veins were suspended for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with physiological salt solution. Bucindolol (3 X 10(-10) to 1 X 10(-7) M) had a comparable inhibitory effect on relaxations induced by isoproterenol in coronary arteries (which contain postjunctional beta-1 adrenoceptors) and saphenous veins (which contain postjunctional beta-2 adrenoceptors). Bucindolol (1 X 10(-7) M) had no effect on relaxations induced by sodium nitroprusside during contractions evoked by prostaglandin F2 alpha in either saphenous veins or coronary arteries. Bucindolol also had weak (relative to its beta adrenoceptor effect) alpha adrenoceptor-antagonistic activity that was greater for postjunctional alpha-1 than alpha-2 adrenoceptors. In all tissues tested, bucindolol in concentrations greater than 1 X 10(-6) M caused relaxations of responses induced by various nonadrenergic agonists. Propranolol (5 X 10(-6) M) did not alter the direct inhibitory effect that bucindolol had on contractions of coronary arteries or saphenous veins evoked by prostaglandin F2 alpha; this inhibitory effect of bucindolol was independent of the endothelium. In superfused saphenous vein strips, previously incubated with [3H]norepinephrine, bucindolol (3 X 10(-7) to 1 X 10(-5) M) increased the basal efflux of [3H]norepinephrine and its [3H] metabolites. Bucindolol at 1 X 10(-7) M inhibited prejunctional beta adrenoceptors without affecting prejunctional alpha adrenoceptors. These experiments indicate that bucindolol in decreasing orders of activity 1) has nonselective beta adrenoceptor-antagonistic properties, 2) has a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor-inhibitory effect and 3) has a nonspecific direct relaxing action on vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "57": "The role of the sympathetic nervous system in the systemic hemodynamic and regional blood flow responses to hypoxia was studied in awake dogs by pre-exposing the animals to phentolamine alone (alpha block) or to phentolamine plus propranolol (alpha + beta block). Hypoxia was produced by switching from room air to either an 8% or 5% oxygen-nitrogen mixture. During 8% oxygen breathing, cardiac output, heart rate, left ventricular dP/dt, dP/dt/P, myocardial oxygen consumption, and myocardial blood flow increased, and both total peripheral and coronary vascular resistance fell. These changes were similar in all groups with and without adrenergic blockade. However, during 5% oxygen breathing, the rises in cardiac output, heart rate, left ventricular dP/dt, myocardial oxygen consumption, and myocardial blood flow and the decrease in coronary vascular resistance were less marked in the group given alpha + beta block than the intact animals or group given alpha block. Coronary blood flow correlated with myocardial metabolic demands. Adrenal and skeletal muscle blood flows increased during hypoxia. Breathing 5% oxygen also increased flow to the brain, but renal and splanchnic flows showed only minor changes. These changes in organ vascular resistance were unaffected by the adrenergic blockade. Our results indicate that although the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the systemic hemodynamic responses to hypoxia, the dominant local metabolic factors probably are primarily responsible for hypoxic vasodilation in the awake dog.", 
    "58": "VT may be observed to accompany a wide variety of heart diseases and occasionally no heart disease at all. The efficacy of drug therapy is dependent on antiarrhythmic effects and the mechanism underlying the patient's VT. Conventional antiarrhythmic agents appear to be effective in no more than one third of patients, but a substantial number of other potentially useful antiarrhythmic agents exist. Unfortunately, their effectiveness in treating sustained VT for the most part must still be proved. Other agents such as amiodarone appear effective, but ways to predict which patients will benefit remain unknown. Invasive and noninvasive techniques exist for assessing therapeutic efficacy, but determination of which is more appropriate awaits a wider experience and more direct comparison.", 
    "59": "We confirmed previous studies by others that intravenous somatostatin infusions (1.4 and 2.5 micrograms/kg X h) induced jejunal activity fronts in fed dogs. This finding, coupled with earlier demonstrations that somatostatin is released from the stomach and pancreas in vitro by isoproterenol, led us to investigate the possible role of somatostatin in mediating isoproterenol-induced activity fronts. Plasma somatostatin and motilin concentrations were determined after a meat-base meal, before and after isoproterenol infusions (0.5 micrograms/kg X min). Jejunal activity fronts were initiated in 15 of 17 experiments an average of 25 min after the start of the isoproterenol infusion. The concentration of motilin did not change, but somatostatin concentrations increased progressively beginning 15 min after starting the isoproterenol infusion. Thus, isoproterenol released somatostatin in vivo and this release was associated with jejunal activity fronts. The rise in plasma somatostatin concentration was similar to that obtained after somatostatin infusions, although in the latter experiments the activity fronts began soon after initiation of the somatostatin infusion. The results suggest that isoproterenol-induced activity fronts are mediated by somatostatin. We speculate that beta-adrenergic nerves may induce activity fronts through somatostatin release, possibly in situations such as extreme stress.", 
    "60": "The clinical and biochemical response over a 3 month trial period of 21 hypertensive diabetics who were given metoprolol, 200 mg twice daily, have been compared to an age, sex, blood pressure, known duration of diabetes and diabetic treatment matched group who were treated with a high cereal fibre, low sodium and low fat diet. Both treatment groups had a significant reduction of systolic (p less than 0.001 on the diet; p less than 0.02 on metoprolol) and diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.001 respectively). On metoprolol the heart rate significantly decreased throughout the study (p less than 0.001). Only the modified diet was accompanied with a reduction of mean glycosylated haemoglobin (p less than 0.01) and weight (p less than 0.001). By the end of the study mean serum triglyceride level was lower in the diet treated group (p less than 0.05) compared to the metoprolol group. In hyperlipidaemic patients only dietary therapy significantly decreased mean serum triglyceride (p less than 0.02) and glycosylated haemoglobin (p less than 0.001). We conclude that although both treatments had a similar hypotensive response only the modified diet beneficially influenced other cardiovascular risk factors. These data suggest that this diet might be considered an alternative to metoprolol in hypertensive diabetic patients.", 
    "61": "Long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice were pretreated with either propranolol or phentolamine, followed by a hypnotic dose of ethanol. Pretreatment with propranolol, but not phentolamine, significantly reduced ethanol sleep time in LS mice. The SS mice were not affected. In a second study propranolol pretreatment was given subsequent to ethanol at various doses, different for each line, that produced similar sleep time durations in both lines. Under these conditions, propranolol decreased sleep time in both LS and SS mice. These data lend support to the idea that noradrenergic mechanisms play a role in the mediation of the hypnotic effects of ethanol.", 
    "62": "OPC-8212 is a new positive inotropic drug which scarcely produces an increase in heart rate and vasodilatation. The positive inotropic effect of OPC-8212 was investigated in relation to cyclic AMP metabolism in canine isolated ventricular muscle. The positive inotropic effect of OPC-8212 was accompanied by accumulation of cyclic AMP in the tissue: the cyclic AMP level was elevated before the increase in force of contraction and elevated in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol (10(-6) M). The OPC-8212-induced increases in force of contraction and cyclic AMP level were abolished by carbachol (3 X 10(-6) M). The relationship between the force of contraction and cyclic AMP level in the presence of OPC-8212 was changed by neither carbachol nor isoproterenol. OPC-8212 enhanced the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol as cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors did. OPC-8212 shortened the time to peak tension and had a tendency to shorten the relaxation time of single contractions. These results altogether suggest that change in cyclic AMP metabolism is involved at least in the positive inotropic effect of OPC-8212 on canine ventricular muscle.", 
    "63": "In the canine femoral bed, we studied the involvement of vascular alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in vasoconstriction by stimulating the sympathetic nerve during different degrees of activation of metabolic counterregulation (constant pressure and constant flow perfusion). In chloralose-anesthetized, despinalized dogs under beta-blockade (2 mg/kg nadolol) and under a constant femoral perfusion pressure, cumulative doses of rauwolscine (0.03, 0.3, and 3.0 mg/kg i.v., n = 8) or of prazosin (0.012, 0.12, and 1.2 mg/kg i.v., n = 8) caused dose-dependent shifts to the right of the dose-response curve of intraarterial norepinephrine (NE) infusions. These cumulative doses also caused attenuations of the vasoconstriction initiated by lumbar sympathetic stimulation (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 Hz). Sham treatment (n = 8) had no such results. In experiments with constant flow perfusion (n = 6 for each antagonist), rauwolscine shifted the NE dose-response curve significantly more compared to the experiments with constant pressure perfusion, while prazosin was similarly effective under both conditions. Under constant flow perfusion, both antagonists dose-dependently attenuated the vasoconstrictions caused by sympathetic stimulation. While prazosin and sham treatment did not modify the overflow of NE from the femoral bed during stimulation, this overflow was augmented by rauwolscine during stimulation at 3 Hz, which indicated presynaptic modulation of NE release. Under both experimental conditions, no significant difference could be observed in the attenuation of low-frequency sympathetic vasoconstriction by the two antagonists, when dosages were compared on the basis of their action against infused NE. It is concluded that both a rauwolscine-sensitive component and a prazosin-sensitive component are involved in the competition between sympathetic vasoconstriction and metabolic dilation. The vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors activated by these two components have a similar postsynaptic localization relative to the nerve endings.", 
    "64": "In intact human lymphocytes the properties of (+/-)- and (-)-125iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors were investigated. Binding of both ligands was in concentrations ranging from 10-200 pM saturable resulting in identical Bmax-values (about 550-650 specific ICYP binding sites/cell); the KD-value of (-)-ICYP (14.8 +/- 0.1 pM, N = 3), however, was about two times lower than that of (+/-)-ICYP (26.5 +/- 2.5 pM, N = 3). Irrespective of the ligand used alprenolol, betaxolol, ICI 118,551 and isoprenaline inhibited binding with identical KI-values. Binding was stereospecific, since the (+)-isomers of alprenolol and isoprenaline were about 50 times less potent in inhibiting binding than their respective (-)-isomers. In concentrations greater than 250 pM both ligands labeled a second class of binding sites in a non-saturable manner. These low affinity sites showed no stereospecificity; they may be related to unspecific uptake of the ligands into the cell. In kinetic experiments biphasic dissociation reactions were obtained for (+/-)- as well as (-)-ICYP; for both ligands the ratio fast/slow dissociating component was 40/60. It is concluded, that at low receptor concentrations (2.5-5 pmoles/l in the present study) the contribution of the (+)-isomer of ICYP to binding of the racemic ligand can be neglected. Thus, at low receptor concentrations both (+/-) and (-)-ICYP exhibit identical binding properties to beta 2-adrenoceptors in intact human lymphocytes.", 
    "65": "To localize fetal rabbit lung beta-adrenoreceptors before and after glucocorticoid treatment, light microscopic autoradiography was performed with the reversible radiolabeled beta-adrenergic antagonist, [3H]dihydroalprenolol, on day 26 of gestation. Autoradiograms of adult lung and fetal myocardium were also prepared. Examination of these autoradiograms showed densely labeled airways, alveoli, and myocardium. Specific labeling, defined as that prevented by incubation with l-propranolol (1 microM), was 90%. Analysis of grain counts in the fetus showed that airways were more densely labeled than alveoli (p less than 0.001), labeling was increased by treatment (p less than 0.001) and treatment increased alveolar (p less than 0.002) but not airway labeling. Adult lungs were much more densely labeled than fetal, and fetal myocardial labeling was not altered by treatment. Adult untreated lung showed the same pattern as fetal untreated lung with airways being more densely labeled than alveoli (p less than 0.001). To validate estimates of relative beta-adrenoreceptor concentration derived from autoradiograms, comparisons to determinations of beta-receptor concentration from scintillation counting of lung section digests and from previously performed radioligand binding studies, using membranes prepared from whole lung homogenates, were made. There is excellent agreement between estimates of relative receptor concentration and specific binding derived from the counting of autographic grains and both scintillation counting of lung section digests and previously performed radioligand binding of lung particulate. In all preparations, specific binding was (90%), increased with glucocorticoid treatment in fetal lung (50-100%), was greater in concentration in adult compared to fetal lung (7-10-fold), and did not increase in fetal myocardium with treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "When C6-rat glioma cells were incubated for 20 min with beta-adrenoceptor agonists, a part of the beta-adrenoceptors was localized in light density vesicles. These receptors have the same affinity for dihydroalprenolol as plasma membrane receptors but have a lowered affinity for agonists as well as for the hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP-12177. The affinity of these vesicular receptors for a variety of hydrophobic beta-blockers as well as for the hydrophilic beta-blocker timolol is compared with that of plasma membrane receptors. None of the ligands investigated showed any difference in affinity but CGP-12177. Both, introducing a lipophilic side chain into CGP-12177 or altering the benzimidazol-2-one ring system of CGP-12177 led to an increase in the affinity of the vesicular receptors. Since in the presence of the pore-forming agent alamethicin the same affinity was determined for vesicular receptors as for those located on the plasma membrane, it is concluded that the apparent low affinity of the vesicular receptors in the absence of alamethicin is caused by a membrane barrier. The lower affinity of the vesicular receptors for agonists was only slightly increased by alamethicin.", 
    "67": "These experiments were designed to determine if renal venous norepinephrine (NE) overflow provides a valid index of renal sympathetic nerve activity. In addition, we evaluated the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on renal NE overflow during graded renal nerve stimulation in order to examine the possibility that presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors facilitate neuronal release of NE in the kidney. In 6 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs, the renal nerves were transected to remove tonic nerve activity and the distal ends were electrically stimulated (8-25 V, 0.5 ms) over the range of 0.3-5.0 Hz for consecutive 4-min periods. NE overflow rate was calculated as the product of the veno-arterial NE concentration difference and renal plasma flow. Control values of NE overflow (-8.7 +/- 1.8 ng/min) demonstrated net clearance of NE from the renal circulation. NE overflow rate rose to -3.1 +/- 2.2, 1.0 +/- 4.0, and 33.2 +/- 15.4 ng/min at 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 Hz stimulation, respectively, with no accompanying change in renal blood flow. At 2.4 and 5.0 Hz, renal blood flow decreased by 21 +/- 4% and 37 +/- 3%, but there was no further increase in NE overflow rate (38.8 +/- 9.4 and 27.8 +/- 6.5 ng/min). Propranolol (0.5-1.0 mg . kg-1 plus 0.4-0.5 mg . kg-1 i.v., n = 4) did not alter the effect of nerve stimulation on either NE overflow or renal blood flow. Thus we were unable to demonstrate the presence of functional renal presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors. Further, our data indicate that renal norepinephrine overflow rate is not always a reliable index of renal nerve activity, since NE overflow was not proportional to renal nerve stimulation rate at frequencies high enough to cause vasoconstriction.", 
    "68": "Experiments with local perfusion of the rat neostriatum and subsequent chromatography of the perfusate have shown that addition of beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA) to the perfusion medium in a concentration of 10(-3) M enhanced spontaneous and inhibited the K+-induced release of 3H-dopamine preliminarily applied to the neostriatum. The stimulating effect of beta-PEA was Ca2+-dependent and was potentiated in sodium-free media. The inhibitory effect of beta-PEA on the K+-induced release of 3H-DA was abolished by haloperidol, a blocker of dopamine receptors. This fact allows one to suggest that this effect of beta-PEA is mediated by presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors. The data obtained indicate that beta-PEA can modulate the dopaminergic synaptic transmission depending on functional activity of dopaminergic neurons.", 
    "69": "A study was made of the function of beta-adrenoreceptors and Chinese hamster fibroblast cAMP during their desensitization to isoproterenol. Desensitization of adenylate cyclase was demonstrated to lead to the reduction of both the cAMP response to isoproterenol and isoproterenol capacity to protect the cells from ionizing radiation. This did not entail any changes in the number of beta-adrenoreceptors or in the dissociation constant of the beta-antagonist. It is assumed that desensitization provokes functional dissociation of the beta-receptor and adenylate cyclase. Intact adenylate cyclase is an absolute must for realization of the antiradiation potency of isoproterenol.", 
    "70": "The basic mechanism underlying the abnormal systemic vascular resistance in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is poorly understood. To categorize the beta-receptor system in the lungs of these animals, we evaluated receptor number and affinity as an index of this subclass of beta receptors. The lung was chosen because it is not directly affected by the alteration in blood pressure and provides a ready supply of beta-receptors. The aortic blood pressure and heart rate were measured directly through cannulation of the carotid artery. Twenty-four hours later, lung membranes from the SHR and control animals were extracted and partially purified. The affinity and number of receptors were measured by saturation analysis employing 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA). Scatchard analysis demonstrated that the number of receptors was identical and of a single class in both sets of animals. However, the beta-receptor from the SHR had a higher affinity than that of normal rats. It is not clear whether this represents an adaptive mechanism following the development of hypertension in the SHR or it represents a basic alteration in this strain of rat. Further studies aimed at categorizing the development of this defect during ontogeny as well as its physiologic consequences should prove valuable in understanding the mechanism of spontaneous hypertension.", 
    "71": "The adventitia of the rat aortic arch, with the depressor nerve intact, was separated from the underlying media to obtain a preparation in which the direct effects of norepinephrine on baroreceptor discharge could be examined free of smooth muscle effects. Cyclic stretch was applied to the adventitia to evoke discharge in single aortic baroreceptor fibers. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine in concentrations of 10(-7) to 10(-5) M increased baroreceptor discharge. No effect on discharge was seen with isoproterenol. Phentolamine but not propranolol blocked the increase in discharge produced by norepinephrine. An alpha-adrenergic modulation of baroreceptor discharge that is not dependent on smooth muscle tension has been demonstrated.", 
    "72": "To establish a model of airway smooth muscle function we studied binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]DHA), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, to membrane preparations of porcine trachealis muscle and investigated the response of adenylate cyclase to l-isoproterenol in tissue and plasma membranes. [3H]DHA binding was of high affinity (Kd = 1.0 +/- 0.1 nM), was saturable (Bmax = 87.6 +/- 13.2 fmol/mg protein), and was 90% beta 2 and 10% beta 1. Adenylate cyclase activity in the membrane preparation was (in pmol.10 min-1.mg protein-1 +/- SE): basal 420 +/- 74, guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) (10 micron) 600 +/- 45, GTP (10 microM) + l-isoproterenol (100 microM) 660 +/- 63, NaF (10 mM) 1,500 +/- 134, and forskolin (100 microM) 3,000 +/- 410. Guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) and GTP were active cofactors; l-isoproterenol appeared to function as an effector exchanging GTP for GDP on the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. There was close agreement of the effective dose (ED50) of the l-isoproterenol-induced relaxation (0.95 +/- 0.45 microM) and the inhibitory constant of l-isoproterenol binding (0.39 +/- 0.10 microM). l-Isoproterenol (100 microM) induced a 100% increase in adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels in tissue strips over basal activity. Investigation of the difference in adenylate cyclase activity between tissue and plasma membranes revealed that l-isoproterenol responsive adenylate cyclase was diminished after initial homogenization. Electron microscopy demonstrated disruption of all cells at this early stage of preparation. The decrease in l-isoproterenol responsive adenylate cyclase following cell rupture is different from other tissues and suggests a difference in the actions of beta-agonist in smooth muscle compared with other tissues.", 
    "73": "Exposure of postconfluent 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells to 1.0 microM isoproterenol for 12-24 hr results in a 90% loss of beta-adrenergic receptors. Upon removal of agonist, recovery of beta-receptors to control levels occurs within 72 hr. The recovery of receptors is completely blocked by cycloheximide [R. C. Doss, J. P. Perkins, and T. K. Harden, J. Biol. Chem. 256:12281-12286 (1981)]. In contrast cycloheximide does not block recovery of beta-receptors after down-regulation in preconfluent cultures. To determine unambiguously if beta-receptor synthesis accounts for the recovery of receptors after down-regulation, post confluent cultures were incubated with isoproterenol and then transferred to agonist-free medium containing either normal or \"heavy\" (2H, 13C, 15N) amino acids. The rate and extent of beta-receptor recovery were similar in both normal and heavy amino acid-containing medium. When beta-receptors that had recovered in the heavy amino acid-containing medium were labeled with 125I-cyanopindolol, solubilized in Lubrol PX, and subjected to centrifugation on a 5-15% sucrose density gradient, they exhibited an increased mass compared to beta-receptors that recovered in the presence of normal amino acids. These results confirm that the density shift method is a useful approach for the study of beta-receptor synthesis and that new receptor synthesis occurs during recovery of beta-receptors from catecholamine-induced down-regulation in postconfluent cultures.", 
    "74": "The effect of noradrenaline on the hypogastric ganglion of the guinea pig was studied to establish the role of catecholamine-containing sites in the sympathetic ganglia with the hypogastric nerve-vas deferens preparation. In these experiments the ganglion was separated pharmacologically from the muscle by a partition. An application of noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoproterenol each to the ganglion inhibited a twitch response of the vas deferens to preganglionic nerve stimulation at low frequencies. The drug effect decreased with increasing frequencies of stimulation. The inhibitory action of these drugs was antagonized by phentolamine, but not by propranolol. Clonidine also reduced the response to the nerve stimulation in a similar manner as did catecholamines, and the inhibitory action was antagonized by phentolamine. In contrast, phenylephrine had no significant action. The inhibitory effect of noradrenaline and clonidine was antagonized by the alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine, but not by such alpha-1 antagonists as prazosin and E-643. Noradrenaline did not affect the ganglion-stimulating action of acetylcholine. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of noradrenaline may be mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptors on presynaptic cholinergic nerve endings of the guinea-pig hypogastric ganglion. These data are discussed in relation to the presence of noradrenaline-containing sites in this ganglion."
