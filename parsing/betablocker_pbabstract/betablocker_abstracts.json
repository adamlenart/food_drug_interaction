    "5": "Correct identification of a chemical substance in environmental samples based only on accurate mass measurements can be difficult especially for molecules > 300 Da. Here is presented the application of spectral accuracy, a tool for the comparison of isotope patterns toward molecular formula generation, as a complementary technique to assist in the identification process of emerging organic contaminants and their transformation products in surface water. A set of nine emerging contaminants (five antibiotics, an herbicide, a beta-blocker, an antidepressant and an antineoplastic) frequently found in surface water were spiked in methanol and surface water extracts at two different concentrations (80 and 300 \u03bcg L(-1)). They were then injected into three different mass analyzers (triple quadrupole, quadrupole-time-of-fight and quadrupole-orbitrap) to study the impact of matrix composition, analyte concentration and mass resolution on the correct identification of molecular formulas using spectral accuracy. High spectral accuracy and ranking of the correct molecular formula were in many cases compound-specific due principally to conditions affecting signal intensity such as matrix effects and concentration. However, in general, results showed that higher concentrations and higher resolutions favoured ranking the correct formula in the top 10. Using spectral accuracy and mass accuracy it was possible to reduce the number of possible molecular formulas for emerging organic contaminants of relative high molecular mass (e.g. between 400 and 900 Da) to less than 10 and in some cases, it was possible to unambiguously assign one specific molecular formula to confirm an isotopic pattern. This study confirmed that spectral accuracy can be used as a complementary diagnostic technique to improve confidence levels for the identification of organic contaminants under environmental conditions.", 
    "6": "Purpose: Propranolol is the most widely used treatment for cardiovascular diseases. Dosage range in our patients is usually less than the amount mentioned in references. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether pharmacokinetic differences are able to justify the need for the fewer doses in our patients or not. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers (10 male) at heart center of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences were studied. Samples of blood were collected before a single oral dose (40 mg) of Propranolol. Blood samples were taken up to 9 hours after dose. Total plasma concentration of Propranolol was measured by HPLC. Population Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using population pharmacokinetics modeling software P-Pharm. Results: The mean value for oral plasma clearance (CL/F) was 126.59 ml/hr. The corresponding values for apparent volume of distribution (V/F), t1/2 beta, maximum blood concentration (C max), and time to reach the maximum blood concentration (T max) were 334.12 Lit, 1.98 hr, 40.25 ng/ml, and 1.68 hr, respectively. The observed mean values of V/F of propranolol in the present study were comparable with those reported in the literature. However, the mean values of CL/F of propranolol in current study was significantly higher than those reported in other population (P-value<0.001). Conclusion: This study has confirmed that the pharmacokinetic differences are not able to justify over-responsiveness of Iranian population to propranolol. Pharmacodynamic differences in responding to beta blocker drugs by Renin secretion or having a different sensibility to beta receptors might play a role in making our population have a different response to propranolol.", 
    "7": "Severe ventricular arrhythmias are frequent during heart failure; they are a life-threatening condition due to the increased risk of sudden death. Efficient management remains limited in sub-Saharan Africa because of the limited or unavailable medical resources as automated implantable defibrillator (AID). We report the case of a 56-year old patient with non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with very low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)who underwent AID implantation for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias in 2012. Maintenance therapy combined diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and anti-vitamin K. In the month of November 2014 the patient had iterative episodes requiring the delivery of electric shocks by the AID, without the sensation of palpitations suggestive of episodes of arrhythmias. Clinical examination is a poor screening test, especially for heart failure. AID detected multiple episodes of tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation justifying antitachycardia pacing (ATP) therapy or the delivery of electric shocks of 15J. The patient was treated with amiodarone and beta blocker. Evolution was favorable at 3-months follow-up. The patients had resumed normal activities, without experiencing new episodes requiring the delivery of electric shocks. This study emphasizes the essential role of anti-arrhythmic drug therapy for severe ventricular arrhythmias, even in the presence of AID.",

We sought to compare the effects of lipophilic and hydrophilic \u03b2-blockers on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes by conducting a comprehensive systematic review and network meta-analysis. MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database were searched for all dates to January 5, 2015, for randomized trials with comparisons between all \u03b2-blockers or between \u03b2-blockers and other antihypertensive agents.

Characteristics of each study and associated clinical outcomes were extracted, including all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Thirteen trials with 90,935 participants were included, focusing on lipophilic \u03b2-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol, and oxprenolol) and a hydrophilic \u03b2-blocker (atenolol). In this review, lipophilic \u03b2-blockers showed a significant reduction for the risk of cardiovascular mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI; 0.54-0.97]) compared with hydrophilic \u03b2-blocker, and lipophilic \u03b2-blockers showed decreased trend for the risk of all-cause mortality (OR 0.86, 95% CI [0.72-1.03]) and coronary heart disease (OR 0.88, 95% CI [0.64-1.23]).

    "9": "Dendrimers are synthetic macromolecules with a highly-branched structure and high concentration of surface groups. Among dendrimers, Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) has received substantial attention as a novel drug carrier and delivery system. Depending on the generation and type of terminal groups, dendrimer toxicity could change and include cytotoxicity. Although PAMAM is water soluble, molecular modeling of the dendrimer-drug complex is considered challenging for exploring the conformational mobility of dendrimers and atomic specific interactions during the dendrimer-drug association. However, conventional protocols for predicting binding affinities have been designed for small protein molecules or protein-protein complexes that can be applied to study the dendrimer-drug association. In this work, we performed docking calculations for a set of 94 previously reported compounds on PAMAM of fourth generation (G4-PAMAM) to select six compounds, cromoglicic acid (CRO) - a mast cell stabilizer, Fusidic acid (FUS) - a bacteriostatic antibiotic, and Methotrexate (MTX) - a chemotherapy agent and immune system suppressant, which have the highest affinities for G4-PAMAM, and Lidocaine (LDC) - used to numb tissue in a specific area and for ventricular tachycardia treatment, Metoprolol (MET) - a \u03b21 receptor blocker, and Pindolol (PIN) - a \u03b2 blocker, which have the lowest affinities for the G4-PAMAM dendrimer, to perform MD simulations combined with the molecular mechanics generalized/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area MMGBSA/MMPBSA approach to investigate the interactions of generating 4 charge-neutral, charge-basic and charge-acid G4-PAMAM dendrimers. In addition, to validate these theoretical G4-PAMAM-drug complexes, the complexes were experimentally conjugated to determine their stability in aqueous solubility studies immediately and over one year. Our results show that among the different commercial drugs, both charged and neutral PAMAM have the most favorable binding free energies for CRO, MTX, and FUS, which appears to be due to a complex counterbalance of electrostatics and van der Waals interactions. These theoretical and aqueous solubility studies supported the high affinity of methotrexate for the G4-PAMAM-drug due to its carboxyl and aryl moieties that favor its accommodation by noncovalent interactions.", 
    "10": "Indoxacarb belongs to a class of insecticides known as oxadiazines and is the first commercialized pyrazoline-type voltage-dependent sodium channel blocker. A moderate level of resistance to indoxacarb has evolved in field populations of Plutella xylostella from Central China. In the present study, cross-resistance, resistance stability and metabolic mechanisms of indoxacarb resistance were investigated in this moth species. A P. xylostella strain with a high level of resistance to indoxacarb was obtained through continuous selection in the laboratory. The strain showed cross-resistance to metaflumizone, beta-cypermethrin and chlorfenapyr, but no resistance to cyantraniliprole, chlorantraniliprole, abamectin, chlorfluazuron, spinosad and diafenthiuron compared with the susceptible strain. Synergism tests revealed that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) (synergistic ratio, SR=7.8) and diethyl maleate (DEF) (SR=3.5) had considerable synergistic effects on indoxacarb toxicity in the resistant strain (F58). Enzyme activity data showed there was an approximate 5.8-fold different in glutathione S-transferase (GST) and a 6.8-fold different in cytochrome P450 monooxygenase between the resistant strain (F58) and susceptible strain, suggesting that the increased activity of these two enzymes is likely the main detoxification mechanism responsible for the species' resistance to indoxacarb. These results will be helpful for insecticide resistance management strategies to delay the development of indoxacarb resistance in fields.", 
    "11": "Gut microbiota can regulate the host energy metabolism; however, the underlying mechanisms that could involve gut microbiota-derived compounds remain to be understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of KetoA [10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid]-a linoleic acid metabolite produced by gut lactic acid bacteria-on whole-body energy metabolism and found that dietary intake of KetoA could enhance energy expenditure in mice, thereby protecting mice from diet-induced obesity. By using Ca(2+) imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp methods, KetoA was noted to potently activate transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and enhance noradrenalin turnover in adipose tissues. In addition, KetoA up-regulated genes that are related to brown adipocyte functions, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in white adipose tissue (WAT), which was later diminished in the presence of a \u03b2-adrenoreceptor blocker. By using obese and diabetic model KK-Ay mice, we further show that KetoA intake ameliorated obesity-associated metabolic disorders. In the absence of any observed KetoA-induced antiobesity effect or UCP1 up-regulation in TRPV1-deficient mice, we prove that the antiobesity effect of KetoA was caused by TRPV1 activation-mediated browning in WAT. KetoA produced in the gut could therefore be involved in the regulation of host energy metabolism.-Kim, M., Furuzono, T., Yamakuni, K., Li, Y., Kim, Y.-I., Takahashi, H., Ohue-Kitano, R., Jheng, H.-F., Takahashi, N., Kano, Y., Yu, R., Kishino, S., Ogawa, J., Uchida, K., Yamazaki, J., Tominaga, M., Kawada, T., Goto, T. 10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid, a linoleic acid metabolite produced by gut lactic acid bacteria, enhances energy metabolism by activation of TRPV1.", 
    "12": "Telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), attenuates hyperglycemia-aggravated vascular inflammation by decreasing I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 (IKK\u03b2) expression in endothelial cells. Because glycogen synthase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) is involved in inflammatory process by regulating nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activity, we investigated whether GSK3\u03b2 mediates telmisartan-ameliorated vascular inflammation in hyperglycemia-treated endothelial cells and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Telmisartan remarkably induced GSK3\u03b2-Ser(9) phosphorylation in hyperglycemia-treated endothelial cells that accompanied a decrease in hyperglycemia-induced NF-\u03baB p65-Ser(536) phosphorylation, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression, and THP-1 monocyte adhesion. Ectopic expression of GSK3\u03b2-S9A, a constitutively active mutant of GSK3\u03b2, significantly restored complete telmisartan-inhibited NF-\u03baB p65-Ser(536) phosphorylation, VCAM-1 expression, and THP-1 monocyte adhesion. In addition, it reversed telmisartan-repressed IKK\u03b2 expression. Among the ARB, including losartan and fimasartan, only telmisartan increased GSK3\u03b2-Ser(9) phosphorylation, and telmisartan-induced GSK3\u03b2-Ser(9) phosphorylation remained unchanged by pretreatment with GW9662, a specific and irreversible peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) antagonist. Finally, in the aortas of HFD-fed mice, telmisartan treatment significantly attenuated HFD-induced upregulation of NF-\u03baB p65-Ser(536) phosphorylation, VCAM-1 expression, and IKK\u03b2 expression and downregulation of GSK3\u03b2-Ser(9) phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that telmisartan ameliorates hyperglycemia-exacerbated vascular inflammation, at least in part, by inducing GSK3\u03b2-Ser(9) phosphorylation, which consequently inhibits IKK\u03b2 expression, NF-\u03baB p65-Ser(536) phosphorylation, and VCAM-1 expression in a PPAR\u03b3-independent manner.",

We examined the risk of hip and pelvic fractures during the in-trial period (n\u00a0=\u00a022,180 participants; mean 4.9-year follow-up) and during the post-trial period using national data bases (n\u00a0=\u00a016,622 participants) (mean total follow-up 7.8\u00a0years). During the trial, participants randomized to the thiazide diuretic versus the CCB or the ACEi had a lower risk of fracture on adjusted analyses (HR 0.79 [95% CI, 0.63, 0.98], p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Risk of fracture was significantly lower in participants randomized to the diuretic as compared to those randomized to the ACEi (HR 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58, 0.98]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), but not significantly different compared to the CCB (HR 0.87 [95% CI, 0.71, 1.09]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.17). Over the entire trial and post-trial period of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of fractures was non-significantly lower in participants assigned to the diuretic vs assignment to the ACEi or the CCB (HR 0.87 [0.74-1.03], p\u00a0=\u00a00.10) and versus each medication separately. These findings establish a benefit for thiazide diuretic treatment for the prevention of fractures versus other commonly used antihypertensive medications using prospective, randomized data. The effects of the thiazide diuretic on bone appear to be long lasting.", 
    "15": "Background: Enterochromaffin cells (EC) synthesize and release 5-HT and ATP to trigger or modulate gut neural reflexes and transmit information about visceral/pain sensation. Alterations in 5-HT signaling mechanisms may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD or IBS, but the pharmacologic or molecular mechanisms modulating Ca(2+)-dependent 5-HT release are not understood. Previous studies indicated that purinergic signaling via ATP and ADP is an important mechanism in modulation of 5-HT release. However, EC cells also respond to UTP and UDP suggesting uridine triphosphate receptor and signaling pathways are involved as well. We tested the hypothesis that UTP is a regulator of 5-HT release in human EC cells. Methods: UTP signaling mechanisms were studied in BON cells, a human EC model, using Fluo-4/Ca(2+)imaging, patch-clamp, pharmacological analysis, immunohistochemistry, western blots and qPCR. 5-HT release was monitored in BON or EC isolated from human gut surgical specimens (hEC). Results: UTP, UTP\u03b3S, UDP or ATP induced Ca(2+)oscillations in BON. UTP evoked a biphasic concentration-dependent Ca(2+)response. Cells responded in the order of UTP, ATP > UTP\u03b3S > UDP > MRS2768, BzATP, \u03b1,\u03b2-MeATP > MRS2365, MRS2690, and NF546. Different proportions of cells activated by UTP and ATP also responded to UTP\u03b3S (P2Y4, 50% cells), UDP (P2Y6, 30%), UTP\u03b3S and UDP (14%) or MRS2768 (<3%). UTP Ca(2+)responses were blocked with inhibitors of PLC, IP3R, SERCA Ca(2+)pump, La(3+)sensitive Ca(2+)channels or chelation of intracellular free Ca(2+) by BAPTA/AM. Inhibitors of L-type, TRPC, ryanodine-Ca(2+)pools, PI3-Kinase, PKC or SRC-Kinase had no effect. UTP stimulated voltage-sensitive Ca(2+)currents (ICa), Vm-depolarization and inhibited IK (not IA) currents. An IKv7.2/7.3 K(+) channel blocker XE-991 mimicked UTP-induced Vm-depolarization and blocked UTP-responses. XE-991 blocked IK and UTP caused further reduction. La(3+) or PLC inhibitors blocked UTP depolarization; PKC inhibitors, thapsigargin or zero Ca(2+)buffer did not. UTP stimulated 5-HT release in hEC expressing TPH1, 5-HT, P2Y4/P2Y6R. Zero-Ca(2+)buffer augmented Ca(2+)responses and 5-HT release. Conclusion: UTP activates a predominant P2Y4R pathway to trigger Ca(2+)oscillations via internal Ca(2+)mobilization through a PLC/IP3/IP3R/SERCA Ca(2+)signaling pathway to stimulate 5-HT release; Ca(2+)influx is inhibitory. UTP-induced Vm-depolarization depends on PLC signaling and an unidentified K channel (which appears independent of Ca(2+)oscillations or Ica/VOCC). UTP-gated signaling pathways triggered by activation of P2Y4R stimulate 5-HT release.", 
    "16": "Anorexia and metabolic alterations are the main components of the cachectic syndrome. Glucose intolerance, fat depletion, muscle protein catabolism and other alterations are involved in the development of cancer cachexia, a multi-organ syndrome. Nutritional approach strategies are not satisfactory in reversing the cachectic syndrome. The aim of the present review is to deal with the recent therapeutic targeted approaches that have been designed to fight and counteract wasting in cancer patients. Indeed, some promising targeted therapeutic approaches include ghrelin agonists, selective androgen receptor agonists, \u03b2-blockers and antimyostatin peptides. However, a multi-targeted approach seems absolutely essential to treat patients affected by cancer cachexia. This approach should not only involve combinations of drugs but also nutrition and an adequate program of physical exercise, factors that may lead to a synergy, essential to overcome the syndrome. This may efficiently reverse the metabolic changes described above and, at the same time, ameliorate the anorexia. Defining this therapeutic combination of drugs/nutrients/exercise is an exciting project that will stimulate many scientific efforts. Other aspects that will, no doubt, be very important for successful treatment of cancer wasting will be an optimized design of future clinical trials, together with a protocol for staging cancer patients in relation to their degree of cachexia. This will permit that nutritional/metabolic/pharmacological support can be started early in the course of the disease, before severe weight loss occurs. Indeed, timing is crucial and has to be taken very seriously when applying the therapeutic approach.",

    "30": "Breast cancer metastatic to bone has a poor prognosis despite recent advances in our understanding of the biology of both bone and breast cancer. This article presents a new approach, the ABC7 regimen (Adjuvant for Breast Cancer treatment using seven repurposed drugs), to metastatic breast cancer. ABC7 aims to defeat aspects of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that lead to dissemination of breast cancer to bone. As add-on to current standard treatment with capecitabine, ABC7 uses ancillary attributes of seven already-marketed noncancer treatment drugs to stop both the natural EMT process inherent to breast cancer and the added EMT occurring as a response to current treatment modalities. Chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery provoke EMT in cancer generally and in breast cancer specifically. ABC7 uses standard doses of capecitabine as used in treating breast cancer today. In addition, ABC7 uses 1) an older psychiatric drug, quetiapine, to block RANK signaling; 2) pirfenidone, an anti-fibrosis drug to block TGF-beta signaling; 3) rifabutin, an antibiotic to block beta-catenin signaling; 4) metformin, a first-line antidiabetic drug to stimulate AMPK and inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin, (mTOR); 5) propranolol, a beta-blocker to block beta-adrenergic signaling; 6) agomelatine, a melatonergic antidepressant to stimulate M1 and M2 melatonergic receptors; and 7) ribavirin, an antiviral drug to prevent eIF4E phosphorylation. All these block the signaling pathways - RANK, TGF-beta, mTOR, beta-adrenergic receptors, and phosphorylated eIF4E - that have been shown to trigger EMT and enhance breast cancer growth and so are worthwhile targets to inhibit. Agonism at MT1 and MT2 melatonergic receptors has been shown to inhibit both breast cancer EMT and growth. This ensemble was designed to be safe and augment capecitabine efficacy. Given the expected outcome of metastatic breast cancer as it stands today, ABC7 warrants a cautious trial.",

The structure and morphology of the ligand and the stationary phase were characterized by mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The enantiomers of chiral compounds including nine common \u03b2-adrenergic blocker drugs (\u03b2-blockers), eight dansyl amino acids (DNS-AA) and six flavanones were successfully separated by polar organic solvent and reversed-phase chromatography, respectively. The results showed that BZCDP was a kind of multimode chiral separation materials with an excellent chromatographic performance for the above compounds. In polar organic solvent mode, BZCDP can effectively separate \u03b2-blockers, in which the enantioselectivity factors and resolutions of \u03b2-blockers were up to 1.30 and 1.97 within 20min, respectively. Under the reversed-phase mode, BZCDP exhibited high enantioselectivities for DNS-AA, among them the resolution of dansyl-tyrosine was 3.29 with 20min. BZCDP was also successfully used to separate the flavanone compounds with methanol or acetonitrile as mobile phase. The resolution of 4'-hydroxy flavanone enantiomers reached to 3.65 about 15min. Compared with the native \u03b2-cyclodextrin and \u03b3-cyclodextrin-bonded stationary phases in the literature, the separation speed of BZCDP containing mono-N-benzyl-phenethylamino-\u03b2-cyclodextrin ligand was faster and the separation selectivity was better, which indicated that the N-benzyl-phenethylamino group could also take part in the chiral recognition. After further study, we found that in polar organic solvent mode, the inclusion and hydrogen bonding were the main forces of chiral separations, and in reversed-phase mode, the inclusion and hydrophobic interaction are the main driving forces for chiral separations. Besides excellent chromatographic performance, the home-made cyclodextrin column with mesoporous SBA-15 as the matrix was much cheaper than commercial columns, and good permeability, which can reduce the cost of test and provide fast separation. BZCDP has a good prospect in chiral drug analysis.", 
    "33": "Raised resting heart rate (HR), >70 beats per minute (bpm), has been shown to be a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and hospital readmissions, specifically in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF rEF). Given their mortality benefit, \u03b2-blockers are recommended in HF rEF, with a goal to titrate to a maximum tolerated dose rather than a specific HR target.", 
    "34": "To determine the impact of optimal HR control achievement prior to hospital discharge on hospital readmissions in patients with HF rEF receiving \u03b2-blockade.", 
    "35": "A retrospective study of patients admitted to 5 adult hospitals within a large urban health-care system, between 2013 and 2015, was conducted. Patients were identified via International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ( ICD-9) coding for acute on chronic HF rEF.", 
    "36": "Of the 225 patients included, 20% achieved optimal HR control (n = 46, HR <70 bpm; n = 179, HR \u226570 bpm) and only 15% received \u03b2-blocker titration during hospital admission. Of note, 25% of patients receiving \u226550% target dose (n = 79) and 28% receiving 100% target dose (n = 39) achieved optimal HR control. At 30 days, patients with an HR <70 bpm versus HR \u226570 bpm exhibited similar readmission rates (9% vs 11%, respectively; P > .99) and ED visits (11% vs 8%, respectively; P = .57).", 
    "37": "Readmission rates were similar among patients with HF rEF despite the majority failing to achieve optimal HR control from \u03b2-blockade. However, \u03b2-blocker dosing remains suboptimal relative to guideline-recommended target doses. Opportunities exist for inpatient clinicians to optimize \u03b2-blockade in an attempt to achieve HR control.", 
    "38": "Drug-induced gingival hyperplasia (DIGH) causes problems with chewing, aesthetics, and pronunciation, and leads to the deterioration of the patient's quality of life (QOL). Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of DIGH using spontaneous reporting system (SRS) databases.", 
    "39": "We analyzed reports of DIGH from SRS databases and calculated the reporting odds ratios (RORs) of suspected drugs (immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants). The SRS databases used were the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. With the data, we evaluated the time-to-onset profile and the hazard type using the Weibull shape parameter (WSP). Furthermore, we used the association rule mining technique to discover undetected relationships such as possible risk factors.", 
    "40": "The FAERS contained 5,821,716 reports. The RORs (95% confidence interval: CI) for cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, amlodipine, nifedipine, carbamazepine, clobazam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, topiramate, and valproic acid, were 39.4 (95% CI: 30.3-51.2), 4.2 (1.7-10.0), 6.6 (2.5-17.7), 13.1 (7.2-23.2), 94.8 (80.0-112.9), 57.9 (35.7-94.0), 15.1 (10.3-22.3), 65.4 (33.8-126.7), 6.5 (3.6-11.8), 19.7 (8.8-44.0), 65.4 (52.4-82.9), 56.5 (21.1-151.7), 2.9 (1.1-7.7), and 17.5 (12.6-24.4), respectively. The JADER database contained 430,587 reports. The median time-to-onset of gingival hyperplasia values for immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants use were 71, 262, and 37\u00a0days, respectively. Furthermore, the 95% CI of the WSP \u03b2 for anticonvulsants was over and excluded 1, which meant that they were wear-out failure type.", 
    "41": "Our results suggest that DIGH monitoring of patients administered immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, or anticonvulsants is important. We demonstrated the potential risk of DIGH following the long-term use of calcium channel blocker over approximately 260\u00a0days. Based on the results of the association rule mining approach, patients with intellectual disability who are administered phenytoin should be monitored carefully. We recommend that patients who experience symptoms related to DIGH should be closely monitored.", 
    "42": "Riluzole blocks persistent Na(+) current, inhibits generation of neuronal bursts and decreases glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. In previous studies of respiratory activity, riluzole suppressed inspiratory-related burst generation activity in rat slice or en bloc preparations. We examined riluzole's effects on inspiratory burst generation and drug-induced seizure-like activity in newborn rat en bloc preparations. Medulla-spinal cord preparations from postnatal day 0-3 Wistar rats were isolated under deep isoflurane anesthesia and were superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4, at 25-26\u00b0C. Inspiratory activity was monitored from the fourth cervical ventral root. Seizure-like activity was induced by application of 20\u03bcM DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyasparatate (TBOA, a glutamate uptake blocker preferentially acting on astrocytes) or coadministration of GABAA antagonist bicuculline (10\u03bcM) and glycine antagonist strychnine (10\u03bcM). Pretreatment and co-application with 10\u03bcM riluzole abolished the seizure-like burst activity induced by TBOA or bicuculline/strychnine. N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor antagonist MK801 (10\u03bcM) also depressed this activity. Riluzole may attenuate excessive glutamate action involved in pathological hyperexcitability of motor neurons with no major effect on generation of respiratory activity. Riluzole at the optimal dose could be a potential treatment to protect drug-induced epileptic brain tissue from excitotoxic damage without inducing respiratory suppression.", 
    "43": "A single heart rate (HR) measurement may inform future prognosis in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The importance of elevated HR across serial assessment is uncertain, particularly with well-applied guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) with beta blockers (BBs). In this post hoc analysis of 129 patients with chronic HFrEF in sinus rhythm, who had aggressive medication titration over 10.6 months, HR and BB use were assessed at each visit (average of 6 visits per patient). All-cause mortality was assessed. At baseline, 81 subjects (62.8%) had HR \u226570 beats/min; 40 subjects (31.0%) had high HR despite being on \u226550% of GDMT BB dose. At final visit, 30.4% of the subjects still had high HR despite achieving \u226550% target BB dose. There were no significant baseline differences in demographics or BB doses in patients with HR <70 vs HR \u226570 beats/min. In adjusted model in which HR was treated as time-dependent covariate, an increase in HR of 10\u2009 beats/min was associated with an increased hazard of all-cause mortality during follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio per 10 beats/min\u2009=\u20092.46; 95% confidence interval 1.46-4.16, p\u2009<0.001). In conclusion, in well-managed patients with HFrEF, high HR was frequent even after aggressive medication titration, and often despite being on at least 50% of GDMT BB dose. An increase in HR was associated with worse clinical outcomes (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT#00351390).", 
    "44": "For primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), laser treatment or surgery is used when the target intraocular pressure (IOP) cannot be achieved by pharmacological agents, such as prostaglandin (PG) analogs; these drugs also have varied effects. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 74 POAG patients (74 eyes) whose IOP was inadequately controlled by PG analogs (bimatoprost [13 eyes], latanoprost [34 eyes], tafluprost [11 eyes], and travoprost [16 eyes]) and underwent primary trabeculectomy. The proportion of patients with no recurrent IOP elevation within 24 months post-trabeculectomy was significantly (P < 0.001) lower in the bimatoprost group (31.3%) than in the latanoprost (83.2%), tafluprost (45.5%), or travoprost groups (65.6%). Deepening of the upper eyelid sulcus (DUES) was observed before trabeculectomy in 18 of 74 eyes (24.3%) treated with bimatoprost (9 eyes; 50.0%), latanoprost (3 eyes; 16.7%), tafluprost (1 eye; 5.5%) and travoprost (5 eyes; 27.8%). The proportion of patients with no recurrent IOP elevation up to 24 months post-trabeculectomy was significantly (P < 0.0001) lower in the DUES(+) group (34.7%) than in the DUES(-) group (74.3%). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, with no recurrent IOP elevation used as dependent variable, and bimatoprost, latanoprost, travoprost, tafluprost, \u03b2-blocker, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, brimonidine, gender, age, preoperative IOP, mean deviation, duration of PG analog use before surgery, and the number of ophthalmic solutions used as independent variables, identified only bimatoprost as a significant independent factor (P = 0.0368). Thus, the outcome of trabeculectomy varied depending on the PG analog used preoperatively, and bimatoprost use was associated with a high risk of recurrent IOP elevation up to 2 years post-trabeculectomy. This may indicate that the incidence of DUES differed with the PG analog used. Patients with glaucoma who are treated with bimatoprost should be monitored for DUES, and when these patients undergo trabeculectomy, the postoperative course of IOP should be followed carefully.",

He underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery which was uneventful. He was discharged on antiplatelet, beta blocker, nitrate, and statin. On routine health maintenance evaluation, he had no cardiac complaints and had been tolerating well his activities of daily living."
