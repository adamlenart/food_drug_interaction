    "0": "The adrenergic receptors of the fundus of rat stomach are both type alpha and type beta. Activation of the alpha-adrenergic receptors gives a diphasic response in which inhibition precedes excitation. The beta-adrenergic receptors mediate exclusively inhibitory response; the beta-adrenergic component of the inhibitory response is clearly observed only when the alpha-adrenergic component is diminished. The beta-receptors can be assigned, with some reserve, to the betaalpha group.", 
    "1": "Two baboons were prepared with arterial and venous catheters and their heart rate and blood pressure were monitored continuously thereafter. Following a 2 to 3 week interval during which baseline cardiovascular levels were determined, the animals were exposed to daily 12 hr conditioning sessions (alternating with 12-hr \"rest\" or \"Conditioning Off\" sessions) during which fool reward and shock-avoidance were programmed as contingent consequences of pre-specified increases in heart rate. Initially, the criterion heart rate was set at 10-15 bpm above the animal's pre-experimental resting baseline level, with progressive increases programmed to occur at a rate approximating 7 bpm per week over a period of 8-10 weeks. Within this 2-3 month interval, heart rate doubled, reaching levels maintained above 160 bpm for more than 95% of each daily 12-hour \"Conditioning On\" period. Propranolol selectively eliminated the conditioned heart rate increase but not the blood pressure elevation, indicating the contribution of sympathetic nervous activity to these operantly conditioned cardiovascular changes.", 
    "2": "Increments in heart rate during the TNG test (sublingual nitroglycerin with assumption of upright posture), passive head-up tilt, and postrecumbency standing were compared to the effects of intravenous isoproterenol in 15 mild hypertensives during administration of placebo and two dosage levels of propranolol. TNG test results correlated with responsiveness to isoproterenol, but nitroglycerin tachycardia was reduced only about 50% during propranolol treatment. The TNG response was almost maximally inhibited by 160 mg/day of propranolol while the response to postrecumbency standing was inhibited only by a dose of 320 mg/day. The results indicate that: (1) the TNG test is of limited value in the assessment of beta adrenergic blockade in hypertensive patients, and (2) propranolol in a dose of 160 mg/day induces near-maximal cardiac blockade.", 
    "3": "Angina pectoris is a subjective symptom recognized primarily by a careful history. It must be differentiated from nonatherosclerotic chest pain. Arteriography should be performed when the diagnosis is in doubt or when the stable from becomes unstable. Management must include: attention to risk factors; awareness of precipitating factors; treatment of other illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes, and the use of drugs: nitroglycerin and, for long-term therapy, propranolol. If this regimen fails, patients should be considered for surgery.", 
    "4": "Twenty-one hyperthyroid patients participated in an 8-week double-blind crossover trial of propranolol and practolol, and the effecte of these drugs on the clinical and metabolic features of the disease were studied. Propranolol was marginally more effective than practolol, as measured by the hyperthyroid diagnostic index and anxiety scale. Propranolol produced a significant reduction in the serum concentration ratio of tri-iodothyronine to thyroxine, compatible with partial inhibition of peripheral deiodination of thyroxine. Adverse reactions occurred more frequently with propranolol than with practolol. In veiw of the efficacy of practoloo, further trials in hyperthyroid patients of newer beta1-adrenoceptor antagonists, preferably without partial agonist activity, are indicated.", 
    "5": "Small tracking electrodes were inserted into the cat locus coeruleus (LC), and the effects of LC stimulation were determined on the transcallosal potential (TCP) evoked in cerebral cortex on the same side. LC stimulation at 8 volts inhibited TCP amplitude an average of 11%. Rostral LC placements appeared most effective. LC stimulation, without drugs, did not affect the peak latency of the TCP. dl-Propranolol and FLA-63 blocked LC inhibition of the TCP and also increased TCP amplitude per se. Propranolol first increased the latency of the TCP during LC stimulation, then decreased decreased it, while also prolonging the latency of the TCP per se. Phenoxybenzamine increased rather than blocked the LC inhibitory effect and also increased TCP amplitude. dl-Erythro-DOPS slightly increased the LC inhibitory effect, and substantially increased TCP amplitude. dl-Threo-DOPS produced somnolence in unanesthetized animals, led to increased norepinephrine levels in cortex and brain stem, and caused cortical potentials to fluctuate widely. A midbrain lesion of the dorsal ascending NE bundle blocked the LC inhibitory effect. LC stimulation alone, or in combination with evoked cortical stimulation, did not affect the interstimulus electrocorticogram or the heart rate. In the transcallosal system of the cortical regions studied, the LC appears to play mainly an inhibitory role.", 
    "6": "Plasma levels and urinary excretion of pindolol were measured in each of two groups of eleven subjects in order to compare the absorption of the drug when administered alone in the fasting state, and either with food or Binaldix. The data were analyzed according to a one-compartment model with first order absorption. No significant differences in absorption of pindolol were obtained in each study. Food appeared to increase the speed of absorption of pindolol leading to a slightly earlier and higher maximum plasma concentration, but this observation appears to be of no clinical relevance.", 
    "7": "A double-blind cross-over comparison of the antihypertensive actions of alprenolol and pindolol in equipotent doses was carried out in 22 patients with moderately severe essential hypertension. No other drugs were allowed. Ten patients were in WHO grade I, and 12 in grade II. The average initial pressures, similar after both the first and second 4-week placebo periods, were 175/116 mm Hg standing and 175/109 mm Hg supine. These pressures were decreased significantly by each beta-blocking drug, and about equally in both positions. An average reduction, using both 2-month treatment periods, was -13/-7 mm Hg with alprenolol, and with pindolol it was -23/-13 mm Hg. Both systolic and diastolic normotension (less than 160/100) in the supine position occurred in 45% of the patients when treated with alprenolol and in 64% with pindolol. With diastolic normotension alone the figures were 59% and 82% respectively. Rather low daily doses of 400 mg alprenolol and 20 mg pindolol were effective; increasing the doses to the average final levels of 533 mg alprenolol and 25 mg pindolol resulted in just negligible further pressure reductions. There were no serious side effects or complete resistance. Pindolol reduced the resting heart rate significantly in spite of its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Two aspects emerging from this study have clear practical implications. The twice-daily dosage, used here purposefully, of both alprenolol and of pindolol reduces effectively blood pressure, and increases patient convenience. Heat failure was not induced even in those 12 patients with cardiac involvement, including 5 with clear-cut radiological left ventricular enlargement.",

    "9": "This review summarizes current knowledge concerning the value of systolic time intervals in coronary artery disease. Although the usual pattern of prolongation of the preejection period (PEP) and shortening of the left ventricular ejection time (LVET) characteristic of left ventricular failure is seen in acute myocardial infarction, the systolic time intervals (as well as all other measures) are profoundly influenced by adrenergic hyperactivity characteristics of this disorder. Adrenergic stimulation normally shortens both the PEP and LVET indexes and decreases the PEP/LVET ratio. The degree of shortening of electromechanical systole (QS2) is directed related to the excessive adrenergic tone. Patients with the greatest systolic time interval abnormalities have a poorer prognosis, a greater incidence of congestive heart failure and more abnormalities of directly measured indexes of left ventricular performance. The systolic time intervals are useful for assessing left ventricular performance in chronic coronary artery disease as well. In chronic coronary artery disease the PEP/LVET ratio and angiographically determined left ventricular ejection fraction are closely correlated ( r = -0.76), but the level of this correlation is less than that in other forms of left ventricular disease. The left ventricular ejection time index is prolonged after exercise in patients with angina pectoris when compared with findings in normal subjects. Failure of the ischemic ventricle to respond to adrenergic stimulation is the most likely mechanism. Addition of the postexercise left ventricular ejection time to standard treadmill stress testing identifies a significant number of patients (23 percent) who would have had false negative results by electrocardiographic criteria alone. In addition, this index provides confirmatory evidence in those with apparently positive electrocardiographic test data. The systolic time intervals have been useful in assessing both medical and surgical therapy in coronary artery disease. The test can be performed repeatedly and provides a measure of both left ventricular performance and extent of adrenergic hyperactivity. Thus, evaluation of therapy represents the most useful future application of systolic time intervals.", 
    "10": "Isoproterenol infusions depress pentagastrin (PG)-stimulated secretion of acid and pepsin from both gastric fistulae and denervated (Heidenhain) pouches in conscious dogs. It was not found to do so if methacholine replaced gastrin. Propranolol reversed the isoproterenol depression of PG stimulation but had no effect on isoproterenol plus methacholine except on the fistula where both acid and pepsin were depressed. It is felt that PG and methacholine act by differing mechanisms both on chief and parietal cells.", 
    "11": "Injections of phenylephrine into isolated perfused guinea pig hearts increased cyclic AMP and phosphorylase a. Reserpine pretreatment or propranolol decreased or abolished the phenylephrine-induced biochemical changes without affecting the contractile response. Phentolamine, on the other hand, shifted the phenylephrine dose-response curve for contractility to the right without affecting the other parameters. The biochemical effects of phenylephrine are apparently due to the release of noradrenaline while the contractile effect is mediated directly through stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "12": "In the isolated perfused rat heart, the dose-related cardiostimulation produced by norepinephrine (NE) or calcium chloride (Ca2+) was followed by a corresponding increase in coronary flow (CF) and in the cardiac level of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate (cAMP). Prolonged prostaglandin E2 (pge2) infusion did not change the basic force of contraction, CF, or cAMP level but when NE or Ca2+ were administered, only the responses of the CF and the cAMP were diminished. A phosphodiesterase inhibitor, diazoxide (Dx), caused insignificant increase in the basal cAMP, without affecting the force of contraction or CF. With NE or Ca2+, during Dx both the changes in CF and cAMP were augmented compared to the nontreated hearts. The inhibitory effects of NE or Ca2+ remained unchanged. Propranolol abolished the NE but not the Ca2+ effects. It is suggested that PGE2 modulates the cardiac cAMP level and that the latter plays an important role in the adaptive regulation of the CF. It is also postulated that changes in cAMP levels may be brought about by the hyperactivity per se produced by a variety of cardiostimulating agents.", 
    "13": "The characteristics of the positive inotropic effect of different preparations of cholera toxin on the isolated 4-day-old embryonic chick heart were investigated. Crude (CCT) as well as partially purified and purified (PCT)preparations of cholera toxin were shown to have positive inotropic activity. Contractility was increased within 1 minute and reached a maximum at approximately 40 minutes after exposure to toxin. Activities of all three toxin preparations were abolished by heating, their effects were prevented by addition of antitoxin, but nort propranolol, before exposure of the heart to toxin. The positive inotropic effect of PCT was not reversed by washing, but was reversed by subsequent addition of antitoxin. The effects of CCT were reversed by insulin. Effects of both CCT and PCT were potentiated by theophylline, and both toxin preparations elevated tissue levels of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. A filtrate of CCT (MW is less than 30,000) exhibited similar cardiostimulant activity but displayed certain differences from the other toxin preparations. The filtrate was heat stable, and its effects were blocked by pretreatment with propranolol but not by antitoxin. The filtrate of CCT, unlike the toxin-containing preparations, did not stimulate intestinal fluid secretion in the dog.", 
    "14": "The rhythmographic technique was used to study the antiarrthythmic and chromotropic effect of intravenous injections of 10 mg of Obsidan (105 patients), of 10 mg of Isoptine (105 patients), and of oral administrations of 120 mg/day of Obsidan (160 patients) and Isoptine (128 patients). All patients demonstrated persistent extrasystole of different genesis against the background of the sinus rhythm. With intravenous injections the antiarrhythmic effect of Obsidan at rest did not differ from that of Isoptine. Under physical exercises Obsidan tended to display a more powerful negative bathmotropic effect. With the oral route of administration Obsidan was more effective both at rest, and under exercises. It produced a distinct negative chromotropic effect, while Isoptine displayed a biphasic effect. The results of automatic detection of the classes of the antiarrhythmic effect of Obsidan as judged by the dynamics of the sinus rhythm characteristics permit to suggest the possibility of using the later for an individual selection of the therapeutic means for extrasystole.", 
    "15": "The precise mechanism of the vagus in opposing adrenergic influences on cardiac vulnerability has not been defined. In the present investigation, cholinergic stimulation was produced by administering the selective muscarinic agent methacholine (MCh) and ventricular vulnerability was assessed by measuring the repetitive extrasystole (RE) threshold. MCh produced a sustained 98 +/- 12% (P less than 0.0001) increase in the RE threshold; the increase was abolished by concurrent infusion of atropine (0.2 mg/kg). When MCh was administered during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, however, no further increase in RE threshold occurred beyond that resulting from propranolol alone. Infusion of norepinephrine (NE), in a dose insufficient to provoke systemic hypertension, significantly lowered the vulnerable period threshold. This decrease was completely abolished by concurrent vagosympathetic stimulation (VS). It is concluded that VS affects ventricular vulnerability through its muscarinic action and that the protection against VF is in part due to modulation of neural and humoral beta-adrenergic inputs.", 
    "16": "Distribution of a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent, 3H-carteolol in mice was studied by whole body autoradiography. The distribution of radioactivity was observed in all organs except the eyes and brain, with particularly high specific activities in the kidneys, liver, gall bladder and content in the intestines within a short time after either oral or intravenous administration. The radioactivity was then promptly eliminated from all tissues and organs, and excreted almost entirely in the urine and bile. Propranolol is known to be distributed at a high concentration in the brain, whereas the concentration of (3H-) carteolol detectable in the brain was slight. In the adrenal gland, the radioactivity was localized in the medulla. Radioactivity was detected also in the stomach contents after the intravenous administration. The distribution of radioactivity in the fetus through the placenta was less than that in the major organs of the mother mouse, and the elimination of the activity was more rapid in the fetus than in mother. These findings indicate that carteolol and its metabolites do to some extent pass through the blood-brain barrier and placenta.", 
    "17": "Hypotensive effect of dl-Mandelamidine (Olmidine, MA) in combination with some established antihypertensive drugs was studied in conscious normotensive rats. The mean blood pressure and heart rate were measured by means of a pressure transducer via a polyethylene tube inserted into the abdominal aorta of rat according to the method described by Weeks. The results obtained were as follows; 1) The hypotensive effects of guanethidine and hydrochlorothiazide were enhanced in combination with MA. 2) The hypotensive effect of reserpine was reduced by MA. 3) The hypotensive effects of clonidine, C6, propranolol and hydralazine were uneffected by MA. On the other hand, changes in heart rate induced by reserpine and C6 were increased by MA, however, those induced by guanethidine, clonidine propranolol and hydralazine were decreased by MA. The slight decrease in heart rate induced by hydrochlorothiazide was uneffected by MA. In view of our data, it is considered important that investigation of the interaction of antihypertensive drugs be done using conscious animals, as these drugs will be clinically prescribed.", 
    "18": "The paper describes the preparation and study of the pharmacological properties of a series of derivatives with the general formula. (see article) where R is a cyclohexyl or cyclohexenyl radical and R1 is a hydrogen, methyl or cyclohexyl. The compounds with a single cycloaliphatic radical ortho to the basic chain, and in particular the one with a cyclohexyl (exaprolol), were found to be particularly active in blocking the beta-adrenergic receptors, as antiarrhythmics and local anesthetics, while the introduction of a second radical or the shift of the cycloaliphatic radical to meta or para position caused the said pharmacological activities to disappear almost entirely, with the exception of the local anesthetic action.", 
    "19": "Experiments were carried out on the isolated papillary muscle of the rabbit in order to further characterize the alpha-adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic effect. For this purpose dose-response relations of seven sympathomimetic amines were compared under the influence of alpha- and/or beta-adrenolytic drugs. Phentolamine (10(-6) M) shifted the lower part of the dose-response curves for norfenephrine, synephrine and epinine as for phenylephrine and adrenaline to the right, while prindolol (10(-8) M) affected only the upper part of the curves. In the presence of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents the entire dose-response curves for sympathomimetic amines were shifted in a parallel manner. Noradrenaline affected preferentially beta-adrenoceptors, whereas its effect on alpha-adrenoceptors was so weak that it could be detected only when the neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanism of amines were blocked by cocaine (3 X 10(-5) M) and corticosterone (4 X 10(-5) M), respectively. The effect of dopamine was not affected either by phentolamine or by prindolol, but was antagonized by the simultaneous application of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. From the present results, it appears that the following relationships are present between the structure of amines and the alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating activity in the heart: (1) N-methylation increases the potency: (2) Absence of the hydroxyl group either in 3 or in 4 position decreases the intrinsic and beta-adrenoceptor stimulating activities, but increases the alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating activity.", 
    "20": "The effects of Asp1-beta-amide-Val5-angiotensin II (A II) and Asp1-Ile5-angiotensin I (A I) have been studied on the isolated continuously superfused cat tracheal muscle contracted by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Both peptides have been shown to induce dose-dependent relaxation on this muscle. Similar effects have been obtained with synthetic bradykinin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), noradrenaline and histamine. The effects of bradykinin, A I and A II have been shown to be inhibited by aspirin but not by propranolol, metiamide, SC 19220 or a specific, competitive antagonist of A II. The relaxing effect of A I is not due to the conversion of decapeptide to octapeptide A II. The possible mechanism of the relaxing effects of A I and A II on the cat isolated tracheal muscle is discussed.", 
    "21": "The beta-adrenoceptor blockers propranolol, PhQA33 and LB-46 exhibited appreciable activity against tremorine-(TMN) and oxotremorine-(OTMN) induced tremor, whereas pronethalol, (+)-H56/28, (-)-H56/28, K\u00f6-592 and L(+)-INPEA possessed weak action. The two beta-blockers, namely D,L(+/-)-INPEA and D(-)-INPEA acted as weak tremorgens. None of the above compounds suppressed the induced peripheral cholinergic phenomena; or possessed any central anticholinergic activity, as they were unable to afford protection against physostigmine-induced death. Propranolol, PhQA33 and LB-46 antagonized TMN-induced hypothermia and analgesia, but were inactive against OTMN-induced changes. A correlation of the beta-blocking and anti-tremor activity of these agents is unlikely.", 
    "22": "The reflex bradycardia occurring at the maximal isometric heart strain produced by clamping of aorta was shown to be less intense if the heart rate prior to the experiment had been low. Vagotomy prevented or decreased the bradycardia. The beta-adrenoreceptor blockade with inderal significantly reduced the bradycardia, whereas the alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade with tropaphen increased it. The important role of relationship between adrenergic and cholinergic regulation of the heart in development of the bradycardia was discussed.", 
    "23": "Tha alpha-sympathomimetic agonists, clonidine, naphazoline, methoxamine, oxymetazoline and phenylephrine were used to further characterize the alpha-adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic effect in the isolated papillary muscle of the rabbit heart. The maximal inotropic effects of these amines were compared with the effect of isoprenaline and it was examined whether or not these amines compete for alpha-adrenoceptors. On the papillary muscle stimulated at 0.5 Hz, phenylephrine showed a high affinity (pD2 value=6.13) and produced the most pronounced intrinsic activity of the alpha-sympathomimetic amines. Therefore, the intrinsic activity of phenylephrine, in the presence of prindolol (3 X 10(-8) M), was used for comparison with those of the other alpha-agonists. Clonidine caused a positive inotropic effect: the intrinsic activity amounted to 0.32 of that of phenylephrine; the affinity was the highest among the amines tested (pD2 value=6.46); its effect was inhibited by 10(-6) M phentolamine. The affinity and the intrinsic activity of naphazoline were slightly lower than those of clonidine. Methoxamine showed a relatively high intrinsic activity (0.56) but the lowest affinity (4.68). Oxymetazoline did not cause any positive inotropic effect. Clonidine, naphazoline and oxymetazoline antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine, mediated via the alpha-adrenocaptors in the presence of 3 X 10(-8) M prindolol, in a competitive manner. This observation suggests that these alpha-sympathomimetic amines compete with phenylephrine for the same receptor site. Thus the present results provide additional evidence for alpha-adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic actions of sympathomimetic amines in the rabbit papillary muscle.", 
    "24": "Pineal denervation by superior cervical ganglionectomy (Gx) decreased high affinity binding of estradiol (E2) to the pineal cytosol of female rats and of testosterone to the cytosol of male rats by 40 and 26% and by 75 and 80%, 5 and 14 days after sugery; hormone binding remained unchanged up to 24 h after surgery. Binding to the nuclear fraction decreased sigificantly by 2 weeks after incorporation of (3H) leucine into pineal proteins in Gx. A single injection of E2 (mug) to testosterone propionate (TP) (500 mug) failed to increase the Gx rats when injected 1 or 5 days after surgery. Significant increases were observed in sham-operated controls or in rats subjected to bilateral decentralization of ganglia; however on the 5th day an impairment was observed in hormone ability to enhance [3H]leucine incorporation in decentralized rats. The administration of isoproterenol 19 and 3 h before sacrifice replenished pineal-binding sites for E2 and testosterone in Gx rats, but failed to restore the responsiveness of denervated pineals to hormone administration. Moreover, E2 or TP treatment blocked the increase in labeled amino acid incorporation into proteins brought about by isoproterenol per se. The administration of propranolol 2 and 7 h after hormone injection decreased the ability of E2 and TP to enhance [3H]leucine incorporation by 55 and 41%, respectively. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity of the superior cervical ganglia decreased by 36 and 41% 6 h after E2 or TP administration, and by 43 and 47% after 3 daily injections of the hormones, whereas pineal tyrosine hydroxylase remained unchanged. Hormone treatment for 3 days increased the in vitro uptake of norepinephrine by the ganglia but did not affect uptake in the pineal gland. These data indicate that the integrity of neurons of the superior cervical ganglia is an absolute requirement for E2 and testosterone to enhance [3H]leucine incorporation into pineal proteins in rats.", 
    "25": "Recent studies demonstrated that epinephrine causes significant pulmonary A-V shunting. This study reports the effect of alpha and beta adrenergic blockade on this shunting. Sixty-three anesthetized mongrel dogs were ventilated with a mechanical respirator. Measurements of (1) the pulmonary shunt, (2) cardiac output, (3) mean pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillary wedge and systemic pressures, and (4) pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances were obtained at 5, 15 and 30 minute intervals during the first hour and hourly for 5 hours. Fifteen dogs received no treatment. All others received epinephrine hydrochloride, 2 mug/kg/min for 5 hours. Ten received epinephrine only. Ten were pretreated with propranolol hydrochloride, 250 mug/kg, 12 with phenoxybenzamine, 1 mg/kg, and 16 with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. Propranolol significantly decreased the epinephrine induced pulmonary shunt at all times and was the most effective drug. Phenoxybenzamine decreased the early shunting, but less than propranolol, and did not decrease the late shunting. Blockade with propranolol and phenoxybenzamine was less effective than propranolol alone. Based on the observed hemodynamic changes it was suggested that beta blockade is effective in reducing epinephrine induced pulmonary insufficiency by favorably altering the flow and distribution of pulmonary blood flow which in turn decreases epinephrine induced ventilation-perfusion inequalities and capillary hypertension both of which result in shunting. Conversely phenoxybenzamine has an unfavorable effect on the pulmonary flow. These studies support previous work in animals and man which showed that beta adrenergic stimulation is important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary insufficiency. Because the amounts of epinephrine used produce blood levels observed in critical illness, these studies add support to a relationship between the increased catecholamine stimulation of critical illness and the associated and often unexplained pulmonary insufficiency.", 
    "26": "The effect of catecholamines on the intracellular pH of rat cardiac and skeletal muscle during varying extracellular acid-base states was determined. Intracellualr pH (pHi) was calculated from the distribution of [14C]DMO. Acid-base disturbances were produced by placing the animals in an environmental chamber containing 10 or 20% CO2 or by administering HCL or NaHCO3. Two hours later the animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and blood and tissue samples obtained. In one series of animals, the effects of catecholamines were attenuated by administering the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist MJ 1999 (Sotalol). In animals breathing 20% CO2, cardiac muscle pH was lower in beta-blocked than unblocked animals (6.69 vs. 6.78). During metabolic acidosis, cardiac muscle pH of beta-blocked animals was lower than that of unblocked animals (6.75 vs. 6.84). The same relationship was observed for skeletal muscle during metabolic acidosis-beta blockade pHi, 6.66; unblocked pHi, 6.77. The pHi of beta-blocked versus unblocked animals was not significantly different under normal acid-base conditions or metabolic alkalosis for cardiac or skeletal muscle. The effective buffer value of both tissue over the normal acidotic range was decreased by the beta-blocking agent. These results indicate that catecholamine release accompanying acidosis attenuates the change in pHI and increases the effective buffer value of cardiac and skeletal muscle.", 
    "27": "The course of myocardial necrosis, the clinical syndrome, and methods of treatment are presented. Heart cell death may be prevented by maintaining the balance between myocardial oxygen and energy supply and consumption. New technics of improving this balance by reducing myocardial energy demand, altering metabolism, increasing myocardial substrate supply, and protecting cellular integrity are discussed.", 
    "28": "The capacity of (1-Sarcosine, 8-Threonine) angiotensin II to block the contractile and pressor effects of exogenous and endogenous angiotensin II was examined. In isolated rabbit aorta, the pA2 value (from pA2 plots) for the analog was 8.75 +/- 0.11. Both the maximum response and the slope of the dose-response curve to angiotensin II were unchanged by the analog. In ganglion-blocked vagotomized rats, infusion of the analog produced a dose-dependent blockage of the angiotensin II pressor effect. In these rats, the analog displayed less agonistic activity than that of (1-Sarcosine, 8-Isoleucine) and (1-Sarcosine, 8-Alanine) angiotensin II. In two-kidney hypertensive rats, the angiotensin II antagonist significantly reduced the arterial blood pressure. The results indicate that (1-Sar, 8-Thr) angiotensin II is a potent antagonist of angiotensin II with less inherent agonistic activity than previously reported analogs.", 
    "29": "The response of rat liver adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] to catecholamines is enhanced after adrenalectomy. To investigate this phenomenon, we developed an in vitro assay for beta-adrenergic receptors of plasma membranes derived from livers of control and adrenalectomized rats, using [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (IHYP), a potent beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Binding of IHYP reached equilibrium within 30 min and dissociation occurred with a half-time of approximately 60 min. The l-isomers of isoproterenol and propranolol were at least 50 times more potent as inhibitors of IHYP binding than were the corresponding d-isomers. Adrenalectomy did not affect the rates of association or dissociation of IHYP or the dissociation constants of several ligands that are active at beta-adrenergic receptors. The number of binding sites for IHYP was determined in homogenates and in purified membranes of livers from control and adrenalectomized rats. The number of sites increased 3- to 5-fold after adrenalectomy. A similar increase in hormone stimulation of adenylate cyclase was observed. These changes were reversed by the administration of cortisone. The increase in the number of binding sites for IHYP may be a compensatory response to the impairments in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis which occur after adrenalectomy.",

Associated electrocardiographic changes usually correspond to the coronary artery affected and disappear when the attack of pain ends.

There have been scattered reports of myocardial infarction occurring in patients with normal coronary arteries; a role of arterial spasm in these cases in speculative.", 
    "31": "The effect of propranolol inhalation on sensitivity to methacholine inhalation was studied in normal and allergic rhinitis subjects to determine whether beta adrenergic blockade alters sensitivity to mediators in nonasthmatic atopic individuals.

    "32": "During the six-year period, 1968-1973, sepsis developed in 1 of every 80 patients admitted to the Presbyterian Hospital, New York. In 1 of 133 patients the sepsis was due to Gram-positive organisms, and in 1 of 188 patients to Gram-negative organisms. The mortality rate for Gram-positive cases was 4.4 percent, for Gram-negative cases 19.1 percent, and for urologic cases 15.3 percent (versus 56.25 percent in 1959-1964). Data are presented on the relative incidences of involved pathogens in 1740 cases of Gram-positive sepsis /78 deaths), and in 1236 cases of Gram-negative sepsis (205 deaths). The lowering of the sepsis mortality rate has been the result of preventative measures, early diagnosis, and vigorous treatment. Treatment includes the correction of acidosis and anoxia, early administration of bactericidal antibiotics, and restoration of the microcirculation by administration of corticosteroids, beta-adrenergic drugs, and appropriate diuretics.", 
    "33": "The effects of sublingually administered nitroglycerin on segmental left ventricular wall motion determined by videotracking and radiographic left heart size were evaluated at rest and during submaximal hand grip exercise in 10 patients with previous transmural myocardial infarction. After nitroglycerin, diastolic left heart size decreased in the resting state from an average of 49.5 +/- 5.7 (standard deviation) to 47.9 +/- 5.6 mm/m2 body surface area (P less than 0.01) and during handgrip exercise from a mean of 50.7 +/- 590 to 49.1 +/- 4.7 mm/m2 (P less than 0.05). In the resting state, the average maximal velocity of shortening in segments with normal wall motion increased after nitroglycerin from 18.1 +/- 3.0 to 23.5 +/- 5.5 mm/sec (P less than 0.01), whereas during handgrip exercise alone, the velocity of shortening averaged 25.6 +/- 6.9 mm/sec and increased further after nitroglycerin to 30.1 +/- 10.6 mm/sec (P less than 0.05). The effects of nitroglycerin on the average extent of shortening in normal segments were similar. In all 10 patients, there was a decrease in the number of segments with abnormal wall motion. The number of sites with dyssynergy decreased after nitroglycerin from 24 to 15 in the resting state and from 40 to 22 when nitroglycerin was administered before handgrip exercise. Sublingually administered nitroglycerin appears to decrease left heart size, increase the velocity and extent of shortening in normal left ventricular segments and often reduce the extent of left ventricular wall motion abnormalities at rest and during isometric exercise in patients with previous transmural myocardial infarction.", 
    "34": "There is as yet no adequate animal mode for human myocardial ischemia. The commonly utilized technique of coronary arterial ligation in large animals may induce regional ischemia but introduces variables that make it difficult to compare studies in different laboratories. A model of global ischemia in an isolated perfused rat heart that offers a rapid, inexpensive means for producing graded, controlled, stable state and reproducible ischemia is described. The technique has been utilized with success to study the hemodynamic and metabolic effects of ischemia and to evaluate pharmacologic interventions designed to protect the ischemic myocardium. Propranolol has been shown to improve bioenergetics and reduce anaerobic glycolysis by a depression of the hemodynamic response of ischemic myocardium. Methylprednisolone appears to exert its primary effect by direct coronary vasodilation, increasing resting or control flow and providing an enhanced reserve when ischemia is imposed. Mannitol improves cardiac performance by reducing the increased myocardial cell water content induced by hypoxia or anoxia.", 
    "35": "Propranolol has been shown to reduce the extent of necrosis that develops after temporary coronary occlusion in dogs. To determine whether this protective action was related to beta adrenergic blockade or to direct effects, necrosis was quantitated in the posterior papillary muscle 2 to 4 days after 40 minute periods of coronary occlusion in anesthetized open chest dogs. Groups of dogs either were untreated or were pretreated with doses of d,l-propranolol, 0.005 to 5 mg/kg body weight, or doses of d-propranolol 2.5 or 5 mg/kg. Necrosis was greatly reduced in dogs treated with 5 mg/kg of d, l-propranolol. This protective effect was significant but quantitatively less with 0.5 and 0.05 mg/kg of d, l-propranolol. A dose of 0.005 mg/kg d, l-propranolol and d-propranolol failed to alter myocardial necrosis significantly. The dose-related reduction of necrosis with d, l-propranolol correlated with a similar dose relation for beta adrenergic blockade and suggested that a protective effect was related to beta blockade. The reduction of necrosis with 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg of d, l-propranolol (a level at which direct \"membrane stabilizing\" effects are insignificant) suggested that direct effects were not essential for protection. The negative results with d-propranolol further support our conclusion that propranolol reduces myocardial ischemic injury through beta adrenergic blockade rather than through direct myocardial actions.", 
    "36": "Twenty-seven patients with hypertension were randomly allocated to a 10 month crossover study. Treatment consisted of spironolactone (200 mg/day for 2 months), propranolol (320 mg/day for 2 months) and combined administration of both drugs at half the dosage. Between treatment periods placebo was given for 2 months. Fourteen patients were previously untreated. The average pretreatment blood pressure for the entire group was 188/114 +/- 16/7(mean +/- standard deviation) mm Hg supine and 188/118 +/- 20/9 mm Hg standing. Both spironolactone and propranolol reduced blood pressure significantly in both the supine and standing positions. Upright plasma renin activity was determined by radioimmunoassay of angiotensin I. The average initial level was 1.9 +/- 1.2 (range 0.4 to 5.0) ng/ml/hr. There was a close correlation between plasma renin activity and the effects of the drugs: With increasing renin level the response to propranolol was better whereas the opposite was true for spironolactone. The combination of spironolactone and propranolol decreased the blood pressure still further in the supine and standing positions, irrespective of initial plasma renin activity. All patients achieved a normal supine pressure. Blood pressure and plasma renin activity returned toward pretreatment values during placebo administration. It is concluded that pretreatment levels of plasma renin activity can predict the antihypertensive response to propranolol and spironolactone. The combination of the two drugs, which have different modes of action, will effectively reduce blood pressure in hypertension. The results support the concept that the renin-angiotensin-aldo-sterone system may be involved in primary hypertension.", 
    "37": "Present knowledge of the mechanisms regulating release of renin is reviewed with particular emphasis on neural factors. Evidence is given for a direct effect of renal innervation on beta adrenergic receptors in juxtaglomerular cells, and for the involvement of reflex release of renin in conditions such as tilting and acute salt depletion. Participation of neural and nonneural mechanisms of control is also shown to occur in other conditions, such as aortic constriction and hemorrhage. The view is held that neural sympathetic factors might explain some of the renin disturbances found in essential hypertension. First, in patients with high renin hypertension part of the hypertension is renin-dependent, and these pressor levels of renin seem to be neurally induced since they can commonly be suppressed by beta adrenoreceptor blocking agents. Second, the hypothesis is presented that patients with low renin hypertension, at least those who have no volume disturbance, have a blunted sympathetic control of renin release. Therefore a sufficiently precise test of sympathetic activity, and possibly of body fluid volumes, should be associated with renin profiles for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension and as a better guide to therapeutic management. Indeed, most of the available antihypertensive drugs act on sympathetic activity, body fluid volume or renin, and this multifaceted profile would provide more rational guidelines for treatment.", 
    "38": "Beta adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta blockers) differ greatly in their cardioselectivity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and these differences may have important therapeutic consequences. We have therefore studied the effect on blood pressure, heart rate and plasma renin activity of the beta blocking drug oxprenolol (Trasicor) which has considerable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, both alone and in combination with the benzothiadiazine cyclopenthiazide. Eleven patients with mild to moderate benign essential hypertension were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. Oxprenolol was given as the first drug to Group 1, and cyclopenthiazide as the first drug to Group 2. The patients were assessed before the start of treatment, after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with one drug and after a further 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with both drugs. Heart rate, blood pressure and plasma renin activity were measured with the patients recumbent and after a standardized tilt to 85 degrees to provide a reflection of day to day cardiovascular stress. Oxprenolol reduced arterial blood pressure without inducing significant bradycardia. The addition of cyclopenthiazide had little further effect. Oxprenolol alone suppressed plasma renin activity both at rest and during tilt and also abolished the increase in plasma renin activity after administration of cyclopenthiazide. The combination of (1) moderate reduction of blood pressure. (2) inhibition of the otherwise inevitable increase in plasma renin activity with the use of a diuretic drug, and (3) only moderate inhibition of overall sympathetic activity indicates that it is possible to achieve physiologic balance with the appropriate beta blocking drug.", 
    "39": "The interaction between cedilanid-D and metoprolol, a selective beta receptor blocking agent, on exercise tolerance and systolic intervals was studied in 15 patients with angina pectoris. The patients had been treated with metoprolol for several months in a dose of 50 mg, three times daily (one patient received 25 mg three times daily). Each patient participated in two studies separated by at least 1 week. After arriving at the laboratory each received 50 mg of metoprolol orally; thereafter, either cedilanid-D or placebo was infused intravenously in a double-blind study performed in randomized order. When the effect of the drugs was maximal, the systolic intervals and the heart volume were recorded at rest, and the exercise tolerance was tested with a bicycle ergometer. The mean maximal value of plasma concentrations of metoprolol assessed during the study was about 50 ng/ml but the variation among subjects was great (20 to 187 ng/ml). After administration of cedilanid-D there was a shortening of the pre-ejection period and left ventricular ejection time compared with results after placebo; the reduction was similar to that found after administration of cedilanid-D without beta blocking drugs. The total heart volume decreased by an average of 55 ml, but the individual variation was great. The patients' average work capacity, expressed as total work, was not altered by cedilanid-D when compared with results after placebo. No relation was found between initial heart size and the effect of cedilanid-D on capacity for physical work. It therefore appears that there is no indication for the routine use of digitalis during beta blocking therapy in patients with angina pectoris who do not have cardiac failure.", 
    "40": "With use of a canine model of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and an intracellular lactic dehydrogenase stain to measure infarct size directly, the effects of allopurinol, methylprednisolone sodium succinate and propranolol were studied. Allopurinol did not influence the extent of myocardial necrosis, whereas both methylprednisolone and propranolol significantly reduced myocardial infarct size. Possible mechanisms of action and clinical applicability of these agents are discussed.", 
    "41": "The independence of indices of contractility to Starling effects was tested in 6 closed-chest dogs. After vagal and beta-receptors blockade, indices calculated with total left ventricular isometric pressure (TP), were shown to be strongly dependent of rises in end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) induced by dextran infusion. At LVEDP of 14.6 +/- 1.5, 22.2 +/- 1.1 and 32.8 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (+/- SEM), the peak value of velocity of the contractile elements calculated with total pressure (peak VCE, TP) diminished by 21, 40 and 50%, and the extrapolated value of VCE, TP at zero total pressure (Vmax, TP) diminished by 15, 30 and 44%. In contrast, indices calculated with developed pressure (DP = TP-LVEDP) at the same LVEDP were much less influenced, particularly the extrapolated value of VCE, DP at zero DP (V max, DP5) and (peak dP/dt)/DP did not significantly change. During angiotensin infusion, expected decreases in TP indices secondary to LVEDP rises were partially masked by simultaneous increases in contractility, and DP indices tended to rise. On the other hand, with minimal changes in LVEDP, as during calcium injection and paired stimulation, increases in TP and DP indices demonstrate inotropic effects equally well. Our study also shows that, besides Vmax calculated with DP, the instantaneous ratio of peak dP/dt and DP can also be proposed as a simpler and thus more convenient index of contractility independent of volume changes.", 
    "42": "Surviving ability in frost (-20 degree C) was studied in cold acclimatized guinea-pigs given either reserpine, propranolol or saline. Survival time, rectal temperature at death, serum glucose, serum FFA and triglycerides in the interscapular adipose tissue were determined. Rectal temperature was highest in the reserpine group, in the same animals that endured the frost the shortest time. The survival time had decreased by about a half of that in the controls. Propranolol treatment decreased the living time only slightly. The fact that serum glucose remained high in the reserpine treated animals was obviously related to the short survival time. In the propranolol group glucose values were somewhat higher than in the control group (saline-animals). Reserpine seemed to have inhibited the release of FFA in the warm-acclimatized animals as interpreted from the low serum values. On the other hand, FFA were rather high in the cold-acclimatized reserpine animals. The blocking effect of reserpine reflected also in the higher contents of triglycerides in the adipose tissue both in cold-acclimatized and warm-acclimatized animals. Propranolol prevented slightly the depletion of the triglycerides. Amount of total lipids in the adipose tissue was lower in the cold-acclimatized animals than in the warm-acclimatized ones because of the change of the type of the adipocytes from unilocular to multilocular. The results corroborated the importance of FFA for longer survival in severe cold. Sensitization to reserpine seems to develop during cold-acclimatization. It calls attention to a possible hazard of reserpine treatment in cold environment.", 
    "43": "The effects of sotalol after oral administration were measured on the tachycardia induced by strenuous exercise in normal subjects. Plasma sotalol levels were also determined. The oral administration of sotalol (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg) to 6 subjects produced a progressive reduction in the tachycardia induced by severe exercise. This was similar to the effects of 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg given to different subjects. Each increase in sotalol dose produced a successively greater reduction in exercise tachycardia. This did not appear to be maximum even with 800 mg. Oral sotalol was rapidly absorbed and produced peak blood levels in 2 - 3 hours. The plasma levels of sotalol measured 2 hours after the oral administration of 25 to 800 mg showed never more than a six-fold variation between different subject. The half-life of sotalol in plasma was 12.7 +/- SE 1.6 hours. There was a significant correlation between the logarithm of the plasma sotalol concentration and the percentage reduction of exercise heart rate. It is concluded that the oral administration of sotalol either once or twice daily (depending on dose level) will provide satisfactory 24-hour blockade of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "44": "A study, using non-invasive techniques, was carried out in ten patients with essential hypertension to examine the mechanism of the hypotensive effect of propranolol when used in combination with a potent vasodilator antihypertensive - minoxidil. The hypotensive effect of minoxidil, a mean (+/- SEM) decrease of 42.4 +/- 4.3 mm Hg, was accompanied by a marked increase in heart rate, cardiac index and plasma renin activity and a significant decrease in total peripheral resistance, limb vascular resistance and pre-ejection period. Addition of propranolol further reduced mean arterial pressure by an average of 12.9 +/- 2.0 mm Hg. Propranolol returned cardiac index to control values and total peripheral resistance index rose but not to control levels. Plasma renin activity was significantly reduced by propranolol. By multiple regression analysis no correlation was found between propranolol-induced decrease in mean arterial pressure and changes in cardiac index, total peripheral resistance index or plasma renin activity. Quantitatively, the reduction in cardiac index observed probably accounted for the hypotensive effect of propranolol. The role of plasma renin activity reduction in the hypotensive effect of propranolol in this situation remains to be clarified. The findings in the present study were consonant with the known actions of vasodilator antihypertensive agents and propranolol and indicate the applicability of non-invasive methodology to the investigation of cardiovascular drugs in man.", 
    "45": "Propranolol was given to 30 patients with essential hypertension following randomised, double-blind administration of either placebo or a new cardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, atenolol (Tenormin, ICI 66 082). Both atenolol and propranolol caused statistically significant reduction of recumbent and erect blood pressure and heart rate. There were no important differences between these variables on comparison of atenolol and propranolol.", 
    "46": "The effect of sotalol, a beta-adrenergic blocking drug, on the frequency of angina pectoris attacks and on exercise tolerance was evaluated by a double-blind cross-over study in 30 selected patients suffering from stable angina pectoris. Sotalol significantly reduced the mean number of attacks of angina, the consumption of glyceryl trinitrate tablets and the pulse rate at rest and in response to exercise. Effort tolerance as judged by a suboptimal 2-step test was improved significantly, as was electrocardiographic response. A relatively moderate dose of sotalol, 320 mg per day (160 mg twice daily), was sufficient in 80% of the patients. Side-effects were negligible.", 
    "47": "A case is presented of a patient who developed ocular symptoms and a skin rash after treatment with oxprenolol (Trasicor) for 2 months. The lesions improved on withdrawal of the drug and her eye symptoms became worse when she was again treated with oxprenolol. Patients who receive beta-adrenergic blocking drugs must be watched carefully for side-effects.", 
    "48": "The contractile and hemodynamic effects of lidocaine, diphenylhydantoin and ajmaline were compared in isolated ventricular myocardium and in patients during diagnostic cardiac catheterization. The animal experiments show that diphenylhdantoin is 3-5 times more potent as a contractility inhibitor than lidocaine. This experimental relationship correlates with the clinical findings in which only small decreases in the pumping function of the left ventricle appear with lidocaine while diphenylhydantoin has a 2-2.5 times stronger depressor effect (reduction of cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume by 17-20%). With ajmaline there is a decrease of the stroke volume by a maximum of 17% and changes in isovolumetric contractility quantities corresponding to a decrease in myocardial contractility of 16-22%. It may be concluded from these findings that diphenylhydantoin and ajmaline may be accompanied by marked decreases in hemodynamic and contractile quantities of the left ventricle. The relative power of lidocaine to inhibit contractility is small, so that even in the presence of an existing disturbance of myocardial function, only a slight additional decrease in pumping function is to be expected.", 
    "49": "A 39-year-old man twice experienced ventricular fibrillation and exhibited numerous ventricular premature beats. Coronary arteries were normal, and no impaired cardiac function was found upon catheterization. Evidence was adduced that the ventricular premature beats were related to higher nervous activity. The patient had serious psychiatric problems; the ventricular premature beats were provoked by psychophysiologic stress, increased during REM sleep, were reduced by meditation, and were controlled by beta-adrenergic blockade, phenytoin and digitalization. We conclude that psychologic and neurophysiologic factors may predispose to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia in the absence of organic heart disease. Effective management of the recurrent ventricular arrhythmia involved; acute drug testing for assessing antiarrhythmic efficacy; use of programmed trendscription to provide on-line information on drug action; a treatment program involving more than one agent; and use of measures to reduce sympathetic nervous activity.", 
    "50": "The influence of certain drugs on the ultrastructure of rabbit pinealocytes was studied. The results obtained after administration of p-chlorophenylalanine and p-chloroamphetamine support the hypothesis proposed earlier that the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the light pinealocytes is involved in indoleamine synthesis. The administration of either one of the sympatholytic agents, 6-hydroxydopamine or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, induced typical fine structural changes corresponding to those observed after surgical sympathectomy.", 
    "51": "Rabbit white adipose tissue, in vitro, may not respond to epinephrine by an increase in the rate of lipolysis although beta adrenergic receptors may be postulated from our experiments with isoproterenol. When basal rate of lipolysis is high, an antilipolytic effect may be shown for low concentrations of epinephrine (0.01 and 0.1 mug/ml). However, epinephrine and an alpha adrenergic blocker, phentolamine (5 mug/ml), acting together, abolish the antilipolytic effect and better still a strong lipolytic effect of epinephrine is unmasked in such a case. The best evidence of these results is that inhibitory alpha, adrenergic receptors are involved in Rabbit white fat cells. These facts partially explain the absence of lipolytic response with epinephrine previously described.", 
    "52": "A study on serum levels of enzymes during abortion was done. Abortion was induced in 30 women aged 17 to 32. All were healthy and in the 2nd trimester of their pregnancy. The methods used to induce abortion varied. The cistin-aminopeptide activity was constantly measured during the process of the operation. This activity rose as beta-treatment was given decreasingly.", 
    "53": "Two cases are presented and a third is cited from the literature in which the onset of hyperthyroidism exacerbated acute weakness in previously undiagnosed myotonic dystrophy. In two of the cases a return to the euthyroid state after treatment was associated with marked clinical improvement in muscle weakness. In the third case, severe bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness, which was apparently aggravated by the thyrotoxicosis, was followed by aspiration pneumonitis and death. Possible mechanisms for the effect of excessive thyroxine on muscle function are reviewed. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of the hyperthyroidism is extremely important.", 
    "54": "Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (I-HYP) is a chemically defined, high affinity, high specific activity beta-adrenergic antagonist that interacts with a single site on the turkey erythrocyte membrane. Study of the interaction of agonists, antagonists, and congeners with this site and concomitant alterations in adenylate cyclase activity have been carried out in the presence of high or low concentrations of guanine nucleotide. The results help clarify the relationship between binding and activation or inhibition of adenylate cyclase and the role of guanine nucleotides in modulating this interaction. There is a close correlation between binding constants (KD) for inhibitors determined by analysis of competitive displacement of 125I-HYP from receptor, and apparent affinities (Ki) for inhibition of adenylate cyclase. For activators, however, there is up to a 10-fold difference between KD and apparent affinity (KDapp) for adenylate cyclase activation at low guanine nucleotide concentration (10(-6) M guanylylimidodiphosphate). This difference is virtually abolished by employing higher nucleotide concentrations (10(-5) M guanylylimidodiphosphate) without significantly altering receptor affinity. This suggests that guanine nucleotides act by modulating receptor-enzyme interactions rather than hormone-receptor interactions. Moreover, several beta-adrenergic analogs previously shown to have no effect on adenylate cyclase in the absence of nucleotide, are partial agonists in the presence of 10(-5) M guanylylimidodiphosphate. Parallel analyses for a series of agonists and antagonists for adenylate cyclase activation and receptor interaction show affinities for levorotatory isomers generally 100-fold greater than for dextrorotatory isomers. Thus stereoconfiguration at the beta carbon clearly influences affinity of agonists or antagonists. Affinity is also importantly influenced by the nature of the aromatic ring as well as the N-alkyl group. The complexity of structure-function relationships for these compounds requires a redefinition of structural requirements for beta-adrenergic activity.", 
    "55": "Hydroxybenzylpindolol (HYP) is a specific and highly potent beta-adrenergic antagonist. Monoiodination of HYP produces an equally high affinity inhibitor of binding to and activation of the beta receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase in turkey erythrocyte membranes. Monoiodohydroxybenzylpindolol was isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Mass spectroscopy showed that the iodine was contained in the phenolic moiety of the molecule. 125I-HYP was purified in tracer amounts by ion exchange chromatography; specific activities were achieved (1500 to 2000 Ci/mmol) approaching theoretical for 1 mol of iodine/mol of HYP. 125I-HYP interacts with a single stereospecific site with affinity of 4 to 5 X 10(10) M-1 by Scatchard analysis. Maximal binding capacity was 0.2 to 0.3 pmol/mg of membrane protein. If recovery of receptor were complete, this would correspond to 400 to 600 receptor sites per cell. Kinetic analyses of the on and off reactions gave a kinetically derived KA in good agreement with that derived from thermodynamic methods both at 20 degrees and 37 degrees. No evidence is found in these experiments for cooperative interaction of ligands with the receptor system. Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol thus represents a high affinity, high specific activity ligand of established chemical structure which should prove useful in studying the interaction of other blockers and agonists with the beta-adrenergic receptor in this and other biological systems.", 
    "56": "[125I]Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol, an extremely potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, has been purified to theoretical specific activity (2200 Ci/mmol) and used as a ligand to characterize the beta-adrenergic receptors of cultured rat glioma cells and other cultured cell clones. Appropriate receptor sites were identified by stereoselective competition for binding by a number of adrenergic agonists and antagonists, by correlation between the potency of these compounds to inhibit binding and to affect adenylate cyclase activity, and by correlation of binding with the presence or absence of response to catecholamines (stimulation of adenylate cyclase) in various cell clones. In equilibrium experiments, the dissociation constant for binding of the iodinated ligand to the beta-adrenergic receptor of a clone of rat glioma cells (C6TG1A) was 250 pM; the corresponding value for a clone of human fibroblasts (VA2) was 15 pM. For C6TG1A, KD was verified by analysis of the kinetics of binding: k1 = 10(8) 1/mol/min: k-1 = 0.017/min. This rate of dissociation of ligand from the receptor was also established by study of the rate of activation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol after prior equilibration with iodohydroxybenzylpindolol. For VA2 cells, where affinity was higher, the rate of reversal of binding was only 0.0035/min. C6TG1A contained approximately 4000 receptor sites/cell (75 fmol/mg of protein), and these sites appeared to be coupled to adenylate cyclase in a stoichiometric manner. A second site with equal affinity for iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (KD = 250 pM) was also identified in C6TG1A by both kinetic analysis and equilibrium binding studies. While most compounds that interacted with the beta-adrenergic receptor also influenced binding to the second site, the latter did not distinguish between stereoisomers of propranolol, and its affinity for the other compounds tested was poorer.", 
    "57": "This study was designed to obtain information under general practice conditions on the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed combination of the beta-blocking agent oxprenolol 80 mg (Trasicor 80) and hydrochlorothiazide + KCl (Esidrex-K) in the treatment of moderate essential hypertension. Patients with a diastolic pressure of 100 to 130 mm Hg were covered by the study. The dosage of Trasicor was kept relatively low and at a constant level, i.e. one tablet twice daily throughout. In the group of 370 patients whose record had been completed according to the treatment plan, the systolic and diastolic pressures fell on the average by 28 and 17 mm Hg respectively. After 10 weeks of therapy, the diastolic pressure was normalized (i.e. below 95 mm Hg) in 226 patients. The mean decreases in pressure were statistically significant after two weeks' treatment. The mean pulse rate fell from 79 to 73. Tolerance of the regimen was very good in 75% of patients; 57 patients were withdrawn from the study for various reasons.", 
    "58": "Oxprenolol or methyldopa were administered in double-blind fashion to 29 patients shown to be persistently hypertensive. After a dose-finding, assessment, and washout period, the second drug was given. 24 patients completed a period of treatment with each drug. Blood-pressure falls were similar with each drug in the supine, standing, and post-exercise state. Half the patients responded will to low dosage (oxprenolol less than or equal to 320 mg, methyldopa less than or equal to 1 g, a day) and 9 of 11 such patients responded satisfactorily to each drug. In those whose response was inadequate, oxprenolol was increased to 960 mg or methyldopa to 3 g a day. Increasing dosage had no consistent pressure-lowering effect. Side-effects were assessed by questionnaire and no clear preference emerged. It is recommended that an inadequate response to modest dosage of either drug should lead to the use of an additional agent rather than heavier dosage.", 
    "59": "In 20 patients with acute myocardial infarction hemodynamic controls were performed after digitalisation and following i.v. injection of 0,4 mg of Prindolol. Circulatory changes were most pronounced 5-15 min after Prindolol injection and consisted of decrease in heart rate of 7%, mean arterial blood pressure of 6%, cardiac output of 10,5%, stroke volume index of 5,1% and left ventricular work of 18%. An increase of pulmonary wedge pressure of 17%, pulmonary pressure of 9%, mean right atrial pressure of 16% and peripheral arterial resistance of 6% were calculated. In 5 cases a favourable effect on extrasystoles and in 2 cases on sinus tachycardia were observed. Not infrequently, during the initial phase of acute myocardial infarction, a hyperadrenergic state may be noted. Prindolol may be indicated, when circulatory changes or arrhythmias are suspect to be the result of this hyperadrenergic stimulation. A simultaneous digitalisation may inhibit a more intensive cardiodepression.", 
    "60": "Sixty-three patients with stable, severe typical angina pectoris (New York Heart Association functional class III or IV) were treated with propranolol and studied prospectively with a follow-up period of 5 to 8 years to assess the rate of complications and long-term effectiveness after an initial control period. The patients' mean age was 56 years; the mean daily dose of propranolol was 255 mg. The average yearly mortality rate was 3.8 percent with a cumulative 5 year mortality rate of 19 percent. Patients whose reduction of angina with propranolol was less than 50 percent had a nearly four-fold greater mortality rate than those whose reduction was 50 percent or more (P less than 0.01). Thirty-two percent of patients per year were angina-free with propranolol and 84 percent per year had 50 percent or more reduction in anginal episodes. There was no evidence for tachyphylaxis. Heart failure developed in 25 percent of patients, two thirds of whom had either congestive heart failure with an acute infarction or a prior history of congestive heart failure. All patients whose initial cardiothoracic ratio was greater than 0.5 had heart failure during the first 3 years of propranolol therapy. Of 12 patients who had an acute infarction during therapy, 7 died, 6 with cardiogenic shock; in contrast, 8 of 9 patients who had congestive heart failure without acute infarction survived. Eight percent of patients had other significant side effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms (three patients), hallucinations (one) and postural hypotension (one). The occurrence of asthma in three patients was dose-related and did not require drug discontinuation. Propanolol is an effective form of long-term therapy for severe angina pectoris; it does not induce tachyphylaxis or increase the overall mortality rate, although it may increase the risk of cardiogenic shock in acute myocardial infarction. Previous history of congestive heart failure, a cardiothoracic ratio of more than 0.5 without overt heart failure and mild asthma are relative contraindications. A 50 percent or greater reduction in anginal pain with propranolol predicts a low mortality group.", 
    "61": "Blood flow and secretion from the submaxillary gland of the rat was recorded. Stimulation of the chordalingual nerve evoked vasodilatation which was little, it at all, decreased after administration of atropine. The secretion evoked on parasympathetic nerve stimulation was greatly reduced but not totally abolished by parasympatholytic agents. Stimulation of the cervical sympathetic trunk evoked secretion, which was mediated both via alpha and beta-adrenoceptors and vasoconstriction which was abolished by dihydroergotamine, and thus seemed to be mediated via alpha-adrenergic receptors. After alpha-adrenoceptor blockade vasodilatation was seen on sympathetic nerve stimulation. This was abolished by the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent propranolol.", 
    "62": "The effect of the beta-blocker, propranolol (40 mg 6-hourly orally) has been studied on the tachycardia of six patients with untreated thyrotoxicosis. Heart rate was monitored continuously using a light portable ECG recorder which allowed the patients to undertake normal activities during the recording periods. The most marked reduction in heart rate was evident at 24 h after starting propranolol treatment. In three of the patients there was only a minor further fall in heart rate despite continued propranolol administration, but in the remaining patients the reduction in heart rate with each successive day of treatment was more marked. These results suggest that if propranolol were to be used alone in the preparation of patients before partial thyroidectomy for thyrotoxicosis, a dose of 40 mg 6-hourly for 3-4 days might be sufficient.", 
    "63": "Varying ionic composition of outher medium and applying specific agents the role of fast and slow systems of entering currents in the accommodation of cats ventricular fibres has been studied. In potential region close to the level of resting potential (membrane depolarization no larger than 20-30mv), accomodation mainly depends on fast sodium currents. It is inhibited with a rise of this current (akonitin 0.1--1 mg) and, on the contrary, it increases when it gets weaker (novacain 2--5 mM). In the region of more positive potentials (membrane depolarization more than by 30 mv) the accommodation is mainly determined by the slow NA--Ca-systems of channels. The agents which strengthen NA--Ca--current (Si2+--5mM, Ca2+--10mM, Ba2+--0.1 mM) reduce the accommodation in the activation region of the Na--Ca--system. The agents which weaken the slow current (Mn2+--3 mM, isoptin--2+5 mg/l, inderal--2 mg/l) produce an opposite effect.", 
    "64": "Electrical activity, excitation threshold and \"steady--state\" current-voltage, relationship (estimated under voltage clamp conditions) in the membrane of chicken embryo atrial trabecula were investigated by means of double succrose-gap technique. Application of short (10 msec) electrical stimuli with magnitudes up to 6.10(-5) a (1-150 threshold) resulted in increased excitability and appearance of spontaneous activity. Release of neurotransmitters and polarity of the applied sitmulus are shown not to play a significant role in the changes in membrane excitability observed, the main cause of the latter being the increased sodium permeability of the membrane.", 
    "65": "The role of the vagi in the control of renin secretion was investigated in dogs maintained on a high-salt diet. Renal perfusion pressure was maintained relatively constant by the manipulation of a suprarenal aortic snare. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), plasma renin activity (PRA), and packed cell volume (PCV) increased after sinoaortic denervation and cervical vagotomy. Cooling of cervical vagi to 3-5 degrees C had the same effect as vagotomy. There was no change in MAP, PRA, and PCV in sham-operated animals. Propranolol prevented the increase in PRA following sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy, but not that in MAP or PCV. In splenectomized dogs, PCV still showed increases after sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy. It is suggested that the removal of sinoaortic and/or vagal inhibitory effects on the vasomotor center causes increases in sympathetic discharge to the adrenal medulla and the peripheral vessels, and that this in turn leads to the increase in MAP. The increase in sympathetic discharge to the adrenal medulla and the kidney causes the increases in PRA.", 
    "66": "Injection of bacterial endotoxin (Piromen) into unanesthetized rats elicited increases in shivering and nonshivering thermogenesis as well as in colonic temperature. In animals exposed to 24-25 degrees C, treatment with propranolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist) markedly diminished the pyrogen-induced increases in oxygen consumption (heat production) and colonic temperature with little change occurring in shivering activity. In contrast, in rats exposed to mild cold (17-18 degrees C), propranolol did not significantly alter the magnitude of the pyrogen-evoked thermogenesis. Rather in these animals, shivering tended to increase when nonshivering thermogenesis was blocked. These data are interpreted as reflecting differential effects of pyrogen on the pathways controlling the two modes of heat production in the rat.", 
    "67": "Effects of intravenous and intra-arterial norepinephrine (NE) and angiotensin II (AN) were compared in 18 conscious dogs instrumented with Doppler or electromagnetic flow probes on the iliac, mesenteric, and renal arteries, and catheters in the aorta and iliac arteries. NE and AN administered intravenously constricted the mesenteric and renal beds, and constricted the iliac bed when administered directly into the iliac artery. In contrast, intravenous NE and AN caused striking reflex increases in iliac flow and reductions in iliac resistance, respectively, in 12 of 18 dogs studied. The reflex iliac dilatation was not prevented by beta blockade with propranolol, cholinergic blockade with atropine, or prostaglandin synthetase inhibition with indomethacin. However, the responses were abolished by either phentolamine, 1 mg/kv iv, or after local blockade of the limb with either phentolamine, 0.5 mg/kg, or with tripelennamine, 2 mg/kg. The dilatation was not prevented by either bilateral carotid sinus and aortic nerve section or by bilateral vagotomy alone, but was prevented by a combination of these procedures. Thus, intravenous NE and AN cause striking reflex iliac dilatation in the limb in the conscious dog; the afferent arc of this reflex involves both arterial baroreceptor and vagal pathways, while the efferent mechanism involves an interaction of alpha-adrenergic and histaminergic receptors."
