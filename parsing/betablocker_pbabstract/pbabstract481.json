    "0": "Several so-called multiple-action compounds have been developed, such as medroxalol (alpha and beta blockade, and beta-2 stimulation), celiprolol (alpha-2 and beta-1 blockade, and beta-2 stimulation) and carvedilol (beta blockade and vasodilatation) for the treatment of patients with arterial hypertension and with coronary heart disease. Carvedilol exerts relatively uniform peripheral effects, i.e. a reduction of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise, and a decrease in the resting and exercise heart rate. Blood pressure fall due to carvedilol may be induced by its vasodilating effect, as documented by measurements of forearm blood flow and peripheral vascular resistance. Moreover, renal hemodynamics does not seem to be significantly altered by carvedilol. Carvedilol may also produce an improvement of the LV contractile status in patients with CHD and impaired LV function, mainly due to afterload reduction, in addition to its antianginal effect, which is due mainly to the beta-blocking properties of this substance. From the studies mentioned it may be concluded that carvedilol is a useful and promising drug for treating patients with both arterial hypertension and with coronary artery disease.", 
    "1": "The antihypertensive effect and safety of treatment of hypertension with isradipine, a Ca antagonist of dihydropyridine group in monotherapy and in combination with the betablocker bopindolol was assessed in a multicentre study joined by six Czechoslovak centres. When administered alone to 102 patients with essential hypertension stages I and II, isradipine was effective in 59%. Forty-one per cent of patients required combined therapy. The treatment led to a marked decrease in diastolic BP in smokers and non-smokers alike. A significant rise in ALP was observed during therapy in both therapeutic regimens. A significant decrease in cholesterolaemia was found in patients treated with the isradipine-bopindolol combination. No serious adverse effects were seen during three-month follow-up.", 
    "2": "In chronic experiment on dogs it has been established that the subcutaneous injection of equimolar doses of izadrine (nonselective beta-adrenergic agonist), alupent (moderately selective beta 2-adrenergic agonist) and salbutamol (predominantly beta 2-adrenergic agonist) suppresses the pentagastric secretion approximately in the same degree. The blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors by the anapriline intensifies the gastric secretion stimulated by pentagastrin. All investigated adrenoactive agents didn't effect the dogs' histamine gastric secretion. In healthy men the activation of beta 2-adrenergic receptors by alupent accompanied by the expressed intensification of basal, pentagastrin and submaximal histamine gastric secretion. The blockade of these receptors by anaprilin decreases the gastric secretion. It has been concluded that only beta 2-adrenoceptors take part in the gastric secretion regulation. Considerable specific differences in the reaction of gastric glands on the activation of beta-adrenoreceptors are revealed: in human beings it leads to the excitation, in dogs--to the suppression of secretory cells.", 
    "3": "The possibility of a pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interaction between epanolol and digoxin has been investigated in 10 healthy male subjects taking digoxin 0.375 mg daily for 14 days. During that period epanolol 200 mg daily or matching placebo was also given, each for 7 days, according to a double-blind, randomized cross-over plan. The plasma digoxin concentration-time profiles after 7 days of concomitant placebo or epanolol were comparable. Trough and peak plasma digoxin levels were similar (placebo: 0.84 and 2.62 ng.ml-1; epanolol: 0.87 and 2.46 ng.ml-1). The renal clearances of digoxin and creatinine were lower during treatment with epanolol, but the differences were not significant (placebo 142.0 and 126.5 ml.min-1; epanolol 105.7 and 109.3 ml.min-1). STI indexes were lower during treatment with digoxin plus epanolol, than after digoxin alone. The difference was significant for QS2I (513 versus 503 ms), PEPI (119 versus 112 ms) and PEP/LVET (0.286 versus 0.304). The observations suggest that in healthy volunteers there is no pharmacokinetic interaction between epanolol and digoxin, and that epanolol does not interfere with the positive inotropic action of digoxin.", 
    "4": "Twenty two pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension were treated with betaxolol (10-40 mg/day), a cardioselective beta adrenoceptor blocking agent. The analysis of the changes from the baseline confirmed the antihypertensive effect of the drug with a mean decrease in SBP of 11.8 mm Hg and in DBP of 8.3 mm Hg. A diastolic BP less than 90 mm Hg was obtained in 20 patients after the first day of therapy. Fetal safety, assessed by ultrasonography and cardiotocographic recording was excellent. The 22 mothers gave birth to 23 live born babies (one twin pregnancy). Mean Apgar scores were 8.3 and 9.1 at 1 and 5 min. Only 1 newborn had an Apgar score less than 7. Three newborns suffered from fetal distress and 1 from threat for causes not related to therapy. At 9 months follow-up, all 23 babies were in good health. These data suggest that betaxolol is effective in reducing maternal blood pressure without any deleterious effect on the foetus and the newborn.", 
    "5": "In the rat gastric fundus, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) contributes to the nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) inhibitory neurotransmission and coexists with its related peptide, peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI). As the two neuropeptides are co-released and have similar actions in different biological systems, the effect of PHI in the rat gastric fundus was studied in order to investigate whether it might be a co-transmitter of VIP in the inhibitory NANC neurotransmission in this tissue. Auxotonic responses were measured in longitudinal muscle strips from the gastric fundus of reserpinized rats (5 mg/kg i.p., 24 hr before sacrifice), suspended between parallel platinum electrodes in Krebs solution containing atropine (1 microM) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (3 microM). PHI induced concentration-dependent relaxations (10 nM-1 microM), qualitatively similar to those induced by electrical field stimulation (1 msec, supramaximal voltage, 0.25-16 Hz) and by VIP (0.3-100 nM), although PHI was about 30 times less potent than VIP. The submaximal relaxation induced by PHI (100 nM) was not influenced by tetrodotoxin (1 microM), hexamethonium (500 microM) and propranolol (10 microM) plus phentolamine (3 microM). Incubation during 60 min with a specific PHI-antiserum completely prevented the relaxation induced by PHI (100 nM) and reduced by 26% that induced by electrical field stimulation at 1 Hz; the procedure had no influence on the relaxation induced by VIP (3 nM) or isopropylnoradrenaline (10 nM). Incubation during 60 min with a specific VIP-antiserum completely prevented the relaxation induced by VIP (3 nM) and halved the relaxatory response to electrical field stimulation at 1 Hz, while it had no influence on the relaxation induced by PHI (100 nM) or isopropylnoradrenaline (10 nM). Control serum had no influence on any of the relaxant stimuli. In conclusion, PHI mimics the electrically induced NANC relaxation in the rat gastric fundus; its action is located at muscle level and does not involve alpha-, beta- or nicotinic receptors. The results obtained in the presence of the antisera provide further confirmation that VIP contributes to the NANC inhibitory neurotransmission of the rat gastric fundus and leave open the possibility that PHI is involved as co-transmitter.", 
    "6": "Among the adrenergic receptor agonists, epinephrine, at alpha and beta stimulating doses, remains the drug of choice for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, alpha adrenergic agonists such as phenylephrine, methoxamine and dopamine (at alpha stimulating doses) result in similar success rates of resuscitation as epinephrine. In the opposite, beta adrenergic agonists, without or with only low alpha stimulating effect, such as isoproterenol or dobutamine are significantly less efficient. There are few data indicating that sodium bicarbonate improves outcome. Moreover it carries the risk of adverse effects. It may be of benefit in case of preexisting metabolic acidosis or during prolonged resuscitation with documented acidosis. Calcium remains indicated in case of hypocalcaemia, hyperkalaemia or calcium channel blocker intoxication. Severe ionized hypocalcaemia can occur after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.", 
    "7": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on the dynamic response characteristics of oxygen uptake (VO2) was examined in seven healthy men. Cycle ergometer exercise consisted of a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) with 15 units per sequence, each unit lasting 15 s, for a total period of 225 s. Work rate was either 25 W or 125 W. Six identical sequences were performed continuously in a single exercise test. Each subject was studied on three occasions after 48 h treatment of placebo (CON); a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol (PROP); and a beta 1-selective blocker, metoprolol (MET). VO2 was measured breath-by-breath. The data were analyzed in the frequency domain by Fourier analysis to yield amplitude and phase shift coefficients for the relationship between the input work rate and output VO2. Time domain analysis was performed on the cross-correlational analysis of VO2 (output).work rate (input) to determine the total lag time. The amplitude of the VO2.W-1 relationship was lower (P less than 0.0022) and the phase shift was greater (P less than 0.0039) with beta-blockade compared to CON; no differences were found between PROP and MET. The total lag time was longer (P less than 0.0053) in PROP (34.3 +/- 2.2 s) and MET (34.4 +/- 1.6 s) compared to CON (29.8 +/- 1.3 s). These data indicate that beta-adrenergic blockade causes a significant slowing of kinetics of the O2 transport system as determined by both frequency and time domain analysis. In addition, the PRBS exercise test is a sensitive indicator of change in function of the O2 transport system.", 
    "8": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on torque output and leg blood flow was examined in seven healthy young men during repeated maximal isometric voluntary contractions of the triceps surae muscle group. Exercise was performed in either a bent- or straight-leg position during each of four drug treatments: placebo, propranolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol. Contractions were sustained for 5 s with 5 s relaxation for a total of 10 min followed by a 10-min recovery. Leg blood flow was measured during the 5 s relaxation separating contractions using strain gauge plethysmography. Torque output decreased during the 10-min contractions with no differences between the four drug treatments. Leg blood flow was lower with beta-blockade during the initial stages of exercise and recovery in the bent-leg position but no differences were observed after 3 min exercise or recovery. Leg blood flow in the straight-leg position was not different between any of the four drug treatments, but it was significantly less than in bent-leg exercise. The lower blood flows during the initial stages of exercise in the beta-blocked conditions probably reflect a slowing of the central cardiovascular response because of beta 1-receptor blockade of the heart rather than on the beta 2-receptors effects on peripheral vascular resistance. It is concluded that local vasodilator substances released from the working muscle may play a more important role than beta 2-receptor stimulation of smooth muscle in skeletal muscle resistance vessels in regulating local muscle blood flow during maximal exercise of the triceps surae muscle group.", 
    "9": "He-Ne laser therapy included in complex of therapeutic methods for patients with unstable angina pectoris is a highly effective treatment modality; it helps essentially reduce the risk of acute myocardial infarction in these patients. Clinical efficacy of laser therapy is confirmed by its favorable action on hemostasis plasma factors, consisting in reduction of fibrinogen level, normalization of antithrombin-III (AT-III), decrease of the level of soluble fibrinomonomer complexes, this indicating a lowering of the blood coagulation potential. Absence of significant changes in plasminogen level may be an indicator of the nonenzymic route of fibrinogen system activation. Sessions of intravenous laser therapy should be administered 2-3 times a week to unstable angina pectoris patients with low AT-III levels, whereas for patients with initially high or normal AT-III levels combined laser therapy is advisable (4-5 daily invasive procedures and 6-8 skin surface ones on the Zakharyin-Head's zones). Measurements of endogenic anticoagulants is an effective means for monitoring laser therapy in this patient population.", 
    "10": "Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, blocks the formation of the cleavage furrow, while karyokinesis is unaffected during first division in the sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus or Lytechinus pictus. This effect is reversed by adrenalin, indicating that it is mediated by an adrenergic mechanism. The staining of F-actin microfilaments by rhodamine phalloidin in eggs in which the cleavage is blocked by the drug has revealed that propranolol affects both the distribution and the organization of actin microfilaments. A low-voltage scanning electron microscopy (LVSEM) study of microvilli in these eggs shows an extensive rearrangement of the egg surface. Anti-tubulin immunofluorescence microscopy of eggs treated with propranolol shows that they form normal mitotic asters. This indicates that while cleavage is affected, mitotic spindle formation is not. These results suggest that neurotransmitter monoamines known to be present in the sea urchin egg might be involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton underlying the formation of the cleavage furrow.", 
    "11": "Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (BB) demonstrate a competitive antagonism with endogenous catecholamines. Beta-1 receptor blockade mediates the depressive action on contractility, heart rate and atrio-ventricular conduction. Beta-2 receptor blockade mediates vascular, bronchial and uterine smooth muscle constriction. BB with beta-1 selective and intrinsec sympathomimetic activity do not increase systemic vascular resistance. BB are mostly used to treat ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and arrhythmias. Bradycardia, hypotension and bronchospasm are the main hazards in BB treated patients undergoing anaesthesia. However giving BB with premedication to patients taking usely this treatment allows better perioperative haemodynamic stability and avoids rebound effect. Experimentally, oxprenolol reverses regional dysfunction in ischaemic myocardium under halothane anaesthesia. During and after anaesthesia, intravenous (i.v.) BB must be used with caution to treat hypertension associated with tachycardia. In controlled hypotension, i.v. BB potentialise other agents. In phaechromocytoma surgery, alpha-blocking drugs are essential but additional BB can control tachycardia successfully. In coronary artery bypass surgery, giving BB prior to induction decreases cardiac enzymes serum levels. Esmolol, a new ultra-short-acting BB, would control perioperative tachycardia and hypertension without risk of prolonged cardiac depression.", 
    "12": "Bupivacaine is known to impair the electrophysiology of the heart as well as haemodynamic parameters. Administration of calcium channel blockers prior to bupivacaine enhances its cardiotoxicity. This study assessed the effects of bupivacaine at toxic dose in dogs with previous beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. It included 12 dogs anaesthetized with thiopentone, allocated in a control group (n = 6) receiving a bolus of bupivacaine (4 mg.kg-1) and a study group (n = 6) treated with the sequence propranolol (0.2 mg.kg-1) and bupivacaine (4 mg.kg-1), 15 min later. Infranodal conduction (HV conduction times and QRS durations) was worsened in both groups. Previous propranolol administration had no potentiating effects on these parameters. Conversely the latter was responsible of a greater decrease in heart rate, and increase in atrio-ventricular conduction time (77.9% vs 18.7%, p less than 0.05), as well as a more severe hypotension. Moreover, 3 out of the 6 animals in the study group suffered a cardiac arrest between the 5th and the 10th min. It is concluded that in anaesthetized dogs the cardiac and circulatory effects of a toxic dose of bupivacaine are increased in case of preexisting blockade of beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "13": "The systemic injection of diazepam (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg), indorenate (5 and 10 mg/kg) and ipsapirone (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) reduced anxiety as tested in an exploratory avoidance model in mice. The injection of pindolol (2.0 mg/kg), alprenolol (5.0 mg/kg) or methiotepin (0.25 mg/kg) effectively prevented the anxiolytic action of indorenate and ipsapirone. The combined treatment of the antagonists with indorenate or ipsapirone did not reduce the motor activity, therefore suggesting that the inhibition of exploratory behaviour, after such combinations, was not mediated through a general motor impairment. Neither diazepam nor indorenate alone modified the motor activity; ipsapirone (5 and 2.5 mg/kg), however, reduced ambulation. This reduction was also prevented by administering pindolol, alprenolol or methiotepin. These observations suggest that the anxiolytic actions of indorenate and ipsapirone are mediated via stimulation of the 5-HT1A like receptor subtype.", 
    "14": "Heart rate fluctuations (HRF) were investigated in 18 adult female rabbits (Weisses Grosssilber) in chronical experiments at rest, during motor activity, passive and active avoidance. Pharmacological blockades of the neurovegetative transmission were used to determine the characteristics of neurovegetative mediation during the behavioural states examined. Mean heart rate was always increased during vagal blockade and decreased during beta-adrenergic blockade. At rest the HRF in rabbits are mainly vagally mediated. Vagal blockade reduced the overall heart rate variability by more than 50%. Vagal blockade did not abolish respiratory heart rate fluctuations. If the mean respiratory frequency is greater than half of the mean heart rate frequently occurring in rabbits, the respiratory HRF are generated not synchronously with respiration but in a slower frequency range according to the physiologic effect of \"cardiac aliasing\". The movement related heart rate increase was absent if the movements were performed during combined beta adrenergic and vagal blockade. The heart rate reaction during passive avoidance was characterized by a heart rate deceleration abolished by vagal blockade. Respiratory HR were increased. Furthermore, the heart rate was returned to the previous mean level and the slow HRF not induced by respiration increased, mediated by beta adrenergic activation. Vagal blockade and beta adrenergic blockade diminished the heart rate acceleration and reduced the overall heart rate variability by more than 50% during active avoidance. Combined vagal and beta-adrenergic blockade fully abolished the heart rate acceleration effect during active avoidance. The ratio of the vagal to sympathetic reaction components differed in behavioural types.", 
    "15": "The hemodynamic effects of short-term infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were observed in sheep with combined alpha/beta adrenoceptor pharmacological blockade. The effect of ANF on the sympathetically-mediated baroreflex system was observed in conscious sheep in which aortic and vena caval balloon occluders had been surgically implanted. ANF infused at 100 micrograms/h for 60 min produced similar effects on blood pressure, cardiac output and stroke volume during alpha/beta-adrenoceptor blockade, compared to the responses seen in normal sheep, however the increases in heart rate and total peripheral resistance were reduced. ANF markedly enhanced the gain of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex in the sheep. This effect may mediate the large increase in heart rate which is associated with a small fall in blood pressure during short-term infusion of ANF. In conclusion, the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in regulating the reflex cardiovascular responses to short-term infusion of ANF in sheep. The large species variation in the hemodynamic responses to ANF may be related to differing degrees of stimulation or inhibition of the baroreceptor system to affect heart rate and/or peripheral resistance.", 
    "16": "Unstable angina is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased rate and severity of angina pectoris attacks and, sometimes but not always, accompanied by ECG changes similar to those seen in coronary insufficiency. According to the present conception of the pathogenesis, ruptures at points of high-grade stenosis in the epicardial coronary arteries with simultaneous apposition of thrombi and vasoconstriction cause critical narrowing of the vascular lumen, which means that with the same level of oxygen consumption, coronary blood flow might be inadequate even at rest. In this way the development of severe ischemia, sudden cardiac death or myocardial infarction is programmed. Therapy must accordingly aim at avoiding or eliminating the progression of thrombosis and at increasing the reduced coronary blood flow. The prognosis is unequivocally improved by aspirin. In addition, heparin, 400 units/kg body weight, should be given. Thrombolysis may be possible after mechanical recanalization, depending on the individual results of coronary angiography. Providing the adverse reactions are monitored, nitroglycerin given intravenously is the basic drug therapy, although comparative studies against other drugs are not available and some data show the development of tolerance during prolonged use. Therefore, an early change to sustained-release nitrates or mononitrates can be justified. beta-receptor blockers reduce the frequency of silent ischemia and of myocardial infarction. By these means, in 80% of the patients affected, unstable angina will be converted to the stable form of the disease. If symptoms persist coronary angiography is urgently indicated, to allow the selection of PTCA or aortocoronary bypass surgery according to the findings.", 
    "17": "Imdur contains isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) in a controlled-release (Durules) formulation. It has a significant anti-anginal effect when taken once daily at a dose of 60 mg. This anti-anginal effect persists during long-term treatment without the development of tolerance; once-daily treatment produces a plasma nitrate profile that is high enough to give anti-anginal protection during the daytime, but low enough during the latter part of the dosage interval to avoid the development of tolerance. Evidence shows that once-daily Imdur is equivalent in efficacy to plain tablets of IS-5-MN and isosorbide dinitrate taken three times daily at the same total daily dosage (60 mg), and to the calcium antagonist diltiazem (60 mg three times daily). In addition, the anti-anginal protection provided by Imdur in combination with beta-blocker treatment is superior to that achieved with beta-blocker treatment alone. In long-term studies Imdur has been shown to be well tolerated.", 
    "18": "Current concepts and future aspects of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of coronary heart disease have been compiled. Especially new insights in the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease e.g. the dynamic pathology of coronary atherosclerosis, possible role of endothelin in vasospasm, as well as new pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic aspects of organic nitrates are discussed. Also the role of sympathetic nervous system as a pivotal question in pathophysiology and clinical pharmacology in the treatment of angina pectoris has been considered.", 
    "19": "1. The effects of isoprenaline, noradrenaline and fenoterol on the electrically evoked release of [3H]-acetylcholine from the rat phrenic nerve were investigated. 2. Isoprenaline (0.1 mumol/L) and noradrenaline (1 mumol/L) enhanced evoked [3H]-acetylcholine release by about 90%, an effect which was abolished by CGP 20712A (0.1 mumol/L), a specific antagonist at beta 1-adrenoceptors. Noradrenaline still enhanced [3H]-acetylcholine release in the presence of phentolamine (1 mumol/L). 3. The enhancing effect of both isoprenaline and noradrenaline decreased at prolonged exposure times (24-32 min). A pre-exposure of the tissue to a low concentration (0.01 mumol/L) of isoprenaline prevented the enhancing effect of 0.1 mumol/L isoprenaline. 4. Fenoterol, a specific agonist at beta 2-adrenoceptors, did not modify evoked [3H]-acetylcholine release. 5. The present results indicate the existence of facilitatory beta 1-adrenoceptors on the motor nerve. These receptors appear to be desensitized either by a high concentration of, or by a long exposure to, agonists. Under the present conditions noradrenaline enhances the release of newly synthesized transmitter mainly by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "20": "The role of alpha-adrenoceptors in asthma is still unclear. However, several studies have shown bronchodilatation after single doses of different alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists in patient's with asthma. The clinical efficacy of midaglizole, a new selective alpha 2 blocker was demonstrated by a more recent investigation. The present investigation was carried out to examine the effects of midaglizole on isolated airway smooth muscle obtained from humans and guinea pigs. Human bronchial smooth muscle was relaxed in a dose-dependent manner by midaglizole. EC50, molar concentration of midaglizole required to produce 50% reversal of carbachol-induced pre-contraction was (6.0 +/- 0.19) X 10(-5) M. Isoproterenol (5 X 10(-10) M) and midaglizole (3 X 10(-5) M) produced 30.0 +/- 9.5% and 40.8 +/- 7.0% of maximal relaxation, respectively. However, they produced almost 100% of maximal relaxation when used together. Isoproterenol, in combination with midaglizole, was associated with a significant increase of human bronchial relaxation as compared to either of the drugs singly. The same findings were obtained when the drugs were used on the guinea pig trachea. Midaglizole had no effect on the binding of the radiolabeled beta adrenergic antagonist [3H] dihydroalprenolol to particulates prepared from the lung. Propranolol did not inhibit the relaxant effect of midaglizole on airway smooth muscle. These results suggest that midaglizole may be effective for the treatment of asthma.", 
    "21": "The authors examined the effect of beta-blocker monotherapy (Tobanum tab = 5 mg cloranololum hydrochloricum) and beta-blocker + diuretic (Tobanum + Furosemide) combination therapy on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in response to oral glucose doses in hypertensive non-diabetic patients. Twenty-six patients were examined (13 men, 13 women). The patients were followed up for 28 weeks after a 2-week drug-free period. The hypotensive dose was adjusted individually within 4 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance test and immuno-reactive insulin determination were performed concurrently before starting hypotensive therapy and on weeks 6, 14, and 28 of therapy. The results of the examinations were evaluated separately in two patient groups. Fifteen patients were given daily 10-20 mg Tobanum (Group I) while 11 patients received daily 10-20 mg Tobanum + 40-80 mg Furosemide (Group II). The glucose area of patients on Tobanum monotherapy did not change, insulin secretion decreased gradually (from 804 to 495 pmol/l). The decrease was significant (p less than 0.05). The glucose area of Tobanum + Furosemide-treated patients increased from 13.2 +/- 3.2 mmol/l to 16.1 + 4.9, the insulin secretion decreased from 1039 + 339 to 706 + 411 pmol/l during therapy (p less than 0.02 and p less than 0.05, resp.). When evaluating the results the decrease of insulin secretion is attributed to Tobanum effect while the deterioration of glucose tolerance may be correlated to the action of Furosemide on extrapancreatic metabolism.", 
    "22": "The effect of a non selective and a cardio-selective beta-blocker on basal and exercise-stimulated plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations in healthy volunteers has been studied. Nine healthy volunteers received single oral doses of 5 mg tertatolol, 100 mg atenolol or placebo, at one week intervals, in a double blind cross over trial. At rest plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone and cyclic GMP concentrations and plasma renin activity were not modified by the treatments. During exercise plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations were significantly increased by each treatment, the increment being significantly greater on beta-blockers than on placebo. The rise in atrial natriuretic peptide was 72% after placebo (from 24 to 42 pg/ml), 184% after atenolol (from 30 to 86 pg/ml), and 183% after tertatolol (from 34 to 95 pg/ml), respectively. Thus, the study has shown that in healthy subjects the plasma natriuretic peptide concentration is increased by exercise and that the increase is considerably and equally potentiated by selective and non selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The effect may be mainly due to a reduction in ventricular contractility with an increase in atrial pressure. The beta-blockers did not influence the resting plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels, which suggests that in healthy subjects basal atrial natriuretic peptide secretion is not controlled via beta-receptors.", 
    "23": "The preventive effects of carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on secondary lesions were pathophysiologically examined in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) from 8 to 30 weeks of age. Carteolol was added to the drinking water in doses of 0.005% (8 to 18 weeks of age) to 0.01% (19 to 30 weeks of age) (3.8 and 6.0 mg/kg/d, respectively). These animals gained significantly more weight than the untreated control SHRSP, and their heart rate reduced from 14 weeks of age. Suppression of blood pressure rise was not definite, however, histology revealed prevention of the development or aggravation of secondary hypertension-related lesions, such as myocardial fibrosis, proliferative arteriolitis, necrotic arteriolitis and renal glomerular lesions. A decrease in non-esterified fatty acids in the serum was evident. Thus, carteolol has cardiac as well as renal protective effects, in the SHRSP.", 
    "24": "1. The beta-adrenomimetic and beta-adrenolytic activities of S(-) and R(+) isomers of carteolol, a beta-adrenergic partial agonist (a beta-adrenoceptor blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic action) were tested in the guinea-pig taenia caecum. 2. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking activities (pA2 values) of S(-) and R(+) isomers of carteolol were significantly larger than the corresponding beta-adrenomimetic activities (pD2 values), supporting our views that beta-adrenoceptors contain two different binding sites; high and low affinity sites. 3. In beta-adrenoceptor blocking action S(-) carteolol was about 10 times as potent as R(+) carteolol while beta-adrenomimetic action of S(-) carteolol was about 2 times as potent as that of R(+) carteolol. Further, intrinsic activity for S(-) carteolol was slightly but significantly larger than that for R(+) carteolol. 4. These results suggest that the binding site for competitive antagonism between S(-) isoprenaline and S(-), R(+) and RS(+/-) carteolol is more stereoselective than the binding site to induce beta-adrenomimetic action.", 
    "25": "1. Effects of temperatures (0, 10 and 32 degrees C) on the bindings of beta-adrenergic partial agonists, befunolol and carteolol, with beta-adrenoceptors were studied using the microsomal fractions from the guinea-pig taenia caecum. 2. The affinities of befunolol and carteolol to the low affinity binding site were higher at low temperatures, whereas those to the high affinity binding site were not influenced by change in temperature. 3. The interactions of the low affinity binding site with befunolol and carteolol decreased both enthalpy and entropy. The interactions of both the drugs with the high affinity binding site increased only entropy. 4. These results support our view that beta-adrenoceptors contain two different affinity binding sites and that the interactions of beta-adrenergic partial agonists with the low affinity binding site induce the beta-adrenomimetic action, whereas the competitive antagonism by the beta-partial agonists and beta-adrenoceptor blockers is due to their ability to compete with beta-stimulant for the high affinity binding site.", 
    "26": "The pharmacokinetics and beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects of conventional and sustained-release metipranolol have been studied in 6 healthy male volunteers given a single oral dose of 40 mg. Plasma drug concentrations determined by TLC and a radioreceptor assay, and the inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia, were monitored for 48 h. Relevant amounts of active metabolites other than deacetylmetipranolol were not found. Compared to conventionally formulated metipranolol, the controlled-release product had a prolonged mean residence time (10.7 vs 5.5 h), the peak drug concentration was halved and the time to peak drug concentrations was delayed. Relatively constant plasma concentrations (cideal = 6.5 ng/ml) and a clinically significant reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia were maintained throughout a 24 h dosing interval. An individual deacetylmetipranolol plasma concentration-effect relationship was evaluated using the Emax model. Mean parameters were Emax 26% and C50 2.9 ng/ml.", 
    "27": "The time course of regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and changes in left ventricular function were followed in 52 middle-aged hypertensive patients divided into two groups: 30 treated with betablockers and 22 with methyldopa. In case of inadequate blood pressure control, diuretics and/or vasodilators were added in both groups. Blood pressure decreased significantly over a three-year follow-up period. The decrease was most pronounced during the first three months. The biggest decrease in posterior wall and interventricular septum thickness was detected by echocardiography also within the first three months. While complete regression of posterior wall hypertrophy was noted within the next three months, interventricular septum thickness decreased steadily over a period of two years. No significant change was seen in the septum in the third year of follow-up. Complete regression of hypertrophy was found in 30 (57.7%) of probands, with no change altogether observed in as few as two patients. Regression was incomplete in 20 (38.4%) obese patients with manifest hypertrophy at the start of the study. Regression of hypertrophy was not associated with left ventricular function deterioration and was observed even after vasodilator administration. There were no differences between the two groups of patients.", 
    "28": "The usefulness and limitations of the current medical treatment of high blood pressure are analysed. The latest strategies in the management of hypertension are presented, with emphasis on the treatment of all associated cardiovascular risk factors. This is and important therapeutic goal of Preventive Cardiology. The individualized treatment, that is to say, the selection of the antihypertensive therapy according to the characteristics of each patient, is discussed as an objective of the present therapy. Finally, the new drugs and the recent advances in the classic ones are examined with a special focus on their hemodynamic actions and on their role in left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "29": "To study vascular responses and to choose a differential therapy, 51 patients with hypertensive disease underwent a pressor test combined with intravenous epinephrine. The test revealed two types of blood pressure control. In type I responses (normotensive responses), there was a good antihypertensive effect shown by beta-adrenoblockers and/or a course of physical trainings. In type II (hypertensive responses), alpha-adrenoblockers and diuretics proved to be more effective. A relationship was found between the type of responses and the activity of the renin-aldosterone system.", 
    "30": "The purpose of this prospective study was to compare two methods of evaluating antihypertensive treatment efficacy: the traditional sphygmomanometric method and automatic home recording. Thirty hypertensive patients were studied who had been on antihypertensive therapy for at least 3 months. In the first 3 weeks of study their therapy was left unchanged and their diastolic blood pressures, measured with the traditional sphygmomanometer (weekly morning visit in the outpatient clinic; three successive recordings at 5-min intervals; subject seated), were always higher than 95 mmHg. During the following 8 weeks, the physician tried to reduce diastolic blood pressure to not greater than 90 mmHg by changing or increasing the therapy. Before and after any modification in therapy, noninvasive, automatic home, blood pressure monitorings for 24 hours were obtained and analyzed with Halberg's method of single cosinor, but were not made available to the physician until the end of the study. Automatic recordings showed that 18 patients had already had a circadian diastolic mesor less than or equal to 90 mmHg under the original drug regimen. By changing or increasing the therapy, no additional pressure decrease was seen in the home pressure recordings of the whole group of patients, whereas the sphygmomanometric diastolic pressures of 15 patients fell under 90 mmHg. Our study provides additional evidence that casual sphygmomanometric measurements can be misleading when one tries to assess the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy, and a cause of potential overtreatment.", 
    "31": "1. Binding and quantitative autoradiography were used to detect [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (I-CYP) associated with beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in mouse tracheal epithelium and airway smooth muscle as well as in lung parenchymal tissue. 2. Specific I-CYP binding to slide-mounted tissue sections of both trachea and parenchyma was of high affinity (KD = 49.0 pM, n = 3, trachea; KD = 118.9 pM, n = 3, parenchyma) and saturable, involving single populations of non-interacting binding sites (Hill coefficient nH = 1.00 +/- 0.02, trachea; nH = 0.99 +/- 0.03, parenchyma). 3. Direct measurement of tissue radioactivity also showed that specific I-CYP binding was competitively inhibited in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (-)-propranolol (non-selective), CGP 20712A (beta 1-selective) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective). Analysis of the competition binding curves for the two selective antagonists revealed mixed populations of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the approximate proportions 33% and 67% respectively in mouse trachea and 28% and 72% respectively in mouse lung parenchyma. 4. Densities of autoradiographic grains derived from specific I-CYP binding to alveolar wall tissue and to tracheal epithelium and airway smooth muscle were quantified by a computer-assisted image analysis system, which allowed the construction of competition binding curves in the presence of the selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists CGP 20712A and ICI 118,551. Analysis of these data demonstrated that in alveolar wall, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors co-existed in the proportions 18% and 82%, respectively. 5. Quantitative autoradiographic analyses also showed that beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were differentially distributed in tracheal epithelium and airway smooth muscle. The beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype accounted for 71% of all beta-adrenoceptors in epithelium. Conversely, beta l-adrenoceptors which mediate relaxant responses of mouse trachea to beta,-adrenoceptor agonists (Henry & Goldie, 1990), accounted for 69% of all beta-adrenoceptors in the airway smooth muscle.", 
    "32": "More and more patients with coronary heart disease (CAD) are admitted to intensive care units. The drugs used to treat these patients have various effects on the myocardium which must be known in order to avoid worsening the CAD. This review examines the metabolic effects on the myocardium of the most commonly used drugs in intensive care. The physiology of myocardial oxygen supply is first recalled with regard to the coronary circulation, myocardial oxygen extraction and consumption. Digitalis glycosides do not affect the coronary circulation, but the decrease myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with heart failure, mainly by lowering heart rate. Dihydropyridine calcium blockers (nifedipine, nicardipine) increase coronary blood flow, despite a decrease in arterial blood pressure. Their effects on myocardial oxygen consumption are mediated by a sympathetic reflex. Verapamil decreases the heart rate and myocardial inotropism, and is responsible for coronary vasodilation. The result is a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. Diltiazem and bepridil have almost similar effects: they decrease myocardial oxygen consumption and increase blood supply to the heart. It has been recently shown that verapamil was the most depressant calcium channel blocking agent, and that it resulted in the most important decrease in myocardial metabolism. Beta-blocking agents decrease myocardial metabolism, except those with an important intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, such as pindolol. Amiodarone can be considered as an alpha and beta blocking drug: its main effect is to counteract the effects of endogenous catecholamines on myocardial metabolism. The sympathomimetic amines (noradrenaline, adrenaline, isoprenaline, dopamine, dobutamine) increase, to different extents, myocardial oxygen consumption. Vasodilators, such as the nitrates or sodium nitroprusside, decrease cardiac filling pressures, and increase myocardial blood flow, thus lowering myocardial oxygen consumption. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (amrinone, enoximone) have both an inotropic and a vasodilating effect. They decrease cardiac afterload, and increase blood supply to the myocardium; this compensates for the increase in myocardial oxygen consumption due to the increase in myocardial contractility. Because all the drugs used in intensive care have different effects on myocardial metabolism, their reasoned use should avoid an inappropriate increase in oxygen demand.", 
    "33": "In the pithed rat we investigated the cardiovascular properties of d,l-nebivolol and its enantiomers. We used the increase in heart rate elicited by (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline as a model for studying beta 1-adrenoceptors. A leftward shift of the logarithmic dose-pressor response curve of (-)-adrenaline reflects beta 2-adrenoceptor-blocking properties. The blood pressure responses of methoxamine, B-HT 920 and serotonin (5-HT) were studied in order to test whether d,l-nebivolol has alpha 1-, alpha 2- and 5-HT2-receptor-blocking properties. Furthermore, the interaction of d,l-nebivolol with the peripheral sympathetic neurotransmission was investigated in pithed rats by electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. d,l-Nebivolol and d-nebivolol (threshold concentration 10(-8) mol/kg) were demonstrated to be selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists. l-Nebivolol was a factor of 1,000 less potent as beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker. Up to a dose of 10(-5) mol/kg, d,l-nebivolol appeared to have neither alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta 2-, 5-HT2-, angiotensin II-receptor antagonistic, calcium entry blocking, converting enzyme inhibiting nor direct vasodilating properties and did not interact with the sympathetic neurotransmission in the vascular wall. An explanation for an antihypertensive effect independent of beta-adrenoceptor blockade as found in spontaneously hypertensive rats and man could not be found in this model, therefore we suggest that this blood-pressure-lowering effect does not originate from conventional peripheral mechanisms.", 
    "34": "The efficacy of bopindolol and atenolol in the treatment of patients with chronic stable angina pectoris have been compared in a double blind, randomized study. Both bopindolol 1 mg and atenolol 100 mg for 6 weeks increased mean exercise time (25% and 22%, respectively, compared to placebo), time to angina (27% and 25%), and time to 1 mm of ST-segment depression (32% and 20%). Both drugs reduced ST-segment depression similarly at maximal and submaximal work levels. There was no significant difference in their antianginal efficacy.", 
    "35": "We have compared the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol, a new cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, with atenolol in a randomized double-blind crossover study in 12 patients (mean age 53.5 y) with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a two week placebo wash-out period without any antihypertensive therapy, the patients were given bisoprolol 10 mg daily or atenolol 50 mg daily, increasing to 20 mg or 100 mg respectively if the sitting diastolic blood pressure did not fall below 90 mm Hg after two weeks of therapy. Crossover occurred after six weeks of active therapy followed by two weeks of placebo wash-out. After 6 weeks of therapy both drugs significantly reduced sitting and standing diastolic blood pressures (bisoprolol by 15% and 16% respectively, atenolol by 11% in both cases). However, while sitting and standing systolic pressures were significantly reduced by bisoprolol (13% and 16% respectively), only standing systolic pressures were significantly reduced by atenolol (11%), and this reduction was significantly less than with bisoprolol (p less than 0.05). Both drugs similarly reduced mean sitting and standing heart rates. There were no significant differences between the single-dose and steady-state kinetics of either bisoprolol or atenolol. The mean plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) increased from 12.9 to 13.2 h during steady state on bisoprolol and from 7.2 to 11.5 h on atenolol. The apparent volume of distribution (Vz) was greater for bisoprolol than for atenolol after single dosing (235 1 vs 146 1) and at steady state (216 1 vs 137 1), but clearances were similar for both drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "The regulatory effects of pindolol and celiprolol on cardiac beta-adrenoceptor density were studied in vivo in order to assess the subtype selectivity of their partial agonistic activity (PAA). The substances were continuously administered to rats for 1 week by means of implanted osmotic minipumps. The density of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes were estimated from ICYP saturation binding experiments performed on cardiac ventricular plasma membranes in the presence of a highly selective antagonist (CGP 20172 A or ICI 118,551). Both antagonists were employed at concentrations as high as to block one subtype only without affecting the complementary subtype. For control purposes, rats were also treated with isoprenaline (0.4 mg/kg/h) and propranolol (0.15 mg/kg/h), or vehicle. Pindolol (0.036 mg/kg/h) and celiprolol (0.36 mg/kg/h) reduced the density of ventricular beta 2-adrenoceptors by 46% and 23%, respectively, which--in the case of pindolol--was significant when compared to the non-treated controls. Both compounds, however, produced a small, but distinct increase in the number of beta 1-adrenoceptors by approximately 26%. This finding is in contrast to the propranolol--induced up-regulation of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors by approximately 80%. Since supramaximal doses of each drug were administered, a significant smaller increase of beta 1-adrenoceptors by pindolol and celiprolol--as compared to the increase produced by propranolol--can be interpreted as evidence for a PAA of pindolol and celiprolol on beta 1-adrenoceptors as well. Isoprenaline as a full agonist caused a marked loss of of both beta-adrenoceptor subtypes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "In rat gastric fundus preparations with tone raised by the addition of barium chloride or carbachol, and in the presence of propranolol (2 microM) to prevent beta-adrenoceptor mediated effects, the adrenoceptor agonists noradrenaline, adrenaline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline, isoprenaline, cirazoline and phenylephrine all caused concentration-related relaxant responses. Relaxations to the catecholamines were poorly antagonized by prazosin (0.01-1 microM) resulting in the slopes of Schild plots being less than unity, low pA2 values for prazosin against the catecholamines and a clear relaxant effect of the catecholamines even in the presence of 1 microM prazosin. The prazosin-resistant relaxations were unaffected by higher concentrations of prazosin (2 microM) and propranolol (30 microM) or by further additions of idazoxan (1 microM) or haloperidol (30 microM). The relaxations were not due to a non-specific effect of the catechol nucleus since neither dihydroxyphenylethylene glycol (DOPEG) nor dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) produced relaxant effects at concentrations up to 300 microM. In contrast to the results with the catecholamines, prazosin was a potent antagonist of the relaxant effect of cirazoline and phenylephrine, although the antagonism was difficult to quantify due to a lowering of the slope of the concentration response curves to cirazoline and phenylephrine with the higher concentrations of prazosin (0.1 and 1.0 microM). In conclusion postjunctional relaxatory effects of catecholamines in the rat gastric fundus are mediated partly via alpha 1-adrenoceptors and partly via an atypical adrenoceptor.", 
    "38": "The major finding of this analysis is that acute anti-migraine agents (e.g., ergots, sumatriptan) share high affinity for 5-HT1D receptors. This receptor appears to be present in certain intracranial blood vessels. It is also found on nerve terminals where it inhibits the release of 5-HT and other neurotransmitters. Theoretically, 5-HT1D receptor agonists may acutely inhibit the release of vasoactive and/or pain-inducing substances in the perivascular space. Conceivably, drugs acting at this receptor would stop the progression of this perivascular process. In contrast, a number of prophylactic anti-migraine drugs share a relatively high affinity for 5-HT2 receptors in human brain. Although this receptor is also found in certain blood vessels, it is present throughout the nervous system. The receptor appears to mediate neuronal depolarizations at the cellular level. No hypothesis, at present, readily explains the effectiveness of prophylactic anti-migraine drugs based on this receptor. These data offer a novel approach to the analysis of anti-migraine agents. Drugs could be selected for use in clinical migraine studies based on their selectivity for a specific 5-HT receptor subtype. \"Pure\" drugs could be chosen which would essentially limit the number of possible sites of action for the drugs. For example, an agent which displays both high affinity and selectivity for 5-HT1D receptors could be clinically evaluated. Its effectiveness, or lack thereof, would indicate the importance of the specific 5-HT receptor site in the pathogenesis of migraine. Further attempts to determine a common mechanism of action for effective anti-migraine agents should facilitate the elucidation of the pathogenesis of this neurological syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Noradrenaline (NA) has been implicated as a neuromodulator in plasticity, presumably facilitating adaptive processes. Recent experiments by others have suggested a modulatory role of NA in adaptive changes in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). These experiments showed that general depletion of brain NA resulted in a decreased ability to produce adaptive changes in the VOR gain. In order to identify the specific brain region responsible for these effects, as well as the nature of the adrenoceptors involved, we injected beta-adrenergic substances bilaterally into the flocculus of rabbits. The flocculus is known to receive noradrenergic afferents and, moreover, ablation of the flocculus interferes strongly with the normal adaptive changes in the VOR gain. We injected the beta-agonist isoproterenol and the beta-antagonist sotalol, and compared the adaptive capacity of the rabbits after these injections to that in a situation without injection. The rabbit was oscillated in a direction opposite to the direction of motion of the platform on which the rabbit was mounted, a condition which normally results in an increase in the VOR gain, measured either in light or in darkness. Injection of the beta-agonist did not greatly affect the adaptation of the VOR measured in the light. In darkness, the increase in gain after the injection of isoproterenol was larger than in the non-injection experiments in 9 out of 10 rabbits. The beta-antagonist sotalol reduced the adaptation of the VOR gain significantly in the light, as well as in darkness. In a control condition without pressure for adaptation (only intermittent testing of the VOR gain over a period of 2.5 h), the gain of the VOR either remained unaffected or was only slightly affected by similar injections of beta-adrenergic agents in individual rabbits. For the group as a whole, these effects were insignificant. We conclude from these results that noradrenergic systems facilitate the adaptation of the VOR gain to retinal slip in rabbits, without affecting the VOR gain directly. At least part of this influence is exerted through beta-receptors located in the cerebellar flocculus.", 
    "40": "The effect of exaprolol and sodium salicylate on hemolysis of erythrocytes was studied in dependence on the age of rats. Rats of the Wistar strain were used in the experiment in six different age groups. Exaprolol concentration was in the range from 0.24 to 0.48 mmol.l-1. Sodium salicylate was used in the concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 5 mmol.l-1. The effect of sodium salicylate on exaprolol induced hemolysis depended on the concentration of the two drugs and on the age of the animals. Significant changes were recorded at the concentrations of 1 and 5 mmol.l-1 of sodium salicylate. In 48- and 72-week-old rats sodium salicylate stabilized the erythrocyte membrane, whereas in 3-week-old rats increased decomposition was observed. The differences in the membrane labilizing effect of exaprolol and the membrane stabilizing effect of sodium salicylate, which were found to be age dependent, are presumably determined by qualitative changes in the structure of the erythrocyte membrane occurring in the course of postnatal development.", 
    "41": "The postnatal development of heart rate was compared in rats from average litters (7-10 animals) and from oversize litters (15-18 animals). Rats from oversize litters were found to have a higher heart rate between the 25th and 45th day of life compared to animals from average litters. Over the further developmental period the difference kept decreasing to disappear completely at the age of 85 days. The difference was observed also in animals which received high doses of atropine and metipranolol and is thus not attributable to difference in the tonic influence of adrenergic and cholinergic innervation. Transmural stimulation of the sinoatrial node region in isolated atria allows to demonstrate the negative chronotropic effect in young animals from average litters. This noncholinergic inhibition was not observed in animals from oversized litters and in adult animals of both groups. It was blocked by theophylline in the majority of cases. All the observed findings can be explained in the light of noncholinergic inhibition of the sinoatrial node which is tonically effective in young animals from average litters and disappears in adulthood.", 
    "42": "In the normal heart the ratio of beta 1/beta 2-receptors in both atria and ventricles is about 75:25; in the failing heart the ratio is about 60:40. Stimulation of either beta 1- or beta 2-receptors results in a positive chronotropic and inotropic response. In the periphery, with the exception of lipolysis, renin release, control of intraocular pressure and intestinal relaxation, beta 2-related activity predominates. The nature of the beta 2-receptor is being unravelled and it has now been cloned. The beta-receptor antagonist is 'anchored' via disulfide bonding. Subsequent events involve the regulatory protein guanine nucleotide which couples the receptor to adenylate cyclase. beta-receptor density may by up- or down-regulated. beta-stimulation down-regulates (uncouples and internalizes or sequestrates) and beta-antagonism up-regulates beta-receptor numbers, but the functional implications of such changes are not always clear. A partial agonist occupies a receptor site and competitively inhibits the full agonist (e.g. noradrenaline). A partial agonist differs from a full agonist in that maximal response of a tissue is less. When background sympathetic activity is absent or very low a partial agonist will act as an agonist, e.g. increase heart rate, but when background tone is high the partial agonist will behave functionally as an antagonist, e.g. decrease heart rate. In animals partial agonist activity (PAA) can be assessed in many ways. In the catecholamine-depleted (reserpine or syrosingopine), vagotomized or pithed, intact animal beta-activity can be assessed via changes in heart rate, cardiac contractility and atrioventricular conduction. Isolated organs can also be used such as atria, papillary muscle, tracheal, mesenteric artery and uterine preparations. The choice of animal is important as marked species differences in response can occur. In man assessing PAA is difficult due to the presence of an intact sympathetic system: the problem can be overcome by autonomic blockade of constrictor and vagal reflexes with prazosin, clonidine and atropine but leaving the beta-receptor mediated responses unimpaired. beta 1- and beta 2-selective PAA can also be gauged via an increased sleeping heart rate (basal sympathetic tone) in the presence and absence of a beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonist. beta 1-selective PAA can also cause an increase in resting systolic blood pressure, beta 2-selective PAA may be further assessed by a fall in DBP, increased blood flow, fall in peripheral resistance or increased finger tremor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs are a widely used, well tolerated and effective treatment for a variety of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular disorders. Over the years, beta-blockers have been associated with an incidence, albeit low, of CNS side effects. The question of interest, however, is whether the incidence is the same for all members of the class or whether other properties, such as hydrophilicity, have a bearing on the incidence of this type of side effect? This article addresses this question. In pharmacokinetic terms the lipophilic beta-blockers have been shown, both in animals and man, to readily cross the blood-brain barrier in contrast to hydrophilic beta-blockers. This is thought to have possible clinical relevance with respect to the relative incidence of CNS side-effects. To clarify the situation every published clinical paper, in which the beta-blockers propranolol (highly lipophilic, nonselective, no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA)), pindolol (moderately lipophilic, nonselective, moderate ISA), metoprolol (moderately lipophilic, beta 1-selective, no ISA) and atenolol (hydrophilic beta 1-selective, no ISA) were compared, was assessed for information pertaining to CNS side effects. This comprehensive review of the literature has shown, with few exceptions, that the incidence of CNS side effects such as sleep disturbances, dreaming, nightmares and hallucinations following clinically accepted doses of the four beta-blockers under scrutiny is generally low and that effects on short-term memory are minimal or absent. However, within this group of four drugs the incidence of these side effects is lowest with hydrophilic atenolol and generally highest with pindolol and propranolol. Metoprolol occupies an intermediate position. This order is in agreement with the pharmacokinetic observation that the more hydrophilic the molecule, the less is found in the brain tissue of both animals and man, although in the case of pindolol other factors may be important. The clinical relevance of studies involving psychometric testing is not clear.", 
    "44": "Twenty-one volunteers with moderate to severe asthma were exposed to sulfur dioxide (SO2) at concentrations of 0 (control), 0.3, and 0.6 ppm in each of three medication states: (1) low (much of their usual asthma medication withheld), (2) normal (each subject on his own usual medication schedule), and (3) high (usual medication supplemented by inhaled metaproterenol before exposure). Theophylline, the medication usually taken by subjects, was often supplemented by beta-adrenergics. Exposures were for 10 min and were accompanied by continuous heavy exercise (ventilation approximately 50 l/min). Lung function and symptoms were measured before and after exposure. With normal medication, symptomatic bronchoconstriction occurred with exercise and was exacerbated by 0.6 ppm SO2, as reported for mildly unmedicated asthmatics studied previously. Both baseline and post-exposure lung function were noticeably worse in the low-medication state. High medication improved baseline lung function and prevented most bronchoconstrictive effects of SO2/exercise. High medication also increased heart rate and apparently induced tremor or nervousness in some individuals.", 
    "45": "Electrophysiological studies using spectral analysis techniques were undertaken in rabbits to determine whether or not hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (RSA, theta wave activity) was affected by the 5-hydroxy-tryptamine1A (5-HT1A) agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and 3a alpha, 4 beta, 7 beta, 7a alpha-hexahydro-2-(4-(4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl)-butyl)-4, 7-methano-1H-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione dihydrogen citrate (SM-3997, a newly synthesized anxiolytic drug). Intravenous administration of 8-OH-DPAT and SM-3997 induced a desynchronized pattern with low-amplitude slow wave activity in the hippocampal EEG and inhibited RSA generation following stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation. RSA was also inhibited by 5-HT1A related anxiolytics such as buspirone, gepirone, and ipsapirone. The effects of 8-OH-DPAT and SM-3997 on the hippocampal RSA were blocked by pindolol, which has 5-HT1A antagonistic activity. Direct microinjection of these 5-HT1A selective agonists into the hippocampus inhibited generation of the hippocampal RSA. These findings indicated that 8-OH-DPAT and SM-3997 inhibited the hippocampal RSA by acting on hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors.", 
    "46": "The pharmacological classification of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in isolated bovine mesenteric lymphatics was studied by using various beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. Isoproterenol (ISP) (10(-10)-10(-8) M) produced dose-dependent negative chronotropic effects on the rhythm of spontaneous contractions in the lymphatic preparation. The ISP-induced effects were dose-dependently blocked by pretreatment with 10(-8)-10(-7) M metoprolol (a selective beta 1 antagonist) as well as 10(-8)-10(-7) M propranolol (a beta 1 and beta 2 antagonist). Dobutamine (a selective beta 1 agonist) caused a dose-dependent negative chronotropic effect, which was significantly blocked by pretreatment with 10(-8) M metoprolol. Salbutamol and procaterol (selective beta 2 agonists) also produced dose-dependent negative chronotropic effects, which were dose-dependently inhibited by pretreatment with 10(-8)-10(-7) M propranolol, but not by 10(-7) M metoprolol. The decreasing order of the relative potency was as follows: ISP greater than procaterol greater than salbutamol greater than dobutamine. These results suggest that bovine mesenteric lymphatics contain both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors and that both subtypes can produce a negative chronotropic effect on the rhythm of spontaneous contractions, when stimulated.", 
    "47": "The effects of adrenergic drugs on intracellular electrical potential difference (PDI) of rabbit ciliary epithelial cells were investigated. Epinephrine as well as norepinephrine hyperpolarized the PDI at lower concentrations (10(-6) M) and depolarized the PDI at higher concentrations (greater than 10(-5) M). Isoproterenol produced a depolarization of PDI and phenylephrine caused a hyperpolarization only. After pretreatment with propranolol, the change of PDI by isoproterenol was minimal. Selective agonists and antagonists were used to further characterize adrenergic effects on the PDI. Both beta 1 and beta 2 agonists caused a depolarization of PDI while both beta 1 and beta 2 antagonists produced a hyperpolarization. Alpha 1 antagonist depolarized the PDI and alpha 2 antagonist hyperpolarized the PDI. Such electrophysiological effects of the adrenergic drugs confirm the presence of alpha and beta adrenoceptors in the rabbit ciliary epithelial cells.", 
    "48": "Adrenergic blocking drugs are known to have adverse effects on lipids and lipoproteins in man, although the mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear. In order to see whether the rat might be a suitable model to explore this issue, adrenergic blockers having differing properties with respect to receptor interaction were administered to rats orally over seven days, followed by measurement of plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Total plasma cholesterol was not significantly influenced by any of the drugs used, while triglycerides were reduced by 20% and 31% respectively with pindolol and prazosin. With respect to changes in HDL cholesterol, it was found that: (a) HDL cholesterol was significantly reduced by 8% during combined beta 1, beta 2 blockade with propranolol; (b) HDL cholesterol was not significantly changed during selective beta 1 blockade using atenolol, or during combined beta 1, beta 2 blockade and partial beta 2 stimulation using pindolol; and (c) HDL cholesterol was significantly increased during combined beta 1 blockade and beta 2 stimulation using celiprolol by 12%, or during alpha 1 blockade with prazosin by 8%. It appears that beta 2 receptor exposure or stimulation may be one of the key points in the interaction between adrenergic blockade and lipoprotein metabolism.", 
    "49": "Positive chrono- and inotropic responses to denopamine (TA-064, (-)-(R)-1-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-[(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino]ethanol), a new and orally active cardiotonic agent, were investigated in the canine isolated right atrial or left ventricular preparation which was cross-circulated with blood from another support dog. Denopamine dose-dependently increased the sinus rate, right atrial and left ventricular contractile force. Denopamine was one to two orders of magnitude less potent than isoproterenol. The positive chrono- and inotropic effects of denopamine in isolated, blood-perfused right atria were dose-dependently inhibited by treatment with propranolol and atenolol. The effects of denopamine were only slightly attenuated by ICI 118,551 in doses which completely suppressed the positive chrono- and inotropic effects of procaterol. The increases in sinus rate and atrial contractility induced by denopamine were partially but significantly attenuated by treatment with imipramine in a dose which suppressed the effects of tyramine and potentiated the effects of norepinephrine. These results indicate that denopamine is a highly selective beta-1 adrenoceptor agonist in isolated, blood-perfused dog heart preparations, and they also suggest a mild catecholamine-releasing activity through tyramine-like action in isolated right atria.", 
    "50": "A number of catecholamine and non-catecholamine beta-adrenoceptor agonists, including the lipolytically selective compound BRL 37344, were compared for lipolytic activity on human and rat adipocytes. On rat adipocytes, all compounds were full agonists, BRL 37344 being the most potent. On human adipocytes, only the catecholamines were full beta-adrenoceptor agonists. The other compounds were partial agonists, with intrinsic activities declining in the order fenoterol greater than salbutamol greater than clenbuterol greater than BRL 37344. This was the case with FFA- as well as with glycerol-production. Addition of 20 microM phentolamine did not enhance BRL 37344 activity. The isoprenaline- and BRL 37344-induced lipolysis on rat white adipocytes was stereoselectively antagonized by enantiomers of alprenolol, with atypical low potencies and stereoselectivity. It was concluded that (1) human and rat adipocyte beta-adrenoceptors mediating lipolysis are not essentially different, (2) partial agonism in human adipocytes is not explained by enhanced re-esterification and (3) BRL 37344 selectively stimulates rat adipocyte lipolysis.", 
    "51": "Currently 4 classes of antihypertensive drugs - diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors - are most commonly used to treat hypertensive patients. Each class of drug has a distinctive cardiovascular pharmacodynamic profile and even within classes there exist agents with slightly different properties. The effects of the various drug classes on the heart and peripheral circulation, on the kidney and electrolyte metabolism, on the brain and on the renin-angiotensin system are now reasonably well described. Knowledge and understanding of these different cardiovascular effects are extremely important in order to adapt treatment to the needs of an individual patient. Furthermore, when combination therapy becomes necessary, the different cardiovascular aspects of the various drugs can be used to enhance antihypertensive efficacy and to attenuate adverse effects of separate compounds.", 
    "52": "To test the hypothesis that increments in plasma cyclic AMP during beta-adrenergic stimulation reflect integrated second messenger function of the tissues activated by the agonist, graded adrenaline infusion resulting in plasma adrenaline concentrations within the physiological range was performed in 8 healthy subjects with and without concomitant beta-adrenoceptor blockade by iv propranolol. A significant correlation was found between increments in plasma adrenaline and plasma cyclic AMP in the experiments without beta-blockade; during concomitant beta-blockade the increase in plasma cyclic AMP concentrations at low adrenaline infusion rates was prevented, whereas a small increase in cyclic AMP was found at high adrenaline infusion rates, probably owing to incomplete beta-receptor blockade. Likewise, the adrenaline-induced increments in blood substrates (glucose, lactate, glycerol and beta hydroxybutyric acid) were significantly reduced but not completely prevented by beta-blockade. We conclude that an altered relationship between beta-agonist concentrations and plasma cyclic AMP may provide evidence for the existence of differences in beta-adrenergic sensitivity in man.", 
    "53": "The spontaneous contractile force of muscle strips isolated from male rabbit urinary bladder dome [detrusor) and base (trigonal muscle) was dose dependently inhibited by isoproterenol, a non-specific beta-adrenoceptor agonist. The relaxant response to 10(-6) M isoproterenol in the detrusor muscle was completely blocked by butoxamine (10(-4) M), a selective beta-2-antagonist, and by propranolol (10(-6) M), a non-specific beta-antagonist, but not by metoprolol (10(-6) to 10(-4) M), a selective beta-1-antagonist. Relaxation of trigonal muscle induced by 10(-6) M isoproterenol was inhibited 30% by metoprolol (10(-5) M), 70% by butoxamine (10(-4)M), and 100% by propranolol (10(-6) M). Terbutaline, a selective beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist, also caused dose dependently a relaxant response in detrusor and trigonal muscle. The maximum relaxant responses to isoproterenol and terbutaline were significantly greater in detrusor than in trigonal muscle. Dobutamine, a relatively specific beta-1-adrenoceptor agonist, caused a small but significant relaxant response in trigonal, but no change in detrusor muscle. In trigonal muscle the relaxant response to dobutamine was less than that to terbutaline. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation in detrusor did not significantly increase after administration of dobutamine, but significantly increased after administration of terbutaline. On the other hand, not only terbutaline, but also dobutamine, markedly increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation in trigonal muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Although it is generally acknowledged that pancreatic islets are under powerful vagal control, specifics of vagal pathways and their central representation in the brain stem are unclear. To define this circuitry, we combined a protocol measuring electrical vagal stimulation-induced insulin and glucagon secretion with a retrograde tracer strategy that delineated the pool of spared motoneurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (dmnX) following selective abdominal branch vagotomies. Three of the five branches mediated both insulin and glucagon release: posterior gastric (+198 and +117% increase from basal for insulin and glucagon, respectively), anterior gastric (+177 and +104%), and hepatic branch (+103 and +60%). In contrast, unreliable and nonsignificant hormonal responses were produced by stimulation of fibers projecting through either the posterior celiac (+12% insulin and +12% glucagon) or accessory celiac (+15% insulin and +31% glucagon) branches. Since hexamethonium almost completely blocked both insulin and glucagon responses to stimulation, the effects are not likely to have resulted from inadvertent antidromic excitation of vagal afferents. Cell bodies of stimulated motoneurons, which were responsible for insulin and glucagon secretion, were found to occupy the medial two-thirds of the right (projecting through the posterior gastric branch) and left (projecting through the anterior gastric and hepatic branches) dmnX. These medial, longitudinal dmnX columns and their associated abdominal vagal branches are likely to play the predominant role in vagal control of the endocrine pancreas.", 
    "55": "The influence of cardiac afferents on the arterial baroreflex regulation of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) was examined before and after an endurance training program. The 8-wk endurance exercise training program resulted in an exercise-induced bradycardia (decreased heart rates at rest and during a graded exercise test). At rest (210 +/- 6 vs. 242 +/- 10 beats/min) and during treadmill running at 15.0 m/min, 20% grade (287 +/- 5 vs. 390 +/- 5 beats/min) posttraining heart rates were lower than pretraining. In addition, when compared with a group of untrained rabbits, trained rabbits had a significantly higher heart weight-to-body weight ratio (1.9 +/- 0.02 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.017 g/kg). Rabbits were instrumented with a Doppler flow probe around the ascending aorta, Silastic catheter inserted into the pericardial sac, electrodes around the renal sympathetic nerves and catheters in the central ear artery and vein. Before training, cardiac afferent blockade (intrapericardial procainamide, 2%) did not significantly alter resting mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index or RSNA. After training, intrapericardial procainamide mean arterial pressure increased (P less than 0.05) resting (75 +/- 4 to 86 +/- 3 mmHg) and RSNA (100% to 175 +/- 15%). More importantly, cardiac afferent blockade did not alter the range (106 +/- 4 vs. 103 +/- 4%) or gain (4.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.3%/mmHg) of the baroreflex function curve in the untrained rabbit. However, after training, cardiac afferent blockade increased (P less than 0.05) the range (55 +/- 3 to 103 +/- 4%) and gain (1.5 +/- 0.07 to 3.9 +/- 0.2%/mmHg) of baroreflex regulation of RSNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "We report here on 2 patients with adrenergic urticaria and adrenergic pruritus, respectively. The lesions and features developed during phases of stress and during the attacks were associated with an increase in the plasma concentrations of noradrenalin, adrenalin and prolactin. The dopamine plasma level was elevated only in the case of adrenergic urticaria. The symptoms could be reproduced by intradermal injection of adrenalin and noradrenalin and treated successfully with propanolol, a blocker of beta-adrenergic receptors. Adrenergic urticaria is a rare but distinct entity, which has to be separated from cholinergic urticaria. Adrenergic pruritus seems to be a minor variant of adrenergic urticaria.", 
    "57": "Some beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) antagonists, in addition to blocking receptor-mediated responses, possess agonistic properties or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). In this study we describe several techniques for amplification of cAMP levels as a measure of agonistic activity, and we apply these techniques to the study of beta AR antagonists with ISA. We show that 1) a variety of beta AR antagonists with ISA, including alprenolol and cyanopindolol, enhance cyclic AMP accumulation in S49 lymphoma cells if cells are also incubated with the diterpene forskolin; 2) beta AR blockers with ISA stimulate cAMP accumulation in the presence of a water-soluble analog of forskolin but not in the presence of 9,11-dideoxyforskolin (which does not activate adenylyl cyclase); 3) the potentiation by forskolin is not unique to S49 cells but is also observed in BC3H1 smooth muscle-derived cells; 4) stimulation of cAMP accumulation by beta-blockers with ISA occurs in S49 cells in three additional settings that do not involve the use of forskolin, after pretreatment with pertussis toxin to inactivate the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein, after pretreatment with [D-Trp8]-somatostatin to sensitize adenylyl cyclase, and using a radioimmunoassay to quantitate levels of cellular cAMP. We conclude that beta AR antagonists with ISA can weakly stimulate intracellular cAMP accumulation, but this stimulation is not easily detected. Elevation of cAMP levels may account for the agonistic effects of these drugs or, at least provides a measure of stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein activation by these compounds.", 
    "58": "Subcutaneous injection of B-HT 920, a dopamine D2-receptor agonist, in doses ranging from 5 to 100 micrograms/kg, induced yawning behavior in rats. Yawning was also elicited by low doses (25-500 micrograms/kg sc) of SND 919, a newly synthesized dopamine receptor agonist. The yawning evoked by B-HT 920 or SND 919 was increased by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist pindolol (20 mg/kg ip) which alone did not induce yawning. Stereotyped behavior did not appear after B-HT 920 or SND 919 given alone or in combination with pindolol. The results suggest that SND 919 as well as B-HT 920 has stimulatory activity at dopamine D2-receptors, and that pindolol may exert its enhancement of the yawning response to dopamine receptor agonists via blockade of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "59": "The postoperative course of patients emerging from general anesthesia after intracranial surgery is frequently complicated by hypertension. This study examined the comparative efficacy of esmolol and labetalol in treating increases in blood pressure during emergence and recovery from anesthesia after intracranial surgery. Both esmolol and labetalol were equally effective in controlling systolic blood pressure on emergence and in the recovery room in patients undergoing intracranial surgery. However, decreases in heart rate were significantly more frequent in the immediate postoperative period in patients given labetalol. An increase in blood pressure after intracranial surgery appears to be a transitory phenomenon adequately treated with a short-acting antihypertensive agent such as esmolol.", 
    "60": "The investigation and management of pheochromocytoma have been of special interest at the Mayo Clinic since 1926, when Dr. C. H. Mayo successfully removed an adrenal tumor. Recent clinical developments include the detection of asymptomatic paroxysms of hypertension by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, detailed characterization of catecholamine cardiomyopathy by echocardiography, and further experience with Carney's triad and other polyglandular and multiple neoplasia syndromes associated with pheochromocytoma. Refinement in interpretation of catecholamine measurements and the development of radionuclide scanning with m-[131I]iodobenzylguanidine, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have greatly enhanced our diagnostic acumen. Developments in antihypertensive drug therapy and chemotherapy have improved our management of cathecholamine hypersecretion and tumor growth, respectively, in inoperable patients and in the preparation of patients for anesthesia and surgical treatment. Flow cytometry to detect abnormal DNA histograms may prove particularly useful in predicting the malignant nature of the tumors.", 
    "61": "Of the approximately 58 million Americans with hypertension, the majority have only mild increases in blood pressure and individually are at low risk. Large group studies, however, have demonstrated the efficacy of treating mild hypertension. Public health efforts during the past 16 years have increased the number of hypertensive patients made aware of their condition and brought into treatment. A major problem, however, is consistently maintaining patients on long-term therapy. A large number of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments have become available for the management of hypertension. These treatments must be applied individually to enhance benefit, minimize potential harm, and increase the likelihood of long-term compliance for what is often a lifelong disorder. For accomplishing this goal, a thorough understanding of important characteristics of both the individual patient and the available therapeutic modalities is needed.", 
    "62": "A series of stereoisomeric practolol and propranolol derivatives has been synthesized in which the N-isopropyl group of the drug was replaced by an asymmetric heptanoic acid terminated by a substituted p-toluidide or p-(trifluoromethyl)anilide. The asymmetric epoxide, 3-(p-acetamidophenoxy)-1,2-epoxypropane, was allowed to react with a preformed enantiomeric 6-aminoheptanoic acid amide to yield the stereoisomeric practolol congener derivatives. An asymmetric drug precursor epoxide was prepared from p-acetamidophenol and enantiomeric 3-(tosyloxy)-1,2-epoxypropane 6-aminoheptanoic acid amides were allowed to react with one of the enantiomers of 3-(1-naphthyloxy)-1,2-epoxypropane. This drug precursor epoxide was prepared either by combining 1-naphthol with enantiomeric 3-(tosyloxy)-1,2-epoxypropane (the Sharpless epoxide) or by combining 1-naphthol with enantiomeric 3-(tosyloxy)-1,2-propanediol followed by epoxidation. Pharmacological studies carried out for the practolol derivatives demonstrated a significant dependence of enhanced potency and tissue/subreceptor specificity on both the configuration of the drug asymmetric carbon and the configuration of the spacer asymmetric carbon. The compounds containing the S configuration at the drug asymmetric center and the R configuration at the spacer asymmetric carbon exhibited an increase in potency over the other stereoisomeric congener derivatives and the progenitor drug. For the propranolol congener derivatives, a large decrease in potency was observed for all of the stereoisomers over the progenitor drug. The propranolol stereoisomers containing the S configuration at the drug asymmetric center were more active than those containing the R configuration at that center.", 
    "63": "The short-term effects of oral diltiazem on hemodynamics and distribution of cardiac output at rest and during semiupright bicycle exercise were evaluated in eight patients with stable effort angina on long-term beta 1-adrenergic blockade. Cardiac output and iliofemoral blood flow were measured using thermodilution. The patients were exercised to the same work load on a bicycle before and 2 h after oral diltiazem (60 mg in two patients and 120 mg in six). At maximal exercise, diltiazem reduced heart rate from 94 +/- 5 to 88 +/- 6 beats/min (p less than 0.01), mean arterial pressure from 139 +/- 5 to 127 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and systemic vascular resistance from 9.7 +/- 0.7 to 8.4 +/- 0.4 x 10(2) dynes.s.cm-5 (p less than 0.05) compared with control. During exercise, cardiac output, iliofemoral blood flow, mean pulmonary wedge pressure and mean right atrial pressure were not altered, but stroke volume increased from 119 +/- 11 to 131 +/- 10 ml (p less than 0.05). Maximal ST segment depression during exercise was decreased and angina was less. Diltiazem does not alter the distribution of the cardiac output during exercise but improves ischemia.", 
    "64": "To determine whether a standardized dose of esmolol can effectively attenuate the cardiovascular response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), 17 ASA physical status I-II patients were studied in a randomized within-patient, crossover design. Each patient received \"no esmolol\" during one ECT and three to five days later crossed over to the alternative treatment receiving an esmolol 80 mg bolus followed by 24 mg.min-1 infusion two minutes prior to induction of anaesthesia and continued for five minutes after induction. Esmolol blunted the maximum increases in heart rate (HR) by 26 per cent, mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 14 per cent, and rate pressure product by 37 per cent with significant differences (P less than 0.05) noted at one, two, three and four minutes after ECT (minutes five, six, seven, and eight of the esmolol infusion). There was no significant difference in seizure duration between the two groups and no adverse reactions occurred.", 
    "65": "Several types of voltage sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) including types N and Ln are present in varying degrees in neurons from different locations and they appear to differ from the Lm type VSCC on muscle cells. Omega conotoxin blocks N and Ln channels but not Lm channels. Verapamil blocks Ln and Lm but not N channels. The purpose of this study was to determine whether N or Ln channels mediate norepinephrine (NE) release in isolated rings of rabbit pulmonary artery. The release of endogenous NE from intramural sympathetic neurons was evoked by field electrical stimulation (ES) of the tissues. Conotoxin (10(-6) M) had no effect on contractions of rabbit pulmonary artery induced by 40 mM K+ or exogenous NE (10(-9)-10(-5) M) but significantly depressed the response to ES (21V, 0.5 msec pulse duration) at all stimulation frequencies (1-20Hz). Thus, the effects of conotoxin are restricted to the N and/or Ln calcium channels on neurons in this issue. Verapamil (5 x 10(-6) M) depressed 40 mM K(+)-induced contractions by 86 +/- 2% as well as contractions induced by endogenous (ES at 1-20 Hz) and exogenous NE (10(-9)-10(-5) M). Moreover, for contractions of equal magnitude, verapamil depressed the response to endogenous (ES) and exogenous NE to the same degree. Had Ln channels mediated NE release in the tissue, verapamil should have had a greater effect on ES-induced contractions because ES activates both pre- and post-junctional calcium channels whereas exogenous NE activates only post-junctional channels on smooth muscle cells. Thus, it appears that N-type calcium channels mediate NE release in rabbit pulmonary artery.", 
    "66": "Neuroactive substances reaching the developing brain can affect the formation of the functionality of nervous circuitry. To explain this so-called functional neuroteratology it has been proposed that neurotransmission has persistently been altered. Pharmacological interference with the developing central noradrenergic system in the rat by means of drugs like clonidine, yohimbine and propranolol, indeed revealed lasting changes in the turnover of noradrenaline in several brain areas, but no changes were found in beta-receptor density. It is assumed that either alpha-receptor density is affected or that signal transduction is altered, since electrophysiologically a persistent supersensitivity was found for the noradrenaline-evoked depression of glutamate-evoked firing in e.g. CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. Elucidation of the underlying neurochemical mechanisms of such lasting effects of perinatal exposure to noradrenergic drugs aims at establishing the role of noradrenaline in development, but also to provide physicians with the possibility to better assess the advantages and disadvantages of drugs to be prescribed during reproduction and, hence, to make the best choice of treatment.", 
    "67": "When ginseng polypeptide (GP) was administered iv or sc to mice or rats, the blood sugar and liver glycogen were decreased. The decrease of blood sugar and liver glycogen induced by GP in rats were inhibited by pretreatments with pentolamine and propranolol, respectively. The results suggest that the effect of GP on glucose metabolism may be related to adrenergic receptors. In addition, GP at doses which cause decreases of blood sugar and glycogen, inhibited LDH activity, and consequently produced decrease of lactic acid and increase of pyruvic acid. GP was also found to stimulate SDH and CCO activities (which are respiratory enzymes in the electron transport chain), consequently promote aerobic oxidation course.", 
    "68": "The mechanisms responsible for the resetting of the baroreceptor reflex during long-term administration of 1,4 dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are incompletely understood. The present study investigated the effect of 10 mg per day of felodipine on arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), urinary norepinephrine, and cardiac beta-1-receptor sensitivity in 10 healthy volunteers. Blood pressure heart rate and urinary norepinephrine were determined during control and on days 1,4, and 14 of felodipine administration. Dose response curves of intravenous bolus injections of isoproterenol were performed on the same days to measure cardiac beta-1-receptor sensitivity. Felodipine significantly reduced the blood pressure from 131 +/- 6/74 +/- 3 mm Hg (mean +/- s.e.m.) to 123 +/- 6/65 +/- 2 mm Hg on day 1 (p less than 0.01). The blood pressure remained decreased during the entire protocol. The initial increase in the heart rate (62 +/- 5 to 67 +/- 4 min-1) remained elevated on day 4 and returned within the control range by day 14 (63 +/- 4 min-1) in spite of unchanged felodipine plasma levels (1.71 +/- 1.13 ng/ml (day 1) and 1.66 +/- 0.66 ng/ml (day 14). Urinary norepinephrine rose significantly with short-term felodipine administration (62 +/- 12 versus 50 +/- 6 micrograms/24 h; p less than 0.01). With long-term felodipine administration this value returned to pretreatment levels (55 +/- 12 micrograms/24 h). Cardiac beta-1-receptor sensitivity was not changed at any point of the protocol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The effect of 50 and 150 mg cicletanine, a new vasodilator antihypertensive, on plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), cyclic GMP and antidiuretic hormone has been investigated at rest and during standardized exercise, in a double blind cross over study in healthy subjects. Exercise significantly increased in plasma ANP, cyclic GMP and antidiuretic hormone concentrations, and cicletanine did not affect any of them either at rest or during exercise. Since the alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker prazosine decreases, beta-adrenoceptor blockers increase and the vasodilator cicletanine does not alter the plasma ANP response to exercise, it is suggested that adrenergic receptors may be directly involved in the regulation of ANP secretion.", 
    "70": "1. The effect of sequential alpha and beta adrenoceptor blockade on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and arterial pressure lability (APL) was studied 3 and 15 days after sino-aortic deafferentation (SAD) in rats. 2. Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker, injected iv (1 mg/kg) into SAD rats 3 days after surgery produced a significant fall in MAP (-61 vs -21 mmHg) and APL (-7 vs 0 mmHg) when compared with sham-operated rats. 3. Propranolol, a beta-1 and -2 adrenoceptor blocker, injected iv (1 mg/kg) after prazosin into SAD rats (3 days) produced a significant increase in MAP (+37 vs +5 mmHg) and APL (+4 vs 0 mmHg) when compared with sham-operated rats. 4. Prazosin injected iv (1 mg/kg) into SAD rats 15 days after surgery produced smaller changes in MAP than observed in rats 3 days after SAD but a significant fall in MAP (-35 vs -13 mmHg) when compared with sham-operated rats. At this phase of SAD, no changes in APL were observed after prazosin. 5. Propranolol injected iv (1 mg/kg) after prazosin into SAD and sham-operated rats (15 days) produced no changes in MAP and APL. 6. Prazosin injected into SAD rats (3 and 15 days) with previous adrenal demedullation produced falls in MAP and APL similar to those observed in SAD rats with intact adrenals. 7. In contrast to SAD rats with intact adrenals, propranolol injected after prazosin into SAD rats (3 days) with previous adrenal demedullation produced no increase in MAP. 8. These results suggest that a) alpha-1 adrenoceptors are directly involved in MAP maintenance in SAD rats 3 and 15 days after surgery; b) 2 weeks after SAD, compensatory reflex mechanisms may be acting to reduce the fall in MAP produced by prazosin; c) alpha-1 adrenoceptors are not directly involved in APL generation; d) APL is related to the activation of beta adrenoceptors by endogenous epinephrine release.", 
    "71": "Increases in the activity of efferent cardiac sympathetic nerves by 35 +/- 9% were induced by 60 s bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (BCO) in anesthetized dogs. Under control conditions the reflex rise in sympathetic nerve activity enhanced left ventricular pressure (115 +/- 4 mm Hg) by 47% and regional myocardial oxygen consumption (9.7 +/- 1.1 ml/min.100 g) by 56%. Simultaneously, end-diastolic circumflex coronary resistance (0.99 +/- 0.11 mm Hg.min.100 g/ml) decreased by 16%. After exhaustion of coronary dilator reserve by production of a severe coronary stenosis, BCO enhanced left ventricular pressure (107 +/- 4 mm Hg) by 49%, oxygen consumption of the poststenotic area (7.6 +/- 0.8 ml/min.100 g) increased by 21%, and circumflex coronary resistance (0.54 +/- 0.05 mm Hg.min.100 g/ml) also increased by 19%. The reflex increase in coronary resistance during BCO was abolished after infusion of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine (0.2 mg/kg i.v.). Administration of rauwolscine, however, did not prevent the reflex increase of left ventricular pressure and regional myocardial oxygen consumption. Comparable increases in poststenotic coronary resistance during BCO were found in dogs which either received propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.) or in which the reflex rise in mean aortic pressure was limited to 13 +/- 3 mm Hg. In both experimental groups, rauwolscine also effectively prevented the BCO-induced rise in coronary resistance. In contrast, the reflex increase of total peripheral resistance was not significantly reduced by rauwolscine, but was blunted after additional administration of the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (1.2 mg/kg i.v.). We conclude that: 1) Poststenotic coronary vasoconstriction occurs during shortlasting increases in efferent cardiac sympathetic discharge within the physiological range. 2) This increase in poststenotic coronary resistance is significantly reduced after administration of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine. 3) In contrast to poststenotic coronary resistance, functionally innervated alpha 2-adrenoceptors are of minimal importance for the reflex increase in total peripheral resistance.", 
    "72": "From 1979 to 1989, in 1938 hyperthyroid patients with different preoperative treatment, thyreotoxic crisis did no longer occur. In a prospective study, 28 patients with graves' disease were operated in severe hyperthyroidism (max. fT3 37.3 pmol/l, normal range 4.0-9.0; max. fT4 12.6 ng/dl, normal range 0.7-1.9) premedicated only by betablockers: the man of fT3 sank significantly within 1 hour after operation and returned to normal range after 8 hours. The fT4 sank significantly within the 1st postop. day and reached its normal value on the 4th postop. day. No rise of fT3 or fT4 was ever observed, nor was there any clinical sign of thyreotoxicosis. Therefore in hyperthyroidism, a routine preoperative treatment with antithyroid drugs or iodine is not necessary.", 
    "73": "Several major studies investigated the possibility of a primary preventive effect of beta-blockers. The International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension (IPPPSH) compared a beta-blocker-containing vs. a non-beta-blocker-containing antihypertensive regimen in 6,357 moderate-severe hypertensive men and women treated over 3-5 years. Blood pressure (BP) control was comparable with either regimen. beta-Blocker treatment was associated with less hypokalemia, earlier electrocardiogram normalization, and fewer withdrawals for uncontrolled hypertension. In agreement with the Medical Research Council (MRC) trial on mild hypertension and the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension (HAPPHY) trial, but at variance with the Primary Prevention Metoprolol in Patients with Hypertension (MAPHY) study, cardiac event rates were similar in beta-blocker- and non-beta-blocker-treated patients. With either regimen, in-study BP reduction was associated with a lower rate of stroke as well as of cardiac events. In a subgroup analysis, nonsmokers appeared to derive beta-blocker benefit, the results being similar to those of the MRC. Smokers required higher doses of drugs to achieve diastolic target pressure, had a higher heart rate and hematocrit, and a higher cardiac event rate than nonsmokers at any given level of diastolic pressure. Except for the MAPHY trial, these primary prevention studies do not support the concept of a cardiac primary preventive effect of antihypertensive beta-blockade but stress the importance of good BP control and a comprehensive risk factor prevention approach in the management of hypertensive patients.", 
    "74": "The present randomized primary prevention study in hypertensive men aged 40-64 years (n = 3,234) was aimed at investigating whether metoprolol given as initial treatment would prevent coronary artery disease (CAD) better than thiazide diuretics. Two hundred fifty-five patients had a definite CAD event during the 15,730 patient-years of follow-up; 25% of these events were fatal, and 38% were definite acute myocardial infarctions. The incidence of CAD was significantly lower during follow-up in patients randomized to metoprolol than in patients randomized to diuretics: 111 vs. 144 cases (p = 0.001). Stroke mortality was significantly lower in the metoprolol group than in the diuretic group, but the overall stroke incidence was similar in the two treatment groups. A majority of events occurred among smokers in both treatment groups although only one-third of patients were smokers at baseline. Blood pressure (BP) control was similar in the two treatment groups; therefore, the difference between the groups in CAD events is mediated via mechanisms other than the BP-reducing effect of metoprolol."
