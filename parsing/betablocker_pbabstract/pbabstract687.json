The main antianginal drugs are nitrates (intravenous, percutaneous and oral), beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and amiodarone. Treatment and follow-up of 53 consecutive patients hospitalized at the Geneva Medical Intensive Care Unit are reviewed. Medical treatment serves to decrease or suppress myocardial ischemia in most cases. Coronary arteriography can then be performed on an elective basis and followed, if necessary, by coronary by-pass grafting. Rare failures of medical therapy form the only indication for emergency coronary arteriography and surgery.", 
    "1": "The technique of laser Doppler spectroscopy is used to measure the electrophoretic mobility of liposomes under the influence of one beta-blocking agent and three local anesthetics. All four drugs decrease the mobility (i.e., the zeta potential) of negatively charged phospholipids (soybean lipids, phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin). The mobility of electrostatically neutral pure phosphatidylcholine (zero mobility under control conditions at pH 7 and 4) is increased linearly with the logarithm of drug concentration, indicating binding and incorporation of positively charged drug molecules. The sequence of strength of activity, measured by zeta-potential changes, corresponds to that found in biological tissues: propranolol greater than tetracaine greater than lidocaine greater than procaine. For purely negatively charged lipids (phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin) the activity of the drug is higher at acidic pH, (pH 4), while for electrostatically neutral (phosphatidylcholine) or partly neutral (soybean) lipid liposomes drug activity is about the same at pH 9, 7 and 4. A Hill plot of the data reveals noncooperative drug binding. From the line width of the scattering power spectrum the mean particle radius and the average interparticle distance in the samples are determined.", 
    "2": "Lipid storage myopathies are a rare but serious cause of muscle weakness characterised by the accumulation of abnormal amounts of neutral fat in type 1 fibres. A case is reported in which the patient presented with weakness of the proximal limb muscles and greatly increased activities of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. After two years lipid myopathy was diagnosed when electron microscopy confirmed the presence of large numbers of lipid particles within muscle fibres. Twelve years after the initial presentation propranolol (40 mg thrice daily) was started. Strength gradually improved and enzyme activities returned to normal. The improvement in the patient's condition was almost certainly due to the propranolol, although the mode of action of the drug remains unknown.", 
    "3": "The hemodynamic benefits of combined administration of prenalterol (P) with hydralazine (H) were evaluated in ten patients with severe chronic heart failure. Single administration of 100 mg H increased cardiac index (CI) from 2.3 to 3.0 l/min/m2, whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PWC) remained unchanged. After 3--4 weeks of treatment with 200 mg H hemodynamic improvementt was maintained (CI: 2.9 l/min/m2). Additional administration of P caused further augmentation of CI (3.3 l/min/m2). After long-term treatment with the combination of H and P sustained augmentation of CI (3.2 l/min/m2), and, furthermore, a slight but significant decrease of PCW were observed (p less than 0.05 vs. chronic single H-therapy). Five patients were able to perform exercise testing; H improved maximal exercise capacity and exercise hemodynamics in three patients. Further improvemen was observed after combined treatment (H + P) in three of five patients. It is concluded, the prenalterol may enhance the effectiveness of hydralazine therapy in congestive heart failure by providing concomitantly the principal actions of the vasodilator and positive inotropic agent used separately. Furthermore, the results indicate that oral long-term administration of hydralazine and prenalterol can produce sustained beneficial improvement.", 
    "4": "Essential tremor, including the juvenile and senile variations, may be a result of a disorder of the servomechanism that controls physiologic tremor. Hands and arms are affected most commonly, and the tremor can vary in amplitude as well as frequency. Long-term treatment with propranolol has been helpful for some patients, although older patients are less likely to benefit. Other drugs and behaviour modification therapy have been less successful. Surgical treatment is effective but should probably be reserved for severe cases. An effective instrument for measuring the subjective and objective aspects of the tremor is still needed, as is an effective long-term method of treatment.", 
    "5": "The causal connection between the coronary occlusion and the necrosis of the myocardium, as it is verified again and again, is not unequivocal. The favourable effects of the beta-receptorblockers in the acute phase of the infarction of the height of the ST-elevations, the later levels of the CPK and the prognosis of the patients plead for the essential causal importance of the catecholamines in the infarctional process. The catecholamines have an effect on the myocardium increasing the contraction and dissipating oxygen. Through activations of the metabolism in the vascular wall they lead to subintimal swellings and to lesions of the endothelium and increase the aggregation of the thrombocytes. With the decreasing pH, value the flexibility of erythrocytes lowers and thus the microcirculation. Via positive feed-backs the acidosis of the myocardium increases, which via activation of lysosomal enzymes leads to the necrosis of the myocardium. beta-receptorblockers reduced the myocardial contractility, the increased glycogenolysis and the increased activity of the respiratory chains. The lesion of the vascular wall, the aggregation of thrombocytes and the decrease of pH are inhibited, by means of which the spreading conditions of the necrosis deteriorate. By the early application of the beta-receptor blockers the patho-mechanisms lying still in the functional region can be inhibited, thus the danger of early disturbances of rhythm and of the early cardiogenic shock. With the deterioration of the conditions of necrotization the prognosis of the patients with infarction improves.", 
    "6": "In part I of this article we report on 89 hypertensive patients who underwent 9 months of treatment with oxprenolol HCl 160 mg in a slow-release formulation plus cyclopenthiazide 0.25 mg and potassium chloride 600 mg (Trasidrex; Ciba-Geigy). Blood pressures, both supine and standing, and pulse rates were consistently controlled by this regimen throughout the 9 months of treatment, regardless of the time of day at which these parameters were measured, i.e. morning or afternoon. Seventy-six patients completed the trial. The most common symptom or sign occurring during treatment was headache, the next most common being heartburn. No patient developed angina while on the regimen. Three patients discontinued the study owing to unwanted effects. This study represents a total of 28237 patient-days of treatment. In part II of the trial we studied the effects of a similar regiment in 67 patients for 1 year preceded by a 2-week wash-out period. Forty-six of the patients completed a full year's treatment. Statistically significant reductions in blood pressures and pulse rates occurred after commencement of active treatment and were maintained throughout the study period. Four patients withdrew from the study owing to adverse effects, 1 patient died of an acute myocardial infarction, and 1 patient was considered a treatment failure. This study represents 19858 patient-days of treatment.", 
    "7": "Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in an open cross-over study designed to test whether two fixed-dose combination formulations of penbutolol (40 mg) and furosemide (20 mg), an ordinary and a film-coated tablet, are bio-equivalent. Penbutolol capsules (40 mg) and 20 mg furosemide tablets (Lasix; Hoechst) served as reference formulations. The maximum concentration of furosemide was significantly depressed in the case of fixed-dose combinations, reflecting a possible pharmacokinetic interaction between penbutolol and furosemide. However, the area under the concentration versus time curve for furosemide and its cumulative urinary excretion and diuretic effect were not influenced by penbutolol. On the basis of plasma concentration versus time data and urinary parameters, the two fixed-dose formulations are bio-equivalent.", 
    "8": "Whole-blood propranolol concentrations were estimated for 12 hours after a single 80 mg oral dose was given in six patients taking cimetidine and two weeks after they had stopped the drug. Mean blood propranolol concentrations were higher throughout the sampling period when the patients were taking cimetidine than when they were not, and the difference was statistically significant between one and four hours (p less than 0.05). The mean relative bioavailability of propranolol, measured as the area under the concentration time curve, was significantly higher when the patients were taking cimetidine (p less than 0.025). The mean increase in bioavailability was 136.5 +/- 57.6%, and the results were consistent in each subject. It is concluded from these results that cimetidine reduces the hepatic first-pass extraction of propranolol.", 
    "9": "The sciatic nerve in rats was cut and ligated, and 5-18 days later pathophysiological properties of the resulting neuroma were studied. We found that afferent fibers ending in the neuroma produced prolonged discharges following repetitive stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic trunk (LST) or i.v. adrenaline. Mean latencies of activation of afferent fibers were 10 +/- 2.1 sec and 12 +/- 3.4 sec (mean +/- S.D.) to LST stimulation and to adrenaline injection, respectively. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine blocked responses to LST stimulation and adrenaline. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol had no effect.", 
    "10": "The intravenous infusion of catecholamines to rats induced a dose dependent increase of immunoreactive beta-endorphin (beta-Endi) in plasma. The ED50 values of 1-epinephrine and 1-isoproterenol were 110 and 100 ng/kg X min respectively. 1-Propranolol, but not d-propranolol prevented the effect of 1-epinephrine. Infusion of 100 ng/kg X min of 1-epinephrine increased plasma epinephrine to 11 pmol/ml, a concentration that can occur during stress. We conclude that circulating catecholamines can stimulate beta-Endi secretion via a beta-adrenergic receptor mechanism and may play a role in the response of beta-Endi to stress.", 
    "11": "Normotensive (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) male rats were treated orally, one week after weaning and for 9 weeks, with alpha-methyldopa (100 mg/kg per day), propranolol (30 mg/kg per day) or hydralazine (10 mg/kg per day). Untreated WKY and SHR rats served as controls. The development of hypertension in SHR rats were attenuated by treatment but none of the drugs was able to restore the impairment in isoproterenol, secretin and glucagon responsiveness of cardiac adenylate cyclase activity which is characteristic of these animals. In heart membranes from both WKY and SHR rats, alpha-methyldopa treatment increased the number of beta-adrenoceptors by 20-32% and the maximal response of adenylate cyclase activity to isoproterenol and glucagon by 20-34%. By contrast, the beta-blocker propranolol was ineffective on these parameters. The results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis that the change in adenylate cyclase seen in SHR rats is genetic in origin and is not a consequence of hypertension.", 
    "12": "The effect of perfused norepinephrine (NE) on evoked potentials in CA1 of the in vitro rat hippocampus was examined. Weak and variable effects on population spike amplitude were observed, with lower doses of NE generally producing excitations and higher doses more often producing inhibitions. Clonidine, an alpha-receptor agonist, produced a dose-dependent inhibition of population spike amplitude; this inhibition was effectively antagonized by the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine. Isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-agonist, produced marked increases in population spike amplitude which could be antagonized by timolol, a beta-receptor antagonist. Phentolamine did not antagonize the excitations produced by ISO, and timolol had no effect on the inhibitions seen with clonidine. After pretreatment with either phentolamine or timolol, NE perfusion elicited robust and consistent elevations or reductions in the population spike, respectively. A potent cyclic AMP derivative, 8-p-chlorophenylthio cyclic AMP, produced large increases in population spike amplitude which appeared similar to the responses seen with beta-agonists. No changes in field EPSP amplitudes were observed with any of the drugs tested. Taken together, these results suggest that NE may interact with alpha-adrenergic receptors to decrease pyramidal cell excitability, and the beta-adrenergic receptors to increase pyramidal cell excitability; the beta-effect may involve cAMP.", 
    "13": "Labetalol has been successful in treating hypertension, and few side effects have been reported, although there have been cases of muscle pain during treatment. A patient with essential hypertension treated with labetalol 600 mg daily complained of muscle pains, particularly in the legs. No neurological abnormality was found, but the activity of muscle enzymes in the blood was high. Findings on electromyography were compatible with myositis and electron microscopical findings suggested toxic myopathy. Labetalol was stopped for 10 days, and the muscle pain disappeared and enzyme activity returned to normal. When labetalol was restarted the pain returned and enzyme activities rose. Myopathy should be considered in patients experiencing muscle pain after treatment with labetalol.", 
    "14": "An apparent increase in young people dying suddenly from acute asthma has been noted in the past 2 years in Auckland. 22 fatal cases were reviewed. Prescribing habits for asthma therapy have been changing in New Zealand, with a considerable increase in the use of oral theophylline drugs, particularly sustained-release preparations, which in many patients have replaced inhaled steroids and cromoglycate. It is suggested that there may be an additive toxicity between theophylline and inhaled beta 2-agonists at high doses which produces cardiac arrest. Also when regular symptomatic treatment with bronchodilators replaces inhaled steroids or cromoglycate the patient's perception of an asthma crisis may be delayed.", 
    "15": "A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study of morbidity and mortality was carried out using heparin, atenolol, and a combination of both drugs, in 214 patients with the intermediate coronary syndrome. During the trial period, transmural myocardial infarction developed in 9 (17%) out of 54 patients on placebo, 8 (13%) out of 60 on atenolol, 1 (2%) out of 51 on heparin, and 2 (4%) out of 49 on heparin and atenolol combined (p = 0.024). The improved prognosis in the heparin-treated patients was was maintained at follow-up. All five deaths occurred among patients who did not receive heparin. These results show that intravenous heparin therapy was of benefit in preventing myocardial infarction in patients with the intermediate coronary syndrome.", 
    "16": "Peyronie's disease (induratio penis plastica) and a syndrome resembling systemic lupus erythematosus (S.L.E.) contemporaneously developed in a 50-year-old man six months after initiation of treatment with metoprolol. In view of the improvement in symptoms and signs on withdrawal of metoprolol, it seems likely that the drug was responsible for both these conditions. Peyronie's disease has been observed in relation to treatment with other adrenergic blocking agents, including practolol, and the S.L.E. syndrome is thought to be a possible untoward effect of practolol therapy. The relationship between practolol and sclerosing conditions elsewhere in the body is well recognized and an immunological basis for the fibrosis has been suggested. Similarly, the possibility is raised that Peyronie's disease may be in this case a particular expression of the auto immune disorder induced by metoprolol administration.", 
    "17": "Since myocardial pump function is affected by preload or afterload, it is difficult to assess left ventricular (LV) contractility independently from these in clinical cardiology. In this study, we performed inotropic intervention by isoproterenol or propranolol, and changed afterload by angiotensin or nitroprusside, to estimate the usefulness of peak systolic pressure/end-systolic volume index (PSP/ESVI) as a parameter of LV contractility. The data were obtained by cuff method or catheter-tip manometer and echocardiography. We calculated PSP/ESVI in various heart diseases, and results were analyzed for a significant change using the t test. Ejection fraction, mean VCF (mVCF) were calculated simultaneously, and compared with PSP/ESVI. The results were as follows: 1) PSP/ESVI ratio significantly reflected inotropic intervention with isoproterenol and propranolol. 2) PSP/ESVI ratio was less affected by the change of peak systolic pressure than EF or mVCF. 3) There was a significant difference in PSP/ESVI among congestive cardiomyopathy, valvular heart diseases and normal controls. 4) There was also a significant difference in PSP/ESVI between patients of NYHA I and those of NYHA II--IV. 5) PSP/ESVI ratio, measured by non-invasive method, was thought to be a useful parameter to assess LV contractility.", 
    "18": "Six juvenile hypertensive patients were studied by supine bicycle ergometer exercise during continuous echocardiographic recording. Thirteen normotensive young men were also studied for the control. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions (Dd) during exercise was significantly increased from 28.8 +/- 0.5 mm/m2 to 29.7 +/- 0.6 mm/m2 in normotensives, but the increase in Dd was not observed in hypertensives. Effects of propranolol on changes in Dd during exercise were almost equal in two groups. Left ventricular end-systolic dimensions (Ds) were decreased during exercise in both groups. After propranolol administration, Ds in hypertensives was significantly increased from 18.8 +/- 1.0 mm/m2 to 19.4 +/- 1.1 mm/m2 at rest, and during the following exercise it reached to 19.7 +/- 1.1 mm/m2, whereas Ds in normotensives was decreased during exercise even after propranolol. Peripheral vascular resistance at rest was almost equal between the two groups, but in hypertensives the reduction during exercise was restricted. These results suggest that sympathetic activities of cardiovascular system are accentuated in juvenile hypertensive subjects.", 
    "19": "The effect of vagal stimulation on the myocardial ischaemia produced by acute coronary occlusion during beta-receptor blockade has been examined. Epicardial ST-segment elevation, myocardial surface temperature and regional blood flow were determined 10 min after coronary occlusion in the dog. Coronary occlusion after beta-receptor blockade alone raised the average ST-segment from 0.5 +/- 0.3 to 3.1 +/- 0.5 mV (SEM) (p less than 0.001). Subsequent vagal stimulation with beta-receptor blockade, which reduced heart rate from 129 to 50 beats/min, mean arterial pressure from 123 to 78 mmHg, but increased cardiac output from 1164 to 1855 ml/min, resulted in marked reduction in ST-segment elevation to 0.3 +/- 0.2 mV which was not different from the control before occlusion. Epicardial temperature was markedly decreased in the ischaemic area following coronary occlusion. The temperature difference between central ischaemic and surrounding areas became smaller after beta-receptor blockade, and vanished during vagal stimulation. Vagal stimulation caused a 55% decrease of blood flow in all non-ischaemic regions. A smaller reduction took place in the border zone where flow values close to those of the non-ischaemic myocardium were obtained. In the central ischaemic area blood flow remained unchanged despite the reduction in arterial pressure. Thus, vagal stimulation resulted in decreased collateral resistance in the ischaemic area and a marked reduction of myocardial oxygen requirement of both non-ischaemic and border zone myocardium, additional to that obtained with beta receptor blockade. The provision of energy to the ischaemic myocardium is therefore very favourably balanced with its actual demand during vagal stimulation.", 
    "20": "1. As a sequel to previous evidence that prolonged beta-adrenoceptor blockade in young rabbits led to a relative increase in the capillarity of ventricular muscle, an attempt has been made to localize and quantify the capillary density from epicardium to endocardium in 12-week old rabbits treated for 6 weeks with propranolol (3 mg kg-1) S.C. twice daily and in litter-mates treated with saline (controls). 2. Full-thickness 0.5 micrometers sections of the left ventricular wall were point-counted in 200 micrometers steps. In the controls the capillary 'volume density' decreased progressively below the epicardial surface from a value of 9% to reach a minimum of 7.1% at a depth of 2.5 mm. Capillary density then increased again towards the endocardium, reaching a maximum of 11.5% in the trabeculae carnae (depth 3.5 mm). 3. In the treated animals the capillary density was increased in the mid wall at 2.3 and 2.5 mm, but significantly decreased in the trabeculae at 3.7 mm (P less than 0.05). 4. A more detailed analysis was undertaken at depths of 0.7 (Epi), 2.3 (Endo) and 3.5 mm (Trab), comprising estimates of capillary number, capillary diameter and intercapillary distance, via the stereological parameters of mean intercept length and mean free distance. 5. In the controls the order was Epi greater than Trab greater than Endo for number, Trab greater than Endo greater than Epi for diameter and Endo greater than Epi greater than Trab for intercapillary distance. 6. In the treated rabbits the mean intercapillary distance was significantly reduced in the epicardial (by 17.5%, P less than 0.05) and endocardial zones (by 32%, P less than 0.005), but was not significantly altered (+3.7%, P greater than 0.05) in the trabeculae. 7. The non-uniform distribution of capillaries in the controls illustrates that detection of changes in transmural capillary density requires that the depth of samples be measured from the epicardial surface and not, owing to the presence of trabeculae carnae, from the endocardium. 8. If similar treatment effects were to occur in man, they would suggest that prolonged beta-blockade could induce an increase in capillary density which would render the ventricular mid wall less susceptible to ischaemia.", 
    "21": "In a multicenter, single-blind, interpatient study, 103 outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were given, after 2 weeks of placebo wash-out, 160 mg oxprenolol slow-release in fixed combination with chlorthalidone (20 mg per tablet) (SROC 160) once daily or conventional oxprenolol (80 mg) in fixed combination with chlorthalidone (10 mg per tablet) (COC 80) twice daily for 8 weeks. Throughout the study 22 of 51 patients on SROC 160 and 24 of 51 on COC 80 received 1 tablet once daily and, respectively, 1 tablet twice daily. The remaining patients of both groups double the corresponding dosage after the first 4 weeks. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased on both treatments without and difference observed between the groups. Diastolic blood pressure normalization was achieved in both groups in the same number of patients (35). Minor side effects occurred on both treatments: only one patient on SROC 160 interrupted the study due to severe dizziness and fatigue. The advantages are discussed as regards patient's compliance with administration of fixed combination SROC 160 once daily in treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "22": "The effect of the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker, metoprolol, on ventilatory function was studied in eight asthmatic patients in relation to the plasma level of the agent following its administration in ordinary and slow-release tablets. Metoprolol causes a slight decrease in ventilatory function as compared with placebo. The effect was most pronounced after administration of 200 mg in ordinary tablets, which induced the highest plasma levels. After administration of 200 mg in slow-release tablets the plasma levels were lower and the ventilatory effect was less marked. The bronchial obstruction largely improved after administration of the beta 2-receptor stimulating agent terbutaline. This study indicates, that when a larger dose of metoprolol is used in patients with obstructive lung disease, slow-release durules are to be preferred to ordinary tablets.", 
    "23": "Serum thyroid hormone concentrations were measured before and during 6 months treatment with propranolol (160 mg/day) in eight patients with T3 (triiodothyronine) toxicosis. Serum total T3 concentrations showed a significant (p less than 0.01) and sustained fall to approximately 80% of pre-treatment values. Six of the patients, however, remained clinically and biochemically hyperthyroid and our data do not support the use of propranolol as sole therapy in T3 toxicosis.", 
    "24": "The effect of propranolol on the anaerobic threshold was studied in six healthy male volunteers. The subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer in a progressive exercise test to exhaustion with propranolol or no drug. Power output was increased by 30 W ever 2 min. Propranolol caused a significant reduction of heart rate by 20-45 beats per minute at all power outputs. In light and moderate exercise, no differences in oxygen uptake, ventilation, or blood lactate were observed in the propranolol and no-drug tests. The anaerobic threshold was not different between the no-drug (2.32 +/- 0.19 L O2/min, mean +/J- SD) and the propranolol (2.83 +/- 0.27 L O2/min) test; however, the heart rate at the anaerobic threshold was significantly lower in the propranolol (143 +/- 13 beats per minute) than the no-drug (187 +/- 9 beats per minute) tests. Above the anaerobic threshold, oxygen uptake was similar at a given power output but it reached a lower peak value (p less than 0.02) in the propranolol (3.16 +/- 0.16 L O2/min) versus the no-drug (3.64 +/- 0.39 L O2/min) tests. It was concluded that propranolol caused no change in anaerobic threshold in this specific progressive exercise protocol. The results suggest that a training intensity for endurance exercise bases on the anaerobic threshold does not need to be modified for subjects on propranolol medication.", 
    "25": "Tumour-bearing mice spontaneously lose weight 8-9 weeks after implantation of a human hypernephroma, in spite of a normal food intake. Resting oxygen consumption was up to 40% higher in these animals than in sham-operated controls, but was significantly reduced by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol in the former group. The injection of noradrenaline caused a marked stimulation of the metabolic rate in all the animals, but the greatest response was seen in the cachectic mice. The brown-adipose-tissue mass was similar for both groups, but guanosine diphosphate binding to brown-adipose-tissue mitochondria (an index of thermogenic capacity) was significantly increased in tumor-bearing mice, and the injection of noradrenaline 1 h prior to sacrifice caused the greatest stimulation of binding in the cachectic group. These data suggest that the rapid weight loss of tumor-bearing animals may be due to a high metabolic rate which results from sympathetic stimulation of brown-adipose-tissue metabolism. The relevance of these results to cancer-induced cachexia in man is discussed.", 
    "26": "The Sartorius absorption simulator was used as a device to detect possible in vivo gastrointestinal tract drug interactions. The drugs chosen were propranolol hydrochloride and two diuretics (namely hydrochlorothiazide and frusemide) commonly used in conjunction with propranolol hydrochloride for the treatment of hypertension. The results show that the presence of both diuretics increased the intestinal absorption rate constant and the percentage diffused of propranolol hydrochloride. Moreover, the presence of propranolol hydrochloride also caused the intestinal absorption rate constants and the percentages diffused of both diuretics to be increased.", 
    "27": "Experiments on 176 cats with experimental myocardial infarction were made to study alterations in ouabain tolerance under pharmacological effects on extracardial innervation. It was shown that elimination of sympathetic innervation at different levels by benzohexonium, ornid and anapriline, as well as its relative weakening by proserine favoured the correction of hypersensitivity to ouabain in acute myocardial ischemia. Potentiation of sympatic effects by ephedrine and abolition of parasympathetic innervation by atropine increased ouabain cardiotoxicity.", 
    "28": "The effects of intravenous injections of isoproterenol (0.5-2 microgram) on the responses of carotid body chemoreceptor afferents and on integrated phrenic activity were investigated in twelve anesthetized and three decerebrate, unanesthetized cats. All animals were paralyzed and artificially ventilated. Isoproterenol stimulated carotid chemoreceptor activity and this stimulation was augmented by both hypoxia and hypercapnia. Following an injection of isoproterenol, the ratio of the minute phrenic activity relative to mean carotid chemoreceptor activity was increased. Thus, the stimulation of inspiratory phrenic output exceeded the stimulation of the chemoreceptor afferent input, and the peripheral chemoreflex activity does not account for the entire ventilatory response. To distinguish between a direct effect of isoproterenol and a possible secondary effect mediated via an increased venous return and an increased PaCO2, the latencies of the response of carotid chemoreceptors to both isoproterenol and hypercapnia were compared before and after carbonic anhydrase inhibition by acetazolamide. After acetazolamide, the latency of the response to hypercapnia increased from 3.5 sec to 8 sec whereas the latency of response to isoproterenol increased less, from 4.7 sec to 6.3 sec. Thus, isoproterenol stimulation was not mediated by CO2-H+. Propanolol, which blocked the systemic vascular effect, only partially blocked the chemoreceptor stimulation caused by isoproterenol, indicting that the effect of isoproterenol on chemoreceptor activity was not due to systemic cardiovascular changes.", 
    "29": "In dogs transferred from room temperature to a low temperature of 1 +/- (SD) 3.5 degree C, the plasma norepinephrine (NE) level increased significantly. Urine concentration decreased in the cold, in the intact and similarly in the chronically denervated kidney. After return to a warm environment urine concentration improved in both kidneys while plasma NE remained elevated. The data speak against an essential role of the renal function to ambient cold.", 
    "30": "The effect of oral propranolol on left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular volumes, cardiac output, and segmental wall motion was assessed with multigated blood pool imaging both at rest and during supine exercise in 15 patients with angina pectoris. Propranolol had no effect on resting left ventricular ejection fractions. Before propranolol, they did not change during exercise, whereas after propranolol the ejection fractions increased slightly. Exercise left ventricular ejection fractions increased with propranolol in three patients with resting left ventricular ejection fractions of less than 40 per cent. More specifically, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index, stroke volume index, and cardiac index were not altered significantly at rest or during exercise by propranolol. Exercise left ventricular ejection fractions were increased in five and unchanged in eight patients by propranolol. Those patients with increases in left ventricular ejection fractions had a greater change in left ventricular end-diastolic volume indices and a greater change in left ventricular end-systolic volume indices during exercise while on propranolol. Left ventricular segmental wall motion was not altered significantly during exercise by propranolol. We conclude that: (1) Left ventricular functional responses to propranolol during exercise are heterogeneous and not easily predicted; (2) propranolol causes no consistent deterioration in exercise left ventricular ejection fraction even in patients with resting ventricular ejection fractions less than 40 per cent; (3) increased exercise left ventricular ejection fraction with propranolol is contributed to by significant increases in end-diastolic volume during exercise; and (4) gated blood pool imaging is a useful method for characterising rest and exercise left ventricular ejection fractions and left ventricular volumes during propranolol therapy.", 
    "31": "Continuous intra-arterial blood pressure recordings during motor car driving were performed in 15 patients with untreated essential hypertension, using the \"Oxford\" recording technique. Each subject was an experienced driver who used his car every day, and for the study drove from his work place to the hospital during the later afternoon. This drive took place in urban traffic and the average duration was 20.9 minutes. Blood pressure during car driving was remarkably stable, and the average systolic and diastolic pressures were similar to the mean daytime pressure. After 16 weeks of treatment with oxprenolol each patient was restudied. Blood pressure during driving had dropped from 176/107 to 160/93 mmHg, but the blood pressure response to driving and blood pressure variation during driving (expressed as the coefficient of variation) were unchanged. After treatment, the mean daytime systolic pressure was lower than the mean pressure during driving, but the relative antihypertensive effect during driving was similar to that observed in the same patients during dynamic exercise on a bicycle ergometer. No drug-induced side effects occurred and there were no apparent effects on driving ability. Chronic treatment with oxprenolol reduced blood pressure during car driving without affecting the normal blood pressure response to driving.", 
    "32": "The right ventricular repolarisation phase was studied electrophysiologically after an injection of 15 mg metoprolol in 16 healthy volunteers. Eight of them were restudied after chronic treatment with 400 mg metoprolol daily for five weeks. The assessment of the repolarisation time included ventricular effective refractory periods, monophasic action potential duration, and the QT interval measured during atrial stimulation at different driving frequencies. The acute administration of 15 mg metoprolol intravenously had no detectable effect on the repolarisation phase, while chronic treatment caused a significant increase of the ventricular effective refractory periods, monophasic action potential duration, and the QT interval during atrial stimulation. Thus the study confirmed the contrasting effect of acute and chronic beta-receptor blockade on the ventricular repolarisation time in man.", 
    "33": "The effect of slow oxprenolol on plasma lipoprotein concentrations was compared to that of combined therapy with slow oxprenolol and cyclopenthiazide. The design of the study was a double blind between patient investigation in which 9 subjects with mild hypertension received slow oxprenolol and 11 slow oxprenolol and cyclopenthiazide. Plasma lipoproteins were analysed at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. Slow oxprenolol given alone resulted in a significant rise in plasma and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration whereas combined therapy with slow oxprenolol and cyclopenthiazide produced significant rises in plasma and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride. If one accepts that a rise in plasma or LDL cholesterol increases atherogenic risk more than a rise in plasma or VLDL triglyceride combined therapy is preferable.", 
    "34": "Changes of regional myocardial perfusion before and after administration of Atenolol (AT) (5 mg i.v.) were investigated by 201-Tl stress-imaging in 14 patients (PAT) with greater than or equal to 70% coronary obstructions. Scintigrams were performed in 4 projections (AP, 30 degree LAO, 60 degrees LAO, left lateral); scintigraphic defects (SD) in one of the 6 LV segments (anterior, apical, inferior, septal, lateral, posterior) had to be identified in at least 2 projections and to show a decrease of activity greater than or equal to 25%. All PAT had at least one reversible SD.", 
    "35": "After AT, stress, induced SDs were unchanged in 11 of the 14 PAT at identical work loads (131 Watt). The total number of reversible defects was 33 before and 28 after AT (n.s.). However, not only the 3 PAT with improved stress scintigrams, but also 6 of the 11 PAT with unchanged abnormal stress scintigrams were clinically improved (ECG normalized, no angina). Thus in almost half of the patients (6/14), the stress ECG was normalized without normalization of perfusion pattern of thallium scintigrams. We conclude that in these patients subendocardial perfusion was enough improved to meet the reduced metabolic needs, but not enough to normalize stress images.", 
    "36": "In the acute stage of transmural myocardial infarction, 22 patients ranging in age from 34 to 76 (mean 61.6) were given propranolol- because of its alleged myocardium-protecting properties - intravenously at a dosage of 0.03 to 0.1 mg/kg body weight under conditions of continuous hemodynamic control. Subsequently, the influence of digoxin, administered i. v. at a dosage of 0.01 my/kg body weight, on the negative-inotropic propranolol effects was examined. A hemodynamic comparison was made of the effects of propranolol before and after digitalis administration. In patients with compensated cardiac function (group 1, 16 patients), the propranolol-induced drop in the left ventricular stroke-work-index and rise in the left-ventricular filling pressure was completely compensated again by digitalis. The frequency-decreasing propranolol effect was nor influenced by digitalis. In patients with cardiac decompensation (group 2, 6 patients) digitalis only led to a renewed compensation of the left-ventricular stroke-work-index, the rise of the left-ventricular filling pressure remained unaffected. It follows from that, in cases of myocardial infarction without cardial decompensation, propranolol requires concomitant digitalisation. In cases of already existent myocardial insufficiency, propranolol can produce an unfavorable increase of the decompensation signs.", 
    "37": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol in plasma is presented. The method involves plasma extraction at basic pH with ethyl column, and fluorescence detection. The within-run a reversed-phase column coefficient of variation were 3.0-7.1% for propranolol and 5.8-8.3% for 4-hydroxypropranolol. The day-to-day variations were 4.6 and 8.2% for propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol, respectively. The method can detect 1 ng of each compound/ml of plasma.", 
    "38": "1. The immediate haemodynamic and metabolic effects of intravenous administration of DL-propranolol and D-propranolol were studied in healthy male subjects at rest and during dynamic forearm exercise. The dose of DL-propranolol and of D-propranolol was 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg body weight respectively. 2. DL-Propranolol reduced heart rate significantly at rest, during forearm exercise and post-exercise, whereas D-propranolol had a lesser effect on heart rate which was significant only at the end of the exercise period. Arterial blood pressure and forearm blood flow were unchanged after either drug. 3. Both drugs reduced the release of lactate from the exercising forearm. Forearm exchange of oxygen, glucose, free fatty acids and triglycerides remained unchanged. 4. The arterial blood glucose concentration increased after D-propranolol, but was unchanged after DL-propranolol. The arterial serum free fatty acid concentration decreased after DL-propranolol, but was not changed after D-propranolol. Arterial concentrations of lactate and triglycerides were not influenced by the drugs. 5. The chronotropic response to beta-adrenoceptor blockade appears to be stereoselective, suggesting specific blockade of beta-adrenoceptors. Metabolic responses to beta-adrenoceptor blockade are difficult to explain in terms of the known adrenoceptor system and may be due to non-specific actions of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. An exception is inhibition of lipolysis, which is probably mediated via beta-adrenoceptors.",

It is reported to be almost universally successful and to cause only minor complications. We describe a patient in whom this technique lead to purulent pericarditis (Staphylococcus aureus) requiring pericardiectomy.", 
    "40": "Central haemodynamic changes and regional blood flow were studied using the microsphere technique, during labetalol-induced hypotension in dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbitone and fentanyl. Labetalol 15 mg kg-1 decreased mean arterial pressure from an average of 88 mm Hg to 47 mm Hg. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure was unchanged. Cardiac output was reduced by decrease in stroke volume, while heart rate remained unchanged. Myocardial blood flow decreased approximately in parallel with left ventricular work. Perfusion of the brain and kidneys was unchanged.", 
    "41": "The role of coronary muscarinic receptors in the distribution of transmural blood flow across the left ventricular wall of the working heart was studied in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Tissue blood flow in subepicardium, midmyocardium, and subendocardium was determined with radioactive microspheres before and during activation of muscarinic vasodilator receptors by intracoronary infusions of acetylcholine. Myocardial and coronary vascular beta-receptors were blocked by sotalol (2.0 mg/kg iv). Equivalent submaximal coronary vasodilator doses of acetylcholine and adenosine were compared for effects on transmural blood flow. Intracoronary infusions of acetylcholine (5.0 and 10.7 micrograms/min) produced a dose-related increase in the subendocardial-subepicardial blood flow ratio (endo/epi) from 1.07 to 1.32 and 1.57, respectively. A progressively larger decrease in coronary vascular resistance occurred in the subendocardium than midmyocardium or subepicardium following acetylcholine administration. In contrast, intracoronary administration of adenosine (54.4 micrograms/min) produced no change in endo/epi. Atropine effectively blocked acetylcholine-induced coronary vasodilation but not vasodilation produced by adenosine. Neither agent affected heart rate, left ventricular pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, or myocardial contractility. These results suggest that activation of muscarinic coronary vasodilator receptors redistributes blood flow preferentially to the subendocardium independent of cardiac mechanical influences.", 
    "42": "Elevation of blood pressure induced by an acute sodium and fluid load in the anephric state has been attributed to intravascular fluid volume expansion. The present experiments were designed to study the role of vasopressin and catecholamines in this type of hypertension. Normotensive anephric rats, adrenergically intact or pretreated with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, and deoxycorticosterone (DOC)-salt-treated anephric rats, intact or pretreated with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, received an infusion of 2 ml containing 3 meq NaCl, followed by intravenous administration of an analogue antagonist of the vasopressor effect of arginine-vasopressin (AVP). Pressure increments induced by hypertonic saline were abolished by an AVP antagonist partly in the adrenergically intact animals (leaving a small residual pressure elevation) and completely in adrenergically blocked animals, which had a larger AVP component. Volumes expansion did not necessarily accompany increase in blood pressure after saline infusion. In fact some DOC-salt-treated animals with the highest blood pressures and norepinephrine levels exhibited contraction of plasma volume. Increments in blood pressure were negatively correlated with plasma volume changes (r = -0.687, P less than 0.05) in these animals and positively with norepinephrine levels in all adrenergically intact animals (r = 0.818, P less than 0.001). It is concluded that the hypertensive response elicited by acute hypertonic saline load is due to vasoconstriction mediated partly by vasopressin and partly by the sympathetic system, which may in some way attenuate the effect of vasopressin.", 
    "43": "Left ventricular stroke volume decreases during inspiratory efforts whether lung volume is actually increasing as in normal inspiration or whether it remains constant as in a Mueller Maneuver (M.M.). Explanations have included phase lag between lung volume changes and left ventricular volume changes during inspiration as well as increased capacity of pulmonary vessels due to inflation. The capacitance changes could not be used to explain stroke volume (SV) fall in Mueller Maneuvers where lung volume is constant. The increased negative pleural pressure may be responsible for increases in right heart volume due to increased venous return. This mechanism has also been suggested as one of the causes of the fall in left ventricular stroke volume by ventricular interdependence due to changes in left ventricular pressure/volume (P/V) relations, i.e., compliance. In all these explanations a decrease in left ventricular diastolic filling and decreased diastolic pressure is assumed. The fact that decreases in pleural pressure may also act like an increase in left ventricular afterload and impede outflow, thereby decreasing stroke volume, has not been generally considered. We found that left ventricular stroke volume can still decrease without a decrease in left ventricular filling and even when increases in venous return have been prevented (right-heart bypass, i.e., constant pulmonary inflow). Thus the fall in stroke volume during inspiratory effort appears to be caused by a variety of factors, among which increased left ventricular afterload must be considered of primary importance. In addition, decreased left ventricular diastolic compliance due to increased right ventricular (RV) volume also has to be considered (interdependence).", 
    "44": "Doxorubicin [Adriamycin (ADM), a potent intercalating antineoplastic agent, occasionally causes severe local skin toxicity if extravasated during administration. Previous experiments using intradermal (i.d.) ADM in BALB/c mice have shown limited antidotal activity for local i.d. corticosteroids in preventing ADM-induced ulceration and no effect for a number of other compounds except beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Three sequences of i.d. administration of beta-adrenergics were evaluated in this study: a single dose immediately after 0.05 or 0.5 mg ADM; 8 daily doses of isoproterenol (ISO) or 0.9% NaCl solution, 0.05 ml after ADM; and 5 days of pre-ADM to ostensibly \"up\" or \"down\"-regulate beta-receptor number (with propranolol and ISO, respectively). The results demonstrate consistent antidotal activity for ISO and propranolol as single antidotal injections. Terbutaline, a beta 2-specific agonist, was not effective as an antidote. Continuous daily ISO did not improve results, whereas continuous i.d. NaCl solution significantly increased skin lesion size and duration. ISO pretreatment significantly decreased subsequent ADM-induced ulceration, while propranolol pretreatment was not different from control. The results confirm a role for beta-adrenergics in the management of experimental ADM skin ulceration and suggest that local toxicity is mediated through specific beta-receptors (possibly beta 1) in the mouse skin.", 
    "45": "A radioimmunoassay (RIA) for serum 3,5-diiodothyronine (3,5-T2) was developed using small Sephadex G 25 (fine) columns. Prior to the RIA an alcohol extraction of 3,5-T2 from serum and an evaporation of the extract was performed. The recovery of 3,5-T2 added to serum was in mean (plus or minus SEM) 101 plus or minus 11%. The lower detection limit was 0.012 pmol/column corresponding to 14 pmol/l using 3 ml serum. Due to a 5% cross-reaction of 3,5-T2 antibody with 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) individual correction for T3 present in serum was necessary. Serum 3,5-T2 levels in 52 \u00e9uthyroid controls were (mean plus or minus SD) 105 plus or minus 51 pmol/l. Serum levels were higher in men (125 plus or minus 56 pmol/l. Serum levels were higher in men (125 plus or minus 56 pmol/l) than in women (84 plus or minus 34 pmol/l, P less than 0.005). In 17 hyperthyroid subjects serum 3,5-T2 levels were elevated (232 plus or minus 187 pmol/l, P less than 0.005). In hypothyroid patients and patients with non-toxic goitre serum 3,5-T2 levels did not differ significantly from control values, whereas 8 patients with liver cirrhosis had severely reduced serum 3,5-T2 concentrations (20 plus or minus 23 pmol/l, P less than 0.001).", 
    "46": "The effects of alcohol consumed during an evening party on the metabolism and response of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs were investigated in healthy subjects. The drugs were given 12 hr after the first drink. The plasma clearance rate of propranolol, metabolized in the liver, increased, while that of sotalol, which is eliminated unchanged, was reduced. Plasma propranolol levels, but not those of sotalol, were related to blood alcohol content. The blood pressure-reducing effect of propranolol diminished after alcohol and that of sotalol increased. Both drugs reduced the heart rate after alcohol although they were unable to cancel out entirely the alcohol-induced increase in the heart rate. The results show that drinking may alter the metabolism of beta-blocking drugs. Drinking habits must be considered in therapy with beta-blocking drugs or when seeking reasons for angina pectoris or arterial hypertension that does not respond to therapy.", 
    "47": "We used first-pass radionuclide angiocardiography to assess filling fraction during the first third of diastole, peak filling rate and peak filling rate during the first third of diastole as indexes of left ventricular diastolic performance at rest and after upright bicycle exercise in 32 normal patients and 68 patients with coronary artery disease. The mean filling fraction was unchanged from rest to exercise in normal patients (47+/- 15% vs 46 +/- 13%; NS). Even in 49 coronary patients with normal (greater than or equal to 50%) ejection fraction at rest, filling fraction was less than that in normal patients at rest (35 +/- 11% vs 47 +/- 15%, p less than 0.001). Despite similar resting heart rates, patients with coronary disease had lower (p less than 0.001) peak filling rate and peak filling rate during the first third of diastole than normal patients. With exercise, filling fraction decreased (p less than 0.001) from the resting value in coronary patients. These data suggest that (1) indexes of diastolic performance can be noninvasively assessed at rest and during exercise using first-pass radionuclide angiocardiography, (2) abnormalities in early diastolic performance are often present at rest in patients with coronary artery disease despite normal systolic performance, and (3) exercise-induced ischemia results in increased early diastolic dysfunction in patients with coronary disease.", 
    "48": "The linearity and sensitivity of the end-systolic pressure-volume (P-Ves) relation to the inotropic state of the left ventricle were investigated in 11 patients with coronary heart disease and one patient with congestive cardiomyopathy. To minimize autonomic reflex responses, propranolol, 0.15 mg/kg, and atropine, 1 mg, were administered i.v. at the beginning of the study. Three ventriculograms were performed: at rest, after oral isosorbide dinitrate, 10 mg (systolic pressure decrease greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg), and during infusion of methoxamine, 2 mg/min (systolic pressure increase greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg). The three points of the Pv-Ves relation showed linearity (r greater than or equal to 0.96). The relation between the slope k of the P-Ves relation and the left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was best described by an exponential function (r = 0.94). The use of peak systolic pressure instead of end-systolic pressure showed equally good results. The intercept of the P-Ves line on the abscissa, which represents the theoretical end-systolic volume at zero pressure, was not related to the ejection fraction under control conditions. The P-Ves relation in postextrasystolic beats was displaced toward the left (smaller end-systolic volumes) and became steeper.", 
    "49": "A chronic, unanesthetized cat preparation was used as an experimental model for the study of cardiovascular response to static exercise. Seven cats were operantly conditioned to hold a bar with their right forelimb against increasing resistance for 15 seconds. The exercise regimen lasted from 3 to 6 months. The cats were instrumented with a left ventricular pressure transducer and a left atrial catheter. With exercise, heart rate (HR, + 10%), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP, + 16%), and maximal rate of pressure development (LV dp/dt, + 15%) increased significantly. The rise in HR began prior to the onset of exercise and reached peak in less than 5 seconds and then decreased to preexercise levels, although LVSP and LV dp/dt remained elevated during exercise. The magnitude of the LVSP response (range 23 to 31 mmHg) was constant after 2 weeks of training even though the exercise intensity was increased 200 g to 700 g. After 3 months of training, the cats were exercised at the intensity first observed to induce a significant LVSP response. Peak HR, LVSP, and LV dp/dt were significantly reduced. Selective autonomic blockade with propranolol, atropine, and combined atropine-propranolol was utilized to elucidate the role of the autonomic nervous system in the cardiovascular responses that occur during voluntary static exercise. The increased HR in response to exercise was mediated primarily by the parasympathetic nervous system, whereas the increases in LV max dp/dt were mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "50": "1 Compared with the response of preparations incubated in solutions without clonidine, a three to four fold increase in the magnitude of the contracture of the longitudinal muscle to challenge with phentolamine (1.0 mum) was induced by incubating the guinea-pig isolated ileum at 22 degrees C for 24 h with clonidine (1.0 mum) in Krebs solution containing hexamethonium (70 mum). Incubation of the ileum with clondine (1.0 mum) for 0.5 h at 37 degrees C did not increase responsiveness to phentolamine.2 The increase in responsiveness to phentolamine was directly related to the clonidine concentration in the incubation fluid over the range 0.01 to 1.0 mum.3 The magnitude of the contracture to phentolamine of ilea incubated with clonidine (1.0 mum) (withdrawal contracture) was directly related to the challenge dose of phentolamine over the range 0.3 to 1.0 mum.4 Yohimbine (1.0 mum) or piperoxane (1.0 mum) elicited a response comparable to that elicited by phentolamine but propranolol (1.0 mum) was inactive.5 Addition of phentolamine (1.0 mum) to clonidine (1.0 mum) in the incubation fluid abolished the increased response of the preparation to subsequent challenge with phentolamine.6 Addition of hyoscine (0.5 mum) immediately after challenge with phentolamine restored the tension of the withdrawal contracture to its resting level.7 Tetrodotoxin (3.0 mum) given before challenge, prevented phentolamine from eliciting a withdrawal contracture.8 Ileal segments incubated with clonidine (1.0 mum) were unresponsive to challenge with naloxone (100 nm); and segments incubated with normorphine (1.0 mum) were unresponsive to phentolamine (1.0 mum), although responsive to naloxone.9 Normorphine (1.0 mum) restored to resting level the tension of the clonidine withdrawal contracture; and clonidine (0.1 mum) restored to resting level the tension of the contracture to naloxone in ileal segments incubated with normorphine.10 These experiments indicate that incubation with clonidine induces, in the final cholinergic motor neurones of the myenteric plexus of the isolated ileum, a dependence the withdrawal from which is expressed as a contracture in response to alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists.11 Although opiate receptors are not involved in clonidine dependence nor alpha-adrenoceptors in opiate dependence, the findings that normorphine suppresses the clonidine withdrawal-contracture and that clonidine suppresses the contracture of opiate-dependent ileum to naloxone, suggest that the withdrawal effect studied in both clonidine and normorphine dependence in this preparation is mediated by release of acetylcholine from the final motor neurone.", 
    "51": "A double-masked cross-over comparison of the ocular hypotensive effect in 19 glaucoma patients between timolol 0.5% - a non-selective beta-blocking agent - and metoprolol 3% - a beta 1-selective blocking agent - disclosed a greater pressure lowering effect (mean 9%, median 7% more) with timolol in a treatment period of 1 month. In patients on timolol treatment 47% - 60% of the eyes could be controlled on an IOP level less than 20 mmHg compared to 34% - 47% of the eyes treated with metoprolol. Metoprolol induced a transitory burning sensation in the eyes of 58% patients compared to 26% treated with timolol. Possible signs of dry eyes manifestations as measured by break-up time, rose bengal and fluorescein 1% staining, tear osmolality and Schirmer test I developed in both the timolol (4 patients) and metoprolol (3 patients) treated group. No significant influence on blood pressure and heart rate was observed. In none had the visual field or visual acuity deteriorated at the end of the study.", 
    "52": "The effects of insulin on contractile activity of isolated heart muscle have been studied in the rat's right ventricle. The method of the isolated organ bath was used with Tyrode as perfusion liquid with constant carbogen bubbling. The addition of insulin to the bath (0.3 U/ml) increased the contractile power. Contractility increase, induced by adrenaline and CaCl2, was reduced by insulin. This decrease of adrenaline activity became clearer after partial blocking of beta-receptors with pindolol. Glucose determinations in the bath also showed an insulin-adrenaline antagonism. Insulin behaved as a partial agonist versus adrenaline at the beta-receptors site.", 
    "53": "The literature concerning the clinical and pharmacologic studies of systemically administered timolol in 2233 patients was reviewed. Side effects reported were correlated with dosage levels and estimated plasma levels. Most adverse effects occurred with levels much higher than would be expected after the topical use of timolol to control glaucoma. The table of potential complications and adverse effects seen with the use of systemic timolol is meant to focus attention on expected and unexpected side effects. All could occur and should be looked for with the topical use of this drug. The goal of this paper is to define better what physicians should look for in evaluating the clinical safety of this drug and what can be realistically expected to be seen as the use of this drug becomes more widespread.", 
    "54": "Uptake of 14C-propranolol after a single passage through the pulmonary circulation was studied in three groups of Labrador dogs using a double indicator dilution method. Uptake in conscious, ambulant animals was 53%. This increased to 81% in dogs anaesthetized with thiopentone, nitrous oxide and halothane and to 64% in dogs anaesthetized with thiopentone, nitrous oxide and fentanyl. Interaction between lipid-soluble anaesthetic agents and pulmonary endothelial cell membranes may be an important factor in increasing lung uptake of lipophilic propranolol, although alteration in pulmonary perfusion associated with a reduction in cardiac output during general anaesthesia may play a part. The pharmacological effects of propranolol administered i.v. during general anaesthesia may be unpredictable.", 
    "55": "In an experimental study, 26 mongrel dogs were treated with alloxan (50 mg per kilogram) to induce fasting hyperglycemia and diabetes. The animals were randomly subdivided into two groups, one of which received 100 mg of propranolol in divided doses for two weeks. The animals underwent sternotomy and were placed on total cardiopulmonary bypass. After aortic cross-clamping, each animal received 10 ml per kilogram of cardioplegic solution. Two different solutions were used, a standard hyperkalemic solution and a high-energy glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) substrate. Baseline studies were made on the four groups of diabetic animals. Animals given potassium cardioplegia but no propranolol showed statistically significant decreases in cardiac index, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and minute left ventricular stroke work index after bypass. In contrast, animals given GIK cardioplegia but no propranolol showed no changes in any of these measurements. Animals administered propranolol and potassium cardioplegia experienced decrease in mean arterial pressure from 77.5 +/- 14.1 mm Hg before bypass to 57.5 +/- 17.8 mm Hg after bypass. A similar reduction occurred in animals given propranolol and GIK cardioplegia. However, in this group, the cardiac index increased from 1.78 +/- 0.38 L/min/m2 before bypass to 2.96 +/- 0.73 L/min/m2 after bypass (p less than .006). Similarly, the minute left ventricular stroke work index increased after bypass in these animals. This study demonstrates the protective effect against myocardial ischemia of the addition of substrate to the cardioplegic solution in diabetic animals subjected to aortic cross-clamping during cardiopulmonary bypass, one group receiving propranolol and one group not receiving it.", 
    "56": "Eighty-five patients receiving long-term propranolol therapy were randomized after aorta-coronary bypass grafting either to receive minidose propranolol (Group I) or to serve as controls (Group II). They were compared with 18 patients (Group III) who did not receive beta blocking agents prior to operation but were given propranolol postoperatively. Poor-risk patients (those having left ventricular aneurysms, low ejection fraction, or congestive heart failure) as well as patients who required catecholamines postoperatively were included in the study. All three groups were comparable with respect to all risk factors. Propranolol (5 to 10 mg/6 hr) was started through a nasogastric tube 6 hours after operation and continued orally in all patients in Groups I and III. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia appeared in two of 37 patients in Group I (5%), 19 of 48 patients in Group II (40%), and five of 18 patients in Group III (27%). The incidence of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia was significantly lower in Group I than in Groups II and III (p less than 0.001, Group I versus Group II; p less than 0.01, Group I versus Group III). In conclusion, low-dose propranolol is very effective in preventing supraventricular tachyarrhythmia following aorta-coronary bypass in patients receiving beta blockers preoperatively. The increased tendency for postoperative supraventricular tachyarrhythmia to develop in these patients is attributed to hypersensitivity to adrenergic stimulation after propranolol withdrawal. The tachyarrhythmia can be prevented by early reinstitution of propranolol in low doses after the operation.", 
    "57": "Eighteen patients with Prinzmetal's angina were studied angiographically and 17 were followed for an average of 27 months. The were 12 men and six women, with a mean age of 46.3 years. The mean duration of symptoms before clinical diagnosis was 4.1 weeks. Four had had a previous myocardial infarction. Six patients had spontaneous cardiac arrests within 48 hours of diagnosis and hospital admission. At coronary arteriography, 10 patients had significant coronary artery disease; two of these had coronary artery spasm. The remaining eight patients had normal cornary arteries with significant coronary artery spasm at arteriography. Angiographic mitral valve prolapse was found in eight patients; seven of these had inferior ST segment elevation with pain. Six of the 10 patients with significant coronary artery disease had aortocoronary bypasses performed with good results. Ten of the remaining 11 patients who were treated medically had their symptoms controlled with oral isosorbide dinitrate alone or in combination with propranolol, nifedipine or perhexiline but propranolol may have an adverse effect. Though the initial clinical course in untreated patients was unfavourable, progress after starting treatment was good, with no further cardiac arrests, myocardial infarctions, or deaths.", 
    "58": "Between January 1975 and December 1978, a total of 67 consecutive patients with left main coronary disease had coronary bypass operations at Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. Of these, 54 were men and 13 women. The mean age was 59 years (range 44 to 77 years). Three groups were identified retrospectively. Sex ratio, age, symptoms, and coronary pathology and hemodynamics were comparable in all groups. Group 1 (24 patients) received no propranolol or had it discontinued at least two weeks preoperatively. Group 2 (28 patients) received propranolol up until two days before the operation. Group 3 (15 patients) received propranolol until the morning of the bypass operation. The overall mortality was 2.9 percent (2 patients). In Group 1, 33 percent (8 patients) had unstable angina preoperatively, while 50 percent (14 patients) in group 2 and 40 percent (6 patients) in group 3 had unstable angina. Perioperative infarction occurred in 12.5 percent (3 patients) in group 1, 25 percent (7 patients) in group 2 and 13 percent (2 patients) in group 3. Creatine phosphokinase myocardial band fractions in the postoperative period were lowest in group 3 but were notably elevated in group 2. Postoperative inotropic support was required in one patient (4 percent) in group 1, four patients (14 percent) in group 2, while none required support in group 3. The decreased incidence of perioperative infarction and reduced need for postoperative inotropic support in group 3 suggests that if propranolol is to be part of the pharmacological preoperative regimen, it can and should be continued up to the time of operation. Propranolol should not be discontinued in the immediate preoperative period.", 
    "59": "Supraventricular tachydysrhythmia is a bothersome and potentially harmful occurrence after coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG). Use of digoxin prophylaxis preoperatively has yielded conflicting results in lowering the incidence of supraventricular tachydysrhythmia. In this study, three groups of patients were formed. Group 1 served as the control; no prophylactic medication was given. Group 2 was given digoxin prophylaxis beginning immediately after operation. Group 3 received digoxin postoperatively as did Group 2, plus orally administered propranolol beginning on postoperative day 2. No difference in the incidence of supraventricular tachydysrhythmia was found between Groups 1 and 2 (28.2% versus 28.9%). However, the incidence in Group 3 was 2.2%, and this represented a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.005) compared with either Group or 2. The combined use of digoxin and propranolol postoperatively significantly reduced the incidence of supraventricular tachydysrhythmia after CABG."
