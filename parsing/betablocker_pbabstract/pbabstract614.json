    "0": "Nadolol protein binding was measured in serum from 95 healthy subjects. Binding was found to range between 4 and 27%, with a mean of 14 +/- 4% (s.d.). There was a small but significant correlation found between the degree of nadolol binding and the serum alpha-1-acid glycoprotein concentration. However it was concluded that changes in the serum protein binding of nadolol were unlikely to give rise to any untoward clinical effects.", 
    "1": "Propranolol was infused in SHR subcutaneously for 7 days at two concentrations (either 3.75 or 7.5 mg kg-1 day) via a minipump. Mean blood pressure and heart rate measured under pentobarbitone anaesthesia on day 7 after implantation showed a significant dose-dependent decrease in both propranolol-treated groups. In the low-dose propranolol-treated rats, there was no change in contractile responses to phenylephrine over controls. In rats receiving the higher dose of propranolol there was a significant increase in the response to phenylephrine. There was no change in the relaxation response of any of the groups to isoprenaline. The results indicate that propranolol, while lowering blood pressure and heart rate, is also modifying the alpha-receptor response of the vascular wall in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.", 
    "2": "The in-vitro lipophilicity of nine beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was evaluated based on retention on a reverse-phase C-18 high-pressure liquid chromatographic (hplc) system at physiologic pH. Propranolol was by far the most lipophilic drug, while atenolol and sotolol were the least. Hplc retention was highly correlated (r = 0.92) with octanol: buffer partition coefficient. Thus hplc retention is a rapid and replicable approach to the determination of in-vitro lipophilicity that does not require radioactive drug.", 
    "3": "A previous trial was completed in 24 patients with coronary heart disease, randomly assigned to a group who undertook a 6-month exercise training programme (5BX/XBX) and a control (no training) group. It was shown that the patients in the training group were able to achieve during exercise a higher heart rate at ST segment depression of 0.1 mV (HR/ST threshold) and that the patients in the control group showed a reduction in the threshold as well as symptomatic deterioration; the results indicated that the training programme had resulted in a reduction in the severity of myocardial ischaemia. In the present trial 9 patients of the previous training group were followed up to examine the effect of long-term maintenance training (up to 4.5 years). The same methods were used to examine the effect of maintenance training in a further group of 8 patients with coronary heart disease, 6 of whom were on beta-blocker therapy. By the end of the study, the heart rate achieved during exercise in the 17 patients was still significantly greater (P less than 0.0004) by 12.1 +/- 2.85 beats/min (mean +/- SEM) than that at the beginning of the trial; similar results were obtained in the 6 patients on beta-blocker therapy. Therefore a maintenance exercise training programme in patients with coronary heart disease can result in a sustained improvement in the form of a reduction in the severity of myocardial ischaemia, and this can occur in patients on beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "4": "Selective beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic blockade was achieved by practolol or IPS 339, respectively, in cats with acute ligation of a coronary artery. During blockade, heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing and blood pressure reduction was prevented by aortic clamping. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured by the distribution of 15 micron labelled microspheres. Practolol slightly reduced epicardial blood flow in ischaemic myocardium, while blood flow in border and normally perfused myocardium remained unchanged. Following IPS 339, myocardial tissue flow increased in normally perfused myocardium, on average by 37% in the endocardium and 30% in the epicardium. No changes occurred in the other regions. The flow changes brought about by IPS 339 were unrelated to haemodynamic changes, and the coronary vascular resistance was reduced. These results are indicative of coronary vasodilation related to beta 2-adrenergic receptor blockade and was confined to well-oxygenated areas surrounding the acutely ischaemic zone.", 
    "5": "The cardiovascular effects of cetamolol, a new beta-adrenoceptor blocker, were studied in the anesthetized dog and cat and in the conscious dog and monkey. The compound was compared with other beta-blockers known to possess various degrees of cardioselectivity, partial agonistic effects, and membrane-stabilizing activity. In the anesthetized open-chest dog, cetamolol and pindolol produced similar cardiovascular effects in that the partial agonistic activity predominated over the blockade of beta-adrenoceptors. The partial agonistic activity of pindolol was greater than that of cetamolol. Unlike pindolol, cetamolol had no significant vasodilating property. However, the beta-blocking effects of these two drugs predominated in the anesthetized closed-chest dog, conscious dog and monkey. Atenolol, nadolol, and propranolol, which lack partial agonistic activity, produced cardiovascular changes characteristic of this type of beta-blocker in the animal preparation in which they were tested. In the anesthetized cat, comparison of the mean effective doses for the heart rate and blood pressure responses induced by isoproterenol showed that cetamolol was more cardioselective than metoprolol but less than acebutolol and atenolol. Evidence of the cardioselectivity of cetamolol was also obtained in the anesthetized closed-chest dog, although the degree of cardioselectivity of both cetamolol and atenolol was less marked than in the cat. When given orally to the conscious dog and monkey, cetamolol appeared to be well absorbed. The peak effect was observed after 1-2 h and persisted for the 5-h test period. It is concluded that cetamolol is a potent beta-blocker with a moderate degree of partial agonistic activity and cardioselectivity in in vivo experiments.", 
    "6": "The effects of propranolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, labetalol, and atenolol on the isoproterenol-stimulated slow calcium current as well as on spontaneous slow calcium and fast sodium currents were studied in frog trabeculae by the double sucrose bridge technique. Administration of beta-adrenoblockers in low doses (10(-7)-10(-6)M) antagonized the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol on the slow calcium current (pindolol greater than oxprenolol greater than or equal to propranolol = labetalol greater than atenolol). When administered in high doses (2 X 10(-6)-10(-4)M) the beta-adrenoblockers reduced the slow calcium current. Meanwhile, some of them (propranolol, oxprenolol, labetalol) suppressed the fast sodium current.", 
    "7": "A Doppler ultrasound technique has been used in six volunteers to determine the effects of intravenous isoprenaline on blood velocity and volume blood flow in the femoral artery and to investigate the effects of single oral doses of atenolol (50 mg) and propranolol (40 mg) on these effects and on heart rate changes. Isoprenaline increased the blood velocity and volume blood flow which was attenuated by propranolol and not by atenolol; the tachycardia of isoprenaline was inhibited by both drugs. The results show that the Doppler ultrasound measurements in the femoral artery can identify pharmacologically induced changes in peripheral blood vessels in the leg and warrants further investigation as a tool to study the pharmacology of peripheral blood vessels in man.", 
    "8": "In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which beta-adrenoceptor blockade leads to a reduction in portal pressure, we have measured portal pressure, heart rate and cardiac index in 17 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension following the oral administration of the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking agent, ICI 118551, in the two dosage ranges 10-20 mg and 50-100 mg. There was a fall in portal pressure in 14 of the 17 patients from a median of 17 mm Hg to a median of 15 mm Hg, P less than 0.01, that occurred only at 60 min following administration of the drug. Although there were early systemic haemodynamic changes, with a significant fall in heart rate and cardiac index from before to 30 min after the ingestion of ICI 118551 (median heart rates 86 and 80 beats/min respectively, P less than 0.01, median cardiac indices 3.5 and 3.31 min-1 m-2, P less than 0.05), these occurred before the fall in portal pressure and were unrelated to changes in portal pressure. This reduction in portal pressure independent of systemic haemodynamic changes is consistent with beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade within the splanchnic and hepatic arterial circulations; subsequent increases in splanchnic and hepatic arterial resistances with a concomitant fall in portal blood flow and hepatic portal resistance may lead to the reduction in portal pressure.", 
    "9": "In patients with normal-renin, mild (n = 6) or moderate (n = 6) hypertension, the antihypertensive effects of propranolol (80 mg/day) for 1 day or for 2 weeks were evaluated in relation to the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade induced. A significant and similar fall in systolic blood pressure was observed after 1 day and 2 weeks on propranolol in both groups of patients. In contrast, diastolic blood pressure showed only a minor decrease after 1 day of therapy (-2 +/- 2 and -3 +/- 1 mm Hg) but a significant drop (-7 +/- 3 and -9 +/- 3 mm Hg) after 2 weeks in the mild and moderate hypertension groups, respectively. Plasma propranolol levels and decreases in resting heart rate and PRA were similar after 1 day and 2 weeks of treatment. Isoprenaline dose-response curves for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and PRA showed similar parallel shifts after 1 day and 2 weeks of treatment. The effect of graded bicycle exercise on these parameters were also similarly blunted. These results indicate that over time, systolic blood pressure decreases rapidly whereas diastolic blood pressure shows a delayed fall following initiation of low-dose propranolol therapy, despite the same degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "10": "The effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade on the systemic and pulmonary circulation during i.v. bolus injection of sub-seizure doses of lidocaine and bupivacaine were studied in dogs anesthetized with nitrous oxide. Pretreatment with hexamethonium or propranolol produced a marked decrease in cardiac output (CO), although pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine inhibited the decrease in CO during i.v. administration of lidocaine. Pretreatment with hexamethonium or phenoxybenzamine attenuated the increase in total peripheral resistance (TPR) following lidocaine 10 mg/kg i.v. In contrast, the propranolol-treated dogs developed a marked increase in TPR. The increases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) following lidocaine 10 mg/kg i.v. were blocked by pretreatment with hexamethonium. Furthermore, PVR increased markedly with pretreatment with propranolol, although pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine prevented the large increase in PVR. These findings indicate that lidocaine has both a direct depressant effect and an indirect beta adrenergic stimulant effect on the heart. Systemic or pulmonary vasoconstriction following intravenous administration of lidocaine 10 mg/kg is associated primarily with an indirect stimulant effect mediated by alpha-adrenergic mechanisms. Bupivacaine, as well as lidocaine, has an indirect stimulant effect mediated by the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "11": "The epicardial coronary artery plays an important role not only as a conduit artery but also as a locus of coronary spasm. Accordingly, diameter change of the large epicardial coronary artery of the in situ canine heart was continuously measured by ultrasonic dimension gauge technique and the effects of alpha adrenergic stimulation on the caliber were studied. After the intravenous administration of phenylephrine the aortic pressure increased by 28 mmHg, however, the left circumflex coronary artery diameter decreased by 3.4% (p less than 0.01). Norepinephrine and sciatic nerve stimulation after propranolol (1 mg/kg) induced coronary vasoconstriction by 1.3 (p less than 0.025) and 2.5% (p less than 0.05) against the obvious increases of aortic pressure by 16 and 19 mmHg, respectively. Thus alpha adrenergic stimulation, in situ in dogs, was shown to directly constrict the large epicardial coronary artery.", 
    "12": "A new family of beta-blocking drugs is described. The originality of the new molecules lies in their functionalized hydrophobic folded structure, the basic part of which contains a benzocyclobutene ring. Excellent beta 2-blocker selectivity has been obtained with some of these compounds. Interestingly, this selectivity was not modified toward beta 1-blocker activity by introduction of the usual beta 1 inducer groups.", 
    "13": "Three months after colectomy for severe ulcerative colitis, an 18-year-old male presented with a multisystem illness characterized by fever, arthralgias, hypertension, and declining renal function. A diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa was made histologically and confirmed angiographically. Clinical and pathological findings suggest that the patient had 2 separate illnesses. Potential implications of this unique association are briefly discussed.", 
    "14": "A simple, accurate, and rapid high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the analysis of oxprenolol in commercial formulations is described. The analysis was performed on a cyano radial compression cartridge, with 0.0539 M, pH 3 phosphate buffer-acetonitrile-methanol (76: 15.6:8.4) as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 5 mL/min, with detection at 272 nm; the mobile phase was employed for extraction. The assay was applied to the content uniformity test of three oxprenolol hydrochloride tablet formulations of different strengths and the contents of a 2-mg dry ampule for intravenous/intramuscular injection. The percent of label claim for each formulation tested was within 91.7-110%. The applicability of this assay to the analysis of some other beta-blocking drugs was investigated. It was found that under the above conditions, atenolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol, and propranolol can be fully resolved in less than 3 min.", 
    "15": "A 71-year-old woman with icterus was treated with doxycycline orally for one week. She then was admitted for an exploratory laparotomy under general anesthesia with barbiturate, pancuronium, fentanyl, and nitrous oxide. She developed rapid atrial fibrillation and received digitoxin and beta-blockade. Thirty minutes after her last medication she received doxycycline 100 mg in 200 ml sodium chloride 0.9% infused over five to ten minutes. Soon after the completed infusion, she developed a severe anaphylactoid reaction with bronchospasm, hypotension, and generalized urticaria, which was treated successfully with ephedrine, aminophylline, hydrocortisone, furosemide, metaraminol, ketamine, and epinephrine. The possibility of beta-blockade treatment worsening the reaction is discussed and five other reports of anaphylactoid reactions to intravenous doxycycline are mentioned.", 
    "16": "The relative chronotropic and inotropic activity of preferential beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation was investigated in seven healthy male subjects in a randomized within-subject, single-blind study. Two doses of beta 1-selective agonist prenalterol (1 mg/hr or 2 mg/hr) and of beta 2-selective agonist salbutamol (300 micrograms/hr or 600 micrograms/hr) were infused intravenously in four separate sessions, with intervals of at least 48 hr between sessions. At each session cuff blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured and some hemodynamic information on the inotropic state were derived by echocardiography. Both prenalterol and salbutamol induced increases in HR, but tachycardia was greater after salbutamol, whereas the positive inotropic response to beta-stimulation was greater after prenalterol. At comparable HR rises (prenalterol, from 66.0 +/- 5.5 to 72.2 +/- 4 bpm; salbutamol, from 64.6 +/- 6 to 70.0 +/- 7 bpm), inotropic response seemed to be greater after prenalterol than after salbutamol (systolic blood pressure [SBP]: 133.5 +/- 8 and 120.7 +/- 8 mm Hg; mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening [Vcf]: 1.54 +/- 0.13 and 1.31 +/- 0.12 c/s; ejection fraction [EF]: 72.4% +/- 5% and 69.5% +/- 4%; stroke index: 47.4 +/- 4 and 41.7 +/- 3 ml/m2). In presence of a chronotropic effect (HR from 64.6 +/- 6 to 70.0 +/- 7 bpm), the low salbutamol dose did not induce any changes in the indices of inotropism (SBP: from 119.2 +/- 6 to 120.7 +/- 8 mm Hg; mean Vcf: from 1.28 +/- 0.11 to 1.31 +/- 0.12 c/s; EF: from 68.1% +/- 5% to 69.5% +/- 4%; stroke index: from 40.2 +/- 3 to 41.7 +/- 3 ml/m2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "Cetamolol hydrochloride, viz 2-[2-[3-(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino-2-hydroxy-propoxy]phenoxy]-N- methylacetamide hydrochloride, is a potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with moderate cardioselectivity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. In support of ongoing clinical trials, a radioreceptor assay has been developed to measure serum drug levels. In this assay, serum extracts containing cetamolol compete with [3H]-dihydroalprenolol for rat lung binding sites. This method which is sensitive to 1 ng/mL has been validated with respect to stability, blank, specificity, accuracy, within-assay precision, between-assay precision and parallelism. This method has been applied to a preliminary clinical study where serum drug levels were detectable up to 24 h after a single oral dose of 10 or 25 mg cetamolol hydrochloride.", 
    "18": "The efficacy of two beta-receptor antagonists, propranolol and pindolol, was compared with that of a calcium antagonist, verapamil, in the treatment of exertional angina pectoris in 22 men (mean age 51 years). The clinical response and left ventricular function were evaluated with treadmill exercise and with radionuclide ventriculography performed while the patient was at rest or exercising supine with a bicycle ergometer. All the treatments significantly prolonged exercise duration (p less than 0.001) and reduced the number of patients terminating treadmill exercise because of angina (p less than 0.05). The resting heart rate was decreased markedly (p less than 0.001) by propranolol but only slightly (p less than 0.05) by pindolol and verapamil. The left ventricular ejection fraction during rest was unchanged by any treatment, but that during exercise was improved (p less than 0.05) by all the treatments. Patients who failed to gain relief from angina with one of the drugs often responded to another, and adverse reactions occurring with one drug did not necessarily occur with another. In summary, pindolol and verapamil were safe and effective alternatives to propranolol in the treatment of the exertional angina pectoris of these patients.", 
    "19": "Ro 03-7894 (0.6 mM) produced a non-parallel shift to the right of dose-response curves to (-)-isoprenaline in K+ depolarized uterine preparations from the guinea-pig. The displacement of the curves was readily reversed by washing. A rightward shift of similar magnitude was also produced by Ro 03-7894 in transmurally stimulated ileal preparations. The relaxant effects of fenoterol in carbachol-contracted guinea-pig tracheal preparations (in the presence of 2 microM atenolol) were not altered by 0.6 mM Ro 03-7894. In the three tissues there was no evidence of a reduction in the maximal inhibitory response to the agonists. In uterine and tracheal preparations, Ro 03-7894 (0.6 mM) depressed contractile responses to exogenous calcium. The depression of responses was enhanced after washout of Ro 03-7894 for 80 min. Contractile responses of ileal preparations to transmural stimulation were also depressed by Ro 03-7894. Concentration-effect curves for the positive inotropic effects of (-)-isoprenaline in guinea-pig left atrial preparations were markedly shifted to the right and the maximum response depressed by 0.6 mM Ro 03-7894. Although the rightward shift of the curves was fully reversed during the 120 min washout period, the maximal responses remained depressed. In similar experiments, Ro 03-7894 produced a washout-resistant depression of inotropic responses to histamine and calcium. The results of radioligand binding studies in left atria using (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol indicated that, when compared to the untreated atria, there was no reduction in the maximal density of binding sites 120 min after washout of 0.6 mM Ro 03-7894. 5 On the basis of the present results it is concluded that Ro 03-7894 induces a non-specific depressant effect on smooth and cardiac muscle preparations during exposure to the drug. This depressant effect persists following washout of the drug. There is no evidence for an irreversible effect of Ro 03-7894 at beta-adrenoceptor sites.", 
    "20": "The present report analyzes the relative potencies and the mechanism of action of isoprenaline (Iso), isoxsuprine (Isox), terbutaline (Terb) and orciprenaline (Orc) on gravid isolated human myometrium in either spontaneous or in K+-induced contractions. Spontaneous activity was observed in 80% of the strips studied and the rate of contractions was 3.22 +/- 0.21 per 15 min. Dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous contractions was observed with all the agonists. Preincubation with cocaine, 10(-5) M, shifted the inhibitory dose-response curves of Iso and Orc to the left, 16.6- and 23.3-fold respectively. The rank order of relative potencies was: Iso much greater than Isox greater than Terb greater than Orc in the absence and Iso much greater than Isox greater than Orc greater than Terb in the presence of cocaine. In the strips stimulated with K+, 80 mM, Isox, Terb and Orc produced only 20-30% inhibition while Iso was without effect. The incubation with propranolol (10(-8) -10(-4) M) did not modify the inhibitory response produced by Isox, Terb and Orc, but produced a parallel shift to the right of the Iso dose-response curve. Dose-ratio experiments yielded a straight line, and a Schild plot showed a pA2 value of 8.5 +/- 0.26 (slope = 2.76 +/- 0.47). The results with Iso confirm the existence of beta-adrenoreceptors in gravid human myometrium. On the other hand, in view of the low potency of Isox, Terb and Orc, and also the inability of propranolol to block their responses, it is suggested that the relaxant effects of these drugs are not mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "21": "Beta-blocking drugs have provided significant improvement in the medical therapy of many types of heart disease. They are more effective in treating young hypertensive patients than elderly hypertensive patients. These drugs reduce the ventricular rate seen in atrial flutter and fibrillation, and they also reduce the frequency of ventricular ectopy. Beta blockers are important adjuncts for control of angina pectoris. When these drugs are given for a period of 1 to 3 years after myocardial infarction they reduce the incidence of reinfarction and the frequency of sudden death as well as reduce the overall mortality rate. Factors that may contribute to the overall decreased mortality include the reduction in the reinfarction rate and an increased threshold for ventricular fibrillation as well as those mechanisms that reduce myocardial oxygen utilization.", 
    "22": "Functional capacity and cardiovascular responses to serial graded treadmill testing ( GXT ) were compared in 180 patients who performed prescribed unsupervised exercise and 24 patients who were referred for supervised exercise after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS). The groups were men similar in age range, number of bypass grafts, preoperative left ventricular impairment and number of days hospitalized. All patients received similar predischarge exercise monitoring and began a progressive home walking or cycling program. Initial GXT (T1) was performed 44 +/- 9 days postoperatively. Both groups were instructed to continue prescribed exercise at 75 to 85% maximal heart rate (HR) for 30 to 40 minutes 3 days (supervised) or 5 days ( unsupervised ) per week. The second GXT (T2) was performed 115 +/- 27 days after CABS. In each group there were significant (p less than 0.01) increases in exercise capacity and HR from T1 to T2. However, there were no significant differences in maximal exercise capacity and HR between groups at T1 or T2. Improvement in functional capacity was not influenced by therapeutic beta blockade. These findings indicate that prescribed unsupervised exercise can be performed safely and results in similar functional improvements compared with supervised exercise after uncomplicated CABS.", 
    "23": "Preoperative and postoperative hemodynamic studies were performed during exercise in 70 patients having aorta-coronary bypass grafting for the treatment of angina. There was significant symptomatic improvement with 88% of patients free of angina postoperatively. In patients with complete revascularization there was a marked improvement during exercise in maximal oxygen consumption, cardiac index, and maximal pressure-rate product. In addition, there was a fall in pulmonary arterial pressure postoperatively. In contrast, patients with incomplete revascularization showed a small but insignificant rise in maximal oxygen consumption and cardiac index. The major reason for the increase in cardiac index was a marked increase in heart rate rather than a change in stroke index. In patients with complete revascularization there was a significant increase in stroke work index at maximal exercise.", 
    "24": "The distribution of a short-term potassium load was quantitated in three groups of acutely nephrectomized rats infused with KCl at 0.75, 1.50, and 2.25 mEq/kg/hr for 90 minutes. The rate of net potassium transfer from the extracellular fluid compartment to the intracellular fluid compartment was stable from 30 to 90 minutes and proportional to the rate of infusion, with no evidence of saturation of transport mechanisms. In the period 60 to 90 minutes, the calculated increments in intracellular potassium concentration over 10-minute intervals were similar to the respective increments in extracellular potassium concentration. The apparent volume of distribution of the infused potassium over this period was similar to total body water. At the termination of the infusions, the net potassium transfer rates rapidly fell to very low levels. Our studies support the view that the extrarenal modulation of short-term potassium load is dependent on changes in plasma potassium concentration that conform to a first-order linear kinetic model. The infusion of the selective beta 2-adrenergic blocker butoxamine without potassium administration to acutely nephrectomized rats resulted in a net efflux of potassium from the intracellular fluid compartment. The addition of butoxamine to three groups of rats receiving KCl at the previous rates resulted in a fixed decrement in net potassium transfer to the intracellular fluid compartment that was not significantly different from the net efflux of potassium seen with butoxamine alone. Despite beta blockade, the net transfer of potassium remained proportional to the infusion rate. Thus, in our studies, beta 2-adrenergic blockade had a relatively fixed influence on decreasing net potassium transfer, both under basal conditions and during short-term potassium administration.", 
    "25": "The circulatory effects induced by two sequential intravenous treatment programs with a diuretic, arteriolar or venodilator , and a positive inotropic drug were studied in a randomized between-group trial in 20 male patients with radiographic and hemodynamic evidence of left ventricular (LV) failure following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Furosemide induced a substantial diuresis in both groups of patients, in association with reductions in LV filling pressure (p less than 0.01) and cardiac output (p less than 0.05), without significant change in heart rate or systemic arterial pressure. The addition of isosorbide dinitrate was followed by reductions in the systemic arterial (p less than 0.01) and LV filling pressures (p less than 0.01) without significant change in the heart rate or cardiac output. Hydralazine after furosemide reduced systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.01), but the fall in mean blood pressure (p less than 0.01) was limited by the increase in cardiac output (p less than 0.01); heart rate was also increased (p less than 0.01) and LV filling pressure fell (p less than 0.05). The final addition of the beta-1 adrenoceptor agonist, prenalterol, increased systemic arterial systolic pressure (p less than 0.05), cardiac output (p less than 0.05), and heart rate (p less than 0.01), and reduced systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.01) in both groups; these changes were greatest in those pretreated with furosemide and isosorbide dinitrate. In both treatment pathways compared with control the reductions in systemic vascular resistance and left heart filling pressure were accompanied by increases in heart rate and cardiac output without substantial changes in systemic blood pressure. Which of these hemodynamic pathways offers the optimum prognosis awaits further study.", 
    "26": "Eleven patients with cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been treated with prenalterol. This drug was administered in seven patients once dobutamine or dopamine proved to be ineffective or poorly effective, and it was the first inotropic drug employed in four patients. Therapeutic dose of intravenous infusion ranged from 2.2 to 18 micrograms/kg/min (mean dose: 7 micrograms/kg/min), and was maintained for 2 to 4 hours. Since two patients received the infusion on two different occasions, a total of 13 cases were considered for statistical analysis. Prenalterol produced an increase in cardiac index (p less than 0.01), mean aortic pressure (p less than 0.02), net work index (p less than 0.01), net/stroke work index (p less than 0.01), pressure rate product (p less than 0.05), and myocardial perfusion gradient (p less than 0.02). It decreased systemic (p less than 0.02) and pulmonary (p less than 0.01) vascular resistances, pulmonary artery (p less than 0.01) and pulmonary capillary (p less than 0.05) pressures. Heart rate and right atrial pressure were not significantly changed. The drug acted as a relatively selective inotropic agent without a chronotropic effect and with minimal peripheral actions. It was effective in seven patients and ineffective in four patients. Thus prenalterol appears to be a useful drug in cardiogenic shock and further studies are warranted.", 
    "27": "The role of catecholamines in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias during the reperfusion period following coronary occlusion remains incompletely understood. An isolated rat heart preparation, free from the influence of autonomic innervation or of circulating catecholamines, was used to assess the effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The hearts were prelabeled with tritiated norepinephrine ( NE3H ), and the total radioactivity and that in NE3H were measured in the effluent coronary flow. The left main coronary artery was ligated for 10 minutes after which reperfusion followed. The liberation of NE3H and the development of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were monitored throughout. The cardioselective beta-antagonist agent, acebutolol, in a high concentration (1.1 X 10(-4)M), had good beta-antagonist effect in response to the added isoproterenol (10(-6)M); this concentration of acebutolol also suppressed sustained reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias but unexpectedly increased the release of NE3H . Atenolol, another cardioselective agent, did not prevent reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias even in a high concentration of 40 mg/L (1.5 X 10(-4)M). The d-isomer of propranolol, with poorer beta-antagonist properties than the l-isomer, prevented such ventricular arrhythmias in a concentration of 1.3 X 10(-5)M, which was low when compared to that of atenolol. It is proposed that the beta-antagonist activity of the compounds tested could not explain the inhibition of reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias and that another quality such as membrane-stabilizing activity may be involved.", 
    "28": "The influence of sex, age, blood pressure and physical stress on beta 2-adrenoceptor density on intact mononuclear cells was investigated in normotensives and in patients with essential hypertension using (+/-) 125-iodocyanopindolol as radio-ligand. The intra-individual receptor status under basal conditions at rest was fairly constant. The mean individual deviation of beta 2-adrenoceptor density was 11% after a time period of 3 +/- 1.9 months. The receptor number increased with age: there was a positive correlation (r = 0.59) between age and beta 2-adrenoceptor density. No significant difference existed between men and women matched for age and mean arterial blood pressure (548 +/- 179 versus 481 +/- 246 maximal binding sites per cell). A highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.73) existed between the mean arterial blood pressure and the beta 2-adrenoceptor density over a wide range of normal and increased blood pressure. A factorial analysis revealed a significant correlation between mean arterial pressure and beta 2-adrenoceptor density, but not between age or sex and beta 2-adrenoceptor density. Physical stress led within 15 min to a significant increase in beta 2-adrenoceptors followed by a fall to or even below the starting values after 15 to 30 min rest. It is concluded that beta 2-adrenoceptor density on intact mononuclear cells correlates significantly with mean arterial blood pressure and with age. However, factorial analysis revealed a significant positive correlation only between mean arterial blood pressure and the receptor number but not between age and the receptor number. Sex has no significant influence on the receptor density.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "Activation of adrenergic receptors in primary cultures of astrocytes and LRM55 glial cells stimulates taurine release. Release is inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonists alprenolol and propanolol but not by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine. Receptor-mediated taurine release occurs via a specific mechanism, since efflux of other amino acids and metabolites is not affected by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol.", 
    "30": "Effects of E 614 on ganglionic transmission in the superior cervical ganglion of the guinea-pig were investigated with an intracellular recording technique. E 614 (10(-6) - 10(-5) M) did not modify the membrane potential, but induced a transmission failure in the ganglion upon preganglionic nerve stimulation at high frequency (20-30 Hz) without affecting action potentials induced by direct stimulation of the soma membrane. E 614 suppressed the amplitude of e.p.s.ps evoked by preganglionic nerve stimulation. Frequency and amplitude of miniature e.p.s.ps were also decreased in the presence of E 614. The results suggest that E 614 may act on preganglionic nerve terminals to suppress the release of transmitter during the activations of the nerve terminal by repetitive stimulation at high frequency. The agent may depress excess sympathetic activity without much affecting normal ganglionic transmission.", 
    "31": "Adenylate cyclase activity was determined using a purified plasma membrane fraction prepared from isolated adipocytes by a Percoll gradient centrifugation procedure. The activation of adenylate cyclase by isoprenaline was reduced by approximately 50% in membranes from obese mice, although no reduction in the sensitivity of the response was apparent. Basal and fluoride- and 5'-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate-stimulated activities were similar in both groups. However, two defects in the obese system were identified which suggested that an alteration in the properties of the regulatory protein may account for the impaired hormonal activation. The specific binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol to membranes from obese animals also was decreased, suggesting a reduction in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "32": "Among the possible mechanisms which may cause wheezing or asthmatic episodes a genetically determined beta-adrenoceptor blockade and a hyperresponsiveness of alpha-adrenoceptors has been postulated. Evidence to support this hypothesis stems from an increased bronchial sensitivity to beta-blockers, a reduced formation of cyclic AMP in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation and enhanced alpha-adrenergic responses in asthmatic subjects. The recent development of techniques for measuring the specific, high-affinity binding of radiolabeled alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists made it possible to study alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in vitro. Based upon the assumption that a change in the number and/or affinity of adrenergic receptors might be a general phenomenon, we have performed alpha- and beta-receptor binding studies on lymphocytes and platelets from wheezing infants and asthmatic children as well as of infants, children, and adults not suffering from these diseases. Using 125[I]-cyanopindolol (ICYP) and 3[H]-yohimbine (HYOH) as highly specific ligands for alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, the following results were obtained: Lymphocytes and platelets from control subjects and asthmatics bound similar amounts of ICYP and HYOH and thus showed no differences either in the number or the affinity of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Lymphocytes and platelets of wheezing and nonwheezing infants also bound the same amounts of the radioligands. In asthmatic children receiving 4 X 2 puffs salbutamol beta-adrenoceptors were down-regulated and this may mimic beta-adrenoceptor blockade. When subjects were divided into four categories according to age (0-5, 5-10, 10-20 years, adults) the number of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites showed an age-dependent increase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "In the present study we have investigated the conditions for optimal adenylate cyclase (AC) activity in preparations of human myocardial biopsies, with emphasis on both basal enzyme activity and isoproterenol response. Different preparation procedures (homogenates, membrane particles) of the same biopsy showed no difference in relative response to isoproterenol, although absolute activities, using protein concentration for normalization, showed some variance. The AC-receptor complexes of the preparations were also stable when stored on ice for 3 h, and both basal and stimulated AC activities were constant at a wide range of protein concentrations (2.9-31.9 micrograms/tube), and throughout 92 min incubation. The effects of varying Mg2+, guanyl nucleotides (GTP, GMP-P(NH)P), and ATP concentrations on myocardial AC activities were also investigated under both basal conditions as well as after isoproterenol stimulation. The apparent Km for the substrate (Mg X ATP) binding to the AC was approximately 0.1 mmol/l. Isoproterenol stimulated the AC activity by increasing Vmax (41 to 142 pmol/mg protein X min) without any change in the apparent Km. Maximal relative activation by isoproterenol was achieved at pH 6.5-7.0. The concentration of isoproterenol causing half maximal AC stimulation was approximately 0.1 micrograms/ml (2 X 10(-4) mmol/l). Half maximal inhibition of isoproterenol (4 micrograms/ml) stimulated AC activity was obtained by 0.025 micrograms/ml propranolol (8 X 10(-5) mmol/l). The sensitivity and precision of this assay should make it possible to measure AC activity as well as isoproterenol response in very small quantities of myocardial tissue. This could provide a method for studying receptor functions of sick hearts by endomyocardial biopsies.", 
    "34": "This paper describes some histological features of the costo-uterine muscle of the rat together with the effects of some sympathomimetic amines upon contractions evoked by field electrical stimulation of isolated preparations. Light and electron microscopy confirmed that the costo-uterine muscle of the rat consists of smooth muscle bundles, arranged longitudinally and interspersed with collagen. There were close contacts between individual cells within bundles. No axon profiles were observed. Histochemical techniques revealed only sparse catecholamine fluorescence at the border of the tissue in association with blood vessels. Isoprenaline, fenoterol, adrenaline, noradrenaline, salbutamol and phenylephrine consistently inhibited contractions evoked by field stimulation (40V, 30Hz, 2 ms for 5 sec every 200 sec). In contrast, tyramine was without effect upon electrically evoked contractions in concentrations of up to 200 mumol/l. The slopes of the log concentration-response curves of effective amines were similar, and all of these were capable of producing 100% inhibition of contraction. The potencies of the amines relative to isoprenaline = 100 were: fenoterol 135; salbutamol 16; adrenaline 16; noradrenaline 0.7; phenylephrine 0.1; tyramine less than 0.001. Propranolol, added to preparations in the absence of inhibitors of amine uptake and alpha-adrenoreceptors, competitively antagonised the effects of the amines. Schild plots had slopes which did not differ significantly from minus one, and the mean pA2 values fell within a narrow range, e.g. 8.65 with salbutamol; 9.20 with fenoterol. Mean pA2 values for propranolol with noradrenaline and isoprenaline were unaffected by the combined presence of phentolamine (10 mumol/l), cocaine (10 mumol/l), and corticosterone (10 mumol/l). The potencies of the agonists were also unaffected by the presence of these drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by captopril was used in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs to confirm that the vasoconstrictive action of endorenally synthesized angiotensin II predominates on the efferent glomerular arteriole. Ozolinone is a loop diuretic with two isomers. Only (-)- ozolinone is diuretic, whereas both isomers have a renal vasodilatory effect which predominates on the efferent glomerular arteriole. Only the diuretic isomer increases renin release. The renin hypersecretion is simultaneous with recovery from the initial fall in filtration fraction, because of postglomerular vasodilatation. This recovery does not occur with (+)- ozolinone and is inhibited by pretreatment with captopril. This confirms that vasoconstrictive action of angiotensin II predominates on the efferent glomerular arteriole. Such a vasoconstrictive effect might affect blood flow in the vasa recta, which arise from the efferent arterioles of juxtamedullary glomeruli. This action might enable the renin-angiotensin system to participate in the control of renal medullary blood flow and urinary concentration.", 
    "36": "Beta adrenergic receptors were identified in rat myocardial left ventricle and human papillary muscle by using the antagonist radioligand 3H-dihydroalprenolol. The number (37.3 and 44.5 fmol/mg of protein, respectively in rat and man), and the KD (1.6 and 2.8 nM, respectively in rat and man) of beta receptors were not significantly different. Adrenergic receptors of both beta 1 and beta 2 subtypes were found to coexist in the left ventricle. The relative proportions of the two beta receptor subtypes were determined by the use of competition radioligand selective binding and computer modelling techniques employing the subtype selective antagonists ICI 118,551 (beta 2 selective) and atenolol (beta 1 selective) in rat or metoprolol (beta 1 selective) in man. The rat left ventricle contained about 74% beta 1 and 26% beta 2 adrenergic receptors, human left ventricle papillary muscles contained about 69% beta 1 and 31% beta 2. Human and rat left ventricles contain both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors with similar affinities. Rat might be a model for the study of human myocardial beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "37": "The beta-adrenergic receptor mediating the inhibition of sterol synthesis by catecholamines in freshly isolated human mononuclear leukocytes was defined pharmacologically by using selective beta 1- and beta 2-agonists and -antagonists. Incubation of cells for 6 h in a medium containing lipid-depleted serum resulted in a 3-fold increase in the incorporation of [14C]acetate or tritiated water into sterols. The beta-agonist (-)-isoproterenol was approximately equipotent with (-)-epinephrine and (-)-norepinephrine in suppressing sterol synthesis, yielding a sigmoidal log-dose-effect curve. Accordingly, the effects of the catecholamines were reversed by the beta-antagonist (+/-)-propranolol. The beta 2-agonists terbutaline and salbutamol inhibited sterol synthesis by 42 and 26%, respectively, at a concentration of 0.1 mmol/l. Contrary to that, the beta 1-agonists prenalterol and dobutamine had no effect. In accordance with the influence of the agonists, the beta 2-antagonist butoxamine, but not the beta 1-antagonists atenolol, metoprolol and practolol, reversed the catecholamine action on sterol synthesis. The results provide evidence that catecholamines may regulate sterol synthesis by stimulating beta 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "38": "Microviscosity of membranes prepared from striata and cortex of 3 or 30-month-old rats was measured by fluorescence polarization and electron spin resonance. The viscosity of the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer was significantly increased in striatal but not in cortical membranes of old rats. In old rats the incorporation of methyl groups into phosphatidylcholine was significantly lower than in young rats. beta-Adrenergic specific binding sites were reduced in striata, cortex and pineal gland of old rats. In the striata of these animals, [3H] spiperone specific binding sites and dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase were also low. A chronic treatment of old rats with S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the cofactor in phospholipid methylation, lowered microviscosity to normal values in striata but not in the cortex. In the same old rats, the beta-receptor in striata and pineal gland returned towards juvenile values; in the cortex, the modification was in the same direction but did not reach significance. Neither putative dopaminergic receptors nor the adenylate cyclase age-dependent decrease was modified by treatment with S-adenosyl-L-methionine.", 
    "39": "The hyperadrenergic syndrome that occurs in tetanus is characterised by hypertension, tachycardia, and increased systemic arteriolar resistance. A 74 year old man with tetanus was found to have very high catecholamine concentrations--as high as those in phaeochromocytoma--and the fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate were measured to see whether they paralleled changes in the catecholamine values. A labetalol infusion of 0.25-1 mg/min gradually stabilised the cardiovascular disturbances and the patient recovered.", 
    "40": "Rat liver lysosomal phospholipase A hydrolyzes both acidic and neutral phospholipids. Numerous cationic amphiphilic drugs including imipramine, propranolol, 4,4'-bis(diethylaminoethoxy)-alpha, beta- diethyldiphenylethane and chloropromazine inhibit phospholipase A. Cationic amphiphilic drugs bind readily to acidic phospholipids but much less readily to neutral phospholipids. Formation of drug-lipid complexes is thought to be an important mechanism involved in the inhibition of lysosomal phospholipases. Therefore, we studied the effects of four cationic amphiphilic inhibitors on lysosomal phospholipase A using one acidic and two neutral phospholipid substrates. The concentration of the drugs required to produce 50% inhibition was much higher when phosphatidylinositol was used as substrate. The degradation of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine was more readily inhibited by these agents than that of phosphatidylinositol. In drug-induced lipidosis, the predominance of acidic phospholipids may be due to redirection of phospholipid metabolism towards the formation of acidic phospholipids with a resultant increased delivery of these lipids to lysosomes. Based on our results, it does not appear to be due to decreased enzymatic hydrolysis of drug-acidic phospholipid complexes, at least when pure phospholipid substrates are used. Lysosomal storage of both acidic and neutral phospholipids appears to be caused by inhibition of lysosomal phospholipase action in view of the probable high intralysosomal levels of these agents.", 
    "41": "Agonist, but not antagonist, protects the beta-adrenergic receptor from inactivation during solubilization in deoxycholate. Protection is apparently due to locking of the agonist in the receptor, a high affinity interaction induced or stabilized by this detergent. The guanyl nucleotide-binding protein which normally interacts with the receptor to induce high affinity binding of the hormone is apparently not required in this agonist-specific locking process. It is therefore possible that deoxycholate mimics the effect of the guanyl nucleotide-binding protein on the conformation of the hormone-occupied receptor. The experiments further show that the receptor in deoxycholate is quite stable for days, provided that it is occupied by the agonist. Removal of deoxycholate brings about the release of the locked agonist and the return of the receptor to the dynamic functional state.", 
    "42": "The cytosolic Ca2+ activity of mouse pancreatic beta-cells was studied with the intracellular fluorescent indicator quin2 . When the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was 1.20 mM, the basal cytosolic Ca2+ activity was 162 +/- 9 nM. Stimulation with 20 mM glucose increased this Ca2+ activity by 40%. In the presence of only 0.20 mM Ca2+ or after the addition of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ -channel blocker D-600, glucose had an opposite and more prompt effect in reducing cytosolic Ca2+ by about 15%. It is concluded that an early result of glucose exposure is a lowering of the cytosolic Ca2+ activity and that this effect tends to be masked by a subsequent increase of the Ca2+ activity due to influx of Ca2+ through the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.", 
    "43": "Intravenous or intracerebroventricular administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) significantly improved survival in immunized mice subjected to fatal anaphylaxis by intravenous challenge with an antigen. This protective action of TRH was blocked by pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (5 mg/kg), or by prior administration of the cardioselective beta 1-antagonist, metoprolol (5 mg/kg), but not by pretreatment with the beta 2-selective antagonist, butoxamine (5 mg/kg). It is suggested, based on the present and previous findings that the anti-anaphylactic effect of TRH in the mouse is mediated through activation of beta 1-adrenoceptive effectors, secondary to central stimulation of sympathomedullary release of catecholamines.", 
    "44": "In isolated rat atria, 1 microM bromoacetylalprenololmentane shifted the tension development curve for isoproterenol to the right of the control curve. After a 2 h washout period, no significant recovery of the isoproterenol concentration-response curve had occurred. Pretreatment of rat atrial membranes with 1 microM bromoacetylalprenololmentane resulted in an 83% decrease in the concentration of beta-adrenoceptors with no change in the KD value for [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding to the receptors left. The results indicated that bromoacetylalprenololmentane was an irreversible beta-blocker.", 
    "45": "59Fe was incorporated in vivo into intestinal sacs prepared in iron deficient rats and 59Fe counts were detected in blood, spleen, liver, femur and intestine. The i.v. injection of isoproterenol (i.v. 2 micrograms/rat) or N',O'-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (10 microM/100 g b.w.) enhanced significantly the iron counts in blood, spleen, liver and femur but not in intestine. (-)-Propranolol (2 mg X kg-1 b.w. i.v.) antagonized the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol. It is suggested that isoproterenol increases iron absorption via the stimulation of beta-adrenoreceptors of the intestinal mucosa.", 
    "46": "EC50 and relative intrinsic activity values were obtained for isoprenaline, fenoterol, salbutamol, prenalterol and three new beta-adrenoceptor agonists, BRL 28410, BRL 35113 and BRL 35135 on rat white adipocyte lipolysis, rat atrial rate and tension, rat uterus tension and guinea-pig tracheal tension. Fenoterol and salbutamol were selective for tracheal and uterine responses, prenalterol was selective for atrial responses, but BRL 28410, BRL 35113 and BRL 35135 were selective for the adipocyte lipolytic response. pA2 values for propranolol, practolol, ICI 118,551 and sotalol were obtained on adipocytes, atria and trachea. pA2 values for propranolol and sotalol were much lower on adipocytes than on atria or trachea. The pA2 value for practolol was lower on adipocytes than on atria and the pA2 value for ICI 118,551 was lower on adipocytes than on trachea. Both agonist and antagonist studies therefore suggest that the rat adipocyte lipolytic receptor does not fit into the current beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor classification.", 
    "47": "A programmed atrial stimulation at a driving rate of 100/min was performed in a 47-year-old woman with left bundle branch block. Supernormal conduction lasting 40 ms was revealed within the right bundle branch. After autonomic blockade (0.2 mg propranolol/kg body weight and 0.04 mg atropine/kg body weight) the position and duration of the supernormal conduction did not change. This suggests that the autonomic nervous system has no influence on the supernormal phase of conduction in the human intraventricular conduction system.", 
    "48": "Potentialities of the non-invasive method of trans-esophagus electrostimulation of the heart were studied with regard to the selection and assessment of the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic therapy in 16 patients with paroxysms of supraventricular reciprocal tachycardia. The antiarrhythmic therapy selected by this method proved effective in 13 patients following a prolonged course of treatment. The method was highly informative in predicting the efficacy of the systemic course treatment of patients with supraventricular tachycardia paroxysms.", 
    "49": "Thirty-two middle-aged men with essential hypertension completed a double-blind randomly allocated comparison of the effects of methyldopa versus propranolol on blood lipid levels. After a four-week period on a placebo for each drug, subjects were titrated for the next six weeks with either methyldopa from 500 to 2000 mg/day or propranolol from 80 to 320 mg/day plus a placebo for the other drug until supine diastolic blood pressure was below 90 mm Hg or the ceiling dose was reached. Subjects were then maintained on the achieved drug dose for an additional six weeks and finally switched back to a placebo for each drug for four more weeks. Blood lipid levels were measured twice during each study period and the values averaged and compared. Neither drug significantly affected levels of total plasma cholesterol. However, both drugs reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels about 10 per cent and increased the total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio. In addition, propranolol significantly increased plasma triglyceride levels (28.3 per cent). The changes in lipid levels were not dose related. Whether or not these blood lipid changes persist and their possible clinical implication during prolonged therapy remain to be elucidated.", 
    "50": "The reflex effects on heart rate (HR) of presumptive cardiac receptors have been differentiated from those of the arterial baroreceptors in conscious rabbits by inflating cuffs on the ascending aorta, descending aorta, inferior vena cava and pulmonary artery. When the outflow from the right ventricle was progressively impeded the accompanying increase in HR was entirely explicable by unloading of the arterial baroreceptors. As the outflow from the left ventricle was progressively impeded there was an initial increase in HR due to unloading of the arterial baroreceptors, followed by a progressive decline. This decline was attributed to a reflex arising from vagally-innervated receptors in the left side of the heart. The threshold of this cardiac receptor-HR reflex occurred at a higher level of mean aortic pressure than that at which the effects of the arterial baroreceptors on HR were maximal. Cholinergic (vagal) efferent nerves were responsible for two-thirds of the decline in HR caused by the reflex. The properties of the cardiac receptor-HR reflex were altered by drugs that affect myocardial contractility. Isoprenaline raised the mean aortic pressure at which the threshold occurred, but lowered the corresponding level of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Propranolol virtually abolished the reflex, even though left ventricular end-diastolic pressure reached a high level. It is concluded that in the conscious rabbit the arterial baroreceptor reflexes normally prevent the threshold of the cardiac receptor-HR reflex from being attained.", 
    "51": "The effect of atenolol on plasma HDL cholesterol subfractions and other plasma lipids in 18 patients with essential hypertension was studied. The atenolol was given orally, in a dose of 100 mg once daily for 6 months. The level of HDL cholesterol during atenolol treatment was significantly lower than before it. The concentration of HDL2 cholesterol decreased (P less than 0.01) during the first month of therapy and remained constant during treatment. The level of HDL3 cholesterol decreased slightly but not significantly. The concentrations of plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol increased slightly during atenolol treatment; statistical significance was reached (P less than 0.05) at 6 months.", 
    "52": "Twenty-five indocyanine green (ICG) clearance determinations were performed in four subjects in the presence of quinidine or propranolol before and after one week of treatment with cimetidine, 1200 mg/day, and following a single 600 mg cimetidine dose. There was no significant difference between the mean ICG clearance before cimetidine treatment and that after one week of therapy with cimetidine, while the mean ICG clearance was 25% lower following single cimetidine doses (p greater than 0.05). It is concluded that cimetidine has only a transient hepatic blood flow lowering effect.",

    "54": "To evaluate the possible influence of sympathetic activation on the haemodynamic response to intravenous beta-blockade, the dose-response characteristics of three boluses of propranolol were evaluated in 8 patients with uncomplicated infarction and compared in a similar number of patients with stable angina. Following a control period, when haemodynamic stability was confirmed, propranolol 2, 2 and 4 mg (cumulative dosage 2, 4 and 8 mg) was injected into the central circulation at 15 min intervals. Despite close matching in baseline control haemodynamic variables between the groups, in stable angina, propranolol resulted in dose-related depression of cardiac output without change in systemic blood pressure, whereas following myocardial infarction the drug induced significantly greater falls in cardiac output (P less than 0.05) and a dose-related decrease in systemic blood pressure. Despite the greater effects of propranolol on cardiac output following myocardial infarction, the left ventricular filling pressure was increased to a lesser extent compared with stable angina. The explanation for this observation may reside in a greater susceptibility of the left ventricular wall to increase its compliance, under conditions of high sympathetic stimulation, following beta-blockade. These data support experimental and biochemical evidence of sympathetic activation in myocardial infarction; the hyperadrenergic state conditions an augmented haemodynamic response to competitive antagonism of sympathetic stimulation at cardiac beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "55": "The interaction of quinidine (Q) and propranolol (P) with human very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) was determined by ultrafiltration in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for Q and in phosphate and Tris buffers (pH 7.4-7.5) for P, respectively. The Scatchard plots of Q are curved and were best described by a model assuming two independent classes of binding sites on lipoproteins. When working with P, the Scatchard plots were also nonlinear, but positive cooperativity was observed for the VLDL fraction in phosphate buffer and apparently also for the LDL fraction in Tris buffer. These nonlinear curves were described by the model used for Q, excluding any data falling in the cooperating region. The binding parameters, primary (K1) and secondary (K2) affinity constants and the number of sites in each class of independent binding sites, were generated by a computer program. The results of this in vitro study suggest that drug binding (and possibly distribution) to lipoproteins may be affected by the nature and concentration of some ions present in serum.", 
    "56": "The effect of single oral doses of penbutolol (40 mg) and propranolol L.A. (160 mg) on psychomotor performance of 12 normal individuals has been investigated. Subjects were randomly administered penbutolol, propranolol L.A. and placebo according to a double-blind, three-part cross-over design. At 3 h post-dosing both penbutolol and propranolol L.A. significantly increased (P less than 0.001) complex reaction times when compared to placebo. By 24 h post-dosing the mean complex reaction times for penbutolol and propranolol L.A. were not significantly different from placebo.", 
    "57": "The interaction between propranolol and warfarin was investigated in six healthy volunteers using a low dose warfarin protocol and in New Zealand white rabbits. Warfarin concentration (Cmin) in the volunteers increased by 14.7% on addition of propranolol (P less than 0.02). There was no significant change in prothrombin time. In the rabbit study, elimination half-life was shorter in the propranolol treated animals (8.20 +/- 0.44 h) than in controls (10.89 +/- 0.62 h). This was due to a fall in its volume of distribution from 1.13 +/- 0.10 1 kg-1 in controls to 0.81 +/- 0.08 1 kg-1 in the propranolol treated group. Clearance was not significantly altered. The small change in warfarin concentration could be of clinical importance in some patients because warfarin has a low therapeutic index. This requires further investigation.", 
    "58": "Propranolol's potential as a protective agent against tissue injury has been noted in experimental myocardial, renal and early acute focal cerebral ischemia. The purpose of the present investigation was to study further the effects of racemic (d,l) propranolol on blood-brain barrier permeability, morphological changes, cortical electrical activity, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in experimental focal cerebral ischemia. Thirty adult cats, anesthetized with nitrous oxide, underwent 6 hours of right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Fifteen cats were untreated. Fifteen cats were given a continuous infusion of racemic propranolol (1 mg/kg/hr) for 7 hours beginning 1 hour before MCA occlusion and a 4 mg/kg bolus immediately before occlusion, both directly into the right carotid artery. Right Sylvian rCBF did not significantly differ in the treated and untreated groups. Carbon filling defects and vital dye (i.e., Evans blue and fluorescein) extravasation were less severe in the propranolol treated animals. Light microscopic findings demonstrated no difference in infarct size between the two groups. The findings suggest that at doses given, racemic propranolol does not exert a protective effect upon cerebral tissue subjected to 6 hours of incomplete ischemia.",

Additionally, we studied the effect of a single immediate postoperative instillation of timolol maleate 0.5%; this was associated with a slight reduction of intraocular pressure at the three- and six-hour time intervals, but did not eliminate the pressure spikes.", 
    "60": "Although the adverse effect of hypoxia on drug metabolism is well documented in subcellular systems, its effect on drug clearance by the intact liver has not been defined. This study was undertaken in the isolated perfused rat liver to examine the effects of acute hypoxia on the hepatic elimination of two highly cleared substances--propranolol and sodium taurocholate. Hypoxia was established by equilibrating the perfusate with 100% nitrogen rather than 100% oxygen. This led to a fall in portal vein pO2 from 300 to 30 mm Hg, and a 10-fold rise in hepatic venous lactate:pyruvate ratio, indicating a profound alteration in hepatic cellular redox state. In bolus dose studies, propranolol uptake was unimpaired by hypoxia, with a monoexponential decline in perfusate concentrations from 2,000 to 30 ng per ml, (t1/2 uptake = 2.5 min). After 20 min of hypoxia, perfusate propranolol concentrations rose from 30 to 80 ng per ml, indicating release of propranolol from liver back into the perfusate. Reoxygenation of perfusate restored hepatic extraction of propranolol to normal (t1/2 uptake = 2.37 +/- 0.19 min vs. 2.55 +/- 0.60 min p greater than 0.1) such that perfusate concentrations were undetectable by 30 min. In steady-state studies, perfusate propranolol concentrations rose from 1.55 +/- 0.50 to 4.08 +/- 1.47 micrograms per ml (p less than 0.005), after 1 hr of hypoxia indicating a change in propranolol clearance from 15 ml per min to less than 6 ml per min. Reoxygenation resulted in a fall in perfusate propranolol concentrations towards control values (2.78 +/- 1.13 vs. 1.80 +/- 0.41 micrograms per ml, p greater than 0.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Blood viscosity ( Contraves L S 30) and its determinants were measured in 23 patients with mild/moderate pre-eclampsia, 10 patients with intrauterine growth retardation and 22 control subjects, matched for age and gestation. Both abnormal groups had a significantly increased blood viscosity at high shear rate (94 s-1) associated with increased haematocrit. Fibrinogen levels were also increased, but there were no significant differences between groups in plasma viscosity, low shear viscosity (0.94 s-1) or red cell deformability, measured by a low-shear washed cell system of filtration through 5-micron pore diameter Nuclepore filters. In the pre-eclamptic group, measurements were repeated after 1-2 weeks in nine patients treated with labetalol (a combined alpha and beta adrenergic blocker) and in 10 patients treated with bed rest. Labetalol reduced blood pressure but no change in rheology was seen in either group. Control of blood pressure by labetalol does not adversely affect rheology, in contrast to diuretics which are known to cause haemoconcentration and increased blood viscosity.", 
    "62": "The influence of volatile anaesthetics (halothane, enflurane) on the serum protein binding of three highly bound basic drugs has been studied in vitro by equilibrium dialysis. Radioactive labelled isotopes were used for the determination of drug concentrations. Enflurane, halothane and the halothane metabolite trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) inhibited the binding of diazepam to serum and to its main binding protein, albumin. The binding of diazepam to albumin was inhibited in a competitive manner and was not related to the anaesthetic potency of the vapours. Thus the observed displacement of diazepam should be regarded as a side-effect of the volatile anaesthetics. The binding of propranolol and prazosin in serum was not significantly influenced by the investigated anaesthetics. At clinically relevant concentrations of the anaesthetics, diazepam was displaced significantly only by enflurane with an increase in free fraction of 60% in serum. TFA in concentrations seen after operation significantly increased the free fraction of diazepam up to 90%. We conclude that enflurane anaesthesia may temporarily potentiate the pharmacological effect of diazepam and that, in the postoperative period following halothane anaesthesia, a more rapid elimination of diazepam could be expected.", 
    "63": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be a neurotransmitter in a peptidergic nervous system and is found in nerves in pulmonary blood vessels. Information regarding its pulmonary vascular effects is limited. We therefore studied VIP's effect on pulmonary vascular tone in the immature lung. Normoxic and hypoxic unsedated newborn lambs with chronically implanted flow probes around the right and left pulmonary arteries were used. VIP was injected into one pulmonary artery only, and direct effects of this peptide on the pulmonary vessels were determined by comparing the flow changes in the injected vs. the uninjected lung. VIP was a powerful pulmonary vasodilator with a threshold of 0.3 microgram/kg. It also was a systemic vasodilator (after 1 microgram/kg, aortic pressure fell 27% and cardiac output increased 29%, both P less than 0.01), with a threshold of 0.1 microgram/kg. Pretreatment with propranolol (1 mg/kg iv) did not abolish pulmonary or systemic vasodilation after VIP. On the other hand, pretreatment with indomethacin (3 mg/kg per day for 3 days) abolished VIP-induced pulmonary vasodilation but probably did not affect systemic vasodilation. We conclude that VIP is a powerful pulmonary vasodilator in the newborn lamb and that this dilation can be blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. VIP is also a powerful systemic vasodilator in the newborn lamb but this effect is not blocked by either propranolol or indomethacin.", 
    "64": "Dopamine receptors in glomeruli and renal cortical tubules were characterized using radioligand binding and adenylate cyclase studies. The binding of [3H]haloperidol to glomeruli and tubules was rapid, saturable with time and ligand concentration, reversible, of high affinity, and demonstrated stereoselectivity and antagonist and agonist rank potency for binding to dopamine receptors. Analysis of kinetic data and Rosenthal plots in glomeruli revealed a single class of [3H]haloperidol binding sites with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 6 nM and maximum receptor density (Bmax) of 0.42 pmol/mg protein. In tubules, at least two binding sites were noted, one with an apparent Kd of 38 nM and Bmax of 1.90 pmol/mg protein and another with an apparent Kd of 183 nM and Bmax of 3.50 pmol/mg protein. Dopamine and apomorphine increased adenylate cyclase in tubular membranes while no increases were noted in glomeruli. These studies suggest that glomeruli have D2 dopamine receptors, while renal cortical tubules contain the D1 dopamine receptor.", 
    "65": "The presenting symptoms, course, and treatment of 10 patients with severe theophylline toxicity (heart rate above 120, multifocal atrial tachycardia or premature ventricular contractions, hypotension, seizures) are described. Theophylline levels at presentation averaged 66 micrograms/ml (range 30 to 180 micrograms/ml). All patients had marked tachycardia; 80 percent had gastrointestinal symptoms, 50 percent were hypotensive, and 20 percent had seizures. A known history of poor compliance or other risk factors to overdosage was present in 60 percent. Of the five patients in whom drug clearances were determined, two had uniform first-order drug elimination. Three had biphasic elimination with an initial period of delayed elimination due to either zero-order kinetics or continued drug absorption. During the first-order elimination period, mean plasma theophylline clearance was 28.0 +/- 4.3 ml per minute with a half-life of 8.2 hours. In the patients with initially delayed elimination, the mean clearance during the slow phase was 9.6 +/- 3.3 ml per minute with an apparent half-life of 31 hours. One patient was treated with charcoal hemoperfusion but the others received conservative management alone; all recovered without permanent sequelae. Propranolol and verapamil were useful in controlling supraventricular tachycardia. It appears that most patients with severe theophylline toxicity can be managed without hemoperfusion, which should be considered only when drug clearance is reduced, and hypotension, tachycardia, ventricular ectopy, or seizures are refractory to conservative measures.", 
    "66": "Serum glucose levels, triglyceride levels, and body weight are reported from a controlled drug trial in men, aged 40 to 49, with uncomplicated mild hypertension. The drug treatment started with hydrochlorothiazide alone, and methyldopa was added when necessary. If side effects occurred, methyldopa was replaced by propranolol. No detailed advice about diet, smoking, or weight reduction was given to any group. The untreated control subjects had a small increase in serum glucose levels during five years, from 6.08 to 6.21 mmol/liter. Those treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone and those treated with hydrochlorothiazide plus methyldopa had a small increase in serum glucose levels of the same order as that in the control subjects. However, those receiving the thiazide/propranolol combination experienced a sizeable increase in glucose levels, from 5.96 to 6.53 mmol/liter (p less than 0.001). This increase was significantly greater than the increase in the other groups (p less than 0.001). The thiazide/propranolol group also showed a significant increase in serum triglyceride levels (p less than 0.05). There was no difference in serum potassium levels in the different drug groups. The results indicate that moderate thiazide doses do not have significant effects on serum glucose levels in this age group. Propranolol in combination with thiazide seems to increase the level of serum glucose.", 
    "67": "The intravenous administration of labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, reduced diastolic blood pressure by 30 mm Hg or more in 15 of 17 patients with severe hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 125 mm Hg). A method repeated intravenous injection of the drug produced a prompt but gradual reduction of arterial blood pressure without the induction of a reflex tachycardia. Side effects were mild and of brief duration despite the presence of hypertensive complications in many of these patients. Hypotension, coronary insufficiency, or neurologic deterioration did not occur. Labetalol appears to be a suitable alternative to the direct vasodilating agents in the management of patients with severe hypertension and hypertensive emergencies.", 
    "68": "The electrophysiologic changes produced by the intravenous administration of 0.6 mg/kg of sotalol were studied in 12 patients aged 45 to 85 years (mean 68 years). Effects upon atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time (AH interval) and His-Purkinje conduction time (HV interval) were assessed at identical rates. The Wenckebach cycle length was determined by rapid atrial stimulation. Refractory periods before and after the drug were compared at the same cycle length. Retrograde conduction was studied, with special reference to reentry phenomena within the His-Purkinje system. Sinoatrial function was evaluated using sinus node recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time. The following changes were noted: (1) decrease in sinus rate, (2) prolongation of QT interval, (3) depression of AV nodal conduction (prolonged AH interval) and increase in effective and functional refractory periods of the AV node, (4) increase in relative refractory period of the His-Purkinje system with no associated change in HV interval, (5) prolongation of effective refractory period in the atrium and ventricle, and (6) increase in retrograde refractory period of specialized ventricular tissue and depressed conduction of premature ventricular responses. Reentry phenomena in the His-Purkinje system were not significantly affected by the drug. Thus certain of the electrophysiologic effects of sotalol in humans were found to be in favor of a class III antiarrhythmic mechanism of action. These results justify further studies to evaluate the usefulness of this drug as an antiarrhythmic agent.", 
    "69": "In 31 dogs chronically beta blocked with oral propranolol (12 to 14 mg/kg/day), glucagon (20 micrograms/kg) and combined dopamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) and isoproterenol (0.2 micrograms/kg/min) were given intravenously and tested for hemodynamic efficacy. Dogs were divided into four groups. Basal hemodynamics were obtained In Group I (n = 8) without cardiopulmonary bypass. In Group II (n = 8), hemodynamics were studied after 15 minutes of global ischemia during cardiopulmonary bypass. In Group III (n = 8), hemodynamics were studied after regional ischemia produced by ligation of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. In Group IV (n = 7), myocardial oxygen consumption and left ventricular mechanics were studied before and after 1 hour of cardiopulmonary bypass. Our results indicate the following: (1) Dopamine-isoproterenol improves hemodynamics in basal, post-global ischemic, and post-regional ischemic states. Glucagon improves hemodynamics either insignificantly or to a lesser extent than dopamine-isoproterenol. Furthermore, glucagon produces a larger increase in heart rate, which is not desirable. (2) Both dopamine-isoproterenol and glucagon increase myocardial oxygen consumption in comparison with control.", 
    "70": "To discriminate between two widely used models of hepatic drug elimination, the venous equilibrium and sinusoidal models, we examined the effect of altering perfusate protein binding on the hepatic elimination of the highly cleared drug, propranolol, by the isolated perfused rat liver. We investigated specifically the relationship between the unbound fraction of drug perfusing the liver and the steady-state unbound drug concentration in hepatic venous effluent (i.e., in the perfusate reservoir) after a constant infusion of drug (1.37 mg/hr) into the portal vein. Each rat liver (n = 21) was perfused over 60 min at one of seven different protein concentrations, such that the unbound fraction of propranolol in the portal venous perfusate was varied from 0.1 to 0.65. The unbound steady-state propranolol concentration in the hepatic venous effluent remained unchanged, despite an almost 7-fold increase in the free fraction of propranolol perfusing the liver. The data conform precisely to the predictions of the venous equilibrium model and are incompatible with the sinusoidal model, which predicts a 100-fold decrease in unbound reservoir concentration. This study therefore establishes that the apparently \"unphysiological\" venous equilibrium model represents a valid description of the hepatic elimination of this high clearance compound.", 
    "71": "A study was undertaken of propranolol pharmacokinetics in dogs before and after oral coadministration of hydralazine to determine whether interactions described in humans could be reproduced in an animal model. Additionally, physiological parameters considered to be relevant to the pharmacokinetic handling (absorption rate and splanchnic hemodynamics) were studied. Coadministration of oral hydralazine and propranolol in conscious dogs caused an increase in peak plasma concentration ( Cpmax ) and area under the oral plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of propranolol ( Cpmax = 19.2 +/- 5.8 ng/ml, control; Cpmax = 91.5 +/- 12.8 ng/ml, posthydralazine : AUC = 65.7 +/- 14.6 ng X hr/ml, control; AUC = 152.4 +/- 23.9 ng X hr/ml, posthydralazine : mean +/- S.E.M., n = 5; P less than .01 and P less than .01), without change either in the peak plasma level, time to peak or plasma AUC of [14C] propranolol and metabolites (P greater than .70, P greater than .90 and P greater than .60, respectively) or in urinary recovery (urinary recovery = 39.7 +/- 4.3% dose, control; urinary recovery = 41.8 +/- 6.2% dose, posthydralazine ). When propranolol was administered i.v., hydralazine caused a small (42.3 +/- 18%), but significant (P less than .025), increase in systemic clearance. Oral bioavailability increased from 7.3 +/- 2.1 to 23.6 +/- 5.1% (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 5, P less than .025), hepatic extraction showed correspondingly inverse changes and estimated hepatic blood flow increased from 34.9 +/- 3.8 to 63.3 +/- 10.8 ml/min/kg (P less than .025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "Recent experiments suggest that propranolol taken orally with a carbohydrate-rich meal increases its apparent bioavailability by reducing first-pass metabolism. It has been postulated that this increase in bioavailability may be secondary to a transient increase in hepatic blood flow (QH). To examine this hypothesis, we examined the effect of one of the carbohydrate meals (potato) tested in other propranolol studies on QH by measuring blood clearance (ClB) of indocyanine green (ICG). Ten minutes after eating 200 gm cooked potato, mean ICG blood clearance (ClB) in six subjects rose by 12% (range -13% to +41%). There also was a 10% mean increase (range -13% to +23%) in ICG ClB 60 min after the meal. It was then postulated that a larger carbohydrate meal might induce a more consistent and substantial increase in ICG ClB; therefore, five of the subjects were restudied after 400 gm potato. The increase in ICG ClB was of the order of that after 200 gm. Changes in QH of this magnitude would be expected to make a negligible contribution to the mean 50% increase in propranolol bioavailability reported by several investigators. It thus appears that factors other than change in QH play a dominant role in the reduced first-pass metabolism of propranolol after a meal rich in carbohydrates.", 
    "73": "We describe a sensitive, specific liquid-chromatographic determination of penbutolol and its 4-hydroxy metabolite in plasma and urine. The method involves a simple organic extraction, evaporation of the solvent, reconstitution in methanol/water, and injection into the chromatograph. Penbutolol, its metabolites, and the internal standard, propranolol, are resolved on a CN reversed-phase column and detected fluorometrically. Conjugates of penbutolol and its 4-hydroxy metabolite may be determined after a 2-h enzymic hydrolysis. Detection limits are in the range of 3 to 12 micrograms/L of plasma. The assay is reproducible and nearly free of interferences. Representative concentrations in blood and urine of normal volunteers are reported.", 
    "74": "Ten patients with refractory recurrent supraventricular tachycardia were found by electrophysiologic study to have bypass tracts and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. All had failed to respond to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy and were therefore treated with oral amiodarone (1,600 to 2,000 mg/day for 2 weeks, then 800 to 1,200 mg/day for another 2 weeks with subsequent 200 to 600 mg/day maintenance doses). During or after the fourth week of therapy, electrophysiologic study was repeated. In 9 of 10 patients, supraventricular tachycardia could not be reinduced by programmed stimulation. In the remaining patient, nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia (greater than 10 beats, lasting less than 30 seconds) with a slower basic cycle length than that during the control period was provoked. Significant increases in the effective refractory period of the accessory pathway in both the anterograde (+26%, p less than 0.05) and retrograde (+40%, p less than 0.02) directions were noted, the magnitude of change being independent of the control effective refractory period. There were also significant increases in the effective refractory period of the right atrium (+24%, p less than 0.01) and the right ventricle (+15%, p less than 0.01) during long-term therapy with amiodarone. Over a mean follow-up period of 20 months, symptomatic control of the arrhythmia occurred in all patients; in only one patient treatment with amiodarone could not be continued because of side effects. These data establish the electrophysiologic basis for the effectiveness of amiodarone in the prophylactic control of refractory paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia complicating the bypass tract syndromes.", 
    "75": "Patients with coronary artery disease may not manifest ST segment depression during exercise. Inadequate stress, mild coronary artery disease and severe left ventricular dysfunction have been postulated as mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of exercise R wave amplitude on ST segment depression in 81 patients with coronary artery disease (50% or greater diameter narrowing of one or more vessels). All patients underwent symptom-limited treadmill exercise testing and 71 patients (88%) had concomitant thallium-201 imaging. In 26 patients, the exercise R wave amplitude in electrocardiographic lead V5 was less than 11 mm (Group I), and in 55 patients it was 11 mm or greater (Group II). The two groups were similar with regard to age, sex, propranolol administration and left ventricular function. There was a significant difference in the incidence of positive exercise electrocardiograms in the two groups (2 patients [8%] in Group I and 27 patients [49%] in Group II; p = 0.002), despite similar exercise heart rate and extent of coronary artery disease. Myocardial ischemia, manifested by exercise-induced angina or exercise-induced thallium-201 perfusion defects, was similar in both groups. Thallium-201 imaging showed perfusion defects in 73% of patients in Group I and in 76% of patients in Group II (p = not significant). Thus, R wave amplitude is a new determinant of failure to develop ST depression during exercise. A low R wave amplitude (less than 11 mm) is rarely associated with ST depression, even in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. Exercise thallium-201 imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool in patients with low R wave amplitude.", 
    "76": "Salivary flow and the influence of drugs on this were studied in subjects with borderline hypertension and in normotensive subjects. Saliva production at rest was lower in borderline hypertensive subjects than in normotensive subjects. Plasma catecholamine levels were similar in both groups of subjects studied. Intravenous injections of propranolol and phentolamine did not enhance saliva secretion in the borderline hypertensive group, whereas atropine caused the secretion to decrease in both groups. Intravenous infusions of neostigmine led to a dose-dependent increase of salivary flow. The dose-response curve for the stimulating effect of neostigmine on saliva production was shifted to the right in borderline hypertensive as compared with normotensive subjects. The results of the study support the assumption that in subjects with borderline hypertension parasympathetic influence on the salivary glands is reduced.", 
    "77": "Hemodynamic effects of propranolol during coronary artery surgery were investigated in 26 patients who chronically took propranolol and who received a standardized morphine/diazepam/pancuronium/halothane anesthetic. Effects were shown by correlating logarithm of the plasma propranolol concentrations versus percentage change in hemodynamics following stressful events (induction, intubation, skin incision, sternotomy, and sternal retraction). Log propranolol and hemodynamics following cardiopulmonary bypass also were correlated. A broad range of propranolol levels were observed. Levels (range and mean +/- SD) were preinduction 0-96 (25.6 +/- 21.6) ng/ml; preincision 0-86 (27.2 +/- 24.4) ng/ml; and sternal retraction 0-92 (28.2 +/- 25.4) ng/ml. The range of hemodynamic responses to stressful events also was broad. Representative changes between preincision control and sternotomy were (range and mean +/- SD): HR-8-30 (7 +/- 10) beats/min; PCWP 1-21 (8.5 +/- 4.6) mmHg; CI -0.2-1.1 (-0.2 +/- 0.7) 1 X min-1 X m-2, and SVR -244-1,288 (310 +/- 388) dyn X s X cm-3. By the time of sternal retraction, CI had declined from preincision values in 14 patients. Linear regression analysis demonstrated an inverse correlation between log propranolol and magnitude of HR, MAP, PCWP, and CI response to stressful stimulation. A direct but statistically weaker correlation with SVR also was seen. Significant correlations between log propranolol versus hemodynamic response to anesthetic induction and versus postcardiopulmonary bypass hemodynamics were not observed.", 
    "78": "Over a 7-year period transient hyperthyroidism was diagnosed in 35 patients seen in a consulting practice in a community hospital. The patients were followed up for an average of 15 months. Initially all of them had biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism but a very low 24-hour uptake of radioiodine. The hyperthyroid phase was short, and there were no relapses. Seventeen patients subsequently became hypothyroid; this phase, too, was almost always transient. The clinical course of the disease in the 11 women who became hyperthyroid within 6 months after giving birth was similar to that experienced by the other patients, but of the 11 who had increased titres of antimicrosomal antibodies a significantly greater proportion (73%) showed at least transient evidence of hypothyroidism; 1 patient remained frankly hypothyroid for a year. Transient hyperthyroidism can be distinguished from Graves' disease only if the uptake of radioiodine is measured. It is important to make this distinction, as transient hyperthyroidism can be managed safely and symptomatically with beta-blockers alone. The propensity of this disease for the postpartum period and the high proportion of patients with antithyroid antibodies suggest an autoimmune cause."
