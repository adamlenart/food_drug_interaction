    "0": "The roles of central noradrenergic mechanisms in the regulation of gastric motility were investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats in whom an intragastric balloon had been placed. Noradrenaline 100 nmol administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) significantly decreased spontaneous contractions of the stomach and this decrease in gastric motility was not observed in bilaterally vagotomized animals. Intracisternally administered (i.c.) noradrenaline (10 nmol) induced a decrease in gastric motility comparable to that elicited by noradrenaline 100 nmol i.c.v. Phentolamine 10 nmol i.c. but not the same dose of propranolol i.c. significantly antagonized the noradrenaline (10 nmol)-induced inhibition of gastric motility. These results suggest that alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated noradrenergic mechanisms in the brain stem are involved in the inhibitory regulation of gastric motility.", 
    "1": "The benefit of antihypertensive therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with isolated systolic hypertension has now been established by the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program. However, there is little information about the relative effectiveness of different drug regimens in this condition. This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of 50 mg of atenolol, 10 mg of enalapril, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 2.5 mg of isradipine in the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension. After a 3-week placebo run-in phase, 24 subjects were randomized into a 4-period double-blind crossover study by use of an orthogonal latin square design. Treatment periods were of 6 weeks' duration with titration to a higher dose after 4 weeks in those not reaching goal blood pressure (BP). Each active treatment was followed by a 3-week placebo washout. Casual clinic and 24-hour ambulatory BP (Accutracker II) were measured at the end of each treatment phase. Routine biochemistry was also performed after the placebo run-in, at the end of each active treatment phase, and after the placebo run-out. Of the 24 subjects entered (mean age 72.3 years, 38% men) 20 completed the whole study. Mean +/- standard deviation of supine clinic and daytime ambulatory BP on entry were 181/79 +/- 21/9 mm Hg and 165/82 +/- 23/15 mm Hg, respectively. All drugs reduced mean casual and ambulatory BP significantly relative to placebo but only hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril produced a consistent hypotensive effect throughout the entire 24-hour period. Isradipine and enalapril exhibited a relatively greater effect on reducing systolic BP than either hydrochlorothiazide or atenolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term clinical outcome of 60 prospectively studied patients with documented sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia that was not inducible during baseline programmed ventricular stimulation: 39 with cardiac arrest due to noninfarction ventricular fibrillation (VF) and 21 with mild hemodynamically compromising sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55 +/- 14% in the VF group and 50 +/- 13% in the VT group (difference not significant). Patients were discharged without conventional antiarrhythmic drugs and received only empirical beta-blocker therapy. During a mean follow-up period of 21 +/- 16 months (mean +/- SD), 10 of 60 patients (17%) died suddenly. The actuarial incidence of sudden death at 1 and 4 years was similar in both groups (VF group, 10 and 20%; VT group, 16 and 16%) (p = 0.48). The actuarial incidence of sudden cardiac death was significantly higher in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% than in those with > 40% (1-year incidence in VF group, 40 vs 0%; VT group, 50 vs 0%) (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01, respectively). Multivariate regression analysis identified left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% and previous myocardial infarction as the only independent predictor of sudden cardiac death. The occurrence of frequent ventricular pairs during Holter monitoring was the only independent predictor of sustained VT recurrences. It is concluded that patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in whom arrhythmia was non-inducible during baseline ventricular stimulation and not treated with antiarrhythmic therapy have a favorable outcome if left ventricular ejection fraction is high.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "The tail-flick withdrawal reflex commonly is used to study spinal nociceptive mechanisms; noradrenergic agonists administered intrathecally inhibit the tail-flick reflex in a dose-dependent manner. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to use fos-like immunoreactivity as a marker for neuronal activity to examine the population of neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn that are engaged by activation of nociceptive tail afferents, and (2) to determine whether fos-like immunoreactivity can be modulated by intrathecally administered alpha adrenoceptor agonists. Neurons demonstrating heat-evoked fos-like immunoreactivity were identified bilaterally in the sacral spinal cord in superficial and deep dorsal horn laminae. Heat-evoked fos-like immunoreactivity was inhibited dose-dependently by intrathecal norepinephrine (NE). The inhibition was attenuated significantly by: (1) phentolamine (PHEN), a nonselective alpha adrenoceptor antagonist; (2) yohimbine (YOH), an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist; and (3) prazosin (PRAZ), an alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist. Thus, both spinal alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors mediate the inhibition of heat-evoked fos-like immunoreactivity produced by intrathecal NE. ST-91, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, also inhibited significantly the expression of fos-like immunoreactivity; the inhibition was antagonized by YOH. In the absence of noxious heat, intrathecal NE dose-dependently evoked the expression of fos-like immunoreactivity in the superficial dorsal horn, which was antagonized by PHEN and PRAZ, but not by YOH, suggesting that the effect is mediated by spinal alpha-1 adrenoceptors.", 
    "4": "In the sarcolemma fraction of foot muscles of a fresh-water bivalve mollusc, Anodonta cygnea, a direct inhibitory, rather than stimulatory, effect of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, at micromolar concentration, on cAMP level and adenylate cyclase activity, was revealed. It was blocked by beta- but not alpha-adrenergic antagonists. A single class of [3H]dihydroalprenolol-binding sites with binding properties of beta-adrenergic receptor was detected in mollusc sarcolemma. Potentiation of the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol on mollusc adenylate cyclase activity by GTP or guanosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate at micromolar concentrations, and its elimination in the presence of guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate, were shown. The pertussis-toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation of sarcolemma 40-kDa protein [immunochemically related in the C-terminal part to pertussis-toxin-sensitive guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G-protein) alpha subunits of vertebrates], as well as the treatment of mollusc sarcolemma with antisera responsive to the C-terminus of vertebrate inhibitory G-protein (G(i)) alpha subunit led to elimination of the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol on adenylate cyclase activity. The results obtained suggest that beta-agonist-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase in A. cygnea foot muscle may be realized via the beta-adrenoreceptor/G(i) signalling pathway.", 
    "5": "Prenalterol, an allegedly beta 1-selective adrenergic agonist with high intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), was shown to be weakly lipolytic in rat adipocytes. However, in pertussis-toxin-treated adipocytes, the ISA of prenalterol was markedly increased (from 10-20% to approx. 100% of that of isoprenaline). The cellular sensitivity was also increased (EC50 approx. 60 nM and approx. 3 microM in pertussis-toxin-treated and control cells respectively). A similar effect was seen for other partial agonists such as the beta 2-selective agonist terbutaline and for beta-adrenergic antagonists with some intrinsic activity (metoprolol, pindolol). There was no clear change in sensitivity to isoprenaline's ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase in adipocyte membranes from pertussis-toxin-treated animals but the cyclase activity was increased approx. 4-fold in the presence of 1 microM-GTP. Prenalterol stimulated lipolysis by only small increases in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels (less than 10% of that seen with isoprenaline). Basal lipolysis was increased in cells from pertussis-toxin-treated rats and the cellular sensitivity to the non-degradable cAMP analogue, N6-monobutyryl-cAMP, was increased. In control cells, a submaximal concentration of prenalterol (0.1 microM) increased the sensitivity to the cAMP analogues, N6-monobutyryl-cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP. A low concentration (1 mM) of 8-bromo-cAMP also increased the effect of prenalterol. Similar effects were seen when the phosphodiesterase was inhibited. Thus (1) lipolysis is extremely sensitive to small increases in intracellular cAMP; (2) the degree of activation of adenylate cyclase and thus cAMP formation is the rate-limiting step for the biological response of partial agonists; (3) the inhibitory GTP-binding protein, Gi, is an important modulator ('tissue factor') of the beta-adrenergic agonistic property; (4) low levels of cAMP exert a priming effect on protein kinase A.", 
    "6": "Neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, migraine, vasospasm and epilepsy may involve different subtypes of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor. The 1B subtype, which has a unique pharmacology, was first identified in rodent brain. But a similar receptor could not be detected in human brain, suggesting the absence in man of a receptor with equivalent function. Recently a human receptor gene was isolated (designated 5-HT1B receptor, 5-HT1D beta receptor, or S12 receptor) which shares 93% identity of the deduced protein sequence with rodent 5-HT1B receptors. Although this receptor is identical to rodent 5-HT1B receptors in binding to 5-HT, it differs profoundly in binding to many drugs. Here we show that replacement of a single amino acid in the human receptor (threonine at residue 355) with a corresponding asparagine found in rodent 5-HT1B receptors renders the pharmacology of the receptors essentially identical. This demonstrates that the human gene does indeed encode a 1B receptor, which is likely to have the same biological functions as the rodent 5-HT1B receptor. In addition, these findings show that minute sequence differences between homologues of the same receptor from different species can cause large pharmacological variation. Thus, drug-receptor interactions should not be extrapolated from animal to human species without verification.", 
    "7": "The native atria remains intact after total artificial heart (TAH) implantation. The electrical activity of the recipient's atria can be recorded from wires placed during TAH implantation. Regulating TAH heart rate by coupling it with native atrial activity has the potential for a more physiologically responsive TAH. The reactivity of the atrial impulse rate is a critical component of this link, but little is known about atrial responsiveness after TAH placement. Two human and three animal TAH recipients had recordable atrial electrical activity. Human atrial impulse rate after TAH was relatively constant at rest but unresponsive to physiologic stimuli. Analysis of human atrial contraction provided no discernable effect on ventricular filling. Animal atrial impulse rate at rest was more rapid than calves without a TAH. The bovine TAH recipients had an atrial impulse rate that responded to catecholamine stimulation and blockade. Isoproterenol caused a significant rise in atrial impulse rate (152 +/- 16 impulses per minute to 216 +/- 24 impulses per minute; p < 0.05) and propranolol caused a decrease in atrial impulse rate (142 +/- 20 impulses per minute to 122 +/- 19 impulses per minute; p > 0.05). Despite beta blockade, the atrial impulse rate remained abnormally elevated secondary to unknown factors. Animal atrial contraction did appear to intermittently augment TAH ventricular filling. These data indicate that the atria remains electrically intact after TAH implantation. The human atrial impulse rate was unresponsive to physiologic stimuli although the animal atrial impulse rate was affected by exogenous catecholamine administration, but the rate remained abnormally rapid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether different regions of the rabbit vascular system show variations in the rate of plasminogen activator (PA) secretion. To start, we evaluated the time course, dose response and adrenergic specificity of PA release. Infusion of 1 microgram/kg of epinephrine stimulated a 116 +/- 60% (SD) increase in PA activity that peaked 30 to 60 s after epinephrine administration. Infusion of 1 microgram/kg of norepinephrine, isoproterenol and phenylephrine had no effect on PA activity. Pretreatment with phentolamine, an alpha adrenergic antagonist, blocked the release of PA by epinephrine while pretreatment with the beta blocker propranolol had no effect. This suggests that PA release in the rabbit was mediated by some form of alpha receptor. Significant arterio-venous differences in basal PA activity were found across the pulmonary and splanchnic vascular beds but not the lower extremity/pelvic bed. After stimulation with epinephrine, PA activity increased 46% across the splanchnic bed while no change was seen across the lower extremity/pelvic bed. We conclude that several vascular beds contribute to circulating PA activity in the rabbit, and that these beds secrete PA at different rates under both basal and stimulated conditions.", 
    "9": "SHEP (Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program) is a multicenter controlled therapeutic trial which included 4,736 subjects aged 60 years and over, who had isolated systolic hypertension at three consecutive visits at the outpatient clinic. The treatment, based on low doses of diuretic (chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg daily) combined, when necessary, with a cardioselective beta-blocker (atenolol 25 to 50 mg daily), significantly reduced the incidence of cerebrovascular and coronary events; the relative risk reduction for total mortality was not statistically significant. The beneficial cardiovascular effects were observed in both sexes, and in the 80+ age group. These results show that this particular therapy applied to this form of hypertension decreases the risk of both coronary and cerebral events, as was already suggested by the meta-analysis of the controlled therapeutic trials performed with diuretics, beta-blockers and other older antihypertensive drugs in patients with permanent diastolic hypertension. They also show the limitations of this therapeutic strategy, which controlled only 50 percent of the patients who were, however, highly selected, especially concerning the absence of associated morbid conditions and treatments. The need for, and feasibility of, new controlled therapeutic trials comparing the mortality and morbidity associated with various new antihypertensive therapies must now be discussed.", 
    "10": "A method for rapid extraction and identification of drugs in urine is described. The system utilizes a high-performance protein G immunoaffinity column coupled to a reversed-phase analytical column by use of a trapping column and switching valve. A small amount of antibody (5 micrograms drug-specific) is used for each analysis to extract either propranolol or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) from human urine. Urine diluted with phosphate-buffered saline is pumped directly through the protein G column thus eliminating time- and solvent-consuming sample preparation procedures. On-line ultraviolet or mass spectral analysis provides the means of drug detection and identification. With ultraviolet detection propranolol may be detected in spiked urine at the 250 pg/ml level. A Hewlett-Packard mass spectrometer modified for atmospheric pressure ionization and equipped with an ion spray source allows detection of propranolol in urine at 2.5 ng/ml and LSD at 500 pg/ml using single ion monitoring. The potential applicability of the technique for drug confirmations is discussed.", 
    "11": "The human beta 2 adrenergic receptor is a type IIIb membrane protein. It has a putative seven-transmembrane topology but lacks an amino-terminal cleavable signal sequence. The mechanism by which the amino terminus of the beta 2 receptor is translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is unknown. Furthermore, it is not known if translocation as a type IIIb protein is essential for the proper folding. Our studies indicate that conversion of beta 2 receptor from a type IIIb to a type IIIa membrane protein by introducing an NH2-terminal cleavable signal sequence enhances translocation of the receptor into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, thereby facilitating expression of functional receptor.", 
    "12": "Total 5-HT1, 5-HT1D and 5-HT1E binding sites were measured in homogenates of human frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, globus pallidus, caudate and putamen. Combined 5-HT1D/1E sites were the predominant 5-HT1 subtype (66-95% of total 5-HT1 sites in all regions except hippocampus (38% of total 5-HT1 sites). Globus pallidus contained the highest density and the highest proportion of 5HT1D sites (74% of total 5-HT1 sites). 5HT1D sites in the other brain areas accounted for 19-27% of the total 5-HT1 sites. The highest densities and the highest proportions of 5-HT1E sites were in caudate (72%) and putamen (64%) and the lowest density and lowest proportion in hippocampus (16%).", 
    "13": "Brain 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors are important targets for drug-induced modulation of 5-HT function in vivo. However, very few compounds are available that are effective antagonists at 5-HT1 receptors, thus hampering the progress of fundamental as well as clinical research in this area. The present study assessed the usefulness of the beta-adrenolytic agent (-)-penbutolol (and its (+)-counterpart) as a 5-HT1A receptor-blocking agent. The compound was found to counteract, in a stereospecific fashion, not only the behavioural and hypothermic but also the in vivo 5-HT synthesis/turnover-reducing effects of the specific 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). These findings indicate that (-)-penbutolol is an antagonist at both postsynaptic receptors and somatodendritic autoreceptors of the 5-HT1A subtype. Thus, (-)-penbutolol represents a useful addition to the array of pharmacological tools available for the study of central 5-HT1 receptor-mediated functions.", 
    "14": "Ibutilide fumarate is currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The cardiovascular effects of ibutilide and its d- and l-stereoisomers, U82208E and U82209E were tested in an isolated rabbit myocardium system. In a series of repeated measures experiments, threshold, effective refractory period, force of contraction, conduction time and rate were measured at various pacing frequencies in isolated papillary muscles, ventricular muscle strips and right atria exposed to 10(-7), 10(-6) and 10(-5) M drug. Although there were occasional instances where one form had a greater or lesser effect on a given parameter, overall there was little pharmacological difference between the racemic mixture and its constituent forms. At the highest dose, effective refractory periods at 1 and 3 Hz increased by 18-32 ms, conduction times measured at 3 Hz increased by 27-30% and atrial rate decreased by 19-32%, while threshold and force of contraction were generally unaffected. In this study there were no clear cut pharmacologic differences between the three forms of this class III antiarrhythmic agent. Parallel studies to determine pA2 values of ibutilide and sotalol demonstrated that ibutilide possesses weak beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties.", 
    "15": "The biodistribution of (-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-[5,7-3H-benzimidazol-2-one (CGP12177, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) and 1-[2-(3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxy)-(5-3H-phenoxy)]-2-propanol methanesulfonate, (CGP26505, a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) was studied in rats pretreated with various alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (5 min before 3H injection, in dosages at which the drugs demonstrated the expected selectivity). Cardiac and pulmonary radioactivity were measured after 10 min, when specific binding was maximal. Uptake of [3H]CGP12177 was linked to binding to beta-adrenoceptors since it was not affected by prazosin or yohimbine, and was equally well inhibited by propranolol, unlabelled CGP12177 and isoprenaline. Moreover, atenolol and CGP20712A inhibited [3H]CGP12177 uptake in heart (predominantly beta 1-adrenoceptors) more potently than ICI 118,551, while in lungs (predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptors) ICI 118,551 was more potent than atenolol or CGP20712A. In contrast, [3H]CGP26505 uptake in the target organs was equally effectively inhibited by propranolol and ICI 118,551, and significantly lowered by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists. We conclude that [11C]CGP12177, but not [11C]CGP2605 will be suitable for positron emission tomography imaging of beta-adrenoceptors in animals.", 
    "16": "The routine medical management of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has undergone major changes in the last decade. Several large-scale trials have firmly established the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy, beta blockers, and aspirin in the treatment of AMI. The critical issues include reducing myocardial oxygen demand and restoring adequate blood supply to the ischemic regions of the myocardium. As a result, the ability to intervene in patients with AMI has improved significantly. The purpose of this review is to discuss briefly the results of major trials of primary and secondary pharmacological intervention which had a direct impact on the care of patients with AMI. It concludes with current recommendations for the management of patients with AMI.", 
    "17": "1. Biotransformation studies with five concentrations of racemic propranolol were conducted using the filamentous fungus Cunninghamella echinulata ATCC 9244. 2. The rate of formation and subsequent disappearance of a new major metabolite, 8-hydroxypropranolol, was dose-dependent. Desisopropylpropranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol were also formed. 4-Hydroxypropranolol was the major fungal metabolite in earlier studies. 3. Propranolol exerted a dose-dependent response on biotransformation, fungal growth, dextrose utilization, ammonia formation and incubation broth pH. Determination of dextrose utilization and incubation broth pH would provide reliable, cost-effective and convenient alternative methods for cytotoxicological evaluation.", 
    "18": "Betaxolol is a new beta-blocker that has been reported to have beta 1-selectivity, and it is devoid of both membrane stabilizing action and intrinsic sympathomimetic action. The effects of betaxolol on systemic and regional hemodynamics were examined in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) by a microsphere method and compared with the effects of atenolol. A single oral administration of betaxolol at 1 and 10 mg/kg decreased the mean arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner. At the same doses, atenolol also showed a similar but weak hypotensive effect. Both of these drugs at the high dose decreased cardiac output and heart rate and at the low dose, did not. Total peripheral resistance decreased by only betaxolol at the low dose. Betaxolol showed a tendency to normalize the hemodynamic abnormalities which were observed in the kidney, spleen and gastrointestinal tract of SHR, while atenolol did not. It should be noted that betaxolol increased the flow rate in the kidney, which may be explained by its direct vasodilatory action on renal blood vessels. In conclusion, betaxolol showed an antihypertensive action at the doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg, exhibited the characteristics of a beta 1-blocker and produced preferable effects on regional hemodynamics in SHR.", 
    "19": "A new generic drug of atenolol, Atenolol (A), (Fahlberg-List Magdeburg, Germany) was studied in comparison with standard preparation (S) in their pharmacokinetic behaviour in 12 patients under steady state conditions. The concentration-time-profile of both preparations was nearly identical. The half time of elimination was calculated for A at 6.5 h and for S at 5.9 h. From the ratio of AUC from A to S (extent of absorption) a mean bioequivalence of 103.1% (90%-confidence limits 0.85-1.21) was estimated. Corresponding values for the rate of absorption were in the mean 102.8% (90%-confidence limits 0.94-1.12).",

The two methods are based on reaction rate measurements following the absorbance of vanadium (IV) species produced, spectrophotometrically at 750 nm. The applicability of the methods was tested by assaying atenolol in drug formulations and comparing the results obtained statistically with the BP method.", 
    "21": "1. The effects of swimming-induced stress on rat sensitivity to norepinephrine were studied. 2. Through microscopic analysis of the stomach from swimming stressed rats significant ulceration was observed, confirming that the stress situation was really present. 3. Sensitivity to norepinephrine either in the presence or in the absence of cocaine and propranolol in acutely swimming stressed rats was not altered significantly. 4. Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed in rats 2 days before swimming and acute stress resulted in a supersensitivity to norepinephrine, indicating that adrenal glands may, at least, partially mediate the sensitivity to this drug in vasa deferentia isolated from these animals.", 
    "22": "Painful stimuli have been shown to inhibit gastric motility in animal experiments and delay gastric emptying in humans. The aim of the present study was to investigate in detail mechanisms involved in pain-induced gastric inhibition. Pain stimulation by exerting pressure on a testicle induced a prompt gastric relaxation which lasted throughout the period of stimulation. Pain-induced gastric relaxation was significantly reduced by the selective alpha-1 blocker, prazosin, and by the non-selective beta-blocker, propranolol. Similarly pain-induced inhibition of gastric tone was significantly reduced by bilateral cervical vagotomy. In contrast, gastric relaxation following pain stimulation was significantly potentiated by the selective adrenergic alpha-2 blocker, yohimbine. Combined administration of prazosin and propranolol followed by bilateral cervical vagotomy abolished gastric relaxation in response to pain stimulation. In conclusion, gastric relaxation in response to painful stimulation was found to be reflex-mediated via sympathetic neurons acting on alpha-1 and beta receptors and possibly also via vagal non-adrenergic fibres. Pain-induced inhibition of gastric tone was significantly increased by yohimbine. It is suggested that yohimbine by blocking presynaptic inhibitory receptors on adrenergic neurons facilitates the release of noradrenaline in response to pain stimulation.", 
    "23": "An unusual case of familial Long QT syndrome is reported. After a longstanding symptom free interval this eight year old girl experienced multiple episodes of malignant ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardias of the torsades-de-pointes type and ventricular flutter. The treatment with beta- and alpha-blocking agents, phenytoin, calcium antagonists, clonidine and magnesium in increasing doses and varying combinations was unsuccessful. A left sided cardiac sympathectomy failed also to control the life threatening ventricular arrhythmias and to decrease the relative high mean heart rate. Finally a consecutive right cardiac sympathetic denervation in combination with an experimental class I antiarrhythmic agent led to a subjective and objective improvement in the patient's condition which allowed discharge from hospital. Despite a symptom free interval of four months and nearly normalized Holter ECG results the longterm prognosis remains unclear. This unusual case discloses interesting features, because 1) it supports the theory of an intracardiac cellular anomaly rather than the imbalance hypothesis, 2. chronic beta-blocker treatment possibly resulted in an up-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors which made beta-blocking agents ineffective despite high doses, and 3. an consecutive right sided cardiac sympathectomy resulting in bilateral cardiac sympathetic denervation had to be done-an intervention which is seldom performed in the Long QT syndrome.", 
    "24": "Isolated hepatocytes of the American eel (Anguilla rostrata LeSueur) and brown bullhead (Ictaluras nebulosus) have been used to characterize the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists (epinephrine, phenylephrine, isoproterenol) and antagonists (phentolamine, propranolol) on calcium flux (influx, efflux) and cytosolic free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i). Bullhead hepatocytes have higher influx but lower efflux of Ca2+ than eel hepatocytes, which may relate to the primary source for changes in [Ca2+]i. Adrenergic agonists did not affect influx, but significantly enhanced efflux in eel hepatocytes (not bullhead) and [Ca2+]i in both species. Increases in efflux and in [Ca2+]i were blocked by alpha-antagonists (phentolamine) but not beta-antagonists (propranolol) when present in 100-fold excess of the agonist. Isoproterenol had no significant effect on either parameter tested. This study supports our hypothesis that liver cell Ca2+ homeostasis is modulated by alpha-adrenoceptor-linked pathways in these two fish species as has been previously demonstrated for the rat.", 
    "25": "Evaluation of ventricular performance by the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) has been extensively performed in the adult heart using the conductance technique. We undertook this study to validate the conductance technique and to generate ESPVRs in the small heart. To validate the technique, we simultaneously measured left ventricular volume by the conductance catheter and biplane cineangiography in nine piglets during changes in volume and contractility. Raw conductance volumes correlated highly with cineangiographic volumes (R = 0.97), and the slope was near identity (1.11 +/- 0.04). However, 'alpha Vc-corrected' volumes correlated less well (R = 0.85), probably because of errors induced by the saline technique for alpha Vc. We evaluated the ESPVR in nine lambs by inferior vena cava (IVC) occlusion, aortic occlusion, and volume infusion at rest and during changes in contractility. Reliable and linear ESPVRs were obtained in almost all IVC and aortic occlusions but not in volume infusions. Neither slope (Ees) nor position (V14) significantly changed over time or with dobutamine, but both changed after propranolol, supporting studies showing a limited contractile reserve in the newborn. However, Ees was 25% less steep when generated by IVC occlusion as compared to aortic occlusion. We conclude that the ESPVR can be reliably generated in the small heart using the conductance technique, but that it is sensitive to the loading technique.", 
    "26": "The effect of topical 0.5% timolol on the permeability of the blood-aqueous barrier to plasma protein was studied in ten young normal volunteers. Before and after instillation of timolol in one eye, simultaneous measurements of aqueous flow rate, f(t), by fluorophotometry and protein concentration in the anterior chamber, Ca(t), with a laser flare-cell meter were made in both eyes at hourly intervals. The coefficient of protein entry into the anterior chamber was calculated using an equation formulating protein dynamics in the anterior chamber from the changes in f(t), Ca(t), and plasma protein concentration. The Ca(t) in the treated eye showed a maximum increase of 37 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) as compared with that in the fellow eye 5 hours after instillation, while the f(t) in the treated eye showed a maximum reduction of 30 +/- 4% 2 hours after instillation. The intraocular pressure in the treated eye showed a maximum reduction of 3.0 +/- 0.3 mmHg 2 hours after instillation. No significant changes were found in the coefficient of protein entry in the anterior chamber between before and after timolol instillation or between timolol-treated and fellow untreated eyes. These results indicated that topical 0.5% timolol does not affect the permeability of the blood-aqueous barrier to plasma protein significantly.", 
    "27": "The pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral nadolol, a long-acting beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were investigated in six children receiving the drug for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia. In the youngest patient (age 3 months), no distribution phase was seen. In children younger than 22 months of age, nadolol is more rapidly eliminated (t1/2 = 4.3 hours or less) than in older children, in whom elimination is more similar to that in adults (t1/2 approximately 7.3-15.7 hours). After intravenous administration, nadolol displayed two-compartment pharmacokinetics with a distribution phase (t1/2 = 0.2-1.1 hours) followed by elimination. Large changes in nadolol pharmacokinetics may occur during the first year of life. Nadolol should be used cautiously in infants.",

The electrophysiological effects of a series of drugs with Class I antiarrhythmic activity were examined in sheep Purkinje fibres, superfused in vitro with either a normal or hypoxic, hyperkalaemic and acidotic physiological salt solution (PSS). 2. In normal sheep Purkinje fibres, lignocaine, disopyramide, nicainoprol and propranolol all significantly reduced action potential height and the maximum rate of depolarization of phase zero (MRD) and abbreviated the action potential, without modifying resting membrane potential (RMP). 3. Verapamil at the highest concentration studied, 8 microM, significantly reduced MRD with an associated slight membrane depolarization and abbreviated action potential duration measured at 50% repolarization (APD50). 4. Superfusion of sheep Purkinje fibres with a hypoxic, hyperkalaemic and acidotic PSS resulted in marked reductions in resting membrane potential, upstroke and duration of the action potential. 5. In the presence of modified PSS, lignocaine, propranolol and verapamil all reduced MRD to a greater extent than in normal PSS. The effects of nicainoprol on MRD were not affected whereas those of disopyramide were significantly attenuated. 6. Under simulated ischaemic conditions, lignocaine, propranolol and nicainoprol did not produce a concentration-dependent reduction in action potential duration whereas disopyramide and verapamil, respectively, prolonged and abbreviated both APD50 and APD90. 7. The Na+ channel blocking actions of the different subtypes of Class I antiarrhythmic agents studied, as well as their effects on action potential duration, were modified differently by simulated ischaemia.", 
    "29": "To assess the effect of selective beta 1-blockade (atenolol and betaxolol) and nonselective beta-blockade (propranolol) on glucose turnover in subjects with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus during moderate exercise.", 
    "30": "Five subjects with type I diabetes were infused with insulin and then exercised for 1 h, after pretreatment with each of the three drugs or saline and, on a separate day, after withdrawal of insulin. Glucose turnover was measured using tritiated glucose.", 
    "31": "Plasma glucose, initially 9.2 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (mean +/- SE) when insulin infused and 14.0 +/- 0.8 when insulin was withdrawn, fell on exercise by 3.4 +/- 1.1 mmol/L (P < 0.05) saline, 4.0 +/- 0.8 mmol/L (P < 0.01) with betaxolol, 3.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/L (P < 0.01) with atenolol, 5.0 +/- 0.6 mmol/L (P < 0.005) with propranolol, and 1.7 +/- 1.0 mmol/L (NS) when insulin was withdrawn. Propranolol, but not the other beta-blockers, caused a significantly greater fall in glucose on exercise than during the control study. Glucose appearance rate (Ra) was similar basally and rose to an almost identical level in all five groups during exercise. Glucose disappearance rate (Rd) rose similarly during exercise, except after propranolol when the rise was significantly greater than with saline (P < 0.01). Failure of glucose to change significantly during exercise when insulin had been withdrawn was associated with the smallest rise in Rd and the highest nonesterified fatty acid concentrations. Propranolol and betaxolol, but not atenolol, reduced nonesterified fatty acids.", 
    "32": "We conclude that the greater fall in glucose on exercise after beta-blocking drugs is probably largely a direct effect of beta 2-blockade on muscle, increasing the exercise-induced rise in Rd glucose. This offers support to the use of beta 1-specific drugs, where beta-blockade is necessary in type I diabetes.", 
    "33": "To evaluate the influence of acute beta-blockade on the ability of predischarge exercise test data to predict long-term prognosis in patients admitted for suspected acute myocardial infarction, patients randomized at hospital admission to intravenous metoprolol or placebo were studied. Among 190 patients discharged alive, total 4-year mortality was 20.5% (n = 39); (33 cardiac deaths, 6 non-cardiac deaths). Non-fatal infarction rate was 6.8% (n = 13). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that total mortality and non-fatal infarctions were independently predicted by (a) inability to perform predischarge stress testing (event-free survival for patients exercise tested 79.5% vs 56.9% for patients not eligible for testing; relative risk (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.78; P = 0.01), and (b) low predischarge exercise capacity (RR 1.44, CI 1.08-1.93; P = 0.034). ST segment shift > or = 1 mm did not predict mortality or reinfarction. Administration of metoprolol in the acute phase did not influence the predictive value of these parametres. It is concluded that assessment of exercise capacity at early exercise testing yields independent information for later death and myocardial infarctions, and that beta-blockade with metoprolol does not influence the predictive value of early exercise testing.", 
    "34": "The effects of halothane (1-3 MAC) on the isometric twitch tension, the contracture tension induced by 1 mM barium (Ba2+) in the rabbit right ventricular papillary muscles, and the transient tension response to step length change during barium contracture, were analyzed in the presence of either alpha (3 x 10(-5) M phenylephrine+10(-6) M bupranolol) or beta (10(-7) M isoproterenol) stimulants. The isometric twitch tension was significantly decreased with the administration of halothane dose dependently, in the presence of both alpha or beta stimulants. Both the time to peak (TP) and the time to half relaxation (THR) were remarkably shortened with the administration of halothane in the presence of both alpha or beta stimulants. The Ba2+ contracture tension was also decreased with the administration of halothane dose dependently in the presence of both alpha or beta stimulants. The tension transient became faster with the administration of halothane in the presence of the alpha stimulant, but not in the presence of the beta stimulant. These results suggest that halothane decreases the number of active crossbridges regardless of the inotropic states induced by the two different stimulants. Also on increase the rate of crossbridge kinetics occurs in the presence of the alpha stimulant but not in response to the beta stimulant.", 
    "35": "A sensitive and selective assay has been developed for the identification and quantitation of 3-amino-1-phenyl butane (3-APB), a metabolite of labetalol, in biological fluids using electron impact gas chromatography/mass-selective detection. Samples were extracted with n-hexane, derivatized with heptafluorobutyric anhydride and chromatographed on a cross-linked fused-silica capillary column. A positive EI spectrum was obtained using a mass-selective detector. Identification of the metabolite was accomplished using an authentic standard; quantitation was performed in the selected ion monitoring mode using ions m/z 345 (M+) and 132. The assay was linear over the calibration range of 0.5-1000 ng of the analyte and the intra-sample coefficients of variation were less than 12% in all cases. The absolute recovery of 3-APB following extraction from urine and bile was found to be 102.9 +/- 4.9% and 98.3 +/- 1.45% (mean +/- SEM) respectively. The minimum quantitation limit of the assay was 0.5 ng ml-1 (approximately 2 pg injected). Application of the assay in a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study of labetalol in sheep is demonstrated. The metabolite was detected in urine and bile samples obtained from adult non-pregnant sheep following labetalol administration. The cumulative amount of 3-APB excreted in urine over 24 h was found to be 71.55 micrograms in one animal following a 100 mg dose of labetalol. Evidence for biliary excretion, glucuronidation and sulfation of 3-APB was also found.", 
    "36": "Actions of activators of glibenclamide sensitive K+ channels on canine colonic circular muscle were investigated. Cromakalim as well as its (-) enantiomer lemakalim caused inhibition of spontaneous phasic contractile activity (EC50's 4.4 +/- 0.1 x 10(-7) M and 2.3 +/- 0.4 x 10(-7) M, respectively) and of carbachol induced activity (EC50's: 9.4 +/- 5.1 x 10(-7) M and 4.3 +/- 1.4 x 10(-7) M, respectively). Cromakalim and lemakalim effects were completely inhibited by glibenclamide. Additive effects between K+ channel activators and other drugs relaxing colonic muscle (the L-type calcium channel blocker D600 and forskolin) were seen. A physiological role for specific glibenclamide sensitive K+ channels, if existing, remains unresolved. The present study indicates that the non-adrenergic inhibitory nerves do not act through these channels, neither does stimulation of muscarinic or beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "37": "The binding of propafenone (PF) and 5-hydroxypropafenone (5-OH-PF) in serum and in solutions of isolated serum proteins was examined by equilibrium dialysis. Both PF and 5-OH-PF displayed pH-dependent binding in serum and in a solution of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). PF displayed extensive binding to AAG (i.e., free fraction of 0.08 +/- 0.02), whereas the binding of 5-OH-PF to AAG was moderate (i.e., free fraction of 0.54 +/- 0.10). The removal of lipoproteins from serum did not alter the free fraction of PF but significantly increased the free fraction of 5-OH-PF compared with that in intact serum. Both PF and 5-OH-PF displayed concentration-dependent binding in a 19.3-mumol AAG solution. Concentration-independent binding was apparent in solutions of human serum albumin, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, and very low density lipoproteins over the PF and 5-OH-PF concentration ranges examined. By use of previously determined binding parameters (affinities and capacities), the binding model of PF provided an estimate of the free fraction in serum that was similar to the observed free fraction, although the free fraction of 5-OH-PF was overestimated. The distribution of PF and 5-OH-PF into red blood cells was extensive when buffer was used as the supernatant; however, when serum was used as supernatant, the amounts of PF and 5-OH-PF that were distributed into red blood cells decreased substantially. PF and 5-OH-PF interacted with all of the proteins examined.",

In a prospective randomized crossover study of 20 patients with impaired left ventricular function (ejection fraction of 28% +/- 8%) and recurrent VT in spite of treatment with amiodarone, we compared the efficacy and safety of adjuvant therapy with metoprolol, 50 mg two times daily and xamoterol, 200 mg two times daily. Metoprolol caused hemodynamic deterioration in five patients, and only one also experienced intolerance to xamoterol. Sustained VT was inducible in all 20 patients who were receiving amiodarone alone but was suppressed or rendered nonsustained in 8 of 20 patients during treatment with amiodarone plus xamoterol and in 6 of 17 patients during treatment with amiodarone plus metoprolol. Addition of xamoterol restored sinus rhythm in four patients who presented with incessant VT, and metoprolol was effective for three of them. Neither beta-blocker significantly altered tachycardia cycle length or any electrophysiologic parameter other than the slowing of the sinus rate. Both beta-blockers suppressed exercise-induced VT in 3 of 4 patients, and addition of xamoterol significantly increased treadmill exercise duration (7.1 +/- 1.8 min) compared with administration of amiodarone alone (3.8 +/- 1.5 min; p < 0.01). Fourteen patients were discharged with prescriptions for amiodarone-beta-blocker combinations. During a mean follow-up period of 13 months (range, 2 to 24 months), there were three cases of recurrent VT (in all patients VT remained inducible) and no sudden deaths.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Carvedilol, a novel multiple-action antihypertensive agent, has been shown to scavenge free radicals and inhibit lipid peroxidation in swine heart and rat brain homogenates. Therefore, we studied the neuroprotective effect of carvedilol on cultured cerebellar neurons and on CA1 hippocampal neurons of gerbils exposed to brain ischemia.",

    "55": "The effect of indomethacin, theophylline, and propranolol on ethanol augmentation of insulin secretion after intravenous glucose stimulation was studied. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed with and without pretreatment with oral ethanol. The role of indomethacin was evaluated in six healthy subjects; the effect of theophylline and propranolol on ethanol augmentation in insulin secretion was studied in five and six subjects, respectively. Ethanol pretreatment was followed by increased insulin (P < .01) and C-peptide areas (P < .01) after intravenous glucose (Area, 0 to 20 minutes). Indomethacin suppressed the ability of ethanol to augment insulin (P < .01) and C-peptide (P < .01) responses. Neither theophylline nor propranolol affected ethanol augmentation of insulin secretion. In conclusion, indomethacin probably interferes with the mechanism for ethanol augmentation of glucose-induced insulin secretion. It is suggested that inositol phospholipids take part in the effect of ethanol to augment insulin secretion, and that indomethacin interferes with the metabolism of inositol phospholipids.",

    "57": "In this study, we used the fluorescent probe Fluo-3 to show that an increase in cytosolic free calcium, [Ca2+]i, occurred when suspensions of bovine neutrophils were incubated with sublethal concentrations of P. haemolytica leukotoxin. This increase in [Ca2+]i was dependent on the concentration of leukotoxin present in the medium and, at a given concentration of leukotoxin, dependent on the external calcium concentration. The calcium channel blocker verapamil and the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol inhibited leukotoxin-stimulated Ca2+ gain, as did a neutralizing antileukotoxin monoclonal antibody. As reported previously, incubation of bovine neutrophils with partially purified leukotoxin stimulated a vigorous luminol-dependent chemiluminescence response (LDCL). The present study shows that LDCL stimulation was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium and was inhibited by the addition of verapamil and propranolol. These data indicate that bovine neutrophils exhibit a considerable increase in cytoplasmic free calcium when they are incubated with P. haemolytica leukotoxin in the presence of external calcium. They also provide evidence that an increased [Ca2+]i is required for functional activation of the bovine neutrophil oxidative burst by P. haemolytica leukotoxin.",

Basal tear turnover is defined as the tear turnover at the lowest level of reflex lacrimation possible under physiologic conditions. Tear turnover was calculated from the decay of the tear fluorescence after instillation of fluorescein. Minimal influence of reflex lacrimation was obtained by instilling 1 microliter of 2% fluorescein without touching the eye and by discarding measurements performed in the first 5 min. Minimization was confirmed by a monophasic decay of tear fluorescence. The values of patients who used timolol and those who did not use timolol were significantly lower than those of healthy control subjects (mean values in percent/minute +/- standard deviation: 10.1 +/- 3.2, 12.3 +/- 4.1, and 15.6 +/- 5.4, respectively; Student's t-test: P < 0.02).

    "59": "Bilateral cervical cooling blockade of the vagi abolishes the gastric migrating motility complex (MMC), except for the pylorus. The present study investigated if this finding is caused by adrenergic inhibition of the stomach via sympathetic nerves entering the vagi below the level of the blockade. Stomach and upper small bowel motor activity was monitored in five chronic dogs whose vagosympathetic nerve trunks were previously isolated in bilateral, cervical skin loops to permit blockade by cooling. Adrenergic blockade was performed by an initial bolus injection of phentolamine (0.3 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.3 mg/kg) followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of the combined drugs at a rate of 1.5 mg.kg-1.h-1 for phentolamine and 0.3 mg.kg-1.h-1 for propranolol. Bilateral cervical vagal blockade abolished the gastric MMC, with persistence of phase III of the MMC in the upper small bowel. During combined vagal and adrenergic blockade, gastric contractions were absent in 4 of the 22 duodenal complexes observed. In the other duodenal complexes, intermittent gastric contractions were associated with all phases of the intestinal MMC, including phase I. At times, this contractile activity was accentuated during phase III but never reached the intensity of activity or showed the typical coordination features of the gastric MMC seen with the vagi intact. Therefore, unopposed adrenergic inhibition of the stomach does not explain the absence of the gastric MMC during vagal cooling blockade. Under normal circumstances, the vagus nerve is the most important pathway for central control of the appearance of the gastric MMC.",

The concentration of PPRibP has been examined in the rat adrenal gland at various times after induction of diabetes with STZ, in view of the key role it plays in the synthesis of Purs and Pyrs. The PPRibP level was exceptionally high in the adrenal gland and increased faster than the rate of growth during the initial rapid growth phase--the first 7 days after STZ was given; PPRibP synthetase showed a parallel increase. Formation of R5P via the oxidative and nonoxidative segments of the PPP also was measured. The oxidative enzymes, G-6-PD and 6-PGD, increased in parallel with growth during the early phase, but showed a more marked rise during the secondary, slower, growth phase seen 6 wk after STZ was given, when this may be associated with the known sustained rise in plasma corticosteroids. The nonoxidative enzymes of the PPP, an alternate route for the production of R5P, showed smaller changes. The specifically high adrenal concentration of PPRibP may be related to the high Km for PPRibP (250 microM) of the first enzyme of the de novo pathway of Pur synthesis, as such synthesis may be required in the rat to replace the net loss of ATP associated with catecholamine secretion. Factors controlling PPRibP synthetase and their potential relative importance in the adrenal gland have been considered.",

Among these properties, beta 1-selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, lipid solubility, may affect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of beta-blockers. It could appear that lipid soluble drugs gain access to the Central Nervous System (CNS) more easily. But CNS effects of beta-blockers are probably modulated by other parameters.

    "75": "Antiarrhythmic agents may be prescribed in the post-infarction period either as systematic therapy to prevent sudden death or as prophylactic treatment against recurrences of documented life-threatening arrhythmias. Systematic therapy or even the treatment of symptomatic ventricular extrasystoles by Class IC anti-arrhythmics is associated with an increased risk, especially in patients with a low risk of sudden death at the outset. Betablockers are effective on symptoms: they are not always effective on the arrhythmia but at least they do not aggravate the mortality of these patients. However, for high risk patients with post-infarction left ventricular dysfunction, betablockers are the only drugs which have a proven efficacy: they should therefore be prescribed, especially those whose efficacy has been demonstrated, at the same dosages as those used in clinical trials. Preventive treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia should be chosen with respect to the patient's hemodynamic status. When the ejection fraction is under 40%, amiodarone and betablockers are the drugs of first intention, with controls of their efficacy by the inability to induce or the slowing of the tachycardia rhythm during endocavitary electrophysiological studies.", 
    "76": "Beta-blockers have been used after myocardial infarction since 1965: however, it was not until the beginning of the 80s that the large multicentre clinical trials published results showing clearly their beneficial effects and leading to their widespread usage: betablockers significantly reduce the medium term (1 to 3 years) risk of death (-22 to -24%), especially sudden death (-32%) and the frequency of recurrent infarction (-27%). The cardio-protection so obtained is multifactorial, essentially related to their antiarrhythmic, antiischemic and antihypertensive effects. It has been established that beta-blockade should be instituted as soon as possible in the hours following the infarct (intravenous relayed by oral administration) and may be useful associated with aspirin. Although the large scale clinical trials did not determine the optimal dosage or the duration for which treatment should be administered, they did show that the groups of high risk patients were those to benefit the most from this therapy. Beta-blockers are usually well tolerated. However, it must be pointed out that 18% of patients were excluded from the two principal trials (only 25 to 30% of infarct patients were included) because of contraindications to beta-blockers and that 25 to 30% of the patients initially included had to interrupt the treatment because of side effects.",

In order to assess whether this attitude is justified by published data on their efficacy, a meta-analysis of trials of anti-ischemic drugs in myocardial infarction was performed. The early mortality was 13.3% in the group treated by IV nitrates in the acute phase of myocardial infarction and 17.2% in control groups, reducing the risk by a quarter (95% confidence interval of the odds ratio (CI): 0.55-0.95). When all nitrate derivative trials were grouped together, the reduction in the risk of death of 21% was significant (from 15% to 11.8%) (CI: 0.59-0.94). Although oral nitrate derivatives introduced during the acute phase and continued for several weeks induced a non-significant reduction in mortality of 16%, when given intravenously, the benefits on early and longer term mortality were unquestionable. The mortality was 9.8% in the groups treated by calcium channel blockers and 9.3% in control groups (NS); the recurrent infarct rate was 4.8% and 5.4% respectively (NS). In this family of drugs, there was no product which distinguished itself from the others with regard to beneficial or adverse effects.

Of the 8 cardiac deaths, 6 seemed to be related to the WPW syndrome, a prevalence of 7.8% and an annual incidence of 1.1/1000. The main risk factors which were identified were: age 62 +/- 8 years versus 37 +/- 15 years in survivors; p < 0.02--associated organic heart disease, especially ischaemic heart disease (5/6)--the description of severe symptoms, in particular recurrent syncope--documented malignant spontaneous or induced arrhythmias (5/6)--anterograde AV conduction with an effective refractory period < or = 230 msec in 4, though it was only 270 msec in the other 2 patients, indicating that this parameter is not specific--amiodarone (6/6) did not prevent the fatal outcome in this particular group of patients. In the \"benign\" forms, only betablocker drugs could significantly reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms, especially when compared with Class I or IC antiarrhythmics. These results suggest that the indications of radical treatment should be widened in high risk patients, especially when elderly and with associated coronary artery disease. They also suggest that the role of betablocker drugs should be reevaluated in the so-called \"benign\" symptomatic forms.", 
    "79": "Epinephrine (0.3 microgram/min) or isoproterenol (0.2 microgram/min) were infused for 40 min in rats to determine the role of catecholamines in the short-term control of plasma magnesium levels. Phentolamine (0.2 and 1 mg/kg) or propranolol (5 mg/kg), injected i.p. 10 min following the beginning of the infusion with catecholamines, were used to block alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors. Epinephrine alone elevated the systolic while decreasing the diastolic blood pressure and initially increased heart rate by 8% to 455 +/- 25 beats/min. Plasma potassium declined by 24% but magnesium levels remained constant. Following 0.2 mg/kg of phentolamine, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 40% and 55% to 95 +/- 11 and 39 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively. Potassium levels were further reduced by 8%. Administration of this dose of phentolamine increased magnesium levels by 8%. Magnesium levels were elevated by 19% to 2.38 +/- 0.20 mEq/l after 1 mg/kg of phentolamine, possibly due to excessive hemodynamic derangements. Propranolol reversed the hypokalemic and hemodynamic effects of the epinephrine infusion without altering plasma magnesium. Similarly, propranolol abolished the tachycardia and hypokalemia elicited by isoproterenol without affecting magnesium levels. These results suggest that catecholamines play no major role in the short-term control of plasma magnesium in the rat.", 
    "80": "In order to examine the possible role of coronary artery spasm in the pathogenesis of unstable angina, provocative testing for coronary spasm was performed in 43 patients with unstable angina who had 0- or 1-vessel disease. Coronary spasm was induced in 20 (65%) of 31 patients by hyperventilation testing (ST increases in 18, ST decreases in 2). Anginal attacks with either ST-segment elevation or ST-segment depression in patients without a significant organic stenosis were induced in 23 (55%) of 42 patients during treadmill exercise testing. Coronary artery spasm, showing severe (> or = 90%) vasoconstriction with angina and/or ischemic electrocardiographic ST-segment deviation, was also documented angiographically in 42 (98%) of 43 patients following intracoronary injection of acetylcholine. We conclude that dynamic coronary obstruction plays an important role in the genesis of attacks in patients with unstable angina who had 0- or 1-vessel organic coronary artery disease.", 
    "81": "The effect of an atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL-35135 on leukotriene B4-induced-guinea pig eosinophil chemotaxis was studied. BRL-35135 and SC-41930 (leukotriene B4-antagonist) inhibited the chemotaxis in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 9.0 x 10(-6) and 2.6 x 10(-7) M, respectively). However, isoproterenol, fenoterol and another atypical beta-agonist, BRL-37344 had no effects. The inhibitory effect of BRL-35135 was not affected by (+/-)-propranolol (10(-4) M). In contrast, the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, (-)-alprenolol (10(-4) M) dextrally shifted the inhibitory curve of BRL-35135. The response to BRL-35135 was antagonized in a competitive manner by (-)-alprenolol, with the slope of the Schild plot close to unity, and a pA2 value of 5.62. These findings suggest that guinea pig eosinophils possess an \"atypical receptor\", which differs from either beta 1-, beta 2- or atypical beta-adrenoceptor on guinea pig ileum, and through which eosinophil chemotaxis can be modulated by BRL-35135.",

A significant hypotensive effect was achieved in 81%, 58%, 44%, 43% and 37% of patients treated with labetalol, nifedipine, nadolol, propranolol, diltiazem, respectively. An increase in verapamil daily dose from 240 to 600 mg led to a rise in efficacy from 27 to 75% without an increase in the number of side effects. The antihypertensive effect of the drugs is shown to persist in long-term treatment as shown by exercise tests and static loads.",

Many beta-adrenergic agonists did not stimulate porcine adipose tissue slice lipolysis unless theophylline, an antagonist of the adenosine receptor was added to the incubation medium. 2. In contrast to previous results, theophylline itself was an effective lipolytic agonist in tissue from many pigs. 3. Lipolysis was partially inhibited by adenosine or phenylisopropyl adenosine. Lipolysis was marginally stimulated by adenosine deaminase or 8-phenyltheophylline. 4. The data suggest that the mechanism of theophylline stimulation of lipolysis was only partially through antagonism of the adenosine receptor.",

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), arginine vasotocin (AVT), bovine parathyroid hormone fragment (bPTH-(1-34)) and oxytocin (OXY) produced dose-related positive chronotropic and inotropic responses; atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was negative chronotropic and inotropic; cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were without effects. 3. The dose-related responses under bPTH-(1-34) stimulation but not CGRP or AVT were attenuated in the presence of ANP (300 ng/ml, approximately 0.98 x 10(-7) M). As expected ANP decreased the basal AR and AT responses of the isolated atria and the inhibitory effects were dose-dependent. 4. As shown previously, propranolol blocked the atrial tension stimulated by bPTH (1-34) but did not alter the cardiac responses to CGRP and AVT. 5. In the presence of beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol 10(-7) M) or ANP (10(-7) M), the AR and AT changes under ISO stimulation in the frog were also decreased. 6. These cardiac changes suggest the cardiac inhibitory effects of ANP are related to beta-adrenoceptor activity and ANP might be a beta antagonist.",

PG-induced changes were similar to neuronal activity in rabbits LH after 24-hour food deprivation in 59%.

    "88": "Patients leaving the hospital after a myocardial infarction are given a prescription containing several drugs. The purpose of this paper is to determine which of these drugs have a proven value and for which types of patients. Antithrombotic agents (be it acetyl-salicylic acid or antivitamin K drugs) have been shown to be efficient after a myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers are certainly useful, notably in cases with severe necrosis. Conversely, the usefulness of calcium antagonists for secondary prevention has not been demonstrated and indeed, it seems probable that the drugs of this class might be harmful in patients who had severe infarction. There is little divergence concerning the necessity to control the risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis after a myocardial infarction. The evidence is strong concerning giving up smoking; it is intuitive as regards controlling arterial hypertension and more controversial as regards the need for lowering blood cholesterol levels. The systematic prescription of antiarrhythmic agents after myocardial is certainly noxious. Finally, prospects are now opened by the prevention of left ventricular remodelling under treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

The befunolol used contained no preservatives. Before and after treatment the number and shape of the endothelial cells of the five corneal sectors were evaluated. After 120 days of twice-daily application of befunolol or placebo, no changes in the shape or density of the corneal cells were found in any patient. No differences in the patients receiving befunolol or placebo were noted. The consensual ophthalmotonic reaction was studied in 15 of the patients before and after befunolol administration. A significant decrease in intraocular pressure was noted at 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after befunolol. Intraocular pressure also decreased significantly at 1 to 4 hours after placebo, and then returned to pretreatment levels at 6 hours.", 
    "90": "In the rabbit isolated thoracic aorta, WB 4101 and 5-methylurapidil dose-dependently shifted the concentration-response curves for norepinephrine to the right. Schild plots showed that the inhibition of responses for WB 4101 and 5-methylurapidil was biphasic, implying that norepinephrine acted through two receptor populations. Clonidine produced a concentration-dependent contraction in the isolated rabbit thoracic aorta. WB 4101 and 5-methylurapidil antagonized the contractions for clonidine, and the Schild plot to both antagonists against clonidine yielded a monophasic slope. Schild plots of the results obtained from the inhibition by WB 4101 and 5-methylurapidil for norepinephrine in strips pretreated with chloroethylclonidine yielded a straight line with a slope of unity. Specific binding of [3H]prazosin in the aortic membrane preparations was saturable. The Hill coefficient obtained from the inhibition curves for clonidine was significantly different from unity. Clonidine interacted with two binding sites labelled by [3H]prazosin, but the low affinity site was completely eliminated by pretreatment with 10 microM chloroethylclonidine. These results suggest that the subtype activated by norepinephrine is different from that activated by clonidine, and that norepinephrine-induced contraction through both alpha 1A- and alpha 1B-subtypes and clonidine through only the alpha 1A-subtype in the rabbit thoracic aorta.", 
    "91": "It has been previously reported that the adrenergic system is involved in the control of feeding behavior and LH release. In the present study, the role of the adrenergic receptors in the suppression of LH release during acute fasting are examined by injecting the alpha 1-antagonist (prazosin), alpha 2-antagonists (idazoxan, SKF 86466-A, piperoxan), or beta-antagonist (propranolol) into the third ventricle of unfasted and 48 h fasted ovariectomized estradiol-treated rats. Blood samples were collected every 6 min for 3 h and the drugs were administered after the first hour of the sampling period. Prazosin caused a significant suppression of LH release in the unfasted animals while idazoxan and propranolol had no significant effects. In contrast, all alpha 2-antagonists blocked the inhibitory effect of fasting on LH release and significantly reinstated the suppressed LH release while prazosin and propranolol had no significant effects. We conclude from these results that the suppression of LH release during acute fasting is mediated by alpha 2-adrenergic receptors but not alpha 1- or beta-adrenergic receptors.",

In this study, a dose-related antagonism of idazoxan-induced food intake by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)-propranolol (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.), which also blocks 5-HT1 (5-hydroxytryptamine1) receptors has been demonstrated. (+)-Propranolol (10, 20 mg/kg, i.p.) did not attenuate idazoxan-induced feeding. (-)-Propranolol (10 mg/kg, i.p.) but not the (+)-enantiomer (10 mg/kg, i.p.) also significantly inhibited the food intake, induced by the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.). Idazoxan-induced feeding was not altered by the selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists betaxolol (beta 1; 5 mg/kg, i.p.) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2; 5 mg/kg, i.p.) but was potentiated by the 5-HT receptor antagonist metergoline (5 mg/kg, i.p.). The anomalous findings with metergoline may reflect its action at different sub-types of 5-HT receptor. The water intake induced by idazoxan and the peripherally-active alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist L-659,066 was also blocked in a stereoselective manner by propranolol (10 mg/kg) but not significantly by either metergoline (5 mg/kg, i.p.), the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol (5 mg/kg, i.p.) nor by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (5 mg/kg, i.p.). These results suggest that the food intake induced by idazoxan (and perhaps mediated by non-adrenoceptor idazoxan binding sites) may involve the 5-HT system, although further studies, using antagonists acting selectively at the different sub-types of 5-HT receptor, are required to confirm this.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "105": "1. The functional antagonism that exists between muscarinic and beta-adrenoceptor function in guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle was investigated by assessing Gs and Gi regulated adenylyl cyclase activity in isolated membranes. 2. Membranes from guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle contain both Gi alpha and Gs alpha as assessed by Western blots with anti-G-protein antibodies. 3. GppNHp, a non-hydrolysable analogue of guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP), was shown to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity at high concentrations (10(-6)-10(-4) M). GppNHp also produced a concentration-dependent reduction in pertussis toxin-catalysed adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation of Gi alpha. 4. Pretreatment of tracheal smooth muscle slices with methacholine (10(-6) M) provoked a blockade of isoprenaline plus GTP, GppNHp- and GTP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase. 5. Addition of methacholine to membranes did not trigger inhibition of GTP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity but did block the isoprenaline-mediated augmentation of GTP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. 6. Pretreatment of tracheal smooth muscle with methacholine (10(-6) M) provoked a blockade of cholera toxin-catalysed NAD(+)-dependent ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha. 7. Phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-treatment of tracheal smooth muscle slices actually enhanced GppNHp-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in subsequently prepared membranes. 8. We suggest that methacholine in addition to inhibiting adenylyl cyclase via a Gi-dependent mechanism induces a functional inactivation of Gs activity.

Despite the fact that pharmacy claims are available and can be used for clinical evaluation, there has been no description of a practical surveillance or warning system to recognize and reduce the rate of beta-blocker use in people with asthma. This study used administrative claims data to estimate the prevalence of patients with asthma who also had prescriptions for beta-blockers. Chart audit was used to supplement our understanding of the causes of the problem and its consequences. In the calendar year 1989, in a large midwestern group practice that contracts with a single health maintenance organization (HMO), 3,170 HMO patients presumed to have asthma were identified. Of those 3,170 patients, 44 or 1.4% also had filled prescriptions for beta-blockers. The occurrence of beta-blocker use varied by age group: from less than 1% in patients below 30 years of age, rising to 8.9% in patients aged 60 to 69. Two of the patients with asthma who had prescriptions for beta-blockers were hospitalized for asthma in the study period. In 61% of the cases, different physicians managed the asthma care from those who prescribed the beta-blockers.

Finally, special considerations are expressed concerning patients who abuse illicit drugs such as cocaine.", 
    "126": "In SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma cells, the cAMP response to 10 nM isoproterenol (ISO) is mediated primarily by beta 1-adrenergic receptors. However, responses to higher concentrations of ISO (100-1000 nM) were only weakly blocked by beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists. When beta 1 receptors were blocked with 10 microM CGP 20712A, catecholamines still maximally activated cAMP accumulation, with only small decreases in potency. In the presence of CGP 20712A, beta blockers inhibited the response to ISO stereoselectively but with relatively low potencies. Pindolol derivatives were partial agonists with low potencies, and the atypical agonist BRL 37344 was a partial agonist with an intermediate potency. All binding sites in these cells labeled by 125I-cyanopindolol were of the beta 1 subtype. Nuclease protection assays indicated that SK-N-MC cells contain mRNA for both the human beta 1- and beta 3-adrenergic receptors, with the beta 3 subtype mRNA being expressed 25-50% more abundantly than that for the beta 1 subtype. Northern blot hybridizations showed the presence of two beta 3 mRNA transcripts of 3.1 and 2.4 kilobases. These results suggest that beta 1- and atypical beta-adrenergic receptors coexist in these cells and cause redundant increases in cAMP formation. Although molecular approaches suggest that the atypical subtype is the beta 3, the observed drug specificity differs from that reported for the expressed recombinant human beta 3 receptor.", 
    "127": "The contribution of adrenergic receptors to the cardiovascular responses to cocaine (5 mg/kg i.v.) were examined in conscious, free-moving rats instrumented for continuous measurement of arterial pressure, heart rate and blood flows in the mesentery and hindquarters or ascending aorta. Cocaine elicits an immediate (peak) and sustained pressor response with a concomitant reduction in heart rate. Prazosin (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) pretreatment significantly reduced both the peak and sustained pressor responses by attenuating the increases in systemic, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular resistances. Idazoxan pretreatment (1 mg/kg i.v.) attenuated the peak increase in hindquarters vascular resistance. Whereas propranolol pretreatment (1 mg/kg i.v.) attenuated the peak pressor response, the sustained pressor response was enhanced due to increased hindquarters and systemic vascular resistances. Metoprolol pretreatment (1 mg/kg i.v.) enhanced the sustained pressor response to cocaine, in part due to increased heart rate and mesenteric vascular resistances. Upon examination of the cardiac effects of cocaine, a sustained bradycardic response was observed, whereas stroke volume and cardiac output were relatively unaffected. The bradycardic response to cocaine was attenuated by yohimbine (0.1 mg/kg i.v.), prevented by prazosin and converted to a tachycardia after idazoxan (1 mg/kg) pretreatment. After propranolol pretreatment, cocaine substantially decreased cardiac output and stroke volume. Our results demonstrate that cocaine produces a biphasic pressor response in conscious rats and that the mechanisms underlying the dual responses vary in intensity and mode of action in different vascular beds, but are primarily dependent upon alpha-1 adrenergic receptor-mediated vasoconstriction.", 
    "128": "The stainless-steel cannula-inserting method was used to observe vascular effects of mixed and selective beta adrenoceptor agonists, isoproterenol, procaterol and denopamine, on isolated, perfused rabbit common carotid arteries. In phenylephrine-preconstricted preparations, the three beta agonists induced a dose-dependent vasodilation which was not suppressed by treatment with beta antagonists, atenolol, a selective beta-1 antagonist and ICI 118551, a selective beta-2 antagonist. On the other hand, in prostaglandin F2 alpha-preconstricted preparations, these agonists produced no vasodilation and revealed weak vasoconstrictions which were readily suppressed by bunazosin, a selective alpha-1 antagonist. Moreover, these agonists caused a shift of the dose-response curve for phenylephrine to the right in a parallel fashion in non-preconstricted preparations. The relative pA2 values for isoproterenol, procaterol and denopamine calculated from the displacement curve were 7.47, 7.59 and 8.17, respectively. Thus, it is concluded that 1) there are little functional beta adrenoceptors in the rabbit common carotid arteries, 2) beta adrenoceptor agonists have both antagonistic and agonistic properties for alpha-1 adrenoceptor activation, 3) denopamine possesses a higher potency as an alpha-1 antagonist and 4) beta agonists generally act as vasodilators in rabbit cerebral circulation.", 
    "129": "Determinants of total high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and HDL subfractions were assessed in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white persons (n = 932), aged 20-74 years, in the San Luis Valley, Colorado. Using multiple regression, BMI was negatively associated with HDL-C, HDL2-C, and HDL3-C in men and HDL-C and HDL3-C in women. Among females, current smokers had lower HDL-C and subfractions. Women on beta-blockers had lower HDL3-C levels. For both sexes, a positive association was observed between age and HDL-C and subfractions and physical activity with HDL-C and HDL3-C. Drinking alcohol (> or = 50 g/week) was associated with higher HDL-C and HDL3-C in both sexes and HDL2-C in women. The positive association of age and negative associations of the subscapular/triceps ratio and fasting insulin had consistent relationships with HDL-C, HDL2-C, and HDL3-C in men and women. Ethnicity was not significantly associated with HDL-C or subfractions after controlling for body fat distribution or fasting insulin.", 
    "130": "The estimated central blood volume (i.e., blood volume in the heart cavities, lungs and central arterial tree) was determined by multiplying cardiac output by circulatory mean transit time in 19 patients with cirrhosis and compared with sympathetic nervous activity and circulating level of atrial natriuretic factor. Arterial norepinephrine level, an index of overall sympathetic nervous activity (3.08 nmol/L in patients vs. 1.36 nmol/L in controls; p < 0.01) was negatively correlated (r = -0.54, p < 0.01) with estimated central blood volume (mean = 23 ml/kg in patients vs. 27 ml/kg in controls; p < 0.05). Similarly, renal venous norepinephrine level (an index of renal sympathetic tone; 4.26 nmol/L in patients vs. 1.78 nmol/L in controls; p < 0.01) was inversely correlated with estimated central blood volume (r = -0.53, n = 18, p < 0.02). No significant correlation could be established between arterial atrial natriuretic factor level (8.9 pmol/L in patients vs. 9.6 pmol/L in controls; not significant) and estimated central blood volume. Hemodynamic values were subsequently modified with oral propranolol (80 mg). During beta-adrenergic blockade, the mean estimated central blood volume was not altered significantly, except in six patients who exhibited decreases in mean arterial blood pressure (85 to 69 mm Hg; n = 6) and decreases in mean estimated central blood volume (23.2 to 20.6 ml/kg; n = 6, p < 0.05). Slight increases were observed in mean right atrial pressure (2.2 to 3.7 mm Hg; n = 14, p < 0.05); this change was positively correlated with the change in estimated central blood volume (r = 0.44, n = 14, p = 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "132": "Relations between QT and RR intervals were determined after measurement of QT values by Holter recording at heart rates of 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 beats per minute in 100 healthy young men. Fifteen men underwent a second recording during acute treatment with the beta-blocking agent atenolol. At heart rates between 80 and 120 beats per minute, the QT interval was significantly longer (from 9 to 16 msec), and at a heart rate of 50 beats per minute significantly shorter (26 msec), than values calculated from Bazett's formula. Sleep prolonged QT values by 18 msec at a heart rate of 60 beats per minute and by 21 msec at a heart rate of 50 beats per minute compared with the waking state. Atenolol lengthened QT intervals significantly (by 11-14 msec) at heart rates between 90 and 110 beats per minute and shortened them (by 12 msec) at a heart rate of 60 beats per minute. During sleep, QT intervals were the same before and after atenolol.",

    "134": "We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of esmolol, an ultra-short-acting, beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug, to control the sinus tachycardia and increase in arterial blood pressure induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Each of 20 patients, ASA physical status I-III, participated in a double-blind, randomized Latin-Square study involving two matched-pair trials (placebo versus esmolol given as a 500-micrograms/kg bolus followed by either 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 [high dose], 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 [medium dose], or 100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 [low dose] infusion of esmolol) during ECT. Each patient acted as his or her own control (total number of ECT procedures were 160). We administered a 1-min bolus of placebo (normal saline) or esmolol at the rate of 500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 followed by either high-, medium-, or low-dose esmolol or placebo for an additional 3 min. We then induced anesthesia with methohexital (1 mg/kg) and succinylcholine (0.5 mg/kg) IV. Ninety seconds after the administration of succinylcholine, the electrical stimulus was applied to induce seizure. The infusion of placebo or esmolol was discontinued 3 min after the electrical stimulus. Significant decreases were found in mean heart rate from minute 3 until minute 7 and in the maximum heart rate. The mean of each patient's maximum heart rate after seizure changed from 147 +/- 18 bpm in placebo patients to 112 +/- 20 bpm in high-dose esmolol patients; to 121 +/- 23 bpm in medium-dose esmolol patients; and to 124 +/- 20 bpm in low-dose esmolol patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "135": "To investigate the mechanisms of alpha 1-adrenergic vascular desensitization, osmotic minipumps containing either saline (n = 9) or amidephrine mesylate (AMD) (n = 9), a selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist, were implanted subcutaneously in dogs with chronically implanted arterial and right atrial pressure catheters and aortic flow probes. After chronic alpha 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation, significant physiological desensitization to acute AMD challenges was observed, i.e., pressor and vasoconstrictor responses to the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist were significantly depressed (p < 0.01) compared with responses in the same dogs studied in the conscious state before pump implantation. However, physiological desensitization to acute challenges of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) (0.1 micrograms/kg per minute) in the presence of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade was not observed for either mean arterial pressure (MAP) (30 +/- 7 versus 28 +/- 5 mm Hg) or total peripheral resistance (TPR) (29.8 +/- 4.9 versus 28.9 +/- 7.3 mm Hg/l per minute). In the presence of beta-adrenergic receptor plus ganglionic blockade after AMD pump implantation, physiological desensitization to NE was unmasked since the control responses to NE (0.1 micrograms/kg per minute) before the AMD pumps were now greater (p < 0.01) than after chronic AMD administration for both MAP (66 +/- 5 versus 32 +/- 2 mm Hg) and TPR (42.6 +/- 10.3 versus 23.9 +/- 4.4 mm Hg/l per minute). In the presence of beta-adrenergic receptor, ganglionic, plus NE-uptake blockade after AMD pump implantation, desensitization was even more apparent, since NE (0.1 micrograms/kg per minute) induced even greater differences in MAP (33 +/- 5 versus 109 +/- 6 mm Hg) and TPR (28.1 +/- 1.8 versus 111.8 +/- 14.7 mm Hg/l per minute). The maximal force of contraction induced by NE in the presence or absence of endothelium was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in vitro in mesenteric artery rings from AMD pump dogs compared with saline control dogs. Furthermore, alpha 1-adrenergic receptor density, as determined by [3H]prazosin binding in membrane preparations from vessels in the mesentery, was decreased (8.2 +/- 1.0 versus 18.4 +/- 1.4 fmol/mg protein, p < 0.001) without any change in Kd in the AMD pump dogs compared with the saline pump dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "136": "On examining about 300 patients with keratoconus in the period of 20 years the authors detected in a number of cases variations of the intraocular pressure. By means of a pneumo-tonometer Digilab 30R periodic variations of the IOP were measured in 76 patients and daily variations in 42. The statistical analysis showed that the application of Timolol and reduction of the IOP variations has a decisive influence on the improvement of objective changes and the visual acuity without correction. Presently in our Department Timolol is used successfully in 160 patients. There was no deterioration in either patient at that time and many patients showed an improvement of the condition of keratoconus."
