Diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease and hyperlipidemia were more prevalent in Indians compared to Malays or Chinese (all p<0.05). Indians and Malays had higher composite end-point rates compared to the Chinese (p=0.01). Although Indians and Malays had higher CHF readmission rates compared to the Chinese (p<0.01), a trend towards a higher all-cause mortality rate was seen in Malays (p=0.12). Malay race was an independent predictor of the composite end-point (OR=1.65, 95% CI=1.04-2.63, p=0.034), as were age, diabetes mellitus, ischemic cardiomyopathy, beta-blocker use, and NYHA class (all p<0.05).",

    "5": "The chiral resolution of three beta-blockers including propranolol, pindolol and oxprenolol, was studied by affinity electrokinetic chromatography. The effect of various chiral selectors and some key parameters including buffer pH, buffer concentration, capillary temperature and applied voltage were carefully studied, respectively. At optimum condition, based on the signal-to-noise ratio of 3, the detection limits for the simple resolution and chiral resolution were found to be 1.0x10(-5) and 4.0 x 10(-5)M, respectively. In addition, the interactions of these beta-blockers with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied and the binding constant (K(a)) between BSA and each of beta-blockers were calculated. Based on linear correlation coefficient, it can be concluded that the binding ratio of pindolol (oxprenolol) combining with BSA is 1:1, and that the binding number of propranolol interacting with BSA deviates one.", 
    "6": "A unique extraction procedure leading to the separation of 2 different pharmaceutical classes molecules has been developed and optimised by chemometric tools. From only one sampling, this analytical method allows the determination of 21 pharmaceuticals from corticosteroids and beta-blockers classes. Performing the SPE on Oasis MCX (mixed-mode cation exchange), the sequential elution of each pharmaceutical class is achievable, allowing a high purity level of extracts as well as high recovery rates. Performing a unique sample preparation results in an important save of time. The extracts were then analysed by LC/MS/MS, using a Hibar Purospher Star column for beta-blockers and an X-Bridge column for corticosteroids with formate buffer (pH 3.8)/AcN and water/AcN mobile phases, respectively. This work also includes a study of the chromatographic and mass spectrometric parameters in order to increase the analyte signal. The optimised SPE-LC/MS/MS method was then applied to environmental samples from sewage treatment plant (STP). beta-Blockers and corticosteroids were detected, respectively, in concentrations up to 318 ng L(-1) (sotalol) and 174 ng L(-1) (cortisone), in STP influents. Moreover, both pharmaceutical classes have also been detected in STP effluents. As far as we know, this is the first paper reporting the detection of corticosteroids in environmental waters. The developed analytical method can be used in further studies to investigate the environmental contamination by these drugs.",

A total of 164 patients were included in the tolerability analysis and 135 patients were evaluable for efficacy (nisoldipine CC, n = 69; diltiazem retard, n = 66). During bicycle exercise tolerance tests, time to 1mm ST-segment depression, total exercise time, and time to angina were assessed at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. The number of angina attacks and of consumed nitroglycerin tablets were recorded in weekly diaries. Time to onset of 1mm ST-segment depression increased by 69.4 +/- 100.0 seconds with nisoldipine CC and by 65.9 +/- 87.6 seconds with diltiazem retard. The two treatment regimens were equally effective in time to onset of 1mm ST-segment depression, time to angina pectoris, and in exercise duration. A beneficial effect on angina attacks and nitroglycerin consumption was achieved with both treatments. Patient compliance, as assessed by the number of returned tablets, was high, at over 80%. Six patients withdrew from the treatment because of adverse events. Mild and transient adverse events were reported by 24 patients during treatment. One patient experienced a severe circulatory shock on the combination of diltiazem retard and atenolol. Peripheral oedema and headache were more common on nisoldipine CC. We concluded that the two treatments were equally efficacious and tolerated in patients with stable angina pectoris.", 
    "22": "Coronary flow reserve (CFR) is the maximal increase in coronary blood flow (CBF) above its resting level for a given perfusion pressure when coronary vasculature is maximally dilated. Normally, hyperaemic CBF reaches values at least 2- to 3-fold greater than resting CBF. Reduction of CFR is mainly due to epicardial coronary artery stenosis or to coronary microvascular dysfunction. CFR can be determined by several techniques that measure CBF itself (e.g. positron emission tomography) or CBF velocities (Doppler methods) from which coronary flow velocity reserve is calculated. Hyperaemic coronary vasodilation can be obtained by pharmacological agents (e.g. adenosine and dipyridamole), but also by the cold pressure test. Long-term antihypertensive treatment induces significant improvement of CFR, which is parallel to the regression of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. First- and second-generation beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) have shown contradictory influences on CFR. This can be explained by the interaction of the effects on CBF at rest, generally reduced by these drugs, and after hyperaemia, when minimal coronary resistance appears to be either increased or reduced. Third-generation beta-blockers (e.g. carvedilol and nebivolol), which have vasodilating capacity, improve hyperaemic CBF. This occurs as a result of a reduction in minimal resistance, which can be attributed to alpha-adrenergic blockade and/or to a nitric oxide-mediated effect. This improvement is clearly beneficial in patients with coronary artery disease and indicates an improved coronary microvascular function. Changes of CFR due to vasodilating beta-blockers improve microvascular angina pectoris or silent ischaemia in patients without epicardial artery stenosis, and are also helpful in predicting the response or the further improvement of LV function to treatment.", 
    "23": "Unchecked mitogenic signals due to the overexpression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) is implicated in the promotion and progression of cancer. In addition, beta-adrenoceptor is involved in the control of cancer cell proliferation. This study sought to elucidate whether a functional connection exists between these two disparate receptor systems. EGF was used to stimulate HKESC-1 cells, an esophageal squamous cancer cell line, in which beta-adrenoceptor activity was monitored by measuring intracellular cAMP levels in the absence or presence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Results showed that EGF significantly increased cAMP levels and cell proliferation, both of which were attenuated by atenolol [(+)-4-[2-hydroxy-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]propoxy]benzeneacetamide] or ICI 118,551 [(+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol], which are antagonists for the beta-adrenoceptor. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that the cellular release of epinephrine and the expression of its synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase were induced by EGF. The expression of beta(1)-adrenoceptor and the downstream signal transducer protein kinase A were also up-regulated. In this connection, AG1478 [4-(3-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abrogated all these EGF-elicited alteration. Collectively, this study demonstrates that beta-adrenergic signaling could be up-regulated at multiple levels upon EGFR activation to mediate the mitogenic signals in esophageal cancer cells. This novel finding not only unveils the sinister liaison between EGFR and beta-adrenoceptors but also sheds new light on the purported therapeutic use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of esophageal cancer.", 
    "24": "The heart failure is one of the pathologies with major social and economic impact in the western world. The neurohormonal modulation is the only effective pharmacological approach. The increasing use of implantable devices apparently sets against the possibilities of implementing in the patient's treatment scheme. However, the anti-adrenergic therapy, once used at optimal dose, is highly effective on sudden death and on rates of implantable cardioverter defibrillators discharges. CIBIS-III proposes the beta-blocker use as primary approach, even prior to ACE inhibitors. This might be specifically true in the patient whit evidence of autonomic imbalance resulting in sympathetic hyperactivity. CIBIS-III shows that bisoprolol can be used in chronic heart failure patients also in absence of the concomitant enalapril therapy. Using bisoprolol as primary approach allows to reach optimal doses more effective on arrhythmic risk. CIBIS III results propose new strategies to the current international heart failure guidelines's recommendations.", 
    "25": "Congenital Long QT Syndrome (cLQTS) is an inherited disease in children and adolescents who have structurally normal hearts but present with sudden death in a high proportion of untreated patients. More than 300 mutations have been identified in 7 LQT genes. Diagnosis still depends on ECG, clinical presentations and family history. Molecular genetic testing is useful to unravel borderline family members of LQT probands, but it continues to be a research tool at present. Beta blockers remain the mainstay of treatment. ICDs are highly effective in reducing SCD for high risk patients. Gene based therapy is still preliminary. Considerable thought is needed to address and treat the asymptomatic LQT family members. The main cause of Acquired LQTS is inhibition of Ikr current, usually by drugs. Care must be taken to avoid further exposure to QT prolonging drugs or conditions. Physicians need to be aware of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions of various important drugs.", 
    "26": "The treatment of cardiac arrhythmias has undergone a sea change with the advent of catheter ablative procedures (radiofrequency ablation) and use of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The antiarrhythmic drugs at times are used to prevent device related arrhythmia rather than being used for primary treatment of arrhythmias. Antiarrhythmic drugs are grouped according to their drug action as proposed by Vaughan William or by their action on ion channels. Currently amiodarone is the most commonly used drug followed by sotalol, class II, class IV and other class III drugs. It is now well known that amiodarone has several non-cardiac toxic effects particularly on long term therapy. Efforts are on to develop newer drugs which have efficacy of amiodarone without complex pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Newer drugs like azimilide with class III action are also being developed.", 
    "27": "Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia is a defined set of tachycardias when structural or pathological cause has been ruled out for the same. This paper tries to define and classify these arrhythmias to organize a logical therapeutic approach to deal with them. 60-80% of the idiopathic tachycardias originate from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and in 10% from the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). Outflow tract tachycardias have either LBBB or RBBB morphology with early R wave transition in chest leads. Adenosine, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers is the common medical treatment. Radiofrequency ablation is however the treatment of choice. Verapamil sensitive left ventricular tachycardia (ILVT) and propranolol sensitive left ventricular tachycardia (IPVT) are the other two forms recognized. RF ablation seems ideal for long-term management of ILVT and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for IPVT. Inherited channelopathies include catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome where there is an inherited disorder in the ion-exchange channels of the cell-membrane leading to tachycardia. Prognosis in these is variable; CPVT, in particular, has a malignant course when untreated. RF ablation and placement of an ICD are important in the overall management of specific arrhythmia.", 
    "28": "Diabetes mellitus is well recognized as a potent and prevalent risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. However, there is also evidence of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis, termed diabetic cardiomyopathy. Changes in ventricular structure and left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction have all been noted even in patients with well-controlled diabetes and without overt macrovascular complications. Insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and increased free fatty acid metabolism promote coronary microvascular disease, sympathetic nervous system dysfunction, and ventricular remodeling, and may contribute to the altered cardiac phenotype seen in diabetes. In addition to standard therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers), diabetic patients with left ventricular dysfunction are likely to benefit from targeted therapies to reduce insulin resistance and modulate substrate use.",

Of patients on monotherapy, beta-blockers were prescribed most often (42.3%). Of all patients, 53.3% were treated with two or more agents as either fixed or non-fixed combinations. The non-fixed combination of a prostaglandin and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor was the most frequently prescribed dual therapy (19.2%). Non-fixed prostaglandin plus beta-blocker was used by 18.0% of dual therapy patients, whereas the available fixed combination was used by 10.5%. Non-compliance was identified as a cause of unsatisfactory IOP-lowering in 26.8% of all patients. This study is limited by its descriptive, non-interventional design.",

Propranolol was found to increase the power of low- and high-frequency components of the heart rate. In influencing the heart rate variability, propranolol has the central mode of action. It is suggested that the ability of propranolol to increase the power of the low and high frequency components of the heart rate is related to its enhancing effect on the central cardiac vagal control.",

    "38": "To determine the effects and underlying mechanisms of treatment with the beta-receptor blockers nebivolol and metoprolol on penile endothelial function in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-/- mice, wild-type (WT) and ApoE-/- mice were fed with a cholesterol-rich diet for 7 weeks. ApoE-/- mice were treated with nebivolol (10 mg/kg/day) or metoprolol (90 mg/kg/day). Endothelial function of aortic and corpora cavernosal tissue was assessed by pharmacological stimulation with carbachol (endothelium dependent) or glycerol trinitrate (endothelium independent) in organ bath experiments. Atherosclerotic lesion formation was evaluated with oil-red staining, and modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was determined with lipid peroxidation. Heart rate, but not blood pressure, was decreased in nebivolol- and metoprolol-treated ApoE-/- mice (p < 0.01) compared with controls and WT mice without significant intergroup differences. Atherosclerotic lesion formation in the aortic root was increased in ApoE-/- mice (p < 0.01) with a more significant improvement in nebivolol- (p < 0.01) compared with metoprolol-treated mice (p < 0.05). Endothelium-dependent relaxation of the corpora cavernosa was significantly impaired in ApoE-/- mice (p < 0.05), which improved in nebivolol- versus metoprolol-treated mice. Efficacy of endothelium-dependent relaxation was comparable in aortic and penile tissue. Quantification of ROS production via lipid peroxidation revealed a significant reduction of superoxide anion production in nebivolol-treated (p < 0.05) but not metoprolol-treated mice compared with ApoE-/- controls. Nebivolol improves penile endothelial function as a surrogate of erectile function in ApoE-/- mice. These effects may be related to a reduction of ROS production, which is independent of heart rate reduction, because metoprolol did not increase endothelial function.",

Methocel hypomellose K4M was used as a standard controlled release polymer for comparison purposes. In this study the effect of lactose on the release behaviour of propranolol hydrochloride from matrices formulated to contain the fenugreek mucilage also was investigated. An increase in concentration of the mucilage in matrices resulted in a reduction in the release rate of propranolol hydrochloride comparable to that observed with hypomellose matrices. The rate of release of propranolol hydrochloride from fenugreek mucilage matrices was mainly controlled by the drug:mucilage ratio. However, the mechanism of release from matrices containing drug:mucilage ratios of 1:1, 1:1.25, 1:1.5, and 1:2 remained the same. The kinetics of release, utilising the release exponent n, showed that the values of n were between 0.46-0.57 indicating that the release from fenugreek mucilage matrices was predominantly by diffusion. The presence of lactose in matrices containing mucilage increased the release rate of propranolol hydrochloride. This is due to a reduction in tortuoisity and increased pore size of channels caused by lactose through which propranolol diffuses and therefore diffusion of water into the tablet is facilitated.",

    "51": "A case series of 6 patients with persistent epithelial defects (1 with diabetes, 3 with penetrating keratoplasty, and 2 with herpes zoster) treated with preservative-free medications was reviewed over 18 months. Each patient subsequently developed deep calcareous corneal degeneration. Data regarding underlying etiology, diagnosis, clinical findings, and medications used were recorded. Each medication used was analyzed for phosphate levels by using a Roche 917 analyzer.", 
    "52": "All 6 cases of calcareous degeneration of the cornea had persistent epithelial defects, treated with preservative-free medications (timolol, dexamethasone, and prednisolone), in the presence of active inflammation on the ocular surface. The mean levels of phosphate were 130, 42.9, and 22.9 mM in timolol, dexamethasone, and prednisolone, respectively. All 6 patients had some degree of corneal opacification and reduced visual acuity.", 
    "53": "A contributory factor in our case series seems to be the use of preservative-free medications in persistent epithelial defects. The preservative-free medications we measured had high levels of phosphate, which may not be common knowledge.", 
    "54": "In the present study, nitric oxide (NO) was investigated to see if it mediated effects of nebivolol on apoptosis in the rat myocardial infarction (MI) model.", 
    "55": "Rats were divided into 3 groups: sham operated (sham-control), MI-induced (MI-control) and nebivolol treated (MI-nebivolol). The initial dose of nebivolol was administrated intravenously (iv) within 10 min of post-MI reperfusion and continued orally for 28 days. NO mediated effects of nebivolol were assessed either in the early (2(nd) day) or sub-acute (28(th) day) period of MI by histologic, hemodynamic and biologic studies. Left ventricular (LV) pressure changes were prevented with nebivolol (the increase in LV end-diastolic pressure and the decrease in maximum rise and fall rate of LV pressure (+dp/dt and -dp/dt) was significantly less in MI-nebivolol). Total and regional apoptotic indexes were significantly lower in the MI-nebivolol group (10.2 vs 7.1%, respectively on the 2(nd) day; p=0.004). Although plasma nitrite/nitrate, cyclic guanylate cyclase and peroxynitrite concentrations were high both in MI-control and MI-nebivolol groups on the 2(nd) day, these concentrations were decreased to the basal value on the 28(th) day in the MI-nebivolol group.", 
    "56": "As a result, nebivolol treatment (initially by iv within 10 min of reperfusion and continued orally) reduced the myocardial apoptosis after MI. This beneficial effect of nebivolol is mediated by NO regulation.", 
    "57": "Arrhythmias following cardiovascular surgery lead to unstable hemodynamics, along with myocardial ischemia and decreased cardiac output. The purpose of the present case cohort study compared the control group with no carvedilol administered and the other group of patients given carvedilol and determined whether postoperative treatment with carvedilol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, prevents paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).", 
    "58": "Of 160 patients who underwent scheduled isolated CABG, 80 received postoperative carvedilol and 80 did not. Postoperative paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was defined as episodes of atrial fibrillation persisting for over 10 min and confirmed by 12-lead electrocardiography. The incidence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was significantly lower in patients given carvedilol (12/80:15%) than in those who were not (27/80:34%) (p=0.0094). Logistic regression analysis showed that only postoperative carvedilol was significantly associated with the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation (95% confidence interval, 0.169-0.832; p=0.0159).",

    "60": "Vascular senescence is closely associated with age-related vascular disorders and is enhanced by angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor stimulation. However, the role of Ang II type 2 receptor activation in vascular senescence is still an enigma. Ang II stimulation significantly increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and the level of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, with enhancement of oxidative stress and expression of Ki-ras2A, p53, and p21 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from wild-type (Agtr2(+)) mice, whereas these effects of Ang II were enhanced in VSMCs from Ang II type 2 receptor null (Agtr2(-)) mice. Administration of an Ang II type 1 receptor blocker, valsartan, attenuated these parameters, with less effect in Agtr2(-) VSMCs. Ang II stimulation increased methyl methanesulfonate sensitive 2 (MMS2) expression in Agtr2(+) VSMCs but not in Agtr2(-) VSMCs. MMS2 small-interfering RNA treatment enhanced Ang II-induced senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine level with no significant changes in oxidative stress markers and the expression of Ki-ras2A, p53, and p21. Moreover, exposure of Agtr2(+) VSMCs to hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation induced marked increases in senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine level, which were further enhanced in Agtr2(-) and MMS2 small-interfering RNA-treated Agtr2(+) VSMCs. Agtr2(+) mice exposed to x-ray irradiation showed increases in senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine level in the aorta, which were further exaggerated in the aorta of Agtr2(-) mice with a lower MMS2 level. These findings suggest that Ang II type 2 receptor signaling attenuates DNA damage and consequent vascular senescence at least in part through MMS2 transactivation and propose the beneficial effects of Ang II type 2 receptor stimulation with Ang II type 1 receptor blockers in age-related vascular disorders.",

Their BNP levels (pg/mL) were measured and cardiopulmonary exercise testing was carried out to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 slope). Patients were followed up for 2.7 (0.8) years. The study endpoints were cardiovascular death, heart transplantation, and HF hospitalization.",

In the very elderly type A aortic dissection frequently presents with non-specific symptoms and signs and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Thus the clinician must have a high index of clinical suspicion in order to prompt the most appropriate diagnostic-therapeutic strategy. We report a nonagenarian women with TA-AAD, treated successfully with medical therapy.", 
    "66": "The optimal blood pressure (BP) for treating acute intracerebral hemorrhage remains (ICH) uncertain.

MAP was managed during the 48 h treatment period. NIHSS was obtained at baseline, 24, and 48 h. Brain CT was done 24 h after symptoms. A modified Rankin Scale (mRs) was obtained at 90 days. A clinical decline (NIHSS drop > or = 2 points) within the first 48 h was the primary endpoint. Hematoma enlargement at 24 h was a secondary endpoint.", 
    "68": "We enrolled 21 patients into each group. Mean age was 60.6 +/- 12.3 years and MAP on presentation was 147.6 +/- 18.2 mmHg. Treatment was started on average 3.2 +/- 2.2 h after symptom onset. Baseline clinical variables were identical between the 2 treatment groups. Target blood pressure was achieved within 87.1 +/- 59.6 min in the standard group and 163.5 +/- 163.8 min in the aggressive BP treatment group. There were no significant differences in early neurological deterioration, hematoma and edema growth, and clinical outcome at 90 days.",

Lowering BP aggressively did not affect hematoma and edema expansion but this possibility deserves further study.", 
    "70": "Human-based in vitro hepatic experimental systems are now used routinely in drug development. The rationale for the use of human-based in vitro systems is based on the known species-species differences in drug properties. Human-specific drug properties, by definition, cannot be defined using nonhuman experimental animals, and therefore can only be assessed in the preclinical phase of drug development using in vitro human-based approaches. A widely applied human-based in vitro experimental system for preclinical evaluation of drug properties is human hepatocytes. Our laboratory was one of the first to successfully isolate highly viable and functional hepatocytes from human livers, and we recently developed cryopreservation procedures to retain high viability and high attachment efficiency of the isolated hepatocytes. Successful cryopreservation of human hepatocytes greatly enhances the utility of this valuable in vitro experimental system, allowing storage, transport, convenient scheduling of experimentation and repeat experimentation using hepatocytes isolated from the same donors. Effective assays have been developed with cryopreserved human hepatocytes using multiwell plates for the evaluation of critical drug properties, including metabolic stability, drug-drug interaction potential, and drug toxicity. Human hepatocytes represent an alternative experimental system that plays a significant role in the 3Rs - the reduction, refinement, and replacement of the use of animals in preclinical drug development research.", 
    "71": "The impact of guideline adherence on clinical outcomes in the management of chronic heart failure (CHF) has never been evaluated in Japan. We investigated outcomes in 92 consecutive CHF patients admitted to Kitasato University Hospital in 2004-2006 for HF exacerbation with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% by the use of class I drugs for pump-failure, as recommended in the Japanese Circulation Society guideline. Drugs, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), beta-blockers (BB), spironolactone, diuretics, and cardiac glycosides were administered to 64.1%, 59.8%, 28.2%, 96.7%, and 68.0% of patients, respectively. Patients for whom adherence to the prescription of ACEI and BB as first-line agents was high had significantly and independently better prognostic outcomes for cardiac events (P = 0.0036) as well as subsequent improvements in clinical surrogate markers for HF status such as NYHA class and BNP. Addition of the 3 latter drugs to the prescription of ACEI and BB did not affect the superiority of ACE plus BB in improving the long-term prognosis. We have demonstrated that adherence to treatment guidelines for CHF is a significant predictor of subsequent cardiac events in actual practice in Japan. An effective means of improving adherence to current guideline standards of care for CHF has yet to be established.", 
    "72": "Alcohol-induced endothelial changes might contribute to an increase in blood pressure in regular alcohol consumers. Some antihypertensive drugs affect oxidative stress and endothelial function and might counteract the effects of alcohol at the cellular level. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the effects of three different types of antihypertensive agents on alcohol-induced endothelial responses and oxidative stress. Cultured human endothelial cells were exposed to increasing concentrations (1, 10, 60 micromol/L) of zofenoprilat, carvedilol, and lacidipine in the absence and in the presence of ethanol (140 mmol/L). Concentrations of endothelin (ET) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured in the culture media as markers of endothelial function, and malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular glutathione (GSHi) were measured as markers of oxidative stress. Exposure to alcohol increased the levels of ET, NO, and MDA, and decreased GSHi. Carvedilol and zofenoprilat were more effective than lacidipine in counteracting the effects of alcohol on ET production. Alcohol-induced NO production was enhanced by carvedilol, whereas zofenoprilat and lacidipine did not have a significant effect. The alcohol-induced increase in MDA concentrations was blunted by all three drugs, but only carvedilol restored a normal response. All three drugs increased GSHi levels, with the effect being greater for carvedilol and lacidipine than zofenoprilat. Carvedilol is more effective than zofenoprilat and lacidipine in counteracting alcohol-induced endothelial responses in vitro and in decreasing oxidative stress. These effects might be particularly beneficial in patients with alcohol-related hypertension.", 
    "73": "Candesartan has been reported to produce nitric oxide (NO) and to decrease oxidative stress in animal studies. We investigated candesartan's effect on the production of NO and oxidative stress as well as on carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in hypertensive patients. One-hundred age-matched hypertensive patients were enrolled into an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) group (n=50) or a non-ARB group (n=50). The ARB group was treated with candesartan 8 mg and, when needed, Ca channel blockers, angiotesin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and/or beta-blockers. The non-ARB group was treated with drugs other than ARB. Carotid IMT was assessed by echocardiography before and 12 and 24 months after treatment. The urine levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an indicator of oxidative stress, and the serum levels of NOx, an indicator of NO, were measured. Blood pressure decreased to below 140/90 mmHg to the same extent in both groups. Carotid IMT decreased significantly in the ARB group, but not in the non-ARB group, at 12 and 24 months after treatment. The urine levels of 8-OHdG decreased significantly at 6 and 12 months after treatment in the ARB group but did not decrease in the non-ARB group. The serum levels of NOx increased significantly at 6 and 12 months after treatment in the ARB group but not in the non-ARB group. In conclusion, candesartan decreases carotid IMT by enhancing NO production and decreasing oxidative stress in patients with hypertension.",

Sample set B contained 50 mL of metoprolol 0.5 mg/mL diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection, and sample set C contained 50 mL of metoprolol 0.5 mg/mL diluted with 5% dextrose. All samples were prepared in triplicate and stored at room temperature. The stability of the samples was analyzed in duplicate using stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography immediately after preparation and at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 hours. The samples were assessed for pH and inspected for color and visible precipitation changes. The stability of metoprolol was determined by evaluating the percentage of the initial concentration remaining at each time interval. Stability of the product was defined as retention of 90% of the initial concentration.",

    "78": "We hypothesized that the 2 cardiovascular drugs aspirin and propranolol attenuate the prothrombotic response to acute psychosocial stress relative to placebo medication. We randomized 56 healthy subjects, double-blind, to 5-day treatment with an oral dose of either 100 mg of aspirin plus 80 mg of propranolol combined, single aspirin, single propranolol, or placebo medication. Thereafter, subjects underwent a 13-minute psychosocial stressor. Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag), fibrinogen, coagulation factor VII (FVII:C) and XII (FXII:C) activity, and D-dimer were determined in blood samples collected immediately pre- and post-stress and 45 minutes post-stress. The stress-induced changes in prothrombotic measures were adjusted for gender, age, body mass index, mean arterial blood pressure, smoking status, and sleep quality. There was an increase in VWF:Ag levels from immediately pre-stress to 45 minutes post-stress in the placebo group relative to the 3 subject groups with verum medication (P's </= 0.019; relative increase in VWF:Ag between 17% and 21%); however, the VWF:Ag response to stress was not significantly different between the three groups with verum medication. The stress responses in fibrinogen, FVII:C, FXII:C, and D-dimer were similar in all 4 medication groups. The combination of aspirin with propranolol, single aspirin, and single propranolol all attenuated the acute response in plasma VWF:Ag levels to psychosocial stress. This suggests that these cardiovascular drugs might exert limited protection from the development of stress-triggered coronary thrombosis.", 
    "79": "The aim of this study was to compare the effect of valsartan/amlodipine and atenolol/amlodipine combination in preventing the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in hypertensive diabetic patients with a history of recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Two hundred ninety-six hypertensive patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes in sinus rhythm but with at least 2 ECG-documented episodes of AF in the previous 6 months were randomized to 160 mg of valsartan plus amlodipine (titrated from 2.5 to 10 mg) or to 100 mg of atenolol plus amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg) in addition to their previous antiarrhythmic treatment (if any) and were followed up for 1 year. Blood pressure (BP) and a 24-hour ECG were evaluated monthly. The patients were asked to report any episode of symptomatic AF and to perform an ECG as early as possible. SBP/DBP values were significantly reduced after 12 months with valsartan/amlodipine (from 150.4/93.5 to 126.37/7.4 mm Hg, P < 0.001) and atenolol/amlodipine (from 151.1/94.2 to 127.1/77.9 mm Hg, P < 0.001), with no difference between the 2 regimens. At least 1 ECG-documented episode of AF was reported in 20.3% of the patients treated with valsartan/amlodipine and in 34.1% of those treated with atenolol/amlodipine, with a significant difference between treatments (P < 0.01). The positive effect of valsartan/amlodipine combination on AF recurrence was more evident in patients treated with amiodarone or propafenone than in patients treated with other antiarrhythmic drugs or without antiarrhythmic treatment. Despite similar BP reduction, valsartan/amlodipine combination was more effective in patients treated with amiodarone or propafenone than atenolol/amlodipine in preventing new episodes of AF in hypertensive diabetic patients.", 
    "80": "Although acute myocardial infarction (MI) and acute ischemic stroke share similarities, physicians need to recognize important differences in pathophysiology and how these differences affect acute treatment and prevention to provide optimal patient care. Potential causes of acute ischemic stroke are substantially more heterogeneous than for acute MI, and available acute therapies are substantially more limited. In acute ischemic stroke patients, diagnostic evaluation is paramount in determining eligibility for treatment with the only approved therapy, which must be administered within 3 hours after stroke onset. For patients having acute MI, reperfusion therapy by percutaneous intervention or thrombolytic drug therapy is well established. Because atherosclerosis is a common pathway to acute MI and acute ischemic stroke, modifying associated known risk factors is required for primary and secondary prevention of both conditions. Pharmacologic therapies recommended for secondary prevention include beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for MI, oral anticoagulants for stroke, and statins and antiplatelet agents for both conditions. Aspirin is recommended for preventing recurrence of both MI and stroke; agents inhibiting the adenosine diphosphate pathway of platelet activation, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel, are also beneficial. Recent studies suggest the benefits associated with adding aspirin to clopidogrel do not outweigh the significant increase in bleeding risk. The synergistic effects of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole make this combination twice as effective than aspirin alone in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. An ongoing study is directly comparing the combination of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole with clopidogrel for the prevention of recurrent stroke.", 
    "81": "We reported that left ventricular (LV) dilatation after 4 weeks of isolated mitral regurgitation (MR) in the dogs is marked by extracellular matrix loss and an increase in adrenergic drive. Given that extracellular matrix proteins and their receptor integrins influence beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) responses in vitro, we tested whether beta1-AR activation modulates focal adhesion (FA) signaling and LV remodeling in these same dogs with isolated MR. Normal dogs were compared with dogs with MR of a 4-week duration and with MR dogs treated with beta(1)-AR blockade (beta(1)-RB) (extended-release metoprolol succinate, 100 mg QD) that was started 24 hours after MR induction. In MR LVs, a decrease in collagen accumulation compared with normal dogs was associated with a decrease in FA kinase tyrosine phosphorylation, along with FA kinase interaction with adapter and cytoskeletal proteins, p130(Cas) and paxillin, respectively, as determined by immunoprecipitation assays. There was increased phosphorylation of stress related molecules p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Hsp27 and survival signaling kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT, with no evidence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. beta(1)-RB attenuated FA signaling loss and prevented p38 MAPK, Hsp27, and AKT phosphorylation induced by MR and significantly increased LV epicardial collagen content. However, beta(1)-RB did not improve LV endocardial collagen loss or LV dilatation induced by MR. Isolated myocytes from normal and MR dog hearts treated with beta(1)- or beta(2)-AR agonists demonstrated no difference in FA kinase, p38 MAPK, Hsp27, or AKT phosphorylation. These results showed that chronic stimulation of beta(1)-AR during early compensated MR impairs FA signaling that may affect myocyte/fibroblast-extracellular matrix scaffolding necessary for LV remodeling.",

Recently described Takotsubo syndrome is characterized by acute reversible left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning in the absence of coronary artery disease, and with chest pain and electrocardiographic changes mimicking acute anterior myocardial infarction, but with minimal release of myocardial enzymes. We describe Takotsubo syndrome that developed after elective mitral valve replacement and tricuspid annuloplasty in a 62-year-old woman. On supportive therapy with vasopressors, left ventricular function gradually improved with an ejection fraction returning to 50%. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be considered as a possible complication of the cardiac surgery.",

On day 5, IOPs were measured in the same mice once every 4 min for 32 min. On 2 separate days, mice were administered ketamine/xylazine or 2,2,2-tribromoethanol anesthesia, in a crossover design, and IOPs were measured once every 2 min for 32 min.

The authors tested the performance of E-Scribe Warehouse algorithms by quantifying electrocardiogram acquisition quality, adherence to QT annotation protocol, and T-wave signal strength in 2 data sets: \"reference\" (104 digital electrocardiograms from a phase I study with sotalol in 26 healthy subjects with QT annotations by computer-assisted manual adjustment) and \"test\" (the same electrocardiograms with an intentionally introduced predefined number of quality issues). The E-Scribe Warehouse correctly detected differences between the 2 sets expected from the number and pattern of errors in the \"test\" set (except for 1 subject with QT misannotated in different leads of serial electrocardiograms) and confirmed the absence of differences where none was expected. E-Scribe Warehouse scores below the threshold value identified individual electrocardiograms with questionable T-wave signal strength.

    "92": "Small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SK) channels play an important role in regulating the frequency and in shaping urinary bladder smooth muscle (UBSM) action potentials, thereby modulating contractility. Here we investigated a role for the SK2 member of the SK family (SK1-3) utilizing: 1) mice expressing beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) under the direction of the SK2 promoter (SK2 beta-gal mice) to localize SK2 expression and 2) mice lacking SK2 gene expression (SK2(-/-) mice) to assess SK2 function. In SK2 beta-gal mice, UBSM staining was observed, but staining was undetected in the urothelium. Consistent with this, urothelial SK2 mRNA was determined to be 4% of that in UBSM. Spontaneous phasic contractions in wild-type (SK2(+/+)) UBSM strips were potentiated (259% of control) by the selective SK channel blocker apamin (EC(50) = 0.16 nM), whereas phasic contractions of SK2(-/-) strips were unaffected. Nerve-mediated contractions of SK2(+/+) UBSM strips were also increased by apamin, an effect absent in SK2(-/-) strips. Apamin increased the sensitivity of SK2(+/+) UBSM strips to electrical field stimulation, since pretreatment with apamin decreased the frequency required to reach a 50% maximal contraction (vehicle, 21 +/- 4 Hz, n = 6; apamin, 12 +/- 2 Hz, n = 7; P < 0.05). In contrast, the sensitivity of SK2(-/-) UBSM strips was unaffected by apamin. Here we provide novel insight into the molecular basis of SK channels in the urinary bladder, demonstrating that the SK2 gene is expressed in the bladder and that it is essential for the ability of SK channels to regulate UBSM contractility.", 
    "93": "The antihypertensive action of a crude ethanolic extract (EEEG) from leaves of Echinodorus grandiflorus (Alismataceae) was investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The intraperitoneal injection of increasing doses of EEEG (300-1000 mg/kg) elicited dose-dependent reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) that were paralleled by reductions of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, reaching the maximum of 23 +/- 5%, 13 +/- 3% and 18 +/- 4%, respectively (n = 5, P < 0.05). Comparable reductions of MAP were obtained upon i.v. administration of EEEG (3-100 mg/kg), reaching the maximum decrease of 51 +/- 6% (n = 7; P < 0.001). The blockade of nitric oxide synthesis significantly reduced the hypotension induced by i.v. administration of EEEG. Moreover, the pre-treatment of the animals with a selective antagonist of cholinergic muscarinic receptors or of platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptors partially blunted the cardiovascular effects of EEEG. The i.v. pre-treatment with the selective B(2) bradykinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 or with indomethacin, an inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, did not prevent the hypotensive effects induced by EEEG. Finally, the chronic oral treatment with EEEG presented a significant antihypertensive effect that was comparable to that of reference antihypertensive drugs currently used to treat arterial hypertension. It is concluded that EEEG elicits significant acute antihypertensive effects through the release of nitric oxide and the stimulation of cholinergic muscarinic and PAF receptors. Moreover, our results suggest that EEEG may be appropriate to chronic oral treatment of arterial hypertension.", 
    "94": "Beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors (AR) play a pivotal role in regulation of the cardiovascular system. Both beta-AR subtypes are polymorphic. There are two major single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the beta(1)-AR gene: the Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly beta(1)-AR polymorphisms. In vitro, in recombinant cell systems Gly49 beta(1)-AR is much more susceptible to agonist-promoted downregulation than Ser49 beta(1)-AR, while Arg389 beta(1)-AR is three to four times more responsive to agonist-evoked stimulation than Gly389 beta(1)-AR. There are three major SNPs in the beta(2)-AR gene: the Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu and Thr164Ile beta(2)-AR polymorphisms (occur in humans only in the heterozygous form). In recombinant cell systems Gly16 beta(2)-AR is much more susceptible to agonist-promoted downregulation while Glu27 beta(2)-AR is rather resistant to agonist-induced downregulation but only in combination with Arg16, that occurs naturally extremely rare. Thr164 beta(2)-AR is three to four times more responsive to agonist-evoked stimulation than Ile164 beta(2)-AR. This review summarizes results from various studies on the possible relationship of these polymorphisms to cardiovascular diseases. At present it appears to be clear that, for cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure, beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR polymorphisms do not play a role as disease-causing genes; however, they might affect drug responses. Thus, it might be possible, by assessing the beta(1)-AR genotype, to predict responsiveness to beta(1)-AR agonist and -blocker treatment: patients homozygous for the Arg389 beta(1)-AR polymorphism should be good responders while patients homozygous for the Gly389 beta(1)-AR polymorphism should be poor responders or non-responders. Furthermore, subjects heterozygous for the Thr164Ile beta(2)-AR polymorphism exhibit blunted responses to beta(2)-AR stimulation. Finally, the Arg16Gln27 beta(2)-AR haplotype appears to be - at least in human vascular and bronchial smooth muscles - rather susceptible to agonist-induced desensitization (in contrast to the recombinant cell system findings), and might have some predictive value for poor outcome of heart failure. However, future large prospective studies have to replicate these findings in order to substantiate their clinical relevance.", 
    "95": "Many pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites are currently found in surface and ground waters which indicates their ineffective removal by conventional water treatment technologies. Advanced oxidation/reduction processes (AO/ RPs) are alternatives to traditional water treatment, which utilize free radical reactions to directly degrade chemical contaminants. This study reports the absolute rate constants for reaction of three beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol) with the two major AO/RP radicals; the hydroxyl radical (*OH) and hydrated electron ((e-)aq). The bimolecular reaction rate constants for *OH are (7.05 +/- 0.27) x 10(9), (8.39 +/- 0.06) x 10(9), and (1.07 +/- 0.02) x 10(10), and for (e-)aq they are (5.91 +/- 0.21) x 10(8), (1.73 +/- 0.03) x 10(8), and (1.26 +/- 0.02) x 10(10), respectively. Transient spectra were observed for the intermediate radicals produced by hydroxyl radical reactions. In addition, preliminary degradation mechanisms and major products were elucidated using 60Co gamma-irradiation and LC-MS. These data are required for both evaluating the potential use of AO/RPs for the destruction of these compounds and for studies of their fate and transport in surface waters where radical chemistry may be important in assessing their lifetime.", 
    "96": "Although sleep disordered breathing is thought to be common in patients with systolic heart failure, prior studies are difficult to interpret due to a variety of factors including small sample sizes, referral bias to sleep laboratories among participants, lack of modern medical therapy for congestive heart failure, and the failure to use modern techniques to assess breathing such as nasal pressure. Our objective was to determine the current prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in a state-of-the-art congestive heart failure clinic.", 
    "97": "We conducted a prospective study of consecutive patients who visited our heart failure clinic to assess the prevalence of sleep apnea in all eligible patients on maximal medical therapy. We used 4-channel recording equipment and modified Chicago criteria for scoring respiratory events (using heart rate response as a surrogate for arousal from sleep).", 
    "98": "We observed that among the 108 participants, 61% had some form of sleep disordered breathing (31% central apnea with Cheyne Stokes respiration and 30% obstructive sleep apnea). Sleep disordered breathing was significantly associated with atrial fibrillation (OR = 11.56, p = 0.02) and worse functional heart failure class (OR = 2.77, p = 0.02), after adjusting for male sex, age over 60 years, body mass index, and left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "99": "We conclude that both obstructive and central sleep apnea remain common in congestive heart failure patients despite advances in medical therapy, and that the previously reported high prevalence values are unlikely to be explained by referral bias or participation bias in prior studies. These data have important clinical implications for practitioners providing CHE therapy.",

    "101": "Thirty-five cirrhotics with variceal bleeding randomly received propranolol (n = 17: Group A) or spironolactone plus propranolol (n = 18: Group B). Hemodynamic assessment was performed at baseline and on the eighth day.", 
    "102": "Spironolactone with propranolol caused a greater reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient than propranolol alone (26.94% vs 10.2%; P < 0.01). Fourteen out of eighteen patients on the combination treatment had a reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient to <= 12 mmHg or a 20% reduction from baseline in contrast to only six out of seventeen (6/17) on propranolol alone (P < 0.05).", 
    "103": "Spironolactone with propranolol results in a better response with a greater reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient in the secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. A greater number of patients may be protected by this combination therapy than by propranolol alone. Hence, this combination may be recommended for secondary prophylaxis in patients with variceal bleeding.", 
    "104": "The present study was undertaken to characterize myocardial lesions in the rat induced by low doses of isoproterenol (Iso) and to correlate lesion severity with release of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and changes in myocyte iNOS expression. Two types of cardiac injury patterns were observed. A Type I response, noted 3 or 6 hours postdosing with 8, 16, 32, or 64 mug/kg Iso, included potential reversible myocardial alterations associated with slight increases in serum cTnT (< 0.3 ng/mL) and a slight reduction in myocyte cTnT immunoreactivity. The second type of response noted 3, 6, 12, 24 or 48 hours postdosing with 125, 250, or 500 mug/kg Iso consisted of irreversible myocyte alterations, together with significant increases in serum cTnT (3-14 ng/mL) and a marked reduction of cTnT immunoreactivity. By 48 hours the hearts of rats dosed with 125-500 mug/kg Iso had developed interstitial fibrosis, and serum cTnT had declined to near control levels (0.06-0.18 ng/mL). Increases in iNOS immunoreactivity correlated with the lesion severity. These findings suggest that low doses of Iso exert complex effects on the myocardium and that the generation of NO through increased expression of iNOS could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of myocyte injury.", 
    "105": "Recent meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of perioperative beta-blockade trials have failed to show a reduction in postoperative morbidity and mortality. Tight control of heart rate (HR) has been suggested to improve these outcomes. Meta-analyses have not considered the influence of tight HR control on the efficacy of perioperative beta-blockade.", 
    "106": "Using previously published search strategies, we identified all randomized trials evaluating perioperative beta-blockers after noncardiac surgery. This search yielded 10 trials with 2176 patients. We used the data from these studies to correlate measures of HR control with major postoperative outcomes, primarily in-hospital myocardial infarction (MI). Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, and metaregression was performed correlating measures of HR control with MI.", 
    "107": "The combined results of all studies did not show a significant cardioprotective effect of beta-blockers, with considerable heterogeneity among the studies (OR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.4-1.4; P = 0.38 heterogeneity: I(2) = 34%). However, grouping the trials on the basis of maximal HR showed that trials where the estimated maximal HR was <100 bpm were associated with cardioprotection (OR = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.08-0.65; P = 0.005) whereas trials where the estimated maximal HR was >100 bpm did not demonstrate cardioprotection (OR = 1.17; 95% CI = 0.79-1.80; P = 0.43) with no heterogeneity. Moreover, metaregression of the HR response to beta-blockade against the log OR of postoperative MI demonstrated a linear association between the effect of beta-blockade on the mean, maximal, and variation in HR and the OR of an MI (r(2) = 0.63; P < 0.001) where a larger effect of beta-blockers on HR was associated with a decreased incidence of postoperative MI. Across all studies, beta-blockade resulted in a reduction in postoperative HR (weighted mean difference: 8.6 bpm; 95% CI = -9.6 to -7.6; I(2) = 85.3%) with considerable heterogeneity. This large heterogeneity in HR response to beta-blockade was found to be related, in part, to the type of beta-blocker, specifically, metoprolol, and the concomitant use of calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blocker use and beta-blockers other than metoprolol resulted in more effective control of HR. There was wide variability in the HR response to beta-blockade. Twenty-five percent of patients receiving beta-blockers had episodes when the HRs were more than 100 bpm, although 15% of placebo patients also had bradycardia, which would have required a dose reduction had they been administered beta-blockers. Finally, this analysis found that perioperative beta-blockade was associated with an increased incidence of bradycardia (OR = 3.49; 95% CI = 2.4-5.9) and congestive heart failure (OR = 1.68; 95% CI = 1.00-2.8).", 
    "108": "The trials that achieve the most effective control of HR are associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative MI, suggesting that effective control of HR is important for achieving cardioprotection. Second, this analysis demonstrates that administration of beta-blockers does not reliably decrease HRs in all patients, and may be associated with increased side effects. Judicious use of combination therapy with other drugs may be necessary to achieve effective postoperative control of HR.", 
    "109": "The co-administration of lidocaine and propranolol leads to significant drug-drug interactions. Beta-blockers decrease liver perfusion and inhibit the activity of hepatic microsomal lidocaine metabolizing enzymes of the P450_2D subfamily. Hence, there is a resulting reduction in the hepatic breakdown of lidocaine and an increase in its serum concentrations. In this study the ability of propranolol to displace lidocaine from its binding sites in liver tissue has been examined through an in vitro model. Rat liver slices were incubated together with propranolol and/or lidocaine in human serum and the percentage of the bound fraction of lidocaine in the experimental mixture was assessed. The present results indicate that propranolol significantly decreases the binding process of lidocaine in liver tissue. This effect develops only when blood is used as incubation medium and the incubation period lasts 60 min. In conclusion, propranolol can displace lidocaine from liver proteins and therefore the co-administration of the two drugs may increase the free fraction of lidocaine excreted by the liver. However, this result arises from an in virro model and thus further investigation is needed.", 
    "110": "Glaucoma is a long-term ocular neuropathy defined by optic disc or retinal nerve fiber structural abnormalities and visual field abnormality. Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. Currently available treatments, initiated in a stepwise process, focus on intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, and initially include topical drug therapy (single then multidrug combinations), followed by laser then surgical treatment. Topical prostaglandin analogues or beta-adrenergic receptor blockers are first used, followed by alpha-agonists or topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and infrequently, cholinergic agonists and oral therapy. Limitations to existing topical IOP-reducing medications include continued disease progression in glaucoma patients with normal IOP, treatment failure, and low rates of compliance and persistence. Therapeutic agents under investigation include neuroprotectants, which target the disease process manifested by death of retinal ganglion cells, axonal loss, and irreversible loss of vision. Neuroprotectants may be used alone or in combination with IOPreducing therapy (a treatment strategy called complete therapy). Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blocker currently approved for dementia, is the neuroprotectant farthest along in the process seeking regulatory approval for glaucoma treatment and has a favorable safety profile because of its selective mechanism of action. Several other neuroprotectants are in early stage investigation. Complete therapy provides hope for improved outcomes by reducing the significant morbidity and economic consequences that occur as a result of neurodegeneration and disease progression.", 
    "111": "This study investigates whether the interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers and the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism or angiotensin receptor II type 1 (AGTR1) 573C/T polymorphism modifies the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. In total, 4097 subjects with hypertension were included in this study. The drug-gene interaction on the risk of MI or stroke was determined with a Cox proportional hazard model. The risk of MI was reduced in current users of ACE inhibitors with the AGTR1 573CT or CC genotype compared to ACE inhibitors with the AGTR1 573TT genotype (synergy index (SI):0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14-0.70). No significant drug-gene interaction was found on the risk of stroke (SI:0.82; 95% CI: 0.44-1.52) or in beta-blocker users. Also, no significant drug-gene interaction was found with the ACE I/D polymorphism. In conclusion, subjects with at least one copy of the AGTR1 573C allele might have more benefit from ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "112": "It is accepted practice to prescribe beta-blockers in order to retard aortic dilatation and prevent aortic dissection and rupture in patients with Marfan syndrome. A critical review of the published pharmacological studies shows this practice to be based on limited evidence. The data from small clinical and experimental studies with surrogate end points suggest greater potential benefit from alternative drug regimens, and a recent experimental study showed that losartan may interrupt the mechanism of disease as well as deal with its functional consequences. It is now essential to perform large, collaborative, randomised controlled trials with clinical end points of new treatments in Marfan syndrome.", 
    "113": "Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade protects from angiotensin II-induced target-organ damage. 11beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 protects the mineralocorticoid receptor from activation by glucocorticoids; however, high glucocorticoid concentrations and absent 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 in some tissues make glucocorticoids highly relevant mineralocorticoid receptor ligands. We investigated the effects of corticosterone (10(-6) to 10(-12) mol/L) on early vascular mineralocorticoid receptor signaling by Western blotting, confocal microscopy, and myography. Corticosterone initiated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation in rat vascular smooth muscle cells at > or =10(-11) mol/L doses. Protein synthesis inhibitors had no effect, indicating a nongenomic action. Corticosterone also stimulated c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, Src, and Akt phosphorylation at 15 minutes and enhanced angiotensin II-induced signaling at 5 minutes. A specific epidermal growth factor receptor blocker, AG1478, as well as the Src inhibitor PP2, markedly reduced corticosterone-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, as did preincubation of cells with the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone. Silencing mineralocorticoid receptor with small interfering RNA abolished corticosterone-induced effects. Corticosterone (10(-9) mol/L) enhanced phenylephrine-induced contraction of intact aortic rings. These effects were dependent on the intact endothelium, mineralocorticoid receptor, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling. We conclude that corticosterone induces rapid mineralocorticoid receptor signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells that involves mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent pathways. These new mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent signaling pathways suggest that glucocorticoids may contribute to vascular disease via mineralocorticoid receptor signaling, independent of circulating aldosterone.", 
    "114": "Amylin is a peptide hormone that is co-released with insulin from pancreatic beta-cells following a meal. Intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of amylin (1-100 pmol), or an amylin agonist, salmon calcitonin, elicited dose-dependent thermogenic, tachycardic, and hyperthermic responses in urethane-anesthetized rats. Intravenous (iv) administration of higher doses of amylin (100 pmol-20 nmol) also induced similar responses, although the amplitudes of these responses were significantly smaller than those elicited by icv administration, suggesting the primary action of amylin to be in the brain. However, the iv administration of amylin induced the responses slightly faster than the icv injection, the former responses occurring<4 min and the latter, at 8-10 min, after the administration. The iv but not the icv injection of amylin increased the respiratory exchange ratio transiently (<20 min), though the thermogenic response lasted for a longer period after both injections, indicating a shift from mixed fuel to predominantly carbohydrate utilization in the initial phase of thermogenesis induced by the iv injection of amylin. The differences in substrate utilization and latency of the responses suggest that the actions of amylin include partly different targets when administered centrally and peripherally. Moreover, pretreatment with a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol (5 mg kg(-1), iv), blocked all responses elicited by either icv or iv administration of amylin, whereas ablation of the area postrema in the hindbrain did not influence the effects of icv-administered amylin. These results suggest the involvement of amylin in postprandial energy expenditure, mediated by peripheral beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "115": "Prophylaxis of gastrointestinal bleeding is attempted in widely varying situations. In NSAID-induced peptic ulcer, the advantage of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors with regard to gastrointestinal damage has yet to be translated into an advantage in overall morbidity. Strategies for primary and secondary prevention of variceal bleeding have been established. Therapy tailored to hepatic venous pressure gradient has the potential to achieve clinical relevance. Several methods have been developed to prevent postpolypectomy bleeding, but their optimal risk-tailored application has yet to be demonstrated. Although octreotide treatment seems to be beneficial in reducing the blood loss from angiodysplasias, controlled studies to determine its optimal use are awaited. Stress-ulcer prophylaxis is commonly applied in critically ill patients. Although data indicate that H2-receptor antagonists and omeprazole are effective in preventing clinically significant bleeding, evidence for an advantage with respect to length of hospital or intensive-care-unit stay, as well as mortality, is still lacking. Since there is misuse of acid-suppressing drugs on regular wards, in-house guidelines may offer the potential for saving costs and reducing inappropriate prescription.", 
    "116": "Variceal bleeding is one of the most severe complications of portal hypertension related to liver cirrhosis. Primary prophylaxis is considered mandatory in patients with cirrhosis and high-risk oesophageal varices, and once varices have bled, every effort should be made to arrest the haemorrhage and prevent further bleeding episodes. In acute variceal bleeding, vasoactive drugs that lower portal pressure should be started even before endoscopy, and should be maintained for up to 5 days. The choice of vasoactive drug should be made according to local resources. Terlipressin, somatostatin and octreotide can be used; vasopressin plus transdermal nitroglycerin may be used if no other drug is available. In variceal bleeding, antibiotic therapy is also mandatory. In primary and secondary prophylaxis, beta-blockers are the mainstay of therapy. In secondary prophylaxis (but not in primary prophylaxis) these drugs can be combined with organic nitrates.", 
    "117": "Variceal ligation has proved more effective and safer than sclerotherapy and is currently the endoscopic treatment of choice for oesophageal varices. In acute bleeding, vasoactive drugs should be started before endoscopy and maintained for 2-5 days. The efficacy of drugs is improved when associated with emergency endoscopic therapy. Antibiotic prophylaxis should also be used. To prevent rebleeding, both endoscopic ligation and the combination of beta-blockers and nitrates may be used. Adding beta-blockers improves the efficacy of ligation. Haemodynamic responders to beta-blockers+/-nitrates (those with a decrease in portal pressure gradient HVPG to <12 mmHg or by >20% of baseline) have a marked reduction in the risk of haemorrhage and will not need further treatment. Beta-blockers significantly reduce the risk of a first haemorrhage in patients with large varices, and they improve survival. As compared to beta-blockers, endoscopic ligation reduces the risk of first bleeding without affecting mortality, and should be used in patients with contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers.", 
    "118": "Management of chronic heart failure in pediatrics has been altered by the adult literature showing improvements in mortality and hospitalization rates with the use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) for routine therapy of all classes of ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure. Many pediatric heart failure specialists have incorporated these agents into their routine management of pediatric heart failure related to dilated cardiomyopathy or ventricular dysfunction in association with congenital heart disease. Retrospective and small prospective case series have shown encouraging improvements in cardiac function and symptoms, but interpretation has been complicated by the high rate of spontaneous recovery in pediatric patients. A recently completed pediatric double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial showed no difference between placebo and two doses of carvedilol over a 6-month period of follow-up, with significant improvement of all three groups over the course of evaluation. Experience with adults has suggested that only certain beta-blockers, including carvedilol, bisoprolol, nebivolol, and metoprolol succinate, should be used in the treatment of heart failure and that patients with high-grade heart failure may derive the most benefit. Other studies surmise that early or prophylactic use of these medications may alter the risk of disease progression in some high-risk subsets, such as patients receiving anthracyclines or those with muscular dystrophy. This article reviews these topics using experience as well as data from all the recent pediatric studies on the use of beta-blockers to treat congestive heart failure, especially when related to systolic ventricular dysfunction.",

Patients with heart failure are increasingly managed in the primary care setting, and the emphasis of new national programs on early recognition of signs and diagnosis of heart failure suggest that this trend will continue. Beta blockers have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure when used with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and a diuretic.",

    "121": "It has been reported that the intestinal absorption of celiprolol, an antihypertensive drug, is inhibited when it is taken with orange juice; it has been suggested that element(s) in citrus juice are responsible for this. In the present study, the pharmacokinetic interaction between celiprolol and orange juice was characterized through in vivo experiments with rats. Celiprolol 5 mg/kg was injected into the rat duodenum together with 5 ml/kg of neutralized orange juice or the same concentration of hesperidin as in the orange juice. Plasma celiprolol concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). Concomitant administration of orange juice or hesperidin with celiprolol significantly decreased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by 74% and 75%, respectively, compared with control. These findings suggest that hesperidin is responsible for the decreased absorption of celiprolol and that orange juice taken with celiprolol has an inhibiting effect on intestinal absorption of the drug.",

    "128": "In the present study, the intracellular regulatory pathways involved in the adrenalin-stimulated chloride secretion across T84 cells were investigated. Biphasic characteristics were observed in the Isc response to the basolateral addition of adrenalin (0.25 nM-100 microM). The biphasic response was almost abolished by removing ambient Cl(-). Chloride secretion was found to depend on the activities of basolaterally located Na+-K+-2Cl(-) cotransporters and K+ channels. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine did not have any effect on either phase of adrenalin-induced Isc, while after pretreatment of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, the adrenalin-induced Isc was substantially abolished, suggesting the biphasic response may be mediated by the beta-adrenoceptor. Under whole cell patch-clamp conditions, T84 cells responded to adrenalin with a rise in inward current. The current, which exhibited a linear I-V relationship and time- and voltage-independent characteristics, was inhibited by the chloride channel blocker DPC and the reverse potential was close to the equilibrium potential for Cl(-) (0 mV), implying that the current was Cl(-) selective. When preloaded with a Ca2+-chelating agent, BAPTA/AM did not affect the Isc response to adrenalin, whereas the Isc was destroyed by pretreating the cells with an adenyl cyclase inhibitor, MDL12330A. These observations were further supported by the intracellular [cAMP] measurement experiment, indicating that adrenalin induced chloride secretion could be mediated by a beta-adrenoceptor only involving cAMP as an intracellular second messenger.",

In the present study, gradient LC methods were developed for simultaneous determination of the possible components of a polypill, i.e., lisinopril, aspirin and one each among atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin/simvastatin/pravastatin, in the presence of a total of 13 major interaction/degradation products. The drugs and the products were well separated using a reversed-phase (C-8) column and a mobile phase comprising of acetonitrile: phosphate buffer (pH 2.3). Other HPLC parameters were flow rate, 1 ml/min; detection wavelength, 210 nm; column oven temperature, 60 degrees C; and injection volume, 5 microl. The methods were validated for linearity, precision, accuracy, and specificity. These were further modified to make them compatible for LC-MS studies by removal of the phosphate buffer and adjustment of pH by formic acid. The suitability of the methods for LC-MS studies was established by matching the theoretical mass values of the drugs with those obtained experimentally. These methods were used to determine mass values of the major interaction/degradation products, which helped to know the source of their origin.",

The time courses of systolic (sBP) and diastolic blood pressure (dBP) and heart rate (HR) are expressed as sigmoidal curve. We have found that the hemodynamic changes can be precisely curve-fitted with a logistic function giving non-linear curve. The four parameters of the logistic function present the first asymptote, the last asymptote, the slope at the inflection point, and the time to the inflection point. Moreover, each logistic parameter is used for the effects of drug dose, age and sex differences of subjects on the hemodynamic change. In this review, we introduce the analyses with the logistic function for the changes in sBP, and dBP during preintubation period and HR, sBP, and dBP during infusion of landiolol hydrochloride, an ultra-short-acting beta1-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, which is used for subjects with tachycardia during general anesthesia. The logistic parameters are useful for assessing the hemodynamic response during general anesthesia.

There is only scarce randomized intervention trials available in those patients so it is difficult to estimate whether the cardiovascular benefit of the treatment is related to blood pressure lowering per se or to class or drug specific properties. This paper reviews the different class of antihypertensive drugs focusing on their advantages and disadvantages in dialysis patients. On a practical ground, prescription will be driven by pharmacokinetics considerations and mostly according to specific indications pertinent to cardiovascular complications associated with hypertension.",

The objective of the present study was to determine the extent to which recently diagnosed hypertensive Canadians modify their lifestyles and to examine how lifestyle modification relates to antihypertensive medication use. The longitudinal National Population Health Survey in Canada was conducted between 1994 and 2002, including five interview cycles at two-year intervals. During this time, 1281 persons reported hypertension in one cycle but not in the previous cycle, and were considered to be new hypertensive patients. Information collected included body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and medication use. The main lifestyle modification associated with newly diagnosed hypertensive patients was smoking cessation, with a 18.6% relative risk reduction (RRR). A smaller change was seen in decreasing physical inactivity (RRR 6.2%). Persons not taking antihypertensive medication were not more likely to make lifestyle improvements. Paradoxically, new hypertensive patients showed increased numbers in the obese category (RRR -9.6%). Weight gain was especially marked among antihypertensive medication users and largest in female beta-blocker users (RRR -36.6%). If confirmed, this needs to be considered when prescribing to overweight people. In general, a greater effort is required to manage hypertension by lifestyle risk modification with or without antihypertensive medication.", 
    "142": "Despite the scientific evidence that secondary prevention medical therapies reduce mortality in patients with established atherosclerosis, these therapies continue to be underused in patients receiving conventional care. To address this issue, the University of California, Los Angeles, Cardiovascular Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program was implemented in 1994. This hospital-based system focused on initiation of antiplatelet therapy, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and statin therapy (irrespective of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) in conjunction with diet and exercise counseling in patients hospitalized with coronary artery and other atherosclerotic vascular disease. Preprinted orders, critical pathways, discharge forms, physician and nursing education, pocket cards, patient educational material, and treatment utilization reports facilitated program implementation. Statin use at the time of discharge increased from 6% before initiation of the program to 86% after the Cardiovascular Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program was implemented (P < 0.001). Improved use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was also observed. Importantly, in-hospital initiation of cardiovascular protective therapies had a dramatic effect on long-term treatment rates and patient compliance. The improved use of cardiovascular protective therapies was associated with a significant reduction in clinical events the first year after discharge: the death and nonfatal myocardial infarction rate decreased from 14.8% to 6.4% (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.59; P < 0.01). These improved treatment rates have been sustained over an 8-year period. Compared with conventional care, the Cardiovascular Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program has been associated with a significant increase in treatment utilization of evidence-based medications, more patients achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL, and improved clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized for cardiovascular disease. Hospital-based atherosclerosis treatment systems are an important step to help eliminate the cardiovascular treatment gap and dramatically reduce the death and disability caused by atherosclerotic vascular disease.",

The proposed critical pathway targets 100% use of fibrinolysis in fibrinolytic-eligible patients, 95% use of aspirin, and 90% use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and incorporates a strategy of early hospital discharge for low-risk patients. Risk reduction for each intervention was estimated based on the benefits seen in large randomized controlled clinical trials or meta-analysis.", 
    "145": "In the TIMI 9 Registry, fibrinolysis was used in 60% of the patients; primary percutaneous coronary intervention, in 9%; and no reperfusion therapy, in 31%. Only 87% of the registry patients took aspirin during hospitalization. Of those with documented left ventricular dysfunction or congestive heart failure, 32% were discharged on ACE-I; and of those with normal ejection fraction and no evidence of congestive heat failure, only 58% were treated with beta-blockers at discharge. For early benefit and by increasing the use of reperfusion therapy and aspirin to 95% and improving the time to treatment, one could potentially save 13 lives per 1,000 patients treated per year. Similarly, if beta-blocker and ACE-I use increased up to 90% for the long term, almost 2 lives per 1,000 patients treated per year could potentially be saved. In summary, by expanding the use of a critical pathway for thrombolysis in STEMI, 15 lives per 1,000 patients treated per year could be saved. To evaluate the potential economic impact of this critical pathway on low-risk patients, 358 of 505 thrombolysis patients had no recurrent ischemia, MI, shock, or congestive heart failure through day 5. Their median length of stay was 6.7 days (25-75th percentiles, range, 4.8-10.3 days), with 73% staying in-hospital more than the target of 5 days, with similar findings for patients treated with primary angioplasty.",

An early invasive strategy (catheterization/revascularization) in conjunction with aggressive antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy offers the most effective means of reducing ischemic complications in intermediate- and high-risk patients. In low-risk patients, stress testing serves to indicate whether a secondary prevention strategy or elective catheterization/percutaneous coronary intervention and GP IIb/IIIa inhibition is more appropriate. NSTE ACS also confers a long-term risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, regardless of whether initial management follows a medical or interventional approach. Combination aspirin and clopidogrel therapy is effective for secondary prevention across the spectrum of NSTE ACS patients, regardless of risk or initial treatment strategy (conservative or invasive). Long-term aspirin and clopidogrel therapy addresses the thrombotic component of atherothrombosis, while combined beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and statin therapy is directed against the atheroma.", 
    "148": "Perioperative cardiac ischemia and infarction are important causes of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. There is now significant evidence that the use of prophylactic beta-adrenergic antagonists among selected patients at risk for perioperative cardiovascular complications is associated with a reduction in myocardial ischemia and cardiac events. Furthermore, consensus guidelines have incorporated the findings of recent studies and provide recommendations for the appropriate utilization of beta-adrenergic antagonists among selected patients. Despite these guidelines, it is unknown to what extent these recommendations have become translated into clinical practice. After measuring perioperative beta-blocker use among participating hospitals within the New York Presbyterian Health Network, we developed a multicenter educational intervention to improve the overall utilization of beta-adrenergic prophylactic therapy in accordance with best practice guidelines. The literature supporting the development of this intervention is presented in this paper, along with the tools that are currently being used for decision support across an academic healthcare network.",

    "158": "Previously, we presented in vivo evidence for a physiological significance of cAMP-regulated CFTR Cl(-) channels in Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) reabsorption in the ductal system of the rat submandibular gland. Here, we address the mechanism by which basal CFTR activation contributes to the transepithelial Cl(-) movement evoked by muscarinic stimulation. The Cl(-) concentration ([Cl(-)]) was increased in the final saliva from rat submandibular gland during pilocarpine stimulation when a small interfering RNA for CFTR or a specific CFTR inhibitor, CFTR(inh)-172, was injected retrogradely into the gland's own duct, indicating that basal CFTR activation is involved in Cl(-) reabsorption. Systemically administered propranolol failed to alter the [Cl(-)], suggesting little involvement of a beta-adrenergic pathway in the Cl(-) movement that occurs through basal CFTR activation. Intraductal injection of suramin (a nonspecific P2-receptor antagonist) increased the salivary [Cl(-)], indicating the existence of endogenous purinergic activation. Upon separate intraductal injection, ATP and a P2Y(2)-receptor agonist, UTP, decreased the salivary [Cl(-)] almost equipotently. CFTR(inh)-172 and suramin each prevented these effects, whereas 2',3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (Bz-ATP), a P2X(7) agonist, had no specific effect. Pilocarpine stimulation evoked ATP secretion into the salivary fluid. Immunohistochemistry revealed the partial coexistence of CFTR and P2Y(2) receptors on the luminal surface of epithelial cells in the striated ducts of this gland. These results raise the possibility that muscarinic stimulation-induced Cl(-) reabsorption occurs through basal CFTR activity and that this is regulated by P2Y(2) receptors in the ductal epithelium via stimulation by ATP secreted into the salivary fluid.",

We perfused one of the following solutions into isolated rat lungs in a closed circulating system, either prior to I/R injury (groups 1-5) or following 60 min of ischaemia (groups 6-10): (1) 0.9% normal saline (NS), (2) Penta, (3) Penta+Dex, (4) Penta+Bt(2)-cAMP, (5) Penta+beta(2)-agonist inhalation, (6) Penta+Dex, (7) Penta+Bt(2)-cAMP, (8) Penta+beta(2)-agonist inhalation, (9) Penta+Dex+Bt(2)-cAMP, or (10) Penta+Dex+beta(2)-agonist inhalation. Haemodynamics, lung weight gain (LWG), capillary filtration coefficient (K(fc)), cytokine mRNA levels, and lung pathology were assessed. Results showed that Dex, Bt(2)-cAMP, or beta(2)-agonist as an additive to Penta decreased K(fc) and LWG below values seen with Penta alone. Furthermore, LWG and K(fc) values in groups with three protective agents were lower than those in groups with two protective agents. Significantly lower levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 mRNAs were observed in groups treated with Dex. Histopathological studies showed decreased injury profiles for all combined therapy groups. We conclude that the addition of Dex, Bt(2)-cAMP, or beta(2)-adrenergic agonist to Penta solution promoted attenuation of I/R injury. Furthermore, combination therapy with three protective agents (Penta+Dex+beta(2)-adrenergic agonist) caused the greatest attenuation of I/R.", 
    "160": "A new approach based on miniemulsion polymerization is demonstrated for synthesis of molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MIP-NP; 30-150 nm) with \"monoclonal\" binding behavior. The performance of the MIP nanoparticles is characterized with partial filling capillary electrochromatography, for the analysis of rac-propranolol, where (S)-propranolol is used as a template. In contrast to previous HPLC and CEC methods based on the use of MIPs, there is no apparent tailing for the enantiomer peaks, and baseline separation with 25,000-60,000 plate number is achieved. These effects are attributed to reduction of the MIP site heterogeneity by means of peripheral location of the core cross-linked NP and to MIP-binding sites with the same ordered radial orientation. This new MIP approach is based on the substitution of the functional monomers with a surfactant monomer, sodium N-undecenoyl glycinate (SUG) for improved inclusion in the MIP-NP structure and to the use of a miniemulsion in the MIP-NP synthesis. The feasibility of working primarily with aqueous electrolytes (10 mM phosphate with a 20% acetonitrile at pH 7) is attributable to the micellar character of the MIP-NPs, provided by the inclusion of the SUG monomers in the structure. To our knowledge this is the first example of \"monoclonal\" MIP-NPs incorporated in CEC separations of drug enantiomers."
