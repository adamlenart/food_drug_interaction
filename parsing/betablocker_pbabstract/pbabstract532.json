In the present study, NPY was found to exert non-adrenergic nasal vasoconstrictor actions. Postganglionic sympathetic nerve stimulation induced a release of NPY-like immunoreactivity (LI) concomitant with vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa. About 60 and 70% of the vasoconstrictor responses upon sympathetic stimulation at 2 and 10 Hz, respectively, remained after pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol which abolished the effects of exogenous NA. Preganglionic denervation one week prior to the experiments did not change the vasoconstrictor response to sympathetic nerve stimulation or the NA or NPY contents of the nasal mucosa. The levels of NPY-LI in the superior cervical ganglion were however reduced. After reserpine treatment, which depleted the nasal NA content by almost 90% and the NPY content by 50%, a vasoconstrictor response to nerve stimulation was still present. After reserpine treatment combined with preganglionic denervation, nerve stimulation simultaneously induced an increased output of NPY-LI and a marked long-lasting vasoconstriction which was not influenced by phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. The reserpine-induced depletion of NA was not influenced by preganglionic denervation while the reduction in the nasal content of NPY-LI was prevented. In conclusion, NPY could be a non-adrenergic mediator of sympathetic vascular effects in cat nasal mucosa.",

There appears to have been spontaneous disruption of the anterior hyaloid face in all 3 cases. Control of the glaucoma was achieved by medical treatment in one case and by trabeculectomy in two.", 
    "2": "1 Six male patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and seven normal control subjects were each given 80 mg twice daily of conventional propranolol for 1 week and 160 mg once daily of a long acting preparation (LA) of propranolol for 1 week. 2 Plasma propranolol levels were measured at regular intervals on the first and seventh days of both weeks and also following an acute intravenous infusion of 10 mg propranolol on a separate occasion. 3 After the single intravenous dose the elimination half-life tended to be prolonged in the cirrhotic group (median 7.15 h) compared with controls (median 2.92 h) (P = 0.055). 4 After multiple oral dosing with 80 mg twice daily of conventional propranolol the steady-state plasma concentration (Css), area under the curve (AUC tau), peak concentration (Cmax) and trough concentration (Cmin) were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients and the peak: trough ratio (Cmax/Cmin) was significantly lower than controls. 5 After multiple oral dosing with 160 mg LA once daily Cmin was significantly higher than Cmax/min significantly lower in cirrhotic patients; Css, AUC and Cmax were higher than controls but not statistically different. 6 Within both subject groups the bioavailability of 80 mg twice daily of conventional propranolol tended to be greater than 160 mg LA once daily. Cmax was significantly higher in both groups and Css higher in the cirrhotic group with conventional propranolol. 7 In the cirrhotic group the mean reduction in supine heart rate in the steady state was 31.8% with conventional 80 mg twice daily propranolol and 23.75% with 160 mg LA once daily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "In cultured hepatocytes entrapped within Ca-alginate, liver-specific functions such as induction of tyrosine aminotransferase and serine dehydratase were stimulated by increasing the cell density. In contrast, a growth-related function such as induction of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was strongly stimulated by decreasing the cell density. This reciprocal regulation was mimicked by the addition of plasma membranes purified from adult rat liver to entrapment cultures at low cell density. Also, gluconeogenesis from lactate was stimulated by the addition of epinephrine (alpha,beta-agonist) with propranolol (beta-blocker). These results suggest that entrapped hepatocytes maintain not only terminal-differentiated state but also alpha-adrenergic response as shown in vivo.", 
    "4": "Apamin has been shown to antagonize the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) inhibitory system in guinea pig taenia coli. We have examined the effects of apamin on the nonadrenergic noncholinergic inhibitory system and its putative transmitters in isolated guinea pig trachea. Electrical field stimulation (ES) of isolated trachea pretreated with atropine and propranolol evoked reproducible relaxations that were blocked by tetrodoxin, but were unaffected by apamin. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), adenosine (AD), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of histamine (H)-induced contractions of isolated trachea but the inhibitory actions of these agents were not significantly affected by apamin. In contrast, apamin virtually abolished ES-evoked relaxations in guinea pig isolated taenia caeci, and reduced the inhibition of H-induced contraction by ATP from 40% to 1%. We conclude that neither the NANC inhibitory system in the guinea pig trachea nor its putative mediators VIP, AD, and ATP are antagonized by apamin, in contrast to taenia caeci.", 
    "5": "Despite being poorly absorbed practolol (N-4-2-hydroxy-3-(1-methyl-ethyl)-amino propoxy phenyl acetamine) inhibited the accumulation of cell mat hydroxyproline, a measure of collagen synthesis, by human skin fibroblasts (DT2PH) in vitro, (ID50 0.8 X 10(-3) M). The degree of inhibition was dependent on the concentration of practolol used and the incubation time. Neither preinitiation of collagen synthesis nor omitting ascorbic acid from the incubation medium modified this inhibitory action. In contrast, in vitro generated metabolites of practol, using normal and aroclor induced hamster liver preparation, and structural analogues of practolol had no effect on cell mat hydroxyproline levels. Related compounds, propranolol, (1-(isopropylamino)-3(1-naphthyl-oxy)2-propranolol), and paracetamol, (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide), both inhibited hydroxyproline levels. Fibroblasts derived from uninvolved skin of a psoriasis patient (PS1) were several fold more sensitive to practolol and propranolol than cells derived from normal skin but showed little change in sensitivity towards paracetamol.", 
    "6": "In order to assess whether Sotalol is an effective drug in patients (pts) with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) was performed in 30 pts with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) after myocardial infarction. Prior to Sotalol, pts were treated with a mean of 3.1 +/- 1.2 antiarrhythmic class I drugs. None of these drugs prevented VT or VF. During the control study, sustained VT was induced in 15 pts (50.0%), non-sustained VT in 8 pts (26.7%) and VF in 7 pts (23.3%). Treatment with Sotalol 240-320 mg/day was started and after 3.1 +/- 1.1 weeks PVS was repeated. In none of the pts could VF be induced; sustained VT and non-sustained VT were still inducible in 4 pts (13.3%) and in 6 pts (20.0%) respectively. In 20 pts (66.7%) either no or only a short ventricular response was inducible. Our data show that Sotalol appears to be an effective antiarrhythmic agent in pts with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "7": "Phototherapy of newborn rats (NBR) resulted in a decrease in serum calcium and melatonin levels. Transcranial light penetrance in NBR increased with wavelength. Below 640 nm (penetrance = 6.9%), no hypocalcemic effect could be demonstrated. Shielding the occiput of NBR prevented a decrease in serum calcium during phototherapy and substantially reduced the decrease in melatonin found in unshielded NBR. Intraperitoneal injection of propranolol, an inhibitor of melatonin synthesis, caused a decrease in serum calcium in shaded NBR. In contrast, when melatonin was injected with propranolol a decrease in serum calcium did not occur. Additionally, intraperitoneal isoproterenol before phototherapy protected against a decrease in serum calcium. These data are consistent with an hypothesis that a decrease in serum calcium during phototherapy results from transcranial photic inhibition of melatonin synthesis.", 
    "8": "The effects of quinidine on sinus nodal and A-V nodal function were assessed in 20 patients (age: 60 +/- 7 years) with sinus bradycardia and a prolonged A-H interval. Electrophysiological studies were performed twice in each patient. In the first study, the measurements of sinus and A-V node function were evaluated both in the basal state and after autonomic blockade (propranolol 0.2 mg kg-1 and atropine 0.04 mg kg-1). Oral quinidine was administered for 3-4 days (1200 mg day-1) and the study was then repeated using the same methods. Comparison of data obtained in the two studies in the basal state allowed us to evaluate the overall effect of quinidine. Comparing the results obtained following autonomic blockade, the direct action of the drug could be assessed. In the basal state quinidine did not significantly change the function of either node. In contrast, after autonomic blockade, significant changes were noted after quinidine. In 3 patients with sinus rate less than 50 beats min-1 and an abnormal intrinsic heart rate, quinidine induced marked depression of sinus automaticity. These data suggest that: (1) in patients with sinus bradycardia and prolongation of the A-H interval, oral quinidine has a direct depressant effect on sinus and A-V nodal function, but this effect is counteracted by autonomically mediated actions; (2) in patients with moderate or severe bradycardia and an abnormal intrinsic heart rate, the drug can induce marked depression of sinus automaticity.", 
    "9": "Labetalol is a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent. A loading dose may be used to antagonize sympathetic overactivity rapidly after surgery and be followed by a continuous infusion to achieve a stable effect. The haemodynamic effects and pharmacokinetics of this method of labetalol administration were studied in six rewarmed, extubated and sedated patients 15 +/- 2 h after aortobifemoral bypass surgery. Patients were monitored with radial and thermistor-tipped pulmonary artery catheters. Labetalol 1.5 mg kg-1 was injected i.v. over 5 min and a maintenance infusion of 0.2 mg kg-1 h-1 was started 30 min later and continued for 5.5 h. Within 5 min of the loading dose, i.v. labetalol induced significant (P less than 0.05) decreases in mean arterial pressure (-32 +/- 11%), in heart rate (-20 +/- 11%) and in cardiac index (-26 +/- 15%) that lasted throughout the infusion. Changes in systemic vascular resistance were not uniform, but an increase was not observed in any patient. Mean stroke volume index and ventricular filling pressures were not significantly affected by labetalol administration. The mean measured steady state plasma concentration (Css) (264 +/- 46 ng ml-1) was higher than predicted (170 ng ml-1) because the clearance (13.1 +/- 2.4 ml kg-1 min-1) was lower than that used to calculate the infusion rate. We conclude that labetalol is an effective antihypertensive agent in the postoperative period. A Css can be achieved rapidly by such i.v. administration and this offers the advantage of inducing rapid and stable haemodynamic effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "The influence of norepinephrine on lung fluid flow rate was studied in seven chronically catheterized fetal lambs. Lung fluid was collected through a catheter inserted into the fetal trachea. In six experiments, continuous saline solution infusion for 1 hour followed by equivolumnar norepinephrine (3.0 micrograms/min) for 1 hour via the fetal jugular vein was carried out. In three additional experiments (two fetuses), a 3.0 mg intravenous bolus of propranolol was administered before norepinephrine infusion. Saline solution infusion did not influence the lung fluid flow rate or fetal biophysical and biochemical parameters. Norepinephrine increased fetal blood pressure by 22% and decreased lung fluid flow by 45% from control values. Lung fluid flow rate recovered within 2 hours after the end of the norepinephrine infusion. Pretreatment with propranolol did not alter the results. In addition to previous reports that demonstrated beta-sympathomimetic agonist-enhanced reabsorption of lung fluid from fetal alveolar epithelial cells, our present results suggest that a reduction in fetal lung fluid secretion may be implemented as well through stimulation of alpha-sympathomimetic receptor sites in the pulmonary vasculature.", 
    "11": "The acute effects of the beta 1-adrenoceptor inhibition by atenolol were investigated on conscious rats. Cardiac output and organ blood flow were measured by 15-microns radiolabelled microspheres during control and 20 min after administration of atenolol (1 mg/kg body wt). Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously. Arterial blood gases and pH were determined immediately after the two microsphere injections and arterial blood samplings. The mean arterial blood pressure fell significantly shortly after the injection of atenolol and was reduced by 9% (p less than 0.02) after 20 min. Heart rate fell by 17% (p less than 0.05). The total peripheral vascular resistance increased by 25% (p less than 0.05). At the same time the arterial acid-base chemistry remained unaltered from the control. The cardiac output fell by 24% (p less than 0.05). Blood flow fell to all organs and tissues (0-67%) except to the brain, adrenals, liver, ears and diaphragm. The greatest decrease was seen in perfusion of the adipose tissue (67%) and of the spleen (60%), indicating that the blood flow to these organs are normally highly influenced by beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. The estimated work load of the heart was reduced by 20% which correlated well to a reduction of myocardial blood flow to the same degree.", 
    "12": "Selectively bred long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice differ markedly in ethanol-induced adrenocortical response. Intracerebroventricular injections of saline elicited a 'stress-induced' adrenocortical response in both lines of mice, and intracerebroventricular infusions of noradrenergic and cholinergic compounds modulated ethanol-induced and stress-induced adrenocortical responses differentially in these mice. Clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, blocked ethanol-induced elevations in plasma corticosterone in a dose-dependent manner (1 and 10 micrograms) in LS mice; however, only the 10-micrograms dose of clonidine effectively antagonized this response in SS mice. Clonidine was less effective in blocking adrenocortical activity induced by stress than that induced by ethanol. Yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, induced a marked elevation in plasma corticosterone in LS mice but not in SS mice; however, this compound did not alter ethanol-induced adrenocortical responses in either line of mice. Yohimbine reversed the inhibitory effect of clonidine in ethanol-treated LS and SS mice. Phentolamine, a nonspecific alpha-adrenergic antagonist, and propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist at high doses (10 micrograms), produced slight increases in plasma corticosterone in LS mice only. Neither these compounds nor methoxamine, a nonspecific alpha-adrenergic agonist, altered the effect of ethanol on adrenocortical activity in LS or SS mice. Carbachol, a mixed muscarinic/nicotinic agonist, significantly increased adrenocortical response in both LS and SS mice and potentiated ethanol-induced elevation in plasma corticosterone in both lines of mice. However, atropine, a nonspecific muscarinic antagonist, or hexamethonium, a nicotinic antagonist, did not modify ethanol-induced elevations in plasma corticosterone in LS and SS mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "To determine whether gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) affects the contractile properties of airway smooth muscle and, if so, what the mechanism of action is, the authors studied guinea pig tracheal rings under isometric conditions in vitro. GABA and related substances, baclofen and muscimol, had no effect on the resting tension but reversibly depressed contractions induced by electrical field stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion, IC50 values (mean +/- S.E.) being 5.6 +/- 1.4 X 10(-6) M, 6.8 +/- 0.9 X 10(-6) M and 8.5 +/- 1.5 X 10(-5) M, respectively. In contrast, GABA did not alter the response to exogenous acetylcholine or the nonadrenergic noncholinergic inhibitory component. Pretreatment of tissues with bicuculline antagonized the inhibitory effect of GABA as well as that of baclofen. This inhibitory effect was not modified by propranolol, phentolamine, hemicholinium-3 or naloxone, but it was blocked by the Cl channel blocker furosemide and by the substitution of external Cl. These results suggest that GABA decreases the contractile response of airway smooth muscle to cholinergic nerve stimulation by inhibiting the evoked release of acetylcholine and that this effect is exerted by activating Cl-dependent, bicuculline-sensitive GABA receptors.", 
    "14": "Non-cardioselective beta-blockers are used for prevention of re-bleeding from oesophageal varices in cirrhotics with portal hypertension. Nadolol, a non-cardioselective beta-blocker with a low liposolubility and a low hepatic metabolism, has been demonstrated to decrease portal pressure in cirrhotic patients. Since cirrhotics need long-term treatment, we investigated long-term effects of beta-adrenergic blockade with nadolol on hepatic and renal haemodynamics and function in a group of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. In 19 patients with cirrhosis, after one and six months of treatment with nadolol hepatic venous pressure gradient showed a significant and persistent decrease, averaging 19% and 22%, respectively. Hepatic function and renal haemodynamics and function remained unaffected. Oesophageal varices severity was lowered in 11/19 patients after one month, in 9/16 after six months, in 8/14 after 12 months and in 5/10 after 18 months. Our results showed that, also after long-term treatment, nadolol decreases portal pressure and, in approximately 50% of patients, oesophageal varices severity, without side-effects on liver and renal function.", 
    "15": "This study was designed to evaluate the importance of local release of autonomic neuromediators when electrical stimuli are applied to the right atrium to measure the atrial fibrillation threshold (AFT). Experiments were performed in 16 open-chest dogs anesthetized with alpha-chloralose. The dogs were denervated by bilateral transection of the stellates and cervical vagi. The AFT was determined in 11 dogs by delivering either a train of stimuli (14 pulses, 4 ms, 100 Hz) or a single stimulus (10 ms) to the right atrium during its vulnerable period. In eight dogs, beta-adrenergic blockade with timolol (0.1 mg/kg) had no effect on the AFT determined with either method. Atropine (0.2 mg/kg), given after timolol, significantly increased the train-of-pulses AFT from 4.7 +/- 0.4 to 32.3 +/- 4.6 mA (P less than 0.001). The single-pulse AFT increased from 16.5 +/- 1.5 to 17.8 +/- 1.5 mA (P less than 0.05). Atropine had a similar effect on the AFT when it was given in the absence of timolol (n = 3). In five additional dogs, a monophasic action potential was recorded while a 10-mA train was delivered to the atrium during its absolute refractory period. There was marked shortening of the monophasic action potential duration (55 +/- 6 ms) in the first beat after the train. The shortening was totally abolished by atropine (0.2 mg/kg). The results suggest that a train of stimuli liberates local stores of acetylcholine, which cause a shortening of atrial repolarization time and a profound decrease in the current necessary to evoke fibrillation.", 
    "16": "We studied the relation between O2 consumption (VO2) and systolic pressure-volume (PV) area (PVA) in the left ventricles of eight puppies (2-4 mo old). PVA is the area circumscribed by the end-systolic and end-diastolic PV curves and systolic PV trajectory. We assumed PVA to represent the total mechanical energy generated by ventricular contraction. We produced isovolumic contractions at different volumes in the left ventricles isolated and cross-circulated with adult dogs. VO2 closely correlated with PVA in each of control contractile state, an enhanced contractile state with epinephrine, and a depressed contractile state with propranolol in each heart. The slope of the regression line of VO2 on PVA was not significantly affected by epinephrine and propranolol. The regression line shifted upward with epinephrine and downward with propranolol. These characteristics of the puppy's VO2-PVA relation were comparable to those of the adult dog. These results suggest that similar relations hold between myocardial mechanics and energetics in both the puppy and adult dog despite the differences in the heart size and contractile properties.", 
    "17": "Studies in humans have shown that chronic elevation of blood pressure induces early alterations in the large arteries, consisting mainly of increased diameter, increased pulse wave velocity, and decreased arterial compliance. Acute reduction of blood pressure, per se, does not necessarily correct these alterations homogeneously. For instance, cadralazine reduced brachial artery diameter and urapidil decreased pulse wave velocity, without accompanying changes in forearm arterial compliance. In contrast, acebutolol, isosorbide dinitrate, nicardipine, and nitrendipine, for the same acute decrease in blood pressure, improved forearm arterial compliance by a concomitant decrease in pulse wave velocity and increase in arterial diameter. To determine whether or not these vascular effects persist with long-term acebutolol therapy, nine hypertensive patients were treated for a period of 3 months. Forearm hemodynamic and cytosolic free calcium concentrations in platelets were simultaneously assessed before and after treatment. Compared with placebo baseline values, chronic acebutolol therapy significantly decreased mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.01), pulse wave velocity (p less than 0.01), and platelet free calcium concentration (p less than 0.05); forearm arterial compliance was increased (p less than 0.01), but brachial artery diameter did not change. Platelet calcium concentration correlated closely with pulse wave velocity even at constant mean arterial pressure. These findings suggest a relaxant effect of acebutolol on the smooth musculature of large arteries, which is independent of changes in blood pressure and arterial diameter, and possibly mediated by changes in cytosolic calcium levels.", 
    "18": "Usually, when antihypertensive therapy is considered in the hypertensive patient, structural cardiovascular changes are already well established and the structure of the cardiovascular system is redesigned to maintain higher than normal pressure. Left ventricular hypertrophy has been shown to be an independent risk factor for all manifestations of coronary heart disease. In hypertension, the increased pressure load over a long period of time induces degenerative changes in, for example, cerebral, renal, and coronary vessels, with well-known clinical consequences. Independent of the primary cause of hypertension, full reversal to normotension will probably occur only when the structurally reset cardiovascular system has been returned to normal dimensions by regression of structural vascular changes. In animal models several forms of antihypertensive treatment have prevented the development of or induced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy as well as medial hypertrophy of the vessels. These effects have been related both to the extent of blood pressure reduction and to the degree of inhibition of neurohormonal trophic influences. In humans the results have been somewhat contradictory. Plethysmography has demonstrated a reduction of resistance at maximal dilatation with either combination therapy or pindolol but not with mefruside or atenolol. There may be several explanations for the difficulties in showing regression of structural vascular changes in humans: (1) inadequate treatment of high blood pressure, (2) reflexogenic activation of neurohormonal trophic factors, (3) investigation of an unsuitable vascular bed, or (4) treatment started too late. The ultimate goal in the treatment of hypertension is, of course, reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but normalization of structural cardiovascular changes is clearly the second most important therapeutic goal.", 
    "19": "Propranolol inhibits sperm motility and has been considered as a spermicide contraceptive. In view of the inhibitory effects of D-propranolol on sperm flagellar activity, we have investigated its effect on motility and growth of two human flagellate, protozoan parasites. D-propranolol had a dose-dependant inhibitory effect on motility of Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis with ED50s of 0.38 and 0.66 mmol/l respectively, D-propranolol also inhibited growth of both parasites with ED50s of 0.18 and 0.23 mmol/l for Giardia and Trichomonas respectively. D-propranolol, unlike DL-propranolol is devoid of the unwanted effects of beta-blockade, and thus may be a useful antiprotozoal drug particularly after vaginal placement when it is concentrated in vaginal mucus.", 
    "20": "Arterial blood pressure and pulse rate changes following tracheal intubation were studied in 80 patients undergoing oral surgical procedures who received an etomidate/suxamethonium anesthetic induction sequence. Three treatment groups and a control group were used. Intravenous labetalol (1 mg/kg), acebutolol (0.25 mg/kg), lidocaine (2 mg/kg), and saline (1 ml), injected prior to anesthesia, were compared with respect to their effect on the hemodynamic consequences of direct laryngoscopy followed by the passage of an endotracheal tube. A pre-induction dose of labetalol was found to be more effective than acebutolol and lidocaine in attenuating the pressor response to instrumentation and intubation. Labetalol should prove most useful for those patients at risk from the transient hypertension and tachycardia following instrumentation and intubation.",

    "22": "The effects of class I to IV antiarrhythmic drugs on ventricular arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation, in relation to epicardial conduction delay during acute myocardial ischaemia were investigated in 40 open-chest anaesthetized dogs. In these animals transient coronary artery occlusion lasting 20 minutes was performed. Sixteen dogs served as controls; four groups of 6 dogs each received lidocaine (2 mg kg-1 + 50 micrograms kg-1 over 20 minutes), metoprolol (2 mg kg-1 i.v.), d-sotalol (5 mg kg-1 i.v.) and verapamil (0.25 mg kg-1 i.v.), respectively 5 minutes prior to coronary occlusion. Epicardial conduction delay was assessed by means of an epicardial mapping electrode array consisting of 42 bipolar electrodes. In the control group conduction delay displayed a bimodal time course in the ischaemic area with a maximum of 38 +/- 10 ms 6 minutes after coronary occlusion followed by a partial improvement after 12 to 15 minutes. After pretreatment with lidocaine the peak conduction delay in the ischaemic area was significantly increased (43.2 +/- 12), whereas metropolol (21.5 +/- 1.9), d-sotalol (16.6 +/- 3.7) and verapamil (16.3 +/- 3.1) significantly reduced conduction delay.

    "23": "We report a comparative study of the growth hormone nycthemeral secretion and the response of growth hormone secretion to pharmacological stimulation tests in 38 children with growth retardation. Two groups were separated according to the results of the nycthemeral growth hormone secretion study: a group of 26 children with normal secretion (mean maximum peak: 26.6 +/- 9.6 ng/ml and mean integrated concentration: 4.26 +/- 2.13 ng/ml/min) and a 2nd group of 12 children with hyposecretion (mean maximum peak: 6.7 +/- 2.6 ng/ml and mean integrated concentration: 1.08 +/- 0.45 ng/ml/min). There was no correlation between nycthemeral secretion and the responses to pharmacological tests. Thus, in the group with hyposecretion, 5 children had normal responses to a pharmacological test and in the group with normal secretion 13 children had intermediate responses to 2 pharmacological tests and 4 had dissociated responses. Thus, it appears mandatory to perform 2 different pharmacological tests in any investigation and to study the nycthemeral secretion in cases with intermediate or dissociated responses as well as in cases with normal responses when the clinical picture is consistent with growth hormone deficiency.", 
    "24": "The action of dopamine (DA) on salivation and the secretion of marker glycoproteins (GP) from secretory cells of the rat submandibular gland (SMG) was investigated using various blockers at doses of 1 or 2 mg/kg (i.v.). DA at doses from 5 to 40 mg/kg (i.p.) dose-dependently increased salivation and the concentration of protein in SMG saliva. The order of inhibitory potency on salivation was propranolol (PPR) greater than phentolamine (PHN) much greater than haloperidol (HAL) when DA was administered i.p. at a dose of 10 mg/kg and PHN much greater than HAL much greater than PPR when the dose of DA was 40 mg/kg. The concentration of protein in saliva after pretreatment with HAL or PHN increased significantly at a dose of 40 mg/kg of DA, but did not increase at a dose of 10 mg/kg of DA. Moreover, pretreatment with PPR decreased it at both doses of DA. The electrophoretic profiles of GP in DA-evoked saliva showed two characteristic main bands of GP I (130 KDa) and GP IV (21.5 KDa) contained in the acinar cells (AC) and a minor band of GP III (31 KDa) which originated from the granular tubular cells (GT). The profile was not changed by pretreatment with PHN and HAL when DA was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg, but at a dose of 40 mg/kg, the intensity of band I increased. Pretreatment with PPR, when DA was administered at 40 mg/kg, caused an increase in the intensity of band III and a reduction in that of band I. These results suggest that DA, at low doses, affects the AC, whereas at a higher dose, it affects both the AC and GT.", 
    "25": "We have previously reported that chloroform is a very potent stimulator of rat hepatic Ornithine Decarboxylase (ODC) activity. At that time we conducted the obligatory time course and dose response studies in male and female rats. However, in an attempt to more thoroughly understand the mechanism of this stimulation, we have examined the effects of a series of pharmacologic, physiologic and toxicologic manipulations on the chloroform response. These studies involved: in vivo experiments in which animals were pretreated with compounds known to effect the various physiological systems and then challenged with chloroform and in vitro experiments in which chloroform was added to the incubation media with/without the compound of interest. The results did not allow the assignment of a specific effect of any of the manipulations to the mechanism of the chloroform response, although much data of significant interest evolved.", 
    "26": "The effect of the two isomers of propranolol was tested on nomotopic and ectopic cardiac automaticity in the rat. The spontaneously beating isolated right atria of the rat was used as a model for studying the effect of these drugs on nomotopic automaticity. Ectopic automaticity was induced by local injury of the isolated right ventricle. Both dextro and levopropranolol reduce nomotopic and abolish ectopic automaticity (ID50 was 0.17 microM for d-propranolol and 0.96 microM for 1-propranolol) in the rat heart. We conclude that the membrane stabilizing activity, which is present functionally in both stereoisomers, plays a significant role in the effect of these drugs on cardiac automaticity. On the other hand, the property of competitive blocking of beta-adrenergic receptors, which mainly resides in the levoisomer of propranolol does not seem to be essential for this effect.", 
    "27": "The aziridinium derivative of the compound N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride (az-DSP4) depletes endogenous noradrenaline stores and exerts neurotoxic actions on noradrenergic neurons. These effects are persistent in the central nervous system and transient in the periphery. To determine if transmitter release plays a role in the noradrenaline depletion caused by az-DSP4, the action of the compound was studied in isolated and spontaneously beating rat atria. 1. az-DSP4 enhanced atrial beating rate when present in the incubation medium at concentrations ranging from 10(-7) M to 10(-4) M but at 10(-3) M decreased that rate below basal levels. 2. Preincubation of atria for 30 min with the noradrenaline uptake blocker desimipramine (DMI, 10(-6) M) or with the beta-blocker propranolol (10(-7) M), abolished the positive chronotropic action of az-DSP4. 3. The rate-accelerating effect of az-DSP4 could be prevented by pretreating the rats with reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p. 24 h) or enhanced by pargyline pretreatment (100 mg/kg i.p. 18 h). 4. az-DSP4 stimulated the spontaneous efflux of tritium from the isolated atria previously labeled with 3H-noradrenaline (4 X 10(-7) M), an increase that was mainly accounted for by DOPEG. 5. COMT and MAO activities in atria homogenates were inhibited by az-DSP4 in a concentration-dependent manner. However, MAO inhibition did not result in a change of the metabolic pattern as could be expected. 6. The results obtained indicate that az-DSP4 enhances the rate of spontaneous beating of isolated rat atria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "To study the transport system of propranolol (PL), a basic drug, in the blood-brain barrier, the uptake of PL into isolated bovine brain microvessels was investigated. The uptake of PL was a concentrative one via saturable process (Km = 42.5 microM) that was decreased by hypothermia (Q10 = 2.2), but not by metabolic inhibitors (2,4-dinitrophenol, KCN, ouabain). Although basic drugs such as quinidine and imipramine decreased both the initial rate of uptake and the steady-state cell-to-medium concentration ratio (C/M) of PL, acidic drugs (phenobarbital, salicylic acid) did not affect them. These results suggest that PL is taken up by the endothelial cells of the isolated brain microvessels by facilitated diffusion which is specific for basic drugs and then binds to certain binding sites in the cells.", 
    "29": "The effect of chronic renal disease on the serum free fraction of phenytoin, diazepam and propranolol was examined in vitro among 60 conservatively treated patients with renal insufficiency of varying degree and different etiology, and in 10 patients with a nephrotic syndrome. The control group comprised 10 age and sex-matched healthy subjects. The free fractions were separated at 37 degrees C using a pressure ultrafiltration method. The highest free fractions of phenytoin and diazepam in uremic patients were 4 to 5-fold the normal. The free fractions were about twice the normal at a creatinine concentration of 800 mumol/l, and 2 to 4-fold at an urea concentration of 20-40 mmol/l. The creatinine and urea correlated with the free fractions of phenytoin and diazepam in a similar manner. The effect of a decreased serum albumin on the free fractions of these drugs was clear when its concentration was under 30 g/l. The creatinine and urea did not correlate with the free fraction of propranolol. However, after mathematically correcting the free fraction of propranolol to correspond to an alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) concentration of 0.9 g/l, it correlated significantly with creatinine and urea. The concentration of alpha 1-AGP was the most important determinant for the free fraction of propranolol. For practical purposes, the change in the free fractions of phenytoin and diazepam can be adequately predicted by the serum creatinine or urea and serum albumin levels. For propranolol the only parameter which needs to be analyzed is the serum alpha 1-AGP concentration.", 
    "30": "We have developed a new method for perfusing isolated and blood-perfused rabbit thoracic aortae by using conscious support rabbits. The vasoconstrictory and vasodilatory response to vasoactive substances were recorded as the decrease or the increase in intra-chamber pressure of the glass container in which the rabbit thoracic aorta was mounted. Examined were the vascular responses to dl-norepinephrine (NE) and l-isoproterenol (Iso) at different pressure loads to the vessel. NE produced a dose-dependent vasoconstriction which was effectively suppressed by i.v. phentolamine (3 mg/kg). In contrast, Iso produced beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilations in a dose-dependent manner (dl-propranolol, 0.5 mg/kg, i.v.). The present experiments were performed at different pressure loads (pressure changes both in the vessel-mounted chamber and a Starling pneumatic resistance set connected in the way of a series circuit). Our newly developed system for perfusion of isolated vascular vessels with conscious support rabbits has some advantages over the existing methods for analysing vascular reactivity in terms of being perfused with arterial blood, having a simulated peripheral resistance apparatus in the circuit and showing a distinct vasodilatory response to i.a. Iso.", 
    "31": "Abrupt reduction in aortic blood pressure by haemorrhage in the anaesthetized dog has previously been used to assess the effect of elastic recoil and myogenic properties of the coronary vascular wall on diastolic coronary resistance. Using such assessments this study examines whether beta-blockade influences the magnitude of the effect of the vessel wall on coronary resistance. In two groups of dogs abrupt reduction in aortic blood pressure caused by haemorrhage resulted in an initial increase in diastolic coronary resistance, followed by its decline to the control value. In the first group with intact vagi, beta-blockade resulted in a greater initial increase in resistance and attenuation of its subsequent decline. Vagotomy in the second group did not abolish the effect of beta-blockade on diastolic coronary resistance. The findings suggest that during abrupt reduction in perfusion pressure, beta-blockade and reduction in heart rate and coronary blood flow resulted in a greater elastic recoil of the coronary vascular wall associated with an initial increase in diastolic coronary resistance and attenuation of myogenic properties related to return of diastolic coronary resistance to the control level.", 
    "32": "The effect and safety of propranolol (Inderal-LA) in 95 patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease was studied in a double-blind placebo controlled trial. Over a 12-month period, three patients in the propranolol group died compared with eight in the control population. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in the placebo group only. Twenty-five patients were withdrawn, 12 in the propranolol and 13 in the placebo group. No deterioration in clinical condition or liver function tests was observed in the propranolol-treated patients, although serum testosterone levels fell significantly compared with the control patients. This study shows that long-term treatment with propranolol is safe in patients with chronic liver disease but further studies are required to define whether or not patients will benefit. Our observations on the response to placebo suggest that a significant proportion of patients are not likely to tolerate drug treatment for portal hypertension well.", 
    "33": "The authors studied the glycemic disturbances provoked by two antihypertensive drugs, propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide, administered alone or in combination to normal and diabetic rats, using biochemical and ultrastructural parameters. It was found that hydrochlorothiazide raised fasting glucose concentration significantly; propranolol alone caused an insignificant rise of glucose, but significantly aggravated the effect of hydrochlorothiazide with an additive interaction. The ultrastructural findings, as well as the urinary C-peptide excretion, confirmed that the glycemic effects should not be thought to be due to a direct action of the drugs used on the endocrine pancreas.", 
    "34": "The ocular and systemic disposition of levobunolol (LBUN), an antiglaucoma agent, was studied in albino rabbits. After topical administration to eyes, LBUN was rapidly adsorbed, with 2.5% of the dose bioavailable to the intraocular tissues as intact drug and 46% to the systemic circulation. On passage across the cornea, approximately 4.7% of a topically applied LBUN dose was biotransformed to dihydrolevobunolol (DHB), and subsequently became bioavailable to intraocular tissues. The major sites of ocular metabolism were the cornea epithelium and the iris-ciliary body. Another 12% of the topical LBUN dose entered the systemic circulation as DHB after presystemic biotransformation. Our study indicated a rapid absorption of LBUN into the aqueous humor after topical dosing. The tpeak was 15 min after dosing and the Cmax was 4 micrograms/mL. Dihydrolevobunolol (DHB) was formed steadily and reached a maximum in the aqueous humor 45 min after dosing. After distribution equilibrium had been reached, the aqueous humor concentrations of both LBUN and DHB declined. Six hours after dosing, the concentration of DHB in the aqueous humor was approximately 10 times higher than that of its parent compound. Because DHB is equivalent to its parent compound in beta-blocking activity, its formation in the rabbit eye may contribute to the pharmacodynamic effects observed after topical doses of LBUN.",

Drug and internal standard were isolated by adsorption with active charcoal. Chromatography was performed on RP-18 column (10 mu) with mobile phase of 0.015 mol/l KH2PO4/acetonitrile 70:30. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 1.5 ml/min. UV detector operated at the wave length of 225 nm. The sensitivity of the method was 25 micrograms/l and variation coefficients within the assay were less than 10% in the therapeutic concentration range. Biological half-life was on the average 3.8 h, absorption half-life 0.8 h, and the peak concentration time 2.5 h. Both preparations have been found bioequivalent.", 
    "36": "Single and combined therapy with terbutaline (10 mg/day) and metoprolol (200 mg/day) was assessed over 8 weeks in a double-blind parallel study in a total of 36 patients with essential hypertension grade I-II according to WHO criteria at rest and during exercise. Blood pressure was comparably reduced with metoprolol and terbutaline (I) and metoprolol alone (II) at rest as well as during exercise. Under terbutaline (III), only diastolic blood pressure decreased during exercise. The responder rates (greater than or equal to 10% reduction in diastolic blood pressure) at rest were 58% in I, 63% in II and significantly lower in III at 42%. Heart rate was not affected in I and III but decreased significantly with metoprolol. While therapy with metoprolol resulted in an increase of noradrenaline and a fall of plasma renin activity after 8 weeks, these parameters remained unchanged in I and III. Therapy was well tolerated in all groups. Terbutaline in the chosen dosage slightly decreased diastolic blood pressure and did not increase heart rate. Metoprolol is an effective antihypertensive agent resulting in a heart rate decrease. Under combined therapy, there is no additional blood pressure decrease, but the heart rate remains unaffected.",

    "38": "The effect of a newly developed ophthalmic solution containing both 0.5% timolol and 2% resp. 4% pilocarpine was compared with that of timolol 0.5% eye drops alone in 93 patients with manifest simple or capsular glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The medications were administered twice daily. The absolute additive effect of pilocarpine was small, although the combined solutions caused a statistically significantly greater reduction of the intraocular pressure than that achieved by timolol alone. This additional effect appeared to last at least 12 h. The effect of the test solutions containing 2% resp. 4% pilocarpine was very similar. Apart from the well-known effects of the pilocarpine-induced miosis, the combined test medications were generally well tolerated.", 
    "39": "Monitoring interim accumulating data in a clinical trial for evidence of therapeutic benefit or toxicity is a frequent policy, usually carried out by an independent scientific committee. Repeated testing at conventional critical values can substantially inflate the type I error rate. To maintain acceptable levels, group sequential and stochastic curtailment have been developed for clinical trials. One should not view such methods as absolute rules, but as useful guides. The decision process to terminate a trial early is complex and necessitates an accounting for many factors. The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial provides an excellent example of many of these issues.",

Forty-nine patients aged 65-80 years, whose Phase V diastolic blood pressure (dBP) was above 95 mmHg after 4 weeks open treatment with metoprolol 50 mg twice daily were randomized to receive, double-blind, the calcium antagonist felodipine (n = 32) 2.5 mg twice daily or placebo (n = 17) in addition to metoprolol for 2 weeks. If the dBP remained greater than 95 mmHg, the dose of felodipine or placebo was doubled for a further 2 weeks; if the dBP was still greater than 95 mmHg, the dose of felodipine was doubled again to 10 mg twice daily or the corresponding placebo dose given. The duration of the double-blind period was 6 weeks, all patients receiving metoprolol 50 mg twice daily throughout. 2. At the end of the double-blind period, the seated dBP was reduced from 103 +/- 5 (mean +/- s.d.) to 88 +/- 7 mmHg (P less than 0.001) by felodipine and from 105 +/- 100 +/- 11 mmHg (NS) by placebo. The differences between these reductions (P less than 0.01) and between the final dBPs (P less than 0.001) were significant. Eighty-nine per cent of patients receiving felodipine and 33% of those receiving placebo (P less than 0.001) had controlled (dBP less than or equal to 95 mmHg) BPs. Half (14/27 completing) of the patients receiving felodipine required 2.5 mg throughout; 9/27 needed 5 mg and 4/27 10 mg twice daily. Adverse events occurred with equal frequency in the two groups, but the profile was different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Pancreatic islets containing more than 90% beta cells from obese-hyperglycaemic (ob/ob) mice were cultured for 3 days in different concentrations of Ca2+ and glucose to evaluate the importance of intracellular Ca2+ sequestration in glucose-induced insulin release. The islet contents of calcium (total and exchangeable) and immunoreactive insulin were compared with the insulin secretory response to glucose after culture. The turnover of Ca2+ increased with increasing concentrations of glucose and Ca2+. Islets cultured in the presence of 5.5 mmol glucose/l contained more calcium and insulin than those cultured with 1 or 20 mmol glucose/l. During culture in 20 mmol glucose/l, a lowering of the Ca2+ concentration of the medium from 0.42 to 0.025 mmol/l resulted in a paradoxical increase in intracellular calcium, with improvement of the subsequent secretory response to the sugar. When the islets had been exposed to the calcium channel blocker D-600 during culture in a Ca2+-deficient medium, substantial insulin release was noted from islets containing relatively small amounts of calcium. The results suggest that the well-established role of glucose in maintaining insulin release is associated with an ability of the sugar to stimulate the retention of calcium in beta cells.", 
    "42": "Calcium channel blockers are now widely used and there have been case reports of hyperglycemia with nifedipine. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of the effects of 4 weeks of therapy, each with two dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker drugs, nifedipine and nicardipine, glucose tolerance, plasma insulin levels, and hemoglobin A1 were assessed in 20 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes (mean age 59 years). There was no significant difference in glucose tolerance on active therapy (AUC: control, 548.3 +/- 24.8; nifedipine, 559.3 +/- 41.0; and nicardipine, 589.3 +/- 40.3). Similarly, despite producing significant hemodynamic effects, these drugs produced no significant effect on plasma insulin and hemoglobin A1 levels. Calcium channel blocker drugs may be useful alternatives to thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers in the treatment of ischemic heart disease and hypertension, especially in patients with diabetes.", 
    "43": "A 51-yr-old nonsmoking male patient without any history of previous allergies, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria developed attacks of asthma when captopril was added to the nadolol and dyazide treatment for his high blood pressure. A double-blind challenge with nadolol and captopril decreased FEV1 by 3 and 12%, respectively. This confirmed the history of captopril-related asthma. As angiotensin-converting enzyme seems to play a role in the genesis and metabolism of bronchomotor mediators, this rare form of drug-induced asthma is important for both clinicians and airways pharmacologists.", 
    "44": "Hemodynamic responses and exercise capacity were studied during maximal exercise in 25 young hypertensive persons (mean age 40 years) taking placebo, diltiazem (mean 216 mg/day) and atenolol (mean 80 mg/day). The study was a crossover, double-blind, randomized trial, each medication period lasting 2 months. Sitting blood pressure (BP) was 160 +/- 19/109 +/- 8 mm Hg after run-in. Both drugs decreased BP significantly, diltiazem by 10/ 11 mm Hg and atenolol by 16/14 mm Hg (difference not significant between drugs). During exercise there were no differences among patients taking placebo, diltiazem and atenolol in peak workload and rating of perceived exertion. Atenolol significantly attenuated the increase in heart rate, BP and heart rate-BP product at each workload. Diastolic BP during exercise was significantly lower (6 to 10 mm Hg) during diltiazem therapy than during placebo at each workload. Thus, both diltiazem and atenolol decrease rest BP significantly without impairing exercise capacity.", 
    "45": "The main threat to patients with mild to moderate hypertension is coronary heart disease (CHD), but controlled trials of antihypertensive drug therapy have given disappointing results: overall, the reduction in CHD mortality (11%) and morbidity (10%) were small and nonsignificant. Recent trials comparing a beta blocker with other antihypertensive drugs have not shown the \"cardioprotection\" expected from their pharmacologic actions and from their effectiveness after myocardial infarction; but two large trials have suggested some reduction in CHD among male nonsmokers. Relaxation with biofeedback possibly lowers CHD risk. Although the trials indicate that drugs generally do little to reduce CHD in hypertensive patients, control of smoking and serum cholesterol may be more effective.", 
    "46": "In order to evaluate the long-term effects of propranolol and acebutolol on serum lipoprotein lipids, a double-blind clinical trial was carried out. Fifteen patients with stable angina pectoris, aged 32 to 79 years (mean = 53), were randomized to propranolol (80 to 160 mg/day) or acebutolol (400 mg/day) treatment groups, and followed for approximately 1 year (mean = 371 days). Blood was collected on the day treatment was begun, after approximately 5 months (mean = 158 days), and on completion of the trial. Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) (alpha less than 1.006), low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (1.006 to 1.063), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (1.063 to 1.125 [HDL2] and 1.125 to 1.21 [HDL3]) were isolated by sequential preparative ultracentrifugation, and their cholesterol and triglyceride quantified by enzymic procedures. After 1 year propranolol had raised the mean VLDL triglyceride concentration by 79% (p less than 0.005) and had lowered total HDL cholesterol by 24% (p less than 0.005). As LDL cholesterol was unchanged, the LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio was increased by 26% (p less than 0.005). Mean values at 5 months were intermediate between those at baseline and those at 1 year. In contrast to these changes, acebutolol had no significant effect on any measured lipoprotein lipid.", 
    "47": "In 727 patients with acute myocardial infarction, different enzyme variables reflecting infarct size were related to the 5-year mortality rate. The maximum activity of serum heat-stable lactate dehydrogenase (LD), analyzed every 12 hours for 48 to 108 hours, was significantly associated with the 5-year mortality rate when patients with a first myocardial infarction were evaluated (p less than 0.001), and similarly (p less than 0.001) when patients with a previous myocardial infarction were included in the analyses. Very similar results were found when the maximum activity of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) analyzed once daily for 3 days was related to the mortality rate over 5 years, whereas the maximum activity of creatine kinase (CK) and CK subunit B analyzed every 6 hours for 48 hours in a subset of patients did not predict the outcome to the same extent. The results from LD and ASAT analyses clearly indicated that the association between infarct size and 5-year mortality rate was caused by the much higher mortality rate in patients with larger infarcts during the first year after onset of infarction, whereas after the first year, incidence of death appeared to be independent of the original infarct size. Thus we conclude that although a highly significant relationship between infarct size and overall 5-year survival was found, the mortality rate seemed to be higher in patients with larger infarcts, particularly during the first year after infarction.", 
    "48": "The effects of captopril, methyldopa, and propranolol were assessed for sense of well-being and vitality among 626 men with mild to moderate hypertension in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. After a 24-week treatment period, patients taking captopril, compared with patients taking methyldopa and propranolol, scored significantly higher on measures of well-being and vitality. In addition, patients on captopril had more favorable results in being able to keep up with their work and in not feeling tired or sleepy at work. The effects of each of the drugs manifested themselves at different periods. For example, the negative effects of methyldopa on vitality were evident by week 8, whereas the negative effects did not become manifest for propranolol until week 24. On the other hand, a steady progressive improvement in vitality scores was evident at week 8 and at week 24 for patients on captopril. The findings of the study also suggest that the effects of the treatment drugs were most marked in patients who had had previous antihypertensive medications and who were on single-drug therapy during the course of the clinical trial. Further, the differences between patients taking captopril and those on methyldopa and propranolol appear to be obscured by the addition of a diuretic. The findings of the study may guide the physician in orienting his or her patient and in planning and implementing a therapeutic regimen.", 
    "49": "We conducted a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blind trial of propranolol as compared with placebo in the prevention of first upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. A total of 230 patients (90 percent with alcoholism and 46 percent with a Child-Pugh grade C classification) with large esophageal varices without previous bleeding were randomly assigned to receive either propranolol (n = 118) or placebo (n = 112), after they had been divided into two groups according to the severity of their liver disease. The end points of the study were bleeding and death. The dose of propranolol was progressively increased to decrease the heart rate by 20 to 25 percent. The final doses were 40 mg of conventional propranolol and 160 and 320 mg of long-acting propranolol daily in 22 percent, 60 percent, and 18 percent of patients, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) follow-up time among survivors without bleeding was 436 +/- 172 days. The cumulative percentages of patients free of bleeding two years after inclusion in the study were 74 percent (95 percent confidence limits, 61 and 83) in the propranolol group and 39 percent (95 percent confidence limits, 15 and 69) in the placebo group (P less than 0.05). Cumulative two-year survival was 72 percent (95 percent confidence limits, 60 and 81) in the propranolol group and 51 percent (95 percent confidence limits, 37 and 64) in the placebo group (P less than 0.05). The advantage of propranolol over placebo was maintained when potentially confounding variables were adjusted with use of the Cox model. Side effects occurred in 17 percent of the patients who received propranolol and led to the stopping of treatment in 11 percent. We conclude that propranolol can decrease the incidence of first bleeding and death during a period of two years in patients with cirrhosis and large varices.", 
    "50": "While maintaining the arterial CO2 tension constant near the normal level of the dog (4.3 kPa), we studied the influence of decreasing cardiac output on both the arterial and mixed-venous blood acid-base status in anaesthetized, artificially ventilated dogs. Cardiac output was manipulated by applying positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and by beta-adrenergic blockade to suppress a compensatory heart rate response. The systemic vascular response was attenuated by alpha-adrenergic blockade. Metabolic rate remained virtually unchanged when cardiac output decreased. Under these conditions a fall in cardiac output led to a shift of the arterial acid-base status in the direction of a metabolic acidosis. The changes occurring in the mixed-venous blood resembled those of an in-vivo CO2 bufferline, with the shift being such as if a respiratory acidosis was developing.", 
    "51": "The cost effectiveness of labetalol and propranolol in the treatment of black adults with mild to moderate hypertension was assessed using published reports from US clinical trials of these agents among such patients. Data from these studies suggest that labetalol and propranolol lower diastolic blood pressure among black hypertensive adults by 11.2 mmHg and 8.4 mmHg, respectively. Results indicate that, for a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients on monotherapy, patients treated with labetalol would experience two to seven fewer strokes over a ten-year period, depending upon age and sex, and annual drug costs would be reduced by $190. For stepped care, annual costs would be $205 and $212 lower for those treated initially with labetalol. Labetalol therefore may be more cost effective than propranolol among black adults with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "52": "Three metoprolol metabolites containing an alpha-hydroxy group were identified in human urine by capillary column gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. After aqueous phase cyclization with phosgene the neutral or acidic derivatives formed were isolated by solvent extraction at pH 10 or 3, respectively. Following silylation the electron impact mass spectra of the metabolites exhibited a characteristic ion at m/z 336 of high abundance which originated from cleavage of the bond adjacent to the alpha-OTMS group. Most probably the identified compounds were formed by further biotransformations of alpha-hydroxy metoprolol, which is a primary metabolite. The analytical method is applicable to detect the metoprolol metabolites reported so far. A quantitative assay for one of the metabolites (H 119/72) with nitrogen selective detection is described. The total amount of this metabolite excreted by one subject within 24 h after dosing was about 0.25% of the given dose.", 
    "53": "1. The inadvertent administration of timolol to asthmatic patients continues to cause occasional severe and even fatal attacks of asthma. The (R)-enantiomer of timolol, L-714,465, is four times less potent than timolol in reducing intraocular pressure in man. It is 49 times less potent than timolol on beta 2-adrenoceptors in animals and 13 times less potent on the airways of normal subjects. These findings suggested that L-714,465 might be a safer alternative for the treatment of glaucoma. 2. Ten subjects with mild asthma who bronchoconstricted to timolol eye drops (0.25 or 0.5%) were studied. Airway dose-response curves to timolol (0-2%), L-714,465 (0-4%), and placebo (methyl cellulose) eye drops were performed in a double-blind randomised study in which airway response was measured as change in FEV1 and specific airway conductance (sGaw). 3. L-714,465 and timolol caused dose dependent falls in sGaw and FEV1 with L-714,465 being approximately four times less potent than timolol. The geometric mean dose ratio was 3.89 for FEV1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-8.7) and 3.93 (95% CI 2-7.8) for sGaw. Since the difference in potency is similar to the reported difference in potency of the two drugs on intraocular pressure we conclude that L-714,465 would not have a greater safety margin than timolol. 4. After completion of the dose-response study eight subjects inhaled ipratropium bromide (72 micrograms) and this caused an increase in FEV1 from 74% to 80% of baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The 24 h mortality was greater when pindolol was administered at 00.00 h than when it was administered at 12.00 h in both SHR and WKY. 3. The chronogram of the mortality in SHR was similar to that in WKY. 4.

    "55": "Exposure of rats to an environment of +40 degrees C that increases central (rectal) temperature to about 40 degrees C, importantly decrease the number of thrombocytes, the blood coagulation (the Quick time and Howel time) and euglobulin lysis time (ELT). In order to search for the mechanism responsible for coagulability and fibrinolysis we studied the relations of these changes with the sympatheticoadrenergic system and with the adrenal hormonal secretion. Some parameters were thus explored after adrenalectomy and under the influence of a beta-blocking agent, Eraldin. Adrenalectomy moderately reduced these decreasing effects, excepting the ELT. Eraldin has a contrary effect. Adrenalectomy acts by suppressing the corticoid reaction and by diminishing the catecholamineones. Since Eraldin influences coagulation and fibrinolysis in an opposite sense than adrenalectomy, it may be concluded that catecholamines do moderate the effect of heating, inhibiting and not stimulating circulation, as assumed. On the contrary, corticoids (gluco- or mineralo-) contribute to the effect, influencing coagulation in hyperthermia. Both influences are slight, not determinant. Supplementary explorations revealed that repeated daily exposure for 1-2 or 3 weeks, simply in the cages in which hyperthermia was subsequently produced, decreased also the number of thrombocites, the QT and the ELT, especially the last one. The HT was less influenced. It results that these exposures, produced effects similar with hyperthermia. Heating rats after these daily repeated exposures does not influence these already changed parameters.", 
    "56": "Inhibition of total 125I-ICYP binding to intact human mononuclear leucocytes at 32 degrees by propranolol and (+/-) CGP-12177 was biphasic. The high affinity component of 125I-ICYP binding, representing approximately 30% of total, was stereospecific, while the low affinity binding site was inhibited without stereospecificity. (-) Isoproterenol inhibited the high affinity component of 125I-ICYP binding only, with low affinity. By performing binding studies in intact cells at 4 degrees or in broken cell preparations at 37 degrees, the fraction of total 125I-ICYP binding representing specific binding was increased, and agonist affinity was high. Inhibition of 3H-CGP-12177 binding to intact cells at 32 degrees demonstrated a high fraction of specific binding and high agonist affinity. Computer-assisted analysis of total radioligand binding determined over a broad concentration range revealed two populations of saturable 125I-ICYP binding sites in intact cells as well as in broken cell preparations, while 3H-CGP-12177 binding demonstrated only one saturable binding site. The number of high affinity 125I-ICYP binding sites was comparable to the number of saturable 3H-CGP-12177 binding sites. Receptor numbers determined by analysis of total radioligand binding were comparable to receptor numbers determined by subtraction of non-specific binding, determined in the presence of a high concentration of competing ligand. Analysis of total radioligand binding was found to be a better procedure because it eliminates the use of an arbitrary concentration of unlabelled ligand and improves the accuracy of the assay.", 
    "57": "Lung function was studied double blind and randomized in 5 patients with mild asthma bronchiale and 10 normal adults before and 30, 60 and 90 minutes after one drop of 0.5% Timolol, 0.6% Metipranolol or 0.9% NaCl in each eye. In the asthmatics bronchoconstriction was seen after both beta-receptor blocking agents, more pronounced after Timolol than after Metipranolol. There was a decrease in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1.0) of 32, respectively 18%. No changes were observed in the normal subjects. In a separate study no significant changes were seen in the mean values of 10 other asthmatic subjects after 1% Pindolol, 3% Pilocarpin or 0.9% NaCl. However, in two patients FEV1.0 was reduced by 15% and 20% of the control values after applying Pindolol. In summary, not only beta-receptor-blocking agents without ISA produce a bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects, but also beta-blocker with ISA in individual cases.", 
    "58": "The present study was carried out to elucidate the role of epinephrine as a neuromodulator in hypertension. The effects of epinephrine on norepinephrine release from the sympathetic nerve endings were examined in isolated perfused mesenteric arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Norepinephrine overflow during electrical nerve stimulation (5, 15 Hz) was significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. Low concentration of exogenous epinephrine (5.5 X 10(-9) M) potentiated norepinephrine overflow during nerve stimulation in SHR, and this (at 15 Hz stimulation) was antagonized by propranolol (5.0 x 10(-7) M), whereas, the overflow in WKY was reduced by the same concentration of epinephrine. A higher concentration of epinephrine (1.4 x 10(-8) M) decreased norepinephrine overflow in both SHR and WKY, and this change (at 15 Hz stimulation) was antagonized by yohimbine (1.0 x 10(-7) M). Further, magnitudes of the suppressions were smaller in SHR than in WKY. These results suggest that altered modulations of norepinephrine release by epinephrine through presynaptic beta- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors might induce increased sympathetic nerve activity in SHR.", 
    "59": "To establish the criteria for the selection of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (beta-blockers) suitable for the long-term treatment of tremor, 20 patients with essential tremor were treated with five different types of beta-blockers. All beta-blockers were effective for essential tremor, but their efficacy differed. The weaker the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) and the more marked the membrane stabilizing activity (MSA), the more marked was the anti-tremor effect. Propranolol, which showed the strongest anti-tremor effect, had no ISA, but its long-term administration induced symptoms of heart failure, such as pretibial oedema, in most cases. In most of these cases, when propranolol was replaced by indenolol, which showed a very slight ISA, the pretibial oedema subsided and well-controlled tremor was maintained over a long period. With regard to efficacy and usefulness, it was thought that the beta-blockers with a very slight ISA and a marked MSA, such as indenolol, was most suitable for the long-term treatment of essential tremor.", 
    "60": "Men aged 40-64 years with mild to moderate hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 100-130 mmHg] were randomized to treatment with a diuretic (n = 3272) or a beta-blocker (n = 3297), with additional drugs if necessary, to determine whether a beta-blocker based treatment differs from thiazide diuretic based treatment with regard to the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) events and death. Patients with previous CHD, stroke or other serious diseases, or with contraindications to diuretics or beta-blockers were excluded. If normotension (DBP less than 95 mmHg) was not achieved by monotherapy, other antihypertensive drugs were added, but the two basic drugs were not crossed over. Patients were assessed at 6-monthly intervals. The mean follow-up for end-points was 45.1 months. Blood pressure (BP) side effects and end-points were recorded in a standardized manner. Entry characteristics and the BP reduction achieved were very similar in both treatment groups. All analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis. The incidence of CHD did not differ between the two treatment groups. The incidence of fatal stroke tended to be lower in the beta-blocker treated group than in the diuretic treated group. Total mortality and the total number of end-points were similar in both groups. The percentage of patients withdrawn due to side effects was similar, whereas the number of reported symptoms, according to a questionnaire, was higher for patients on beta-blockers. The incidence of diabetes did not differ between the two groups. Subgroup analyses did not detect a difference in the effect of beta-blockers compared with diuretics in smokers as opposed to non-smokers, and beta-blockers also had the same effects as diuretics in the quartile with the highest predicted risk for CHD. Beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics were approximately equally well tolerated. The two drugs had a similar BP reducing effect although additional drugs had to be given more often in the diuretic group. Antihypertensive treatment based on a beta-blocker or on a thiazide diuretic could not be shown to affect the prevention of hypertensive complications, including CHD, to a different extent.", 
    "61": "The effects of prazosin and beta-blocker monotherapy on serum concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol, and lipoprotein cholesterol were evaluated in 16 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension in a single-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study. Initially patients received a bid dose of either prazosin or a beta-blocker sufficient to maintain a sitting diastolic pressure below 95 mm Hg. After a placebo washout, patients were placed on the alternate medication. Fasting serum samples were obtained for lipid analysis during each treatment phase. Beta-blocker therapy was associated with undesirable changes in serum lipids as evidenced by increases in the concentration of total triglyceride (45%, P = .001), total cholesterol (4%, P = .05), LDL cholesterol (6%, P = .05) and VLDL cholesterol (21%, P = .05), and a decrease in the concentration of HDL cholesterol (-9%, P = .05). The ratios of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol also increased by 15% (P = .005) and 18% (P = .005), respectively. No significant changes in any of the serum lipids were observed during prazosin administration.", 
    "62": "The antihypertensive efficacy of a single daily dose of bevantolol (200 mg) alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) has been compared against conventional twice daily propranolol (80 mg) therapy in a group of 22 hypertensive patients whose blood pressures did not respond to thiazide monotherapy. Addition of bevantolol to the diuretic resulted in a significant (P less than 0.001) fall in sitting blood pressures (144/97 to 137/90 mmHg), supine blood pressures (147/100 to 141/92 mmHg) and heart rate (83 to 73 beats/min) 24 h after administration. When the diuretic was withdrawn, heart rate and diastolic pressures remained unchanged and within normotensive limits but systolic pressures increased to pre-treatment levels. Substitution of propranolol for bevantolol gave results comparable to the combined bevantolol-diuretic regimen except that heart rate was still lower (66 beats/min). No significant adverse reactions were reported. In thiazide-resistant hypertensives, a once daily dose of 200 mg bevantolol effectively reduced diastolic blood pressures towards normotensive limits and to an extent comparable with twice daily propranolol therapy.", 
    "63": "The pharmacological properties of a novel vasodilator/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, SK & F 95018 6-[4-[3-(3-[4-(2-Cyclopropylmethoxyethyl)phenoxy]-2- hydroxypropylamino)propionamido]phenyl]-4,5-dihydro-5-met hylpyridazin- 3(2H)-one methanesulphonate] are described. SK & F 95018 lowered blood pressure and increased hindquarters blood flow in anaesthetised rats over the same dose range 1-5 mumol kg-1. Over a similar dose range SK & F 95018 inhibited isoprenaline-induced tachycardia in ganglion-blocked, anaesthetized cats. SK & F 95018 had minimal effect on bronchial beta 2-adrenoceptors, while simultaneously antagonizing cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors in anaesthetized guinea-pigs. SK & F 95018 was demonstrated to be a potent antihypertensive agent in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats over the dose range of 1.6-13 mumol kg-1 i.v. and 13-103 mumol kg-1 p.o. A marked and persistent hypotension was observed in conscious cats at a dose of 7.5 mumol kg-1 i.v. and 19 mumol kg-1 p.o., without reflex tachycardia. In anaesthetized cats, the hypotensive response to the compound was found to be via a reduction in total peripheral resistance with a maintained cardiac output. Vasodilatation and beta-adrenoceptor antagonism have been demonstrated in the same molecule (SK & F 95018) in a combination which would be suitable for effective treatment of hypertension.", 
    "64": "Nd: YAG laser capsulotomy is a well-established method of opening an opacified posterior lens capsule after extracapsular cataract extraction. The most frequent complication following this procedure is a transient rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) occurring during the first few hours following treatment. In most cases the IOP returns to normal within 24 hours. Occasionally, however, it can increase excessively, causing a vision-threatening complication. The prospective study reported here dealt with the pressure elevation in 60 eyes of 60 patients and the characteristics of aqueous outflow in this critical phase. Tonometric and tonographic findings were compared under the influence of topical indometacin and beta-blocker in combination with pilocarpine 2%. Twenty eyes served as untreated controls. Topical indometacin pretreatment had no positive effect on IOP and aqueous outflow, while beta-blocker and pilocarpine 2% prevented a postoperative elevation of IOP.", 
    "65": "The effect of repeated administration of desipramine, and the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of oxaprotiline (10 mg/kg i.p., twice daily for 14 days) on the binding of beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the cortex of the rat brain were studied. The functional consequences of such treatment were measured in a behavioural model, involving the exploratory activity of rats in response to administration of the alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine. Desipramine and (+)-oxaprotiline decreased the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) to beta-adrenoceptors in the cortex, did not change the binding of [3H]prazosin to alpha 1-adrenoceptors, but enhanced behavioural responses to phenylephrine. A behavioural facilitation was also observed after administration of (-)-oxaprotiline, a substance which does not change the binding of [3H]DHA. These results indicate that a functional supersensitivity to the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, after repeated treatment with antidepressants is not conditioned by beta-down-regulation.", 
    "66": "This study was designed to examine the contribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors in modulating coronary blood flow and cardiac function in exercising dogs. Dogs were chronically instrumented to measure left circumflex flow velocity (CFV), heart rate, regional left ventricular function [systolic shortening, (%S) and maximum velocity of shortening (dL/dt(s)max)], and global left ventricular function [left ventricular pressure (LVP and dP/dtmax)]. Exercise significantly increased LVP (31 +/- 4%), dP/dtmax (130 +/- 17%), heart rate (116 +/- 20%), %S (28 +/- 6%), dL/dt(s)max (89 +/- 23%), and CFV (91 +/- 25%). Regional injection of the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol (1.0 mg) into the circumflex artery during exercise was associated with decreases in LVP (-8 +/- 3%), dP/dtmax (-17 +/- 3%), %S (-15 +/- 4), dL/dt(s)max (-13 +/- 4%), and CFV (-22 +/- 4%). Selective beta 1-receptor blockade with atenolol (1.0 mg, i.c.) was associated with similar decreases in LVP (-7 +/- 3%), dP/dtmax (-33 +/- 4%), %S (-12 +/- 3%), dL/dt(s)max (-17 +/- 2%), and CFV (-18 +/- 3%) during exercise. In contrast, selective beta 2-receptor blockade with ICI 118551 (250 micrograms, i.c.) produced significant decreases in only CFV (-11 +/- 2%) during exercise. Thus, the data suggest that the reductions in myocardial contractile function and flow after regional beta-blockade are primarily due to a decrease in myocardial beta 1-receptor stimulation. In addition, there apparently is a small involvement of either coronary vascular or pre-synaptic beta 2-receptors in mediating the coronary vascular flow response during exercise.", 
    "67": "The effects of long-term (6 months) antihypertensive treatment with three different types of beta-blockers (propranolol, nonselective without ISA; pindolol, nonselective with ISA; metoprolol, beta 1-selective without ISA) on submaximal exercise capacity and metabolic variables during submaximal endurance exercise were studied in seven subjects with essential hypertension. Exercise tests were performed on a bicycle ergometer at 70% of estimated VO2 max. Similar reductions of resting and exercise blood pressure and exercise heart rate were obtained with the three beta-blockers. Exercise time was significantly reduced by all three beta-blockers during chronic antihypertensive therapy. The reduction tended to be more pronounced after 5-6 months of treatment than after 1 week (P = 0.06). During exercise, the plasma glycerol and nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were reduced. Plasma glucose concentration was reduced at the end of the exercise test during propranolol treatment only. Plasma lactate concentrations tended to be increased, but the difference was significant during pindolol treatment only. Oxygen uptake tended to decrease and respiratory exchange ratio to increase. Plasma potassium concentrations during exercise were significantly increased with all three beta-blockers. The effects on the metabolic variables during exercise were similar after 1 week and during long-term (20/24 weeks) beta-blocker treatment. The study shows that submaximal endurance exercise capacity is impaired in patients with essential hypertension on beta-blocker therapy and that the impairment is maintained during long-term antihypertensive beta-blocker treatment.", 
    "68": "The Lopressor Intervention Trial (LIT) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre study designed to evaluate the effect of oral metoprolol on overall mortality in patients surviving a recent acute myocardial infarction. Patient enrollment began in August 1979 and ended on 15 April 1982, with 2395 patients (1200 on placebo and 1195 on metoprolol). Hospitalized patients, 45 to 74 years of age, began therapy from 6 to 16 days after their myocardial infarction. Following a short titration period, maintenance therapy with metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. or placebo was continued for up to 1 year. Enrollment was prematurely terminated because of a progressive and marked decline in patient accession; it was not feasible to reach the original goal of 3200 patients in a practical period of time. This target sample size was based on an anticipated 1 year placebo mortality rate of 10%, a 50% reduction in total mortality with metoprolol and premature discontinuation of study medication in no more than 15% of patients in the metoprolol group. Two primary analyses were planned: total mortality among all randomized patients at 7 and at 12 months of trial entry. After 7 months of treatment there were 54 deaths in the placebo group and 42 deaths in the metoprolol group. After 1 year there were 62 deaths in the placebo group and 65 in the metoprolol group. Thus, the 1 year placebo mortality rate of 5.2% was half that predicted at the outset. In addition, study medication was prematurely discontinued in over 30% of patients in the metoprolol group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "In the last decade anxiety disorders have been the focus of intensive research in the psychiatric community, resulting in a rapid growth in our understanding of these illnesses. Diagnostic, biological, and psychopharmacological investigations have revealed important distinctions among these disorders which enable the clinician to make well-informed therapeutic choices and frequently ameliorate or even eliminate anxiety symptoms and related phobic behaviour. The principles of treatment can be simply stated: 1. Careful diagnostic evaluation through history and exclusion of medical and psychiatric conditions which mimic anxiety disorders. 2. Treatment selection based on diagnosis and formulation with the patient of the goals and expected outcome of pharmacotherapy. 3. Systematic application of each drug treatment in sufficient dosage and for an adequate duration permitting progression to the next agent when results are not optimal. 4. Addition of non-pharmacological interventions, usually behavioural therapy, to decrease phobic behaviour. 5. Development of a maintenance or discontinuation strategy tailored to the needs of the patient.", 
    "70": "Celiprolol is a new 'cardioselective' beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with intrinsic sympathomimetic (partial agonist) activity and a weak vasodilating effect. Celiprolol appears not to cause bronchoconstriction or inhibit the effect of bronchodilating drugs in asthmatic patients and there is some evidence that it may have mild bronchodilating activity in such patients. Some studies suggest that celiprolol, because of vasodilation, may be less likely to reduce blood flow to the peripheries than other beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and hence cause fewer peripheral vascular side effects. Significant inhibition of exercise tachycardia occurs 24 hours after a single oral dose of celiprolol. In preliminary therapeutic trials celiprolol 200 to 600mg once daily was similar in efficacy to propranolol 40mg to 80mg twice daily or atenolol 100mg once daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension or angina pectoris. If the apparent pharmacodynamic advantages of celiprolol are confirmed in well designed therapeutic trials then celiprolol should represent a definite advance in beta-adrenoceptor blocking therapy.", 
    "71": "The effects of phentolamine on coronary resistance and heart rate, as well as the influence of beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade on phentolamine effects were studied on the isolated cat hearts. Phentolamine reduced coronary resistance in 100% of cases (-25.9 +/- 4.4%; p less than 0.001) and increased heart rate only in 31.6% of cases (+9.1 +/- 1.4%); on average the alterations of heart rate were nonsignificant (p less than 0.1). After beta 1-blockade with Cordanum the rate of coronary dilation reduced (p less than 0.001), the changes in coronary resistance being nonsignificant (p greater than 0.1). Basal coronary resistance and tone during phentolamine infusion without or after beta 1-blockade were identical (p greater than 0.1). Thus, the reduction of coronary resistance during phentolamine infusion was due to beta 1-adrenomimetic activity of the drug.", 
    "72": "The beta-adrenergic antagonists, propranolol and bornaprolol (FM-24), at greater than 2 mg/kg (as [-] form) significantly depressed plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) in orchidectomized rats. This occurred in the absence of consistently significant changes in interpulse intervals or amplitudes of pulsatile LH release. Nadirs of plasma LH decreased significantly even at low blocker doses, with a clear dose dependence for both drugs. The highly significant decrease of plasma LH induced by blocker dosages causing greater than 93% inhibition of beta-adrenergic binding in the anterior pituitary gland was shown to occur without significant changes in binding of specific ligands at pituitary dopamine receptors and hypothalamic alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The above evidence indicates that beta-blockers may lower LH release in vivo at the level of pituitary beta-adrenergic receptors."
