The alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, rapidly stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in a dose-dependent manner with maximal stimulation observed at 10(-6) M. The stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by phenylephrine was mediated via alpha 1-receptors. Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase by catecholamines was mediated via beta-adrenergic receptors, since the beta-agonist, isoproterenol, and dibutyryl cAMP produced similar effects. Like insulin, alpha-adrenergic agonists increased the active form of pyruvate dehydrogenase without changing the total enzyme activity and cellular ATP concentration. The effects induced by maximally effective concentrations of insulin and alpha-adrenergic agonists were nonadditive. The ability of phenylephrine and methoxamine to stimulate pyruvate dehydrogenase and phosphorylase and to inhibit glycogen synthase was not affected by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. Similarly, the stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and glycogen synthase by insulin was also observed under the same conditions. However, when intracellular adipocyte Ca2+ was depleted by incubating cells in a Ca2+-free buffer containing 1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-amino-ethyl ether)-N,N,N' -tetraacetic acid, the actions of alpha-adrenergic agonists, but not insulin, on pyruvate dehydrogenase were completely abolished. Vasopressin and angiotensin II also stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase in a dose-dependent manner with enhancement of glucose oxidation and lipogenesis. Our results demonstrate that the Ca2+ -dependent hormones stimulate pyruvate dehydrogenase and lipogenesis in isolated rat adipocytes, and the action is dependent upon intracellular, but not extracellular, Ca2+.", 
    "1": "Methods for the determination of cardiovascular drugs in blood and plasma are critically reviewed with emphasis on gas and liquid chromatographic techniques. The importance of the various procedures is discussed, in particular sample work-up where the conditions for isolation and derivatization of the compounds are decisive for the accuracy and precision of the methods. Compared with other assay techniques chromatographic methods are generally to be preferred owing to their better selectivity. In the review the following groups are discussed: digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmic agents, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, vasodilating agents, antihypertensive compounds, and diuretics.", 
    "2": "Patients undergoing repair of coarctation of the aorta often have self-limited but severe hypertension in the first week after surgery (paradoxical hypertension). We conducted a controlled trial of treatment with propranolol before repair of coarctation of the aorta in 14 children to determine whether the drug would prevent paradoxical hypertension. Seven patients were randomly assigned to receive propranolol for two weeks before surgery and throughout the first postoperative week, and seven patients were assigned to receive standard postoperative care. Both groups had a similar significant (P less than 0.05) increase in the plasma norepinephrine level in response to surgery; however, when compared with no treatment, treatment with propranolol reduced not only the rise in systolic (P = 0.004) and diastolic (P = 0.003) blood pressure but also the postoperative increase in plasma renin activity (P less than 0.01). We conclude that prophylactic propranolol can prevent paradoxical hypertension and should therefore become a routine part of the operative care of patients with coarctation of the aorta.", 
    "3": "Canine cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors contain a free sulfhydryl group in the adrenergic ligand binding site. [125 I]-Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol [( 125 I]-IHYP) binding to cardiac beta-receptors was inhibited 80% by treatment with 1 mM p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (pCMB). Occupation of the beta-receptors by an antagonist prior to treatment with pCMB prevented this effect suggesting that a sulfhydryl group is present in or near the ligand binding site of the cardiac beta-receptor. In the presence of agonists, the sensitivity of cardiac beta-receptors to pCMB was increased. Incubation of isoproterenol-occupied cardiac beta-receptors, resulted in a 57% inhibition of [125 I]-IHYP binding measured after extensive washing to remove bound agonist. The ability of isoproterenol to increase the reactivity of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors supports the hypothesis that agonists produce a conformational change upon binding.", 
    "4": "We compared the effects of low and high doses of dopamine and dobutamine (a synthetic catecholamine) on blood flow in relaxed or exercising muscles. Experiments were performed on rabbits. Blood flow in the muscles (calf) was estimated with the clearance method of radionuclide 133Xe. Dopamine and dobutamine were infused (iv) in doses of 20 or 40 micrograms/kg/min. Dopamine reduced muscle blood flow in resting state; this effect was more pronounced after higher doses. Dobutamine increased the flow; low doses were less effective. Dopamine may be an important determinant of the distribution of cardiac output to various vascular regions.", 
    "5": "The hyperglycemic response of adult male Wistar rats given dieldrin (63 mg/kg, po) and either phenobarbital (40 mg/kg, ip), atropine (4 mg/kg, sc), L-alpha-methyldopa (200 mg/kg, ip), or DL-propranolol (8 mg/kg, sc) was studied. The hyperglycemia was maximal (73% above control values) 2 hr after exposure to dieldrin alone. Phenobarbital reduced the hyperglycemia by 41% and abolished dieldrin-induced convulsions. It also prevented the increases that dieldrin causes in hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity. These results suggest that the dieldrin-induced hyperglycemia is mediated via the CNS. Atropine prevented the hyperglycemia for 2 hr and delayed the attainment of maximal glucose concentrations for another 2 hr. However, additional atropine 4, 8, 12, and 18 hr after the dieldrin had no effect. Atropine also increased (125%) the time to the onset of dieldrin-induced convulsions. It did not alter hepatic PEPCK activity. L-alpha-Methyldopa decreased (24%) the hyperglycemic response in the first 2 hr after dieldrin treatment. It caused similar reductions in blood glucose when given during the peak hyperglycemic response. L-alpha-Methyldopa also reduced (49%) the dieldrin-effected increase in hepatic PEPCK activity. DL-Propranolol did not alter the effects of dieldrin. Thus these data suggest that the dieldrin-induced hyperglycemia is mediated by the CNS, primarily via enhanced cholinergic activity and secondarily by increased alpha-adrenergic activity. It is suggested that the pancreas responds to the cholinergic outflow by increasing the secretion of glucagon while simultaneously responding to the alpha-adrenergic outflow by decreasing insulin secretion.", 
    "6": "A 25 micrograms dose of testosterone propionate injected at 4 days of age induced 90% anovulation at 100 days of age. The systemic administration of orciprenaline (8 or 16 micrograms) or yohimbine (100 micrograms) did not prevent androgenization. Twenty-five or fifty micrograms of orciprenaline injected intraventricularly reduced only partially (to 54 and 67% respectively) the effectiveness of androgenization. We concluded that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation had a very limited ability to prevent androgenization, since the beta-stimulation obtained directly with orciprenaline prevented androgenization to a very limited extent, while the possible indirect stimulation through an increase in norepinephrine endogenous release by alpha-2 receptor blocker yohimbine was ineffective.", 
    "7": "Experiments in isolated left auricle and right ventricular papillary muscle from guinea-pig hearts were performed in order to study the effects of nickel ions (Ni2+) on the transmembrane action potential. On the electrically paced guinea-pig left auricle NiCl2 in 10(-8)M concentration did not modify the action potential (AP). 10(-7)M Ni2+ caused a slight hyperpolarizing effect, markedly enhanced the maximum rate of rise of AP (Vmax) and shortened the duration of AP.10(-6) and 10(-5)M NiCl2 dose-dependently accelerated the repolarization, while 10(-5)M had a strong depolarizing effect, too. The stimulatory effect of 10(-7)M NiCl2 on Vmax could be observed under Ca-free condition too. Increase of Vmax caused by 10(-7)M Ni2+ was not prevented by cholinergic blockade (atropine, 3 X 10(-7)M) by beta-adrenergic blockade (pindolol, 4 X 10(-7)M) or by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (indomethacin, 10(-6)M). On the electrically paced guinea-pig papillary muscle both 10(-7)M and 10(-5)M NiCl2 increased the resting membrane potential (RP), the overshoot and Vmax but accelerated only slightly the initial repolarization phase. A concentration of 10(-4)M NiCl2, however, without causing any effect on the other parameters, shortened the whole repolarization phase. The h infinity-curve relating Vmax of the ventricular action potential to the membrane potential was increased by 10(-7)M Ni2+. The increase of Vmax was more pronounced at membrane potentials more negative than -75 mV and could not be observed at membrane potentials more positive than -70 mV. Steady state inactivation of Vmax was shifted by 5 mV to more negative potentials by 10(-7)M Ni2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Effects of isosorbide 5-mononitrate (5-ISMN) on cardiovascular function were compared with those of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), verapamil and propranolol. In anesthetized open-chest dogs, intravenous injection of 5-ISMN (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg) scarcely decreased cardiac contractile force (CCF) and heart rate (HR). The systolic blood pressure (SBP) fell in a dose-dependent manner, and the degree of the change was greater than that in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Especially, left ventricular pressure (LVP) and left ventricular dp/dt (LVdp/dt) were significantly decreased, and a considerable reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was also observed. Intravenous injection of verapamil (0.3 mg/kg) considerably lowered DBP. While HR, CCF, LVP and LVdp/dt were markedly decreased, LVEDP showed a moderate increase. Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) greatly decreased LVdp/dt together with HR and CCF. Conversely, LVEDP showed a slight increase. There was no change in SBP, DBP and LVP. The vasodilating potency of 5-ISMN was 150 times smaller than that of ISDN on the contractile response in isolated rabbit thoracic aorta. On the other hand, in terms of decrease in pulse pressure, the potency exhibited by 5-ISMN was about 4 times (intravenous administration in anesthetized dogs) or 1.5 times (oral administration in conscious dogs) smaller than that of ISDN. The present results suggest that 5-ISMN shows a high bioavailability and a potency comparable to ISDN, especially in the case of peroral administration. Taking these results together with the fact that transient left ventricular failure occurs during myocardial ischemia into consideration, it is thought that peroral 5-ISMN preparation may be useful in the therapy of angina pectoris.", 
    "9": "Based on the data obtained in acute clinico-pharmacological tests with 0.075 mg hemiton, 250 mg dopegyt and 40 mg anaprilin in patients with stage II essential hypertension a system of predicting the efficacy of hypotensive therapy has been designed. It has been established that the hypotensive effects of the indicated drugs can be predicted with the aid of the system not only under the conditions of acute clinico-pharmacological tests but also during treatment given in courses.", 
    "10": "There appears to be a need for a readily and conveniently available close chemical analog of propranolol suitable for use as internal standard in a variety of chromatographic assays of the drug. With this purpose in mind, we developed a simple procedure for the preparation of N-cyclopentyldesisopropylpropranolol. The commercially available and inexpensive starting materials are mixed in a flask and after 48 hr at room temperature the precipitated product is filtered off. Mass spectrometry, melting point determinations, and elemental analysis were used to characterize the product. N-cyclopentyldesisopropylpropranolol was used as internal standard in a liquid-chromatographic assay of ten replicate 50 ng/ml propranolol plasma samples, and gave a coefficient of variation of 3.4%.", 
    "11": "An intracoronary administration of ionomycin A, a K-selective ionophore, produced coronary vasodilation in the presence of pindolol in anesthetized dogs. Coronary vasodilation induced by ionomycin A, KCI and nifedipine was inhibited by pretreatment with an intracoronary injection of ouabain. This result suggests that lonomycin A-induced coronary vasodilation may be partly due to a stimulation of Na+, K+-ATPase as well as KCI and/or a decrease in Ca2+ influx as well as nifedipine.", 
    "12": "The effect of vitamin K3, which inhibits electron transfer from NADPH to cytochrome P-450 via cytochrome c reductase, on the metabolism of propranolol was studied in the rat in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro experiments using rat liver microsomes, the metabolism of propranolol was inhibited by vitamin K3. For in vivo experiments, the area under the blood concentration-time curve and the maximum concentration of propranolol were markedly increased following intraportal infusion of propranolol with vitamin K3, but intraportal administration of vitamin K3 had little effect on propranolol kinetics when propranolol was infused intravenously. Thus, it was concluded that vitamin K3 inhibited the first-pass metabolism of propranolol.", 
    "13": "In rats, diastolic and systolic pressure-volume correlations of the intact heart in situ were recorded under control conditions and after various amounts of propranolol and ethanol given intravenously. Besides the cardio-depressant effect of propranolol, there is an additional dose-dependent effect caused by ethanol. The administration of propranolol or ethanol alone, even in high doses, causes no mortality; the combination of both drugs even in low doses is associated with a lethality of about 40%. Only few comparable clinical findings have been presented.", 
    "14": "Plasma protein binding of propranolol (PROP) was determined in 18 migraine patients chronically treated with different doses (from 60 to 240 mg/day) of the drug. In 9 patients serum lipids and PROP binding were determined before and during the therapy. Free fractions of PROP ranged from 4.7 to 13.3% and they were similar to those found in vitro in healthy volunteers. Total and free concentrations were highly correlated (r = 0.929; p less than 0.001); correlations between daily doses (in mg/kg) and free and total concentrations were very similar: r = 0.76 and r = 0.73 respectively. Changes in binding and serum lipids during the therapy were insignificant and unrelated.", 
    "15": "Plasma concentrations of propranolol and the changes of exercise induced heart rate were determined in 6 healthy subjects. An amount of 40 mg of propranolol was given alone or in combination with 30 ml of aluminum hydroxide gel. Neither the bioavailability nor the beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of propranolol was significantly changed by concurrent administration of aluminum hydroxide gel. There is no need to increase the propranolol dose when aluminum hydroxide gel is administered concurrently.", 
    "16": "Acebutolol 400 mg vs. propranolol retard 160 mg were investigated in a multicentral, double-blind, cross-over study for their action on blood pressure and heart rate in outpatients during ergometer exercise. A 2-week single-blind placebo control phase, which served as a wash-out and to eliminate placebo responders, preceded the 6-week treatment phase with propranolol (or acebutolol) followed by a further 6-week phase with acebutolol (or propranolol). At the end of each treatment phase a bicycle ergometer test was carried out, the values for 18 patients (from 26 completed investigations) were carried forward to the evaluation of the ergometry. The treatment groups were shown to be comparable. Acebutolol and propranolol produced a similar fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate at rest. During ergometer exercise, acebutolol led to a significantly lower increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate than propranolol. The possible role of the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) and the relative cardioselectivity of the test agents and the clinical impact of the hemodynamic findings with respect to morbidity and mortality are briefly discussed. Questioning at the end of the study revealed that significantly more patients preferred the treatment with acebutolol.", 
    "17": "The effects of two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, penbutolol (administered on separate occasions as (+/-)- and (-)-forms) and propranolol, on the kinetics of antipyrine were studied in eight normal subjects. At the same degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, as assessed by the lowering of exercise tachycardia, propranolol decreased antipyrine clearance by 31 +/- 11 s.d.% (P less than 0.001) whereas neither of the two penbutolol formulations had a significant effect. The volume of distribution of antipyrine was unchanged following any of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist treatments. The lack of effect of penbutolol on oxidative drug metabolism is not consistent with in vitro data suggesting a relationship between the lipid solubility of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and inhibition of metabolism.", 
    "18": "Pharmacy and therapeutics (P & T) committee drug evaluation reports prepared by pharmacies and drug information centers (DICs) and product package inserts were compared with standard guidelines to evaluate their quality. Letters were sent to 143 hospital pharmacies asking them to submit a previously prepared drug evaluation report on temazepam, moxalactam disodium, or atenolol. The reports and package inserts for these three drugs were evaluated by the presence of 40 elements derived from the published ASHP guidelines for drug evaluation report preparation. Responses were obtained from 124 (87%) pharmacies; however, only 80 reports (60 DIC-prepared and 20 pharmacy-prepared) were received. The reports contained a mean of 28 of the 40 (70%) possible elements. The most frequently omitted elements were AHFS number, potential unlabeled uses, drug-drug interactions, drug-disease-laboratory test interactions, risk and benefit data, prevention and treatment of side effects, comparisons with established treatment, and disadvantages of the drug under consideration. Although the reports prepared by the DICs and pharmacies contained the same amount of information, the DIC-prepared reports included data more frequently on supply sources, therapeutic indications, approved labeling, comparison with established treatment, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, and recommendations. Most of the reports contained more elements than the corresponding package inserts. The product package inserts did not contain the comparative elements required for P & T committee decisions. Both the pharmacy- and DIC-prepared reports failed to contain all 40 elements recommended in the standard guidelines, suggesting the need for more thorough reports.", 
    "19": "Compound LY175326 is one of a series of novel cardiovascular agents with both inotropic and vasodilator activities. In cat papillary muscles, LY175326 increased contractility in a concentration-dependent manner; these actions were not blocked by prazosin, propranolol or cimetidine. Inotropic responses were observed in unpaced, perfused guinea-pig hearts and these effects were associated with modest increases in heart rate and coronary flow. An i.v. dose of 0.1 mg/kg of LY175326 caused 54 and 95% increases in contractility in either the anesthetized cat or dog, respectively; corresponding heart rates were increased by less than 10%. Oral administration of 0.5 mg/kg to dogs was associated with an inotropic response that was maximal between 60 and 90 min and lasted in excess of 3 hr. These effects were not accompanied by increases in heart rate, gross behavioral changes or emesis. The pharmacology of LY175326 was evaluated in a propranolol-induced heart failure model using anesthetized beagle dogs. A bolus injection of 0.15 mg/kg of LY175326 followed by an infusion of 0.4 mg/kg/hr reversed the hemodynamic symptoms of heart failure by increasing left ventricular dP/dt60, cardiac output and stroke volume and reducing left atrial filling pressure and vascular resistance; heart rate was unchanged and calculated myocardial oxygen consumption was reduced. This balance of inotropic:vasodilator activities may provide a means of improving cardiac function while maintaining the myocardial oxygen supply:demand.", 
    "20": "Previous in vivo studies have shown that the presystemic clearance of p.o.-administered levo-isomer of propranolol is inhibited in rats with uranyl nitrate-induced acute renal failure. A series of steady-state single-pass rat liver perfusion studies were performed to explore the probable mechanism of the observed metabolic inhibition. When livers from normal rats were perfused with blood perfusate prepared from normal donor animals, a high extraction ratio (Eh) of 0.974 +/- 0.005 (mean +/- S.D.) was observed at an influent I-propranolol concentration of 400 ng/ml, i.e., only 2.6% of drug entering the liver escaped single-pass extraction. The extraction of I-propranolol was significantly lower (i.e., Eh = 0.906 +/- 0.017) when livers isolated from uranyl nitrate-induced renal failure rats were perfused with uremic blood; such that there was an approximate 3-fold increase in the amount of drug escaping single-pass extraction (i.e., from 2.6 to 9.4%). This difference in hepatic extraction is quantitatively consistent with the increase in p.o. systemic availability of I-propranolol observed in our previous in vivo study with the uranyl nitrate-induced renal failure rat model. When livers from normal rats were cross-perfused with uremic blood, extraction of I-propranolol was depressed to almost the same level (i.e., Eh = 0.927 +/- 0.009) as when livers from renal failure animals were perfused with uremic blood. In contrast, livers from renal failure rats cross-perfused with normal blood exhibited comparable extraction for I-propranolol (Eh = 0.970 +/- 0.010) as normal livers perfused with normal blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Duck red cells exhibit specific volume-sensitive ion transport processes that are inhibited by furosemide, but not by ouabain. Swelling cells in a hypotonic synthetic medium activates a chloride-dependent, but sodium-independent, potassium transport. Shrinking cells in a hypertonic synthetic medium stimulates an electrically neutral co-transport of [Na + K + 2 Cl] with an associated 1:1 K/K (or K/Rb) exchange. These shrinkage-induced modes can also be activated in both hypo- and hypertonic solutions by beta-adrenergic catecholamines (e.g., norepinephrine). Freshly drawn cells spontaneously shrink approximately 4-5% when removed from the influence of endogenous plasma catecholamines, either by incubation in a catecholamine-free, plasma-like synthetic medium, or in plasma to which a beta-receptor blocking dose of propranolol has been added. This spontaneous shrinkage resembles the response of hypotonically swollen cells in that it is due to a net loss of KCl with no change in cell sodium. Norepinephrine abolishes the net potassium transport seen in both fresh and hypotonically swollen cells. Moreover, cells swollen in diluted plasma, at physiological pH and extracellular potassium, show no net loss of KCl and water (\"volume-regulatory decrease\") unless propranolol is added. Examination of the individual cation fluxes in the presence of catecholamines demonstrates that activation of [Na + K + 2Cl] co-transport with its associated K/Rb exchange prevents, or overrides, swelling-induced [K + Cl] co-transport. These results, therefore, cast doubt on whether the swelling-induced [K + Cl] system can serve a volume-regulatory function under in vivo conditions.", 
    "22": "These studies have examined the effects of dl-propranolol, d-propranolol, and metoprolol on aortic atherogenesis in the cholesterol-fed rabbit and have correlated the vascular effects of the drugs with their influence on blood pressure, plasma lipids and lipoproteins, arterial metabolism, and arterial permeability. dl-Propranolol, and, to a lesser extent, d-propranolol, used in clinically relevant doses of 5 mg/kg body weight per day, inhibited the development of aortic atherosclerosis in association with significant reductions in aortic free and esterified cholesterol content. No significant effects of the drugs on blood pressure or on the total amounts or types of circulating lipoproteins were apparent. Accumulation of cholesterol in the liver and adrenal gland was not influenced by propranolol. Aortic acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase and lysosomal enzyme activities were reduced by propranolol administration, but the inhibition may have been secondary to the lesser degrees of atherosclerosis and cholesterol accumulation present. In vitro inhibition of acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity by either dl- or d-propranolol was also observed, but occurred only at propranolol concentrations of 10(-3) M or greater. Treatment with dl-propranolol had no significant effect on the rate of transport of labeled albumin across the isolated carotid artery of cholesterol-fed rabbits. Metoprolol administration (6.25 mg/kg body weight per day) had no significant influence on atherogenesis or arterial metabolism in this model. The results suggest that propranolol inhibits in part the development of atherosclerosis in the cholesterol-fed rabbit, and that the effect may be related to a direct action on the arterial wall.", 
    "23": "The effects of systemic and intraportal administration of propranolol on hepatic haemodynamics were studied in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic rats. In the non-cirrhotic rat systemic infusion of 4 micrograms (kg body wt)-1 min-1 propranolol significantly decreased portal pressure, wedged hepatic venous pressure, portal venous flow and liver blood flow without affecting heart rate. Similar changes were observed in the cirrhotic rat following an infusion of 2 micrograms (kg body wt)-1 min-1 propranolol. Higher rates of propranolol infusion produced greater reductions in portal pressure, wedged hepatic venous pressure, portal venous flow and liver blood flow in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic rats but these changes were accompanied by a bradycardia. The reduction in portal pressure effected by propranolol was accompanied by an increased splanchnic vascular resistance. Intraportal injection of propranolol resulted in a rapid but transient fall in portal pressure. The decrease in portal pressure was sustained if propranolol was infused intraportally. The results indicate that propranolol effects a reduction in portal pressure via a combination of increased splanchnic vascular resistance, increased hepatic arterial resistance and reduced cardiac output. The observation that propranolol can significantly reduce portal pressure without affecting heart rate may be clinically important in the long-term management of portal hypertension. Furthermore, the rapid reduction in portal pressure following intravenous administration suggests that propranolol may be of value in the acute control of variceal haemorrhage.", 
    "24": "Transthoracic electric countershock can cause necrotic myocardial lesions in humans as well as experimental animals. The authors investigated the effect on postcountershock myocardial damage of pretreatment with prazosin (0.1 mg/kg), an alpha-1 antagonist; L-metoprolol (0.5 mg/kg), a beta-1 antagonist, and verapamil (0.5 mg/kg), a calcium channel-blocking agent. Twenty dogs were anesthetized with halothane and given two transthoracic countershocks of 295 delivered joules each after drug or vehicle treatment. Myocardial injury was quantitated 24 h following countershock by measuring the uptake of technetium-99m pyrophosphate in the myocardium. Elevated technetium-99m pyrophosphate uptake occurred in visible lesions in most dogs regardless of drug treatment. For each of four parameters of myocardial damage there was no statistically significant difference between control animals and those treated with prazosin, metoprolol, or verapamil. These data suggest that adrenergic or calcium channel-mediated mechanisms are not involved in the pathogenesis of postcountershock myocardial damage.", 
    "25": "The effects of autonomic efferent stimulation on refractoriness of the specialized His-Purkinje system were examined in open-chest dogs anesthetized with 1.0% halothane. In eight animals submaximal bilateral stimulation of the ventral ansae subclavia decreased (P less than or equal to 0.01) the average functional refractory period for the propagation of His bundle extrastimuli to five ventricular recording sites (HP-FRP) by 10.9 +/- 0.6 ms. Submaximal stimulation of the decentralized vagal nerves that produced first degree atrioventricular block did not affect ventricular refractoriness. Combined vagosympathetic stimulation produced a smaller (P less than or equal to 0.01) decrease of the average HP-FRP (7.2 +/- 1.1 ms) than that produced by sympathetic stimulation alone. Administration of atropine abolished (P less than or equal to 0.05) vagal antagonism of the shortening effect of isoproterenol on the average HP-FRP. Treatment with propranolol reversed (P less than or equal to 0.01) the sympathetic effect on the average HP-FRP and nonuniformly increased refractoriness in the His-Purkinje system. The latter changes were abolished (P less than or equal to 0.05) by infusion of phentolamine. The autonomic nervous system modulates His-Purkinje refractoriness by actions mediated by cholinergic and both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "26": "This study examined the differential reflex cardiovascular responses evoked by separate contractions of the right hindlimb and forelimb and established the mechanism of a regional reflex vasodilation associated with hindlimb skeletal muscle contraction. The two groups of skeletal muscle were contracted separately by electrical stimulation (2-48 Hz) of the peripheral motor nerves. The left nonexercising hindlimb was perfused at constant flow. All blood pressure-regulating mechanisms were intact. Arterial blood pressure (ABP), left nonexercising hindlimb perfusion pressure (HLPP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded. HR was increased by skeletal muscle contraction. This response was independent of muscle group and contraction frequency. Increases in both ABP and HLPP were produced by high-frequency contractions (greater than 16 Hz) of either the hindlimb or forelimb. Decreases were evoked only by hindlimb contractions (greater than 8 Hz). The nonexercising skeletal muscle vascular bed contributed to this systemic depressor response by vasodilating. The mechanism involved a contraction-induced withdrawal of sympathetic nerve activity to that vascular bed. Concomitant with this response was an increase in heart rate that was blocked with propranolol. Similar heart rate changes evoked by forelimb contractions also were blocked with propranolol. These data indicate that sympathetic outflow to resting skeletal muscle depends on the origin and magnitude of the afferent signal from the contracting skeletal muscle.", 
    "27": "Arterial-deep venous differences for glucose and lactate across the nonexercising forearm were determined in healthy subjects during 3 h of leg exercise at 50% of maximum oxygen uptake and during 20-min recovery. At 160 min of exercise 0.5 mg propranolol was infused into the brachial artery. The results were compared with a control group that did not receive propranolol during exercise. Exercise stimulated to increased forearm lactate release which was higher than that which could be accounted for by the simultaneous blood glucose uptake. After propranolol forearm lactate production decreased during and after exercise while the controls still showed increasing lactate release. In contrast to the control values the lactate production by the blocked forearm could be accounted for by the glucose uptake. It is concluded that the stimulating effect of prolonged exercise on nonexercising muscle that persists during recovery is characterized by increased lactate release derived from beta-adrenergically stimulated glycogenolysis.", 
    "28": "The effect of catecholamines on glycogenolysis and sugar transport was evaluated in rat epitrochlearis (fast-twitch) and soleus (slow-twitch) muscles in vitro. When muscles were incubated with 0.1 microM epinephrine (both an alpha- and beta-agonist), the proportion of phosphorylase in the a form increased from 6.2 +/- 0.7 to 37.4 +/- 5.7% in epitrochlearis muscle and from 9.1 +/- 0.7 to 21.6 +/- 1.3% in soleus muscle. Both the activation of phosphorylase and the resulting glycogenolysis could be prevented by preincubation with the beta-blocker, propranolol. The effect of catecholamines on the rate of sugar transport was also examined in epitrochlearis muscle. The beta-agonist, isoproterenol, significantly depressed the rate of 3-O-methylglucose uptake, while the alpha-agonist, phenylephrine, had no effect. Inclusion of 0.1% albumin in the incubation medium increased the resting rate of sugar transport twofold. When isoproterenol + albumin were present, rather than exerting a depressive effect the catecholamine further increased the rate of sugar uptake. This increase was prevented by preincubation with propranolol. It was concluded that glycogenolysis and sugar transport in rat skeletal muscle are solely under beta-adrenergic control.", 
    "29": "Experiments were performed to determine the importance of sympathetic blockade vs a direct myocardial effect as a mechanism for the antifibrillatory action of bretylium. The ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold was determined in open-chest, anesthetized dogs by scanning the vulnerable period with either a single electrical stimulus (10 ms) or a train of electrical stimuli (14 pulses, 4 ms, 100 Hz). Using the train-of-pulses technique, the VF threshold increased from 6.8 +/- 0.6 mA to 29.7 +/- 6.4 mA 15 minutes after a 10-mg/kg intravenous bolus of bretylium (p less than 0.001, n = 8). There was no further significant change in the train-of-pulses VF threshold at 2 or 4 hours. Beta-adrenergic blockade with timolol (0.2 mg/kg) increased the train-of-pulses VF threshold from 6.7 +/- 1.6 mA to 24.5 +/- 5.2 mA (p less than 0.01 n = 8) and prevented any further significant change in response to bretylium. When single electrical pulses were used to scan the vulnerable period, bretylium at doses of 10 mg/kg (n = 8) and 100 mg/kg (n = 6) did not alter the VF threshold over a 4-hour observation period. The administration of timolol, alone or in combination with bretylium, did not significantly alter the single-pulse VF threshold. The failure of bretylium to alter the single-pulse VF threshold was not dependent on the site of stimulation. Stimulation of the right sympathetic cardiac nerves showed that 15 minutes of bretylium treatment was sufficient to completely inhibit adrenergic neuronal transmission to the myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "This double-blind, randomized, crossover study examined the effects of intravenous infusion of esmolol (a new ultra-short-acting beta-receptor blocking agent) and propranolol on cardiovascular performance at rest and during peak upright exercise in 15 patients. Biventricular function was assessed by means of first-pass radionuclide ventriculography with a computerized multicrystal camera. At rest, significant treatment differences between esmolol and propranolol vs baseline were found for the heart rate, systolic blood pressure, double product, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume ratio, cardiac index and right ventricular EF. During exercise, significant treatment differences were also found for the heart rate, systolic blood pressure, double product, right ventricular EF and cardiac index. The mean baseline measurements were higher than the mean treatment measurements, but no significant differences were found between mean esmolol and mean propranolol measurements at rest and during exercise except for the exercise systolic blood pressure, which was lower during esmolol infusion. The magnitude of drug effect was greater at the time of exercise than at rest. The blood level of esmolol decreased markedly by 30 minutes after infusion. Esmolol was well tolerated, with no important local, systemic or laboratory abnormalities. Thus, the effects of esmolol on cardiovascular performance at rest and exercise are similar to those of propranolol.", 
    "31": "The safety and efficacy of oral acebutolol therapy for the suppression of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were assessed in two clinical trials pooled for analysis. Thirty-two patients suffering from organic heart disease, who had experienced an average of greater than or equal to 10 PVCs/h (range 14 to 996 three times a day) on Holter monitoring during a 24-hour baseline study period, were given acebutolol (100 mg three times a day to 400 mg four times a day) over 4 weeks. Three patients were withdrawn from the study for administrative reasons, and four patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Of the 25 remaining patients (24 men, 1 woman; mean age 56 years, range 37 to 69), 18 (72%) experienced some reduction in PVCs from the second through the fourth week of therapy. Eleven patients (44%) experienced clinically significant reductions (greater than or equal to 75%) in PVCs. The onset of the antiarrhythmic effect of acebutolol was within 7 days of administration. Transient mild to moderate side effects were noted in eight patients. Significant correlations (p less than 0.001) were observed between the mean daily dose of acebutolol and (1) mean blood levels, (2) reduction in PVCs, and (3) reduction in resting heart rate. The average daily dose of acebutolol ranged from 304 to 1060 mg. In nine patients receiving acebutolol in a 12-month open-label extension, both efficacy and safety were maintained. This study confirms that oral acebutolol therapy in both safe and efficacious for suppressing PVCs in patients with organic heart disease.", 
    "32": "Acebutolol was compared to placebo, propranolol, and quinidine for the suppression of chronic ventricular arrhythmia in three double-blind, randomized crossover studies. Patients averaged greater than or equal to 10 to 30 premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) per hour in the baseline periods. Compared to baseline in all three studies, acebutolol significantly (p less than 0.002 to p less than 0.001) reduced mean total PVCs and complex PVCs. In all measurements, acebutolol was superior to placebo (p less than 0.02 to p less than 0.001) and comparable to propranolol and quinidine. During acebutolol treatment, 39% of the patients had reductions of greater than or equal to 75% in mean hourly PVC frequency compared to 23% during placebo treatment (p = 0.02). Similar numbers of patients had greater than or equal to 75% reductions during acebutolol treatment in comparison with propranolol and quinidine. Acebutolol was better tolerated than quinidine and produced an antiarrhythmic effect equivalent to that of propranolol, with a significantly (p less than 0.01) lesser decrease in resting heart rate. The antiarrhythmic activity of acebutolol, its ancillary pharmacologic properties, and its tolerance by a diverse group of patients make acebutolol a significant tool for the clinician in the management of chronic arrhythmia.", 
    "33": "Acebutolol was compared to atenolol in 33 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg) with the use of a double-blind crossover study design. At 8 weeks of treatment, acebutolol, 400 mg once daily, and atenolol, 100 mg once daily, produced similar significant (p less than 0.01) reductions in average mean arterial blood pressure (12% and 11%, respectively) from baseline. Average heart rate at 4 weeks was also significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) from baseline (acebutolol, 14.8%; atenolol, 18.3%); the reduction with acebutolol, however, was significantly less (p less than 0.05) than that seen with atenolol. Both agents produced similar effects during exercise, and serum drug determinations showed acebutolol to be rapidly metabolized. Acebutolol appeared to be better tolerated: the frequency of side effects with acebutolol (24%) was less than with atenolol (45%). Acebutolol is as effective as atenolol in mild to moderate essential hypertension. Acebutolol appears to be better tolerated and to have a lesser effect on heart rate than atenolol.", 
    "34": "The antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory actions of the dextrorotatory isomer of sotalol, administered in a multiple-dose regimen, were evaluated in conscious dogs 3 to 5 days after anterior myocardial infarction. The intravenous administration of d-sotalol, four 8 mg/kg doses over a 24-hour treatment period, suppressed the induction of ventricular tachycardia by programmed electrical stimulation in six of nine dogs tested, slowed the rate of the induced tachyarrhythmia in two of the remaining three dogs, and provided significant protection (5 of 8 d-sotalol vs 0 of 8 vehicle control) against the development of ventricular fibrillation in response to ischemia at a site distant to a previous myocardial infarction. Increases in ventricular myocardial refractoriness and in QTc and paced QT intervals suggest that class III electrophysiologic actions contribute to the antiarrhythmic properties of dextrorotatory sotalol in this animal model. The degree of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade produced by d-sotalol in this dose regimen was negligible. These findings suggest the potential utility of d-sotalol in the prevention of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in the setting of myocardial infarction, particularly when beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is undesirable or contraindicated.", 
    "35": "Transient myocardial ischemia, with attendant sympathetic hyperactivity, seems to play a major role in sudden cardiac death among patients with ischemic heart disease. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF) are consistently and repeatedly elicited in cats by the interaction between a 2-minute occlusion of the left descending coronary artery and a 30-second stimulation of the left stellate ganglion. When three consecutive trials yield almost identical results, time alone will not modify the response and a given drug can be injected to test its efficacy with an internal control analysis. In 90 cats the efficacy of the following drugs was assessed: lidocaine (n = 11), mexiletine (n = 12), propafenone (n = 12), propranolol (n = 19), prazosin (n = 10), amiodarone (n = 14), and verapamil (n = 12). Class I antiarrhythmic drugs completely failed to afford protection and worsening of arrhythmia was observed in several instances. Propranolol and prazosin showed efficacy in approximately 80% and 60% of the animals, respectively. Amiodarone and verapamil completely prevented the onset of VT and VF. Protection from arrhythmias seems to be related to the combined presence of a noncompetitive adrenergic blockade associated with salutary effects on coronary circulation. These findings correlate with and help to explain the results of clinical trials in postmyocardial infarction patients. This model may help to provide a rational choice of antiarrhythmic drugs to be tested in clinical trials.", 
    "36": "Left ventricular ejection fraction is commonly used in the clinical assessment of ventricular function. However, the effect of changes in end-diastolic volume on ejection fraction is controversial. The present study examines the effect of changes in end-diastolic volume on ejection fraction in 26 anesthetized dogs on right heart bypass with controlled hemodynamics. At the end of each experiment, pressure-volume relationships were obtained in the potassium arrested heart following suturing of the mitral valve leaflets and clamping of the aortic root. This technique allowed determination of the end-diastolic volume from the end-diastolic pressure. Ejection fraction is highly dependent on end-diastolic volume and end-diastolic pressure at lower levels of end-diastolic volume and end-diastolic pressure. Ejection fraction increased from 30 +/- 1% (SEM) to 64 +/- 2% (p less than 0.001) when end-diastolic pressure was increased from 4 +/- 0.5 to 11 +/- 0.5 cm H2O. The corresponding end-diastolic volumes were 22 +/- 0.5 and 38 +/- 1 ml, respectively (p less than 0.01). Ejection fraction only increased from 64 +/- 2% to 71 +/- 1% (p less than 0.01) when end-diastolic pressure was increased from 11 +/- 0.5 to 18 +/- 1 cm H2O. The corresponding end-diastolic volumes were 38 +/- 1 and 50 +/- 1 ml (p less than 0.01), respectively. This dependence of ejection fraction on preload is present over a wide range of levels of aortic pressure. Similar directional changes in ejection fraction with preload were present after an adequate autonomic blockade, in the presence of either increased or decreased inotropic state and in the presence of an open or closed pericardium. Thus, the present study demonstrates that ejection fraction can be substantially altered by acute changes in end-diastolic volume. This factor should be taken into account when using ejection fraction for the clinical assessment of ventricular function.", 
    "37": "Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) overdose can cause severe hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, and death. We studied the efficacy and safety of propranolol in the treatment of PPA-induced hypertension. Subjects received propranolol either by mouth for 48 hours before PPA or as a rapid intravenous infusion after PPA. PPA, 75 mg alone, increased blood pressure (31 +/- 14 mm Hg systolic, 20 +/- 5 mm Hg diastolic), and propranolol pretreatment antagonized this increase (12 +/- 10 mm Hg systolic, 10 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic). Intravenous propranolol after PPA also decreased blood pressure. Left ventricular function (assessed by echocardiography) showed that PPA increased the stroke volume 30% (from 62.5 +/- 20.9 to 80.8 +/- 22.4 ml), the ejection fraction 9% (from 64% +/- 10% to 70% +/- 7%), and cardiac output 14% (from 3.6 +/- 0.6 to 4.1 +/- 1.0 L/min). Intravenous propranolol reversed these effects. Systemic vascular resistance was increased by PPA 28% (from 1710 +/- 200 to 2190 +/- 700 dyne X sec/cm5) and was further increased by propranolol 22% (to 2660 +/- 1200 dyne X sec/cm5). We conclude that PPA increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, and that propranolol antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of PPA on cardiac output. That propranolol antagonizes the pressor effect of PPA is in contrast to the interaction in which propranolol enhances the pressor effect of norepinephrine. This is probably because PPA has less beta 2 activity than does norepinephrine.", 
    "38": "Average steady-state propranolol plasma concentration (Css) were calculated from published steady-state propranolol clearance data for dose rates (Ro) of 40, 80, 160, 240, and 320 mg/ day in divided doses every 6 hours. The Css-Ro data for each of four subjects were fit essentially perfectly by the equation: Css = KmRo/ (Vm-Ro). Very similar Vm and Km values were obtained with the Vmi and Kmi values for four parallel Michaelis-Menten pathways of propranolol metabolism. It is shown by use of the mean Vm and Km values that the propranolol input rate profoundly affects its bioavailability, which is expected for a first-pass drug that follows Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics after oral dosing. This most likely explains the poor bioavailability of propranolol after a sustained-release formulation. The decreased bioavailability of propranolol when the number of subdivisions of the daily dose is increased is also explained.", 
    "39": "To study the regional function of nonischemic myocardium after the onset of regional ischemia, graded circumflex coronary arterial stenosis was induced in 18 open-chest anesthetized dogs. Two-dimensional echocardiographic views were obtained at each degree of occlusion in a cross-sectional plane marked by two to three metal beads sewn to the left ventricular epicardium. Percent systolic thickening was measured at 16 equally spaced points around the left ventricle and correlated with microsphere-determined regional myocardial blood flow. Baseline thickening averaged 44.9 +/- 6.4%. During transmural ischemia percent systolic thickening decreased to -16.1 +/- 4.0% in the ischemic region and also decreased in adjacent nonischemic regions (to 2.4 +/- 2.4% in segments closest to the ischemic region [adjacent 1] and to 15.5 +/- 3.9 in segments further away [adjacent 2]), but was unchanged in segments directly opposite the ischemic region (remote region). During subendocardial ischemia, percent systolic thickening fell only in the ischemic and adjacent 1 regions (1.4 +/- 5.2% and 24.9 +/- 5.0%, respectively). Dipyridamole, 0.21 to 0.42 mg/min iv, given to seven dogs during transmural ischemia, caused a three- to fivefold increase in flow to the nonischemic and no change in flow to the ischemic region; function was not altered in any region. Propranolol, 0.1 mg/kg iv, was given to five dogs during transmural ischemia to depress contractility in the remote region. Percent systolic thickening fell in the remote (from 50.0 +/- 7.7% to 34.6 +/- 5.6%), but increased in adjacent 1 (from -0.25 +/- 3.7% to 15.2 +/- 3.9%) and in adjacent 2 (from 17.4 +/- 2.8% to 33.4 +/- 3.9%) regions, and remained unchanged in the ischemic region. We conclude the following: During transmural ischemia percent systolic thickening is markedly impaired in nonischemic myocardium immediately adjacent to the ischemic region, and is impaired to a lesser degree in regions located relatively far from the ischemic border. Dysfunction therefore overestimates the extent of regional ischemia after total coronary occlusion. During subendocardial ischemia function ceases in the ischemic region and functional impairment of nonischemic myocardium is restricted to immediately adjacent regions. Dysfunction of adjacent regions is not caused by \"relative ischemia\" related to increased local oxygen demands or to a steal phenomenon. Mechanical tethering of nonischemic myocardium adjacent to ischemic regions, secondary to changes in left ventricular shape during contraction, may contribute to the impairment of systolic thickening in adjacent regions during transmural ischemia.", 
    "40": "The metabolism of amosulalol hydrochloride, (+/-)-5-[1-hydroxy-2-[[2-(o-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino]ethyl]-2- methylbenzenesulphonamide hydrochloride, was studied in man and laboratory animals. Humans excreted 30.1% of dose as unchanged drug, and the sulphate conjugate of a 5-hydroxy metabolite, (+/-)-5-[1-hydroxy-2-[[2-(5-hydroxy-2-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-amino] ethyl]-2-methylbenzenesulphonamide, was the major metabolite. Amosulalol hydrochloride was extensively metabolized in animals with 10% or less excreted as unchanged drug. Hydroxylation of the 2-methyl group and O-demethylation of the o-methoxyphenoxy group were preferred in rats, and oxidative C-N cleavage yielding o-methoxyphenoxyacetic acid (M-5) preceded other reactions in dogs. Monkeys excreted almost equal amounts of the 5-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy metabolites as well as M-5.", 
    "41": "The effect of propranolol on thyroid status was investigated by administering the drug in 2 therapeutic doses (80 mg b.d. and 120 mg b.d.) to 8 healthy volunteers and serially measuring total and free thyroid hormones and their major binding protein. Mean free T3 fell by 1.2 pmol/l (P less than 0.05) whilst mean free T4 and mean rT3 rose by 3.3 pmol/l (P less than 0.01) and 0.16 nmol/l (P less than 0.01) respectively. Mean thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) fell by 1.2 mg/l (P less than 0.001). Despite the change in free hormone levels there was no significant change in TSH. For the first time the effect of propranolol on circulating thyroid hormones and binding proteins in healthy subjects is apparent within one study. The biological significance of the change in free hormone levels is discussed.", 
    "42": "Pulmonary responses to intravenous leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4 administered as a bolus injection and by continuous infusion were studied in anesthetized guinea pigs. LTD4, LTC4 and LTE4 (respective ED50 of 0.21 +/- .1, 0.64 +/- .2 and 2.0 +/- .1 microgram kg-1) produced dose-dependent increases in insufflation pressure when given as a bolus injection to anesthetized guinea pigs (Konzett-R\u00f6ssler). Bronchoconstriction was antagonized by FPL-55712 (50-200 micrograms kg-1), and indomethacin (50-200 micrograms kg-1) but was not significantly altered by mepyramine (1.0 mg kg-1), methysergide (0.1 mg kg-1), intal (10 mg kg-1) mepacrine (5 mg kg-1) or dexamethasone (10 mg kg-1). The beta adrenoceptor blocker, timolol (5 micrograms kg-1) produced a significantly greater potentiation of the responses to the leukotrienes than to arachidonic acid, histamine and acetylcholine. Responses to bolus injection of LTE4 but not LTD4 or LTC4 were partially antagonized by atropine (100 micrograms kg-1) and bilateral vagotomy. In experiments of a different design, continuous infusion of LTD4 and LTE4 (2.8-3.2 micrograms kg-1 min-1) into indomethacin-treated animals produced slowly developing increases in pulmonary resistance and decreases in compliance. The increase in resistance produced by LTE4 and LTD4 was partly reversed by intravenous FPL-55712 (1.0 mg kg-1) and atropine (100 micrograms kg-1) but was almost completely reversed by FPL-55712 (3 - 10 mg kg-1). These findings indicate that leukotrienes can produce bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs through cyclooxygenase-dependent and cyclooxygenase independent mechanisms both of which are blocked by FPL-55712. Cholinergic mechanisms are involved in the mediation of part of the response to bolus injection of LTE4 as well as a small part of the initial response to continuous infusion of LTD4 and LTE4. Intrinsic beta adrenoceptor activation serves to down modulate responses to the leukotrienes to a greater extent than responses to arachidonic acid, histamine and acetylcholine.", 
    "43": "Present investigations support major contributions from increases in both portal blood flow and portal vascular resistance in the mechanism that maintains portal hypertension. beta-Adrenergic blockers have been shown to reduce the elevated portal blood flow component. The possibility that nitroglycerin administration could reduce the elevated portal vascular resistance component is investigated here. Portal hypertension was induced in rats by a calibrated constriction of the portal vein. Portal hypertensive rats receiving placebo exhibited significant (p less than 0.05) elevations over normal rats receiving placebo in cardiac index, portal venous inflow and portal pressure. Portal hypertensive rats were then divided into groups receiving nitroglycerin infusion, propranolol (beta-adrenergic blockade) and combined administration of nitroglycerin and propranolol. Significant reductions (p less than 0.05) in portal blood flow of 30, 32 and 44%, respectively, were accompanied by significant portal pressure reductions of 2.7 +/- 0.2, 1.7 +/- 0.3 and 3.6 +/- 0.4 mm Hg in all groups, respectively (p less than 0.05). Nitroglycerin failed to prevent a 46% rise in portal-collateral resistance accompanying the portal blood flow reduction, similar to resistance rises also found in propranolol-treated (33%) and combination nitroglycerin-propranolol-treated (49%) groups. We conclude that nitroglycerin infusion can significantly reduce portal pressure, alone or in combination with beta-blockade, by reducing portal venous inflow. It appears that nitroglycerin reduces portal blood flow through the effect of baroreceptor sympathetic reflexes that constrict the splanchnic bed in response to vasodilatation and venous pooling.", 
    "44": "Twenty-four patients with stable angina were evaluated in a 14 week crossover trial. A single-blind placebo period (baseline 1) was followed by two double-blind periods evaluating maximum tolerated doses of diltiazem (up to 360 mg daily) vs placebo. Over the next 1 to 4 weeks, propranolol was started and increased until clinically documented beta-blockade was achieved (baseline 2). The final phase consisted of a pair of evaluation periods comparing propranolol plus the maximum tolerated dose of diltiazem to propranolol and placebo. The daily rate of angina attack was 1.6 during baseline, was unchanged during placebo therapy, but fell during treatment with diltiazem to 0.6 (p less than .005). With the addition of diltiazem to propranolol, the angina rate was improved (0.3) compared with that with either propranolol alone (0.6) or propranolol and placebo (0.5) (p less than .01). Total exercise duration during baseline 1 was 360 sec and increased to 497 sec with diltiazem, 481 sec with propranolol, and 527 sec with the combination of diltiazem and propranolol. Two patients with reduced ejection fractions developed congestive heart failure with propranolol. The combination of diltiazem and propranolol similarly resulted in congestive heart failure in one patient who had tolerated both drugs alone.", 
    "45": "We evaluated the tolerance of heart transplant recipients to acute betablockade during maximal dynamic exercise. Although the increase in rate and systolic blood pressure were attenuated, exercise tolerance was reduced by only about 15%, which is similar to that previously reported in normal individuals. Betablockade attenuated the increases in heart rate of the denervated donor hearts to a greater extent compared to the increases in the innervated recipient hearts in patients with heterotopic heart transplantation. Therefore, betablockers may be safely used in heart transplantation for appropriate indications such as hypertension.", 
    "46": "In a single-blind randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study in hypertensive patients we have examined the effects of treatment with the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol on the responses of glucose, intermediary metabolites and the hormones of the enteroinsular axis to the ingestion of a mixed meal. During treatment with nadolol the plasma insulin concentration 30 min after ingesting the meal was significantly lower than on placebo and the plasma glucose rose more slowly. Plasma concentrations of GIP tended to be higher during nadolol than placebo treatment. No significant effects of treatment with nadolol were noted on pancreatic glucagon or intermediary metabolites.", 
    "47": "The natural history of and the effect of propranolol on ventricular arrhythmias post-myocardial infarction were analyzed using data from the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 3,837 patients entered from 5 to 21 days after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. At baseline, prior to randomization, 3,290 (85.7%) patients underwent 24-hr ambulatory ECG monitoring which was repeated in approximately 25% of a randomly selected subset of the study population at 6 weeks. Ventricular arrhythmias were divided into eight different categories which defined the prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias in terms of frequency and/or complexity. Ventricular arrhythmias at baseline were associated with age, past history of myocardial infarction, and use of diuretics and digitalis. Paired data (baseline and 6-week) were available for 428 patients on propranolol and 412 on placebo. Propranolol markedly blunted the two- to threefold increase in ventricular arrhythmias that occurred from baseline to 6 weeks in the placebo group. Propranolol decreased the proportion of patients having ventricular arrhythmias during waking hours compared with sleep. These data show that propranolol has an antiarrhythmic effect and suggest that an antiarrhythmic mechanism may in part be responsible for the observed reduction in sudden cardiac death mortality in BHAT.", 
    "48": "The effects of weight reduction and metoprolol (100 mg, b.d.) in the treatment of hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90-109 mmHg) in 56 young, overweight patients were investigated in a randomized placebo controlled trial. After a 4-week baseline, subjects were followed up for 21 weeks. In the weight reduction group, the fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (13/10 mmHg), associated with a mean group weight loss of 7.4 kg, was greater (P less than 0.001) than that in the placebo group (7/3 mmHg); the fall in diastolic pressure but not systolic pressure was also greater than that in the metoprolol group (10/6 mmHg). At the end of follow-up, 50% of the weight reduction group, 39% of the metoprolol group and 17% of the placebo group had a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg. In the weight reduction group there was a fall in total cholesterol and the ratio of total to HDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.001); in the metoprolol group there was a fall in HDL-cholesterol and an increase in the ratio of total to HDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.001). The results suggest that in the first step of treatment for hypertension in overweight patients, modest weight reduction produces significant and clinically important reductions in blood pressure, without incurring the adverse effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins often associated with the first step of drug therapy.", 
    "49": "Forty-five hypertensive patients, 28 women and 17 men, age range between 35 and 65 years (mean 50 years), with blood pressures which current therapy did not succeed to control, were submitted to several examinations in order to identify the cause of their hypertension. We found isolated or combined abnormal values of aldosterone, renin, calcium and or potassium as the only alterations in 19 patients. We distinguished 4 groups descretionally classified according to biochemical alterations: renin and aldosterone increase, renin increase, aldosterone increase, calcium and or potassium reduction. The therapy used, intentionally aimed at the correction of the biochemical alterations found. Normal blood pressure was achieved in all patients and simultaneously the biochemical alterations also became normal in patients with isolated hyperreninemia, with combined hyperreninemia and hyperaldosteronemia and in those with hypocalcemia and or hypopotassemia. In patients were only isolated hyperaldosteronemia was found, this condition returned to normal in all except one. We suggest that besides the disturbances in sodium distribution other electrolytes or biochemical alterations may also play an equally important role in regulating, and sustaining essential hypertension.", 
    "50": "The effects of the adrenoceptor blocking agents, phentolamine and propranolol, on the release of pancreatic glucagon and insulin in response to exogenous glucose have been investigated in conscious 2--6-week-old calves. There were no significant differences between the changes in mean plasma glucagon or insulin concentration, which occurred in response to hyperglycaemia, in calves pre-treated with both propranolol and phentolamine, phentolamine alone and normal calves. However, the rise in mean plasma insulin concentration was effectively abolished by pre-treatment with propranolol alone and there was a small but significant fall in mean plasma glucagon concentration which was not observed in any of the other groups. The results are discussed in relation to previous studies of the role of the autonomic innervation to the endocrine pancreas in the control of insulin release during hyperglycaemia in conscious calves and weaned lambs.", 
    "51": "In these studies the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol was administered to estrogen-treated hypophysectomized pseudopregnant rabbits in vivo, and serum progesterone concentrations were measured to monitor luteal function. In Experiment 1, which was designed to determine an effective dose of propranolol, 1 mg/(kg X h) s.c. propranolol for 3 h (integral of 80 ng/ml in serum) gave an adequate level of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, i.e., a 1000-fold inhibition of the blood pressure/isoproterenol dose-response relationship. In Experiment 2, \"acute\" administration of propranolol (P; 1 mg/(kg X h) s.c.) or saline (control, C) for 24 h on Days 7-8, 10-11, and 13-14 of pseudopregnancy did not produce any marked differences in serum progesterone concentrations in P or C animals on any of the days tested, although hourly fluctuations were observed. In Experiment 3, \"chronic\" (4-day) treatment with propranolol was achieved by the use of propranolol-containing pellets placed s.c. (integral of 200-600 ng/ml in serum), on Days 13-17. Control animals received pellets of vehicle only. Serum progesterone concentrations were very similar in P and C animals throughout the period of treatment (Days 13-17) and on Days 18 and 20. We conclude that endogenous catecholamines play no major role in regulating luteal steroidogenesis or corpus luteum regression in the pseudopregnant rabbit.", 
    "52": "To evaluate the response during insulin-induced hypoglycemia, diabetics treated with relatively selective or nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents were studied. Placebo, atenolol (100 mg/day), and propranolol (80 mg b.i.d.) were administered to 12 insulin-treated diabetics for 1 week in a double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion with a 2-week washout between treatments. Sufficient intravenous insulin (0.2-0.6 units/kg) was administered to decrease plasma glucose 68% from the basal level or to less than 60 mg/dl within 90 minutes. Blood pressure changes at the nadir of plasma glucose were +15.2/-9.9 mm Hg for placebo, +27.9/0 mm Hg for atenolol, and +38.8/+14.3 mm Hg for propranolol. Diastolic blood pressure changes induced by propranolol were significantly different from those induced by atenolol (p less than 0.01) and placebo (p less than 0.01), and systolic pressure changes were significantly different (p less than 0.02) between propranolol and atenolol. Mild seizures developed in two patients treated with propranolol. Their blood pressure changes at the plasma glucose nadir were +56/+22 and +86/+31 mm Hg. Other symptoms of hypoglycemia were more frequent during beta-blocker than during placebo treatment. Differences in response may be related to the relatively selective adrenergic blocking effect of these drugs.", 
    "53": "The degradation of 125I-labelled low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in HeLa cells was significantly inhibited when the cells were incubated either with the calcium channel blocking agents D600 and verapamil, or with the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine. However, nifedipine, another blocker of Ca2+ channels, did not affect the degradation of 125I-labelled LDL. The association of 125I-labelled LDL with HeLa cells was increased in proportion to the concentration of D600, and 125I-labelled LDL was accumulated in lysosomal fractions as assessed by Percoll density gradient analysis. Some 80% of 125I-labelled LDL in lysosomes of HeLa cells treated with D600 was acid-insoluble. The rate of incorporation of [3H]acetate into digitonin-precipitable material was increased 4-fold in the cells treated with 40 micrograms/ml D600 compared with untreated cells, but that of [3H]mevalonate was not enhanced. About 8 h of preincubation of the cells with D600 or verapamil was required to inhibit the LDL degradation by 50% of the control activity. It was also found that the inhibitory action of D600 could be reversed by removal of D600 from the medium. The activities of lysosomal enzymes, cathepsin B, beta-hexosaminidase, and acid phosphatase, were significantly decreased when the cells were treated with D600 and chloroquine, but not with nifedipine. Blockers of Ca2+ channels which effect the activity of lysosomal enzymes, should be useful for the study of the lysosomal function.", 
    "54": "Timolol treatment after myocardial infarction is generally related to a significant reduction in both mortality and reinfarction compared with placebo. Retrospective analyses of the timolol study are performed on subgroups of patients with a high placebo mortality. The present study shows that these patients are target groups for secondary prevention, as they benefit most from timolol treatment after myocardial infarction. In patients 65-75 years of age, the number of cardiac deaths and reinfarctions prevented by timolol treatment is twice as high as that of patients below 65 years of age. Timolol treatment is well tolerated in the older age group and the contraindications for timolol treatment are independent of age up to 75 years. The reduction in mortality and reinfarction is independent of heart size at baseline. However, in patients with cardiomegaly and compensated heart failure on treatment with digitalis and diuretics, timolol treatment may be of special importance because of the very high incidence of cardiac death in this group of patients. In patients with compensated heart failure on treatment with digitalis and diuretics, timolol treatment does not precipitate heart failure. Patients with stable diabetes mellitus basically behave like nondiabetic patients regarding inclusion rate, side effects, and timolol-related reduction in mortality and reinfarction. Decisions concerning secondary prevention with timolol should be independent of preinfarction and postinfarction angina. In conclusion, 70-80% of all the patients below 75 years of age surviving myocardial infarction, without contraindication to beta-blocker treatment, can be treated with timolol 10 mg twice daily to reduce mortality and reinfarction. In contrast to previous routines, secondary prevention with beta blockers should be especially directed to high-risk patients.", 
    "55": "The haemodynamic responses to induction and tracheal intubation have been studied in patients with coronary artery disease randomly assigned to a labetalol pretreatment group (n = 14) or to a placebo group (n = 16). Twelve hour before operation, treated patients received a bolus dose of labetalol 0.5 mg kg-1 followed by a constant infusion of 0.1 mg kg-1 h-1 i.v. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and phenoperidine, and intubation performed following the administration of suxamethonium. At intubation, the changes in heart rate (P less than 0.01), mean arterial pressure (P less than 0.05) and rate-pressure product (P less than 0.01) were significantly smaller in the labetalol group compared with the placebo group. Labetalol pretreatment appears satisfactory and may be useful in patients with coronary artery disease who have a normal left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "56": "The regulatory system responsible for insulin oscillations from the in vitro pancreas is unknown. To test the hypothesis that intrapancreatic ganglia are the pacemaker or driver of the oscillations, combined nicotinic, muscarinic, and adrenergic antagonists were infused. Combined muscarinic, alpha- and beta-adrenergic, and presynaptic nicotinic receptor blockade (beta-bungarotoxin) was without effect on oscillations. The infusion of the postsynaptic nicotinic receptor antagonists, hexamethonium, alpha-bungarotoxin (ATX), or curarine, significantly altered the preinfusion oscillatory pattern of insulin release by reducing the period. Nicotine-stimulated insulin release was inhibited by ATX on a background of atropine, phentolamine, and beta-bungarotoxin. Propranolol decreased nicotine-stimulated insulin release, which was further reduced by ATX. These data support the theory that nicotinic receptors may be present pre- and postsynaptically at the ganglionic level and presynaptically on sympathetic nerve axons. We propose that ganglionic nicotinic receptors may be regulatory and that ganglia may serve as the pacemaker to regulate pancreatic hormone oscillations.", 
    "57": "The in vitro canine pancreas produces an oscillatory pattern of insulin secretion during a constant glucose concentration despite the lack of external nervous modulation or recirculating hormone feedback. The normal period of insulin fluctuations (7.4 +/- 0.34 min) is unaffected by combined adrenergic and cholinergic blockade by 5 microM atropine, 4 microM propranolol, and 4 microM phentolamine (8.0 +/- 0.31 min, P less than 0.20). To test the theory that the coordination of islet secretion may be controlled by an intrapancreatic nervous system (nonadrenergic, noncholinergic), nerve blockade was attempted by the infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX) on a background of combined autonomic blockade. TTX infusion resulted in a change in the oscillatory pattern of insulin release by increasing net insulin release and shifting the period of oscillation to 4.5 +/- 0.29 min (P less than 0.0005) at both 88 and 200 mg/dl glucose. These results suggest that an intrinsic autonomously functioning pancreatic nervous system is responsible for the coordination of islet secretion and the production of periodic fluctuations of insulin secretion.", 
    "58": "In an open, randomized, crossover study, the efficacy of sotalol and procainamide was compared in 33 patients with frequent, chronic premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). A 75% reduction in PVCs/24 hours (two 24-hour recordings) was arbitrarily considered to constitute an adequate therapeutic effect. Sotalol was started at a dose of 160 mg once daily for 1 week, followed by a 24-hour recording. In the absence of any therapeutic effect, the same procedure was repeated with 320 mg, 480 mg, and 640 mg daily. Procainamide, 1 gm three times/day, was given or, if plasma concentrations were insufficient, 1.5 gm three times/day for 1 week. PVC control was obtained in 22 (67%) patients on sotalol, including all 12 with ischemic heart disease. Procainamide was successful in 13 (39%) patients. Effects on the number of attacks of ventricular tachycardia were achieved by both drugs in those patients where PVCs were reduced by at least 75%. Sotalol caused side effects in five patients, who therefore could not accept planned increases in dosage. Side effects were noted by 12 patients with procainamide. Nine patients responded to both drugs, seven to neither. Thirteen responded to sotalol only and four to procainamide only. We conclude that sotalol is a useful alternative to procainamide in controlling chronic PVCs, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease.", 
    "59": "The use of captopril in 19 patients with renal parenchymal disease and refractory hypertension was studied for a mean period of 12 months. There was a significant reduction in the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, with a reduction in the mean arterial pressure of 29 mmHg. The mean maintenance dose of captopril was 142 mg daily in three divided doses. All but one of the patients required a diuretic for satisfactory blood pressure control and 3 patients were also given a beta-blocker. In all patients a simplification of the previous therapeutic regimen was achieved. A significant rise in serum creatinine was noted in 2 patients, one of whom had to be withdrawn from the study. Despite the presence of renal functional impairment, proteinuria did not occur de novo nor did established proteinuria increase. Leukopenia was noted in any of the patients in this group.", 
    "60": "Oral glucose tolerance and pancreatic suppression tests were carried out in six young hyperthyroid men before treatment and 2-4 weeks after thyroid function tests returned to normal and in six normal men matched for age and weight. Glucose intolerance was present in the hyperthyroid individuals. It improved, but did not return to normal, after treatment. Insulin secretion was increased, and the peak values were delayed in the patients. Treatment did not influence the amount or pattern of the insulin response. Steady state plasma glucose levels (milligrams per dl +/- SEM) were significantly (P less than 0.001) higher in the hyperthyroid patients before treatment (128.6 +/- 2.4) than in the normal subjects (86.1 +/- 3.1). Although after treatment, steady state plasma glucose levels (116.1 +/- 2.7) decreased significantly (P less than 0.001), they remained higher than those in normal subjects (P less than 0.01). Therefore, insulin action was impaired in hyperthyroidism and had not returned to normal by 2-4 weeks after thyroid function tests were in the normal range.", 
    "61": "Using contrast-enhanced computed tomography, the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade were assessed on experimentally produced myocardial infarcts in dogs evaluated serially over the course of approximately 1 month. Infarct size, initial perfusion defect (jeopardized segment) and noninfarcted muscle mass were studied in two groups of conditioned mongrel dogs. Group 1 (n = 11) served as the control group and Group 2 (n = 10) was pretreated with propranolol (2 mg/kg). Each animal in the propranolol-treated group was given identical amounts of the agent twice daily for 7 days after coronary occlusion. Both groups developed increases in the noninfarcted muscle mass of the left ventricle (compensatory hypertrophy). The mean increase averaged 19.8% over 30 days when the two groups were included together. Infarct size was smaller in the propranolol-treated group, and averaged 28% less (p less than 0.05) than that of the control group 30 days after initial myocardial infarction. Thus, pharmacologic interventions were shown by computed tomography to alter the size of an acute experimental myocardial infarct, particularly when examined over the time course of infarct healing. Moreover, compensatory hypertrophy occurred in both the control and propranolol-treated groups.", 
    "62": "The effect of the catecholestrogen, 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1), on placental steroidogenesis was studied by incubating 2-OHE1 with placental explants for 24 hours and measuring the output of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). 2-OHE1 stimulated the accumulation of E2 and P4 in the media. This effect was inhibited by the alpha-adrenergic blocker, phenoxybenzamine, and the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol. We conclude that 2-OHE1 affects placental steroidogenesis and that this effect could possibly be mediated through adrenergic receptors.", 
    "63": "At least two developmental responses necessary to prepare the fetal lung to serve as a gas-exchange organ, the release of surface-active material and the reabsorption of alveolar water, can be stimulated by beta-adrenergic agonists. The sensitivity of these responses increases dramatically in late gestation. beta-Adrenergic receptors can be identified by radioligand binding and are present in human fetal lung as early as 16 weeks of gestation. The temporal relationship of the increases in both pulmonary beta-receptors and plasma-free cortisol in the fetal rabbit during gestation suggests that endogenous glucocorticoids may cause increased concentration of pulmonary beta-receptors. Treatment of pregnant rabbits at 24 or 25 days of gestation results in precocious increases in both fetal lung beta-receptors and agonist-specific, high-affinity binding. The increase in receptor concentration with glucocorticoid is not dependent on other endocrine response inasmuch as 0.1 microM dexamethasone increases beta-receptor concentrations at 24 and 48 hours of incubation in cultures of fetal rabbit lung organ. This effect of glucocorticoid to increase beta-receptor concentration and high-affinity binding may explain the increased fetal pulmonary beta-adrenergic response at term and may be responsible in part for the reduction in neonatal respiratory syndrome seen after antenatal glucocorticoid therapy.", 
    "64": "Cyclic nucleotides are universal intermediary agents of hormones in the target tissues, however mechanisms of the regulation of the cAMP and cGMP content in the cell are rather complex and still obscure. More data have appeared of late on the involvement of blood serum lipoproteins in the regulation of various intracellular processes including adenylate cyclase activity. Therefore the purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of adrenaline, hydrocortisone, glucagon, insulin and blood serum lipoproteins on the cAMP and cGMP content in rat liver surviving sections. An attempt was made to study a cooperative effect of the above hormones and lipoproteins of various classes. The results obtained have shown that adrenaline and glucagon raise the cAMP level in rat liver surviving sections. The effect of adrenaline is mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors. Insulin lowers an increases the level of cAMP in liver sections determined by the effect of glucagon. A decrease of the initial cAMP content in response to insulin occurs after a short lag period. High density lipoproteins (HDLP3) reduce the cAMP content in liver surviving sections. A cooperative effect of lipoproteins of a very low density and adrenaline (or hydrocortisone) in the regulation of the cAMP content in the rat liver was revealed. The cGMP content in rat liver surviving sections does not change under the influence of the above hormones and lipoproteins.", 
    "65": "In a previous report from our laboratory, visual assessment of wall motion in patients with coronary artery disease demonstrated no advantage for pindolol, a beta blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), over propranolol on impaired regional left ventricular (LV) function. In this study, we reanalyzed the radionuclide ventriculograms using a computer-assisted method of deriving regional ejection fraction. Use of normalized values allowed hypokinetic and normokinetic segments to be identified and examined separately. Pindolol (5-10 mg twice a day) was compared to propranolol (40-80 mg 4 times a day) in 23 patients using a randomized, crossover study design. Supine resting heart rate was reduced less (70 +/- 12 beats/min vs 63 +/- 10 beats/min, p less than 0.01) by pindolol; exercise heart rate was reduced equally by both agents. Derivation of normalized regional LV ejection fractions showed that 17 segments were hypokinetic at rest. Function of these segments increased (p less than 0.02) with pindolol. This improvement was not detected by visual assessment of regional wall motion. Thirty-seven segments were found to be hypokinetic during exercise and a significant (p less than 0.05) improvement in function occurred with pindolol and propranolol. In summary, derivation of normalized regional LV ejection fraction values allows the demonstration of significant improvement in resting LV function with pindolol, but not with propranolol in patients with regional dysfunction due to coronary artery disease. This advantage may provide a rationale for further evaluation of this agent in patients with more widespread ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "66": "The in vitro cardiac effects of DPI 201-106, a novel piperazinyl-indole, were investigated. DPI 201-106 produced concentration-dependent positive inotropic effects in guinea-pig and rat left atria, kitten, rabbit and guinea-pig papillary muscles and Langendorff perfused hearts of rabbits between 10(-7) and 3 X 10(-6) mol/l. During isometric twitches, contraction and relaxation phases were prolonged in guinea-pig left atria and right ventricular papillary muscles from kitten and guinea-pigs. Spontaneous sinus rate was decreased in right atria of guinea-pigs and rats. Coronary flow increased in rabbit isolated hearts. Functional refractory period was increased in left atria from guinea-pigs and rats with EC50 values of 1.7 and 0.24 mumol/l respectively. In electrophysiological measurements, DPI 201-106 prolonged the action potential duration (APD70) in guinea-pig papillary muscles up to 70% and in rabbit atria up to 120% at 3 mumol/l. Other action potential characteristics were not changed in guinea-pig papillary muscles but Vmax was decreased in rabbit left atria. The electrophysiological as well as the positive inotropic effects were stereoselective with the activity residing in the S-enantiomer. DPI 201-106 increased the Ca2+-sensitivity of skinned fibres from porcine trabecula septomarginalis with an EC50 of 0.2 nmol/l. DPI 201-106 dit not change cAMP levels in guinea-pig atria and rabbit papillary muscles. Slow action potentials were not induced by DPI 201-106 in partially depolarized guinea-pig papillary muscles. Phosphodiesterase activity of rat hearts was not inhibited by DPI 201-106 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. The presence of propranolol did not influence the inotropic potency of DPI 201-106 in guinea-pig atria. In conclusion, DPI 201-106 represents a novel type of positive inotropic agents with a synergistic sarcolemmal and intracellular mechanism of action.", 
    "67": "The enantiomers of 3-O-methyldobutamine, a metabolite of dobutamine, were evaluated for their alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor mediated effects in vitro in a variety of isolated organs and in radioligand binding studies. Neither enantiomer of 3-O-methyldobutamine possessed alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist activity in isolated guinea pig aorta. However, both enantiomers of 3-O-methyldobutamine were competitive alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, with the (+)-enantiomer being approximately 10-fold more potent than the (-)-enantiomer as assessed either in guinea pig aorta or by displacement of 3H-prazosin binding from alpha 1-adrenoceptors in rat cerebral cortex. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity of (+)-3-O-methyldobutamine was relatively potent and corresponded to a pA2 of 7.33 in guinea pig aorta and a -log Ki of 7.72 in radioligand binding studies. Neither enantiomer of 3-O-methyldobutamine possessed alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist activity in field-stimulated guinea pig ileum. Although (+)-3-O-methyldobutamine weakly inhibited the twitch response in field-stimulated guinea pig ileum, the response was not blocked by the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, and was found to result from weak anticholinergic activity (pA2 = 5.06). Neither enantiomer of 3-O-methyldobutamine possessed beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist activity in guinea pig atria, however the (+)-enantiomer was a weak noncompetitive antagonist at beta 1-adrenoceptors. In contrast, both enantiomers of 3-O-methyldobutamine were weak beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists in rat uterus, however these weak effects were not highly stereoselective, which was also confirmed in radioligand binding studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "The significance of anionic and cationic charges of glycocalyx, phospholipid or protein, etc. on the cell surface of the rat brain was examined for beta-adrenoceptors using the radioligand binding assay method. Thus, this experiment was designed to assess the effects of polymeric effectors, DNA, heparin, polymyxin B, histone, gelatin, colominic acid and bovine serum albumin (BSA), on the affinity of beta-adrenoceptors. The rat brain was used and the beta-adrenoceptor binding assay was carried out using 3H-dihydroalprenolol as a radioligand. Polymyxin B, DNA and heparin significantly caused a reduction in the maximum number of beta-adrenoceptors (Bmax), but only small changes were observed with histone, gelatin, BSA and colominic acid. Only DNA induced a decrease in the value of the dissociation constant (Kd) of beta-adrenoceptors. These results suggest that anionic or cationic charges in the environment of the receptor sites could have a crucial role in drug-receptor interaction.", 
    "69": "DBA/2 mice are genetically prone to audiogenic seizures and, when compared with seizure resistant C57BL/6 mice, were found to have an increased density of beta-adrenergic receptors in their midbrain at the age of peak seizure susceptibility. Propranolol, a beta-receptor blocking agent, attenuated all stages of the seizure syndrome. However, a comparison of the effects of its d- and l-isomers suggested that propranolol's anticonvulsant activity was due to its local anesthetic-like action. Pindolol, a more potent beta blocker that is at least 100 times less potent than propranolol with respect to local anesthetic-like activity, produced anticonvulsant effects in approximately the same systemic dose range as propranolol. This indicates that pindolol's anticonvulsant activity could be due to beta blockade and, taken together, these data suggest that beta-adrenergic receptors may play a role in the expression of audiogenic seizures in these animals.",

This review summarizes the data available on the adrenergic receptors. in addition, information is provided about the important function of these membrane receptors as control or modulator of dermatophysiology and dermatopathy.", 
    "71": "Treatment of Sprague-Dawley rats for 9 days with 15 micrograms/kg of tri-iodo-thyronine, 50 micrograms/kg of thyroxine (T4) or 500 micrograms/kg of thyrotropin-releasing hormone decreased the number of beta receptors in cerebral cortex as measured by dihydroalprenolol binding. The dissociation constants of dihydroalprenolol (3.5 nM) were not altered by the treatment. Only tri-iodo-thyronine and T4 administration resulted in a concomitant reduction of norepinephrine (NE) elicited cyclic AMP formation in cerebral cortical slices. This process required at least a 7-day treatment period and was dose-dependent. Application of 1 microgram of T4 per kg for 9 days significantly diminished the NE responsivity of the cyclic AMP synthesizing system. Dose-response curves with NE indicate a reduction of the maximal response after T4 treatment with no change in ED50. An almost additive interaction between the effects of T4 and a low dose (3 mg/kg) of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine was observed. Striking differences in the response of the adrenoceptor coupled adenylate cyclase to a 9-day T4 treatment were found when different rat strains, i.e., Fischer F-344, Long-Evans, Wistar and Sprague-Dawley were used. The hyperthyroid state of the animals was ascertained by measurements of plasma levels of tri-iodo-thyronine and T4. Down-regulation of NE sensitive adenylate cyclase by T4 treatment required intact synaptic structures because denervation by i.c.v. injection of 6-hydroxydopamine abolished the effect of T4 treatment. This is indicative of a postsynaptic localization of the down-regulated cyclic AMP generating system. The data stress the importance of the neuroendocrine system for adrenoceptor regulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "It has been claimed by other investigators that norepinephrine does not evoke a significant alpha adrenergic inotropic effect in human atria in contrast to epinephrine and phenylephrine, indicating a limitation of a possible functional role of the cardiac alpha adrenoceptors. We therefore characterized the inotropic effects of norepinephrine in isometrically contracting muscle strips from human atria obtained during open heart surgery. Both contraction and relaxation were studied by measuring developed tension and its first and second derivatives. Both the influence of propranolol and prazosin upon the inotropic responses to norepinephrine and the qualitative characteristics of the responses revealed that norepinephrine evoked both alpha and beta adrenergic inotropic effects. The alpha adrenergic response to norepinephrine was qualitatively different from the beta adrenergic effect and qualitatively similar to the alpha adrenergic effect of norepinephrine observed in other mammalian species. Although the alpha adrenergic effect was marked, the beta adrenergic effect was the dominating one as has also been found in other species. It is concluded that also in human atria norepinephrine evokes inotropic effects through both alpha and beta adrenoceptors.", 
    "73": "Restraint stress reduces the cyclic AMP (cAMP) response to norepinephrine (NE) in slices of the rat cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. This effect is found after repeated but not single exposure to stress and persists for at least 24 hr poststress. The magnitude of the reduction is dose-dependent in that greater decreases are found after higher frequencies and longer durations of restraint as well as after more disturbance during the stress. Analysis of the NE-cAMP dose-response curve indicates that the stress reduces the maximum cAMP response to NE but does not increase the EC50 value of NE. The cAMP response to isoproterenol is only slightly affected by the stress. No effect is observed on specific [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding in either brain region at 24 hr poststress. These results suggest that repeated restraint stress produces a selective persistent reduction of the function of brain non-beta adrenergic receptors. This effect may be mediated by an increased release of adrenocorticotropic hormone as chronic infusion of the latter hormone mimics the action of stress on cAMP responses to catecholamines. An increased release of brain NE may also be involved as repeated administration of the NE-reuptake inhibiting antidepressant, desmethylimipamine, reduces the function of non-beta as well as beta adrenergic receptors as evidenced by reductions of both the NE- and isoproterenol-cAMP responses.", 
    "74": "Perinephritic hypertension was produced in dogs by wrapping one kidney with silk and removing the contralateral kidney 1 week later. Mean arterial pressure rose from 104 +/- 3 to 156 +/- 11 mm Hg, while left ventricular free wall weight, normalized for body weight, was increased by 49%. Muscarinic, cholinergic receptor density measured with [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate, fell in hypertensive left ventricles (181 +/- 19 fmol/mg, n = 6; p less than 0.01) as compared with that found in normal left ventricles (272 +/- 16 fmol/mg, n = 8), while receptor affinity was not changed. The beta-adrenergic receptor density, measured by binding studies with [3H]-dihydroalprenolol, rose in the hypertensive left ventricles (108 +/- 10 fmol/mg, n = 7; p less than 0.01) as compared with that found in normal left ventricles (68.6 +/- 5.2 fmol/mg, n = 15), while beta-adrenergic receptor affinity decreased in the hypertensive left ventricles (10.4 +/- 1.2 nM) compared with that found in the normal left ventricles (5.0 +/- 0.7 nM). Plasma norepinephrine levels were similar in the two groups, but myocardial norepinephrine levels were depressed (p less than 0.05) in dogs with hypertension. Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy induced by long-term aortic banding in dogs resulted in elevations in beta-adrenergic receptor density (115 +/- 14 fmol/mg) and decreases in affinity (10.4 +/- 2.2 nM) similar to those observed in the dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy induced by hypertension. Thus, our results suggest that perinephritic hypertension in the dog induces divergent effects on cholinergic and beta-adrenergic receptor density. The increased beta-adrenergic receptor density and decreased affinity may be a characteristic of left ventricular hypertrophy rather than hypertension.", 
    "75": "Catecholamines facilitate ventricular defibrillation in animals. We examined the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation and blockade on ventricular defibrillation threshold in anesthetized dogs. Calibrated shocks were delivered between epicardial and superior vena caval electrodes, and defibrillation threshold was measured before and after administration of isoproterenol and propranolol. Eight dogs (group 1) received isoproterenol before propranolol. Nine dogs (group 2) received propranolol before isoproterenol. In group 1, the minimum energy required to defibrillate before isoproterenol was 10.6 +/- 1.7 (SE) J and decreased to 5.9 +/- 1.3 with isoproterenol (P less than 0.001). In group 2, the minimum energy required to defibrillate was 8.3 +/- 2.4 J before propranolol and increased to 10.7 +/- 2.2 after propranolol (P less than 0.001). In group 1, propranolol after isoproterenol increased defibrillation threshold (P less than 0.07), whereas in group 2 isoproterenol after propranolol produced no significant change in defibrillation threshold. Thus beta-stimulation decreased defibrillation threshold significantly in the anesthetized dog heart, an effect that was blocked by propranolol. Conversely, propranolol increased defibrillation threshold, an effect that occurred despite prior beta-stimulation, probably because of the short half-life of isoproterenol.", 
    "76": "para-(Bromoacetamidyl)benzylcarazolol (pBABC) was synthesized and found to be an extremely potent affinity label for beta-adrenergic receptors. Its interaction with mammalian (rabbit and hamster lung) and nonmammalian (turkey and frog erythrocyte) beta-adrenergic receptors was similar, displaying EC50 values of 400-900 pM for inhibiting 125I-cyanopindolol binding to these receptors. pBABC reduced the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in frog erythrocyte membranes, without any change in the affinity of the remaining sites for [125I]iodocyanopindolol. pBABC has been radioiodinated. As assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, this affinity probe specifically labeled the beta-adrenergic peptide of a purified preparation of hamster lung, with high efficiency (approximately 40%) and with a pharmacological specificity characteristic of an interaction at the beta 2-adrenergic receptor ligand-binding site. Comparison of the proteolyzed products derived from purified receptor labeled with [125I]pBABC and with the photoaffinity agent [125I]p-azidobenzylcarazolol suggested that covalent labeling of the beta-adrenergic receptor by these probes occurs at similar domains of the beta-adrenergic receptor. Because of the much higher level of incorporation of this affinity probe as opposed to photosensitive probes, pBABC should prove to be a useful tool for structural studies of purified beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "77": "In view of our previous demonstration that T3 promptly increases the cAMP concentration in freshly isolated rat thymocytes in vitro, we studied the effects of T3 on adenylate cyclase activity in a crude thymocyte plasma membrane preparation. In common with adenylate cyclase in other tissues, the enzyme in rat thymocytes was activated by NaF, GTP, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, and beta-adrenergic agonists and was inhibited by high concentrations of calcium. In the presence of 1 microM Ca+2, T3 induced a time-dependent increase in adenylate cyclase activity that was statistically significant between 1 and 2 min and maximum between 2 and 5 min after hormone addition. As judged from observations made at 5 min, the effect of T3 was dose dependent over the range 1 nM to 1 microM. The stimulatory effect of T3 was calcium dependent, since it was abolished by EGTA at a concentration (0.5 mM) that did not alter basal enzyme activity, and the effect of T3 in the presence of EGTA was restored by the addition of either 0.1 or 1 mM Ca+2. As judged from the lack of hydrolysis of added cAMP, phosphodiesterase activity in the assay mixture was nil in both the presence and absence of T3. Both epinephrine and the specific beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, but not the alpha-agonist phenylephrine, increased adenylate cyclase activity, and their effects appeared to be additive to that of T3. The beta-adrenergic antagonist L-alprenolol, in doses that did not influence basal adenylate cyclase activity, produced a dose-related inhibition of the stimulatory effect of T3 and of the effects of epinephrine and isoproterenol as well. Neither D-alprenolol nor the alpha-antagonist phentolamine had any effect. Various thyronine analogs displayed a rank order of potency in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity very similar to their relative potencies in increasing cAMP concentration in the intact thymocyte. These findings reveal that T3 stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in rat thymocyte plasma membrane preparations. With respect to calcium dependence, inhibition by alprenolol, and response to thyronine analogs, this effect has properties similar to those of the increase in cellular cAMP concentration induced by T3 in the intact thymocyte. It can be concluded, therefore, that the effect of T3 to increase 2-deoxyglucose uptake by the rat thymocyte in vitro, a response consequent to an increase in thymocyte cAMP concentration, derives from a stimulatory effect of the hormone on adenylate cyclase itself.",

Prazosin also blocks the elevation in pineal melatonin content after dark onset, but does not significantly alter the rise in N-acetyltransferase activity or the elevation in pineal N-acetylserotonin content. Since the nocturnal elevation in N-acetyltransferase, a neurally regulated event, was unaltered, this suggests that prazosin does not significantly impair the transmission of neural signals from the eye to the gland, but does act on pineal alpha 1-adrenoceptors to block melatonin production. This is supported by binding studies in ovine pineal membranes using [125I] iodo-2-[beta-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylaminomethyl]tetralone, which revealed that binding is rapid, reversible, saturable, and stereo-specific. Saturation studies indicated the presence of a single class of binding sites, with an equilibrium binding constant (Kd) of 32 +/- 6 pM and a maximum binding of 139 +/- 19 fmol/mg protein. The relative potencies of several adrenergic agonists and antagonists in competition studies indicated that the receptor belongs to the alpha 1-subclass of adrenoceptors. Together, these data suggest that melatonin synthesis in the sheep pineal gland is controlled in part by an alpha 1-adrenoceptor mechanism at a step beyond N-acetylation.", 
    "79": "We have previously reported that left ventricular hypertrophy in two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K-1C RHRs) was associated with diminished inotropic responsiveness to isoproterenol and glucagon, suggesting an alteration in the receptor-adenylate cyclase cascade. The present study was performed to investigate the hypothesis that in these same hearts, inotropic responses to alpha-adrenergic stimuli could be enhanced as a compensatory mechanism. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation was achieved by graded phenylephrine infusion (1.02 to 41.2 microM/min) in the presence of propranolol (10(-7) M). The inotropic response was evaluated in the isovolumetric isolated rat heart (Langendorff preparation) paced at 260 beats/min. Results showed a significantly reduced inotropic response to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in 2K-1C RHR hearts irrespective of perfusion pressure (50 or 80 mm Hg [PP50 or PP80]) (+427.5 +/- 62.1 vs +1236 +/- 216.4 mm Hg X sec-1 at PP50, p less than .01 and +339 +/- 98.3 vs +1440 +/- 254 mg Hg X sec-1 at PP80, p less than .001) even when comparison was made at equivalent myocardial flow rates (RHR hearts perfused at 80 mm Hg vs control hearts perfused at 50 mm Hg). Quantitative assessment of number of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors (3H-prazosin binding) showed a significant decrease compared with that in age-matched sham-operated normotensive control rats (45 +/- 2.5 vs 64 +/- 1.7 fmol/mg protein, p less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "80": "Prolactin (PRL) receptors have been identified recently on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) and may be involved in the regulation of cell-mediated immunity. Cyclosporine (CsA), an immunosuppressive cyclic endecapeptide utilized to prolong graft survival in human organ transplant patients, affects PRL binding to MNC. At concentrations of CsA from 10(-10) through 10(-8) M, the amount of PRL bound to MNC markedly increased to ca. 400% of controls, whereas CsA concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-5) M totally inhibited PRL binding to lymphocytes. The ability of low concentrations of CsA to enhance PRL binding was temperature-dependent and did not occur when binding assays were conducted at 4 degrees C. PRL displaced [3H]CsA from lymphocytes with ca. 50% displacement at 10(-9) M PRL and total displacement at concentrations of 10(-7), 10(-6), and 10(-5) M. Growth hormone did not displace [3H]CsA in similar experiments. CsA also did not alter the binding of a beta-receptor antagonist to MNC, again suggesting that CsA was specific in its antagonism of PRL binding. A CsA analog with no immunosuppressive action, cyclosporin H, did not alter PRL binding to MNC. Furthermore, PRL receptors were demonstrated on four cell lines of human and mouse origin. Finally, PRL receptors were identified on purified populations of T and B lymphocytes isolated from human spleens, and CsA again inhibited PRL binding at concentrations of 10(-7) and 10(-6) M. The presence of PRL receptors on T and B lymphocytes suggests that PRL may be involved in the regulation of humoral and cell-mediated immunity, and that one effect of CsA on immune function may be its ability to inhibit the effects of PRL action on these lymphocytes.", 
    "81": "The adenylate cyclase of an adrenocortical carcinoma of the rat is activated not only by ACTH but also by beta-adrenergic agonists, which bind to ectopic beta-adrenergic receptors not present in normal rat adrenal cortex. Previous reports examining possible beta-adrenergic control of adenylate cyclase in human adrenocortical carcinomas failed to demonstrate beta-adrenergic receptor-linked enzyme activity. We studied six human adrenal carcinomas and normal adrenal cortex from three subjects for beta-adrenergic agonist-sensitive adenylate cyclase and beta-adrenergic binding sites. Three of the six carcinomas had adenylate cyclase responses to both ACTH and beta-agonists. Two tumors were ACTH responsive but not beta-agonist responsive; one tumor responded to beta-agonists but not to ACTH. Adenylate cyclase activity of normal adrenal cortex from three subjects was stimulated by ACTH but not by beta-agonists. In membrane preparations from three tumors with beta-agonist-sensitive adenylate cyclase, the radiolabeled beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I]pindolol bound specifically and with high affinity (Kd = 38-83 pM) to a single class of binding sites which showed saturation with ligand concentration, reversibility of binding, pharmacological specificity, and stereospecificity. Normal cortex and one tumor without beta-adrenergic agonist-sensitive adenylate cyclase had no specific binding of [125I]pindolol. These results indicate that malignant transformation of adrenal cortex in man is frequently but not invariably associated with the appearance of ectopic beta-adrenergic receptors functionally linked to adenylate cyclase. Loss of ACTH-responsive adenylate cyclase may also occur simultaneously with the development of beta-adrenergic receptor-linked adenylate cyclase."
