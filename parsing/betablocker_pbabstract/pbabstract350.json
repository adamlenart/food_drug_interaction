During a 18 month period, intraocular pressure and visual field (measured by Humphrey automated perimetry) were measured every 3 months, and the measurements obtained in the two groups were compared. Analysis of the results revealed a considerable reduction in intraocular pressure in the carteolol group as compared with the control group. The progression of mean deviation tended to be less in the carteolol group, but the intergroup difference in this respect was not statistically significant. However, increase in corrected pattern standard deviation was clearly less pronounced in the carteolol group than in the control group. These results supported the conclusion that carteolol is effective in inhibiting deterioration of the local visual field. This is attributed to increased ocular perfusion due to diminished intraocular pressure, as well as an inhibitory effect upon vasoconstriction in the optic nerve head due to intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, preventing decrease in papillary blood flow and adverse effects upon ocular circulation.", 
    "1": "The densities of subtypes of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) receptors were determined in the CNS of alcohol-naive alcohol-preferring P and -nonpreferring NP lines of rats. Autoradiography studies were undertaken to measure the densities of 5-HT1B sites labelled with 100 pM [125I](-)-iodocyanopindolol, 5-HT3 sites labelled with 2 nM [3H]LY 278584, and D1 sites labelled with 1 nM[3H]SCH 23390. Membrane binding, using tissue combined from the olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, and nucleus accumbens, was carried out to determine Kd and B max values for the binding of 0.25-8.0 nM[3H]7-OH DPAT to D3 sites. Among the 48 regions measured for differences in 5-HT1B recognition sites, statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found only in the cingulate and retrosplenial cortices, in the lateral and medial septum, and in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, with lower values being found in the P than the NP line. There were no significant differences in the regional CNS densities of D1 or 5-HT3 sites between the P and NP lines. There were also no differences between the rat lines in the Kd or Bmax values for [3H]7-OH DPAT binding to D3 sites. The lower densities of 5-HT1B sites in the CNS of the P compared to the NP rats may be a result of reduced numbers of 5-HT1B presynaptic autoreceptors as well as postsynaptic receptors in the P line. The observation that there are no differences in the amount of radioligand binding to D1, 5-HT3, and D3 sites between the P and NP lines suggests that the disparate alcohol drinking behaviors of these two lines is not associated with an innate alteration in the densities of these receptor subtypes.", 
    "2": "Class III antiarrhythmic agents are characterized by their ability to prolong action potential and increase refractoriness. The use of these drugs namely, sotalol hydrochloride and amiodarone hydrochloride, is rising. Both agents are effective for treating a range of ventricular arrhythmias, and amiodarone in particular has been linked with improved mortality in certain patient populations compared with class I agents. Sotalol and amiodarone have individual, complex pharmacologic profiles. As a result, there are also differences in their side effects and proarrhythmic actions. Sotalol is associated with side effects related to beta-adrenergic blockade and an incidence of proarrhythmia similar to that of class Ia agents. Amiodarone is associated with pulmonary toxicity and other adverse events, but rarely induces torsades de pointes. These agents must be differentiated from pure class III potassium channel blockers, such as the dextro isomer form of sotalol, which is linked to increased mortality compared with placebo in post-myocardial infarction patients with reduced ventricular function or a history of heart failure.",

Mean and range of IOP curve (8.00 a.m.-8.00 p.m.), pupil diameter, Schirmer I, basal secretion test and BUT values were recorded at baseline and after 2 weeks of topical administration of ketanserin or placebo twice daily. The alternative treatment was given 2 weeks later and the same protocol was repeated.",

We have previously shown enhanced tobramycin susceptibility of most strains in the presence of the drug amiloride. Others have shown similar findings in the presence of cationic agents with amine groups. To examine the relationship of substituted amine drug structure and synergy potential with tobramycin, the in vitro activity of 45 non-antibiotic substituted amine and related compounds in the presence and absence of tobramycin was studied. Very few agents had intrinsic antimicrobial action but many were very synergistic with tobramycin. Dichloroisoproterenol and propranolol were the most synergistic. Sympathomimetic, imidazoline agents, phenothiazenes, and thioxanthenes varied greatly. Exploration of these compounds may provide an avenue for treating antibiotic-resistant B. cepacia.", 
    "8": "Repeated administration of propranolol (PL) to rats causes the inhibition of cytochrome P450-2D (P450-2D) enzyme. We recently found that 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH-PL) was biotransformed to 1,4-naphthoquinone (1,4-NQ) by superoxide (SO) anions in medium containing rat liver microsomes and NADPH and proposed that the binding of the quinone to P450-2D apoproteins might be one of mechanisms for the enzyme inhibition [Narimatsu et al. (1995) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 8, 721-728]. In this study, we have searched for possible sources of SO for the conversion of 4-OH-PL to 1,4-NQ in rat liver microsomes and determined the radioactivity covalently bound to microsomal proteins after incubation of radioactive PL and 4-OH-PL with rat liver microsomes. Elimination of 4-OH-PL from a mixture containing microsomes and NADPH was suppressed by carbon monoxide. Antibodies raised to P450-2B1 and -3A2 partially, and antibody against NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (fp2) markedly suppressed the reaction. 1,4-NQ was formed concomitantly with 4-OH-PL elimination by a reconstituted preparation of fp2. Binding studies using naphthalene ring (NR)- and side chain (SC)-radiolabeled PL and 4-OH-PL showed that radioactivity covalently bound to microsomal proteins was much higher from 4-OH-PL than from PL for the NR-labeled compounds, but higher from PL than from 4-OH-PL for the SC-labeled compounds. These results suggest that the 4-OH-PL formed from PL by P450-2D enzyme is converted to 1,4-NQ with loss of the side chain, and the 1,4-NQ accounts for most of the radioactivity covalently bound to microsomal proteins, including the P450-2D enzymes. The SO for conversion of 4-OH-PL to 1,4-NQ is supplied mainly by fp2 with some contribution by P450 enzymes.", 
    "9": "We evaluated the cardiovascular effects of YM430, a novel 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative with beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity, in dogs and rats. In anesthetized dogs, YM430 (0.01-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) dose-dependently decreased mean blood pressure, total peripheral resistance and double product without increasing the heart rate. YM430 (0.01-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) increased coronary artery as well as vertebral artery blood flow, whereas its effects on carotid, mesenteric, femoral and renal blood flow were small. At the same dose range as that which induced vasodilation effects, YM430 had little effect on the max. dp/dt or PQ-interval. In conscious dogs, YM430 (0.1-1 mg/kg, i.v.) produced dose-dependent hypotension with tachycardia. In conscious rats, oral dosing of YM430 (100 mg/kg p.o.) produced a long-lasting hypotensive effect with slight tachycardia. YM430 also inhibited isoproterenol (0.1 micrograms/kg i.v.)-induced tachycardia. These two effects of YM430 may be attributable to its calcium entry blocking and beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocking activity, respectively. The time course of the hypotensive (calcium entry blocking) effect of YM430 after oral dosing was very similar to that of its inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia (beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocking effect). These results indicate that the ratio of the two activities (calcium entry blocking and beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocking) of YM430 is constant after oral administration. In conclusion, YM430 could be both an antianginal and antihypertensive agent, because of its dual activities.",

These measurements were repeated after 1, 6, 12, and 24 h. All the patients fulfilled the therapeutic goals. No statistical difference was found between epinephrine and norepinephrine-dobutamine for systemic hemodynamic measurements. Considering metabolic and tonometric measurements and compared to baseline values, after 6 h, epinephrine infusion was associated with an increase in lactate levels (from 3.1 +/- 1.5 to 5.9 +/- 1.0 mmol/l;p < 0.01), while lactate levels decreased in the norepinephrine-dobutamine group (from 3.1 +/- 1.5 to 2.7 +/- 1.0 mmol/l). The lactate/pyruvate ratio increased in the epinephrine group (from 15.5 +/- 5.4 to 21 +/- 5.8; p < 0.01) and did not change in the norepinephrine-dobutamine group (13.8 +/- 5 to 14 +/- 5.0). Gastric mucosal pH (pHi) decreased (from 7.29 +/- 0.11 to 7.16 +/- 0.07; p < 0.01) and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) gap (tonometer PCO2-arterial PCO2) increased (from 10 +/- 2.7 to 14 +/- 2.7 mmHg; p < 0.01) in the epinephrine group. In the norepinephrine-dobutamine group pHi (from 7.30 +/- 0.11 to 7.35 +/- 0.07) and the PCO2 gap (from 10 +/- 3.0 to 4 +/- 2.0 mmHg) were normalized within 6 h (p < 0.01). The decrease in pHi and the increase in the lactate/pyruvate ratio in the epinephrine group was transient, since it returned to normal within 24 h.",

Nevertheless, gastric mucosal acidosis and global metabolic changes observed in epinephrine-treated patients are consistent with a markedly inadequate, although transient, splanchnic oxygen utilization. The metabolic and splanchnic effects of the combination of norepinephrine and dobutamine in hyperdynamic dopamine-resistant septic shock appeared to be more predictable and more appropriate to the current goals of septic shock therapy than those of epinephrine alone.", 
    "17": "Beta-blockers are a first line therapy for neurocardiac syncope, but are not always effective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differential autonomic responses to orthostasis predict the response of patients with neurocardiac syncope to beta-adrenergic blockade. We computed the RMS successive difference of the RR intervals (RMSSD: a measure of cardiac parasympathetic tone) during supine and upright phases of the initial tilt test in 28 patients with syncope and positive tilt tests who were treated with atenolol. Follow-up tilt testing was performed to assess the efficacy of the drug in preventing tilt induced neurocardiac syncope. RMSSD did not differ at baseline (supine) between those who did (n = 20) and did not (n = 8) respond to beta-blockade. However, withdrawal of parasympathetic tone in response to tilt varied inversely with age (r = -0.69; P < 0.01). Reduced age adjusted parasympathetic withdrawal during orthostasis was associated with a 47% versus 8% risk of beta-blockade failure (odds ratio = 11; P = 0.01). Patients with diminished age adjusted parasympathetic withdrawal during orthostatic stress are less likely to respond to beta-blocker therapy of neurocardiac syncope than their counterparts. This may reflect a correspondingly greater sympathetic response to orthostasis in these patients, but the mechanism for this interaction is undetermined.",

Detailed comparisons of the 2 drug groups with the placebo group revealed that, after adjusting for individual and order effects, only the mean decrease in tremor due to ingestion of propranolol was a statistically significant trend (P = .03, F test). Although caffeine caused a larger mean increase in percent magnitude change in tremor than placebo, this trend was not statistically significant (P = .34, F test).

    "26": "In previous studies, using laser Doppler techniques, the authors have demonstrated a duration-dependent reduction in skin blood flow reserve at sites of nutritive (NUTR) perfusion that occurs in diabetes and correlates with the presence of diabetic retinopathy and proteinuria. They speculated that it might be possible to reverse this decrease in blood flow by using agents with peripheral vasodilating properties. They chose the calcium channel blocking agent isradipine as a prototype. As a contrast agent, they chose atenolol, which has an equivalent antihypertensive effect but minimal peripheral vasodilating properties. They studied 24 diabetic hypertensive patients in a randomized, two-way crossover design. They assigned patients randomly to one or the other active drug and titrated to a maximum tolerated maintenance dose. Skin blood flow was measured at the end of the titration and maintenance phases. Patients then entered a four-week washout period, followed by crossover to the alternative drug, and measurements were repeated. At baseline, the twenty-four-hour mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure was 150 +/- 2 mm Hg with a twenty-four-hour mean diastolic blood pressure of 93 +/- 1 mm Hg. Thermally stimulated skin blood flow reserve was about 50% lower in these patients as compared with an age-, sex-, and weight-matched group of 28 nondiabetic, nonhypertensive patients. There was no difference in skin blood flow between the two groups at basal skin temperature or at a controlled temperature of 35 degrees C. Both atenolol and isradipine successfully lowered blood pressure in the study patients. There was a slightly greater decrease in systolic blood pressure with isradipine and a greater decrease in heart rate with atenolol. Neither isradipine nor atenolol treatment affected skin blood flow values at the maximal 44 degrees C temperature. However, at basal skin temperature and at 35 degrees C, isradipine-treated patients had substantial increases in skin blood flow at NUTR sites. For example, skin blood flow at the knee at 35 degrees C with isradipine treatment was 3.1 +/- 0.4 mL/min/100 g compared with 1.1 +/- 0.2 with atenolol, 1.3 +/- 0.1 with placebo, and 0.9 +/- 0.1 for the nondiabetic controls (all P < 0.01). The authors found a twofold to threefold increase in basal skin blood flow at NUTR sites with isradipine treatment. This degree of increase is substantially greater than that previously demonstrated by their group using pentoxifylline. Locally reduced skin blood flow is a factor in promoting skin breakdown and delayed healing. Further study is needed to explore the possibility that isradipine treatment may enhance healing of diabetic skin ulcers.",

The biphasic reflex tracheal response (constriction followed by dilatation) occurred during bronchoconstriction induced by inhalation of ovalbumin antigen (OA) in sensitized guinea pigs. 2. The reflex tracheal constriction was largely reduced by atropine, and the dilatation was inhibited by propranolol and N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). The noradrenaline, adrenaline, cyclic AMP, and cyclic GMP contents in the tracheal segment were significantly higher during reflex tracheal dilatation. 3. These findings suggest that cholinergic nerves may mediate reflex tracheal constriction and that adrenergic and NOergic nerves may mediate the ensuing reflex tracheal dilatation.",

    "33": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the new method of low-energy, catheter-based intracardiac cardioversion in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and to compare 2 different lead positions. Accordingly, we prospectively studied 80 consecutive patients with chronic AF (9.8 +/- 7.9 months) who were randomly assigned to undergo internal cardioversion either via defibrillation electrodes placed in the right atrium and coronary sinus (coronary sinus group) or via defibrillation electrodes placed in the right atrium and left pulmonary artery (pulmonary artery group). Intracardiac shocks were delivered by an external defibrillator synchronized to the QRS complex. After conversion, all patients were treated orally with sotalol (mean daily dose, 189 +/- 63 mg/day). For conversion to sinus rhythm, the overall mean energy requirement was 5.6 +/- 3.1 J. In the coronary sinus group, cardioversion was achieved in 35 of 38 patients at a mean energy level of 4.1 +/- 2.3 J (range 1.0 to 9.9), and in the pulmonary artery group in 39 of 42 patients with 7.2 +/- 3.1 J (range 2.5 to 14.8). Although there was no difference with regard to success rate, the energy differed significantly between the 2 groups (p < 0.01). Mean lead impedance was 56.4 +/- 7.0 omega and 54.6 +/- 8.5 omega, respectively (p = NS). No serious complications were observed in either lead group. At a mean follow-up of 14.2 +/- 7.0 months, 54% and 56%, respectively, of patients who had been converted successfully remained in sinus rhythm. Thus, low-energy biphasic shocks delivered between the right atrium and coronary sinus or pulmonary artery are equally effective for cardioversion of patients with chronic AF. The energy requirements for conversion from a pulmonary artery electrode position are higher than for the coronary sinus position.", 
    "34": "The APSI trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of 1 year of treatment by acebutolol in high-risk patients who had survived an acute myocardial infarction. At 1 year there was a statistically significant 48% relative reduction in total mortality (p = 0.019) in favor of acebutolol. In 1995 a long-term mortality survey was undertaken through an administrative inquiry and contacts with investigators. The vital status of 586 of the 607 (96.5%) patients enrolled was known at the cutoff date and all these patients were followed up for at least 5 years. During follow-up (in-trial and post-trial period), 74 deaths (24.8%) occurred in the acebutolol group and 96 (31.1%) in the placebo group (p = 0.10). No difference between the 2 groups was observed for the number of deaths that occurred after the end of the trial: 55 deaths (19.6%) among the 281 survivors in the acebutolol group and 59 deaths (21.7%) (p = 0.70) among the 272 survivors in the placebo group. The annual hazard rate (annual death rate), calculated year by year using the actuarial method, was significantly different (p < 0.01) only for the first year and was not significantly different thereafter.

    "35": "In long-term intervention studies on renal function outcome an initial decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may occur after starting therapy. If this initial GFR decline is the result of a treatment-induced hemodynamic change reflecting a fall in intraglomerular pressure, it should be reversible after treatment withdrawal, even after long-term treatment. In fact, it could be beneficial for renal function in the long term. We therefore studied systemic and renal hemodynamics in 40 non-diabetic patients with impaired renal function before treatment, during four years treatment with either atenolol or enalapril, and after withdrawal of that treatment. The acute change in GFR 12 weeks after start of treatment varied widely from -11 to + 11 ml/min (mean +/- SD -1.0 +/- 4.1 ml/min, NS). After four years of treatment, withdrawal for 12 weeks resulted in a rise in GFR of +2.2 +/- 5.4 ml/min, P = 0.011, again with a wide range of +14 to -6 ml/min). The initial fall in GFR was related to the rise after withdrawal (r = 0.32, P < 0.05). Interestingly, the acute treatment induced change in GFR correlated with the long-term slope, such that a patient with a greater initial decline in GFR showed a more stable course during the follow up (r = -0.36, P < 0.05). The patients were arbitrarily divided in group A (N = 20), with the largest initial treatment-induced fall in GFR, and group B (N = 20), with the smallest initial fall in GFR. Group A had a significantly less steep slope than group B (-0.41 +/- 1.52 vs. -2.09 +/- 2.79 ml/min/year, P = 0.023) during the four year follow-up. In group A GFR increased again after withdrawal of treatment (+3.8 +/- 5.6 ml/min, P = 0.011) whereas it did not change in group B (+0.5 +/- 4.0 ml/min, NS). As a consequence, GFR post-treatment was not different compared to pre-treatment in group A (-2.5 +/- 7.2 ml/min, NS), whereas it was 5.9 +/- 12.1 ml/min lower in group B (P = 0.023). Patients treated with enalapril had a similar response as patients treated with atenolol. In conclusion, an initial fall in GFR after starting antihypertensive treatment in patients with a mild to moderate renal function impairment (GFR 30 to 90 ml/min) is reversible even after years of treatment, suggesting that this therapy-induced fall is of hemodynamic and not of structural origin. This initial GFR fall was associated with a subsequent stable renal function. These data lead to the hypothesis that the initial fall in GFR in response to antihypertensive therapy reflects renal protection.",

Arrest was achieved 45 to 60 seconds after beginning the infusion of esmolol. Mechanical arrest was achieved before electrical arrest. In the second protocol, dose-response curves were obtained using isolated (Langendorff) rat and rabbit (n = 6) hearts. The concentrations of esmolol varied from 0.084 to 6.7 mmol/L and from 0.12 to 1.45 mmol/L in the rat and rabbit heart experiments, respectively. In the third protocol, the effects of 20 minutes of normothermic (37 degrees C) ischemia on the function of isolated rat hearts perfused with esmolol-containing Krebs solution were compared with those using high-potassium (25 mmol/L) Krebs solution. Group A subjects (n = 9) received the ischemic injury after being perfused (and arrested) for 20 minutes with either esmolol or potassium (KCl, 25 mmol/L). Group B subjects (n = 10) received the same ischemic insult before being perfused with either esmolol or potassium. Esmolol-treated hearts showed better recovery than those receiving potassium, in terms of +/- dP/dt (p < 0.01), left ventricular systolic pressure (p < 0.01), and left ventricular developed pressure (p < 0.009). Finally, the fourth protocol was done to evaluate the effects of esmolol in a clinically relevant experimental model.

Shortly thereafter, these 19 patients still showed a paradoxic pulse > or = 20 mm Hg, relevant pericardial effusion (24 +/- 7 mm [mean +/- SD]) and comparable elevation of right and left ventricular filling pressures (15.8 +/- 3.9 and 15.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg, respectively). Subsequent management included bed rest (8.2 +/- 4.8 days) and control of systolic blood pressure (< or = 120 mm Hg) with beta-adrenergic blocking agents as tolerated (n = 12). Four patients died, and autopsy in three revealed a rupture that was sealed in two. A sealed rupture was also seen at thoracotomy in 2 other patients who, like the remaining 13, survived for 52.5 +/- 35.2 months.",

    "44": "This study was performed to evaluate whether iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy could predict the response to beta-blocker therapy in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Beta-Blocker therapy is effective in some patients with DCM. MIBG myocardial scintigraphy has also been suggested to be useful in evaluating the severity of myocardial damage in DCM. However, no data exist on whether MIBG imaging can be used to predict which patients with DCM will respond to beta-blocker therapy. We prospectively evaluated whether MIBG myocardial imaging was useful in predicting responses to beta-blocker therapy in patients with DCM. MIBG imaging was performed in 45 patients with DCM (35 men, 10 women, aged 13 to 68 years) before the start of bisoprolol. The heart to mediastinum (H/M) MIBG uptake ratio was evaluated on initial and delayed images, and the percent washout rate of myocardial MIBG was also obtained from these data. Of the 45 patients, 30 (67%) responded to beta-blocker therapy, whereas 2 were resistant and 13 showed progression of heart failure or died of heart failure. By logistic regression analysis, the H/M uptake ratio on delayed images was seen to be a good predictor of the response to beta-blocker therapy with a threshold of 1.7 (sensitivity = 91%, specificity = 92%, accuracy = 91%, positive and negative predictive value = 97% and 80%, respectively). These results indicate that an H/M ratio > 1.7 on the delayed MIBG myocardial scintigraphic images provides a useful indication of whether patients with DCM will respond to beta-blocker therapy.",

    "49": "The diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia has become much more important with the advent of radiofrequency ablation. This is usually best done at presentation in an acute setting. A 12-lead electrocardiogram should be a routine aid in making the diagnosis. A continuous rhythm strip must be obtained during administration of adenosine and at the termination of tachycardia. Most recent treatment guidelines would include adenosine as first-line therapy. If adenosine fails to restore normal sinus rhythm, diltiazem or a beta blocker should then be considered. If there is significant heart failure, digoxin may be useful. In the presence of wide complexes, agents that produce atrioventricular nodal block should be avoided.", 
    "50": "beta-Blockers are known to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy by lowering arterial pressure. Moreover, in individuals with diabetic nephropathy, antihypertensive agents that provide sustained reductions in proteinuria slow the rate of decline in renal function compared with agents without this antiproteinuric effect. To examine whether differential effects on proteinuria affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy, we conducted a randomized study that compared the effects of a heart rate-lowering calcium channel blocker, sustained-release verapamil, with those of a beta-blocker, atenolol, on the progression of diabetic renal disease. The primary end point of the study was a change in creatinine clearance slope. Thirty-four African Americans with the following inclusion criteria were randomized to one of the two groups: serum creatinine greater than 1.4 mg/dL, proteinuria greater than 1500 mg/d, longer than a 5-year history of both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and exclusion of other renal diseases. Goal blood pressure was less than 140/90 mm Hg. All subjects received loop diuretics as second line agents to help achieve the blood pressure goal. Twenty-four-hour urinary protein and sodium excretions as well as creatinine clearance were measured at 6-month intervals. Blood pressure was measured every 3 months. After a mean follow-up of 54+/-6 months, the calcium channel blocker group demonstrated both a slower rate of decline in creatinine clearance (-1.7+/-0.9 versus -3.7+/-1.4 mL/min per year per 1.73 m2, P<.01) and a greater reduction in proteinuria compared with the atenolol group. Additionally, a greater proportion of the atenolol group had a 50% or more increase in serum creatinine compared with the verapamil group (32+/-9% versus 16+/-7%, P<.05). These between-group differences could not be explained by differences in blood pressure control. These data support the concept that antihypertensive agents that persistently maintain reductions in both arterial pressure and proteinuria slow the progression of diabetic renal disease in African Americans to a greater extent than those agents without these effects.", 
    "51": "A nocturnal increase in portal pressure and blood flow was demonstrated in patients with cirrhosis, suggesting that these hemodynamic changes may contribute to the triggering of the hemorrhagic episodes observed during the night in these patients. It is known that propranolol reduces portal flow, thus reducing the risk of variceal bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the effect of long-term propranolol administration on the daily fluctuation of systemic and splanchnic hemodynamic parameters in 14 patients with cirrhosis. Cardiac output and portal blood flow were measured by the Doppler technique. A daily fluctuation of both cardiac output and portal blood flow was observed, peaking at midnight. beta-Adrenergic blockade was manifested by a significant reduction in heart rate (-21% +/- 4%, P < .01) and cardiac output (-12% +/- 2%, P < .05). A significant decrease in portal blood flow (-20% +/- 4%, P < .01) was also observed in these patients. Propranolol administration blunted the time-related changes in cardiac output and portal blood flow. In contrast, patients receiving placebo had a nocturnal peak of both parameters similar to that observed under basal conditions. Our study shows that chronic propranolol administration abolishes the nocturnal peak of portal blood flow in patients with cirrhosis and indicates a preventive effect of propranolol in these patients.", 
    "52": "Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from control rats or from rats in which the sciatic nerve had been sectioned were studied by whole-cell recording techniques. Noradrenaline (10-100 micro;M) activated beta-adrenoceptors and increased L-type Ca2+ channel current in control DRG cells, but this had little effect on excitability (the number of action potentials generated by a pulse of current at rheobasic strength). By contrast, in cells from nerve-damaged animals, noradrenaline activated alpha2-adrenoceptors, suppressed N-type Ca2+ channel current, and increased excitability. In axotomized cells, it also reduced total outward current recorded at +70 mV. Because noradrenaline did not affect total outward current recorded in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+ (0. 5-1 mM), its effects on excitability may result from reduction of Ca2+-sensitive K+-conductance(s) following suppression of N-type Ca2+ channel current. The strongest effects of noradrenaline were seen in small cells and in cells from animals that exhibited autotomy, a self-mutilatory behavior that can accompany peripheral nerve damage. Because many of these small DRG cells may be involved in the transmission of nociceptive information, changes in coupling between Ca2+ channels and adrenoceptors may contribute to the generation of the ectopic sensory nerve activity that has been implicated in the etiology of neuropathic pain.", 
    "53": "Mice with segmental trisomy 16 (Ts65Dn) which have triplication of a region of mouse chromosome 16 homologous to the Down syndrome critical region in human chromosome 21, are used as a model for Down syndrome. Functioning of the central beta-noradrenergic transmission was studied in Ts65Dn mice. Binding analysis in cerebral cortex revealed no change in the number of beta-adrenoceptors and a slight reduction of affinity. The beta-adrenoceptor transduction was assessed by analyzing cAMP formation in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex under basal conditions and after stimulation with isoprenaline and forskolin. Basal production of cAMP was significantly reduced in hippocampus and cerebellar cortex of Ts65Dn mice compared to control, but not in cerebellum. After phosphodiesterase inhibition, net increments in cAMP accumulation were similar in both groups of mice. Stimulation of cAMP production by isoprenaline (10 microM) and forskolin (10 microM) was much higher in hippocampus than in cerebral cortex of either group. In both areas, but not in cerebellum, the stimulatory responses were consistently and significantly smaller in Ts65Dn than in control mice. Concentration-response curves for isoprenaline and forskolin were generated in the cerebral cortex. Emax responses were lower in trisomic than in control mice; however, in Ts65Dn mice the slope of the response curve to isoprenaline was markedly depressed whereas that to forskolin was similar to control. It is concluded that Ts65Dn mice show severe deficiencies in the synaptic transmission of the central beta-noradrenergic system, which are selective for specific brain areas.", 
    "54": "For ethical and efficiency concerns one often wishes to design a clinical trial to stop early if there is a strong treatment effect or if there is strong evidence of no treatment effect. There is a large literature to address the design of sequential trials for detecting treatment differences. There has been less attention paid to the design of trials for detecting lack of a treatment difference and most of the designs proposed have been ad hoc modifications of the traditional designs. In the context of fixed sample tests, various authors have proposed basing the decision to stop in favour of the null hypothesis, H0, on conditional power calculations for the end of the trial given the current data. Here I extend this procedure to the popular sequential designs: the O'Brien-Fleming test and the repeated significance test. I derive explicit boundaries for monitoring the test statistic useful for visualizing the impact of the parameters on the operating characteristics of the tests and thus for the design of the tests. Also, they facilitate the use of boundary crossing methods for approximations of power. I derive appropriate boundaries retrospectively for two clinical trials: one that concluded with no treatment difference (AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 118) and one that stopped early for positive effect (Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial). Finally, I compare the procedures based on the different upper boundaries and assess the impact of allowing for early stopping in favour of H0 in numerical examples.",

Column-switching devices are employed in combination with advanced separation media technologies for the automated analysis of samples containing complex matrices. The method consists of on-line sample clean-up using a restricted access sorbent, HPLC analysis of the drugs on a microsphere non-porous silica RP-18 column, and front-cutting to perform the chiral separation of pindolol enantiomers on a second HPLC system. Simultaneous control of the two HPLC systems and data analysis is achieved from a single centralized software. The R.S.D. values of the peak areas for spiked serum are less than 1% for metoprolol and oxprenolol, 2-5% for lidocaine, diltiazem and verapamil, and 1.2 and 2.4% for the two pindolol enantiomers.

    "60": "The excitability of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons is essential for episodic neuropeptide release, but the mechanism by which electrical activity controls GnRH secretion is not well characterized. The role of phospholipase D (PLD) in mediating the activity-dependent secretory pathway was investigated in immortalized GT1 neurons, which both secrete GnRH and express GnRH receptors. Activation of these Ca2+-mobilizing receptors was associated with transient hyperpolarization of GT1 cells, followed by sustained firing of action potentials. This was accompanied by an increase in PLD activity, as indicated by elevated phosphatidylethanol (PEt) production. GnRH-induced PEt production was reduced by inhibition of phospholipase C-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis by U73122 and neomycin, suggesting that signaling from phospholipase C led to activation of PLD. The intermediate role of protein kinase C (PKC) in this process was indicated by the ability of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to induce time- and dose-dependent increases in PEt and diacylglycerol, but not inositol trisphosphate, and by reduction of GnRH-induced PEt accumulation in PKC-depleted cells. Consistent with the role of action potential-driven Ca2+ entry in this process, agonist-induced PLD activity was also reduced by nifedipine and low extracellular Ca2+. Inhibition of the PLD pathway by ethanol and propranolol reduced diacylglycerol production and caused a concomitant fall in GnRH release. These data indicate that voltage-gated Ca2+ entry and PKC act in an independent but cooperative manner to regulate PLD activity, which contributes to the secretory response in GT1 cells. Thus, the electrical activity of the GnRH-secreting neuron participates in the functional coupling between GnRH receptors and PLD pathway.", 
    "61": "Current theories on the encoding and storage of information in the brain commonly suppose that a short-term memory is converted into a lasting one; thus, it becomes consolidated over time. Within a finite period after training, such a short-term memory can be reinforced by behavioral and humoral stimuli. We have found that, long-term potentiation (LTP), a likely candidate for a memory-encoding mechanism at the cellular level, displays similar features. LTP in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats was reinforced after its induction by appetitive and aversive stimuli. The efficacy of these stimuli terminates about 1 h after tetanization, which may reflect the time constants of the mechanisms underlying the consolidation that takes place. The reinforcement by appetitive and aversive stimulation was blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, implicating norepinephrine in the underlying cellular processes.", 
    "62": "To assess the quality of secondary prevention in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) we analyzed prospectively 278 consecutive patients on admission who were hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes (infarction 46%, unstable angina 54%). CAD was known in 155 patients (110 males: acute myocardial infarction 50, unstable angina 105; history of infarction 55%, chronic angina 41%, after CABG 13%, after PTCA 7%, coronary stenoses on angiography 6%). In these patients, aspirin was being administered in 58%, anticoagulation in 12%, betablockers in 43%, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in 20%, and lipid lowering agents in 12%. Calcium blockers were given in 40% (nifedipine 8%). Patients with previous invasive diagnosis and treatment were more frequently treated with drugs of proven prognostic benefit than patients after myocardial infarction and patients with angina only, while overall cardiovascular treatment was similar. The respective rates of treatment were: for aspirin 78%, 60% and 39% respectively (p = 0.0005); for betablockers 59%, 46% and 24% (p = 0.004); for lipid lowering drugs 27%, 7% and 4% (p = 0.002). 12 of 19 patients with known congestive heart failure had ACEI. Only one fourth of dyslipidemic patients had lipid lowering drugs. We conclude that the prevalence of secondary prophylaxis in patients with known CAD is too low despite proven benefit, invasively treated patients having better prophylaxis.", 
    "63": "The effects of hepatic denervation on liver blood flow and the influence of the denervation on the hemodynamic response to exogenously administered agents remain equivocal. This study examined the effects of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, terbutaline, on liver blood flow and how these effects were influenced by surgical hepatic denervation in a conscious canine model. Two weeks after denervation, hepatic arterial flow, portal venous flow, and aortic blood flow were measured during intravenous infusion of terbutaline at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 microgram/kg/min, and responses were compared between the hepatic denervated and sham-operated dogs. Implantable transit-time ultrasonic flowmeter and probes were used. Hepatic arterial flow increased dose-dependently in response to terbutaline in denervated dogs, while it remained unchanged in control dogs except at the highest dose of terbutaline. The increase in hepatic arterial flow of denervated dogs was significantly greater than that of controls at all doses of terbutaline. Aortic blood flow-indexed hepatic arterial flow in response to terbutaline also differed substantially between the two groups. Terbutaline produced a marked dose-dependent increase of portal venous flow similarly in both groups. These results suggest that the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline should be effective for increasing liver blood flow and could lessen postoperative liver ischemia. We speculate that hepatic denervation induces supersensitivity of the hepatic arterial system to intravenous terbutaline.", 
    "64": "Scatterplots (displays of each RR interval as a function of the preceding RR interval) provide a visual assessment of nonrandom variations in heart rate. In a recent study, scatterplot length, width, and area correlated with time-domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) in survivors of recent myocardial infarction (MI) receiving a beta blocker. We performed this study to (1) assess the relation between time-domain measures of HRV and scatterplot indexes in survivors of remote MI not receiving metoprolol and (2) to determine if metoprolol influenced scatterplot indexes. In 28 survivors of remote MI, HRV time-domain variables and scatterplot indexes were measured after 2 weeks off and 2 weeks on metoprolol. Off metoprolol, scatterplot length correlated with long-term HRV variables (SD of the difference of all RR intervals [r = 0.98], SD of the average of all 5-minute intervals [r = 0.97]), and scatterplot width correlated with short-term HRV variables (root-mean-square successive differences between RR intrevals [rMSSD] [r = 0.88]). Metoprolol increased time-domain HRV variables (mean RR interval, rMSSD, and proportion of adjacent RR intervals differing by > 50 ms [pNN50 (%)]) but did not alter scatterplot indexes. Thus, scatterplot indexes correlate with time-domain measures of HRV in survivors of remote MI not receiving metoprolol. In contrast to HRV time-domain variables, scatterplot indexes are not influenced by metoprolol.", 
    "65": "The effects of omega-toxins and various Ca2+ antagonist subtypes on the 45Ca2+ entry into bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells stimulated via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors or via direct depolarization with K+, have been compared. The conditions selected to stimulate the 45Ca2+ entry consisted of a 60-s period of exposure of cells to 100 microM of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist dimethylphenylpiperazinium or to 70 mM K+. The N-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blockers omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA (1 microM) inhibited 45Ca2+ entry stimulated by dimethylphenylpiperazinium or K+ by around 25-30%. The P-type Ca2+ channel blocker omega-agatoxin IVA (10 nM) did not affect the dimethylphenylpiperazinium nor the K+ responses; 1 microM (Q-channel blockade) inhibited both responses by around 50%. The N/P/Q-type Ca2+ channel blocker omega-contoxin MVIIC (1 microM) inhibited the K+ evoked 45Ca2+ entry by 70%, while dimethylphenylpiperazinium was blocked by 50% (P < 0.001). The L-type Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine, furnidipine, diltiazem or verapamil (3 microM each) inhibited much more the dimethylphenylpiperazinium than the K+ response. The dimethylphenylpiperazinium signal was blocked 71, 88, 89, and 53%, respectively, by nifedipine, furnidipine, diltiazem and verapamil, and the K+ response by 38, 29, 22, and 10%. Combined omega-conotoxin MVIIC (1 microM) and furnidipine (3 microM) blocked 100% of the K+ evoked 45Ca2+ entry. However, combined omega-conotoxin GVIA (1 microM), and furnidipine left unblocked 50% of the K+ response. The \"wide spectrum' Ca2+ channel antagonists flunarizine or dotarizine (3 microM each) blocked the dimethylphenylpiperazinium and the K+ responses to a similar extent (50%); cinnarizine (3 microM) inhibited more the dimethylphenylpiperazinium (82%) than the K+ response (21%). At 3 microM, the highly lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (+/-)-propranolol, reduced by 68% the dimethylphenylpiperazinium signal and by 23% the K+ signal. Other high lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists such as metoprolol and labetalol, reduced little the dimethylphenylpiperazinium and the K+ responses. The highly lipophilic agent penfluridol blocked the dimethylpiperazinium response by 30% and the K+ response by 50%. One of the least lipophilic compounds tested, (+)-lubeluzole, blocked by 40% the dimethylphenylpiperazinium and the K+ responses. These data are compatible with the idea that the various omega-toxin peptides used to separate pharmacologically the different voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels expressed by neurones, do not block the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ion channel. In contrast the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers do block the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ionophore. Lipophilicity of the compounds is not a requirement for Ca2+ channel or nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blockade.", 
    "66": "A new method for estimation of agonist-affinity (KA) and relative efficacy was introduced. This method afforded a procedure by which relative efficacy may be estimated while the actual KA values of agonist-receptor complexes are unknown. The relative efficacy may be estimated by employing a newly defined drug parameter, namely the eES value. The eES value is related to drug efficacy and is defined in such a manner that an isolated eES is a meaningful quantity which may indicate whether or not spare receptors are present in an agonist-effector system. The estimation of eES was based on the fact that fixed agonist-competitive antagonist combinations mimic partial agonists and mediate submaximal concentration-effect curves. However, for the practical estimation of eES one may employ data acquired from agonistic concentration-effect curves determined in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of a competitive antagonist. This procedure was illustrated by utilizing theoretical concentration-effect curves and applied practically by estimating eES and KA values acquired from sets of carbachol and salbutamol curves. The sets of carbachol and salbutamol concentration-effect curves were determined in the absence and presence of their respective competitive antagonists, namely tripitramine and pindolol.", 
    "67": "Improvement of symptoms, increase in exercise capacity and prevention of disease progression are the aims of drug therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. At present only the ACE inhibitors are able to achieve all therapeutic targets and should therefore be regarded as drugs of first choice in systolic dysfunction. Diuretics are also necessary in most patients since they rapidly reduce pulmonary congestion and peripheral oedema, but have no documented beneficial long term effects on the course of CHF. Digoxin remains a useful drug to treat symptomatic patients who do not respond adequately to the combination of ACE inhibitors and diuretics, as well as in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, a reduction of mortality by digitalis glycosides cannot be expected. A new trend in the treatment of CHF is the utilisation of beta blockers. These drugs showed positive effects in chronic CHF in several studies, particularly in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Newer drugs such as carvedilol, seem to improve the symptoms and reduce complications even in CHF due to coronary artery disease. The role of beta blockers in the routine management of patients with heart failure requires further evaluation.", 
    "68": "A 600 MHz 1H NMR study of toxin OSK1, blocker of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels, is presented. The unambiguous sequential assignment of all the protons of the toxin was obtained using TOCSY, DQF-COSY, and NOESY experiments at pH 3.0 (10, 30, and 45 degrees C) in aqueous solution. 3J(N alpha), 3J(alphabeta) vicinal spin coupling constants were determined in high-resolution spectra. The cross-peak volumes in NOESY spectra and the coupling constants were used to define the local structure of the protein by the program HABAS and to generate torsion angle and interproton distance constraints for the program DIANA. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates of amide protons showed possible locations of hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond acceptors and disulfide bridges between residues 8-28, 14-33, and 18-35 were determined when analyzing distance distribution in preliminary DIANA structures. All constraints were used to obtain a set of 30 structures by DIANA. The resulting rms deviations over 30 structures are 1.30 A for the heavy atoms and 0.42 A for the backbone heavy atoms. The structures were refined by constrained energy minimization using the SYBYL program. Their analysis indicated the existence of the alpha-helix (residues 10-21) slightly distorted at the Cys14 residue, two main strands of the antiparallel beta-sheet (24-29, 32-38), and the extended fragment (2-6). The motif is stabilized by the disulfide bridges in the way, common to all known scorpion toxins. Using the fine spatial toxin structure, alignment of the homologues, mutagenesis analysis, and comparison of scorpion toxin family functions, we delineate some differences significant for the toxin specificity.",

After myocardial infarction, treatment with timolol and propranolol improves prognosis in patients with symptoms of cardiomegaly and heart failure. In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, treatment with metoprolol improves the left ventricular ejection fraction and symptoms of heart failure, and may have a positive effect on prognosis. Recent studies of patients with chronic congestive heart failure also indicate that carvedilol has a positive effect on mortality and morbidity. The authors review some relevant studies, to stimulate the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs to treat certain types of heart failure.", 
    "70": "Norepinephrine induces an activity-independent long-lasting depression of synaptic transmission in the lateral perforant path input to dentate granule cells, whereas high frequency stimulation induces activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). We investigated the role of endogenous activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in LTP of the lateral and medial perforant paths under conditions affording selective stimulation of these pathways in the rat hippo-campal slice. Propranolol (1 microM), a beta-receptor antagonist, blocked LTP induction of both lateral and medial perforant path-evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials. The results indicate a broad requirement for norepinephrine in different types of synaptic plasticity, including activity-independent depression and activity-dependent LTP in the lateral perforant path.", 
    "71": "Using dissociated spiral ganglion cell cultures obtained from 3-day-old rat cochlea, we investigated the response of auditory neurones to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) using patch-clamp techniques. In our recording conditions, GABA elicited inward currents in > 95% of the neurones which reversed around 0 mV. Similar inward currents were measured using isoguvacin, a specific agonist of GABAA receptors. GABA-gated currents were reversibly inhibited by the channel blocker picrotoxin and the GABA competitive antagonist bicuculline. These functional GABAA receptors are characterized by an insensitivity to benzodiazepines and a relatively high sensitivity to beta-carbolines and barbiturates. These results show that the GABAA receptor pharmacological properties of spiral ganglion neurones are close to those of cerebellar granule cells.",

Double-blind follow-up continued for an average of 19 months, during which all deaths, hospital admissions, and episodes of worsening heart failure were documented.",

During the same period that were no clear changes in treadmill exercise duration, 6 min walk distance, NYHA class, or SAS score. After 19 months, the frequency of episodes of worsening heart failure was similar in the carvedilol and placebo groups (82 vs 75; relative risk 1.12 [95% Cl 0.82-1.53]) but the rate of death or hospital admission was lower in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group (104 vs 131; relative risk 0.74 [0.57-0.95]).", 
    "76": "The beneficial effects of carvedilol on left-ventricular function and size were maintained for at least a year after the start of treatment, but carvedilol had no effect on exercise performance, symptoms, or episodes of worsening heart failure.

    "77": "The methyl ester of pyruvic acid (methyl pyruvate) stimulated a dose-dependent increase in insulin secretion from isolated perifused rat islets. The threshold level for release was about 10 mM, and at 20 mM the addition of MP to perifused islets resulted in a large first phase of secretion followed by an insulin-secretory response that was sustained for at least 40 min. When compared to the effects of 20 mM glucose, peak first-phase release rates in response to 20 mM methyl pyruvate were comparable, but the second phase of release was only about 10-15% of that observed with an equimolar level of the hexose. The stimulatory effects of 20 mM methyl pyruvate on secretion were abolished by the K1+-ATP channel blocker diazoxide (200 microM) and by the calcium channel antagonist nitrendipine (500 nM). The glucokinase inhibitor mannoheptulose (20 mM) had no adverse effect on the secretory response to 20 mM methyl pyruvate, whereas 10 microM forskolin amplified the insulinotropic action of MP. Sodium pyruvate alone or in combination with 10 microM forskolin had no insulinotropic effect. In additional experiments islet phosphoinositide pools were labeled with myo-2-[3H]inositol, and the subsequent accumulation of labeled inositol phosphates was used to monitor the activation of phospholipase C. Methyl pyruvate stimulated a dose-dependent increase in inositol phosphate levels when measured after a 30-min incubation period with a maximal increase of about 300% at 20 mM methyl pyruvate. The increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis caused by methyl pyruvate (20 mM) was, like insulin secretion, reduced by both diazoxide and nitrendipine but was immune to inhibition by mannoheptulose. Pyruvate (20 mM) had no effect on inositol phosphate accumulation. Prior short-term exposure to methyl pyruvate sensitized islets to subsequent stimulation with 15 mM glucose. Sodium pyruvate did not sensitize islets. These findings support the concept that the mitochondrial metabolism of nutrient molecules is an event sufficient to acutely augment insulin release from the beta cell, to increase phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and to induce time-dependent potentiation of insulin secretion.", 
    "78": "Microglial cells express a peculiar plasma membrane receptor for extracellular ATP, named P2Z/P2X7 purinergic receptor, that triggers massive transmembrane ion fluxes and a reversible permeabilization of the plasma membrane to hydrophylic molecules of up to 900 dalton molecule weight and eventual cell death (Di Virgilio, F. 1995. Immunol. Today, 16:524-528). The physiological role of this newly cloned (Surprenant, A., F. Rassendren, E. Kawashima, R. A. North and G. Buell, 1996. Science (Wash. DC). 272:735-737) cytolytic receptor is unknown. In vitro and in vivo activation of the macrophage and microglial cell P2Z/P2X7 receptor by exogenous ATP causes a large and rapid release of mature IL-1 beta. In the present report we investigated the role of microglial P2Z/P2X7 receptor in IL-1 beta release triggered by LPS. Our data suggest that LPS-dependent IL-1 beta release involves activation of this purinergic receptor as it is inhibited by the selective P2Z/P2X7 blocker oxidized ATP and modulated by ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes such as apyrase or hexokinase. Furthermore, microglial cells release ATP when stimulated with LPS. LPS-dependent release of ATP is also observed in monocyte-derived human macrophages. It is suggested that bacterial endotoxin activates an autocrine/paracrine loop that drives ATP-dependent IL-1 beta secretion.", 
    "79": "The purpose of this investigation was to examine the impact of formulation and process changes on dissolution and bioavailability/bioequivalency of metoprolol tartrate tablets manufactured using a high-shear granulation process. A half-factorial (2(4-1), Res IV) design was undertaken to study the selected formulation and processing variables during scale-up. Levels and ranges for excipients and processing changes studied represented level 2 or greater changes as indicated by the SUPAC-IR Guidance. Blend and tableting properties were evaluated. Changes in sodium starch glycolate and magnesium stearate levels, and the order of addition microcrystalline cellulose (intra- vs. extragranular) were significant only in affecting percent drug released (Q) in 5, 10, and 15 min. Statistical analysis of data showed no significant curvature. No interaction effects were found to be statistically significant. To examine the impact of formulation and processing variables on in vivo absorption, three batches were selected for a bioavailability study based on their dissolution profiles. Subjects received four metoprolol treatments (Lopressor, slow-, medium-, and fast-dissolving formulations) separated by 1 week according to a randomized crossover design. After an overnight fast, subjects were administered one tablet (100 mg), blood samples were collected over 24 hr and plasma samples were analyzed. The formulations were found to be bioequivalent with respect to the log Cmax and log AUC0-infinity. The results of this study suggest that: (i) bioavailability/bioequivalency studies may not be necessary for metoprolol tartrate and perhaps other class 1 drugs after level 2 type changes and (ii) in vitro dissolution tests may be used to show bioequivalence of metoprolol formulations with processing or formulation changes within the specified level 2 ranges for the equipment examined.",

    "91": "The reduction of acetohexamide catalyzed by carbonyl reductase from rabbit kidney was inhibited by befunolol, moperone, levobunolol, daunorubicin and loxoprofen, which have a ketone group within their chemical structures and are substrates for the enzyme. A significant correlation was observed between the common logarithm of Vmax/Km values of the enzyme for befunolol, moperone, levobunolol and daunorubicin and the percentage inhibition of the enzyme, confirming that these drugs are competitive substrates of the enzyme with respect to acetohexamide. However, the plot for loxoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a ketone group, was apparently distant from the regression line obtained. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with a ketone group such as suprofen and fenbufen were not reduced by the enzyme, they strongly inhibited the reduction of acetohexamide catalyzed by the enzyme.", 
    "92": "The effects of the expression of the human Bcl-2 family proteins Bax, Bak, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL were examined in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and compared with Bax-induced cell death in mammalian cells. Expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak conferred a lethal phenotype in this yeast, which was strongly suppressed by coexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL. Bcl-2 also partially abrogated Bax-mediated cytotoxicity in S. pombe, whereas a mutant of Bcl-2 (Gly145Ala) that fails to heterodimerize with Bax or block apoptosis in mammalian cells was inactive. However, other features distinguished Bax- and Bak-induced death in S. pombe from animal cell apoptosis. Electron microscopic analysis of S. pombe cells dying in response to Bax or Bak expression demonstrated massive cytosolic vacuolization and multifocal nuclear chromatin condensation, thus distinguishing this form of cell death from the classical morphological features of apoptosis seen in animal cells. Unlike Bax-induced apoptosis in 293 cells that led to the induction of interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE)/CED-3-like protease activity, Bax- and Bak-induced cell death in S. pombe was accompanied neither by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation nor by activation of proteases with specificities similar to the ICE/CED-3 family. In addition, the baculovirus protease inhibitor p35, which is a potent inhibitor of ICE/CED-3 family proteases and a blocker of apoptosis in animal cells, failed to prevent cell death induction by Bax or Bak in fission yeast, whereas p35 inhibited Bax-induced cell death in mammalian cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that Bcl-2 family proteins may retain an evolutionarily conserved ability to regulate cell survival and death but also indicate differences in the downstream events that are activated by overexpression of Bax or Bak in divergent cell types.", 
    "93": "The effect of long-term topical betaxolol on tissue circulation in the iris and optic nerve head was studied. Twenty microliters of 0.5% betaxolol ophthalmic solution was instilled in one eye of an albino rabbit and the same amount of physiological saline in the fellow eye twice daily for 20 days. A quantitative index of tissue blood velocity, NB value, was measured in the iris (21 rabbits) and optic nerve head (31 rabbits) of both eyes before the first instillation and 2 hr after completion of instillations, using a laser speckle tissue circulation analyser of which details have been reported previously. The intraocular pressure was also measured at 5-day intervals. The intraocular pressure was lowered by 2-3 mmHg only in the betaxolol-treated eye (P < 0.01). Both in the iris and optic nerve head no significant bilateral difference in the NB was seen before the first instillation, while it was significantly greater in the betaxolol-treated than in the contralateral control eye by about 10% after completion of instillations (P < 0.02-0.05). The difference between the NB after completion of instillations and that before the first instillation was significantly greater in the betaxolol-treated eye than in the contralateral control eye both in the iris and optic nerve head (P < 0.001-0.02). Twenty-day twice daily instillation of 0.5% betaxolol caused relatively small, but significant increase in tissue blood velocity in the ipsilateral iris and optic nerve head in albino rabbits, which may have clinical implications.", 
    "94": "Latanoprost, a phenyl-substituted analogue of prostaglandin F2 alpha administered as eye drops, induces increased melanogenesis in the iridial melanocytes of monkeys. Similar effects were seen in 12, 23 and 11% of patients in the USA, United Kingdom (UK) and Scandinavia, respectively, during one year of treatment. The highest incidence of induced pigmentation was seen in green-brown, yellow-brown and blue/grey-brown eyes, in that order. The relatively high proportion of patients with green-brown eyes in the UK explains the larger number of affected patients in this country. Typically, a concentric increase of the iris pigmentation appeared after six months (range: 3-17) and was judged to be noticeable by the patient in about 2/3 of the cases. After cessation of latanoprost, no change of the induced pigmentation has been seen in patients followed for two years, and there have been no signs of dispersion of pigment into the anterior chamber. Irides, homogeneously blue, grey, green or brown, were seldom affected. Naevi or freckles on iris, conjunctiva, or eye lids were not affected. It is intriguing that many patients with mixed eye color, particularly the blue-brown eyes, have not developed increased pigmentation even during two years of treatment. This could be due to a relatively slow melanogenesis or to refractory melanocytes in these individuals.", 
    "95": "Three large, masked, multicenter studies are reviewed comparing the safety and efficacy of 0.005% latanoprost eyedrops given once daily to 0.5% timolol eyedrops given twice daily for six months in patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). A total of 829 patients were recruited from centers in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). In addition, data are reviewed from the first 198 of these patients to complete an additional six months of latanoprost treatment in an openlabel study. In all centers, both latanoprost and timolol were very effective in reducing the diurnal IOP. In the UK, both drugs reduced the IOP by 34%. In the USA, latanoprost was more effective than timolol, reducing IOP by 27% compared to 20%. In Scandinavia, latanoprost was given for three months in the evening and for three months in the morning while timolol was given twice daily for six months. Latanoprost given in the evening reduced IOP (35% reduction) significantly (p < 0.001) more than latanoprost given in the morning (31% reduction) and timolol given twice daily (27% reduction). Darkening of the iris color occurred in 7% of eyes treated with latanoprost for six months. A clinical evaluation of eyes with increased pigmentation, as well as preclinical studies; suggest that this side effect is a cosmetic problem in patients treated unilaterally. Other side effects were slight and not clinically significant. After one year of treatment with latanoprost in 198 patients, the IOP reduction of 32% was maintained. There was no loss of efficacy and no significant increase in the incidence of side effects or adverse events other than iris color darkening, which occurred or was suspected in 12%. These results demonstrate that latanoprost is a valuable drug for the treatment of chronic open angle glaucoma.", 
    "96": "We have reviewed two Phase III clinical studies of isopropyl unoprostone conducted in Japan: a 12-week comparative study of 0.12% isopropyl unoprostone and 0.5% timolol, and a 52-week administration of two concentrations of isopropyl unoprostone in ocular hypertensive and primary open-angle glaucoma patients. These studies showed a similar ocular hypotensive effect of 0.12% isopropyl unoprostone to 0.5% timolol and a sustained ocular hypotensive effect of the drug for up to one year. Adverse reactions of isopropyl unoprostone were minor and similar to those of timolol. No pigmentary changes of the irides were noticed. In view of these results, isopropyl unoprostone seems to be a useful antiglaucoma medication.", 
    "97": "Latanoprost, a prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue prodrug, has been shown to be an effective ocular hypotensive agent when used alone on ocular hypertensive or open angle glaucoma patients. In various studies, the ocular hypotensive effects of latanoprost have also been evaluated when used in addition to, or in combination with, other ocular hypotensive agents. Latanoprost produces an additional reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) when used in combination with timolol, pilocarpine, acetazolamide and dipivefrin. These represent four different classes of glaucoma drugs-beta-adrenergic antagonists, cholinergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and adrenergic agonists-all of which reduce the IOP by different mechanisms (reduction of aqueous humor production, increased outflow facility, or by a mixed effect on aqueous humor dynamics). All the available evidence shows that latanoprost produces a clinically significant additive ocular hypotensive effect when used in combination with any currently available ocular hypotensive agent.", 
    "98": "Currently used ocular hypotensive agents do not effectively lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in some normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) patients. The prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue, latanoprost, has been shown to reduce IOP in normal subjects and ocular hypertensive glaucoma patients by increasing uveoscleral outflow. This mechanism is expected to be particularly effective in the lower IOP range that is typical of NTG. To date, three dose regimens of latanoprost have been shown to reduce IOP significantly in NTG. The IOP reductions of 14.2% and 15% obtained with twice-daily application of 0.0015% and 0.006% latanoprost, respectively, were comparable to the modest IOP reduction that has been reported for other glaucoma drugs in NTG. In contrast, once-daily application of 0.005% latanoprost resulted in a 21.4% IOP reduction. In another study that included 24-hour monitoring of systemic blood pressure and heart rate in NTG patients, the ocular perfusion pressure was found to improve more on once-daily 0.005% latanoprost than on twice-daily treatment with 0.5% timolol. Thus, once-daily 0.005% latanoprost appears to be a more effective and more convenient ocular hypotensive agent for treating NTG than currently used glaucoma drugs. However, long-term studies will ultimately be needed to establish the efficacy of this new drug to delay or prevent the progression of visual field loss in normal tension glaucoma.", 
    "99": "This review summarizes recent short-term clinical studies evaluating the ocular hypotensive efficacy of different dose-regimens of latanoprost. When tested in ocular hypertensive and glaucoma patients concomitantly treated with timolol, 0.006% latanoprost given only in the evening, was found to be more effective than the same concentration given in the morning and evening. In patients with open angle, pseudoexfoliation and normal tension glaucoma not receiving other treatment, once-daily 0.005% latanoprost monotherapy was more effective than twice-daily 0.0015% latanoprost treatment. No significant differences were found in conjunctival hyperemia, sensory irritation or blood-aqueous barrier permeability between these two treatment regimens. Although the ocular hypotensive efficacy of once-daily application of the lower concentration (0.0015%) latanoprost was not investigated, we would conclude, based on the studies reviewed here, that at a concentration of 0.005%, once-a-day dosing of latanoprost is highly effective in significantly reducing intraocular pressure, causing only minimal, clinically acceptable short-term ocular side effects.", 
    "100": "Noradrenaline (NA) is one of the most important neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. In this study, the effects of NA on GnRH secretion, intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i), and membrane potentials were investigated in immortalized hypothalamic neurons (GT1-7) to determine the direct effects of NA on GnRH cells. Cells were perfused in a plastic minicolumn, and GnRH concentrations of the effluents were measured. NA increased the release of GnRH in a dose-dependent manner. Cells were loaded with a 4 microM Fura 2-AM, and the ratio of the intensities of fluorescent emission at 510 nm with excitation at 340 and 380 nm was calculated at 100-ms intervals. NA increased the [Ca2+]i responses of single GnRH cells dose-dependently. The NA-induced [Ca2+]i increase was attenuated in the absence of extracellular calcium and was blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, but not by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine. The cell membrane potential was recorded with a whole-cell patch clamp amplifier with glass-electrodes. NA induced membrane depolarization under current-clamp conditions. The depolarization was also inhibited by propranolol, but not by phentolamine. The results show that NA directly affects the membrane potential of GT1-7 cells via beta-adrenergic receptors and induces Ca2+ mobilization; these effects stimulate GnRH secretion.", 
    "101": "We evaluated whether Gi has a tonic inhibitory influence on myocardial adenylate cyclase (AC) in an agonist-independent way, and, if so, whether this is attributable to substantial coupling between agonist-free, empty inhibitory receptors and G. Rabbits received pertussis toxin (PTX, 10 micrograms/kg i.v.) 40 h before preparing ventricular myocardial membranes, which was associated with virtually complete in vivo ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of the 41-kDa substrate. Pretreatment with PTX had no influence on basal AC activity but significantly enhanced AC activity elicited by 100 microM GTP. Furthermore, it markedly increased AC activity stimulated with 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) and isoproterenol through a wide range of concentrations of these stimulants. These findings indicate that Gi has a tonic influence on he stimulatory effects of guanine nucleotides and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation on AC even in the absence of the inhibitory receptor agonists. The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine and AF-DX 116 significantly enhanced isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity, as PTX pretreatment did, except that statistically significant increasing effects of these antagonists on GppNHp-stimulated AC activity was observed only at higher concentrations of GppNHp. The enhancement by atropine was not detected in PTX-pretreated membranes. The selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 did not modify the stimulatory effects of guanine nucleotides and isoproterenol on AC in either control or PTX-pretreated membranes, excluding the possible involvement of beta 2-adrenoceptors in tonic activation of Gi. We conclude that Gi is tonically activated by agonist-free, empty muscarinic receptors, which leads to attenuation of Gs-mediated or beta-adrenoceptor-mediated activation of AC. The potentiating effect of PTX pretreatment on GppNHp-stimulated AC activity may be at least partially due to the direct action of PTX on the Gi heterotrimeric complex, independently of the coupled receptors.", 
    "102": "The electrophysiological effect of extracellular ATP was investigated in voltage-clamped single cells from the rabbit sino-atrial node. External 0.5 mM ATP consistently activated a time-independent, weakly inwardly rectifying current (2.26 +/- 0.14 pA/pF at -100 mV, n = 23). This external ATP-activated current increased in a dose-dependent manner over the concentration range 0.01 to 1 mM ATP. However, non-hydrolysable ATP analogs (a, beta-methylene ATP and beta,r-methylene ATP) failed to activate this current. Moreover, adenosine, adenosine monophosphate and adenosine diphosphate were all ineffective in eliciting the ATP-activated current over the concentration range 0.5 to 1 mM, suggesting that it is regulated via the P2-purinoreceptor. The permeability sequence for the ATP-activated current among different cations (determined from reversal potential measurements) was 1.09: 1: 1: 0.24: 0.22 for K+, Na+, Cs+, Tris and N-methyl-D-glucamine. The current component was not affected by substitution of external Cl- by aspartate or by the application of a stilbene-derivative Cl- channel blocker. Thus, the ATP-activated current in rabbit sino-atrial node cells was non-selective for monovalent cations, and could be carried by large molecular ions, such as N-methyl-D-glucamine or Tris. We suggest that it might make some contribution to the chronotropic effects seen on release of transmitters from autonomic nerve endings in the heart.", 
    "103": "The regulation of cardiac L-type Ca2- current (Ica) and contraction by dihydropyridine antagonists and beta-adrenergic receptor agonists has been the subject of numerous studies over the last decade. However, little is known on the crosstalk between these two regulatory pathways. For instance, a fundamental question that remains unanswered is: does activation of the beta-adrenergic receptors modify the sensitivity of the myocardium to dihydropyridine agonists? To answer this question, we examined in the present study how activation of the beta-adrenergic receptors modifies the effects of nifedipine on the mechanical and energetic parameters of the isolated perfused rat heart. Activation of the beta-adrenergic receptors was achieved by perfusing the hearts with isoprenaline, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, and could be reduced by atenolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. To examine possible alterations during hypertension in the sensitivity of the hearts to the drug, tested, the study was performed in both normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive animals (SHR). While 0.1 microM nifedipine reduced left ventricular pressure (LVP) by 36% and 34% in WKY and SHR rats, respectively, under basal conditions, its effects became negligible in both groups of rats after stimulation of the hearts with 0.1 microM isoprenaline. Addition of 1 microM atenolol in the presence of isoprenaline restored the inhibitory effect of nifedipine to control values in both WKY and SHR rats. Additional experiments were performed in isolated ventricular myocytes from WKY rats using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The inhibitory effects of 0.1 to 1 microM nifedipine were significantly larger on basal Ica than after the current had been previously elevated by 0.1 microM isoprenaline. Addition of 1 microM atenolol in the presence of isoprenaline partially restored the inhibitory effect of nifedipine on Ica. Our results demonstrate a reduced sensitivity of the heart muscle to nifedipine during activation of beta 1-adrenergic receptors. This effect is partly explained by a reduced inhibitory effect of nifedipine on Ic during activation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation.", 
    "104": "Combination therapy with the new ACE inhibitor moexipril plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) results in significant blood pressure (BP) reductions. This study compares the efficacy and safety of moexipril plus HCTZ to that of a standard combination treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. After a 1 month placebo run-in period, 140 hypertensive patients whose sitting diastolic BP (DBP) averaged 95-114 mm Hg were randomized to receive either once daily moexipril 7.5 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg or metoprolol 100 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg for the following 12-week double-blind treatment period. At biweekly visits BP was controlled sphygmomanometrically and the occurrence of adverse events (AE) was documented. At study endpoint adjusted mean reductions in sitting systolic/diastolic BP seen with both combinations were -17.6 mm Hg/-12.8 mm Hg and -17.2 mm Hg/-13.9 mm Hg in the moexipril/HCTZ and metoprolol/HCTZ groups, respectively. The response rate to both kinds of combinations were very similar, 69% and 74% in the moexipril/HCTZ and metoprolol/HCTZ groups, respectively. The percentage of patients which experienced one or more AEs were 46% in the moexipril/HCTZ and 61% in the metoprolol/HCTZ group. Headache and cough which are the most frequently reported AEs after treatment with ACE inhibitors were seen in 9% and 10% of the patients in the moexipril/HCTZ group compared to 10% and 4% in the metoprolol/HCTZ group. The study indicates that the combination of moexipril 7.5 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg is as efficacious and safe as metoprolol 100 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "105": "Migraine is caused by intermittent brain dysfunction. Attacks result in severe unilateral headache with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia and general weakness. The prevalence of migraine is 12 to 20% in women and 8 to 12% in man. Treatment of an acute attack is done by antiemetics in combination with analgesics. Severe migraine attacks are treated with ergotamine or sumatriptan. Parenteral treatment is performed most efficiently and safely with i.v. ASA. Frequent and severe attacks require prophylaxis. Drugs of first choice are metoprolol, propranolol, flunarizine and cyclandelate. Substances of second choice are valproic acid, DHE, pizotifen, methysergide and magnesium. Homeopathic remedies are not superior to placebo. Nonpharmacological treatment consists of sport therapy and muscle relaxation techniques.", 
    "106": "The results of studies on the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) are discordant. In some studies in which an increased RSA was reported, central vagotonic activity has been proposed. The aim of this study was to verify whether chronic beta-adrenergic blockade is capable of increasing RSA, and therefore vagal outflow, and to analyze whether the mechanism of action is central or peripheral. Twenty normal subjects (mean age 28 +/- 2 years) were randomized to receive a hydrophilic (nadolol, N), a lipophilic (metoprolol, M) beta-blocker and placebo (PL). After 1 week of therapy a spectral analysis was made of the variability in heart rate and systolic blood pressure (SBP) while they controlled their breathing at 16 breaths/min for a period of 5 min. The high frequency component was calculated for the RR interval (HF-RR, RSA measure) and SBP (HF-SBP), and the squared coherence (K2) and phase functions (phi HF) were assessed between RR and SBP fluctuations in the respiratory band (RR-SBP); a negative phi HF means that RR changes follow SBP changes. The alpha HF (an index of the baroreflex gain) was also calculated. Both beta-blockers increased the mean RR interval (PL 808 +/- 21, N 1054 +/- 30, M 1031 +/- 27 ms; p < 0.0001), HF-RR (PL 6.3 +/- 0.3, N 7.1 +/- 0.3, M 7.2 +/- 0.3 ln-ms2; p = 0.002) and alpha HF (PL 13.6 +/- 1.5, N 21.9 +/- 2.8, M 24.5 +/- 3.6 ms/mmHg; p < 0.002), and both modified phi HF (PL -0.23 +/- 0.05, N -0.02 +/- 0.05, M -0.03 +/- 0.04 s; p < 0.0001). No difference was found between N and M. Chronic beta-adrenergic blockade enhanced RSA and baroreflex gain and reduced the phase between the RR interval and SBP oscillations. Since no difference was found between the hydrophilic and the lipophilic beta-blockers, these changes seem to be due to a peripheral effect.", 
    "107": "Background and evoked activities of sensorimotor cortex neurons have been examined on learning cats with conditioned placing reaction before, during and after iontophoretic application of synaptically active drugs. It was shown that glutamate exerted not only a direct excitatory effect on the cortical neurons during its application, but also developed modulatory influences on background and evoked impulse activity after cessation of application in the subsequent 10-20 min. Adrenergic influences on the activity of neocortical neurons evoked by application of adrenomimetic drugs were complex and consisted of at least two different types. Noradrenaline depressed background and particularly evoked activity of many neurons through beta1-adrenoreceptors. At the same time, activation of beta2-adrenoreceptors was accompanied by facilitation of background and evoked activity during application and 10-20 min after its cessation, as was shown in experiments with alupent. Co-application of glutamate and alupent improved facilitation of impulse response evoked by conditioned stimuli. It was concluded that beta1- and beta2-adrenergic inputs to neocortical neurons are involved in plasticity changes of glutamate inputs of some cortical neurons.", 
    "108": "Effects of chronic treatment of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) with carvedilol, an agent which has both alpha and beta-adrenoceptor blocking actions, on spontaneous muscle tone and on structural and functional abnormalities of endothelium were studied. The treatment of SHRSP with the drug of the dose of 30 to 200 mg/kg/day lowered the blood pressure significantly. Spontaneous muscle tone in endothelium-removed preparation disappeared by the treatment. Noradrenaline-induced contraction was depressed by the treatment in endothelium intact preparation but not in endothelium removed preparation. The treatment prevented the structural and functional abnormalities of endothelium. Similar results were obtained by the treatment with propranolol. These results indicate that carvedilol prevented abnormal contraction of SHRSP aorta through protective effects on smooth muscle and endothelium. These effects may play roles in blood pressure lowering effect of carvedilol.",

After separation on silica gel GF254 plates, using acetone-methanol-triethylamine as the mobile phase for the tablets and acetone-triethylamine for ampoules, the chromatographic zones corresponding to the spots of metoprolol were scanned. Quantitation was performed using a computer-controlled Camag TLC scanner and applying five-point calibration with polynomial regression. The calibration function was established in the ranges 1-28 micrograms for tablets and 1-9 micrograms for ampoules. The results obtained are precise and reproducible, with recovery values of 99.1-99.4%.", 
    "110": "The mechanism by which bradykinin (BK) decreases vascular resistance was investigated in the hindquarters vascular bed of the rat. Under conditions of controlled blood flow, BK produced dose-related decreases in hindquarters perfusion pressure when injected into the perfusion circuit in doses of 0.1-1.0 pg. Responses to BK were reproducible with respect to time, and HOE-140 (D-Arg, [Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8] -BK), a kinin B2 receptor antagonist, decreased hindquarters vasodilator responses to the peptide. HOE-140 had no significant effect on responses to vasodilator agents, which act by a variety of pharmacologically distinct mechanisms. Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine benzyl ester did not decrease responses to BK in doses that decreased hindquarters vasodilator responses to acetylcholine. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors meclofenamate and indomethacin had no effect on responses to BK in doses that attenuated vasodilator responses to the prostaglandin precursor, arachidonic acid. Clotrimazole or 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), cytochrome P-450 arachidonic acid metabolism inhibitors, in doses that attenuated vasodilator responses to arachidonic acid, had no effect on responses to BK. Glybenclamide or U-37883A (4-morpholinecarboximidine-N-1-adamantyl-N'-cyclohexyl), K+-ATP channel antagonists, in doses that attenuated responses to lemakalim, had no significant effect on responses to BK. Finally, des-Arg9-BK, a reported kinin B1 receptor agonist, decreased hindquarters perfusion pressure when injected in doses of 3-30 microg, and responses to the B1 agonist were attenuated by HOE-140. The observation that des-Arg9-BK, in high doses, induces modest HOE-140-sensitive responses suggests that kinin B1 receptors are not normally expressed in the hindquarters vascular bed of the rat. The present results indicate that BK dilates the hindquarters vascular bed by a kinin B2 receptor mechanism that is independent of the release of nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase, or P-450 metabolites of arachidonic acid or the activation of K+-ATP channels.", 
    "111": "Ingestion of milk during suckling causes hypertension and tachycardia in young, unweaned animals of many species, but these responses are most pronounced in the calf. The present study was undertaken to assess the extent to which this phenomenon depends on activation of adrenoceptors in these animals. Mean basal heart rate was 100 +/- 8 beats/min and mean basal aortic blood pressure was 92 +/- 5 mmHg. The rise in heart rate during feeding was almost completely suppressed after propranolol (2-4 mg/kg iv), which also significantly reduced the rise in blood pressure from 67 +/- 4 to 44 +/- 3 mmHg (P < 0.005). Additional pretreatment with phentolamine (1.0 mg/kg and < or =0.1 mg x min(-1) x kg(-1) iv) virtually eliminated the rise in blood pressure during feeding; it rose by only 8 +/- 4 mmHg (P < 0.001). Section of both splanchnic nerves also significantly reduced the rise in blood pressure during feeding, especially after pretreatment with propranolol. Neither section of the splanchnic nerves nor the administration of the blocking agents significantly affected the rises in plasma insulin and pancreatic polypeptide that occurred after feeding. There was no detectable rise in plasma neuropeptide Y concentration in response to feeding. The hypertensive response to direct electrical stimulation of the peripheral end of a splanchnic nerve and to intra-arterial injections of norepinephrine were completely abolished after combined pretreatment with atropine, propranolol, and phentolamine after the ipsilateral adrenal vein had been tied off. It is concluded that the cardiovascular changes that occur during feeding in these animals are attributable very largely, if not entirely, to activation of adrenoceptors.", 
    "112": "We tested the hypothesis that a transient increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) before prolonged ischemia triggers the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), resulting in significant protection against ischemic injury. Ca2+ preconditioning (3 cycles of 1-min Ca2+ depletion and 5-min Ca2+ repletion) and pharmacological intervention with isoproterenol (Iso) were employed to increase the Ca2+ influx. Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were subjected to 40 min of global ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion (I/R). A significant functional recovery and minimal biochemical changes were observed in Ca2+-preconditioned hearts after I/R. Pretreatment with 0.1 micromol/l Iso caused a sudden increase in left ventricular contractility, a significant decrease in lactate dehydrogenase release, preservation of ATP content, and left ventricular function compared with nontreated I/R hearts. Administration of verapamil during Iso treatment blunted the salutary effects of Iso on I/R and pretreatment with BAY K 8644, an L-type Ca2+-channel opener, mimicked Iso-induced protection. Addition of propranolol or specific PKC inhibitors (chelerythrine or bisindolylmaleimide) during Iso infusion completely abolished the beneficial effects of Iso. These results demonstrate that 1) treatment with a low dose of Iso provides significant protection against ischemic injury, 2) transient elevation of [Ca2+]i is a strong activator of PKC, and 3) PKC plays a crucial role in the subcellular mechanisms of protection by activating second messenger signals during Iso-induced preconditioning.", 
    "113": "Manipulations of the murine genome that alter cardiovascular function have created the need for methods to study cardiovascular physiology in genetically altered animals in vivo. We adapted chronic physiological measurement techniques to the nonanesthetized, nonrestrained murine model, established strain-specific cardiovascular and metabolic norms, and evaluated responses to anesthesia, exercise, and adrenergic stimulation. Anesthesia resulted in alterations in heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and O2 consumption (V(O2)) and CO2 production (V(CO2)) for up to 6 h postoperatively. There were significant interstrain differences in resting values of HR and BP Graded treadmill exercise resulted in linear increases in HR, V(O2), V(CO2), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) similar to those seen in larger species. Response to beta-adrenergic stimulation showed a classic sigmoidal dose-response curve; however, there was very little tachycardiac response to vagal blockade, indicating low resting vagal tone. This study demonstrates the feasibility of performing chronic cardiovascular measurements in nonanesthetized mice and stresses the importance of allowing for anesthetic recovery and strain variability. Murine cardiovascular responses to exercise can be reliably measured and are qualitatively similar to those in humans.", 
    "114": "In a previous study we have reported the existence of alpha2- and beta-adrenoceptors in cultured rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells. In this report, we examined the effect of epinephrine on intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation and evaluated whether alpha2-adrenoceptors interact with beta-receptors, vasopressin receptors, and prostaglandin (PG) E2 receptors by measuring cAMP generation. Epinephrine stimulated cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner [half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 300 nM]. Rauwolscine (10 microM) enhanced epinephrine effects, shifting the dose-response curve for epinephrine to the left (EC50 = 120 nM); however, beta-antagonists inhibited epinephrine-induced cAMP accumulation. Epinephrine (10 microM) inhibited cAMP accumulation maximally induced by isoproterenol (10 microM); this effect was reversed by rauwolscine (10 microM). Epinephrine inhibited vasopressin (100 nM)-induced cAMP accumulation but failed to inhibit PGE2 (10 microM)-induced cAMP accumulation. We conclude that epinephrine acts as an alpha2- and beta-adrenoceptor agonist and that alpha2-adrenoceptors interact with beta-adrenoceptors and vasopressin receptors but not with PGE2 receptors on cAMP accumulation. This suggests that alpha2-adrenoceptors play a physiological role via interaction with different hormone receptors.", 
    "115": "We investigated the effects of the topical ocular hypotensives with or without half circumference argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) on intraocular pressure (IOP) of normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) eyes. Seventy-two NTG patients whose pretreatment mean IOP was > or = 15 mmHg at least in one eye were included and one randomly chosen eye from one patient were used for analysis. They were followed for at least 15 months after commencement of the therapy. The mean pretreatment IOP averaged 17.2 +/- 1.6 mmHg (mean +/- standard deviation, n = 72). All eyes were first treated with topical 2% carteolol. In eyes where IOP reduction was considered unsatisfactory, topical 1% pilocarpine or 0.04% dipivefrine was added. In eyes where IOP reduction was still unsatisfactory even with the two medications, half circumference ALT was performed. Mean IOP reduction was 1.5 mmHg in the eyes treated with topical medications alone and 2.5 mmHg in those treated by topical medications plus ALT. The mean outflow pressure reduction was 16 and 26%, respectively. In 40% of the all eyes, satisfactory IOP reduction was obtained by topical medications with or without additional ALT.",

Patients randomized to sotalol had fewer hospitalizations, lower costs, and better survival than patients randomized to other drugs, and sotalol was a dominant strategy in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Patients for whom an effective drug was found had fewer hospital admissions, lower costs, and longer survival. These findings were robust in sensitivity analyses and in bootstrap replications.",

    "120": "In a previous study, we have shown that angiotensin II (Ang II) activates phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D due to Ang II-induced Ca2+ influx from extracellular space in subcultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. In the present study, we have investigated the role of phospholipase D in Ang II-induced arachidonic acid (AA) metabolite release and prostacyclin synthesis in subcultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Ang II significantly stimulated AA metabolite release in a concentration-dependent manner in the range between 1 nmol/I and 0.1 mumol/I. D.L.-Propranolol hydrochloride (propranolol), an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, significantly inhibited the Ang II-induced release of AA metabolites. The Ang II-induced AA metabolite release was reduced by chelating extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA. Genistein, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases, significantly suppressed the Ang II-induced AA metabolite release. 1,6-Bis-(cyclohexyloximinocarbonylamino)-hexane (RHC-80267), a potent and selective inhibitor of diacylglycerol lipase, significantly inhibited the Ang II-induced AA metabolite release. Both propranolol and RHC-80267 inhibited the Ang II-induced synthesis of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, a stable metabolite of prostacyclin. The synthesis was suppressed by genistein. These results strongly suggest that the AA metabolite release induced by Ang II is mediated, at least in part, through phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by phospholipase D activation in aortic smooth muscle cells.", 
    "121": "We prospectively evaluated the safety of the washout period from topical beta-adrenergic blockers prior to clinical drug trials. In 30 consecutive patients optic disc parameters (neural rim, optic disc, peripapillary halo and atrophy areas, and venous/arterial diameters) did not change following washout (p > 0.05). Likewise, the mean defect and pattern standard deviation (Humphrey 30-2) did not change following washout (p > 0.05). This study suggests, generally, the safety of the washout period prior to clinical drug trials.", 
    "122": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACh-R) agonists such as (-)-nicotine and related compounds on brain monoamine turnover. A single administration of (-)-nicotine (0.04, 0.2, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/kg SC) increased both noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) turnover in a dose-dependent manner, and the maximum effects were achieved 30 min after treatment with (-)-nicotine (1.0 mg/kg). The effect of (-)-nicotine on serotonin (5-HT) turnover was complicated; 5-HT turnover was increased at a low dose of (-)-nicotine (0.04 mg/kg) but decreased at a high dose (1.0 mg/kg). The (-)-nicotine (1.0 mg/kg)-induced changes in monoamine turnover were blocked by pretreatment with the centrally acting nACh-R channel blocker mecamylamine (2.0 mg/kg i.p.) but not by hexamethonium (2.0 mg/kg i.p.). These findings indicate that systemically administered (-)-nicotine can enhance brain NA and DA turnover and affect 5-HT turnover, both of which are mediated by central nACh-R. The changes in the monoamine turnover induced by (+/-)-anabasine were similar to those induced by (-)-nicotine, while (-)-lobeline and (-)-cytisine had little effect, and 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium (DMPP) increased NA and 5-HT turnover but not DA turnover at all doses tested. (S)-3-Methyl-5-(l-methyl-2- pyrrolidinyl)isoxazole (ABT-418), a selective neuronal nACh-R agonist, increased NA, DA and 5-HT turnover, but had a weaker effect on DA turnover than NA and 5-HT turnover. In addition, 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine (THA), an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, also increased monoamine turnover in the brain. Pretreatment with mecamylamine completely blocked the THA-induced increase in NA and 5-HT turnover, but not in DA turnover, suggesting that the nACh-R system is involved in the THA-induced increase in brain NA and 5-HT turnover. On the other hand, (-)-cytisine, a partial agonist for the beta 2 subunit containing nACh-R, completely inhibited the nACh-R agonist- and THA-induced increases in NA turnover, but not in DA turnover, and normalized the changes in 5-HT turnover. In conclusion, the subtypes of nACh-Rs mediating DA turnover may be different from those mediating NA and 5-HT turnover in the CNS.", 
    "123": "Certain vasoactive substances reduce portal pressure in patients or animals with portal hypertension by either inducing splanchnic vasoconstriction or reducing hepatic vascular resistance. Studies have shown that propranolol or nadolol significantly reduce the risk of a first episode of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and increase the survival rate in patients with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices. Isosorbide-5-mononitrate is also effective in the prevention of bleeding. The combination of beta-blockers and nitrates may be more effective than one drug alone. These results show that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists must be used to prevent the first episode of GI bleeding. Beta-blocker administration also significantly reduces the risk of recurrent GI bleeding and increases the survival rate in patients with cirrhosis. Studies have shown that propranolol is as effective as endoscopic sclerotherapy. The combination of a beta-blocker with endoscopic sclerotherapy may be more effective than pharmacological or endoscopic treatment alone for the prevention of rebleeding. Finally, new experimental and clinical studies are needed to improve the pharmacological treatment of portal hypertension.",

Both groups were matched for age, ejection fraction, and peak dose of dobutamine. Heart rate and blood pressure were assessed during and after dobutamine administration.", 
    "127": "Both groups had similar baseline blood pressure (mmHg) (142 +/- 19/72 +/- 14 vs 139 +/- 20/72 +/- 14) and heart rate (beats per minute) (75 +/- 14 vs 75 +/- 17) (esmolol and control respectively, p = ns), but peak heart rate was higher in the esmolol group (126 +/- 14 vs. 116 +/- 14, p < 0.01). In the group who received esmolol, symptomatic relief paralleled the statistically significant decrease in heart rate which occurred within 1 minute of esmolol administration (99.7 +/- 15.3 vs 108.5 +/- 13.1 p < 0.0001); the heart rate in the esmolol group remained significantly lower than the control group for 5 minutes following esmolol administration (92.0 +/- 10.3 vs 96.7 +/- 11.8 p < 0.05). As a percentage of peak heart rate the esmolol group remained significantly lower than the control for 7 minutes (74% vs 80% p < 0.05). Esmolol induced a significant reversal of dobutamine-induced diastolic hypotension (diastolic blood pressure at peak 66 +/- 17 vs 8 min recovery 70 +/- 12, p < 0.03) that was not seen in controls (diastolic blood pressure at peak 64 +/- 18 vs 8 min recovery 65 +/- 14, p = ns). Systolic blood pressure and heart rate remained elevated in both groups 8 min into recovery compared to baseline, suggesting persistent dobutamine effect beyond the expected 2 min pharmacologic half-life of dobutamine. No side-effects from esmolol were seen despite it being used in 9 patients with EF < 35%.", 
    "128": "Esmolol is effective and well tolerated for the management of dobutamine-related minor side-effects.

The study is being conducted in general practices throughout Australia and will recruit 6000 subjects over 2-3 years (3000 in each arm of the study) to provide 30,000 years of patient observation. This will allow detection of a 25% difference in the primary outcome variable at the 5% level with a power of 90%. 4. Following randomization to one of the treatment arms, each subject's blood pressure (BP) is managed by the general practitioner according to his/her usual practice to achieve goal BP with guidelines for drug therapy relevant to each treatment arm. 5. Study endpoint information is gained from a review of practice records every 3 months and these data are then assessed by an Endpoint Committee blinded for treatment randomization. 6.

    "130": "It is reported that glucose releases ATP with insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Suramin (50-200 microM), a purinoceptor blocker, reversibly and dose-dependently inhibited the rise in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) induced by glucose and by ATP in single beta cells. Suramin did not inhibit the glucose-induced increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence. The rise in [Ca2+]i induced by tolbutamide (an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive K+ channels), arginine (a cationic amino acid) and acetylcholine was unaffected by suramin (50-200 microM). This suggests that suramin inhibits the glucose-induced Ca2+ response without an inhibitory effect on glucose metabolism, K+ channels, voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx or Ca2+ release from internal Ca2+ stores and that a purinergic mechanism is involved in the glucose response in beta cells.", 
    "131": "The hypotensive effects of YM430 (4(((S)-2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl)amino)butyl methyl 2,6-dimethyl-((S)-4-(m-nitrophenyl))-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxyla te) were evaluated in hypertensive animals. In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), single oral administration of YM430 (10-100 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent decrease in mean blood pressure (MBP) with slight reflex tachycardia. The hypotensive effect of YM430 reached its maximum about 2 hr after dosing and lasted for over 10 hr. Importantly, the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity of YM430 had a similar time course to that of its calcium entry blocking activity. In conscious normotensive dogs (NTD: 1-10 mg/kg, p.o.), YM430 decreased MBP without reflex tachycardia, and inhibited isoproterenol (ISO)-induced tachycardia in a dose-dependent manner. In conscious renal hypertensive dogs (RHD: 0.3-3 mg/kg, p.o.), YM430 also produced a sustained hypotensive effect. Furthermore, on repeated oral administration to conscious SHR and NTD, YM430 caused a long-lasting hypotensive effect. This hypotensive activity and inhibition of ISO-induced tachycardia showed neither tolerance, augmentation nor rebound. In conclusion, YM430 has a long-lasting hypotensive effect and behaves as a hybrid compound, combining calcium entry blocking and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activities in vivo. In addition, the degree of the blocking activities of YM430 remains nearly constant in the long-term after oral administration.", 
    "132": "The vagal cardiac accelerator (VCA) system takes part in the nervous control of the heart rate. In the present study we tried to adduce evidence that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) contributes to vagally induced cardioaccelerations.", 
    "133": "The effect of VIP on heart rate and arterial blood pressure was investigated after unmasking the inherent VCA activity by blocking the sympathetic accelerator and vagal decelerator influences on heart rate in conscious dogs.", 
    "134": "Following intravenous administration of VIP (10 micrograms i.v.) the heart rate increased by 43.6 +/- 6.7 (28.1 +/- 4.7%), from 165.6 +/- 8.5 to 209.1 +/- 7.0 beats/min (P < 0.001) and the mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 47.5 +/- 3.2 (37.9 +/- 3.0%), from 126.6 +/- 2.6 to 79.1 +/- 4.9 mmHg (P < 0.001) (n = 11). After VCA activity was reflexly enhanced by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation with methoxamine, VIP increased heart rate by 36.9 +/- 7.3 (21.5 +/- 4.6%), from 179.8 +/- 5.2 to 216.7 +/- 5.8 beats/min (P < 0.001) and decreased mean arterial pressure by 79.1 +/- 6.4 (46.7 +/- 3.5%), from 168.2 +/- 4.1 to 89.1 +/- 5.0 mmHg (P < 0.001). Hence, the VIP-induced tachycardia, expressed in relative values, shows a significant attenuation after the administration of methoxamine (P < 0.05). The increase in heart rate induced by VIP appeared to be inversely related to the prevailing VCA activity, both before (r = -0.744, P = 0.009) and after methoxamine (r = -0.689, P = 0.019). The VIP-induced tachycardia is certainly not reflexly induced by the fall in arterial pressure, because intracoronary administration of VIP (0.5 microgram i.c.) caused an appreciable increase in the heart rate by 63.7 +/- 13.0 (46.4 +/- 10.4%), from 143.0 +/- 8.1 to 208.7 +/- 12.0 beats/min (P < 0.005), whereas the mean arterial pressure only slightly changed (-7.7 +/- 2.0 mmHg) (P < 0.05) (n = 6). In addition, VIP (10 micrograms i.v.) also caused a tachycardia in vagotomized dogs with blocked beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. The administration of the VIP antagonists [D-p-CI-Phe6, Leu17]-VIP (50-150 micrograms i.c.) and [Lys1, Pro2,5, Leu17]-VIP (20 micrograms i.c.) did not result in alterations in VCA activity nor did the VIP antagonists block the VCA reflex response to a rise in arterial pressure. However, none of the VIP antagonists reduced the VIP-induced tachycardia either.", 
    "135": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide is likely to play a part in the vagal cardiac accelerator system. However, conclusive evidence for its role as the terminal transmitter in the VCA pathway will have to wait for the availability of a specific cardiac VIP receptor antagonist."
