Several studies showed that OXA stimulates insulin secretion and proliferation of beta cells. However, mechanisms of action are still not well understood. Here, we investigated whether ERK and transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) play a role in mediating the effect of OXA on cell growth, insulin production, and secretion using the established INS-1E cell line. Cell proliferation was measured using BrdU assay. Insulin mRNA expression was detected by real-time PCR. Insulin secretion was assessed using ELISA. Intracellular calcium levels were measured using fluorescence calcium imaging (fura-2/AM). Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation was detected by Western blot. TRP channel activity was blocked by lanthanum (III) chloride (La(3+); 100 - 300 \u03bcM) or ruthenium red (RuR; 10 \u03bcM). OXA (100 nM) stimulated INS-1E cell proliferation, insulin secretion, intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, without changing insulin mRNA expression. Inhibition of ERK1/2 by 10 \u03bcM U0126 attenuated OXA-stimulated INS-1E cell proliferation. Blockade of TRP channel activity by La(3+) or RuR rendered OXA ineffective at modulating Ca(2+) regulation and insulin release. In contrast, the L-type channel blocker nifedipine (10 \u03bcM) failed to affect OXA-stimulated insulin release. Taken together, OXA increases INS-1E cell proliferation via ERK1/2-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, OXA stimulates insulin secretion from INS-1E cells. TRPs are relevant for OXA-stimulated insulin secretion and intracellular calcium regulation.", 
    "1": "Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) by nonlinear approaches has been gaining interest due to their ability to extract additional information from heart rate (HR) dynamics that are not detectable by traditional approaches. Nevertheless, the physiological interpretation of nonlinear approaches remains unclear. Therefore, we propose long-term (60 min) protocols involving selective blockade of cardiac autonomic receptors to investigate the contribution of sympathetic and parasympathetic function upon nonlinear dynamics of HRV. Conscious male Wistar rats had their electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded under three distinct conditions: basal, selective (atenolol or atropine), or combined (atenolol plus atropine) pharmacological blockade of autonomic muscarinic or \u03b21-adrenergic receptors. Time series of RR interval were assessed by multiscale entropy (MSE) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Entropy over short (1 to 5, MSE1-5) and long (6 to 30, MSE6-30) time scales was computed, as well as DFA scaling exponents at short (\u03b1short, 5 \u2264 n \u2264 15), mid (\u03b1mid, 30 \u2264 n \u2264 200), and long (\u03b1long, 200 \u2264 n \u2264 1,700) window sizes. The results show that MSE1-5 is reduced under atropine blockade and MSE6-30 is reduced under atropine, atenolol, or combined blockade. In addition, while atropine expressed its maximal effect at scale six, the effect of atenolol on MSE increased with scale. For DFA, \u03b1short decreased during atenolol blockade, while the \u03b1mid increased under atropine blockade. Double blockade decreased \u03b1short and increased \u03b1long Results with surrogate data show that the dynamics during combined blockade is not random. In summary, sympathetic and vagal control differently affect entropy (MSE) and fractal properties (DFA) of HRV. These findings are important to guide future studies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although multiscale entropy (MSE) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) are recognizably useful prognostic/diagnostic methods, their physiological interpretation remains unclear. The present study clarifies the effect of the cardiac autonomic control on MSE and DFA, assessed during long periods (1 h). These findings are important to help the interpretation of future studies.", 
    "2": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterised by an elevation in afterload imposed on the right ventricle (RV), leading to hypertrophy and failure. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a key role in the progression to heart failure, and the use of beta-blockers attenuates this process. The aim of this study was to verify the role of bucindolol, a\u03b21-, \u03b22- and \u03b11-blocker, on the ANS, and its association with RV function in rats with PAH. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, monocrotaline, control+bucindolol, and monocrotaline+bucindolol. PAH was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of monocrotaline (60mg/kg). After two weeks, animals were treated for seven days with bucindolol (2mg/kg/day i.p.) or vehicle. At the end of the treatment, animals underwent echocardiographic assessment, catheterisation of the femoral artery and RV, and tissue collection for morphometric and histological evaluation. In the monocrotaline+bucindolol group, there was a decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure (33%) and pulmonary congestion (21%), when compared to the monocrotaline. Bucindolol treatment also reduced RV pleomorphism, necrosis, fibrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells. An improvement in RV systolic function was also observed in the monocrotaline+bucindolol group compared to the monocrotaline. In addition, bucindolol promoted a decrease in the cardiac sympathovagal balance (93%) by reducing sympathetic drive (70%) and increasing parasympathetic drive (142%). Bucindolol also reduced blood pressure variability (75%). Our results show that the beneficial effects from bucindolol treatment appeared to be a consequence of the reversal of monocrotaline-induced autonomic imbalance.", 
    "3": "Regular exercise is shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects, yet the effects of acute exercise on cellular inflammatory responses and its mechanisms remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that sympathoadrenergic activation during a single bout of exercise has a suppressive effect on monocytic cytokine production mediated by \u03b22 adrenergic receptors (AR). We investigated the effects of 20-min moderate (65-70% VO2 peak) exercise-induced catecholamine production on LPS-stimulated TNF production by monocytes in 47 healthy volunteers and determined AR subtypes involved. We also examined the effects of \u03b2-agonist isoproterenol and endogenous \u03b2- and \u03b1-agonists epinephrine and norepinephrine, and receptor-subtype-specific \u03b2- and \u03b1-antagonists on TNF production in a series of in vitro investigations. LPS-stimulated TNF production by peripheral blood monocytes was determined intracellularly by flow cytometry, using an intracellular protein transport inhibitor. Percent TNF-producing monocytes and per-cell TNF production with and without LPS was suppressed by exercise with moderate to large effects, which was reversed by a \u03b22-AR antagonist in spite that plasma TNF levels did not change. This inhibitory response in TNF production by exercise was mirrored by \u03b2-AR agonists in an agonist-specific and dose-dependent manner in vitro: similar isoproterenol (EC50=2.1-4.7\u00d710(-10)M) and epinephrine (EC50=4.4-10\u00d710(-10)M) potency and higher norepinephrine concentrations (EC50=2.6-4.3\u00d710(-8)M) needed for the effects. Importantly, epinephrine levels observed during acute exercise in vivo significantly inhibited TNF production in vitro. The inhibitory effect of the AR agonists was abolished by \u03b22-, but not by \u03b21- or \u03b1-AR blockers. We conclude that the downregulation of monocytic TNF production during acute exercise is mediated by elevated epinephrine levels through \u03b22-ARs. Decreased inflammatory responses during acute exercise may protect against chronic conditions with low-grade inflammation.", 
    "4": "In several neurodegenerative diseases, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity is considered to be a major process to initiate cell degeneration. Indeed, subsequent to excessive glutamate receptor stimulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial dysfunction are regarded as two major gateways leading to neuron death. These processes are mimicked in an in vitro model of rat brainstem slice when excitotoxicity is induced by DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA), a specific glutamate-uptake blocker that increases extracellular glutamate. Our recent study has demonstrated that brainstem hypoglossal motoneurons, which are very vulnerable to this damage, were neuroprotected from excitotoxicity with nicotine application through the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and subsequent inhibition of ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study examined if endogenous cholinergic activity exerted any protective effect in this pathophysiological model and how ROS production (estimated with rhodamine fluorescence) and mitochondrial dysfunction (measured as methyltetrazolium reduction) were time-related during the early phase of excitotoxicity (0-4h). nAChR antagonists did not modify TBOA-evoked ROS production (that was nearly doubled over control) or mitochondrial impairment (25% decline), suggesting that intrinsic nAChR activity was insufficient to contrast excitotoxicity and needed further stimulation with nicotine to become effective. ROS production always preceded mitochondrial dysfunction by about 2h. Nicotine prevented both ROS production and mitochondrial metabolic depression with a delayed action that alluded to a complex chain of events targeting these two lesional processes. The present data indicate a relatively wide time frame during which strong nAChR activation can arrest a runaway neurotoxic process leading to cell death.",

Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biomarker associated with systemic inflammation and may predict cirrhotic decompensation and death. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic utility of high NLR (\u22654) for liver-related death among low MELD patients listed for LT, controlling for stage of cirrhosis. In a nested case-control study of cirrhotic adults awaiting LT (February 2002 to May 2011), cases were LT candidates with a liver-related death and MELD\u2009\u2264\u200920 within 90 days of death. Controls were similar LT candidates who were alive for \u226590 days after LT listing. NLR and other covariates were assessed at the date of lowest MELD, within 90 days of death for cases and within 90 days after listing for controls. There were 41 cases and 66 controls; MELD scores were similar. NLR 25th, 50th, 75th percentile cutoffs were 1.9, 3.1, and 6.8. NLR was\u2009\u2265\u20094 in 25/41 (61%) cases and in 17/66 (26%) controls.

In multivariate analysis, NLR of \u22651.9,\u2009\u2265\u20094,\u2009\u2265\u20096.8 were each associated with liver-related death. Furthermore, we found that NLR correlated with the frequency of circulating low-density granulocytes, previously identified as displaying proinflammatory properties, as well as monocytes. In conclusion, elevated NLR is associated with liver-related death, independent of MELD and cirrhosis stage. High NLR may aid in determining risk for cirrhotic decompensation, need for increased monitoring, and urgency for expedited LT in candidates with low MELD.

    "6": "The current primary prophylaxis for esophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients consists of nonselective \u03b2-blocker (NSBB) therapy. However, only approximately half of the patients achieve a sufficient hemodynamic response to NSBB therapy. Clinical application of hemodynamic response monitoring is still under debate. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the potential clinical value of monitoring the hemodynamic response to NSBB therapy using hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements in the primary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the COCHRANE Library. Randomized-controlled trials and case series that included cirrhotic patients receiving primary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding with NSBBs and hemodynamic response monitoring using HVPG measurements were included for analysis. The primary outcome measure was variceal bleeding. A fixed-effect analysis was carried out using the Mantel-Haenszel method for relative risks. Six of the 1172 papers found were selected on the basis of stringent selection criteria. Hemodynamic response (HVPG \u226412\u2009mmHg and/or a reduction of \u226520%, or \u226510% in one study, from baseline) to \u03b2-blocker therapy was associated significantly with a lower risk of variceal bleeding (relative risk=0.13, 95% confidence interval=0.06-0.29) compared with a nonresponse. Patients achieving a hemodynamic response to NSBB therapy have a lower risk of variceal bleeding than hemodynamic nonresponders. Hemodynamic monitoring in primary prophylaxis is of potential clinical value and requires further assessment in large cohort randomized-controlled trials.", 
    "7": "The \u03b21\u2011adrenergic receptor (AR) is the primary \u03b2\u2011AR subtype in the heart and is the target of metoprolol (Met), which is commonly used to treat angina and hypertension. Previous studies have revealed a positive correlation between the methylation levels of the adrenoreceptor \u03b21 gene (Adrb1) promoter in the myocardium with the antihypertensive activity of Met in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which affects \u03b21\u2011AR expression in H9C2 cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of myocardial \u03b21\u2011AR downregulation using short\u2011hairpin RNA (shRNA) against Adrb1 on the antihypertensive activity of Met in SHR. Recombinant adeno\u2011associated virus type 9 (rAAV9) vectors carrying Adrb1 shRNA (rAAV9\u2011Adrb1) or a negative control sequence (rAAV9\u2011NC) were generated and used to infect rat hearts via the pericardial cavity. The results of reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and western blotting analyses demonstrated that cardiac \u03b21\u2011AR expression in the rAAV9\u2011Adrb1 group was significantly downregulated when compared with the rAAV9\u2011NC group (P<0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.032, respectively). In addition, a greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was observed in the rAAV9\u2011NC group compared with the rAAV9\u2011Adrb1 group following Met treatment (P=0.035). Furthermore, downregulation of myocardial \u03b21\u2011AR was associated with a significant decrease in SBP (P<0.001). In conclusion, these data suggest that suppression of \u03b21\u2011AR expression in the myocardium reduces SBP and sensitivity to Met in SHR.",

Propranolol is a common choice though it is dosed every 6-8\u00a0h. We reviewed the clinical results of treating infant SVT with an extemporaneous preparation of nadolol. Retrospective cohort study of patients under 2\u00a0years old receiving nadolol for SVT at a single center. Patients were ascertained by patient and pharmacy databases. Twenty-eight infants received nadolol, of whom 25 had regular narrow complex tachycardia, 2 atrial flutter, and 1 focal atrial tachycardia. Patient age at initiation was a median 54\u00a0days (range 10-720). The final dose was 1\u00a0mg/kg/day in 22/28 patients (range 0.5-2).

NA modulates various brain functions including vision, but many questions about the functional role of its effects and mechanisms remain unclear. To explore these matters, we focused on three questions, 1) whether NA improves detectability of a behavior-relevant visual stimulus, 2) which receptor subtypes contribute to the NA effects, and 3) whether the NA effects are specific for visual features such as spatial frequency (SF). We measured contrast sensitivity in rats by a two-alternative forced choice visual detection task and tested the effects of NA receptor blockers in three SF conditions. Propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor inhibitor, significantly decreased contrast sensitivity, but neither prazosin nor idazoxan, \u03b11- and \u03b12-adrenergic receptor inhibitors, respectively, had an effect.

    "32": "Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is used to treat complications of cirrhosis such as variceal bleeding and refractory ascites, but it also bears the risk of liver failure, overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and cardiac decompensation. Variceal bleeding may be controlled using endoscopic and medical treatment in patients with compensated cirrhosis; in decompensated patients, however, TIPS improves survival. Therefore, an early TIPS (within 72h or if later, still early after bleeding) might improve the survival of patients by preventing an inflammatory response and bacterial translocation. Both these processes mediate an impaired immunological and hemodynamic response, thereby facilitating the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and/or death. Similarly, in patients with refractory ascites, TIPS should be used early in treatment to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) after precipitating events induced by complications of portal hypertension. Whether TIPS and/or embolization should be used to treat portal vein thrombosis and spontaneous shunts is still a matter of debate and should be further investigated. In summary, the careful selection of patients for TIPS is crucial. New biomarkers, especially those evaluating systemic inflammation and bacterial translocation, might improve the predictive value of established clinical parameters such as bilirubin and overt HE.

The study included 25 CSX patients (20 female/ 5 male, mean age: 55.36\u00b110.31 years) who received metoprolol (50 mg BID) for one month. In addition, 25 healthy controls (20 female/ 5 male, mean age: 54.32 \u00b19.27 years) were enrolled. Levels of endothelin-1, E-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in controls and CSX patients were measured, both at the baseline and after the treatment, by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In CSX patients, at the baseline, levels of E-selectin and VCAM-1 were significantly higher than those of the controls. In addition, levels of these biomarkers in CSX patients after the treatment significantly decreased compared to the baseline. In spite of similar tendency, these differences were not significant for endothelin-1. In conclusion, metoprolol therapy improves endothelial function. Thus, it may be a suggested choice for CSX treatment. However, further studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of metoprolol therapy for CSX patients.",

LCZ696 (valsartan/sacubitril, Entresto), the first of the new ARNI (dual-acting angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin inhibitor) drug class, contains equimolar amounts of valsartan, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, and sacubitril, a prodrug for the neprilysin inhibitor LBQ657. LCZ696 reduced blood pressure more than valsartan alone in patients with hypertension. In the PARADIGM-HF study, LCZ696 was superior to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and LCZ696 was approved by the FDA for this purpose in 2015. This approval was the first for chronic neprilysin inhibition. The many peptides metabolized by neprilysin suggest many potential consequences of chronic neprilysin inhibitor therapy, both beneficial and adverse. Moreover, LBQ657 might inhibit enzymes other than neprilysin. Chronic neprilysin inhibition might have an effect on angio-oedema, bronchial reactivity, inflammation, and cancer, and might predispose to polyneuropathy. Additionally, inhibition of neprilysin metabolism of amyloid-\u03b2 peptides might have an effect on Alzheimer disease, age-related macular degeneration, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Much of the evidence for possible adverse consequences of chronic neprilysin inhibition comes from studies in animal models, and the relevance of this evidence to humans is unknown. This Review summarizes current knowledge of neprilysin function and possible consequences of chronic neprilysin inhibition that indicate a need for vigilance in the use of neprilysin inhibitor therapy.",

A third was \"beta-blockers or adrenergic beta-antagonists AND hypertension AND age AND stroke or myocardial infarction or death\". A fourth was \"meta-analysis of beta-blockers AND hypertension AND age AND death, stroke, myocardial infarction\" RESULTS: Diastolic (with or without systolic) hypertension, in contrast to isolated systolic hypertension, occurs primarily in younger subjects, and is linked to overweight/obesity and increased sympathetic nerve activity. In younger/middle-aged hypertensive subjects, high plasma norepinephrine levels are linked (independent of blood pressure) to an increased risk of future cardiovascular events and death. High resting heart rates (a surrogate for high sympathetic nerve activity) likewise predict premature all-cause death, coronary heart disease and cardiovascular events in younger hypertensive subjects. In this younger/middle-aged hypertensive group, antihypertensive agents that increase sympathetic nerve activity (diuretics, dihydropyridine calcium blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)) do not decrease (and may increase) the risk of myocardial infarction, and are therefore inappropriate first-line agents in this age-group. By contrast, in younger/middle-aged hypertensive subjects (less than 60\u00a0years old), meta-analysis has shown that beta-blockers are significantly superior to randomised placebo, and at least as effective as randomised comparator agents, in reducing death/stroke/myocardial infarction. In this younger/middle-aged hypertensive group beta-blockers have been shown (vs randomised placebo or diuretics) to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction by 35-50\u2009%, and stroke by 50-55\u2009% (vs placebo), in non-smoker men. Atenolol was at least as effective as ACE-inhibition (captopril) in reducing all 7 cardiovascular endpoints (including stroke which was reduced by 50\u2009%), vs less tight control of blood pressure, in obese hypertensive subjects with type-2 diabetes (UKPDS study); and after 20 years follow-up, atenolol was significantly (23\u2009%) superior to the ACE-inhibitor in reducing the risk of all-cause death (beta-blockers have anti-cancer properties, which maybe relevant).",

The ADPs studied were tablet crush resistance or hardness, particle size distribution following mechanical manipulation, drug extraction in water and alcohol, syringeability and injectability. Other non-ADPs such as surface morphology and tablet dissolution were also studied. It was found that presence of 50% or more of water soluble or swellable excipient in the ADF tablets significantly affected the tablet hardness, particle size distribution following mechanical manipulation and drug extraction while small amount (5%) of excipients had either minimal or no effect on ADPs of these tablets. Addition of high molecular weight HPMC (K 100M) affected syringeability and injectability of ADF. Curing process was found to affect ADPs (hardness, particle size distribution, drug extraction and syringeability and injectability) when compared with uncured tablet. In conclusion, addition of large amount of excipients, especially water soluble ones in Polyox\u2122 based ADF tablets increase the risk of abuse by various routes of administration.",

This paper presents a study on the relaxant effect and underlying mechanisms of sodium tanshinone IIA sulphonate on mouse tracheal smooth muscle. The relaxant effect of sodium tanshinone IIA sulphonate was evaluated in mouse tracheal rings using a mechanical recording system. Intracellular Ca(2+) concentration was measured in primary cultured tracheal smooth muscle cells using confocal imaging system. The results showed that sodium tanshinone IIA sulphonate induced dose-dependent relaxation of mouse tracheal rings in a \u03b2-adrenoceptor- and epithelium-independent manner. Pretreatment with the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel blocker glibenclamide partly attenuated the relaxation response. Administration of sodium tanshinone IIA sulphonate notably inhibited the extracellular Ca(2+)-induced contraction. High KCl or carbachol-evoked elevation in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration was also abrogated by sodium tanshinone IIA sulphonate in tracheal smooth muscle cells. In conclusion, the tracheal relaxant effect of sodium tanshinone IIA sulphonate was independent of \u03b2-adrenoceptor and airway epithelium, mediated primarily by inhibition of extracellular Ca(2+) influx via L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels and partially by activation of the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel.

COPD and heart disease frequently coexist and people with both disorders have particularly high cardiovascular mortality. There are concerns about giving \u03b2-blockers to people with concomitant COPD that include reduced basal lung function, diminished effectiveness of emergency \u03b2-agonist treatments, reduced benefit of long-acting \u03b2-agonist treatment and difficulty in discriminating between asthma and COPD. \u03b2-Blockers appear to reduce lung function in both the general population and those with COPD because they are poorly selective for cardiac \u03b21-adrenoceptors over respiratory \u03b22-adrenoceptors, and studies have shown that higher \u03b2-agonist doses are required to overcome the \u03b2-blockade. COPD and cardiovascular disease share similar environmental risks and both disease states have high adrenergic and inflammatory activation. \u03b2-Blockers may therefore be particularly helpful in reducing cardiovascular events in this high-risk group. They may reduce the background inflammatory state, and inhibit the tachycardia and hypertension associated with both the endogenous adrenaline and high-dose \u03b2-agonist treatment associated with acute exacerbations of COPD. Some studies have suggested no increased and, at times, reduced mortality in patients with COPD taking \u03b2-blockers for heart disease. However, these are all observational studies and there are no randomised controlled trials. Potential ways to improve this dilemma include the development of highly \u03b21-selective \u03b2-blockers or the use of non-\u03b2-blocking heart rate reducing agents, such as ivabridine, if these are proven to be beneficial in randomised controlled trials.",

During the 162-d to 165-d exposure, no significant changes in weights or lengths were seen in fathead minnows, although the highest concentration of propranolol did cause a 15% decrease in survival of larval and juvenile stage fish compared with controls. At maturity, there were no significant changes in condition factor, liver-somatic index, or secondary sex characteristics in propranolol-exposed male or female fish. Female gonadosomatic index was significantly decreased in fish exposed to the highest concentrations of propranolol, probably because of increased egg-laying.

In-line Raman spectroscopy was implemented in the barrels, allowing monitoring of the melt during processing. The aim of this study was twofold: to investigate (I) the influence of key process parameters (screw speed - barrel temperature) upon the product solid-state transformation during processing of a sustained release formulation in recirculation mode; (II) the influence of process parameters (screw speed - barrel temperature - recirculation time) upon mixing of a crystalline drug (tracer) in an amorphous polymer carrier by means of residence time distribution (RTD) measurements. The results indicated a faster mixing endpoint with increasing screw speed. Processing a high drug load formulation above the drug melting temperature resulted in the production of amorphous drug whereas processing below the drug melting point produced solid dispersions with partially amorphous/crystalline drug. Furthermore, increasing the screw speed resulted in lower drug crystallinity of the solid dispersion. RTD measurements elucidated the improved mixing capacity when using the recirculation channel. In-line Raman spectroscopy has shown to be an adequate PAT-tool for product solid-state monitoring and elucidation of the mixing behavior during processing in a mini extruder.", 
    "89": "The Frank-Starling law of the heart is a physiological phenomenon that describes an intrinsic property of heart muscle in which increased cardiac filling leads to enhanced cardiac contractility. Identified more than a century ago, the Frank-Starling relationship is currently known to involve length-dependent enhancement of cardiac myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. However, the upstream molecular events that link cellular stretch to the length-dependent myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity are poorly understood. Because the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the multifunctional transducer protein \u03b2-arrestin have been shown to mediate mechanosensitive cellular signaling, we tested the hypothesis that these two proteins are involved in the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart. Using invasive hemodynamics, we found that mice lacking \u03b2-arrestin 1, \u03b2-arrestin 2, or AT1R were unable to generate a Frank-Starling force in response to changes in cardiac volume. Although wild-type mice pretreated with the conventional AT1R blocker losartan were unable to enhance cardiac contractility with volume loading, treatment with a \u03b2-arrestin-biased AT1R ligand to selectively activate \u03b2-arrestin signaling preserved the Frank-Starling relationship. Importantly, in skinned muscle fiber preparations, we found markedly impaired length-dependent myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity in \u03b2-arrestin 1, \u03b2-arrestin 2, and AT1R knockout mice. Our data reveal \u03b2-arrestin 1, \u03b2-arrestin 2, and AT1R as key regulatory molecules in the Frank-Starling mechanism, which potentially can be targeted therapeutically with \u03b2-arrestin-biased AT1R ligands.",

    "93": "The Lake Simcoe watershed in Ontario, Canada is an important recreational area and a recharge zone for groundwater resources. Lake Simcoe is a relatively shallow lotic system that has been impacted by urban development, recreation, industry and agriculture. As part of a watershed management plan, six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in this catchment basin were selected to measure the inputs of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) of wastewater origin. These WWTPs were recently upgraded to tertiary treatment for phosphorus removal. Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) were used to monitor for hydrophilic and hydrophobic CECs, respectively, in treated and untreated wastewater. The passive samplers were calibrated with performance reference compounds (PRCs) by measuring the loss of deuterated beta blocker drugs spiked into POCIS and the loss of PCB congeners spiked into SPMDs over the course of 14-day deployment periods. From the PRC data, field sampling rates of CECs were determined and applied to estimate time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations and mass loadings in mg/day/1000 members of the population serviced. In treated wastewater, TWA concentrations of an antibiotic, sulfamethoxazole, the prescription drugs, carbamazepine, naproxen and gemfibrozil, and the non-prescription drug, ibuprofen, were estimated to be in the low (<18\u00a0ng/L) range. The artificial sweeteners, sucralose and acesulfame, were particularly useful chemical tracers, with estimated TWA concentrations in treated wastewater ranging from 128 to 213\u00a0ng/L and 4 to 33\u00a0ng/L, respectively. The steroid hormones were detected only rarely in treated wastewater. Triclosan, triclocarban and the synthetic musks, HHCB and AHTN, were removed efficiently (>77\u00a0%), possibly because of the tertiary treatment technologies. Therefore, the mass loadings for these personal care products were all <5\u00a0mg/day/1000 people. Overall, this study indicates that tertiary treatment technologies designed for phosphorus removal do not entirely remove the target CECs.",

We show here that IgG isolated from such sera and also affinity-purified anti-HuD label enteric neurons and cause an immediate spike discharge in enteric and visceral sensory neurons. Both labelling and activation of enteric neurons was prevented by preincubation with the HuD antigen. Activation of enteric neurons was inhibited by the nicotinic receptor antagonists hexamethonium and dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine and reduced by the P2X antagonist pyridoxal phosphate-6-azo (benzene-2,4-disulfonic acid (PPADS) but not by the 5-HT3 antagonist tropisetron or the N-type Ca-channel blocker \u03c9-Conotoxin GVIA. Ca(++) imaging experiments confirmed activation of enteric neurons but not enteric glia. These findings demonstrate a direct excitatory action of ANNA-1, in particular anti-HuD, on visceral sensory and enteric neurons, which involves nicotinic and P2X receptors.

This sub-analysis included 3001 subjects to evaluate the achievement of target BP at a minimum of three points at 6-month intervals of clinical BP measurements during the study period. After randomization, the patients were categorized into two groups on the basis of achieved on-treatment target BP: a good control (GC) group achieving a BP\u2a7e66.7% of the target and a poor control (PC) group with a BP <66.6% of the target. For each of the two control groups, outcomes were compared among the three treatment groups. The event rates for cardiovascular composite endpoints, stroke and hard cardiovascular events were higher in the PC group than the GC group (P=0.041, P=0.042 and P=0.038, respectively). Within the PC group, hazard ratios for the incidence of cardiovascular events were lower in the benidipine-thiazide group than in the benidipine-BB group (composite cardiovascular events: 2.04, P=0.033; stroke: 4.14, P=0.005; and hard cardiovascular events: 3.52, P=0.009).

However, the underlying mechanisms have not been clarified. Methods and Results We experienced 22 cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy during 3 years, and 4 of these 22 cases were complicated with LVOT obstruction in the acute phase (mean age 79\u00b15 years, 1 man, 21 women). The LVOT pressure gradient in the acute phase was 100\u00b117 mmHg. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in one case and sigmoid-shaped septum without LVH in three cases. The complete resolution of the LVOT obstruction was achieved in a few days with normalization of the left ventricular wall motion following administration of beta-blockers. A dobutamine provocation test after normalization of the left ventricular wall motion reproduced the LVOT obstruction in all cases and revealed the presence of latent LVOT obstruction. Conclusion The manifestation of latent LVOT obstruction in the acute phase of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is one potential reason for the complication of LVOT obstruction with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.",

Both pre-clinical and clinical evidence of these effects, in multiple cancer types, is assessed and summarised and relevant mechanisms of action outlined. In particular there is evidence that PRO is effective at multiple points in the metastatic cascade, particularly in the context of the post-surgical wound response. Based on this evidence the case is made for further clinical investigation of the anticancer effects of PRO, particularly in combination with other agents.

Although its properties, his clinical use is limited due to the occurrence of nephrotoxicity, which has been related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Carvedilol, an antihypertensive drug with strong antioxidant properties, has been tested in order to prevent gentamicin nephrotoxicity. This study aimed to test this hypothesis using a rat model of gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. Animals were treated subcutaneously with DMSO (control) (0.4%/kg/24h bw) for 11days; with carvedilol (2mg/kg/24h bw) for 11days; with gentamicin (60mg/kg/24h bw) for the last 8days and with carvedilol (2mg/kg/24h bw) for 11days and with gentamicin (60mg/kg/24h bw) for the last 8days. Estimations of urine creatinine, urine carboxylic acids, blood urea, serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate were carried out after the last administered dose of gentamicin. Mitochondria functionality was analyzed by monitoring its bioenergetics function and cardiolipin oxidized products were analyzed by ESI-MS. The kidneys were also examined for morphological changes. Gentamicin caused marked nephrotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by several mitochondrial parameters. Carvedilol did not induce significant changes while the co-treatment exacerbated the negative effect of gentamicin although maintaining ATP levels and membrane potential. Kidneys from gentamicin treated rats, with and without carvedilol, showed necrosis of tubular cells in renal cortex. Higher values on relative abundance of cardiolipin oxidation products identified as [M-2H](2-) ions, at m/z 771 were observed in the groups treated with gentamicin. The observed effects were associated to a possible interaction of carvedilol with F1F0-ATP synthase that merit further investigation. In conclusion, carvedilol may contribute to the exacerbation of renal dysfunction induced by gentamicin, at least in some physiological and biochemical parameters. From a clinical perspective, and until further conclusions, cautious use of both drugs in combination is advised with particular emphasis in patients presenting mitochondrial disorders.",

    "126": "Streptozotocin (STZ), a naturally occurring chemical, is toxic to the various kinds of cells such as insulin-producing beta cells. However, the beneficial effect of STZ on neuronal cells such as neurite outgrowth-inducing activity has been unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of STZ on neurite outgrowth in mouse neuronal Neuro2a cells. STZ (0.01 mM~5 mM) exerted remarkable neurite outgrowth-inducing activity in Neuro2a cells in a concentration dependent manner. STZ also had the same neurite outgrowth-inducing activity as that of retinoic acid (RA), which is well known neurite outgrowth inducer. As with the result of RA treatment, STZ administration increased MAP2-positive cells. The MAP2-positive cells reflect neurite outgrowth-induced cells. STZ (0.01 mM~5 mM) did not induce cell death, but significantly decreased cell proliferation. The serine/threonine kinase Akt, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), was transiently phosphorylated at Ser473 and at Thr303 by STZ (5 mM) administration. Glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), which has been reported to be inactivated by Akt, was also transiently phosphorylated at Ser9 by STZ (5 mM) administration. In addition, a blocker of PI3K, LY294002 (10 \u03bcM), significantly attenuated STZ-induced neurite outgrowth. These results suggest that STZ induces neurite outgrowth via activation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and GSK3\u03b2 inhibition.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers are recommended first-line agents for heart failure. We hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers could prevent trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. Patients and Methods In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive treatment with perindopril, bisoprolol, or placebo (1:1:1) for the duration of trastuzumab adjuvant therapy. Patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and post-cycle 17 for the determination of left ventricular volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Cardiotoxicity was evaluated as the change in indexed left ventricular end diastolic volume and LVEF. Results Thirty-three patients received perindopril, 31 received bisoprolol, and 30 received placebo. Baseline demographic, cancer, and cardiovascular profiles were similar between groups. Study drugs were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. After 17 cycles of trastuzumab, indexed left ventricular end diastolic volume increased in patients treated with perindopril (+7 \u00b1 14 mL/m(2)), bisoprolol (+8 mL \u00b1 9 mL/m(2)), and placebo (+4 \u00b1 11 mL/m(2); P = .36). In secondary analyses, trastuzumab-mediated decline in LVEF was attenuated in bisoprolol-treated patients (-1 \u00b1 5%) relative to the perindopril (-3 \u00b1 4%) and placebo (-5 \u00b1 5%) groups ( P = .001). Perindopril and bisoprolol use were independent predictors of maintained LVEF on multivariable analysis. Conclusion Perindopril and bisoprolol were well tolerated in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who received trastuzumab and protected against cancer therapy-related declines in LVEF; however, trastuzumab-mediated left ventricular remodeling-the primary outcome-was not prevented by these pharmacotherapies.",

Earlier, we reported that arsenic-mediated enhancement of angiotensin II (AngII) signaling can impair vascular physiology. Here, we investigated whether the AT1 receptor (AT1R) blocker candesartan can ameliorate the arsenic-induced hypertensive vascular remodeling in rats and whether the amelioration could relate to attenuation in vascular AngII and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Rats were exposed to sodium arsenite (50ppm) through drinking water for 90 consecutive days. Candesartan (1mg/kg bw, orally) was administered once daily during the last 30days of arsenic exposure. Non-invasive blood pressure was recorded weekly in conscious rats, while AngII-induced change in mean arterial pressure in anaesthetized rats was measured by invasive method on the 91st day. On this day, blood was collected from other animals for measuring AngII level. Western blot of AT1, AT2 and T\u03b2RII receptors; ELISA of PTK, RasGAP, ERK-1/2, TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF; immunohistochemistry of phosphorylated Smad3, Smad4 and collagen III, hydroxyproline/total collagen estimation, collagen deposition by Masson's trichrome staining and histomorphometry were carried out in thoracic aorta. Arsenic increased non-invasive systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure. Further, AngII caused concentration-dependent incremental change in mean arterial pressure in the arsenic-exposed rats. Arsenic upregulated AT1 and T\u03b2RII receptor proteins; elevated the levels of PTK, ERK-1/2, TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF, decreased RasGAP level and augmented the immunoreactivities of Smad3, Smad4 and collagen III. Arsenic also increased hydroxyproline/total collagen level, proliferation of collagen fibres and thickness of aortic wall and collagenous adventitia. Candesartan normalized blood pressure, regularized receptor expressions, MAP kinase and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, restored collagen deposition and regressed aortic thickness. Our results demonstrate that candesartan can ameliorate the arsenic-mediated systemic hypertension and vascular remodeling in rats by regularizing the signaling pathways of AngII and TGF-\u03b2.", 
    "141": "In the Alzheimer's disease (AD), entorhinal-hippocampal circuit is one of the earliest affected networks. There are some evidences indicating abnormal neuronal excitability and impaired synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) of AD animal model. However, the underlying mechanism leading to DG dysfunction particularly in the early phase of AD is not known. Since calcium dyshomeostasis has a critical role in the etiology of AD, it is possible that this phenomenon precedes electrophysiological alteration in the DG. Here, the effect of the amyloid pathogenesis in the entorhinal cortex (EC) on high activated Ca(2+) currents in the DG granule cells was investigated. One week after bilaterally injection of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) 1-42 into the EC, Ca(2+) currents in the DG granule cells were assessed by whole cell patch clamp. Voltage clamp recording showed the amplitude of high voltage calcium currents in the DG granule cells was decreased following EC amyloidopathy. However, the Ca(2+) current decay was slower than control. Double-pulse recording revealed that Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of calcium current (CDI) was more pronounced in the EC-A\u03b2 group compared to the control group. However, chronic treatment by calcium channel blocker (CCBs), isradipine or nimodipine, reverse the Ca(2+) currents toward the control level. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the calbindin level in the DG of different groups. In conclusion, our results suggest that A\u03b2 in the EC independent of calbindin level triggers a decreased Ca(2+) currents along with increased CDI in the DG granule cells which may lead to further electrophysiological alterations in these cells, and treatment by CCBs could preserve normal calcium current and may ultimately normal function against the A\u03b2 toxicity.",

Aortic blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, and augmentation index were assessed by applanation tonometry. Endothelial function was studied by forearm post-ischemic flow mediated vasodilatation and by pulse wave analysis with beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist stimulation. Skin microvascular reactivity was assessed by laser Doppler fluxmetry and iontophoresis. Treatment with doxazosin or ramipril reduced aortic and brachial blood pressures (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with greater reductions in aortic than brachial systolic blood pressures (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021) and aortic/brachial pulse pressure ratio (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Compared to doxazosin, ramipril reduced carotid-femoral and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Forearm endothelial dependent and independent vasodilatation, assessed by post-ischemic flow mediated vasodilatation and glyceryl trinitrate, and by pulse wave analysis remained unchanged by both doxazosin and ramipril. In addition, skin microvascular endothelial dependent (acetylcholine) and independent vasodilatation (sodium nitroprusside) remained unchanged. In conclusion, ramipril reduced indices of aortic stiffness, suggesting that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy may have effects beyond blood pressure reduction. However, treatment did not appear to influence endothelial function. Evidence of endothelial dysfunction and its possible improvement by antihypertensive treatment might require more advanced hypertension.This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02901977) and at EudraCT (# 2007-000631-25).",

The life-time diagnosis of myocardial injury due to eosinophilic infiltration is rare, or it is diagnosed at the stage of necrotizing endomyocarditis, when the treatment is no longer effective. A number of issues regarding the individual aspects of the pathogenesis of hypereosinophilic syndrome and Loeffler endocarditis are still not fully understood, as well as the long-term prospects for the use of drugs for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome, especially in young and middle-aged persons. Loeffler endocarditis can be suspected in the presence of hypereosinophilia on the background of causeless (unexplainable) hypertrophy of the left ventricle or both ventricles.

The purpose of this study was to determine the predictors of the response to pharmacological therapy in children with EAT. From January 2009 to April 2014, 115 children were admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of EAT and placed on antiarrhythmic drugs. We examined the clinical history, response to therapy, and follow-up of the children. The incidence of TIC secondary to EAT was 22.6% (n\u00a0=\u00a026) in children. Incessant EAT accounted for 44.3% of all patients. Control of EAT with antiarrhythmic therapy was achieved in 73.9% (n\u00a0=\u00a085) of the children. The combination of sotalol and propafenone performed well in controlling EAT in children [complete control in 35 (49.3%) of 71]. The mean time of conversion to sinus rhythm was 24\u00a0days, and the mean duration of therapy was 11\u00a0months in children with resolution.

The gestational day 13 rat embryo is a good model for the human embryo at 5-6 weeks gestation, as the heart is comparable in development and, like the human embryo, has no functional autonomic nerve supply at this stage. Utilizing a whole-embryo culture technique, we examined the effects of different pharmacological agents on HR under normoxic (95% oxygen) and hypoxic (20% oxygen) conditions. Oxygen concentrations \u226460% caused a concentration-dependent decrease in HR from normal levels of ~210 bpm. An adenosine agonist, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator and KATP channel opener all caused bradycardia in normoxic conditions; however, putative antagonists for these systems failed to prevent or ameliorate hypoxia-induced bradycardia. This suggests that the activation of one or more of these systems is not the primary cause of the observed hypoxia-induced bradycardia. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation also decreased HR in normoxic conditions, highlighting the importance of ATP levels. The \u03b2-blocker metoprolol caused a concentration-dependent reduction in HR supporting reports that \u03b21-adrenergic receptors are present in the early rat embryonic heart. The cAMP inducer colforsin induced a positive chronotropic effect in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

A total of 6,343,747 individuals in the period between 1996 and 2012 were analyzed. The overall incidence rate of new-onset glaucoma patients was 0.07 per 1000 person-years for the reference population compared to 36 per 1000 person-years for all diagnosed DM cases. Patients treated with DM drugs had about two times higher relative risk of glaucoma, when adjusting for a range of factors.

In this study, NC-derived cells were ablated with diphtheria toxin in double-transgenic mice expressing NC-specific Cre and Cre-driven diphtheria toxin receptor with yellow fluorescent protein reporter. We found that yellow fluorescent protein-expressing, NC-derived nonhematopoietic cells in BM expressed hematopoietic factors Cxcl12 and stem cell factor The ablation of NC-derived cells led to a significant decrease in B cell progenitors but not in hematopoietic stem cells or myeloid lineage cells in BM. Interestingly, plasma noradrenaline was markedly decreased in these mice. The i.p. administration of 6-hydroxydopamine, a known neurotoxin for noradrenergic neurons, led to a similar phenotype, whereas the administration of a noradrenaline precursor in NC-ablated mice partially rescued this phenotype. Additionally, the continuous administration of adrenergic receptor \u03b2 antagonists partially decreased the number of B cell progenitors while preserving B lymphopoiesis in vitro. Taken together, our results indicate that NC-derived cell depletion leads to abnormal B lymphopoiesis partially through decreased plasma noradrenaline, suggesting this as a novel mechanism regulated by molecules released by the sympathetic neurons.",

Despite being tense, she walked to the operating room. Approximately 2 minutes after an intravenous line was established by an anesthesia resident, severe hypoxia and bradycardia developed, and she lost consciousness. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated immediately, and after 1 minute, she regained consciousness, and her breathing and circulation recovered. After admission to the intensive care unit, emergency coronary angiography was performed. The blood flow in all the coronary arteries was normal. However, a decrease in the apical left ventricular wall motion and an increase in the basal wall motion were observed. Based on these findings, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was diagnosed. The wall motion gradually improved and the patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 15. The respiratory depression and bradycardia were thought to be due to an inadvertent bolus of remifentanil. We surmised that the patient had received a slight amount of retained medication when the anesthesia resident established the intravenous line, which caused severe respiratory depression. It is important to note that adverse effects such as severe respiratory depression and bradycardia can be caused by even small doses of remifentanil.",

In this paper, we describe the case of a 61-year-old woman admitted to the intensive cardiac care unit for pre-syncope and persistent hypotension. Clinical and echocardiographic data were suggestive of tako-tsubo syndrome with severe dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and severe mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography was normal. Inotropic agents were not administered, because absolutely contraindicated in the presence of LVOT obstruction: indeed, they may worsen the dynamic gradient with further hemodynamic compromise. The patient was, therefore, initially treated with intravenous fluid infusion and, later on, with beta-blockers; the patient had a regular clinical recovery, with progressive disappearance of ECG and echocardiographic abnormalities. This case confirms that an early echocardiographic diagnosis of LVOT obstruction is essential for therapeutic decision-making, especially in the setting of tako-tsubo syndrome presenting with compromised hemodynamic status.",

Cardiac disease in hyperthyroidism mostly manifests itself as tachycardia but more serious cardiac findings have also been described. A 5-year-old male with recent strep throat infection presented with dilated cardiomyopathy, hematuria, and symptoms and lab findings consistent with severe hyperthyroidism. He was diagnosed with thyroid storm secondary to concurrent Graves' disease and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). After starting the treatment with methimazole and a beta-blocker, his cardiac disease gradually improved and the PSGN resolved over time. There are no specific pediatric criteria for thyroid storm. Adult criteria can be difficult to apply to pediatric cases. Criteria for diagnosis of thyroid storm are less clear for pediatric patients. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a rare cardiac manifestation of hyperthyroidism. PSGN is due to glomerular immune complexes and can complicate group A strep infection. Providers should be aware of cardiac disease as a complication of hyperthyroidism. PSGN should not mechanistically be related to hyperthyroidism but can precipitate the signs of thyroid storm such as hypertension.

Nebivolol (5 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 14 days has a hepatoprotective effect shown by significant decrease in hepatic injury parameters (serum AST and ALT) with significant suppression of hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) which were elevated with APAP administration. Also, nebivolol increased reduced glutathione (GSH) which was reduced with APAP administration. Moreover, immunohistochemical examination revealed that nebivolol treatment markedly reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, while expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was markedly enhanced, as compared to APAP group. The protective effects of nebivolol were also verified histopathologically. On the other hand, as compared to APAP group, oral administration of atenolol (50 mg/kg) increased hepatic injury parameters but did not change hepatic NO, MDA, and GSH.

We measured Kisspeptin and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) mRNA and protein levels by qRT-PCR and western blot and counted primordial, primary and secondary follicles at 8, 10 and 12 months of age. The results showed that ovarian KISS1 decreased but FSHR increased after both propranolol administration and the surgical denervation in rats of 8, 10 and 12 months of age. An increase in FSHR was related to an increase in the number of smaller secondary follicles and a decreased number of primordial follicles at 8, 10 and 12 months of age. These results suggest that intraovarian KISS1 is regulated by sympathetic nerves via a beta-adrenergic receptor and participates locally in ovarian follicular development in reproductive aging.", 
    "215": "A 65-year-old obese Caucasian woman presented with symptomatic postprandial hypoglycemic episodes, resolution of symptoms with carbohydrate intake and significantly elevated anti-insulin antibody levels. She did not have any evidence for the use of oral antidiabetic medications, insulin, herbal substances, performing strenuous exercise or history of bariatric surgery. Fingerstick blood glucose readings revealed blood sugar of 35\u2009mg/dL and 48\u2009mg/dL, when she had these symptoms. Her medical history was significant for morbid obesity, hypothyroidism and gastro esophageal reflux disease. Her home medications included levothyroxine, propranolol and omeprazole. A blood sample obtained during the symptoms revealed the following: fingerstick blood sugar 38\u2009mg/dL, venous blood glucose 60\u2009mg/dL (normal (n): 70-99\u2009mg/dL), serum insulin 202\u2009IU/mL (n: <21), proinsulin 31.3\u2009pmol/L (n: <28.9), C-peptide 8\u2009ng/mL (n: 0.9-7), beta-hydroxybutyrate 0.12\u2009mmol/L (n: 0.02-0.27) anti-insulin antibody >45.4\u2009U/mL (n: <0.4). The result obtained while screening for serum sulfonylurea and meglitinides was negative. The repeated episodes of postprandial hypoglycemia associated with significantly elevated anti-insulin antibodies led to a diagnosis of insulin antibody syndrome (IAS). Significant improvement of hypoglycemic symptoms and lower anti-insulin antibody levels (33\u2009U/mL) was noted on nutritional management during the following 6 months. Based on a report of pantoprazole-related IAS cases, her omeprazole was switched to a H2 receptor blocker. She reported only two episodes of hypoglycemia, and anti-insulin antibody levels were significantly lower at 10\u2009U/mL after the following 12-month follow-up.", 
    "216": "Initial assessment of the Whipple criteria is critical to establish the clinical diagnosis of hypoglycemia accurately.Blood sugar monitoring with fingerstick blood glucose method can provide important information during hypoglycemia workup.Autoimmune hypoglycemia is a rare cause of hypoglycemia, which can be diagnosed on high index of clinical suspicion and systematic evaluation."
