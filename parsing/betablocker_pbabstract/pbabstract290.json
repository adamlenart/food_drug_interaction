    "0": "Secondary failure due to late restenosis continues to occur in 30-50% of individuals after PTCA. beta-Blockers play an important role in the treatment of CAD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the new beta-blocker nebivolol on cell proliferation of human coronary smooth muscle cells (haCSMCs) and endothelial cells (haECs) in comparison to traditional beta-blockers.", 
    "1": "The effect of nebivolol and other beta-blockers on proliferation of HaECs and HaCSMCs was analyzed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Apoptosis was measured by determination of hypodiploid DNA in both cell types. Additionally, in HaECs NO formation, endothelin-1 transcription and secretion were determined.", 
    "2": "Incubation for 1, 2, 4, 7 or 14 days resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent reduction of proliferation up to 80% in HaECs and HaCSMCs. beta-Blockers such as propranolol, metoprolol or bisoprolol did not exert this effect. Nebivolol inhibited accelerated haCSMC proliferation even in the presence of growth factors such as TGFbeta(1) and PDGF-BB. Nebivolol concentration-dependently induced a moderate apoptosis (10(-5) mol/l: 23%) and a decrease of haCSMCs in the S-phase by 66%. HaECs showed comparable results. During nebivolol incubation NO formation of HaCEs increased, while endothelin-1 transcription and secretion were suppressed.", 
    "3": "Whereas classical beta-blockers do not affect cell growth, only nebivolol inhibits haCSMC or haEC proliferation and induces a moderate rate of apoptosis. Furthermore, in HaCEs NO formation increases and endothelin-1 secretion decreases suggesting that nebivolol may represent a beta-blocker with great promises in CAD therapy.", 
    "4": "beta-Blockers improve cardiac function and survival in heart failure patients. The underlying mechanisms are not completely elucidated. Differences between agents might be important for the development of more specific therapeutical approaches. This study investigated whether metoprolol or carvedilol alter beta-adrenergic signaling differently.", 
    "5": "beta-Adrenoceptor density and systolic function were determined in rat adult ventricular cardiac myocytes.", 
    "6": "12 h isoprenaline-treatment (Iso, 1 micromol/l) reduced beta-adrenoceptor density by 33% (P<0.01). The effect was abolished by incubation with isoprenaline plus metoprolol (3 micromol/l), but was more pronounced after coincubation with carvedilol (0.003 micromol/l, P<0.05 Carv vs. Iso). Metoprolol alone had no effect on beta-adrenoceptor density, but carvedilol induced a decrease in receptor density even in absence of isoprenaline (P<0.05 Carv vs. ctr.). The isoprenaline (0.0003-10 micromol/l) induced concentration-dependent increase in myocyte shortening was blunted after 12 h preincubation with Iso (1 micromol/l, P<0.001). This reduction was abolished or partly prevented by coincubation with metoprolol or carvedilol, respectively. Carvedilol decreased the number of receptors which had to be occupied by isoprenaline in order to obtain 50% and 90% increase in myocyte cell shortening. Comparison of guanine nucleotide-dependent binding characteristics of isoprenaline, carvedilol and metoprolol revealed beta-receptor agonist like binding characteristics for carvedilol, but antagonist like binding characteristics for metoprolol.", 
    "7": "Metoprolol but not carvedilol prevents isoprenaline-induced downregulation of myocyte beta-adrenoceptors. The difference might be due to specific binding properties of the beta-blockers. Restoration of isoprenaline responsiveness by carvedilol might be due to improved coupling of beta-receptors to postreceptor effects.", 
    "8": "The aryloxypropanolamine carvedilol is a multiple action cardiovascular drug with blocking effects on alpha-receptors, beta-receptors, Ca(2+)-channels, Na(+)-channels and various native cardiac K(+) channels, thereby prolonging the cardiac action potential. In a number of clinical trials with patients suffering from congestive heart failure, carvedilol appeared to be superior to other beta-blocking agents in reducing total mortality. Given the multiple pharmacological actions of carvedilol, this may be due to specific channel blockade rather than beta-antagonistic activity. Since human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) K(+)channels play a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, the effects of carvedilol on HERG K(+)channels were investigated.", 
    "9": "Double-electrode voltage-clamp experiments were performed on HERG potassium channels which were expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes.", 
    "10": "Carvedilol at a concentration of 10 microM blocked HERG potassium tail currents by 47%. The electrophysiological characteristics of HERG, i.e. activation, steady-state inactivation and recovery from inactivation were not affected by carvedilol. Inhibition of current gradually increased from 0% immediately after the test pulse to about 80% at 600 ms with subsequent marginal changes of current kinetics during the resting 29 s, indicating a very fast open channel block by carvedilol as the major blocking mechanism.", 
    "11": "This is the first study demonstrating that carvedilol blocks HERG potassium channels. The biophysical data presented in this study with a potentially antiarrhythmic effect may contribute to the positive outcome of clinical trials with carvedilol.", 
    "12": "The serotonin (5-HT) syndrome is the most serious side effect of antidepressants, and it often necessitates pharmacotherapy. In the present study, the efficacy of several drugs was evaluated in an animal model of the 5-HT syndrome. When 2 mg/kg of clorgyline, a type-A monoamine oxidase inhibiting antidepressant, and 100 mg/kg of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, a precursor of 5-HT, were administered intraperitoneally to rats to induce the 5-HT syndrome, the rectal temperature of the rats increased to more than 40 degrees C, and all of the animals died by 90 min after the drug administration. The noradrenaline (NA) levels in the anterior hypothalamus, measured by microdialysis, increased to 15.9 times the preadministration level. Pretreatment with propranolol (10 mg/kg), a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist as well as a beta-blocker, and dantrolene (20 mg/kg), a peripheral muscle relaxant, did not prevent the death of the animals, even though these two drugs suppressed the increase in rectal temperature to some extent. Chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine prevented the lethality associated with the 5-HT syndrome only at high doses. By contrast, pretreatment with ritanserin (3 mg/kg) and pipamperone (20 mg/kg), both potent 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists, completely prevented the increase in rectal temperature and death of the animals, and the hypothalamic NA levels in these two groups increased less than that in the other groups. These results suggest that potent 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists are the most effective drugs for treatment of the 5-HT syndrome, and that NA hyperactivity occurs in the 5-HT syndrome.", 
    "13": "The present study was done to investigate the contribution of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to the drinking response caused by activation of the subfornical organ (SFO) following angiotensin II (ANG II) injections in the awake rat. Microinjection of ANG II into the SFO elicited the drinking response. Previous injections of either saralasin, an ANG II antagonist, or phentolamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, bilaterally into the PVN resulted in the significant attenuation of the drinking response to ANG II. Similar injections of any of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol, the muscarinic antagonist atropine, or saline vehicle into the PVN had no significant effect on the drinking response. In an attempt to clarify the neural mechanisms in the PVN involved in the drinking response to ANG II injected into the SFO, the effect of microinjection of ANG II into the SFO on noradrenaline (NA) release in the PVN was examined using intracerebral microdialysis techniques. The injection of the ANG II, but not saline vehicle, significantly enhanced the NA release in the region of the PVN. These results indicate the involvement of both the angiotensinergic and alpha-adrenergic systems in the PVN in the drinking response caused by angiotensinergic activation of the SFO, and imply that the angiotensinergic projections from the SFO to the PVN may serve to increase NA release which results in mediating water intake.", 
    "14": "Nitric oxide (NO) is continuously produced in the lung and can be measured in exhaled gas of different species. To investigate a possible neuro-humoral regulation of pulmonary NO production in vivo we injected veratrine, an activator of Na(+) channels known to activate the sympathoadrenal system, in anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated and laparotomized rabbits. Exhaled NO concentration increased by 38+/-3% when plasma adrenaline rose from 12.3+/-3.1 to 49.5+/-10.7 pmol ml(-1) in response to veratrine (500 microg kg(-1), i.v.). Pretreatment with atenolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist (1 mg kg(-1)), or bilateral ligation of adrenal blood vessels inhibited the increase in exhaled NO in response to veratrine. Atenolol also decreased basal NO, suggesting an endogenous regulation of pulmonary NO by adrenaline. Neither phentolamine (1 mg kg(-1)), atropine (1 mg kg(-1)) nor vagotomy inhibited the veratrine-induced pulmonary NO production. These results suggest a role of the sympathoadrenal system in the regulation of pulmonary NO production.", 
    "15": "Smooth muscle (SM), a major component of prostate stroma, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia. In many muscle systems, steroid hormones and alpha(1)-adrenergic neurotransmitters tightly regulate expression of contractile proteins. In this study, SM content and the expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) in tissues from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia treated with androgen ablation or alpha-blockade were compared with untreated controls.", 
    "16": "Prostatic periurethral tissue specimens from patients receiving luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues (n = 12), alpha-blocking agents (n = 12), and no treatment (n = 13) were examined. The samples were analyzed for SM MHC mRNA expression using competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. SM content was measured by morphometric analysis of trichrome-stained sections.", 
    "17": "Stromal SM constituted 45.4% +/- 8.6%, 48.1% +/- 18.4%, and 45.9% +/- 10.8% of the total tissue in androgen ablated, alpha-blocked, and untreated tissues, respectively. No significant difference was observed among these three groups (P = 0.84, analysis of variance). However, SM MHC mRNA expression was markedly decreased in the alpha-blockade group (0.15 +/- 0.02 attomole/mg tissue) compared with the androgen-ablated (0.58 +/- 0.15 attomole/mg tissue) or control (0.44 +/- 0.10 attomole/mg tissue) groups. The relationship between SM content and expression of SM MHC significantly differed among the groups (P = 0.02, analysis of variance).", 
    "18": "Androgen ablation and alpha-blockade do not appear to alter the histologic characteristics of prostate stroma in men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, contractile protein gene expression in stromal SM cells is significantly altered after alpha-blockade. These data suggest that, in addition to the simple relaxation of muscle tone, alpha-blocking agents may affect the phenotypic expression of contractile proteins in prostate SM cells.", 
    "19": "To explore the possible involvement of beta adrenoceptor antagonists in the previously observed anticonvulsive effect of swim stress, the mice were, prior to administration of convulsants, pre-treated with propranolol (a non-selective beta adrenoceptor antagonist), betaxolol (a selective beta-1 adrenoreceptor antagonist), or ICI 118,551 (a selective beta-2 adrenoreceptor antagonist). In control unstressed animals, only propranolol [10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (ip)] produced a significant change. It enhanced the threshold dose of picrotoxin producing tonic hindlimb extension. However, in swim-stressed animals, propranolol enhanced doses of picrotoxin producing tonic hindlimb extension and death, while betaxolol (20 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced doses of picrotoxin producing running/bouncing clonus, tonic hindlimb extension and death. Pre-treatment with ICI 118,551 (4 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to affect doses of picrotoxin producing convulsions and death. The results demonstrate that blockade of beta-1 adrenoceptors potentiates the anticonvulsant effect of swim stress against convulsions produced by picrotoxin, a noncompetitive GABA(A) receptor antagonist.", 
    "20": "Autonomic impairment is related to the incidence of sudden death in chronic heart failure (CHF). Our objective was to study autonomic profiles in patients with mild CHF due to coronary artery disease, and to investigate the value of add-on beta-blockade.", 
    "21": "Measures of autonomic function (plasma norepinephrine, heart rate [HR] variability, autonomic function testing), and exercise capacity, were compared between 24 patients with mild CHF, and 24 healthy controls. In this mechanistic study, we assessed the effect of 26 weeks metoprolol treatment in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. All patients received metoprolol sustained release (200 mg; n=12) or placebo (n=12). Assessments were made at baseline and after 10 and 26 weeks' treatment. At baseline, norepinephrine levels were elevated, while HR variability parameters were decreased in patients vs. controls (both P<0.05). Autonomic function testing showed only small differences, although significant alterations were observed with deep breathing and head up tilting (both P<0.05). After 26 weeks', metoprolol did not affect exercise capacity or norepinephrine concentrations. In contrast, HR variability was markedly improved in metoprolol-treated patients vs. placebo-treated patients (P<0.05). In particular, a shift toward normal in the sympathovagal balance was observed (P<0.05). Autonomic function testing showed only small, and generally non-significant trends after metoprolol.", 
    "22": "Marked autonomic abnormalities are already present in mild CHF, which may be (partially) reversed by metoprolol. These observations support the reported reduction of sudden death by beta-blockade in patients with CHF.", 
    "23": "The effect of inositol as an antidepressant was previously demonstrated in both animal models of depression-like behavior and in clinical trials. Unlike most antidepressant drugs, inositol does not have a clear target in the synapse and was not demonstrated to alter monoamine levels in the brain. The present study attempted to draw a psychopharmacological profile of inositol's behavioral effects by exploring the interactions between the drug and specific receptor agonists and antagonists in the forced swim test. Rats received inositol treatment (or control) in combination with the serotonergic metabolism inhibitor PCPA or with the noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4. Results indicated that PCPA but not DSP-4 abolished the ability of inositol to cause a reduction in immobility time in the forced swim test. In mice, the specific 5-HT(2A)/5-HT(2C) antagonist ritanserin, but not the 5-HT(1A)/5-HT(1B)/beta adrenergic antagonist pindolol, abolished inositol's effect in the forced swim test. The 5-HT(2A)/5-HT(2C) agonist DOI and the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT did not have any significant effects on inositol's activity. The present data indicates that the antidepressant effect of inositol may involve 5-HT(2) receptors. It is thus possible that the effects of reuptake antidepressant drugs and the effects of inositol may have a common final pathway.", 
    "24": "Regular exercise resulting in release of catecholamines is an oxidant stress, and yet it protects humans from acute cardiac events. We designed this study to examine the effect of epinephrine on free radical release and endogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene and protein expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). HCAECs were incubated with epinephrine (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) alone or with the water-soluble analog of vitamin E (trolox) (10(-5) M), the lipid-soluble vitamin E (5 x 10(-5) M), or the beta(1)-adrenergic blocker atenolol (10(-5) M). At 1 and 24 h of incubation with epinephrine, superoxide anion generation increased by 102 and 81% in the HCAECs. There was a marked increase in both MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD mRNA and protein, as determined by RT-PCR and Western Analysis, respectively. Both MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD activities were also increased. Pretreatment of HCAECs with trolox and vitamin E decreased superoxide anion generation (p <.05 vs. epinephrine alone) and blocked the subsequent upregulation of SOD mRNA and protein. Treatment of cells with the beta-blocker atenolol also blocked the upregulation of SOD (p <.05 vs. epinephrine alone). These observations suggest that epinephrine via beta(1)-adrenoceptor activation causes superoxide anion generation, and the superoxide subsequently upregulates the endogenous antioxidant species SOD. These observations may be the basis of long-term benefits of exercise.", 
    "25": "Carvedilol, a non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, has been shown to possess a high degree of cardioprotection in experimental models of myocardial damage. Reactive oxygen species have been proposed to be implicated in such situations, and antioxidants have been demonstrated to provide partial protection to the reported damage. The purpose of our study was to investigate the antioxidant effect of carvedilol and its metabolite BM-910228 by measuring the extent of lipid peroxidation in a model of severe oxidative damage induced by ADP/FeSO(4) in isolated rat heart mitochondria. Carvedilol and BM-910228 inhibited the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance formation and oxygen consumption associated with lipid peroxidation with IC(50) values of 6 and 0.22 microM, respectively. Under the same conditions, the IC(50) values of alpha-tocopheryl succinate and Trolox were 125 and 31 microM, respectively. As expected, the presence of carvedilol and BM-910228 preserved the structural and functional integrity of mitochondria under oxidative stress conditions for the same concentration range shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation, since they prevented the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi) induced by ADP/FeSO(4) in respiring mitochondria. It should be stressed that neither carvedilol nor BM-910228 induced any toxic effect on mitochondrial function in the concentration range of the compounds that inhibits the peroxidation of mitochondrial membranes. In conclusion, the antioxidant properties of carvedilol may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of the compound, namely through the preservation of mitochondrial functions whose importance in myocardial dysfunction is clearly documented. Additionally, its hydroxylated analog BM-910220, with its notably superior antioxidant activity, may significantly contribute to the therapeutic effects of carvedilol.", 
    "26": "We conducted a study of the daily cost of various ophthalmic solutions used in Japan for treating glaucoma: beta-adrenergic blockers (11 products), epinephrine (3), cholinergics (3), prostaglandins (2), and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (2).", 
    "27": "The total number of drops in one bottle of each solution was counted drop by drop. The cost per drop was calculated by dividing the government-controlled standard prices by the total number of drops in one bottle. The daily cost of therapy was calculated by multiplying the cost per drop by the number of drops typically used per day.", 
    "28": "The average cost of each preparation was calculated based on the prices and the daily usage. The daily cost of the beta-adrenergic blockers studied ranged widely, from $0.43 to $1.04.", 
    "29": "These data may be useful in selecting ophthalmic products for glaucoma therapy in Japan.", 
    "30": "We determined the existence and role of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor in cultured BAECs through the effect of a beta-blocker having NO releasing action; 3,4-dihydro-8(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino)-propoxy-3-nitroxy-2H-1-benzopyran; nipradilol on eNOS and eNOS regulatory protein caveolin-1. beta(2) receptor exists in BAECs. eNOS mRNA and protein were up-regulated by its treatment whereas those of caveolin were not altered considerably. This eNOS up-regulatory action was abolished by beta(2) receptor antagonist, ICI-118551. Increase of NO metabolites, protein and mRNA of eNOS was also partially inhibited by co-treatment of NOS inhibitor, L-NA with nipradilol. This is the first investigation of the action of non-selective beta blocker on eNOS through beta(2) receptor. The drug increases NO on incubation with BAECs about 50% as a NO donor and about 50% as results of eNOS up-regulation.", 
    "31": "1. Airway smooth muscle (ASM) is a potential source of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines during airway inflammation. beta-Adrenoceptor agonist hyporesponsiveness is a characteristic feature of asthma, and interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha are implicated in its cause. Here, the capacity of beta-adrenoceptor agonists to prevent release of GM-CSF, RANTES, eotaxin and IL-8, elicited by IL-1 beta or TNF alpha, was examined in human ASM cells. 2. Isoprenaline (approximately EC(50) 150 nM), a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, and salbutamol ( approximately EC(50) 25 nM), a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, attenuated release of GM-CSF, RANTES and eotaxin, but not IL-8 (EC(50) >1 microM). The maximum extent of attenuation was RANTES > or = eotaxin > GM-CSF > IL-8, and was prevented by either propranolol (1 microM), a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, or ICI 118511 (IC(50) 15 nM), a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist. 3. The cyclic AMP-elevating agents, dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( approximately EC(50) 135 microM), forskolin ( approximately EC(50) 530 nM) and cholera toxin ( approximately EC(50) 575 pg ml(-1)) abolished IL-1 beta-induced release of GM-CSF, RANTES and eotaxin, but not IL-8. 4. IL-1 beta (1 ng ml(-1)) attenuated early increases (up to 1 h) in cyclic AMP formation induced by salbutamol (1 microM), but not by forskolin (10 microM). The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (1 microM) prevented later increases (3 - 12 h) in IL-1 beta-stimulated cyclic AMP content, but did not prevent the attenuation by salbutamol of IL-1 beta-induced cytokine release. 5. We conclude in human ASM cells that activation of beta(2)-adrenoceptors and generation of cyclic AMP is negatively-linked to the release, elicited by IL-1 beta or TNF alpha, of eosinophil-activating cytokines such as GM-CSF, RANTES and eotaxin, but not IL-8.", 
    "32": "1. This study examines beta(1)-, beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor (AR)-mediated responses, mRNA levels and radioligand binding in ileum from beta(3)-AR knock-out (-/-) (KO) and wild type (+/+) (FVB) mice. 2. In KO and FVB mice, SR59230A (100 nM) (beta(3)-AR antagonist) antagonized responses to (-)-isoprenaline in both KO and FVB mice. (-)-Isoprenaline mediated relaxation of ileum was antagonized weakly by ICI118551 (100 nM) (beta(2)-AR antagonist). Responses to (-)-isoprenaline were more strongly antagonized by CGP20712A (100 nM) (beta(1)-AR antagonist), propranolol (1 microM) (beta(1)-/beta(2)-AR antagonist), carvedilol (100 nM) (non-specific beta-AR antagonist), and CGP12177A (100 nM) (beta(1)-/beta(2)-AR antagonist) in ileum from KO than in FVB mice. 3. Responses to CL316243 (beta(3)-AR agonist) in ileum from FVB mice were antagonized by SR59230A (100 nM) but not by propranolol (1 microM) or carvedilol (100 nM). CL316243 was ineffective in relaxing ileum from KO mice. 4. CGP12177A had no agonist actions in ileum from either KO or FVB mice. 5. beta(1)-AR mRNA levels were increased 3 fold in ileum from KO compared to FVB mice. This was associated with an increased maximum number of beta(1)-/beta(2)-AR binding sites (B(max)). beta(2)-AR mRNA levels were unaffected while no beta(3)-AR mRNA was detected in KO mice. 6. In mouse ileum, beta(3)-ARs and to a lesser extent beta(1)-ARs are the predominant adrenoceptor subtypes mediating relaxation in ileum from FVB mice. In KO mice beta(1)-ARs functionally compensate for the lack of beta(3)-ARs, and this is associated with increased beta(1)-AR mRNA and levels of binding.", 
    "33": "1. Adult ventricular cardiomyocytes show an unusual structure-function relationship for cyclic AMP-dependent effects of PTHrP. We investigated whether PTHrP(1 - 16), void of biological activity on classical PTHrP target cells, is able to mimic the positive contractile effect of PTHrP(1 - 34), a fully biological agonist on cardiomyocytes. 2. Adult ventricular cardiomyocytes were paced at a constant frequency of 0.5 Hz and cell contraction was monitored using a cell-edge-detection system. Twitch amplitudes, expressed as per cent cell shortening of the diastolic cell length, and rate constants for maximal contraction and relaxation velocity were analysed. 3. PTHrP(1 - 16) (1 micromol l(-1)) mimicked the contractile effects of PTHrP(1 - 34) (1 micromol l(-1)). It increased the twitch amplitude from 5.33+/-0.72 to 8.95+/-1.10 (% dl l(-1)) without changing the kinetic of contraction. 4. PTH(1 - 34) (10 micromol l(-1)) affected the positive contractile effect of PTHrP(1 - 34), but not that of PTHrP(1 - 16). 5. RpcAMPS (10 micromol l(-1)) inhibited the positive contractile effect of PTHrP(1 - 34), but not that of PTHrP(1 - 16). 6. The positive contractile effect of PTHrP(1 - 16) was antagonized by the ET(A) receptor antagonist BQ123. 7. Sarafotoxin 6b and PTHrP(1 - 16), but not PTHrP(1 - 34), replaced (3)H-BQ123 from cardiac binding sites. 8. We conclude that N-terminal PTHrP peptides void of a PTH/PTHrP-receptor binding domain are able to bind to, and activate cardiac ET(A) receptors.", 
    "34": "We compared esmolol and remifentanil infusions with respect to their effect on intraoperative hemodynamic stability and early recovery after outpatient laparoscopic surgery when administered as IV adjuvants during desflurane anesthesia. After premedication with midazolam 2 mg IV, anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg. kg(-1) IV in combination with either esmolol 1 mg. kg(-1) IV (n = 27) or remifentanil 1 microg. kg(-1) IV (n = 26) and succinylcholine 1 mg. kg(-1) IV according to a randomized, double-blinded protocol. Anesthesia was initially maintained with desflurane 2.5% (subsequently titrated to maintain an electroencephalogram-bispectral index value of 60) and nitrous oxide 65% in oxygen. Before skin incision, an infusion of either esmolol (5 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)) or remifentanil (0.05 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)) was started and titrated to maintain the heart rate within 25% of the baseline value. Mivacurium, 0.04 mg/kg IV, bolus doses were administered to maintain a stable peak inspiratory pressure. Esmolol (12.8 +/- 13.1 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)) and remifentanil (0.04 +/- 0.02 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)) infusions were equally effective in maintaining a stable heart rate during these laparoscopic procedures. Although the mivacurium requirement was larger in the Esmolol group (7 +/- 5 vs 3 +/- 4 mg), the Esmolol group reported a smaller incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (4% vs 35%). Both drugs were associated with frequent \"postanesthesia care unit bypass\" rates (78-81%), short times to \"home readiness\" (119-120 min), excellent patient satisfaction (81-85%), and rapid resumption of normal activities (2.6-3.2 d). Fast-tracked patients were ready for discharge home significantly earlier (112 +/- 46 vs 151 +/- 50 min). We concluded that esmolol infusion is an acceptable alternative to remifentanil infusion for maintaining hemodynamic stability during desflurane-based fast-track anesthesia for outpatient gynecologic laparoscopic surgery.", 
    "35": "In the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial (1985-1990), active treatment reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events, but not that of dementia and disability, as compared with placebo. This study aims to evaluate if assessment of cognitive and functional outcomes was biased by differential dropout. Characteristics of subjects who did or did not participate in follow-up cognitive and functional evaluations were compared. The relative risks of incident cognitive impairment and disability were assessed in the two treatment groups, with the use of the reported findings and under the assumption that the proportions of cognitive and functional impairment among dropouts increased. Assignment to the placebo group and the occurrence of cardiovascular events independently predicted missed assessments. From the reported findings, the risk of cognitive and functional impairment was similar between the two treatment groups. However, when 20-30% and 40-80% of the subjects who missed the assessment were assumed to be cognitively and, respectively, functionally impaired, assignment to active treatment reduced the risk of these outcomes. In the SHEP, the cognitive and functional evaluations were biased toward the null effect by differential dropout. This might have obscured the appraisal of a protective effect of treatment on the cognitive and functional decline of older hypertensive adults.", 
    "36": "The present study evaluated the possible changes in the autonomic control of heart rate in the hypertensive model induced by the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase. Rats were treated with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME group) in the drinking water during 7 days, whereas control groups were treated with tap water (control group) or with the N(G)-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester (D-NAME group), an inactive isomer of the L-NAME molecule. The L-NAME group developed hypertension and tachycardia. The sequential blockade of the autonomic influences with propranolol and methylatropine indicated that the intrinsic heart rate did not differ among groups and revealed a sympathetic overactivity in the control of heart rate in the L-NAME group. The spectral density power of heart rate, calculated using fast-Fourier transformation, indicated a reduced variability in the low-frequency band (0.20-0.60 Hz) for the L-NAME group. The baroreflex sensitivity was also attenuated in these animals when compared with the normotensive control or D-NAME group. Overall, these data indicate cardiac sympathetic overactivity associated with a decreased baroreflex sensitivity in L-NAME hypertensive rats.", 
    "37": "We examined the relative contributions from nitric oxide (NO) and catecholaminergic pathways in promoting cerebral arteriolar dilation during hypoglycemia (plasma glucose congruent with 1.4 mM). To that end, we monitored the effects of beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) blockade with propranolol (Pro, 1.5 mg/kg iv), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibition with 7-nitroindazole (7-NI, 40 mg/kg ip) or ARR-17477 (300 microM, via topical application), or combined intravenous Pro + 7-NI or ARR-17477 on pial arteriolar diameter changes in anesthetized rats subjected to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Additional experiments, employing topically applied TTX (1 microM), addressed the possibility that the pial arteriolar response to hypoglycemia required neuronal transmission. Separately, Pro and 7-NI elicited modest but statistically insignificant 10-20% reductions in the normal ~40% increase in arteriolar diameter accompanying hypoglycemia. However, combined Pro-7-NI was accompanied by a >80% reduction in the hypoglycemia-induced dilation. On the other hand, the combination of intravenous Pro and topical ARR-17477 did not affect the hypoglycemia response. In the presence of TTX, the pial arteriolar response to hypoglycemia was lost completely. These results suggest that 1) beta-ARs and nNOS-derived NO interact in contributing to hypoglycemia-induced pial arteriolar dilation; 2) the interaction does not occur in the vicinity of the arteriole; and 3) the vasodilating signal is transmitted via a neuronal pathway.",

    "45": "The properties of non-selective cation channels were studied in rabbit portal vein smooth muscle cells in K+-free conditions with patch pipette techniques. In about 45 % of isolated outside-out patches spontaneous channel currents with a unitary conductance of 23 pS were observed. The reversal potential was +11 mV which was shifted to more negative values and the unitary conductance was reduced when part of the external Na+ was replaced by Tris. At negative potentials the probability of opening (Po) was low and the open time distributions were described by two exponentials with time constants of about 1 and 7 ms. At positive potentials Po and the longer mean open time were greatly increased. The channel exhibited bursting behaviour and the burst duration distributions were described by two exponentials with time constants of about 3 and 15 ms. At positive potentials the longer burst duration was increased substantially. Application of noradrenaline and the diacylglycerol analogue 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) to the external membrane of quiescent patches evoked single-channel activity with a unitary conductance of about 23 pS and with similar kinetic behaviour to that of the spontaneous channel currents. In conclusion, noradrenaline and OAG activate non-selective cation channel currents in excised patches of rabbit portal vein myocytes with a unitary conductance and kinetic properties that are similar to those of spontaneous channel currents. These channels have two open states and exhibit bursting behaviour. It is suggested that these channels underlie the whole-cell currents evoked by noradrenaline and OAG.", 
    "46": "Interactions between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the adrenergic system are complex and have mainly been attributed to angiotensin II, with knowledge about aldosterone action much less advanced. Only recently has evidence been forthcoming that aldosterone blunts the baroreceptor reflex and lowers heart rate variability in humans. Both effects point to an adrenergic-like action of aldosterone. It has been proposed that this blunting of baroreceptor sensitivity is mediated nongenomically and that nongenomic aldosterone action itself is modulated by the adrenergic system. The aim of the present study was to prove the hypothesis of an interaction between the autonomic nervous system and rapid, nongenomic aldosterone effects. We conducted a randomized, double blind, 8-fold cross-over trial on 18 healthy male volunteers. After pretreatment with the beta-blocking agent esmolol, the beta-agonist dobutamine, the alpha(1)-agonist phenylephrine, or placebo, placebo (0.9% NaCl) or aldosterone (0.5 mg) was injected. After aldosterone injection the peak plasma levels were supraphysiological, reaching nanomolar concentrations. Primary target variables were differences in changes in mean arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and cardiac output depending on the pretreatment. Cardiovascular parameters were measured by impedance cardiography during the maintained infusion of the adrenergic modulators for 45 min. Comparing pretreatments, diverse acute, and thus nongenomic, effects of aldosterone on mean arterial blood pressure were observed. After esmolol pretreatment, aldosterone caused an increase in mean arterial blood pressure by 4.1%, whereas after dobutamine pretreatment mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 1.6%, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). These effects were significant (P < 0.005) for the first 12 min, underlining their nongenomic nature. Our data support the hypothesis that aldosterone, via nongenomic mechanisms, has diverse effects on the cardiovascular system that depend on the preexisting adrenergic state. Furthermore, aldosterone blunts the blood pressure-lowering effect of the beta-blocking agent esmolol by a nongenomic mechanism.",

    "54": "Amphetamine (AMPH)-like stimulants represent an intensively studied class of psychoactive drugs. Despite the well-known and potent arousal-enhancing effects of these drugs, the neurobiological substrates of AMPH-induced arousal have rarely been examined explicitly. Activity of the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system is causally and positively related to behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) indices of arousal. For example, activation of locus coeruleus neurons or stimulation of medial basal forebrain noradrenergic beta-receptors elicits activation of forebrain EEG in the anesthetized rat. Further, stimulation of noradrenergic beta-receptors within the medial basal forebrain elicits a substantial increase in alert, active waking. These and other observations suggest that at least some of the arousal-enhancing actions of AMPH-like stimulants derive from AMPH-induced increases in noradrenergic neurotransmission at beta-receptors. The current study examines the extent to which AMPH-induced activation of cortical EEG is dependent on actions of central beta-receptors.",

Sixty-two consecutive patients (31 with exfoliation glaucoma and 31 with primary open angle glaucoma) chronically treated with timolol maleate twice daily were included in this trial. Patients then had added dorzolamide 2% twice daily (08:00 and 20:00), instilled approximately 10 min after timolol maleate.

    "62": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are now standard treatment for mild to moderate chronic heart failure (CHF). However, although many subjects improve on beta blockade, others do not, and some may even deteriorate. Even when subjects improve on beta blockade, they may subsequently decompensate and need acute treatment with a positive inotropic agent. In the presence of full beta blockade, a beta agonist such as dobutamine may have to be administered at very high (> 10 micrograms/kg/min) doses to increase cardiac output, and these doses may increase afterload. In contrast, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) such as milrinone or enoximone retain their full hemodynamic effects in the face of beta blockade. This is because the site of PDEI action is beyond the beta-adrenergic receptor, and because beta blockade reverses receptor pathway desensitization changes, which are detrimental to PDEI response. Moreover, when the combination of a PDEI and a beta-blocking agent is administered long term in CHF, their respective efficacies are additive and their adverse effects subtractive. The PDEI is administered first to increase the tolerability of beta-blocker initiation by counteracting the myocardial depressant effect of adrenergic withdrawal. With this combination, the signature effects of beta blockade (a substantial decrease in heart rate and an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction) are observed, the hemodynamic support conferred by the PDEI appears to be sustained, and clinical results are promising. However, large-scale placebo-controlled studies with PDEIs and beta blockers are needed to confirm these results.",

However, there are no studies describing the effects of propranolol on the QT dispersion in this population. The objective of this study was to assess the electrophysiological profile, mainly QT dispersion, of patients with heart failure regularly using propranolol. METHODS - Fifteen patients with heart failure and using propranolol were assessed over a period of 12 months. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded prior to the onset of beta-blocker therapy and after 3 months of drug use. RESULTS - A significant reduction in heart rate, in QT dispersion and in QTc dispersion was observed, as was also an increase in the PR interval and in the QT interval, after the use of propranolol in an average dosage of 100 mg/day. CONCLUSION - Reduction in QT dispersion in patients with heart failure using propranolol may explain the reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death with beta-blocker therapy, in this specific group of patients.",

    "76": "1. Oxidative mechanisms have been implicated in neonatal cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We and others have shown that a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor preserves endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity and inhibits cardiac hypertrophy in vivo. We therefore have examined whether noradrenaline (NA) induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during its induction of neonatal cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and whether simvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, attenuates ROS production and thus NA-induced hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes. 2. NA increased the intracellular ROS levels in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase of ROS was significantly inhibited by simvastatin and catalase. Prazosin partially suppressed NA-induced increase of ROS and beating, while preincubation with both prazosin and propranolol completely abolished NA-evoked increase of ROS and beating. Simvastatin did not affect NA-induced increase of beating. 3. The NA-induced increase of protein content was partially suppressed by prazosin and completely abolished by preincubation with both prazosin and propranolol. Simvastatin inhibited the increase of NA-induced increase of RNA content and [(3)H]-leucine incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner. Mevalonic acid (MVA) reversed the inhibition of NA-induced RNA and protein increase by simvastatin. Catalase also inhibited the NA-induced increase of RNA and protein. 4. We conclude that the inhibitory effects of simvastatin on myocyte hypertrophy were associated with its antioxidant effects and inhibition of MVA-metabolism pathway in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. NA-induced increases of intracellular ROS and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy requires both alpha and beta adrenoceptors activation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The increases of ROS induced by NA is required for hypertrophy.", 
    "77": "1. We examined the effects of several E-ring and F-ring isoprostanes on mechanical activity in pulmonary artery and vein. 2. 8-iso PGE(2) and 8-iso PGF(2 alpha) were powerful spasmogens in human vasculature and in canine pulmonary vein. 8-iso PGE(1) and 8-iso PGF(2 beta) also exhibited moderate spasmogenic activity in canine pulmonary vein; 8-iso PGF(1 alpha), 8-iso PGF(1beta), and 8-iso PGF(3 alpha) were generally ineffective. Canine pulmonary arteries did not exhibit excitatory responses to any of the isoprostanes. 3. The spasmogenic effects of 8-iso PGE(2) were markedly attenuated by the TP-receptor blocker ICI 192605 and by the EP-receptor blocker AH 6809 (-log K(B)=8.4 and 5.7, respectively). PGE(2) was a very weak agonist ( approximately 100 fold less so than 8-iso PGE(2)). 4. In the presence of ICI 192605 (10(-6) M), 8-iso PGE(1) evoked modest dose-dependent relaxations in human and canine pulmonary vein, and in canine pulmonary artery, but not in the human pulmonary artery. The other isoprostanes were generally ineffective as vasodilators in the pulmonary vasculature of both species. 5. The spasmogenic effects of 8-iso PGE(2) and 8-iso PGF(2 alpha) did not involve elevation of [Ca(2+)](i). 6. 8-iso PGE(2)-evoked contractions were blocked by inhibitors of tyrosine kinase (genistein) and Rho kinase (Y 27632 and HA 1077), but not by inhibitors of protein kinase C (calphostin C or chelerythrine), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (PD 98059) or p38-kinase (SB 203580). 7. The actions of 8-isoprostanes in the lungs are compound-, species- and tissue-dependent. Several isoprostanes evoke vasoconstriction: in the case of 8-iso PGE(2), this involves activation of TP-receptors, tyrosine kinases and Rho kinases. 8-iso PGE(1) is also able to cause vasodilation.",

Among them indirect chiral HPLC method using GITC gave the best result. The derivatization proceeded quantitatively within 20 min at room temperature. Separation of the enantiomers as diastereomers was achieved by reversed-phase HPLC within 20min using ODS column. Different ratios of (S)-(-)-bevantolol and (R)-(+)-bevantolol were prepared. Enantiomeric separation of these mixtures took place on a chiralcel OD column or, after derivatization with GITC, on a ODS column. No racemization was found during the experiment. This method allowed determination of 0.05% of either enantiomer in the presence of its stereoisomer and method validation showed adequete linearity over the required range.",

He was successfully treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. His electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns changed intermittently. Alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation and beta-adrenoceptor blockade augmented the characteristic ST-segment elevation, whereas alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation mitigated the ST-segment elevation. Intravenous procainamide administration did not aggravate ST-segment elevation when ECG had shown coved ST elevation in the right precordial leads. Molecular study did not reveal the same mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A) as previously reported in Brugada syndrome. This case demonstrates the genetic heterogeneity of SCN5A in Brugada syndrome.", 
    "80": "To compare the effects of class Ic and III antiarrhythmic agents on the termination and prevention of atrial fibrillation, the present study investigated the use-dependent electrophysiological effects of flecainide, nifekalant and d,l-sotalol on the human atrium. Flecainide significantly prolonged effective refractory period (ERP), intra-atrial conduction time (IACT) and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD), and its effects on ERP and IACT were use-dependent. Nifekalalant significantly prolonged ERP and MAPD, and these effects were reverse use-dependent; however, there was no significant change in IACT. d,l-Sotalol significantly prolonged MAPD and the effect was reverse use-dependent. It significantly prolonged ERP, but the effect was not reverse use-dependent. d,l-Sotalol increased IACT in a use-dependent manner. Thus, for atrial fibrillation, class Ic antiarrhythmic agents might be more effective in termination and class III antiarrhythmic agents might be more effective in prevention.",

    "83": "Nitrosation of propranolol under standard conditions recommended by the World Health Organization (10mM propranolol hydrochloridre, 40mM sodium nitrite, pH 3.5) was performed in the absence and in the presence of benzoic acid and of twelve mono-, di- and tri-hydroxybenzoic acids, added to the nitrosation mixture in concentrations ranging from 2 to 40mM, in order to examine their effect on the nitrosation reaction. The yield of N-nitrosopropranol (NOP) was reduced by benzoic acid and, with potency decreasing in the following order, by 2,3,4-tri-hydroxybenzoic acid>/=3,4-tri-hydroxybenzoic acid>2,5-di-hydroxybenzoic acid>2,3-di-hydroxybenzoic acid>3-hydroxybenzoic acid>2-hydroxybenzoic acid>3,4,5-tri-hydroxybenzoic acid>4-hydroxybenzoic acid; their inhibiting effect was concentration-dependent. In contrast, 2,4-di-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,6-di-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2,4,6-tri-hydroxybenzoic acid caused an increase in the yield of NOP that was inversely related to their concentration. 3,5-Di-hydroxybenzoic acid was substantially inactive. These findings indicate that, depending on the positions of carboxyl group and hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring, mono-, di- and tri-hydroxybenzoic acids may inhibit or hasten nitrosation reactions. As compared with benzenediols and benzenetriols [Mutat.

Therefore, the concentration- and frequency-dependent effects of EGIS-7229, and of the I(Kr) blockers d,l-sotalol and dofetilide, on the effective refractory period (ERP) were measured in isolated right ventricular papillary muscle of the rabbit in vitro. The effects of these drugs on right ventricular fibrillation threshold (RVFT) at increasing intravenous doses were also determined in anesthetized cats. Dofetilide and d,l-sotalol increased ERP in a concentration-dependent manner (dofetilide: 3-100 nM; d,l-sotalol: 3-100 microM) with strong reverse frequency dependence at high concentrations. EGIS-7229 concentration dependently lengthened ERP at 1-30 microM. Its effect on ERP was clearly reverse frequency dependent at 3 microM, but this feature of the drug diminished at 10 microM and was not apparent at 30 microM. The effect of EGIS-7229 (30 microM) on ERP was devoid of reverse frequency dependence as it was more effective (31%) than dofetilide (16 %) at high-pacing rate (3 Hz), whereas it was less effective (50%) than dofetilide (70%) at slow-pacing rate (1 Hz). Reverse frequency-dependent ERP effect of dofetilide (100 nM) was similarly abolished by the addition of lidocaine (30 microM). EGIS-7229 (1-8 mg/kg iv), d,l-sotalol (1-8 mg/kg iv), and dofetilide (10-80 microg/kg iv) caused a dose-dependent increase in RVFT. The minimum effective dose of d,l-sotalol and EGIS-7229 was 1 and 2 mg/kg, respectively, whereas that of dofetilide was 10 microg/kg. EGIS-7229 induced a smaller peak effect in RVFT than sotalol or dofetilide. In conclusion, EGIS-7229 markedly increased refractoriness to electrical stimulation in vitro and in vivo. Compared with pure I(Kr) blockers, the benefits of EGIS-7229 seem to be a greater lengthening of effective refractory period at rapid stimulation rates, suggesting a strong antiarrhythmic action, and a smaller effect at slow stimulation rates, suggesting low potential to induce early afterdepolarizations.", 
    "85": "Animal and human studies have shown that carvedilol has significant antioxidant properties compared with other beta-blockers. The objective of this study was to determine if these antioxidant effects are detectable in patients with heart failure and to compare carvedilol with the selective beta-blocker metoprolol. Twenty-four patients with chronic heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either carvedilol or metoprolol in a double-blind control trial for 12 weeks in a University teaching hospital clinic. Blood pressure, heart rate, exercise tolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction, plasma total antioxidant status, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities were determined at baseline and every 4 weeks up to 12 weeks. The results showed that erythrocyte superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were significantly reduced in carvedilol treated patients after 12 weeks of therapy, whereas metoprolol had no significant effect, although the clinical improvement over the short-term was similar with both drugs. Thus carvedilol, in addition to improving symptoms in heart failure, also possesses significant antioxidant properties. Whether this additional action influences long-term outcome is at present unknown.", 
    "86": "To determine contribution of the autonomic nervous system to cardiovascular reactivity to noise, acoustic startle stimulus (110 dB, 1-20 kHz, 0.150 s) was administered to 35 subjects (19 women, 16 men) with mild essential hypertension. Among these patients, 10 were unmedicated and 25 were receiving long-term monotherapy (10 were taking 100 mg atenolol, 5 were taking 10 mg prazosin, and 10 were taking 50 mg losartan daily). Polygraphic recordings were obtained in supine position. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) levels were stable until the noise was administered. In the unmedicated group BP and HR were elevated during the first 10 s. BP returned to resting levels after this period. The calculated hemodynamic indexes showed a biphasic change in total peripheral resistance (TPR), with an overall vasoconstriction associated with the BP rise phase, preceding a delayed vasodilation. The lowest HR changes were observed in the beta-blocker group with increases of 6 beats/min and 3 beats/min after the first and second noise stimulations, compared with 10 beats/min and 5 beats/min in the unmedicated group. Prazosin significantly reduced the BP rises to 7 mm Hg and 6 mm Hg for systolic BP and diastolic BP after the first stimulation compared with 22 mm Hg and 17 mm Hg in the untreated group (p < 0.01). The second stimulation after prazosin determined -5 mm Hg and 1 mm Hg changes for systolic BP and diastolic BP respectively, compared to rises of 13 mmHg for systolic BP and 10 mmHg for diastolic BP in the untreated group (p < 0.01). The hemodynamic percentage changes resulting from the first stimulation indicated prazosin markedly reduced the noise-induced rise in TPR (p < 0.05). No effect of beta-blocker was detectable using percentage changes. The rises in BP were amplified in the losartan-treated subjects compared with the other groups. Because of a low resting TPR in this group, the percentage changes in TPR resulting from noise were amplified in the subjects treated with the AT1 receptor antagonist. In conclusion the acoustic startle stimulus appeared as a simple and reliable procedure for inducing transient increases due to a rise in TPR. Cardiovascular responses differed according to the antihypertensive monotherapy, with a limited effect of noise in the prazosin-treated group.",

The mean BPs measured over 24 h using ABPM were 143/82 mmHg, 140/82 mmHg and 158/93 mmHg for the free, fixed and placebo treatment arms, respectively. The trough-to-peak ratios (T:P) were 75% and 79% for the systolic BP and 70% and 70% for the diastolic BP for the free and fixed combinations, respectively. Pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed identical plasma concentration-time curves for felodipine given as the free or fixed combination. Comparison of the plasma concentration-time curves for metoprolol revealed a delay in the release rate from the fixed combination formulation. No significant differences in BP control between the active treatments were noted during this period. Of 26 patients entered into the study, 3 withdrew during active phase for non-drug-related reasons. No patient withdrew from active treatment due to treatment-related adverse events. The frequency of adverse event reporting for the fixed combination of felodipine and metoprolol was similar to that for placebo (60% and 58%, respectively).",

Recent studies have identified human airway smooth muscle (HASM) as a rich source of eotaxin, but the factors regulating its production are poorly understood. Here we describe for the first time that beta2-agonists can inhibit cytokine-induced eotaxin release. We found that TNF-alpha stimulated eotaxin release (assayed by ELISA) from HASM cells and that the release was partially inhibited by salbutamol and salmeterol. The effect of beta2-agonists was mimicked by forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP and potentiated by the cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram, suggesting that it is cAMP dependent. We also found that the cAMP inhibition was likely at the transcription stage, although experiments with the PKA inhibitors H-89 and Rp-cAMP or the PKG inhibitor KT5823 suggested that none of these kinases was involved. Partial inhibition of eotaxin release was also seen with the corticosteroids dexamethasone and fluticasone. The combined use of beta2-agonists, rolipram, and steroids abolished TNF-alpha-induced eotaxin release. These results suggest that the combination of a beta2-agonist, PDE inhibitor, and a corticosteroid may have additive beneficial effects in the treatment of the eosinophilia associated with asthma and other allergic diseases.",

Adenylate cyclase activity stimulated with isoproterenol and 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate was markedly reduced in septic myocardium. The contractile and adenylate cyclase responses to colforsin daropate, a direct adenylate cyclase activator, were unaffected by sepsis. Radioligand binding experiments with (-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol revealed no significant alteration in myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density or affinity in sepsis. Determination of cardiac G(s alpha) level by Western blotting showed a reduction of approximately 50% in sepsis.

Recent advances in the understanding and treatment of cardiovascular disease in diabetes have made it increasingly important to tailor therapy when treating this high-risk population. Because patients with diabetes are at significantly higher risk for complications and death from MI, these patients are most likely to benefit from early and aggressive therapeutic intervention. Strong recommendations can be given for the use of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and thrombolysis when indicated in the management of acute MI in the diabetic patient. Acetylsalicylic acid is also likely to be beneficial with little risk of adverse events in this setting. In the absence of more definitive data, cautious use of mechanical intervention in diabetic patients is recommended. The use of intravenous insulin therapy may benefit diabetic patients during the acute phase of MI, but more definitive studies are required before it can be recommended for broad use.",

    "115": "Nebivolol (CAS 99200-09-6) is a novel beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist which possesses vasodilating properties and lowers systemic vascular resistance in dogs and humans, presumably by a nitric oxide-related mechanism. In the present study, clearance techniques were applied to anaesthetized male Sprague Dawley rats, and the effects of nebivolol on renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow), on urinary excretion of sodium, chloride and potassium, on renal NO-excretion, and on plasma renin activity were studied. Nebivolol doses ranging from 0.1 to 2 mg/kg i.v. were tested. The results revealed that nebivolol dose-dependently increased glomerular filtration rate, urine flow and urinary excretion of sodium and chloride. Potassium excretion was only inconsistently increased and showed no dose dependency. At a dose of 1 mg/kg, the drug also significantly increased renal plasma flow measured as 3H-PAH (p-aminohippurate) clearance. The effect of nebivolol on the glomerular filtration rate could be abolished by L-NMMA (N6-monomethyl-L-arginine) (1 mg/kg), a non-selective inhibitor of NO-synthase and by iminoethyllysine (1 mg/kg), a relatively selective inhibitor of the inducible NO-synthase, but not by 7-nitroindazole (1 mg/kg), a relatively selective inhibitor of the neuronal NO-synthase isoform. The saluretic effect of nebivolol was diminished by all of the three NO-synthase inhibitors, but could not be completely reversed. At a dose of 2 mg/kg, nebivolol increased renal NO-excretion by 70.7%. This effect could be completely abolished by L-NMMA (1 mg/kg). Plasma renin activity was lowered by nebivolol (2 mg/kg) from 14.6 +/- 1.49 to 6.5 +/- 1.66 ng angiotensin I/ml/h (p < 0.01). The results demonstrate that, in anaesthetized rats, nebivolol exerts significant renal vasodilating effects and increases urinary excretion of fluid and solutes. The actions of nebivolol on renal hemodynamics are assumed to be mediated by a stimulation of the NO-synthase, probably the inducible isoform. Since none of the NO-synthase inhibitors could completely abolish the saluretic effect of nebivolol, an additional mechanism, not related to NO, may be involved in the tubular action of this drug.",

    "120": "There is strong evidence that reduced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity is involved in the etiology of obesity in several animal models of obesity. In humans the situation is more complex but humans with low SNS activity, reduced beta-adrenergic sensitivity, reduced lipid mobilizing efficacy of catecholamines have lowered energy expenditure and are at greater risk of obesity. The SNS with its effect on food intake, lipid mobilization and energy expenditure has a major potential as a target for novel pharmacotherapies in weight reducing strategies. Extended cellular and molecular knowledge about the nature, the distribution and the role of the adrenergic receptors (beta(1)-, beta(2)-, beta(3)-, alpha(2)- and alpha(1)-) existing in tissue effectors involved in the control of lipid mobilization (adipose tissue) and energy expenditure (brown adipose tissue, skeletal muscle) has opened new pathways for pharmacological strategies. In this manuscript, after a summary of current knowledge on the regulation of lipid mobilization and energy expenditure in humans, we briefly review the putative targets and the most recent attempts to develop agents acting at various adrenergic receptor types in SNS effectors or on SNS activity. These include major questions about putative utilization of beta(3)-agonists, alpha(2)-antagonists and beta-antagonists in pharmacotherapy and/or prevention of obesity in humans.", 
    "121": "In the present study, we have examined the insulin-signaling pathways involved in myogenesis in mouse C2C12 skeletal muscle cell line, a cellular system that expresses high number of high affinity insulin receptors. Insulin (50 nM) rapidly (5 min) stimulated beta-chain insulin receptor, activated the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt/p70S6-kinase signaling pathway, as well as phosphorylated both p44/p42- and p38-mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Preconfluent cells were differentiated in a serum-free medium in response to 50 nM insulin for 72 h, as revealed by the formation of multinucleated myotubes and the induction of the creatine kinase activity. This differentiation process was also monitored by the inhibition of the PCNA content and induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Furthermore, insulin induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) DNA binding activity and down-regulated activating protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding activity throughout the differentiation process. The use of specific inhibitors of the insulin-signaling pathways indicated that myogenesis was precluded by treatment for 72 h with LY294002 (an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase), rapamycin (a p70S6-kinase blocker), and SB203580 or PD169316 (p38-MAPK inhibitors). These inhibitors abolished insulin induction of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and kappaB-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) promoter activity, maintaining expressed cytosolic IkappaB-alpha protein, and increased AP-1 DNA binding activity and TRE-CAT promoter activity. These data suggest that insulin induces myogenesis in C2C12 through PI 3-kinase/ p70S6-kinase and p38-MAPK pathways, the signaling through p44/p42-MAPK being inhibited.",

The present studies were undertaken to compare two compounds, a vitamin D(3) analogue (CB1093) with minimal calcaemic effects, and clenbuterol, a long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, both of which induce NGF synthesis in vivo. Clenbuterol caused significant increases in both NGF mRNA and protein in 3T3 cells; with maxima at 10 nM and at 8-12 h exposure. Effects of clenbuterol on NGF mRNA were antagonized by propranolol. Mobility shift assays on whole cell extracts showed that clenbuterol increased AP1 binding in 3T3 cells prior to increasing NGF synthesis. Clenbuterol was without effect on NGF mRNA levels in L929 cells, whereas CB1093 caused significant increases in both NGF mRNA and protein levels in both 3T3 and L929 cells. Stimulation was almost maximal at 24 h exposure and was sustained for at least 72 h. The magnitude of the increase was much greater in L929 (700% increase) than in 3T3 cells (80%). Binding to the vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR), which acts as a transcription factor itself, was increased as early as 30 min after exposure to of CB1093 and maintained up to 24 h. Increased VDR binding preceded increased NGF mRNA. A 150% increase in AP-1 binding was also evident. This study demonstrates that CB1093 and clenbuterol stimulate NGF levels in vitro and that AP-1 binding could be a commonality between the mechanism of NGF induction of these two compounds.",

    "133": "Although palmitoylation of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR), as well as its phosphorylation by the cyclic AMP-dependant protein kinase (PKA) and the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK), are known to play important roles in agonist-promoted desensitization, their relative contribution and mutual regulatory influences are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role that the carboxyl tail PKA site (Ser(345,346)) of the beta(2)AR plays in its rapid agonist-promoted phosphorylation and desensitization. Mutation of this site (Ala(345,346)beta(2)AR) significantly reduced the rate and extent of the rapid desensitization promoted by sustained treatment with the agonist isoproterenol. The direct contribution of Ser(345,346) in desensitization was then studied by mutating all other putative PKA and beta ARK phosphorylation sites (Ala(261,262)beta ARK(-)beta(2)AR). We found this mutant receptor to be phosphorylated upon receptor activation but not following direct activation of PKA, suggesting a role in receptor-specific (homologous) but not heterologous phosphorylation. However, despite its phosphorylated state, Ala(261,262)beta ARK(-)beta(2)AR did not undergo rapid desensitization upon agonist treatment, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser(345,346) alone is not sufficient to promote desensitization. Taken with the observation that mutation of either Ser(345,346) or of the beta ARK phosphorylation sites prevented both the hyper-phosphorylation and constitutive desensitization of a palmitoylation-less mutant (Gly(341)beta(2)AR), our data suggest a concerted/synergistic action of the two kinases that depends on the palmitoylation state of the receptor. Consistent with this notion, in vitro phosphorylation of Gly(341)beta(2)AR by the catalytic subunit of PKA facilitated further phosphorylation of the receptor by purified beta ARK. Our study therefore allows us to propose a coordinated mechanism by which sequential depalmitoylation, and phosphorylation by PKA and beta ARK lead to the functional uncoupling and desensitization of the ss(2)AR.",

Patients (n = 60) were recruited from the Arrhythmia Clinic at the University of Hong Kong and given dextromethorphan 30 mg. The dextromethorphan and dextrorphan concentrations in urine over the next 8 hours were used to determine metabolizer status. If the metabolic ratio was greater than 0.3, the patient was determined to be a poor metabolizer. In phase 2, patients (n = 38) were given propafenone 150 mg twice daily, and at steady state, the propafenone and 5-OH propafenone plasma concentrations were determined. It was found that 15% of the patients were poor metabolizers of dextromethorphan. There was a significant correlation between the metabolic ratios of dextromethorphan/dextrorphan and propafenone/5-OH propafenone (r = 0.49, p = 0.0019) and between the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan ratio and the concentration of propafenone (r = 0.32, p = 0.05). No correlations were found in the extensive or poor metabolizer subgroups. It was concluded that the percentage of poor metabolizers in atrial fibrillation patients from Hong Kong was much larger than in previous studies of Chinese patients who were not from Hong Kong. The ability to metabolize dextromethorphan to dextrorphan is related to the ability to metabolize propafenone to 5-hydroxypropafenone.", 
    "135": "The pharmacokinetics (PK) of the antiarrhythmic sotalol, which elicits Class III and beta-blocking activity, has not been adequately defined in a pediatric population with tachyarrhythmias. The goal of this single-dose study with administration of sotalol HCl at a dose level of 30 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) was to define the PK of the drug in the following four age groups: neonates (0-30 days), infants (1 month to 2 years), younger children (> 2 to < 7 years), and older children (7-12 years) with tachyarrhythmias of either supraventricular or ventricular origin. The drug was administered in an extemporaneously compounded syrup formulation prepared from the tablets containing sotalol HCl. For safety, vital signs and adverse events were recorded and the QTc interval and heart rate telemetrically monitored. Scheduled blood samples were taken over a 36-hour time interval following dose administration. The drug concentrations in plasma were measured by a sensitive and specific LC/MS/MS assay. Standard compartment model-independent methods were applied to compute the salient PK parameters of sotalol. Twenty-four clinical sites enrolled 34 patients. Thirty-three had analyzable data. Sotalol was rapidly absorbed, with mean peak concentrations occurring 2 to 3 hours after administration. The elimination of sotalol was characterized by an average half-life of between 7.4 and 9.2 hours in the four age groups. There existed statistically significant linear relationships between apparent total clearance (CL/f) or apparent volume of distribution (V lambda z/f) after oral administration and the covariates BSA, creatinine clearance (CLcr), body weight (BW), or age. The best predictors for CL/f were CLcr and BSA, whereas BW best predicted the V lambda z/f. The total area under the drug concentration-time curve in the smallest children with a BSA < 0.33 m2 was significantly greater than that in the larger children. This finding indicated that the BSA-based dose adjustment used in this study led to a larger exposure in the smallest children, whereas the exposure to the drug was similar in the larger children. The dose of 30 mg/m2 was tolerated well. No serious drug-related adverse events were reported. It can be concluded that the PK of sotalol in the pediatric patients depended only on body size, except for the neonates and smallest infants in whom the disposition of sotalol was determined by both body size and maturation of eliminatory processes.",

Key morbidity reduction trials are briefly mentioned, and recent mortality reduction trials are reviewed. General recommendations regarding the use of beta-blockers in heart failure are also included to guide clinical practice.", 
    "137": "Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses evaluating mortality reduction with beta-blockers in the treatment of heart failure were identified using a MEDLINE search from January 1993 to March 2000. Abstracts and presented results from recent scientific meetings were also considered.", 
    "138": "Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease hospitalization for worsening heart failure, decrease the need for heart transplant, improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and increase left-ventricular ejection fraction. A mortality benefit has recently been demonstrated for patients with chronic heart failure. Carvedilol, bisoprolol, and controlled-release/extended-release metoprolol decreased the risk of dying by 65%, 34%, and 34%, respectively, in patients with primarily NYHA functional class II or III and systolic dysfunction. The benefit of these agents in patients with class IV heart failure or determining whether one agent has an advantage over another is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials.", 
    "139": "Several beta-blockers have demonstrated mortality reduction in the treatment of patients with NYHA functional class II or III heart failure and systolic dysfunction. Beta-blockers should be considered in these patients when they are clinically stable and taking the current standard therapy of a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or other vasodilator agent.", 
    "140": "Chronotropic incompetence is one cause of diminished exercise capacity in heart transplant recipients. If reinnervation occurs, it often is late after transplantation and is not always accompanied by functional improvements in peak heart rate and appropriate tachycardia during exercise. To determine the efficacy of rate-responsive pacing on peak heart rate and exercise capacity, the authors studied eight male heart transplant recipients (age 57 +/- 12 years; 23 +/- 9 months after transplantation) that had either atrial or dual-chambered pacemakers.", 
    "141": "All subjects completed two maximal graded exercise tests (GXT) using the Naughton treadmill protocol. During the first GXT, pacemakers were programmed for bradycardia support only and without rate responsiveness (unpaced). After a 14-day regimen of beta blockade with metoprolol to nullify the influence of circulating catecholamines on heart rate, subjects performed the second GXT with pacemakers programmed to respond optimally in the rate-responsive mode (paced).", 
    "142": "Peak heart rate (149 versus 129 bpm), peak oxygen uptake (18.9 versus 15.4 mL/kg/min), treadmill time to exhaustion (14.6 versus 12.4 min), and minute ventilation (76.7 versus 66.2 L/min) were significantly increased (P < or = 0.05) during the paced versus unpaced GXT.", 
    "143": "The results of this study demonstrate that chronotropic support of the transplanted heart using a rate-responsive pacemaker, with activity-based sensors programmed for maximal sensitivity, improves both peak heart rate and exercise capacity in heart transplant recipients significantly more than circulating catecholamines alone.", 
    "144": "The sympathetic nervous system and renin angiotensin agents play an important role in heart failure both as a marker of severity of disease and also as a deteriorious factor for congestive heart failure. A beta-blocker in those patients used to be contraindicated. There has been evidence that the blocking effect of alpha and beta-receptors may ameliorate symptoms and retard progression of the disease. In early studies, the usage of a beta-blocker in mild to moderate congestive heart failure could improve symptoms, increase exercise capacity, and decrease heart size. Recently large clinical randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials exhibited long-term treatment of beta-blockers, in chronic heart failure could improve cardiac function, alleviate symptoms, reduce the all-cause mortality and also risk of cardiovascular hospitalization. The appropriate dose and gradual adjustment over time with patient selection will increase benefit and decrease the adverse effects. In the future, beta-blockers may be the fourth component of the standard regimen of ACE inhibitors, diuretics and digoxin in many patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "145": "Efficacy of four primary classes of antihypertensive agents (diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, adrenergic inhibiting drugs) were compared by using a crossectional medical record survey between July 1997 and January 1998. Only hypertensive cases with initial monotherapy were studied. The evaluations were 1) blood pressure response after drug titration and 2) blood pressure response during the maintenance phase. Two hundred and eighty nine patients were studied. After dose titration, the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure with calcium antagonists (33 +/- 24 mmHg, mean +/- SD) was better than other drugs (p < 0.05) while there was no difference in the other three drug classes in systolic blood pressure reduction. The mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure with calcium antagonists (17 +/- 9 mmHg) was better than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (13 +/- 9, p = 0.02) but without significant difference compared to the other two drug classes. There was no difference in diastolic blood pressure reduction from diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and adrenergic inhibiting drugs. In the maintenance phase, the response rate for calcium antagonists (82.6%) was better than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (54.2%, p = 0.004) but was not better than the other two drug classes. Response rates for diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and adrenergic inhibiting drugs were not statistically different.", 
    "146": "The effect of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on retention in a mildly aversive passive-avoidance procedure was investigated. Rats were given passive-avoidance training--1 trial per day for 4 days-and were administered saline, the centrally and peripherally acting beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (4 or 10 mg/kg ip), or the peripherally acting beta-adrenergic blocker sotalol (4 or 10 mg/kg ip) immediately or 2 hr after the 1st trial. Enhanced retention occurred only with the higher dose (10 mg/kg) of propranolol and only when it was administered immediately after training. The enhanced retention produced by propranolol is discussed in terms of opposing, regionally specific actions of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated neural circuits on modulation of memory.", 
    "147": "The MADIT study lead to the first approved prophylactic indication for ICDs in patients with previous myocardial infarction, depressed left ventricular systolic function, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), and inducible sustained VT. However, criticisms have been raised with respect to the study design and patient selection. The MUSTT yielded similar results (51% lower mortality by ICD vs no antiarrhythmic drugs) in a comparable population. The results of MUSTT address the major criticisms of MADIT: (1) MADIT was a \"small\" study (n = 196), while MUSTT randomized 704 patients. (2) MADIT had an \"imbalance\" in its prescription of beta-blockers, whereas the \"imbalance\" favored the control group in MUSTT: (51% vs 34%). (3) MADIT had no untreated limb, but MUSTT did. (4) MADIT's control group mortality (32% at 2 years) was considered by some as \"unrealistically high\", yet MUSTT measured a similar rate (28% at 2 years). (5) MADIT presented no information relative to patients without inducible arrhythmias, but MUSTT recorded their outcomes in a registry. In conclusion, the combined results of MADIT and MUSTT confirm the appropriateness of their risk stratification schemes and the survival benefits of ICD therapy as a highly effective primary prevention in this high risk population.", 
    "148": "A Single-Center Experience. The influence, after ICD implantation, of concomitant CABG, angioplasty, and other antiischemic therapeutic interventions, like treatment with beta-blockers, on outcome and mortality of patients with VT or VF due to CAD remains uncertain. The univariate and multivariate risks of recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias requiring ICD interventions or death associated with baseline clinical and functional variables were studied in 160 consecutive patients with CAD of whom 30 underwent CABG or angioplasty at < or = 2 weeks before ICD implantation. ICD interventions occurred in 98 (61%) patients over a mean follow-up of 1,065 days. In univariate and multivariate analysis, VT as the presenting arrhythmia was the only clinical factor predictive of recurrences. Treatment with beta-blockers at hospital discharge reduced the probability of recurrences. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed the effect of beta-blockers (P < 0.005) and of VT as the presenting arrhythmia (P < 0.01). Overall mortality was 61% (29/160). In multivariate analysis a low ejection fraction (< or = 0.20) and omission of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at discharge were associated with excess mortality. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, a low ejection fraction (borderline between 0.30 and 0.21, significant < 0.21) was the single predictor of mortality. Revascularization by CABG or angioplasty had no influence on ventricular arrhythmia recurrences or survival. During long-term follow-up, VT as the presenting arrhythmia and the omission of beta-blocker therapy were associated with excess recurrences of ventricular arrhythmias after ICD implantation. In contrast, survival depended primarily on left ventricular function at discharge. Revascularization did not prevent recurrences of arrhythmias and had no significant effect on survival in the small group of patients who underwent CABG or angioplasty.", 
    "149": "The aim of this study was to determine whether a therapeutic response to Class III antiarrhythmic drugs is related to predictable changes in repolarization on the electrocardiogram (ECG). A group of 57 patients with ischemic heart disease and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) at electrophysiological study (EPS) were selected from a population enrolled in a randomized double-blind crossover study of dofetilide (500 micrograms bid) versus sotalol (160 mg bid). ECGs were analyzed blindly, and RR, QT (maximum value/12 leads), QTc (Bazett's formula), QT dispersion (QTmax-QTmin over 12 leads) and QTc dispersion, were calculated at baseline and on the third day of treatment (4 hours after dosing), when patients underwent EPS to test the effects of study drugs on VT inducibility.", 
    "150": "At EPS 21 patients were responders to dofetilide and 22 to sotalol. On day 3, a significant increase in QT and QTc and decrease in QT and QTc dispersion, compared to baseline, was measured in responders and nonresponders, with both dofetilide and sotalol. No significant difference in QTc or QT dispersion between responders and nonresponders was observed in either treatment group. In conclusion, treatment with dofetilide and sotalol was associated with an increase in QT and QTc, and a decrease in QT and QTc dispersion. In contrast with previous reports, a differential effect on QT or QTc dispersion was not observed in drug responders versus nonresponders.",

After restoration of sinus rhythm, patients were randomized to amiodarone (200 mg/day), propafenone (450 mg/day) or sotalol (320 +/- 20 mg/day). Follow-up evaluations were conducted at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months, and at 3-month intervals thereafter. The proportion of patients developing recurrent atrial fibrillation and/or experiencing unacceptable adverse effects was measured in the three groups by the Kaplan-Meier method.", 
    "153": "Recurrent atrial fibrillation occurred in 25 of the 75 patients treated with amiodarone compared to 51 of the 75 patients treated with sotalol and 24 of the 64 patients treated with propafenone. Fourteen patients treated with amiodarone, five with sotalol, and one with propafenone experienced adverse effects while in sinus rhythm, necessitating discontinuation of treatment (P < 0.001 for amiodarone and propafenone vs sotalol). The difference between amiodarone and propafenone was statistically nonsignificant when all events were included in the analysis. However, if the analysis was limited to recurrent atrial fibrillation events, amiodarone was more effective than propafenone (P < 0.05).", 
    "154": "Amiodarone and propafenone were superior to sotalol in maintaining long-term normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone tended to be superior to propafenone, though its long-term efficacy was limited by adverse side effects.", 
    "155": "The secretion of PYY by endocrine L cells of the terminal gut is under the control of nutrients, the autonomic nervous system and hormones. Catecholamines, and the non-specific beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induce PYY secretion from rat isolated colon or ileum. Because beta3-adrenergic receptors now appear to mediate many of the effects of catecholamines in the gastrointestinal tract, we investigated the involvement of beta1-, beta2-, and beta3-adrenoceptor stimulation in PYY secretion from the isolated, vascularly perfused rat colon. Infusion of 10(-6) M isoproterenol induced a transient increase in PYY secretion (from 36+/-4 to 87+/-20 fmol/2 min; n=7, P<0.05), that was abolished by a previous infusion of the beta1- and beta2-adrenergic blocker (and partial beta3-agonist) alprenolol (10(-6) M). The beta1-adrenergic agonist dobutamine and the beta-2 agonist terbutaline also (both at 10(-5) M) significantly stimulated PYY secretion, from 29+/-1 to 79+/-12 fmol/2 min and from 19+/-1 to 73+/-13 fmol/2 min respectively (n=7, P<0.05). Neither of the beta3-adrenergic agonists tested (BRL 37 344 (10(-5), 10(-6) M) and SR 58 611A (10(-6) M)) significantly stimulated PYY secretion, thus confirming the exclusive involvement of beta1- and beta2-receptors in beta-adrenergic agonist induced hormone secretion.", 
    "156": "Prophylactic treatment is mainly intended to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks. It is usually proposed to patients who suffer from two or more attacks per month. It should also be considered in patients who suffer from less frequent, but prolonged, disabling attacks with a poor response to abortive treatment, and who consider that their quality of life is reduced between attacks. Excessive intake of acute medication, more than twice a week, is a strong indication for prophylactic treatment. In order to obtain a good compliance to treatment, the patient must be informed of the expected efficacy of the drugs, and of their most frequent side effects. Thus, the choice of a prophylactic drug is made together with the patient. Based on the results of published controlled trials, the main prophylactic drugs are some betablockers, methysergide, pizotifene, oxetorone, flunarizine, amitriptyline, NSAIDs, and sodium valproate. Some less evaluated drugs such as aspirin, DHE, indoramine, verapamil, may be useful. Other substances such as riboflavin and new antiepileptic dugs are being evaluated. The choice of the drug to start with depends on several considerations. The first step is to make sure that there are no contra indications, and no possible interaction with the abortive medications. Then, possible side effects will be taken into account, for example, weight gain is a problem for most young women and patients who practice sports may not tolerate betablockers. Associated pathologies have to be checked. For example, a hypertensive migraine sufferers may benefit from betablockers; in a patient who suffers both from migraine and tension type headaches or from depression, amitriptyline is the first choice drug. The type of migraine should also be considered; for instance, in frequent attacks with aura, aspirin is recommended and betablockers avoided. In most cases, prophylaxis should be given as monotherapy, and it is often necessary to try successively several drugs before finding the most appropriate one. Doses should be increased gradually, in order to reach the recommended daily dose, only if tolerance permits. The treatment efficacy has to be assessed after 2 or 3 months, during which the patient must keep a headache diary. If the drug is judged ineffective, an overuse of symptomatic medications should be checked, as well as a poor compliance, either of which may be responsible. In case of a successful treatment, it should be continued for 6 or 12 months, and then, one should try to taper off the dose in order to stop the treatment or at least to find the minimum active dose. Relaxation, biofeedback, stress coping therapies, acupuncture are also susceptible to be effective in migraine prophylaxis.", 
    "157": "A pharmacoepidemiological survey was conducted in order to understand the pattern of migraine prophylactic drug utilization by French physicians. Neurologists and primary care physicians completed a phone-mail-phone questionnaire which inquired about migraine prophylactic treatment. French neurologists and PCP made the same use of migraine prophylaxis in terms of indication, time interval between treatment onset and evaluation, and duration. The two most commonly chosen migraine prophylactic agents were dihydroergotamine and beta-blockers. This study also showed the importance of considering quality of life to evaluate efficacy of migraine prophylaxis.", 
    "158": "To evaluate randomly the effect of thyrostatic treatment (tiamazole) versus selective (metoprolol) and nonselective beta-blockade (propranolol) on whole-body energy metabolism in women with hyperthyroidism.", 
    "159": "beta-blockade is used as an alternative to thyrostatic drugs in the preoperative treatment of patients with hyperthyroidism. beta-blockers have well-established symptomatic effects, but in contrast to antithyroid drugs beta-blockade is thought to lack direct effects on the increased metabolism in hyperthyroidism.", 
    "160": "Whole-body oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production was measured in a semiopen canopy system with paramagnetic O2 and infrared CO2 sensors. A constant flow generator and the gas-dilution method for calculation of gas flow were used. Anabolic parameters were body weight, triceps skinfold, and arm muscle circumference.", 
    "161": "Tiamazole normalized oxygen consumption and induced signs of anabolism with improved nutritional state. Metroprolol did not affect oxygen consumption. Propranolol reduced elevated oxygen consumption by 54%. Body weight and other anthropometric assessments were stable after specific and nonspecific beta-blockade, which also led to symptomatic relief in approximately 90% of the patients.", 
    "162": "Tiamazole was the most effective drug to oppose the adverse effects of hyperthyroidism. Therefore, thyrostatic agents are recommended for preoperative treatments of patients with severe catabolic hyperthyroidism. Whenever beta-blockers are chosen for treatment of hyperthyroidism, propranolol (beta 1 + beta 2) has an advantage because it reduces the metabolic rate, whereas selective beta 1-blockade seemed to provide only symptomatic relief, related to the normalization of heart rate.", 
    "163": "Understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure has advanced over the last decade, resulting in new therapeutic advances. Convincing data exist that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and adrenergic blockade are the most important therapies and have the capacity to improve survival and lower morbidity. Higher doses of both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers appear to provide additional benefits. The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone, when used in severe heart failure, provides additional survival advantage when added to standard triple therapy. Angiotensin receptor blockers have not been shown to be superior to ACE inhibitors, and their role in heart failure treatment requires further investigation. No trial's data support the use of inotropic agents or calcium channel blockers in heart failure. A number of new therapeutic agents, including vasopressin antagonists and tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor antibody are in phase II and III clinical trials. If proved beneficial, they may provide new treatment options for patients with heart failure. Nevertheless, the current challenge is to increase the use of proven therapies, namely ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, to improve outcomes in the rapidly growing population of patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "164": "This study used intracellular recording of excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) and focal extracellular recording of excitatory junction currents (EJCs) to investigate the effects of agents that modulate intracellular cAMP levels on sympathetic neuroeffector transmission in the guinea-pig vas deferens. In this tissue, postjunctional electrical activity is produced by neurally released ATP. The adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (0.5-5 microM) increased the amplitude of all EJPs evoked by trains of 20 stimuli at I Hz. Forskolin (5 microM) also increased the probability of recording EJCs without changing the amplitude distributions of spontaneous EJP and EJCs, indicating that this agent does not change the postjunctional sensitivity to spontaneously released quanta of ATP. EJP amplitudes were also increased by 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (10 microM), 8-bromo-cyclic GMP (10 microM), the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100 and 1,000 microM) and the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline (1 microM). The selective protein kinase A inhibitors, H-89 (10 microM) and the Rp isomer of adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS, 100 microM), and the broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitors, [1-(5-isoquinolinesulphonyl)-3-methylpiperazine-diHCl (H-7, 100 microM) and staurosporine (1 microM), did not block the facilitatory effects of forskolin on EJP amplitude. In addition, the effects of forskolin were not blocked by the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel blocker, spermine (50 microM). These results suggest that elevating intracellular cAMP levels increases ATP release in the guinea-pig vas deferens by a mechanism which does not involve activation of protein kinases A or G.", 
    "165": "Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) has been shown to modulate beta-adrenoceptor number and function in cultured human tracheal smooth muscle cells and cardiac fibroblasts, but the mechanism is unclear. In this study, we have characterized the beta2-adrenoceptor expression by radioligand binding assay, Northern blot analysis and measurement of intracellular cAMP accumulation in a human embryonic lung fibroblast cell line (HEL299 cells). Treatment with TGF-beta1 caused a time-dependent decrease in beta2-adrenoceptor mRNA, and in receptor number after 24 h. Furthermore, nuclear run-on assays showed a 35% reduction in the transcription rate of the beta2-adrenoceptor gene with no alteration in stability of the beta2-adrenoceptor mRNA. After TGF-beta1 treatment, the basal, procaterol- and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulations were also decreased. Cycloheximide inhibited TGF-beta1-mediated reduction of beta2-adrenoceptor mRNA and protein, whilst alone caused induction of beta2-adrenoceptor mRNA without any effect on receptor number. In summary, TGF-beta1 induces beta2-adrenoceptor desensitization through the alteration in adenylyl cyclase activity and down-regulation of beta2-adrenoceptor mRNA and protein through the reduction in the rate of beta2-adrenoceptor gene transcription.", 
    "166": "The periarterial electrical nerve stimulation at a frequency of 4 Hz (30-s trains of pulses) induced a double-peaked vasoconstriction in the canine splenic artery. The treatment with chloroethylclonidine (CEC, 60 microM) markedly inhibited the second-peaked constriction, whereas it produced an insignificant effect on the first-peaked response. The vasoconstriction to noradrenaline (NA, 1 nmol) was not significantly influenced by 60 microM CEC. On the other hand, WB 4101 (1 microM) consistently abolished the vascular response induced by NA (1 nmol), but rather potentiated the double-peaked constriction. The results indicate that neuronal NA may junctionally exert its vasoconstrictor effect via an activation of postjunctional alpha1B-receptors, whereas exogenous NA may extrajunctionally activate alpha1A-receptors for its vascular action in the canine splenic artery.", 
    "167": "The properties of the beta1-/beta2-adrenoceptor partial agonist carteolol were investigated in atypical beta-adrenoceptors on the guinea pig gastric fundus. Carteolol induced concentration-dependent relaxation in this tissue (pD2 = 5.55, intrinsic activity = 0.94). However, a combination of the selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (100 microM) and the selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist butoxamine (100 microM) produced only small rightward shifts in the concentration-response curves of carteolol in the gastric fundus (pD2 = 4.91, intrinsic activity = 0.94). In the presence of both atenolol (100 microM) and butoxamine (100 microM), the non-selective beta1-, beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist (+/-)-bupranolol (10-100 microM) caused a concentration-dependent right-ward shift of the concentration-response curves for carteolol in the guinea pig gastric fundus. Schild plot analyses of the effects of (+/-)-bupranolol against carteolol gave the pA2 value of 5.29 and the Schild slope was not significantly different from unity. Furthermore, carteolol (10 microM) weakly but significantly antagonized the relaxant responses to catecholamines ((-)-isoprenaline, (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline), a selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL37344 ((R*,R*)-(+/-)-4-[2-[(2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]propyl]phenoxy-acetic acid sodium salt) and a non-conventional partial beta3-adrenoceptor agonist (+/-)-CGP12177A ([4-[3-[(1,1dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one] hydrochloride) in the guinea pig gastric fundus. These results suggest that the partial agonistic effects of carteolol are mediated by atypical beta-adrenoceptors in the guinea pig gastric fundus.", 
    "168": "Effects of higenamine on Na+, K+ and Cl- transport were studied on stripped guinea pig distal colonic mucosa in vitro using Ussing chambers. Addition of 10(-5) M higenamine induced a biphasic change in short circuit current (Isc): a transient increase followed by a long-lasting decrease that was accompanied by an increase in transepithelial conductance (Gt). The initial phase with an increase in Isc was partially inhibited by serosal bumetanide and abolished by mucosal diphenylamine-2-carboxylate, a chloride channel blocker, indicating transient induction of Cl- secretion. The second phase with a decrease in Isc was composed of two effects: the inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive electrogenic Na+ absorption and the stimulation of the bumetanide-sensitive K+ secretion. However, the initial transient increase was not observed at the lower concentration of higenamine (10(-8)-10(-6) M). All the changes in Isc and Gt induced by higenamine were suppressed by the non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol and by the beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI-118,551, but not by the beta1-adrenergic-receptor-selective antagonist atenolol or by the alpha-antagonists phentolamine, prazosin and yohimbine. These results suggest that higenamine inhibits electrogenic Na+ absorption and stimulates electrogenic K+ and Cl- secretion through beta2-adrenergic receptors in guinea pig distal colon.", 
    "169": "A head-up tilt test was performed in a 23-year-old woman with a history of two syncopal episodes. The patient developed abrupt syncope with 48 seconds of sinus arrest. Analysis of the high frequency (HF) power of heart rate variability over 24 hours before and after metoprolol therapy showed a significantly elevated HF power in this patient compared to age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. It is suggested that an exaggerated resting vagal tone might be associated with the pathogenesis of prolonged asystole in our patient.", 
    "170": "The objective was to test if changes in autonomic tone still influenced the RT-RR relationship when full RT adaptation is completed, when heart rate is controlled, and when beat-to-beat variability is abolished by atrial pacing. Eight dogs (8-11 kg) were chronically instrumented with atrial pacing electrodes. Digital ECG (1,000 Hz, 12 bits) were recorded from healthy conscious dogs during spontaneous sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing. The protocol was repeated before and after atenolol (2 mg/kg), prazosin (0.5 mg/kg), or atenolol + prazosin. A vocal incitation was used as sympathetic stimulation. Beat-to-beat quantitative analysis of the RT interval (from QRS apex to end of T wave) was correlated with the preceding RR by linear regression. In spontaneous rhythm, atenolol increased RR (P < 0.001), RT (P < 0.001), and short-term heart rate variability (P < 0.01) and decreased RT-RR slopes (P < 0.001). Prazosin did not significantly modify any parameter. Sympathetic stimulation decreased RR (P < 0.001), RT (P < 0.05), and short-term heart rate variability (P < 0.01) and increased RT-RR slopes (P < 0.001). In atrial pacing, the RT-RR slopes were steeper during pacing than during spontaneous rhythm but were not modified by pharmacological manipulation of the autonomic nervous system. During sinus rhythm the RT-RR relationship is increased by sympathetic stimulation and decreased by beta-blockade. When heart rate modulation and the effects of the time delay in RT rate adaptation are abolished by atrial pacing, the influence of autonomic tone on RT rate adaptation disappears.", 
    "171": "(+/-)-1-[4-(2-Isopropoxyethoxymethyl)-phenoxy]-3-isopropylamino-2-propanol (bisoprolol) is a potent, clinically used beta(1)-adrenergic agent. (R)-(+) and (S)-(-) enantiomers of bisoprolol were labelled with carbon-11 (t(1/2)=20.4 min) as putative tracers for the non-invasive assessment of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor subtype in the human heart and brain with positron emission tomography (PET). The radiosynthesis consisted of reductive alkylation of des-iso-propyl precursor with [2-11C]acetone in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride and acetic acid. The stereo-conservative synthesis of (R)-(+) and (S)-(-)-1-[4-(2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)-phenoxy]-3-amino-2-propanol to be used as the precursors for the radiosynthesis of [11C]bisoprolol enantiomers was readily accomplished by the use of the corresponding chiral epoxide in three steps starting from the commercially available hydroxybenzyl alcohol. The final labelled product (either (+) or (-)-1-[4-(-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)-phenoxy]-3- [11C]isopropylamino-2-propanol) was obtained in 99% radiochemical purity in 30 min with 15+/-5% (EOS, non-decay corrected) radiochemical yield and 3.5+/-1 Ci/micromol specific radioactivity. Preliminary biological evaluation of the tracer in rats showed that about 30% of heart uptake of [11C](S)-bisoprolol is due to specific binding. The high non-specific uptake in lung might mask the heart uptake, thus precluding the use of [11C](S)-bisoprolol for heart and lung studies by PET. The remarkably high uptake of the tracer in rat brain areas rich of beta-adrenergic receptors such as pituitary (1.8+/-0.3% I.D. at 30 min) was blocked by pre-treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonists propranolol (45%) and bisoprolol (51%, p<0.05). [11C](S)-bisoprolol deserves further evaluation in other animal models as a putative beta(1) selective radioligand for in vivo investigation of central adrenoceptors.", 
    "172": "The use of magnesium in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is debated, largely as a result of conflicting data from randomized controlled trials. This study evaluated the use and impact on mortality of intravenous magnesium in the treatment of patients with AMI in the United States based on data from the Second National Registry of Myocardial Infarction. Only 5.1% of 173,728 patients from 1,326 hospitals received intravenous magnesium within the first 24 hours after an AMI, and this was more common in the 59,798 patients who received thrombolytic therapy or who underwent primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary bypass grafting (CABG) than in the 113,930 patients who did not receive any reperfusion therapy (8.5% vs 3.4%, p <0.01). Magnesium use was associated with younger age, Q-wave AMI, congestive heart failure on admission, thrombolytic therapy, primary PTCA or CABG, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, and beta blocker or lidocaine use in the first 24 hours (all odds ratio > 1.2, p <0.001). Magnesium use was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.34) and with a higher mortality in patients without initial reperfusion therapy (20.2% vs 13.2%, p <0.0001) or who underwent primary PTCA or CABG (10.2% vs 7.3%, p = 0.002), but not in patients who received thrombolytic therapy (6.2% vs 5.9%, p = NS). Thus, magnesium is used infrequently in the treatment of AMI and may be associated with worse outcome.", 
    "173": "Aminoethylisothiourea (AET) is a potent inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The present study was performed to investigate whether AET and its rearrangement products might modulate vascular contraction independently of its effects as a NOS inhibitor in rat small femoral arteries. AET caused an endothelium-independent increase in contraction induced by norepinephrine (NE). This effect was not affected by either N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, nitro-L-arginine, indomethacin or propanolol, but it was suppressed in Ca(2+)-free medium. AET enhanced extracellular Ca(2+) component of NE-induced contraction, and this effect was prevented by the receptor-mediated Ca(2+) entry blocker, 1-{beta-[3-(p-methoxyphenyl)-propyloxyl]-p-methoxyphenetyl}- 1H-imidaz ole hydrochloride (SK&F 96365), but not by the voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel blocker, nitrendipine. AET did not alter the response to CaCl(2) in vessels exposed to KCl depolarization. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, 2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)indol-3-yl]-3-(indol-3-yl) (GF 109203X), prevented the potentiating effect of AET on the NE response. AET failed to produce an increase in tone in the presence of NE and GTP in permeabilized arteries. Among the AET rearrangement products, mercaptoethylguanidine produced an endothelium-independent increase in the NE response. 2-aminothiazoline had no effect, and guanidinoethyldisulphide produced relaxation. The effect of mercaptoethylguanidine was dependent on extracellular Ca(+) and was prevented by GF 109203X. These results indicate that AET is able to potentiate the contraction to NE in rat femoral resistance arteries independently of its inhibitory effect on either NOS or cyclo-oxygenase. Its effect occurs via an enhancement of SK&F 96365-sensitive Ca(2+) entry. A PKC inhibitor-sensitive mechanism also appears to be involved in the AET effect. Mercaptoethylguanidine potentiates NE response through a mechanism similar to AET."
