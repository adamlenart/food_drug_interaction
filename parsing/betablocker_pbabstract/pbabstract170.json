We therefore assessed the efficacy of beta-blockade with regards to heart rate (HR) control and image quality in an unselected patient cohort.", 
    "1": "We studied 150 consecutive patients (104 men/46 female; mean age, 56+/-13 years) referred for coronary CTA. Intravenous metoprolol (5-20mg) was administered to patients with a HR >65 beats per minute (bpm). The goal HR was defined as an average HR <65 bpm without a single measurement above 68 bpm.", 
    "2": "Overall, 45% (68/150) of patients met the HR criteria for beta-blocker administration of which 76% (52/68) received metoprolol (mean dose 12+/-10mg). Of the 52 patients who received beta-blocker versus the 98 who did not, 18 (35%) versus 62 (64%) patients achieved the goal HR, respectively. All patients who achieved the target HR had an evaluable CTA while five patients who did not achieve the target HR had at least one non-evaluable coronary artery due to motion artifact. There was also a significant reduction in any motion artifact among those who achieved the goal HR as compared to those who did not (p=0.001). Logistic regression revealed an increase in the odds of stair step artifact of 11.6% (95% CI: 2.4% decrease, 27.5% increase) per 1 bpm increase in the standard deviation of scan HR.", 
    "3": "Overall, efficacy of beta-blocker administration to reach target HR is limited. Improvements in CT scanner temporal resolution are mandatory to achieve consistently high image quality independent of HR and beta-blocker administration.",

The following variables were measured pre- and posttreatment: blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin, insulin resistance by homeostasis-model assessment, hemoglobin A1c, lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), 8-isoprostane, asymmetric dimethylarginine, oxidized LDL cholesterol, ultrasound assessment of brachial-artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), nitroglycerin-induced endothelium-independent dilation (EID), brachial and carotid artery distension, distensibility and compliance, and carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT).", 
    "6": "Both carvedilol and metoprolol treatment resulted in significant and similar decreases in systolic (P < .05) and diastolic (P < .0001) blood pressure. Compared with metoprolol, carvedilol significantly improved FMD (P < .001). No differences between groups were noted for any of the glycemic or lipid variables except for HDL cholesterol, which significantly decreased (P < .05) in the metoprolol group compared with the carvedilol group. No differences were observed between groups for CRP, the markers of oxidative stress, EID, arterial stiffness, or cIMT.",

    "8": "The present experiments were designed to study fear conditioning as an emotional learning task with disrupted visceral feedback. For that purpose we used the peripherally acting beta1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol and studied its effects on the behavior of male C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice in an exploration-related test and during fear-conditioning. In the first experiment, we treated mice with saline or different doses of the beta1-adrenergic blocker atenolol (5mg/kg and 20mg/kg body weight i.p.) 30 min before behavioral testing in a motility box. Only the high but not the low dose of atenolol led to a reduction of locomotor activity (p<0.02). Factors known to be related to emotionality (rearing, area preference) were unaffected. In a second experiment, saline- and atenolol-treated mice (same dosages and mode of application) were trained for auditory fear conditioning, and 24h later they were retested in the same environment. We found differences between the effects of atenolol upon contextual- and cue-fear conditioning. Animals treated with 20mg/kg BW doses of atenolol showed significantly decreased background contextual fear compared to saline-treated control animals. In contrast, no differences were found during CS presentation in the conditioning context between atenolol-treated animals and saline-treated controls, independent from a paired or an unpaired conditioning paradigm. Thus, the blockade of peripheral beta1-adrenoceptors by atenolol may have disrupted the positive feedback to the central nervous system via visceral afferents resulting in a decreased locomotor activity and background contextual fear.", 
    "9": "The organic solvent content and the pH in the mobile phase are the usual main factors in reversed-phase liquid chromatographic separations, owing to their strong effects on retention and/or selectivity. Temperature is often neglected. However, even in cases where the impact of this factor on selectivity is minor, the reduction in analysis time is still an interesting reason to consider it. In addition, ionisable compounds may exhibit selectivity changes, owing to the interaction of organic solvent and/or temperature with pH. The separation of ionisable compounds (nine diuretics: bendroflumethiazide, benzthiazide, bumetanide, chlorthalidone, furosemide, piretanide, probenecid, trichloromethiazide and xipamide, and two beta-blockers: oxprenolol and propranolol) exhibiting different acid-base behaviour was studied. The compounds were tested in a Zorbax SB C18 column under a wide range of conditions: 25-45% (v/v) acetonitrile, pH 3-7 and 20-50 degrees C. Models considering two factors (organic solvent/pH and temperature/pH), and three factors (organic solvent/temperature/pH) were developed from a previously reported equation, which considers the polarity contributions of solute, stationary and mobile phases. This allowed a comprehensive method to predict the retention of the 11 compounds, the modification of their acid-base behaviour (i.e. determination of protonation constants and shifts of the retention versus pH curves), and the selectivity changes within the studied factor ranges.", 
    "10": "Modern chiral stationary phases are often combined with eluents comprising a mixture of organic solvents and polar additives. The latter may cause extreme deformations of the eluted enantiomer bands in both analytical and preparative separations. In this work, we give a theoretical background for these deformations. As an experimental verification, we separate the enantiomers of different beta-blockers on a teicoplanin stationary phase (Chirobiotic T) in the presence of triethylamine/acetic acid. We show that it is possible to tune the peak shapes of the two enantiomers by varying the organic solvent composition. An advantageous situation occurs when the first eluted peak is transformed to an anti-Langmuirian shape while keeping the second enantiomer in a normal Langmuirian shape. In this situation, the two peaks tail in opposite directions with their sharp sides pointing closely to each other. It is then possible to obtain baseline resolution at higher load than when both enantiomer peaks tail in the same direction. Adsorption isotherm parameters were determined using the inverse method; no other method could be used due to the system complexity. Computer simulations, based on these parameters, agreed very well with the observed deformations, thus confirming our hypothesis of their origin.", 
    "11": "The purpose of the present study was to explore the applicability of the reciprocal permeability approach to correct for changes in thermodynamic activity when in vitro permeability data are generated in the presence of plasma proteins. Diazepam (DIA), digoxin (DIG), and propranolol (PRO) permeability was assessed in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and bovine alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). The reciprocal permeability approach was subsequently employed to calculate the true permeability coefficient (Papp(corr)) and the operational protein association constant (nK(a)). For BSA binding, good agreement was observed between the Papp(corr) values and Papp values obtained in the absence of protein. For PRO and AAG, where binding affinity was high, deviation in the reciprocal permeability plots was evident suggesting ligand depletion at low drug/high protein concentrations. Bidirectional DIG permeability data in the presence of either BSA or AAG indicated that neither protein had an effect on the efflux transporters involved in DIG permeability. The data suggest that plasma proteins can be utilized in permeability experiments with no adverse effects on transporter function and that the reciprocal permeability approach can be used to correct permeability data for changes in unbound drug concentration.",

    "14": "The mean intraocular pressure (IOP) of the treatment group was 14.8+/-3.0 mmHg before capsulotomy and 15.7+/-3.4 mmHg after capsulotomy (P>0.05), whereas IOP was 15.1+/-3.3 mmHg and 17. 2+/-4.3 mmHg (P<0.05) for the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with regard to mean IOP before capsulotomy (P>0.05), but a statistically significant difference was seen between the two groups after capsulotomy (P<0.05). Six of 91 eyes (6.6%, two with aphakia) in the treatment group had an IOP elevation greater than 6 mmHg compared with 14 of 99 eyes (14.1%, eight with aphakia) in the control group (P<0.01).",

    "20": "The Nodal and Nodal-related morphogens are utilized for the specification of distinct cellular identity throughout development by activating discrete target genes in a concentration-dependant manner. Lefty is a principal extracellular antagonist involved in the spatiotemporal regulation of the Nodal morphogen gradient during mesendoderm induction. The Xenopus Lefty proprotein contains a single N-linked glycosylation motif in the mature domain and two potential cleavage sites that would be expected to produce long (Xlefty(L)) and short (Xlefty(S)) isoforms. Here we demonstrate that both isoforms were secreted from Xenopus oocytes, but that Xlefty(L) is the only isoform detected when embryonic tissue was analyzed. In mesoderm induction assays, Xlefty(L) is the functional blocker of Xnr signaling. When secreted from oocytes, vertebrate Lefty molecules were N-linked glycosylated. However, glycan addition was not required to inhibit Xnr signaling and did not influence its movement through the extracellular space. These findings demonstrate that Lefty molecules undergo post-translational modifications and that some of these modifications are required for the Nodal inhibitory function.",

We examined the effect of carvedilol therapy on left atrial appendage functions in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Twenty patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure and resting ejection fraction < or = 40% were included in this study. LAA was visualized by transesophageal echocardiography. LAA area change (LAAAC), LAA empty velocity (LAAEV) and LAA empty velocity time integral (LAAEVTI) were calculated as the average of five cardiac cycles. A minimum dose of carvedilol administered to each patient, was titrated up to maximal dose that the patients could tolerate, during an 8-week period. After the third month of completing treatment, a second transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic study was performed. Heart rate (P < 0.001), systolic (P = 0.002) blood pressures were reduced by carvedilol therapy at the end of the third month. LAAEV (P < 0.001), LAAEVTI (P < 0.001), and LAAAC (P < 0.001) were significantly increased at the end of the third month of carvedilol therapy. This study indicates that in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure, carvedilol therapy is associated with an improvement in left atrial appendage function.",

Both metoprolol and carvedilol have demonstrated beneficial effects in placebo-controlled trials. In The Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) two beta blockers were compared in a double-blind randomized matter. This is the first direct comparison between metoprolol and carvedilol of long-term effect on survival in patients with chronic heart failure. The all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the favour of carvedilol. The dose and formulation of metoprolol used in this trial has caused debate, and it has been questioned whether a similar beta1-blockade is obtained in the two intervention groups. At this time there is an unresolved debate as to whether carvedilol is a superior beta-blocker or whether differences in beta1-blockade explained the results of COMET.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of this model to detect proarrhythmic properties by testing a set of reference compounds with known clinical profile. Moreover, these results were compared to data previously obtained using in vivo canine QT assays (QT PRODACT study).",

    "51": "A novel copolymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-chitosan (PNIPAAm-CS), was investigated for its thermosensitive in situ gel-forming properties and potential utilization for ocular drug delivery. The thermal sensitivity and low critical solution temperature (LCST) were determined by the cloud point method. PNIPAAm-CS had a LCST of 32 degrees C, which is close to the surface temperature of the eye. The in vivo ocular pharmacokinetics of timolol maleate in PNIPAAm-CS solution were evaluated and compared to that in conventional eye drop solution by using rabbits according to the microdialysis method. The C(max) of timolol maleate in aqueous fluid for the PNIPAAm-CS solution was 11.2 microg/ml, which is two-fold higher than that of the conventional eye drop, along with greater AUC. Furthermore, the PNIPAAm-CS gel-forming solution of timolol maleate had a stronger capacity to reduce the intra-ocular pressure (IOP) than that of the conventional eye drop of same concentration over a period of 12 h. In addition, the MTT assay showed that there is little cytotoxicity of PNIPAAm-CS at concentration range of 0.5-400 microg/ml. These results suggest that PNIPAAm-CS is a potential thermosensitive in situ gel-forming material for ocular drug delivery, and it may improve the bio-availability, efficacy, and compliance of some eye drugs.",

The aim of this study was to investigate if this response could be blunted by local infusions of beta-blockade (propranolol), alpha-blockade (phentolamine), or neurogenic blockade. Thirty-one young healthy volunteers underwent forearm blood flow (FBF) measurements, using venous occlusion plethysmography, during local intra-arterial infusions of metacholine (MCh; inducing EDV) and sodium nitroprussid (SNP; inducing endothelial-independent vasodilation [EIDV]), respectively. These measurements were repeated during a 5-min mental arithmetic stress test without (n = 8) or with concomitant local infusion of propranolol (n = 7) or phentolamine (n = 8) in the forearm or during axillary plexus blockade (n = 8). An index of endothelial vasodilatory function (EFI) was calculated as the EDV to EIDV ratio. Mental stress impaired EDV significantly (p < .05), and as a result, EFI was significantly reduced (p = .02). This effect on EFI could be blocked by propranolol and neurogenic blockade but not by phentolamine (p < .05). Thus, impairment of endothelial vasodilatory function induced by mental stress could be blocked by beta-adrenergic, but not alpha-adrenergic, receptor blockade.",

In perfused rabbit hearts, the effects of HMR 1556 (10 and 100 nM) in the presence of isoproterenol (5 nM) on MAPD90 and VERP were studied at cycle lengths (CLs) 200-500 msec. In vivo, HMR 1556 prolonged MAPD90 by 6 +/- 1 msec at CL 200 msec (P < 0.01, n = 6), lowered DFT from 558 +/- 46 V to 417 +/- 31 V (P < 0.01), and decreased the coefficient of variation in the VF inter-beat deflection intervals from 8.9 +/- 0.6% to 6.5 +/- 0.4% (P < 0.05) compared with control. In perfused rabbit hearts, isoproterenol shortened MAPD90 by 5 +/- 1 msec at CL 200 msec and 11 +/- 4 msec at CL 500 msec (P < 0.05, n = 7).

The device designed was appropriate for on-line in-tube SPME coupled to pCEC or muHPLC. The evaluation of this hyphenation was first carried out for in-tube SPME-muHPLC with analytical capillaries packed with 3 microm octadecyl silica (ODS). Theobromine (TB), theophylline (TP), and caffeine (CA) were chosen as model drugs for an easy comparison with the results obtained by in tube SPME-HPLC. The detection limits of these three analytes were improved more than 100 times when compared with the direct analysis by muHPLC. Then in-tube SPME-pCEC with CEC capillaries packed with perphenylcarbamoylated beta-CD-bonded silica particles was applied to the determination and analysis of propranolol enantiomers in human urine. Under optimal extraction and separation conditions, the experimental LODs were 4 and 7 ng/mL for (S)-propranolol and (R)-propranolol, respectively. The calibration curves showed good linearity for both (S)-propranolol (R(2) = 0.9997) and (R)-propranolol (R(2) = 0.9996) over the concentration range from 20 to 5000 ng/mL.

The aim of this study was to clarify the cardioprotective mechanism of landiolol. Experiments were performed on Langendorff-perfused rat hearts undergoing 20 min stabilization, and 45 min of ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Various drugs with or without landiolol (100 microM) were administered before ischemia for 20 min. Preischemic administration of landiolol reduced cardiac cellular damage and improved the recovery of cardiac function by about 40%. The alpha1 blocker prazosin, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine or the K(ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide, but not the selective mitochondrial K(ATP) channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate abrogated the cardioprotective effect induced by landiolol. Following landiolol pretreatment the activation of PKCepsilon and heat shock protein 27 were significantly higher than that in control. These data indicate that preischemic application of landiolol induces cardioprotective effects through PKCepsilon-mediated pathway, similar to that afforded by ischemic preconditioning.",

Most relevant metabolic oxidations can be mimicked by at least one of the three investigated systems. The EC oxidation system successfully mimics benzylic hydroxylation, hydroxylation of aromatic rings containing electron-donating groups, N-dealkylation, S-oxidation, dehydrogenation and less efficiently N-oxidation and O-dealkylation. The EC-Fenton system is able to mimic aliphatic hydroxylation, benzylic hydroxylation, aromatic hydroxylation, N-dealkylation, N-oxidation, O-dealkylation, S-oxidation and dehydrogenation. The porphine system mimics all types of reactions although the yields are low for some reactions. In conclusion, these three complementary systems can be used during the drug discovery and development of new drugs to elucidate the structure of metabolites that are difficult to characterize in biological matrices. Moreover, such techniques can replace the classical chemistry strategy, especially when synthesis is complicated or too time-consuming in order to access metabolites for further testing.",

Electron tomography showed that the majority of these membrane profiles originate from coated buds, indicating a block in membrane fission. Under these conditions the Golgi-associated pool of ARFGAP1 was reduced, but there was no effect on the binding of coatomer or the membrane fission protein CtBP3/BARS to the Golgi.

Tianeptine blocked stress effects on memory without altering the stress-induced increase in corticosterone levels. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (5 and 10 mg/kg, ip), in contrast, did not block stress-induced amnesia.

Membrane currents were monitored using whole-cell patch clamp combined with a \"concentration-clamp\" fast agonist application system. Ivermectin potentiated membrane currents induced by both ATP and alpha,beta-me-ATP applied alone or in the presence of broad P2X antagonist PPADS. Ivermectin also significantly increased amplitude and frequency of spontaneous P2X-mediated EPSCs recorded from cortical slices incubated with mixture of glutamate (CNQX, D-APV, SYM2081), GABA (picrotoxin), nicotinic cholinoreceptor (hexamethonium) antagonists and sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin. These results indicate functional expression of P2X4 receptors in cortical neurones and their involvement in purinergic synaptic transmission in cortex.", 
    "122": "Several drugs, or categories of drugs, listed by the WHO and other writers and used in the treatment of chronic disease, are consistently associated with weight gain as a side effect and considered 'obesogenic'. The extent to which they may contribute to the multifactorial process behind obesity is not well documented. We systematically reviewed papers from Medline 1966-2004, Embase 1980-2004, PsycINFO 1967-2004, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, to determine the effect on body weight of some drugs that are believed to favour weight gain. We included randomized controlled studies of adult participants (>18 years) prescribed a drug considered obesogenic, that compared the 'obesogenic' drug with placebo, an alternative drug or other treatment, and that had a duration of at least 3 months: 43 studies totalling 25,663 subjects met these criteria. The main objective of the majority of studies was to compare the efficacy and safety of drug therapy, with weight change recorded under safety outcomes; weight change was a primary outcome measure in only six studies. There was evidence of weight gain for all drugs included, up to 10 kg at 52 weeks. Differences in dosage, patient population, duration of treatment and dietary advice make generalization of the results difficult. Data on body weight are often not recorded in published clinical trials or is reported in insufficient detail. This side-effect has potentially serious consequences, and should be mentioned to patients. Weight management measures should be routinely considered when prescribing drugs known to promote weight gain. Future clinical trials should always document weight changes.", 
    "123": "This study was undertaken to assess tolerability, quality of life, and persistency of use and to monitor changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) during the first 6 mo after a switch to fixed combination latanoprost/timolol. In Germany, 271 general ophthalmology practices enrolled patients who were switched from previous ocular hypotensive therapies to latanoprost/timolol for medical reasons. Usual care routines were followed, and IOP was measured at baseline and approximately 6 mo later. Adverse events were recorded throughout. Immediately before switching and at follow-up, patients completed a 29-item quality-of-life questionnaire. Of 1052 patients who met analysis criteria, 748 (71%) switched from combination therapy and 304 (29%) from monotherapy. An insufficient IOP reduction with the previous therapy was a reason for switching in 71% of patients; the desire to simplify to once-daily administration was cited in 66%. Ocular adverse events were reported in 19 patients after the switch, and 97% remained on therapy throughout the follow%up period. After switching, patients were less likely to forget to instill their eyedrops or to feel that their drops had adverse effects; they found it easier to include eyedrop administration in their routine; they were more satisfied with the frequency of instillation; and they were more likely to want to continue with the drops. Across all previous therapies, mean IOP decreased from 20.6+/-3.7 mm Hg to 17.2+/-2.8 mm Hg after the switch (P<.001)-a 14.8% difference. Fixed combination latanoprost/timolol is well tolerated and effective in patients who are switched from other monotherapies or combination therapies for medical reasons. Such a switch may be associated with improved quality of life.",

Catecholamine (CA) was increased in a case, and vanillymandelic acid (VMA) was increased in 2 cases. Bladder submucosal mass was detected by B-ultrasound in 5 cases (5/5), computerized tomography (CT) in 3 cases (3/3), cystoscopy in 5 cases (5/6). Four cases took alpha-receptor blocker for 2 weeks, 1 case took beta-receptor blocker to decrease heart rate.

    "128": "Thyme is a broncholytic und secretomotoric agent. Thus, our aim was to investigate the influence of a thyme extract on beta (2)-receptors in competition binding experiments and relaxation experiments on rat uteri and trachea. Furthermore, the influence of the extract on respiratory clearance was of interest. Binding experiments were performed using purified rat lung membranes with the beta(2)-receptor ligand [(125)I]-CYP {[(125)I]-(+/-)-Iodocyanopindolol}. The transport of the fluorescence dye rhodamin 123 concerning ciliary action in the tracheal area of a mouse was investigated using a microdialysis technique. The thyme extract reduces only slightly [(125)I]-CYP binding and amplifies the displacement of [(125)I]-CYP by propranolol (non-specific beta-receptor antagonist): the displacement curve in the concentration range representing beta (2)-receptors (nM) is shifted to the left. Thyme extract had relaxing effects on organs possessing beta (2)-receptors (uterus and trachea). The propranolol-induced antagonism to isoprenaline is reverted concentration-dependently by the extract. A duplication of the rate of ciliary clearance by the extract was observed.", 
    "129": "1) There is evidence for an influence of a thyme extract on beta (2)-receptors by both binding studies and biological effects: As can be derived from the shift of the propranolol displacement curve (nM), ingredients of the thyme extract slightly interact with beta (2)-receptors in rat lung tissue. This effect is indirect since no full range competition curve was reached. 2) An at least indirect interaction with beta (2)-receptors in rat uteri and trachea is revealed by a decreased antagonism of propranolol on the relaxing effect of isoprenaline by the plant extract. 3) An additional mechanism is presumed because at high extract concentrations isoprenaline-induced relaxation is complete, whereas the displacement of propranolol at beta (2)-receptors is only weak. 4) Thyme extract has an indirect (modulatory) effect on the beta (2)-receptor system. 5) Mucociliary clearance is improved in vivo. Its mechanism has still to be elucidated.",

In patients with chronic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, enhanced activation of neurohormonal systems including sympathetic nerve and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays the most important role in its progression and poor prognosis. Therefore, principle of treatment of chronic heart failure is inhibition of the elevated neurohormonal activity. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers are class I drugs of choice. In patients who can not tolerate angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers are used as replacement. In patients with severe heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class > III], aldosterone antagonists are added. Diuretics are also class I drug necessary for an improvement of symptoms of heart failure. Recently, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are implanted more frequently, because volume of evidence indicates benefits of these non-pharmacological treatments.

Materials and methods. 43 patients with CHD (age 63 +/- 8 years), who had sustained myocardial infarction about 6 months before, were examined. Synchronous registration of ECG and a pulsogram were made during an orthostatic test before and after therapy with metoprolol in the maximum tolerable doses during 3 months.

After adjustment for potential confounders, atenolol therapy was not associated with higher event rates than the other first-line agents, with hazard ratios ranging between 1.03 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.72-1.46] and 1.24 (95% CI 0.91-1.68) for all cohorts compared with atenolol. Similar results were observed upon stratifying the sample into subjects above and below 60 years of age.",

Hospitals with a high volume of black patients were larger and were more often teaching hospitals located in the southern United States (P<.001 for each comparison) than those with a low volume of black patients. Hospitals with a high proportion of black patients had comparable characteristics. After adjusting for hospital characteristics, hospitals that treated a high vs low volume of black patients had worse performance summary scores for acute myocardial infarction (89.0 vs 90.7; P = .002) and pneumonia measures (76.9 vs 79.4; P<.001). Adjusting for hospital referral region eliminated the gap in performance scores for acute myocardial infarction but not for pneumonia.

CHARM demonstrated that an angiotensin-receptor blocker at a proven dose is an effective and safe therapy as an alternative or in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure, 55% of whom were receiving beta-adrenergic blockers. These benefits include reductions in cardiovascular mortality rate as well as in hospitalization for heart failure.

    "145": "Flupirtine has been shown to function as a neuroprotectant and is presently used in man to treat a number of conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the specific antioxidant properties of flupirtine in relation to oxidant-induced damage to retinal photoreceptors. Initial in vitro studies on brain membranes showed that flupirtine was approximately 20 times more potent than trolox (vitamin E analogue) and 8 times more potent than metipranolol at attenuating lipid peroxidation caused by the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Subsequent immunohistochemical studies revealed that following an intraocular injection of SNP, retinal photoreceptors are the only retinal cell types that appear to be clearly affected. This was supported by electroretinogram (ERG) recordings which showed both the a- and b-wave amplitudes to be significantly reduced. Western blotting techniques showed that SNP caused a significant decrease in photoreceptor-specific markers (RET-P1, rhodopsin kinase), an increase in cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, and cleaved PARP proteins that are associated with apoptosis and no change in the ganglion cell specific marker, neurofilament (NF-L). This was supported by RT-PCR data where rhodopsin (photoreceptor specific) mRNA was reduced while Thy-1 and NF-L (ganglion cell specific) mRNAs were unaffected. In addition SNP caused an elevation of glial cell response mRNAs primarily associated with M\u00fcller cells (GFAP, CNTF, bFGF) as well as caspase-3 and Bcl-2. Importantly, when flupirtine was co-injected, the effects to the retina caused by SNP on retinal proteins and mRNAs were in most cases significantly blunted. The conclusion reached from this study is that flupirtine is a powerful antioxidant and when injected into the eye with SNP attenuates the detrimental influence of SNP to retinal photoreceptors. Since oxidative stress has been implicated in retinal diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) this study provides \"proof of principle\" for the idea that flupirtine may help individuals suffering from such retinal diseases.",

The frequency and severity of neuromuscular complications vary considerably and are probably related to the degree of hyperthyroidism, although in some patients the neuromuscular dysfunction is caused by associated disorders rather than by hyperthyroidism per se.

After 2 months of full dose treatment with either carvedilol or bisoprolol, we assessed lung function by salbutamol challenge, carbon monoxide lung diffusion (DLCO), including membrane conductance (DM), and gas exchange during exercise. FEV1 and FVC were similar; after salbutamol FEV1 was higher with bisoprolol (p<0.04). DLco was 82+/-21% of predicted with carvedilol and 90+/-20% with bisoprolol (p<0.01) due to DM changes. Peak VO2 was 17.8+/-4.5 mL/min/kg on bisoprolol and 17.0+/-4.6 on carvedilol, (p<0.05) with no differences in bronchial tone (same expiratory time) throughout exercise. Differences were greater in the 22 subjects with DLCO<80%.", 
    "151": "Carvedilol and bisoprolol have different effects on DLCO and response to salbutamol.

    "152": "A range of studies have indicated that many rhodopsin-like, family A G protein-coupled receptors, including the beta(2)-adrenoceptor, exist and probably function as dimers. It is less clear if receptors internalize as dimers and if agonist occupancy of only one element of a dimer is sufficient to cause internalization of a receptor dimer into the cell. We have used a chemogenomic approach to demonstrate that this is the case. Following expression of the wild type beta(2)-adrenoceptor, isoprenaline but not 1-(3''4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-butanone, which does not have significant affinity for the wild type receptor, caused receptor internalization. By contrast, 1-(3'4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-butanone, but not isoprenaline that does not have high affinity for the mutated receptor, caused internalization of Asp(113)Serbeta(2)-adrenoceptor. Following co-expression of wild type and Asp(113)Serbeta(2)-adrenoceptors each of isoprenaline and 1-(3'4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-butanone caused the co-internalization of both of these two forms of the receptor. Co-expressed wild type and Asp(113)Serbeta(2)-adrenoceptors were able to be co-immunoprecipitated and 1-(3'4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-butanone produced internalization of the wild type receptor that was not prevented by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol that binds with high affinity only to the wild type receptor. These results demonstrate that agonist occupancy of either single binding site of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor dimer is sufficient to cause internalization of the dimer and that antagonist occupation of one of the two ligand binding sites is unable to prevent agonist-mediated internalization.",

    "160": "The adjustment of medications and dosages to the needs of individual patients with heart failure is mostly intuitive, but even when their effect on global myocardial function is measured by classic indexes, their effect on segmental function is overlooked. This study was conducted to assess the feasibility of using echocardiographic myocardial strain imaging to evaluate the effect of medication on global and segmental function in 21 ambulatory patients with heart failure (mean age 65+/-11 years) who had echocardiographic studies performed before and 2 hours after ingesting their regular morning medications. The ejection fraction, global and regional strain, and time to regional peak strain were compared between the 2 examinations. Medication induced no significant changes in mean ejection fraction (28.6+/-7.8% to 27.5+/-9.9%) and mean global strain (-9.5+/-3.6% to -9.8+/-3.2%). Changes in segmental strain depended on baseline function: normal segments (peak strain more negative than -12%) deteriorated (-15.5+/-2.7% to -13.7+/-4.6%, p<0.0001), but dysfunctional segments (peak strain less negative than -8%) improved (-5.3+/-2.0% to -7.4+/-4.3%, p<0.0001). Medication also improved segmental synchronization: average time to peak strain of segments in which peak strain was attained before aortic valve closure increased (325+/-69 to 375+/-100 ms, p<0.0001), but that of segments with postsystolic shortening at baseline decreased (451+/-93 to 435+/-93 ms, p<0.006). Thus, the time interval between time to peak strain of segments with systolic and post-systolic shortening at baseline was halved after medication. In conclusion, medications for heart failure induced an increase in the echocardiographically determined peak strain of myocardial segments with impaired function at baseline but decreased the peak strain of normally contracting segments. Medications also improved the synchronization of myocardial contraction. Neither the global ejection fraction nor global strain reflected these changes. Thus, medication tended to improve the homogeneity of left ventricular contraction.",

This study was conducted to determine the accuracy of 64-slice MSCT in a relatively unselected group of 143 patients with presentations suggestive of coronary artery disease, including those with unstable angina pectoris, who underwent both coronary computed tomographic angiography and invasive coronary angiography. No arrhythmia was considered an exclusion criterion except for atrial fibrillation or frequent extrasystoles. In patients with fast heart rates, a beta blocker was administered orally. Data were obtained using electrocardiography gated 64-slice MSCT. Computed tomographic angiography and invasive coronary angiography findings of each coronary segment were compared to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MSCT in the detection of their normalcy or insignificant (<50% diameter decrease) stenosis versus significant (>or=50% diameter decrease) stenosis or total occlusion. In per-patient assessment, the calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MSCT were 96%, 67%, 91%, and 83%, respectively. These values in per-artery evaluation were 94%, 94%, 87%, and 97%, and corresponding values in per-segment analysis were 92%, 97%, 77%, and 99%, respectively.

    "162": "We have assessed amyloid beta protein (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity, with and without added tunicamycin (TM), an inhibitor of N-glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHCs). In the rat OHCs cultured for 3 weeks, there was little neurotoxicity after treatment with Abeta(25-35) (25 microM) alone for 48 h. However, with TM alone, concentration-dependent neuronal death was observed at concentrations between 20 and 80 microg/mL. When amyloid-beta protein was combined with tunicamycin (Abeta+TM), cell death was more acute than with TM alone. Western blot analysis revealed that calpain activity and the active forms of caspase-12 and caspase-3 was increased after exposure to Abeta+TM as compared with exposure to TM alone. In contrast, the levels of glucose regulated protein (GRP)94, GRP78 and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were not changed in the presence of Abeta. Abeta potentiation of TM neurotoxicity was reversibly blocked by S-allyl-L-cysteine (SAC), an organosulfur compound purified from aged garlic extract, and the L-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, in a restricted neuronal area of the OHCs. Simultaneously applied SAC also reversed the increases in calpain activity and the active forms of caspase-12 and caspase-3 by Abeta+TM with no change in the increased levels of GRP94, GRP78 and CHOP. These data indicate that Abeta facilitates the calpain-caspase-12-caspase-3 pathway, thus potentiating TM-induced neuronal death in the hippocampus.",
