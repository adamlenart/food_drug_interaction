We describe assays for the in vitro metabolism of (+)- and (-)-bufuralol, debrisoquine, and dextromethorphan in human liver microsomes and reconstituted purified cytochrome P-450 isozymes. These assays combine nonextractive sample preparation by precipitation of protein with perchloric acid with reversed-phase inorganic ion-pair HPLC and fluorescence detection. The minimal detectable levels of the major metabolites formed are 1'-hydroxybufuralol, 0.1 ng/ml; 4-hydroxydebrisoquine, 0.8 ng/ml; and dextrorphan, 0.1 ng/ml. Formation of these metabolites is linear for at least 45 min and between 1 and 100 micrograms of microsomal protein. Comparative kinetic analysis of the three monooxygenase reactions in human liver microsomes revealed an apparent biphasicity of (+)- and (-)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation but monophasic formation of 4-hydroxydebrisoquine in the substrate concentration range (less than 1 mM) studied. These data, in combination with those obtained by purified human cytochrome P-450 isozymes indicate the involvement of the same enzyme in the metabolism of all three substrates investigated. However, additional and distinct activities contribute to the metabolism of (+)- and (-)-bufuralol and dextromethorphan.", 
    "1": "A 55-year old male patient, with dizzy spells during everyday activity and a complete right bundle branch block as the sole electrocardiographic abnormality, reproducibly demonstrated tachycardia-dependent Mobitz Type II- and 2:1 second degree atrioventricular block. An electrophysiologic study revealed a provocable block within the distal portion of the bundle of His without evidence of a split His potential. Because of the truly tachycardia-dependent AV-block, beta-blocker medication was initiated to prevent high sinus rates during everyday activity. This therapy abolished symptoms totally.", 
    "2": "The antiarrhythmic potency of naloxone was determined by a screening test using the isolated ischaemic perfused rat heart preparation. The cardiac antiarrhythmic potency CAP50 with 95% confidence limit was 818 nmole/heart (646-985) and relative potency 0.22 compared with 0.35, 0.51 and 1.0 for lidocaine, quinidine and propranolol, respectively. These values are of clinical importance when considering the use of naloxone as an antiarrhythmic agent.", 
    "3": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is present in nerve fibres throughout the mammalian heart. We have elucidated the effects of NPY on the isolated papillary muscle and heart (Langendorff) from the guinea-pig. The paced papillary muscle was studied with regard to duration of the action potential, peak force, maximum rate of force development, time to peak force, and time from peak force to half relaxation; all these parameters were identical whether or not NPY (5 X 10(-7) M) was present in the medium. When a stimulation with trains of pulses was superimposed, the paced papillary muscle exhibited enhanced contractions. This increase in contractility was not observed in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (10(-6) M) and was thus considered to be adrenergically mediated. The latter (adrenergic) response was markedly attenuated by NPY. Since NPY did not interfere with the response to exogenous noradrenaline (NA) it is suggested that the peptide exerts a pre-junctional inhibitory affect on adrenergic nerve-mediated positive inotropy. Neuropeptide Y did not influence the electrocardiogram from the spontaneously beating heart (Lagendorff), nor did the peptide modify the positive chronotropic effect of exogenously applied NA. In conclusion, the results indicate that NPY is without effect on the heart muscle proper but that the sympathetic terminals of the heart possess pre-junctional receptors for NPY (and/or related peptides) related to suppression of stimulated NA release.", 
    "4": "The effects of the non-selective beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol (known for its anti-lipolytic activity) on body composition were investigated in growing male rats on normal unrestricted diet (N = 7) and on diet restriction (N = 7, 95% of controls). Three animals in each group were injected i.p. with 30 mg propranolol per kg body weight (bw) dissolved in saline, 5 days/week. This dose attenuates exercising heart rate by 25% and exercise training-induced enzyme activity. The remaining animals received saline. Fat, glycogen, moisture and non-ether extractable residue were determined in the homogenized residue of the whole animal. After 9 weeks on the experimental regimen, bw gain was significantly lower in the diet restricted rats, whereas propranolol had no effect on the bw gain. The percentage of fat, moisture and non-ether extractable residue were unchanged by either propranolol or diet restriction. However, glycogen content was significantly lower in the beta-blocked rats either with or without diet restriction. These data indicated that neither beta-adrenergic blockade nor minimal diet restriction influences the percentage body fat, whereas body glycogen content is decreased under both conditions.", 
    "5": "Plasma oxprenolol concentrations were measured in eight healthy volunteers who received equivalent oral doses of the drug in the form of an aqueous solution and a 10/170 oxprenolol Oros drug delivery system. Absorption from the lower gastrointestinal tract was assessed by measurement of plasma concentrations after rectal administration of the pre-equilibrated Oros systems. Because three of the first four volunteers suffered local irritation, however, the other four volunteers received Slow Trasicor 160 mg orally as a comparative preparation. The rate of in vivo absorption after oral administration of the Oros system closely mirrored its in vitro release rate. Drug availability from Oros was reduced, however, and was equivalent to 77% of that from the oral solution. Oxprenolol was well absorbed from the rectum while the system was present in this segment of the gut. The reduced systemic availability in three of the volunteers could be accounted for largely by drug loss when the system was expelled. Slow Trasicor produced higher peaks but lower 24 h plasma concentrations than the orally administered Oros system. As judged from the relative areas under the plasma concentration-time curve, however, the availability of the drug from the two dosage forms was comparable.", 
    "6": "Fetal circulation was studied by means of combined real-time and pulsed Doppler ultrasound in 14 women with pregnancy-associated hypertension before and during the first and third days of treatment with the beta 1-selective blocker, atenolol; in seven of the women the maternal uterine arcuate blood velocity waveform was also studied. Blood flow characteristics were normal both in the fetus and in the maternal arcuate artery, compared with those in uncomplicated pregnancies of corresponding gestational ages. Volume blood flow remained unchanged in the fetal descending aorta, and in the umbilical vein during atenolol treatment, whereas the pulsatility index increased in the fetal descending aorta and in the arcuate artery. This suggests that the peripheral vascular resistance, both on the maternal and fetal side of the placenta, increased during short-term antihypertensive treatment with atenolol.", 
    "7": "The effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade on electrocortical activity-related cyclic variability in fetal heart rate and mean arterial pressure were investigated in eight fetal lambs between 119 and 138 days of gestation. In the absence of adrenergic blockade, fetal heart rate during high-voltage slow activity was significantly higher than that during low-voltage fast activity. Propranolol (2.0 mg/hr) produced a decrease in fetal heart rate, but the decrease was only statistically significant during high-voltage slow activity. Phentolamine (5.0 mg/hr) induced a significant increase in fetal heart rate with a small but statistically significant decrease in mean arterial pressure. The cyclic variability in fetal heart rate between low-voltage fast activity and high-voltage slow activity was abolished by propranolol and enhanced by phentolamine. These results indicate that the cyclic variability in the fetal heart rate associated with electrocortical activity can be accounted for by cyclic fluctuation in sympathetic activity.", 
    "8": "Labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agent, was studied as a hypotensive agent during halothane (mostly 0.5 vol.%)-N2O-fentanyl-d-tubocurarine anaesthesia with a head-up tilt of 5 degrees in 41 patients undergoing middle ear microsurgery. After the mean initial dose of 0.3 mg/kg, the mean need for labetalol ranged from 0.05 to 0.07 mg/kg at 30 +/- 5-min intervals. The mean duration of the hypotensive period was 102 min. During the hypotension, the average mean arterial pressure ranged from 59 to 62 mmHg (7.9-8.3 kPa) and the mean heart rate from 61 to 66 b.p.m. After labetalol the maximum cardiac output decrease was 7%. Before labetalol the mean PaO2 value was 158 mmHg (21.1 kPa) and during hypotension it ranged from 145 to 149 mmHg (19.3-19.9 kPa) when FiO2 was 40%. The only peroperative side effects were ECG changes (middle junctional rhythm and sinus bradycardia) which occurred in 10% of the patients. The mean value for the degree of haemostasis rated by the otologist on a visual analogue scale between poor (0 mm) and excellent (100 mm) was 91 mm. The patients were able to open their eyes and to give their names 8-9 min after the end of anaesthesia. After extubation the patients were normotensive and there were no clinically significant changes in the cardiovascular parameters during the 4-h recovery room period. Acid-base status showed slight metabolic acidosis. The most common postoperative side effects were nausea only and nausea + vomiting, which occurred in 39% and 20% of the patients, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Evidence obtained to date indicates that beta adrenergic receptors in the brain may be involved in the effects of antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, it has been suggested that centrally acting beta adrenergic agonists might possess antidepressant activity. However, preclinical as well as clinical studies of the effects of beta adrenergic agonists have been limited due to the lack of compounds that penetrate into the central nervous system after peripheral administration. Recent results indicate that the beta adrenergic agonists clenbuterol and prenalterol are active centrally. For this reason, it was of interest to begin to assess their behavioral effects. It was found that clenbuterol and prenalterol, in a dose-dependent manner, reduced response rate and increased reinforcement rate under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72-sec schedule. The effects of these agonists were very similar to those of proven antidepressant drugs. The effects of the agonists clenbuterol and prenalterol, as well as the effects of the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine, on response and reinforcement rate were antagonized by the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol. The present results indicate that clenbuterol and prenalterol are active behaviorally and that their effects appear to be mediated by beta adrenergic receptors. The similarity between the behavioral effects of the beta adrenergic agonists and those of proven antidepressant drugs provides evidence consistent with the contention that centrally acting beta adrenergic agonists might possess antidepressant activity.", 
    "10": "To determine the hemodynamic effects of isomazole, an imidazopyridine, we administered isomazole (10 and 20 micrograms/kg/min) to 10 awake dogs with right-sided congestive heart failure produced by pulmonary artery constriction and tricuspid valve avulsion. Isomazole increased cardiac output, heart rate, right ventricular and left ventricular (LV) dP/dt, LVdP/dt/P and decreased aortic pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance. Simultaneously, blood flow increased to myocardium, quadriceps muscle, brain and splanchnic beds, whereas vascular resistance decreased. Furthermore, isomazole increased LV oxygen consumption and decreased transcoronary arteriovenous oxygen difference. Similar administration of normal saline had no effects. Angiotensin II was infused to restore mean aortic pressure to base-line values during isomazole infusion; however, despite the return of aortic pressure to base-line values, cardiac output, LVdP/dt and LVdP/dt/P remained elevated. The systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of isomazole were unaffected by pretreatment with propranolol and mecamylamine. Thus, isomazole exerted positive inotropic, chronotropic and vasodilator effects in congestive heart failure dogs. The inotropic effect of isomazole was independent of the decrease in aortic pressure, and the hemodynamic effects of isomazole were not mediated via the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, the decrease in transcoronary arteriovenous oxygen difference suggests that isomazole exerted an active coronary vasodilator action which may improve myocardial oxygen demand/supply ratio.", 
    "11": "Hormonal control of glucose production and of L-pyruvate kinase activity has been measured in isolated liver cells from fed control and thyroidectomized rats. In hypothyroid rats, sensitivity to isoproterenol as measured by these parameters was increased: the apparent K0.5 for isoproterenol-induced stimulation of glucose production decreased from 8.0 +/- 3 X 10(-6) M in control rats to 2.0 +/- 0.2 X 10(-8) M in hypothyroid rats (P less than 0.001) and the apparent K0.5 for inhibition of L-pyruvate kinase was 5 +/- 2 X 10(-7) M vs. 7 +/- 2 X 10(-9) M (P less than 0.001) in control and thyroidectomized rats, respectively. Utilisation of specific adrenergic antagonists confirmed increased beta-adrenergic responsiveness in hypothyroid rats. This phenomenon was not reversed by 3 days of T3 treatment (10 micrograms/100 g body weight). Sensitivity to the alpha-agonist was unchanged by thyroid status. Stimulation of glucose production and inhibition of L-pyruvate kinase activity by glucagon and their reversal by insulin were not affected by hypothyroidism. The dose-response curve to vasopressin and its maximal effect measured on stimulation of glucose production were unchanged in thyroidectomized rats. Thus, hypothyroidism produces a specific enhancement of liver beta-adrenergic responsiveness without affecting sensitivity to glucagon, insulin and vasopressin.", 
    "12": "Sixteen healthy males volunteered to perform both an incremental maximal and prolonged submaximal treadmill test with beta-blockade (2 X 80 mg oral propranolol per day) or matched placebo in a blind crossover design. Prior to and following the prolonged exercise, electrical stimulation of the triceps surae was performed to examine contractile properties. During the maximal test, the heart rate (HR) was reduced at all times by beta-blockade. The time to exhaustion in this test was significantly reduced by beta-blockade (P less than 0.03), while the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) was not significantly lower (P = 0.06). In response to prolonged treadmill walking at 60% of VO2 max, the HR was reduced but VO2, respiratory quotient and ventilation were not affected by beta-blockade relative to placebo. Plasma concentrations of free fatty acids increased during exercise in the placebo but not beta-blocked treatment (P less than 0.0001). Plasma noradrenalin and adrenalin increased with exercise; the increase in adrenalin with beta-blockade was greater than that with placebo (P less than 0.0001). The RPE obtained at intervals during the prolonged exercise were greater for beta-blockades than placebo. Eight of 16 subjects were unable to complete full 90 min with beta-blockade; but all 16 completed the test with placebo. The electrically evoked twitches in the triceps surae muscle group after exercise did not differ in peak torque or one-half relaxation time compared to pre-exercise. The time to peak twitch torque was significantly shorter after exercise. No differences in twitch were observed due to beta-blockade. The tetanic responses at 10, 20, 50 and 100 Hz were not affected by either exercise or the beta-blockade. In conclusion, an increased subjective estimate of fatigue (RPE) was observed during prolonged exercise with beta-blockade. This subjective fatigue did not relate to altered peripheral muscle force production during electrical stimulation. The results suggest either a central rather than peripheral origin of fatigue, or fatigue in a muscle group not examined by stimulation of the triceps surae.", 
    "13": "The contractile characteristics of the triceps surae muscle group were examined before and after repeated isometric contractions in two groups of eight healthy young males. Single twitches and trains of stimuli at 10, 20, 50 and 100 Hz were delivered to the muscle using supramaximal voltages. Subjects were treated with beta-blockade (2 X 80 mg oral propranolol, beta-b) or matched placebo in a double-blind crossover design. Four different exercise conditions were studied: (I) maximal voluntary contraction (MVC); (II) MVC during circulatory occlusion; (III) electrical stimulation at 20 Hz using 50% of voltage required for maximal torque production; and (IV) electrical stimulation with occlusion. Each contraction was for 5 s with 5 s recovery. Total duration of exercise was 10 min for non-occluded contractions and to a 50% decline in torque output with occlusion. At rest prior to exercise, maximal voluntary contraction was significantly reduced (5.7%) by beta-b during 40 observations in 16 subjects. Following exercise without occlusion (I and III), the reduction in torque output of the muscle at 10 and 20 Hz stimulation was generally greater during beta-b than placebo. This low frequency fatigue was longer-lasting with beta-b. The shorter lasting reduction in torque at 50 and 100 Hz was generally not different between beta-b placebo. After exercise with occlusion (II and IV), the torque output at all stimulation frequencies was reduced to a similar extent in both placebo and beta-b at most comparison points. Twitch responses after exercise with occlusion showed decreases in peak tension and time to peak tension and a lengthening of one-half relaxation time in both placebo and beta-b. It was concluded that the greater reduction in torque output of the triceps surae muscle group at low frequencies during beta-b was probably a consequence of a reduction in blood flow relative to the placebo treatment. This relative low frequency fatigue could be responsible for the increased perception of effort in patients exercising during beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "14": "Sixty eyes undergoing Q-switched neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy were randomly assigned to pretreatment with either 0.5% timolol maleate or placebo. Half of the eyes in each group underwent capsulotomies performed with six 2-mJ bursts of energy, and the remaining eyes underwent capsulotomies performed with three 4-mJ bursts of energy. There was no significant difference in pressure responses between eyes treated with 2 or 4 mJ. The mean rise in intraocular pressure was significantly less in the timolol-pretreated group one hour after capsulotomy. After four hours, the difference between groups was not significant. Pretreating with timolol did not prevent late pressure rises. Nonpseudophakic eyes were more likely to sustain pressure increases greater than 10 mm than were pseudophakic eyes.", 
    "15": "Electrical pacing enhances absorption from the canine small bowel, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. To explore the mechanism, conscious dogs with two Vella loops, a proximal jejunal and a distal ileal, each 50 cm long, were studied. Pacing the jejunal loop with 15-18 pulses/min entrained the pacesetter potentials of the jejunal loop and increased water, sodium, and glucose absorption from the jejunal loop. Jejunal pacing also increased water absorption from the unpaced, ileal loop. Conversely, ileal pacing did not entrain the ileal loop or enhance absorption from the ileal loop. However, it did enhance water absorption in the unpaced jejunal loop. After alpha-blockade with phentolamine or celiac and superior mesenteric ganglionectomy, jejunal pacing did not increase jejunal or ileal absorption. In contrast, after beta-blockade with propranolol, pacing still enhanced jejunal absorption in three out of four dogs. Vagotomy alone enhanced jejunal but not ileal absorption, but the enhancement was not further increased by pacing. In conclusion, electrical pacing of the small bowel elicited a local and distant increase in net water absorption; the effect was mediated in part by an alpha-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "16": "We hypothesized that when the depth of ether anesthesia is increased from 2 to 5%, cerebral vessels dilate secondary to circulating catecholamine stimulation of cerebral metabolism. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) by 133Xe clearance and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) were measured on 2% and then 5% ether in air in two groups of seven monkeys each during mechanical ventilation. Propranolol, 0.5 mg/kg i.v., was infused over 5 min in one group, and the other received saline. All measurements were repeated on 5% and 2% ether. Cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) fell by 30%, from 2.28 +/- 0.61 (mean +/- SD) to 1.51 +/- 0.28 mm Hg ml-1 100 g-1 min-1 (p less than 0.01), with the increase in ether from 2 to 5%. CBF and CMRO2 were unaltered from values of about 45 ml 100 g-1 min-1 and 2.3 ml 100 g-1 min-1, respectively. During 5% ether anesthesia, propranolol had no effect on CBF, CMRO2, or CVR. On 2% ether, it increased CVR twofold, from 1.5 +/- 0.30 to 3.0 +/- 1.0 mm Hg ml-1 100 g-1 min-1, and decreased CBF by 33%, from 48 +/- 8 to 32 +/- 10 ml 100 g-1 min-1. Plasma epinephrine was two-fold higher on 2% compared to 5% ether, both before and after saline or propranolol infusion. In monkeys, cerebrovascular dilation by ether at 5% compared to 2% is not secondary to catecholamine stimulation of CMRO2. It may result from a direct effect of either plasma catecholamines or ether on the cerebrovasculature.", 
    "17": "The efficacy and effect on cardiac function of verapamil 120 mg three times a day and atenolol 100 mg once a day, singly and in combination, were evaluated in 15 patients with angina pectoris. While they were on the combination treatment four patients withdrew from the study. Episodes of angina pectoris and glyceryl trinitrate consumption were significantly reduced only on the combination. On the combination only four patients developed evidence of ischaemia during exercise compared with seven on verapamil and ten on atenolol. ST segment depression at peak exercise, assessed by 16 point precordial mapping, was reduced by all active treatments from 7.1 on placebo to 2.7, 0.9, and 0.6 mm on atenolol, verapamil, and the combination respectively. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction fell significantly from 60% on placebo to 53% on the combination but was unchanged on verapamil and atenolol. Verapamil was an effective alternative to atenolol; the combination was the most effective treatment but was associated with a significant morbidity.", 
    "18": "Cardiac electrophysiologic effects of verapamil in vivo are the result of both direct and indirect actions on the heart (the latter due to augmentation of sympathetic neural tone, diminution of parasympathetic neural tone, and increased circulating catecholamines). In this study we assessed the interaction of verapamil's direct and indirect actions on electrophysiologic properties of the heart in awake, previously instrumented, unsedated dogs. After administration of intravenous verapamil (0.2 mg/kg), electrophysiologic effects were assessed serially over a 1 hr period in 10 awake dogs before (group 1 studies) and during pharmacologic autonomic blockade (group 2 studies), and in a subset of these dogs (n = 5) after orthotopic cardiac transplantation (group 3 studies). In group 1 dogs, sinus cycle length (SCL) initially shortened after verapamil (postverapamil 379 +/- 50 msec vs baseline of 494 +/- 72 msec, p less than .001) and subsequently gradually prolonged. In groups 2 and 3, transient SCL shortening was absent. SCL prolonged promptly after verapamil, and sinus arrest developed in two of 10 group 2 and two of five group 3 animals. Verapamil exerted a negative dromotropic effect on atrioventricular node conduction in all three experimental groups, as assessed by drug-induced changes in minimum cycle length with sustained 1:1 atrioventricular conduction and measurements of atrioventricular node effective and functional refractory period. However, compared with findings in group 1, this negative dromotropic effect occurred more rapidly and was markedly potentiated in groups 2 and 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "A series of N-alkyl-1,2-diphenylethanolamines were synthesized and their pharmacological activities evaluated on various mammalian organs and systems. All compounds produced a generalized inhibitory effect on smooth and cardiac muscles and an increase in coronary flow as well as a brief reduction in rabbit blood pressure. The latter effect was not prevented by pretreatment of the animals with atropine, propranolol, or metoprolol. The compounds were devoid of local anesthetic activity and their inhibitions of the contraction of the isolated rabbit intestine and perfused heart were reversed by exogenous calcium ions. It is proposed that the compounds produce their effects through calcium-channel blockade. The inhibitory effects of some of these compounds were comparable to those of a known calcium-channel blocker.", 
    "20": "Chronic propranolol administration is followed by some haemodynamic alterations, which may impair renal function. It has also been suggested that it may reduce platelet production of proaggregatory thromboxane (TX) A2. We therefore evaluated cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), creatinine clearance, daily sodium excretion under controlled sodium intake, platelet aggregation and platelet TXA2 production during whole blood clotting in eight patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and no ascites, before and after 3 months of propranolol administration. Liver function was also assessed by evaluating the galactose elimination capacity (GEC) and galactose clearance (Cgal). The expected, significant reduction of CI and increase of SVR was observed. Creatinine clearance and sodium balance were unchanged throughout the study. Furthermore, the renal prostaglandin system, as reflected by urinary prostaglandin E2 and TXB2 excretion, was also unaffected by the drug. No modification of platelet aggregation, platelet TXA2 production during whole blood clotting, GEC and Cgal was observed. We conclude that chronic propranolol administration is followed by alterations of CI and SVR, but it does not impair renal function and platelet aggregation in patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and no ascites. The maintenance of renal function during beta-adrenergic blockade is not due to an increased renal production of vasodilating prostaglandins.", 
    "21": "Induced hypotension is an accepted technique for reducing blood loss in various surgical procedures. This study evaluates the effectiveness of labetalol in producing controlled reduction in mean arterial pressure during orthognathic surgery. The potential advantages of this technique are ease of administration, decreased pulmonary shunting, and absence of tachycardia or rebound hypertension compared to other commonly used agents.", 
    "22": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, propranolol 80 mg did not show any hypnotic properties and even increased the insomnia in a sample of 37 patients previously treated chronically with hypnotic medication (mostly benzodiazepines). This worsening of the insomnia is consistent with the observations of sleep disturbance at the beginning of treatment with beta-blocking drugs. This lack of efficacy suggests that the anti-stress or anxiolytic properties of propranolol do not apply to the rebound insomnia seen when stopping treatment with hypnotic drugs.", 
    "23": "1. The influence of the sympathetic nervous system on urinary kallikrein excretion (UKal) was investigated in conscious rats during stress produced by inserting a silastic catheter through the urethra into the bladder. The effect of this stress on blood glucose (BG), mean arterial pressure (MAP), urinary volume (Uv), urinary sodium (UVNa), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was also studied. 2. In intact animals stress of 120 min duration produced a non-significant increase of MAP, a significant increase of BG and a decrease of UNa (P less than 0.001 t-test, 9 d.f.), but it did not affect Uv and GFR. In stressed rats UKal was considerably lower (52 milli Amidasic Units [mAU] per 100 g bodyweight, s.e.m. = 5, n = 6) than in control rats (170 mAU per 100 g, s.e.m. = 21, n = 5). The inhibitory effect on UKal was also observed when kallikrein was measured by the kininogenase method. 3. Adrenal medullectomy, performed 1 week before the experiment, suppressed the stress hyperglycaemia but did not affect the reduction of urinary kallikrein or the anti-natriuresis. 4. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of saline also had no effect in the control or in the stressed rats, while i.c.v. d-l-propranolol decreased MAP, suppressed the stress hyperglycaemia and the anti-natriuresis and stimulated UKal, without changes in Uv and GFR. Non-stressed control rats i.c.v. injected with saline excreted considerably less kallikrein than rats i.c.v. injected with d-l-propranolol (control saline: 162, s.e.m. = 14, n = 6; vs control d-l-propranolol: 559, s.e.m. = 20, n = 6). Even in stressed rats this difference was registered (stressed saline: 56, s.e.m. = 8, n = 6; vs stressed d-l-propranolol: 554 mAU per 100 g, s.e.m. = 33, n = 6). 5. Peripheral sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) did not suppress the hyperglycaemic response to stress, but it stimulated UKal. Kallikrein excretion was similar in 6-OHDA stressed (534 mAU per 100 g, s.e.m. = 30, n = 6) than in 6-OHDA control rats (491 mAU per 100 g, s.e.m. = 34, n = 6). No differences were observed on UNa and GFR between control 6-OHDA treated rats and stressed 6-OHDA treated rats. 6. The present results suggest strongly that urinary kallikrein excretion is modulated by sympathetic activity. Results after central beta-adrenergic blockade and peripheral sympathectomy led to the hypothesis that normal sympathetic tone in the kidney inhibits the release of kallikrein into the urine.", 
    "24": "We have studied the tonus of the tracheal muscle (tracheal spiral) gathered from guinea pig and kept in Tyrode solution at 38 degrees C, continuously oxygenated. Tonus variations were recorded by a tension transducer on an xy recorder. After administration of histamine (H) in the organ bathroom, we observed an increase of tonus, with large spontaneous movements of the tracheal muscle. Blocking the beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol (Pr) suppressed the effect of adrenaline (Adr) but did not influence the effects of II and acetylcholine (Ach) The reaction to II was more diminished in the presence of fosfobion (ATP) in the organ bathroom.", 
    "25": "Rats with a 4-day oestrous cycle were injected with 2.5 mg haloperidol/kg, a dopaminergic blocker, or with 2.0 mg propranolol/kg, a beta 1- and beta 2-receptor blocker, at 13.00 h on oestrus, dioestrous day 1, dioestrous day 2 or pro-oestrus. Animals were autopsied on the next expected day of oestrus. Haloperidol blocked ovulation when injected on oestrus, dioestrous day 1 or pro-oestrus and was less effective when injected on dioestrous day 2. Propranolol caused a decrease in the number of ova shed when injected on dioestrous day 2 or pro-oestrus. Serum concentrations of FSH at oestrus were below the control values in those animals in which ovulation was blocked by haloperidol. No significant changes in serum concentrations of LH were observed. The normal gonadotrophin peak which occurs during the afternoon of pro-oestrus was blocked by administration of haloperidol on oestrus or dioestrous day 1. Administration of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to haloperidol-treated animals on oestrus or dioestrous day 1 did not restore ovulation or increase serum FSH levels. When the same dose of GnRH was given to rats treated with haloperidol on pro-oestrus, they all ovulated and their FSH levels rose normally. Treatment with both FSH and LH of rats given haloperidol at oestrus restored ovulation in 50% of the animals, whereas it was ineffective in animals treated on dioestrous day 1. Fifty per cent of the animals treated with haloperidol on oestrus or dioestrous day 1 ovulated when oestradiol benzoate was injected on dioestrous day 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Forty-seven patients with chronic stable angina pectoris entered a thirteen-week open-label study with a transdermal therapeutic system of nitroglycerin in order to evaluate its clinical efficacy, safety, and patient acceptance. In 19 patients, a beta-blocker and in 17 patients a calcium-channel blocker were continued throughout the study period without alteration of their doses. The study consisted of a two-week run-in period and an eleven-week active drug period. Acute titration was done with nitroglycerin patches on the basis of weekly patient diaries on frequency of angina and sublingual nitroglycerin consumption. Overall, reductions in frequency of angina and in nitroglycerin consumption were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Adverse reactions were common but tolerable. The reported side effects were headache in 32, skin rash in 18, dizziness in 10, palpitation and itching in 9 each, nausea in 7, flushing in 3, and vomiting in 1 patient. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that individual dose titration with nitroglycerin patches for obtaining significant antianginal effect is essential. The present therapeutic system is convenient to use and well tolerated and had acceptable side effects in our study population.", 
    "27": "A vast array of new antiarrhythmic agents have joined the old agents among the clinician's available resources. While treatment of ventricular arrhythmias is completely justifiable for patients with symptoms, their use to prevent sudden cardiac death has not yet been established. Because of their potential risks, the benefit/risk ratio must always be kept in mind. If we elect to treat patients who have benign or potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias (usually to eliminate refractory symptoms) we typically begin with either a beta blocker or one of the new potent class IC antiarrhythmic agents such as flecainide or encainide. These drugs cause few side effects, no organ toxicity, and in the case of encainide or flecainide, have marked potency. Few important proarrhythmic effects are seen with these potent drugs in this group of patients. If these fail, one can try either a class IA or IB agent or a combination of a IA and IB agent. We always avoid amiodarone. In patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmias, one should choose a drug without negative inotropic potential such as quinidine or encainide as initial therapy. The combination of IA and IB agents should also be considered early in therapy. In patients with overt congestive heart failure with markedly depressed left ventricular function in the setting of lethal arrhythmias, disopyramide, beta blockers, and flecainide should be avoided. Amiodarone is used in this population only when the other available agents have proven to be ineffective or badly tolerated.", 
    "28": "This study was planned to assess whether circumflex coronary occlusion (CO) impairs the arterial baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) and hindlimb vascular resistance (HVR), and to determine the mechanisms involved in the mediation of these phenomena. Increasing doses of phenylephrine and nitroglycerin were given intravenously to anesthetized dogs with a constant flow-perfused hindlimb before and during 30-s CO. The reflex responses were assessed by the changes in HR and hindlimb perfusion pressure evoked by changes in arterial pressure following phenylephrine and nitroglycerin administration. During CO, there was an attenuation of the reflex control of HR and HVR as compared with control conditions. The application of lidocaine on the left ventricular epicardial surface was able to prevent the effect of CO on both the baroreflex responses. The intravenous administration of atropine prevented only the impairment in arterial baroreflex control of HR induced by CO. After the injection of phentolamine into the perfused hindlimb, the baroreflex had no effect on HVR either before or during CO. Finally, intravenous administration of propranolol failed to modify the effect of CO on both the baroreflex responses. These data indicate that CO attenuates the arterial baroreflex control of both HR and HVR through the stimulation of left ventricular receptors. The effect on HR is mediated by the parasympathetic system, whereas the effect on HVR is due to sympathetic efferents.", 
    "29": "Two noninvasive methods of cardiac index (Q) determination, pulsed Doppler echocardiography (QDop), and CO2 rebreathing (QCO2) were compared to dye dilution in eight normal volunteers. Measurements of Q were made by dye dilution (QDD) and the two noninvasive techniques under the following conditions: supine rest, after inflation of cuffs around the thighs, 35-degree head-up tilt, supine rest repeated, during constant isoproterenol infusion, and after an intravenous bolus of propranolol. When mean Q values of the group for each intervention were compared, close agreement was observed between dye dilution and each noninvasive method (QDOP = 1.08 QDD - 0.07 L/min X m2, r = 0.99, SEE = 0.02; QCO2 = 0.68 QDD + 0.84 L/min X m2, r = 0.97, SEE = 0.02). Fair correlations were achieved when all 48 paired observations were analyzed (QDop = 1.00 QDD + 0.17 L/min X m2, r = 0.89, SEE = 0.17; QCO2 = 0.71 QDD + 0.77 L/min X m2, r = 0.79, SEE = 0.20). However, the Doppler ultrasound technique was significantly more precise in quantitating changes in Q in individual patients. These results demonstrate that estimates of Q can be made with reasonable accuracy by either CO2 rebreathing or Doppler echocardiography. However, the Doppler technique is a much more accurate means of quantitating acute changes in Q.", 
    "30": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on the salvage and functional recovery of reperfused myocardium was investigated in anesthetized dogs. Immediately after thrombotic occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, the cardioselective beta-blocking agent metoprolol was given intravenously at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg infused over 10 min. One hour after the onset of occlusion, recanalization was initiated by intravenous infusion of recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA, 10 micrograms/kg/min for 30 min). Anatomic infarct size expressed as percent of the left ventricular mass (I/LV), global ejection fraction, and mean systolic shortening of the segmental radii (SS) of the infarcted area were measured either after 24 hr or 1 week in six groups of six dogs each: group I (rt-PA + metoprolol, evaluated at 24 hr), group II (rt-PA + metoprolol, evaluated at 1 week, group III (rt-PA alone, evaluated at 24 hr), group IV (rt-PA alone, evaluated at 1 week), group V (persistent occlusion, evaluated at 24 hr), and group VI (persistent occlusion, evaluated at 1 week). The smallest infarcts were found in reperfused dogs given metoprolol, but the differences from dogs receiving rt-PA alone were not statistically significant (I/LV, expressed as mean +/- SEM: 5.5 +/- 0.9% in group I, 6.7 +/- 1.9% in group II, 15.4 +/- 5.0% in group III, 11.4 +/- 3.5% in group IV, 23.6 +/- 2.5% in group V, and 26.9 +/- 2.3% in group VI).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "Isopropylnoradrenaline (1-2 micrograms/ml-1) induced contractile responses of the jejunum and ileum. The contractions could occur practically simultaneously with the onset of responses of arterial vessels or their latency period (reaching up to 33 sec). Blockade of M-cholinoreceptors with atropine (0.2-0.4 mg/kg) prevented both response types whereas blockade of alpha-adrenoreceptors with phentolamine (1 mg/kg) augmented them. Preliminary infusion of acetylcholine in subthreshold concentration (10(-5)-10(-6) g/ml; 1 ml/min) into the small intestine vascular bed considerably augmented the responses to isopropylnoradrenaline. The data obtained corroborate existence of presynaptic activating beta-adrenoreceptors localized on a cholinergic neuron, in the small intestine.", 
    "32": "The distribution of adrenergic receptors in specific components of the heart such as vessels and myocytes cannot be determined easily with assays of membranes prepared from homogenates of whole tissue. Accordingly, we characterized the binding of the potent nonsubtype selective antagonist [125iodo]cyanopindolol to beta-receptors in unfixed transmural slices of feline and canine left ventricle. Specific binding ratios greater than 90% were achieved at radioligand concentrations near Kd and greater than 80% at saturating ligand concentrations. Binding of radioligand to receptors in transmural slices was rapid, saturable, stereoselective, and displaceable by antagonists and agonists with the rank order of potency expected of beta-adrenergic receptors. Analysis of binding isotherms indicated maximum binding capacities of 27.8 +/- 6.6 and 40.6 +/- 5.1 fmol/mg tissue protein and dissociation constants of 10.1 +/- 1.8 and 21.3 +/- 1.6 pM in feline and canine ventricular slices, respectively. The distribution of beta-receptors in myocytes and selected vascular components of the heart was determined with quantitative film autoradiography and high resolution computer-based analysis and display of the density of binding sites, maximum binding capacity, and binding affinity measurements. The results of autoradiographic analysis revealed a uniform transmural distribution of receptors in regions composed primarily of ventricular myocytes but an inverse relation between the density of beta-receptors and the diameter of coronary vessels. Large epicardial conductance arteries had half the receptor density of subjacent myocytes; small mural arteries had approximately 60% of the beta-receptor density of nearby myocytes, and the coronary resistance arterioles had the highest receptor density of any vascular compartment, which was equivalent to that of myocytes. The methods developed should be of particular value in characterizing the distribution and function of receptor subtypes and mechanisms of regulation of adrenergic responsiveness in intact myocardium.", 
    "33": "The effects of forskolin on the secretion of pancreatic juice and on the intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides were investigated in preparations of the isolated and blood-perfused dog pancreas. Forskolin (3-100 micrograms) injected intra-arterially caused a dose-dependent increase in the secretion of pancreatic juice. The concentration of bicarbonate in the pancreatic juice induced by forskolin was increased. However, protein concentration was decreased. Forskolin-induced secretion was not modified by pretreatment with atropine, phentolamine, propranolol, cimetidine, sulpiride and verapamil. Forskolin (10-30 micrograms) significantly increased cyclic AMP concentration in the pancreatic tissue before the onset of the pancreatic secretion. On the other hand, cyclic GMP concentration was not influenced significantly throughout 30 min after the administration of forskolin. From these results, it is concluded that forskolin may produce an increase in pancreatic secretion mediated through an increase of intracellular cyclic AMP concentration.", 
    "34": "Investigations have been carried out to explain the heterogeneity of response to catecholamines of human fat cells from various deposits. Adipocytes from two subcutaneous sites (abdominal and femoral) were studied concomitantly in women while omental fat cells were taken from another group of patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Alpha-2 and beta sites were identified in fat-cell membranes with [3H]yohimbine and [3H]dihydroalprenolol, respectively. Lipolytic responses were tested with isoproterenol (beta agonist), clonidine (alpha-2 agonist) and epinephrine. There are clear differences in the relative number of beta and alpha-2 sites according to the origin of the fat deposit; beta sites are less numerous than alpha-2 sites in subcutaneous fat cells of both regions (alpha-2:beta sites are in a ratio of 3 +/- 0.4:2 +/- 0.4). However, in membranes of omental fat cells, beta sites are at least as numerous as alpha-2 sites (ratio 0.9 +/- 0.2). Epinephrine always has a higher affinity for alpha-2 sites than for beta sites in the subcutaneous and omental deposits. In lipolysis studies, epinephrine, in the absence of adenosine in the incubation medium, initiated an anti-lipolytic effect in femoral fat cells and promoted inhibition of lipolysis at lower concentrations in abdominal subcutaneous fat cells, the effect being reversed at higher doses; epinephrine, however, was always lipolytic in omental adipocytes. There was no striking differences in the sensitivity to isoproterenol in the various deposits. Clonidine had a higher affinity for alpha-2 sites in femoral fat cells and was equipotent in the omental and abdominal ones. Thus, the differences in the lipolytic responses to epinephrine in adipocytes from different sites are linked to a variable alpha-2 inhibiting effect (and alpha-2 site number) rather than to a modified beta driven increase in lipolysis initiated by the physiological amine.", 
    "35": "An intravenous infusion of platelet activating factor (Paf) in the guinea-pig elicits an increase in bronchial responsiveness to the spasmogens, histamine and bombesin. Airways obstruction induced by bombesin in Paf-treated animals is poorly reversed by isoprenaline compared to comparable airways obstruction induced by bombesin in vehicle-treated animals. Isoprenaline induced a comparable dose-related relaxation in vitro of tracheal smooth muscle isolated from Paf- and vehicle-treated animals. No change in beta-adrenoceptor numbers or binding affinity was observed in lungs removed from Paf-treated animals in comparison with those from vehicle-treated animals, or after direct incubation with Paf in vitro. The reduced bronchodilator responsiveness to isoprenaline in Paf-treated animals is not related to changes in pulmonary beta-adrenoceptor function. These results suggest that non-spasmogenic elements may contribute to airways obstruction induced in hyper-responsive animals.", 
    "36": "Treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (fibroblasts) with 250 nM dexamethasone for 48 hr caused a doubling of total beta-adrenergic receptors and an increase in beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtype proportion from approximately 50% in controls to 85% in treated cells. The responses to epinephrine and norepinephrine in a whole cell cAMP accumulation assay reflected these changes. The effects of dexamethasone on beta-adrenergic receptors were mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor and were time and dose dependent with an EC50 of 2.77 +/- 0.73 nM for an increase in the proportion of beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The rank order of potency of steroids to effect these changes (betamethasone = dexamethasone greater than fludrocortisone greater than hydrocortisone = triamcinolone greater than aldosterone) correlated with their glucocorticoid potency. [3H]Dexamethasone binding to intact cells yielded a KD value of 3.47 +/- 0.38 nM for binding to the glucocorticoid receptor which correlated well with the EC50 for dexamethasone to alter beta-adrenergic receptors. Inhibition of [3H]dexamethasone binding by other steroids confirmed that the ability of steroids to regulate beta-adrenergic receptors correlated with the affinity of each compound for the 3T3-L1 glucocorticoid receptor. Progesterone, which can bind to the glucocorticoid receptor but has only weak agonist activity, competitively inhibited the ability of dexamethasone to alter beta-adrenergic receptors. Protein synthesis, RNA synthesis, and N-linked glycosylation appeared to be necessary for the change in receptor subtype expression and the increase in beta-adrenergic receptor number induced by dexamethasone. The present study suggests that regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid-specific effect which may require gene activation.", 
    "37": "The ability of dopamine, ibopamine and epinine to elicit alpha adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction was studied in the in situ, autoperfused pulmonary circulation of the open-chest anesthetized dog. Animals were pretreated with propranolol to eliminate beta adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of the pulmonary vasculature. Heparinized blood was withdrawn from the left femoral artery and transferred via a peristaltic pump to the pulmonary arterial branch supplying the left diaphragmatic lobe of the lung. The flow rate of the pump was adjusted so that mean pulmonary perfusion pressure in the lobe was equal to resting diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (10 +/- 1 mm Hg). Under conditions of constant left atrial pressure and pulmonary blood flow, intralobar administration of dopamine, ibopamine and epinine elicited dose-dependent increases in perfusion pressure of the lobe, reflecting increases in pulmonary vascular resistance. Prazosin (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited the pulmonary vasopressor responses to dopamine, ibopamine and epinine. Rauwolscine (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited pulmonary pressor responses to dopamine and epinine without altering significantly the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to ibopamine. These data indicate that dopamine and epinine stimulate both postjunctional vascular alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors to elicit pulmonary vasoconstriction in the dog, whereas ibopamine, when injected directly into the pulmonary circulation, stimulates primarily postjunctional vascular alpha-1 adrenoceptors. However, when ibopamine was administered intraduodenally, both prazosin and rauwolscine were found to inhibit the resulting pulmonary vasopressor response. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that ibopamine is converted to its active metabolite epinine, which stimulates both pulmonary vascular alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "On isolated strips of human saphenous vein, pretreated with 5 microM phenoxybenzamine and contracted with 10 mM KCl, the beta adrenoceptor mediating the relaxant effects of isoproterenol, procaterol and norepinephrine was characterized using the selective beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, bisoprolol, and the selective beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551. All three agonists produced concentration-dependent relaxations of the isolated saphenous vein with an order of potency: procaterol (pD2 value, 7.69) greater than isoproterenol (pD2 value, 7.41) much greater than norepinephrine (pD2 value, 5.30). ICI 118,551 (3 X 10(-10) to 3 X 10(-9) M) was nearly 100 times more potent than bisoprolol (10(-7) to 10(-6) M) in antagonizing the relaxant effects of isoproterenol and procaterol. The slopes of the Schild plots for the antagonistic effects of ICI 118,551 and bisoprolol against isoproterenol- and procaterol-induced relaxations were not significantly different from unity indicating interaction with a homogeneous population of beta adrenoceptors. The pA2 value for ICI 118,551 amounted to 9.11 to 9.20 and for bisoprolol to 6.50 to 6.63. In addition, the concentration-response curve for the relaxant effect of norepinephrine was significantly shifted to the right by 10(-9) M ICI 118,551, but not affected by 10(-7) M bisoprolol. These results indicate that on the isolated strips of the human saphenous vein the beta adrenoceptor mediating relaxation is of the beta-2 subtype.", 
    "39": "The effects of fengabine (a novel benzylidene derivative possessing clinically demonstrated antidepressant action) on neurochemical parameters related to norepinephrine, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons have been investigated in the rat and mouse brain. When given acutely, fengabine (50-1000 mg/kg i.p.) does not alter norepinephrine uptake but accelerates the turnover rate of norepinephrine in the rat brain as demonstrated by the enhancement of: the alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine-induced disappearance of norepinephrine in the hypothalamus; 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels in noradrenergic cell body areas; the pargyline-induced accumulation of normetanephrine in the hypothalamus; and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol levels in the hypothalamus, septum and spinal cord. No tolerance to the effect of fengabine on the latter biochemical parameter was observed after repeated treatment for 2 weeks at doses of 100 or 200 mg/kg i.p., b.i.d. Fengabine (100 or 200 mg/kg i.p., b.i.d.), given for 14 days, causes a desensitization of isoprenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase in septal and cortical slices of the rat but fails to modify cortical beta, alpha-1 or alpha-2 adrenoceptor binding sites. Fengabine (up to 400 mg/kg i.p.) has no effect on rat cerebral serotonin uptake, synthesis or metabolism. Moreover, when given subacutely (100 or 200 mg/kg i.p., b.i.d. for 2 weeks), it fails to alter rat cortical serotonine receptors or [3H]imipramine binding sites. Fengabine (up to 50-100 microM) is also inactive in vitro on [3H] GABA binding to GABAA or GABAB receptors in the rat brain or on GABA transaminase activity in the mouse brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "Repeated administration of the centrally acting beta adrenoceptor agonist, clenbuterol, to rats reduced the ability of isoproterenol to increase the concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in slices of cerebellum. This reduced responsiveness to isoproterenol was accompanied by a marked reduction in the density of beta adrenoceptors as measured by the binding of the beta adrenoceptor antagonist [125I]iodopindolol. In addition, the agonist-binding properties of remaining cerebellar beta adrenoceptors were altered after clenbuterol treatment. The clenbuterol-induced reduction in the density of beta adrenoceptors in the cerebellum is in marked contrast to its inability to do this in cerebral cortex. Comparison of the ability of clenbuterol to that of isoproterenol to increase levels of cAMP in slices of cerebral cortex or cerebellum showed that clenbuterol is a weakly potent agonist in both brain regions. The increase in cAMP induced by isoproterenol in the cortex was significantly reduced in the presence of the selective beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 89,406. In contrast, the clenbuterol-induced increase in cortical cAMP was unchanged by ICI 89,406 but was reduced significantly by the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551. In cerebellum, both isoproterenol- and clenbuterol-stimulated accumulation of cAMP were antagonized much more potently by ICI 118,551 than by ICI 89,406. Furthermore, clenbuterol antagonized the cAMP response induced by isoproterenol in the presence of ICI 118,551 in a concentration-dependent manner. In terms of measurement of cAMP in brain slices, clenbuterol is weakly potent as an agonist at beta-2 adrenoceptors and has antagonist properties at beta-1 adrenoceptors.", 
    "41": "Two series of bivalent ligands (P-X-P) containing the (R,S)-3-[(4-aminoaryl)oxy]-1-(isopropylamino)propan-2-ol pharmacophore and a connecting alpha,omega-dicarbonylpoly(methylene) [X = -OC(CH2)nCO-] or alpha,omega-N,N'-bis(carbonylmethylene) polymethylenediamine [X = -OCCH2NH(CH2)nNHCH2CO-] spanner were synthesized and evaluated for beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity in rat heart and lung membrane preparations. The target compounds were obtained as a mixture of stereoisomers in modest yields by using a three to four step sequence beginning with N-benzylpractolol. The results from the competitive binding studies indicated that binding affinity increased by a factor of up to 160 by increasing the length of the group spanning the pharmacophore moieties. Modest increases in cardioselectivity were also obtained. The data suggest that further increases in spanner length and lipophilicity and optical resolution may improve the potential of a labeled bivalent beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist to function as a myocardial imaging agent.", 
    "42": "The beta-adrenergic and glucagon receptor-binding capacities in rat livers from 6-27 months of age were measured to investigate the mechanism of a previously observed rise in beta-adrenergic stimulated adenylate cyclase with increasing age. There was no concomitant increase in glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase. In the present study neither glucagon-binding capacity nor glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase changed with age. In contrast, the beta-adrenergic receptor capacity, measured in the same membranes by [125I]iodopindolol binding, increased nearly 3-fold from 6.6 +/- 0.6 fmol/mg at 6 months to 19.1 +/- 3.3 fmol/mg at 18-19 months. The increase was directly proportional to the maximum isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in livers of rats up to 19 months of age. By 24-27 months the binding capacity had increased to 24.9 +/- 3.3 fmol/mg, but there was no further increase in adenylate cyclase activity. Thus, there appeared to be a beta-receptor-adenylate cyclase uncoupling in livers from the senescent animals (25-27 months). The defect could not be demonstrated by studies examining isoproterenol competition of [125I]iodopindolol from agonist-induced high affinity sites on the membranes, a procedure that examines receptor-Ns protein coupling. Activation of adenylate cyclase by the nonhormonal stimulators F- and forskolin did not change with age, indicating that the catalytic unit was not a limiting factor. Since the relationship between the glucagon receptor and adenylate cyclase also remained unaltered, the uncoupling apparently lies in an alteration of the interaction between the beta-adrenergic receptor and the guanine nucleotide-sensitive Ns protein.", 
    "43": "We compared the effects of acute stimulation of sympathetic activity by dynamic exercise on a bicycle on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density and 10 mumol/L (-)-isoprenaline-evoked lymphocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate increases in normotensive volunteers with those in patients with essential hypertension. In normotensive subjects exercise increased lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors by about 100%. This effect seems to be a beta 2-dependent process, since it is prevented by propranolol (5 mg administered intravenously) and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 (25 mg t.i.d. orally for 2 weeks) but not by the beta 1-selective antagonist bisoprolol (2.5 mg administered intravenously). In patients with essential hypertension who have elevated lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors, dynamic exercise caused only marginal beta 2-adrenoceptor changes, suggesting an impairment of the acute beta-adrenoceptor regulation. Normalization of blood pressure by antihypertensive treatment resulted in a significant fall in lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors and in a restoration of exercise-induced beta 2-adrenoceptor increases. It is concluded that in essential hypertension the impairment of beta-adrenoceptor regulation is directly linked to the elevated blood pressure.", 
    "44": "Delta sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) has been isolated and characterized by its capacity to enhance delta sleep in rabbits. Up to now, sleep was the main target of DSIP research, but different extra-sleep effects of the peptide have been reported as well. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed, though no convincing evidence for any of them has been obtained so far. We recently detected that DSIP reduced the nocturnal increase of N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in rat pineal in a dose-dependent manner. The activity of this enzyme is known to be induced by adrenergic agonists and several studies have suggested that stimulation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors potentiates the \"basic\" effect of beta-receptors. DSIP in the range between 20 and 300 nM significantly enhanced NAT activity induced by 10(-6) M norepinephrine in vitro, and a similar effect was observed with 2nMP-DSIP, a phosphorylated analog. Incubation with prazosin eliminated the enhancement, whereas propranolol reduced norepinephrine stimulation that was still increased by P-DSIP and probably DSIP. It was concluded that the sleep-peptide and its analog modulate the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor of rat pineal in its response to adrenergic agonists. The same mechanism may also be responsible for other biological activities of DSIP such as sleep-induction and stress-tolerance.", 
    "45": "Using ligand binding techniques, we studied beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in brains obtained at autopsy from seven histologically normal controls and seven histopathologically verified cases with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD). Inhibition of [3H]dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]DHA) binding by the selective beta 1 antagonist, metoprolol, results in nonlinear Hofstee plots, suggesting the presence of the two receptor subtypes in the human brain. The calculated ratios of beta 1/beta 2-adrenergic receptors in control brains are as follows: frontal cortex, 49:51; temporal cortex, 31:69; hippocampus, 66:34; thalamus, 23:77; putamen, 70:30; caudate, 48:52; nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM), 43:57; cerebellar hemisphere, 25:75. Compared with the controls, total concentrations of beta-adrenergic receptors were significantly reduced only in the thalamus of the ATD brains. beta 1-Adrenergic receptor concentrations were significantly reduced in the hippocampus and increased in the NbM and cerebellar hemisphere, whereas beta 2-adrenergic receptor concentrations were significantly reduced in the thalamus, NbM, and cerebellar hemisphere and increased in the hippocampus and putamen of the ATD brains. These results suggest that beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors are present in the human brain and that there are significant changes in both receptor subtypes in selected brain regions in patients with ATD.", 
    "46": "The phosphorylation of specific proteins in pineal homogenate was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Cyclic AMP had the capacity to stimulate in a dose-dependent manner the incorporation of 32P in protein bands of apparent molecular weights 59K, 56K, and 35K with a maximal effect at 1 microM. On the other hand, calcium alone did not induce a marked increase in 32P incorporation with the exception of a dose-dependent phosphorylation of a 46K protein with a peak effect at 0.2 mM calcium concentration. The addition of exogenous calmodulin enhanced 32P incorporation in proteins migrating in the 62K and 52K regions, an effect that was antagonized by the calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperazine. However, also under these conditions, the stimulation of pineal protein phosphorylation was rather weak compared to that observed in other brain areas. In an attempt to investigate the functional changes of these biochemical processes during environmental lighting and adrenergic stimulation, it was found that the administration of (-)-isoproterenol (5 mg/kg, s.c.), a beta-receptor agonist, induced a clear-cut enhancement of 32P incorporation into the cyclic AMP-sensitive 59K and 56K proteins only in animals exposed for 18 h to the light, whereas it was almost ineffective in those kept in the dark for the same period. This effect was antagonized by (-)-propranolol pretreatment (20 mg/kg), suggesting that the changes in cyclic AMP-dependent protein phosphorylation observed in supersensitive pineals may represent a beta-receptor mediated process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "The effects of alpha 2-adrenergic-receptor blocker mianserin on the responses of blood glucose, plasma beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), and various counterregulatory hormones to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were studied in nine healthy male subjects. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor-blocking action of mianserin was confirmed by its inhibitory effect on platelet activation in vitro. Mianserin was given orally 90 min before insulin injection; the same study without mianserin was performed on another day as the control study. The time courses of blood glucose and serum C-peptide (0, 20, 45, and 180 min after the insulin injection) were identical in both studies, indicating that mianserin has no effect on these parameters. However, a significant increase of beta-TG at 45 min after insulin injection was completely suppressed by the administration of mianserin (mean +/- SE, 68.5 +/- 6.0 vs. 28.8 +/- 7.6 ng/ml, n = 6, P less than .05). No significant differences were obtained between the two studies in the responses of plasma or serum catecholamines, cortisol, glucagon, growth hormone, thromboxane B2, and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha. These results suggest that epinephrine is responsible for some, if not all, of the beta-TG release from the platelets during insulin-induced hypoglycemia.", 
    "48": "This study was undertaken to clarify whether antihypertensive treatment has any effect on the rate of progression of kidney disease in patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy. Six insulin-dependent diabetic men with incipient nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion above 15 micrograms/min and total protein excretion below 0.5 g/24 h) were first given metoprolol (200 mg daily) with the subsequent addition of hydroflumethiazide. At the start of antihypertensive treatment, mean patient age was 32 +/- 4.2 years (SD) and mean duration of diabetes was 18 +/- 1.2 years. The patients were followed with repeated measurements of urinary albumin excretion for a mean of 5.4 +/- 3.1 years prior to, and for 4.7 +/- 1.3 years (SD) during treatment. Mean arterial blood pressure declined significantly during treatment, e.g., the values at 6 months before initiation of treatment being compared with values during the last 6 months of treatment fell from 107 mmHg +/- 7.6 to 93 +/- 3.8 (2p = 1.5%). Albumin excretion decreased from 131.0 micrograms/min X/divided by 2.9 (geometric mean X/divided by tolerance factor) to 41.7 micrograms/min X/divided by 2.9 (2p = 1.2%). Albumin clearance in per cent of glomerular filtration rate decreased from a mean of 0.0030 +/- 0.0019% (SD) to 0.0011 +/- 0.0010% (2p = 4.6%). The mean yearly increase in urinary albumin excretion before treatment was 18.0 +/- 17.0% (mean +/- SD); during treatment urinary albumin excretion decreased 19 +/- 10% per year (2p = 0.7%). No changes were seen in renal plasma flow (516 +/- 31.0 ml/min to 520 +/- 66 ml/min (n = 5)).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "The renal vascular effects of dopaminomimetics and dopaminolytics were studied in the isolated perfused rat kidney after pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (10(-5) M) and sotalol (10(-5) M) and after contraction of the vascular bed with prostaglandin F2 alpha. The DA1- and D1-selective antagonist, SCH 23390, antagonized competitively the relaxation induced by dopamine (pA2 = 9.7 +/- 0.08, m +/- S.D.). On the other hand, (+/-)-DO 710, a D2-preferential benzamide, only antagonized the renal vascular response to dopamine at a concentration 30 times higher than that active on D2 receptors. The ergot derivative, quinpirole, a selective agonist for DA2 and D2 receptors had no renal vascular dopaminomimetic activity, whereas (-)-EOE, a D2-selective ergoline, seemed to be a partial agonist, but 10 times less potent than dopamine. These results confirm the existence of DA1 receptors on the vascular bed of isolated rat kidney but rule out the presence of DA2 receptors. They also reinforce the analogy between DA1 and D1 dopamine receptors.", 
    "50": "Bucindolol is an investigational beta-adrenergic blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic and vasodilatory activity in animals. In a double-blind, six-way, crossover study of six mild-to-moderate hypertensive men, the effects of bucindolol 100, 200, and 300 mg/d on resting blood pressure, heart rate, forearm blood flow, and vascular resistance measured by pneumoplethysmography, and blood pressure and heart rate after cycle and handgrip exercise were compared with those of propranolol 160 and 320 mg/d and placebo after q12h administration for five doses. Both bucindolol and propranolol significantly suppressed heart rate after cycle exercise in comparison with placebo (-33 to -48 beats/min), demonstrating beta blockade. Suppression of resting heart rate by propranolol (-20 beats/min) was significantly (P less than .05) greater than bucindolol (-7 to -8 beats/min); a similar treatment difference in heart rate was noted after handgrip exercise (-18 to -19 vs -1 to -8 beats/min, respectively). Bucindolol and propranolol decreased resting blood pressure to the same extent (in comparison with placebo; P less than .05 at peak activity, 2 hr postdose). Bucindolol tended to increase forearm blood flow and decrease forearm vascular resistance (P less than .05 at 4 hr postdose) in comparison with placebo. The effect of propranolol on forearm blood flow and forearm vascular resistance was not significant compared with placebo. These data are consistent with intrinsic sympathomimetic and vasodilatory activity of bucindolol in hypertensive men.", 
    "51": "The bioavailability of bevantolol was compared in 12 healthy volunteers given single doses of the drug as the HCl salt after an overnight fast, or 15 minutes before or after a standardized breakfast in a nonblind, randomized crossover design. Bevantolol was rapidly absorbed in all three treatment groups, with maximum concentrations (Cmax) observed at 1.0, 0.9, and 1.8 hours for the fasting, before breakfast, and after breakfast groups, respectively. Time to Cmax was significantly longer than fasting only when bevantolol was given after breakfast. Food ingestion did not significantly affect Cmax, total of absorbed drug, or the drug elimination rate. Since food only slightly decreases the drug absorption rate and has no measurable effect on the extent of drug absorption, the relationship of bevantolol administration to meals is not expected to influence therapeutic efficacy.", 
    "52": "Experiments were performed on canine and human isolated coronary arteries to characterise human coronary beta adrenoceptors and to determine whether or not beta blocking agents with different ancillary properties unmask the alpha adrenergic effect of noradrenaline in a similar way. The inhibitory effects of atenolol (a beta1 selective antagonist), epanolol (a beta1 selective antagonist with modest intrinsic sympathetic activity), and propranolol (a non-selective antagonist) were assessed on isoproterenol concentration-response curves. Regression analysis provided slopes not significantly different from unity and similar pA2 values for each agent in both preparations. In a second group of experiments, the effects of noradrenaline (10 mumol.litre-1) were assessed in the absence and presence of beta blockade. At equipotent doses (1 log or 2 log units from the pA2 values) each beta blocking agent unmasked the alpha effect of noradrenaline in the same way. This alpha effect of noradrenaline (10 mumol.litre-1) was completely abolished by prazosin 1 mumol.litre-1 in canine coronary arteries but only partially antagonised in human coronary arteries. Thus the property of a beta blocking agent to unmask the alpha adrenergic effect of adrenaline is mainly related to its affinity for the coronary smooth muscle beta adrenoceptors. These beta adrenoceptors were very similar in both preparations and appear to be mainly beta1. The alpha adrenoceptors seem, nevertheless, to be different and resistant to prazosin in human preparations.", 
    "53": "In view of their effectiveness and safety, beta-blockers and diuretics have become first-line drugs in the treatment of arterial hypertension. Several studies performed over the last few years have elicited undesirable effects of these drugs on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. These changes probably have the same significance as regards the arterial risk as primary or secondary alterations of lipoproteins. In contrast, vasodilators acting by alpha-blockade probably have a favourable effect on lipid metabolism. It therefore seems reasonable, whenever these drugs are prescribed, to carry out regular evaluations of plasma lipids, notably in young subjects to identify those who partly lose the benefit of this treatment owing to a significant degradation of their blood lipid profile. Future epidemiological studies and therapeutic trials should show whether this attitude is right or wrong, their primary objective being to answer the question: do some anti-hypertensive drugs increase, in some subjects, the coronary risk?",

We have investigated whether such effects could be observed in a general population in which these drugs are often prescribed. This population was divided into three groups: subjects with normal blood pressure, subjects with unrecognized arterial hypertension and subjects receiving an anti-hypertensive treatment. Treatment with beta-blockers of obese hypertensive patients was attended by unfavourable changes identical with those observed in a general population under the most common anti-hypertensive therapy.",

However, as in any retrospective study, the opportunities for bias to distort the results are widespread. Attempts must be made to introduce the controls found in prospective studies by blinding the selection of papers and extraction of data and making blinded duplicate determinations. Informal and personalized methods of obtaining data are probably more liable to error and bias than employing only published data. Publication bias is a serious problem requiring further research. There also need to be more comparisons of meta-analysed small studies with large co-operative trials.",

Among the etiologies, traumatic causes are first considered without forgetting nervous, visceral and drug induced causes.

    "57": "The antagonistic potency, pA2, of several non-selective beta-antagonists on presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors was evaluated using a parallel line assay and MacKay's equation against isoproterenol-induced increases in 3H release in isolated guinea-pig pulmonary arteries preloaded with 3H-norepinephrine. Cumulatively applied isoproterenol at 10(-9) M, 10(-8) M and 10(-7) M dose-dependently increased 3H release evoked by transmural field stimulation at 1 Hz. beta-Antagonists tested dose-dependently antagonized the isoproterenol-induced increases. The order of pA2 was carteolol (11.23 +/- 0.09) greater than nadolol (9.78 +/- 0.05) greater than pindolol (9.59 +/- 0.03) greater than propranolol (9.26 +/- 0.17).

Selectol; in the following briefly called celiprolol) were investigated over an interval of 30 min in 15 patients with angiographically determined coronary heart disease and depressed left ventricular function (ejection fraction less than 60%, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) greater than 12 mmHg). One patient suffered from severe left ventricular failure with lung edema and could not be evaluated. The heart rate was not influenced, the arterial pressure was significantly reduced (p less than 0.01), similarly LVEDP (p less than 0.001), and pulmonary pressure (p less than 0.01). Cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were not changed significantly. The hemodynamic working profile of celiprolol in patients with depressed left ventricular function is that of a beta 1-receptor blocker with a strong intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA = Intrinsic Sympathetic Activity) and vasodilating properties--even on preload. The intravenous application of celiprolol in patients with severely depressed left ventricular function can cause pump failure.", 
    "59": "Experiments were designed to unravel the relative contribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors to the positive inotropic effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline in isolated tissues of left ventricular myocardium of man. We also analyzed relationships between the fractions of human left ventricular beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, estimated from binding assays, and stimulation of adenylate cyclase and contractile force by adrenaline and noradrenaline. Selective blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors by erythro-(+/-)-(alpha-methyl-indan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminobuta n-2-ol (ICI 118,551) attenuated the increase of contractile force caused by adrenaline but not by noradrenaline, suggesting some involvement of beta 2-adrenoceptors. Selective blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors without affecting beta 1-adrenoceptors still enabled both adrenaline and noradrenaline to cause maximum possible increases of contractile force through beta 1-adrenoceptors. A direct involvement of beta 2-adrenoceptors became manifest by selectively antagonizing beta 1-adrenoceptors by 1-[2[3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxy)phenoxy)ethylamino]- 3-[4(1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)phenoxy]-2-propanol (CGP 20712 A) without affecting beta 2-adrenoceptor. beta 2-adrenoceptors can mediate half of the maximum increase of contractile force elicited by low concentrations of adrenaline and also contribute to the increase of contractile force caused by high concentrations of noradrenaline. beta-adrenoceptors were labelled in membrane particles with 3H-(-)-bupranolol in the absence (beta 1 & beta 2) and presence of 500 nmol/l CGP 20712 A (beta 2). 71% of the beta-adrenoceptors were beta 1 and 29% beta 2.

    "60": "The arrhythmogenic mechanism in dogs with hypokalemia was investigated in relation to the effects of an alpha 1-blocking agent and a beta-blocking agent. Hypokalemia was induced by inserting an ion-exchange resin into the colon. In the hypokalemia group, nine out of 17 dogs with arrhythmia ratios of over 10% (that is the percentage of the number of ventricular ectopic beats divided by the total number of heart beats during 5 min, after 10 micrograms/kg of epinephrine injection) were observed. In the control group (n = 13), which maintained normal serum K+ levels, only one dog showed an arrhythmia ratio of over 10%. Dogs with lower serum K+ levels showed higher arrhythmia ratios. The Ca2+ content of heart mitochondria, considered to be a reflection of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, was 24.4 +/- 5.7 nmoles/mg protein in the control group 5 min after epinephrine injection, while that of the hypokalemia group was increased to 35.0 +/- 13.4. A good reciprocal correlation between the concentration of serum K+ just before epinephrine injection and mitochondrial Ca2+ content was observed in the hypokalemia group (r = -0.79), while in the control group, no correlation was observed. Clear correlation between mitochondrial Ca2+ content and the arrhythmia ratio was also observed in the propranolol group. Pretreatment with bunazosin, an alpha 1-\"blocker,\" effectively prevented the increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ content, and reduced the arrhythmia ratio. On the other hand, pretreatment with propranolol, a beta-\"blocker,\" did not affect the mitochondrial Ca2+ content and the arrhythmia ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "The characteristics and control of the increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) during environmental heating (EH) were determined in 12 unanesthetized, chronically catheterized baboons. Each EH experiment consisted of a 1.5- to 4-h exposure to an ambient temperature of 39-44 degrees C until core temperature (Tc) reached 39.5-40.0 degrees C. These EH experiments were done on the baboon in an unblocked state and during beta-adrenergic receptor blockade produced by propranolol when on normal-to-high salt intake (NHSI) and on low-salt intake (LSI). PRA rose linearly with Tc during EH, but the increase in PRA was considerably larger when the baboon was on LSI. The PRA-Tc linear regression coefficients were 2.32 and 5.98 ng angiotensin I X ml-1 X h-1 X degrees C-1 in NHSI and LSI states, respectively. This rise in PRA during EH was completely eliminated during beta-blockade in both NHSI and LSI states. It is concluded that heat stress activates the sympathetic nervous system to stimulate beta-receptor-mediated renin secretion by the kidney, this activation is controlled primarily by internal thermoreceptors, and variations in salt intake alters only the magnitude of the increase in PRA during heat stress, not the mechanisms that produce it.", 
    "62": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the adrenergic receptors on the distribution of blood flow within and among skeletal muscles in rats. Blood flow was measured with the radiolabeled microsphere technique before exercise and during treadmill exercise at 15 or 60 m/min. Alpha- (phentolamine) or beta- (propranolol) adrenergic blocking drugs were administered, and then blood flow was measured and results compared with those from saline-treated rats. Before exercise, alpha-blockade caused increases in total muscle blood flow and in all fast-twitch muscles, whereas muscles composed of greater than 20% slow-twitch fibers showed no effect. During exercise at 15 m/min, the normal increase in total muscle blood flow was attenuated by alpha-blockade. Compared with controls, blood flow was less in the high-oxidative (fast and slow) muscle fiber areas of extensor muscles, whereas blood flow to white areas of extensor muscles was increased. beta-Blockade tended to decrease muscle blood flow before exercise and during exercise at 15 m/min with no apparent relationship between the effects of blockade on blood flow and muscle fiber type. These effects of beta-blockade were not apparent during exercise at 60 m/min. We conclude that before exercise alpha-receptor effects are limited to fast muscle, whereas beta-receptor influences are independent of fiber type, beta-receptors contribute to the initial hyperemia of exercise at 15 m/min, and beta-receptor influence is inversely related to metabolic rate.", 
    "63": "To resolve conflicting reports concerning the effects of beta-blockade (BB) on thermoregulatory reflexes during exercise, we studied six fit men during 40 min of cycle ergometer exercise at 60% maximum O2 consumption at ambient temperatures of 22 and 32 degrees C. Two hours before exercise, each subject ingested a capsule containing either 80 mg of propranolol or placebo in single-blind fashion. Heart rate at 40 min of exercise was reduced (P less than 0.01) from 125 to 103 beats min at 22 degrees C and 137 to 104 beats min at 32 degrees C, demonstrating effective BB. After 40 min of exercise, esophageal temperature (Tes) was elevated with BB (P less than 0.05) from 37.66 +/- 0.04 to 38.14 +/- 0.03 and 38.13 +/- 0.04 to 38.41 +/- 0.04 degrees C at 22 and 32 degrees C, respectively. The elevated Tes resulted from a reduced core-to-skin heat flux at both temperatures, indicated by a reduction in the slope of the forearm blood flow (FBF)-Tes relationship, and a decrease in maximal FBF. Systolic blood pressure was decreased 20 mmHg with BB (P less than 0.01), whereas diastolic blood pressure was unchanged, reducing arterial pulse pressure (PP). Because PP was decreased and cardiac filling pressure was presumably not reduced (since cardiac stroke volume was elevated), we suggest that at least a part of the relative increase in peripheral vasomotor tone during BB was the consequence of reduced sinoaortic baroreceptor stimulation.", 
    "64": "Human retinal pigment epithelial cells in culture demonstrate adenylate cyclase activity. It is membrane-bound and modulated by GTP regulatory proteins. It is effectively activated only by beta-adrenergic agonists (L-isoproterenol greater than or equal to L-epinephrine greater than L-norepinephrine) and some prostaglandins (PGE1 and PGE2, but not PGF1 alpha). The adrenergic response appears to be mediated by beta-2 receptors. No inhibitory ligands could be demonstrated. Its characteristics, which are similar to functional adenylate cyclase complexes in other mammalian cells, and its selective and sensitive agonist responsiveness, suggest a possible physiologic role in the regulation of human retinal pigment epithelial-cell function.", 
    "65": "Esmolol is a relatively cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. Since esmolol is rapidly metabolised by blood-borne esterases, it has a very short half-life (about 9 mins) and a short duration of action. In this respect esmolol is unique amongst currently available beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and it is anticipated that it will be particularly useful in critical care situations where administration by continuous intravenous infusion should permit a level of control over beta-adrenoceptor antagonism that has previously been unattainable. In perioperative settings, esmolol attenuates tachycardia induced by a variety of surgical stimuli such as endotracheal intubation, sternotomy and aortic dissection, suggesting a clinical use of the drug to prevent potentially serious complications in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease. Additionally, clinical studies have shown that titrated dosages of esmolol achieved therapeutic response rates of 66 to 79% in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, which favourably compared with response rates achieved with propranolol. In most of these patients esmolol produced a reduction in ventricular rate which was well maintained during infusion but disappeared within 30 minutes following esmolol withdrawal. Preliminary studies involving small numbers of patients have reported that esmolol exerts significant antihypertensive effects in patients with postoperative hypertension, and beneficial effects in patients with myocardial ischaemia and infarction, but support for these results is required from additional large, well-controlled studies. Esmolol has been generally well tolerated, and although hypotension has occurred in up to 44% of patients it resolved during or soon after the infusion of esmolol. Thus, esmolol is the first titratable beta-adrenoceptor antagonist able to be rapidly 'switched on' and 'off', a property that is expected to offer a major contribution to safety in critical care patients requiring beta-adrenoceptor antagonism for short durations.", 
    "66": "It has been observed that repeated and prolonged beta-agonist treatment causes the impairment of beta-adrenergic function, so-called \"desensitization\" or \"down regulation\". To clarify the mechanism of down regulation, the following experiment was performed using guinea pig lungs. Animals were divided into four groups: In the metaproterenol groups, guinea pigs were treated with metaproterenol (10 mg/kg/day) by intraperitoneal injection once a day for 1 day or for 7 successive days In the control groups, guinea pigs were treated with saline by the same procedure as in the metaproterenol groups. In the group treated with metaproterenol for 7 days, there was a 45% reduction in the number of beta-adrenoceptors and a 62% reduction in adenylate cyclase activity, compared with those of the control group. However, there were no significant changes in the dissociation constant (Kd) of the receptors. On the other hand, no reduction in the number of beta-adrenoceptors and adenylate cyclase activity was observed in the group treated with metaproterenol once a day for 1 day, compared with those of the control group. Phospholipase (PLase) activity in the lung microsomes of guinea pigs injected with metaproterenol for 1 day and for 7 days was elevated by 14.4 and 33.1%, respectively, compared with that of the control groups. Phospholipid contents of lung membranes prepared from the animals treated with metaproterenol for 7 days were significantly decreased compared with those of the control group, though in the group treated with metaproterenol once a day for 1 day, phospholipid contents did not differ from those of the control. Lung membranes treated with PLase A2 revealed decreases both in the number of beta-adrenoceptors and adenylate cyclase activity, dose dependently. These results and the fact that membrane phospholipids are involved in the beta-adrenoceptor system suggest that down regulation observed during beta-agonist administration is, at least in part, attributed to degradation of phospholipids of lung membranes by the persistent activation of PLase in the tissue.", 
    "67": "Prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated modulation of endogenous noradrenaline (NA) overflow elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation was studied in blood-perfused canine gracilis muscle in situ. An attempt was made to subclassify these beta-adrenoceptors by comparing the effects of beta 1-selective (metoprolol) and non-selective (propranolol) beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Animals were pre-treated with desipramine and phenoxybenzamine in order to counteract possible influences of neuronal uptake and stimulation-evoked changes in vascular resistance on the diffusion of NA into the blood stream. Metoprolol did not decrease stimulation-evoked NA overflow, as compared with control experiments (-10 and -8%, respectively). However, propranolol reduced stimulation-evoked NA overflow by 30% in metoprolol pre-treated animals (P less than 0.05 vs. control experiments). Both antagonists elevated basal perfusion pressure, suggesting that vascular post-junctional beta 1- as well as beta 2-adrenoceptors are present. Propranolol increased stimulation-evoked vasoconstriction in metoprolol pre-treated animals, indicating that neuronally released NA may activate postjunctional beta 2-adrenoceptors under these experimental conditions. In conclusion, our findings suggest that NA release can be enhanced by activation of prejunctional beta 2-adrenoceptors in vivo.", 
    "68": "In response to various stimuli, pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release is predominantly mediated by cholinergic mechanisms, and may be modulated by sympathetic and opiate (inhibitory) effects. However, the mechanisms regulating basal PP levels remain unclear. We examined the possible role of the sympathetic nervous system and endogenous opiates in the regulation of basal levels of pancreatic polypeptide in trained conscious dogs. During prolonged (150 min) alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine and propranolol, separately or in combination, there was no change in the basal PP levels of 154 +/- 20 pg/ml. Effective adrenergic modulation of pancreatic hormones was evident since alpha blockade led to a rise in insulin and glucagon, beta blockade led to a fall in insulin and glucagon, while combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade did not affect insulin or glucagon. Opiate blockade with naloxone (1.25 mg followed by 1 microgram/kg/min) led to a delayed fall in PP from 153 +/- 22 to 89 +/- 15 pg/ml at 90 min (no change by 30 min), without a change of insulin or glucagon. Infusion of a potent morphine analogue D-Met2-Pro5-enkephalinamide (0.5 microgram/kg/min) led to a sustained fall in PP to 91 +/- 8 pg/ml by 30 min without a change in insulin or glucagon. Somatostatin infusion (0.2 microgram/kg/min) with insulin and glucagon replacement, led to a similar sustained fall in PP. It is concluded that in dogs: in contrast to insulin and glucagon, at basal conditions the plasma level of PP is not modulated by endogenous alpha- or beta-adrenergic influences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "A technique of intrapericardial administration of beta-adrenoceptor and muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist drugs has been tested in conscious rabbits. Intrapericardial propranolol or atenolol (50 micrograms/kg) had the same effect on isoprenaline heart rate dose-response curves and on the sympathetic component of the arterial baroreceptor-heart rate reflex as did conventional, 5-fold greater, intravenous doses of the drugs. The action of intrapericardial propranolol was attributable to its (-)isomer. Intrapericardial propranolol (50 micrograms/kg) had little effect on ventricular contractility. Plasma levels of propranolol and atenolol after intrapericardial administration were, respectively, 7- and 40-fold less than after the usual intravenous doses. Intrapericardial hyoscine methyl bromide (10 micrograms/kg) abolished baroreflex vagal effects on heart rate as effectively as did the conventional, 5-fold greater, intravenous dose. The duration of receptor blockade by both classes of drugs when given intrapericardially was at least 2 hr. We conclude that the rapid diffusion of beta-adrenoceptor and muscarinic cholinergic receptor blocking drugs from the pericardial sac to receptors on the sinoatrial cardiac pacemaker, and their prolonged actions, provides a useful technique for preventing the actions of the sympathetic and vagus nerves, and of circulating catecholamines, on the chronotropic functions of the heart.", 
    "70": "An in vitro model to evaluate the role of endogenous noradrenaline in the beta-blocker withdrawal phenomenon is described: Beating chicken heart muscle cells (5000 beta 1-adrenoceptors/cell) and heart nonmuscle cells (3000 beta 2-adrenoceptors/cell) were cultured in serum-free, hormone-supplemented medium. Basal state, subtype selective down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors by endogenous noradrenaline (decrease in receptor number, beta 1 more than beta 2) was simulated by addition of noradrenaline to the culture medium; chronic beta-blockade was simulated by exposure of the cells for 3 days to various beta-blockers (propranolol, no ISA; timolol, slight ISA; pindolol, strong ISA). Beta-blocker withdrawal phenomenon--increased response in isoproterenol-induced cAMP production and positive inotropy--is correlated with the increase in the number of beta-adrenoceptors after withdrawal of the drugs. Propranolol induces a withdrawal phenomenon at every degree of noradrenaline-induced basal state down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors; in contrast, a withdrawal phenomenon by pindolol is only seen at a higher degree of beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation. In the presence of physiological noradrenaline concentrations pindolol affects beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in a qualitatively different manner: the number of beta 1-adrenoceptors is increased, the number of beta 2-adrenoceptors is decreased. This finding demonstrates that the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of nonselective beta-blockers can manifest itself only if the receptors are not strongly down-regulated. As beta 2-adrenoceptors are present in a much less down-regulated state than beta 1, ISA mainly acts on beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype, thus, presenting a beta 2-\"pseudo-selectivity\" of ISA.", 
    "71": "Concentration-response (contraction) curves to either adrenaline or noradrenaline were obtained on isolated ring preparations of pulmonary artery from rats. In preparations from young rats the curve for adrenaline was bell-shaped, unless beta-adrenoceptors were blocked with propranolol (1 X 10(-6) M). The maximum contraction to adrenaline was less in the absence than in the presence of propranolol. In preparations from aged rats the adrenaline curve was no longer bell-shaped, even in the absence of propranolol. This reflected a decrease in the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxant responses of preparations from aged rats, seen as a separation between the concentration-response (relaxation) curves to adrenaline on preparations (phenoxybenzamine-treated, KCl-contracted) from young and aged rats. In preparations from young rats the noradrenaline curve was not bell-shaped, but if the preparations were from young rats treated with thyroxine (T4), then a bell-shaped curve for noradrenaline was obtained, unless beta-adrenoceptors were blocked by propranolol. These data could be explained by an increase in beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxant responses of preparations from T4-treated rats, seen as a separation in the concentration-response (relaxation) curves to noradrenaline on preparations from control and T4-treated rats, respectively. Thus alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contractile responses of rat pulmonary artery preparations, to adrenaline or noradrenaline, can be attenuated by activation of beta-adrenoceptors, mediating relaxation, and the extent of this attenuation changes under the influence of factors, such as ageing or T4-treatment, which modify beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation in this blood vessel type.", 
    "72": "The influence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the free fatty acid (FFA) response during and after submaximal exercise was studied in a group of normal volunteers. The study showed that the exercise-induced rise in serum FFA concentrations seen with placebo was reduced after pretreatment with propranolol. Furthermore, the palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acid responses showed progressive attenuation with increasing doses of propranolol. Different beta blockers were studied using comparable doses: metoprolol and nadolol had little effect and produced FFA profiles that were similar to placebo whereas the changes on pindolol were comparable with those on propranolol.", 
    "73": "Beta-blockade is used increasingly in early acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but may cause congestive heart failure (CHF). It is not known whether Swan-Ganz catheterization is necessary before beta-blockade in AMI. We made a retrospective analysis of 213 patients who underwent Swan-Ganz catheterization within 24 hours of AMI and compared precatheter CHF signs (dyspnoea, lung crepitations and x-ray appearance) with initial pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP). One hundred nine of these patients received beta-blockade after catheterization, 31 did not tolerate beta-blockade. Absence of clinical CHF signs predicted a normal PAWP (less than or equal to 18 mmHg) in 86% of patients (42 of 49) and considerable safety in giving beta-blockade. Beta-blockade had to be stopped because of PAWP increase (greater than 5 mmHg) in 25 of 74 patients with CHF signs vs. 3 of 35 patients without CHF signs (p less than 0.005), and in 9 of 15 patients with high PAWP vs. 19 of 91 patients with normal PAWP (p less than 0.01). Only 2/28 patients (7%) intolerant to beta-blockade had a high PAWP but no clinical CHF. In conclusion hemodynamic intolerance to beta-blockade could have been predicted clinically without prior Swan-Ganz catheterization in 25/28 patients. Patients with CHF signs require catheterization if beta-blockade therapy is to be considered.", 
    "74": "Guinea-pig isolated trachealis muscle treated with hyoscine (1 microM) exhibited mechanical tone which could be suppressed by transmural stimulation and, in a concentration-dependent manner, by nicotine (10-1000 microM). Hexamethonium (500 microM) did not itself cause tone changes, antagonized effects of nicotine but did not antagonize those of isoprenaline. Tetrodotoxin (0.3 microM) did not itself cause tone changes, did not modify the action of isoprenaline but antagonized the effects of nicotine and very markedly reduced responses to transmural electrical stimulation. Guanethidine (50 microM) did not itself cause tone changes, potentiated the action of isoprenaline, antagonized effects of nicotine and reduced responses to transmural electrical stimulation. Propranolol (1 microM) did not itself cause tone changes, antagonized effects of both isoprenaline and nicotine and reduced responses to transmural electrical stimulation. Propranolol (10 microM) caused greater antagonism of isoprenaline but did not further antagonize nicotine or further reduce responses to electrical stimulation. Intracellular electrophysiological recording from hyoscine-treated trachealis showed that 10 microM nicotine caused little or no mechanical or electrical change. Higher concentrations (100 microM and 1 mM) evoked relaxation which was often though not invariably accompanied by transient hyperpolarization and transient inhibition of electrical slow waves in the impaled cell. Hexamethonium (500 microM), tetrodotoxin (0.3 microM), guanethidine (50 microM) and propranolol (1 microM) each suppressed the electrical or mechanical changes evoked by nicotine (100 microM). However, nicotine (1 mM) tested in the presence of propranolol (1 microM), caused relaxation which could be accompanied by slow wave suppression but not by change in resting membrane potential. Transmural stimulation of hyoscine-treated trachea with single pulses of supramaximal voltage and 0.5 ms duration evoked neither relaxation nor membrane potential changes. Stimulation with similar pulses in trains of 5 s duration evoked relaxation which was dependent on pulse frequency. In many cells this relaxation was not accompanied by membrane potential change. In other cells suppression of slow waves occurred. At high pulse frequencies (greater than 16 Hz) this was generally accompanied by membrane hyperpolarization. In tissue treated with hyoscine and propranolol (both 1 microM), transmural stimulation with pulse trains as described above always evoked relaxation but no membrane potential changes were observed. 10 It is concluded that nicotine and transmural stimulation can excite intramural noradrenergic nerves in guinea-pig trachea and thereby evoke relaxation. The membrane potential changes (slow wave suppression and hyperpolarization) are similar to those evoked by the administration of agonists at beta-adrenoceptors. Nicotine and transmural stimulation also excite non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory (NANCI) nerves. The relaxation evoked by the NANCI neurotransmitter is accompanied by little, if any, membrane potential change.", 
    "75": "Topical levobunolol 0.5% was compared with topical metipranolol 0.6% for efficacy, safety, and comfort in 46 patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The study was of parallel design, randomised, double-masked, and of three months' duration. After a washout interval the study medications were instilled twice daily in both eyes. The overall mean decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) was approximately 7 mmHg in both groups. More than 90% of patients in both groups successfully completed the study. Both agents caused slight decreases in heart rate and blood pressure. More complaints of burning and stinging were reported in the metipranolol group than in the levobunolol group. This three-month, 46-patient study showed levobunolol 0.5% and metipranolol 0.6% to be similarly effective ocular hypotensive agents.", 
    "76": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist H-I 42 BS were examined in healthy subjects. In an open dose ranging study, H-I 42 BS 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg were given as single oral doses to four subjects. H-I 42 BS 400 mg caused maximum reduction in exercise heart rate (20.4 +/- 1.0%--mean +/- s.d.) at 4 h and still reduced exercise heart rate at 96 h (18.4 +/- 7.2%). Seven subjects received in double-blind, randomised order, single oral doses of H-I 42 BS 50, 100 and 200 mg, atenolol 50 and 100 mg and placebo. H-I 42 BS 400 mg was given in a single blind manner as the last dose of the study. Both H-I 42 BS and atenolol reduced supine and standing heart rate and systolic blood pressure (P less than 0.05) although atenolol had the more marked effect. The maximum percent reduction of exercise heart rate after H-I 42 BS 50 mg was 10.9 +/- 7.1%, after 100 mg was 18.7 +/- 5.8%, after 200 mg was 20.6 +/- 6.4% and after 400 mg was 21.9 +/- 8.2%. H-I 42 BS 400 mg still caused 11.0 +/- 3.5% reduction at 168 h. Atenolol 50 mg caused maximum percent reduction of exercise heart rate of 26.0 +/- 6.0% but did not reduce exercise heart rate after 24 h. The mean peak plasma concentrations for all doses of H-I 42 BS occurred at 5.1 +/- 1.5 h. The plasma elimination half-life was 47.6 +/- 8.1 h. There was a linear correlation between the dose and AUC0-infinity (r = 0.97). The cardioselectivity of H-I 42 BS and atenolol was compared. Six subjects received in double-blind random order H-I 42 BS 100 and 400 mg, atenolol 50 mg and placebo. After each dose, graded infusions of isoprenaline were given until the heart rate increased by 50 beats min-1. Dose-response curves for heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, forearm blood flow and finger tremor were constructed. There was no difference in the dose-response curves for forearm blood flow or finger tremor after H-I 42 BS 400 mg or atenolol 50 mg. Atenolol 50 mg caused more attenuation (P less than 0.01) of the diastolic blood pressure response. These results indicate that H-I 42 BS is a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with a long duration of action in man.", 
    "77": "Eight diabetics with autonomic neuropathy were given single oral doses of epanolol (200 mg), atenolol (50 mg), pindolol (5 mg) and placebo in a double-blind randomised order at weekly intervals. Supine resting heart rate, physiological tremor and blood glucose were measured before, 2 and 4 h after dosing, and ambulatory heart rate monitored for 24 h. Supine resting heart rate was significantly lowered by atenolol both at 2 and 4 h, and increased on pindolol at 4 h. Heart rate was unaffected by epanolol compared with placebo. Heart rate during the 'waking' period (14.00-23.00 h) was lower than placebo after epanolol and atenolol but unaffected by pindolol. During the 'sleeping' period (23.00 h-08.00 h) heart rate was significantly increased by pindolol, lowered with atenolol and unaffected on epanolol. Pindolol significantly increased physiological tremor at 4 h. No differences were seen between epanolol, atenolol and placebo. Plasma glucose was significantly increased by pindolol 2 h after dosing. These results suggest that pindolol probably produces its partial agonist activity at both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, while the partial agonist activity of epanolol is beta 1-selective. Despite abnormal cardiovascular reflex tests in these diabetics, the heart rate responses obtained in this study after beta-adrenoceptor blockade were surprisingly normal, and suggest that the concept of 'cardiac denervation' in diabetes requires modification.", 
    "78": "Until recently beta-adrenergic blocking agents were considered contraindicated in peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). However, in recent years several studies have failed to show negative effects on peripheral blood flow. It was the aim of this study to compare the effects of celiprolol, a beta-1-adrenergic blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), and of metoprolol, a beta-1-adrenergic blocking agent without ISA, on peripheral blood flow of patients with and without PAOD. In an acute trial 24 patients (group I: 12 patients with PAOD stage I and II; group II: 12 patients without PAOD received a single dose of 200 mg celiprolol or 200 mg metoprolol in a double-blind crossover design. Celiprolol induced no significant changes in calf and skin blood flow at rest or during reactive hyperemia. Basal vascular resistance (BVR) and minimal vascular resistance (MVR) were not affected. Metoprolol, however, significantly reduced muscle blood flow and increased BVR in both groups. Subsequently the patients were treated in a randomized double-blind design with a daily dose of 200 mg celiprolol or metoprolol for three weeks. In long-term treatment skin and muscle blood flow at rest and during reactive hyperemia, BVR, and MVR were not affected by celiprolol. Metoprolol significantly lowered calf blood flow at rest in patients with PAOD; other parameters remained unchanged. In patients without PAOD, metoprolol caused a significant decrease of calf blood flow at rest and an increase of BVR. Calf blood flow during reactive hyperemia, as well as skin blood flow at rest and during reactive hyperemia, showed no significant changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "The 40 aminoacids residue of pancreatic growth hormone-releasing hormone stimulates the secretion of insulin, glucagon, an somatostatin from the pancreas. To determine whether this stimulation of islet hormone secretion is mediated via adrenergic or cholinergic receptor sites, we studied the effects of 30 nmol/l of the growth hormone-releasing hormone on the release of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin in the presence of either alpha-adrenergic (phentolamine), beta-adrenergic (propranolol) or cholinergic (atropine) blocking agents. The responses to the growth hormone-releasing hormone were not significantly modified by adrenergic or cholinergic blockers. The findings rule out an interaction with adrenergic and cholinergic receptors on islet cells. It is at present unknown whether the growth hormone-releasing hormone stimulates islet hormone secretion via an interaction with specific growth hormone-releasing hormone receptors or vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors.", 
    "80": "The present studies have tested the hypothesis that agonists at beta-adrenergic receptors activate the beta-receptors by reducing them. This was examined by analyzing the interactions of 41 beta-agonists and antagonists with the receptors. The structural features which determined binding affinity (KD) were shown to be distinct from those which determined intrinsic, activity (IA). The IA was shown to be related to the oxidation-reduction properties which were determined primarily by the nature of the substituents on the phenyl ring. Thus, the parent compound phenylethanolamine, having no phenolic substituent, acted as an antagonist (IA = 0) and was also redox inactive. All of the antagonists tested (19) exhibited EP (peak potential for the first oxidative wave) values greater than 0.75 V, suggesting that they were difficult to oxidize. Agonists, however, exhibited a wide range of EP (0.25-0.7 V) with values lower than those of the antagonists. The agonists tested include catecholamines, catecholamine analogs bearing meta-substituted amino functionalities (such as amino, methylamino, formanilide, sulfonamide, urea, and carbamate), resorcinol, and hydroxymethyl congeners. It is proposed that the oxidizing tendency of the substituent on the phenyl ring is one of the factors that influences IA. To test the hypothesis further, we electrolytically oxidized isoproterenol to adrenochrome or to the o-quinone intermediate and tested for activity. The 4e-, 4H+-oxidation product adrenochrome did not bind to or stimulate adenylate cyclase, suggesting that the reducing ability to isoproterenol is important for its agonistic activity. A cyclic redox mechanism for the action of agonists at beta-adrenergic receptors is presented. We propose that agonist are electron donors. Their interactions with receptors result in reduction leading to activation of the receptors.", 
    "81": "New England Deaconness Hospital rats harboring a transplantable pheochromocytoma exhibit plasma norepinephrine concentrations 20-fold higher than controls. A cardiomyopathy (CM) characterized by multifocal areas of interstitial and replacement fibrosis, mixed inflammatory infiltrates and contraction band necrosis is evident 35 to 45 days after tumor implantation. Using a morphological scoring system of 0 (no cardiac damage) to 3 (involvement of almost the complete ventricular cross-section sampled), a CM score of 1.8 +/- 0.1 was found in rats harboring pheochromocytoma, a significant increase over that in age- and sex-matched controls (0.4 +/- 0.1, P less than .001). The pheochromocytoma rats also had hypertension (systolic blood pressure = 182 +/- 4 vs. 131 +/- 2 mm Hg in controls, P less than .001). In an effort to prevent the CM, rats harboring pheochromocytoma were treated with either the beta receptor antagonist timolol, the alpha receptor antagonists phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine or the nonspecific vasodilator hydralazine. Hydralazine normalized systolic blood pressure (135 +/- 6 mm Hg), whereas timolol (144 +/- 5 mm Hg), phenoxybenzamine (166 +/- 5 mm Hg) or phentolamine (154 +/- 10 mm Hg) only moderately decreased blood pressure in rats harboring pheochromocytoma. Hydralazine had no effect on CM score (1.8 +/- 0.1). Timolol markedly attenuated the CM score (0.6 +/- 0.1), whereas the alpha adrenergic antagonists were not as effective (phenoxybenzamine CM score = 1.3 +/- 0.2; phentolamine CM score = 1.7 +/- 0.2). Furthermore, timolol prevented desensitization of beta adrenergic receptor-mediated contraction in the hearts of rats harboring pheochromocytoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "Esmolol is an ultrashort-acting, cardioselective, intravenous beta-blocker with an elimination half-life of about nine minutes. After administration of a loading dose, its full therapeutic effect is evident within five minutes. Its efficacy in treating supraventricular arrhythmias is equal to that of propranolol, but unlike propranolol, the action of esmolol is titratable and is largely reversed within 10 to 30 minutes after stopping its administration. Esmolol is also effective in attenuating life-threatening perioperative tachycardia and hypertension caused by adrenergic stimulation in high-risk patients.", 
    "83": "The renal hemodynamic response to direct electrical stimulation of renal nerves was studied in conscious and chronically instrumented fetal (130-142 days gestation; term 145 days), newborn (7-12 days postnatal), and adult nonpregnant sheep. Renal nerve stimulation (RNS) produced a significant decrease in renal blood flow (RBF) velocity and a significant increase in renal vascular resistance (RVR) in all three groups of animals. The overall decline in RBF velocity and the overall rise in RVR was less pronounced in fetal than in adult sheep (P less than 0.05). Changes in RBF velocity and RVR using an RNS frequency of 16 Hz were -35 +/- 4 and 81 +/- 19% in fetal sheep, -61 +/- 10 and 374 +/- 128% in newborn lambs, and -84 +/- 12 and 540 +/- 94% in adult sheep, respectively. RNS during intrarenal infusion of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine was associated with a significant increase in RBF velocity and decrease in RVR in both fetal sheep and newborn lambs, but not in adult sheep. Moreover, it was found that the rise in RBF velocity and the decrease in RVR associated with RNS during alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism were completely inhibited by intrarenal infusion of ICI 118,551, a beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist and unaffected by either cholinergic or dopaminergic antagonists. Taken together, these results suggest that the overall renal vasoconstrictor response to RNS is age dependent. Furthermore, the present results demonstrate that, contrary to observations made in adult animals, RNS can produce renal vasodilation in immature animals that is mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "84": "Inactive renin, prorenin, is found in high concentrations in human plasma. We report herein the characteristics of trypsin-activated inactive renin from cat kidney and plasma. Cat and human plasma inactive renin were activated by similar concentrations of trypsin. As in humans, there was more inactive than active renin in cat plasma; also, inactive renin was low but detectable after nephrectomy. Trypsin-activated renal inactive renin, purified on Cibacron blue agarose and pepstatin-amino-hexyl-Sepharose chromatography, was inhibited by pepstatin and by a renin inhibitor similarly to cat and human active renins. The pH optimum of cat renin was biphasic: the higher peak of active renin was at pH 5.7, whereas that of activated inactive renin was at pH 7.5. As in humans, active and inactive plasma renin increased during sodium depletion and inactive renin increased during beta-adrenergic blockade, while active renin decreased. These results demonstrate that cat inactive renin is similar to human prorenin. Therefore, the cat may be a useful model for the study of prorenin."
