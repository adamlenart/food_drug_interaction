A simple experimental model that assesses the incidence of arrhythmic contractions as a function of heart rate (pacing) is introduced. beta 1-adrenoceptors were activated by (-)-noradrenaline during beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade with 50 nmol/l ICI 118551. beta 2-adrenoceptors were activated by (-)-adrenaline during beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade with 300 nmol/l CGP 20712A. Both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline caused arrhythmic contractions whose incidence was greater at low than at high pacing rates. CGP 20712A (300 nmol/l) blocked the (-)-noradrenaline-evoked contractions in 1/1 atrial strip from 1/1 patient not treated with a beta blocker and 17/17 atrial strips from 15/15 patients chronically treated with beta blockers. ICI 118551 (50 nmol/l) blocked the (-)-adrenaline-evoked contractions in 3/4 atrial strips from 3/4 patients not treated with beta blockers and 17/20 atrial strips from 15/18 patients chronically treated with beta blockers. The incidence of arrhythmic contractions evoked by both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline was higher in chronically beta blocked patients than in non beta blocked patients. We conclude that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors mediate atrial arrhythmias and that the generation of these arrhythmias is facilitated by chronic beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "1": "1. Arrhythmogenic actions induced by class III antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, bretylium and sotalol) in spontaneously beating rabbit sino-atrial node cells were investigated by using a two microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. 2. Amiodarone (10(-6) mol/l) caused a negative chronotropic effect. Dysrhythmias at 10(-5) mol/l occurred in 3 out of 10 preparations. Amiodarone elicited a transient inward current. After wash out, the regular rhythm was resumed and the transient inward current also disappeared. 3. Bretylium (10(-5) mol/l) also induced dysrhythmias more often (in 5 of 11 preparations). Sotalol (10(-5) mol/l) caused dysrhythmias in only 1 of 10 preparations. 4. Changes in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in single sino-atrial node cells were monitored with fura-2, a Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye. Amiodarone (3 x 10(-5) mol/l) and bretylium (10(-5) mol/l) elevated the cytosolic Ca2+ level significantly, but sotalol even at 10(-3) mol/l did not affect it. 5. These results indicate that class III antiarrhythmic drugs possess arrhythmogenic actions, probably resulting from elevation of cellular Ca2+ concentration due to direct and indirect actions.", 
    "2": "1. Bepiridil, (beta-[(2-methylpropoxy)methyl]-N-phenyl-N-(phenyl-methyl)-1-py rro lidine-ethanamine), a calcium channel blocker, inhibits sickling of red blood cells (RBC) from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) at micromolar concentrations in vitro. 2. Bepridil induces dose-dependent osmotic swelling of RBC and a concomitant decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). 3. Modest decreases in MCHC greatly lengthen the delay time for polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (Hb S) and inhibit RBC sickling. 4. Equilibrium dialysis studies of bepridil and purified hemoglobin showed a low binding affinity (Kb = 10(3)/M). 5. The partition coefficient (Kp) determined for the interaction of RBC and bepridil was 1-3 x 10(3), which is similar to the Kp determined for other amphipathic molecules, such as chlorpromazine.", 
    "3": "The efficacy and safety of once-daily nifedipine coat-core when added to a regimen of atenolol (ATN; 50 mg/day) were compared with ATN and placebo in 251 patients with essential hypertension in this 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Mean net reductions (ATN effect subtracted) in supine diastolic blood pressure at endpoint were 7.9 mmHg, 9.4 mmHg, and 9.9 mmHg at 30, 60, and 90 mg/day of nifedipine coat-core, respectively, and 4.1 mmHg on ATN+placebo. Beyond the first week of double-blind therapy, all reductions produced by nifedipine coat-core combined with ATN were statistically significant (P < 0.05) compared with ATN+placebo. On ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, trough-to-peak ratios of the change in diastolic blood pressure for the 30, 60, and 90 mg/day doses were 41%, 68%, and 78%, respectively. Adverse events were generally mild or moderate and most reflected the vasodilatory properties of nifedipine (eg, edema, headache). Nifedipine coat-core, when combined with ATN in patients not controlled by ATN alone, had significant antihypertensive activity for the entire 24-hour dosing interval and was well tolerated by the majority of patients in the study.", 
    "4": "Thirty-nine patients with diabetes and hypertension were treated with indapamide for 24 weeks to study the effects of that drug on glucose and lipid metabolism. The drug was administered at a dose of 2 mg once per day in the morning as a single drug (26 patients) or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs (13 patients), including calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, an alpha-blocker, or a beta-blocker. Blood pressure was reduced in both groups during treatment, and no alteration of glycemic control or lipid metabolism was observed. One patient complained of a mild headache, but treatment was continued. The results indicate that indapamide is useful for the long-term treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients, either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "5": "The pharmacokinetic studies of propranolol following the application of the propercuten transdermal therapeutic system were performed in conscious rabbits previously assigned to 3 groups. Different forms of propercuten (forte and mite) were used in different groups, different areas of its application being employed. Pulsed intravenous injections of propranolol were given to Group 1 rabbits to conduct another series of pharmacokinetic studies. The rate of drug administration to the systemic bed was 0.08 mg/h per cm propercuten. The constant injection rate was maintained during 5 days, but when propercuten was withdrawn the elimination time of propranolol was 24 hours.", 
    "6": "We assessed the therapeutic efficacy of a low-dose combination of metoprolol and captopril given orally to C3H/Hej mice that developed dilated and hypertrophied hearts after being inoculated with the encephalomyocarditis virus. Mice were randomly assigned to one of six 8-week oral regimens: 1 mg/kg/day of metoprolol (group 1); 10 mg/kg/day of metoprolol (group 2); 1.2 mg/kg/day of captopril (group 3); 12 mg/kg/day of captopril (group 4); 1 mg/kg/day of metoprolol plus 1.2 mg/kg/day of captopril (group 5); or distilled water (control group). Group 4 exhibited a significantly lower survival rate and body weight than the control group (p < 0.01). Survival rates and body weights were similar in groups 1, 2, 3, 5, and the control group. Low-dose metoprolol plus captopril is superior to low-dose metoprolol, high-dose metoprolol, and low-dose captopril with regard to heart weight and the heart weight/body weight ratio. The left and right ventricular cavity dimensions as well as myocardial necrosis, calcification, and fibrosis were less severe in groups 4 and 5 than in the control group. The left ventricular free wall showed significantly more thinning in group 4 than in the control group (p < 0.01). Our results show that the administration of low-doses of metoprolol and captopril given in combination was effective in this animal model of congestive heart failure and was associated with a reduction in biventricular cavity dimensions and myocardial necrosis.", 
    "7": "To examine the effect of isoproterenol on Cl- current and its signal transduction pathway in beta-intercalated cells (beta-IC cell), peanut agglutinin (PNA) positive cells in culture were studied by the whole-cell clamp technique. We identified these cells as beta-IC cells by PNA-binding, cell alkalinization induced by Cl- free in the superfusate, and an increase in intracellular cAMP concentration by isoproterenol, but not by vasopressin. Application of isoproterenol in the voltage-clamp mode induced an activation of Cl- current in a dose-dependent fashion and its threshold concentration was in the order of 0.01 microM and ED50 was about 0.1 microM. This effect of isoproterenol was inhibited by atenolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker. Either extracellular application of forskolin or intracellular application of cAMP mimicked the action of isoproterenol. In the presence of forskolin or cAMP, isoproterenol caused little further activation of Cl- current. A synthetic inhibitor of protein kinase A (5-24 amide) inhibited the Cl- -channel activation by isoproterenol. Isoproterenol failed to activate the current in the presence of intracellular GDP beta S. By contrast, intracellular application of GTP gamma S rendered irreversible the Cl- -channel activation by brief exposure to isoproterenol. The present studies provide direct evidence that in the PNA-binding cell, probably the beta-IC cell, the stimulation of beta-adrenoceptor activates Cl- current through the signal transduction system involving G-protein, adenylate cyclase, cAMP, and protein kinase A.", 
    "8": "The effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) may be attributed to the inhibition of detrimental effects on the failing heart of sympathetic stimulation during exertion. However, the harmful effects of activity as well as the protective effects of beta-blockers have not been demonstrated. Diastolic ventricular function is known to be sensitive to transient myocardial metabolic insult. In this study, we investigated the effect of modest exercise with or without beta-blockade on the diastolic left ventricular pressure-volume (P-V) relation in patients with DCM.", 
    "9": "The diastolic left ventricular P-V relation was obtained by high-fidelity pressure measurements and digital subtraction left ventriculography at rest and immediately after modest supine bicycle exercise in 12 patients with DCM. The effects of intravenous administration of 0.1 mg/kg propranolol on resting and exercise P-V relations were studied. The end-diastolic and lowest left ventricular pressures were significantly elevated by exercise (20 +/- 9 to 32 +/- 13 mm Hg, P < .01, and 12 +/- 6 to 21 +/- 11 mm Hg, P < .01, respectively) despite insignificant changes in left ventricular volumes. The administration of propranolol did not alter the resting diastolic P-V relation. However, propranolol significantly attenuated the exercise-induced upward shift of the diastolic P-V relation despite a significant increase in end-diastolic volume. The significant upward shift and attenuation by propranolol were also observed even when the left ventricular pressure was corrected by the subtraction of right atrial pressure.", 
    "10": "These results indicate that even modest exercise exerts detrimental effects on diastolic left ventricular function of the failing heart through beta-adrenergic stimulation. The clinical effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy in patients with DCM can be attributed in part to the inhibition of detrimental myocardial effects of sympathetic stimulation during daily activity.", 
    "11": "In order to determine the possible interactions between histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) -class I antigens and beta-adrenergic receptors, we evaluated the effects of anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies on beta-adrenoceptor-mediated intracellular production of cAMP in human mononuclear leukocytes. Moreover, we studied whether anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies inhibit the binding of a specific radioligand to the beta-adrenoceptors, and, conversely, whether both isoproterenol and propranolol interfere with the binding (evaluated by a cytofluorometric assay) of the anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies to the cell membrane. Our results showed that anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies induced a significant beta-adrenergic-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP whereas anti-HLA class II and antimelanoma monoclonal antibodies were ineffective. Moreover anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies inhibited, in part, the specific binding of a beta-adrenergic radioligand, although they did not induce the internalization of the beta-adrenoceptors. On the other hand, both isoproterenol and propranolol induced a significant decrease in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression of HLA-class I molecules. Our data suggest that important interactions between major histocompatibility complex gene products and the beta-adrenergic receptors may occur in human cells.", 
    "12": "In a prospective single-blind comparative trial, sixty newly diagnosed mild to moderate hypertensives were randomly assigned to either propranolol or hydroflumethiazide monotherapy. Baseline fasting serum glucose lipid profiles, serum uric acid and potassium levels, were determined at the beginning of the trial. Repeat levels were determined at completion of twelve weeks of treatment. Propranolol treatment significantly reduced HDL-cholesterol (p < 0.02) and increased both VLDL and total serum triglycerides (p < 0.01). Hydroflumethiazide significantly increased total and LDL-chole-sterol, fasting serum glucose and uric acid levels (p < 0.01); potassium levels were significantly lowered (p < 0.01). Treatment with either propranolol or hydroflumethiazide is associated with significant metabolic side-effects which require regular monitoring and intervention as appropriate.", 
    "13": "We studied the effect of aspirin on beta-adrenergic receptors in lymphocytes from three groups of subjects: 5 asthmatic patients presenting sensitivity to aspirin, 10 asthmatic patients with tolerance to aspirin and a control group. Lymphocytes were incubated with aspirin-lysine (36 micrograms/ml). The number of beta-receptors/cell and the dissociation constants (Kd) were assessed by means of [125I]-cyanopindolol (ICYP). There was a decrease in the number of beta-receptors after incubation with aspirin in all asthmatic patients with sensitivity. The differences between mean basal (660 +/- 171 receptors/cell) and postincubation (398 +/- 110 receptors/cell) values were significant (p < 0.05). There were also significant differences (p < 0.01) between basal (23.4 +/- 6 pM) and postincubation (15 +/- 5.1 pM) Kd values, which indicates that the affinity of ICYP increased. In the subjects in the other two groups, aspirin both increased and decreased the number of beta-receptors, but the effects were not significant. It is suggested that in patients with sensitivity, aspirin could induce changes in the plasmatic membrane, thus altering beta-receptors or inducing the release of inflammatory mediators that exert their effect upon these receptors.", 
    "14": "The effects of dose of metoprolol (Met) on hepatic elimination was studied in isolated rat liver perfused at a flow of 25 ml.min-1. The results showed that Met was eliminated by rat liver in accordance with one-compartment model. Linear kinetic eliminating processes (apparent first-order kinetics) were found in doses of Met 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg, T1/2 were 8.3, 8.8, 9.6, and 10.6 min and the clearance rate were 11.7, 11.8, 9.6, and 8.6 ml.min-1, respectively. Nonlinear eliminating processes were found in doses of Met 4, 8, and 12 mg. Vm and Km were 0.98, 1.05, and 0.94 microgram/min-1.ml-1 and 15.6, 16.9, and 14.6 micrograms.ml-1, respectively. It is concluded that hepatic Met elimination is independent on lower doses, but rested upon high doses.", 
    "15": "The analgesic effect of protopine (Pro), an alkaloid isolated from Papaveraceae, was confirmed by tail-pinch and hot-plate tests when given sc 10-40 mg.kg-1, and 20-40 mg.kg-1 inhibited the spontaneous movements of mice. Pro 40 mg.kg-1 increased the sleeping rate, prolonged the sleeping duration, and shortened the sleeping latency in mice hypnotized by ip pentobarbital sodium 30 mg.kg-1. Pro 10-40 mg.kg-1 did not affect the inflammatory reaction induced by xylene and egg white. An icv injection of Pro 20-200 micrograms/mouse showed a remarkable analgesic effect in mice. The icv pretreatment of naloxone 2 micrograms blocked the analgesic effect completely. CaCl2 40 micrograms/mouse (ICV) or methotrexate 10 mg.kg-1 (ip), an agonist of Ca2+ channel, showed a complete blockade of the analgesia, while nifedipine 100 mg.kg-1(po), a blocker of Ca2+ channel, enhanced the analgesic effect. The ip pretreatment of reserpine 4 mg.kg-1 reduced the Pro analgesia. Phentolamine 10 mg.kg-1(ip), an alpha-adrenergic blocker, tended to weaken the analgesia, but propranolol 10 mg.kg-1(ip), a beta-blocker, did not affect it. These results suggest that Pro displays its analgesic effect mainly through the opioid and calcium systems and partly through the adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "16": "The IOP depressive effect of puerarin, a beta-receptor blocker, was found to be optimal at the concentration of 1% in animal experiments. Clinical trial use on glaucoma patients (80 cases, 143 eyes) demonstrated good IOP depressive effect on primary open--or closed-angle glaucoma and secondary glaucoma. For all types of glaucoma not satisfactorily controlled by conventional drugs such as timolol and pilocarpine or by operation, the addition of puerarin also yielded favorably results. The total effective rate was 70.63%. The raw herb is produced in quantity, hence puerarin is a promising agent for the treatment of glaucoma in China.", 
    "17": "1. The effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation on the generation of pacemaker action potentials, recorded from the sino-atrial node of the guinea-pig, were determined by using intracellular recording techniques. 2. Trains of stimuli applied to the right stellate ganglion led to an increase in heart rate after a delay of a few seconds. During the initial phase of the tachycardia the rate of discharge of pacemaker action potentials increased and the rate of diastolic depolarization increased, but both the peak diastolic potential and the maximum rate of rise of the action potentials were reduced. During the later phase of the tachycardia the peak diastolic potential, the amplitude of the action potentials, the maximum rate of rise and the rate of repolarization of the action potentials were increased. 3. When membrane potential recordings were made from sino-atrial node cells, in which beating had been abolished by adding the organic calcium antagonist nifedipine, sympathetic nerve stimulation initiated excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) which had time courses similar to those of the tachycardias recorded from beating preparations. 4. Although both the tachycardias produced by either sympathetic nerve stimulation or added noradrenaline were largely abolished by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, the membrane potential changes recorded during the responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation or added noradrenaline were different. Bath-applied noradrenaline caused a tachycardia which was associated with an increase in the amplitudes of pacemaker action potentials, an increase in the peak diastolic potential and a shortening in the duration of pacemaker action potentials. 5. The addition of agents which cause the accumulation of cyclic AMP in the cytoplasm of the cells produced a tachycardia which was associated with a similar sequence of changes in the membrane potentials to those produced by added noradrenaline; again the membrane potential changes produced by these agents differed from those produced by sympathetic nerve stimulation. 6. The results are discussed in relation to the idea that neurally released noradrenaline activates a set of receptors which cause tachycardia by increasing inward current flow during diastole, whereas added noradrenaline activates a set of receptors that are linked to a cyclic AMP-dependent pathway which modifies the properties of some of the voltage-dependent channels involved in pacemaking activity.", 
    "18": "Only rarely have serious side effects been reported with the use of intravenous dipyridamole. We describe two cases of severe bradycardia, of which one led to asystole, in patients undergoing dipyridamole-thallium studies. The association between beta blocker therapy and the seven reported cases of asystole with dipyridamole is discussed and mechanisms postulated. Some caution is advised when patients on beta blockers or similar medications have dipyridamole-thallium studies.", 
    "19": "1. Xanthonolol (0.1-5.0 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced the blood pressure, heart rate, and L-isoproterenol (0.05 microgram/kg, i.v.)-induced tachycardia in rats. 2. In the isolated guinea-pig right atrium, xanthonolol (10(-6)-3 x 10(-4) M) produced long-lasting negative, inhibited L-isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic effects, prevented the rate-increasing effects of increased extracellular Ca2+ (3.0-9.0 mM), and inhibited Ca2+ (3.0-9.0 mM)-induced heart rate-increase. 3. In the isolated guinea-pig thoracic aorta, the contractions induced by CaCl2 (0.1-5.0 mM) were inhibited by xanthonolol (10(-6)-10(-4) M). 4. Xanthonolol is suggested to have a calcium channel and beta adrenergic blocking effect with vasodilating properties.", 
    "20": "Intravascular pressure and cardiac output monitoring are frequently performed in the operating room and intensive care unit. Currently, cardiac output is only measured intermittently, although continuous measurement would be preferable. One method proposed for measuring cardiac output continuously is arterial waveform pulse contour analysis. This study examines the utility of trending cardiac output using pulse contour analysis during manipulations of blood pressure.", 
    "21": "Eleven patients were studied while undergoing resection of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Cardiac output measured by pulse contour analysis was compared with thermodilution cardiac output measurements in patients subjected to induced hypotension with esmolol and restoration of blood pressure with phenylephrine.", 
    "22": "Esmolol infusion resulted in a decrease in mean arterial pressure from 81 +/- 13 to 62 +/- 7 mm Hg (p < 0.025), a decrease in thermodilution cardiac output from 6.4 +/- 0.9 to 4.4 +/- 1.1 L/min (p < 0.025), and a decrease in pulse contour cardiac output from 6.2 +/- 1.0 to 4.5 +/- 0.9 L/min. Phenylephrine increased mean arterial pressure from 68 +/- 6 to 95 +/- 9 mm Hg with no change in either thermodilution or pulse contour cardiac output.", 
    "23": "This study demonstrates that during surgery for arteriovenous malformations in the brain, the pulse contour method was able to reflect cardiac output accurately during induced hypotension with esmolol and during restoration of blood pressure with phenylephrine.", 
    "24": "The role of beta-adrenoceptors in exercise-induced muscle hyperaemia was investigated. Exercise was performed with a small and a large muscle mass: knee extension (KE) and bicycle exercise (BE). Seven healthy subjects performed light and maximal KE and eight subjects performed stepwise dynamic BE to exhaustion before and after acute i.v. administration of propranolol (0.15 mg kg-1). Leg blood flow was measured by a bolus dye dilution technique. During KE at low and high power leg blood flow was reduced by 8.7 and 10.5% after propranolol was administered, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was reduced at low, but not at high power resulting in increased leg vascular resistance (LVR) during high intensity. During BE propranolol reduced leg blood flow and increased LVR at low power, but not at high power. At high BE intensity LVR did not change with increasing power and was slightly decreased after propranolol was administered. In this situation oxygen uptake was close to maximum and the concentration of catecholamines was 3-5 times higher compared with KE. There was no significant effect of propranolol on lactate release or arterial-femoral venous (a-fv) differences for adrenaline or noradrenaline. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptors modulate local vasodilation in skeletal muscles during exercise independently of local muscle energy demand, but that the effect is highly dependent on active muscle mass since alpha-adrenergic activity during maximal BE seemed to disguise any effect of propranolol on LVR.", 
    "25": "We tested whether moderate dynamic exercise alters baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) in conscious dogs and whether the autonomic mechanisms mediating arterial baroreflex control of HR differ in the two settings of rest and exercise. Conscious, chronically instrumented dogs were studied during rest and moderate treadmill exercise (6.4 kpm, 10% grade). Sustained changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were induced by graded intravenous infusions of phenylephrine and nitroglycerine. Baroreflex HR sensitivity was assessed as the slope of the linear regression between MAP and HR. Responses to increases and decreases in MAP were analyzed separately. Studies were repeated after muscarinic (atropine, 0.2 mg/kg iv) or beta-adrenergic (propranolol, 2.0 mg/kg iv) blockade during rest and exercise. During control experiments both at rest and during exercise, baroreflex changes in HR were greater in response to decreases than to increases in MAP. Experiments performed after separate cardiac autonomic blockade revealed that at rest baroreflex-induced bradycardia occurs via parasympathetic activation but tachycardia occurs via a combined parasympathetic inhibition-sympathetic activation. During exercise, whereas the magnitude of baroreflex responses was unchanged compared with rest, the autonomic mechanisms mediating the baroreflex changes in HR were altered. In this setting, baroreflex tachycardia and bradycardia occur via modulation of both parasympathetic and sympathetic tone.", 
    "26": "1. Affinities of agonists for porcine adipose tissue beta-adrenergic receptors, determined by competitive ligand binding with 3H-dihydroalprenolol to crude adipose tissue membranes in vitro, varied from 50 times > to 25 times < than isoproterenol. Affinities for antagonists varied from 8 times > to 1000 times < propranolol. 2. Receptor affinity was not related to the ability to stimulate or inhibit lipolysis, or to the agonist or antagonist purported receptor subtype specificity. 3. Modeling of ligand-binding data indicated more than one binding site for several ligands. The assignment of beta-adrenergic subtypes to the individual binding sites was unclear because this would depend on the individual ligands used to establish binding sites.", 
    "27": "Scatchard analysis of (3H)CGP-12177 and (125I)cyanopindolol (CYP) radioligand binding data revealed the presence of specific beta-adrenergic receptor-binding sites on microdissected mouse proximal straight and medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) tubules. beta-Receptor (10(-6) M isoproterenol) stimulation of isolated perfused mTAL tubules produced a consistent hyperpolarization of the transepithelial potential that was blocked by propranolol (10(-6) M), a beta-receptor antagonist, and furosemide (10(-4) M), an inhibitor of the Na+/K+/2 Cl- triporter. In contrast, there was no electrogenic response to isoproterenol stimulation in isolated perfused proximal straight tubules. In summary, radioligand binding data show that both proximal straight and mTAL tubules possess beta-receptor-binding sites. Electrogenic transport in the mTAL can be modulated by beta-agonists, but there was no detectable electrogenic response to beta-receptor stimulation in proximal straight tubules.", 
    "28": "Amlodipine 10 mg was evaluated for additional anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal efficacy in 14 patients pre-treated with a beta-blocker who had documented coronary artery disease, stable angina pectoris, and > or = 2 mm of exercise-induced ST segment depression. For 2 days the patients received open-label amlodipine and then, according to a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over and double-blind protocol, they were treated with amlodipine or placebo, respectively, once a day for 3 weeks each. Exercise tests and blood sampling for plasma concentrations of amlodipine were performed at 8 and at 24 h after dosing on both days of acute testing as well as on day 18 of chronic treatment. During chronic treatment, when plasma concentrations fluctuated between 23.5 ng.ml-1 at 8 h and 14 ng.ml-1 at 24 h post-dosing, ST segment depression at an individually comparable workload was significantly decreased by 28% compared with placebo (P < 0.005) at both points in time. Increases in ischaemia-free workload capacity amounted to 76% (P < 0.005) and to 81% (P < 0.01) at 8 and at 24 h, respectively. The number of anginal attacks was reduced by 39% (P < 0.05). Conversely, after initial dosing, i.e. when plasma concentrations declined from 4.7 ng.ml-1 to 3.9 ng.ml-1, influences upon ischaemic parameters compared to control values were markedly less at 24 h as opposed to 8 h. There were no untoward side effects observed at any point in time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The metabolism of propranolol was examined by using microsomes from Dark Agouti rats known as a poor-metabolizer animal model for debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation and Wistar rats. Propranolol 4- and 5-hydroxylations followed biphasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and 7-hydroxylation and N-desisopropylation were monophasic in both strains. The kinetic studies showed that the Vmax for propranolol 7-hydroxylase activity and the Vmax of high-affinity phases for propranolol 4- and 5-hydroxylase activities were markedly low in Dark Agouti rats compared with those in Wistar rats. The antibody against a cytochrome P-450 isozyme, P-450BTL (Suzuki, T., et al., Drug Metab. Dispos. 20, 367-373, 1992), belonging to the CYP2D subfamily, inhibited by 90% propranolol 4-, 5-, and 7-hydroxylase activities in liver microsomes from male Wistar rats at a low propranolol concentration (5 microM). However, less inhibitory effects of the antibody on propranolol 4- and 5-hydroxylase activities were observed at a high propranolol concentration (1 mM), whereas a similar inhibitory effect of the antibody on propranolol 7-hydroxylase activity was shown. The antibody inhibited propranolol N-desisopropylase activity, but less extent of the inhibition on this activity than those on ring-hydroxylase activities was observed at the low and high propranolol concentrations. These results indicate that a polymorphic cytochrome P-450 isozyme(s) belonging to the CYP2D subfamily is involved predominantly in propranolol 4-, 5-, and 7-hydroxylations at low substrate concentrations in the rat.", 
    "30": "1. The existence of a functional beta 3-adrenoceptor in man was investigated by studying the lipolytic action of selective beta-adrenoceptor agents in isolated white omental and subcutaneous fat cells. 2. The non-selective beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, CGP 12177 was lipolytic in both omental and subcutaneous fat cells. The intrinsic activity relative to isoprenaline was greater in omental than in subcutaneous cells. 3. Addition of the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551 and the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A in combination or the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol alone (all 10(-7) M), induced a rightward shift of the dose-response curves for isoprenaline- and BRL37344-stimulated lipolysis of about 4 and 2 log-units, respectively. However, the antagonists did not alter lipolysis induced by CGP12177. 4. Several concentrations of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were used to determine the pA2 values by Schild analysis. The values for CGP 20712A and ICI 118,551 (6.63 +/- 0.20 and 6.25 +/- 0.12) as antagonists of the lipolytic effects of CGP 12177 were over 2 units lower than the pA2 value for CGP 20712A against the response to the selective beta 1-agonist dobutamine (8.58 +/- 0.23) and the pA2 value for ICI 118,551 against the response to the selective beta 2-agonist terbutaline (9.15 +/- 0.26). 5. beta 3-Adrenoceptor mRNA expression, investigated with a polymerase chain reaction assay, was demonstrated in both types of adipocytes in the same cell preparations that had a lipolytic response to CGP 12177. 6. In conclusion, human white fat cells express an atypical beta-adrenoceptor in addition to beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. This receptor is stimulated more selectively by the beta1/beta2-antagonist CGP 12177 than by BRL 37344 and is poorly sensitive to blockade by selective beta1- and beta2-antagonists. On the basis of the pharmacological properties and the mRNA analyses, we suggest that this atypical receptor corresponds to the beta 3-adrenoceptor subtype.", 
    "31": "1. The action of the lumbar sympathetic nerves to cat colon was studied in vitro using isolated muscle strips with attached lumbar colonic nerves (LCN) orientated in the axis of circular muscle layer. Electrical stimulation of LCN caused frequency-dependent increases in resting tension and in amplitude of spontaneous contractions. Contractile responses were abolished by tetrodotoxin (3 microM) and by guanethidine (30 microM), indicating that they were neurogenic, involving the release of neurotransmitter from sympathetic fibres. 2. Propranolol (1-9 microM), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, caused a concentration-dependent potentiation of LCN-evoked contractile responses. Propranolol (3 microM) potentiated contractile responses to exogenously applied noradrenaline but not to phenylephrine. 3. Phentolamine (1-9 microM), an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, and prazosin (1-9 microM), an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, caused a concentration-dependent reduction of amplitude but did not abolish LCN-evoked contractile responses. Prazosin (3 microM) or phentolamine (3 microM) antagonized contractile responses to noradrenaline and phenylephrine. 4. Desensitization of purinoceptors with the P2x-receptor agonist, alpha,beta-methylene ATP, caused a decrease in amplitude of LCN-evoked contractile responses and abolished contractile responses to ATP. In muscle strips where alpha 1-adrenoceptors were blocked with prazosin (3 microM) and P2-purinoceptors were desensitized with alpha,beta-methylene ATP, the amplitude of contractile responses was reduced by 82-100%. 5. The P2x-purinoceptor antagonists, arylazido amino propyl adenosine triphosphate (ANAPP3) and 5. The P2x-purinoceptor antagonists, arylazido amino propyl adenosine triphosphate (ANAPP3) and suramin, affected LCN-evoked contractile responses. ANAPP3 (50-100 microM) caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the amplitude of contractile response. Suramin (100 microM) caused a small reduction in amplitude of contractile responses but potentiated their amplitude at a concentration of 500 microM. 6. ANAPP3 (100 microM) irreversibly inhibited contractions to alpha,beta-methylene ATP or ATP. Suramin (100-500 microM) inhibited contractions to alpha,beta-methylene ATP (0.5-1 microM) or low concentrations of ATP (10-50 microM) but potentiated contractions at higher concentrations. ANAPP3 (100 microM) and suramin (100, 500 microM) had no effect on contractile responses to noradrenaline. 7. Clonidine (0.05-1 microM), a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, caused a concentration-dependent reduction in amplitude of LCN-evoked contractile responses, at 10 Hz, while yohimbine (0.1-1 microM), a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, increased them. At 1 microM, both compounds affected LCN-evoked contractions at all frequencies. This suggests that prejunctional alpha 2-receptors are involved in autoinhibition at sympathetic terminals. 8. In summary, LCN-evoked contractile responses involve the corelease of noradrenaline and ATP or a related purine nucleotide from sympathetic fibres. It is likely that the neurogenic responses are mediated through excitatory postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors, excitatory suramin-sensitive and suramin-insensitiveP2X-purinoceptors and inhibitory beta-adrenoceptors. Also, autoinhibitory prejunctional alpha2-adrenoceptors regulate the LCN excitatory pathway to cat colon circular muscle.", 
    "32": "1. The imidazoline alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, efaroxan, stimulates insulin secretion from rat isolated islets and antagonizes the ability of diazoxide to inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion. These effects result from closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels although the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. 2. In the present work, we have examined the effects of a close structural analogue of efaroxan, RX801080, in rat isolated islets of Langerhans. RX801080 was found to be ineffective as a stimulator of insulin secretion and did not prevent the inhibition of insulin secretion mediated by diazoxide. 3. RX801080 acted as an antagonist of the actions of several imidazolines (efaroxan, phentolamine and midaglizole) in rat islets. It dose-dependently inhibited the ability of efaroxan to antagonize the effects of diazoxide in islets and also completely inhibited the direct stimulation of insulin secretion mediated by efaroxan. 4. RX801080 also antagonized the effects of the non-imidazoline, ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker, glibenclamide, in rat islets. It inhibited both the capacity of glibenclamide to stimulate insulin secretion and the ability of glibenclamide to overcome the inhibitory effects of diazoxide in rat islets. 5. Antagonism of glibenclamide responses by RX801080 was not due to inhibition of binding of the sulphonylurea to its receptor on the pancreatic beta-cell. 6. The results suggest that imidazoline compounds and sulphonylureas interact with distinct binding sites on islet cells, but that these sites can interact functionally to control islet cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel activity and insulin secretion.", 
    "33": "1. The transepithelial transport of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, celiprolol, was investigated in monolayers of the well differentiated human intestinal epithelial cell line, Caco-2. 2. The basal-to-apical transport (secretion) of [14C]-celiprolol (50 microM) was 5 times higher than apical-to-basal transport (absorption). In the presence of an excess (5 mM) of unlabelled celiprolol the basal-to-apical transport was reduced by more than 80%, whereas the apical-to-basal transport remained unchanged. 3. Net celiprolol secretion obtained in the concentration range 0.01 to 5 mM displayed saturable kinetics with an apparent Km of 1.00 +/- 0.23 mM and Vmax of 113 +/- 11 pmol/10(6) cells min-1. These results are consistent with saturable active secretion and provide an explanation for the dose-dependent bioavailability of celiprolol. 4. The secretion of celiprolol was sensitive to pH, and decreased in the absence of sodium and in the presence of ouabain, suggesting that transport was coupled to proton and sodium gradients. 5. The secretion of celiprolol was inhibited by substrates for P-glycoprotein (vinblastine, verapamil and nifedipine) and either inhibited or stimulated by typical substrates for the renal organic cation-H+ exchanger (cimetidine, N1-methylnicotinamide, tetraethylammonium and choline), suggesting that there are at least two distinct transport systems. 6. The secretion of celiprolol was also inhibited by other beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, pafenolol and propranolol) and by the diuretics, acetazolamide, chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide, suggesting that the clinically observed effect of chlorthalidone on the bioavailability of celiprolol occurs at the level of the intestinal epithelium.", 
    "34": "The recent developments in enantioselective HPLC-separation techniques are impressive and are driven by industrial and academic interests; thus there is for instance a high demand for developing stereoselective assays for chiral drugs in biological fluids. The beta-blocking agents, which possess an amino-propanol- or -ethanol side chain with at least one chiral centre, represent one of the most intensively investigated groups of more than 40 drugs introduced world wide. Seven of the most popular beta-blockers were chosen as representatives: atenolol; betaxolol; carvedilol; metoprolol; pindolol; propranolol; and sotalol, these span the whole range of lipophilicity to hydrophilicity (polarity). Enantioselective HPLC bioassays for these beta-blockers published so far, including techniques based on chiral derivatizing agents (CDAs), chiral stationary phases (CSPs) and chiral mobile phase additives (CMPAs) have been reviewed and documented in the light of general aspects together with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations.", 
    "35": "The coexistence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension often requires concomitant drug treatments. Thus, it is interesting to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the new lipid-lowering agent fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor, in patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive/cardiovascular drug treatments. A retrospective analysis was based on data from controlled clinical trials in which 1815 patients were treated with fluvastatin and 783 patients received placebo. The daily dose of fluvastatin was > or = 20 mg. At least one of the following drug treatments was taken by 445 of the fluvastatin-treated patients (24.5%) and 181 of those receiving placebo (23.1%): beta-adrenergic-receptor blockers (fluvastatin: n = 182; placebo: n = 84); diuretics (fluvastatin: n = 168; placebo: n = 72); calcium antagonists (fluvastatin: n = 161; placebo: n = 69); and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (fluvastatin: n = 101; placebo: n = 30). The majority of patients received monotherapy with one of the above-mentioned antihypertensive agents (fluvastatin: 69%; placebo: 65%). The efficacy of fluvastatin in modifying low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride levels was not consistently different in patients taking a given antihypertensive compared with the overall group and the patients not taking the antihypertensive agent. In patients taking fluvastatin and antihypertensives, confirmed (measured at two consecutive occasions) increases more than three times the upper limit of normal in aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) occurred in only two patients. One case involved the concomitant use of a beta-blocker (ASAT and ALAT) and the other a diuretic (ALAT).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

R- and S-1-phenylethylisocyanate (PEIC) as well as (1S)-(+)-campher-10-sulfonylchloride (CSC) are used for the derivatization of the compounds. Correlations between chromatographic data and various influences (pH, temperature, reaction time, concentration of reagens a.o.) have been discussed. The behaviour of derivatized and underivatized analytes on RP-columns is described in dependence on buffer concentration of the mobile phase. The investigated beta-adrenergic agents were partly separated after derivatization with PEIC, whereas this was not possible with CSC as derivatization reagent.", 
    "37": "It is only in the last few years that the broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic properties of sotalol have become increasingly recognized. Racemic sotalol has potent beta-blocking and class III antiarrhythmic properties, and it has been reported that this drug is able to control supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Recently, several studies performed with the d-sotalol isomer, which is almost devoid of the beta-blocking effects compared to the racemate, suggest significant antiarrhythmic efficacy and good tolerance of the dextro-isomer. In this paper we review and discuss the effects of sotalol and d-sotalol in patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF) or cardiac arrest in whom VT or VF was induced by programmed electrical stimulation (PES).", 
    "38": "Numerous trials performed over the last 20 years, although uncontrolled, have shown the racemic d,l-sotalol is effective for the acute conversion and for long-term prevention of recurrences of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Sotalol appeared to be moderately effective in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, having somewhat greater efficacy in the case of atrioventricular (AV) nodal re-entrant tachycardia due to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or concealed accessory pathway. These effects may stem from the combined class II and class III electrophysiologic properties of this drug. However, studies comparing d,l-sotalol to pure beta blockers in different 'models', especially postsurgical arrhythmias and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, have suggested that the observed clinical benefit may be related to d,l-sotalol's class III properties. Thus, d-sotalol may be efficacious in these indications. Its precise efficacy should be defined in controlled clinical trials.", 
    "39": "Antiarrhythmic agents with class I action have been available for decades, and those with class III mode of action for more than 10 years. However, no randomized, controlled, direct comparison between agents with class I and class III mode of action was performed until recently. In patients with successful DC conversion of chronic atrial fibrillation, sotalol proved to be as effective as quinidine in maintaining sinus rhythm but was better tolerated and provided beneficial rate control during atrial fibrillation in those patients who relapsed. In other clinical settings, such as the pharmacological conversion of acute or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the termination of and/or prophylaxis against atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery, less reliable data is available. Both commonly-available agents with a class III mode of action, amiodarone and sotalol, also have other significant antiarrhythmic properties; for sotalol, the combination of class III activity and beta blockade may prove to be favourable. Therefore, the available data is not necessarily representative of a pure class III mode of action. Ongoing studies with d-sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation will provide the first important information on the clinical usefulness of a class III mode of action without subsidiary effects. Whether d-sotalol or other new class III agents will, in the future, be compared to class I agents still remains an open question.", 
    "40": "The inotropic effects of sotalol in comparison to other antiarrhythmic drugs were tested in an experimental model allowing isovolumic measurements independently of the loading conditions. All class I drugs had a similar negative inotropic effect. d,l-Sotalol caused a dose-dependent depressant effect on the rate of left ventricular pressure development. The same held true for l-sotalol. In contrast, d-sotalol, in clinical doses, revealed no significant inotropic effects in normal hearts. In a postischemic model, d-sotalol led to a further deterioration of left ventricular function. It could be demonstrated by autonomic blockade that this effect was mainly the result of the remaining weak beta-blocking activity of the d-isomer in addition to its class III action. After intravenous administration of amiodarone in doses of 10 mg.kg-1, no significant inotropic effects were found in normal rats.", 
    "41": "d,l-Sotalol is a racemic drug composed of equimolar amounts of d-(+)-sotalol and l-(-)-sotalol. The l-(-)-enantiomer has both beta-blocking (class II) activity and potassium-channel-blocking (class III) properties. The d-(+)-enantiomer has class III properties similar to those of l-sotalol. However, the affinity of d-sotalol for beta-adrenergic receptors is 30 to 60 times lower than the affinity of l-sotalol. The pharmacokinetics of d,l-sotalol are linear. Following oral administration, absorption and bioavailability are almost complete; apparent elimination half-life ranges from 7 to 18 hours. More than 80% of racemic sotalol elimination occurs by renal excretion of unchanged drug. Sotalol is not metabolized, nor is it significantly bound to plasma proteins. Thus, steady-state plasma concentration is reached within 3 days of treatment onset in patients without renal insufficiency. Dosage of sotalol should be adjusted to creatinine clearance. The pharmacokinetic profile of d-sotalol is similar to that of the racemate. Plasma concentrations of racemic sotalol associated with beta-adrenergic blockade are similar to those associated with its class III actions. QT interval prolongation with d,l-sotalol is dose- and concentration-dependent and decreases at rapid heart rates. Also, QT interval prolongation at a given plasma concentration during repeated dosing tends to be less pronounced than QT prolongation at the same plasma concentration during single dosing. The class III actions of d-sotalol in the sinus node are associated with slowing of sinus heart rate, whereas additional beta blockade contributes to the decrease in heart rate observed with l- or d,l sotalol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "Although discovered more than two decades ago, the clinical applications of sotalol are still a matter of debate. Together with amiodarone, sotalol is considered a prototype of a new class of antiarrhythmic agents characterized by repolarization-prolonging effects (class III). Lengthening of repolarization is associated with an increase in the effective refractory period of cardiac tissues. There is no change in the maximum rate of rise during phase 0, a finding that supports the lack of sotalol effect on the fast sodium channel. The electrophysiologic action of the drug in humans provides evidence for direct cardiac effects of sotalol in addition to beta blockade. The beta-blocking properties play a major role in the sinus-rate slowing and lengthening of the atrioventricular nodal conduction time observed after sotalol administration. However, the drug also prolongs refractoriness in atria, His-Purkinje tissue, ventricular muscle and accessory atrioventricular connections. These latter changes are absent or minimal with conventional beta blockers and are likely to reflect sotalol-induced prolongation of cardiac repolarization. They result in an increase in the QT interval, an effect that is dose-dependent and more marked during chronic therapy. The dextrorotatory isomer, d-sotalol, shares a similar electrophysiologic profile. Lengthening of repolarization in cardiac cells following d-sotalol is of the same magnitude as that produced by the levoisomer. This finding provides further evidence for a class III action of sotalol, as the dextroisomer is almost devoid of beta-blocking properties. In humans, the electrical effects of both drugs are similar. However, d-sotalol-induced changes in sinus rate and atrioventricular nodal conduction are modest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Over the last decade, there has been an increasing confluence of experimental and clinical data on the gravity of proarrhythmic effects of class I agents. Over the same period, beta blockers have been shown to reduce mortality in a variety of subsets of patients. The properties of amiodarone and sotalol have also drawn attention to their potential as antifibrillatory compounds, perhaps acting principally by prolonging myocardial repolarization with little or no effect on conduction. However, amiodarone and sotalol are complex molecules and, therefore, attention is also focused on compounds that act simply by selective prolongation of cardiac repolarization. These agents have been termed 'pure' class III agents. The properties of sotalol, the prototype of class III agents, are of particular interest, as it is a racemic mixture of the levo- and dextro-isomers. The levo-isomer has 50 times the beta-blocking potency of the dextro-isomer, actions. Studies of the antiarrhythmic properties of beta blockers, d- and d,l-sotalol, and amiodarone may provide insights into the nature of class III actions. There is clinical evidence indicating that class III drugs exert a varying spectrum of antifibrillatory and proarrhythmic (characterized by torsade de pointes) actions for a given degree of prolongation of repolarization. These differences currently are not accountable in terms of specificity of their actions on ionic channels. There are differences between the so-called pure class III agents, such as sematilide, dofetilide and E-4031, and more complex compounds, such as sotalol and amiodarone, that also exert antiadrenergic actions. In the development of newer drugs an appropriate balance needs to be struck between proarrhythmic actions and the antifibrillatory properties. At present, it is unclear whether such antifibrillatory compounds should be relatively simple molecules with clearly-defined electrophysiologic profiles in terms of actions on ion channels, currents, receptors and pumps, or whether they need to be those with complex electropharmacologic profiles with multiplicity of actions.", 
    "44": "Patients with coronary artery disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting can develop perioperative low cardiac output failure requiring positive inotropic support. Commonly, the sympathetic amines, dopamine, dobutamine or adrenaline are used in low-output state. However, patients on long-term cardioselective beta-blocking therapy may experience problems with such a treatment. Dopexamine, a new synthetic amine, possesses positive inotropic effects by indirect stimulation of the beta 1-receptors and direct stimulation of the beta 2-receptors. We therefore studied the hemodynamic efficacy of dopexamine in patients with and without beta-receptor blockade. In 12 patients with coronary artery disease classed as NYHA II or III, six without any beta-blocker medication, and six with beta 1-blocker medication (bisoprolol 5 mg), anesthesia was induced with high-dose fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg) and pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg). The patients were normoventilated with a mask (O2:air 1:1, tidal volume 10 ml/kg with a rate of 10/min) for 5 min and then intubated. Following intubation anesthesia was continued with 0.025 mg/kg/h fentanyl. In anesthesia steady state the patients of both groups were treated with 2 micrograms/kg/min dopexamine over a period of 15 min and then with 4 micrograms/kg/min dopexamine over a further period of 15 min. Measurements of cardiovascular dynamics included heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), right atrium pressure (RAP), pressure work index (PWI) and arterial-mixed venous oxygen content difference (AVDO2), which were monitored or calculated by standard formulas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "QT-dispersion defined as the difference between QTmax and QTmin in the 12-lead surface ECG was determined in 33 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated by intravenous thrombolysis. In 11 patients, ventricular fibrillation ensured during the first 24 h after hospital admission. These patients were then compared with 22 matching infarction patients without malignant ventricular rhythm disturbances. QT-dispersion as evaluated in the first ECG taken after hospital admission was significantly higher in patients with (88 +/- 16 ms) compared to QT-dispersion in patients without ventricular fibrillation (66 +/- 19 ms; p < 0.001). When QT-dispersion was again assessed in ECG tracings recorded prior to hospital discharge, it was markedly reduced, with no significant difference between either patient group (53 +/- 16 ms versus 54 +/- 18 ms). These results indicate that QT-dispersion in the surface ECG represents a marker of inhomogeneous repolarization in patients with acute myocardial infarction prone to ventricular fibrillation. This may allow early identification of high-risk patients soon after hospital admission.",

It also discusses the role of some new molecules (L-carnitine, trimetazidine and ranolazine) that have been proposed as an alternative pharmacological approach for the metabolic management of cardiac ischaemic syndromes.", 
    "47": "Trimetazidine (TMZ) exerts anti-ischaemic effects without any associated central haemodynamic change, both at rest and with exercise. These findings suggest that TMZ has a direct cytoprotective effect, the efficacy of which has been confirmed by clinical studies in effort angina. TMZ as monotherapy when compared with placebo, in acute (60 mg) as well as in chronic (20 mg t.i.d.) administration, significantly improves exercise tolerance: total work, duration of exercise and time to 1 mm ST segment depression, without changing the rate-pressure product. Moreover, during chronic treatment TMZ decreases the rate of anginal attacks. In patients with coronary heart disease insufficiently controlled with nifedipine or a beta-blocker as monotherapy, the addition of TMZ (20 mg t.i.d.) significantly reduces the number of anginal attacks and improves exercise capacity. TMZ antianginal activity in monotherapy has also been compared in double-blind controlled studies with that of a calcium channel antagonist and a beta-blocker as reference drugs. TMZ is as efficient as nifedipine or propranolol on clinical variables as well as on ergometric criteria, but unlike these two reference drugs, which act through a haemodynamic mechanism, TMZ does not decrease rate-pressure product. Furthermore, in the study comparing TMZ with propranolol, TMZ was shown to decrease ischaemic episodes recorded by ECG ambulatory monitoring. These data show that TMZ belongs to the major antianginal agents available today. However, the absence of central haemodynamic effects suggests that the drug has a novel anti-ischaemic mechanism involving direct myocardial cytoprotection.",

Bath administration of noradrenaline (10 microM) reduced synaptic transmission of afferent inputs from layer 1. The decrease affected all the components of the evoked response and particularly the monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) as evidenced by a reduction of its initial rising slope (mean slope: 71 +/- 11% of its control). Pharmacological dissociation of the NMDA- and non-NMDA-receptor components of the EPSP showed that noradrenaline reduced both (mean EPSP slopes were 71 +/- 8% and 73 +/- 10% of their control, respectively). Alpha 1-, but not alpha-2- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists prevented the noradrenaline-induced decrease in synaptic efficacy. However, the effect of noradrenaline was not reproduced by alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists. Lastly, noradrenaline acting through beta-adrenoceptors reduced the slow hyperpolarization that follows a train of action potentials.",

Moreover, cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension (STOP-Hypertension) was set up by the Swedish Hypertension Society to investigate the value of antihypertensive treatment in the elderly. In this placebo controlled randomised prospective study 1,627 men and women aged 70-84 years with a supine blood pressure > or = 180/105 mmHg (and/or) but not isolated systolic hypertension participated. Three beta-blockers and one diuretic were used as blood pressure lowering agents and the average follow-up in the study was 25 months (3,390 patient-years). Administration of active antihypertensive therapy, reduced supine blood pressure from 195/102 mmHg to 167/87 mmHg at longest follow-up in comparison with placebo. A majority of the patients needed combined treatment to reach the goal blood pressure (160/95 mmHg). Associated with a fall in blood pressure were significant reductions in all cardiovascular primary endpoints (-40%, p = 0.0031), in fatal and non-fatal stroke (-47%, p = 0.0081) and in total mortality (-43%, p = 0.0079). In addition to the substantial effects on primary endpoints active treatment also showed clinically relevant effects on secondary endpoints (e.g. heart failure). The impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with antihypertensive treatment in this elderly cohort was greater than previously seen in middle-aged hypertensive patients, with maintained tolerability and a favourable cost-effectiveness ratio. Finally, women benefited from treatment at least as much as men.", 
    "55": "beta-blockers are one of the first-line therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of hypertension. Their role in this position appears stronger than earlier in view of the results of the three large intervention trials in elderly hypertensive patients (SHEP, STOP-Hypertension and MRC), which all used beta-blockers as one of their therapeutic alternatives. The secondary preventive effect of beta-blockers against coronary heart disease is well established, whereas convincing evidence from placebo-controlled trials regarding their primary preventive effect still is missing. In animal studies beta-blockers have been shown to prevent the development of coronary atherosclerosis and some of the newer agents have been shown to be markedly effective against experimentally induced myocardial ischemia. For reasons such as these, it appears safe to predict that beta-blockers will continue to play an important therapeutic role also in 1993 and beyond.",

The most lipid-soluble beta-blocker, propranolol, had an ED50 of 0.6 mmol/l. The most water-soluble one, atenolol, showed no inhibition at concentrations up to 16 mmol/l. Inhibition of respiratory control ratio, state IV respiration and ADP/O ratio occurred at 2 mmol/l for propranolol, 16 mmol/l for metoprolol and was not consistently observed for the other beta-blockers at the concentrations tested.

EXP063 inhibited the specific binding of [125I]Sar1,lle8-Ang II in rat adrenal membranes with Ki values of 3.9 +/- 0.6 nM for the Ang II type 1 and > 1 microM for the Ang II type 2 receptor binding sites. It displaced [3H]dihydroalprenolol in the rat cerebral frontal cortex with a Ki of 80 +/- 13 nM. EXP063 antagonized the contractile effect of Ang II competitively (pA2 = 8.9 +/- 0.1) and selectively in rabbit aorta and guinea pig ileum.

At 1 and 10 microM, it inhibited the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol in guinea pig atria. In pithed rats, EXP063 was more potent in blocking the pressor effect of Ang II than the positive chronotropic effect of isoproterenol.

In summary, this study demonstrates that EXP063 is a novel chemical entity possessing both the Ang II and beta adrenergic receptor blocking properties and, thus, represents a promising agent for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.", 
    "58": "Our objective was to study the mechanism of action of cholecystokinin (CCK) on the motility of the gastroduodenal area. Chickens were implanted with five electrodes for electromyography in the stomach and duodenum. The effects of CCK (10(-9) mol.kg-1.10 min-1) were studied against the presence of several antagonists and in vagotomized animals. CCK caused inhibition of gastric motility and duodenal hyperactivity. Vagotomy blocked CCK responses in the stomach but not in the duodenum. Hexamethonium partially blocked gastric inhibition induced by CCK. NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester blocked the inhibitory response to CCK in the stomach but did not modify duodenum response. L-Arginine did not modify CCK actions. Opioid antagonists naloxone and naltrindole and adrenergic antagonists phentolamine and propranolol did not modify CCK response. Atropine did not modify duodenal response to CCK. Sodium nitroprusside (10(-8)-10(-6) mol/kg) inhibited gastroduodenal activity in a dose-related manner. We suggest that gastric response to CCK is vagally mediated, mainly by the nitric oxide system. Duodenal hyperactivity seems to be a direct action of CCK. Nitric oxide is a putative neurotransmitter in the chicken gut.", 
    "59": "To investigate a possible physiological desensitization process for beta 3-adrenergic responses, the effect of cold acclimation of hamsters on adrenergically stimulated oxygen consumption of isolated brown fat cells was investigated. Cells were prepared from control and from cold-acclimated hamsters. In agreement with earlier findings, cells isolated from cold-acclimated hamsters responded to norepinephrine addition with a decreased sensitivity (approximately 10 times higher 50% effective concentration) and a decreased maximal rate of oxygen consumption compared with cells from control hamsters. When cells were stimulated with the general beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline or with the beta 3-selective agonists BRL-37344 or CGP-12177, a similarly desensitized response was observed, demonstrating that it was indeed a beta 3-adrenergic response that was functionally desensitized. However, when the mitochondria within the cells were directly stimulated with exogenous free fatty acids (palmitate or octanoate), no difference between cells from control and cold-acclimated animals was seen, indicating that a mediatory step must be desensitized. When the cells were stimulated with forskolin (to activate adenylyl cyclase) or with 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, the desensitized response was still observed. At post-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate levels, a desensitization was not evident. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity was increased in cells from cold-acclimated animals. It is therefore suggested that this increased activity of phosphodiesterase could be (at least partly) responsible for the physiologically induced desensitized responses observed here.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Current recommendations favor the use of beta blockers and antiplatelet agents, but some positive effects have been seen with use of anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers.

The clinical, Holter electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings, the pharmacologic treatments used, and the clinical outcomes for the 3 groups of patients were compared. During the follow-up period, which averaged 27 months, 31 deaths related to cardiac disease occurred. The 4 year survival rate was 76% in Group III, 49% in Group II and 35% in Group I; the difference in survival rate between Groups I and III was significant (p < 0.01). At the initial evaluation, no differences were found among the 3 groups in the incidences of advanced heart failure (NYHA functional class III or IV), atrial fibrillation or complex ventricular arrhythmias. Neither diastolic blood pressure nor heart rate differed among the 3 groups, but Group III patients were older and had significantly higher systolic blood pressures than Group I patients (p < 0.05, for both comparisons). There were no differences among the 3 groups in % fractional shortening, left ventricular end-systolic wall stress or left ventricular wall thickness, but left ventricular dimensions were significantly smaller in Group III than in Group I (p < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

All strains of Cunninghamella tested accumulated metabolite M4 = EMD 46193 ([4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropoxy)benzyloxy]ethanol). Among the strains investigated only Gliocladium deliquescens excreted the corresponding carbonic acid M1 = EMD 44025 into the culture medium.

    "68": "The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in rat submandibular granular ducts that was blocked by beta-adrenergic but not by alpha-adrenergic or muscarinic antagonists. This effect was only partially inhibited by the selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic antagonists atenolol and ICI-118,551, but was completely blocked by the combination of the two, suggesting the involvement of multiple (or atypical) beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes. The response to isoproterenol was mimicked by forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, but it was blocked by protein kinase inhibitors. The response of [Ca2+]i to isoproterenol was sustained in Ca(2+)-replete replete medium but transient in Ca(2+)-free medium, indicating the involvement of both Ca2+ entry and release from intracellular stores. However, isoproterenol stimulation produced no increase in ductal inositol phosphate levels. In addition, isoproterenol was still able to increase [Ca2+]i after the carbachol-induced depletion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive calcium stores. We conclude that isoproterenol, acting through cAMP, releases Ca2+ from an IP3-insensitive intracellular store in salivary granular ducts.", 
    "69": "The involvement of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in the stimulation of ventricular protein synthesis by aortic hypertension or adrenergic agonists in the adult rat heart was investigated. In either the retrogradely or anterogradely perfused heart, aortic hypertension increased protein synthesis rates by up to 19%. However, no changes in cAMP concentrations or in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity ratios could be detected either at early (< 5 min) or late (90 min) time points. Although isoproterenol, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, or forskolin raised cAMP concentrations (by up to 4.5-fold) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase ratios (by up to 4-fold), protein synthesis rates were not increased; however, under some perfusion conditions, glucagon did stimulate protein synthesis by 25%. Epinephrine stimulated protein synthesis by up to 32%, an effect that was not prevented by propranolol. Phenylephrine also stimulated protein synthesis, an effect that was prevented by prazosin but was unaffected by yohimbine. These findings implicate the alpha 1-adrenoceptor in the regulation of cardiac protein synthesis. Because changes in adenine nucleotide concentrations were similar in hearts perfused with epinephrine or with the agents that raised cAMP, it is unlikely that adenine nucleotide depletion is responsible for the failure to observe effects of the latter group of agents on protein synthesis. Although isoproterenol or forskolin raised cAMP concentrations in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes where ATP depletion was minimal, neither stimulated protein synthesis. alpha 1-Adrenergic agonists stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the heart (Brown, J. H., I. L. Buxton, and L. L. Brunton. Circ. Res. 57:532-537, 1985). Aortic hypertension doubled the rate of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the perfused heart. We suggest that the phosphoinositide-linked signal transduction pathway is more likely to be involved in stimulation of cardiac protein synthesis by hypertension or adrenergic agonism than the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP-linked pathway.", 
    "70": "The effects of nicotinamide (Nic) on cardiac contraction force and on slow inward current (Isi) in guinea pigs were studied with atrial strips and voltage clamp techniques. Verapamil (Ver), MnCl2, nifedipine (Nif), and propranolol (Pro) depressed markedly the positive inotropic effect induced by Nic in a noncompetitive manner. The pD2 values of Ver, MnCl2, Nif, and Pro were 6.19, 3.41, 5.00, and 6.43, respectively. The action of Nic was reduced by a low Ca2+ Tyrode solution and disappeared in a Ca(2+)-free solution. Nic 33 mmol.L-1 elevated the Isi from 6.5 +/- 1.3 microA to 10.3 +/- 2.2 microA. The results suggest that Nic promotes the Ca2+ influx and its site of action is different from that of both Pro and the calcium antagonists.", 
    "71": "1. The effect of octopamine on the release of endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) from isolated ileal synaptosomal preparations of guinea-pigs was examined using high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Release of ACh was induced by substance P or by depolarization with high potassium (50 mmol/L) in medium containing atropine, propranolol and naloxone. 2. Octopamine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of substance P-induced ACh release. A similar inhibitory action of octopamine was found in the samples depolarized by high potassium as a reference. 3. The action of octopamine was not reversed by the dopamine receptor antagonists either for the DA-2 subtype, domperidone, or for the DA-1 subtype, SCH23390, or by haloperidol. However, idazoxan and yohimbine antagonized this octopamine-induced inhibition at concentrations sufficient to abolish the action of clonidine. 4. Failure of guanethidine or nomifensine to inhibit octopamine ruled out mediation by noradrenergic neurotransmitters. 5. Octopamine decreased the influx of [45Ca] stimulated by substance P into synaptosomal preparations and this was reversed by idazoxan or yohimbine at concentrations sufficient to block the action of clonidine. 6. Pertussis toxin abolished the inhibitory action of octopamine at a dose high enough to block the action of clonidine. 7. These results indicate that octopamine suppresses the influx of calcium ions into cholinergic nerve terminals of ileal synaptosomes of guinea-pigs via an activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors coupled with a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein which results in a decrease of ACh release.", 
    "72": "According to a randomized double-blind cross-over design, the short-term (8 weeks, n = 12) and acute (2 h, n = 6) systemic and renal hemodynamic effects of carvedilol (25-50 mg o.d.) and metoprolol (100-200 mg o.d.) were compared in kidney allograft recipients with mild transplant dysfunction and arterial hypertension chronically treated with metoprolol. Cardiac output (Q) was measured by Doppler echography and renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured by constant infusion techniques using [123I]iodohippurate and [51Cr]EDTA, respectively. After 8 weeks, mean blood pressure (101 +/- 3 vs. 103 +/- mm Hg) and RBF (318 +/- 14 vs. 316 +/- 14 ml/min) were comparable for the two drugs, whereas heart rate (HR), Q, and GFR (39 +/- 2 vs. 42 +/- 2 ml/min, p < 0.05) were slightly lower and the RBF/Q ratio (6.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.8 +/- 0.4%, p < 0.05) was higher with carvedilol than with metoprolol. During short-term treatment, a single dose of metoprolol acutely decreased HR and Q, carvedilol increased RBF, and both carvedilol and metoprolol enhanced the RBF/Q ratio and decreased renal vascular resistance (by 23 and 7%, p < 0.01 carvedilol vs. metoprolol). These data suggest that carvedilol has beneficial acute renal hemodynamic effects in hypertensive kidney allograft recipients with mild transplant dysfunction.", 
    "73": "Several studies have shown that increased dietary calcium decreases blood pressure (BP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We compared the effects of a high calcium diet and different antihypertensive agents on BP and intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in lymphocytes of adult SHR. The calcium content of the normal chow was 1.1% and that of the high calcium chow was 2.5%. Antihypertensive drug treatments were performed by giving the animals trichlormethiazide (2 mg/kg/day), atenolol (25 mg/kg/day), and quinapril (10 mg/kg/day) in drinking water. Untreated SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats served as controls. After 14 weeks of study systolic BP (SBP) and [Ca2+]i in blood lymphocytes, measured with a fluorescent indicator quin-2, were higher in untreated SHR than in WKY rats. Trichlormethiazide, atenolol, quinapril, and the high calcium diet all decreased BP in SHR, but only quinapril and calcium-rich diet concurrently reduced [Ca2+]i. We conclude that the reduction in [Ca2+]i during high calcium intake does not result from decreased BP itself. If the changes in lymphocyte [Ca2+]i reflect Ca2+ metabolism in other tissues as well, especially in vascular smooth muscle, the normalization of [Ca2+]i may be involved in the BP-lowering mechanisms of oral calcium loading and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in genetic hypertension.", 
    "74": "beta 2-Adrenoceptor function may be decreased in primary hypertension, resulting in increased peripheral resistance. To study the beta 2-adrenoceptor function, we used circulating mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) as a model system. Twenty untreated hypertensive subjects [(HT) 10 men and 10 women] and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy normotensive (NT) volunteers were studied. The beta 2-adrenoceptor density was not significantly different between HT and NT, but the dissociation constants for the high- and low-affinity agonist binding states, studied by isoprenaline competition assays, were significantly higher in HT. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase with isoprenaline (10 microM, beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated stimulation) was not significantly different between the two groups. Forskolin-mediated direct stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was significantly higher in women than in men. For both sexes, the forskolin-induced cyclic AMP production was lower in the HT group, reaching statistical significance in the men. No major abnormalities were observed in beta 2-adrenoceptor function in mononuclear leukocytes. The putative relation between the decreased forskolin-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity and primary hypertension requires further study.", 
    "75": "In some patients with accessory pathways preexcitation occurs intermittently during sinus rhythm. In these patients the antegrade refractory period of the accessory pathway may either exceed the sinus cycle length under some circumstances, or conduction block in the accessory pathway may be variable. The ability of intravenous adenosine to unmask intermittent preexcitation was determined in patients with intermittent preexcitation but absent preexcitation at the time of study. Six patients undergoing assessment of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome received incremental doses of intravenous adenosine (3, 6, and 12 mg). Adenosine administration was repeated in three patients after intravenous beta blockade (propranolol 0.2 mg/kg). Adenosine unmasked preexcitation in all patients. P delta intervals with preexcited beats were substantially shorter than resting PR intervals in all cases (range 40-80 msec shorter). In 4/6 patients preexcitation was seen early, coincident with the onset of atrioventricular nodal block. In 4/6 patients preexcitation was seen late during the secondary sinus tachycardia that follows the direct cardiac effects of adenosine. Two patients exhibited early preexcitation and late preexcitation. Beta blockade failed to prevent early preexcitation (2/2 patients) but abolished preexcitation related to sinus tachycardia (3/3 patients). Early preexcitation, coincident with the onset of AV nodal block, suggests a direct effect of adenosine on accessory pathway conduction. Late preexcitation, occurring during secondary sinus tachycardia, and abolished by beta blockade, suggests enhanced accessory pathway conduction due to sympathetic activation.", 
    "76": "The present study investigates the inactivation and recovery of brain serotonin (5-HT) recognition sites by EEDQ (N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2,-dihydroquinoline). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single s.c. injection of vehicle (1:1 EtOH/H2O) or EEDQ (1-20 mg kg-1) and sacrificed at 4 h and 7 days (10 mg kg-1 dose) post-injection. EEDQ dose-dependently reduced the Bmax of 5-HT1A(3H-DPAT),5-HT1B(125I-CYP),5-HT2(3H-ketanserin) and 5-HT2/1C(125I-DOI) receptors in cortical homogenates. In contrast, EEDQ was without effect on the 5-HT transporter recognition site (3H-paroxetine). No significant changes in affinity were observed for 5-HT1B, 5-HT2 or 5-HT2/1C receptors. The rank order of sensitivity to EEDQ inactivation was: 5-HT1A > 5-HT1B > 5-HT2 approximately 5-HT2/1C > 5-HT uptake sites. This study demonstrates: (1) differential EEDQ inactivation and recovery of 5-HT receptors and (2) lack of EEDQ inactivation of the 5-HT transporter.", 
    "77": "The effects of stimulated Ca2+ influx on cytosolic ([Ca2+]c) or intramitochondrial free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) were examined in the new pancreatic beta-cell line, INS-1. [Ca2+]c was monitored by video imaging of single fura-2-loaded INS-1 cells, or in populations of cells transfected with non-targeted (cytosolic) aequorin. [Ca2+]m was measured after transfection with aequorin targeted to the mitochondria by fusion of the gene in frame with the signal peptide of cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII. Two physiological stimuli of native beta-cells, glucose and ATP, raised [Ca2+]c in INS-1 cells largely by stimulating Ca2+ influx. Thus, glucose (20 mM) induced repetitive transient increases in [Ca2+]c (0.42 min-1, mean amplitude 229 nM above 102 nM basal). These transients were largely due to periodic stimulation of Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, since they could be rapidly and reversibly blocked by chelation of external Ca2+, by addition of the hyperpolarizing agent diazoxide, or with the Ca2+ channel blocker SR 7037. ATP, by contrast, caused single transient [Ca2+]c increases, to about 300 nM above basal levels, which could be inhibited by > 90% upon external Ca2+ chelation. Challenge of aequorin-transfected cells with ATP increased [Ca2+]m to 4 microM or above, an effect blocked by EGTA. Furthermore, plasma membrane depolarization with high K+, used as a glucose surrogate to mimic, in a synchronized fashion, the influx-induced Ca2+ transients observed at the single-cell level, also increased [Ca2+]m to > 4 microM. Similar increases in [Ca2+]m were also measured in other aequorin-transfected insulin-secreting cells, RINm5F, during mobilization of internal Ca2+ with carbachol. In contrast, glucose-induced changes in [Ca2+]m were below the level of detection in INS-1 cell populations, consistent with the asynchrony of the [Ca2+]c transients induced by this nutrient at the single-cell level, and the consequent small average [Ca2+]c rise. These data are in line with the view that stimulated Ca2+ influx into excitable cells raises [Ca2+]m as efficiently as internal Ca2+ mobilization in nonexcitable cells. In the case of INS-1 and pancreatic beta-cells, this may be important both to enhance oxidative metabolism, hence fueling the secretory process, and also to maintain the production of metabolic signaling molecules.", 
    "78": "This study determined whether dopamine can influence epileptiform activity in vitro through an action at D1 receptors. Dopamine (50-1000 microM) and the selective D1 agonists SKF 38393, SKF 75670, SKF 80723 and SKF 82526 (10-250 microM) suppressed the paroxysmal discharges produced in rat cingulate cortex slices by the omission of Mg2+ from the bathing medium. These antiepileptic effects were mimicked by forskolin (10-100 microM), blocked by the D1 antagonist SCH 39166 (0.5 microM), facilitated by IBMX (500 microM) and unaffected by propranolol (2 microM), suggesting the participation of cyclic AMP in the D1 response. Possible mechanisms, including direct postsynaptic inhibition, modulatory enhancement of GABA activity and presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release are considered.", 
    "79": "Study was made of the effect of the pH of phosphate buffer (0.08 M) containing 15 mM cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as surfactant on the elution order of eleven widely used beta-adrenergic blocking agents. In the pH range 6.0-7.8 the elution order of six of the beta-blockers remained the same, while the order of five of them changed. Sotalol eluted as the sixth compound at pH 6.8 and migrated more quickly with increasing pH. Below pH 7.0 labetalol eluted before propranolol and above pH 7.0 afterwards. Likewise, the order of elution of atenolol and timolol was reversed at pH 7.0. The pH also affected the resolution; the best resolution values were achieved between pH 6.6 and 7.0 and between pH 7.4 and 7.8. The relationship between the structure of the beta-blockers described by molecular and molecular connectivity indices and the elution order and separation of the beta-blockers in micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography at varying pH of the buffer solution is discussed.",

Participants were examined at baseline and again 1 year later. The two examinations included standardized questionnaires, blood pressure measurements, and the assessment of medication use by medication inventory.

    "85": "Transient global forebrain ischemia induces in rat brain a large increase of expression of the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun and of the mRNAs for the 70-kDa heat-shock protein and for the form of the amyloid beta-protein precursor including the Kunitz-type protease-inhibitor domain. At 24 hr after ischemia, this increased expression is particularly observed in regions that are vulnerable to the deleterious effects of ischemia, such as pyramidal cells of the CA1 field in the hippocampus. In an attempt to find conditions which prevent the deleterious effects of ischemia, representatives of three different classes of K+ channel openers, (-)-cromakalim, nicorandil, and pinacidil, were administered both before ischemia and during the reperfusion period. This treatment totally blocked the ischemia-induced expression of the different genes. In addition it markedly protected neuronal cells against degeneration. The mechanism of the neuroprotective effects involves the opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels since glipizide, a specific blocker of that type of channel, abolished the beneficial effects of K+ channel openers. The various classes of K+ channel openers seem to deserve attention as potential drugs for cerebral ischemia.", 
    "86": "The effect of adrenomedullin, a novel peptide of 52 amino acids, on vascular tone was investigated in the perfused rat mesenteric vascular bed. In the vasculature contracted with methoxamine, perfusion of adrenomedullin (10(-11)-10(-7) M) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in perfusion pressure due to vasodilation. Additionally, a bolus infusion of adrenomedullin (300 and 500 pmol) produced a long-lasting vasodilator response, which was not affected in the presence of atropine (10(-7) M) and propranolol (10(-7) M). However, this response was inhibited in the presence of CGRP [8-37] (10(-6) M), an antagonist for CGRP receptor. These results suggest that adrenomedullin induces nonadrenergic and noncholinergic vasodilation in which CGRP receptors may be involved.",

No statistical differences between groups were observed in mast cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, plasma cells, lymphocytes, or fibroblasts (P > .05). Also, no statistical difference between groups existed in conjunctival structure, including mucopolysaccharide and collagen composition, vascular density, or epithelial thickness (P > .05). This study suggests that the number of conjunctival goblet cells may be related to intraocular pressure control after trabeculectomy.",

Mean procainamide and trough quinidine serum levels were 10.5 +/- 2.6 and 2.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml, respectively. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 37 +/- 12%. Sustained monomorphic VT was suppressed by intravenous procainamide in 18 patients (36%); 8 of these patients (44%) also had suppression with oral quinidine, but 10 (56%) did not. Of the 32 patients (64%) who continued to have inducibility with intravenous procainamide, 12 (38%) responded to oral quinidine and 22 (62%) did not. The overall concordant response rate to intravenous procainamide and oral quinidine was 56% (28 of 50 patients). It is concluded that the response (i.e., the presence or absence of inducible sustained monomorphic VT) to intravenous procainamide does not adequately predict the response to oral quinidine in patients with coronary artery disease and sustained monomorphic VT.",

In radioligand binding studies, the majority of beta-adrenoceptors in ventricles from rats as well as from CLAC hamsters was of the beta 1-subtype (72.2% and 76.6%, respectively). In BIO ventricles a significant (CLAC vs. BIO, P < 0.05) reduction in the beta 1-subtype (62.9%) was found. In Wistar rats the subtype-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase reflected the beta 1:beta 2 ratio as determined by binding studies. In hamster ventricles the effect of isoprenaline was mediated predominantly (CLAC) or exclusively (BIO) via the beta 2-subtype, indicating that cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors were partly (CLAC) or completely (BIO) uncoupled from the adenylyl cyclase.",

The present study examined the effects of amygdala kindling on two 5-HT receptor subtypes and on the 5-HT transporter in rat brain. Kindling induced a persistent bilateral increase in 5-HT1A binding in the dentate gyrus, while 5-HT1B receptors increased only in a delayed fashion. Binding to the 5-HT transporter was transiently decreased in dentate gyrus. In cerebral cortex, binding of the three ligands was unchanged. Alterations in 5-HT receptors and the 5-HT transporter may endogenously modulate kindled seizures. Additionally, autoradiography of adenosine A1 receptors revealed no change for these receptors in any brain region.", 
    "91": "To determine the effect of aging on T3 up-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor activity of purified synaptosomal membranes (SPM), beta-adrenergic receptor density (Bmax) and adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity were measured in young (6 months old) and aged (26 months old) male F-344 rats at baseline and after treatment with triiodothyronine (T3), 15 micrograms/100 g, intraperitoneally for 10 days. The Bmax (fmol/mg protein) as measured by 125I-iodocyanopindolol binding was reduced in aged rats (70.8 +/- 4.1) compared to young rats (93.5 +/- 11.2). T3 treatment resulted in a significant increase in Bmax of young rats but not in aged rats (P < 0.05). The AC activity (pmol cAMP/mg) in response to prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was reduced in aged rats compared to young rats (67.8 +/- 2.9 vs 108.3 +/- 18.6; P < 0.01). The sodium fluoride (NaF) stimulated AC activity was not altered with age. A net isoproterenol stimulated AC activity could not be demonstrated in any age group. T3 treatment did not alter AC activity of SPM. It is concluded that aging is associated with reduced responsiveness to T3-stimulated up-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor number in synaptosomal membranes.", 
    "92": "The study of the influence of intracellular pH (pHi) changes on the mechanism underlying pancreatic beta-cell bursting has been hampered by concomitant effects on the activity of background ATP-dependent K+ (K-ATP) channels. beta-cells were made to burst in the absence of active K-ATP channels by raising external Ca2+ in the presence of 11 mM glucose and tolbutamide. An alkalinizing pHi shift (exposure to 20 mM NH4Cl) increased the burst active phase duration. Conversely, an acidifying shift (NH4Cl withdrawal) suppressed the electrical activity. This is the mirror image of the effects recorded in the absence of tolbutamide. Glibenclamide and quinine suppressed the alkalinization-evoked hyperpolarization. This study emphasizes the differential sensitivity of different beta-cell ion channels to pHi and the prevalent role of K-ATP channels as electrical transducers of cytoplasmic pH changes under regular physiological conditions.", 
    "93": "Exogenous female hormone use appears to affect cardiovascular disease risk in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of exogenous female hormone usage on the lipid profile among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.", 
    "94": "One thousand nine hundred thirty female participants of the Framingham Offspring study comprised the study population. Of the 992 premenopausal subjects, 57 were current oral contraceptive users; among the 938 postmenopausal subjects, 80 were current hormone users. The influence of hormone use on lipid and lipoprotein levels was determined using multivariable linear regression models that adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, beta-blocker, and diuretic therapy. Adjusted least-squares means were calculated for each lipid and lipoprotein according to female hormone usage and menopausal status.", 
    "95": "In the premenopausal analysis, pooled oral contraceptive use was significantly related to increased levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I. Increased estrogen content was inversely associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels, while increased progestin content was inversely related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels. Among postmenopausal women, use of premarin only was significantly associated with increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels. Combination use of premarin and provera was significantly associated with increased apolipoprotein A-I levels; less powerful but still significant associations with increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were also observed.", 
    "96": "In this cross-sectional analysis, oral contraceptive use is associated with both favorable and unfavorable lipid alterations with respect to atherogenic risk. Among postmenopausal women, hormone replacement therapy (both premarin only and combined premarin and provera) appears to be associated with favorable effects on the lipid profile.", 
    "97": "The amygdaloid complex and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) are both important in stress reactions and we thus evaluated the effects of intra-amygdalar CRF on stress ulceration in rats. Bilateral micro-applications of CRF (0.05, 0.5 or 5.0 micrograms) into the central amygdala (CEA) attenuated cold restraint-induced gastric mucosal lesions in a dose-related manner. Similar gastric cytoprotective effects were seen with intra-CEA noradrenaline (NA; 3.0 micrograms), whereas the NA neurotoxin, DSP-4 (25 micrograms), or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (1 microgram), aggravated stress ulcer pathology. Intra-CEA pretreatment with DSP-4 or propranolol clearly reversed the ulceroprotective effects of CRF during stress. These results indicate that the CEA is a neural substrate for CRF effects, and CRF-NA interactions in this limbic area are crucial for the regulation of stress ulcerogenesis.", 
    "98": "Unlike mammalian mitochondria, yeast mitochondria swell spontaneously in both NaOAc and KOAc. This swelling reflects the activity of an electroneutral cation/H+ antiport pathway. Transport of neither salt is stimulated by depletion of endogenous divalent cations; however, it can be inhibited by addition of exogenous divalent cations (Mg2+ IC50 = 2.08 mM, Ca2+ IC50 = 0.82 mM). Transport of both Na+ and K+ can be completely inhibited by the amphiphilic amines propranolol (IC50 = 71 microM) and quinine (IC50 = 199 microM) with indistinguishable IC50 values. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibits with a second-order rate constant of 1.6 x 10(-4) (nmol DCCD/mg)-1 min-1 at 0 degrees C; however, with both Na+ and K+ inhibition reaches a maximum of about 46%. The remaining transport can still be inhibited by propranolol. Transport of both cations is sensitive to pH; yielding linear Hill plots and Dixon plots with a pIC50 value of 7.7 for both Na+ and K+. These properties are qualitatively the same as those of the non-selective K+/H+ antiporter of mammalian mitochondria. However, the remarkable similarity between the data obtained in Na+ and K+ media suggests that an antiporter akin to the Na(+)-selective Na+/H+ antiporter of mammalian mitochondria, which is inhibited by none of these agents, is absent in yeast. In an attempt to reveal the activity of a propranolol-insensitive Na(+)-selective antiporter, we compared the rates of Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiport in the presence of sufficient propranolol to block the K+/H+ antiporter. Between pH 4.6 and 8.8 no difference could be detected. Consequently, we conclude that yeast mitochondria lack the typical Na(+)-selective Na+/H+ antiporter of mammalian mitochondria.", 
    "99": "Vasoactive drugs have been suggested to modulate the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this study, we have tested whether a number of commonly used vasoactive drugs interact with epirubicin- and radiation-induced toxicity on Chinese hamster fibroblast cell line V-79. The adrenoceptor agonist epinephrine, enchanced die effects of irradiation as measured by cloning capacity. In contrast, epineprine and terbutaline decreased epirubicin cytotoxicity. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and the alpha-antagonist phentolamine, at 100 mumol/l, caused a significant enhancement of epirubicin cytotoxicity. None of the vasoactive drugs showed intrinsic cytotoxic effects. Radiation-induced cytotoxicity was unaffected by propranolol or phentolamine. The calcium channel blocker, verapamil, enhanced the toxicity induced by epirubicin and radiation. These results indicate that vasoactive drugs such as epinephrine, propranolol and phentolamine can interfere with radiotherapy and with anthracycline cytotoxicity. Further studies are warranted before conclusions on the mechanisms of action can be drawn.", 
    "100": "1. The acute haemodynamic effects of intravenous nisoldipine (1, 2, 4 microg kg(-1)) and nifedipine (2.5, 5, 10 microg kg(-1)) were compared in a randomised, within-patient crossover study. Fifteen male patients with stable angina pectoris treated with atenolol were studied after undergoing routine cardiac catheterisation. 2. Nisoldipine caused a dose-related fall in systemic vascular resistance (maximum 22%) associated with an increase in heart rate and cardiac index (18%) and a fall in mean arterial pressure (7%). 3. By contrast, nifedipine was associated with a significant increase in heart rate but systemic vascular resistance, cardiac index and mean arterial pressure remained unaltered. 4. At doses with equivalent effects on heart rate (2 microg kg(-1) nisoldipine; 10 microg kg(-1) nifedipine) acute dosing with nisoldipine caused a significantly greater fall in systemic vascular resistance and increase in cardiac index, whilst nifedipine caused a greater reduction in stroke volume index and left ventricular stroke work index. 5. The results suggest that, when combined with atenolol, acute dosing with nisoldipine may have a more complementary haemodynamic profile than nifedipine. The implications of this finding for chronic oral dosing in patients with impaired left ventricular function should be evaluated.", 
    "101": "Previous studies have indirectly implicated the two neurotransmitters 5-HT and GABA in mediating tonic inhibition of the crayfish lateral giant (LG) escape reaction. In this study, pharmacological agents were selectively delivered to restricted portions of the abdominal CNS (where LG escape circuitry resides) to assess directly the role of these two transmitters in tonic inhibition. Both 5-HT and GABA depressed monosynaptic, electrical transmission to the LG neurons, the command neurons for LG escape, and application of either transmitter resulted in a depolarizing conductance increase in the LG neuron. The effects of 5-HT persisted in preparations in which chemical transmission was effectively abolished, implying that there are 5-HT receptors on the LG neuron itself, along with the known GABA receptors. Restricted delivery of the GABA chloride channel blocker picrotoxin to only the abdominal CNS blocked the expression of tonic inhibition there (without interfering with the rostral generation of tonic inhibition). Therefore, if 5-HT mediated tonic inhibition, the effects of 5-HT on the abdomen should also be antagonized by picrotoxin. However, this was not the case, thus suggesting that 5-HT does not mediate tonic inhibition. The most likely neurotransmitter used for tonic inhibition is GABA acting via ligand-gated chloride channels. Thus, although this form of behavioral modulation can be tonically active for very long periods, it nevertheless appears to be mediated by a classical synaptic mechanism.", 
    "102": "Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant form of muscular dystrophy associated with a mutation that affects a gene on chromosome 19. Extremely low intraocular pressure is one of a constellation of clinical signs that sometimes accompany this disorder. This study was performed to determine if the ocular hypotony can be explained by aqueous humor hyposecretion.", 
    "103": "Seventeen persons with myotonic dystrophy and seventeen age-matched controls were studied. Intraocular pressure, light scattering (flare), fluorescein clearance at various times of day, and the response of the eye to the topical timolol were measured.", 
    "104": "Intraocular pressure was 40% lower in the persons with myotonic dystrophy (8.4 mm Hg vs 14.0 mm Hg) and flare was 50% higher (55.8 mg/dl albumin equivalent vs 37.1 mg/dl albumin equivalent). Fluorescein clearance in persons with myotonic dystrophy was indistinguishable from normal at all times of day. Myotonic eyes responded normally to topical timolol. The physiological data of this study are most consistent with the conclusion that the rate of aqueous humor flow is reduced approximately 9%, and the rate of inward leakage of light scattering proteins is increased approximately 37% in well-established myotonic dystrophy with ocular hypotony.", 
    "105": "The reduced aqueous humor flow alone is insufficient to explain the ocular hypotony. We hypothesize that the hypotony is due primarily to atrophy of the ciliary muscle that increases fluid exchange between the anterior chamber and the anterior uvea with consequent enhancement of uveoscleral outflow.", 
    "106": "We studied the steady-state hepatic extraction and single-pass hepatic uptake of propranolol in isolated perfused livers from normal rats and compared these values with those of rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis, rats treated with chlorpromazine (an inhibitor of propranolol metabolism) and rats with acute liver injury. The kinetics of propranolol transport in the liver were characterized by means of the multiple-indicator dilution technique, and estimates of cellular influx, efflux and sequestration rate constants were obtained with a computer fit to the model of Goresky. The outflow pattern of propranolol in the hepatic veins was then resolved into throughput material, which had swept past the hepatocytes along with albumin, and returning material, which had entered the cells but returned in the outflow after escaping metabolic sequestration. The steady-state extraction of propranolol was significantly decreased in the three experimental groups compared with that in controls, but the outflow profile differed within each group. In cirrhotic animals, influx was markedly decreased and the sequestration rate constant remained unchanged; most of the propranolol in the outflow consisted of throughput material. In rats treated with chlorpromazine, the sequestration rate constant was decreased, and propranolol in the outflow was mainly returning material. In rats with acute liver injury, both influx and sequestration rate constants were decreased. Indicator dilution curves for nonsequestered tracers showed a decreased transit time for red blood cells and abnormal diffusion of albumin and sucrose into the space of Disse in cirrhotic rats compared with the other groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "107": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), in the form of either GLP-1-(7-36)amide or GLP-1-(7-37), has been shown to potently stimulate insulin release in a glucose-dependent manner and is suggested to be a physiological incretin. To explore the mechanisms by which GLP-1-(7-36)amide stimulates insulin release, we investigated its action on the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in single rat pancreatic beta-cells by the dual wavelength microfluorometry with fura-2. In the presence of 8.3 mM glucose, GLP-1-(7-36)amide at a concentration as low as 3 x 10(-12) M produced a rapid transient increase in [Ca2+]i in some of the single beta-cells. GLP-1-(7-36)amide at 10(-11) M or more evoked the [Ca2+]i response in the majority of beta-cells. In the presence of 2.8 mM glucose, GLP-1-(7-36)amide was without effect. The [Ca2+]i response to GLP-1-(7-36)amide was completely and reversibly inhibited under Ca(2+)-free conditions and by 1 microM nitrendipine, a blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels. Elevation of cAMP in beta-cells by either 10 microM forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, or 5 mM (bu)2cAMP (db-cAMP) produced an increase in [Ca2+]i similar to that caused by GLP-1-(7-36)amide. The db-cAMP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was also completely blocked by nitrendipine. In the continuous presence of GLP-1-(7-36)amide and after the transient [Ca2+]i increase it elicited, db-cAMP failed to evoke the [Ca2+]i response. It is concluded that GLP-1-(7-36)amide at physiological concentrations and a rise in cAMP increase [Ca2+]i in pancreatic beta-cells by enhancing the activity of L-type Ca2+ channels in the beta-cell plasma membrane. It is suggested that the cAMP-operative mechanism is involved in the GLP-1-(7-36)amide action to increase [Ca2+]i in beta-cells.", 
    "108": "Propranolol and lidocaine are effective antiarrhythmic drugs in myocardial ischemia and infarction. As sympathetic nerve activation and norepinephrine release in ischemic hearts are arrhythmogenic, we tested the possibility that both agents inhibit neural norepinephrine release following sympathetic activation in the ischemic environment.", 
    "109": "The model used was an in situ perfused innervated rat heart. Norepinephrine release was induced by electrical stimulation of the left cervicothoracic stellate ganglion and analyzed using radioenzymatic assay or high-performance liquid chromatography. In normoxically perfused hearts, evoked norepinephrine release was not affected by either of the two agents at doses of 1 to 10 mumol/L when extracellular K+ concentration was 4 mmol/L but dose-dependently reduced at 10 mmol/L K+ (D,L-propranolol: -53 +/- 4% at 1 mumol/L and -64 +/- 6% at 10 mumol/L K+, lidocaine: -37 +/- 11% at 0.1 mumol/L, -67 +/- 5% at 1 mumol/L, and -75 +/- 6% at 10 mumol/L). At 10 mmol/L K+, norepinephrine release was not affected by timolol or atenolol (both 10 mumol/L but was equally inhibited by D- or L-propranolol at 10 mumol/L (-56 +/- 5% and -53 +/- 9%, respectively), indicating a beta-blocking-independent mechanism. In hearts with metabolic acidosis (pH 6.85) at K+ of 4 mmol/L, neural norepinephrine release was also reduced by propranolol at 10 mumol/L (-37%). Finally, in hearts perfused with 4 mmol/L K+ and subjected to 6-minute periods of ischemia, neural norepinephrine release was similarly suppressed by D,L-propranolol (-38 +/- 6% at 0.1 mumol/L, -44 +/- 5% at 1 mumol/L, and -78 +/- 3% at 10 mumol/L) or lidocaine (-39 +/- 7% at 0.1 mumol/L, -58 +/- 9% at 1 mumol/L, and -91 +/- 3% at 10 mumol/L).", 
    "110": "These data indicate that propranolol and lidocaine inhibit neural norepinephrine release via a Na+ channel-blocking mechanism that is synergistic with changes induced by ischemia, primarily raised extracellular K+. This mechanism may contribute to the anti-ischemic and antiarrhythmic properties of both agents in acute myocardial ischemia, which induces increased extracellular K+ and sympathetic activation.", 
    "111": "The role of catecholamines in ischemic preconditioning is unclear. Accordingly, the effects of tyramine-induced norepinephrine release and alpha 1-receptor blockade were examined. Ischemic preconditioning with a 5-minute coronary occlusion 10 minutes before a 30-minute ischemic interval resulted in only 7.7 +/- 3.1% infarction of the risk area, significantly less than that in control rabbits with isolated 30-minute coronary occlusions (34.4 +/- 3.2%, P < .01). Intravenous infusion of tyramine 10 minutes before 30 minutes of ischemia also protected the heart from infarction to an extent similar to that seen with ischemic preconditioning (6.9 +/- 2.4% infarction). This protection observed with tyramine infusion was eliminated by alpha 1-receptor blockade with BE 2254 (36.8 +/- 2.6% infarction) but was unaffected by beta-blockade with propranolol (10.5 +/- 2.4% infarction). Furthermore, the protection was unaffected when the tyramine-induced hypertension was attenuated by allowing blood to flow into a volume reservoir (3.9 +/- 0.8% infarction, P < .01 vs control value). The nonselective adenosine-receptor blocker PD 115,199 also eliminated tyramine-induced protection (40.2 +/- 5.6% infarction), indicating that adenosine is involved in adrenergic-mediated protection. BE 2254 could not block ischemic preconditioning (3.9 +/- 1.1% infarction, P < .01 vs control value). Therefore, catecholamine release before prolonged ischemia can protect the heart from infarction via the alpha 1-receptor, but adenosine receptor stimulation is also involved. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation does not appear to be critical to the protection observed after ischemic preconditioning."
