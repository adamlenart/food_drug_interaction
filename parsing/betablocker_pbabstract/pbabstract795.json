    "0": "Ninety-five nonobese, nonketotic subjects were divided into five groups (one normal and four with varying degrees of glucose intolerance) according to their plasma glucose responses during an oral glucose tolerance test. These five groups were then compared on the basis of their insulin response during the oral glucose tolerance test and on the ability of exogenously infused insulin to limit hyperglycemia during a continuous infusion of glucose and insulin, while endogenous insulin was inhibited by the infusion of epinephrine and propranolol. The mean plasma insulin response of patients with either borderline abnormalities of glucose tolerance or chemical diabetes was equal to or greater than that of normal subjects at all points during the glucose tolerance test. Thus, the glucose tolerance of these two patient groups cannot be attributed to lack of insulin. On the other hand, the mean insulin response of patients with moderate fasting hyperglycemia (plasma glucose of 110 to 150 mg/100 ml) was somewhat attenuated, and patients with severe fasting hyperglycemia (plasma glucose greater than 150 mg/100 ml) had unequivocal insulin deficiency. In contrast, all four patient groups with abnormal carbohydrate metabolism were more resistant than normal subjects to the action of insulin. These results indicate that there is a very complex relationship between insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in patients currently classified as having nonketotic diabetes. Patients with either borderline abnormal glucose tolerance or chemical diabetes are more resistant to insulin than normal subjects, and are not insulin deficient. In these patients it seems reasonable to assume that their glucose intolerance is a direct function of their insulin resistance. Patients with severe fasting hyperglycemia are suffering from both insulin deficiency and insulin resistance, and the relationship between these two variables in the genesis of hyperglycemia in these subjects remains obscure. It seems apparent from these studies that nonketotic diabetes mellitus can no longer be considered to be a simple function of insulin lack, and that in order to understand this syndrome we will need to increase our knowledge of the relationship between insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in these patients.", 
    "1": "Thirty patients suffering from essential hypertension were treated successively with placebo, hydralazine alone, and pindolol (Visk\u00e9n) combined with hydralazine. As compared to placebo hydralazine brought about a statistically significant reduction in blood pressure and an increase in pulse rate; palpitation was an irritating side-effect. Combining hydralazine and pindolol caused an additional fall in blood pressure (2 p less than 0.001) and the pulse rate decreased (2 p less than 0.001). This combination treatment had a favourable effect on the palpitation and angina pectoris also.", 
    "2": "Ten patients with typical angina pectoris and without hypertension, congestive heart failure or other disease were treated with alternating four-week courses of metoprolol (alpha beta1 cardioselective beta-blocking agent), propranolol and placebo. Midway through each four-week period, drug dosage was doubled; thus, regimes were metoprolol, 150 and 300 mg/day, propranolol, 120 and 240 mg per day and placebo, 3 and 6 tablets per day. Serum concentrations of metoprolol increased with increasing dosage in a proportion very similar to that seen with propranolol. Statistically significant reductions in angina frequency/nitroglycerin consumption, and statistically significant increases in total work performed on a bicycle ergometer, were found with both active compounds when compared with placebo. No significant differences were noted between the two active compounds. Though most patients showed greatest improvement on the higher of the two drug dosages, three patients with metoprolol and two with propranolol responded best on the lower dose regime. Both compounds reduced heart rate at rest and during exercise. Neither reduced arterial pressure at rest, but both reduced arterial pressure during exercise. It is concluded that metoprolol is as effective as propranolol in the reduction of angina attacks and improvement in exercise tolerance during chronic therapy in patients with uncomplicated angina pectoris. It is now appropriate to study the effects of metoprolol in patients with coronary artery disease in whom the harmful effects of non-selective beta-blockade heretofore have precluded optimal therapy with beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "3": "In hypertensive patients, whose blood pressure was decreased by racemic propranolol, the dextrorotatory isomer had no antihypertensive effect. The differences in antihypertensive activity of racemic and dextrorotatory propranolol cannot be explained by different plasma levels. The data indicate that the hypotensive effect of propranolol is due to beta-receptor blockade.", 
    "4": "The antianginal effect of three drugs (isosorbide dinitrate-nifedipine-oxprenolol) and of two drug associations (isosorbide dinitrate-oxprenolol; nifedipine-oxprenolol) was studied in six patients, by means of a bicycle ergometer exercise test. The study was double blind; placebo was also included in the test. Treatments were administered according to the sequence of a 6 X 6 \"balanced\" latin-square design. After treatment with isosorbide dinitrate and nifedipine a significant delay in the appearance of angina and of signs of electrocardiographic positivity was observed while after treatment with oxprenolol a significant delay was noticed only in the time of appearance of electrocardiographic positivity. On the contrary, placebo did not determine significant changes in the studied parameters. The best results were achieved with the associations oxprenolol-isosorbide dinitrate and oxprenolol-nifedipine. With these treatments, angina appeared during the exercise test in only two patients while the others had to stop the test because of muscular exhaustion; electrocardiographic signs of ischemia did not appear in one patient. The favourable results of the associations oxprenolol-isosorbide dinitrate and oxprenolol-nifedipine can be explained by the pharmacologic effect of these drugs and by their complementary action.", 
    "5": "Angiotensin antagonists have become useful tools in studying pharmacologic and pathophysiologic roles of the renin-angiotensin axis. Several of these uses are described herein. Their value as t-ols in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis is yet to be determined.", 
    "6": "The pharmacokinetics of propranolol can be quantitatively explained on a physiological basis from a knowledge of the effects of four biological determinants: (1) the activity of the drug metabolising enzymes (intrinsic clearance); (2) hepatic blood flow; (3) drug binding, and (4) the anatomical arrangement of the hepatic circulation. Distrubances of all these determinants can occur in chronic liver disease and result in predictable changes in propranolol disposition. These changes, as well as those occurring with other drugs in chronic liver may be explained by 'intact hepatocyte theory' which postulates that the major pathophysiological change occurring in compensated chronic liver disease is a reduction in relatively normally perfused and functioning cell mass with the development of intrahepatic portasystemic vascular shunts.", 
    "7": "The beta-adrenergic blocking drug pindolol has been used in the treatment of hypertension, using one single dose per day, given in the morning. 16 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were treated with doses which were increased if necessary up to 20 mg, and 14 patients achieved an adequate level of blood-pressure control. The trial was carried out as a single-blind cross-over study. The study shows that pindolol, a non-selective beta-blocker of high potency, may be given once daily as a hypotensive, offering advantages both for patients and physicians. Side-effects were infrequent.", 
    "8": "The efficacy and duration of the effects of verapamil on angina threshold during exercise were examined in five patients with proved angina pectoris, with the experimental model of a latin square 5 X 5. The effects of verapamil (0,1 mg/kg i.v.) were compared with those of a placebo (20 ml saline i.v.), of isosorbide dinitrate (5 mg, sublingual), of propranolol (0,1 mg/kg i.v.), and of dipyridamol (20 mg i.v.). All the treatments were studied within 20 minutes after administration; the efficacy of the \"drugs\" was checked against placebo. Verapamil and isosorbide dinitrate significantly prolonged the duration of exercise and total amount of work done before angina and EKG alteration appearance. Similar changes were observed after propranolol, but not significantly different from the effects of placebo. Dipyridamol reduced thw work performance, without significant difference from placebo. The effects of verapamil, though less marked than its peak effects, were still present 70 minutes after administration. The possible mechanism of work performance improvements induced by verapamil in angina pectoris is briefly discussed on the basis of the Triple Product changes observed during exercise.", 
    "9": "A crossover comparison of metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide has been performed in 20 patients with mild hypertension. Both drugs caused almost identical statistically significant reduction in blood pressure of about 20 mm Hg systolic and 15 mm Hg diastolic. The side effects during active therapy were few and mild, but 5 patients experienced subjective symptoms during the first few days following abrupt withdrawal of metoprolol, namely general malaise, palpitations, headache, sweating and tremor. The symptoms were more pronounced in the standing position and disappeared at once on resumption of beta-blocker therapy, or gradually over 5 - 7 days when placebo tablets were given. In 11 of the 20 patients hydrochlorothiazide produced subnormal serum potassium levels and potassium supplements were given. The serum uric acid level was also significantly increased during hydrochlorothiazide treatment.", 
    "10": "The hypotensive actions of metoprolol and alpha-methyldopa have been compared in 37 men with previously untreated essential hypertension; 36 belonged to stage 1 and 1 to stage 2 of the WHO classification. After four weeks of placebo treatment the patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either of the two drugs. Treatment was started with metoprolol 75 mg daily or alpha-methyldopa 375 mg and was doubled after eight weeks. Satisfactory blood pressure control was defined as systolic blood pressure below 160 mm Hg and diastolic below 95 mm Hg. The patients were examined every four weeks and in those with unsatisfactory control the dose was gradually increased up to a maximum daily dose of metoprolol 450 mg or alpha-methyldopa 2250 mg. The trial lasted for 24 weeks after randomization. Five patients dropped out of the study. After six months, satisfactory blood pressure control was recorded in 16 out of 17 patients and 14 out of 15 patients treated with metoprolol and alpha-methyldopa, respectively. The average reduction in blood pressure produced by the two drugs was comparable. One patient in the alpha-methyldopa group developed drug exanthema and two patients a positive Coombs' test. Other side effects were few and did not differ between the two compounds.", 
    "11": "Acupuncture at Jen Chung (Go-26) in dogs under halothane anesthesia produces sympathomimetic-like effects on the cardiovascular system. This response can be inhibited by pretreatment with propranolol and to a lesser extent with phentolamine. Severe hypotension and cardiac arrest produced by hypoxia in dogs under halothane anesthesia can be reversed by acupuncture at Jen Ying (St-9). This also was interpreted as a sympathomimetic-like effect. Acupuncture at Tsu San Li (St-36) results in a parasympathomimetic-like effect on the cardiovascular system which can be inhibited by atropine. A parasympatholytic-like effect resembling that produced by atropine can be obtained in dogs with sinus arrhythmia and pulsus alternans by acupuncture at Yang Hsi (LI-5).", 
    "12": "The effect of metoprolol on pulmonary function was compared with that of propranolol and placebo in twelve patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Propranolol caused a significant reduction in FEV1 compared with metoprolol and placebo. Metoprolol gave a slight reduction compared with placebo. FVC was not significantly influenced by metoprolol, but propranolol caused a significant depression compared both with metoprolol and placebo. The isoprenaline-mediated increase in FEV1 and FVC was not significantly altered after metoprolol compared with placebo. After propranolol the isoprenaline-mediated increases in FEV1 and FVC were 40 and 24% lower respectively than after metoprolol and placebo. Unwanted effects and pulmonary symptoms were at an acceptable level in all cases except in two patients who had to be given i.v. theophyllamine therapy during propranolol treatment. It is concluded that metoprolol exhibits a selective beta1-blocking action and thus may be given to patients with chronic obstructive lung disease provided that adequate beta2-stimulator treatment is given concomitantly.", 
    "13": "Thirty patients suffering from intractable, repetitive migraine took part in a double-blind single-crossover trial to compare the effect of propranolol (at 120 mg per day) with that of placebo. During propranolol treatment the frequency of migraine attacks was reduced significantly, by more that 50% in 9 patients and by less that 50% in a further 9. In the remainder propranlol showed no advantage over placebo. It is concluded that, as propranolol has only few and mild side effects, it is a useful drug for preventing migraine attacks. As the pathogenesis of migraine is not completely understood, the mode of action of propranolol in preventing attacks cannot be fully explained. It has been possible, however, to relate some of the effects of beta-receptor antagonism to current knowledge of the condition.", 
    "14": "Since 1964, of 725 patients presenting with anxiety syndromes, 513 were treated with propranolol for periods of several days to over 10 years, some intermittently, others virtually without interruption. Of these, 237 had previously received or were receiving psychotropic drugs, mostly benzodiazepines and/or phenothiazines, which had proved ineffective or deleterious. Dosage was adjusted to achieve an optimum clinical response and a relatively high degree of beta-blockade, as judged by the virtual abolition of orthostatic and hyperventilatory tachycardia. As a rule, 80-320 mg daily sufficed, but increments up to 1200 mg were temporarily required to control bizarre or unusually intense symptoms. With few exceptions, the somatic and psychic symptoms were relieved or moderated and overall functional capacity was restored. Depression, evident in 50% of the patients, usually lifted, but persisted in one-third as a lone symptom responsive to antidepressants. Propranolol requirements usually diminished and lasting remissions were not infrequent. The effects of propranolol contrasted sharply with those experienced by the patients receiving tranquillizers. Single-blind placebo trials involving 76 cases endorsed the specificity of the response to beta-blockade. This long term study reveals that effective control of the somatic and psychic symptoms of anxiety can be achieved with propranolol in appropriate dosage.", 
    "15": "In the withdrawal phase of chronic alcoholism, hyperkinetic circulation, characterized by increased cardiac output, is the rule. Even in alcoholics who have been sober for a long time, increased cardiac output is very common and these changes are similar to those seen in some patients with labile hypertension. This could be caused by psychic tension. In the withdrawal phase propranolol was found to normalize the circulation and to reverse the decreased peripheral vascular resistance. We observed that the patients seemed to be calm after 40 mg of propranolol by mouth. In a double blind study of propranolol and placebo this effect was confirmed and in another study 120 mg of propranolol a day was compared to 30 mg of diazepam a day (double-blind, crossover). Using different psychological methods all significant differences are in favour of propranolol. The findings are in agreement with other reports. It is our clinical impression that propranolol is a useful drug for psychic tension symptoms in chronic alcoholism. Very few side effects have been found.", 
    "16": "Like hypertension which is a multifactorial disease, the blood pressure response to propranolol cannot be explained by one mechanism alone to the exclusion of all others. Acute (intravenous) administration of propranolol lowers cardiac output and slows heart rate but does not significantly alter blood pressure. With continued therapy however, blood pressure (in responders) is gradually reduced while cardiac output and rate remains low, indicating a readaptation of total peripheral resistance (TPR) to the new haemodynamic conditions. This relatively complex interplay of factors and the predominant role of TPR in blood pressure response help explain why haemodynamic indices (such as elevated heart rate and cardiac output) were found of little value in predicting response to therapy and the failure of propranolol to control transient pressor responses associated with stress; although the increase of output in response to stress was blocked pressure rose due to increase in TPR. Therefore, despite the obvious cardiac effects of beta-adrenergic blockade, a blood pressure response to propranolol cannot be used as an index of cardiac participation in that hypertension. The long-term changes in TPR were significantly (P less than 0-02) correlated with reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA). This association does not necessarily imply a causal relationship since PRA suppression occurs at lower doses and much more rapidly than alterations in blood pressure. Further, the hypotensive effect obtained by adding propranolol to diuretic therapy was not associated with a significant reduction in PRA. However, the absence of correlation in a group of patients between blood pressure response to propranolol and its effect on other biological variables does not mean that these variables have no role in the hypotensive response. In fact, in some specific conditions the change in one variable might assume particular importance; thus in the markedly hyperkinetic circulation induced by potent vasodilators, reducing cardiac rate and output may play a major role in controlling persistent hypertension.", 
    "17": "The use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs in angina pectoris was one of the original indications for these drugs suggested by Black. An anti-anginal effect was demonstrated with the first beta-adrenergic blocking drug, pronethalol, that was used clinically. This benefit in angina was confirmed in the early trials with propranolol in 1964-65. Although some definite anti-anginal effect can be demonstrated with low fixed dosage, evidence suggested that those trials which used a higher and a variable dose displayed a greater anti-anginal action of the drug. After a two dose trial (Gillam and Prichard, 1966,) demonstrated a dose dependent anti-anginal effect, a log-dose response study demonstrated a progressive reduction in angina attacks as dosage was increased (Prichard and Gillam, 1971). While a highly significant effect was found with an average dose of 52 mg a day a progressive reduction in angina attacks was found with logarithmic increases in dosage up to an average of 417 mg a day. Dosage in this trial was adjusted to produce a supine heart rate of 55-60 beats/minute provided this was not prevented by side effects. As the dosage of 417 mg a day was still on the straight line part of the dose response curve and therefore suboptimal, we not adjust dosage to produce a standing heart rate of 55-60. Fully meaningful comparative trials require that optimum dose of the drugs being compared are used. A variable dose comparative trial comparing propranolol and practolol, showed propranolol was the more effective agent. More recently a variable dose comparative trial of sotalol and propranolol indicated propranolol had greater anti-anginal action although sotalol, unlike practolol, was more effective than low dose propranolol. The use of beta-blocking agents in angina pectoris is relatively safe provided that the contraindications of asthma and cardiac insufficiency are observed and that treatment is commenced at a low dosage. The most dramatic change in the sympathetic environment of the heart takes place when treatment with a beta-blocking drug is commenced. The greatest danger of precipitating heart failure is therefore at the beginning of treatment even with a small starting dose. Once treatment has begun even an increase of 25% per dose represents a small pharmacological increment as there is no great change in the sympathetic drive to the heart. The larger dosage of beta-blocking drugs required for optimum treatment of angina may be gradually approached, but it has been my experience that heart failure is not likely to be precipitated at larger doses, provided they are not used initially. In other than mild angina pectoris the average optimum dosage of propranolol is 500-800 mg a day, similar, or perhaps more than the average dose in hypertension.", 
    "18": "The pharmacokinetics of propranolol vary according to the route and duration of administration. After i.v. administration, the decline in drug concentrations is biphasic and the drug is cleared very efficiently by the liver, so that its elimination is dependent largely on liver blood flow. Although the drug is some 90-95% bound to plasma, hepatic removal is so avid that both bound and free forms are extracted. Consequently, hepatic elimination is unaffected by drug binding in blood, In contrast, the distribution of drug into the tissues is reduced by plasma binding, so that drug half-life (T 1/2), which varies from 11/2-3 hours among individuals is more prolonged in people with relatively low plasma binding. Recent evidence shows that at all times after i.v. administration the beta-blocking effects of propranolol are related to its plasma concentrations according to the receptor theory. In addition individual differences in the response due to a given total concentration are largely due to variations in plasma binding, the drug's effects being a function of free (unbound) drug in plasma water. After the administration of single oral doses, hepatic extraction remains high and much of the dose is eliminated from hepatic portal blood during transfer from the gut, so that little drug reaches the systemic circulation. In addition, significant amounts of an active metabolite, 4-OH propranolol, are produced so that 2 hours after dosing, propranolol appears more potent that its plasma levels would suggest. With continued administration, the avid removal process becomes saturated, extraction ratio falls and propranolol accumulates some 2-fold. Drug T 1/2 is prolonged to 3-6 hours under these conditions, the ratio of propranolol to its active metabolite increases so that most of its effects can be attributed to the parent drug. Perhaps the most important kinetic fact to emerge is the 20-fold variation in plasma levels found after chronic administration of the same oral dose to different patients. This accounts for most of the individual variation in dosage requirements. Concerning propranolol withdrawal, there is no evidence that the effects of the drug last longer than appropriate for its T 1/2, so that larger doses last longer. Nonetheless, 24-48 hours is more that sufficient for the effects of the drug to dissipate. In view of the rebound angina, arrhythmias and infarction that may occur, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided if possible.", 
    "19": "Propranolol is known to decrease ischaemic damage in developing myocardial infarction. Besides acting on mechanical parameters which help determine the balance of oxygen supply and oxygen demand in the ischaemic tissue, propranolol decreases the myocardial uptake of free fatty acids and increases that of glucose. It is suggested that propranolol may favourably alter developing myocardial infarction in dogs by altering the supply of substrates reaching the ischaemic zone. However, propranolol also decreases enzyme release from isolated rat hearts with coronary ligation at a relative constant arterial free fatty acid concentration. Propranolol causes more marked depression of mechanical function and of heart rate in hearts perfused with free fatty acids than with glucose. It is suggested that the glucose-promoting and anti-lipolytic actions of propranool might be important not only in decreasing infarct size but also in helping to prevent undesirable side effects in hearts with experimental myocardial infarction.", 
    "20": "Propranolol is an antihypertensive drug whose mode of action in lowering arterial pressure remains undecided. Animal experiments indicate that an action within the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to the hypotensive effect. Intravenous infusion of propranolol to the conscious rabbit lowers arterial pressure and this is accompanied by a decrease in preganglionic sympathetic nervous activity. This indicates that propranolol decreases sympathetic nervous outflow by a central action and since the dextro isomer of propranolol does not exert such an effect then this action must be related to beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "21": "When plasma renin activity is related to sodium balance as evaluated from urinary sodium excretion, a physiological index of normality is obtained along with the ability to detect subtle variations in renin secretion. This has made it possible to correlate more closely the antihypertensive action of propranolol with the renin level. Propranolol reduced renin in all patients but did not lower blood pressure in low renin hypertensive states. It was dramatically effective in lowering blood pressure of high renin and some normal renin patients. Its antihypertensive effect was directly related to the pretreatment renin level and also to the absolute decrement in renin reduction achieved. This was true in malignant, renal, renovasular, and essential hypertension. Altogether, these findings point to the involvement of the renin-aldosterone axis in these hypertensive states. They suggest that a major component of the antihypertensive action of propranolol is consequent to an antirenin effect which is perhaps neurologically mediated. Accordingly, in addition to its therapeutic values, the response to propranolol may provide a pharmacological indicator of the renin involvement in essential hypertension and it also may be a useful adjunct for predicting surgical curability of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "22": "In a double-blind preliminary study in 32 students exhibiting symptoms of examination stress, treatment with 80 mg oxprenolol daily or 4 mg diazepam daily were found to be equally effective in relieving anxiety and tension, as assessed by both students and physician. Although students on diazepam became significantly more confident of success than those on oxprenolol, their results were worse than expected. In contrast, students on oxprenolol did not gain in confidence and they were significantly more successful than anticipated by their tutors.", 
    "23": "The functional renal failure accompanying advanced liver disease is characterized by azotemia, a urine of very low sodium concentration and systemic hypotension with decreased renal perfusion and high renal vascular resistance. Patients with this disorder have a markedly reduced ability to excrete free water and develop hyponatremia, ascites and edema. It is postulated that this renal dysfunction is due to hepatic failure to make renin substrate. Renin released from the kidney is thus unable to exert its pressor effect. The resultant hypotension and renal hypoperfusion continue to stimulate excessive synthesis and release of renin. It is postulated that the overdriven renal renin system increases renovascular resistance at the level of the glomerular arterioles. This causes decreased renal blood flow and decreased glomerular filtration rate leading to salt and water retention and azotemia. Since no renin substrate is available for human infusion, this hypothesis could be tested either by infusion of angiotensin II to restore systemic blood pressure and renal perfusion or by beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol to attempt to decrease the intrarenal effects of renin, restore glomerular blood flow and filtration and thus return of renal function.", 
    "24": "The role of cardiac nerves in the production of cardiac arrest during surgical anaesthesia on coronary ligated hypoxic heart has been studied. When atropinished coronary ligated dogs were exposed to hypoxia the terminal event was a cardiac asystole in 88% of the dogs. In propranolol treated dogs, or in dogs where sympathetic ganglia upto T6 were bilaterally removed earlier, coronary ligation and hypoxia produced ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia and repeated sinus arrest followed by ventricular fibrillation. The possibility of the origin of arrythmia from the damaged myocardium, and the presence of an intact vagus in the production of ventricular fibrillation has been discussed.", 
    "25": "Coretal -- an agent blocking the beta-adrenergic receptors -- was given to 12 patients with Parkinson's syndrome with evident tremor and to 4 patients with benign essential tremor. In the group of Parkinson's syndrome the effectiveness of this treatment was evaluated by the blind method. The whole period of observation was 6 weeks, during 3 weeks the patients received Coretal 60-120 mg daily, during the next 3 weeks they were given placebo. The intensity of tremor was assessed by means of a scoring system. Improvement was achieved in 7 patients with Parkinson's syndrome and in 3 out of 4 cases of idiopathic tremor. Complete disappearance of tremor was never observed. Transient side effects were observed in 2 causes. The authors think that Coretal may be used with good result in treatment of parkinsonian tremor and benign essential tremor.", 
    "26": "Ventilatory and circulatory data from 20 patients suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease have been obtained before, during and after exercise at 600 kpm/min for 5 min on a bicycle ergometer. The patients had been given intravenously practolol, 15 mg, or saline alternatively, using a double-blind cross-over technique. A slight postexercise reduction of FEV1 (8%) was noted after practolol medication as compared to placebo, with an accompanying decrease in PaCO2; PaO2 did not differ substantially. No wheezing or inappropriate dyspnea attributable to the medication was noted in any of the patients. The well known beta1-blocking effects on the circulation were confirmed, with maintained Q and reduced HR, together with a lowered systemic BP during and after exercise. There was a significant positive relationship between the postexercise reduction of FEV1 and the concomitant fall in HR. It is concluded that practolol in doses with near maximal circulatory effects had a slight, but clinically insignificant effect on the ventilatory parameters.", 
    "27": "Previous studied have shown that nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) is the prevailing mechanism of fever production in both newborn (during the first 2-3 wk of life) and adult cold-acclimated guinea pigs. This study was undertaken to determine whether this process may be mediated by noradrenergic sympathetics. The temperatures in the interscapular brown fat pad (Tbat) and the colon (Tre), the rate of oxygen consumption (VO2), and shivering activity were measured continuously for 5 h at 27 degrees C ambient temperature in 8- and 16-day-old and adult cold-acclimated guinea pigs following 2 mug/kg iv of Salmonella enteritidis endotoxin, with and without 6.0 mg/kg of propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker) injected ip 2 min before the endotoxin. In the older animals, the increase in Tbat normally produced by endotoxin was reduced by propranolol administration, but shivering set in, maintaining both VO2 and Tre at their febrile levels. In the newborn animals, Tbat also was decreased by propranolol, but shivering did not set in, so that VO2 and Tre fell below their febrile values. It is concluded that endotoxin-induced NST is controlled by noradrenergic sympathetics. The failure of NST to be replaced in the present newborn guinea pigs by visible shivering might be related to other observations that the onset of shivering at this age occurs only when Tre is significantly reduced.", 
    "28": "The role of brain monoamines in the anticonvulsant effect of imipramine was investigated in albino rats, against maximal electroshock-induced seizures, by using drugs with well-defined effects on brain monoamines. The results suggest a definite role for noradrenaline in imipramine anticonvulsant action. Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine do not appear to be involved in this effect of imipramine.", 
    "29": "Previous administration of adrenaline (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) and isoprenaline (10 mg/kg i.p.) enhances activity of several hypnotic drugs (pentobarbital, barbital, chloral hydrate) in mice but is without effect upon hypnotic activity of ethanol. This potentialisation is blocked by previous administration of pindolol, but not by phentolamine. Administration of SKF 525 A demonstrates that metabolism of pentobarbital is modified by this enzymatic inhibitor, which is not the case for other hypnotics.", 
    "30": "One hour before resection of the liver and repeatedly 24 hours after the operation male rats were given phentholamine--a blocker of alpha-adrenoceptors; this preparation inhibited the mitotic activity of the regenerating liver. A double administration at the same periods of propanol--a blocker of beta-adrenoceptors--caused an elevation of the mitotic activity. A conclusion was drawn that by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors it was possible to inhibit the regenerative process. Adrenaline stimulated this process by acting through beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "31": "Electrical stimulation of the central section of the cervical vagus in cats with bilateral vagotomy results in lowering of the arterial blood pressure. A study is made of the effect of some beta-adrenotropic drugs on the depressor reaction. Propranolol (3 mg/kg i.v.) causes considerable blocking of the depressor reaction in all experiments. On the other hand, Isoprenaline ( a. 10 mug/kh/min) results in a considerable increase of this reaction. The administration of Propranolol (3 mg/kg) and Phentolamine (2 mg/kg) causes almost complete blocking of the reaction. A conclusion is made on the basis of these data that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic structures take part in the realization and development of the depressor reaction upon afferent vagal stimulation.", 
    "32": "The ability of adrenaline and histamine to stimulate the formation of cyclic AMP was investigated in broken cell preparation and intact cells of smooth muscle of the aorta and femoral artery of rats which had been subjected to daily intermittent immobilization for 1, 3, and 17 weeks. It was found that this type of stress led to an instability of the blood pressure which was associated with an increase in the sensitivity of adenylate cyclase in the broken cell preparations from the arteries to adrenaline and histamine and with a heightened cyclic AMP response to the two hormones in the intact arterial smooth muscle cells. The sensitivity of cardiac adenylate cyclase for adrenaline remained unchanged.", 
    "33": "Comparative effects of noradrenaline (10(-8)-10(-6) g/ml) and isoprenaline (10(-10)-10(-6) g/ml) on electrical and contractile activity were investigated in longitudinal and circular muscle strips of rat myometrium (13-19 days pregnant). When recorded with an intracellular microelectrode, spike potentials of longitudinal muscle discharged spontaneously in bursts. Treatment with either noradrenaline or isoprenaline hyperpolarized the membrane and increased membrane conductance, causing the cessation of spontaneous activity. Slow potential was dominant in the circular muscle, and it became prolonged after treatment with noradrenaline, leading to an increase in tension. Isoprenaline reduced the duration of the slow potential and depressed the contraction. The minimal concentration of isoprenaline needed to suppress the spontaneous activity in circular muscle was much higher than in longitudinal muscle. The excitatory effect of noradrenaline on circular muscle was antagonized by treatment with phentolamine, and the inhibitory effect of catecholamines on both longitudinal and circular muscles by propranolol. alpha-Adrenoceptor appears predominant in circular muscle, while beta-adrenoceptor in longitudinal muscle in rat myometrium during late-pregnancy.", 
    "34": "Pimozide and haloperidol, the dopaminergic antagonists, have been shown to effectively block diethylstilbestrol (DES)-elicited [3H] adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in incubated hypothalami from immature male rats. Several noradrenergic antagonists (i.e. propranolol, MJ-1999 and phenoxybenzamine) failed to reduce [3H]cAMP levels significantly. Pimozide was found to be more specific than haloperidol as it did not effect norepinephrine (NE)-elicited formation of [3H]cAMP, while the latter blocker caused a 48% reduction of the stimulation by NE. Pimozide was also more potent than haloperidol in inhibiting DES-stimulated [3H]cAMP formation. It can be inferred from these data that as a result of DES-receptor interaction dopamine (DA) is released and in turn activates DA-sensitive adenylate cyclase in the hypothalamus.", 
    "35": "The effects of propranolol, given by close arterial injection, on the reflex vasodilatation induced in the atropinized isolated gracilis muscle by rapid i.v. administration of norepinephrine were studied in dogs. The integrated areas of vasodilatation were significantly reduced after treatment with propranolol. Thus the conclusion was that adrenergic beta-receptors participate in the reflex vasodilatation, although how they act needs further elucidation.", 
    "36": "Human subcutaneous adipose tissue has been incubated in vitro in the presence and absence of isoprenaline (ISNA). The tissue concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the release of glycerol into the incubation medium were measured after various incubation periods. In the presence of ISNA (6 X 10(-5) mol/l), the tissue concentration of cAMP reached a peak after around 10 min and then declined to a level significantly lower than that at the start of the incubation. In contrast, the ISNA-induced rate of lipolysis was a linear function of the incubation time. The addition of propranolol (13 mumol/l) at different times after ISNA did not influence the rate of lipolysis, although it resulted in a decrease in the tissue level of cAMP. There was a positive correlation between the maximal increase in tissue cAMP and the rate of lipolysis in adipose tissue exposed to ISNA, both in individual experiments and in a group of 23 persons. No correlation was found between the rate of lipolysis and the tissue level of cAMP in adipose tissue incubated under basal conditions. The findings are compatible with the theory that the beta-adrenergic-induced lipolysis by human adipose tissue is a function of the maximal rise in the concentration of tissue cAMP. It is concluded that this peak level of cAMP represents single compartment of the nucleotide.", 
    "37": "30 min after injection of levodopa (200 mg/kg) into rats the cAMP levels in the cisternal fluid were significantly elevated by 60% over controls. When dopamine-beta-hydroxylase was inhibited by bis-(4-methyl-1-homopiperazinyl-thiocarbonyl)-disulfide (Fla 63) the levodopa induced increase of cAMP levels was less marked, it was suppressed by propranolol (10 mg/kg), a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Piribedil (10 mg/kg) failed to influence cisternal cAMP concentrations. The findings do not support the concept of a dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in vivo, and suggest a beta-adrenergic stimulation of cerebral adenylate cyclase by metabolites of levodopa.", 
    "38": "Monoaminergic influences on the regulation of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenocortical (HHA) system during acute stresses (hypoxia and hypercapnia) were investigated in male rats. Plasma corticosterone levels were used to assess HHA activity, and the alterations in monoaminergic activity were induced by pretreating the animals with various pharmacologic agents (reserpine, alpha MT, FLA-63, pCPA, L-Dopa, pargyline, Lilly 110140, phentolamine and propranolol). Dexamethasone-treated rats were utilized to assess the site at which these monoaminergic substances acted. The latter experiments showed that these agents did not have a marked effect directly on the adrenal cortex and thus the site(s) of action was at the level of the anterior pituitary and/or above. Altering the serotoninergic system did not appreciably influence the HHA response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, whereas increasing the activity of the adrenergic system partially prevented the rise usually observed in plasma corticosterone levels during these stresses. These data suggest that different aminergic pathways may be utilized for different stresses.", 
    "39": "There are several situations in which medical therapy of hyperinsulinism induced by islet cell tumors or hyperplasia is necessary and at present we have at our disposal several drugs which are capable of reducing endogenous hyperinsulinism. They are: -Streptozotocin, which represents today the most useful therapeutic agent for beta cell carcinoma therapy; -Diazoxide, which represents the drug of first choice for the treatment of most hypoglycemic syndromes caused by islet cell adenoma or hyperplasia; -Propranolol, Chlorpromazine, Diphenylhydantoin, which may be regarded as a useful alternative to diazoxide, although they are capable of giving rather inconstant results. These drugs may today effectively substitute for corticosteroids and glucagon in the medical treatment of almost every chronic hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic syndrome, including malignant beta cell carcinoma.", 
    "40": "The time course of the action of epinephrine on cAMP levels in isolated mouse Ehrlich ascites cells was studied. Following the addition of hormone (10(-7) to 10(-4) M), cAMP levels reached a maximum within 1 min and declined to about 2 fold basal levels within 10-20 min. The decline phase was not due to the metabolism of epinephrine or accumulation of an inhibitor in the medium. Experiments involving timed additions of theophylline to epinephrine-treated cells suggested that the rate of cAMP synthesis declined progressively with time. Cells treated with epinephrine and then washed free of hormone were shown to be refractory to hormonal stimulation of cAMP levels. Adenylate cyclase prepared from epinephrine-treated cells was shown to exhibit decreased sensitivity to the hormone in in vitro incubations. Resensitization of the enzyme could be achieved by washing pretreated cells free of epinephrine and reincubating them for 1/2 to 2 h. Neither desensitization nor resensitization were prevented by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Desensitization could not be induced by incubating cels with dibutyryl-cAMP. The desensitization phenomenon is considered to be a mechanism whereby cells protect themselves against the possible harmful effects of high levels of cAMP maintained over a long period of time.", 
    "41": "Isoproterenol (10(-4) M), histamine (10(-3) M) and tyramine (10(-3) M) elevated cyclic AMP levels in incubated rat urerine segments. Promethazine (10(-6) M) an H1-receptor antagonist was ineffective in blocking the increase in cyclic AMP due to isoproterenol, histamine and tyramine. Buriamide (10(-6) M), an H2 receptor antagonist, was effective in almost abolishing the cyclic AMP elevation due to histamine, whereas burimamide did not affect the cyclic AMP levels elevated by tyramine and only slightly reduced the isoproterenol response. Propranolol was effective in reducing or abolishing the cyclic AMP accumulation by all three agonists. The respective blockade by burimamide or propranolol was overcome by increasing the concentration of the agonists. Histamine (10(-3) M) and tyramine (10(-3) M) failed to elevate cyclic AMP in uterine segments obtained from reserpine treated rats. The data supports the hypothesis that histamine, like tyramine, has an indirect effect on the rat uterus mediated through the release of endogenous norepinephrine.", 
    "42": "The method of Kidwai et al. (1971. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 45:901) offers a rapid and simple technique for the preparation of membrane fractions from rat heart, using sucrose density centrifugation of a 100,000x g pellet. We have investigated the distribution of adenylate cyclase, cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, and norepinephrine binding activity in these fractions. Specific activity of adenylate cyclase was high in the plasma membrane (PM) and sarcoplasmic reticulum, as well as the nuclear (N) fractions, but 80-90 percent of the total activity was found in the N fraction. Epinephrine stimulation of adenylate cyclase was present in all fractions but did not exceed 25 percent of basal activity. The activity in the mitochondrial fraction was low and insensitive to epinephrine. About 10 percent of phosphodiesterase activity was found in the 100,000 x g pellet. After density gradient centrifugation, 70 percent of this portion was recovered in the N fraction, with the highest specific activity present in the PM fraction. Binding of [3H] norepinephrine was measured by a membrane filtration technique. Binding activity was found in all fractions, and it paralleled roughly the distribution of adenylate cyclase. However, only about 25-30 percent of the binding was blocked by propranolol, except in the PM fraction where binding was not prevented by this drug. Further, a comparison of adenylate cyclase activities with norepinephrine binding yields a turnover number for the enzyme of the order of 10(-2) sec-1, assuming a 1:1 relationship between beta-adrenergic recptor and adenylate cyclase. Since this value seems unrealistic, we suspect that either the binding activity measured is unrelated to the beta-adrenergic receptor or the receptor to cyclase ratio is considerably larger than unity.", 
    "43": "Calcium, cyclic AMP, and cyclic GMP do not seem to be involved in proliferative activation of postmitotic differentiated cells. Instead, they are intracycle regulators, and we propose the following working model of their control of the initiation of DNA synthesis. While a role for cyclic GMP cannot yet be defined, a brief postmitotic burst of its synthesis might serve to prevent certain activated cells (e.g. 3T3 mouse cells) from being diverted into a nonproliferating (but still activated) G0 state (Figs. 1 and 17). In a latter part of the G1 phase, something happens to stimulate briefly the synthesis of cyclic AMP which, in turn, drives calcium ions from the mitochondria into the cytosol to activate newly synthesized thymidylate synthetase (or other primed enzymic assemblies) (Fig. 1). Having \"turned on\" their target enzymes, the accumulated cyclic AMP is destroyed and the excess calcium ions are reaccumulated by the mitochondria to avoid interfering with succeeding reactions. This model predicts that persistent changes in cyclic AMP metabolism and the respiration-linked, calcium-accumulating (ion-buffering) activity of mitochondria may be responsible for the sustained growth of tumors.", 
    "44": "The effect of the beta-blocking agents propranolol and oxprenolol on isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy has been investigated in the rat. To evaluate the degree of inhibition biochemical parameters related to cardiomegaly were measured. When given alone in the dose range used for protection, the beta-blocking agents did not cause any significant change in total myocardial RNA, DNA and protein. Depending on the dose applied, propranolol and oxprenolol prevented partially or totally the cardiomegaly induced by isoproterenol.", 
    "45": "The effect of dl-sotalol (intrarenal perfusion of 19 mg/kg during 30 min) on urinary concentration was studied under pentobarbital anaesthesia in dehydrated dogs. Sotalol infusion decreased urinary osmolality and increased natriuresis and urine flow. This diuretic action was accompanied by the reduction of the renin hypersecretion elicited by water deprivation.", 
    "46": "The role of the sympathetic system in the development of bradycardia during nasal apnoea and the role of the sympathetic and parasympathetic system in the development of cardiovascular changes during and immediately after lung inflation were determined in anaesthetized rabbits. Transection of the cervical cord (C5-7) completely blocked the hypertensive response to chemical stimulation of the nasal mucosa. The degree of nasal bradycardia was 72% lower than in stimulation of the controls. Propranolol had no effect on the hypertensive reaction, but inhibited nasal bradycardia, which was 68% lower than in the controls. Lung inflation induced tachycardia, which was only non-significantly reduced by bilateral vagotomy. Vagotomy inhibited the bradycardiac response to removal of occlusion of the trachea and the subsequent rise in blood pressure, however. Cervical cord transection likewise did not reduce inflation-induced tachycardia, but it significantly influenced the heart rate during the second phase of prolonged inflation, when the heart is affected by hypoxia. Inflation-induced tachycardia was likewise not influenced by bilateral vagotomy associated with cervical cord transection. Similar cardiac responses also occur in the presence of the simple increase in pericardial pressure produced by left pneumothorax without lung inflation.", 
    "47": "The effect of various autonomic blockers on the heart rate (from the ECG recording) of intact rats and of animals with experimental hyperthyroidism induced by the administration of dried thyroid was studied. In intact rats, the heart rate fell significantly (by 22%) during the first week after the peroral administration of propranolol (0.05% in food), but trimepranol (0.02%), reserpine (0.001%) and guanethidine (0.1%) had no effect (in a suplementary experment, a small, but statistically significant decrease was also found after trimepranol). In experimental hyperthyroidism, using the same blocker doses, the heart rate fell significantly after propranolol (by 23%), trimepranol (22%), reserpine (16%) and, in a preliminary experiment, guanethidine (19%). On injecting 0.05 mg propranolol intravenously, the maximum drop in the heart rate in intact rats was 22%, while in hyperthyroidism it was hardly more than half this value (at all the intervals from 2 to 30 minutes the decrease was statistically significant). Practolol, in a dose of 0.3 mg i.v., was less effective -- in intact rats the heart rate fell by not more than 12% (at all the intervals from 2 to 30 minutes the decrease was significant), but in hyperthyroidism the drop was slower and statistically non-significant. The results do not furnish an unequivocal answer to the question of the role of adrenergic regulation of the heart rate under physiological conditions and in experimental hyperthyroidism in rats.", 
    "48": "An increase of alpha-amylase concentration and specific amylase activity (correlated to protein content) was evident already after 3 days in the parotid glands of rats treated with 2 X 2 mg/day of propranolol hydrochloride. After separation of amylase into isoenzymes, only the specific isoamylase activities were enhanced. In contrast to treatment with a guanethidine derivative (guanoxane), these changes have persisted after 3 weeks. On the strength of these results, functional inhibition of the salivary glands (i.e. blockade of secretion by beta-sympatholytic agnets) is discussed as a therapeutical possibility for the management of sialosis and sialoadenitis.", 
    "49": "The calorigenic effect of infused adrenaline and noradrenaline was measured in cold-acclimated rats. The slopes of the dose-response curves for the two catecholamines and the maxima of the curves were the same. The adrenaline dose-response curve showed a shift to the right, towards higher infusion doses, compared with the noradrenaline curve. Thermogenesis due to the two catecholamines was not additive throughout the whole range of doses used. In interaction with noradrenaline, propranolol caused a parallel shift of the dose-response curve to the right, whereas in interaction with adrenaline it depressed the maximum. The concept that the two catecholamines act via different regulation sites on a common thermogenetic effector is discussed.", 
    "50": "Six patients wit psoriasiform cutaneous eruptions that developed during long-term therapy with propranolol (Inderal) have been studied. The cutaneous changes closely resembled those seen during treatment with practolol (Eraldin). The duration of treatment before the rash was recognized averaged 10 months, which is about the same latency period as in patients with practolol-induced exanthemas. The exanthemas disappeared gradually within 1-5 weeks after treatment with propranolol had been stopped. In 4 of 5 patients the skin eruptions reappeared within 2-4 days after oral challenge with propranolol. In the fifth patient, who developed a rash after challenge with practolol and severe abdominal colics after challenge with oxprenolol, no further provocation tests with propranolol were attempted. Skin biopsies obtained from 3 patients showed a microscopical picture similar to that seen in practolol exanthemas. The pathogenetic mechanism responsible for these adverse cutaneous reactions is unknown. However, since the possibility exists, that these changes may be caused by blockade of the epidermal beta-receptors, it is recommended that all patients receiving beta-blocking drugs should be examined carefully for similar adverse reactions. Special attention should be drawn to the reversible skin changes, since during treatment with practolol these have often preceded serious complications from other organs.", 
    "51": "A double blind trial of practolol in coronary heart disease has been conducted for 2 years. In 298 patients with acute myocardial infarction there was no reduction in overall mortality. In a group with initial heart rate over 100 per minute mortality was significantly lowered up to 1 year. Of 484 patients with coronary heart disease treatment for 2 years did not produce a significant reduction in infarction or sudden death. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have been shown to reduce left ventricular work and to have an antiarrhythmic action. On these grounds they would seem theoretically to have a place in the management of acute myocardial infarction. Practolol is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent with an intrinsic sympathomimetic action, but devoid of local anaesthetic effect. It has been found effective in post infarction arrhythmias (1). In early infarction it reduces the area of necrosis as measured by surface ST segment mapping (2).", 
    "52": "Fragmented lung prepared from dogs cutaneously sensitive to ascaris antigen released histamine and a slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis-like (SRS-A) material upon antigen challenge. Passive sensitization of fragments with serum obtained from ascaris-sensitive donor dogs enhanced the release of both substances; heating (56 degrees C for 4 h) destroyed the ability of the serum to enhance release. In passively sensitized tissues isoproterenol and papaverine inhibited the release of histamine and SRS-A; propranolol antagonized the effect of isoproterenol. Carbachol enhanced the release of both substances from passively sensitized lung wheras disodium cromoglycate and aminoguanidine were without effect. It is concluded that fragmented canine lung is a useful model for study of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions.", 
    "53": "Heat production has been measured in erythrocytes of 17 hyperthyroid patients both before treatment and when the patients had become clinically euthyroid. The decrease in heat effect during treatment was significant. The initial mean value was significantly higher than the corresponding value for normal subjects. A good correlation was found between heat effect values and the clinical condition. Measurement of heat production in erythrocytes can provide useful information about the peripheral effect of thyroid hormones.", 
    "54": "In rats of kind of Kruschinskij-Molodkina the number of cells in the stellate ganglion was diminished to 0.5% of the norm after eliminating the sympathetic tonus by means of guanethidine. These animals died of cardiac thrombosis during stress situations. This thrombosis cannot be explained by adrenalin, corticosteroids or thromboplastin spreading in the blood stream. A factor, the nature of which has still to be explained, may be assumed to be responsible for thrombosis to develop during stress situations in animals whose sympathetic tonus has been eliminated by guanethidine.", 
    "55": "The clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism have suggested to physicians for many years that the sympathetic nervous system may be involved in their production. Despite this, the precise interrelationship between the thyroid gland and the sympathetic nervous system has never been defined but controlled investigations have shown that hypersensitivity to catcholamines does not occur in animals or man with artificially produced thyrotoxicosis. In recent years beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, and in particular propranolol, have been used in patients with hyperthyroidism. Evidence exists that they control some of the peripheral manifestations of the disease, including nervousness, palpitations, tachycardia, increased cardiac output and tremor, but they do not appear to affect the underlying thyrotoxic process itself. Propranolol has been used with sucess in the treatment of acute hyperthyroid crisis, in pre-operative preparations for thyroidectomy, for the control of symptoms and signs following the administration of radioactive iodine therapy and antithyroid drugs, during the period of diagnostic thyroid investigations and occasionally as the sole therapy. The supportive role of propranolol in the management of hyperthyroidism is now established and in some instances such as radioactive iodine therapy, it has enabled improvements in the existing methods of treatment to be achieved.", 
    "56": "An interference microscopic method is described which allows quantitative measurements of the inhibiting effect of the di-sodium salt of 1,3-bis(3-carboxy-chroman-5-yl-oxy)-2-hydroxypropand (cromoglicinic acid; Intal; DSCG) on the degranulation of mast cells in vitro induced by polymixin B and Compound 48/80. The specific degranulation inhibiting effect of DSCG is increased in the presence of Ca++ and Mg++ ions.", 
    "57": "Twelve patients with cutaneous and/or eye symptoms caused by practolol have been studied. The morphological appearance of the skin eruptions was psoriasiform in 5, vesiculo-papular in one, and exfoliating dermatitis was seen in 2 patients. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca was the only adverse reaction to practolol in one and was present in 3 additional patients. Practolol was found to aggravate existing psoriasis in 3 patients and render it extremely refractory to therapy.", 
    "58": "This work was intended to analyze the sympathetic and parasympathetic factors affecting the hemodynamics of hyperthyroidism. Seven patients with hyperthyroidism, diagnosed based on the determinations of BMR, 131I-uptake, T3-resin sponge uptake (T3-RSU), and serum level of thyroxine (T4) were subjected to the study. The hemo-dynamic estimation was done (1) at rest, (2) after vagus blocking by the injection of 0.04 mg/Kg b.wt. atropine and 0.2 mg/Kg b.wt. propranolol before (hyperthyroid state=H) and after (euthyroid state=E) anti-thyroid drug therapy. Cardiac output was measured by the dye-dilution method, and the valve was calculated according to the standard Hamilton formula. The following results were obtained. (1) The vagal tone is lower in H than in E, on the other hand, sympathetic beta-receptor tone is higher in H than in E. (2) The sympathetic alpha-receptor tone in H may be equivalent to that in E. (3) There might exist inotropic factors which affect the hemo-dynamics, other than autonomic nervous system in H.", 
    "59": "The clinical diagnosis in cases of suspected hyperthyroidism is very valuable. Laboratory diagnosis rests largely on measurements of circulating thyroid hormones, with radio-iodine studies playing only a minor part. No one test is infallible and some understanding of basic physiological considerations is essential if serious errors are to be avoided. The choice of treatment plan is logically-based, but should take into account the quality of available services.", 
    "60": "The effect of compound 48/80 in various rat brain regions - by means of incubating brain sclices with compound 48/80 - on cyclic AMP accumulation and release of the nucleotide into the incubation medium was studied. In all regions tested, accumulation of cyclic AMP occurred within at least 10 min. In the cortex, brain stem and cerebellar regions these increases of cyclic AMP could be blocked by propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist. Diphenhydramin, an antihistaminic agent, was without effect in these regions, but could partially block the compound 48/80-induced rise of cyclic AMP in the hypothalamus. Propranolol had in this region only a moderate blocking effect. Release of cyclic AMP, induced by compound 48/80, occurred in all regions tested and could not be effectively blocked by propranolol or diphenhydramin.", 
    "61": "Four women and one man with painless subacute thyroiditis presented with hypermetabolic signs and symptoms. Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) resin uptakes (T3R) were increased but the 24 hour radioactive iodine (RAI) uptakes were less than 1 per cent. Surreptitious use of thyroid hormone was excluded. The thyroid was enlarged in one patient and nontender in all. Exophthalmos was absent. The protein-bound iodine level was 1.1 to 9.5 mug/dl greater than the T4 level. The sedimentation rate was normal or minimally increased, and antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies were undetectable. In one hospitalized patient 84 per cent of the administered dose of 131I was recovered in the urine within 48 hours (normal 64 per cent) excluding extrathyroidal uptake. In all subjects the T4 and T3R levels fell to normal or slightly below normal within one to four months. An increase in the 2 and 24 hour RAI uptake to minimally increased or high normal values and return of the T4 and T3R levels to normal occurred in four of five patients within six months. In one of these, the administration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) resulted in an appropriate increase in 24 hour RAI uptake from 14.9 to 37.1 per cent. One woman remained clinically hypothyroid for six months with a low T4 concentration (3.2 mug/dl), an elevated TSH level (48 muU/ml) and evidence of a persistent organification defect -- two hour RAI uptake decreasing from 33 to 23 per cent after the administration of perchlorate and the 24 hour RAI uptake increasing from 32 to 76 per cent following the administration of TSH. At 21 months after the initial onset of her illness, she is euthyroid but increased RAI uptake persists. The clinical course in four of the five patients is similar to that in an additional eight patients treated during the same time period who presented with typical subacute thyroiditis. Thus, these patients have a form of painless subacute thyroiditis which presents as thyrotoxicosis but is differentiated from it by a low RAI uptake and in whom recovery of thyroidal iodine trapping is the first indicator of recovery. The hyperthyroidism is self-limiting and should be treated conservatively."
