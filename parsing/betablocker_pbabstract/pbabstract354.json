    "2": "The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 17.4 mm Hg for the oral acetazolamide group and 16.7 mm Hg for the timolol gel group. The mean IOP on the first postoperative day was 17.9 mm Hg with oral acetazolamide and 12.9 mm Hg with timolol gel. One patient developed significant adverse reactions with oral acetazolamide; there were no adverse reactions with timolol gel.",

    "4": "A meta-analysis of 12 selected randomized trials was performed to assess the efficacy of beta-blockers in the prevention of rebleeding and the effect on long-term survival in patients with cirrhosis. Five end points were assessed: rebleeding, variceal rebleeding, death, death from bleeding, and adverse events. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method. For each end point, heterogeneity and treatment efficacy were assessed by the Der Simonian and Peto methods. When a significant difference was observed, sensitivity analyses were performed by successive stratifications according to treatment duration, cause of initial bleeding, use of placebo, type of beta-blocker, type of publication, certainty of randomization, severity of cirrhosis, interval between index bleed and randomization, and methodological quality. Beta-blockers significantly increased the mean percentage of patients free of rebleeding (21% mean improvement rate, CI 95%: 10%-32%, P < .001, relative risk 1.42), the mean percentage of patients free of variceal rebleeding (20% mean improvement rate, CI 95%: 11%-28%, P < .001), the mean survival rate (5.4% mean improvement rate, CI 95%: 0%-11%, P = .05, relative risk 1.27), the mean percentage of patients free of bleeding death (7.4%, CI 95%: 2%-13%, P < .01, relative risk 1.50). Five patients would need to be treated with beta-blockers to prevent one rebleeding episode, 14 treated to prevent one death, and 13 treated to prevent one death from bleeding. There was no significant heterogeneity among studies by both methods of analysis. In patients with esophageal varices, beta-blockers significantly increase the mean percentage of patients free of rebleeding and the mean survival rate at 2 years.", 
    "5": "Left ventricular (LV) output nearly triples at birth, in association with increases in serum catecholamines. Similar increases in catecholamines in utero, however, do not increase output. We hypothesized that catecholamines increase contractility in utero, but that output cannot increase until LV loading conditions are changed by oxygen ventilation. To address this hypothesis, we studied nine fetal sheep acutely placed in a warm water bath (40 degrees C). Conductance and manometric catheters were placed in the LV to generate pressure-volume loops during caval occlusion in the nonventilated and oxygen-ventilated states, each under control, dobutamine, and propranolol conditions. Contractility was estimated by the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, preload by end-diastolic volume, and afterload by arterial elastance. Oxygen ventilation increased LV output 1.4-fold, despite a decrease in contractility to about three-fourths of the nonventilated value. Heart rate remained constant, whereas preload increased and afterload decreased significantly. During oxygen ventilation, dobutamine increased output to 2.3 times the control, nonventilated value, associated with increases in contractility and heart rate and no change in preload and afterload. Although dobutamine increased contractility and heart rate similarly in the nonventilated and oxygen ventilated states, output increased significantly more during ventilation. Similarly, propranolol decreased contractility and heart rate equally in both states, but output decreased far more during ventilation. Thus, oxygen ventilation is associated with advantageous changes in LV load such that the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of dobutamine are translated into greater increases in LV output.", 
    "6": "Amyloid beta protein (A beta), the central constituent of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, is known to exert toxic effects on cultured neurons. The role of the voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel (VSCC) in beta (25-35) neurotoxicity was examined using rat cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons. When L-type VSCCs were blocked by application of nimodipine, beta (25-35) neurotoxicity was attenuated, whereas application of omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTX-GVIA) or omega-agatoxin IVA (omega-Aga-IVA), the blocker for N- or P/Q-type VSCCs, had no effects. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies indicated that the Ca2+ current density of beta (25-35)-treated neurons is about twofold higher than that of control neurons. Also, beta (25-35) increased Ca2+ uptake, which was sensitive to nimodipine. The 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate assay showed the ability of beta (25-35) to produce reactive oxygen species. Nimodipine had no effect on the level of free radicals. In contrast, vitamin E, a radical scavenger, reduced the level of free radicals, neurotoxicity, and Ca2+ uptake. These results suggest that beta (25-35) generates free radicals, which in turn, increase Ca2+ influx via the L-type VSCC, thereby inducing neurotoxicity.", 
    "7": "Sotalol is a noncardioselective beta-blocking agent with additional class III antiarrhythmic properties (action potential duration prolongation). These combined electrophysiologic effects make it a valuable drug for treating various arrhythmias. Its effectiveness for suppressing supraventricular reentrant tachycardias in children is well documented. Atrial flutter in children can be effectively managed in a high percentage of those treated. Ventricular arrhythmias in children can be adequately controlled by the administration of oral sotalol. Side effects are those typically seen during the course of treatment with a beta-blocker and lead to discontinuation of the drug in 3-6% of children. Proarrhythmia is another concern after sotalol administration. Increased ventricular ectopy, impairment of atrioventricular conduction, and suppression of sinus node activity with exacerbation of bradycardia (especially in children with sinus node dysfunction) may be found in a considerable number of treated patients, usually within a few days of sotalol initiation. Sotalol is an effective antiarrhythmic drug, but its potential side effects warrant inpatient treatment initially and close electrocardiographic monitoring.", 
    "8": "These studies investigated the role of the autonomic nervous system in mediating the immunosuppressive effect of morphine on blood lymphocyte proliferation in rats. To determine the contribution of the autonomic nervous system, rats were pretreated with the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine (5 mg/kg) prior to morphine (7 mg/kg) administration. Ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine completely antagonized the inhibitory actions of morphine, suggesting that intact ganglionic transmission was required for the inhibition to occur. Blockade of postganglionic parasympathetic neurotransmission with atropine methylbromide (1 mg/kg) or blockade of sympathetic neurotransmission with the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1 mg/kg) did not attenuate the suppressive effect of morphine. Blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol (2.5 mg/kg) resulted in partial antagonism, but this action was not shared by the peripherally acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol (6 mg/kg). These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of morphine on blood lymphocyte proliferation may be mediated through activation of the autonomic nervous system; however, individual blockade of either the parasympathetic or sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system was not sufficient to antagonize this immunosuppressive effect.", 
    "9": "The forced swimming test is a behavioural model developed to predict the efficacy of antidepressant drugs. Few studies have been aimed at evaluating the mechanism of action of antidepressants in the forced swimming test. The present study was designed in order to further evaluate the mode of action of antidepressants in the forced swimming test, by using selective agonists and antagonists at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor sites. Agonists/antagonists and antidepressants were administered 45 min and 30 min, respectively, prior to testing. Prior administration of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (1 mg/kg, i.p.) induced anti-immobility effects with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (8 mg/kg, i.p.) and noradrenaline uptake inhibitors maprotiline (8 mg/kg, i.p.) and desipramine (16 mg/kg, i.p.), but not with fluoxetine (16 mg/kg, i.p.), citalopram (16 mg/kg, i.p.) or fluvoxamine (8 mg/kg, i.p.). These effects were antagonised by prior administration of 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine) (NAN 190) (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). On the other hand, pretreatment with (+/-)-pindolol (32 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated the effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and was devoid of any activity with imipramine (8 mg/kg, i.p.), maprotiline (8 mg/kg, i.p.) or desipramine (16 mg/kg, i.p.). Prior administration of 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl)-1H-indole (RU 24969) enhanced the antidepressant-like effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and imipramine (8 mg/kg, i.p.) in the forced swimming test. The anti-immobility effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the forced swimming test seem to be mediated by presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors as well as postsynaptic 5-HT1B receptors. Antidepressant-like effects of the noradrenaline uptake inhibitors seem, on the other hand, to be mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. Considering the variety of 5-HT receptors, it is possible that other subtypes may participate in the anti-immobility effects of antidepressants in the forced swimming test.", 
    "10": "There exists a variety of situations in which a random effects meta-analysis might be undertaken using a small number of clinical trials. A problem associated with small meta-analyses is estimating the heterogeneity between trials. To overcome this problem, information from other related studies may be incorporated into the meta-analysis. A Bayesian approach to this problem is presented using data from previous meta-analyses in the same therapeutic area to formulate a prior distribution for the heterogeneity. The treatment difference parameters are given non-informative priors. Further, related trials which compare one or other of the treatments of interest with a common third treatment are included in the model to improve inference on both the heterogeneity and the treatment difference. Two approaches to estimating relative efficacy are considered, namely a general parametric approach and a method explicit to binary data. The methodology is illustrated using data from 26 clinical trials which investigate the prevention of cirrhosis using beta-blockers and sclerotherapy. Both sources of external information lead to more precise posterior distributions for all parameters, in particular that representing heterogeneity.", 
    "11": "In U373 MG cells, a line derived from a human astrocytoma, histamine stimulated the release of [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA) in a concentration-dependent manner (286 +/- 23% of basal release at 1 mM histamine). Neither Ca2+ removal nor Cd2+ (100 microM) affected [3H]GABA release evoked by 100 microM histamine but the response was significantly reduced by 10 microM U-73122 ({1-[6-((17 beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)-amino)-hexyl]-1 H-pyrrole-2,5-dione}), an inhibitor of phospholipase C activation (79 +/- 8% inhibition) and by 10 microM dimethylbenzamil, a selective blocker of plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchange (58 +/- 6% inhibition). In [3H]inositol-labelled cells histamine stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation (EC50, 17 +/- 2 microM; maximum effect, 203 +/- 4% of basal). Histamine-evoked Ca2+ mobilisation yielded an EC50 of 12 +/- 2 microM and maximum delta[Ca2+]i of 337 +/- 23 nM. Thapsigargin (1 nM) increased [Ca2+]i (delta[Ca2+]i 164 +/- 12 nM) and prevented any further increase by histamine (100 microM). The effects of histamine on [3H]GABA release, [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation and Ca2+ mobilisation were blocked by the selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine. Taken together, these results indicate that histamine stimulates [3H]GABA release by increasing [Ca2+]i. The mechanism of release may be related to changes in transmembranal Na+ gradients and reversal of GABA carrier transport due to stimulation of plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchange.", 
    "12": "The regulation of the expression of the beta3 adrenoreceptor gene was examined in the brown adipose tissue of intact mice and in murine brown fat primary cell cultures. Both in vivo and in vitro, high levels of beta3 receptor mRNA were observed. Acute cold exposure of mice resulted in a marked and rapid down-regulation of beta3 gene expression; this down-regulation was, however, transient. Similarly, in brown fat cell cultures, norepinephrine addition led to down-regulation of beta3 gene expression, with a lag phase of 30 min and with an apparent half-life of beta3 mRNA of approximately 30 min. This down-regulation was stimulated via the beta3 receptors themselves and mediated via cAMP; the apparent affinity of norepinephrine was extremely high (<1 nM). The degradation rate after actinomycin was identical to that after norepinephrine and was not affected by the presence of norepinephrine; thus, the down-regulation was due to cessation of transcription but not to an increased rate of degradation. Notably, inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide also led to down-regulation. The norepinephrine-induced down-regulation was transient; spontaneous recovery occurred after approximately 18 h and was not due to depletion of adrenergic agent. Recovery did not occur in the presence of cycloheximide. After recovery, the cells showed a functional desensitization of the down-regulation process itself (EC50 now approximately 10 nM). It is concluded that a down-regulated state cannot explain the functional desensitization of beta3 adrenergic responsiveness observed in brown fat cells isolated from cold-acclimated animals (i.e. physiologically chronically adrenergically stimulated brown fat cells); since the beta3 receptor is not subject to desensitization via phosphorylation processes, no satisfactory explanation for the functional desensitization exists as yet. A model is presented for the down-regulation/recovery process, involving the participation of a phosphorylatable short-lived transcription factor.", 
    "13": "PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 as low as 10(-13) M stimulate insulin release from rat islets in a glucose-dependent manner. PACAP also glucose dependently increases cAMP and [Ca2+]i in rat islet beta cells. The [Ca2+]i and insulin secretory responses to PACAP exhibit a similar concentration-response relationship, exhibiting a peak at 10(-13) M. When the [Ca2+]i response is abolished by nitrendipine, a blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels, the insulin response is also inhibited. Insulinotropic peptides glucagon, GLP-1, and VIP also increase [Ca2+]i in beta cells, but only in the nanomolar concentration range. PACAP is 4 logs more potent that VIP, a peptide that exhibits 68% amino acid homology and shares the type II PACAP receptor with PACAP. Immunoreactivity for the type I PACAP receptor is demonstrated in rat islets. Furthermore, PACAP immunoreactivity is demonstrated in nerve fibers and islets in rat pancreas. Based on these findings, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) PACAP is localized in pancreatic nerve fibers and islets; (2) PACAP in the subpicomolar range stimulates insulin release from islets; (3) the stimulation of insulin release is mediated by the cAMP-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i in beta cells; (4) all the PACAP effects are glucose-dependent; (5) PACAP is the most potent insulinotropic hormone known, and (6) the type I PACAP receptor appears to mediate the action of PACAP in the subpicomolar range. Finally, we hypothesize that PACAP is a pancreatic peptide of both neural and islet origin and functions as an intrinsic potentiator of glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic islets (FIG 6).",

Patients on nadolol alone received a single oral 40 mg daily dose. Every second day the dose was titrated to achieve 20-25% decrease in resting heart rate (maximum dose 160 mg daily). Patients receiving both drugs received nadolol as above then isosorbide mononitrate was added starting with 10 mg orally twice daily, which was increased to 20 mg unless hypotension or severe headache occurred. The main endpoint was the occurrence of variceal bleeding of any severity. Patients were followed up for up to 40 months.",

    "22": "Mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene on chromosome 14 are linked to autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The amino acid sequence of PS-1 predicts an integral membrane protein and immunocytochemical studies indicate that PS-1 is localized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We report that expression of PS-1 mutation L286V in cultured PC12 cells exaggerates Ca2+ responses to agonists (carbachol and bradykinin) that induce Ca2+ release from ER. Cells expressing L286V exhibit enhanced elevations of [Ca2+]i following exposure to amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) and increased vulnerability to A beta toxicity. An antagonist of voltage-dependent calcium channels (nifedipine), and a blocker of Ca2+ release from ER (dantrolene), counteract the adverse consequences of the PS-1 mutation. By perturbing Ca2+ homeostasis, PS-1 mutations may sensitize neurons to A beta-induced apoptosis.", 
    "23": "Recent reports have confirmed the involvement of neurosteroids in a number of neurophysiological processes, including sleep, and that these compounds interact with the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A complex. As many of the behavioural effects of pentobarbital are as a result of the activity at this complex, we investigated the role of corticosteroid-like neurosteroids in regulation of sleep, using metyrapone as a tool. Metyrapone, a blocker of the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxylase, which is essential for the biosynthesis of corticosteroids, when administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) at low doses (50-5000 ng) caused a dose-dependent reduction in sleep time induced by pentobarbital. This effect was, however, antagonized by concomitant administration of anti-corticotropin-releasing factor antisera. The present study reveals for the first time that corticosteroid-like neurosteroids might be involved in the regulation of CNS excitability.", 
    "24": "Strong evidence has recently been reported that major depression is accompanied by an acute phase response (APR), characterized by elevated levels of positive acute phase proteins (APPs) and decreased levels of negative APPs. The APR is also reflected in lowered total serum protein (TSP) and specific changes in the major electrophoretically separated protein fractions. The present study examined pretreatment and posttreatment serum TSP and the concentrations and percentages of the major electrophoretically separated serum protein fractions in 37 major depressed subjects, of whom 29 had treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and in 29 normal controls. We found that TSP and the percentage and concentration of serum albumin (Alb) and gamma-globulin fraction were significantly lower in major depression and TRD than in normal controls. Serum beta-globulin concentrations were significantly lower in major depressed and TRD subjects than in normal controls. The percentages of the alpha 1- and alpha 2-globulin fractions were significantly higher in major depressed subjects than in normal controls. There were no significant effects of subchronic treatment with antidepressants on TSP, the percentage or concentration of the major electrophoretically separated protein fractions, i.e. alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-globulin. There was a significant increase in percentage of the gamma-globulin fraction after subchronic treatment with antidepressants. The results support the hypothesis that major depression and TRD are accompanied by a chronic APR.",

Chronic treatment with both drugs causes increases in extracellular 5-HT through 5-HT reuptake inhibition and desensitization of inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors. It has been shown that pindolol, a serotonin (5-HT)1A-receptor antagonist, may shorten the latency of onset of SSRIs in depression. The aim of the present study was to examine whether pindolol may increase the efficacy of a subtherapeutical dosage of trazodone in the treatment of major depression and TRD, defined according to the Thase and Rush criteria (1995). Thirty-three major depressed inpatients of whom 26 with TRD participated in this study. Ten days after hospitalization, treatment with trazodone 100 mg/day was started. After 1 week trazodone treatment, patients were randomized-using a double blind placebo controlled design-to receive trazodone 100 mg/day+placebo; trazodone 100 mg/day+pindolol 7.5 mg/day: or trazodone 100 mg/day+fluoxetine 20 mg/day and treated during 4 weeks. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was used as outcome measure. It was found that trazodone+pindolol was as effective as trazodone+fluoxetine in the treatment of major depression and TRD and significantly more effective than trazodone+placebo. Using an outcome measure of 50% reduction in the HDRS, we found that 72.5% of the depressed patients treated with trazodone+pindolol and 75% of depressed patients treated with trazodone+fluoxetine showed a clinically significant response compared with 20.0% of trazodone+placebo-treated patients.",

We found that hypoxia for 72 hours increased myocardial membrane beta 1-adrenergic receptor density by 44%.

    "37": "There are significant Ca2+-independent increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate during various CNS insults such as ischemia and anoxia. However, the cellular sources of such presumed nonvesicular excitatory amino acid (EAA) release have not been established. To further explore potential mechanisms and sites for EAA release, we studied the release of preloaded [3H]-D-aspartate from primary cultured astrocytes prepared from the cerebral cortices of rat pups. Two phases of release were seen in response to raised KCl. The first phase was small and transient, and the second phase was slower and increased progressively. The initial phase of [3H]-D-aspartate release was greatly enhanced by ouabain pretreatment and was inhibited when astrocytes were preexposed to the EAA transport inhibitor threo-hydroxy beta-aspartic acid (THBA). Neither of these manipulations affected the second release component. The second phase of release was inhibited by an anion channel blocker, L-644,711, which is known to inhibit hypotonic swelling-induced release of EAA. Ouabain also resulted in the first phase of release occurring at lower [K+]o. Omission of Ca2+ had no effect on either phase of [3H]-D-aspartate release. These results support the hypothesis that the first component of release in cultured astrocytes is a reversal of the glutamate transporter, and the second component is a result of high KCl-induced swelling. Because marked increases in [K+]o are well established in CNS pathologies such as ischemia, such release may represent a significant source for the increased extracellular EAAs seen in such conditions.", 
    "38": "In contrast to Vaughan Williams class I drugs, class III drugs, such as d-sotalol, may not be negative inotropic. These drugs block potassium ion channels and prolong repolarization, theoretically leading to improved contractility. We investigated the hemodynamic actions of acute intravenous administration of 1.5 mg/kg of d-sotalol in 28 patients with congestive heart failure randomized to receive placebo (n = 10) or active drug (n = 18) in a double-blind study. A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed in all patients > or = 16 hours before drug administration. All hemodynamic variables were assessed at baseline and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after administration of the drug. Electrocardiograms were obtained before and 1, 2, 4, and 12 hours after drug administration. The QT interval increased from 370 +/- 9 to 426 +/- 14 ms at 1 hour, whereas the QTc increased from 433 +/- 5 to 470 +/- 12 ms (both p < 0.001). The increase was still statistically significant at 12 hours. There was no change in the placebo group. Although heart rate decreased in the d-sotalol group (84 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 2 at 1 hour, p < 0.001), there were no changes in blood pressure or right atrial pressure. Cardiac index decreased slightly (2.0 +/- 0.2 to 1.9 +/- 0.1 mm Hg), consistent with the lower heart rate. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 18.9 +/- 2.4 to 17.9 +/- 1.9 mm Hg at 1 hour despite reduced cardiac index. We conclude that in contrast to class I, II, and IV antiarrhythmic drugs, d-sotalol exerts no clinically important acute hemodynamic actions at doses that produce electrophysiologic effects.", 
    "39": "Metoprolol is a widely used anti-ischemic drug with a relatively short half-life. To improve patient' compliance and to provide 24-hour coverage, its once daily ORally OSmotic (OROS) formulation was developed. In this multicenter double-blind study, the anti-ischemic effects of metoprolol OROS given once daily at doses of 190 and 285 mg were compared to the regular metoprolol formulation of 100 mg 2 or 3 times daily. Sixty-five patients with stable coronary artery disease, positive exercise tests, and ischemic episodes during daily activity as recorded by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (AEM) were included. In the OROS group, 23 patients completed all 3 treatment periods. In these patients, the number of myocardial ischemic episodes decreased from 239 on placebo to 128 during the 190 mg/day dose (p < 0.0001) and to 86 during the 285 mg/day treatment period (p < 0.0001). In the metoprolol group, there were 204 episodes at baseline and 142 and 140 during the 100 mg 2 or 3 times daily treatment periods (p < 0.0001 for both). During exercise testing, time to 1-mm ST depression increased significantly in the OROS group from 6.3 minutes at baseline to 7.1 and 9.6 minutes during 190- and 285-mg treatment periods. In the metoprolol group, it increased from 5.8 to 7.2 and 8.2 minutes, respectively. Both formulations of metoprolol were well tolerated. The OROS formulation was highly effective in suppressing daily and exercise-induced ischemia and exerted its effect throughout the 24-hour period.", 
    "40": "Mortality in patients with congestive heart failure has been assessed in several large scale multicentric studies, confirming the therapeutic effect of certain treatments and raising questions as to the efficacy of other, sometimes new propositions. Conversion enzyme inhibitors are currently considered to be the first line treatment for heart failure because of their beneficial effect on mortality figures and their capacity to prevent aggravation. These drugs should always be prescribed for patients without contraindications, together with diuretics when signs of congestion develop, and digitalis in case of non-response, then finally nitroglycerin. Debate is still open on the effect of beta-blockers and amiodarone which should be reserved for use by specialists since it has not been definitely proven that they can lengthen survival time. Certain other drugs have given disappointing results compared with early expectations: direct vasodilators, positive inotrops (with the possible exception of vesnarinone), and class Ic antiarrhythmics. Finally several drugs in the development or research stage may prove to be effective in improving heart function, intermediary criteria and, most importantly, survival.", 
    "41": "Prejunctional modulation of noradrenaline release has been studied extensively in various experimental preparations. However, the presence and importance of prejunctional noradrenaline release modulation in human cardiac tissue is still unclear. In this study, we have used superfused human right atrial appendages excised from patients undergoing open heart surgery. The tissues were cut into six pieces and incubated with [3H]noradrenaline (4 microCi/ml. 0.2 microM) for 30 min at 37 degrees C. The tissues were then inserted into a suprafusion system and washed for 75 min with a Krebs-Henseleit solution at a rate of 0.4 ml/min. The experimental protocol consisted of a 60-min perfusion period during which a field stimulation (2 ms pulses, 60 s. 50 mA, 5 Hz) was delivered at 10 and 45 min. The effect of the drugs on the stimulation-induced outflow of radioactivity was determined by adding them 20 min before the second stimulation. Each experiment was carried out with or without desipramine (1 microM) to study the influence of the reuptake blockade. Fenoterol (1-1000 nM), a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, and angiotensin II (1-1000 nM) significantly increased noradrenaline release in a concentration-dependent manner. The administration of arecaidine propargyl ester (0.03-3 microM), a non-specific muscarinic receptor agonist, and propylnorapomorphine (0.1 nM-1 microM), a DA2-dopaminergic agonist, produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the stimulation-induced outflow of radioactivity. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, oxymetazoline (1 microM) inhibited noradrenaline release at a stimulation frequency of 2 Hz, but not at 5 and 10 Hz. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan (1 microM), significantly increased the release of noradrenaline at 2 and 5 Hz but not at 10 Hz. The results obtained in the present study demonstrated the presence of the facilitatory beta 2-adrenoceptor and angiotensin II receptor as well as the presence of inhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptor, muscarinic and DA2-dopamine receptors in the human atrial appendage.", 
    "42": "Previously reported methods for the determination of celiprolol in plasma could not be satisfactorily employed due to interference from plasma components. Thus, an improved, convenient and efficient method for the determination of the plasma concentration of celiprolol was developed using a simple solvent extraction step followed by high-performance liquid chromatography on a silanol deactivated C18 column with fluorescence detection. The plasma interference was resolved from celiprolol and the typical trailing of basic compounds on reversed-phase HPLC was eliminated. The peak-area ratio versus plasma concentration was linear over the range of 5-1000 ng/ml and the detection limit was 5 ng/ml.", 
    "43": "The beta-adrenoceptor subtypes and the roles of myeloperoxidase and prostaglandin E2 in the anti-ulcer effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were studied. A non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, or selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, metoprolol (a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) or butoxamine (a beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) were used. Propranolol given either intraperitoneally or orally reduced ethanol-induced mucosal damage and myeloperoxidase activity. Oral administration of butoxamine produced similar effects. The blood neutrophil count was increased after ethanol administration and this was reversed by the two drugs. Metoprolol did not affect myeloperoxidase activity, neutrophil count and mucosal damage under these experimental conditions. Oral administration of propranolol or butoxamine increased mucosal prostaglandin E2 level. It is concluded that the inflammatory responses to ethanol, as indicated by neutrophil infiltration in gastric mucosa, can be specifically inhibited by drugs that block beta 2-adrenoceptors. This action would explain in part why propranolol and butoxamine but not metoprolol lessened gastric damage. In addition, oral administration of propranolol and butoxamine increased the mucosal prostaglandin E2 level, which could partially contribute to their anti-ulcer effects.", 
    "44": "In neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid, NG1O8-15, cells transfected to stably express a constitutively active mutant (CAM) form of the human beta2-adrenoceptor, the beta-adrenoceptor ligands sotalol and betaxolol functioned as inverse agonists as they reduced basal adenylyl cyclase activity whereas the antagonists dihydroalprenolol and propranolol did not. Maintained presence of the CAMbeta2-adrenoceptor inverse agonists but not the antagonists in the culture medium of the cells resulted in a substantial, concentration-dependent, up-regulation of the CAMbeta2-adrenoceptor. Up-regulation of the CAMbeta2-adrenoceptor by the inverse agonists was prevented by co-incubation of the cells with either propranolol or dihydroalprenolol. Neither maintained elevation of cAMP levels nor the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity altered the ability of the inverse agonist ligands to cause receptor up-regulation.", 
    "45": "Pathological blocking of the Autonomous Nervous System (ANS) is diagnosed for patients having Autonomic Neuropathy passing a well-defined set of criteria. In this work, It is shown that standard analysis can be complemented by a study of the chaotic dynamics of the Heart Rate (HR), over a period of 12 min in the resting position. It was found that patients who suffering from ANS blockade, typically exhibit a smaller degree of fractality and complexity of the chaotic attractor reconstructed from the time series of the HR signal. These dynamical measures are more evident in normal human subjects that have been subjected to pharmacological ANS blockade.",

    "49": "Early detection of bleeding site by immediate endoscopy is the key of effective treatment in massive upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Upper GI endoscopy gives useful information about the risk, re-bleeding and mortality. Algorithm of treatment is also based on findings upon early endoscopy. Meta-analysis of prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trials assessing H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump-inhibitors in the treatment of peptic ulcers suggest that these drugs cannot be justified for stopping bleeding or prevent re-bleeding. Other drugs, such as somatostatin, might be effective, but further studies are needed to prove their effectiveness. Both vasopressin and somatostatin are also successfully employed the treatment of bleeding related to portal hypertension, and a recent meta-analysis found significant benefit for beta-blockade in the prevention of recurrent bleeding. Although beta-blocker therapy does not improve survival, it reduces re-bleeding rate, therefore, it can be used as prophylactic therapy for esophageal varices. As for the treatment of erosions, none of the drugs currently employed are effective in reducing or preventing clinically significant bleeding.", 
    "50": "The gastrointestinal therapeutic system formulation of nifedipine enables a once-daily dosing resulting in predictable, relatively constant plasma concentrations. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of this formulation and to compare this with the beta-blocker atenolol, we conducted a double-blind, randomised, multi-centre study in 129 male patients with documented exercise induced angina pectoris. After 4 weeks' treatment, nifedipine (60 mg), improved time to onset of 0.1 mV ST-segment depression from 536 s by 72 +/- 117s, time to onset of pain from 619 s by 56 +/- 120 s, and total exercise time from 685 s by 40 +/- 88 s. Atenolol 100 mg, had a comparable effect, time to onset of 0.1 mV ST-segment depression improved from 496 s by 53 +/- 129 s, time to onset of pain from 572 s by 57 +/- 118 s, and total exercise time from 653 s by 33 +/- 99 s. Between group analysis revealed no statistically significant differences for these exercise parameters. Atenolol, but not nifedipine, significantly reduced heart rate and systolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise (P < 0.001 between groups), indicating different modes of action of the drugs. With regard to safety, both drugs were generally well tolerated. There were significantly (P = 0.01) more vasodilation related side effects with nifedipine. These data demonstrate that gastrointestinal therapeutic system formulation of nifedipine and atenolol as once-daily monotherapy are equally effective and safe, but with different effects on exercise parameters.", 
    "51": "More than 25 years of developing doping control methods have led to comprehensive screening and confirmation procedures for stimulants, narcotics and beta-blockers. Much of this work has been initiated and/or improved by the late Prof. Dr. Manfred Donike. The methodological approach covered in this overview was applied to doping control procedures during the XXV Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992 and the XVII Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, in 1994. Urine samples are screened through a combination of two analytical methods that are complementary: (a) gas chromatographic analysis of the parent compound and unconjugated metabolites, following single-step sample extraction and detection by a nitrogen-specific detector based on a retention index identification system and (b) gas chromatographic analysis including also conjugated drugs and metabolites after hydrolysis, solid-phase extraction, derivatisation and mass spectrometric detection. Confirmation and identification is always performed by gas chromatographic separation and full scan mass spectrometric detection. These methods facilitate the rapid screening and confirmation of more than 100 stimulants, narcotic analgesics and beta-blockers in urine for at least 24 h after the intake of a pharmaceutical dose. Application of the methods ensures high quality standards for the unequivocal identification of doping agents as well as a rapid turnaround time for sample analyses.",

One hundred ninety-four patients survived to be discharged from the hospital, and 192 of these were followed for two years. Overall mortality after discharge from the hospital was significantly lower among the atenolol-treated patients than among those who were given placebo over the six months following hospital discharge (0 vs. 8 percent, P<0.001), over the first year (3 percent vs. 14 percent, P=0.005), and over two years (10 percent vs. 21 percent, P=0.019). The principal effect was a reduction in deaths from cardiac causes during the first six to eight months.

In femoral artery of 3-week-old rats, norepinephrine (NE) at 1 nM-0.1 microM concentration-dependently produced a contraction but, at higher concentrations (0.3-30 microM), NE relaxed the tissue. 2. In aorta of the 3-week-old rat, NE elicited a contraction at 1 nM to 0.3 microM and a relaxation at 1 microM and higher. 3. The magnitude of the NE-induced relaxation in the aorta was much less than that in the femoral artery. 4. Atenolol (a beta(1)-selective antagonist) modulated these NE responses in the femoral artery and butoxamine (a beta(2)-selective antagonist) in the aorta. 5. Subcutaneous application of propranolol and isoproterenol for 10 days in 4-week-old rats sensitized and desensitized the NE-induced relaxation, respectively. 6. It is suggested that, in the young rat, beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors contribute the NE-induced relaxation in the femoral artery and aorta, respectively, and that beta-adrenoceptors may contribute to the limitation of NE-induced vasoconstriction in certain types of vascular beds.",

Congenital myotonias are hereditary affections and do not present muscular dystrophy. The current trend is to group them as ionic channels diseases, together with the periodic paralysis. The authors accompanied the cases of seven patients, six males and one female, with ages ranging from 16 to 48 years (average 27 years) and onset of symptoms between 1 and 10 years (average 5 years). These patients presented a myotonic phenomenon unleashed by intensive contraction and global muscular hypertrophy. Three patients were diagnosed as cases of Becker type generalized myotonia because they presented a recessive autosomic heredity and/or transient episodes of muscular weakness. Two patients fitted the description of Thomsen congenital myotonia, with a pattern of dominating autosomic heredity and/or absence of weakness episodes or worsening factors for their condition. Two patients presented fluctuating myotonia, which because worse in cold weather or at potassium intake. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed through complementary tests (electroneuromyography, muscle biopsy and DNA study). Each of the patients made use of different drugs, in the search of optimal lessening of their myotonia. There were five reports of amelioration with the use of diphenilhydantoine; one report with the use of carbamazepine; three reports with the use of acetazolamide; one report with the use of a calcium channel blocker; one report with the use of a beta-adrenergic; one report with the use of thiazide; and none with the use of quinidine/procainamide.",

New techniques for culturing glomerular endothelial cells have been established recently. The effect of extracellular ATP on membrane voltage and intracellular calcium activity was examined in bovine glomerular endothelial cells (GEC) in culture. 2. Membrane voltage was measured with the patch clamp technique in the fast whole cell configuration. GEC possess a stable membrane voltage of -88 mV. ATP induced a small transient hyperpolarization, which was followed by a depolarization. The ATP-induced depolarization was significantly inhibited by flufenamate, a blocker of non-selective ion channels. 3. The intracellular calcium activity [Ca2+]i was measured in single cells with the fura-2 technique. ATP stimulated an increase of [Ca2+]i. The increase of [Ca2+]i was biphasic with an initial peak followed by a sustained plateau. The [Ca2+]i peak was still present in an extracellular Ca(2+)-free solution, whereas the plateau was inhibited. 4. The order of potency of different purine nucleotides in stimulating [Ca2+]i and inositol formation was UTP = ATP > ATP-gamma-S > 2-methylthio ATP > [alpha,beta-CH2]ATP. 5.

In the present study the release of ATP and noradrenaline from human kidney cortex was investigated. Vascular effects of ATP and stable analogues were tested in human and rabbit isolated renal blood vessels. 2. Sympathetic nerve stimulation (20 Hz for 1 min) in human kidney slices released 89 +/- 16 fmol noradrenaline per mg wet weight and 99 +/- 20 fmol ATP per mg wet weight in controls (n = 12). The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 microM) abolished ATP and noradrenaline release. 3. In human isolated extrarenal arteries the P2X-purinoceptor agonist beta, gamma-methylene-L-ATP caused almost no constrictor responses, beta, gamma-methylene-L-ATP induced moderate constrictor responses in intrarenal arteries. In preconstricted human intrarenal arteries ATP induced vasodilation. 4. ATP and the P2Y-receptor agonist 2-methyl-thio-ATP (2-MeSATP) dilated preconstricted rabbit renal arteries. The P2Y-receptor antagonist Reactive Blue 2 (3 microM) shifted the concentration response curves of ATP and 2-MeSATP to the right. 5. In conclusion, sympathetic nerve stimulation induces the release of ATP and noradrenaline in human renal cortex. ATP activates vasoconstrictory P2X- and vasodilatory P2Y-receptors in human renal blood vessels. The net vascular response to ATP in vivo will depend on the tissue distribution of these purinoceptors.", 
    "65": "In normal as well as in asymptomatic subjects, inhaled norepinephrine (NE) induced bronchoconstriction and respiratory asynchronism only after pretreatment by propranolol. However, lower doses of beta-receptor blocker were needed in asthmatics to reveal NE constrictive properties. These airways resistance increases were prevented by phentolamine. These pharmacological data indicate that the resting bronchial tone is relaxed permanently by beta-adrenergic receptors stimulation whose suppression unmasks alpha-induced constriction. Bronchial relaxing properties predominate normally in man and in guinea pigs, as previously demonstrated (Marcelle, 1996).", 
    "66": "The bronchial reactivity of fifty-one Hartley strain guinea-pigs, anesthetized with pentobarbital, was tested for aerosolized norepinephrine (NE) or phenylephrine (PE) in 1% saline solutions (total inhaled dose: 2 mg in 2 min). No changes in their total airways resistances was observed at the end of the tests. When the same animals were pretreated by inhalation of nebulized propanolol (4 mg in 5 min), NE provoked a significant increase in these airway resistances in 72% of the animals for a mean inhaled dose of 1.07 mg. The NE challenge was stopped as soon as ventilatory asynchronism developed. Similar responses were induced by PE inhalation. These increases in airways resistance were prevented when phentolamine aerosol (1.3 mg inhaled in 5 min) was inhaled before NE or PE tests. An alpha 1-adrenergic bronchoconstriction is thus provoked by NE or PE when the protection resulting from the bronchial beta-adrenergic dilation has been suppressed. This constriction presents important individual variations depending on the activity or on the number of the corresponding alpha-receptors; in 28% of the guinea-pigs, the bronchomotor tone remained unaffected by NE in spite of beta-antagonist pretreatment.",

Marked sinus bradycardia was noted after receiving total dose of intravenous labetalol and treated [corrected] with intravenous atropine 0.4 mg. The total operation time was 6.5 h. We found that under isoflurane anesthesia, duration of action of intravenous labetalol was prolonged as adequate intraoperative blood pressure control was obtained throughout the 6-h surgical period without further need of supplementary medication. This finding suggested that duration of labetalol was extended when concomitantly used with isoflurane and the labetalol dosage in our regimen could be effectively used in surgical procedures lasting for more than 6 h.",

Myocardial ischaemia in those patients may be promoted apart from accelerated atherosclerosis also by many extracoronary and extracardial factors. In a group of 60 haemodialyzed patients followed up on a long-term basis silent myocardial ischaemia is encountered during 24-hour Holter monitoring in 30-40% of the examined patients. Its occurrence at the end of haemodialysis and during the early posthemodialytic period and its long persistence are typical. The authors examined 20 regularly dialyzed patients with transient depressions of the ST segment in whom they tested retarded nitroglycerin, metoprolol and verapamil. All three drugs had a significant effect on the myocardial ischaemia (intensity and duration of depressions of the ST segment). In addition to correction of the modifying factors of silent myocardial ischaemia the authors prefer verapamil in order to influence the negative sequelae of secondary hyperparathyroidism. If pharmacotherapy of myocardial ischaemia is ineffective, in patients on regular dialysis treatment stress radionuclide scintigraphy or echocardiography and selective coronarography are indicated, which decide on a possible revascularization operation in these risk patients already during the pretransplantation period.", 
    "77": "We propose the following guidelines for treatment of hypertension in the elderly. 1. Indications for Treatment. 1) Age: Lifestyle modification is recommended for patients aged 85 years and older. Antihypertensive therapy should be limited to patients in whom the merit of the treatment is obvious. 2) Blood pressure: Systolic BP > 160 mmHg, diastolic BP > 90 approximately 10 mmHg. Systolic BP < age + 100 mmHg for those aged 70 years and older. Patients with mild hypertension (140-160/ 90-95 mmHg) associated with cardiovascular disease should be considered for antihypertensive drug therapy. 2. Goal of Therapy for BP: The goal BP in elderly patients is higher than that in younger patients (BP reduction of 10-20 mmHg for systolic BP and 5-10 mmHg for diastolic BP). In general, 140-160/< 90 mmHg is recommended as the goal. However, lowering the BP below 150/85 should be done with caution. 3. Rate of Lowering BP: Start with half the usual dose, observe at the same dose for at least four weeks, and reach the target BP over two months. Increasing the dose of antihypertensive drugs should be done very slowly. 4. Lifestyle Modification: 1) Dietary modification: (1) Reduction of sodium intake is highly effective in elderly patients due to their high salt-sensitivity. NaCl intake of less than 10 g/day is recommended. Serum Na+ should be occasionally measured. (2) Potassium supplementation is recommended, but with caution in patients with renal insufficiency. (3) Sufficient intake of calcium and magnesium is recommended. (4) Reduce saturated fatty acids. Intake of fish is recommended. (2) Regular physical activity: Recommended exercise for patients aged 60 years and older: peak heart rate 110/minute, for 30-40 minutes a day, 3-5 days a week. (3) Weight reduction. (4) Moderation of alcohol intake, smoking cessation. 5. Pharmacologic Treatment: 1) Initial drug therapy. First choice: Long-acting (once or twice a day) Ca antagonists or ACE inhibitors. Second choice: Thiazide diuretics (combined with potassium-sparing diuretic). 2) Combination therapy. (1) For patients without complications, either of the following is recommended. i) Ca antagoinst + ACE inhibitor, ii) ACE inhibitor + Ca antagonist (or low-dose diuretics), iii) diuretic + Ca antagonist (or ACE inhibitor), iv) beta-blockers, alpha 1-blockers, alpha + beta blockers can be used according to the patho-physiological state of the patient. (2) For patients with complications. Drug(s) should be selected according to each complication. 3) Relatively contraindicated drugs. beta-Blockers and alpha 1-blockers are relatively contraindicated in elderly patients with hypertension in Japan. Centrally acting agents such as reserpine, methyldopa and clonidine are also relatively contraindicated beta-Blockers are contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure, arteriosclerosis obliterans, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus (or glucose intolerance), or bradycardia. These conditions are often present in elderly subjects. Elderly subjects are susceptible to alpha 1-blocker-induced orthostatic hypotension, since their baroreceptor reflex is diminished. Orthostatic hypotension may cause falls and bone fractures in the elderly.", 
    "78": "In cirrhosis, intrahepatic shunts and capillarization of sinusoids can result in impaired extraction of substrates by the liver irrespective of the metabolic capacity of the liver (intact hepatocyte theory). To evaluate the role of anomalies of uptake in impaired drug disposition, we studied the steady-state hepatic clearance and single-pass hepatic uptake of propranolol in isolated perfused livers obtained from patients with cirrhosis at the time of transplantation and from organ donors with normal liver architecture. The kinetics of propranolol transport in the liver were characterized by means of the multiple-indicator dilution technique, and the outflow pattern of propranolol in the hepatic veins was resolved into throughput material, which had swept past the hepatocytes along with albumin, and returning material, which had entered the cells but returned in the outflow after escaping cellular sequestration and metabolism. The steady-state clearance of propranolol was decreased in cirrhotics compared with organ donors, and the outflow profile differed between the two groups. In cirrhotic livers, half of the propranolol in the outflow consisted of throughput material and the other half of returning material; in organ donors, all of the propranolol in the outflow was returning material. In the presence of albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein in the perfusate, about 80-85% of propranolol was protein bound; removal of albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein from the perfusate it cirrhotic livers resulted in an increase in the free fraction of propranolol, an increase in steady-state extraction, and a decrease in the throughput component of propranolol in the outflow. We conclude that impaired uptake of protein-bound propranolol, as a result of capillarization and intrahepatic shunts, contributes to its impaired elimination in cirrhosis.", 
    "79": "The aim of this study was to set-up and validate the use of a radio-telemetry system in order to record IOP in chronic ocular hypertensive animals. The transmitter of a miniaturized radio-telemetry system was implanted in rabbits, and its catheter was tunnelled subcutaneously to the superior conjunctival sac and inserted into the midvitreous. Implantation was performed in chronic ocular hypertensive rabbits induced by an injection of alpha-chymotrypsin into the posterior chamber of the eye. The effects of 0.5% timolol maleate, 2% dorzolamide hydrochloride and 1% epinephrine were assessed and compared after topical administration in this model. Implanted radio-telemetric system into the vitreous allowed IOP measurement for more than 6 months. In this study, circadian IOP kinetic profiles were monitored in all animals over 24 h for 3 weeks. Timolol maleate was found significantly potent in reducing IOP, while changes depended on the nyctemeral period. Dorzolamide hydrochloride induced a very large IOP reduction and was found to be also well effective at night. We evidenced a biphasic time-dependent effect after topical epinephrine, with a long lasting IOP increase occurring after the administration. This change was found to be related to side effects resulting from a poor ocular tolerance of this drug in the rabbit, leading to either a complete eye closure or a higher blinking rate. By using our method, we confirmed the pressure pulses and undershoots occurring during blinking. Radio-telemetry in chronic glaucoma rabbits appears as a refined method to assess anti-glaucoma drug activity, 24 hours a day, for long-term periods in unrestrained animals, while also providing information on the ocular side effects of eye drops.", 
    "80": "First-line antihypertensive monotherapy is effective in reducing blood pressure to within the normal range in approximately 50% of patients. Normalisation in the remaining patients may require a combination of two or more drugs. This review considers the clinical efficacy and tolerability of combinations involving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The efficacy of combinations with diuretics or calcium antagonists, as initial therapy or in patients with inadequate responses to monotherapy, has been demonstrated in many trials. With combination therapy, normalisation rates approaching 80% can be achieved using submaximal doses of both components. Therapy with both combinations is well tolerated; with ACE inhibitors reducing the diuretic metabolic effects or counteracting some calcium antagonist-associated vasodilatory effects. Data on ACE inhibitors with beta-blockers are limited. When patients respond inadequately to first-line monotherapy, the increasing availability of drug combinations will allow individual selection of the most appropriate combination, taking account of additional risk factors and concomitant disease.", 
    "81": "Stereoselective interaction of drugs with human serum transferrin in capillary zone electrophoresis is described. The substances passed a pseudo-stationary protein zone applied in a coated capillary and the possible chiral separation of the optical isomers was followed. Drugs with different structures were screened and the enantiomers of bupivacaine, propranolol and promethazine as well as the diastereomers of labetalol were resolved. Racemic mixtures of atenolol and pindolol enantiomers could not be resolved under these conditions.", 
    "82": "The mechanisms associated with insulin-induced cardiovascular inhibitory responses were evaluated in untreated normal rats and in normal rats pretreated with an antagonist of nitric oxide (NO) production (L-NAME), with cholinergic, alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists, or after ganglionic blockade. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with a mixture of urethane and alpha-chloralose and placed on a electric heating pad. The femoral artery and vein were cannulated for measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, plasma glucose, blood sampling, and intravenous injections. Intravenous injection of insulin (5.0 U/kg) in untreated rats resulted in a significant and sustained decrease in arterial blood pressure (average 24%) and in a slight decrease in heart rate. These cardiovascular responses were blocked by L-NAME and by the cholinergic antagonist atropine, suggesting an involvement of NO and the cholinergic receptors, or an effect of insulin on the central nervous system parasympathetic center. The ganglionic blocker hexamethonium attenuated the insulin-induced response. On the other hand, the hypotensive effect of insulin persisted after sympathetic blockade with the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin and the beta-1 antagonist atenolol. We conclude that the insulin-induced decrease in blood pressure is due to both increased cholinergic outflow and to NO production and that an enhanced sympathetic activity possibly mediated by a reactive release of norepinephrine or epinephrine modulates this response.", 
    "83": "Administration of propranolol can provoke bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients. We hypothesized that such bronchoconstriction may result from the inflammatory mediators released by an allergic reaction. We recently developed a guinea pig model for propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction (PIB). Neuropeptides which are released from C-fibre nerve endings have been postulated to induce bronchial hyperresponsiveness through neurogenic inflammation.", 
    "84": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether sensory neuropeptides are involved in the development of PIB after allergic reaction.", 
    "85": "Propranolol at a concentration of 10 mg/ml was inhaled 20 min after antigen challenge in passively sensitized, anaesthetized and artificially ventilated guinea pigs. The animals were treated intravenously with a NK1 and NK2 dual antagonist, FK224, in a dose of 1 or 10 mg/kg or vehicle or a selective NK1 antagonist, FK888, in a dose of 1 or 10 mg/kg or vehicle 10 min before or 15 min after antigen challenge.", 
    "86": "Propranolol inhaled 20 min after antigen challenge caused bronchoconstriction. FK224 or FK888 administered 15 min after antigen challenge as well as 10 min before antigen challenge did not reduce the PIB.",

    "88": "To elucidate the adrenergic responsiveness of transplanted pancreatic islets, normal BALB/c mice received 150 syngeneic islets under the left kidney capsule. After 12-40 weeks, the grafts were removed and compared with untransplanted islets by an in vitro perifusion technique. Noradrenaline (NA), 3 mumol/l, completely inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release from untransplanted islets but not from grafts, whether or not the beta adrenergic blocker, L-propranolol, was present. UK-14,304, an alpha 2-specific adrenergic agonist, inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion from untransplanted islets by 80-92% at 0.1 or 1 mumol/l, and by 35-56% at 5-10 nmol/l. Insulin secretion from islet grafts was also markedly inhibited by 0.1 or 1 mumol/l, but not by 5 or 10 nmol/l, UK-14,304. It is suggested that the diminished adrenergic inhibition of insulin release from islet grafts reflects an altered function of the alpha 2 adrenoceptors on the beta-cells.", 
    "89": "Thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine; T3) has been shown to control the expression of beta 1-adrenergic receptors (beta 1-AR) in cardiac myocytes, but not in C6 glioma cells. This cell specificity has been attributed to low expression of T3 receptors and high expression of the c-erbA alpha 2 splice variant that interferes with the action of T3. To check this hypothesis we have expressed the c-erbA/thyroid hormone receptor (TR) alpha 1 gene in C6 glioma cells and investigated their response to thyroid hormone. Cells expressing TR alpha 1, but not wild-type cells, were responsive to T3 as shown by increased expression of mitochrondrial hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthase after T3 exposure. However, T3 had no effect on beta 1-AR gene expression in either set of cells. The beta 1-AR mRNA concentrations were, however, altered by retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Retinoic acid caused a rapid up-regulation of beta 1-AR mRNA levels that was blocked by cycloheximide. Retinoic acid did not increase the beta 1-AR gene transcription rate in run-on experiments. These results indicate an indirect post-transcriptional effect of RA. Control of beta 1-AR expression in C6 cells is also exerted at the translational level, because there was no correlation between mRNA and protein induction, as determined by radioligand binding studies. We conclude that lack of responsiveness of the beta 1-AR gene in C6 cells to T3 is not due to high expression of c-erbA alpha 2 but to undefined cell-specific factors.", 
    "90": "Essential hypertension is known to be associated with a decrease in the lumen diameter and an increase in the wall thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio of the resistance vessels. Recently, it has been clarified that this alteration does not necessarily involve vascular growth, but could be due to a rearrangement of the same amount of material, a phenomenon now termed 'eutrophic remodelling'.", 
    "91": "This review summarizes work aimed at determining the extent to which angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment is able to normalize these abnormalities, and whether this is desirable.", 
    "92": "In essential hypertension, the changes seen in subcutaneous resistance vessels appear to be mainly due to eutrophic remodelling and only a small portion to growth. In addition, rat studies indicate that eutrophic remodelling, rather than growth, is found in all vascular beds. Antihypertensive treatment of hypertensive rats with ACE inhibitors causes a dose-dependent regression of the media: lumen ratio. Clinical studies have now confirmed these findings, showing that when previously untreated essential hypertensive patients are treated with the ACE inhibitor perindopril the abnormal structure of resistance vessels regresses towards normal values; in contrast, treatment with a beta-blocker does not affect the abnormal vascular structure.", 
    "93": "The available evidence indicates that ACE inhibitors are able to normalize the abnormal resistance vessel structure seen in essential hypertension, and suggests that this effect may not only be dependent on their ability to reduce blood pressure.", 
    "94": "Findings from numerous epidemiologic and clinical studies worldwide attest to a strong, graded, consistent relationship between blood pressure level and cardiovascular-renal diseases, subclinical and clinical, nonfatal and fatal.", 
    "95": "This review summarizes results from selected prospective observational studies, primarily from US populations, and from randomized clinical trials. Review Analyses from the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) subjects (middle-aged men) and the Framingham Heart Study (middle-aged and elderly men and women) clearly establish that systolic blood pressure is a more powerful predictor of cardiovascular events than diastolic pressure. Wherever the full range of blood pressure has been examined, for example for systolic pressure in the MRFIT subjects and for diastolic pressure in pooled data from nine epidemiologic studies, the associations for coronary heart disease and stroke are seen to extend over the whole range, including 'normotensive' levels. In MRFIT, this continuous relationship has also recently been shown for end-stage renal disease and both systolic and diastolic pressure. Data from Framingham document further associations with peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, and both electrocardiographic and echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy. Several studies are row available demonstrating a relationship between hypertension and carotid wall intimal-medial thickness. Finally, the causal nature of the relationships with major cardiovascular events is supported by the results of 17 large-scale randomized trials of blood-pressure-lowering using primarily diuretic- and beta-blocker-based drug regimens.", 
    "96": "These trials have demonstrated highly significant reductions in fatal and nonfatal stroke and major coronary heart disease. There are few trial data, however, on health benefits from further reducing blood pressure among normotensive persons.", 
    "97": "To test the long-term effect of a beta-adrenergic agonist on Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity in rat lung explants, we measured the activity in lung explants kept continuously in the presence or absence of 0.1 mM terbutaline for 5 days. Once it was clear that this agent increased Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity, we then performed a similar measurement in cultured alveolar type II cells from rats. Continuous exposure to 0.1 mM terbutaline enhanced the enzyme activity in those cells, and this enhancement was completely blocked by 0.01 mM of the beta-antagonist propranolol. Western blotting showed that this increase in Na+/ K(+)-ATPase activity in the cells could involve modulation of protein expression. We conclude that beta-adrenergic agonists can increase Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity in alveolar type II cell in lung explants by modulating expression of the enzyme in a long period of time.", 
    "98": "Among the many factors involved in the development of glaucoma, the elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important. The treatment of glaucoma aims to lower IOP in order to maintain visual function. New anti-glaucoma drugs, latanoprost and nipradilol, have been shown to effect a reduction in IOP equal to that achieved with the equivalent dosage of timolol, with no adverse systemic side effects. The mechanism of the reduction of IOP by these drugs mainly involves the increase of uveoscleral outflow. The success rate of filtering surgery for glaucoma has been increased by using antimetabolites such as mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The use of MMC during surgery has resulted in a better outcome than with 5-FU. Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) cases are reported to constitute more than 60% of total glaucoma cases in Japan. NTG is different from primary open-angle glaucoma not only in IOP but also in the pattern of the visual field defect, cupping and peripapillary atrophy of the optic nerve head (ONH). The first choice of treatment for NTG is using drugs for reducing IOP and, if necessary, argon laser trabeculoplasty. In addition to these treatments a drug for increasing the blood circulation in the brain, brovinecamine fumarate, has shown beneficial effects in the treatment of NTG. NTG patients whose visual field can be shown by static perimetry to be deteriorating are indicated for filtering surgery. The results of filtering surgery for NTG have been confirmed that it is more effective than drugs for maintaining the visual field. We have developed an instrument using the laser speckle phenomenon for determining the microcirculation in the eye, as well as in the ONH, noninvasively, quantitatively, and repetitively. With the same instrument, the effects of anti-glaucomadrugs on ocular circulation, especially in the ONH, can also be determined. Timolol has no effect on the circulation in the ONH, but carteolol and betaxlol increase the circulation significantly. The Ca(+2)-blocker, nilvadipine, increases the circulation in the ONH. These findings indicate that the drugs increasing the ONH circulation many be beneficial for the control of glaucoma.", 
    "99": "The effects of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by isoprenaline (ISO) on action potential and membrane current were studied in the guinea-pig vas deferens in normal Krebs solution by using a double sucrose gap method. In current-clamp experiments, ISO produced the membrane hyperpolarization by reducing the resistance and modified the pattern of multi-spike activity elicited by long depolarizing currents; an initial spike potential was reduced in the amplitude and the rate of rising phases and the slope of diastolic depolarization was slowered, leading to a prolongation of the spike discharge interval. In voltage-clamp experiments, ISO greatly enhanced the late outward K+ current (Ik2) by increasing the conductance, but hardly affected the peak outward K+ current (Ik1). ISO also reduced the inward Ca2+ current (Ica) by decreasing the conductance (ga) as well as by reducing the driving force for Ca2+. While it increased the leakage conductance (g1) due to K+ associated with hyperpolarizing voltage steps. In the preparations treated with Ca2+ channel blocker such as D-600, the enhanced effect of ISO on the Ik was still prominent, suggesting that Ca2+ and K+ channels appear to be independently regulated during beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. These results suggest that ISO exerts depressant actions on the vas deferens muscle by reduction of the Ica as well as by prominent enhancement of the Ik2 via beta-adrenoceptor activation.",

Differences in the degree of tightness of the epithelial cell layers brought about a 30-fold difference in the transport of atenolol in favor of the leaky cell layers, while not affecting the transport of the lipophilic drug, propranolol. Within the log partition coefficient (PC) range of -0.62 (sotalol) and 3.44 (betaxolol), there was a hundred-fold difference in the Papp. A sigmoidal curve was used to depict the influence of lipophilicity on solute permeation across conjunctival epithelial cell layers. An effective half-maximal Papp was observed at a log PC value of 1.2.", 
    "103": "These findings on the lipophilicity effect on drug transport are generally similar to those reported for the isolated rabbit conjunctiva, suggesting the utility of cultured rabbit conjunctival epithelial cell layers as an in vitro model for evaluating drug transport.", 
    "104": "Two viscoelastic agents, Healon and Amvisc, both hyaluronic acids, were evaluated in two prospective, randomized and masked studies in order to compare the effects of the viscoelastics and timolol (Blocadren ) on the early postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) after planned extracapsular cataract extraction with implantation of a posterior chamber lens. The study protocols were similar, especially with regard to the sample size, pre-, per- and postoperative management and sampling. The IOP was measured preoperatively, 3-6 and 24 h postoperatively. The testing of Amvisc revealed that aspiration or non-aspiration of Amvisc at the end of surgery was of little importance for the IOP, and that timolol significantly reduced the IOP 3-6 h postoperatively in the order of about 8 mmHg. The postoperative IOP was lower for Amvisc than for Healon only when the viscoelastic material was aspirated and topical timolol was administered. In all the other groups there were no significant differences between the viscoelastics as far as the postoperative pressure was concerned. Multiple regression revealed a marked pressure reducing effect of timolol 3-6 h postoperatively in both groups, but no effect was observed 24 h postoperatively. The two viscoelastic agents showed minor effect on the IOP both 3-6 and 24 h postoperatively.",

In addition, we developed a multivariable model with receipt of therapy as the outcome and demographics, severity of illness, comorbidity, and algorithm-determined candidacy for therapy as covariates. The algorithms, developed as part of the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, were designed to identify an \"ideal\" pool of candidates for each therapy.",

Approximately 16.4% of patients received beta-adrenergic blockade, and 45.1% received aspirin, both with no racial difference. By multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio for African Americans receiving thrombolysis was 0.55 (95% CI 0.41, 0.76). The corresponding odds ratio was 1.25 (95% CI 0.99, 1.59) for beta-adrenergic blockade and 1.13 (95% CI 0.96, 1.37) for aspirin. African Americans presented later after the onset of chest pain, but the refusal rate of thrombolytic therapy did not differ.", 
    "111": "According to this analysis, Alabama physicians used beta-adrenergic blockade and aspirin equivalently in African Americans and Caucasians. African Americans received thrombolysis less often according to the crude analysis. The multivariable analysis suggests less use of thrombolytics, even after adjusting for several covariates including indication by clinical algorithm. However, the small number of African-American patients deemed ideal candidates for thrombolysis attenuates the precision of this finding.", 
    "112": "A 96-well plate format system is described for the in vitro culture and analysis of leptin secretion by mature adipocytes. Cultured adipocytes secreted leptin in a linear fashion over a 48 h period and secretion was inhibited by actinomycin D treatment. Dexamethasone and insulin stimulated leptin production in vitro, with dexamethasone proving a more potent stimulus throughout. Culture of adipocytes with insulin and dexamethasone together resulted in an additive release of leptin, suggesting that stimulation by these factors operates via independent routes. Isoprenaline (1 - 1000 microM) was a potent inhibitor of leptin production but propanolol (3 microM) could block this inhibition. Inclusion of growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 or tumor necrosis factor alpha did not affect leptin secretion by mature adipocytes.", 
    "113": "The effects of diadenosine tetraphosphate (AP4A) diadenosine pentaphosphate (AP5A) and diadenosine hexaphosphate (AP6A) on the cytosolic-free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were evaluated in cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) using the fluorescent dye technique. The addition of 10 mumol L-1 AP4A, AP5A or AP6A significantly increased [Ca2+]i in MCs by 57 +/- 9 nmol L-1 n = 17; P < 0.01), 76 +/- 27 nmol L-1 (n = 9; P < 0.01) or 65 +/- 12 nmol L-1 (n = 18; P < 0.01) respectively. In the absence of extracellular calcium, there was no significant change in [Ca2+]i in MCs after administration of diadenosine polyphosphates, indicating that these agents induce transplasma membrane Ca2+ influx. AP6A significantly enhanced the angiotensin II-induced changes in [Ca2+]i in MCs. The AP5A-induced transplasma membrane Ca2+ influx was inhibited by the P2 purinoceptor blockers suramin and pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS), but was not affected by the adenosine A1 receptor blocker 8-cyclopentyl-1.3-dipro-pylzanthine (CPDPX). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (ATP-gamma S) increased [Ca2+]i in MCs, whereas alpha, beta-methylene ATP had no effect on [Ca2+]i in MCs. Measurements of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid showed that AP5A and AP6A also stimulated phospholipase C, but had no effect on phospholipase D. The inhibition of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C significantly reduced the AP5A-induced [Ca2+]i increase. In summary, diadenosine polyphosphates induce Ca2+ influx through P2 purinoceptors and may be involved in the local regulation of vascular resistance evoked by the Ca(2+)-dependent contractile response of mesangial cells.", 
    "114": "The effects of whole-body gamma-radiation (10 Gy) on intestinal motor activity was examined in the small and large intestine of the guinea pig 18 hr post irradiation. Neurally mediated relaxations of isolated gut bath preparations were generally unaffected. However, the contractile responses to direct smooth muscle stimulation with the cholinergic muscarinic agonist carbachol or ganglionic stimulation of intrinsic cholinergic motor neurones were significantly increased in the duodenum and colon but not the jejunum. This increased sensitivity to cholinergic stimulation was reflected in an increased contractility and a shift in the concentration-response curves for carbachol. The specificity of radiation actions for cholinergic mediated contractions was further supported by the observation that histamine-evoked contractions were unaffected. In a second series of experiments we examined the effects of gamma-radiation on the rate of pellet expulsion from freshly excised colons. Both colons from irradiated animals and nonirradiated colons exposed to carbachol showed significantly faster rates of pellet expulsion, indicative of increased propulsive motility. Pretreatment of animals with 0.5 mg/kg sc of the 5HT3 receptor antagonist Granisetron prevented the effect of radiation and reduced the pellet expulsion rate to below normal. These results indicate that gastrointestinal motility disturbances seen in organ-bath preparations of the intestine from rats exposed to whole-body gamma-radiation may be related to an increased sensitivity of the cholinergic muscarinic system.", 
    "115": "The role of calcium in the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage cell line, J774.1, was investigated. Flow cytometric measurement of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca]i) using 2-(3,6-bis(acetyl-oxy)-2,7-dichloro-9H-xanthen-9-yl)benzoic acid (fluo-3)-loaded J774.1 cells revealed that LPS at more than 0.1 microgram/ml increased [Ca]i transiently in the presence or absence of serum, and that a mixture of a calcium chelator, ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), and a calcium release blocker from intracellular store sites, 8-(diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride (TMB-8), inhibited the [Ca]i response induced by LPS. In concordance with this, production of TNF-alpha was inhibited by EGTA and/or TMB-8. These reagents also reduced the level of TNF-alpha mRNA significantly. These results indicate that the transient increase of [Ca]i plays a role in LPS-induced expression of TNF-alpha by the macrophage cell line.",

There was a significant fall in mean arterial pressure (94.8 +/- 4.4 cf. 84.6 +/- 4.3 mmHg; p = 0.0001), which was particularly apparent in the diastolic blood pressure of those patients with ascites. The heart rate only fell significantly in the ascitic subjects. No significant changes occurred in the cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance. Unilateral renal vein flow as measured by the reverse thermodilution technique remained constant.",

    "120": "Arrhythmias induced by coronary artery ligation in cats, by CaCl2 and epinephrine in rats, and by ouabain in guinea-pigs were used as experimental models for studying the effects of a new calcium antagonist AR-1 ([1,2,5-trimethyl-4-phenyl-4-beta-(N-cyanoethyl-N-4'-methoxybenzyl) -ethylamino]piperidine, calcium channel blocker and calmodulin antagonist) on ventricular arrhythmias. Coronary ligation caused 90% lethality (ventricular fibrillation) with 12.5 min in untreated control cats, which was prevented by administration of AR-1 (4 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) before or after arrhythmia induction. Pretreatment with AR-1 afforded protection in a dose-related fashion. A dose of 1.5 mg/KG b.w. increased survival to 45%, and all cats dosed with 3 to 5 mg/Kg b.w. survived. CaCl2 (180 mg/Kg b.w., i.v.) induced ventricular fibrillation and 100% lethality. These effects were completely prevented by an anti-arrhythmic dose of AR-1 (3 mg/kg b.w.). Epinephrine-induced ventricular arrhythmias were also prevented by the same dose of AR-1. AR-1 (5 mg/kg b.w.) did not prevent ouabain (0.5 mg/kg b.w.)-induced arrhythmias that caused death within 17 +/- 3.7 min, but displayed protective effects during 67 +/- 7.7 min. The results from these animal studies, in conjunction with previously studies demonstrating coronarodilatory and anti-platelet efficacy of this compound, collectively suggest that AR-1 has a potential to become a useful antianginal and antiarrhythmic therapeutic agent.", 
    "121": "1. Previous evidence suggests that the dose-dependent bioavailability of racemic propranolol may be partly due to product inhibition. We have examined this further by studying the individual enantiomers of propranolol in the perfused rat liver (IPRL) and in rat liver microsomes. 2. In recirculating IPRL experiments, (R)-propranolol (n = 7) or (S)-propranolol (n = 4) were infused at rates of 75, 150 and 231 nmol/min for three sequential 36-min phases. In single-pass experiments, (R)-propranolol (n = 4) or (S)-propranolol (n = 4) were administered at rates of 80, 136 and 239 nmol/min for three sequential 30-min phases. Steady-state bioavailability increased 10-20-fold over this dose range with both enantiomers in both recirculating and single-pass experiments. At the higher administration rates of (S)-propranolol, bioavailability in recirculating experiments was significantly greater than that in single-pass experiments, whereas there was no significant difference for (R)-propranolol. This suggests product inhibition of (S)- but not (R)-propranolol metabolism. 3. Of the metabolites examined, racemic 4'-hydroxypropranolol (4-OHP) inhibited the formation of 4-OHP, 5'-hydroxypropranolol (5-OHP) and desisopropylpropranolol (DIP) from (S)-propranolol and (R)-propranolol in microsomal studies (IC50 20 microM). Tissue levels of (S)-4-OHP in recirculating experiments (28.0 microM) at the highest dose (239 nmol/ min) of (S)-propranolol were greater than its IC50 of 20 microM, suggesting that 4-OHP is the inhibiting metabolite in the intact liver. The absence of evidence for product inhibition with (R)-propranolol in perfused livers suggests that (S)-4-OHP inhibits 4-hydroxylation of each isomer but (R)-4-OHP does not. 4. We conclude that in the recirculating IPRL, product inhibition of propranolol metabolism is evident with the (S)-isomer, but not he (R)-isomer, and that the inhibiting metabolite is (S)-4-OHP.",

A single-dose three-way crossover bioavailability study of two extended-release experimental formulations (80 mg), Inderal LA (80 mg) and an Inderal immediate-release dosage form (2 x 40 mg) was also conducted and a comparative analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters and the in-vitro release profiles was performed to assess in-vitro/in-vivo correlation. Analysis showed that the in-vitro release data appeared to follow zero-order release kinetics. Intensity of agitation and dissolution method were found to have no significant effect on drug release from beads prepared using either of the coating dispersions studied or Inderal LA. Release of drug from beads coated with Aquacoat was faster in basic media than in acidic media; Surelease-coated beads, however, showed release characteristics that were less sensitive to changes in the pH of the dissolution fluid, and Inderal LA beads showed slower release profiles in acidic medium than in other dissolution media studied. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data revealed sustained-release absorption characteristics without any evidence of dose-dumping from any of the extended-release dosage forms studied. Regression analysis of the fraction of drug absorbed against the percentage of the drug released in-vitro, at the corresponding times, yielded good in-vitro/in-vivo correlation (level A) for all the extended-release formulations studied. The results showed that there was no dose-dumping from any of extended-release formulations and that the relative bioavailabilities of the experimental formulations were superior to that of the marketed formulation.", 
    "124": "The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of alpha(1)- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, alone and in combination, on potassium uptake in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes from adult rat heart, using the potassium analogue 86Rb+. The reliability of 86Rb+ as a potassium analogue was also investigated. Alpha(1)-, beta-, And combined adrenoceptor stimulation was achieved by using noradrenaline in the presence and absence of appropriate adrenoceptor antagonists. The uptake of 86Rb+ was found to increase linearly with time up to 20 min., both during basal and receptor-stimulated conditions. The basal uptake rate was about 0.18 ml/g protein x min. At 15 min. both alpha(1)-, beta- and combined adrenoceptor stimulation dose-dependently increased the 86Rb(+)-uptake with a -logEC50 of 7.05, 6.68 and 6.73, respectively. The maximal increase in these series achieved by 5 x 10(-5) mol/l noradrenaline was 29%, 24% and 41% above basal level, respectively. Comparison of the maximal effects in the same cell preparations, with the observed value for combined adrenoceptor stimulation in each experiment as 100%, gave a relative maximal increase in 86Rb(+)-uptake after separate alpha(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation of 67 +/- 8%, and of 68 +/- 6% after separate beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The theoretically calculated value for combined adrenoceptor stimulation, if additivity, was 135 +/- 11%, which was significantly higher than the observed value (100%) (P = 0.026). The effect of noradrenaline was not limited by the maximal 86Rb(+)-uptake capacity, as 10(-5) mol/l forskolin increased the 86Rb(+)-uptake more than noradrenaline. Examining the reliability of 86Rb+ as potassium-analogue by combining 42K+ and 86Rb+ in the same experiments, showed that combined adrenoceptor stimulation dose-dependently increased both the 42K(+)- and 86Rb(+)-uptake with the same potency and to the same extent. Thus 86Rb+ is a reliable potassium-analogue for these effects. In conclusion both alpha(1)- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation dose-dependently increased the cellular 86Rb(+)-uptake to the same extent and with the same potency. The observed maximal 86Rb(+)-uptake after combined adrenoceptor stimulation was significantly higher than the maximal effect after either form of separate receptor stimulation, but significantly lower than expected if the effects were purely additive. The results thus show inhibitory interaction between the two receptor systems.", 
    "125": "The cardiovascular responses to various inodilatory interventions were investigated noninvasively in healthy man by monitoring heart rate (HR), blood pressure (SBP/DBP, according to Korotkoff I and IV criteria), systolic time intervals (PEP, VET and QS2) and impedance cardiographic estimates of stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO). The following inodilatory interventions were evaluated and compared: the i.v. infusion of adrenaline (1 microgram/min), the i.v. infusion of isoprenaline (1 microgram/min) with and without pretreatment with 100 mg talinolol (a beta 1-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), the p.o. administration of 1200 mg celiprolol (a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with ancillary beta-adrenergic agonistic properties at the chosen dose level), the p.o. administration of 0.4 mg bimakalim (a K+ channel activator without direct cardiac effect) with and without pretreatment with 5 mg bisoprolol and the p.o. administration of the PDE-III inhibitors meribendan and isomazole. The extent of the inodilatory rise of HR, shortening of PEP, rise of SV and CO relative to the associated reduction of the calculated total peripheral resistance (TPR) proved a powerful tool to differentiate inodilatory properties: adrenaline, isoprenaline after beta 1-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade and celiprolol led to similar ancillary adrenaline-like cardiovascular changes relative to the vasodilatation; bimakalim led to similar associated changes except for a relatively larger rise in HR, which could be blocked by bisoprolol; isoprenaline induced clearly larger associated changes, for which HR, VET, and QS2c were particularly sensitive; meribendan and isomazole resulted in the largest ancillary changes, characterized by a critical shortening of the ejection time VET, so that the rise of CO was almost exclusively defined by the rise of HR. These differences could be detected and differentiated sufficiently and adequately by HR, SV, CO, TPR, PEP, and VET. There seems little value in using more assumptive variables such as HR-corrected VETc and QS2c, the Weissler index and the impedance cardiographic Heather index.", 
    "126": "A new specific HPLC-TSP-MS/MS assay for identification of beta-blocking drug talinolol and its metabolites in urinary samples of man, dog, rat and mouse after single oral administration has been developed. Centrifuged urines were directly injected into the HPLC-TSP-MS system. Based on thermospray MS/MS studies of 10 reference compounds, several selective CID-MS/MS reactions were found, which were typical of substructure elements of potential phase I metabolites. In this way the differentiation of various stereochemical positions of the hydroxyl group in the cyclohexyl ring moiety of metabolites was possible. Renal metabolic profiles for all investigated species were generated by HPLC-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The detected metabolites were characterized by TSP full scan and MS/MS analysis in relation to synthesized reference compounds. The major metabolic pathway in all species results in the hydroxylation of the cyclohexylring moiety of talinolol. In dog urine, a phase II metabolite, the O-glucuronide of talinolol (I) was found. In order to identify this structure, the use of electrospray ionization was also necessary.", 
    "127": "Chronic beta-receptor blockade (beta-blockade) has been reported to improve symptoms and increase survival in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF); however, whether the mechanisms for the effects of beta-blockade in CHF are due to modulating chronotropy, inotropy, or both remains unknown. To address this issue, left ventricular function and isolated myocyte function were examined with chronic beta-blockade in a rapid pacing model of CHF, thereby eliminating potential chronotropic effects of beta-blockade.", 
    "128": "Pigs were randomly assigned to three groups of six pigs each: supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): 3 weeks of atrial pacing at 240 beats/min; SVT/beta-blockade: 3 weeks of rapid pacing and beta-blockade (25 mg atenolol twice daily on days 14-21 of pacing); control group, sham control animals. This dosage schedule for beta-blockade was chosen because catecholamines are persistently elevated by day 14 in this model of CHF. Left ventricular fractional shortening and end-diastolic dimension were measured by echocardiography in the conscious state with a resting ambient heart rate. Isolated left ventricular myocyte function was examined using high-speed videomicroscopy. Supraventricular tachycardia caused left ventricular dilation (5.4 +/- 0.1 vs 3.5 +/- 0.1 cm) and reduced fractional shortening (12 +/- 1% vs 35 +/- 1%) compared with control animals (P < .05). The SVT/beta-blockade group showed no significant effects on left ventricular size or function compared with the SVT group, but their ambient resting heart rate was reduced by 20% relative to the SVT group (P < .05). Myocyte shortening was reduced in the SVT group (2.2 +/- 0.1% vs 4.5 +/- 0.1%, P < .05) compared with the control group and increased from SVT-only values with beta-blockade (2.7 +/- 0.1%, P < .05). Similarly, myocyte shortening velocity was similarly reduced in the SVT and SVT/beta-blockade groups (31 +/- 1 and 32 +/- 1 microns/s) compared with the control group (51 +/- 1 microns/s, P < .05). With SVT/beta-blockade myocyte contraction duration was prolonged (525 +/- 5 ms) compared with SVT-only or control values (469 +/- 9 and 473 +/- 4 ms, P < .05). Thus, institution of beta-1-selective blockade during the development of SVT-induced CHF altered the temporal characteristics of the myocyte contraction process, which resulted in improved myocyte shortening.", 
    "129": "In a model of CHF due to the maintenance of a chronically elevated heart rate, institution of beta-1-selective blockade during the progression of the CHF process minimally affected left ventricular size and function. At the level of the myocyte, chronic beta-1-receptor blockade prolonged the contraction interval and thereby increased myocyte shortening. These unique results suggest that a contributory mechanism for the effects of beta-blockade in the setting of CHF is chronotropic modulation.",

Dose-response curves plotted as percentage change from baseline versus concentration of drug were determined for acetylstrophanthidin, isoproterenol, isobutylmethylxanthine, and milrinone. Acetylstrophanthidin, a cyclic AMP-independent agent, showed similar increases in peak tension relative to baseline over the entire dose range tested for both control and myopathic heart muscle; its effect on relaxation of control and failing cardiac muscle was equivalent over the dose range tested. In contrast, the inotropic actions of the cyclic AMP-dependent agents, isoproterenol and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, were significantly decreased in myopathic muscle compared with control muscle, but effects on relaxation in the control and myopathic groups remained relatively preserved.",

When the atrial rate was increased to approximately double by treatment with isoproterenol (1 x 10(-8) mol/l) or forskolin (1 x 10(-6) mol/l), phenylephrine at the same doses significantly reduced the rate by about 6%. This effect was blocked by phentolamine (1 x 10(-6) mol/l).

After a single-blind placebo run-in period lasting 4-6 weeks, the patients were treated either with bunazosin retard or with atenolol for a further 16 weeks including an initial dose titration period to achieve blood pressure control. Treatment involved 3, 6 or 12 mg bunazosin retard tablets or 25, 50 or 100 mg atenolol tablets, administered orally once a day and prescribed according to blood pressure response. The euglycaemic hyper-insulinaemic clamp technique was used to assess insulin sensitivity both after the placebo period and after the active treatment. A total of 95 patients was enrolled in the study (placebo phase). Forty-eight patients were withdrawn from the placebo phase, mainly due to their blood pressures being outside the required range (seated diastolic blood pressure 90-114 mmHg) and 47 patients were allocated randomly to active treatment. Of these, 23 were administered bunazosin retard and 24 atenolol. All evaluations were on an intention-to-treat basis.",

The insulin level attained during clamps (infusion rate 56 mU/m2 per min) was higher (P < 0.05) following atenolol (117 +/- 5 mU/l) than it was following bunazosin retard administration (102 +/- 5) or placebo (108 +/- 3), possibly due to an impaired insulin clearance. Compared with placebo, atenolol treatment resulted in significantly increased glucosylated haemoglobin whereas bunazosin retard had no significant effect. The two drugs did not show any consistent differences in lipid profile or fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 levels. During the study seven serious adverse events were reported and one was reported shortly after completion of the study. All except one were classified as not related to the study drug and five of them occurred during placebo treatment.

TCV-116 at 1 mg/kg lowered the blood pressure by about 50 and 30 mmHg, 5 and 24 h after dosing, respectively. The blood pressure was slightly lowered by HCTZ at 10 mg/kg, but it was synergistically reduced when HCTZ was given in combination with TCV-116. Manidipine at 3 mg/kg lowered the blood pressure by about 50 mmHg 1 h after administration. When manidipine was given in combination with TCV-116, blood pressure was reduced additively. Prazosin at 1 mg/kg lowered the blood pressure by 40 to 50 mmHg 1 h after dosing. When prazosin was given in combination with TCV-116, the reduction was intensified more than additively, to about 100 mmHg. Atenolol at 50 mg/kg lowered the blood pressure by 10 to 20 mmHg 5 h after dosing. Even when atenolol was administered in combination with TCV-116, the reduction in blood pressure was virtually the same as that observed when TCV-116 was given alone. TCV-116 and HCTZ had no effect on the pulse rate, whereas manidipine and prazosin both increased it, owing to reflex tachycardia, and atenolol decreased it. TCV-116 had no effect on the change in the pulse rate induced by these antihypertensive drugs and no effect on HCTZ-induced diuresis. TCV-116 and HCTZ each caused a significant increase in plasma renin concentration (PRC), and prazosin caused a slight elevation. Manidipine had no effect on the PRC, whereas atenolol reduced it. Given in combination with TCV-116, these antihypertensive drugs had the same effect on the elevated PRC induced by TCV-116 as they did on the basal PRC when administered alone. These results suggest that antihypertensive drugs that cause compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin system have more marked antihypertensive activity when given in combination with TCV-116, but that there will is no combined effect on the pulse rate.", 
    "146": "Many factors have been reported to stimulate the release of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as well as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In hypertensive patients, however, little is known about whether these factors differ from those in normotensive subjects or if they are influenced by antihypertensive treatment. We measured the plasma concentrations of BNP and ANP in 12 hypertensive patients and examined the chronic effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on BNP secretion during exercise with a bicycle ergometer. The exercise raised both plasma BNP and ANP with concomitant increases in systolic blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) before and after treatment. Before treatment, the changes in ANP and BNP correlated with that in HR (p < 0.05). After treatment 4 wk of treatment, the change in ANP correlated with those in NE and Epi as well as HR. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that only NE was a significant stimulus for ANP secretion during the treatment period. As for BNP, HR was the only significant stimulant for its secretion both before and after treatment. In essential hypertension, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade affected the factors stimulating exercise-induced ANP release but not those stimulating BNP release. BNP release, therefore, seems to be stimulated by similar but distinct factors from those that stimulate ANP release.", 
    "147": "1. Monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were recorded from early postnatal and juvenile dentate granule cells in rat brain slices at room temperature. The focally evoked currents were mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors. 2. IPSCs were characterized by a steep rising phase and a slower, monoexponential decay time course. The decay time constant was potential dependent and average values ranged from 33 ms at a holding potential of -60 mV to 58 ms at a holding potential of +40 mV. 3. IPSCs were studied in tissue from animals between postnatal day (p) 3 and p25. All kinetic parameters as well as the mean current amplitude were unchanged during this ontogenetic period. 4. In juvenile granule cells from animals aged 13-16 days, addition of the GABA uptake blocker (R)-N-[4,4-bis (3-methyl-2-thienyl) but-3-en1-yl] nipecotic acid (tiagabine) (10 microM) prolonged the decaying phase of the IPSCs. The current decay remained monoexponential but the time constant increased to 250% of control values. Mean current amplitudes remained largely unchanged. 5. In contrast, tiagabine had no effect on IPSCs in early postnatal tissu\u0115. The decay time constant remained unchanged in cells recorded from animals aged p4-p6. Other uptake blockers were also ineffective during the first postnatal week, whereas beta-alanine, NNC-711, and L-2,3-diaminoproprionic acid enhanced the decay time constant in the older tissue (p13-p16). 6. Hypoosmolaric extracellular solution was applied to restrict the extracellular space. In juvenile tissue (p13-p16), IPSCs were not affected by this treatment, whereas early postnatal granule cells (p4-p6) displayed clearly prolonged IPSC decay time constants (165% of control). 7. We conclude that the mechanism governing the kinetics of evoked IPSCs in granule cells changes during ontogenesis. Whereas in early postnatal tissue the transmitter leaves the postsynaptic site by diffusion, GABA uptake becomes time limiting after 2 wk of postnatal development.", 
    "148": "No definitive data are available about the possibility of predicting improvement in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope treated with beta blockers. Among 112 patients with syncope and a positive head-up tilt test (HUT), independent predictors for prevention of symptoms with beta blockers were determined using the Cox proportional hazards model. Each patient underwent HUT at 70 degrees for 20 minutes both in the drug-free state and during isoproterenol infusion given to increase the heart rate by at least 25%. Fifty-nine patients had a positive HUT during isoproterenol infusion and 53 in the drug-free state. All patients were then given esmolol infusion at 500 micrograms/kg per minute for 3 minutes followed by 300 micrograms/kg per minute maintenance dose. HUT was then repeated as previously described with or without isoproterenol, depending upon the initial positive response. Regardless of the response during esmolol, all patients were treated with metoprolol 50 to 100 mg twice daily. At follow-up, 36 patients experienced symptom relapse. Four of them had negative HUT on esmolol, whereas the remaining 32 did not respond to the acute infusion of esmolol. Only four patients with positive HUT on esmolol had a favorable response to metoprolol. Patients responding to metoprolol were older (55 +/- 12 years vs 42 +/- 15 years, P < 0.05). Response to metoprolol was predicted by a negative test on esmolol (P < 0.0001) and a positive HUT on isoproterenol (P < 0.001). Age older than 42 years was also associated with a higher likelihood of metoprolol success (P < 0.02).",

    "150": "In a previous study we demonstrated a superfusion technique which allows for investigation of nerve-immune cell interaction in murine spleen. We demonstrated that under septic-like conditions in the presence of bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), electrically induced inhibition of interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion was attenuated by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. This effect was now investigated more closely under various endotoxin conditions in order to dissect effects of bacteria and endotoxin: (A) bacteria-rich conditions (without penicillin/streptomycin [P/S] and without LPS), (B) LPS-enriched conditions (with P/S and with LPS), and (C) bacteria-free conditions (with P/S and without LPS). Under bacteria-rich conditions, norepinephrine (Emax = 10(-6) M, p = 0.012) and isoproterenol (Emax = 10(-6) M, p = 0.048) concentration-dependently inhibited IL-6 secretion from murine spleen slices in contrast to bacteria-free conditions. In a bacteria-free environment the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol did not attenuate the electrically induced inhibition of splenic IL-6 secretion. The insertion of bacterial filters in front of the superfusion chambers to avoid direct contact between bacteria and cells increased the electrically-induced inhibition of IL-6 secretion (p = 0.0036). Added LPS did not change the electrically-induced release of norepinephrine from presynaptic nerve terminals in murine spleen. The study demonstrates two different beta-adrenergic effects on IL-6 secretion of murine spleen slices under bacteria-rich or bacteria-free conditions.", 
    "151": "Contraction of airways of different size can be studied in viable lung slices by videomicroscopy. However, at present, application of this technique is limited by the heterogeneous responses obtained. We investigated the use of precision-cut lung slices to examine contraction of individual airways. Lung slices of 250 +/- 20 microns were prepared from Wistar rats and cultured in a roller incubator in serum-free minimum essential medium (MEM). Under these conditions, the slices were viable for at least 70 h, as indicated by leakage of lactate dehydrogenase into the supernatant, thymidine incorporation and ciliary beating. The slices were placed in a newly developed incubation chamber and mounted by a nylon thread that was fixed to a platinum wire. The whole chamber was positioned on a microscope stage, and contraction of single airways was followed under a microscope that was coupled to a CCD-camera. Reduction in airway area was taken as an index of bronchoconstriction and was determined by a computer program. Addition of methacholine resulted in a concentration-dependent (concentration producing half the maximal effect (EC50) = 0.64 +/- 0.08 (mean +/- SD) microM; n = 64) contraction of single airways. In the presence of hydrocortisone, the EC50 was about six times greater, i.e. 3.7 +/- 0.9 microM (n = 7), and the effect of the steroid was largely abolished by propanolol (EC50 = 1.1 +/- 0.1 microM; n = 7). Airways with an area smaller than 35,000 microns2 were nearly nine times more sensitive to methacholine (EC50 = 0.1 +/- 0.03 microM; n = 20) than larger ones (EC50 = 87 +/- 0.27 microM; n = 22). We conclude that cultured precision-cut lung slices are a useful model for routine study of contraction of individual airways of various sizes. The measurements were precise and reproducible and showed that smaller airways are more sensitive to methacholine than larger ones.", 
    "152": "The signal transduction pathways that are activated by cytokines and growth factors binding to their receptors on human neutrophils (PMN) are poorly understood. When PMN in suspension encounter many of these agonists they are not activated, but rather are primed for subsequent activation. We and others reported that when PMN are plated onto fibrinogen and stimulated with cytokines or with the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) they respond by releasing hydrogen peroxide (H202) and the specific granule component lactoferrin. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is released by many cells including PMN. It has been reported that TGF-beta1 stimulates chemotaxis but not exocytosis or superoxide production by cells in suspension. We hypothesized that TGF-beta1 would activate PMN to release H202 when they were adherent to fibrinogen, a response mediated by beta2++integrin receptors. In this study, we determined whether TGF-beta1 stimulated H202 and lactoferrin release by PMN adherent to fibrinogen. TGF-beta1 stimulated H202 and lactoferrin release from adherent PMN in a concentration-dependent manner, with effects seen in the range of 0.1 to 100 pg/mL. Both H202 and lactoferrin release were detected by 60 min and continued for at least 180 min. Adhesion and spreading of PMN paralleled H202 and lactoferrin release. Ethanol (200 mM) blocked both H202 and lactoferrin release, suggesting the involvement of the phospholipase D pathway. In PMN labeled with lyso-[3H]phosphatidylcholine, we observed that TGF-beta1 treatment caused an increase in [3H]phosphatidate. Propranolol (150 microM), an inhibitor of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, blocked both H202 and lactoferrin release, suggesting that the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diradylglycerol is an important step in PMN activation by TGF-beta1. Overall, these results are similar to those reported for fMLP activation of adherent PMN and suggest that a common pathway is involved in both chemoattractant and cytokine activation.", 
    "153": "The aim was to evaluate the effects of a change of treatment from beta-blocker to captopril on the quality of life of hypertensive patients. One hundred forty-nine mild to moderate hypertensive patients who were being treated with beta-blockers were randomly assigned to receive captopril (12.5 to 50 mg twice daily), or to continue on beta-blocker treatment (atenolol: 25 to 100 mg once daily [n = 121], or propranolol, 10 to 80 mg twice daily [n = 12]). When required, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide was added in each group. The patients were followed over periods ranging from 6 to 12 months. Blood pressure, treatment side effects, and quality of life were monitored. Blood pressure was equally well managed in both groups, though a lower level of treatment was required in the captopril group. The captopril treated patients exhibited favorable changes in several aspects of quality of life: sleep-related, gastrointestinal, and physical activity-related symptoms improved from baseline to end of follow-up. Drowsiness and the ability to concentrate significantly improved in the captopril group only (P <.01). Change in treatment from beta-blocker to captopril resulted in equally well controlled blood pressure on a lower drug dose. Moreover, the change to captopril had a positive impact on the quality of life.", 
    "154": "Increased adrenergic activity has been suggested to mediate the hypertension associated with hyperinsulinemia. This study tested whether combined alpha1- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade would prevent insulin-induced hypertension when euglycemia was maintained by continuous intravenous glucose infusion. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 16) were instrumented with artery and vein catheters and placed in metabolic cages. Propranolol and prazosin (10 mg/kg/day each) were infused continuously intravenously in 9 rats and 7 other rats received vehicle. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured 24 h per day using computerized methods. After a control period, a 7-day intravenous infusion of insulin (1.5 microU/kg/min) was begun and glucose was coadministered intravenously at 23 mg/kg/min to prevent hypoglycemia. The MAP averaged 93 +/- 1 mm Hg in the blockade rats during the control period, which was significantly lower than the 98 +/- 1 mm Hg in the normal rats. During insulin infusion, MAP increased similarly in both groups, with a 10 +/- 2 mm Hg and 11 +/- 1 mm Hg increase in normal and blockade rats, respectively, by day 7. The HR also increased in both groups: from 417 +/- 8 beats/ min to 426 +/- 13 beats/min (P = NS) in normal rats and from 379 +/- 10 beats/min to 419 +/- 10 beats/min (P < .05) in blockade rats. Control sodium excretion averaged 2.5 +/- 0.1 mEq/day in both groups and no significant change in sodium balance was measured in either group. All variables returned toward control after stopping insulin. These results suggest that increased adrenergic activity is not required for chronic hyperinsulinemia to raise blood pressure in rats."
