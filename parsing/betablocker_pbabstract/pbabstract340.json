The effects of beta-blockers are to: (i) reduce complex ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia; (ii) increase the ventricular fibrillation threshold; (iii) reduce myocardial ischaemia; (iv) decrease sympathetic tone; (v) markedly attenuate the circadian variation of complex ventricular arrhythmias: (vi) abolish the circadian variation of myocardial ischaemia; and (vii) abolish the circadian variation of sudden cardiac death or MI. beta-Blockers reduce mortality in patients with MI and complex ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, they are excellent antianginal agents. Older persons with hypertension who have had an MI should be treated initially with a beta-blocker. beta-Blockers reduce mortality in patients with: (i) diabetes mellitus who have had an MI; (ii) MI and congestive heart failure with an abnormal or normal left ventricular ejection fraction; and (iii) MI and an asymptomatic abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction. Severe congestive heart failure, severe peripheral arterial disease with threatening gangrene, greater than first degree atrioventricular block, hypotension, bradycardia, lung disease with bronchospasm, and bronchial asthma are contraindications to treatment with beta-blockers.",

This article describes the case of a patient affected by pheochromocytoma in whom multiple organ failure developed after contemporary administration of ergotamine, caffeine, and nimesulide. The patient recovered completely long after surgical intervention.", 
    "2": "Beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs ameliorate the progression of disease that usually characterizes heart failure. All of the larger multicenter studies have demonstrated reductions in morbidity, manifested by a reduction in the number of hospitalizations and/or listing for cardiac transplantation, whereas studies with carvedilol have also reported a significant reduction in mortality. The influence of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs on the symptomatic and functional status of patients with heart failure has been more difficult to establish. Almost all trials have reported an improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, with few patients experiencing functional deterioration. Improvement in symptom score was reported in the Metoprolol in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (MDC) trial far patients treated with metoprolol. In patients from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program who had heart failure from ischemic and nonischemic etiologies, both patients and physicians reported more improvement and less deterioration in an assessment of global status. More formal instruments to assess quality of life, such as the specific activity scale in the Australia-New Zealand trial of carvedilol (that recruited 30% of patients who bad improved to NYHA stage I) and the Minnesota Quality of Life questionnaire, did not seem sensitive to the clinical benefits observed in these trials. Serial exercise testing similarly does not seem sensitive to the beneficial influence of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs on disease progression, at least in relatively short-term studies.", 
    "3": "Observations from experimental studies and controlled clinical trials indicate that prolonged activation of the sympathetic nervous system can accelerate the progression of heart failure, and that the risks of such progression can be substantially decreased through the use of pharmacologic agents that interfere with the actions of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart and peripheral blond vessels. Early studies with beta(1)-selective agents such as metoprolol and bisoprolol suggested that treatment with beta blockers could decrease the risk of worsening heart failure, but showed little or equivocal effects on survival. Recent studies using a more complex nonselective beta blocker (e.g., carvedilol) have reported a reduction in mortality as well as in the combined risk of death and hospitalization. This ability to decrease the risk of disease progression led to the recent approval of carvedilol for the treatment of chronic heart failure by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, it is not clear whether these survival effects represent a class effect of beta blockers or a specific effect of carvedilol. Carvedilol antagonizes several biologic mechanisms not blocked by metoprolol or bisoprolol that are thought to mediate the progression of heart failure. In addition, in 3 meta-analyses, the survival effects of nonselective vasodilating beta blockers appeared to be greater than those of beta(1)-selective nonvasodilating beta blockers. Moreover, it is unknown whether survival benefits can be expected only in the patients who were enrolled in the clinical trials (i.e., New York Heart Association class II or III patients) or whether they can also he achieved in patients with less severe or more severe symptoms (class I or IV heart failure). These questions are being addressed in several ongoing large-scale, long-term survival trials that are scheduled for completion within the next 5 years.", 
    "4": "Antiadrenergic treatment is currently an emerging and very promising approach to the treatment of chronic heart failure. Although the adrenergic nervous system can be pharmacologically inhibited at multiple levels, it is the use of receptor-blocking agents that has generated the most interest and provided the most data for the \"proof of concept\" of this approach. In part because antiadrenergic treatment of chronic heart failure has developed in an atmosphere in which it was initially considered to be contraindicated (i.e., before Phase III clinical trials could be initiated), a large body of hypothesis-driven basic and clinical investigation was required to define the overall rationale and demonstrate feasibility. This article will review these data and propose a single primary mechanism of action to explain most of the clinical benefits of these agents.", 
    "5": "Pheochromocytomas are functionally active, catecholamine-secreting tumours of chromaffin tissue. The mainstay of pharmacological therapy is preoperative treatment with oral phenoxybenzamine. This drug irreversibly alkylates alpha-1-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle and renders them nonfunctional, thereby causing vasodilatation. The duration of action of a single dose is approximately 24 h. Therefore, postoperative hypotension is a hazard of therapy with phenoxybenzamine if adequate plasma volume repletion is not provided. Prazosin, a short-acting, competitive alpha-1 blocker, has been used preoperatively, but has been criticized for its failure to adequately prevent perioperative hypertensive episodes. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman who was admitted for elective pheochromocytoma resection. Preoperative therapy with phenoxybenzamine was impossible because of the patient's refusal to take the drug. Preoperative antihypertensive preparation was therefore performed with prazosin 30 mg/24 h and metoprolol 100 mg/24 h. During the surgical preparation of the tumor, sodium nitroprusside was started at an average infusion rate of 4.1 micrograms/kg/min. After resection of the primary tumor, when the sodium nitroprusside infusion was stopped the patient exhibited an increase in systolic blood pressure (BP) up to 210 mg Hg. This hypertensive crisis was managed with sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, and esmolol. A multilocular pheochromocytoma was diagnosed. Further stimuli due to tumour palpation resulted in repeated increases in BP. In this manner, two additional areas of tumour could be diagnosed by BP peaks after reduction of the sodium nitroprusside infusion. After complete resection of a total of three tumours, no further hypertensive crises occurred. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. We conclude that in this patient presenting with an unsuspected multilocular pheochromocytoma, the lack of permanent alpha-blockade was probably helpful in allowing complete resection of all the tumours.", 
    "6": "The efficacy and safety of daily 20 mg betaxolol monotherapy was investigated in mild-moderate essential hypertension in a four week long, open label, single blind trial (with a placebo run-in). Twenty one patients of both sexes were enrolled. The systolic blood pressure in the supine position decreased from 158 to 142 mmHg, the diastolic blood pressure from 101 to 89 mmHg. The mean systolic values of the 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring decreased from 136 to 126 mmHg, the mean diastolic values from 87 to 80 mmHg. All decreases in blood pressure were significant. The reduction of the heart rate (80/min vs 63/min) was also significant. The decrease in blood pressure during daytime was significant, during night it was moderate. The blood pressure- and heart rate reducing effect of betaxolol was detectable however in the second half of the night, before wake-up. No side effect was recorded.", 
    "7": "Patients who survive life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias are at risk for recurrent arrhythmias. They can be treated with either an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or antiarrhythmic drugs, but the relative efficacy of these two treatment strategies is unknown.", 
    "8": "To address this issue, we conducted a randomized comparison of these two treatment strategies in patients who had been resuscitated from near-fatal ventricular fibrillation or who had undergone cardioversion from sustained ventricular tachycardia. Patients with ventricular tachycardia also had either syncope or other serious cardiac symptoms, along with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.40 or less. One group of patients was treated with implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator; the other received class III antiarrhythmic drugs, primarily amiodarone at empirically determined doses. Fifty-six clinical centers screened all patients who presented with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation during a period of nearly four years. Of 1016 patients (45 percent of whom had ventricular fibrillation, and 55 percent ventricular tachycardia), 507 were randomly assigned to treatment with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and 509 to antiarrhythmic-drug therapy. The primary end point was overall mortality.",

    "11": "Activity of voltage-gated K+ channels (KV) in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC) is pivotal in controlling membrane potential, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt, and pulmonary vasomotor tone. Acute hypoxia selectively inhibits KV channels, depolarizes PASMC, raises [Ca2+]cyt, and causes pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling. Prolonged hypoxia (24-60 h) decreased significantly the mRNA levels of KV channel alpha subunits, KV1.2 and KV1.5. Consistently, the protein levels of KV1.2 and KV1.5 were also decreased significantly by hypoxia (48-72 h). Nevertheless, hypoxia affected negligibly the mRNA levels of KV channel beta subunits (KVbeta1, KVbeta2, and KVbeta3). The native K+ channels are composed of pore-forming alpha and auxiliary beta subunits. Assembly of KV beta subunits with alpha subunits confers rapid inactivation on the slowly or non-inactivating delayed rectifier KV channels. KV beta subunits also function as an open-channel blocker of KV channels. Thus, the diminished transcription and expression of KV alpha subunits may reduce the number of KV channels and decrease KC currents. Unchanged transcription of KV beta subunits may increase the fraction of the KV channel alpha subunits that are associated with beta subunits and further reduce the total KV currents. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which chronic hypoxia may cause pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypertension.",

    "13": "Fas ligand is a potent inducer of apoptosis in human glioma cells by the Fas/Fas ligand pathway. With comparable efficiency, metalloprotease inhibitors including puromycin and bestatin induce apoptosis in glioma cells. To evaluate the involvement of potential components involved in Fas ligand- and metalloprotease inhibitor-induced apoptosis, we investigated the effect of anti human Fas antibody, soluble Fas ligand and puromycin on cultures of human malignant glioma cell lines (LN-18, LN-229, T98G). Stimulation with Fas ligand lead to apoptotic cell death within 16 h. Costimulation with the translational inhibitor cycloheximide and the transcription blocker actinomycin D did not reduce Fas ligand toxicity. In contrast, apoptosis induced by puromycin was blocked by cycloheximide and decreased by subtoxic doses of actinomycin D in all three gliomas. Whereas inhibition of caspase activity with the general inhibitor zVAD-fmk resulted in a complete block of Fas ligand-induced cell death, puromycin-mediated apoptosis was found to be unaffected by zVAD-fmk as well as by more specific inhibitors for caspase-1 (Interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme) and caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama). Other prominent components involved in many apoptotic pathways as bcl-2 and reactive oxygen intermediates were also examined. Bcl-2 which protects glioma cells from Fas ligand-induced cell death, was shown to have only a small protective effect on puromycin-induced apoptosis. The tested radical scavengers did not reduce Fas- or puromycin-mediated killing of human glioma cells.", 
    "14": "A double-blind study was undertaken to investigate the period of treatment with the beta-adrenoreceptor/5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) antagonist pindolol required to enhance the antidepressant effects of paroxetine. After 1 week of a placebo run-in period, 63 untreated major depressive inpatients were randomly assigned to three different groups. Group 1 received paroxetine (20 mg/day) plus placebo (4 weeks). Group 2 received paroxetine (20 mg/day) plus pindolol (7.5 mg/day) for 1 week and placebo for 3 weeks. Group 3 received both active treatments for the entire duration of the study (4 weeks). Clinical response was defined as a reduction of the score in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) to 8 or below. Also, to preliminarily examine whether beta-adrenoreceptor blockade was involved in the action of pindolol, another group of 10 inpatients was treated in an open-label manner with paroxetine (20 mg/day) plus 50 mg/day of the beta-adrenergic antagonist metoprolol, devoid of significant affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. At endpoint, the incidence of treatment-emergent side effects did not significantly differ among the three groups. After 1 and 2 weeks of treatment, the two groups treated with paroxetine plus pindolol displayed a significantly greater response rate than the group treated with paroxetine plus placebo. At study completion, only the patients treated with pindolol for the entire period showed a significantly greater response rate (p = 0.05). HAM-D score were also significantly lower at endpoint in patients treated with the combination for 4 weeks (p = 0.00003). The group of patients treated with paroxetine and metoprolol exhibited a side-effect profile comparable to that of paroxetine alone. Response rates were also comparable. These findings support the efficacy of pindolol, but not of metoprolol, in accelerating the antidepressant effect of paroxetine and suggest that the administration of pindolol for the entire period of the acute treatment may increase the efficacy of paroxetine.", 
    "15": "Studies in animals and humans have demonstrated that an increased heart rate is a predictor for the development of coronary atherosclerosis and overall cardiovascular mortality. In contrast, we have previously reported that the need for pacemaker implantation because of bradycardia in heart transplant recipients is associated with an increased prevalence of transplant coronary artery disease (TxCAD). Hence, the relevance of changes in heart rate to the development of TxCAD remains unclear. Intra-coronary ultrasound examinations (ICUS) were therefore analyzed in 130 heart transplant recipients (age 50 +/- 11 yr) studied at annual evaluations (3.7 +/- 3.0 yr after transplantation). Quantitative ultrasound measurements were obtained by calculating mean coronary artery intimal thickness (MIT) obtained by examination of the left anterior descending artery. The presence of TxCAD was defined as MIT > 0.3 mm. Resting heart rates (HR) were recorded with the patients in the supine position during routine echocardiography. Based on HR recordings, two groups were defined: group 1, HR below; or group 2, HR above the median. TxCAD was detected in 40% of the ICUS studies overall. The prevalence of TxCAD was higher in group 1 (49%) compared with group 2 (33%), p < 0.05. There was no significant difference in donor ischemic time or donor gender, recipient age, gender, body weight, CMV status, creatinine, total cholesterol, use of lipid lowering drugs or diltiazem. Donor age and use of beta-blockers were higher in group 1 compared with group 2 (29 +/- 10 vs. 25 +/- 9 yr, and 15% vs. 5%, for donor age and beta-blocker use, respectively). By multivariate regression analysis only donor age and years after transplantation were independently correlated with TxCAD. After excluding patients taking beta-blockers and diltiazem, the prevalence of CAD was still higher in group 1 (50%) vs. group 2 (34%). In conclusion, transplant coronary artery disease is more prevalent in patients with lower, rather than higher, heart rates. The reason for this is unclear, but may reflect impaired blood flow to the sinoatrial node.", 
    "16": "In a consecutive study of 21 renal transplant patients suffering from chronic vascular rejection (CVR) we added the beta-receptor-blocking drug carvedilol to their regular medication. The purpose was to investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between carvedilol and cyclosporine (CsA), since carvedilol will soon be used in clinical trials in renal transplant patients with CVR. On the first day of the study the patients received 6.25 mg of carvedilol added to their daily medication. The dose was increased stepwise to 50 mg while the doses of other beta-blocking drugs were decreased. The goal was to exchange atenolol with carvedilol at a ratio of 2:1 when substituting atenolol with carvedilol. The patients' blood pressure was the final determinant of the dose of carvedilol. The trough levels of CsA were measured on days 1, 14, 30, 90 and 180. It was found that the blood levels of CsA increased when carvedilol was introduced. Thus, the doses of CsA had to be reduced in order to keep the blood levels within the therapeutic range. At 90 d, the daily doses of CsA had been reduced from 3.7 +/- 0.3 to 3.0 +/- 0.2 mg/kg BW (p < 0.001). The present results suggest an interaction between carvedilol and CsA that demands a 20% average reduction of CsA doses to maintain the CsA blood levels within the therapeutic range. However, the interaction shows a great interindividual variation, calling for careful monitoring of the CsA blood levels.",

    "20": "In a previous study, we have shown that extracellular ATP stimulates Ca2+ influx resulting in the release of arachidonic acid (AA) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, we have recently reported that extracellular ATP stimulates phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by phospholipase D (PLD) independently from the activation of protein kinase C in these cells. It is well recognized that phosphatidylcholine is hydrolysed by PLD, generating phosphatidic acid, which can be further degraded by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase to diacylglycerol (DG). In the present study, we investigated the role of PLD activation in the extracellular ATP-induced AA release and PGE2 synthesis in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. Extracellular ATP stimulated AA release dose-dependently in the range between 0.1 and 1 mM. Propranolol, which is known to inhibit phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, significantly inhibited the AA release induced by extracellular ATP in a dose-dependent manner in the range between 100 and 300 microM. 1,6-Bis-(cyclohexyloximinocarbonylamino)-hexane (RHC-80267), a selective inhibitor of DG lipase, significantly suppressed the AA release induced by extracellular ATP. Both the pretreatment of propranolol and RHC-80267 also inhibited the extracellular ATP-induced PGE2 synthesis. These results strongly suggest that the AA release induced by extracellular ATP is mediated at least in part by phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by PLD in osteoblast-like cells.",

    "31": "Metoprolol is a cardioselective beta blocker that has been shown to improve left ventricular function and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) and also to decrease the number of hospitalizations due to CHF. However, the effects of metoprolol on mortality in patients with CHF have yet to be determined. Accordingly, the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) has been designed to investigate the effect of once-daily dosing of metoprolol succinate controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) when added to standard therapy in patients with CHF. A total of 3,200 patients will be recruited for this international, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled survival study. The 2 primary objectives of MERIT-HF are to determine the effect of metoprolol CR/XL on (1) total mortality and (2) the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations (time to first event). Eligible patients are 40-80 years old, with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (< or =0.40) and symptoms of CHF (New York Heart Association functional classes II-IV). After a 2-week placebo run-in period, an optimal allocation procedure will be used to randomize patients in a 1:1 ratio to metoprolol CR/XL or matching placebo. After an initial titration phase starting with 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily (depending on functional class), the target dose will be 200 mg in all patients who tolerate this dose. The mean follow-up is estimated to be 2.4 years. The study data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.

    "32": "With greater understanding of the impact of neuroendocrine stimulation on the adverse outcomes of heart failure, especially lethal arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, focus has returned to the potential benefits of beta-adrenergic blockade. In patients with myocardial infarction and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, particularly those prone to life-threatening arrhythmias, beta-blocker therapy has been associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmias and improved survival. Even in the absence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, beta blockade has improved cardiac function and LV contractility in nonischemic heart failure, leading to a decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure and improved clinical status. Both the Metoprolol in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (MDC) trial and the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS) found beta blockade to be associated with decreased mortality rates in patients with nonischemic heart failure. Of the 3 large randomized mortality trials now under way, the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) is specifically designed to investigate the effects of beta blockade on total mortality when used as an adjunct to ACE inhibition in patients with ischemic or nonischemic heart failure. Unresolved issues to be addressed include whether: (1) beta-blocker therapy in heart failure can improve survival and/or reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death; (2) beta blockade is equally effective in ischemic and nonischemic heart failure; (3) any specific beta blocker may be better tolerated initially and cause fewer adverse effects; and (4) all beta blockers result in improved exercise tolerance and quality of life.", 
    "33": "Despite the well-documented benefits of beta blockade in a variety of cardiovascular conditions, the value of beta blockade in congestive heart failure (CHF) is still in question. The concept of neurohormonal blockade in heart failure has, however, brought beta blockade into focus. There is experimental evidence for the value of blocking sympathetic activation in CHF, and increased sympathetic activation may be an etiologic factor for development of CHF. Clinical studies have shown that long-term beta blockade improves both systolic and diastolic function. The effects on exercise tolerance and quality of life seem to differ between beta1-selective and nonselective beta blockers in favor of the beta1-selective blockers. To date, results of all trials reveal a consistent pattern of decreased cardiovascular morbidity. In one trial of metoprolol, fewer heart transplantations were required; such a reduction may have a great impact on healthcare costs associated with heart failure. Improved long-term survival found by one study must be confirmed in additional trials: 3 such survival trials (with metoprolol, bisoprolol, and bucindolol) are now in progress.", 
    "34": "The aim of this study is to describe the impact of early treatment with metoprolol on prognosis during 1 year of follow-up in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and indirect signs of congestive heart failure (CHF). Patients aged 40-74 years who presented within 48 hours of onset of symptoms raising suspicion of AMI were assessed for inclusion. All patients participated in the G\u00f6teborg Metoprolol Trial and had indirect indices of CHF according to various clinical criteria. As soon as possible after hospital admission, patients received either placebo or metoprolol (15 mg) divided into 3 intravenous injections, then oral treatment, 200 mg daily for 3 months. Thereafter, most patients in both treatment groups received metoprolol in an open manner. Among the 1,395 randomized patients, 262 (19%) had signs of mild-to-moderate CHF before randomization. Of these, 131 were randomized to metoprolol and 131 to placebo. During the first 3 months, mortality was 10% among patients randomized to metoprolol versus 19% among patients randomized to placebo (p = 0.036). The corresponding figures for the first year were 14% and 27%, respectively (p = 0.0099). Patients randomized to placebo who showed signs of CHF had a 1-year mortality rate of 28% compared with 10% among patients without such signs (p <0.001). The results suggest that early treatment with metoprolol markedly reduces mortality in patients having suspected AMI and signs of CHF.", 
    "35": "About half of all deaths after myocardial infarction (MI) are sudden cardiac deaths. Most of these are thought to be due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). A number of interventions and many different antiarrhythmic agents have been investigated, but so far only beta-blocker therapy has been found to produce significant reductions in the risk of sudden cardiac death after MI. Reductions in total mortality and sudden cardiac death were first reported in 1981 in 3 placebo-controlled studies, the Norwegian Timolol Study, the American Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT), and the G\u00f6teborg Metoprolol Trial. A few years later, two very large trials, the Metoprolol in Acute Myocardial Infarction (MIAMI) study and the First International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-1), which included 6,000 and 16,000 patients, respectively, showed that beta-blocker therapy could reduce mortality within the first 2 weeks after onset of MI. Data from 24 postinfarction studies with long-term follow-up show an average 20% mortality reduction over 2 years. Pooled results of 28 short-term, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in which beta blockers were given intravenously shortly after onset of MI indicate an average 13% mortality reduction within 2 weeks. In the 16 studies in which the sudden cardiac death rate was reported, the beneficial effect of beta blockade was even more marked: a 34% average reduction of risk. Not all studies with beta blockers, however, have demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Such an effect has been clearly demonstrated only for the more lipophilic beta blockers (timolol, metoprolol, and propranolol). Two of these lipophilic beta blockers, metoprolol and propranolol, have also been shown to prevent VF after MI in clinical studies. Based on observations from animal experiments, it has been proposed that beta blockers with a high degree of lipophilicity penetrate the brain and thereby maintain high vagal tone during stress. A combination of direct anti-ischemic effects due to beta1 blockade and preservation of vagal tone appears to prevent VF in these animal models. Further clinical studies are needed to explore this hypothesis.", 
    "36": "The mechanisms precipitating sudden cardiac death may be ischemic, electrical, or mechanical. Activation of the autonomic nervous system leads to an increase in sympathetic tone, increasing blood pressure, shear forces, heart rate, platelet aggregation, and blood viscosity while decreasing heart-rate variability and lowering the ventricular fibrillation threshold. Such changes increase the likelihood of plaque rupture or erosion and platelet aggregation, resulting in ischemic or electrical sudden cardiac death. Management of benign ventricular arrhythmias should consist largely of abstinence from sympathetic nervous system stimulants; when pharmacotherapy is required, beta-adrenergic blockers are the agents of choice. Optimal therapy for potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias is not yet firmly established for amiodarone and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) use; however, appropriate secondary prevention utilizes aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and revascularization procedures. Currently, ICDs are established as a first-choice intervention for malignant ventricular arrhythmias, while the adjunctive and independent use of beta-blocker therapy and amiodarone is undergoing further investigation.", 
    "37": "A number of antianginal drugs and therapeutic strategies are now available for the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial ischemia. Of the available antianginal drugs, beta blockers appear to be most effective in suppressing myocardial ischemia. The superior anti-ischemic efficacy of beta blockers can be explained by their beneficial actions on hemodynamic parameters, vasomotion, and platelet function. Compared with other anti-ischemic drugs, beta blockers appear to be more efficacious in reducing the magnitude of myocardial ischemia during routine daily activities. In addition, the results of recent studies indicate that treatment with beta blockers not only suppresses myocardial ischemia, but also improves the clinical outcome in patients with CAD. These beneficial effects, along with the well-demonstrated cardioprotective effects of beta blockade in the postinfarction period, clearly suggest that this class of anti-ischemic drugs is an ideal therapeutic choice in most patients with CAD.", 
    "38": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are useful drugs in the treatment of hypertension. In multiple clinical trials, beta blockers have been found to decrease the incidence of stroke and overall cardiovascular mortality. To provide maximal benefit, in particular, to blunt the early-morning surge in blood pressure associated with the increased circadian incidence of sudden cardiac death, the more cardioselective and longer-acting agents of this drug class are preferred.", 
    "39": "Fundamental differences in the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of beta-adrenergic blocking agents must be considered in optimizing their efficacy and determining the appropriate selection of these drugs in different patients. Beta blockers are contraindicated in patients with asthma and should be used cautiously in heart failure. Clinically important distinctions are related to whether a beta blocker is beta1-selective or nonselective. Most adverse effects of beta-blocker use are related to interference with beta2-mediated functions including bronchodilation, vasodilation, and mobilization of free fatty acids. To achieve the potential benefits of beta1 blockade (decreased heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac workload, and excitability), a low plasma concentration of a beta1-selective drug is required. Adverse effects of beta blockers can be further decreased by selecting a sustained-release beta1-selective drug. Beta blockers are further differentiated on the basis of lipophilicity or hydrophilicity. Lipophilic beta blockers cross the blood-brain barrier, whereas hydrophilic agents do not enter the central nervous system. Some lipophilic agents (metroprolol, timolol, and propanolol) have been shown to decrease mortality in coronary heart disease, particularly sudden cardiac death.", 
    "40": "The optimal treatment of patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic stable angina is controversial. Therapeutic options include medical therapy with pharmacologic agents and/or coronary revascularization via surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and/or other transcatheter techniques. Early studies found no difference in survival between medical and surgical treatment of patients with single-vessel disease and chronic stable angina. Although PTCA has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with single-vessel disease and severe symptoms, improvement in survival and prevention of future events are not established and multiple PTCA procedures or subsequent surgical treatment may be necessary. Medical therapy may be preferred in patients with mild or no symptoms. In patients with chronic stable angina, PTCA practice may not be consistent with current guidelines, particularly obtaining laboratory evidence of ischemia before the procedure. Stenoses that may lead to future coronary events cannot be accurately identified by angiography without evidence of ischemia or symptoms. Currently available comparative studies of patients with CAD do not reflect the impact of stent procedures and aggressive lipid lowering. Therefore, diagnostic and treatment options should be individualized in patients with single-vessel disease and chronic stable angina, and additional randomized trials are necessary to determine the optimal management of these patients.", 
    "41": "Disopyramide as an antiarrhythmic can be prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation and, owing to its negative inotropic effect, to patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. It is known that in patients with cardiac conduction disturbances and heart failure, disopyramide can adversely affect heart rhythm and conduction and induce cardiovascular collapse. A patient with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and paroxysms of atrial fibrillation is described who was treated with disopyramide and also, during the 5 days before admission, with metoprolol. In spite of normal cardiac conduction and function before disopyramide, this treatment was followed by hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac conduction disturbances. Our case shows the potential for disopyramide, especially when combined with metoprolol, to induce grave adverse effects even in patients with normal cardiac conduction and ventricular function.", 
    "42": "In a previous study, it was observed that the activity of rolipram-sensitive, low-Km, cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE4) was decreased in vivo with diminished noradrenergic stimulation. The results of the present experiments indicated that the reduction in the activity may be associated with down-regulation of PDE4 protein. Immunoblot analysis using PDE4-specific, subfamily-nonspecific antibody (K116) revealed four major bands of PDE4 in rat cerebral cortex; those with apparent molecular masses of 109 and 102 kDa are variants of PDE4A. Diminished noradrenergic activity, produced by intracerebroventricular infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or chronic subcutaneous infusion of propranolol, decreased the intensities of the protein bands for the 109- and 102-kDa PDE4A variants in rat cerebral cortex but not of the 98- or 91-kDa PDE4 forms. 6-OHDA-induced noradrenergic lesioning also decreased the content of 102-kDa PDE4A in hippocampus as labeled by PDE4A-specific antibody (C-PDE4A). Enhanced noradrenergic stimulation up-regulated PDE4 in cerebral cortex. This was indicated by the finding that repeated treatment with desipramine increased the intensity of the protein band for the 102-kDa PDE4 but not for the other variants of PDE4. These results suggest that PDE4 subtypes are differentially regulated at the level of expression, as evidenced by an apparent change in the amount of PDE4 protein, following changes in noradrenergic activity. These observations are consistent with the notion that PDE4s, especially the PDE4A variants with molecular masses of 109 and 102 kDa, play an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of the noradrenergic signal transduction system in the brain and may be involved in the mediation of antidepressant activity.",

Injection of 2% lidocaine solution into the retrobulbar area, where the pterygopalatine ganglion is located, abolished the vasodilator and the secretory responses. Pretreatment with hexamethonium (an autonomic ganglion blocker) greatly attenuated the secretory response, even at a low dose (1 mg/kg given intravenously), although at this dose, the vasodilator response was only slightly affected. Neither phentolamine (an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist) nor propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), nor a vasoactive intestinal peptide antagonist had any effect on the vasodilator or secretory responses. Scopolamine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist), although having no effect on vasodilatation, had a profound inhibitory effect on the secretory response.",

    "51": "We investigated the extent of functional parasympathetic and sympathetic activity to the heart at rest and during mild to heavy dynamic exercise in conscious dogs. The animals were chronically instrumented to monitor mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and terminal aortic blood flow (TAQ) and trained to run on a motor-driven treadmill. MAP, HR, and TAQ were monitored at rest and during steady-state dynamic exercise ranging from mild [3.2 kilometers per hour (kph), 0% grade] to heavy exercise (8 kph, 15% grade). Experiments were performed before and after blocking the effects of either the parasympathetic nerves (atropine 0.2 mg/kg i.v.) or sympathetic nerves (atenolol 2.0 mg/kg i.v.) to the heart. In addition, blood samples were taken at rest and at steady state during exercise, and plasma levels of vasopressin and renin activity were assessed. At rest and during all levels of exercise, muscarinic cholinergic receptor blockade caused a marked increase in HR over control (saline treated) levels with little effect on MAP or TAQ. beta-Adrenergic receptor blockade had no significant effect on HR at rest and during mild exercise. At moderate to heavy workloads, beta-receptor blockade significantly reduced MAP, HR, and TAQ and increased plasma vasopressin levels. We conclude that, even during heavy dynamic exercise, significant functional parasympathetic tone to the heart exists. Thus, over a wide range of exercise workloads, HR is under the tonic control of both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.", 
    "52": "A role for neuropeptide Y (NPY) in neurotransmission in rat iridial arterioles has been investigated. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis has demonstrated mRNA expression for both Y1 and Y2 receptors in the superior cervical ganglion and iris. The Y1 agonist [Leu31,Pro34]NPY caused a dose-dependent constriction of iris arterioles (50% effective concentration of 10(-8) M), but, at low concentrations (10(-9) and 10(-10) M), it failed to potentiate either submaximal responses to norepinephrine (10(-6) M) or submaximal, noradrenergic responses to nerve stimulation. In contrast, 10(-7) M [Leu31,Pro34]NPY potentiated submaximal, noradrenergic responses to nerve stimulation (10 Hz, < or = 1 s) and to a concentration of norepinephrine (10(-7) M) which produced only small contractions. The Y1 antagonist 1229U91 blocked contractions induced by [Leu31,Pro34]NPY. Stimulation of the nerves for longer periods (10 or 20 Hz; 5, 30, or 60 s) revealed a component of the response which was reduced by 1229U91. This component was not apparent after brief stimuli (10 Hz, < or = 1 s), even when opposing receptor pathways were blocked. The Y2 agonist N-acetyl-[Leu28,Leu31]NPY24-36 had little effect on arterioles preconstricted with either high potassium or an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, or on nerve-mediated contractions. Results suggest that NPY, released from sympathetic nerves during long-duration, high-frequency stimulation, activates Y1 receptors on iris arterioles to produce vasoconstriction and to potentiate responses to low concentrations of norepinephrine.", 
    "53": "The role of catecholamines in the control of hepatic glucose production was studied during heavy exercise in dogs, using a technique to selectively block hepatic alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Surgery was done > 16 days before the study, at which time catheters were implanted in the carotid artery, portal vein, and hepatic vein for sampling and the portal vein and vena cava for infusions. In addition, flow probes were implanted on the portal vein and hepatic artery. Each study consisted of a 100-min equilibration, a 30-min basal, a 20-min heavy exercise (approximately 85% of maximum heart rate), a 30-min recovery, and a 30-min adrenergic blockade test period. Either saline (control; n = 7) or alpha (phentolamine)- and beta (propranolol)-adrenergic blockers (Blk; n = 6) were infused in the portal vein. In both groups, epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) were infused in the portal vein during the blockade test period to create supraphysiological levels at the liver. Isotope ([3-3H]glucose) dilution and arteriovenous differences were used to assess hepatic function. Arterial Epi, NE, glucagon, and insulin levels were similar during exercise in both groups. Endogenous glucose production (Ra) rose similarly during exercise to 7.9 +/- 1.2 and 7.5 +/- 2.0 mg.kg-1.min-1 in control and Blk groups at time = 20 min. Net hepatic glucose output also rose to a similar rate in control and Blk groups with exercise. During the blockade test period, arterial plasma glucose and Ra rose to 164 +/- 5 mg/dl and 12.0 +/- 1.4 mg.kg-1.min-1, respectively, but were essentially unchanged in Blk. The attenuated response to catecholamine infusion in Blk substantiates the effectiveness of the hepatic adrenergic blockade. In conclusion, these results show that direct hepatic adrenergic stimulation does not participate in the increase in Ra, even during the exaggerated sympathetic response to heavy exercise.", 
    "54": "The BeWo cell line (b30 clone) has been examined as a potential in vitro system to study transplacental transport. At the light and electron microscope level, the cells were observed to form confluent monolayers on polycarbonate filters in approximately 5 days and morphologically resembled the typical human trophoblast. BeWo monolayers developed a modest transepithelial electrical resistance and a molecular size-dependent permeability to hydrophilic passive diffusion markers, fluorescein, and selected fluorescein-labeled dextrans. Linoleic acid permeation across BeWo monolayers was asymmetric, saturable, and inhibited by low temperature and excess competing fatty acid. Forskolin and 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate treatments stimulated morphological changes in BeWo cultures and enhanced the asymmetric passage of linoleic acid across the BeWo monolayers while having minimal effects on passive permeability, affirming that the differentiation state of the cells can influence membrane transporters and transmonolayer permeability. The basic permeability properties of the BeWo monolayers suggest that the cells grown on permeable supports may be examined as a convenient in vitro system to evaluate some transplacental transport mechanisms.", 
    "55": "Chronic heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting >4 million people. The increasing prevalence of HF has placed an enormous burden on the US healthcare system. For many patients with cardiovascular disease, HF is the final common pathway. Treatment strategies for HF are aimed at preventing and delaying progression of the disease and ultimately improving survival. This article reviews recent clinical drug trials for HF, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, vasodilators, beta-adrenergic blockers, positive inotropic agents, calcium antagonists, and antiarrhythmics. The benefits and shortcomings of these agents and the study designs are discussed. For patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, ACE inhibitors are the only agents that consistently improved survival and decreased the rate of HF progression. It is likely that beta-adrenergic blockers have the same effect. The syndrome of HF is complex with both peripheral and cardiac factors contributing to disease progression. The addition of a diuretic and/or digoxin is often needed to prevent worsening heart failure. Although an angiotensin II antagonist may also be beneficial in the treatment of HF, further studies are needed to clarify their precise role in the management of this condition. Calcium anatagonists, antiarrhythmics excluding amiodarone, and positive inotropes other than digoxin do not appear to prevent progression of HF nor improve survival. The most common cause of HF in the United States is related to coronary artery disease. Reduction of cardiac risk factors, such as smoking cessation, lowering serum cholesterol with diet and a lipid lowering agent, and blood pressure control, is likely to prevent the development or progression of HF.",

The involvement of beta1-adrenergic receptors has been demonstrated by the ability of acute administration of beta-antagonists to suppress the nocturnal rise of circulating melatonin and its urinary metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s). The present study was undertaken to examine the relationship between increasing doses of atenolol and nocturnal plasma melatonin concentrations. Six healthy subjects participated in the study for a period of 5 weeks. Subjects were administered placebo, 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg doses of atenolol in a randomized single blind design. Each dose was separated by a 1 week washout period. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals from 19.00 hr to 06.00 hr. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed a dose-dependent decrease in plasma melatonin concentrations (P<0.01). A Student Newman-Keuls post hoc test indicated significant differences between placebo and all doses of atenolol (P<0.05).

The choice of initial pharmacological therapy is one area where the different hypertension management guidelines vary in recommending either the use of diuretics and beta-blockers as preferred drugs or choosing from any of the five major classes of antihypertensives. 2. Improvement in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality may have been shown most conclusively with diuretics and beta-blockers, but the effects on coronary events with these drugs were less than predicted and the other agents have a number of theoretical advantages. 3. Recent worries regarding the possible adverse effects of calcium antagonists have led to a reappraisal of the risks and benefits of these drugs and antihypertensives in general. 4. Many patients, particularly the elderly, have other conditions that influence the choice of first-line therapy and ethnic variations in the effects of hypertension or the efficacy or side effects of drugs should also be taken into account. 5.

The modulatory actions of both adenosine A1 and kappa 1-opioid receptor agonists on beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in the heart of both spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were compared. 2. In both types of rats, both R(-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (R-PIA), an adenosine A1 receptor agonist, and U50 488H, a kappa 1-opioid receptor agonist, inhibited the stimulatory effects of beta-adrenoceptor activation on electrically induced [Ca2+]i transients measured by a spectrofluorometric method with fura-2/AM as the calcium indicator. The effects of these two agonists were blocked by their respective antagonists, namely 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-diprolxanthine and norbinaltorphimine. 3. The inhibitory actions of both R-PIA and U50 488H on beta-adrenoceptor augmentation of electrically induced [Ca2+]i transients in the heart were more significantly reduced in SHR than in WKY rats, suggesting the negative modulatory actions of endogenous substances on beta-adrenoceptors were impaired in SHR, which may contribute to hypertension.", 
    "66": "1. We tested the hypothesis that the pattern and the intensity of autonomic mechanisms causing vasoconstriction in the resting bronchial circulation of awake dogs also exists in awake sheep. It was also postulated that sighing behaviour and the associated bronchovascular dilatation induced by non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) mechanisms observed in the dog exist in sheep. 2. Bronchial arterial blood flow to lower airways of both lungs of awake sheep was measured continuously using pulsed Doppler flow probes mounted on the bronchial artery at prior thoracotomy. 3. Cumulative and factorial analysis of responses to randomized combinations of autonomic alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors and cholinoceptor autonomic blockade suggests that resting vasoconstrictor activity is less in sheep than in dogs. At normal aortic pressure, the autonomic activity of these receptor groups in the sheep lowers bronchial blood flow and conductance by 30%, whereas in the awake dog, the corresponding autonomic effect is 50%. 4. Tonic autonomic control of bronchial conductance can be partitioned in sheep to show significant and separate alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor vasoconstrictor activity at a ratio of 1.8:1, an effect normally offset by a weaker vasodilator alpha-/beta-adrenoceptor interaction. In contrast to the situation in awake dogs, cholinoceptors do not play a role in awake sheep. 5. Nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibition in sheep using NG-nitro-L-arginine following blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors and cholinoceptors causes hypertension, but minor changes, if any, in pulmonary pressures or heart rate. Bronchial flow and conductance, however, fall from a higher resting conductance by approximately 50%, suggesting that, normally, resting bronchial flow conductance is dominated by strong tonic NO vasodilator effects that interact with weaker tonic autonomic vasoconstrictor effects. 6. Superimposed (respiratory) behaviours of sighing, sneezing and coughing, which involve negative swings in intrathoracic pressure and the movement of inspired air, evoke large active bronchovascular dilator effects. These appear to be largely NANC in origin and appear to be dependent, in part, on mechanisms associated with NO release. It is postulated that the C-fibre axon reflex using substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide and neurokinin A may be involved. Vocalization and eructation do not evoke bronchovascular effects.", 
    "67": "1. Ketamine has a number of effects that suggest that it may interact with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. To date, the experimental evidence for this has been indirect and has been based on physiological studies using competitive blocking agents. In the present study we sought to determine from receptor binding studies whether ketamine binds directly to alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. 2. Membrane preparations of alpha 1- and beta 2-adrenergic binding sites were obtained from urinary bladder and urethrae of sheep. These binding sites were characterized by saturation analyses using [3H]-prazosin for alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites and [125I]-cyanopindolol (CYP) for the beta 2-adrenoceptor binding sites. The receptors were further characterized by displacement studies using selective and non-selective antagonists. 3. Studies in which ketamine was used to displace [3H]-prazosin revealed a Kd of 3.40 +/- 1.23 x 10(-3) mol/L for ketamine binding to alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Displacement studies of [125I]-CYP by ketamine showed a Kd of 0.35 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) mol/L for ketamine binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors. 4. We conclude that ketamine interacts directly with both alpha 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors and that such interactions probably explain the reported effects of this agent on the vasculature and the bronchial tree.", 
    "68": "To determine whether prior acute Beta blockade protects the heart against the deleterious effects of normothermic low flow global ischemia on myocardial function, aortic pressure, developed pressure, dP/dtmax and end diastolic pressure were monitored in isolated perfused rabbit hearts prior to, during and following 30 and 60 min ischemia, during which either Krebs-Henseleit (control) or Beta blocking agents. Bevantolol (cardioselective) or Propranolol (non-selective) were perfused through the heart. Control hearts made ischemic for 30 min and then reperfused had significantly elevated end diastolic (p < .01) and aortic pressures (p < .01) and reduced developed pressure relative to baseline (p < .05). Hearts treated with Bevantolol or Propranolol (3 x 10(-5) m/l) 5 min prior to and during 30 min ischemia recovered preischemic developed pressure and dP/dtmax (p > 0.05), while end diastolic pressure was elevated (p < .01, p < .05 respectively). Aortic pressure was unchanged relative to baseline (p > .05). Comparison of indices from hearts under Beta blockade with controls showed that following 30 min ischemia and recovery, the Bevantolol treated group had reduced aortic pressure (p < .01) and end diastolic pressure (p < .05) and increased percent developed pressure and percent dP/dtmax (p < .001) relative to control. In the propranolol treated group, end diastolic pressure was reduced and percent developed pressure (p < .01) and percent dP/dtmax (p < .001) were increased relative to unblocked hearts. Following 60 min ischemia and 30 min reperfusion, reduction in all functional indices occurred, however dP/dtmax was unchanged from baseline in the Propranolol and Bevantolol treated groups. Comparison between groups showed that the Bevantolol treated group had significantly better dP/dtmax and developed pressure (p < .05), whereas the Propranolol group shows no significant difference from baseline (p > .05) (K-H). We conclude that following short periods of ischemia, Beta blockade protects the heart from deleterious function effects of ischemia but that the protective effect is diminished in Bevantolol relative to Propranolol treatments following prolonged ischemia. The data indicates that the beneficial effects of Beta blockade in reducing ischemic induced damage occurs early during conditions of ischemia such as would be present in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.",

We placed 6 dogs on CPB and 6 dogs on a biventricular assist device and created \"beta-blocker-induced cardiac surgical conditions\" by suppressing myocardial chronotropy and inotropy with systemic infusion of the ultra-short acting beta-blocker esmolol. For the clinical study we randomized 60 coronary artery surgery patients to receive either crystalloid cardioplegia (Bretschneider HTK) or selective continuous coronary perfusion via the aortic root with warm esmolol-enriched CPB blood. In the experimental study we found that continuous coronary perfusion with warm esmolol-enriched blood avoided myocardial ischemia and minimized myocardial edema, thus completely preserving cardiac performance. Our clinical data showed the alternative technique to be superior to standard crystalloid cardioplegia in terms of both functional and structural myocardial protection. The concept of beta-blocker-induced cardiac surgical conditions is a useful alternative for myocardial protection during coronary artery surgery and may be particularly beneficial for severely compromised hearts.", 
    "77": "It is 10 years since the CONSENSUS I study showed that ACE inhibitors improved mortality in heart failure. This finding has been confirmed in numerous trials, for example SOLVD, SAVE. Indeed, in the intervening 10 years, many other potential therapies have been examined in mortality trials, but so far no other therapy has had as good effect on mortality as ACE inhibitors. The other therapies which have been examined are digoxin, amlodipine, beta-blockers, amiodarone, etc. Despite ACE inhibitors being a very effective therapy for heart failure, there is still remarkable under-use of them in clinical practice. The reason for this needs to be explained further, but fear of hypothermia and renal dysfunction appear to be major factors.",

    "79": "The study subjects were the 456 randomly selected men born in 1914, the population-based cohort study of 1982-83, in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. The main outcome measures were total mortality and incidence of cardiac event (myocardial infarction and death from ischaemic heart disease). Frequent or complex ventricular arrhythmias (Lown classes 2-5) were detected in 49% of the men with (n = 77), and in 35% of those without, a history of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris at baseline, P = 0.019. Independent of clinically evident coronary artery disease at baseline, and after adjustment for traditional atherosclerotic risk factors and use of digitalis or beta-blocker therapy, frequent or complex ventricular arrhythmias were associated with an increased mortality from ischaemic heart disease (relative risk (RR), 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-3.9) and an increased cardiac event rate (RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.5)). Men free from both ischaemic-type ST depression and frequent or complex ventricular arrhythmias (used as the control group) had the lowest ischaemic heart disease death rate, 5.9 per 1000 person-years. The combination of ST depression and frequent or complex ventricular arrhythmias was associated with an ischaemic heart disease death rate of 20.9 per 1000 person-years. The cardiac event rate in these two groups was 15.6 and 76.1 per 1000 person-years, respectively (adjusted RR, 2.3; CI, 1.1-4.6).",

    "82": "The study was double-blind, parallel, randomized and controlled, and comprised 363 patients from 27 outpatient cardiology clinics in the Netherlands. The patients had angina and positive bicycle exercise tests despite optimal beta-blockade (resting heart rate < 65 beats.min-1). Randomization was to three treatment groups: continuation of metoprolol (control), addition of felodipine to metoprolol, and replacement of metoprolol by felodipine. Exercise tests were repeated after 2 and 5 weeks. The main outcome measure was: exercise result after 5 weeks, compared with baseline, between-group comparison of changes vs control. There were no significant differences in exercise duration and onset of chest pain vs control. The addition of felodipine increased time until 1 mm ST depression (43 s, 95% confidence interval 20-65 s), and decreased both ST depression at highest comparable work load (0.46 mm, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.72), and maximal ST depression (0.49 mm, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.74). Exercise results after replacement of metoprolol by felodipine were not different from control, apart from a significant increase in rate pressure product.

    "84": "The dye methylene blue is known as a blocker of guanylyl cyclase and it has been widely used to deplete cells of internal cyclic GMP. The data presented demonstrate an activation of adult rat sensory neurons by methylene blue via a photosensitive mechanism. In single fiber recordings from primary afferents of the rat skin in vitro, methylene blue, applied to the receptive field, induced discharge activity: 2/2 A beta-, 2/4 A delta- and 5/7 C-fibers showed significantly enhanced firing upon 10 microM methylene blue in the presence of light, whereas the dye was ineffective when illumination was prevented. In whole cell current clamp experiments with dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons, 100 microM methylene blue was ineffective in the dark but evoked a membrane depolarization of 15.3 +/- 3.5 mV (n = 5) accompanied by discharge activity upon illumination. In whole cell voltage clamp experiments, methylene blue (100 microM) caused a significant slowing of the inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium currents. In addition, an inhibition of fast and slow outward currents was observed with prolonged exposure. The impeded sodium inactivation together with the blockade of potassium currents may contribute to the depolarization and discharge activity observed in primary afferents in vitro as well as in dissociated sensory neurons in culture. We therefore suggest that methylene blue studies with excitable cells or tissues need to be interpreted with caution.", 
    "85": "1. Total RNA isolated from embryonic chick paravertebral sympathetic ganglia was used in a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay with a pair of degenerate oligonucleotide primers deduced from conserved regions of mammalian glycine receptor alpha-subunits. Three classes of cDNA were identified which encode portions of the chicken homologues of the mammalian glycine receptor alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits. 2. The presence of functional glycine receptors was investigated in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique in neurons dissociated from the ganglia and kept in culture for 7-8 days. In cells voltage clamped to -70 mV, glycine consistently induced inward currents in a concentration-dependent manner and elicited half-maximal peak current amplitudes at 43 microM. 3. The steady-state current-voltage relation for glycine-induced currents was linear between +80 and -60 mV, but showed outward rectification at more hyperpolarized potentials. Reversal potentials of these currents shifted with changes in intracellular chloride concentrations and matched the calculated Nernst potentials for chloride. 4. beta-Alanine and taurine were significantly less potent than glycine in triggering inward currents, with half-maximal responses at 79 and 86 microM, respectively. At maximally active concentrations, beta-alanine-evoked currents were identical in amplitude to those induced by glycine. Taurine-evoked currents, in contrast, never reached the same amplitude as glycine-induced currents. 5. The classical glycine receptor antagonist strychnine reversibly reduced glycine-induced currents, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 62 nM. Two more recently characterized glycine receptor antagonists, isonipecotic acid (half-maximal inhibition at 2 mM) and 7-trifluoromethyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (half-maximal inhibition at 67 microM), also blocked glycine-evoked currents in a reversible manner. The chloride channel blocker picrotoxin reduced glycine-evoked currents, with half-maximal effects at 348 microM. Inhibition by the glycine receptor channel blocker cyanotriphenylborate was half-maximal at 4 microM. 6. Apart from evoking inward currents, glycine occasionally triggered short (< 100 ms) spike-like currents which were abolished by hexamethonium and thus reflected synaptic release of endogenous acetylcholine. In addition, glycine caused Ca(2+)-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive tritium overflow from neurons previously labelled with [3H]noradrenaline. This stimulatory action of glycine was reduced in the presence of strychnine and after treatment with the chloride uptake inhibitor furosemide (frusemide). 7. In 65% of neurons loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester, glycine increased the ratio of the fluorescence signal obtained with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, respectively, which indicates a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. 8. The results show that sympathetic neurons contain transcripts for different glycine receptor alpha-subunits and carry functional heteromeric glycine receptors which depolarize the majority of neurons to trigger transmitter release.", 
    "86": "1. The nature of rat and human fat cell beta 3-adrenoceptors was investigated by studying the effects of the new beta 3-adrenoceptor selective antagonist, SR 59,230A, on lipolysis induced by the conventional beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists, CL 316,243 and SR 58,611A, and by the non-conventional partial beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist CGP 12,177 (a potent beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist property). 2. In rat fat cells, the rank order of potency of agonists was: CL 316,243 > isoprenaline > SR 58,611A > CGP 12,177. The three former agents were full agonists whereas CGP 12,177 was a partial agonist (intrinsic activity of 0.70). In human fat cells, the lipolytic effect of CGP 12,177 reached 25% of isoprenaline effect. CL 316,243 was a poor inducer of lipolysis and SR 58,611A was ineffective. 3. In rat fat cells, lipolysis induced by CL 316,243 and SR 58,611A was competitively antagonized by SR 59,230A. Schild plots were linear with pA2 value of 6.89 and 6.37, respectively. Conversely, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 microM SR 59,230A did not modify the concentration-response curve of CGP 12,177. A rightward shift of the curve was however observed with 10 and 100 microM of SR 59,230A. The apparent pA2 value was 5.65. The non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist, bupranolol, competitively displaced the concentration-response curve of CGP 12,177 and CL 316,243. Schild plots were linear with pA2 values of 6.70 and 7.59, respectively. CL316,243-mediated lipolytic effect was not antagonized by CGP 20,712A. In human fat cells, CGP 12,177-mediated lipolytic effect was antagonized by bupranolol and CGP 20,712A. SR 59,230A (0.1, 1 and 10 microM) did not modify the concentration-response curve of CGP 12,177. A rightward shift was however observed at 100 microM leading to an apparent pA2 value of 4.32. 4. The results suggest that the non-conventional partial agonist CGP 12,177 can activate lipolysis in fat cells through the interaction with a beta-adrenoceptor pharmacologically distinct from the beta 3-adrenoceptor, i.e. through a putative beta 4-adrenoceptor. They suggest that the two subtypes coexist in rat fat cells whereas only the putative beta 4-adrenoceptor mediates lipolytic effect of CGP12,177 in human fat cells.", 
    "87": "1. The prostate of the guinea pig responds to electrical field-stimulation (2 s trains, 0.1 ms pulses at 3-60 Hz, supramaximal voltage) with contractile responses. At 18 Hz these responses were inhibited (82 +/- 2%) by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine (10 microM) and (by 100%) by the neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin (500 nM). The alpha 1A-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, 5-methylurapidil, inhibited responses to field stimulation in the absence and presence of nifedipine (10 microM) with -log molar (p) IC50 (+/- s.e. mean) values of 7.95 +/- 0.14 and 7.01 +/- 0.07, respectively. 2. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, reduced (56 +/- 8%) field stimulation induced contractile responses (pEC50 6.91 +/- 0.11). The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (50 nM) and the beta 1-adrenoceptor selective antagonist, atenolol (3 microM), but not the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 ((+/-)-1 -[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxyl]-3-[1-methylethyl)amino ]-2-butanol HCl; 100 nM) antagonized this effect (apparent pKB values 8.44 +/- 0.22 and 6.92 +/- 0.21, respectively) indicating an effect mediated through beta 1-like adrenoceptors. In the presence of nifedipine (10 microM) isoprenaline (up to 10 microM) did not inhibit the remaining response to field-stimulation. 3. Phenylephrine elicited contractile responses (pEC50 4.47 +/- 0.30) from preparations of guinea pig prostate which were reduced (63 +/- 25%) by nifedipine (10 microM). This response was antagonized by 5-methylurapidil (100 nM, apparent pKB 8.24 +/- 0.33), but was not affected by preincubation chloroethylclonidine (50 microM, 30 min). Responses to phenylephrine (30 microM) were inhibited (by up to 52 +/- 5%) by isoprenaline (pIC50 6.40 +/- 0.35, the beta 2-adrenoceptor selective agonist, salbutamol was weakly effective). Propranolol (300 nM), ICI 118,551 (100 nM) and atenolol (3 microM) shifted isoprenaline concentration-response curves to the right (apparent pKB +/- s.e. values 7.68 +/- 1.10; 8.00 +/- 0.72 and 6.62 +/- 0.95, respectively). In the presence of nifedipine (10 microM) responses to phenylephrine (30 microM,) were inhibited (by up to 51 +/- 4%) by isoprenaline (pIC50 6.88 +/- 0.17): propranolol (300 nM) and ICI 118,551 (100 nM), but not atenolol (3 microM) antagonized this effect (apparent pKB values 8.85 +/- 1.53 and 8.35 +/- 1.18, respectively). Thus beta 1-like and beta 2-like adrenoceptors may be involved in the isoprenaline-stimulated inhibition of phenylephrine concentration-response curves. 4. Phenylephrine stimulated [3H]-inositol phosphate accumulation (pEC50 4.47 +/- 0.83), an effect insensitive to chloroethylclonidine pre-treatment (50 microM, 30 min) and to nifedipine (10 microM), but inhibited by 5-methylurapidil (apparent pKD 7.90 +/- 0.22). Isoprenaline (up to 1 microM) did not affect the phenylephrine-stimulated maximal increase in [3H]-inositol phosphates but did increase [3H]-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ([3H]-cAMP) accumulation (pEC50 6.77 +/- 0.66); propranolol (30 nM) and ICI 118,551 (110 nM), but not atenolol (up to 3 microM), antagonized this effect. These responses may therefore be mediated through beta 2-like adrenoceptors. 5. These results show that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated and field stimulation-induced contractions of the guinea pig prostate are partly dependent upon intracellular and extracellular sources of Ca2+. We conclude that both beta 1- and beta 2-like adrenoceptors inhibit responses to phenylephrine in the prostate of the guinea pig. The beta 1-like adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of these responses is evident upon the field stimulation-induced and nifedipine-sensitive component of the response to phenylephrine and may not involve the activation of adenylyl cyclase. The beta 2-like adrenoceptor may inhibit both nifedipine sensitive and insensitive components of the response to phenylephrine, possibly through the activation of adenylyl cyclase, but not through the i", 
    "88": "1. The haemodynamic effects of angiotensin II (AII) and, for comparison, arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the femoral and superior mesenteric artery of urethane-anaesthetized rats were analysed with the ultrasonic transit time shift technique. 2. I.v. bolus injection of AII (0.1-3 nmol kg-1) and AVP (0.03-1 nmol kg-1) increased blood pressure which was accompanied by a decrease in blood flow through the superior mesenteric artery and an increase in femoral blood flow. The femoral hyperaemia was in part due to vasodilatation as indicated by a rise of femoral vascular conductance up to 200% relative to baseline. The femoral vasodilatation caused by AVP, but not AII, was followed by vasoconstriction. 3. Blockade of angiotensin AT1 receptors by telmisartan (0.2-20 mumol kg-1) prevented all haemodynamic responses to AII. 4. The femoral dilator responses to AII and AVP depended on the increase in vascular perfusion pressure since vasodilatation was reversed to vasoconstriction when blood pressure was maintained constant by means of a gravity reservoir. However, the AII-evoked femoral vasodilatation was not due to an autonomic or neuroendocrine reflex because it was not depressed by hexamethonium (75 mumol kg-1), prazosin (0.25 mumol kg-1) or propranolol (3 mumol kg-1). 5. The AII-induced femoral vasodilatation was suppressed by blockade of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 40 mumol kg-1) and reversed to vasoconstriction when L-NAME was combined with indomethacin (30 mumol kg-1), but was left unaltered by antagonism of endothelin ETA/B receptors with bosentan (37 mumol kg-1). 6. These results demonstrate that the effect of AII to increase systemic blood pressure and the resulting rise of perfusion pressure in the femoral artery stimulates the formation of NO and prostaglandins and thereby dilates the femoral arterial bed. This local vasodilator mechanism is sufficient to mask the direct vasoconstrictor response to AII.", 
    "89": "To evaluate the effects of antihypertensive agents on the circadian blood pressure (BP) of patients with previous brain infarction, the ambulatory BP was measured non-invasively for 24 h before and after administration of antihypertensive agents. One hundred milligrams of acebutolol twice daily (n = 15) is effective in lowering the BP during the daytime, but has little effect during the night and the morning. Twenty milligrams of slow-release nifedipine twice daily (n = 14) produced a consistent reduction in the BP over the entire 24-h period and effectively blunted the rise in BP in the morning. Captopril (12.5 mg) twice daily (n = 15) produced a mild reduction in BP with little change in the circadian pattern. The slow-release nifedipine group had the greatest decrease in mean systolic and diastolic BP. The heart rate significantly increased after administration of slow-release nifedipine and decreased after administration of acebutolol. To reduce stroke recurrence, we should consider the effects of antihypertensive agents on circadian BP in hypertensive patients with previous brain infarction.", 
    "90": "We conducted an open-label study to determine the impact of cytochrome P-4502D6 (CYP2D6) on propranolol pharmacokinetics and response in 12 healthy men with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotype and 3 healthy men with CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype. Subjects received R,S-propranolol hydrochloride 80 mg every 8 hours for 16 doses. After the sixteenth dose, blood and urine samples were collected for 24 hours, and serum propranolol and urine metabolite concentrations were determined by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography. Heart rate response to treadmill exercise was measured serially over 24 hours. Apparent oral clearance of propranolol and partial metabolic clearance values of propranolol to 4-hydroxypropranolol (HOP), propranolol glucuronide, and naphloxylactic acid (NLA) were estimated. Apparent oral clearance and elimination half-life of propranolol were not different between EMs and PMs. Partial metabolic clearance of propranolol to HOP was significantly higher and to NLA was significantly lower in EMs than in PMs. No differences in percentage reductions in exercise heart rate were observed between EMs and PMs. The CYP2D6 PM phenotype has no effect on propranolol blood concentrations and does not alter response to propranolol. Our data also suggest that CYP2D6 mediates approximately 65% and 70% of S- and R-propranolol's 4-hydroxylation, respectively.", 
    "91": "d,l-Sotalol is a noncardioselective beta-blocker that has class III antiarrhythmic activity. It is often used to convert atrial fibrillation (AF) to normal sinus rhythm. Since class III agents increase action potential duration and refractoriness in atrial tissue without affecting conduction, they are theoretically considered ideal agents for the treatment of reentrant arrhythmias such as AF. We reviewed the literature evaluating the efficacy of sotalol for restoring sinus rhythm in patients with acute or chronic AF. Articles indexed on MEDLINE (1966-1996) and referenced articles not identified by MEDLINE that compared sotalol with placebo or another antiarrhythmic agent were included. Sotalol was significantly inferior to quinidine in converting AF of recent onset (< 48 hrs) to sinus rhythm. In patients with duration of AF of more than 48 hours, sotalol was significantly less effective than quinidine and comparable with placebo. Conversion rates for sotalol in all studies combined ranged from 8-49%. Published studies do not support the drug for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm. Larger well-designed studies are required to evaluate its efficacy and optimum dosage for this indication. Until further data are available, pharmacologic cardioversion with traditional class I antiarrhythmic agents may be preferable as they are effective particularly for recent-onset AF.", 
    "92": "The precise mechanism of action of alpha 2 adrenoceptor blockers in not known, although in principle they have two main effects: (i) they stimulate the norepinephrinergic system by inhibiting the negative feed back of norepinephrine release (presynaptic effect) and (ii) they inhibit the effects of norepinephrine on postsynaptic alpha 2 adrenoceptors. We postulate that if the presynaptic actions of the antagonists prevail, the enhanced norepinephrine release leads to an activation of postsynaptic alpha 1 or beta adrenoceptors. In this case the effects of alpha 2 adrenoceptor blockers can be reversed by antagonists acting on the latter two adrenoceptors, since postsynaptic alpha 2 adrenoceptors are also blocked. If the postsynaptic blockade of alpha 2 adrenoceptors is the main cause of effects, than the blockade of alpha 1 or beta adrenoceptors should not reverse the action of alpha 2 blockers. The alpha 2 blocker idazoxan (dose 0.5-5 mg/kg) increased locomotor activity in an open field, an effect that was abolished by both alpha 1 and beta receptor blockers (prazosin and propranolol, respectively). Escape responses in a shuttle box were strongly suppressed by idazoxan (0.5-2 mg/kg). However, this effect was not changed by concomitant alpha 1 or beta receptor blockade. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of alpha 2 adrenoceptor blockers depends on which effects are studied. Exploration seems to be affected by a presynaptic mechanism as neurons bearing postsynaptic alpha 1 or beta adrenoceptors are involved in the control of this behavior, while escape reactions appear to be affected by the postsynaptic blockade of alpha 2 adrenoceptors (i.e. neurons bearing postsynaptic alpha 2 adrenoceptors are involved in its control). Thus, there is no generalized mechanism of action for alpha 2 adrenoceptor blockers; their precise mode of action should be investigated in each particular case.", 
    "93": "To investigate the effects of carteolol, which is a nonselective beta-adrenergic agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, on silent myocardial ischemia, exercise-induced myocardial ischemia, indexes of heart rate variability, and pain-modulating system, 20 patients (mean 60 +/- 9 years) with chronic stable angina underwent exercise treadmill testing and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring during 2 weeks of carteolol administration (15 mg/day) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Plasma levels of beta-endorphin and bradykinin and electrical pain stimulation to the skin were measured at rest and peak exercise. Indexes of heart rate variability of both time-domain and frequency-domain analysis were derived from 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Carteolol decreased maximal heart rate responses to daily activities during ambulatory monitoring and significantly reduced the median frequency and duration of silent myocardial ischemic episodes (from 1.0 to 0.0 events/24 hr and from 16 to 0 min/24 hr, respectively). Carteolol significantly decreased the rate-pressure product at rest and during exercise with improving maximal ST segment depression, suggesting amelioration of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Carteolol did not significantly affect plasma levels of beta-endorphin and bradykinin or pain threshold. It significantly decreased some indexes (standard deviation of all normal sinus R-R intervals in the entire 24-hour recording and standard deviation of the mean of all 5-minute segments of normal R-R intervals of a 24-hour recording) of heart rate variability. These results suggest that carteolol may reduce total myocardial ischemic burden by the reduction of cardiac oxygen demand during daily activities and exercise stress, while not affecting plasma levels of beta-endorphin, bradykinin, and pain threshold. Because carteolol tended to decrease indexes of heart rate variability, significant caution might be necessary in prescribing the beta-blocking agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity like carteolol to patients with potential serious arrhythmia.", 
    "94": "To directly compare dobutamine echocardiography and resting single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) thallium-201 (Tl-201) scintigraphy for the detection of reversible dysfunction, 64 patients underwent dobutomine echocardiography (baseline, low dose 5 and 10 mg/kg/min, and peak dose), rest Tl-201 scintigraphy (3 mCi - 15 minute and 3- to 4-hour SPECT imaging), and coronary angiography during the first week after acute myocardial infarction. Follow-up echocardiography was performed 4 to 8 weeks after discharge. Wall thickening improved at follow-up in 52% (207 of 399) of the dysfunctional segments. By receiver operating characteristic analysis, biphasic responses and sustained improvement during dobutamine echocardiography were more accurate (p < 0.01) than Tl-201 uptake by SPECT scintigraphy for reversible dysfunction. The greater accuracy of dobutamine echocardiography resulted from higher accuracy in akinetic segments, Q wave infarction, and multivessel coronary artery disease. In conclusion, dobutamine echocardiography was more accurate than resting SPECT Tl-201 scintigraphy for reversible dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "95": "Recently, we developed a goat model of chronic atrial fibrillation (AF). Due to AF, the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) shortened and its physiological rate adaptation inversed, whereas the rate and stability of AF increased.

    "96": "Twenty-five goats were chronically instrumented with multiple epicardial atrial electrodes. Infusion of atropine (1.0 mg/kg; n=6) or propranolol (0.6 mg/kg; n=6) did not abolish the AF-induced shortening of AERP or interval (AFI). Blockade of K+(ATP) channels by glibenclamide (10 micromol/kg; n=6) slightly increased the AFI from 95+/-4 to 101+/-5 ms, but AFI remained considerably shorter than during acute AF (145 ms). Glibenclamide had no significant effect on AERP after electrical cardioversion of AF (69+/-14 versus 75+/-15 ms). Volume loading by 0.5 to 1.0 L of Hemaccel (n=12) did not shorten AERP. The median plasma level of ANF increased from 42 to 99 pg/mL after 1 to 4 weeks of AF (n=6), but ANF infusion (0.1 to 3.1 microg/min, n=4) did not shorten AERP.

    "102": "From a Xenopus stage 11 cDNA library, we have cloned a gene, termed X-beta1AR, whose sequence is highly homologous to that of the human beta1-adrenergic receptor. As shown by RT-PCR assay, X-beta1AR RNA is present in the mature oocyte, decreases after fertilization up to stage 6 and then gradually increases during gastrulation. Binding studies performed with radiolabeled ligands reveal that X-beta1AR RNA is translated into the receptor protein. Furthermore, noradrenaline and adrenaline are also detected in oocytes and early embryos. The concomitant presence of beta1-adrenergic receptors and catecholamines suggest that this ligand-receptor couple could play a role in the very early stages of embryonic development.", 
    "103": "Relationships between apolipoproteins and other lipid parameters and cardiovascular (CV) prognosis were evaluated in the Angina Prognosis Study In Stockholm (APSIS). Out of 809 patients with stable angina pectoris, lipid variables were obtained in 786 patients at baseline, and after one month's double-blind treatment with metoprolol or verapamil, to evaluate treatment effects on these lipid variables. During a median follow-up time of 3.3 years (2663 patient years), 37 patients suffered a CV death, 30 suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and 100 underwent a revascularization. Apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were predictors of CV death or non-fatal MI in univariate analyses, but only apo A-I remained as an independent predictor in multivariate analyses. All lipid variables except low density lipoprotein cholesterol were related to the risk of revascularization in univariate analyses, but only apo A-I and apo B were independent predictors of such events. Triglycerides were weakly, but not independently, associated with prognosis. Verapamil and metoprolol had differential short-term effects on lipids, with a shift towards a more atherogenic profile in metoprolol treated patients. However, there was no significant impact of the treatment given, or of these treatment effects on the risk of CV events. Results of the present study suggest that apolipoprotein levels were better predictors of CV events than other lipid parameters in patients with stable angina pectoris.", 
    "104": "Recent clinical studies have reported a greater effectiveness of sodium channel block with mexiletine to abbreviate the QT interval in patients with the chromosome 3 variant (SCN5A, LQT3) of the long QT syndrome (LQTS) than those with the chromosome 7 form of the disease (HERG, LQT2), suggesting the possibility of gene-specific therapy for the two distinct forms of the congenital LQTS. Experimental studies using the arterially perfused left ventricular wedge preparation have confirmed these clinical observations on the QT interval but have gone on to further demonstrate a potent effect of mexiletine to reduce dispersion of repolarization and prevent torsades de pointes (TdP) in both LQT2 and LQT3 models. A differential action of sodium channel block on the three ventricular cell types is thought to mediate these actions of mexiletine. This study provides a test of this hypothesis by examining the effects of mexiletine in isolated canine ventricular epicardial, endocardial, and M region tissues under conditions that mimic the SCN5A and HERG gene defects.", 
    "105": "We used standard microelectrode techniques to record transmembrane activity from endocardial, epicardial, mid-myocardial, and transmural strips isolated from the canine left ventricle. d-Sotalol, an IKr blocker, was used to mimic the HERG defect (LQT2), and ATX-II, which increases late Na channel current, was used to mimic the SCN5A defect (LQT3). d-Sotalol (100 microM) preferentially prolonged the action potential of the mid-myocardial M cell (APD90 increased from 340 +/- 65 to 623 +/- 203 msec) as did ATX-II (10 to 20 nM; APD90 increased from 325 +/- 51 to 580 +/- 178 msec; basic cycle length = 2000 msec), thus causing a marked increase in transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR). Mexiletine (2 to 20 microM) dose-dependently reversed the ATX-II-induced prolongation of APD90 in all three cell types. Mexiletine also reversed the d-sotalol-induced prolongation of the M cell action potential duration (APD), but had little effect on the action potential of epicardium and endocardium. Due to its preferential effect to abbreviate the action potential of M cells, mexiletine reduced the dispersion of repolarization in both models. Low concentrations of mexiletine (5 to 10 microM) totally suppressed early afterdepolarization (EAD) and EAD-induced triggered activity in both models.", 
    "106": "Our results indicate that the actions of mexiletine are both cell and model specific, but that sodium channel block with mexiletine is effective in reducing transmural differences in APD and in abolishing triggered activity induced by d-sotalol and ATX-II. The data suggest that mexiletine's actions to reduce TDR and prevent the induction of spontaneous and programmed stimulation-induced TdP in these models are due to a preferential effect of the drug to abbreviate the APD of the M cell and to suppress the development of EADs. The data provide further support for the hypothesis that block of the late sodium current may be of value in the treatment of LQT2 as well as LQT3 and perhaps other congenital and acquired (drug-induced) forms of LQTS.",

In addition to its beta-blocking properties, amiodarone is known to block the sodium, potassium, and calcium channels in the heart. Its complex electropharmacology notwithstanding, the reasons for the high efficacy of the drug remain unclear. Also not well understood is the basis for the low incidence of proarrhythmia seen with amiodarone relative to other agents with Class III actions. The present study was designed to examine the effects of chronic amiodarone in epicardial, endocardial, and M cells of the canine left ventricle.",

Tissues were obtained from mongrel dogs receiving amiodarone orally (30 to 40 mg/kg per day) for 30 to 45 days or from untreated controls. Chronic amiodarone produced a greater prolongation of action potential duration in epicardium and endocardium, but less of an increase, or even a decrease at slow rates, in the M region, thereby reducing transmural dispersion of repolarization. In addition, chronic amiodarone therapy suppressed the ability of the IKr blocker, d-sotalol, to induce a marked dispersion of repolarization or early afterdepolarization activity.",

The protocol was repeated 60 minutes after initiation of a perfusate containing increasing concentrations of d-sotalol (n = 12, 10[-6] M, 10[-5] M, and 5 x 10[-5] M) and quinidine (n = 8, 10[-6] M and 10[-5] M). Seventeen rabbits were fed with an aqueous solution of amiodarone (50 mg/kg per day over 4 weeks). The data of these experiments (n = 17) were compared with a series of 18 untreated control rabbits. Dispersion of ventricular repolarization was unchanged with the low concentration of d-sotalol (10[-6] M) but was increased-particularly at long CLs-with higher d-sotalol concentrations. With both concentrations of quinidine, dispersion of ventricular repolarization was increased in a rate-independent manner. Amiodarone did not affect dispersion of ventricular repolarization.", 
    "112": "Rate-dependent and concentration-dependent increases in dispersion of ventricular repolarization by d-sotalol and quinidine in this isolated rabbit heart model may help explain their proarrhythmic effects while the absence of an increase in dispersion of ventricular repolarization with amiodarone correlates with its clinically observed lower incidence of proarrhythmia.",

We sought to evaluate the etiology of the long QT syndrome in these patients without previously identified causes for QT, prolongation, and determine the prevalence among patients with HIV infection. The three index patients underwent: (1) left stellate ganglion block; (2) beta-blocker challenge; and (3) electrocardiographic stress testing. QTc interval was measured before and after intervention. We undertook a retrospective analysis of prevalence of QTC prolongation among all patients with computerized ECGs over a 6-month period at one institution and compared it to the prevalence in hospitalized patients with HIV disease. Thirty-four thousand one hundred eighty-one patients with computerized ECGs were screened for QTc prolongation. Forty-two hospitalized patients with HI disease had computerized ECG during the same 6-month period. In the three index patients, the QTc failed to shorten with left stellate ganglion blockade, beta-blocker challenge, or stress testing, suggesting an acquired form of the long QT syndrome in these patients with HIV disease. None had previously recognized acquired causes of QT, prolongation. Mexiletine hydrochloride was useful in preventing recurrences of torsades de pointes. We observed a 7.0% prevalence of QT, prolongation among all patients screened. Hospitalized patients with HIV disease (n = 42) during this same period, demonstrated an increased prevalence of QT, prolongation (28.6%, P = 0.002). Patients with HIV disease have a significantly higher prevalence of QTc prolongation than a general hospital-based population, may have an unrecognized acquired form of the long QT syndrome, and are at risk for torsades de pointes.", 
    "120": "Occasionally, the cardioinhibitory response may be profound during tilt induced syncope. Whether this response is associated with more severe symptoms or predicts a poor response to pharmacotherapy remains controversial. The aim of this study was to characterize patients with vasovagally mediated asystole occurring during head-up tilt test and to evaluate the respective interests of sequential pacing and beta-blockers to treat them. We performed 60 degree tilt testing in 179 consecutive patients with unexplained syncope (91 women and 88 men, age 36.6 +/- 20.1 years). Asystole was defined as a ventricular pause > 5 seconds. All patients with tilt induced asystole received therapy with either beta-blockers or sequential pacing, the efficacy of which was evaluated with serial tilt tests. Of 77 patients with positive tilt test, 10 developed syncope related to asystole (mean duration 11.9 +/- 4.9 s), 2 with spontaneous recovery, and 8 with seizures needing a brief cardiopulmonary resuscitation. When compared with patients without asystole, asystolic patients had more severe symptoms (seizures: 6/10 vs 9/67, P = 0.05, injury 9/10 vs 27/67, P = 0.0048). In the first six patients in whom cardiac pacing was considered, syncope or presyncope still occurred despite atrioventricular pacing at 45 beats/min. Five of these 6 patients, as well as the remaining 4 asystolic patients, were tilted with beta-blockers: 3 patients became tilt-negative; 3 were significantly improved; and 3 did not respond. During follow-up (mean 22.7 +/- 11.7 months) with every patient taking beta-blockers and seven having a permanent pacemaker, no syncopal recurrence was observed. Tilt-induced asystole that may require resuscitative maneuvers occurs especially in patients with a history of seizures or injury. Therapy with beta-blockers in often effective to prevent induction of syncope as well as recurrences.", 
    "121": "Insulin initiates its metabolic and growth-promoting effects by binding to the alpha subunit of its receptor, thereby activating the kinase in the beta subunit. This event leads to tyrosyl phosphorylation of its cytosolic substrate, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), which in turn associates with and activates phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. The clinical use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with increased insulin sensitivity. However, the exact molecular mechanism is unknown. In the present study, we examined the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and IRS-1, as well as the association between IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase in the liver and muscle of 20-month-old rats treated acutely with captopril, using immunoprecipitation with antipeptide antibodies to the insulin receptor and IRS-1, and immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine and anti-PI 3-kinase antibodies. Insulin stimulation increased receptor autophosphorylation to 462 +/- 253% (P < 0.05) in the liver and 697 +/- 78% (P < 0.001) in the muscle of ACE inhibitor-treated rats. There were also increases to 250 +/- 17% (P < 0.001) and 280 +/- 50% (P < 0.05) in the insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation levels in the liver and muscle, respectively, of animals treated with captopril. The insulin-stimulated IRS-1 association with PI 3-kinase rose to 305 +/- 20% (P < 0.001) in liver and 267 +/- 48% (P < 0.05) in muscle. Losartan, an ANG receptor blocker, had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation in both tissues. The acute administration of bradykinin increased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 in the liver and muscle. These data demonstrate that ACE inhibitors modulate the early steps of insulin signaling, and that this effect may be simulated by the administration of bradykinin.",

A pharmacoeconomic analysis of the results of the CIBIS was conducted for the Federal Republic of Germany, and was restricted to direct costs only. The costs of bisoprolol medication and inpatient treatment of heart failure were considered, the latter forming the major part of costs incurred. Per 1000 patient-years, adjuvant bisoprolol therapy resulted in overall cost savings of Deutschmarks (DM)157,272. Statutory Health Insurance had a net saving of DM186,719 in 1000 patient-years, while patients experienced additional net expenses of DM17,760 over 1000 patient-years.

    "130": "To evaluate GH's role in cardiac physiology and its interrelationship with the beta-adrenergic system, we studied GH-deficient dwarf (dw/dw) and control rats in 4 groups of 20 each: dwarf group receiving placebo, dwarf-GH group receiving 2 mg/kg GH, dwarf-GH-propranolol group receiving 2 mg/kg GH and 750 mg/liter propranolol, and a control group of Lewis rats receiving placebo. Dwarf rats showed reduced left ventricular weight and myocyte cross-sectional area, and impaired cardiac performance in vitro. Left ventricular pressure-volume curves showed a shift upward and leftward, indicating reduced distensibility. These abnormalities reversed after GH treatment regardless of concomitant propranolol administration. Although isoproterenol responsiveness was reduced in dwarf rats, there were no differences in beta-adrenergic receptor density, affinity, Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase activity, or adenylyl cyclase activity. In summary, myocyte size, cardiac structure, myocardial contractility, and distensibility are abnormal in GH deficiency. The effects of GH are not mediated by the beta-adrenergic pathway, which, in turn, is unaffected by changes in the GH-insulin-like growth factor I axis. Thus, GH plays a regulatory role in normal cardiac physiology that is independent of the beta-adrenergic system.",

In addition, epitestosterone has been tested as well, with respect to its recently demonstrated inhibitory activity on several other enzymes of androgen biosynthesis. Besides corticosterone, 11 beta-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,17-dione has been used as a substrate. Of all drugs studied, quinapril, dihydralazin, trandolapril, metipamid, methyldopa, betaxolol only appeared to be weak inhibitors of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, with an inhibitory activity 10-28% of that of glycyrrhetinic acid.

Extracellular single unit recordings of dorsal horn neurones were performed in intact urethane-anaesthetized female Sprague-Dawley rats, and the receptive field distally on one hind paw was electrically stimulated with needle electrodes applied to the skin. The 5-HT1B receptor agonist, CP-93,129 (3-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyrid-4-yl)pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrid-5-one), the 5-HT1A/B receptor antagonist cyanopindolol, and the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxypheny])-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride), were applied directly onto the spinal cord, and single unit responses were counted separately for A beta-, A delta-, C-fibre responses and post-discharge according to the latencies. A dual effect of CP-93,129 was observed: 50 nmol CP-93,129 caused a clear inhibition of the A delta-fibre responses, whereas 50 and 150 nmol CP-93,129 produced a dose-dependent increase in post-discharge without affecting A beta- and C-fibre responses. Application of 50 nmol cyanopindolol or 50 nmol WAY 100635 alone did not affect neither the neuronal A-fibre nor the C-fibre responses, but when 50 nmol cyanopindolol was coadministered with 50 nmol CP-93,129 the effect of CP-93,129 alone was blocked: the A delta-fibre response was not inhibited and the post-discharge was not increased. In contrast, 50 nmol WAY100635 did not block the effect of 50 nmol CP-93,129 when the two drugs were coadministered.

In order to test the hypothesis that the functional uncoupling of beta1-adrenoceptors in diseased hamster hearts is due to agonist-dependent desensitization, we investigated the effects of prolonged treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on cardiac beta-adrenergic signaling. Groups of hamsters aged 240 days received either drinking water, or drinking water containing metoprolol (10 or 100 mg/kg/day) or propranolol (4 or 40 mg/kg/day). After 4 weeks' treatment animals were killed and heart ventricles were prepared for determination of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor densities and their functional contribution to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Markers of myocardial hypertrophy, i.e. absolute and relative ventricular weight and 5-nucleotidase activity, were not affected by the different treatment regimens. Neither absolute densities nor relative proportions of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes differed between untreated and treated hamster groups. Metoprolol had no effects on the functional efficacy of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. Hamsters treated with high dose propranolol showed unchanged beta1-adrenoceptor function but reduced beta2-adrenergic stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The findings of the present study demonstrate that the disturbed coupling of cardiac beta1-adrenoceptors to adenylyl cyclase cannot be reversed by in vivo treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and, therefore, is unlikely to be due to agonist-dependent desensitization."
