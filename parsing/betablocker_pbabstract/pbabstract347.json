    "0": "Carvedilol has been shown to determine a significant improvement in left ventricular function, symptoms, clinical course and prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure. However, these results were obtained in medium-term studies of < 1 year duration. We report the results obtained with long-term (3-4 years) carvedilol administration to 40 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who were initially recruited in a 4-month double-blind placebo-controlled trial. In the initial 4-month double-blind trial, 20 patients were randomized to placebo and 20 to carvedilol treatment. All patients, except one who was not on ACE-inhibitors, were on digoxin, furosemide and ACE-inhibitors. Carvedilol or placebo doses were progressively titrated, at weekly intervals, up to the maximal doses of 25 mg bid. After the initial 4-month double-blind phase, all patients were followed long term. Mean follow-up duration was 52 +/- 12 months (range 48-61). Among the 20 patients initially randomized to carvedilol administration, 4 died (3 for cardiac and 1 for extracardiac causes) and 2 underwent heart transplant. Among the 20 patients initially randomized to placebo, 5 died for cardiac causes, 3 underwent heart transplant and 4 were started on carvedilol because of progressive heart failure during the initial 4 months of the study. The remaining 8 patients, who were kept on digoxin, furosemide and ACE-inhibitors, were used as control group. Each patient underwent an assessment of clinical conditions (NYHA functional classification and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire), equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography, and maximal cardiopulmonary bicycle exercise testing. Exams were performed before treatment, after 4 and 12 months, and at the end of the follow-up period. No significant difference between the carvedilol and control group was present at baseline. Compared with baseline, patients in the control group presented a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume after long-term follow-up (from 126 +/- 62 to 138 +/- 43 and 158 +/- 52 ml/m2 after 12 and 48 months, respectively). No significant difference, compared to baseline values, was noted. Patients on carvedilol presented a persistent improvement in left ventricular function. This was shown by the progressive increment in left ventricular ejection fraction from 22 +/- 6 to 34 +/- 11, 37 +/- 11 and 37 +/- 13%, after 4, 12 and 48 months, respectively (p < 0.001) with a concomitant reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume from 147 +/- 54 to 101 +/- 44 ml/m2 at the end of the follow-up (p < 0.05). NYHA functional class remained significantly improved, in comparison with baseline (2.6 +/- 0.5 to 1.9 +/- 0.3, 1.9 +/- 0.8 and 2.0 +/- 1.0 after 4, 12 and 48 months, respectively; p < 0.01). Maximal functional capacity, assessed as peak VO2 was not significantly changed after 4 months (from 15.2 +/- 3.6 to 16.4 +/- 4.0 ml/kg/min) and showed a tendency towards a further improvement after 12 months and at the end of the follow-up (17.3 +/- 5.6 and 17.2 +/- 5.3 ml/kg/min, respectively). These results show that the favorable effects of carvedilol administration on left ventricular function and clinical symptoms are maintained also after long-term treatment.", 
    "1": "The evidence supporting the use of beta-adrenergic blockers in the treatment of heart failure secondary to systolic dysfunction is reviewed. Up to date, seven controlled trials of carvedilol in patients with heart failure have been published. It has been concluded that the use of the non-selective, third generation beta-adrenergic blockers, with alpha-adrenergic (vasodilator) and antioxidant properties, carvedilol, is only justified in patients with mild or moderate heart failure without contraindications to beta-adrenergic blockers. There are not data to support the use of carvedilol in patients with severe or unstable heart failure. It seems logical to wait for the results of the ongoing trials (BEST Trial, CIBIS II Trial, COMET Trial, and MERIT Trial) to more precisely define the role that beta-adrenergic blockers should play in the treatment of patients with heart failure. The information presently available suggests that carvedilol should be considered a therapeutic agent for the prevention of progressive clinical heart failure rather than for the treatment of refractory heart failure.", 
    "2": "Congestive heart failure is an increasing cause of mortality among the aging population. The current management approaches have increased the survival of patients with congestive heart failure, although the mortality rate remains high. Thus, any effort to reduce mortality in this condition seems justified. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have shown to improve functional class and the ventricular function of heart failure patients; the use of these agents should be considered in congestive heart failure patients unless an increase in mortality with betablockers can be demonstrated. In fact, beta-blockers reduce mortality, as the recent study of carvedilol has demonstrated. Therefore, beta adrenergic blocking agents should be incorporated into the strategies of management of patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "3": "Some of the more important advances in slowing progression of renal disease in the past few years include the following: the identification of specific racial groups, such as African-Americans and Mexican-Americans, who are at higher risk for renal disease progression than the general population; the observation that African-Americans may require lower levels of blood pressure reductions (i.e. < 125/75 mmHg) than the general population in order to achieve a similar degree of protection against renal disease progression; the understanding that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the early stages of diabetic renal disease and nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers in those with established renal insufficiency from diabetes slow renal disease progression and reduce proteinuria; and lastly, aggressive blood pressure reduction in dialysis patients is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events.", 
    "4": "L-Deprenyl (selegiline) was chronically administered to male Fischer 344 rats via their drinking water beginning at 54 weeks of age (estimated daily dose: 0.5 mg/kg/day). Beginning at 84 weeks of age, the rats were behaviorally evaluated using a sensorimotor battery, a motor-learning task, and the Morris water maze. At 118 weeks of age, cerebellar noradrenergic function was evaluated in the surviving rats using in vivo electrochemistry. The rats were then sacrificed to measure brain monoamine oxidase activity and perform quantitative autoradiography to evaluate the effect of chronic deprenyl treatment on beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebellum, alpha 2-adrenergic receptors several brain regions, and D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum. Deprenyl treatment reduced brain monoamine oxidase B activity by 85%, but had no effect on brain monoamine oxidase A. A clear effect of chronic deprenyl treatment upon longevity was not observed. Several measures of CNS function were altered in the deprenyl-treated animals: 1) spatial learning in the Morris water maze was improved; 2) electrochemical signals recorded following local application of NE were reduced, and the responsiveness to the reuptake blocker nomifensine was enhanced, in the cerebellum; 3) beta-adrenergic receptor binding affinity was increased in the cerebellum; 4) alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density was increased in the inferior colliculus; and 5) striatal D1 dopamine receptor density was reduced but binding affinity was enhanced. In contrast, chronic deprenyl treatment did not cause changes in: 1) sensorimotor function, as evaluated by balance beam, inclined screen, or wire hang tasks; 2) motor learning; 3) alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density in any region examined except for the inferior colliculus, or binding affinity in any region examined; or 4) striatal D2 dopamine receptor number or affinity. Thus, long-term oral administration of deprenyl extended the functional life span of rats with respect to cognitive, but not motor, performance.", 
    "5": "A self-interpreted control chart, on an individualized basis, assesses the effect of a switch from beta-blockers to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor in a patient with occasional blood pressure (BP) excess. In dense and long data series, the BP and heart rate (HR) of this patient respond to the change in treatment by the test criterion of a self-starting Cumulative Sum (cusum), which reaches values outside a decision interval with a lowering of BP and an increase in HR and vice versa, at least for BP, after treatment cessation. Thereafter, minimal sampling requirements are sought in the same data by applying the same control chart approach to decimated data. Skeleton sampling schemes in a system of chronobiologic self-analysis and interpretation of manually recorded data obtained at strategically placed times (established on the basis of data decimations) could complement control charts that are used on a home computer or preferably would be built into the output of ambulatory monitors used at the outset as a minimum and routinely as an optimum.", 
    "6": "Whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) is a well-described investigational adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced malignancies. The hemodynamic consequences of this physiologic state may include tachycardia, which can produce acute myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. Ischemic heart disease is currently considered a contraindication to WBH. We chose to investigate the consequences of using a new beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, esmolol, to attempt to control the tachycardia associated with WBH. After institutional approval and patient consent, nine consecutive patients with normal cardiac function presenting for WBH with carboplatin infusion were studied. Along with standard monitors, radial arterial and oximetric thermodilution pulmonary artery catheters were placed. Patients were sedated and heated in a radiant warmer (Enthermics). Spontaneous ventilation was maintained and hemodynamic data were gathered at 37 degrees C, and at 41.8 degrees C (before, during and after esmolol infusion). Heart rate and cardiac output increased (by 46% (p = 0.001) and 35% (p = 0.04) respectively) while mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance fell (by 18% (p = 0.02) and 44% (p = 0.006) respectively) during hyperthermia. Heart rate was significantly reduced during esmolol administration (mean dose 180 micrograms/kg/min) in the absence of changes in cardiac index and calculated oxygen delivery. Ventricular filling pressures and stroke work were unchanged. No heart failure, pulmonary edema, or other adverse event was observed. Hemodynamic changes seen during esmolol administration were completely reversed 15 min after the infusion was stopped. We conclude that the administration of moderate doses of esmolol is safe for this population of patients undergoing WBH, and that this technique raises the question of whether patients with ischemic heart disease could safely undergo WBH.", 
    "7": "Carbachol and 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)-adenosine (NECA), stimulants of G protein-coupled receptors, induce MAP kinase activation in the muscarinic ml receptor-transfected mast cell line, RBL-2H3 (ml) cells. The phospholipase C inhibitor neomycin and the phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor propranolol augmented MAP kinase activation induced by carbachol and NECA without affecting the antigen-induced MAP kinase activation. Furthermore, the duration of MAP kinase activation induced by carbachol or NECA was also prolonged by neomycin and propranolol. The specific protein kinase C inhibitor Ro 31-8425 enhanced the carbachol- or NECA-induced MAP kinase activation. These findings suggest that the MAP kinase activation mediated by the G protein-coupled receptors is negatively regulated by diacylglycerol and activated protein kinase C(s).", 
    "8": "A modified Hummel-Dreyer method was used to study the binding of drugs with serum proteins by high performance capillary electrophoresis. The study was carried out to check the possible interaction between serum proteins and a highly selective beta 2-blocker, ICI 118551 (ICI). To prove the suitability of the method the protein binding of frusemide and ceftriaxone, drugs previously investigated, was also studied. The analyses were carried out by injecting a solution of s alpha(1)-acidic glycoprotein (alpha(1)-AGP) or human serum albumin in 70 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4(pH 7.4) buffer into an uncoated fused silica capillary filled with the same buffer. In the capillary, maintained at a working temperature of 35 degrees C, a known amount of the ICI, frusemide or ceftriaxone was added. The method allows the bound drug to be determined directly.", 
    "9": "We studied the effects of common antihypertensive regimens on autonomic cardiovascular control. We considered calcium channel antagonists (nicardipine twice a day and isradipine once a day, respectively) and also examined, as reference treatments, once-a-day atenolol and cilazapril. A noninvasive evaluation of autonomic cardiovascular profile was obtained with spectral analysis of RR interval and systolic arterial pressure variability. We studied moderate essential hypertensives before and after 2 weeks of treatment, both at rest and during active standing and mental arithmetic. All treatments reduced arterial pressure equally well; however, marked differences in spectral profiles were observed. The low-frequency spectral component of RR interval variability [in normalized units, marker of sympathetic modulation of the sinoatrial (SA) node] tended to be greater at rest and during stimuli (p < 0.001) in subjects treated with dihydropyridines. No differences at rest, but striking increases of the low-frequency component of systolic arterial pressure variability were observed in nicardipine-treated patients during both standardized excitatory stimuli, suggesting a marked increase in sympathetic vasomotor drive. As to reference treatments, patients treated with atenolol displayed the lowest values, and patients treated with cilazapril (for 4 weeks) provided intermediate values. In conclusion, shorter acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists may induce an exaggerated increase in sympathetic vasomotor drive during standardized laboratory stressors.", 
    "10": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of drugs according to the initial ambulatory blood pressure (BP) level. After a 15-day placebo run-in period, 105 patients with moderate essential hypertension (mean age, 52 years) underwent 24-h BP monitoring (spacelabs: 1 measure/15 min). Patients were subdivided into two groups: the \"High\" group, with 24-h mean values of systolic BP (SBP) > 137 or diastolic BP (DBP) > 87 mm Hg, and the \"Low\" group, with SBP < or = 137 and DBP < or = 87 mm Hg. All patients received, in a random and double-blind design, either bisoprolol (10 mg q.d.) or lisinopril (20 mg q.d.) for 8 weeks. At the end of this active treatment period, office and ambulatory BP measurements were performed. Casual measurements revealed similar BP decreases in all subgroups receiving bisoprolol and lisinopril; BP monitoring showed that the antihypertensive effect depended on the baseline mean 24-h value; -15/-12 mm Hg for bisoprolol and -18/-13 mm Hg for lisinopril in the High group; -7/-6 mm Hg for bisoprolol and -6/-6 mm Hg for lisinopril in the Low group. This study shows that the antihypertensive effect depended on initial ambulatory BP values, with a lower BP decrease in the Low group. Assessment of the antihypertensive effect on ambulatory BP is useful in clinical trials.", 
    "11": "The effects of tilisolol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, on transmembrane ionic currents were studied in single guinea pig ventricular myocytes by using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique. In the absence of beta-adrenergic stimulation, 10 microM tilisolol, a concentration higher than that used in the clinical therapeutic regimen, did not affect the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa), the inwardly rectifying K+ current (IK1), or the delayed rectifying K+ current (IK). In addition, it did not induce currents through the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels. However, under the nonselective beta-adrenergic stimulation with 1 microM isoproterenol, 1 microM tilisolol almost completely reversed the agonist-induced increase of IK. The increase of ICa by isoproterenol was blocked only by approximately 30% with tilisolol. We concluded that, at therapeutic concentrations (0.01-0.15 microM), tilisolol is a pure beta-adrenoceptor antagonist that has no direct effects on the transmembrane ionic currents of mammalian ventricular myocytes, such as ICa, IK1, or IK. Comparison of the dose-dependent effects of tilisolol on ICa and IK suggested that tilisolol may selectively inhibit catecholamine-induced increase of IK at the therapeutic concentrations. The virtually selective inhibition of IK, leaving ICa intact, may be favorable to prevent the catecholamine-induced arrhythmia without inhibiting contraction.", 
    "12": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether functional alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors exist on capillaries of rat skeletal muscle, and further to determine which subtype of these receptors predominates on these capillaries. Using intravital video microscopy, we measured red blood cell velocity (VRBC) responses in capillaries of rat extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) following a local application of these agonists: norepinephrine (NE; alpha 1, alpha 2; 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-3) M), phenylephrine (PE; alpha 1; 3 x 10(-4) to 10(-2) M), clonidine (CLO; alpha 2; 3 x 10(-3) to 10(-2) M), UK14304 (alpha 2; 3 x 10(-4) to 10(-2) M), and isoproterenol (IPR; beta 1, beta 2; 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-3) M). Responses to NE (10(-5) M) were also measured after a local pretreatment with prazosin (alpha 1 antagonist; 10(-5) to 10(-3) M) and rauwolscine (alpha 2 antagonist; 3 x 10(-4) to 3 x 10(-2) M), while responses to IPR (10(-5) M) were measured after local atenolol (ATE; beta 1 antagonist; 10(-3) to 10(-2) M) and butoxamine (BUT; beta 2 antagonist; 10(-3) to 10(-2) M) pretreatment. The overall control VRBC was 226 microns/sec. NE, PE, CLO, and UK14304 resulted in concentration-dependent decreases of VRBC (from -12 to -89%) from the control level, while IPR caused concentration-dependent increases (17 to 174%). PE reduced VRBC to a larger degree than CLO and UK14304. NE-induced VRBC responses tended to be attenuated more by prazosin than by rauwolscine. Both ATE (10(-2) M) and BUT (10(-3) and 10(-2) M) alone decreased VRBC. However, only ATE significantly attenuated the IPR-induced VRBC responses. These results suggest that the capillary of rat EDL muscle has alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. From the two alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes, the capillary may be predominated by the alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "13": "Despite advances in medical treatment, the annual mortality associated with severe heart failure remains over 40%, and even in mild heart failure the associated mortality is 40% over 4 years. Once it has been demonstrated that the morbidity and mortality to heart failure can be adequately addressed by combinations of drug therapy, then it is logical to attempt to strip out redundant components of these therapeutic regimes. In the meantime, however, combination therapy is required to counter many of the pathophysiological facets of the heart failure syndrome, including fluid retention, neuroendocrine activation, progressive ventricular dysfunction, and sudden cardiac death. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors are well-established drug treatments. Digoxin appears to lessen the rate of progression of heart failure without altering survival. New evidence suggests that beta-blockers may be useful additions to the heart failure therapeutic armamentarium, although whether all beta-blockers are equally effective remains to be established.", 
    "14": "The left-ventricular (LV) functional, hemodynamic, and antiadrenergic effects of metoprolol, bucindolol, and carvedilol have been compared in three concurrent placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with symptomatic idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. All three drugs were well tolerated, all produced at least moderate degrees of beta-blockade as assessed by reduction in exercise heart rate, and all increased the left-ventricular ejection fraction. Compared with the beta 1-selective, second-generation compound metoprolol, the third-generation compounds bucindolol and carvedilol lowered indices of adrenergic activity and tended to improve LV function to a greater extent. In patients with chronic heart failure there may be important therapeutic response differences between second- and third-generation beta-blocking agents.", 
    "15": "ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality of patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but their application to clinical practice in this situation is still limited. In part, the failure to prescribe an ACE inhibitor to a patient with left ventricular systolic dysfunction is due to perceptions regarding their side effects, such as cough and renal dysfunction. Relatively few patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and a serum creatinine > or = 2 mg/dl receive an ACE inhibitor in clinical practice. In this situation one should consider an agent such as fosinopril, which is metabolized by the liver as well as secreted by the kidney. In patients with moderate renal dysfunction, fosinopril has been well tolerated without an increase in serum creatinine. In patients who develop cough due to an ACE inhibitor, consideration should be given to an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocking agent, such as losartan. The relative safety and efficacy of an ACE inhibitor compared with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocking agent is being explored in a prospective randomized trial (Evaluation of Losartan In The Elderly [ELITE]), as well as the safety and pharmacological effectiveness of adding an angiotensin II receptor antagonist to an ACE inhibitor (Randomized Angiotensin receptor antagonists-ACE-inhibitor Study [RAAS]). There may also be a role for the combination of an aldosterone receptor antagonists and an ACE inhibitor in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Once an ACE inhibitor is administered to a patient with left ventricular systolic dysfunction it should be continued indefinitely. ACE inhibitors may be of value not only in preventing the progression of heart failure but also in reversing endothelial dysfunction and preventing the development of atherosclerosis and its consequences, such as myocardial infarction.", 
    "16": "Carvedilol is a novel, multiple-action cardiovascular drug that is currently approved in many countries for the treatment of hypertension. The reduction in blood pressure produced by carvedilol results primarily from beta-adrenoceptor blockade and vasodilation, the latter resulting from alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. These actions, as well as several of the other activities of carvedilol, are associated with cardioprotection in animal models that occurs to a degree that is greater than that observed with other drugs. The multiple actions of carvedilol may also provide the underlying rationale for the use of the drug in the treatment of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. By virtue of being both a beta-blocker and a vasodilator, carvedilol significantly decreases myocardial work by reducing all three components of myocardial oxygen demand, namely, heart rate, contractility, and wall tension. The vasodilatory effects of carvedilol reduce afterload, and the resulting decrease in impedance to left ventricular ejection offsets the negative inotropic effect that would normally result from beta-blockade. As a consequence, stroke volume and cardiac output are maintained or even increased in animals and in patients with congestive heart failure who are treated with carvedilol. Carvedilol and several of its metabolites are potent antioxidants, and this activity may account, in part, for the cardioprotective effects of the drug observed in animal models of acute myocardial ischemia and, in theory, could also serve to protect the myocardium of patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure, in which oxidative stress is now recognized to occur. The antioxidant effects of carvedilol may both inhibit the direct cytotoxic actions of reactive oxygen radicals and prevent oxygen-radical induced activation of transcription factors and genes associated with inflammatory and remodeling processes. Accordingly, carvedilol inhibits the gene expression of the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), an adhesion molecule for polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which typically infiltrate the myocardium under conditions of ischemia and may exacerbate ischemic injury. The antioxidant activity of carvedilol has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in vitro, thereby preventing the formation of this cytotoxic and atherogenic form of LDL. It follows, therefore, that in animal models of hyperlipidemia, carvedilol attenuates aortic lipid accumulation and decreases the aortic content of monocytes and foam cells, and at the same time it has been shown to preserve endothelial integrity and function. These actions of carvedilol are not shared by other beta-blockers or by other drugs currently used in the management of hypertension, coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure. The multiple actions of carvedilol may provide the underlying pharmacologic rationale for the use of this drug in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure, and these actions may account, at least in part, for the reduction in mortality produced by carvedilol in clinical trials involving patients with congestive heart failure. Likewise, these actions of carvedilol may also provide protection, beyond that afforded from reduction in blood pressure, against secondary organ damage in hypertensive patients treated with the drug.", 
    "17": "Since the development of beta-adrenergic blocking agents over 30 years ago, they have been established as an important therapeutic modality in the treatment of coronary heart disease. This article reviews the role of beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension, angina, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure. A number of multicenter studies indicate that beta-blockers have an important effect in decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension and appear to have a relatively increased importance in elderly patients with hypertension. Although their long-term effects on the mortality of angina pectoris have not been fully investigated, investigations indicate that, compared with other drugs, beta-adrenergic blocking agents significantly decrease the frequency and duration of angina pectoris. The largest use of these drugs has been examined in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Two major trials, the Norwegian Timolol Trial and the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial, confirm the long-term benefit in patients following acute myocardial infarction. Their use in heart failure is under close investigation following a series of preliminary studies suggesting they may decrease mortality risk. Although the tolerability of these drugs has been questioned, careful examination of clinical trials indicate that they are relatively well tolerated. These observations emphasize the importance of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in hypertension, angina, and acute myocardial infarction and speak to a wider clinical use of these drugs.", 
    "18": "The effects of 10 weeks of treatment with atenolol (n = 9) or the converting enzyme inhibitor zofenopril (n = 25) on plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were studied in 34 essential hypertensive patients. After 4 weeks on placebo, pretreatment ANP, 56 +/- 7 pg/ml, was slightly but not significantly higher than that of 29 controls (41 +/- 4) and correlated with age (r = 0.44), ECG score for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (r = 0.51) and serum creatinine (r = 0.67), and negatively with creatinine clearance (r = -0.39). Atenolol reduced blood pressure (BP) by 0 +/- 6/8 +/- 2 mm Hg (ns/P < 0.01), and zofenopril by 14 +/- 4/6 +/- 2 (P < 0.01/P < 0.01), not significantly different between the two agents. Heart rate was decreased by atenolol (-16 +/- 4 bpm, P < 0.01) but not by zofenopril (+1 +/- 2 bpm, ns). Atenolol increased ANP in all patients but one (delta = +42 +/- 9 pg/ml, P < 0.01), while zofenopril did not change it significantly (-6 +/- 6 pg/ml), due to 15 patients exhibiting decreases and 10 increases in plasma ANP. The effect of atenolol on ANP positively correlated with duration of hypertension (r = 0.74), ECG score for LVH (r = 0.73) and serum creatinine (r = 0.68). Individual changes in ANP by zofenopril negatively correlated with pretreatment ANP (r = -0.69), ECG score for LVH (r = -0.44) and serum creatinine (r = -0.41). No correlations were found between BP, heart rate or their changes by treatment and the effect of either agent on plasma ANP. Multiple linear regression showed that the change in ANP was explained by the therapeutic agent used, the pretreatment plasma level of ANP, and the ECG score for LVH (F = 12.5, P < 0.001, r2 = 0.56). We conclude that the effect of antihypertensives on plasma ANP is independent of their action on BP, but dependent on an interaction between the type of drug employed and those clinical characteristics of the patient that reflect pre-existing hypertensive target organ damage.", 
    "19": "The effects of the sympathetic nervous system on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) have been reported variably. We studied the effects of adrenergic receptor blockade and epidural blockade on HPV in 32 pentobarbital-anaesthetised intact dogs.", 
    "20": "Pulmonary arterial flow-pressure relationships were determined in hyperoxia and hypoxia, at baseline and after alpha-blockade (phentolamine 2 mg/kg + 50 micrograms.kg-1.-1), beta-blockade (propranolol 2 mg/kg), alpha beta-blockade, epidural blockade (lignocaine 20 mg/kg), and alpha beta-plus epidural blockade.", 
    "21": "At reference flow of 3.5 1.min-1.m-2, the mean hypoxic response (hypoxia-induced increase in transpulmonary pressure gradient, each n = 8) changed from 6.0 +/- 0.9 to 3.5 +/- 1.0 mmHg after alpha-blockade, from 5.8 +/- 0.9 to 0.7 mmHg after beta-blockade, from 4.1 +/- 0.8 to 0.9 +/- 1.4 mmHg after alpha beta-blockade from 3.4 +/- 1.0 to 4.3 +/- 0.9 mmHg after epidural blockade (all P < 0.05), and was not affected by epidural blockade after alpha beta-blockade.", 
    "22": "In pentobarbital-anaesthetised dogs, (1) HPV is attenuated by alpha- and enhanced by beta-, alpha beta- and epidural blockade, and (2) epidural blockade has no significant adrenergic-unrelated effect on the pulmonary vasculature.", 
    "23": "It is known that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of akathisia, one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment. Neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, a model of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects, was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic-induced akathisia in humans, although neuroleptic-induced catalepsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Therefore, the effects of carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and biperiden, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Carteolol, as well as propranolol and biperiden, inhibited the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The inhibitory effect of carteolol was almost comparable to that of propranolol, but was weaker than that of biperiden. Carteolol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in rats. Carteolol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine-induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats. In addition, carteolol did not evoke 5-HT1A receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitch in rats. Finally, carteolol did not inhibit physostigmine-induced lethality in rats. These results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol-induced catalepsy via its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of akathisia without attenuating neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonistic activity.", 
    "24": "The primary goal of this study was to compare the effects of isoproterenol which stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors and forskolin, and NKH 477, a water soluble derivative of forskolin, which stimulate adenylyl cyclase in stunned myocardium of conscious pigs, previously instrumented for measurements of left ventricular pressure and dP/dt, arterial pressure, and wall thickening. Ten min of coronary artery occlusion induced transmural reductions in blood flow (radioactive microspheres) in subepicardium (-98 +/- 2%) and subendocardium (-99 +/- 1%). Wall thickening (piezoelectric crystals) fell from 2.50 +/- 0.26 mm to -0.26 +/- 0.26 mm and remained depressed at 1.37 +/- 0.19 mm after 20-30 min coronary artery reperfusion, reflecting myocardial stunning. At that time, isoproterenol (0.2 microgram/kg) increased wall thickening in stunned myocardium (+1.40 +/- 0.16 mm, P < 0.05) more than in control (+0.71 +/- 0.22 mm), while forskolin elicited the opposite effects. NKH 477 (30 micrograms/kg), which does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, increased systolic wall thickening similarly before (+0.95 +/- 0.25 mm) and during (+1.01 +/- 0.24 mm) myocardial stunning. The reflex inotropic responses to inferior vena caval occlusion on wall thickening were diminished, P < 0.05, in the stunned myocardium (+0.53 +/- 0.05 mm) compared with control (+0.95 +/- 0.07 mm). beta-adrenergic receptor density, which was quantitated with 125I-cyanopindolol binding, was increased transmurally in stunned myocardium compared with non-ischemic myocardium (subepicardium: +23 +/- 5%, subendocardium: +34 +/- 13%, P < 0.05). Basal and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were decreased slightly, but significantly, in the stunned subendocardium but not in the subepicardium, while isoproterenol stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity showed no differences. In summary, paradoxical responses to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation were observed in stunned myocardium, with pharmacological stimulation with isoproterenol evoking enhanced responses, and neural stimulation with inferior vena caval occlusion eliciting depressed responses. The diminished responses to forskolin in vivo, in stunned myocardium were out of proportion to the biochemical measurements, and may be attributed to neurally mediated cardiac effects of forskolin, since the responses to direct stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by NKH 477 were preserved.", 
    "25": "The present study was designed in order to investigate more precisely the role of calcium homeostasis maintenance in protein kinase C (PKC) mediated preconditioning. We used a 15 min pre-incubation period, with 1 mumol/l exogenous norepinephrine (NE) to pharmacologically precondition isolated, superfused rat trabeculae against contractile dysfunctioning following 120 min of metabolic inhibition (MI, in 2 mmol/l CN- containing Tyrode without glucose at 1 Hz stimulation frequency). Contractile recovery was studied during a subsequent 60 min recovery period (RP, in glucose containing Tyrode at 0.2 Hz). Tyrode was gassed with 95%, O2/ 5% CO2 and kept at a constant temperature of 24 degrees C. Force and intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) were monitored throughout the experimental protocol; [Ca2+]i was measured using fura-2. Pretreatment with NE (group NE-I) significantly increased the fraction of trabeculae that resumed to contract during RP, from 36 +/- 13% (mean +/- S.E.M.) in controls to 82 +/- 10% (P < 0.05). In correspondence with this, NE-pretreatment increased the proportion of trabeculae in which the Ca2+ rise from the onset of rigor development during MI was attenuated. After 40 min of MI [Ca2+]i in the failing control, as well as failing group NE-I, trabeculae (1.08 +/- 0.20 and 1.51 +/- 0.26 mumol/l, respectively) was increased significantly compared to the mean value registered in the recovering preparations of these groups (0.34 +/- 0.04 mumol/l: P < 0.05). Specific inhibition of PKC with 2 mumol/l chelerythrine (group NE-IV) almost completely blocked the protection induced by NE-pretreatment, including its protective action against Ca2+ overload, i.e. the fraction of trabeculae that resumed to contract during RP returned to untreated control level (46 +/- 11%: P < 0.05 v group NE-I). Also in this case [Ca2+]i in the failing group NE-IV trabeculae after 40 min of MI was increased substantially, compared to the value measured in the recovering preparations (4.75 +/- 1.00 and 0.60 +/- 0.08 mumol/ l, respectively). The relative importance of both alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptor pathways in this preconditioning-like effect of NE-pretreatment, was investigated using specific blockers. The results point to an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mediated signaling mechanism, which enhances PKC-dependent control of [Ca2+]i from the onset of rigor development during MI.",

    "31": "We have investigated opioid mechanisms concerning regulation of urine production in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON). In this study, the effect of [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a potent selective mu-opioid agonist, microinjected into the SON of anesthetized hydrated rats, on the urine outflow rate was examined. DAMGO caused a dose-dependent decrease in the urine outflow rate with no significant changes in blood pressure nor heart rate. The ED50 value for the antidiuresis was calculated to be 0.055 nmol from the dose-response curve. The antidiuresis elicited by DAMGO (0.1 nmol) was partially inhibited by intra-SON pre-injection of naloxone (3 nmol), a relatively mu-selective opioid antagonist, and timolol (100 nmol), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not by intra-SON pre-injection of phenoxybenzamine (20 nmol), an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, nor atropine (300 nmol), a muscarinic antagonist. Intravenous injection of d(CH2)5-D-Tyr(Et)VAVP (16.7 micrograms), a vasopressin receptor antagonist, did not influence the DAMGO-induced antidiuresis. These findings suggest that antidiuresis mediated through mu-opioid receptors in the SON involves beta-adrenoceptors in the nuclei, but does not involve an increase in vasopressin release.", 
    "32": "In the present study the influence of dietary salt on the cardiovascular and renal effects of the calcium channel blocker felodipine (1.2 mg/kg sc) and the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking drug metoprolol (250 mg/kg po), alone and in combination, was examined in the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) in a 4-week study. In addition, the influence of different diet and drug regimens on vascular functions was assessed by measuring the vascular relaxation and contractile responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro at the end of the experimental period. In SHRs, a high-salt diet caused a marked rise in blood pressure, impaired the endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation responses to acetylcholine and induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and renal hypertrophy. Metoprolol had little if any effect on salt-induced changes in blood pressure, endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation or renal hypertrophy, but it partially prevented the development of salt-induced LVH. Felodipine during the high-salt diet lowered blood pressure to normotensive level and completely prevented salt-induced left ventricular and renal hypertrophy as well as endothelial dysfunction. Felodipine produced tachycardia, especially at the beginning of drug treatment. The combination of felodipine and metoprolol abolished the effects of the individual drugs on heart rate. The drug combination also completely prevented the detrimental cardiovascular and renal effects induced by a high salt intake. Although salt restriction did not further enhance the profound antihypertensive effect of the combination of metoprolol and felodipine, it enhanced the effects of the drug combination on LVH and renal hypertrophy. Our findings indicate that felodipine treatment, alone and in combination with metoprolol, normalizes blood pressure and prevents the development of salt-induced LVH and renal hypertrophy. During the high-salt diet the beneficial vascular effects of felodipine as well as those of the combination of felodipine and metoprolol are mediated, at least in part, by prevention of salt-induced endothelial dysfunction. The only apparent benefit from the use of metoprolol in combination with a relatively high dose of felodipine was the prevention of tachycardia.", 
    "33": "Selective 5HT1a agonist binding to membranes from rabbit cerebral cortex was concentration-dependent and saturable; the Kd was 1.1 nM and Bmax of 480 fmols/mg protein. Scatchard as well as Hill plots were linear; the Hill coefficient was 0.96, suggesting a single, non-interacting binding site. Agonist binding was inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by gamma S GTP, a result consistent with the coupling of this binding site to the G protein signal transduction system. In competition experiments involving agonist and a series of agents with known affinities and specificities at 5HT1a receptors, a rank order relationship was found consistent with this binding site being a 5HT1a binding site. Direct comparisons of agonist and antagonist binding at rat cerebral cortex 5HT1a receptors and cloned human 5HT1a receptors also suggested that the rabbit binding site belongs to the 5HT1a class. The only rank order anomalies were with methiothepin in rabbit cerebral cortex, where a comparatively high Ki was observed and with buspirone in cloned human 5HT1a receptor, where a low Ki was determined; these anomalies bear further study in light of the comparative pharmacology of 5HT1a receptors. Finally, the natural product parthenolide was tested for affinity in the rabbit, rat, and human systems, where it uniformly was unable to displace agonist, suggesting that the 5HT1a receptor is not a target for this compound. Overall, these results suggest that a functional 5HT1a receptor exists in rabbit cerebral cortex.", 
    "34": "1. Two new milrinone analogs, 3-acetyl-6-phenyl-2(1H)-pyridone (SF 348) and 3-acetyl-7-methyl-7,8-dihydro-2,5(1H, 6H) quinolinone (SF 349), increase the contractile activity of spontaneously beating and electrically driven atria isolated from reserpine-treated guinea-pigs. 2. Propranolol 0.1 microM drastically inhibits the contractile effect of SF 348, whereas that of SF 349 is unaffected. Preincubation of the atria with adenosine-deaminase suppresses the cardiac activity of SF 349, but does not affect that of SF 348. 3. SF 349 competitively antagonizes the negative inotropic effect induced by N6-(R-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine (R-PIA) and displaces N6-cyclohexyl[3H]-adenosine (3H-CHA) from its binding sites to A1 receptors in the guinea-pig heart. 4. The positive inotropic effect of SF 348 is largely sustained by activation of beta-adrenoceptors, whereas SF 349 acts by displacing endogenous adenosine from its inhibitory (A1) receptors in the atria.", 
    "35": "Renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured during waterloading and constant infusion of [131I]hippuran and [125I]iothalamate in 24 mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients before and after 3.5 months treatment with atenolol. Clearances of sodium and potassium were measured 2-3 hours post-dosing and renal vascular resistance (RVR) and filtration fraction (FF) were calculated. Measurement of clearance of lithium (CLi) and uric acid (Curic acid) was employed to investigate specifically proximal tubular function. Beta-blockade with atenolol produced a borderline significant decrement in RPF but no change in GFR, RVR and FF. There was a significant reduction in CLi, fractional proximal escape of sodium and water, Curic acid and an increase in absolute proximal reabsorption of sodium, indicating an inhibition of proximal tubular function. The distal tubular parameters exhibited changes tending to normalize excretion of sodium, but not water. Changes in RVR were inversely related to changes in CLi and Curic acid, suggesting unopposed alfa-adrenergic stimulation to be implicated in the renal counterregulation at a proximal tubular site following long-term administration of atenolol in essential hypertension.", 
    "36": "The production of nitric oxide (NO) by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) is stimulated by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). This is enhanced in a dose-dependent manner by ADP, although it alone failed to induce nitrite accumulation. Purine nucleotides and their nonhydrolizable analogues as well as adenosine also exhibit variable enhancing effects. This enhanced nitrite formation was due to induction of the NO synthase (NOS II) gene as judged by Northern hybridization using an NOS II specific probe and by Ca2+ independency of the NOS II activity. 8-(p-Sulfophenyl)-theophylline, a blocker of adenosine receptors, suppressed the enhanced NO production by adenosine and ADP to the level of that with IL-1 beta alone. These data indicate that activation of the adenosine receptor on VSMC may enhance production of NOS II by modulating a signal transducing pathway of IL-1 beta. Although cAMP is a candidate as the second messenger, it was not significantly elevated by either ADP or adenosine treatment in IL-1 beta-stimulated cells. This mechanism might be stimulated under conditions with release of various purine and their derivatives.", 
    "37": "Indirect evidence supporting a solute-coupled liquid absorption from the pleural space of rabbits has recently been provided; moreover, the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline has been found to increase this absorption. In this study the effect of adrenaline and alpha-adrenoceptor agonists on net rate of liquid absorption (Jnet) from albumin Ringer hydrothoraces of various sizes has been determined in anaesthetized rabbits. In hydrothoraces with adrenaline (5 x 10(-6) M) the relationship between Jnet and volume of liquid injected was displaced upwards by 0.09 ml h-1 relative to that in control hydrothoraces (P < 0.01). This displacement did not occur with lower adrenaline concentrations or after pretreatment with the beta-blocker propranolol. Hence, this increase in Jnet is mediated by stimulation of beta-receptors. It seems to be caused by an increase in solute-coupled liquid absorption, since beta-agonists inhibit lymphatic activity while, at relatively high concentrations, they may increase active transport. Conversely, the strong stimulation of lymphatic alpha-receptors that should occur with adrenaline after beta-blockade may fail to increase lymphatic drainage, because it has been shown that the increase in contraction frequency of lymphatics may be balanced by the decrease in their stroke volume. Arterial blood pressure during the hydrothoraces with adrenaline was unchanged. In hydrothoraces with the alpha 2-agonist clonidine (5 x 10(-6) M; a less potent agent than adrenaline) the slope of the relationship between Jnet and volume injected increased by 26% (P < 0.01), while its origin did not change. This increase in slope did not occur with a lower clonidine concentration or after pretreatment with the alpha-blocker phentolamine. Hence, it is caused by stimulation of alpha 2-receptors, which probably lead to an increase in lymphatic drainage related to liquid load. In hydrothoraces with the alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine (5 x 10(-6) or 10(-7) M) Jnet was simlar to control values.", 
    "38": "Adhesion and friction forces are the main physical factors determining the re-suspension of a micronized drug from carrier particles during inhalation. Hence, it appears useful to link adhesion and friction force measurements to the in vitro testing of dry powder inhalations, namely the assessment of the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) using an eight-stage Andersen cascade impactor. Interactive mixtures of micronized Salmeterol Xinafoate adhered to irrespirable lactose monohydrate carrier particles were used as model dosage forms. The adhesion force between the drug and carrier particles was assessed using a centrifuge technique, and the MMAD was determined under standardized working conditions using the Andersen-Cascade impactor (Mark II). A cascade impactor simulator (CIS), which is a computer program containing a re-suspension model to assess the amount of drug detached from the carrier particles during inhalation, was developed and validated using the experimental data. It could be shown, that the CIS provided a good estimate of the loss of drug due to adhesion to the carrier particles and the loss of drug on the cascade impactor walls. Small deviations between the theoretical and experimental mass median aerodynamic particle diameters however were found. These deviations were shown to be mainly due to the experimental error introduced by the cascade impactor, and that the error due to the experimental adhesion measurements is negligibly small. Hence, the CIS developed could be a useful tool in early development stages of dry powder inhalations to predict the in vitro aerodynamic performance of drug particles.", 
    "39": "The effects of lumbar sympathetic nerve stimulation on oxygen uptake (VO2) in curarized muscle of the perfused rat hindlimb were investigated. Stimulation of sympathetic nerves elicited vasoconstriction at all frequencies. Importantly, this was associated with changes in VO2 that were generally stimulatory at low frequencies (0.5-2 Hz) and inhibitory at high frequencies (5-10 Hz). Both the pressor response and the changes in VO2 were almost completely blocked by the alpha 1/alpha 2-blocker phentolamine (1.0 microM) but were not affected by the beta 1/beta 2-blocker DL-propranolol (2.0 microM). The alpha 2-blocker yohimbine (0.1 microM) did not significantly affect either the pressor or VO2 response. The alpha 1-antagonist prazosin (0.1 microM) abolished the vasoconstriction with low-frequency stimulation and inhibited > 90% of the vasoconstriction with high-frequency stimulation. Intra-arterial infusion of phenylephrine (alpha 1-agonist), but not of UK-14304 (alpha 2-agonist), also elicited a similar biphasic response in VO2 during vasoconstriction. The changes in VO2 at both low- and high-frequency stimulation were fully reversed by prazosin. The vasodilator sodium nitroprusside also showed similar effects to prazosin in blocking both VO2 and vasoconstriction. Thus sympathetic control of VO2 in the perfused rat hindlimb appears to be initiated by activation of predominantly vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptors.",

Stimulation was a concentration-dependent process with 50% effective concentrations of 2.7 +/- 1.1 and 3.8 +/- 1.9 nM compared with 209 +/- 71 and 230 +/- 51 nM for isoproterenol, respectively. It was inhibited by selective beta-AR antagonists with the following rank order of potency: SR-59230A 3-(2-ethylphenoxy)1-[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth- 1-ylamino]-(2S)-2-propranol oxalate; beta 3-AR antagonist > ICI-118551[erythro-(+/-)-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3- isopropylaminobutan-2-ol-hydrochloride; beta 2-AR antagonist > CGP-20712A[(+/-)-[2-(3-carbarmoyl-4-hydroxyphenoxy)-et hyl- amino]-3-[4 (1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy]- 2-propranol; beta 1-AR antagonist]. Furthermore, specific binding of 125I-cyanopindolol to the isolated cells was demonstrated and was displaced by the beta-AR antagonists according to the same rank order of potency and with apparent dissociation constants consistent with the 50% inhibitory concentrations for SR-58611A-stimulated somatostatin and gastrin releases. In addition, the presence of beta 3-AR mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. These findings provide the first evidence for a gastric beta 3-AR mediating catecholamine stimulation of gastrin and somatostatin releases from antral cells.", 
    "41": "Isolated guinea pig ileum displayed spontaneous contraction and fluctuation of membrane potential originating from the longitudinal muscle. Transmural stimulation of the enteric nerve plexus evoked contractions that were followed by lowered muscle tone and decreased spontaneous activity. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin, N-type Ca2+ channel blockers omega-conotoxins GVIA and MVIIA, the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine, and inhibitory mediators alpha, beta-methylene-ATP and sodium nitroprusside all inhibited stimulation-evoked contraction while restoring spontaneous motility. L-type Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine and calciseptine completely suppressed evoked and spontaneous contractions. Blockade of the large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ (Kca) channel with charybdotoxin (but not of small-conductance Kca channel by apamin or of ATP-regulated K+ channel by glybenclamide) induced spikelike depolarization, inhibited nerve stimulation-evoked membrane hyperpolarization, and increased spontaneous activity. The results suggest that the large-conductance Kca channel is constitutively activated for modulations of spontaneous activity, and that muscle excitation, through elevation of Ca2+ levels, stimulates the large-conductance Kca channel to suppress spontaneous activity.", 
    "42": "The aim of this study was to determine the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in obligatory and facultative components of the thermogenic response to food (TRF). Nineteen lean, healthy subjects participated in this study, which comprised two protocols, each exploring one component of the ANS. In the first experimental group, propranolol (prime: 80 micrograms/kg; continuous: 1 microgram.kg-1.min-1) was infused intravenously to inhibit sympathetic nervous activity (SNA), whereas in the second group atropine (prime: 5 micrograms/kg; continuous: 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) was used to inhibit parasympathetic nervous activity (PNA). The TRF was measured on four occasions: 1) after oral ingestion of a breakfast, during 0.9% NaCl perfusion, 2) after oral ingestion of the same breakfast, during the perfusion of one of the drugs, 3) after intragastric injection of a pureed form of the same meal as in part 1, during 0.9% NaCl perfusion, and 4) after intragastric feeding, during the administration of one of the drugs. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry for 30 min before and 6 h after ingestion of the meal. Facultative TRF was defined as the difference between oral and intragastric TRF. Intragastric feeding significantly reduced TRF in both studies: 6.6 +/- 1.0 vs. 8.7 +/- 0.8% of the ingested energy in the SNA study and 5.5 +/- 1.6 vs. 7.4 +/- 3.1% in the PNA study. During propranolol infusion, TRF was significantly lower than it was during saline infusion after oral feeding (6.9 +/- 1.0% vs. 8.7 +/- 0.8% of ingested energy) but not after intragastric feeding. During atropine administration, TRF was reduced after both oral and intragastric feeding, although statistical significance was not reached in the latter. Atropine administration decreased gastric emptying (measured with an isotopic method) 2 h postingestion by 50%. These results show that the SNA is necessary for the facultative component of TRF to occur in humans. The role of the PNA appears to be related to its action on gastric emptying.",

The y intercept of 1.7 pg/ml suggested that the nonspecific immunoreactivity was close to 2 pg/ml in samples assayed without the HPLC step. During beta-adrenergic blockade, which predictably suppressed plasma renin levels, highly significantly linear relationships between HPLC and non-HPLC Ang II measurements (y = 1.3x + 1.6; r = 0.93.

This article describes the use of propranolol given for 10 days to burned children to test whether the drug remains effective and safe in reducing heart rate and cardiac work for longer periods. We prospectively studied 22 children, 1 to 10 years of age with burns covering > or = 40% of their total body surface area. These children were treated with 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg propranolol given orally or intravenously every 8 hours for 10 days. In both septic and nonseptic patients, propranolol significantly decreased their daily average heart rate (between 10% and 13%, p < 0.05) and rate-pressure product (between 10% and 16%, p < 0.05) compared with their 24-hour mean before propranolol treatment. No significant change in mean arterial blood pressure, or plasma urea nitrogen creatinine or glucose levels could be shown. No hypotension, hypothermia, azotemia, hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, arrhythmia, bronchospasm, or peripheral ischemia was noted during or after treatment. Whereas propranolol lowered heart rate more per milligram per kilogram body weight when given intravenously, both routes were safe and effective.

    "50": "We used a simple experimental approach to clarify some contradictory predictions of the collision coupling and equilibrium models (e.g. ternary complex, two-state ternary complex or quinternary complex), which describe G-protein-mediated beta-adrenergic receptor signalling in essentially different manners. Analysis of the steady-state coupling of beta-adrenoceptors to adenylate cyclase in turkey erythrocyte membranes showed that: (1) in the absence of an agonist, Gpp(NH)p (a hydrolysis-resistant analogue of GTP) can activate adenylate cyclase very slowly; (2) this activity reaches a steady state in approx. 5 h, the extent of activity depending on the concentration of the nucleotide; (3) isoprenaline-activated steady-state adenylate cyclase can be inactivated by propranolol (a competitive antagonist that relaxes the receptor activation), in the presence of Gpp(NH)p (which provides a virtual absence of GTPase) and millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ (the rate of this inactivation is relatively fast); (4) increasing the concentration of Gpp(NH)p can saturate the steady-state activity of adenylate cyclase. The saturated enzyme activity was lower than that induced by isoprenaline under the same conditions. This additional agonist-induced activation was reversible. In the light of these results, we conclude that agonist can also activate the guanine nucleotide-saturated system in the absence of GTPase by a mechanism other than guanine nucleotide exchange. We explain these phenomena in the framework of a quinternary complex model as an agonist-induced and receptor-mediated dissociation of guanine nucleotide-saturated residual heterotrimer, the equilibrium concentration of which is not necessarily zero. These results, which suggest a continuous interaction between receptor and G-protein, can hardly be accommodated by the collision coupling model that was originally suggested for the present experimental system and then applied to many other G-protein systems. Therefore we attempt to unify the equilibrium and collision coupling approaches to provide a consistent theoretical basis for the G-protein-mediated beta-adrenergic receptor signalling in turkey erythrocyte membranes.",

A database of all primary PTCA procedures was established in February 1, 1994. Continuous quality assurance analysis was performed, and program modifications introduced as needed. Patients were separated into early (group A = February 1, 1994 through January 31, 1995) and late (group B1 = February 1, 1995 through June 31, 1995, and group B2 = July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995) cohorts. Time intervals to certain treatment landmarks were compared among groups. In-hospital outcomes were tabulated. Fifty-two consecutive patients were included (group A = 19, group B1 = 17, group B2 = 16). Time intervals shortened significantly (group A vs group B1 vs group B2) with the time from hospital presentation to first balloon inflation decreasing progressively (from 205 to 119 to 97 minutes; p <0.001). Most of this decrease was obtained by shortening the time from hospital presentation to xylocaine administration (158 to 85 to 72 minutes; p <0.005), although the time from xylocaine to first balloon inflation also decreased (from 47 to 33 to 24 minutes; p <0.005). Parallel decreases for in-hospital mortality (26% vs 0%; p = 0.004), adverse events (47% vs 18%; p = 0.05), and length of hospital stay (13.3 +/- 13.7 vs 8.4 +/- 4.4 days; p = NS) were demonstrated for groups A versus B1 and B2. A learning effect following initiation of a primary PTCA program is demonstrated in which reperfusion was more rapidly achieved as the result of procedural changes directed by quality improvement analysis with a concurrent improvement in in-hospital outcomes.", 
    "57": "Vasodepressor syncope is a common medical problem that can be diagnosed through an accurate history and upright tilt testing. In most cases, patients experience a striking decrease in syncopal episodes following a tilt test, and long-term therapy is not necessary. In the rare patient who experiences no prodrome and continues to experience injury-causing syncope, empiric therapy with drugs or dual-chamber pacing has to be considered despite the lack of controlled trials establishing the efficacy of such therapies.", 
    "58": "There is evidence that ocular blood flow plays a critical role in the clinical course of glaucoma. Hence a reduction in ocular blood flow due to topical antiglaucoma treatment should be avoided. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effect of antiglaucoma drugs on ocular hemodynamics.", 
    "59": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study, we investigated the effects of single topical doses of five beta-blocking agents (befunolol, betaxolol, levobunolol, metipranolol, and timolol), two adrenergic agents (clonidine and dipivefrin [INN, dipivefrine]), and a parasympathomimetic agent (pilocarpine) on ocular and systemic hemodynamics in healthy subjects (n = 10). Fundus pulsation amplitudes in the macula and the optic disc were measured to characterize pulsatile choroidal and optic disc blood flow, respectively. Moreover, central retinal and ophthalmic artery blood flow velocities were measured by Doppler ultrasound.", 
    "60": "Befunolol, metipranolol, timolol, clonidine, and dipivefrin reduced fundus pulsations in the macula and the optic disc (-9% to -14% versus baseline). In contrast, betaxolol, levobunolol, and pilocarpine had no effect on fundus pulsations. Antiglaucoma drugs had no effect on either blood flow velocities in the central retinal or the ophthalmic artery or systemic hemodynamics.", 
    "61": "Our results indicate that befunolol, metipranolol, timolol, clonidine, and dipivefrin reduce choroidal and optic disc blood flow. This could be caused by drug diffusion to the choroid, which may cause vasoconstriction. Ocular blood flow reduction was not observed with betaxolol, levobunolol, or pilocarpine. The lack of effect of all drugs under study on central retinal blood flow velocity might partially be the result of autoregulative mechanisms. Because optic nerve head blood flow likely plays a critical role in the clinical course of glaucoma, the use of antiglaucoma drugs, which reduce blood flow, should be reconsidered.", 
    "62": "Fenspiride is a drug with potential benefits in the treatment of obstructive airways disease. It has antibronchoconstriction and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of this drug on the contractions induced in the guinea-pig isolated main bronchus and perfused lung by electrical field stimulation (EFS) or exogenously added agents. Bronchi were stimulated transmurally in the presence of indomethacin 10(-6) M and propranolol 10(-6) M, and isometric tension was measured. In the perfused lung model calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release was determined in the perfusate fractions as a measure of neuropeptide production. Two successive contractile responses were observed: a rapid cholinergic contraction, followed by a long-lasting contraction due to local release of neuropeptides from C-fibre endings. Fenspiride (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) inhibited the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) component of the contraction of the guinea-pig isolated main bronchus induced by EFS. Fenspiride significantly affected contractions induced by exogenously added substance P or [Nle10]-NKA(4-10) only at concentrations higher than 10(-3) M. In the guinea-pig perfused lung, fenspiride inhibited low pH- but not capsaicin-evoked release of CGRP. At higher concentrations (10(-4) M to 3x10(-4) M) fenspiride exhibited a significant inhibitory effect both on the cholinergic component of contractile response induced by EFS in the guinea-pig isolated main bronchus and on exogenously added acetylcholine. In conclusion, the result of this study suggests that fenspiride, in moderate concentrations, reduces the release of neuropeptides, including tachykinins, from sensory nerve endings at a prejunctional level. At higher concentrations, postjunctional actions on bronchial smooth muscle are also present.", 
    "63": "Local application of nicotine over the surface of the left ventricle and also occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in the lightly anaesthetised, open-chested, artificially ventilated cat resulted a biphasic rectal movement--initial relaxation followed by sustained contraction. However, distension of the atrial appendage did not evoke any change in rectal motility, indicating the non-involvement of atrial volume receptors in initiating this rectal response of cardiac origin. The relaxation phase of this response was not abolished by pretreatment with atropine or with phentolamine or propranolol but was abolished by the nitric oxide inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA), and this blockade of the relaxation phase by LNNA was reversed by L-arginine. The contraction phase, however, was abolished by atropine. From these observations it is clear that the relaxation phase of the rectal response to coronary occlusion or epicardial nicotine is mediated through neither cholinergic nor adrenergic pathways but through the release of nitric oxide whereas the contraction phase of such a cardio-rectal response is mediated through the release of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine.", 
    "64": "Twelve homing pigeons were trained to discriminate the 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) from its vehicle in a fixed ratio (FR) 30 two-key operant drug discrimination procedure. Tests for generalization and antagonism showed that compounds with agonistic action at the 5-HT1A receptor, such as 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin), buspirone and ipsapirone all substituted for the flesinoxan cue. Compounds with mixed agonistic action at the 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor fully (eltoprazine) or partially (RU24969 (5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl-1H-indole)) substituted for flesinoxan. TFMPP (1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine) and mCPP (1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine), both acting at the 5-HT(1B/2C) receptor, did not substitute for flesinoxan, neither did the selective 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine. The results of the antagonism tests showed that the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists NAN-190 (1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine), WAY 100635 ((N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclo-he xane-carboxamide) and the newly developed DU125530 (2-[4-[4-(7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-5-yl)-1-piperazinyl ]butyl]-1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one-1,1-dioxide) fully (more than 80%) blocked the flesinoxan cue without having substantial effects when given alone. WAY100135 (N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl)-2-phenylpropanamide ), (+/-)-pindolol and (S)-UH-301 ((S)-5-fluoro-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)-tetralin) all partially antagonized the flesinoxan cue. However, both WAY100135 as well as (+/-)-pindolol also partially substituted for flesinoxan in generalization tests. NAN190, (S)-UH-301, WAY100635 and DU125530 were without any activity in the generalization test at the doses tested. The putative 5-HT1A receptor antagonist S15535 (4-benzodioxan-5-yl) 1-(indan-2-yl)piperazine) was identified as a full agonist in the present procedure. Taken together these results suggest that the flesinoxan cue in pigeons is mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor and that DU125530 acts as a full antagonist on the 5-HT1A receptor.", 
    "65": "We studied the mechanisms underlying alpha2-adrenergic receptor (AR)-mediated increase in intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) in freshly dispersed myometrial cells from sows in the luteal phase of the estrous cycle. After the blockade of beta-ARs with propranolol, epinephrine increased [Ca2+]i dose-dependently in both the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. The rank order of alpha antagonists in inhibiting [Ca2+]i response to epinephrine was yohimbine > WB4101 > prazosin in both the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+, suggesting that epinephrine acts on alpha(2A)-ARs to increase Ca2+ influx as well as Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Thapsigargin, the blocker of the Ca2+ pump in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, abolished the release but did not affect the influx. Pertussis toxin (PTX) inhibited the influx but failed to change the release. Nimodipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nearly abolished the influx. The peak increase in [Ca2+]i caused by epinephrine was reached within 20 sec of administration. Intracellular cAMP concentrations were also decreased at 20 sec post-epinephrine. Epinephrine enhanced the L-type Ca2+ channel current, whereas forskolin suppressed it. Maximization of intracellular cAMP content by applying 8-bromo-cAMP (100 microM) blocked the effect of epinephrine on the current. U-73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, reduced the Ca2+ release by epinephrine and oxytocin. Our results suggested that 1) activation of alpha2-ARs induces Ca2+ influx through opening L-type Ca2+ channels as well as inducing Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, and 2) a PTX-sensitive G protein couples negatively to adenylyl cyclase, leading to a decrease in cAMP formation which may be involved in the activation of Ca2+ channels. In addition, our results are consistent with the coupling of alpha2-ARs to a PTX-insensitive G protein (G(q)) to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores.", 
    "66": "A severe rest tremor arose in a patient's right arm 9 months after a pontine tegmental hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance studies at 4 and 10 months showed residual hemosiderin in the pons and increasing hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) affecting primarily the left olive. The tremor was refractory to pharmacotherapy (clonazepam, propranolol, and levodopa), but was reduced after implantation of a thalamic stimulator device. Although pontine hemorrhage is among several common causes of HOD, it has not previously been appreciated as a cause of midbrain (\"rubral\") tremor. A disynaptic dentatorubroolivary tract associated with tremor and monosynaptic dentatoolivary tract associated with HOD may both be components of the rubroolivocerebellorubral loop implicated in midbrain tremor. Their proximity makes the combination of tremor and HOD after pontine tegmental damage plausible and even likely.", 
    "67": "The African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension pilot study randomized 94 nondiabetic black men and women (mean age, 53 years; 75% male) with presumed hypertensive nephrosclerosis and a baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 25 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mean, 52.3 mL/min/1.73 m2) to blood pressure control at either a low mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal of < or = 92 mm Hg or a usual MAP goal of 102 to 107 mm Hg and an antihypertensive drug regimen that included either a calcium antagonist (amlodipine), a beta-blocker (atenolol), or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril). After 3 months of follow-up (n = 90), the mean GFR was similar (53.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 v 53.7 mL/min/1.73 m2) to the baseline levels in participants randomized to the low MAP group (n = 44), whereas the mean GFR increased by 3.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 (P = 0.02) in participants randomized to the usual MAP group (n = 46). During the same period of time, the mean GFR increased significantly in participants randomized to the calcium channel blocker regimen (n = 28) (5.7 mL/min/ 1.73 m2; P = 0.01) but not in participants randomized to the beta-blocker regimen (n = 31) (1.7 mL/min/1.73 m2; P = 0.10) or the ACE inhibitor regimen (n = 31) (1.1 mL/min/1.73 m2; P = 0.52). Changes in GFR at 3 months were significantly different among the three treatment groups (P = 0.04). We conclude that the magnitude of short-term effects of blood pressure control and antihypertensive drug regimens on GFR should be considered when estimating sample size for clinical trials designed to evaluate the effects of these interventions on long-term changes in GFR slope.", 
    "68": "Calcium antagonists and beta-blockers may retard or inhibit atherogenesis. In the absence of data pertaining to the potential cardioprotective action of an association of such agents, we have investigated the impact of nifedipine and atenolol, alone or in combination, on the capacity of monocyte-macrophages (ex vivo) and copper ions (in vitro) to oxidize LDL and on intracellular metabolism and efflux of free and esterified forms of cholesterol in human macrophages and foam cells. At concentrations up to 100 micromol/L, atenolol had no effect on the oxidative resistance of LDL; on the contrary, nifedipine displayed a significant dose-dependent capacity to protect LDL during copper-mediated oxidation (100 micromol/L; P<.001). Using a DPPH radical generating system, nifedipine was shown to exert free radical-trapping activity (molar ratio of scavenging activity, nifedipine:alpha-tocopherol, 1:114). The addition of atenolol to nifedipine was without effect on the antioxidant activity of the calcium antagonist. In experiments in which oxidative modification was mediated by monocyte-macrophages, nifedipine but not atenolol conserved its antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that association of atenolol with nifedipine did not modify the antioxidant properties of nifedipine itself. Using a human monocyte-derived macrophage culture system, nifedipine, atenolol, or a combination of the two drugs was ineffective in inhibiting foam cell formation induced by acetylated LDL or oxidized LDL. However, atenolol (100 micromol/L) increased cellular accumulation of cholesteryl ester (+17%; P<.05), whereas nifedipine (100 micromol/L) decreased total cholesterol (-37.4%; P<.05) accumulation induced by acetylated LDL in the mouse macrophage cell line J774. A combination of the two drugs neutralized these antagonistic effects. None of these results were reproduced during the oxidized LDL-induced transformation of murine J774 cells into foam cells. Furthermore, cholesterol efflux from preloaded human macrophages was equally unaffected by the addition of the drugs alone or in combination. It therefore seems unlikely that the beneficial effect of atenolol on coronary heart disease is mediated by changes in either LDL oxidizability or cholesterol metabolism in human macrophages and foam cells. Our findings with nifedipine suggest, however, that this calcium antagonist may potentially exert antiatherosclerotic properties via a reduction of the oxidative modification of LDL, thereby affecting a reduction in foam cell formation and in the pathophysiological cellular activities of oxidized lipids, rather than by inducing a direct reduction in cholesterol accumulation in human foam cells of macrophage origin.", 
    "69": "The beta-adrenergic signaling cascade is an important regulator of myocardial function. Numerous abnormalities occur in this pathway and are associated with impaired cardiac contractility in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). These signaling defects include downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta ARs) and increased levels of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK), an enzyme that phosphorylates and uncouples only agonist-bound receptors. Our laboratory has been testing the hypothesis that reversal of these beta-adrenergic defects may be able to restore cardiac inotropy to normal in patients with depressed systolic function. Transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of beta 2ARs or an inhibitor of beta ARK have enhanced cardiac function as compared to wildtype littermates. Adenoviral vectors encoding the beta 2AR or beta ARK inhibitor potentiate beta AR signaling in cultured adult rabbit ventricular myocytes. However, a controversy has developed in the literature regarding whether increasing beta-adrenergic signaling would be beneficial or detrimental for patients with CHF. Those cautioning against this approach note that increased sympathetic activity is dangerous in CHF. Elevated catecholamine levels predict mortality and beta-agonists are not beneficial for survival, while recent studies suggest that beta-antagonists do improve outcome. Supporting these concerns is the demonstration that transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of Gs alpha and enhanced myocardial responsiveness to isoproterenol develop myocardial fibrosis. This article summarizes this controversy; highlights important differences between overexpression of beta ARs or a beta ARK inhibitor, overexpression of Gs alpha, and administration of beta-agonists; and develops the hypothesis that these strategies may differ in their therapeutic efficacy in treating CHF.",

    "71": "New Zealand white rabbits were infected with HSV-1 strain 17Syn+ or McKrae. After latency was established, the animals were injected intramuscularly with saline (placebo), or propranolol (5-200 mg/kg) twice daily, and then induced with epinephrine iontophoresis or cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone administration. Tear film swabs were cultured to determine the frequency of viral shedding.", 
    "72": "Propranolol administered at a range of doses did not affect the frequency or duration of viral shedding following epinephrine or cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone induction as compared to saline treatment.", 
    "73": "These results demonstrate that propranolol does not significantly reduce ocular HSV-1 shedding following induction by epinephrine iontophoresis or immunosuppression. By inference, these results suggest two possibilities: (1) that viral pathways leading to spontaneous and induced shedding of virus are under separate control mechanisms or (2) in rabbits, these inducers are of such potency that propranolol is ineffectual.", 
    "74": "Non-invasive treatment continues to be the mainstay of anti-ischaemic therapy. The imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand provides the basis for myocardial ischaemia, which may present as symptomatic, asymptomatic or, in most cases, a mixture of the two. Both symptomatic and silent ischaemia are major prognostic indicators in patients with coronary artery disease and treatment should therefore be directed towards both the amelioration of symptoms and the resolution of the signs of ischaemia. Anti-ischaemic therapy may decrease oxygen demand, increase myocardial oxygen supply, or both. Interventional therapies, such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and bypass grafting, improve supply but do not alter demand. Drug therapy is associated with a variety of effects upon both supply and demand, depending upon the agent used. Nitrates alter both myocardial oxygen supply and demand, while beta-blockers decrease myocardial oxygen demand. Calcium channel blockers reduce after load and myocardial contractility and, thus, lower oxygen demand, while the coronary artery relaxation that occurs in response to their use acts to increase supply. The use of combination therapy is considered by many to be the most rational approach to the treatment of myocardial ischaemia, in that it allows maximal reduction in demand and increase in supply.", 
    "75": "To determine whether the well-known effect of timolol in reducing ocular pressure and aqueous humor (AH) flow is a function of reduced Na+ movement from plasma to aqueous. Previously, the authors have shown this to be the case for carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.", 
    "76": "The rate of appearance of 22Na in rabbit posterior aqueous was measured 1 to 3 minutes after the intravenous injection (time T) of the isotope. One hour before this, the animals received one of the following: two drops of 0.5% timolol, two drops of 3.5% pilocarpine, or 25 mg/kg intravenous methazolamide. At 1 minute (T + 1), a posterior chamber sample was taken; 2 minutes later (T + 3) a second sample was removed from the fellow eye. The rate constant of sodium accession is simply the difference between the two counts/2 minutes. Aqueous flow was measured by dilution of sulfacetamide marker as described previously.", 
    "77": "The rate constant (k(in)) for sodium entering the posterior chamber was 0.036 +/- 0.004 minute-1 (n = 17). Corresponding to previous findings, methazolamide (25 mg/kg intravenous) reduced this to 0.023 +/- 0.003 minute-1 (n = 14). Conversely, timolol (two drops of 0.5% solution) had no effect on kin, which measured 0.037 +/- 0.004 minute-1 (n = 12). Similarly, as expected, pilocarpine had no effect on k(in) (0.035 +/- 0.003 minute-1). Control flow was 3.9 microliters/minute +/- 0.4; after timolol, 2.5 microliters/minute +/-0.1; after methazolamide, 2.4 microliters/minute +/-0.2; after pilocarpine, 3.6 microliters/minute +/- 0.2. These are converted to rate constants by dividing by volume of posterior aqueous (60 microliters). The control rate constant for fluid entry was 0.065 minute-1, 1.8-fold higher than for sodium.", 
    "78": "A central dogma of the formation of AH (and cerebrospinal fluid) is that fluid moves isotonically from plasma to AH or cerebrospinal fluid and, therefore, that rate constant k(in) for fluid and for sodium are approximately the same. In the authors' hands, the fluid constant was modestly higher than for sodium. This holds for normal function and also for the reduced k(in) for fluid and sodium after carbonic anhydrase inhibition. The k(in) for neither flow nor sodium was affected by pilocarpine. Surprisingly, however timolol, which reduces flow, had no effect on Na+ entry.", 
    "79": "The effects of nicotinic and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists on tail-tremor induced by repeated nicotine administration were investigated in rats. The daily administration of nicotine (0.5 mg/kg/day, s.c.) for 8 days resulted in an augmentation of tail-tremor. However, repeated administration of dimethyl phenyl piperazinium iodide (1 mg/kg/day, s.c.) for 8 days did not cause tail-tremor. Mecamylamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p), administered before the nicotine injection on each day, abolished the tail-tremor. After discontinuation of the mecamylamine treatment, nicotine injections caused tail-tremor augmentation. Propranolol (20 mg/kg, i.p.), administered before the nicotine on each day, suppressed the appearance of tail-tremor. After the discontinuation of propranolol treatment, the degree of tail-tremor induced by a single injection of nicotine on day 9 was much greater in the propranolol-treated group than in the saline-treated control group. Neither carteolol (20 mg/kg, i.p.) nor metoprolol (20 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment showed such effects. Intraspinal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine markedly enhanced the tail-tremor induced on the first day of nicotine injection. This effect became more intense on subsequent administration of nicotine. The enhanced tail-tremor following 6-hydroxydopamine treatment was abolished by mecamylamine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.), and was suppressed by propranolol (5-20 mg/kg, s.c.) in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that central nicotinic receptors are essential for the onset and for the further development of tail-tremor induced by the repeated administration of nicotine, and that beta 2-adrenoceptors are associated with the tremor mechanism. Moreover, spinal noradrenergic mechanisms may be involved in the manifestation of this phenomenon.", 
    "80": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have both been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic renal disease. The present experiment investigated the chronology of TGF-beta 1 gene expression following subtotal nephrectomy (STNx) in the rat and the effect of blocking the RAS by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or by angiotensin II receptor (AT1) antagonism. Rats that had undergone subtotal nephrectomy developed hypertension, proteinuria, renal impairement, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and mononuclear cell infiltration. These changes were associated with a 2.5-fold increase in TGF-beta 1 gene expression during a 16-week time course. In situ hybridization localized TGF-beta 1 mRNA to sclerotic glomeruli, areas of tubuloin-terstitial injury and sites of mononuclear cell infiltration. Administration of the ACE inhibitor ramipril and the AT1 receptor blocker valsartan blunted the increase in TGF-beta 1 mRNA, and attenuated the structural and functional manifestations of injury. These data suggest an interaction between the intrarenal RAS and TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of the glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis that follow a major reduction in renal mass.", 
    "81": "We studied the stereoselective interaction between aryloxypropanolamines and the human 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor. R- and S-enantiomers of propranolol, penbutolol, and alprenolol were investigated for their ability to bind to human 5-HT1A wild-type and Asn386Val mutant receptors. Asn386 seemed to act as a chiral discriminator. Although both aryloxypropanol enantiomers displayed lower affinity for the mutant receptors, the affinities for the S-enantiomers were more affected. Receptor affinities of other structurally unrelated 5-HT1A ligands were not decreased by the mutation of Asn386 to valine. In addition, a series of analogues of propranolol with structural variation in the oxypropanolamine moiety was synthesized, and affinities for wild-type and Asn386Val mutant 5-HT1A receptors were determined. Both the hydroxyl and the ether oxygen atoms of the oxypropanol moiety seem to be required for binding at wild-type 5-HT1A receptors. The hydroxyl group of propranolol probably directly interacts with Asn386. The ether oxygen atom may be important for steric reasons but can also be involved in a direct interaction with Asn386. These findings are in agreement with the interactions of aryloxypropanolamines with Asn386 in rat 5-HT1A receptors that we previously proposed. The loss of affinity for propranolol by the Asn386Val mutation could be regained by replacement of the hydroxyl group of the ligand by a methoxy group. This modification of the propranolol structure has no effect on the affinity of both enantiomers for the wild-type 5-HT1A receptor, which provides an alternative hypothesis for the interaction of Asn386 with the oxypropanol oxygen atoms. According to this novel hypothesis, the oxypropanol oxygen atoms may both act as hydrogen bond acceptors from the NH2 group of Asn386.", 
    "82": "The stereoselective pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol, a highly beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocking agent, was studied in dogs. After intravenous and oral administration of the racemate, there was a difference in the plasma concentration between S(-)- and R(+)-bisoprolol. The area under the curve (AUC) of concentration versus time of S(-)-bisoprolol was approximately 1.5 times higher than that of R(+)-bisoprolol and the elimination half-life of S(-)-bisoprolol was approximately 1.4 times longer than that of R(+)-bisoprolol. However, no differences were observed in the volume of distribution, absolute bioavailability, and renal clearance between the two enantiomers. The plasma protein binding of S(-)-bisoprolol was also the same as that of the R(-)-isomer. No chiral inversion or enantiomer-enantiomer interaction was observed, when enantiomers were solely administered via the intravenous route. The comparison of the oxidative metabolic rate of two enantiomers using dog liver microsomes demonstrated that the metabolite was more slowly formed from S(-)- than from R(+)-bisoprolol. Consequently, we concluded that the stereoselective difference in the metabolic clearance between S(-)- and R(+)-bisoprolol caused the difference in the disposition of bisoprolol enantiomers.",

Carteolol tended to reduce the cumulative incidence of glycosuria at 26 weeks after the beginning of administration (55, 17 and 25% in control rats, and in rats fed a low (0.002%) and high dose of carteolol, respectively). 2. At the 26th week of administration, the high dose of carteolol decreased visceral fat weight, such as that of retroperitoneal and epididymal adipose tissue, whereas the liver and the kidney were not affected. 3. Although plasma glucose and triglyceride levels in non-fasted rats were elevated with age, carteolol tended to delay the increases in those parameters. Carteolol suppressed the increase in plasma glucose levels, which indicate the diabetic pattern, in a 25th week oral glucose tolerance test. 4. These findings indicate that carteolol induces improvements in bodyweight and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in an obese condition. Consequently, carteolol may be useful for the treatment of hypertension with obesity in order to prevent cardiovascular events.", 
    "90": "The effects of adrenergic receptor ligands on uptake and storage of the radiopharmaceutical [125I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) were studied in the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. For uptake studies, cells were incubated for 15 min with varying concentrations of alpha-agonist (clonidine, methoxamine, and xylazine), alpha-antagonist (phentolamine, tolazoline, phenoxybenzamine, yohimbine, and prazosin), beta-antagonist (propranolol, atenolol), beta-agonist (isoprenaline and salbutamol), mixed alpha/beta antagonist (labetalol), or the neuronal blocking agent guanethidine, prior to the addition of [125I]MIBG (0.1 microM). The incubation was continued for 2 h and specific cell-associated radioactivity was measured. For the storage studies, cells were incubated with [125I]MIBG for 2 h, followed by replacement with fresh medium with or without drug (MIBG, clonidine, or yohimbine). Cell-associated radioactivity was measured at various times over the next 20 h. Propanolol reduced [125I]MIBG uptake by approximately 30% (P<0.01) at all concentrations tested, most likely due to nonspecific membrane changes. However, incubation with the other beta-agonists or antagonists failed to elicit significant reductions in uptake. In contrast, all of the alpha-agonists significantly inhibited uptake (P<0.05); guanethidine >xylazine >clonidine=methoxamine. The alpha-antagonists demonstrated a broad range of inhibition (phenoxybenzamine >phentolamine >prazosin >yohimbine=tolazoline)(P< 0.05). The mixed ligand, labetolol, inhibited MIBG uptake in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent IC50 of 0.65 microM. The retention studies demonstrated that unlabeled MIBG caused profound self-inhibition (P<0.01). Clonidine produced a modest inhibition of retention and yohimbine had no effect. Labetalol, phenoxybenzamine, guanethidine, and propranolol reduced uptake of [125I]MIBG by neuroblastoma cells in culture. Although only labetalol has been reported to cause false-negative MIBG scans, our results suggest that these other drugs have the potential to interfere with MIBG imaging and therapy, particularly at high doses. Adrenergic drugs did not alter cytoplasmic retention of [125I]MIBG in neuroblastoma cells but may have potential in tumors such as phenochromocytoma, where granular storage of MIBG has been observed. Inhibition of [125I]MIBG retention by unlabeled MIBG supports the use of high specific activity radioiodinated MIBG for both diagnosis and therapy.", 
    "91": "It is crucial to predict drug effectiveness in chronic disease, such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), in which the left ventricular (LV) function might be improved by beta-blocker therapy. As the functional improvement effected by beta-blocker therapy takes more than 2 months, we investigated whether iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging could be used to predict drug effectiveness. We studied 13 patients (11 men and two women; mean age, 43+/-13 years) with DCM and seven normal subjects (six men and one woman; mean age, 48+/-16 years). We obtained myocardial single-photon emission tomography (SPET) images 15 min and 4 h after administration of 123I-MIBG (111 MBq). Studies were performed in the patients with DCM before and 1 and 3 months after the administration of metoprolol and in the normal subjects. We calculated the regional 123I-MIBG washout rate (r-WR) in the SPET image, and the global 123I-MIBG washout rate (g-WR) and heart-mediastinum activity ratio (H/M) using the anterior planar image. We classified patients into those showing a >/=5% increase in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) at 3 months compared with LVEF values before the treatment (group I, n=7) and those showing a <5% increase in LVEF (group II, n=6). In group I, the r-WR values at pretreatment and at 1 month and 3 months of treatment, respectively, were 36%+/-19%, 29%+/-14%* and 25%+/-13%* in the anterior segment, 39%+/-17%, 33%+/- 17%** and 28%+/-17%* in the lateral segment, 36%+/- 16%, 31%+/-14%* and 22%+/-12%** in the septal segment and 40%+/-11%, 37%+/-19% and 31%+/-18%* in the inferior segment; the g-WR was 45%+/-11%, 43%+/-10% and 34%+/-9%*, respectively (* P<0.05, ** P<0.01 vs pretreatment). In group II, there were no significant changes in regional or global parameters during the 3-month period. In normal subjects, the r-WR values in each of the anterior, lateral, septal and inferior segments were significantly lower than those in groups I and II. These values were 18%+/-9%, 18%+/-15%, 20%+/-12% and 21%+/-15%, respectively. This study demonstrated that with regional assessment 123I-MIBG SPET imaging can be used to predict the functional improvement of LVEF at 1 month of beta-blocker therapy in patients with DCM.",

Patients were classified as: 1, Normal, all vessels < 20% stenosis, n = 83; or 2, CAD, at least one vessel > 70%, n = 171. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC). Corrections were made for possible confounding variables in the multivariate analysis. Upon ROC analysis, bilirubin showed an inverse relationship with risk of CAD, with areas under the ROC curve comparable to lipoprotein: however, bilirubin showed no discrimination below false positive frequencies of approximately 0.3. Logistic regression indicated that bilirubin was a weaker global marker than the lipoproteins and interacted with apo B. A highly significant correlation was found between bilirubin and apo B (p = 0.0025), but not with cholesterol, triglycerides, or high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Compared to lipoprotein markers, bilirubin provides little practical power of discrimination for CAD. Further studies of the affect of bilirubin on CAD must take its interaction with apo B into consideration.",

Without alpha-blockade, norepinephrine levels correlated significantly with CVR; however, NPY showed no correlation. The amount of NPY overflow during the stimulation was nearly 1,000-fold lower than norepinephrine overflow. Exogenous NPY had a 100-fold more potent coronary vasoconstrictive action than that of norepinephrine.

    "103": "Despite the increased risk of sudden cardiac death associated with sleep apnea, little is known about mechanisms controlling cardiovascular responses to sleep apnea and arousal. Chronically instrumented pigs were used to investigate the effects of airway obstruction (AO) during rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep and arousal on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR). A stainless steel cannula was implanted in the lateral cerebral ventricle. During REM sleep, HR was 133 +/- 10 beats/min, MAP was 65 +/- 8 mmHg, CO was 1,435 +/- 69 ml/min, and TPR was 0.046 +/- 0.004 mmHg.ml-1.min. During AO, CO decreased by 90 +/- 17 ml/min (P < 0.05). On arousal from AO, MAP increased by 15 +/- 3 mmHg, HR increased by 10 +/- 3 beats/min, and TPR increased by 0.008 +/- 0.001 mmHg.ml-1.min (all P < 0.05). Changes during NREM were similar but were more modest during AO. After the intracerebroventricular administration of propranolol (50 micrograms/kg; a beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent), decreases in CO during AO and increases in HR during arousal were intact, but increases in MAP and TPR were no longer significant. These data suggest that vascular responses to AO during sleep may be regulated in part by beta-adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system.", 
    "104": "Nisoldipine coat-core is an extended-release once-daily formulation of a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist effective in the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris. With immediate-release formulations of nisoldipine, plasma drug concentrations that produce therapeutic effects result rapidly, but are not sustained and do not maintain the effects throughout a 12-hour dosage interval. In contrast, with nisoldipine coat-core, a gradual increase in plasma nisoldipine concentrations occurs over 12 hours and therapeutic concentrations are then maintained for the duration of a 24-hour dosage interval. In dosages of 10 to 60 mg once daily, nisoldipine coat-core controls symptoms of angina and improves exercise-induced signs of ischaemia in patients with stable angina. Compared with placebo, daily nisoldipine coat-core doses of > or = 20 mg provide statistically significant increases in total exercise time and time to produce angina and a trend towards an increase in the time to produce 1 mm ST segment depression, in exercise tests conducted approximately 23 hours postdose. When administered in 20 and 40 mg daily doses, nisoldipine coat-core produces improvements in exercise test parameters that are similar to those seen with amlodipine 5 or 10 mg/day or regular-release or sustained-release (SR) diltiazem 240 mg/day. The frequency of daily angina attacks and consumption of short-acting nitrates are also reduced by nisoldipine to a similar extent to that observed with these other agents. After longer term (1 year) administration of 10 to 60 mg daily, improvements in exercise test parameters are maintained, with equivalent anti-ischaemic efficacy seen in patients receiving nisoldipine coat-core alone or with background nitrate or beta-blocker therapy. Adverse events associated with nisoldipine coat-core are typical of the dihydropyridine class of calcium antagonists, with peripheral oedema and headache being most common. Nisoldipine coat-core appears to be associated with fewer deaths than placebo, notably in the DEFIANT-II (Doppler Flow and Echocardiography in Functional Cardiac Insufficiency: Assessment of Nisoldipine Therapy II) study, where only 1 death occurred with nisoldipine compared with 7 in the placebo group. Nisoldipine should not be taken during phenytoin therapy. In addition, grapefruit juice should be avoided during nisoldipine therapy and nisoldipine should not be taken concurrently with high-fat meals. Thus, the coat-core formulation of nisoldipine appears to have overcome the limitations of the shorter duration of action of immediate-release nisoldipine. Nisoldipine coat-core is well tolerated and once-daily administration produces a long duration of effective anti-ischaemic relief in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.", 
    "105": "We studied the ability to predict depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from clinical and exercise test findings prior to surgery in consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) from 1988 to 1991 (n = 663). Multivariate analysis showed a history of myocardial infarction, pathological Q-wave in resting ECG, systolic blood pressure at maximal exercise and the degree of mitral regurgitation as significant independent predictors of impaired LVEF. The relative risk (RR) of depressed LVEF was markedly increased for a previous history of myocardial infarction (RR 3.3, p < 0.0001) and a pathological Q-wave in resting ECG (RR 2.4, p < 0.0001). All associations found between depressed LVEF and exercise test results were poor, and of little value for discriminating patients with depressed LVEF. Thus, clinical data appear to be better markers of low LVEF than the information obtained from the exercise test.", 
    "106": "Hydrophobic antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor inhibit channel activity by binding within the transmembrane pore formed by the second of four transmembrane domains (M2) on each of the receptor's subunits. Hydrophobic mutagenesis near the middle (10' locus) of the alpha-subunit M2 domain results in channels that are much more sensitive to block by long-chain alcohols and general anesthetics, indicating that the inhibitory site on wild-type receptors is nearby. To determine whether other receptor subunits also contribute to the blocker site, the hydrophobic mutagenesis strategy was extended to all four subunits at 10' loci. alpha S10'l causes the largest increase in apparent hexanol binding (4.3-fold compared to wild type), approximately twice the size of the change caused by beta T10'l (2.2-fold). gamma A10'l and delta A10'l mutations cause much smaller changes in apparent hexanol binding affinity (about 1.2-fold each), even when corrected for their smaller degree of side-chain hydrophobicity changes. When 10'l mutant subunits are coexpressed, the change from wild type in apparent hexanol binding energy (delta delta Gmixture) is roughly equal to the sum of hexanol binding energy changes for the constituent mutant subunits (sigma delta delta Gsubunits). The simplest model consistent with these results is one in which hydrophobic blockers make simultaneous contact with all five M2 10' residues, but the extent of contact is much greater for the alpha and beta than for gamma and delta side chains.", 
    "107": "An important function of the sympathetic nervous system is to maintain homeostasis by modulating the level of cellular activity in many diverse organ systems. The sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine modulates the level of T and B lymphocyte activity by binding to the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR). The present study was designed to elucidate the mechanism by which stimulation of the beta2AR affects both Th1/Th2 cell cytokine production and Th1/Th2 cell-dependent Ab production. Clones of murine Th1/Th2 cells were exposed to the beta2AR agonist terbutaline before activation by Ag-presenting B cells. Terbutaline exposure of Th1 cells before activation inhibited IFN-gamma production by Th1 cells and subsequent IgG2a production by B cells. IgG2a inhibition was prevented by addition of the betaAR antagonist nadolol or exogenous IFN-gamma. In contrast to Th1 cells, terbutaline did not affect either IL-4 production by Th2 cells or subsequent IgG1 production by B cells. Although baseline levels of intracellular cAMP were similar in both subsets, terbutaline induced an increase in cAMP levels in Th1 cells only. Radioligand binding studies showed that a detectable number of beta2AR binding sites were present on Th1 cells, but not on Th2 cells. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that Th1 cells expressed a higher level of the beta2AR cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus than did Th2 cells. These results show that expression of the beta2AR binding site by Th1 cells, but not by Th2 cells, establishes a physiologic mechanism for selective modulation of Th1 cell IFN-gamma production and IFN-gamma-dependent IgG2a production, provided that beta2AR stimulation occurs before cell activation by a B cell.", 
    "108": "Amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) is deposited as insoluble fibrils in the brain parenchyma and cerebral blood vessels in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to neuronal degeneration, cerebral vascular alterations indicative of damage to vascular endothelial cells and disruption of the blood-brain barrier occur in AD. Here we report that A beta25-35 can impair regulatory functions of endothelial cells (ECs) from porcine pulmonary artery and induce their death. Subtoxic exposures to A beta25-35 induced albumin transfer across EC monolayers and impaired glucose transport into ECs. Cell death induced by A beta25-35 was of an apoptotic form, characterized by DNA condensation and fragmentation, and prevented by inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis and endonucleases. The effects of A beta25-35 were specific because A beta1-40 also induced apoptosis in ECs with the apoptotic cells localized to the microenvironment of A beta1-40 aggregates and because astrocytes did not undergo similar changes after exposure to A beta25-35. Damage and death of ECs induced by A beta25-35 were attenuated by antioxidants, a calcium channel blocker, and a chelator of intracellular calcium, indicating the involvement of free radicals and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis. The data show that A beta induces increased permeability of EC monolayers to macromolecules, impairs glucose transport, and induces apoptosis. If similar mechanisms are operative in vivo, then A beta and other amyloidogenic peptides may be directly involved in vascular EC damage documented in AD and other disorders that involve vascular amyloid accumulation.", 
    "109": "It has been reported that the 5-HT1A autoreceptor antagonist pindolol can accelerate the antidepressant response to the selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine, presumably by preventing the initial decrease in firing activity of 5-HT neurons produced by the SSRI. The present study was aimed at further exploring this treatment strategy in three groups of 10 patients with unipolar major depression allocated sequentially to three treatment arms for 28 days. The administration of the selective 5-HT1A agonist buspirone (20 mg/day for 1 week and 30 mg/day thereafter) with pindolol (2.5 mg TID) was used to activate selectively postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. This combination produced a greater than 50% reduction of depressive symptoms in the first week in 8 of 10 patients and the response was sustained for the remainder of the trial. In contrast, the combination of tricyclic antidepressant drugs devoid of effect on the 5-HT reuptake process (desipramine or trimipramine, 75 mg/day for 1 week and 150 mg/day thereafter) with pindolol resulted in only one of ten patients achieving a 50% improvement after 28 days. The combination of the SSRI fluvoxamine (50 mg/day for 1 week and 100 mg/day thereafter) with pindolol produced a marked antidepressant effect but did not act as rapidly as the buspirone plus pindolol combination with none, four, and eight patients achieving a 50% amelioration after 7, 14, and 21 days of treatment, respectively. These results provide further evidence that pindolol may accelerate the antidepressant effect of drugs that alter the function of the 5-HT neurons and that the selective activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors may induce a rapid and robust antidepressant response.", 
    "110": "A stereoselective reversed-phase HPLC assay to quantify S-(-) and R-(+) enantiomers of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol in human plasma was developed. The method involved liquid-liquid extraction for sample clean-up and employed 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate as a pre-column chiral derivatization reagent. The internal standard used was 4-methylpropranolol. The derivatized products were separated on an Altex C18 column using a mixture of acetonitrile-water-phosphoric acid-triethylamine (58:42:0.1:0.06 and 50:50:0.15:0.06, v/v, for propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol, respectively) as mobile phase. The detection of propranolol derivatives was made at lambda(ex)=280 nm and lambda(em)=325 nm, and the corresponding 325 and 400 nm were used for 4-hydroxypropranolol derivatives. The assay was linear from 1 to 100 ng/ml and from 2 to 50 ng/ml using 0.5 ml of human plasma for propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol enantiomers, respectively. The present assay is used to quantify the enantiomers of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol, respectively, in human plasma for pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "111": "Two dimensional images of myocardial Ca2+ sparks, non-propagating local rises in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, were obtained at 4 msec intervals with a rapid-scanning confocal laser microscope, Nikon RCM 8000, and fluo-3. Spontaneous Ca2+ sparks were observed at apparently random sites throughout the cytoplasm of rat ventricular cells. The duration of sparks was 30 to 40 msec and the time to peak intensity about 10 msec. Ryanodine (1 microM) completely inhibited Ca2+ sparks while nicardipine (3 microM) had no effect. Isoproterenol (1 microM) had no effect on the frequency and distribution of Ca2+ sparks but significantly increased their amplitude. These results suggest that myocardial Ca2+ sparks are the result of spontaneous release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and that beta-adrenergic stimulation may result in functional modification of the ryanodine receptor channel.", 
    "112": "In patients with no or only mild structural heart disease, spontaneous ventricular ectopy which causes symptoms is being treated with beta receptor antagonists, sotalol, or in rare cases with class I substances. For primary prevention of sudden death, for instance in survivors of myocardial infarction, beta receptor antagonists are the only substances for which benefit has been demonstrated in large scale trials. In contrast, class I agents are contraindicated for this purpose. In secondary prevention of sudden death in patients with a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, treatment with sotalol or amiodarone can be considered. However, nonpharmacological therapy by means of implantable defibrillators is increasingly applied in this patient population.", 
    "113": "The beta3-adrenergic receptor (beta3-AR) exerts a central role in the transduction of catecholamine effects in white and brown adipose tissue (WAT and BAT). A recent report has documented that insulin strongly down-regulates beta3-AR expression and catecholamine responsiveness in 3T3-F442A adipocytes [F\u00e8ve, El Hadri, Quignard-Boulang\u00e9 and Pairault (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91, 5677-5681]. In the present report we show that the rise in plasma insulin levels elicited by the fasted/fed transition is associated with a reduction in beta3-AR mRNA levels and beta-adrenergic responsiveness in WAT and BAT. beta3-AR transcripts are also decreased in adipose tissue from animals subjected for 6 h to euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamps. Moreover, insulin acts directly on cultured rat white and brown adipocytes to decrease beta3-AR gene expression and adenylate cyclase activity in response to beta3-AR-selective agonists. These results suggest that there is a close relationship between food intake, plasma insulin levels and beta3-AR expression.",

    "115": "We developed a software that analyzes Color Kinesis images and provides quantitative indices of magnitude and timing of regional endocardial motion. Images obtained in 12 normal subjects were used to evaluate the variability in each index. Esmolol, dobutamine, and atropine were used to track variations in LV function in 14 subjects. Objective evaluation of wall motion was tested in 20 patients undergoing dobutamine stress testing. Regional fractional area change, displacement, and radial shortening were displayed as histograms and time curves. Global function was assessed by calculating magnitude and timing of peak ejection or filling rates and mean time of ejection or filling. Patterns of endocardial motion were consistent between normal subjects. Fractional area change and peak ejection rate decreased with esmolol and increased with dobutamine. Time to peak ejection and mean time of contraction were prolonged with esmolol and shortened with dobutamine. Using atropine, we proved that our findings with dobutamine were not secondary to its chronotropic effects. Dobutamine induced regional wall motion abnormalities in 10 patients in 38 segments diagnosed conventionally. Segmental analysis detected abnormalities in 36 of these 38 segments and in an additional 5 of 322 segments.",

Both drugs effectively (p < 0.001) lowered resting blood pressure when measured at the time of theoretical peak (i.e., 3 to 4 hours postdrug) and trough (i.e., 24 hours postdrug) drug blood levels. Atenolol reduced maximal oxygen uptake (by 7.3%, p < 0.001) 3 to 4, but not 24, hours after drug ingestion; no changes occurred with enalapril. Similarly, whereas serum lipids were essentially unchanged with enalapril, serum triglycerides (18.9% increase), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (10.6% decrease), and ratio of low-density to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (15.4% increase) were adversely impacted (p < or = 0.05) with atenolol. It is concluded that in contrast to enalapril, atenolol adversely impacts cardiovascular fitness and serum lipids and lipoproteins in physically active hypertensive men.", 
    "125": "In the Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) trial, d,l-sotalol was associated with a lower arrhythmia recurrence and mortality than class I antiarrhythmic drugs. To further evaluate the relative efficacy of d,I-sotalol compared with class I drugs, and to assess the relative importance of its class II (beta-blocking) and class III effects, 6-year arrhythmia recurrence and mortality in patients receiving sotalol were compared with those in patients receiving class I drugs, subdivided according to whether they also received coadministered beta blockers. Relative efficacy was also determined for sotalol and for class I drugs as stratified by the presence/absence of prior drug failure. Arrhythmia recurrence was lower for the 84 patients receiving sotalol than for patients given class I agents with (n = 28) (p = 0.008) or without (n = 184) (p = 0.001) alpha beta blocker. Mortality was lower for patients taking sotalol than for those given a class I drug without alpha beta blocker (p = 0.034), but similar (p = 0.835) if alpha beta blocker was also administered. In contrast to class I drugs, which had lower efficacy rates when prior drug trials had failed, sotalol maintained its efficacy despite prior drug failures preceding or during the ESVEM trial. Both class II and III actions in the ESVEM trial were important to the clinical superiority of sotalol in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "126": "This study assessed the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of mibefradil when added to beta-blocker monotherapy in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. Two hundred five patients were randomized to receive double-blind treatment with either placebo (n = 70), mibefradil 25 mg (n = 67), or mibefradil 50 mg (n = 68) for 2 weeks. Exercise tolerance tests (ETTs) were performed at the end of the run-in (baseline) and double-blind treatment periods, and patients maintained an anginal diary. Compared with placebo, treatment with mibefradil 50 mg resulted in significant increases in exercise duration (36 +/- 51 seconds; p = 0.036), time to onset of angina (48 +/- 65 seconds; p = 0.002), and time to persistent 1-mm ST-segment depression (47 +/- 77 seconds; p = 0.004). Greater reductions in heart rate, blood pressure, and the rate-pressure product were more apparent at each stage of the ETT in the 50-mg mibefradil group than in the placebo group. Daily treatment with mibefradil 50 mg was associated with a significant decrease in the number of weekly anginal attacks (-2.1 +/- 4.0, p = 0.020) compared with placebo. The addition of mibefradil to existing beta-blocker therapy was well tolerated. Dizziness was the most frequently reported adverse event in the mibefradil 50-mg dose, and occurred with an incidence of 4.4%. The addition of mibefradil 50 mg, administered once daily, to patients on stable beta-blocker therapy produced additive antianginal and anti-ischemic effects and was well tolerated.", 
    "127": "1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a neurotoxin that produces Parkinsonism symptoms in man, has been examined as a substrate of recombinant human cytochrome P450 2D6. When cumene hydroperoxide is used as an oxygen and electron donor, a single product is formed, identified as 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. The K(m) for formation of this product (130 microM) is in agreement with the dissociation constants for MPTP binding to the enzyme determined by optical and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. When the reaction is carried out with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH) and recombinant human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, a second product, identified as 1-methyl-4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, is formed in addition to 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. The K(m) values for formation of these two products are 19 microM and 120 microM, respectively. Paramagnetic relaxation experiments have been used to measure distances between the protons of bound MPTP and the heme iron, and these have been used to construct models for the position and orientation of MPTP in the active site. For the cytochrome alone, a single mode of binding was observed, with the N-methyl close to the heme iron in a position appropriate for the observed N-demethylation reaction. In the presence of the reductase, the data were not consistent with a single mode of binding but could be explained by the existence of two alternative orientations of MPTP in the active site. One of these, characterized by a dissociation constant of 150 microM, is essentially identical to that observed in the absence of the reductase. In the second, which has a K(d) of 25 microM, the MPTP is oriented so that the aromatic ring is close to the heme iron, in a position appropriate for p-hydroxylation leading to the formation of the product seen only in the presence of the reductase. In the case of codeine, another substrate for cytochrome P450 2D6, the addition of reductase had no effect on the nature of the product formed, the dissociation constant, or the orientation in the binding site. These observations show that NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase has an allosteric effect on the active site of cytochrome P450 2D6 that affects the binding of some substrates but not others.", 
    "128": "The effect of subcutaneously administered carbamazepine, a sodium channel blocker, on the electrically evoked C-fibre (noxious) vs A beta-fibre (innocuous) responses of dorsal horn neurones in non-inflamed and inflamed rats (3 h after plantar injection of carrageenan) was studied. Carbamazepine (0.5-5 mg/kg) significantly reduced the noxious evoked responses of the neurones under inflammatory, but not non-inflamed, conditions. The innocuous evoked responses of the neurones were not sensitive to carbamazepine under any conditions and administration of the vehicle alone did not influence any evoked response of these neurones. We propose that there are changes in the type, or proportion of, sodium channels underlying the transmission of noxious messages following peripheral inflammation which become sensitive to carbamazepine."
