    "0": "We tested the hypothesis that endogenously produced hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) can potentially contribute to the adrenergic stress response in rainbow trout by initiating catecholamine secretion from chromaffin cells. During acute hypoxia (water Po(2) = 35 mmHg), plasma H(2)S levels were significantly elevated concurrently with a rise in circulating catecholamine concentrations. Tissues enriched with chromaffin cells (posterior cardinal vein and anterior kidney) produced H(2)S in vitro when incubated with l-cysteine. In both tissues, the production of H(2)S was eliminated by adding the cystathionine beta-synthase inhibitor, aminooxyacetate. Cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase were cloned and sequenced and the results of real-time PCR demonstrated that with the exception of white muscle, mRNA for both enzymes was broadly distributed within the tissues that were examined. Electrical field stimulation of an in situ saline-perfused posterior cardinal vein preparation caused the appearance of H(2)S and catecholamines in the outflowing perfusate. Perfusion with the cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol (1 x 10(-6) M) or depolarizing levels of KCl (1 x 10(-2) M) caused secretion of catecholamines without altering H(2)S output, suggesting that neuronal excitation is required for H(2)S release. Addition of H(2)S (at concentrations exceeding 5 x 10(-7) M) to the perfusion fluid resulted in a marked stimulation of catecholamine secretion that was not observed when Ca(2+)-free perfusate was used. These data, together with the finding that H(2)S-induced catecholamine secretion was unaltered by the nicotinic receptor blocker hexamethonium, suggest that H(2)S is able to directly elicit catecholamine secretion via membrane depolarization followed by Ca(2+)-mediated exocytosis.",

We examined whether acute administration of beta-blocker could enhance ibutilide (IB) efficacy in conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular rate.", 
    "2": "Ninety patients (aged 63 +/- 13.5 years) with rapidly conducting AF were randomized in to two groups. Group A (n = 44) received esmolol titrated to achieve a heart rate of <100 bpm followed by IB co-administration, while Group B (n = 46) were treated with IB as monotherapy. In Group A, 29 patients (67%) converted to sinus rhythm (SR) compared with 21 (46%) in Group B (P = 0.04). The use of esmolol was the most important predictor for cardioversion (P = 0.009). The slower the heart rate at the time of IB initiation, the higher the likelihood for cardioversion (P = 0.015). Patients in Group A had significantly shorter corrected QT interval (QTc) at the time of conversion than those in Group B (433 vs. 501 ms, P = 0.003). Two patients in Group A developed severe bradycardia, whereas three patients in Group B developed severe ventricular tachycardia (VT).", 
    "3": "Compared with IB monotherapy, the combination therapy of esmolol and IB appears to be more effective in conversion of rapidly conducting AF back to SR. The addition of beta-blocker reduces QTc prolongation and diminishes the risk of VT at the expense, however, of increased bradycardic events.", 
    "4": "SGK1 is critically important for mineralocorticoid/salt-induced glomerular injury. SGK1 inactivates GSK3, which downregulates Snail, a DNA-binding molecule repressing the transcription of nephrin, a protein critically important for the integrity of the glomerular slit membrane. PKB/SGK-dependent GSK regulation is disrupted in mice carrying a mutation, in which the serine in the SGK/PKB-phosphorylation consensus sequence is replaced by alanine. The present study explored whether PKB/SGK-dependent GSK3 regulation influences glomerular proteinuria. Gene-targeted knockin mice with mutated and thus PKB/SGK-resistant GSK3alpha,beta (gsk3(KI)) were compared with their wild-type littermates (gsk3(WT)). gsk3(KI) and gsk3(WT) mice were implanted with DOCA release pellets and offered 1% saline as drinking water for 21 days. Under standard diet, tap water intake and absence of DOCA, urinary flow rate, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary albumin excretion were significantly larger and blood pressure was significantly higher in gsk3(KI) than in gsk3(WT) mice. Within 18 days, DOCA/salt treatment significantly increased fluid intake and urinary flow rate, urinary protein and albumin excretion, and blood pressure in both genotypes but the respective values were significantly higher in gsk3(KI) than in gsk3(WT) mice. Plasma albumin concentration was significantly lower in gsk3(KI) than in gsk3(WT) mice. Proteinuria was abrogated by lowering of blood pressure with alpha(1)-blocker prazosin (1 microg/g body wt) in 8-mo-old mice. According to immunofluorescence, nephrin at 3 and 8 mo and podocin expression at 3 mo were significantly lower in gsk3(KI) than in gsk3(WT) mice. After 18 days, DOCA/salt treatment renal glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage were significantly more pronounced in gsk3(KI) than in gsk3(WT) mice. The observations reveal that disruption of PKB/SGK-dependent regulation of GSK3 leads to glomerular injury with proteinuria, which may at least partially be secondary to enhanced blood pressure.", 
    "5": "Although adherence to evidence-based therapy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes post-myocardial infarction (MI) and in patients with heart failure, adherence remains suboptimal. One method that has demonstrated success in improving adherence is the reduction in the frequency of drug administration (eg, switching from a twice-daily to a once-daily regimen). A once-daily controlled-release (CR) formulation of carvedilol--a beta-blocker used in the treatment of post-MI left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), heart failure, and hypertension--has recently received US approval. This review provides a switching protocol for transitioning stable patients from twice-daily carvedilol to once-daily carvedilol CR. Based on the findings from a head-to-head comparison study of carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate suggesting that carvedilol is associated with superior reductions in mortality and morbidity, physicians may consider switching patients with heart failure receiving beta-blockers who have not shown benefits in this setting. Algorithms are provided for switching patients with heart failure or post-MI LVD from another beta-blocker to carvedilol CR.",

However, the underlying mechanisms at the cellular and ion channel levels have not been completely clarified. Therefore, the present study was designed to identify the cellular target and the mechanisms of inotropic effect of matrine. Guinea pig papillary muscles were used to study the contractile force of the heart and ventricular myocytes were used to study L-type calcium channel (ICa-L) and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). In electrically driven papillary muscles, matrine enhanced the contractile force in a dose-dependent manner and the positive inotropic effect was not inhibited by alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists. In ventricular myocytes, matrine also increased ICa-L in a dose-dependent manner and shifted the inactivation curve toward right. Matrine markedly enhanced the KCl-induced elevations of [Ca2+]i. In a conclusion, ICa-L might be a main target of matrine. Matrine enhanced [Ca2+]i by stimulating ICa-L and exerted positive inotropic effects on electrically driven guinea pig papillary muscles.",

    "18": "Thiazides, recommended as first-line antihypertensive therapy, are associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Thiazides also lower serum potassium. To determine whether thiazide-induced diabetes is mediated by changes in potassium, we analyzed data from 3790 nondiabetic participants in the Systolic Hypertension in Elderly Program, a randomized clinical trial of isolated systolic hypertension in individuals aged >or=60 years treated with chlorthalidone or placebo. Incident diabetes was defined by self-report, antidiabetic medication use, fasting glucose >or=126 mg/dL, or random glucose >or=200 mg/dL. The mediating variable was change in serum potassium during year 1. Of the 459 incident cases of diabetes during follow-up, 42% occurred during year 1. In year 1, the unadjusted incidence rates of diabetes per 100 person-years were 6.1 and 3.0 in the chlorthalidone and placebo groups, respectively. In year 1, the adjusted diabetes risk (hazard ratio) with chlorthalidone was 2.07 (95% CI: 1.51 to 2.83; P<0.001). After adjustment for change in serum potassium, the risk was significantly reduced (hazard ratio: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.17; P=0.01); the extent of risk attenuation (41%; 95% CI: 34% to 49%) was consistent with a mediating effect. Each 0.5-mEq/L decrease in serum potassium was independently associated with a 45% higher adjusted diabetes risk (95% CI: 24% to 70%; P<0.001). After year 1, chlorthalidone use was not associated with increased diabetes risk. In conclusion, thiazide-induced diabetes occurs early after initiating treatment and appears to be mediated by changes in serum potassium. Potassium supplementation might prevent thiazide-induced diabetes. This hypothesis can and should be tested in a randomized trial.", 
    "19": "Hypertension appears to alter brain morphology, as well as the cerebrovascular support for information processing. Because these effects might reflect progressive effects of essential hypertension on the brain, we asked whether structural and functional brain indices would predict the success of pharmacological treatment of hypertension among 45 previously unmedicated individuals. After initial structural MRI and functional positron emission tomography imaging, subjects were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion for treatment for 1 year with either lisinopril or atenolol. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreases after treatment stabilization were correlated to a pretreatment index of brain aging (combined ratings of ventricle and sulcal size and white matter hyperintensities) and the pretreatment change in regional cerebral blood flow during working memory in the thalamus and posterior parietal regions of interest. In multiple regression analyses, the structural brain index and the blood flow response in the thalamus predicted 20% of the variance in the systolic blood pressure response to treatment controlling for pretreatment blood pressure, age, gender, and type and dose of medication. Alcohol use influenced the thalamic response measure, but covariates did not alter the relation between greater indices of brain aging and less successful blood pressure response to treatment. The state of the brain may be an important factor in the remediation of blood pressure.", 
    "20": "Simple, accurate, economical, and reproducible UV spectrophotometric and column high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods were developed for simultaneous estimation of a 2-component drug mixture of metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide in combined tablet dosage form. The first method used the simultaneous equation method with 7 mixed standards and the absorption maxima at 223 and 271 nm, respectively, for metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide in methanol. Linearity was observed in the concentration ranges of 4-24 and 2-16 microg/mL for metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. The developed HPLC method used a reversed-phase C18 column and methanol-water (95 + 5) mobile phase at an ambient temperature of 27 +/- 2 degrees C and UV detection at 225 nm; the run time was 10 min, and quantification was based on peak area. The injection repeatability and intraday and interday repeatability were calculated. Paracetamol was used as an internal standard for the HPLC method, and linearity was observed in the concentration range of 5-50 microg/mL for metoprolol and 2-20 microg/mL for hydrochlorothiazide. The proposed methods were successfully applied for the determination of metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide in bulk powder and dosage form.

In the state of Louisiana, USA, many municipalities treat wastewater using natural systems, such as lagoons and wetlands, rather than conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Nearly all research to date has focused on the fate of PhACs in conventional treatment plants, not constructed and natural wetlands. In the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for Mandeville, Louisiana, USA, wastewater flows of 7600 m(3)d(-1) are treated in a series of aeration lagoons (basins), followed by a constructed wetland and UV disinfection, before being discharged into a natural forested wetland (i.e. Bayou Chinchuba) and eventually, Lake Pontchartrain. Thirteen out of the 15PhACs investigated were detected in the wastewater inflow to the treatment plant. Only 9 of the 13 compounds were above the detection limits at the treatment plant effluent. The concentrations of most compounds were reduced by greater than 90% within the plant, while carbamazepine and sotalol were only reduced by 51% and 82%, respectively. The percent reductions observed in the Mandeville system were greater than reduction rates reported for conventional WWTPs; perhaps due to the longer treatment time ( approximately 30 days). Most target PhACs were not completely removed before discharge into Lake Pontchartrain, although their collective annual loading was reduced to less than 1kg and down to ppb with significant potential for dilution in the large lake.", 
    "30": "The present work illustrated possibilities of column-coupling electrophoresis combined with DAD for the direct quantitative determination of trace drug (celiprolol, CEL) in clinical human urine samples. ITP, on-line coupled with CZE, served as an ideal injection technique (high sample load capacity, narrow and sharp drug zone). Moreover, the ITP provided an effective on-line sample pretreatment (preseparation, purification and preconcentration of the drug) producing analyte zone suitable for its direct detection and quantitation in CZE stage. Spectral DAD in comparison with single wavelength ultraviolet detection enhanced value of analytical information (i) verifying purity (i.e., spectral homogeneity) of drug zone (according to differences in spectrum profiles when compared tested and reference drug spectra) and (ii) indicating zones/peaks with spectra similar to the drug spectrum (potential structurally related metabolites). The characterization of trace analyte signals superposed on the baseline noise was more definite thanks to the application of background correction and smoothing procedure to the raw DAD spectra (producing relevant spectral response). The proposed ITP-CZE-DAD method was characterized by favorable performance parameters for CEL in urine matrices {e.g., the lower limit of quantification was 9.7 ng/mL, RSD and relative error of the determinations were lower than 3% (precision) and 1% (accuracy), respectively, analyte peak exhibited spectral homogeneity (reflecting separation selectivity), separation efficiency was 84,500 theoretical plates} and successfully applied in a trial pharmacokinetic study of CEL.", 
    "31": "We studied cardioprotective as well as Akt and extracellular signal-activated kinase (ERK) activating effect of a Ca(2+) antagonist and a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker during ischemia-reperfusion, and compared these properties of the substances with that of a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as a positive control throughout the experiments. Langendorff-perfused isolated rat hearts were subjected to 25 min global ischemia followed by 45 min reperfusion, and recovery of energy metabolism as well as functional cardiac parameters were monitored. Although to varying extents, all substances improved recovery of creatine phosphate, ATP, intracellular pH, and reutilization of inorganic phosphate. These favorable changes were accompanied by improved recovery of heart function parameters and reduced infarct size. In addition and again to varying extents, all studied substances decreased oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation), and activated Akt, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta, and ERK1/2. Correlation between cardioprotective and kinase activating effectivity of the compounds proved to be statistically significant. Physiological significance of these kinase activations was established by demonstrating that inhibition of Akt by LY294002 and ERK1/2 by PD98059 compromised the cardioprotective effect of all the substances studied. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K)-Akt and ERK2 pathways significantly contributed to cardioprotective effects of a Ca(2+) antagonist and a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between cardioprotective and kinase-activating potencies of the substances studied (Verapamil, Metoprolol and two PARP inhibitors), which indicated the potentiality of these kinases as drug-targets in the therapy of ischemic heart disease.",

TEA and cimetidine were actively transported in the basolateral-to-apical direction by the specific transport system. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that basolateral influx and apical efflux were cooperatively responsible for the directional transport of TEA and cimetidine. Lipophilic cationic drugs, quinidine, S-nicotine, and bisoprolol, significantly diminished basolateral influx and apical efflux clearance of cimetidine. However, transcellular transport of quinidine in the basolateral-to-apical direction was similar to that in the opposite direction in LLC-PK1 cells. In contrast, quinidine was transported actively in the basolateral-to-apical direction in P-glycoprotein-expressed LLC-GA5-COL150 cells. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that P-glycoprotein increased the apical efflux of quinidine and also decreased the apical influx of the drug. Basolateral-to-apical transport of bisoprolol was also similar to apical-to-basolateral transport in LLC-PK1 cells, whereas the drug was directionally transported from the basolateral to the apical side in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells. These results suggested that bisoprolol was not significantly transported via transport systems involved in the directional transport of TEA and cimetidine, but that P-glycoprotein was responsible for the directional transport of bisoprolol as well as quinidine in renal epithelial cells.",

Conditional on the propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of observed baseline covariates. In the medical literature, there are three commonly employed propensity-score methods: stratification (subclassification) on the propensity score, matching on the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. Methods have been developed to assess the adequacy of the propensity score model in the context of stratification on the propensity score and propensity-score matching. However, no comparable methods have been developed for covariate adjustment using the propensity score. Inferences about treatment effect made using propensity-score methods are only valid if, conditional on the propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of baseline covariates. We develop both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the balance in baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects. The quantitative method employs the weighted conditional standardized difference. This is the conditional difference in the mean of a covariate between treated and untreated subjects, in units of the pooled standard deviation, integrated over the distribution of the propensity score. The qualitative method employs quantile regression models to determine whether, conditional on the propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of continuous covariates. We illustrate our methods using a large dataset of patients discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction). The exposure was receipt of a prescription for a beta-blocker at hospital discharge.",

    "53": "1693 glaucoma patients (G) and 621 ocular hypertensive (OHT) patients were included. Mean age was 65.6+/-11.7 years. Onset of disease was 7.2+/-6.6 years and 5.2+/-4.9 years for G and OHT patients, respectively. Insufficient efficacy of the previous topical treatment (monotherapy in 55% of cases) was the main cause for shifting to a fixed combination in 70% of cases. Satisfaction was increased in 15% of the patients and compliance was increased in 25% of the patients.",

    "55": "Variceal bleeding is the most serious complication of portal hypertension associated with high mortality. This study was conducted to investigate any protective effect of early propranolol administration in the development and degree of esophageal varices in cirrhotic rats with portal hypertension. This topic is controversial in the literature.", 
    "56": "For the development of liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices, 60 rats underwent ligation of the left adrenal vein and complete devascularization of the left renal vein, followed by phenobarbital and carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) administration. This operation enhances the development of cephalad collaterals, responsible for the induction of esophageal varices. After 2 weeks of CCl(4) administration, the rats were randomly separated into 2 groups. In group I, propranolol was continuously administered intragastrically throughout the study, whereas in group II normal saline (placebo) was administered instead. Cirrhosis was detected clinically by ascites development. Hemodynamic studies and morphometric analysis of the lower esophagus were performed after complete induction of cirrhosis, measuring the following parameters: portal pressure, total number of submucosal veins, total submucosal vessel area, mean cross-sectional submucosal vessel area, relative submucosal area (percentage) occupied by vessels and area of the single most dilated submucosal vein.", 
    "57": "The statistical analysis revealed no statistically important difference between the 2 groups for the morphometrically studied parameters. However, portal venous pressure was lower in group I.",

    "59": "We compared the effects of losartan and carvedilol on preserving left ventricular (LV) function in an experimental model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and examined the mechanisms of their pharmacological effects. The rats were divided into group 1 (normal control), group 2 (DCM), group 3 (DCM plus carvedilol 8 mg/kg/day bid orally), and group 4 (DCM plus losartan 20 mg/kg/day orally). All rats were sacrificed on day 90 following DCM induction. The results indicated that connexin43 protein expression and mRNA expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha, endo-thelial nitric oxide synthase, and interleukin-10 were significantly lower, whereas mRNA expressions of endothelin-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were significantly higher in group 2 than in groups 1, 3, and 4 in LV myocardium (all P < 0.05). Additionally, cytochrome C levels in LV myocardium and LV contractility were significantly lower, whereas fibrosis area, cellular apoptosis, and mitochondrial oxidative response of LV myocardium were significantly higher in group 2 than in groups 1, 3, and 4 (all P < 0.005). In conclusion, losartan is comparable to carvedilol in attenuating inflammation, oxidative response, myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis, as well as in preserving energy transcription factors and LV function in DCM.", 
    "60": "The present study was designed to assess the antiproteinuric effects of a low dose of an angiotensin II-receptor blocker, losartan, in normotensive patients with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. We performed a prospective, controlled trial of losartan (12.5 mg/d) therapy to assess the effects on mild proteinuria and renal function. The study subjects were 18 normotensive and proteinuric patients with IgA nephropathy in the losartan group and 18 IgA nephropathy patients treated with antiplatelet agents in the control group. We prospectively evaluated blood pressure, proteinuria, renal function, and biochemical parameters before and after 12 months of therapy. Blood pressure was kept constant during the 12-month period. Serum creatinine levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate did not significantly change during the 12 months in any of the patients studied. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not differ significantly between the losartan and control groups. However, low-dose losartan significantly reduced proteinuria from 0.8+/-0.5 g/d at baseline to 0.4+/-0.4 g/d at 12 months (p=0.006). Proteinuria was significantly lower at 12 months in the losartan group than in the control group (p=0.04). In addition, urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) levels in the losartan group at 12 months were significantly lower than those in the control group (p=0.009). Our data suggest that low-dose losartan therapy for normotensive patients with IgA nephropathy could reduce the amount of urinary protein and NAG excretion without affecting systemic blood pressure.",

    "62": "Conjunctival biopsies were obtained from the inferior fornix during routine cataract surgery from 20 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, who had received a monotherapy either with timolol or latanoprost, and from 10 non-glaucomatous patients. Specimens were investigated by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry using antibodies against MMP-1,-3, TIMP-2,-3 and CD 68 antibodies and by quantitative transmission electron microscopy.", 
    "63": "The number of collagen fibres was significantly decreased in latanoprost-treated conjunctival specimens compared with timolol-treated eyes (p<0.01) but showed no difference to controls. Amorphous material was increased in both treated groups compared with controls (p<0.001) but was less in latanoprost-treated specimens compared with timolol-treated eyes (p<0.001). Optically clear spaces, probably containing glycosaminoglycans, were significantly reduced in both treated groups-with less of a reduction in latanoprost-compared with timolol-treated eyes (p<0.001). A marked upregulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 and moderately increased staining for TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 was found in epithelial cells and subepithelial stromal cells of latanoprost-treated eyes. A moderate infiltration with macrophages and inflammatory cells was observed in timolol-treated eyes.", 
    "64": "Latanoprost-treated conjunctival specimens showed a decreased stromal collagen density and a less pronounced inflammatory infiltration. The upregulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 in latanoprost-treated eyes might explain the reduced extracellular matrix accumulation in the conjunctival stroma. Therefore, latanoprost therapy might have a more favourable effect on the outcome of glaucoma filtering surgery.", 
    "65": "A direct liquid chromatographic enantioselective separation of a set of beta-blocker enantiomers on the new immobilized and conventional coated amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) chiral stationary phases (Chiralpak IA and Chiralpak AD, respectively) was studied using methanol as mobile phase and ethanolamine as an organic modifier (100:0.1, v/v). The separation, retention and elution order of the enantiomers on both columns under the same conditions were compared. The effect of the immobilization of the amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) chiral stationary phase on silica (Chiralpak IA) on the chiral recognition ability was noted when compared to the coated phase (Chiralpak AD) which possesses a higher resolving power than the immobilized one (Chiralpak IA). A few racemates, which were not or poorly resolved on the immobilized Chiralpak IA were most efficiently resolved on the coated Chiralpak AD. However, the immobilized phase withstand solvents like dichloromethane when used as an eluent or as a dissolving agent for the analyte. The versatility of the immobilized Chiralpak IA in monitoring reactions performed in dichloromethane using direct analysis techniques without further purification, workup or removal of dichloromethane was studied on a representative example consisting of the lipase-catalyzed irreversible transesterification of a beta-blocker using either vinyl-acetate or isopropenyl acetate as acyl donor in dichloromethane as organic solvent.", 
    "66": "In this work a simple, fast, sensitive and selective flow-based procedure for the chemiluminometric determination of carvedilol, a recent non-cardioselective beta-blocker with noteworthy antioxidant activity, is proposed. The developed methodology takes advantage of the antioxidant capacity of carvedilol to inhibit the chemiluminescence response resulting from the oxidation of luminol by hypochlorite, by acting as a hypochlorite scavenger. The analytical process was implemented in a multi-pumping flow system that employs multiple solenoid actuated micro-pumps as the only active components. These acted as solution insertion, propelling and commuting units assuring an easily controlled, low cost, compact and reliable analytical system. A linear working range for carvedilol concentrations ranging from 1.2x10(-7) to 3.0x10(-6)moll(-1) (r>0.999, n=6), was obtained, with a detection limit of 8.7x10(-9)moll(-1). The system handles about 65 samples per hour yielding precise results (R.S.D.<1.3%, n=10). Recoveries within 95 and 104% were obtained.", 
    "67": "The shapes of elution profiles are often significantly influenced by the presence of strongly adsorbed additives in the mobile phase. This aspect needs to be considered in quantitative optimization of preparative chromatography. The theoretical study carried out here is based on available thermodynamic information for the enantiomers of three beta-blockers, alprenolol, propranolol, and atenolol, on a teicoplanin chiral stationary phase (Chirobiotic T) using methanol/acetonitrile as the mobile phase and acetic acid/triethylamine as the additive. The properties of this strong additive made it possible to tune the binary elution profiles in any combination of the following apparent band shapes: anti-Langmuir/anti-Langmuir, anti-Langmuir/Langmuir and Langmuir/Langmuir. Optimization of the productivity and yield, when performing repetitive batch injections, was investigated using the equilibrium dispersive model. We show that it is important to consider the invisible additive perturbation peak when defining the cycle time and therefore a model-based optimization needs to take this into account. Furthermore, both productivity and yield could be improved for the two unusual shape combinations in comparison to the traditional Langmuir/Langmuir case.", 
    "68": "A method was developed to perform the screening, quantification and confirmation of the five beta-blockers, propranolol, carteolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, and sotalol, in human urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In sample preparation, conjugated and unconjugated beta-blockers in urine were extracted separately, and the extracts were combined. The extracts were derivatized with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) and N-methyl-bis(trifluoroacetamide) (MBTFA). The optimal conditions of GC-MS were established, and the progresses of screening by selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode and confirmation by full scan (SCAN) mode were completed. At last, the quantification curves of the five beta-blockers in spiked urine were established by SIM mode. The limits of detection were 0.2 -1.0 ng/mL. Overall recoveries were 70.5% - 103.4%, and the relative standard deviations were lower than 15%. In addition, the method was successfully applied to the analysis of the positive urine of propranolol, and the urinary excretion curve was also established accordingly. It is significant to prohibit the abuse of beta-blockers in doping control.", 
    "69": "This paper introduces four different modes of multiple-injection CZE (MICZE). The validity of these MICZE models was evaluated by the experimental data. Prior to the application of MICZE, the electrophoretic conditions are developed in the single-injection mode by adjusting different experimental parameters such as pH, type and concentration of buffer additives and temperature. Based on the migration time difference (Deltatmig) between the analyte and the internal standard or injection marker, one or more MICZE modes can be employed. The injection marker is added to the sample to compensate for injection-volume fluctuations. The inter-plug distance is regulated by applying an electrical field over the capillary for a short period of time between each injection. After the final injection, the separation is completed by electrophoresis for a time period corresponding to that in the single-injection mode.",

Drug release from PLGA-based microparticles in such agarose gels was compared to that measured in agitated bulk fluids (\"standard\" method).", 
    "72": "NMR analysis revealed that the drug diffusivity was almost independent of the hydrogel concentration, despite of the significant differences in the systems' mechanical properties. This is due to the small size of the drug molecules/ions with respect to the hydrogel mesh size. Interestingly, the theoretically predicted drug concentration-distance-profiles could be confirmed by independent experiments. Most important from a practical point of view, significant differences in the release rates from the same batch of PLGA-based microparticles into a well agitated bulk fluid versus a semi-solid agarose gel were observed.",

    "74": "The authors investigated whether computerized parameters quantifying ventricular repolarization delay, heterogeneity, and instability characterize individuals who developed drug-induced Torsades de Pointes. Assessing an individual's propensity to Torsades de Pointes when exposed to a QT-prolonging drug is challenging because baseline QT prolongation has limited predictive value. Five-minute digital 12-lead electrocardiograms were acquired at baseline and after a sotalol challenge in 16 patients who had a history of Torsades de Pointes in the context of a QT-prolonging drug and 17 patients who did not have such history. Computerized measurements of QTc, T peak to T end intervals (TpTe), TpTe/QTc, and QT variability were implemented, and novel quantifiers of ventricular repolarization heterogeneity from the early (ERD) and late (LRD) part of the T wave were investigated. Compared with electrocardiograms of patients without a history of Torsades de Pointes, the baseline electrocardiograms of patients with a history of Torsades de Pointes had a longer QTc and an increased repolarization heterogeneity of the early part of the T wave (ERD30%: 44 +/- 13 vs 35 +/- 8 ms, P = .02). On sotalol, the electrocardiograms from individuals with Torsades de Pointes revealed a delay of the terminal part of the T wave that was not present in patients without Torsades de Pointes (TpTe: 27 +/- 40 vs -2 +/- 21 ms, P = .02; LRD70%: 20 +/- 29 vs 2 +/- 4 ms, P = .04). Results suggest that the electrocardiogram abnormalities characterizing patients with a history of Torsades de Pointes are (1) an increased repolarization heterogeneity at baseline and (2) a sotalol-induced prolongation of the terminal part of the T wave.",

    "76": "In this double-blind, multicentre trial, 694 patients with hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure [BP] > or = 95 and < 110 mmHg) were randomised to once-daily aliskiren 150 mg (n=231), atenolol 50 mg (n=231) or the combination (150/50 mg; n=232) for six weeks, followed by a further six weeks on double the initial doses of aliskiren and atenolol. Efficacy (reduction from baseline in mean sitting systolic and diastolic BP) and tolerability of study treatments were assessed; plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured in a subset of patients.", 
    "77": "At Week 12 endpoint, aliskiren, atenolol and aliskiren/atenolol lowered systolic and diastolic BP from baseline by 14.3/11.3, 14.3/13.7 and 17.3/14.1 mmHg, respectively. Systolic BP reductions with aliskiren/atenolol were significantly greater than those with aliskiren (p=0.039) or atenolol (p=0.034) alone, and diastolic BP reductions were greater than with aliskiren alone (p<0.001). Diastolic BP changes were larger with atenolol than with aliskiren (p=0.003, correlating with the large reductions in pulse rate (> 10 bpm) observed with atenolol. Aliskiren, atenolol and aliskiren/atenolol reduced geometric mean PRA from baseline by 65%, 52% and 61%, respectively. In patients with moderate or high baseline PRA (> or = 0.65 ng/ml/hour), PRA was reduced to low levels (< 0.65 ng/ml/hour) at Week 12 endpoint in a greater proportion of patients receiving aliskiren (11/15 patients, 73.3%) or aliskiren/atenolol (18/23, 78.3%) than with atenolol (10/21, 47.6%). Aliskiren treatment was associated with numerically lower rates of adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events compared with atenolol or combination treatment, and unlike atenolol was not associated with bradycardia.", 
    "78": "Direct renin inhibition with aliskiren may be an appropriate substitute for beta-blocker treatment in patients with uncomplicated hypertension. Aliskiren also represents an attractive option for dual therapy with atenolol to improve systolic BP/pulse pressure reductions and BP control with maintained tolerability compared with atenolol alone.", 
    "79": "PP-24 is a newly synthesized putative beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The objective of the study was to the evaluate beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of PP-24 on isolated rat preparations: right atria, uterus and colon. Effects on the rat ECG and renal hypertension (induced by left renal artery ligation) were also investigated. Treatment with PP-24 (3 and 10 mg kg(-1)) for 7 days in rats with renal hypertension significantly reduced the mean atrial blood pressure. Single i.v. injections of isoprenaline (0.3, 1 and 3 microg kg(-1)) alone in normal anaesthetized rat caused hypotension and tachycardia, while PP-24 alone produced dose-dependent falls in mean aterial pressure and bradycardia. Pretreatment of anaesthetized rats with test compounds significantly blocked the hypotension response but not the tachycardia induced by isoprenaline (0.3, 1 and 3 microg kg(-1)). The pA(2) of PP-24 to beta(1)-, beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors was 7.72 +/- 0.082, 7.40 +/- 0.082 and 6.39 +/- 0.16, respectively. The beta(1)/beta(2) selectivity ratio was 2.08, compared with 1.27 for propranolol and 39.17 for atenolol. It is concluded that PP-24 possesses beta-adrenoceptor blockade activity but with non-specific affinity for beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes. The rank order of potency of the antagonists for beta(1)-adrenoceptors was atenolol > PP-24 > propranolol. The antihypertensive activity of PP-24 in rats with renal hypertension appears to be due to blockade of beta-adrenoceptors.",

For patients prescribed a statin, ACEI/ARB, beta-blocker, and all 3 of these medications after the hospital discharge, we evaluated medication adherence by determining the proportion of days covered (PDC) for each medication in the subsequent year.", 
    "82": "Our cohort consisted of a total of 33 646 patients. Adherence rates for statins and beta-blockers, but not ACEI/ARB, increased significantly over time but remained suboptimal. For example, among those patients that received a statin after discharge, 38.6% were fully adherent with therapy in 1995 in contrast to 56.2% in 2003 (p value for trend<0.001). Of patients prescribed all 3 of statin, beta-blocker, and ACEI/ARB, 29.1% and 46.4% were fully adherent in 1995 and 2003, respectively (p value for trend<0.001).",

Despite these improvements, rates of non-adherence to these highly effective therapies remain extremely high. Given the health and economic consequences of non-adherence, the development of cost-effective strategies to improve medication adherence should be a clear priority.", 
    "84": "beta-Adrenergic blockers, particularly atenolol, are often recommended for the tachycardia and hypertension that accompany hyperthyroidism; however, the effects of monotherapy with atenolol on both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) have not been reported. Twenty hyperthyroid cats with SBP > or = 160 mmHg were studied retrospectively to investigate the SBP and HR lowering effects of atenolol. Median pre-treatment SBP and HR for all cats were 186.5 mmHg and 231 beats/min, respectively. All cats were treated with atenolol at a dosage of 1-2 mg/kg PO q 12h for a minimum of 5 days prior to reassessment and treatment with radioactive iodine. SBP and HR both decreased following atenolol therapy in this group of cats to median values of 171.5 mmHg (P=0.0088) and 185/min (P=0.0003). However, when successful clinical control of hypertension was defined as a post-treatment SBP < 160 mmHg, atenolol monotherapy was ineffective in 70% of the cases. There was no statistically significant difference in baseline serum total thyroxine or atenolol dosage between clinical responders and non-responders. While atenolol effectively reduces HR in most cats with hyperthyroidism, elevated SBP is poorly controlled, and the addition of another vasodilator such as amlodipine or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is needed to treat associated hypertension.", 
    "85": "Several factors are incriminated in the genesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). To elucidate their interplays, we utilized a diabetic rat model with nephropathy (SHR/NDmcr-cp). This model is characterized by hypertension, obesity with the metabolic syndrome, diabetes with insulin resistance, and intrarenal AGE accumulation. Various therapeutic approaches were used to achieve renoprotection. Caloric restriction corrects metabolic abnormalities and protects the kidney without correcting hypertension. Anti-hypertensive agents, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and calcium channel blocker, lower blood pressure to the same extent, but only ARBs protect the kidney without changes in metabolic abnormalities. Glycemic control is better with insulin than with pioglitazone. The plasma insulin level is increased by insulin but decreased by pioglitazone which worsens the obesity. Nevertheless, pioglitazone provides renoprotection unlike insulin, perhaps as a result of the up-regulation of TGF-beta by hyperinsulinemia. Cobalt up-regulates the expression of a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and its downstream genes (erythropoietin, VEGF, HO-1). It protects the kidney without correcting hypertension and metabolic abnormalities. Altogether, renoprotection is not necessarily associated with blood pressure or glycemic control. By contrast, it is almost always associated with a decreased AGE formation. AGE reduction may reflect a decreased oxidative stress as it is concomitant with a marked reduction of oxidative stress markers.",

    "95": "The transparent bodies of see-through medaka fish has led to their use as models for in vivo cell and tissue imaging. However, these fish may also prove useful as models for pathological processes. Accumulating reports show that pathology in fish is similar to that in mammals, including humans. In this study, pathological characterization, comparison of data from rodents and in vivo pharmacological analyses of isoproterenol (Iso)-treated fish were performed. Larval fish showed cardiac hypertrophy-like changes after exposure to > 10 microg/ml Iso for more than one day. Hearts of Iso-treated fish had a larger size and a thicker wall, especially in the ventricle, compared with normal hearts. Several messenger RNA levels dose-dependently increased in Iso-treated fish in a manner similar to that in rodents. Symptoms that accompany mammalian cardiac hypertrophy, such as congestion, were also observed. Propranolol (Pro), a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker (AR), significantly protected the increase in heart rate and volume and other simultaneous symptoms induced by Iso exposure. Athletic capability, measured by optomotor response, showed a dose-dependent decrease after Iso treatment, but was protected by Pro. In contrast, metoprolol (Met) and butoxamine (Btx), selective beta1- and beta2-AR blockers, had little effect in this analysis. These results show that Iso-treated fish develop pathologies analogous to those found in mammalian systems, suggesting that medaka fish can be used for investigation of cardiac hypertrophy; however, drug affinity differences should be considered between species.", 
    "96": "Inflammation is implicated in several medical conditions that are sexually dimorphic, including depression, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmunity, and presumably cancer progression. Here we studied the effects of the proinflammatory agent, LPS, on MADB106 lung tumor retention (LTR), and sought to elucidate underlying mechanisms and sexual dimorphism. F344 male and female rats were administered with LPS (0.001-1mg/kg i.v.) simultaneously with tumor cell inoculation, and treated with a beta-blocker (nadolol, 0.2-0.3mg/kg s.c.), a COX inhibitor (indomethacin, 4mg/kg s.c.) or both drugs. To study the role of NK cells, numbers and cytotoxicity of marginating-pulmonary NK cells were studied, and selective in vivo NK-depletion was employed. Serum levels of corticosterone, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were also assessed. The findings indicated that LPS increased LTR in both sexes, but 10-fold higher doses were needed in females to reach the increase evident in males. Additionally, nadolol and indomethacin reduced the effects of LPS, more so in males. In vivo NK-depletion and ex vivo NK activity studies suggested that LPS affected LTR through both NK-independent and NK-dependent mechanisms, the latter mediated through prostaglandin release in males. Corticosterone, IL-6, and TNF-alpha responses to LPS were sexually dimorphic, but were not associated with LPS or drugs' impacts on LTR. Overall, our findings demonstrate sexual dimorphism in LPS-induced elevated susceptibility to MADB106 experimental metastasis, and in potential humoral underlying mechanisms. Further studies are needed to elucidate additional immunological and non-immunological mediators of these dimorphisms, as well as to assess their involvement in other sexually dimorphic pathologies that are associated with inflammation.",

They improve survival after a non cardiac surgery in patients at high cardiovascular risk. Atenolol should nevertheless be avoided for primary cardiovascular protection in patients with hypertension older than 55 yrs.

When considering pregnancy, women with pre-existing chronic hypertension should be screened for target organ damage, especially renal dysfunction. Since blood pressure usually decreases until midpregnancy and returns to, or exceeds, prepregnancy values in the third trimester, antihypertensive treatment can sometimes be withdrawn in low-risk women, and reintroduced if needed. Recommended antihypertensive drugs are labetalol, methyldopa and nifedipine. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and atenolol must be avoided. The occurrence of superimposed preeclampsia should be detected by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation. Preeclampsia is a multisystem maternal and fetal syndrome. The risk of preeclampsia is slightly reduced by low-dose aspirin and by calcium supplementation in women with low dietary calcium intake. For early-onset preeclampsia, expectant management improves perinatal outcomes, but requires close maternal and fetal surveillance. For acute management of severe hypertension, intravenous labetalol and oral nifedipine are recommended. Delivery is indicated in the presence of signs of maternal or fetal distress. Magnesium sulfate is indicated for the prophylaxis and the treatment of eclampsia. Most antihypertensive agents are compatible with breast feeding. Early-onset or severe preeclampsia increase the risk of remote chronic hypertension and cardiovascular disease.",

We also aimed to investigate the post-effects of angiotensin II blockage treatment on clusterin expression and to compare these with apoptosis. Five groups of Wistar albino rats were used: First group consisted of healthy controls; the second group included the untreated STZ-diabetics; 30 days of irbesartan or perindopril treated STZ-diabetics formed the third and the fourth groups, respectively; while the subjects receiving a combined treatment with irbesartan and perindopril for 30 days consisted the fifth group. TUNEL method for apoptosis and immunohistochemical staining for TGF-beta1, alpha-SMA, clusterin-beta and clusterin-alpha/beta antibodies were performed. Apoptotic cells especially increased in the kidney tubuli of untreated diabetic group and on the contrary, a significant decrease was observed in the group that received a combined drug treatment. While sCLU was increased in the glomeruli and tubuli of the untreated diabetic group, it was decreased in all the treated groups. An increase in the nCLU immunoreactivity was observed in the podocytes, mesangial cells, and the injured tubule cells of the untreated diabetic group. nCLU immunopositive cells were decreased in all treated diabetic groups. In addition to this, the distribution of nCLU was similar to the distribution of apoptotic cells in the diabetic groups. Our results indicate that sCLU expression in diabetic nephropathy was induced due to renal tissue damage, and the nCLU expression increase in renal tubuli was related to apoptosis. Although irbesartan and perindopril prevented further renal injury in diabetes, a combined application of low-dose ACEI and AT1R blockers revealed more efficient measures, by means of renal damage prevention.",

We report on 14 patients who were among a group of 618 migraine sufferers who received a new preventative treatment. These 14 patients developed an increase in the frequency of their migraine attacks that was possibly induced by this new prophylactic treatment. The clinical description of the migraine attacks remained the same but the frequency of the attacks of migraine without aura was dramatically increased. This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a possible precipitation of attacks of migraine without aura with a prophylactic treatment. There is no link with a specific class of prophylactic treatment. We hypothesize that the migraine sufferers who experienced aggravation after the new prophylactic drug had been introduced had a paradoxical decrease in the induction threshold for cortical spreading depression (CSD). Mechanisms of such a decrease are unknown and are probably multifactorial, but changes in serotonin neurotransmission have been experimentally demonstrated to modify cortical excitability and favour CSD. The aggravation was described only for attacks without aura. However, with only 14 patients, it is not possible to predict whether suffering from that the type of migraine is a factor that predisposes a patient to aggravation. While additional cases are necessary, physicians should be aware of the possibility that prophylactic treatment may exacerbate migraine attacks.",

Based on these observations, the use of cholestyramine has been tried. The present study evaluates the effect of low doses of cholestyramine as an adjunctive therapy in the management of hyperthyroidism. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 45 patients with newly diagnosed hyperthyroid Graves' disease were randomly assigned into the following treatment protocols: group I, cholestyramine 2 g BID, methimazole and propranolol; group II, cholestyramine 1 g BID, methimazole and propranolol; group III, placebo powder, methimazole and propranolol. The fixed dose of methimazole (30 mg/d) and propranolol (40 mg/d) was used. The study period was 4 weeks. Serum total triiodothyronine and free thyroxin were measured at baseline, and at the ends of the second and the fourth week of the study. The serum thyroid hormone levels decreased more rapidly and to a greater extent in the cholestyramine-treated groups. All of the patients in group I had achieved euthyroid state at the end of the study. We conclude that low dose of cholestyramine is an effective and well-tolerated adjunctive agent in the treatment of hyperthyroid Graves' disease.", 
    "112": "One of the most frequent precipitating factors for attacks of porphyria is the administration of drugs. Use of drugs with porphyrinogenic potential often worsens the condition and often poses a therapeutic dilemma. A 23-year-old female patient presented to the casualty room with abdominal pain, chest pain and vomiting. Her past medical history was significant with episodes of generalised abdominal pain. The patient was initially treated for her abdominal pain and vomiting. She developed seizures and was treated with diazepam and phenytoin. Based on the positive investigation reports (positive urine porphyrins, elevated urine ALA and positive porphobilinogen) and symptoms, a diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) was done. Before the diagnosis of AIP was made, the patient was treated with drugs which are not considered to be safe in porphyric patients, such as phenytoin, metoclopramide, and diclofenac. The use of these drugs probably contributed to the initial worsening of the patient's clinical condition. After the diagnosis of AIP was made, the patient was treated with safer alternatives; gabapentin as the antiepileptic agent, promethazine as antiemetic, and propanalol as the antihypertensive agent. Withdrawal of the unsafe agents and symptomatic management with the safer alternatives contributed to the recovery of the patient. Along with the case report and the observations made on the various drugs used in the patient, the importance of the various information sources available on the safety potential of these agents is discussed. The observations with the drugs used in our case will be a useful addition to the existing information on the safety of these agents.",

A percentage of subjects with hyperactivity to treadmill stress test show LVH to echocardiogram. This paper aims at evaluating neurohumoral influence over these subjects by comparing drugs that block both the RAS and the SNS. In a 1-year open protocol, 195 normotensive subjects, with hyperactivity to treadmill stress test and LVH, were randomly assigned to supervised physical exercise, rilmenidine 1 mg day(-1), atenolol 50 mg day(-1), enalapril 10 mg day(-1) or losartan 50 mg day(-1). Changes in left ventricular mass index (LVMI), measured by means of echocardiogram, were the primary end point. Changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at rest and peak effort were also evaluated. Enalapril significantly brought LVMI down in relation to the basal value (28.2%; n=36) similarly to losartan (26.9%; n=42); P>0.05. However, both were more efficient than physical exercise (2.9%; n=39), rilmenidine (5.1%; n=38) and atenolol (7.2%; n=40); P<0.001. There was no significant difference in SBP reduction at rest and peak effort in groups assigned to atenolol, enalapril and losartan; P>0.05. In such groups, reduction was greater than in groups assigned to physical exercise and rimenidine; P<0.001. In conclusion, drugs that block RAS were more efficient in reducing LVH than physical exercise and drugs that block SNS, and such reduction took place regardless of SBP level reduction at rest and peak effort.",

However, the specific contribution of novelty to the effects of enrichment is unclear. Here, we show that repeated daily exposure to single novel odorants and not to an enriched but stable olfactory environment improves short-term olfactory memory and neurogenesis in the mouse olfactory bulb. In addition, these positive effects are mediated by noradrenalin as they are blocked by a noradrenergic receptor antagonist. These data suggest that novelty recognition and noradrenergic mechanisms are crucial in mediating neural plasticity induced by olfactory enrichment.",

Modification of IS by postconditioning and the effects of daily carvedilol treatment were measured, together with reperfusion injury - salvage kinase activities. Four weeks after CS induction, any reduction of IS by postconditioning was lost, whereas it reduced IS in rats without CS. In the hearts without CS, postconditioning activated both the ERK and Akt pathway. However, in the hearts with CS, postconditioning failed to do so. In hearts with CS plus daily carvedilol treatment, postconditioning reduced IS compared with the hearts without carvedilol, although postconditioning did not activate the Akt and ERK pathways.",

Defined by an unintentional weight loss exceeding 7.5% of body mass during more than 6 months, it is presented by the association of nutritional deficiencies, digestive and/or urinary losses as well as metabolic abnormalities causing fat and lean mass loss and is associated to a poor prognosis. The pathophysiology of cachexia and heart failure presented some similarities associating especially neuro-hormonal activation, a cortisol/DHEA ratio imbalance, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines activation. Currently the treatment of cachexia is mainly preventive, based on ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers therapy and physical reconditioning.

According to the second one, HF is consequence of the overactivity of endogenous endocrine systems such as the renin-angiotensin aldosterone or the autonomic system. Angiotensin-II blockage is actually the first option in the medical treatment of HF. Since it reduces cardiac and vascular remodelation, synthesis of collagen and improves the endothelial function. Preceding to this option one can find the use of beta adrenergic blochers.

P-gp was reconstituted in egg-phosphatidylcholine (PhC) liposomes with or without cholesterol, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), alpha-tocopherol (alpha-Toc) or 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-chromanol (PMC). Basal and verapamil-induced ATPase activities were studied with an enzymatic assay. Membrane fluidity was characterized with diphenyl-hexatriene anisotropy measurements and membrane affinity by equilibrium dialysis. DPPC (70% mol/mol) decreased the fluidity of PhC bilayers to the same level as 20% cholesterol. PMC (20%) and alpha-Toc (20%) decreased the fluidity to lesser extents. alpha-Toc and PMC, but not DPPC increased the verapamil membrane affinity. While 20% cholesterol strikingly enhanced the basal ATPase activity, none of the other constituents had a similar effect. In contrast, verapamil stimulation of P-gp ATPase activity was not only enabled by cholesterol but also by alpha-Toc and DPPC. PMC had no effect. In conclusion, cholesterol exerts distinct effects on basal and verapamil-induced ATPase activity. The influence on basal ATPase activity is sterol-specific while its effect on verapamil-induced ATPase activity is unspecific and not related to its influence on membrane fluidity and on verapamil membrane affinity.",

In Michaelis-Menten plots, R- and S-PL glucuronidation by human liver microsomes showed sigmoidal kinetics whereas the kinetics of enantiomeric PL glucuronidation by cynomolgus monkey liver microsomes was monophasic. The Km, Vmax and CLint values of cynomolgus monkey liver microsomes were generally higher than the S50, Vmax and CLmax values of human liver microsomes in R- and S-PL glucuronidation. The glucuronidation of R- and S-PL was catalyzed by at least 3 UGT isoforms: UGT1A9, UGT2B4 and UGT2B7. Michaelis-Menten plots for R- and S-PL glucuronidation by UGT1A9 were monophasic, whereas the kinetics of UGT2B7 showed sigmoidal curves. Enantiomeric R-PL glucuronidation by UGT2B4 showed sigmoidal kinetics, whereas S-PL glucuronidation displayed monophasic kinetics. UGT1A9 showed remarkable stereoselectivity in Vmax and CLint values of R-PL < S-PL. These findings demonstrate that the profiles of enantiomeric PL glucuronidation in human and cynomolgus monkey liver microsomes are largely different and suggest that the human hepatic UGT isoforms UGT1A9, UGT2B4 and UGT2B7 play distinctive roles in enantiomeric PL glucuronidation.",

Studies also suggest that long-term increases in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity may contribute to hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cardiac remodeling in heart failure. However, our understanding of the role of cardiac sympathetic nerves in chronic models of cardiovascular disease has been limited by inadequate experimental approaches. The present study was conducted to develop a surgical method to surgically denervate the sympathetic nerves of the rat heart for long-term cardiovascular studies. We characterized the effect of cardiac sympathetic denervation on basal levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) and the responses to a chronic administration of atenolol, a beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist. Rats were instrumented with telemetry transmitters for continuous recording of MAP and HR. After a 4-day baseline period, the rats were subjected to bilateral stellate ganglionectomy (SGX; n=9) or sham surgery (Sham; n=8). Seven days following SGX or Sham, the rats were administered atenolol for 5 days, followed by a 7-day recovery period. Following a transient decrease, SGX had no effect on basal MAP but decreased HR compared with baseline and Sham rats. Five days of atenolol treatment decreased MAP similarly in SGX and Sham rats. Atenolol resulted in a marked bradycardia in Sham rats but had a neglible effects on HR in SGX rats. The measurement of the content of cardiac catecholamines in all cardiac chambers at the end of the study verified a successful sympathetic denervation. This study confirms that bilateral SGX is a useful method to study the contribution of cardiac sympathetic nerves on the regulation of cardiac function. Moreover, these results suggest that cardiac sympathetic nerves are relatively unimportant in maintaining the basal level of MAP or the depressor response to atenolol in conscious, unrestrained rats.", 
    "151": "Two analytical methods have been developed for simultaneous quantification of bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide in combined pharmaceutical dosage form using spectrophotometer. Excellent simplicity, accuracy, precision and economy were achieved by the assay. The method I was based upon simultaneous equations whereas the method II was based upon multicomponent mode of analysis of the instrument. For both these methods, 0.1 N NaOH was used as solvent. In this solvent, bisoprolol fumarate showed absorbance at 224 nm and hydrochlorothiazide at 273 nm. Linearity lies in the concentration range of 3-21 microg/ ml for bisoprolol fumarate and 3-18 microg/ ml for hydrochlorothiazide. The methods were validated statistically and by recovery studies.",

    "154": "NGF injected into the TMJ sensitized by a prior TMJ injection of carrageenan but not into the intact TMJ induced a significant nociceptive behavior. Co-injection of the non-specific Trk receptor antagonist k252A with NGF 1 h after the TMJ injection of carrageenan significantly reduced NGF-induced spontaneous nociception supporting the Trk receptor activation in this nociceptive effect. Blockade of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin before the TMJ injection of carrageenan did not reduce NGF-induced nociception. Co-administration of carrageenan with the beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118.55 but not with the beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol significantly reduced NGF-induced nociception. The injection of NGF the TMJ sensitized by a previous TMJ injection of epinephrine also induced nociceptive behavior.", 
    "155": "Taken together, these results indicate that NGF can induce TMJ nociception during TMJ inflammation. Moreover, the expression of this nociceptive response seems to depend on the synergic activity of NGF and sympathetic amines released during TMJ inflammation acting on beta2-adrenergic receptors.",

Treatment with beta-blockers decreased U-wave amplitude at high heart rates. CPVT patients had longer TPE intervals than unaffected subjects at high heart rates, and beta-blocker treatment shortened their TPE intervals.",

The objective of the present study was to examine the role of nebivolol in modulating peroxynitrite species-induced inflammation and apoptosis after renal warm ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of nebivolol on the renal warm ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats treated with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. After right nephrectomy, nebivolol was administered for 15 days. On the 16(th) day, ischemia was induced in contra lateral kidney for 45 min, followed by reperfusion for 24 hr. Renal function, inflammation, and apoptosis were estimated at the end of 24 hr reperfusion. Nebivolol improved the renal dysfunction and reduced inflammation and apoptosis after renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. In conclusion, nebivolol shows potent anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties due to its NO-releasing property. These findings may have major implications in the treatment of human ischemic acute renal failure.",

    "183": "The antidepressant desipramine inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine (NE), leading to activation of both pre- and postsynaptic adrenergic receptors, including alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, and beta-2 subtypes. However, it is not clear which adrenergic receptors are involved in mediating its antidepressant effects. Treatment of mice with desipramine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) produced an antidepressant-like effect, as evidenced by decreased immobility in the forced-swim test; this was antagonized by pretreatment with the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist idazoxan (0.1-2.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Similarly, idazoxan, administered peripherally (0.5-2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or centrally (1-10 microg, i.c.v.), antagonized the antidepressant-like effect of desipramine in rats responding under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) 72-s schedule, ie, decreased response rate and increased reinforcement rate. By contrast, pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonists propranolol and CGP-12177 or the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist prazosin did not alter the antidepressant-like effect of desipramine on DRL behavior. The lack of involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors in mediating the behavioral effects of desipramine was confirmed using knockout lines. In the forced-swim test, the desipramine-induced decrease in immobility was not altered in mice deficient in beta-1, beta-2, or both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. In addition, desipramine (3-30 mg/kg) produced an antidepressant-like effect on behavior under a DRL 36-s schedule in mice deficient in both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. As antagonism of presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors facilitates NE release, which potentiates the effects of desipramine, the present results suggest that postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors play an important role in its antidepressant effects.", 
    "184": "In this paper we report about the biodegradation of the beta-blocker atenolol and the hypoglycaemic agent glibenclamide. The biodegradation tests were performed in batch reactors under aerobic conditions, using as inocculums sewage sludge from a conventional activated sludge treatment and a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor. Pharmaceuticals were used as sole carbon sources, spiked at 50ng/L and 10mg/L concentrations. Quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled to ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatograph was used for the screening and the structural elucidation of biodegradation products. A microbial metabolite of atenolol with [M+H](+) at 268 was detected in the positive electrospray ionization mode. This new compound was determined to be a product of microbial hydrolysis of the amide of the parent compound. Biodegradation of glibenclamide by activated sludge proceeded via bacterial hydroxylation of the cyclohexyl ring, which resulted in formation of metabolite with a protonated molecule, [M+H](+)=510. MS(3) experiments performed by hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap (QqLIT) mass spectrometry coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography enabled further structural elucidation of the identified metabolites. Moreover, the highly sensitive QqLIT instrument in the MRM mode enabled the detection of parent compounds and one of the microbial metabolites identified in real wastewater samples. The methodology used in this study permitted for the first time the identification and detection of biodegradation product of beta-blocker atenolol in real wastewater samples.",

Essential fatty acids (EFAs) and their long-chain metabolites: gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-GLA (DGLA), arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and other products such as prostaglandins E1 (PGE1), prostacyclin (PGI2), PGI3, lipoxins (LXs), resolvins, protectins including neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) prevent platelet aggregation, lower blood pressure, have anti-arrhythmic action, reduce LDL-C, ameliorate the adverse actions of homocysteine, show anti-inflammatory actions, activate telomerase, and have cytoprotective properties. Thus, EFAs and their metabolites show all the classic actions expected of the \"polypill\". Unlike the proposed \"polypill\", EFAs are endogenous molecules present in almost all tissues, have no significant or few side effects, can be taken orally for long periods of time even by pregnant women, lactating mothers, and infants, children, and adults; and have been known to reduce the incidence cardiovascular diseases including stroke. In addition, various EFAs and their long-chain metabolites not only enhance nitric oxide generation but also react with nitric oxide to yield their respective nitroalkene derivatives that produce vascular relaxation, inhibit neutrophil degranulation and superoxide formation, inhibit platelet activation, and possess PPAR-gamma ligand activity and release NO, thus prevent platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular diseases. Based on these evidences, I propose that a rational combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and the co-factors that are necessary for their appropriate action/metabolism is as beneficial as that of the combined use of a statin, thiazide, a beta blocker, and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, folic acid, and aspirin. Furthermore, appropriate combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may even show additional benefits in the form of protection from depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and enhances cognitive function; and serve as endogenous anti-inflammatory molecules; and could be administered from childhood for life long.", 
    "186": "Escherichia coli is exposed to wide extracellular concentrations of Ca2+, whereas the cytosolic levels of the ion are subject to stringent control and are implicated in many physiological functions. The present study shows that extracellular Ca2+ controls cPHB [complexed poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] biosynthesis through the AtoS-AtoC two-component system. Maximal cPHB accumulation was observed at higher [Ca2+]e (extracellular Ca2+ concentration) in AtoS-AtoC-expressing E. coli compared with their DeltaatoSC counterparts, in both cytosolic and membrane fractions. The reversal of EGTA-mediated down-regulation of cPHB biosynthesis by the addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ was under the control of the AtoS-AtoC system. Moreover, the Ca2+-channel blocker verapamil reduced total and membrane-bound cPHB levels, the inhibitory effect being circumvented by Ca2+ addition only in atoSC+ bacteria. Histamine and compound 48/80 affected cPHB accumulation in a [Ca2+]e-dependent manner directed by the AtoS-AtoC system. In conclusion, these data provide evidence for the involvement of external Ca2+ on cPHB synthesis regulated by the AtoS-AtoC two-component system, thus linking Ca2+ with a signal transduction system, most probably through a transporter.",

PPARA genotype was also associated with differences in PPARalpha expression, with significantly increased mRNA levels in myocardial samples from normal hearts among GC heterozygotes compared with GG homozygotes (p = 0.04). Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of PPARalpha showed significantly reduced myocardial contractile and chronotropic responses to the beta-sympathomimetic dobutamine (p < 0.05) compared with wild-type littermates, supporting the hypothesis that increased PPARalpha levels result in a blunted beta-adrenergic response.",
