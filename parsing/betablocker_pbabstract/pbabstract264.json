In the present experiments, we investigated the effects of blockade of beta-NA adrenoceptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and in the region of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) on footshock- and cocaine-induced reinstatement. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) for 9 d and, after a 5-7 d drug-free period, were given extinction sessions followed by a test for footshock stress-induced (15 min of intermittent footshock, 0.8 mA) or cocaine-induced (20 mg/kg, i.p.) reinstatement. Before the test, different groups of rats were given bilateral infusions of one of four doses of a mixture of the beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptor antagonists betaxolol and ICI-118,551 (vehicle, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 nmol of each compound in 0.5 microliter) into either the BNST or CeA. We observed a dose-dependent reduction of stress-induced reinstatement after infusions into the BNST and a complete blockade of stress-induced reinstatement after infusions into the CeA at all doses tested. The same treatments did not block cocaine-induced reinstatement when given at either site. These data suggest that stress-induced NA activation in the BNST and in the region of the CeA is critical to relapse to drug seeking induced by stress but not to relapse induced by priming injections of cocaine, and we hypothesize that NA activity leads to activation of corticotropin-releasing factor neurons in these regions.", 
    "6": "We studied beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor (MR) expression and proliferative response in lymphocytes from animals under chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression (CMS animals). Animals were subjected to CMS (periods of food or water deprivation, changes in lighting conditions, tilted cage, etc.) for 12 weeks. CMS lymphocytes showed an altered mitogen-induced proliferation. CMS-B and -T lymphocytes showed an increment on beta-adrenoceptor number and on intracellular responses to a beta-agonist. CMS-T cells showed higher MR expression and lower cGMP responses than normal lymphocytes. MR were not detectable in normal B cells while CMS-B cells showed both MR expression and cGMP response. Beta and muscarinic stimulation influenced lymphocyte proliferative responses, in accordance with cAMP and cGMP responses. After 12 weeks of the CMS procedure, animals were treated with fluoxetine while the CMS procedure continued. Fluoxetine treatment reverted the alterations induced by CMS. These findings suggest a possible mechanism for the immune alterations found in depressive disorders and for the effect of fluoxetine treatment on immune response.", 
    "7": "One major risk to patients in the preoperative period is that of myocardial ischemia or infarction and cardiovascular death in high-risk patients. Historically, attempts to decrease the incidence of perioperative cardiac complications have focused on preoperative evaluation and identification of patients at risk for complications with referral for additional testing and/or revascularization. Evidence suggests that the use of perioperative beta-blockers in high-risk individuals can reduce the incidence of perioperative cardiac events. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has identified that the use of perioperative beta-blockers can reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality. The focus of this article is to describe the evidence supporting perioperative beta-blocker use, to discuss potential barriers to their use, and to propose a strategy to improve their use.", 
    "8": "The acute fish test is an animal test whose ecotoxicological relevance is worthy of discussion. The primary aim of protection in ecotoxicology is the population and not the individual. Furthermore the concentration of pollutants in the environment is normally not in the lethal range. Therefore the acute fish test covers solely the situation after chemical spills. Nevertheless, acute fish toxicity data still belong to the base set used for the assessment of chemicals. The embryo test with the zebrafish Danio rerio (DarT) is recommended as a substitute for the acute fish test. For validation an international laboratory comparison test was carried out. A summary of the results is presented in this paper. Based on the promising results of testing chemicals and waste water the test design was validated by the DIN-working group \"7.6 Fischei-Test\". A normed test guideline for testing waste water with fish is available. The test duration is short (48 h) and within the test different toxicological endpoints can be examined. Endpoints from the embryo test are suitable for QSAR-studies. Besides the use in ecotoxicology the introduction as a toxicological model was investigated. Disturbance of pigmentation and effects on the frequency of heart-beat were examined. A further important application is testing of teratogenic chemicals. Based on the results DarT could be a screening test within preclinical studies.", 
    "9": "Brief pressure ejection of solutions containing potassium, caesium or rubidium ions into stratum radiatum of the CA1 or CA3 regions of the hippocampal slice evoked a fast network oscillation. The activity evoked lasted approximately 3-25 s with the predominant frequency component being in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz), although beta frequency (15-30 Hz) and ultrafast (> 80 Hz) components could also be seen. The gamma frequency component of the oscillation remained constant, even when large changes in power occurred, and was synchronous across the CA1 region. Measurements with potassium ion-sensitive electrodes revealed that the network oscillation was accompanied by increases (0.5 to 2.0 mM) in the extracellular potassium concentration [K+]o. Bath application of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5; 50 microM) had no significant effect but the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isooxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor antagonist 2,3,-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulphonamide disodium (NBQX; 20 microM) caused a significant reduction (86.7 +/- 4.5 %) in the power in the gamma frequency range. Residual rhythmic activity, presumably arising in the interneuronal network, was blocked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. The putative gap junction blocker octanol caused a decrease in the power of the gamma frequency component of 75.5 +/- 5.6 %, while carbenoxolone produced a reduction of only 14 +/- 42 %. These experiments demonstrate that a modest increase in exogenous [K+]o in the hippocampus in vitro is sufficient to evoke a fast network oscillation, which is an emergent property of the synaptically and electrically interconnected neuronal network.", 
    "10": "We examined the effect of nipradilol on contraction of the posterior ciliary artery induced by high potassium or norepinephrine and on cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels in the posterior ciliary artery of dogs. Nipradilol caused dose-dependent relaxation of KCl-and norepinephrine-induced contractions of posterior ciliary artery. The relaxant effect of nipradilol on norepinephrine-contracted ciliary artery was significantly greater than that on KCl-contracted ciliary artery. In KCl-contracted ciliary artery, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME, 10(-4) M) did not alter the relaxant effect of nipradilol, whereas 1H-1,2,4-oxadiazolo-4,3-a-quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, 10(-6) M) significantly inhibited this effect. Ethacrynic acid at 10(-5) M, sulfasalazine at 10(-4) M and S-decylglutathione at 10(-4) M (glutathione S-transferase inhibitors) did not inhibit the relaxant effect of nipradilol. In addition, nipradilol produced dose-dependent increases in cGMP levels in the canine posterior ciliary artery. These findings indicate that nipradilol-induced vasorelaxation in the canine posterior ciliary artery occurs via stimulation of the guanylyl cyclase-cGMP pathway.", 
    "11": "Conversion of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and flutter (AFlt) to sinus rhythm results in a transient mechanical dysfunction of atria (atrial stunning). Methods used as a means of assessing atrial stunning, atrial stunning after conversion of atrial fibrillation/flutter, and the cause, mechanisms, determinants of the extent, and drugs affecting atrial stunning were examined.", 
    "12": "Studies on the subject, identified through a comprehensive literature search, were thoroughly evaluated.", 
    "13": "Left atrial (LA) stunning has been reported with all modes of conversion of AFib/AFlt to sinus rhythm. The incidence of LA stunning is 38% to 80%. Spontaneous echocardiographic contrast, LA appendage (LAA) flow velocities and emptying fraction, transmitral inflow velocity of atrial wave (A-wave), time-velocity integral of A-wave, and atrial filling fraction have been used as means of assessing LA stunning. The data on right atrial (RA) stunning are limited, but parallel findings have been reported in the right atrium. Atrial stunning does not develop after the unsuccessful attempts of cardioversion or on delivery of electric current to the heart without AFib/AFlt, and it is a function of the underlying AFib/AFlt manifesting at the restoration of sinus rhythm. Tachycardia-induced atrial myopathy and chronic atrial hibernation are suggested mechanisms. Duration of preceding AFib/AFlt, atrial size, and underlying heart disease are determinants of the extent of atrial stunning. Verapamil, dofetilide, and acetylstrophenathidine have been shown to attenuate or protect from atrial stunning in animal or small human studies. A comprehensive knowledge of atrial stunning would be helpful in selecting the patients for, and the duration of, anticoagulation therapy after cardioversion.", 
    "14": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of cardiac surgery and has been associated with increased incidence of other complications and increased hospital length of stay (LOS). Prevention of AF is a reasonable clinical goal, and, consequently, many randomized trials have evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for prevention of AF. To better understand the role of various prophylactic therapies against postoperative AF, a systematic review of evidence from randomized trials was performed.", 
    "15": "Fifty-two randomized trials (controlled by placebo or routine treatment) of beta-blockers, sotalol, amiodarone, or pacing were identified by systematic literature search. The 3 drug treatments each prevented AF with the following odds ratios (ORs): beta-blockers, 0.39 (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.52); sotalol, 0.35 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.49); and amiodarone, 0.48 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.61). Pacing was also effective; for biatrial pacing, the OR was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.71). The influence of pharmacological interventions on LOS was as follows: -0.66 day (95% CI, 2.04 to 0.72) for beta-blockers; -0.40 day (95% CI, 0.87 to 0.08) for sotalol; and -0.91 day (95% CI, 1.59 to -0.23) for amiodarone. The influence for biatrial pacing was -1.54 day (95% CI, -2.85 to -0.24). The incidence of stroke was 1.2% in all the treatment groups combined and 1.4% in controls (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.46 to 1.74).", 
    "16": "Beta-blockers, sotalol, and amiodarone all reduce risk of postoperative AF with no marked difference between them. There is evidence that use of these drugs will reduce LOS. Biatrial pacing is a promising new treatment opportunity. There was no evidence that reducing postoperative AF reduces stroke; however, data on stroke are incomplete.", 
    "17": "Heart failure is a common and disabling condition with a dismal prognosis. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has proven to be a valuable therapeutic strategy in this condition, with well-proven morbidity and mortality benefits. Nonetheless, ACE inhibitors provide incomplete blockade of the RAAS and also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin. Although increased levels of bradykinin may have haemodynamic advantages by contributing to vasodilatation, they may also be largely responsible for some of the adverse effects of ACE inhibitors. Angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists offer more complete blockade of the RAAS without the potentiation of bradykinin, and it was therefore hoped that they would provide even greater benefits for patients with heart failure. So far, much of the initial promise of the Ang II receptor antagonists in heart failure has not been realised. There has been no conclusive demonstration of their superiority to ACE inhibitors in their effects on morbidity and mortality, and their equivalence to ACE inhibitors has not been proven. The Ang II receptor antagonists have, however, proven to be better tolerated than ACE inhibitors and they are therefore likely to be a reasonable alternative for those patients with heart failure who cannot tolerate ACE inhibition. Recent evidence has indicated that the Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist valsartan is of value when used in patients already receiving either an ACE inhibitor or a beta-blocker, but has also suggested that giving all three drugs together is deleterious. Further evidence about the value of Ang II receptor antagonists in heart failure may be provided by further studies, of which several are currently ongoing.",

    "23": "Portal hypertension is a dramatic complication in liver cirrhosis by efraction of the varices localized more frequently in the esophagus. It has been an actual subject due to physiopathological research (endotelin system, nitric system etc), diagnosis (echoendoscopy, color Doppler), and therapeutically progress. Propranolol, available at a low cost, is efficient and unanimously accepted in the prophylactic treatment of medium and large varices which have never bled as well as in the hemorrhage due to variceal efraction which stopped therapeutically or spontaneously. This drug diminishes the risk of rebleeding. Besides the pharmacological treatment, terlipresine, octreotid, sclerotherapy and bandlegation are used in active hemorrhage due to variceal efraction. If this fails other methods for haemostasis are used: portosystemic transjugular shunt, mechanical tamponade, selective surgery and ideally hepatic transplant. Except for the hepatic transplant, none of the mentioned methods can improve the rate of survival in-patients, which depends on the state of the hepatic failure.", 
    "24": "The in vitro effect of propranolol (10(-3) M and 10(-4) M), a nonselective and extensively metabolized beta-adrenergic blocking agent, on rat liver drug metabolism in native and induced (with phenobarbital and beta-naphthoflavone [beta-NF]) microsomes was studied. The type of inhibition and the inhibitory constants of some cytochrome P450-dependent microsomal enzyme reactions (hexobarbital oxidation [HBO], ethylmorphine-N-demethylation [EMND], aniline hydroxylation [AH], ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylation [ECOD], ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylation [EROD] and penthoxyresorufin-O-dealkylation [PROD]) were estimated. The results showed that propranolol competitively inhibited AH activity in native microsomes. The type of inhibition was changed from competitive to noncompetitive in all other enzyme activities studied. This inhibition was more pronounced after phenobarbital induction in PROD (Ki = 0.11 +/- 0.01 mM), ECOD (Ki = 0.40 +/- 0.09 mM) and EMND (Ki = 0.59 +/- 0.1 mM), and after beta-NF induction in AH (Ki = 0.28 +/- 0.05 mM) and in HBO (Ki = 0.35 +/- 0.1 mM) in native microsomes. It was assumed that the noncompetitive type of inhibition is due to the covalent binding of reactive metabolites derived from propranolol to hepatic microsomal proteins. The competitive type of inhibition of AH suggested a common P450 isoenzyme in the metabolism of propranolol and aniline. Thus, in this study, propranolol has been found to be not only a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6 isoenzyme-dependent reactions, but also a nonspecific inhibitor of other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.", 
    "25": "Lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is common among older men and women, affecting 20%-30% of older men and women in general medicine practices. History and physical examination are insensitive measures of PAD. However, PAD can be noninvasively and reliably diagnosed in the office with the ankle-brachial index, a ratio of Doppler-recorded systolic pressures in the lower and upper extremities. An ankle-brachial index less than 0.90, consistent with PAD, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in addition to functional impairment. Drug therapy in PAD is directed at reducing the increased risk of cardiovascular events and improving walking impairment. Intensive atherosclerotic risk factor intervention and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended for reducing cardiovascular event rates in persons with PAD. Components of an effective exercise intervention and drug therapy to reduce claudication-related walking impairment in PAD are also reviewed.",

IOP was assessed daily or weekly by a tonometer in conscious rats. IOP was also assessed in both experimental groups at several intervals during the light-dark cycle.", 
    "28": "A single injection of hyaluronic acid induced an increase of IOP that lasted for 8 days (P < 0.01), whereas its chronic administration during 9 weeks induced a significant and sustained increase in IOP, compared with the eye injected with vehicle (P < 0.01). This hyaluronic acid-induced hypertension was significantly decreased by the application of 1 drop of brimonidine (0.2%), latanoprost (0.005%), or timolol (0.5%). Significant daily variations of IOP were observed in both control and hyaluronic acid-injected eyes, peaking during the dark phase (P < 0.001, ANOVA).",

THE COMBINED SERIES: Of 24 patients (12 women, mean age 71.8 years), 83% were older than 60 years. The duration of therapy before onset of delirium in 14 (58%) subjects was within one week; 23 of 24 patients were receiving therapeutic amounts of the drug (25-200 mg/day). Clinical features included confusion/disorientation in all subjects, agitation in 13, aggression in 6, visual hallucinations in 7, auditory hallucinations in 1, paranoid delusions in 3, vivid dreams in 2 and language disturbances in 3 persons. Bradycardia was reported in 4 cases, hypotension in 2, fatigue/tiredness in 3, Raynaud's phenomenon in 1 and skin rash in 1 patient.",

    "37": "Contrary to all other beta-blockers so far investigated, exercise had no effect on plasma concentrations of (R)- and (S)-carvedilol. We conclude that neither (R)- nor (S)-carvedilol is released from adrenergic cells during exercise, a feature that clearly distinguishes carvedilol from other beta-blockers. Thus, the human organism appears to handle (R)- and (S)-carvedilol differently than other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. This finding deserves further investigation on a molecular and cellular level in order to clarify these differences between the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol and other beta-blockers.", 
    "38": "Treatment of hypertension with beta-adrenergic blockers (BB) slightly increases plasma triglycerides and decreases high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. However, only little is known about BB-related lipid changes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), who usually a priori have decreased HDL cholesterol levels; and even less data exist on HDL subfraction cholesterol in these patients. We therefore quantified levels of lipids, lipoprotein lipids including HDL2 and HDL3 cholesterol, and apolipoproteins in 107 consecutive men undergoing elective coronary angiography. Of the 107 patients, 84 had angiographically established coronary atherosclerosis (>or=1 lesion with >or=50% narrowing, CAD+), and 23 had no major lesion (CAD-); 67 were taking ss1-selective BB (metoprolol or atenolol) for treatment of angina and/or hypertension and 40 were not. Patients using BB had significantly higher cholesterol levels than patients not using BB (5.99 +/- 0.93 vs. 5.63 +/- 1.07 mmol/l, mean +/- SD, p = 0.029). Their HDL cholesterol and HDL2 cholesterol levels were significantly lower (1.19 +/- 0.27 vs. 1.28 +/- 0.33 mmol/l, p = 0.048, and 0.22 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.18 mmol/l, p = 0.038, respectively). Accordingly, the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio was significantly higher in patients taking BB than in those not taking BB (5.23 +/- 1.27 vs. 4.68 +/- 1.63, p = 0.010). Considering CAD+ and CAD- patients separately, there was a trend towards lower HDL cholesterol and its subfractions with significantly lower HDL2 cholesterol in patients with BB in the CAD- group, suggesting a stronger dyslipidemic effect of BB in these patients with a priori normal or near normal baseline lipid levels.",

We hypothesized that infusion of small doses of dobutamine would reduce RWMAs and improve global ventricular function. Apical RWMAs were induced by local intracoronary boluses of 9.0 mg esmolol. Phase angles, effective stroke volume (SV), maximum SV, stroke work, and segmental shortening were compared among four left ventricular (LV) regions (apical, papillary, chordal, and basal) during baseline, dobutamine, esmolol, and dobutamine-esmolol treatments. The minimal global LV volume was designated as 0 degrees, and the cardiac cycle was divided into 360 intervals. Regional phase angles were defined as the distance (in degrees) that regional minimum volume differed from global minimal LV volume (end-systole). RWMA decreased blood pressure (92 +/- 2 mm Hg to 84 +/- 3 mm Hg) and increased LV end-diastolic pressure (1.8 +/- 0.5 mm Hg to 4.2 +/- 0.8 mm Hg). RWMA delayed regional contraction (-2.9 degrees +/- 1.6 degrees to 52.3 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees ) and decreased effective SV (2.3 +/- 0.4 mL to 1.6 +/- 0.3 mL) in the affected apical region but did not decrease maximal SV. Systemic infusion of dobutamine restored global LV function but failed to eliminate RWMA, as evidenced by decreased apical synchrony, effective SV, and stroke work. We concluded that systemic dobutamine restored global LV function but failed to correct RWMA.", 
    "51": "We examined the effect of systemic dobutamine on regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) induced by intracoronary esmolol infusion in eight anesthetized dogs. Esmolol dilated the heart and decreased regional synchrony of contraction. Dobutamine restored cardiac function but failed to correct the asynchrony of regional contraction caused by esmolol-induced RWMAs.", 
    "52": "In vivo microdialysis combined with high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection was used to monitor extracellular glutamate levels in the medial nucleus accumbens of Sprague-Dawley rats during their feeding behaviour. Consumption of a palatable new diet or a diet to which rats were previously exposed caused a decrease in extracellular level of glutamate in the nucleus accumbens during and after feeding. The presentation of an inedible object (a piece of rubber) instead of the expected food caused a marked increase in extracellular glutamate levels. In contrast, if the piece of rubber was presented to rats that did not expect food delivery, the extracellular level of glutamate remained unchanged during the rubber presentation. The feeding-induced decrease in the extracellular glutamate level did not depend on food deprivation and was completely prevented by intraaccumbal infusions through the dialysis probe of 10 mM D,L-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate (a glutamate uptake inhibitor). Intraaccumbal infusions of 10 microM S-(-)-raclopride L-tartrate (a D2/D3 dopamine receptor antagonist) or 1 microM tetrodotoxin (a voltage-dependent Na(+) channel blocker) also completely reversed the decrease in extracellular glutamate level in response to food intake. The D1/D5 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH-23390 (10 microM) administered into the nucleus accumbens had no significant effect on the feeding-induced decrease in extracellular glutamate level. From the data obtained we suggest that the decrease in the extracellular level of glutamate in the medial nucleus accumbens in response to feeding appears to arise from a temporal increase in glutamate uptake that is probably operated by dopamine inputs to the nucleus accumbens via D2/D3 receptors. Our findings also suggest that the dissociation between the expected biological value of a presented object and the reality might be an important determinant for regulation of glutamate release in this brain area during feeding behaviour.", 
    "53": "A randomised, cross-over, open study of bioequivalence between two different atenolol (CAS 29122-68-7) tablet formulations is presented. An in vitro comparative study between the two formulations was also performed. Both products meet the USP 23 (United States Pharmacopea) specification. The values of similarity factor (f2) and difference factor (f1) obtained ensure sameness or equivalence of the two dissolution curves. Twenty-four healthy volunteers (male/female) participated in the bioequivalence study. Each treatment was given as a single 100-mg tablet following an overnight fast. Atenolol concentrations in plasma were determined up to 30 h after treatment by HPLC. The pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-infinity, Cmax and Cmax/AUC0-infinity were tested for bioequivalence after logarithmic transformation of data and ratios of tmax were evaluated nonparametrically. The parametric analysis revealed the following test/reference ratios and their 90% confidence intervals (90% CI): 1.06 (0.99-1.13) for AUC, 1.07 (0.97-1.18) for Cmax, and 0.99 (0.94-1.07) for Cmax/AUC0-infinity. The 90% CI for tmax was 0.91-1.23. All parameters showed bioequivalence between both formulations. A discrete fall in both systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure was observed after the drug administration. The fall extent (approximately 11 mmHg in supine position) and the time course of both parameters after the drug administration was similar for both formulations. Minimal values for SBP and DBP were achieved at 6 h after the drug administration for both formulations. Heart rates were also reduced after the administration of both formulations of atenolol in a similar extent (12 b.p.m.) and following a similar time profile (i.e. maximal reductions were observed between 1 and 3 h after the drug administration). It can be concluded that both formulations are equivalent in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "54": "The authors analyze the interaction of timolol maleate (Timoptol, L\u00e9civa Prague) with free amino acids with regard to the effect on intraocular pressure. The different colour reaction of an amino acid mixture with Timoptol, the decline of radioactivity of Na[I125] tyrosine with Timoptol and the formation of 8 radioactive fractions after addition of Timoptol to Na[I125] indicate: a) the specificity of interaction of each amino acid with Timoptol; b) suggest that between Timoptol and free amino acids a firm covalent bond develops with the concurrent development of a new biologically active metabolite. Evidence of the presence of a new metabolite is important from the aspect of understanding and more accurate definition of the action of Timoptol in tissue structures of the eye and thus also for possible effective treatment of glaucoma.", 
    "55": "Patients with infrequent attacks of supraventricular arrhythmia may benefit from self administration of antiarrhythmic drugs on an 'as required' basis. The oral cavity is easily accessible and the potential for rapid absorption exists. The effects of ionization state and sodium glycocholate on the ex vivo transport of sotalol and flecainide across porcine buccal mucosa were studied. The permeated amounts at 3 h (Q) and fluxes (J) of sotalol in an aqueous solution at pH 7.4 and 9.0 were similar. At pH 7.4, in contrast to pH 9.0, the addition of 1.0% (w/v) sodium glycocholate decreased Q and J four and five fold. Flecainide base in propylene glycol resulted in a nine and 12 fold higher Q and J as compared with an aqueous solution of flecainide acetate at pH 5.8. The presence of sodium glycocholate reduced the transport rate of the flecainide base. However, Q and J were increased 110 and 75 fold by adding 1.0% (w/v) sodium glycocholate to a solution of flecainide acetate at pH 5.8. Sodium glycocholate seems to be an effective penetration enhancer for the buccal absorption of the more polar ionized form of flecainide in an aqueous solution. Sodium glycocholate does not seem to improve the transport of sotalol.", 
    "56": "The purpose of this study was to develop Pluronic F127 (PF127) based formulations of timolol maleate (TM) aimed at enhancing its ocular bioavailability. The effect of isotonicity agents and PF127 concentrations on the rheological properties of the prepared formulations was examined. In an attempt to reduce the concentration of PF127 without compromising the in situ gelling capabilities, various viscosity enhancing agents were added to PF127 solution containing 0.5% TM. The viscosity and the ability of PF127 gels to deliver TM, in vitro, in absence and presence of various viscosity enhancing agents were also evaluated. At the used concentration, some of the examined isotonicity agents had effect on the viscosity of TM gel. However, the viscosity of gel increased as the PF127 concentrations increased. The viscosity of formulations containing thickening agents was in the order of PF-MC 3%>PF-HPMC 2%>PF-CMC 2.5%>PF127 15%. The slowest drug release was obtained from 15% PF127 formulations containing 3% methylcellulose. In vivo study showed that the ocular bioavailability of TM, measured in albino rabbits, increased by 2.5 and 2.4 fold for 25% PF127 gel formulation and 15% PF127 containing 3% methylcellulose, respectively, compared with 0.5% TM aqueous solution.", 
    "57": "Radiofrequency ablation is considered to be the treatment of choice in patients with ventricular dysfunction related to incessant supraventricular tachycardia. However, reservations regarding its use in infants and children prompted us to try alternative strategies for this group.", 
    "58": "Eight children (age range: 1 day to 10 years) were diagnosed to have tachycardia-related ventricular dysfunction in the past 6 years. They presented with symptoms of palpitation, dyspnea and/or generalized swelling over the body of 3 months to 2 years'duration. The cardiothoracic ratio at presentation was 64% (52%-70%) and ejection fraction was 22.2% (15%-45%). In 7 patients tachycardia was diagnosed to be ectopic atrial and in 1 it was permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia. Six of these children were managed with intravenous/oral amiodarone in combination with digoxin (3) and/or propranolol (2). In one child addition of amiodarone to digoxin and propranolol led to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and amiodarone was withdrawn. Only one child underwent radiofrequency ablation as the first choice because regular follow-up was not possible due to logistic reasons. Sinus rhythm with normalization of ventricular function was achieved in 6 of the 7 children treated medically. One child continued to have frequent episodes of tachycardia and underwent successful radiofrequency ablation of a high right atrial ectopic focus. Two out of the 6 patients on amiodarone could be managed with only digoxin and propranolol after their ventricular function had returned to normal. A third patient relapsed on stopping amiodarone and underwent successful radiofrequency ablation of a left atrial ectopic tachycardia.", 
    "59": "Short-term amiodarone in combination with digoxin/propranolol is a safe and effective treatment strategy for infants/children with tachycardiomyopathy. Control of tachycardia is achieved in the majority, leading to recovery of ventricular function. This approach may avoid unnecessary ablations in children or at least postpone it till the procedure would be safer.", 
    "60": "In patients without established cardiac disease, the occurrence of premature ventricular complexes without sustained ventricular tachycardia is more an annoyance than a medical risk, and treatment is not required. In contrast, patients with established heart disease and premature ventricular complexes have a higher likelihood of developing ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. These patients should be treated with a beta blocker or class I antiarrhythmic drug. Treatment of arrhythmias in pregnant women is rarely needed. When treatment is required, amiodarone should be avoided, and beta blockers should be used with caution, because these agents have been associated with fetal growth retardation. The most important rhythm abnormality in athletes is ventricular tachycardia associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. If the presence of the disease is confirmed by echocardiography, beta-blocker therapy is necessary, and these patients should be limited to participation in nonstrenuous sports. Acute arrhythmias in children with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can be treated with adenosine. Radiofrequency ablation of the accessory pathway can provide long-term control.", 
    "61": "Family physicians frequently encounter patients with symptoms that could be related to cardiac arrhythmias, most commonly atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardias. The initial management of atrial fibrillation includes ventricular rate control to provide adequate cardiac output. In patients with severely depressed cardiac output and recent-onset atrial fibrillation, immediate electrical cardioversion is the treatment of choice. Hemodynamically stable patients with atrial fibrillation for more than two days or for an unknown period should be assessed for the presence of atrial thrombi. If thrombi are detected on transesophageal echocardiography, anticoagulation with warfarin for a minimum of 21 days is recommended before electrical cardioversion is attempted. Patients with other supraventricular arrhythmias may be treated with adenosine, a calcium channel blocker, or a short-acting beta blocker to disrupt reentrant pathways. When initial medications are ineffective, radiofrequency ablation of ectopic sites is an increasingly popular treatment option.", 
    "62": "Treatments administered to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially when used in multiple combinations, are not free of interactions and side effects that can potentially impair health-related quality of life (HRQL). We studied HRQL and its relationship with treatment in a group of 441 patients with stage II or III COPD (age: 66.6 (SD: 8.3) years; FEV1: 32.4% (SD: 8.1%)) using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 12-item short form (SF-12) Health Survey. The most prescribed drugs were ipratropium bromide (87.5%), inhaled corticosteroids (69.4%) and short-acting beta-2 agonists (64.9%). Patients with stage III of the disease were receiving more drugs, particularly short-acting beta-2 agonists (p = 0.002) and inhaled corticosteroids (p = 0.031). The use of theophyllines was associated with a worse total SGRQ score (beta = 4.49; p < 0.001), although this negative association decreased with advanced age. A trend towards worse SGRQ scores was observed with the use of high doses of long-acting beta-2 agonists (beta = 3.22; p = 0.072). Patients receiving three drugs or more presented worse total SGRQ scores than patients receiving fewer drugs (beta = 6.1, p < 0.001; and beta = 7.64, p < 0.001, respectively). These findings suggest that the use of multiple drugs in the treatment of patients with COPD is associated with worse total SGRQ scores. The effect of drugs, their dosages and associations with other drugs on HRQL merit further research.", 
    "63": "Silent myocardial ischemic episodes as well as decreased heart rate variability (HRV) indices are associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients with coronary artery disease. Nipradilol, which is a nonselective beta-adrenergic and nitrate-like vasodilator anti-anginal agent developed in Japan, may ameliorate silent myocardial ischemia, while it also improves exercise tolerance and HRV indices in patients with chronic stable angina.", 
    "64": "To investigate the effect of nipradilol (6 mg daily) on silent myocardial ischemic episodes and HRV indices, and to study its effect on the relationship between them, 24 patients with chronic stable angina underwent exercise treadmill testing and a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG). The study protocol utilized a single blind, 4-week placebo-controlled design. The HRV indices from ambulatory ECG included mean RR (ms), SDNN (ms), SDANN (ms), SD (ms), rMSSD (ms), pNN50 (%); frequency analysis of HRV consisted of total (ms, 0.01-1.00 Hz), low (ms, 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high (ms, 0.15-0.40 Hz) components.", 
    "65": "Nipradilol significantly decreased the mean heart rate at submaximal and maximal exercise and the mean pressure rate product at submaximal and maximal exercise. It significantly improved exercise-induced maximal ST segment depression from -1.7 +/- 0.6 mm to -1.1 +/- 0.7 mm (p < 0.05). Silent myocardial ischemic episodes recorded during the 24-hour ambulatory ECG significantly decreased after nipradilol administration. Nipradilol also significantly influenced several HRV indices as well as the relationship between silent myocardial ischemic episodes and the HRV indices. Nipradilol significantly increased SD, rMSSD, pNN50, total spectra, low frequency spectra and high frequency spectra. In addition, nipradilol significantly decreased the LF/HF ratio from 1.7 (1.5-2.0) to 1.5 (1.3-1.8). These effects of nipradilol on HRV indices concomitantly occurred with the reduction in silent myocardial ischemic episodes.", 
    "66": "Nipradilol was found to effectively improve the episodes of silent myocardial ischemia as well as exercise-induced ischemia probably due to its beta-blocking properties and not nitrate-like actions. In addition, nipradilol also had a favorable effect on the HRV indices.", 
    "67": "The Fontan procedure has allowed to improve the outcome of complex congenital cardiopathy involving single ventricle. A better understanding of the systemic venous circulation has favored bicavo-bipulmonary derivation instead of atrio-pulmonary derivation. However, in spite of the improvement in surgical procedures, post-operative arrhythmias still occur with an increasing rate during follow-up reaching 40 to 50% of the patients in some series. We report a series of 52 patients of which 92% presented a severe atrial arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter) during a 6-year follow-up. The outcome was worse in case of classic or modified Fontan (n=15) or direct dicavo-bipulmonary procedures (n=7). The non-modified Fontan group was characterized by a lower functional class (63% NYHA class I or II), more refractory atrial arryhthmias (37%), more deaths or transplanted patients (26%). Amiodarone was very effective in this context as opposed to the failure of class 1 anti-arrhythmic drugs. However, low dosage amiodarone in combination with a beta-blocker is recommended taking into account the important rate of amiodarone-induced side effects (53%). Atrial arrhythmia ablation was unsuccessful (8/10 failures). Anti-arrhythmic surgery (N=3) has been incompletely evaluated. In summary, transformation of failing Fontan procedures into bicavo-bipulmonary derivations seems to offer the best outcome at the price of a high surgical risk.", 
    "68": "Tumor cell membranes have multiple components that participate in the process of metastasis. The present study investigates the physical association of beta1-integrins and Kv1.3 voltage-gated potassium channels in melanoma cell membranes using resonance energy transfer (RET) techniques. RET between donor-labeled anti-beta1-integrin and acceptor-labeled anti-Kv1.3 channels was detected on LOX cells adherent to glass and fibronectin-coated coverslips. However, RET was not observed on LOX cells in suspension, indicating that molecular proximity of these membrane molecules is adherence-related. Several K(+) channel blockers, including tetraethylammonium, 4-aminopyridine, and verapamil, inhibited RET between beta1-integrins and Kv1.3 channels. However, the irrelevant K(+) channel blocker apamin had no effect on RET between beta1-integrins and Kv1.3 channels. Based on these findings, we speculate that the lateral association of Kv1.3 channels with beta1-integrins contributes to the regulation of integrin function and that channel blockers might affect tumor cell behavior by influencing the assembly of supramolecular structures containing integrins.",

The Q-T(end) interval, the Q-T(peak) interval and the interval between T(peak) and T(end) (T(p-e)), representing TDR, were measured and averaged from 87-lead ECGs and corrected by Bazett's method (corrected Q-T(end) interval [cQT(e)], corrected Q-T(peak) interval [cQT(p)] and corrected interval between T(peak) and T(end) [cT(p-e)]). The dispersion of cQT(e) (cQT(e)-D) was obtained among 87 leads and was defined as the interval between the maximum and minimum values of cQT(e).", 
    "72": "Propranolol in the absence of epinephrine significantly prolonged the mean cQT(p) value but not the mean cQT(e) value, thus decreasing the mean cT(p-e) value in both LQT1 and LQT2 patients; the differences with propranolol were significantly larger in LQT1 than in LQT2 (p < 0.05). The maximum cQT(e), minimum cQT(e) and cQT(e)-D were not changed with propranolol. Propranolol completely suppressed the influence of epinephrine in prolonging the mean cQT(e), maximum cQT(e) and minimum cQT(e) values, as well as increasing the mean cT(p-e) and cQT(e)-D values in both groups.", 
    "73": "Beta-blockade under normal sympathetic tone produces a greater decrease in TDR in the LQT1 form than in the LQT2 form, explaining the superior effectiveness of beta-blockers in LQT1 versus LQT2.

    "74": "To determine if different subtypes of mu-opioid receptors were involved in antinociception induced by endomorphin-1 and endomorphin-2, the effect of pretreatment with various mu-opioid receptor antagonists beta-funaltrexamine, naloxonazine and 3-methylnaltrexone on the inhibition of the paw-withdrawal induced by endomorphin-1 and endomorphin-2 given intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) were studied in ddY male mice. The inhibition of the paw-withdrawal induced by i.c.v. administration of endomorphin-1, endomorphin-2 or DAMGO was completely blocked by the pretreatment with a selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist beta-funaltrexamine (40 mg/kg), indicating that the antinociception induced by all these peptides are mediated by the stimulation of mu-opioid receptors. However, naloxonazine, a mu1-opioid receptor antagonist pretreated s.c. for 24h was more effective in blocking the antinociception induced by endomorphin-2, than by endomorphin-1 or DAMGO given i.c.v. Pretreatment with a selective morphine-6 beta-glucuronide blocker 3-methylnaltrexone 0.25mg/kg given s.c. for 25 min or co-administration of 3-methylnaltrexone 2.5 ng given i.c.v. effectively attenuated the antinociception induced by endomorphin-2 given i.c.v. and co-administration of 3-methylnaltrexone shifted the dose-response curves for endomorphin-2 induced antinociception to the right by 4-fold. The administration of 3-methylnaltrexone did not affect the antinociception induced by endomorphin-1 or DAMGO given i.c.v. Our results indicate that the antinociception induced by endomorphin-2 is mediated by the stimulation of subtypes of mu-opioid receptor, which is different from that of mu-opioid receptor subtype stimulation by endomorphin-1 and DAMGO.",

    "79": "Travoprost, a highly selective and potent analogue of the prostaglandin PGF(2)(alpha), has recently been approved and marketed as a topical ocular hypotensive agent for the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma. Following absorption into the eye, the free acid form of travoprost interacts with the endogenous FP prostanoid receptor to enhance aqueous humor outflow and lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Travoprost is distinguished from other marketed prostaglandin analogues in that it is a full agonist at the prostaglandin receptor. It is also highly selective with little or no affinity for other prostanoid or non-prostanoid receptors in the eye. Travoprost provides robust lowering of IOP with little diurnal fluctuation and results in low target pressures in a large percentage of patients. In controlled clinical trials, travoprost 0.004% o.d. used as monotherapy produced greater IOP reduction than timolol 0.5% b.i.d. and equal or greater reduction than latanoprost 0.005%o.d. Travoprost 0.004% was also shown to be an effective adjunctive agent offering an additional 5 - 7 mmHg IOP reduction in patients inadequately controlled on timolol 0.5%. Subgroup analysis of a large Phase III trial revealed travoprost 0.004% to be significantly more effective at lowering IOP in African American patients by almost 2 mmHg compared to non-African Americans. Moreover, a higher percentage of African American patients responded to travoprost 0.004% and reached lower target pressures than with either latanoprost 0.005% or timolol 0.5%. Travoprost is a very stable compound, maintaining its efficacy following exposure to extremely low and high temperatures, repeated freezing and thawing and exposure to light. Throughout all clinical trials, travoprost was found to be safe and well-tolerated with very few (< 5%) discontinuations due to adverse events. Travoprost 0.004% represents a clinically significant advance for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, offering superior IOP reduction and diurnal control, especially among African American patients, in a safe, well-tolerated, stable formulation.", 
    "80": "The pharmacotherapy currently recommended by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association for heart failure (HF) is a diuretic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and (usually) digitalis. This current treatment of HF may be improved by optimising the dose of ACEI used, as increasing the dose of lisinopril increases its benefits in HF. Selective angiotensin receptor-1 (AT(1)) antagonists are effective alternatives for those who cannot tolerate ACEIs. AT(1) antagonists may also be used in combination with ACEIs, as some studies have shown cumulative benefits for the combination. In addition to being used in Stage IV HF patients, in whom it has a marked benefit, spironolactone should be studied in less severe HF and in the presence of beta-blockers. The use of carvedilol, extended-release metoprolol and bisoprolol should be extended to severe HF patients as these agents have been shown to decrease mortality in this group. The ancillary properties of carvedilol, particularly antagonism at prejunctional beta -adrenoceptors, may give it additional benefits to selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists. Celiprolol and bucindolol are not the beta-blockers of choice in HF, as they do not decrease mortality. Although digitalis does not reduce mortality, it remains the only option for a long-term positive inotropic effect, as the long-term use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors is associated with increased mortality. The calcium sensitising drug levosimendan may be useful in the hospital treatment of decompensated HF to increase cardiac output and improve dyspnoea and fatigue. The antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone should probably be used in patients at high risk of arrhythmic or sudden death, although this treatment may soon be superseded by the more expensive implanted cardioverter defibrillators, which are probably more effective and have fewer side effects. The natriuretic peptide nesiritide has recently been introduced for the hospital treatment of decompensated HF. Novel drugs that may be beneficial in the treatment of HF include the vasopeptidase inhibitors and the selective endothelin-A receptor antagonists but these require much more investigation. However, disappointing results have been obtained in a large clinical trial of the tumour necrosis factor alpha antagonist etanercept, where no likelihood of a difference between placebo and etanercept was observed. Small clinical trials with recombinant growth hormone to thicken ventricles in dilated cardiomyopathy have given variable results.", 
    "81": "Beta-adrenergic blockade has provided one of the major pharmacotherapeutic advances of the 20th century. Beta-blockers are first-line drugs for the management of systemic hypertension, used alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Drugs in the beta-blocking class have the common property of blocking the binding of catecholamines to beta-adrenergic receptor sites; however, there are significant pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences between the individual agents that are of clinical importance. Among these differences are the completeness of gastrointestinal absorption, the degree of hepatic first-pass metabolism, lipid solubility, protein binding, brain penetration, concentration within the cardiac tissue, rate of hepatic biotransformation, and renal clearance of drug and/or metabolites. Long-acting formulations of existing beta-blockers are currently in use, and ultra-short-acting agents are also available. Age, race, cigarette smoking and concomitant drug therapy can also influence the pharmacokinetics of beta-blocking drugs. The wide interpatient variability in plasma drug concentrations observed with beta-blockers makes this parameter unreliable in routine patient management. Despite the pharmacokinetic differences among beta-blockers, these drugs should always be titrated to achieve the desired individual patient response.", 
    "82": "Due to the potential for the transmission of infectious diseases with the homologous transfusion of blood products, there has been an increased interest in measures to limit intraoperative blood loss and avoid the need for homologous transfusion during high-risk surgical procedures including spinal surgery. Controlled hypotension (also referred to as deliberate or induced hypotension), defined as a reduction of systolic blood pressure to 80 to 90 mm Hg, a reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 50 to 65 mm Hg or a 30% reduction of baseline MAP, is one technique that has been used to limit intraoperative blood loss. In the adult population, several agents have been used alone or in combination for controlled hypotension including the inhalational anesthetic agents, direct-acting vasodilators such as nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) and nitroprusside, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and calcium channel antagonists. Despite clinical studies that have clearly demonstrated a reduction in blood loss with controlled hypotension when compared with the normotensive state and despite potential theoretical issues with each agent, there are no definitive studies demonstrating the preferred pharmacologic agent. When considering the pediatric-aged patient, studies have reported the use of the inhalational agent sevoflurane, the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine as well as various vasodilators including sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, fenoldopam, and alprostadil for controlled hypotension. Sevoflurane offers the advantages of easy dosage titration, no need for an additional intravenous infusion as well as providing anesthesia in addition to controlled hypotension. Disadvantages include a slightly higher cost than some of the intravenous agents and the inability to monitor evoked potentials with high sevoflurane concentrations. Whereas sodium nitroprusside, nicardipine and fenoldopam all provide the desired level of hypotension in pediatric-aged patients, nitroglycerin was not effective in this age group of patients in one study. When comparing nicardipine and sodium nitroprusside, nicardipine offers the potential advantages of fewer episodes of excessive hypotension, less rebound tachycardia and, in one study, less blood loss. Although fenoldopam has been shown to be effective, cost issues may limit is widespread application for this technique. The pharmacologic profile of dexmedetomidine indicates that this drug has potential in controlled hypotension and clinical data are needed to define its role.", 
    "83": "Two simple and sensitive indirect spectrophotometric methods for the assay of propranolol hydrochloride (PPH) and piroxicam (PX) in pure and pharmaceutical formulations have been proposed. The methods are based on the oxidation of PPH by a known excess of standard N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and PX by ceric ammonium sulfate (CAS) in an acidic medium followed by the reaction of excess oxidant with promethazine hydrochloride (PMH) and methdilazine hydrochloride (MDH) to yield red-colored products. The absorbance values decreased linearly with increasing concentration of the drugs. The systems obeyed Beer's law over the concentration ranges of 0.5 - 12.5 and 0.3 - 16.0 microg/ml for PPH, and 0.4 - 7.5 and 0.2 - 10 microg/ml for PX with PMH and MDH, respectively. Molar absorptivity values, as calculated from Beer's law data, were found to be 1.36 x 10(4) and 2.55 x 10(4) l mol(-1) cm(-1) for PPH, and 2.08 x 10(4) and 2.05 x 10(4) l mol(-1) cm(-1) for PX with PMH and MDH, respectively. The common excipients and additives did not interfere with their determinations. The proposed methods have been successfully applied to the determinations of PPH and PX in various dosage forms. The results obtained by the proposed methods compare favorably with those of official methods.",

    "86": "A 26-year-old man from Vietnam had weight loss, tachycardia, palpitations and heat intolerance for five months. Episodic leg and arm weakness developed three months after debut of symptoms. The second patient, a 23-year old woman from the Philippines, had had episodic leg weakness in the evenings after dinner for three weeks. Her attacks resolved spontaneously overnight. Physical examination of both patients revealed tachycardia and symmetrical proximal weakness involving both arms and legs. ECG and electrolyte analysis indicated a severe hypokalaemia; thyroid function tests showed hyperthyroidism. Both patients were diagnosed as having Graves' thyrotoxicosis and TPP. They were initially treated with propranolol and subsequently with carbimazole. The first patient had recurrence of thyrotoxicosis and paralysis after 16 months, whereas the second patient has remained symptom-free.",

    "88": "A critical review of the literature on the effects of antihypertensive drugs on the fetus in pregnant women is presented. The survey covers the alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists, beta-blockers including topical eye medications, alpha-beta blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The lack of data on angiotensin II receptor blockers is noted although effects are considered to be similar to those reported with ACE inhibitors and therefore to be avoided. Analysis of the literature underscores that some antihypertensive drugs can be used safely at certain stages of pregnancy, while others are suspect and to be avoided at all costs. The lack of placebo-controlled studies on the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy due to ethical considerations is discussed against the background of the pressing need to treat these women despite the possible deleterious effects of antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "89": "This study was designed to examine changes of hemorheological parameters in essential arterial hypertension subjects following antihypertensive drug therapy. Eighty two female subjects were enrolled, and sub-divided into two groups based upon their high shear whole blood viscosity being lower (L) or higher (H) than normal controls. Equal numbers of L and H subjects were then treated for four weeks with one of four agents: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-inhibitor, Spirapril - 6 mg/day); calcium antagonist (Isradipin - 5 mg/day); beta-1-blocker (Talinolol - 100 mg/day); diuretic (Indapamide - 1.5 mg/day). Both prior to and following drug treatment for six weeks, hemorheological measurements included plasma viscosity; high and low shear whole blood viscosity, hematocrit, fibrinogen and RBC aggregation. Treatment with each of the four drugs significantly (p<0.05) reduced blood pressure in both the L and H groups. However, the hemorheological effects of antihypertensive drug therapy differed markedly between groups: plasma and whole blood viscosity were significantly elevated in the L groups whereas these parameters were significantly decreased in the H groups. Fibrinogen levels and RBC aggregation decreased in both groups, whereas hematocrit was unaffected. These results thus suggest that the rheologic effects of antihypertensive drug therapy depend strongly on the initial, pre-treatment status of the subject, and that for some subjects, such therapy can result in adverse hemorheological alterations.", 
    "90": "The osteoactive factor, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), influences osteoblast activity and bone function. We recently characterized a Smad-independent TGF-beta1-induced Ca(2+) signal in human osteoblasts (HOB) and demonstrated its importance in cell adhesion. Here, we further elucidate the role of the TGF-beta1 Ca(2+) signal in the mechanics of HOB adhesion. Osteoblast interaction with fibronectin (FN) through alpha5beta1 integrin is principally responsible for osteoblast-substrate adhesion. Our results show that the TGF-beta1 intracellular Ca(2+) signal is responsible, in part, for stimulation of alpha5 integrin expression, but not beta1 integrin or FN expression. Increased alpha5 integrin protein and mRNA expression was seen as early as 12 h after TGF-beta1 treatment, but was inhibited by cotreatment with nifedipine, a Ca(2+) channel blocker. TGF-beta1 increased both FN and beta1 integrin protein production within 48 h, independent of nifedipine cotreatment. Immunofluorescence observations revealed that TGF-beta1 increased alpha5 integrin staining, clustering, and colocalization with the actin cytoskeleton, effects that were blocked by nifedipine. The TGF-beta1 Ca(2+) signal, a pathway crucial for HOB adhesion, enhances alpha5 integrin expression, focal contact formation, and cytoskeleton reorganization. These early events are necessary for osteoblast adhesion; thus they determine the fate of the cell and ultimately affect bone function.", 
    "91": "Thirty patients with chronic heart failure after conventional treatment for two weeks with cardiac diuretic and vasodilator were divided into two groups. There was addition of betaloc into Group A, but Group B kept the original treatment plan for 8 weeks. Group C consisted of 16 normal controls. The results showed that: 1. The level of plasma endothelin(ET), norepinephrine(NE), atrial natriuretic peptide(ANP) in Group A and B were higher than those in Group C. 2. The decreasing degrees of ET, NE, ANP, heart function score and the increasing degrees of CI and LVEF in Group A were more than those in Group B. 3. The change of ET was related to the changes of the others. Therefore, the beta-blocker may be associated with the decrease of the plasma concentration of ET, NE and ANP and improve heart function. It is considered that the degree of change of plasma ET may be the simple and reliable index which evaluate the degree of improving heart function.",

    "97": "This study examines the mechanisms by which the standardised ethanolic extract of propolis induces relaxation of the guinea-pig trachea in-vitro. In guinea-pig trachea with or without epithelium and contracted by histamine, the propolis extract caused reproducible and graded relaxation, with a mean EC50 value of 3.8 or 10.5 microg mL(-1) and Emax of 100%, respectively. The propolis extract-induced relaxation was markedly reduced (26+/-9 and 96+/-3%) when guinea-pig tracheas were exposed to Krebs solution containing elevated K+ in the medium (40 or 80 mM). Pre-incubation of guinea-pig tracheas with tetraethylamonium (100 mM) or with 4-aminopyridine (10mM) reduced the propolis extract-induced relaxation by 31+/-10% and 28+/-2%. Likewise, apamin (0.1 microM), charybdotoxin (0.1 microM) or iberiotoxin (0.1 microM) caused marked inhibition of propolis extract-mediated relaxation in guinea-pig trachea (percentage of inhibition: 65+/-3%, 60+/-5% and 65+/-9%, respectively). Also, glibenclamide (1 microM) inhibited the relaxant response caused by the propolis extract by 57+/-4%. Omega-conotoxin GIVA (0.1 microM) or capsaicin (1 microM) produced small but significant inhibition (30+/-5% or 47+/-7%, respectively) of the propolis extract-induced relaxation. The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) antagonist D-p-Cl-Phe6,Leu17[VIP] porcine (0.1 microM) inhibited relaxation by 55+/-5%, while propranolol (1 microM) induced a parallel rightward displacement (about 20 fold) of the propolis extract concentration-response curve. Finally, the propolis extract-induced relaxation was inhibited by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-N(G)-nitroarginine (L-NOArg, 100 microM) (48+/-6%), and by the soluble guanylatecyclase inhibitormethylene blue (10 microM) (37+/-6%), whilethe moreselectivesoluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolol[4,3-alquinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, 1 microM) produced only a parallel (about 3 fold) rightward displacement of the propolis extract concentration-response curve. Collectively, these results support the notion that the propolis extract-mediated relaxation in the guinea-pig trachea involves the release of nitric oxide, probably from sensory neurons, besides the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and activation of Ca2+- and ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Furthermore, the stimulation of beta2-adrenergic and VIP receptors also seems to account for its relaxant action.", 
    "98": "The effect of two kinds of 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, nicardipine hydrochloride and nifedipine, on the disposition of carvedilol, was studied in rats. Blood samples were assayed for carvedilol levels using solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography. The plasma carvedilol concentration was found to be significantly higher, and the area under the concentration-time curve up to 24 h (AUC0-->24) was 6.7 and 3.0 times higher after simultaneous oral administration of 20 mg kg(-1) carvedilol with 40 mg kg(-1) nicardipine hydrochloride, or with 40 mg kg(-1) nifedipine, respectively, than after administration of carvedilol alone. The pharmacokinetic interaction between carvedilol and dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers is thought to be attributable to vasodilator-induced changes in hepatic first-pass metabolism, inhibition in the absorption barrier by P-glycoprotein and in the metabolism of carvedilol.",

A cohort of 3,085 patients was recruited, with a mean age of 64.5 years. The major indication for use was hypertension (55% of the cohort), the indication was not specified in 33% of patients. 80% of GPs expressing an opinion rated mibefradil as effective. The major reason for stopping was withdrawal from the market (2,342 patients). The commonest reported adverse events and reasons for stopping were malaise/lassitude, dizziness, edema and headache. Seven clinically serious reports of bradycardia/collapse were considered to be possible adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to mibefradil. All were in the elderly (> 65 years), 6 were considered to be a result of possible drug interactions. In total, 11 possible drug interactions occurred. Nine (8 reports of bradycardia and 1 of syncope) involved beta-blockers. Another, a report of collapse and severe bradycardia, occurred in a patient who had started a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker within 24 hours of stopping mibefradil and the other was a report of palpitations and dyspnea in a patient on concomitant digoxin and sotalol.

This is especially true for those patients with frequent migraines who are in danger of developing drug-induced headaches. Migraine prophylaxis should be taken in consideration in patients who suffer from 7 or more migraine days per months in spite of all non-pharmacological efforts. When choosing a prophylactic drug not only efficacy but tolerability and safety for long-term intake should be considered. Prophylactic drugs used to be classified as drugs of first, second and third choice. According to this step care model treatment was started with a drug of first choice and only in case of lack of efficacy or adverse events a drug of lower choice was selected. Today, in contrast to the traditional step care a stratified care is favored. Treatment is individualized based on an assessment of the patients' medical needs, on comorbidity, the migraine phenotype and most important the individual situation of the patient in life. The paper gives an overview of the efficacy and tolerability of drugs used in migraine prophylaxis.", 
    "108": "Cellular mechanisms of adenosine include a direct effect on the activation of the adenosine-sensitive potassium current (I(K,Ado)) and an indirect effect on antagonism of catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. However, previous studies evaluating the influence of catecholamine activity on the electrophysiologic effects of adenosine have yielded conflicting results. We tested the hypotheses that if adenosine exerts its atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking effects directly by activating the I(K,Ado) potassium current, rather than indirectly by reversing the catecholamine effects, then pretreatment with beta-adrenergic blockade would not potentiate the effects of adenosine in terminating AV nodal-dependent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).", 
    "109": "During sustained AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) in 28 patients, adenosine was rapidly injected in incremental doses of 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 mg to determine the lowest effective dose required for tachycardia termination before and immediately after the end of esmolol infusion. Esmolol infusion was started with loading doses of 500 /kg/min for 1 min and 150 microg/kg/min for 4 min, followed by a maintenance infusion of 50-100 microg/kg/min. Esmolol infusion was continued until the tachycardia was terminated or the maximal dose of 100 mg was reached. Adenosine was effective in terminating SVT in all 28 patients with a mean lowest effective dose of 96 +/- 54 microg/kg before esmolol. During esmolol infusion, tachycardia was reproducibly terminated in 8 patients (6 with AVNRT, 2 with AVRT) with a mean dose of 67 +/- 23 mg. In the other 20 patients with persistent tachycardia after 100 mg of esmolol infusion, the lowest effective dose of adenosine could be determined in 19 patients. In the remaining patient with AVRT, the maximal dose of adenosine (18 mg) was unable to terminate the tachycardia immediately after the end of esmolol infusion. In these 19 patients, esmolol infusion caused significant lengthening of the tachycardia cycle length from 338 +/- 36 to 372 +/- 51 ms (p < 0.0001) and reduction of the mean arterial blood pressure from 96 +/- 15 to 88 +/- 18 mm Hg (p = 0.034). Compared to the dosage that was determined before esmolol infusion, the lowest effective dose of adenosine remained the same in 13 patients after the end of esmolol infusion, whereas the dose increased in 5 and decreased in 1 patient. The mean lowest effective dose of adenosine was not significantly different before (98 +/- 54 microg/kg) and immediately after (115 +/- 56 microg/kg) the end of esmolol infusion (p = 0.054).", 
    "110": "Intravenous esmolol infusion (up to 100 mg total dose) usually fails to terminate AV nodal-dependent SVT. In the esmolol-resistant tachycardia, esmolol pretreatment does not produce a positive synergistic effect on the efficacy of adenosine-induced termination of SVT. Therefore, in this tachycardia adenosine may exert its effects on AV nodal conduction directly by activation of the I(K,Ado) potassium current, rather than by antagonizing the beta-adrenergic system.", 
    "111": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro expression of Period 1 (Per1), Period 2 (Per2) and arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT) genes in the rat pineal gland to understand the mechanism(s) regulating the expression of these genes in this organ. Pineals, when maintained in vitro for 5 days, did not show circadian rhythmicity in the expression of any of the three genes monitored. Norepinephrine (NE) induced AA-NAT and Per1, whereas its effect on Per2 was negligible. Contrary to what was observed in other systems, NE stimulation did not induce circadian expression of Per1. The effect of NE on Per1 level was dose- and receptor subtype-dependent, and both cAMP and cGMP induced Per1. Per1 was not induced by repeated NE - or forskolin - stimulation. Protein synthesis was not necessary for NE-induced Per1, but it was for reduction of Per1 following NE stimulation. Per1 transcription in pinealocytes was activated by BMAL1/CLOCK. Our results indicate that important differences are present in the regulation of these genes in the mammalian pineal.",

This phenomenon was not modified by promethazine (H(1) receptor antagonist), methysergide (5-HT receptor antagonist), guanethidine (sympathetic function inhibitor), anti-TNF-alpha or anti-interleukin-1 antibodies or by the chelating agent CaNa(2)EDTA. Venom-induced hyperalgesia was blocked by the bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist HOE 140. On the other hand, des-Arg(9), [Leu(8)]-bradykinin, a bradykinin B(1) receptor antagonist, did not modify the hyperalgesic response. These results suggest that bradykinin, acting on B(2) receptor, is a mediator of hyperalgesia induced by B. jararaca venom.",

    "120": "The aims of this study were to develop a suitable model to study proarrhythmic potential using isolated rabbit hearts with atrioventricular block and to examine the proarrhythmic potential of several drugs using this model. With a normal K/Mg solution (K+=5.7 mM and Mg2+=1 mM), d,l-sotalol (10 and 30 microM), a class III antiarrhythmic drug, prolonged ventricular repolarization, such as QT intervals and monophasic action potential duration, and induced early after-depolarization and polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Cisapride (0.1 and 0.3 microM), a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, also prolonged the ventricular repolarization, and induced early after-depolarization. With a low K/Mg solution (K+=1.5 mM and Mg2+=0.35 mM), d,l-sotalol at 30 microM and cisapride at 0.3 microM more potently prolonged the ventricular repolarization than with a normal K/Mg solution. Furthermore, the incidence of polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia caused by cisapride at 0.3 microM with a low K/Mg solution was higher than that with a normal K/Mg solution. Mosapride citrate, another 5-HT4 receptor agonist, at 10 microM prolonged the ventricular repolarization and induced early after-depolarization with a low K/Mg solution, whereas the drug at 1 and 3 microM did not affect any of the parameters examined. Des-4-fluorobenzyl-mosapride, a metabolite of mosapride citrate, at 10 microM slightly prolonged the ventricular repolarization without inducing early after-depolarization or ventricular tachyarrhythmia. These results suggest that mosapride citrate and des-4-fluorobenzyl-mosapride have much less proarrhythmic potential than cisapride and that isolated rabbit heart with atrioventricular block, perfused with a low K/Mg solution, is a suitable model for predicting the proarrhythmic potential of drugs.", 
    "121": "The anticonvulsant properties of the ss-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and its two enantiomers were examined in various screening tests in order to characterize the anticonvulsant profile as well as the possible molecular mechanism of action. These compounds dose-dependently raised the threshold for tonic electroshock seizures in mice and were effective in the traditional maximal electroshock test (ED (50)s 15- 20 mg kg (-1)i.p.). In combination with clinically used antiepileptics, the anticonvulsant effectiveness of the latter was significantly increased. In the pentylenetetrazol (85 mg kg (-1)s.c.) seizure threshold test, ( +/-)- and ( +)-propranolol were not effective in preventing clonic seizures. In unrestrained rats with chronically implanted electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus, propranolol and its ( +)-enantiomer equieffectively reduced the duration of electrically-evoked hippocampal afterdischarges (10 and 20 mg kg (-1)i.p.) and raised the focal stimulation threshold (20 mg kg (-1)i.p.). In amygdala-kindled rats, both drugs ( >or= 10 mg kg (-1)i.p.) reduced the seizure severity from stage 5 (generalized clonic-tonic) to stage 3 (unilateral forelimb) seizures. Furthermore, whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed that ( +)- as well as ( -)-propranolol ( 10(-6)to 10(-4)M) depressed the fast inward sodium current in a concentration- and use-dependent manner in cultured rat cardiomyocytes and inhibited picrotoxin-induced burst firing activity of mouse spinal cord neurones in culture. In conclusion, propranolol and its two enantiomers have anticonvulsant effects in models for generalized tonic-clonic and complex partial seizures which may be accounted for by the sodium channel blocking and not by the ss-adrenoceptor blocking activity.",

To determine if such protection could be afforded to retinal photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE), levobetaxolol (S-betaxolol) was evaluated in a photic-induced retinopathy model. Rats were dosed (IP) with vehicle or levobetaxolol (10 and 20 mg kg(-1)) 48, 24 and 0 hr prior to exposure for 6 hr to fluorescent blue light. The electroretinogram (ERG) and retinal morphology were assessed after a 3 week recovery period. Evaluation of the ERG demonstrated significant protection of retinal function in levobetaxolol (20 mg kg(-1))-dosed rats compared to vehicle-dosed rats. Similarly, the RPE and outer nuclear layer were significantly thicker in levobetaxolol (20 mg kg(-1))-dosed rats compared to vehicle-dosed rats. To elucidate potential mechanism(s) of the neuroprotective activity of levobetaxolol, bFGF and CNTF mRNA levels in normal rat retinas were evaluated 12 hr after a single i.p. injection. Northern blot analysis of levobetaxolol treated retinas demonstrated a 10-fold up-regulation of bFGF and a two-fold up-regulation of CNTF mRNA levels, trophic factors that have been shown to inhibit retinal degeneration in a number of species. These studies suggest that levobetaxolol can be used as a novel neuroprotective agent to ameliorate retinopathy.",

    "130": "The AFFIRM Study enrolled 4060 predominantly elderly patients with atrial fibrillation to compare ventricular rate control with rhythm control. The patients in the AFFIRM Study were representative of patients at high risk for complications from atrial fibrillation, which indicates that the results of this large clinical trial will be relevant to patient care.",

    "133": "The study group was aged 65 +/- 10 years and 59% were male. By design, 50% of patients were randomized to amiodarone (n = 132), 25% to sotalol (n = 66), and 25% to propafenone (n = 66). Most patients had normal left ventricular function (89%). Physical (41.9 +/- 9.3 to 43.7 +/- 9.2, P =.001) and mental health (47.5 +/- 10.5 to 49.0 +/- 9.8, P =.023) summary measures from the SF-36 improved significantly from baseline to 3 months. Arrhythmia symptom frequency and severity (SCL) also improved markedly from baseline to 3 months (symptom frequency 20.4 +/- 9.4 to 16.2 +/- 9.5 and symptom severity 16.7 +/- 8.2 to 12.9 +/- 7.4, both P <.001). QOL improvements were not significantly different among the groups randomized to amiodarone, sotalol, or propafenone. However, patients with no symptomatic recurrences of AF had higher scores at 3 months on measures of global well-being than those with recurrences in the first 3 months (7.4 +/- 1.8 vs 6.9 +/- 1.8, P <.05). There were no significant QOL changes from the 3 to 12 month assessment.",

    "135": "This study examined if the nitric oxide (NO)/L-arginine pathway participates in and if the sympathetic nervous system attenuates the depressor action of human urotensin II. I.V. bolus injections of human urotensin II (0.1-30 nmol/kg) caused dose-dependent decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP, EC(50) = 2.09 +/- 0.8 nmol/kg; Emax = -18 +/- 3 mmHg ) and increases in heart rate. The depressor response to human urotensin II (3 nmol/kg) was attenuated by approximately 50% in rats with MAP elevated through pretreatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (inhibitor of NO synthase), relative to that in rats with MAP elevated to a similar level through a continuous infusion of noradrenaline. Autonomic blockade with i.v. injections of mecamylamine (ganglion blocker) and propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) markedly augmented the depressor response to human urotensin II, but almost completely attenuated the tachycardia. The results suggest that the depressor response to human urotensin II is partially mediated via the NO/L-arginine pathway, and is suppressed by activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Furthermore, tachycardic response to human urotensin II is primarily mediated indirectly via baroreflex mechanisms.", 
    "136": "It has been suggested that the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the short-term control of feeding. The adrenergic innervation of some splanchnic organs seems to be especially involved in such processes, since catecholamines reduce feeding only when injected intraperitoneally or intraportally. In this work, the effects of neonatal sympathetic denervation with guanethidine (Gnt) upon food intake were assessed in adult rats. Gnt-treated male rats had lower body weight gain. The hypophagic response to intraperitoneal (ip) norepinephrine was 70% higher in Gnt-treated animals as compared to controls (P < 0.05); that of epinephrine (E) by 33% (P < 0.05) and that of isoproterenol was not significantly modified. As in normal rats, the hypophagic effect was much stronger after ip than after intramuscular (im) administration (P < 0.05). On the other hand, resting oxygen consumption (VO2) was consistently lower in denervated animals. Ip E administration did not modify VO2, while im E caused increased motor activity and VO2 (P < 0.05). In contrast to control rats, the respiratory exchange ratio in ad libitum fed Gnt rats did not decrease after Ip E administration, suggesting a lack of effect upon lipid mobilization. The lower rate of body weight gain induced by neonatal Gnt sympathectomy might be due to lower daily food intake possibly related, in part, to the sensitization of the alpha-adrenergic porto-hepatic response to endogenous catecholamines. Compared with controls, Gnt-treated rats also showed a limited thermogenic capacity not related to feeding, and a greater degree of carbohydrate oxidation, possibly due to a defect in E-induced lipolysis, which is beta-adrenergic.", 
    "137": "To evaluate the clinical importance of serum hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) concentration, we designed two clinical investigations. The first study analyzed the correlation between serum HGF concentration and clinical arterial stiffness or the vasodilator response to reactive hyperemia in hypertensive patients. The second study investigated the correlation between changes in serum HGF concentration and clinical arterial stiffness or reactive hyperemia during treatment with cilazapril or atenolol. A total of 210 hypertensive patients were analyzed in the first study, and 25 patients with essential hypertension were evaluated in the second study. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), strain gauge plethysmography, and serum HGF concentration were measured in the first study. We also evaluated these factors before and after treatment with either cilazapril (2.0 mg/day) or atenolol (25 mg/day) for 6 months in the second study. Serum HGF concentration was negatively correlated to reactive hyperemia in overall (r = 0.434, P < .0001) and nontreatment (r = 0.452, P < .0001) hypertensive patients. Arterial stiffness was weakly related to serum HGF concentration (P < .05) after adjusting for age and mean blood pressure (BP). By multiple regression analysis, only serum HGF concentration showed a strong independent correlation with reactive hyperemia, age and mean BP with PWV. Moreover, a relationship between endothelium-dependent vasodilation and serum HGF concentration was observed during treatment with cilazapril or atenolol (r = 0.406, P < .005). These results suggest that in evaluation of serum HGF concentration, the forearm vasodilator response to reactive hyperemia and PWV might be useful for managing hypertension in patients who are receiving antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "138": "The main reason for a failure of peritoneal dialysis is due to technical problems or infections. By starting PD immediately after the insertion of a dialysis catheter (instead of starting HD before optimal healing of the PD-catheter) it may be easier to achieve acceptance for PD by the patients. An easy and tight access is achieved when inserting the PD-catheter through the rectus muscle, fixing it with three purse string sutures, two of them fixing the inner cuff between the peritoneal membrane and the inner rectus fascia. Thereby early and late leakage will be rare and good drainage is normally achieved besides a low risk for exit site infections. Using Coloplast adhesive insulin can be injected into the PD bags in a simple way even by patients with bad vision. Using ultraviolet light, as additional exchange device (UV-box), the risk for peritonitis is reduced compared to classic manual connection. Using the Y-set or duo-bag system the risk for peritonitis is further lowered. Malfunction by dislocation of the intraperitoneal part of the catheters can often be corrected without surgery using a bent stylet. A controlled study showed that antibiotic prophylactics could significantly reduce the risk for peritonitis in the follow up after insertion of PD catheters. Additionally the risk for peritonitis is reduced using a special connector for the PET-sampling procedures. X-ray of catheter location in the abdominal cavity can be performed by injection of 20-ml contrast media into 100 ml of PD fluid residing in the PD-bag. After mixing, small portions of this fluid can be infused into the abdomen for X-ray determination of the location. An increased ultrafiltration failure during PD may be due to use of beta-blocker medication. After ceasing this medication recovery may occur. Avoiding pets in the room used for PD-exchange may lower the risk for peritonitis further. A devoted nurse and physician will keep up the patients' spirit and help to convert patients not suitable for PD to HD or the other way round. By such measures the incidence of peritonitis can be reduced to 1 in 40 treatment months or less.", 
    "139": "The LIFE study (\"Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study\") demonstrated a significant cardiovascular protection by an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. At similar blood pressure control, losartan, as compared to atenolol, reduced the relative risk of primary cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) by 13% (p = 0.021) in the whole cohort of 9.193 patients after a mean follow-up of 4.7 years. In a subgroup of 1.195 diabetic patients, the protection was even more marked with a reduction of the combined risk of 24% (p = 0.031) and a fall of the mortality of 39% (p = 0.002). In conclusion, losartan prevents cardiovascular morbidity and death more effectively than atenolol, and seems to confer benefits beyond reduction in blood pressure.", 
    "140": "Hypertension means a basic public health problem in many countries in the world. The therapeutic attempts of the last years did not fulfill the hopes pinned on them, and most of the patients live with blood pressure above the goal value. This is why there is a need for new, more efficient antihypertensive drugs. On the 1st of July, 2001 irbesartan (Aprovel) was introduced in practice in Hungary. The drug belongs to the family of the angiotensin II receptor inhibitors. Several clinical studies were made with irbesartan in order to evaluate its efficiency, tolerability and safety. In other studies it was compared with other antihypertensive treatments and it was found that irbesartan decreases the systolic and diastolic blood pressure as effectively as other first line medicaments. The author summarizes the most important characteristics of irbesartan as well as the results of those clinical studies which show evidence that irbesartan deserves a special place among antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "141": "In an acute pharmacological test in 13 healthy volunteers (24 +/- 4) years old effects were studied of propranolol, 40 mg/50 kg body mass, on the sympathovagal regulation and phase patterns of the cardiac cycle. The study was made with the aid of the computer electrocardiograph \"Cardiolab 2000\" at the height of the propranolol effect by standard methods. The state of the sympathovagal regulation was assessed by the heart's rhythm variability technique with respect to the spectrum lowfrequency and highfrequency ranges powers. There have been measured duration of the P-wave, PQ-interval, QRS-complex, QT-interval to analyze phase patterns of the cardiac cycle. One-dose intake of propranolol has been shown to optimize the sympathovagal balance by boosting the influence of that portion of the autonomic nervous system, whose baseline activity has been shown to be slight. Optimization of the sympathovagal balance was accompanied by general enhancement of the level of neurohumoral regulation. Effect of propranolol on the phase patterns of the cardiac cycle was invariant from the baseline state and from subsequent changes in the sympathovagal balance.",

    "161": "Although several serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes influence ethanol consumption, the motivational mechanisms underlying these changes remain unclear. The present experiments characterized the rewarding, aversive and stimulant effects of ethanol in combination with a specific 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (pindobind-5HT1A). In a place conditioning study, adult male Swiss-Webster mice received 6 parings of a distinctive tactile stimulus with either 2 g/kg ethanol, 2.5 mg/kg pindobind-5HT1A, or both drugs in combination. Ethanol-conditioned preference for the tactile cue was enhanced in mice also receiving pindobind-5HT1A, which did not produce cue preference in the absence of ethanol. In a taste conditioning study, Swiss-Webster mice received 4 trials consisting of access to a distinctive NaCl flavor followed by either 4 g/kg ethanol, 2.5 mg/kg pindobind-5HT1A, or both drugs. As expected, ethanol produced avoidance of the flavor. Pindobind-5HT1A did not reduce or enhance ethanol-conditioned flavor aversion. In a study characterizing locomotor activity, 2 g/kg ethanol produced stimulation, which was enhanced after 10 daily treatments. Locomotor sensitization was not altered by co-treatment with pindobind-5HT1A. Overall, the present results show specific effects of 5-HT1A blockade on ethanol reward.", 
    "162": "Impaired renal function occurs in about 50% of patients suffering from type 2 diabetes, and diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of endstage renal disease. Reduction of blood pressure to levels around 120/80 mmHg is one of the most effective way to slow progression of diabetic nephropathy. Recent meta-analyses, however, have emphasized on the fact that ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NDHP-CCB) exert nephro-protective effects which go beyond the effect of blood pressure reduction. This has lately been confirmed by a prospective trial in comparison to the betablocker atenolol. Based on these data, demographics of the Swiss population, literature data on mortality rates of type 2 diabetics with impaired renal function and studies on true costs of antihypertensives, we calculated the costs of a longterm intervention (20 years) with antihypertensives in 3536 middle-aged Swiss patients with type 2 diabetes and macro-albuminuria whose antihypertensive regimen was based either on the ACEI lisinopril, or the ND-HP-CCB verapamil, or the betablocker atenolol. Under atenolol, acquisition costs were lowest, whereas faster loss of renal function over time increased mortality rate and thus reduced the number of patients to be treated. Nevertheless, due to the fact that patients reached uremia and had to be dialyzed, 20 years of atenolol-based regimen with costs of 316 millions of Swiss francs turned out to be much more expensive than the lisinopril- or the verapamil-based regimen with 121 and 38 millions of Swiss francs, respectively. Thus, low acquisition cost is not necessarily the only important determinant of overall costs of drug therapy.",

    "164": "We report a family with congenital long QT syndrome, an inherited disorder of myocardial repolarization in which affected individuals have prolongation of corrected QT interval on the electrocardiogram and a tendency to develop ventricular arrhythmia, leading to syncope, convulsion or sudden death. Our family is characterized by several affected members (11/16), early onset of symptoms, malignant course prior to diagnosis and good response to beta-blocker therapy. The genetic basis of long QT syndrome has been traced to defective proteins encoding cardiac ion channels. Diagnosis is based on an unexplained prolongation of QT interval >0.45 second in the presence of suggestive symptoms or evidence, or both of a familial pattern. Beta-adrenergic blocker therapy gives symptomatic relief in 80%-85% of patients. Precipitating factors like vigorous exercise especially swimming and exposure to significant emotional or auditory stimuli should be avoided. Occasional patients require in addition, a demand cardiac pacemaker, left cardiac sympathectomy or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or both. Regular follow up is mandatory even after subsidence of symptoms."
