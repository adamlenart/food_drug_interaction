They occur mainly in situations of increased sympathetic activity. Therefore some patients seem to be at risk, eg, patients with unstable diabetes type 1, sportsmen performing isometric exercise, and heavy smokers. In orthostatic hypotension, noncardioselective beta-blockers may be beneficial. Cardiac output tends, however, to decrease, and patients with orthostatic hypotension will probably not benefit from this effect.", 
    "1": "Beta adrenergic blocking agents have gained wide acceptance among practitioners and patients alike as extremely useful drugs for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma. This new class of antiglaucoma agents usually is effective in reducing elevated intraocular pressure and is generally well tolerated. This paper is intended to provide an understanding of the ophthalmic beta adrenergic blocking agents to optometrists who are actively involved in the treatment of glaucoma and/or in the monitoring of glaucoma patients. The clinical pharmacology of the three FDA-approved beta blockers -- timolol, levobunolol, and betaxolol, is evaluated and the drugs are compared.", 
    "2": "The role(s) of beta-adrenoceptors in whole body and hindlimb skeletal muscle cardiovascular and metabolic responses during carbon monoxide hypoxia (COH) was studied in anesthetized dogs. One group of animals was beta-blocked with propranolol (beta 1- and beta 2-blockade), a second was given ICI 118,551 (beta 2-blockade), and a third served as a time control. Immediately after a control-sampling period, COH was induced (about a 63% decrease in arterial O2 content), and additional measurements were then obtained at 30 and 60 min of hypoxia. Cardiac output values were not different between the three series at control; an increase (P less than 0.05) occurred in all groups during COH. This rise was greatest in the COH group; the values for the propranolol- and ICI 118,551-blocked groups were not different from each other during COH. Hindlimb blood flow rose (P less than 0.05) during COH only in the control group. Both whole body (30 min) and hindlimb (30 and 60 min) resistance values were greater during hypoxia in the beta-blocked groups (P less than 0.05) than in the control series. Furthermore, whole body oxygen uptake decreased (P less than 0.05) in both beta-blocked groups during COH. We conclude that approximately 35% of the rise in cardiac output occurring during COH depended on peripheral vasodilation mediated through beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "3": "To identify the type of alpha-adrenoceptors involved in the inhibition of the hydrosmotic effect of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) on the toad bladder, we studied the effect of different alpha-adrenergic agonists and antagonists on ADH-induced water transport. Serosal addition of epinephrine (10(-6) M) and norepinephrine (10(-6) M) in the presence of 10(-4) M propranolol significantly inhibited the hydrosmotic effect of ADH (arginine vasopressin). This inhibitory effect of the catecholamines was completely reversed by 10(-5) M yohimbine but not by prazosin. Clonidine did not block ADH-induced water transport, but guanabenz, another alpha 2-agonist, inhibited water transport in response to ADH. In bladders pretreated with indomethacin to block prostaglandin synthesis, basal water permeability was increased, and even in this condition epinephrine inhibited ADH-induced water transport. These studies indicate that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are involved in the inhibitory effect of catecholamines on ADH-mediated water permeability in the toad bladder. However, this effect was not mimicked by clonidine, as in the case of rabbit cortical collecting tubule. The inhibitory effect of epinephrine appears to be exerted independently of prostaglandin synthesis.", 
    "4": "The effect of prostaglandins and alpha-adrenergic agonists on arginine vasopressin-induced adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production was investigated in microdissected rat and rabbit cortical collecting tubules (CCT) incubated in vitro. In rabbit CCT, addition to all media of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor increased this production; exogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induced a reproducible dose-dependent inhibition of cAMP accumulation. Maximal inhibition (mean: 57.5%) was observed with 0.3 microM PGE2, and threshold inhibition was observed with concentrations ranging from 3 to 10 nM PGE2. Inhibition of cAMP levels in rabbit CCT was also obtained with 0.3 microM PGF2 alpha (mean inhibition: 44.3%) but not with alpha-adrenergic agonists studied under the same conditions. The opposite was observed in rat CCT studied in parallel: the alpha-agonists inhibited cAMP production by up to 80%, but PGE2 had no effect.", 
    "5": "Maternofetal transfer of five beta-blockers differing in molecular weight, solubility, and binding to albumin was studied using a dual in vitro perfusion system of an isolated cotyledon of human placenta. At steady state the diffusion rate of the lipid-soluble propranolol, timolol, and labetalol was three to four times higher than that of the hydrophilic atenolol and celiprolol. Albumin binding had no significant effect on diffusion when equal concentrations were used in the two perfusion circuits. With increased albumin concentration on the fetal side an acceleration of the diffusion of propranolol could be shown. Propranolol and labetalol showed considerable binding to placental tissue. After bolus injection transfer was clearly suppressed, as a result of tissue binding, and there was a delay until a steady state of diffusion was reached when constant concentrations were maintained in the maternal compartment. With recirculation of the fetal and maternal compartments propranolol rapidly equilibrated in the two perfusion circuits at 35% of the initial level in the maternal circuit. Atenolol after 4 hours of recirculation had not reached full equilibration between the two compartments, and the fetal concentration was at 55% of the initial level on the maternal side.", 
    "6": "Epidemiologic evidence increasingly implicates psychosocial variables in the development of coronary heart disease in human beings, an association that appears to be independent of the effects of other coronary disease risk factors. It has been hypothesized that behavioral influences on coronary heart disease are mediated by activation of the sympathetic nervous system, perhaps through exacerbation of coronary artery atherosclerosis. This article summarizes several studies of the effects of stress and sympathetic arousal on atherosclerosis in a nonhuman primate model of atherogenesis. The application of a behavioral stressor involving periodic reorganization of social group memberships resulted in worsened coronary atherosclerosis among male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) fed a cholesterol-containing diet, relative to control animals housed in groups of fixed (stable) membership, but only among those monkeys that retained dominant social status during the course of the study. This effect could not be attributed to concomitant variability in blood pressure or serum lipid concentrations. When the same experimental procedures were applied to males fed a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, the manipulation of group memberships similarly led to development of greater atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. In related observations, monkeys that exhibited the largest heart rate responses to a standardized behavioral challenge had more extensive coronary atherosclerosis than animals showing a less pronounced cardiac responsivity to stress. In a final investigation, we observed that the exacerbated atherosclerosis of dominant monkeys consuming an atherogenic diet and housed in unstable social groups could be prevented by long-term administration of a beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent, propranolol hydrochloride.", 
    "7": "Clinical and experimental evidence points to potential antiatherosclerotic effects of certain beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists. Long-term treatment with metoprolol resulted in significant reductions of total and cardiovascular mortality or morbidity due to decreased incidence of coronary and cerebrovascular complications both in a primary prevention trial in hypertensive patients and in a secondary prevention trial in patients surviving myocardial infarction. The observations suggest that a retardation of atherosclerosis development might have contributed to the reduced incidence of cardiovascular complications. An antiatherosclerotic effect of beta-blockers has been directly demonstrated in animal studies. In cholesterol-fed rabbits, metoprolol significantly reduced the development of atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic intima in the absence of any changes in blood lipids. Similar findings were reported for propranolol, which prevented psychosocial stress-induced atherosclerosis of the coronary artery in monkeys. Furthermore, beta-blockers have been shown to prevent stress-induced endothelial injury and platelet accumulation to intima at atherosclerotic predilection sites in animal models. These antiatherogenic effects may be due to biochemical and hemodynamic factors. Two biochemical effects of beta-blockade may lead to reduced cholesterol accumulation in arterial intima at unchanged serum cholesterol levels. One is a beta-blocker-induced increase of prostacyclin biosynthesis, and the other a metabolic change of low-density lipoprotein, reducing its potential for deposition in the arterial wall. The antiatherogenic effect of these factors may be reinforced by beta-blocker-induced hemodynamic changes leading to reductions of arterial flow aberrations and pressure-related wall stress.", 
    "8": "Fifty adult men with mild to moderate hypertension were recruited to participate in a double-blind crossover study. Each subject received 14 days of drug treatment and 14 days of placebo treatment (random order). Half the subjects were assigned to a metoprolol (150 mg/day) vs placebo treatment regimen and half to an atenolol (100 mg/day) vs placebo regimen. Blood pressure levels as well as measures of simple (proofreading), intermediate (visual-motor task), and complex (management simulation) task performance were obtained at the end of the drug and placebo treatment periods. Metoprolol treatment generated better scores than did placebo or atenolol treatment for proofreading, visual-motor performance, and several measures of complex managerial competence. Atenolol treatment generally resulted in performance levels that did not differ from those observed with placebo. However, atenolol-treated subjects made more errors than did placebo-treated subjects in the visual-motor task and also showed some deterioration on one measure of complex managerial functioning.", 
    "9": "The most common mild side effects occurring with use of beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for blood pressure control are central nervous system symptoms, specifically lethargy, sedation, and fatigue. These symptoms affect 5% to 10% of patients taking these drugs. The mechanism by which beta-blockers may induce central nervous system effects is uncertain. Relative lipophilicity as a factor affecting penetrance of the blood-brain barrier has not proved to be a reliable predictor of whether the drug will cause such disturbances. Comparisons of atenolol (hydrophilic) and metoprolol (lipophilic) have shown no differences between these drugs with respect to side effects of the central nervous system. The incidence of central nervous system effects with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is similar to that for most beta-blockers. The precise role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme in the central nervous system is not well defined. Most thiazide diuretics are not associated with major complications of the central nervous system, although electrolyte imbalance may occasionally lead to complaints of neurologic symptoms. Because the incidence of central nervous system effects with these three classes of drugs is so low, concern for the side effects of the central nervous system is not a prime consideration in the choice of an initial antihypertensive agent.", 
    "10": "The mortality and morbidity of hypertension-related diseases among blacks are much higher than in age- and sex-matched white counterparts. New data show that the incidence of renal damage may be 18 to 20 times greater in blacks than in whites. Some preliminary data also indicate that coronary heart disease is much more prevalent in blacks than previously suspected and that coronary heart disease mortality among blacks may indeed not be declining, as it is for white populations. Major contributors to these findings in blacks are an increased prevalence and severity of hypertension, a possibly increased susceptibility to end-organ damage, socioeconomic factors and beliefs that affect hypertension control, and very possibly some obsolete treatments that focus on blood pressure numbers and do not emphasize the black person and the associated risk factors. Diuretic therapy has long been the mainstay treatment for black hypertensives, but the effects of diuretics on lipid levels and left ventricular hypertrophy, among other factors, should be carefully assessed. A recent study of beta-blockers in blacks showed that metoprolol was effective and well tolerated. Consideration of epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and pharmacotherapeutic features of hypertension in blacks may require traditional views of this disease and its treatment in this special population to be reevaluated.",

Thus, the achievement of even minimal decreases in reinfarction and mortality rates will benefit large numbers of patients. Secondary prevention strategies include smoking cessation; the control of hyperlipidemia, obesity and diabetes; the management of hypertension and stress; exercise; the use of drugs such as beta blockers and aspirin, and increased attention to general health.", 
    "12": "Incubation of DDT1 MF-2 hamster vas deferens cells with beta-adrenergic agonists results in a time- and concentration-dependent decreases in both beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) responsiveness and receptor number. Receptor mRNA levels were quantified by DNA-excess solution hybridization by using a 170-nucleotide single-stranded probe derived from the hamster beta 2AR cDNA. RNA blot analysis of poly(A)+-selected RNA with the solution probe revealed a 2.2-kilobase species. Digestion of the RNA/solution probe mixture with S1 endonuclease revealed a single species of RNA (170 bases) that was protected by the solution probe. DDT1 MF-2 cells were found to contain 0.38 pg of beta AR mRNA per microgram of total cellular RNA. Incubation (16 hr) with isoproterenol decreased beta AR mRNA levels in cells by 40%. This agonist-induced decrease in receptor mRNA levels was found to be dependent on the time of incubation and the dose of agonist. The decrease in beta AR mRNA was half-maximal at 0.1-0.5 microM isoproterenol. The beta-adrenergic antagonists CGP 20712A (beta 1-selective) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective) blocked in a dose-dependent fashion the ability of isoproterenol to effect receptor mRNA levels. The beta 2-adrenergic antagonist displayed a potency 25-fold greater than that of the beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, in agreement with the subtype of receptor (beta 2) expressed by these cells. For down-regulated cells in which receptor mRNA levels declined in response to agonist, the addition of the antagonist ligand (-)-propranolol (1 microM) was able to restore receptor mRNA levels to 90% of the control value within 12 hr. Full recovery of steady-state beta AR mRNA was achieved within 60 hr. These studies provide a molecular explanation for the down-regulation of GTP-binding regulatory protein (G protein)-linked cell-surface receptors that accompanies desensitization.", 
    "13": "SOM-1122 was found to be a high-affinity, partial agonist for beta adrenergic receptors. SOM-1122 inhibited the binding of [125I]iodopindolol to membranes prepared from rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum. GTP regulated the binding of SOM-1122 by increasing the Hill coefficient in both tissues and reducing the affinity of the receptor for SOM-1122 in the cerebellum. SOM-1122 increased the concentration of cyclic AMP in slices of rat cerebral cortex in a dose-dependent manner; this effect was antagonized by propranolol. Two lines of evidence suggested that SOM-1122 was centrally active after peripheral administration. First, SOM-1122 inhibited the binding of [125I]iodopindolol in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Second, after chronic infusion with SOM-1122 for 7 days, the density of beta adrenergic receptors in the cerebellum was reduced; receptor density also was reduced 18 hr after acute administration of SOM-1122, although to a lesser extent. SOM-1122 was found to be behaviorally active. It reduced locomotor activity and reduced response rate under a multiple fixed-interval, fixed-ratio schedule in a dose-dependent manner. SOM-1122 also reduced response rate and increased reinforcement rate under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate schedule. These behavioral actions of SOM-1122 appeared to be due to an interaction of the agonist with beta adrenergic receptors, as they were antagonized by propranolol. The behavioral changes produced by stimulation of beta adrenergic receptors with SOM-1122 were generally similar to those caused by other centrally acting beta adrenergic agonists and by antidepressant drugs.", 
    "14": "Tertatolol is a new beta-blocking agent which induces renal vasodilation in experimental animals and humans and increases glomerular filtration rate (GFR), diuresis and natriuresis. The mechanisms underlying renal effects of tertatolol are not known. Our aims were to establish whether tertatolol influences renal function by a systemic or by an intrarenal effect and to assess whether tertatolol could maintain GFR in chronic renal failure. Tertatolol but not propranolol when given as i.v. bolus injection at the dose of 25 and 50 micrograms/kg. b.w. induces a significant increase in GFR and perfusate flow rate (PFR) in an isolated perfused kidney model [GFR: tertatolol, 25 micrograms/kg; preinjection: 0.477 +/- 0.077 ml/min/g of kidney; 30 min postinjection: 0.996 +/- 0.114 ml/min/g of kidney. Tertatolol (50 micrograms/kg) preinjection: 0.517 +/- 0.040 ml/min/g of kidney; 30 min postinjection: 0.879 +/- 0.035 ml/min/g of kidney.

    "15": "Topical beta-blocking agents have been associated with adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects, including depression, emotional lability, and sexual dysfunction. Two studies were done to determine if patients who develop CNS effects while using timolol maleate would improve with betaxolol hydrochloride. In one study, 18 patients with CNS symptoms during timolol therapy were switched to betaxolol. Sixteen of the 18 patients noted symptomatic improvement with betaxolol. The second study involved seven patients with CNS symptoms during timolol therapy who were entered into a double-masked cross-over study. In two patients CNS symptoms resolved with betaxolol; in three patients symptoms improved; and in one patient symptoms worsened with betaxolol. Although factors influencing beta-blocker activity in the CNS are not well understood, there may be some advantage to a selective agent.", 
    "16": "To investigate the possible role of adrenergic mechanisms in modulating glucose homeostasis during physiological insulin changes, we studied the effects of alpha-, beta-, or combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade on glucose production (Ra) and utilization (Rd) via isotope ([3-(3)H]glucose) dilution during nonstressful, nonhypoglycemic conditions in response to physiological insulin changes in conscious dogs. Without adrenergic blockade, infusion of insulin at 0.275 mU.kg-1.min-1 (control) caused glucose to fall from 92 +/- 4 to 82 +/- 4 mg/dl over 30 min, because of transient fall in Ra from 2.8 +/- 0.4 to 2.3 +/- 0.3 mg.kg-1.min-1, which recovered to base line by 30 min. There was a later rise in Rd to 3.9 +/- 0.4 mg.kg-1.min-1 at 45 min, but no counter-regulatory hormonal changes (glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine) to account for these findings in glucose kinetics. alpha-Blockade alone led to an initial rise in base-line insulin and consequent fall in glucose, associated with a transient fall in Ra but no change in Rd; infusion of insulin led to a further small fall in glucose, with no change in Ra, but with a rise at 30 min in Rd similar to controls. beta-Blockade alone led to an initial fall in insulin and modest rise in glucose; insulin infusion led to a greater rate of fall in glucose than in controls (from 112 +/- 6 to 78 +/- 7 mg/dl over 30 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "The effects of beta-blocking and class I antiarrhythmic agents on free radical-mediated sarcolemmal lipid peroxidation were examined. Highly purified canine myocytic sarcolemmal membranes were pretreated with 10-800 microM of selected beta-blocking (propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol, atenolol, or sotalol) and class I (quinidine, lidocaine, procainamide, or diphenylhydantoin) antiarrhythmic agents at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes. Subsequently, a superoxide radical (derived from dihydroxyfumarate) driven, Fe3+-ADP catalyzed free radical generating system was added and incubated for up to 45 minutes. Lipid peroxidation of sarcolemma was determined by malondialdehyde formation. Pretreatment of the membranes with the five beta-blockers resulted in various degrees (20-95%) of inhibition of sarcolemmal peroxidation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. All the class I agents were less effective (less than 20% inhibition). The order of potency of the beta-blockers was propranolol greater than pindolol greater than metoprolol greater than atenolol greater than sotalol and appeared to relate to their degree of lipophilicity. Propranolol, the most potent agent, achieved half-maximal inhibition of peroxidation at about 100 microM and achieved significance (p less than 0.01) at 20 microM. At pH 6.0, the efficacy of pindolol, metoprolol, atenolol, and sotalol diminished by 30-50% compared to pH 7.2, but the potency of propranolol remained unchanged. Since increased free radical production may occur during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, the above findings suggest that the lipophilic beta-blockers may provide additional antiperoxidative protection of ischemic tissue.", 
    "18": "The ultrashort-acting beta blocker flestolol was studied during atrial pacing and atrial fibrillation (AF) in 10 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Flestolol was given as a 100-micrograms/kg bolus followed by a 10-micrograms/kg/min infusion for 15 minutes. The drug did not alter the antegrade effective refractory period of the accessory pathway or the atrial paced cycle length at which block occurred in the accessory pathway. After flestolol, the percent of preexcited QRS complexes during AF increased (60 +/- 10 vs 87 +/- 5%, p = 0.01). Despite this, the ventricular rate slowed, with increases in mean RR interval (382 +/- 20 vs 416 +/- 22 ms, p = 0.02) and in the shortest interval between preexcited QRS complexes (251 +/- 18 vs 270 +/- 17 ms, p less than 0.01). The effect of isoproterenol 3 to 5 micrograms/min was studied in 5 patients. During atrial pacing, isoproterenol decreased the antegrade refractory period and the atrial paced cycle length of block in the accessory pathway (p less than or equal to 0.05). During AF, it decreased the percent of preexcited QRS complexes, mean RR interval and shortest interval between preexcited QRS complexes (p less than 0.05). Flestolol reversed the effects of isoproterenol both during atrial pacing and AF. Thus, flestolol does not alter conduction over the accessory pathway during atrial pacing, but during AF it slows conduction over the accessory pathway and prevents isoproterenol-mediated increases in ventricular rate. This suggests that in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome sympathetic stimulation after the onset of AF enhances conduction over the accessory pathway and is an important determinant of ventricular rate.", 
    "19": "The norepinephrine-induced inhibition of avian pineal N-acetyltransferase activity appears to be mediated by alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. In this study, alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the chicken pineal gland were directly identified by radioligand binding. Membrane preparations of pineal glands from chickens from 1 to 6 weeks of age were examined using [3H]rauwolscine, a selective alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, to characterize the binding sites. The results indicate no ontological change in either the affinity (KD) or density of receptor binding sites (Bmax) during the time span examined. The binding was saturable and of high affinity with a mean KD of 0.27 +/- 0.01 nM and a mean Bmax of 242 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein. Further characterization of these binding sites indicated that the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor is of the alpha 2A subtype, since prazosin and ARC-239 bound with low affinities and oxymetazoline bound with high affinity.", 
    "20": "The effects of a mid-term antihypertensive treatment with Acebutolol (A) 400 mg once-daily alone, Enalapril (E) 20 mg once-daily alone and their combination (A + E) in 12 hypertensive patients (pts.) have been evaluated. The diastolic (DBP) and systolic (SBP) blood pressure values have been evaluated in supine and upright position and at the end of an exercise test. Basic values obtained after 3 weeks of treatment with placebo have been matched with values observed after 3 months of each treatment (A; A + E; E). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination, pts. were divided into two groups: the first group was given A, than A + E and finally E; in the second group the order was reversed. Our findings showed a more significant reduction of DBP in supine and upright position and after exercise (p less than .05) and of SBP in supine and upright position (p less than .05) after treatment with E. The addition of A to E did not produce a further significant reduction in blood pressure values except after exercise (p less than .01).", 
    "21": "Effect of acute administration of a benzodiazepine-inverse agonist, FG-7142, on forced swimming-induced depression was investigated in mice. A single injection of FG-7142 (40 mg/kg) showed a delayed increase in behavioral despair, the peak effect being observed on the 5th and 6th day of FG-7142 administration. beta-Adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline significantly potentiated FG-7142-induced behavioral despair. FG-7142-induced depression was sensitive to reversal by chronic treatment with propranolol or desipramine. These observations suggest that the inverse agonist FG-7142 upregulates beta-adrenoceptor population leading to behavioral despair in mice.", 
    "22": "Previous studies have documented potentially adverse effects of diuretics and beta-blocking agents on plasma lipid profiles. This study was designed to establish the effects on lipid profiles of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors lisinopril and enalapril, alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), the calcium-channel blocker nitrendipine, HCTZ, and hydralazine. After a two-week, single-blind, placebo phase, 77 patients with essential hypertension were given active agent as monotherapy in a double-blind fashion for 8-20 weeks. The dose of each agent was titrated to achieve diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. At the end of placebo and treatment phases, plasma was analyzed for triglycerides, total cholesterol, and high-(HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Overall, few changes in lipid contents were noted. Total cholesterol decreased during therapy with hydralazine but increased in patients receiving the combination of lisinopril and HCTZ. HDL cholesterol was depressed in those taking HCTZ alone and in combination with lisinopril. LDL cholesterol was lowered during therapy with hydralazine but was otherwise unaffected by all other agents. None of the agents evaluated significantly affected triglyceride concentrations. Thus, monotherapy with lisinopril, enalapril, and nitrendipine do not affect plasma lipid concentrations. Hydralazine lowers total and LDL cholesterol. If these findings are confirmed in trials with larger numbers of patients, these effects on lipid profiles may influence choice of agent in the therapy of essential hypertension.", 
    "23": "Although finger temperature feedback has been used to produce digital vasodilation in normal persons and those with Raynaud's disease, the mechanism and site of this effect have not been studied. In the present investigation, feedback-induced vasodilation was attenuated by brachial artery infusions of propranolol in infused, but not contralateral, hands and was not affected by digital nerve blockade. Quantitative measurements of finger blood flow demonstrated that this vasodilation occurred in arteriovenous shunts in normal persons and in the finger capillary bed in those with Raynaud's disease. Raynaud's disease patients who received finger temperature feedback reported 80 fewer percent symptoms 1 and 2 years after treatment and retained the ability to increase finger temperature and capillary blood flow at these times. These effects were not shown by patients given autogenic training, a relaxation procedure.", 
    "24": "In vitro studies suggest that neonates and adults may have different cardiac chronotropic responses to alpha-adrenergic stimulation. To investigate these differences in vivo, three groups of dogs were studied. Group I = 12 puppies, ages 3-7 days; group II = 12 puppies ages 8-15 days, and group III = seven adult dogs. Heart rate and blood pressure determinations were made in the control setting and then after combined beta-adrenergic and parasympathetic blockade (propranolol 0.6 mg/kg and bilateral vagotomies). Alpha-stimulation was then achieved with phenylephrine given in doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 10.0 micrograms/kg/min. A second, high dose of propranolol (1.0 mg/kg intravenously) was administered after the highest phenylephrine infusion dosage to assure complete beta-blockade. Finally, alpha-blockade was achieved with phentolamine (groups I and II: 0.5 mg intravenously; group III: 5.0 mg intravenously). An alpha-mediated positive chronotropic effect was observed in 42 and 100% of subjects in groups I and II, respectively, but never observed in the adults. Whereas alpha-blockade with phentolamine resulted in a large decrease in heart rate of all puppies (groups I and II), it had no effect on adults. Blood pressure responses were similar in all three groups. Thus, there are important maturational changes in the chronotropic response to alpha-adrenergic stimulation and blockade demonstrable in the intact neonatal canine.", 
    "25": "Noradrenergic centrifugal inputs to the rat olfactory bulb mainly terminate on granule cells, which are inhibitory interneurons. In the mature bulb, norepinephrine suppresses granule cell activity, thus increasing the excitability of the primary output neurons of the bulb. However, since the majority of granule cells develop postnatally, the effectiveness of noradrenergic inputs to the bulb during development is unclear. The present report describes the postnatal development of noradrenergic modulation of olfactory bulb function by examining the effects of noradrenergic beta-receptor agonists and antagonists on paired-pulse inhibition at the granule cell/mitral cell reciprocal synapse. The results demonstrate that noradrenergic modulation of olfactory bulb excitability emerges during the first postnatal week in the rat. These results suggest that noradrenergic centrifugal control of olfactory bulb activity appears early during postnatal development, and thus is capable of playing an important role in pup responses to olfactory cues early in life.", 
    "26": "The cellular localization of beta-adrenergic and prostaglandin (PG) receptors and their effects on adenylate cyclase activity (AC) and testosterone production in vitro were investigated in a transplantable rat Leydig cell tumor (H-540). Separation of the tumor cells in Percoll gradients revealed that the specific binding of [3H]PGE1 and [125I]Cyanopindolol was found in the same fraction as that of [125I]LH. This fraction--judged by light microscopy of smears--consisted of tumor Leydig cells. In addition, [125I]cyanopindolol was found specifically bound in the red blood cell fraction. In the Leydig tumor cells, approx 25% of the beta-adrenergic receptors was identified as beta 1-receptors, whereas approx 75% of the receptors were of the beta 2-subtype. The AC in Percoll purified Leydig tumor cells was stimulated by hCG (6-fold), PGE1 (2-fold), PGE2 (1.5-fold), PGI1 (2-fold) and isoproterenol (2-fold). The AC in the red blood cell fraction was stimulated by isoproterenol whereas the PGs and hCG had little or no effect. hCG, isoproterenol and PGE1 were able to stimulate testosterone production in vitro. At 44 h incubation, PGE1 was the most potent stimulator of testosterone production. In conclusion, tumor Leydig cells possess hCG, PGE1, PGI2 and beta-adrenergic receptors coupled to the AC. PGE1 and beta-adrenergic agonists stimulate testosterone production after prolonged incubation in vitro.", 
    "27": "Liver regeneration is controlled by a complex network of interactions between hormones, growth factors, and a variety of hepatotrophic factors. Transient increases in cAMP in the early stages of liver regeneration that are necessary for DNA synthesis and subsequent mitosis have been reported; however, studies on the mechanisms that control cellular cAMP levels during liver regeneration, namely adenylate cyclase activity, cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase activity, and cAMP efflux from the cell, have been generally incomplete. In this study we have shown that although there are three peaks in intracellular cAMP levels in the first 24 hours after partial hepatectomy, the adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by glucagon, prostaglandin E2, adrenaline, and fluoride in vitro decreases with time. KD and BMAX of hepatocyte glucagon and beta receptors were similar to the sham controls. Our results are consistent with a mixed homologous/heterologous desensitization of the adenylate cyclase system. There was also a loss of cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase activity after partial hepatectomy. We speculate that even though the hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase system has been desensitized, the system retains the ability to respond to the transient pulses of the variety of hormones secreted after partial hepatectomy and thus raise the intracellular concentration of cAMP. The decrease in cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase may be necessary to prevent rapid breakdown of cAMP.", 
    "28": "Previously we reported that immunoreactive angiotensin II (Ang II) release from isolated perfused rat mesenteric arteries was mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor activation. However, the precise mechanism of regulation of vascular renin-angiotensin is not completely understood. In this study, we examined the effect of indomethacin and meclofenamate on immunoreactive angiotensin I (Ang I) and immunoreactive Ang II release from perfused rat hind leg vasculature to delineate the possible relevance of prostaglandins to the vascular renin-angiotensin system in vitro. We also examined the effects of isoproterenol and propranolol on the immunoreactive Ang I and II release. Isolated rat hind legs were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution, and immunoreactive Ang I and II released into the perfusate were measured directly by using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge connected to the perfusion system. Indomethacin and meclofenamate (10(-8) to 2 X 10(-6) M) added to the perfusion medium suppressed immunoreactive Ang I and II release to similar extents in a dose-dependent manner (p less than 0.001); the maximal percent inhibition of immunoreactive Ang II release evoked by these inhibitors (2 X 10(-6) M) was 60 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001) for indomethacin and 50 +/- 4% (p less than 0.001) for meclofenamate. Isoproterenol (10(-6) M) failed to cause a change in the release of both peptides, but propranolol (10(-6) M) slightly decreased the release of immunoreactive Ang I and II by 28 +/- 4% (p less than 0.001) and 32 +/- 4% (p less than 0.001), respectively. There was a highly significant positive correlation between the released amount of immunoreactive Ang I and that of immunoreactive Ang II altered by indomethacin (r = 0.91), meclofenamate (r = 0.94), or propranolol administration (r = 0.90). These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin in the hind legs is modulated by prostaglandins and that a difference exists in the beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated release of Ang II among diverse vascular beds.", 
    "29": "The acute effects of intravenous metoprolol were evaluated in 30 patients with myocardial infarction by means of serial hemodynamic and radionuclide measurements of left ventricular function. Within 1 hour of completion of the metoprolol dosing, 90% of the patients underwent cardiac catheterization to define anatomy and to assess patients for interventional therapy; the remainder had catheterization by 72 hours. All patients tolerated intravenous metoprolol without significant side effects. Patient responses to therapy were divided into two groups based on the angiographic findings. At catheterization, all group 1 patients had visible collaterals to or a patent vessel supplying the vascular distribution of the infarction. All group 2 patients had occluded coronary arteries without evidence of collaterals to the infarct zone. Group 1 (n = 13) improved both systolic and diastolic left ventricular function (mean ejection fraction [EF] = 46% to 55%, peak filling rate [PFR] = 2.1 to 3.2 Edv/sec), while group 2 (n = 17) patients were unchanged (EF = 43% to 42%, PFR = 2.0 to 1.9). Patient characteristics and time to treatment were similar in both groups, as were the hemodynamic effects of metoprolol. Heart rate decreased 20% in group 1 and 22% in group 2 and cardiac output fell 22% in group 1 and 32% in group 2. Acute improvement in ventricular function in these patients appears to be closely related to the coronary anatomy, and in those with flow to the infarct zone, intravenous metoprolol may be effective in preserving left ventricular function.", 
    "30": "Purified IgG from BALB/c mouse anti-C3H serum exerts positive inotropic and chronotropic effects in C3H mouse atria and induces testosterone synthesis in C3H mouse Leydig cells. The effect depends on IgG concentration and can be abolished by beta-adrenergic-receptor and luteinizing hormone-receptor antagonists. IgG interferes with the binding of dihydroalprenolol and luteinizing hormone. Monoclonal antibodies against major histocompatibility complex class I antigens were active on the Leydig cells of C3H and BALB/c mice. There was a parallelism between the effect of each individual monoclonal antibody with specificity for a particular haplotype and the response of the target cell from the strains carrying such haplotypes. These antibodies could precipitate the soluble luteinizing hormone-receptor complex. The results suggested that bound hormone triggers the association of major histocompatibility class I antigen with the receptor, thereby activating the respective target cells.", 
    "31": "The location and proportions of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors in canine coronary arteries (0.5-2 mm) has been examined by autoradiography. X-ray film and nuclear emulsion-coated coverslips were exposed to sections of coronary artery previously incubated with [125I]iodocyanopindolol (50 pM) in the absence and presence of ICI 118,551 (70 nM) to block beta-2 adrenoceptors, CGP 20712A (100 nM) to block beta-1 adrenoceptors or (-)-propranolol (1 microM) to define nonspecific binding. The medial smooth muscle of the coronary artery had an even distribution of beta-1 adrenoceptors and two populations of beta-2 adrenoceptors, one evenly distributed and the other highly localized. Beta-2 adrenoceptors were also located on nerve tissue and in the adventitia. There was no evidence for localization of beta adrenoceptors on endothelial cells. Quantitative autoradiography was performed using computer-assisted image processing and the program AVID. The binding of [125I]cyanopindolol was saturable (KD = 50 pM) and competition binding curves with the beta-1 selective antagonist CGP 20712A and beta-2 selective antagonist ICI 118,551 showed beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors in the proportions of 85:15% in both 0.5- and 2-mm arteries.", 
    "32": "In the present study we investigated whether the beta adrenoceptor subtype binding activity in plasma samples can predict selective and nonselective beta blockade in humans. From the right shifts of isoprenaline dose-response curves 0 to 84 hr after administration of propranolol and the beta-1 selective bisoprolol, in vivo beta blockade was assessed. In an in vitro radioreceptor assay with membrane preparations of beta-1 or beta-2 adrenoceptors, plasma samples were assayed for subtype selective blocking activity. After propranolol administration, in vitro beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor occupancy declined from initially 97% to less than 10% within 48 hr. An isoprenaline dose ratio (DR)-1 of 1 coincided with a 50% occupancy of the beta-1 or the beta-2 subtype in vitro. In Schild-plots using plasma concentrations (radioreceptor assay) and the isoprenaline DR-1 for heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and inotropy (QS2C), slopes of unity were observed. After bisoprolol administration, in vitro beta-1 occupancy shifted from initially 95% to less than 10% within 72 hr. For the beta-2 subtype, an occupancy of greater than 10% was detectable only within the first 12 hr. An isoprenaline DR-1 of 1 coincided with a 50% occupancy of beta-1 adrenoceptors. The bisoprolol Schild-plots yielded a slope of unity for inotropy, but less than unity for the heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. From an extended analysis of subtype selective antagonism in Schild-plots, the fractions of the beta-2 adrenoceptor subtype participating in the isoprenaline response were calculated: heart rate 0.45 +/- 0.12 and diastolic blood pressure 0.23 +/- 0.13. It is concluded that in vitro receptor occupancy can predict beta blockade in humans for propranolol. Beta adrenoceptor subtype-mediated effects in humans can be evaluated with a selective antagonist and a refined analysis of Schild-plot data.", 
    "33": "The effects of repeated footshock stress on the chronotropic responsiveness of the isolated right atria were studied. Repeated footshock stress was found to produce supersensitivity to isoproterenol and epinephrine (increase of 4.6- and 1.99-fold at pD2 level, respectively), but not to norepinephrine. Experiments using salbutamol, in the presence of an effective blocking concentration of metoprolol, showed that footshock stress increases the sensitivity (2.69-fold at pD2 level) to the selective beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist. Footshock stress had no effect on the atrial sensitivity to theophylline (1.09-fold at pD2 level). Addition of butoxamine (1 microM) suppressed footshock-induced pacemaker supersensitivity to isoproterenol and epinephrine. Footshock stress causes a small (3.23-fold) but pharmacologically unimportant increase in pacemaker pA2 value of metoprolol. However, footshock stress induces a large increase in the pacemaker beta-2 adrenoceptor affinity for butoxamine (11.48-fold, pA2 value). It is concluded that repeated footshock stress acts primarily to increase the chronotropic function of pacemaker beta-2 adrenoceptors, thus causing supersensitivity to isoproterenol, epinephrine and salbutamol.", 
    "34": "We have characterized the beta-adrenergic receptor binding site and the beta-adrenergic cAMP response of the HL-60 cell. The hydrophilic ligand [3H]-(-)-CGP-12177 was specifically and reversibly bound to one single class of binding sites (Kd 220 pM and Bmax 1,970 sites/cell). The adrenergic agonists inhibited the specific radioligand binding. The order of potency was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. The beta-2 selective antagonist ICI 118551 had a binding affinity 3 orders of potency higher than the beta-1 selective antagonist, atenolol. The adrenergic agonists elevated the cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent mode. The order of potency was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. Both the binding and the functional studies revealed stereospecificity and reversibility. The present data show that HL-60 cells possess beta-2 adrenergic receptors functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase.", 
    "35": "Acid secretion is conducted by the parietal cell of the gastric mucosa. The H+,K+-ATPase has been shown to be specifically located to this cell and during recent years been recognized as the gastric proton pump. Omeprazole, a known inhibitor of acid secretion, administered in vivo was found to bind specifically to the H+,K+-ATPase of the rabbit gastric mucosa. A stoichiometry of 2.1 mol radiolabel per mol phosphoenzyme was calculated at total inhibition of the H+,K+-ATPase enzyme activity. In isolated gastric glands prepared from omeprazole-treated animals, the secretagogue-induced increase in oxygen consumption, related to acid secretion, was inhibited to the same level as the H+,K+-ATPase activity. Both the degree of acid secretion inhibition induced by omeprazole and the amount of inhibitor bound to the H+,K+-ATPase were found to be dependent on the stimulation state of the parietal cell. Inhibition of secretion by the H2-receptor blocker ranitidine prior to omeprazole treatment prevented both the inhibition of H+,K+-ATPase and oxygen consumption normally observed with omeprazole and, furthermore, reduced the binding levels of radiolabel to the enzyme. Inhibition of acid secretion by the H+,K+-ATPase inhibitor SCH 28080 totally prevented the binding of radiolabel to the H+,K+-ATPase. The inhibition by omeprazole could be fully reversed in gastric glands and H+,K+-ATPase isolated from omeprazole-treated animals by addition of beta-mercaptoethanol. The major product formed during reactivation was the reduced form of omeprazole, compound H 168/22. Neutralization of the gastric glands in vitro with imidazole totally prevented the inhibitory action of omeprazole. These experiments demonstrate the necessity of acid for the inhibition of gastric acid secretion by omeprazole and the binding of the inhibitor to the H+,K+-ATPase, both in vivo and in vitro, and also the specificity of omeprazole for the H+,K+-ATPase.", 
    "36": "Tritium-labeled dihydroalprenolol was used to quantify the beta-adrenergic receptor sites in day 30 fetal rabbit lung tissue. Each of the fetuses of New Zealand White rabbits on day 28 of gestation was injected with dihydrotestosterone (2.0 micrograms) in one horn of the uterus and 10% ethanol in normal saline (the solvent) in the contralateral one. The animals were sacrificed 48 hours later and the fetal lung tissue was assayed. Dihydrotestosterone decreased the beta-adrenergic receptor site number in the treatment group compared with the control group (86 versus 111 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05 by paired t-test). In the presence of dihydrotestosterone, beta-adrenergic receptor binding is inhibited in the preterm fetal rabbit. This effect may be implicated in the beta-adrenergic mediation of phospholipid synthesis and/or release by fetal alveolar cells.", 
    "37": "The nervous regulation of heart rate and stroke volume in the Atlantic cod Gadus morhua was investigated both in vivo, during rest and exercise, and in vitro. The cholinergic and adrenergic influences on the heart were estimated in experiments with injections of atropine and sotalol. At rest the cholinergic and adrenergic tonus on the heart were 38% and 21%, respectively (ratio 1.81:1). At the end of an exercise period, the cholinergic tonus had decreased to 15% but the adrenergic tonus had increased to 28% (ratio 0.54:1). The results suggest that variation of the cholinergic tonus on the heart is a major factor in the regulation of the heart rate. In one group of fish, cardiac output was also measured, allowing calculation of stroke volume. Cardiac output increased significantly during exercise, and this effect persisted in the presence of both atropine and sotalol, although the increase in heart rate was reduced or abolished. The persisting increase in cardiac output during exercise is due to an increase in stroke volume, reflecting a Starling relationship. In the presence of the adrenergic neurone-blocking agent bretylium, a positive inotropic effect on isolated, paced atrial and ventricular strips was observed. In the atrial preparations the effect persisted after 24 h. The effect was prevented by pretreatment with sotalol or cocaine, but potentiated by phentolamine pretreatment. This shows that bretylium exerts its neurone-blocking action after being taken up into the adrenergic nerves, and suggests that the positive inotropic effect of bretylium observed in vivo is due to release of endogenous catecholamines. The concentration-response curves for adrenaline on isolated spontaneously beating atrial preparations showed that the concentrations of catecholamines necessary to produce appreciable effects on the heart are higher than the concentrations found in cod plasma during 'stress' situations (handling and exhaustive swimming).", 
    "38": "In a double-blind randomized study, hydralazine (n = 59) or the new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist felodipine (n = 61) was added to previous treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents in a group of 120 patients with essential hypertension. Active treatment with either hydralazine or felodipine was given for 8 weeks after a 4-week placebo run-in period, at the end of which all patients had supine diastolic blood pressures greater than 95 mm Hg. Assessment of the results according to the intention to treat principle showed that felodipine was significantly more effective than hydralazine at the doses employed, reducing systolic blood pressure 10-19 mm Hg more than hydralazine and reducing diastolic blood pressure 5-11 mm Hg more than hydralazine (95% confidence intervals). The number of patients complaining of side effects, the number of complaints, and the number of patients that had to be withdrawn from treatment were numerically higher during treatment with hydralazine than with felodipine, but these differences were not statistically significant. Against this background it is concluded that felodipine is superior to hydralazine when added to an antihypertensive regimen consisting of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents.", 
    "39": "The present study examined the actions of dilevalol, an antihypertensive beta-adrenoceptor blocker with arterial vasodilator actions, on aortic compliance (AC) in anesthetized dogs. AC was measured by sonomicrometric determination of the ratio of aortic systolic-diastolic diameters (mm) and arterial pulse pressure (mm Hg). One AC unit (ACU) equals 10(-3) mm/mm Hg. Dilevalol (0.032, 0.1, and 3.2 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) significantly (p less than .05) increased AC by 1.4 +/- 0.3, 3.7 +/- 1.4, and 4.5 +/- 1.2 ACU from basal values of 4.7 +/- 0.4-5.6 +/- 0.4 ACU while reducing blood pressure by 20 +/- 2, 31 +/- 9, and 41 +/- 10 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.05). Increases in AC were not the passive result of altered blood pressure. Proximal mechanical aortic occlusion dropped systolic blood pressure as much as 70 mm Hg without altering AC. Hydralazine also (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg i.v.) lowered blood pressure significantly (p less than 0.05) by 14 +/- 3 and 40 +/- 4 mm Hg but increased AC only at 1.0 mg/kg (+ 1.6 +/- 0.4 ACU, p less than 0.05). Phenylephrine (1-30 micrograms/kg i.v.) significantly raised blood pressure 25 +/- 3-95 +/- 8 mm Hg but decreased AC significantly by 1.2 +/- 0.3-2.4 +/- 0.3 ACU. Isoproterenol (ISO) (0.01-1.0 micrograms/kg) produced effects on AC similar to those of dilevalol. Propranolol pretreatment attenuated dilevalol and ISO-induced increases in AC. Propranolol (0.32 and 1.0 mg/kg) did not significantly change AC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "The aim of the present study was 1) to characterize qualitatively the positive inotropic effect of the Ca-channel activator BAY K 8644 and to compare this response to response-types with known and different relationship to the cyclic AMP (cAMP) system (e.g. responses elicited through alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation) and 2) to study the effect of simultaneous muscarinic cholinergic stimulation upon the BAY K 8644 response in order to further evaluate the role of the cAMP system in this response. The responses were evaluated in isolated, electrically paced, isometrically contracting papillary muscles from rat heart. Isometric tension (Tmax), rate of rise and decline of tension (first derivative = T') and rate of transition from tension rise to tension decline (negative part of second derivative = T\") were recorded. In the presence of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocker prazosin (10(-7) mol/l) and the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker timolol (10(-6) mol/l), the positive inotropic effect of 1.7 x 10(-6) mol/l BAY K 8644 developed rather slowly with a time to half maximal effect of about 4 minutes. Qualitatively the response was characterized by an almost proportional (\"symmetrical\") increase in all parts of the contraction-relaxation cycle with a small prolongation of time to peak tension and of the duration of the whole cycle. This response contrasted sharply with the cAMP-dependent response to beta-receptor stimulation (beta-type response with shortening of time to peak tension), but was very similar to the cAMP-independent response to alpha-receptor stimulation (alpha-type response).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "In the small intestine of urethane-anesthetized rats, i.v. neurokinins (NKs) (0.043-14 nmol/kg) produce three distinct motor effects, e.g.: 1) a transient relaxation followed by 2) a phasic contraction and 3) a tonic contraction. The aim of this study was to characterize the nature of the receptor determining the transient relaxation and mechanisms involved. The transient relaxation was more evident in the distal than in the proximal duodenum or in the jejunum. The rank order of potency of NKs in producing relaxation was NKA greater than substance P greater than NKB. The heptapeptide NKA(4-10) was as potent as the decapeptide NKA in determining relaxation but less potent than NKA in producing phasic or tonic contraction. NKA (0.43 nmol/kg i.v.)-induced relaxation and tonic contraction were unaffected by [D-Pro2, D-Trp7.g]substance P, a compound which, in this tissue, acts as a NK-1 receptor antagonist. NKA (0.43 nmol/kg i.v.)-induced relaxation of the distal duodenum was unaffected by atropine, hexamethonium or adrenalectomy, reduced by phentolamine plus propranolol and abolished by guanethidine or acute (15 min before) removal of the celiac ganglion complex. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of a NK-2 receptor located on postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the prevertebral ganglia produces the intestinal relaxation in response to i.v. NKs.", 
    "42": "The mechanism by which alpha 2-adrenergic agonists inhibit exocytosis was investigated in electrically permeabilized insulin secreting RINm5F cells. In this preparation alpha 2-adrenoceptors remain coupled to adenylate cyclase, since basal- and forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production was lowered by epinephrine and clonidine by 30-50%. Cyclic AMP levels did not correlate with the rate of insulin secretion. Thus, at low Ca2+, forskolin enhanced cyclic AMP levels 5-fold without eliciting secretion, and Ca2+-stimulated secretion was associated with decreased cyclic AMP accumulation. Epinephrine (plus propranolol) inhibited Ca2+-induced insulin secretion in a GTP-dependent manner. The maximal inhibition (43%) occurred at 500 microM GTP. Clonidine also inhibited Ca2+-stimulated secretion. Replacement of GTP by GDP or by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate as well as treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin prior to permeabilization abolished epinephrine inhibition of insulin secretion. Pertussis toxin did not affect Ca2+-stimulated secretion. Insulin release stimulated by 1,2-didecanoyl glycerol was also lowered by epinephrine suggesting an effect distal to the activation of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme). These results taken together with the ability of epinephrine to inhibit ionomycin-induced insulin secretion in intact cells suggest that alpha 2-adrenergic inhibition is distal to the generation of second messengers. A model is proposed for alpha 2-adrenoceptor coupling to two effector systems, namely the adenylate cyclase and the exocytotic site in insulin-secreting cells.", 
    "43": "The haemodynamic effects of combinations of antihypertensive drugs were tested in an open trial on 15 patients with essential arterial hypertension. The following combinations were used: Piretanid/Captopril, Piretanid/Urapidil and Acebutolol/Piretanid. All three combinations significantly lowered arterial pressure at rest and on exercise. Both Piretanid/Captopril and Piretanid/Urapidil reduced the arterial pressure exclusively by reduction of the peripheral resistance, while cardiac output rose. On the other hand, Acebutolol/Piretanid reduced the blood pressure through reduction of cardiac output, less so by lowering the peripheral resistance. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure, as a measure of left-ventricular filling pressure, fell under Piretanid/Captopril and Piretanid/Urapidil, remaining high under Acebutolol/Piretanid. Thus the combinations of Piretanid/Captopril and Piretanid/Urapidil are most likely to fulfill the demands to be placed on an \"ideal\" antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "44": "Eye-drops containing beta-blockers are widely used by ophthalmologists in the treatment of chronic glaucoma, since they reduce the intraocular pressure by about 25-30 per cent. This treatment is usually well tolerated but not devoid of systemic effects. The eye-drops are rapidly removed by the lacrymal system, and 80 per cent of the drug is absorbed by the nasal mucosa. It is then taken up by the blood stream in low but not negligible concentrations, and since the liver is by-passed the active substance acts directly on the target organs. Side-effects are similar to those observed after oral administration, despite much lower plasma levels; although rare in routine clinical practice, they may result in decompensation of a fragile cardiac or respiratory function. This does not mean that beta-blocker eye-drops should not be prescribed to patients with chronic glaucoma, but attention must be paid to the patient's cardio-respiratory status and to a possible concomitant treatment with drugs that depress myocardial conductivity or contractility.", 
    "45": "We studied the effects of a new topical angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, SCH 33861, in lowering intraocular pressure in 20 patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma. In a double-masked, four-way crossover study with placebo and timolol, SCH 33861 was well tolerated and effective in lowering intraocular pressure. The magnitude of the drug's effect in lowering intraocular pressure was less than that of timolol 0.5%.", 
    "46": "The catecholamine binding domain of the turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptor was mapped by determining the sites of covalent labeling of the purified receptor by two beta-adrenergic photoaffinity reagents, [125I]iodocyanopindolol-diazirine (ICYP-da) and [125I] iodoazidobenzylpindolol (IABP). Both labels were incorporated at two separate sites. By sequencing a labeled peptide, one site of labeling was found to lie at Trp330 in the extracellular half of the seventh membrane span. This position is homologous to the retinal attachment site in rhodopsin. The second labeled site was isolated on an 8000-Da peptide and immunoprecipitated using sequence-directed antibodies. This site lies in membrane spans 3-5. Labeling of the two sites was equal using ICYP-da and 3-10-fold greater in the span 7 site using IABP. These data indicate that the catecholamine binding site is formed from the juxtaposition of span 7 and spans 3-5 in a tertiary structure probably similar to that of rhodopsin.", 
    "47": "The slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential (slow IPSP), the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (slow EPSP), the late slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (late slow EPSP), and the fast excitatory postsynaptic potential/compound action potential (fast EPSP) were recorded from the 9th or 10th paravertebral sympathetic ganglia of bullfrogs (and some Rana pipiens frogs) by the sucrose-gap technique. The adrenergic antagonists phentolamine, dihydroergotamine and propranolol did not show any antagonistic effect on the slow IPSP when used at concentrations of up to 10, 100 and 10 microM, respectively. U-0521 (3',4'-dihydroxy-2-methylpropriophenone, 50 micrograms/ml), a specific inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase, did not show any potentiating effect on the slow IPSP. The cholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine (0.5-1 microM) induced a large increase in the duration and amplitude of slow IPSP. When phentolamine and propranolol at concentrations greater than 10 microM were used the slow IPSP (and all other synaptic potentials) were non-specifically reduced in amplitude by these drugs. The results reported in this paper do not lend any support to the hypothesis that the slow IPSP in frog sympathetic ganglia is mediated by an adrenergic interneuron. The results are consistent with the proposal that the slow IPSP in this ganglion is mediated by a direct action of acetylcholine released from cholinergic preganglionic fibers.", 
    "48": "Agonist-induced degradation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is of interest as this pathway of diacylglycerol (DG) generation may provide added opportunities for the regulation of protein kinase C (PKC). In REF52 cells [3H]myristic acid is preferentially incorporated into PC; this, coupled with the use of [3H]choline, allows for quantitation of both the water-soluble and the lipid products generated when PC is degraded. In cells prelabeled with [3H]choline, TPA stimulated a time-dependent release, into the medium, of choline and not phosphocholine or glycerophosphocholine. Treatment of [3H]myristic acid-labeled cells with either phorbol diesters, sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, or vasopressin elicited the formation of labeled phosphatidate (PA) and DG. The temporal pattern of PC hydrolysis in cells treated with TPA is indicative of a precursor (PA)-product (DG) relationship for an enzymatic sequence initiated by phospholipase D. Adding propranolol, a phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor, eliminated TPA-induced DG formation, whereas PA generation was unaffected. From these data we conclude that TPA elicits DG formation from PC by the sequential actions of phospholipase D and phosphatidate phosphohydrolase.", 
    "49": "We show that following one cycle of alprenolol affinity chromatography of turkey erythrocyte beta 1-adrenoceptors, electrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels in digitonin, followed by electroelution, results in complete receptor purification. The overall yield from the electrofocusing-electroelution step of turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenoceptor is 75 +/- 3%. In addition, we are able to demonstrate that receptor-binding assays can be performed directly on the polyacrylamide gel, using 125I-cyanopindolol. This method can be employed for minute quantities of receptor which is an advantage when one wishes to characterize rapidly the beta-adrenoceptor in its native state from tissues that may be available only in limited amounts. We also report, for comparison, on the behavior of the turkey erythrocyte beta 1-adrenoceptor on immobiline polyacrylamide gels and the ability to purify only partially the receptor on these gels.", 
    "50": "To investigate the regulation of beta 2AR expression in rat ventral prostate the effects of castration and testosterone replacement on the beta 2AR were studied by ligand binding and Northern blot analysis. Orchidectomy depressed beta 2AR number by 50% within 4 days and testosterone administration to 4-day castrates produced a rapid and complete recovery of beta 2AR number within 24 h. In contrast to receptor number, beta 2AR mRNA levels did not change relative to total RNA following castration. However, during the testosterone replacement period beta 2AR mRNA levels rose transiently, reaching a maximum (3.5-fold) between 8 and 12 h, and this increase in mRNA preceded the recovery in beta 2AR number in the membrane. Regulation of beta 2AR gene expression by testosterone in the ventral prostate is thus complex and probably involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional components.", 
    "51": "Further analyses of the Medical Research Council's trial of drug treatment of mild hypertension were carried out to provide more detailed information on the benefits associated with treatment in various subgroups. The four main considerations in establishing a rational treatment policy were, firstly, the significant reduction in the stroke rate with active treatment; secondly, the absence of a significant overall treatment effect on myocardial infarction; thirdly, the knowledge that of 100 untreated men in the highest risk group (those aged 55-64 with high systolic pressure at entry who smoked), five would be expected to suffer a stroke and 10 a coronary event within five years; and, fourthly, the cost, in clinical and financial terms, of prolonged treatment. In the high risk group of 100 men treatment with bendrofluazide would result in the prevention of three or four of the five strokes but would have little effect on the expected numbers of myocardial infarctions. Treatment with propranolol in non-smoking men in the highest age and blood pressure categories would lead to a reduction in the number having strokes from three to one or two and might possibly reduce the number experiencing myocardial infarction from seven to four. Smokers treated with propranolol would not be expected to benefit. In women avoiding smoking was particularly important. The considerations for preventing stroke were similar to those in men, but no clear guideline was possible on the effect of lowering blood pressure for preventing myocardial infarction in women. Drug treatment reduces the attack rate of certain events in mild hypertension but should not be prescribed routinely for all patients with the disorder.", 
    "52": "The alpha 2 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors, both of which are activated by epinephrine, but which can be differentiated by selective drugs, have opposite effects (inhibitory and stimulatory) on the adenylyl cyclase system. The two receptors are homologous with each other, rhodopsin, and other receptors coupled to guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins and they contain seven hydrophobic domains, which may represent transmembrane spanning segments. The function of specific structural domains of these receptors was determined after construction and expression of a series of chimeric alpha 2-,beta 2-adrenergic receptor genes. The specificity for coupling to the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein lies within a region extending from the amino terminus of the fifth hydrophobic domain to the carboxyl terminus of the sixth. Major determinants of alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist and antagonist ligand binding specificity are contained within the seventh membrane spanning domain. Chimeric receptors should prove useful for elucidating the structural basis of receptor function.", 
    "53": "beta-Adrenergic ligand binding to trout (Salmo gairdneri) and carp (Cyprinus carpio) red cells using a hydrophobic (3H-DHA) and a hydrophilic (3H-CGP) ligand was studied. Conditions which lead to the appearance (in vivo and in vitro hypoxia in carp cells) or disappearance (\"winter\" acclimation history in trout red cells) of beta-adrenergic responses were associated with either an appearance or marked increase of isoproterenol-displaceable binding (carp), or a disappearance of isoproterenol-displaceable binding (trout), respectively. The apparent number of binding sites was markedly greater for the hydrophobic than for the hydrophilic ligand, suggesting that binding of the hydrophobic ligand to internalized receptors and to nonreceptor sites may affect the results obtained with intact cells.", 
    "54": "The catecholamine and cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation were studied in 20 patients who underwent elective gynaecological surgery and who were allocated randomly to receive either practolol 10 mg or saline intravenously prior to induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and thiopentone; atracurium was administered and the lungs were ventilated artificially with 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Tracheal intubation was performed when muscle relaxation was adequate. Arterial pressure, heart rate, plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations were measured before and after tracheal intubation. A significant increase in catecholamine concentrations occurred in both groups in response to tracheal intubation but the magnitude of the increase in adrenaline was greater in the practolol group. There were no significant differences in arterial pressure or heart rate changes between the groups. We conclude that pretreatment with practolol is of no value in the attenuation of the hypertensive response to direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in previously normotensive patients.", 
    "55": "This paper presents a statistical analysis of treatment effects in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recordings. The statistical models account for circadian rhythms, subject effects, and the effects of treatment with drugs or relaxation therapy. In view of the heterogeneity of the subjects, we fit a separate linear model to the data of each subject, use robust statistical procedures to estimate the parameters of the linear models, and trim the data on a subject by subject basis. We use a meta-analytical method to combine the results of all subjects in the study.", 
    "56": "1. Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from GH3 cells, a clonal cell line initially derived from a rat anterior pituitary tumor, using patch electrodes filled with CsCl or N-methylglucamine chloride (NMG Cl). The bathing medium contained tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA; 20 mM) and NaCl (120 mM) or NMG Cl (140 mM). These conditions resulted in substantial blockade of outward currents. 2. Depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of -50 mV activated transient (T-type) and sustained (L-type) inward Ca2+ currents. In addition, prolonged depolarization (greater than 1 s) invariably elicited a slowly activating inward current that persisted with maintained depolarization, and deactivated slowly on repolarization, resulting in a prominent inward tail current. 3. This tail current could be recorded under conditions where Ca2+ and Cl- were the only membrane-permeant ions (symmetrical NMG Cl). The tail current nulled near 0 mV with symmetrical Cl- and showed a negative reversal potential with nominally Cl--free internal solution. Ba2+ substituted for Ca2+ as a carrier of inward current, but no tail current was expressed. These observations indicate that Cl- is the charge carrier of the slow inward tail current. 4. The voltage dependence for activation of the slow tail current was U-shaped with a peak at approximately -10 mV. This closely paralleled the voltage dependency of the Ca2+ currents. Recordings with 5 mM internal ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) to buffer intracellular Ca2+ to low nM levels exhibited slow inward tail currents that were of lower peak amplitude than with the usual 1.1 mM EGTA-containing pipette solution, but the kinetics of the currents were similar in both cases. In addition, the slow tail current was eliminated on superfusion with the Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+ or with Ca2+-free medium. These results demonstrate that the current is dependent on Ca2+ influx; it is, therefore, referred to as ICl(Ca). 5. Activation of ICl(Ca) required depolarization of at least 1 s. More prolonged depolarizations activated progressively greater current, to a maximum with 6-s depolarization. In most cases, the decay of the tail current was described by a single exponential function with time constant approximately 0.8-0.9 s within the potential range -80 to -30 mV. At more depolarized potentials the decay was slower (increasing e-fold/20-mV change in membrane potential). 6. In a high proportion of cells, ICl(Ca) rapidly diminished in amplitude on repeated activation. This \"rundown\" occurred more rapidly than the rundown of the Ca2+ currents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "57": "The effects of oral propranolol (2 x 80 mg/day) on the contractile responses to twitch and tetanic electrical stimulation were examined in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of seven healthy young males. The TA muscle was fatigued by four forms of repeated isometric contractions: (1) maximal voluntary contractions (MVC), (2) MVC with circulation occluded, (3) electrically evoked contractions with 20 Hz supramaximal voltage stimulation and (4) electrically evoked contractions with circulation occluded. Each contraction was sustained for 10 s with 5 s recovery. Duration of exercise was 10 min for intact circulation and 4 min for circulatory occlusion. Pre-exercise, both the twitch contraction time and the 1/2 relaxation time were significantly (P less than 0.05) longer with beta-blockade than placebo. beta-blockade did not affect torque output during tetanic stimulation or MVC. Immediately post-exercise, the peak twitch torque was reduced in all beta-blocked and placebo conditions except electrically induced exercise with intact circulation. The 1/2 relaxation time was significantly lengthened by repeated MVC with circulation intact; beta-blockade caused a greater lengthening than placebo (P less than 0.05). The tetanic torque was reduced immediately post-exercise at each of 10, 20, 50 and 100 Hz for both beta-blockade and placebo for each form of exercise. There were no significant beta-blockade effects. Torque output at 10 Hz was still reduced up to 10 min post-exercise. In contrast, 100 Hz torque output recovered by 5 min post-exercise. The changes in tetanic responses were qualitatively similar with intact circulation and with circulatory occlusion. In the tibialis anterior muscle, the effects of fatiguing exercise are not accentuated by beta-blockade. These data in the TA are notably different from those in the triceps surae, where greater fatigue has been shown with beta-blockade.", 
    "58": "Ergotamine exposure during pregnancy has been suggested to cause birth defects which have a vascular disruptive aetiology. The present case provides additional support for the possible adverse fetal effects of exposure to ergotamine, caffeine, and propranolol during the first four months of pregnancy. At birth the infant showed evidence of early arrested cerebral maturation and paraplegia. The nature of these defects suggests a primary vascular disruptive aetiology. We hypothesise that ergotamine, acting either alone or in synergy with propranolol and caffeine, produced fetal vasoconstriction resulting in tissue ischaemia and subsequent malformation. This case raises the possibility that fetal malformation may result from concomitant use of multiple vasoconstrictive agents during pregnancy.", 
    "59": "The systemic and coronary hemodynamic effects of combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade produced by oral labetalol were assessed in 12 normotensive patients with angina pectoris and an ischemic electrocardiographic response to exercise stress. At rest, labetalol (200 mg, orally) produced systemic vasodilation (systemic vascular resistance -9%, p less than .01) as aortic pressure fell and cardiac output was unchanged. Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure also fell slightly (17%, p = .05). Systemic vasodilation was not accompanied by reflexly mediated increases in heart rate. Coronary flow and resistance and myocardial oxygen uptake were unchanged. Before labetalol, supine bicycle exercise produced angina in 10 patients. After labetalol, exercise duration was prolonged in 6 of these 10 (average 56%). During exercise, tachycardia was blunted (-7%, p less than .05) as were increases in aortic pressure (-12%, p less than .01) and coronary sinus flow (-25%, p = .03). Cardiac output and LV end-diastolic pressure were similar to control period values. These hemodynamic effects of oral labetalol appeared beneficial, differed from those expected of classic beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and were, in general, similar to those we have observed after intravenous labetalol. The clinical response was good and the drug safe. Labetalol should undergo further evaluation in normotensive as well as hypertensive patients with ischemic heart disease.", 
    "60": "The disposition of propranolol was studied, using dual-route administration, in two groups of six dogs. Each dog was studied on three consecutive days: day 1 awake, day 2 during anaesthesia, and day 3, 24 h after anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was with isoflurane 2.0 MAC (in oxygen) in one group and with a fentanyl-nitrous oxide-atracurium regimen in the other group. In the group receiving fentanyl, anaesthesia caused a significant decrease (63%) in intrinsic clearance from the day 1 value (P less than 0.05) and a 45% decrease in systemic clearance (P less than 0.05). Hepatic plasma flow decreased by 27% (ns). A similar pattern was found with isoflurane: intrinsic clearance decreased by 53% (P less than 0.05) and systemic clearance by 40% (P less than 0.05). Hepatic plasma flow decreased by 40% (ns). In both groups, the values 24 h after anaesthesia were not significantly different from those obtained on day 1. Anaesthesia with either fentanyl-nitrous oxide-atracurium or isoflurane has a marked, but short-lasting effect on the disposition of propranolol, in part as a result of a decrease in intrinsic clearance.", 
    "61": "To evaluate if a drug that affects splanchnic and portal flow reduces intestinal bile acid absorption, we studied the effect of propranolol (40 mg oral dose) both on the response of total bile acids (SBA) to oral chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA 250 mg) and on the estimated hepatic flow by indocyanine green kinetics in 10 healthy and 14 cirrhotic subjects. In 18 subjects who showed a reduction in resting heart rate of almost -5%, propranolol significantly reduced the SBA area under the curve after CDCA in both healthy (mumol/l/h m +/- SD from 181.7 x 144.9 to 56.5 +/- 36.4 p less than 0.02) and cirrhotic (from 1412.1 +/- 1044.8 to 1129.2 +/- 978.8 p less than 0.01) subjects. Variable but not significant modifications were observed in estimated hepatic flow. These results suggest that the propranolol-induced changes in SBA response to CDCA could be a reflex reaction to changes in splanchnic/portal flow.", 
    "62": "Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is known to decrease glucagon release in normal subjects. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of propranolol on the hyperglucagonism commonly observed in patients with cirrhosis. Eight cirrhotic patients and 6 matched healthy controls were studied. The plasma concentrations of glucagon, insulin, c-peptide and glucose were measured in basal conditions and after stimulating glucagon secretion by an i.v. infusion of arginine (0.4 g/kg/30 min). The study was repeated 24 h later after inducing beta-blockade by the i.v. infusion of propranolol (10 mg). In baseline conditions, patients with cirrhosis, despite normal levels of insulin and glucose, had a marked hyperglucagonism (654 +/- 303 pg/ml vs. 269 +/- 90 in controls, P less than 0.01). Prior to propranolol, arginine infusion caused greater glucagon release in cirrhotics (71 +/- 31 ng.h.ml-1) than in controls (33 +/- 17 ng.h.ml-1, P less than 0.02), but despite a similar insulin secretion (assessed from c-peptide), blood glucose did not increase. After propranolol, glucagon secretion decreased as expected in controls (29 +/- 12 ng.h.ml-1, P less than 0.05) but experienced a paradoxical increase in cirrhotics (113 +/- 64 ng.h.ml-1, P less than 0.05). Again, despite the marked increase in glucagon release, there was no increase in glucose production, providing further evidence of the glucagon resistance that accompanies hyperglucagonism in cirrhosis. Our results suggest that hyperglucagonism with glucagon resistance might be the initial disturbance in carbohydrate metabolism in patients with cirrhosis. Contrary to what could be expected, propranolol does not correct but further accentuates this disturbance.", 
    "63": "Microinjections (25 nl) of glycine into the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in 21 rats elicited dose-dependent increases of arterial pressure and heart rate that were not seen with injections adjacent to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The responses to glycine were neurally mediated and could be blocked either by local pretreatment with strychnine or by combined vagotomy and ganglionic blockade. The data suggest that glycine receptors on, or in the region of, neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus may have a role in the regulation of arterial pressure and heart rate.", 
    "64": "Intrarenal adenosine concentration is threefold greater in the one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rat compared with normotensive animals. Since exogenously administered adenosine may increase renal blood flow by direct vasodilation, inhibition of renin release, or prejunctional interruption of adrenergic neurotransmission, these studies examined whether endogenous intrarenal adenosine maintains renal blood flow distal to renal arterial stenosis. Administration of theophylline, which blocks the direct vasodilating effect of adenosine and antagonizes the inhibitory effect of adenosine on renin release and sympathetic neurotransmission, resulted in marked renal vasoconstriction in one-kidney, one clip hypertensive animals. This theophylline-induced renal vasoconstriction was markedly attenuated by angiotensin II blockade with saralasin and was unchanged by renal denervation or beta 1-adrenergic blockade with atenolol. These findings indicate that the marked renal vasoconstriction in one-kidney, one clip hypertension during theophylline administration is mainly mediated by angiotensin II, is to a lesser degree due to inhibition of adenosine-induced vasodilation, and is independent of sympathetic influences. These data suggest that endogenous interstitial adenosine preserves renal blood flow in one-kidney, one clip hypertension mainly by inhibiting renin release.",

We describe the use of the B-value, which is a transformed Z-value, for the calculation of conditional power. In data monitoring, interim Z-values do not allow simple projections to the end of the study. Moreover, because of their popular association with P-values, Z-values are often misinterpreted. If observed trends are viewed as the realization of a Brownian motion process, the B-value and its decomposition allow simple extrapolations to the end of the study under a variety of hypotheses. Applications are presented to one- and two-sample Z-tests, the two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the log-rank test.", 
    "66": "In atherosclerotic rabbits (SCLER), decreases in vascular resistance in response to acetylcholine (ACH), an endothelium-dependent agent, are suppressed, whereas those to nitroprusside (NP), an endothelium-independent vasodilator, are preserved. To determine whether defective vasodilation in SCLER is related to altered reactivity of resistance vessels, we visualized arterioles of rabbit cremaster muscle by videomicroscopy. Arteriolar diameter was monitored during topical (superfusional) delivery of ACh and NO, interventions that did not affect systemic hemodynamics. Diameter changes in response to NP (0.01-100.0 microM) did not differ between SCLER and controls; maximal dilations amounted to 110 +/- 10% (mean +/- SE). In contrast, responses to ACH (0.001-100 microM) differed; maximal dilations averaged 54 +/- 4% in SCLER and 124 +/- 9% in controls (P less than 0.001). These differences persisted after blockade with phentolamine, propranolol, and indomethacin. Phenidone and hydroquinone blockers of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, inhibited arteriolar dilation to ACH without affecting that to NP. Microvascular responses to intra-arterial drug were similar to those elicited by topical drug. Thus, hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in the rabbit appear to produce a microvascular defect characterized by an impaired endothelium-dependent dilation and a preserved endothelium-independent dilation. This defect could play a role in limiting vasodilator reserve in atherosclerosis.", 
    "67": "Propranolol has been reported to prevent aortic aneurysms in the beta-aminoproprionitrile-fed broad-breasted white turkey model. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of propranolol in another animal model of aortic aneurysms, the spontaneously aneurysm-prone Blotchy (BLO) mouse. One hundred fourteen male BLO mice were fed control chow or a diet supplemented with 0.10% (w/w) propranolol. Groups were sacrificed at monthly intervals and the presence of aneurysms was determined after latex injection into the left ventricle. Aortic diameter was also measured at the widest point in a subset of mice from each group sacrificed at 4-5 months of age. At 4 months 86% of control and 32% of propranolol-fed animals had aneurysms (P less than 0.001). The difference in mean aortic diameter was also decreased by 33% in the propranolol-fed group (P less than 0.01). This study suggests that propranolol delays the formation of aneurysms in this spontaneous, genetically determined animal model.", 
    "68": "Two patients experienced new onset or worsening of panic disorder during treatment with propranolol for tachycardia or palpitations associated with a diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse. Both patients had a family history of panic disorder; one also had a family history of mitral valve prolapse and depression. As antidepressant drugs can treat both depression and panic disorder, it would not be inconsistent that propranolol might exacerbate either disorder. Other possible interpretations of these two cases are discussed.", 
    "69": "The effects of nadolol (20 and 80 mg) on blood pressure and sleep parameters were assessed in six patients with mild hypertension. A 32-night experimental protocol in the sleep laboratory was instituted consisting of four placebo-baseline nights followed by 4 weeks of drug administration. Both doses of nadolol had a clear-cut and consistent lowering effect on blood pressure throughout the night and during the day, with a greater reduction noted with the 80 mg dose. In fact, blood pressure values were reduced to normotensive levels. Neither dose had a disrupting effect on sleep, whereas the 80 mg dose improved sleep efficiency and also had a rapid eye movement-enhancing effect. This absence of sleep-disrupting effects is attributed to nadolol's low level of lipophilicity and lack of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The clinical significance of the lack of sleep disruption and possible improvement of sleep with nadolol is discussed in light of the well-recognized sleep disturbances produced by other beta-blockers.", 
    "70": "Chronic treatment of rats with clenbuterol, a beta 2-receptor agonist (8-12 wk), caused hypertrophy of histochemically identified fast- but not slow-twitch fibers within the soleus, while the mean areas of both fiber types were increased in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL). In contrast, treatment with the beta 2-receptor antagonist, butoxamine, reduced fast-twitch fiber size in both muscles. In the solei and to a lesser extent in the EDLs, the ratio of the number of fast- to slow-twitch fibers was increased by clenbuterol, while the opposite was observed with butoxamine. The muscle fiber hypertrophy observed in the EDL was accompanied by parallel increases in maximal tetanic tension and muscle cross-sectional area, while in the solei, progressive increases in rates of force development and relaxation toward values typical of fast-twitch muscles were also observed. Our results suggest a role of beta 2-receptors in regulating muscle fiber type composition as well as growth.", 
    "71": "Beta blockade may adversely affect inotropic state of the ventricle, resulting in exacerbation of congestive heart failure in subjects with reduced ventricular function. In normal subjects, ventricular contractility appears to be preserved following administration of beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). The inotropic state of the ventricle was assessed in seven subjects with congestive heart failure (mean ejection fraction = 23 +/- 5%) before and after administration of the ISA beta blocker, pindolol, with the use of the noninvasively derived end-systolic pressure/end-systolic dimension (ESP/ESD) relation. The mean slope of the ESP/ESD relation was 36.3 +/- 20.4 mm Hg/cm at baseline and increased to 45.0 +/- 25.2 mm Hg/cm following five consecutive 10 mg oral doses of pindolol (p = ns). Other simultaneously derived inotropic indices that included percent fractional shortening, mean delta P/delta T, velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, and preejection period-to-left ventricular ejection time ratio showed directionally similar changes toward a mild increase in contractility. These results indicate that the slope of the left ventricular ESP/ESD relation is not altered following repeated dosing with pindolol in subjects with congestive heart failure. This reflects a preservation of inotropic state following administration of this ISA beta blocker in a population with severely compromised ventricular function.", 
    "72": "A 74-year-old woman with essential hypertension underwent a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for the treatment of psychotic depression. Her treatments were associated with delayed and significant hypertension. Clonidine, which controlled her baseline blood pressure, was inadequate in treating her post-ECT hypertension. Acute treatment with hydralazine also failed. Labetalol, a short-acting beta-blocking agent with some alpha-1 blocking activity, worked well both acutely (intravenously) and orally to manage essential and ECT-induced hypertension.", 
    "73": "Postpacing impulse recovery times of the junctional tissue (junctional automaticity) were determined by atrial or ventricular overdrive pacing in 27 patients with dysfunction of the sinus node. The maximum junctional recovery time (MJRT) could be measured in 22 patients and ranged from 1,630 to 9,730 ms (mean 3,860 +/- 2,077); the maximum corrected junctional recovery time (MJRTc) could be measured in 18 patients and ranged from 140 to 5,986 ms (mean 2,089 +/- 1,529). Autonomic influence on the JRTs was evaluated by intravenous administration of atropine (1.5 mg) alone or in combination with propranolol (5 to 6 mg). Of the seven patients in whom MJRTc and/or MJRT could be measured before and after drug intervention, the JRTs shortened in four and prolonged in three after combination of atropine and propranolol. Atropine alone shortened MJRT in all eight patients studied. Our data reveal that both vagal and catecholamine-dependent factors (especially vagal over-activity) are operative in the escape mechanism of the junctional tissue.", 
    "74": "Acute pharmacologically mediated parallel shifts in the left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relation may be due to the restraining effect of the pericardium and/or leftward displacement of the interventricular septum. The existence and cause of this phenomenon in the right ventricle has not been studied in animals or in man. Accordingly, we altered right ventricular pressure with intravenous phenylephrine (0.2 to 0.3 mg) and nitroprusside (0.5 to 1.5 micrograms/kg/min) to achieve three disparate peak right ventricular pressures in nine normal subjects after partial autonomic blockade with atropine (1 mg) and propranolol (0.15 mg/kg). Simultaneous high-fidelity right ventricular pressures and biplane cineventriculographic volumes were acquired during the three resultant loading conditions. Right atrial pacing maintained heart rate constant at each pressure level. Peak right ventricular systolic pressure (23 +/- 3 vs 31 +/- 9 vs 45 +/- 6 mm Hg, all p less than .01) and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (4 +/- 2 vs 8 +/- 4 vs 11 +/- 3 mm Hg, all p less than .01) were significantly different at low, medium, and high loading conditions, respectively. Right ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relations were, in parallel, shifted upward with altered loading in each patient. This was manifest by an unchanged dynamic chamber stiffness constant and a significant increase in the diastolic pressure volume y intercept at each load (1.98 +/- 2.21 vs 5.33 +/- 5.39 vs 8.51 +/- 3.99 mm Hg, p less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

At all follow-up visits the patients in both groups had significantly decreased intraocular pressure (p less than 0.05); there was no significant difference between the groups. Levobunolol produced significant decreases in mean heart rate (p less than 0.05). One patient with an undisclosed history of childhood asthma experienced bronchospasm related to an acute upper respiratory tract infection while receiving levobunolol.

The percentage reduction in intraocular pressure after four hours following single-drop instillation range from 20% to 25% in the D-timolol group, 32% in the L-timolol group, and only 8% in the placebo group of treated eyes.", 
    "77": "In previous studies we reported that immunization of mice with ungulate insulins induced the development of antiinsulin antibodies, which include an idiotype that appeared to recognize the part of the insulin molecule recognized by the hormone receptor. The antiinsulin antibodies of this idiotype were replaced spontaneously by antiidiotypic antibodies. The antiidiotypic antibodies, which persisted for about 14 d, mimicked insulin and functioned as antibodies to the insulin receptor. They induced down regulation, desensitization and refractoriness of the insulin receptor and disturbances in glucose homeostasis in vivo (Shechter, Y., D. Elias, R. Maron, and I.R. Cohen., 1984; Elias, D., R. Maron, I.R. Cohen, and Y. Shechter. 1984, J. Biol. Chem. 259: 6411-6419). We now report that effects of the antiidiotypic antibodies on the insulin receptor effector system can be modified pharmacologically. Administration of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol during the period of insulin resistance (days 26-40 after primary immunization), largely restored fat cell responsiveness to insulin, and eliminated the appearance of fasting hyperglycemia. This restoration appeared to be caused by inhibition of both insulin receptor desensitization and refractoriness. In contrast, down regulation of insulin receptors was not reversed by isoproterenol treatment in vivo. The effects of treatment with isoproterenol persisted for 2-4 d after termination of treatment. The beta-antagonist, propranolol and more so, the beta 1a-antagonist metoprolol, specifically blocked the effect of isoproterenol at a molar ratio of 3-10:1. Oral administration of the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, aminophylline, was also effective in inhibiting the development of desensitization in fat cells. These results indicate that treatment with beta 1-adrenergic agonists in vivo, or other agents that elevate cellular cAMP levels, can inhibit the development of the \"postbinding\" defects induced by insulin-mimicking, antireceptor antibodies. These observations have both basic and clinical implications.", 
    "78": "To examine whether glucose metabolic clearance increases and whether catecholamines influence glucose turnover during exercise in total insulin deficiency, 24-h fasted and insulin-deprived pancreatectomized dogs were studied before and during exercise (60 min; 100 m/min; 10% slope) with (n = 8) and without (n = 8) propranolol infusion (PI, 5 micrograms/kg-min). Exercise with or without PI was accompanied by four and fivefold increments in norepinephrine and epinephrine respectively, while glucagon (extrapancreatic) fell slightly. Basal plasma glucose and FFA concentrations and rates of tracer-determined (3[3H]glucose) hepatic glucose production (Ra) and total glucose clearance (including urinary glucose loss) were 459 +/- 24 mg/dl, 1.7 +/- 0.5 mmol/liter, 7.8 +/- 0.9 mg/kg-min and 1.6 +/- 0.1 ml/kg-min, respectively. When corrected for urinary glucose excretion, basal glucose metabolic clearance rate (MCR) was 0.7 +/- 0.1 mg/kg-min and rose twofold (P less than 0.0001) during exercise. Despite lower lactate (3.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 6.6 +/- 1.3 mmol/liter; P less than 0.005) and FFA levels (1.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter; P less than 0.0001) with PI, PI failed to influence MCR during exercise. Ra rose by 3.7 +/- 1.7 mg/kg-min during exercise (P less than 0.02) while with PI the increase was only 1.9 +/- 0.7 mg/kg-min (P less than 0.002). Glucose levels remained unchanged during exercise alone but fell slightly with PI (P less than 0.0001). Therefore, in total insulin deficiency, MCR increases marginally with exercise (13% of normal); the beta adrenergic effects of catecholamines that stimulate both FFA mobilization and muscle glycogenolysis do not regulate muscle glucose uptake. The exercise-induced rise in hepatic glucose production does not require an increase in glucagon levels, but is mediated partially by catecholamines. Present and previous data in normal and alloxan-diabetic dogs, suggest that (a) in total insulin deficiency, control of hepatic glucose production during exercise is shifted from glucagon to catecholamines and that this may involve catecholamine-induced mobilization of peripheral substrates for gluconeogenesis and/or hepatic insensitivity to glucagon, and (b) insulin is not essential for a small exercise-induced increase in muscle glucose uptake, but normal insulin levels are required for the full response. Furthermore, the catecholamines appear to regulate muscle glucose uptake during exercise only when sufficient insulin is available to prevent markedly elevated FFA levels. We speculate that the main role of insulin is not to regulate glucose uptake by the contracting muscle directly, but to restrain lipolysis and thereby also FFA oxidation in the muscle.", 
    "79": "The availability of calcium antagonists has provided yet another therapeutic option in the management of hypertension. Calcium antagonists lower the blood pressure in hypertensive individuals while preserving the blood flow at the microcirculatory level. While all the available calcium antagonists are effective in the treatment of hypertension, they differ in their hemodynamic and pharmacologic actions. Nifedipine appears to be suitable for immediate treatment of severe hypertension and for chronic treatment of uncomplicated or refractory hypertension. In some but not all patients, co-administration of a beta-blocker is necessary to blunt reflex tachycardia. This problem is less likely with the tablet/long-acting formulation of nifedipine. Verapamil and diltiazem are useful as initial therapy for chronic mild-to-moderate hypertension. They are as effective as other first-line drugs in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension. The heart rate with verapamil or diltiazem does not change or is slightly reduced, thus contrasting with nifedipine. Experience to date suggests that calcium antagonists do not cause adverse biochemical effects and in this respect are superior to diuretics and certain beta-blockers. Currently, verapamil is available as a sustained release preparation. In the near future, nifedipine or diltiazem may also be available in the long acting formulation to permit simplicity and to enhance patient compliance in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "80": "A dose titration study was performed using felodipine, a new calcium antagonist, in Chinese patients with essential hypertension inadequately controlled by metoprolol alone (DBP greater than 95 mmHg). BP and pulse rate were recorded at rest and during treadmill exercise. Nineteen patients completed the six weeks' dose titration phase (2.5-5-10 mg twice daily) of whom 17 were followed for one year. A single 2.5 mg dose of felodipine produced a rapid and pronounced antihypertensive response with pre-exercise supine BP falling from a mean 168/104 to 146/92 mmHg) (P less than 0.001). The SBP during exercise was reduced from 206 to 185 mmHg (P less than 0.001). After 6 weeks treatment the supine BP had fallen to 132/85 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and the SBP during exercise to 169 mmHg (P less than 0.001). Six patients received 2.5 mg twice daily, eight patients 5 mg twice daily and three patients 10 mg twice daily. The effects, both at rest and during exercise, were maintained for at least 12 hours after dosing. The pulse rate was unaffected by felodipine therapy apart from a small transient increase following the first dose. Sixteen patients achieved the target DBP of 90 mmHg measured 12 hours after dosing and only one patient still had a DBP greater than 95 mmHg. After one year the mean supine BP had fallen slightly further to 128/82 mmHg. One patient was withdrawn due to palpitations. Felodipine was otherwise well tolerated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "A case of QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmia in a 57-year-old patient treated with small therapeutic doses of sotalol is reported. There was no concomitant treatment prolonging the QT interval. Hypokalemia could be excluded. Before treatment an electrophysiological study was performed, and ventricular tachycardia could not be initiated. Coronary artery disease was excluded. QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by small therapeutic doses of sotalol in normokalemia may occur on rare occasions. It may be problematic to differentiate between torsade de pointes and polymorphous ventricular tachycardia when describing such a ventricular tachyarrhythmia.", 
    "82": "A simple, sensitive and selective high performance liquid chromatographic method for the analysis of propranolol and its major metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol is developed. The drugs and the internal standard, quinidine, were extracted from serum with ether at pH 10. The latter was evaporated and the residue was dissolved into phosphoric acid solution. Propranolol, 4-hydroxypropranolol and quinidine were eluted from 5 microns, C-18 reversed phase column with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-methanol-phosphoric acid at pH 4 and detected with fluorescence detector. Quantification was achieved by measuring the peak height ratio of each drug to the internal standard. Interference due to either biological constituents of serum or other propranolol metabolites such as n-desisopropyl propranolol and propranolol glycol was absent. The mean percentage recoveries for serum samples spiked with propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol were 94.7 and 98.4%, respectively. Detection limits were 10 ng/ml for propranolol and 5 ng/ml for 4-hydroxypropranolol. Within-day coefficients of variation ranged from 3.2-6.9% for propranolol and 0.8-6.2% for 4-hydroxypropranolol."
