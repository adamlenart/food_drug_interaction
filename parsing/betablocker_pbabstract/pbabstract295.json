    "0": "Because the enzymic regulation of muscle triglyceride breakdown is poorly understood we studied whether neutral lipase in skeletal muscle is activated by contractions. Incubated soleus muscles from 70 g rats were electrically stimulated for 60 min. Neutral lipase activity against triacylglycerol increased after 1 and 5 min of contractions [0.36 +/- 0.02 (basal) versus 0.49 +/- 0.05 (1 min) and 0.54 +/- 0.05 (5 min) m-unit.mg of protein(-1), means +/- S.E.M., P < 0.05]. After 10 min the neutral lipase activity (0.40 +/- 0.05 m-unit.mg of protein(-1)) had decreased to basal values (P > 0.05). The contraction-mediated increase in lipase activity was increased by approximately 110% when muscle was stimulated in the presence of okadaic acid. Conversely, treatment of muscle homogenate with alkaline phosphatase completely reversed the contraction-mediated lipase activation. Lipase activity did not change during contractions when analysed in the presence of anti-hormone-sensitive-lipase (HSL) antibody [0.17 +/- 0.02 (basal) versus 0.21 +/- 0.02 (5 min) m-unit.mg of protein(-1), P > 0.05]. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified anti-HSL antibody reduced muscle-HSL protein concentration by 81+/-4% and caused similar reductions in lipase activity against triacylglycerol and in the contraction-induced increase in this activity. Neither prior sympathectomy [0.33+/- 0.02 (basal) versus 0.53 +/- 0.06 (5 min) m-unit.mg of protein(-1), P < 0.05] nor propranolol impaired the lipase response to contractions. Glycogen phosphorylase activity in the absence of AMP increased after 1 min [27.3 +/- 3.1 versus 8.9 +/- 1.8% (activity without AMP/total activity with AMP), P < 0.05] and returned to basal levels after 5 min. In conclusion, skeletal-muscle-immunoreactive HSL is transiently stimulated by contractions and the mechanism probably involves phosphorylation. The time course of HSL activation is similar to that of glycogen phosphorylase. Apparently, the two enzymes are regulated in parallel by contraction-induced as well as hormonal mechanisms, allowing simultaneous recruitment of all major extra- and intra-muscular energy stores.", 
    "1": "Pindolol accelerates the clinical actions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in man, and modulates extracellular levels of monoamines in corticolimbic structures in rats. Herein, we examined its influence upon electrical activity of serotonergic, dopaminergic and adrenergic perikarya in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus (LC) of anaesthetized rats. In analogy to the serotonin1A (5-HT1A) agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (-100%), pindolol dose-dependently (0.063- 1.0 mg/kg) decreased (-70%) the firing rate of serotonergic neurons. The inhibitory action of pindolol was abolished by the selective 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY-100,635 (0.031 mg/kg). In contrast, 8-OH-DPAT (+26%) and pindolol (0.25-4.0 mg/kg, +60%) dose-dependently increased the firing rate of dopaminergic cells. Of 57 neurons recorded (pindolol, 2.0 mg/kg), 36 (63%) were excited, 11 (19%) were unaffected and 10 (18%) were inhibited. This variable influence could be attributed to regularly firing neurons in the parabrachial subdivision, inasmuch as all neurons in the paranigral subnucleus were excited. The facilitation of firing by pindolol was accompanied by an increase in burst firing throughout the VTA. Both the increases in burst firing and in firing rate were reversed by WAY-100,635 (0.031 mg/kg). Finally, the electrical activity of adrenergic neurons was dose-dependently enhanced by 8-OH-DPAT and pindolol (+99% and +83%, respectively). WAY-100,635 reversed this excitation and, itself, inhibited the activity of adrenergic neurons. In conclusion, via engagement of 5-HT1A receptors, pindolol inhibits serotonergic, and activates dopaminergic and adrenergic, neurons in anaesthetized rats. Such actions may contribute to its influence upon mood, both alone and in association with antidepressant agents.", 
    "2": "It is unclear if reduced hepatic drug elimination in congestive heart failure is primarily due to impairment of enzyme function as a result of tissue hypoxia, to the direct effects of hepatic congestion, or to changes intrinsic to the liver, such as reductions in enzyme content and activity. We therefore compared propranolol clearance in perfused rat livers from animals with right ventricular failure (RVF) with that from control animals. Despite the fact that both groups were perfused at comparable flow rates, perfusion pressures, and levels of oxygen delivery, hepatic extraction of propranolol was significantly reduced in RVF livers (0.688 +/- 0.122 versus 0.991 +/- 0.006 ml/min/g of liver in controls, P <.001). This effect was reflected in a 97% reduction in propranolol intrinsic clearance in RVF livers (5 +/- 4 versus 172 +/- 82 ml/min/g of liver in controls, P <.01). In RVF livers, total hepatic CYP expression was reduced by 19% compared with controls, whereas cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A1/2 and 2D1 were reduced by 41 and 26%, respectively. Despite the 97% reduction in propranolol intrinsic clearance in perfused RVF liver, intrinsic clearance in microsomal preparations from the same livers was reduced by only 48% compared with controls (P <.05). These findings suggest that impaired propranolol clearance in RVF is not primarily accounted for by reduced hepatic oxygen delivery or by changes in hepatic content and activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes.", 
    "3": "The success of beta-blocking agents in clinical trials of heart failure (HF) has led to a widespread call for their increased use, which assumes these agents will perform as well in the usual care setting. Given the traditional contraindication of the use of beta-blocking agents in HF, and their perception as difficult to use in HF, observing how they perform in the usual care setting could be critical in accelerating their widespread application. Carvedilol is the only beta-blocking agent currently approved in the United States for use in HF.",

The decision to use carvedilol is entirely at the discretion of the participant physician, based on evidence of HF as judged by assessments the practitioner usually uses. All patients will be followed for 1 year, with information on outcomes and other clinical variables collected and analyzed at baseline, the end of titration, and at 6 and 12 months after reaching the maximum tolerated dose. About 600 participant physicians selected to be as representative as possible of the community practice setting will enroll approximately 6,000 patients.",

    "6": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of balloon injury and subsequent neointima formation in the rat carotid artery on the beta-adrenoceptor function. Rat left common carotid artery was subjected to balloon injury with an arterial embolectomy catheter; the contralateral artery was sham-operated. Immediately, and at 2, 8 and 16 weeks post-injury, both the injured and the sham-operated carotid arteries were isolated and mounted in an isometric wire-myograph set-up. Subsequently, concentration-response curves (CRCs) were constructed for the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline after precontraction with the thromboxane A2 (TP)-receptor agonist U46619 (30 nM) of the injured and sham-operated artery preparations. To evaluate the involvement of the beta1- and the beta2-adrenoceptor subtypes, CRCs were constructed in the presence of CGP 20712A (0.1 nM, a beta1-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist) and ICI 118,551 (10 nM, a beta2-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist). L-NAME (100 microM) and indomethacine (10 microM) were used to evaluate the influence of nitric oxide (NO) or prostanoids, respectively. Immediately post-injury, isoprenaline-induced vasorelaxation was impaired in the injured carotid artery preparations: Emax=19.6 +/- 2.2% vs. 64.0 +/- 4.6%, injured vs. sham, n=8, P<0.05. However, from 2 weeks post-injury onwards, this response appeared enhanced in the injured preparations: Emax, 2 weeks= 86.4 +/- 2.2% vs. 49.7 +/- 5.7%, injured vs. sham, n=5, P<0.05. In addition, the sensitivity for isoprenaline was increased in these preparations: pD2, 2 weeks=7.48 +/- 0.08 vs. 6.88 +/- 0.10, injured vs. sham, n=5, P<0.05. The beta-adrenoceptor population in both types of preparations consisted mainly of the beta2-adrenoceptor subtype, although at 8 and 16 weeks post-injury, the beta1-adrenoceptor subtype appeared to be present as well in the injured artery preparations. Inhibition of NO synthesis led to significant decreases of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation both in injured and in sham-operated artery preparations for all time points, except at 16 weeks. Cyclo-oxygenase inhibition had no influence on isoprenaline-induced vasorelaxation in injured and sham-operated preparations. From this, it is concluded that beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation in rat carotid artery is partially NO-dependent and occurs mainly via activation of the beta2-adrenoceptor subtype. Balloon injury and subsequent neointima formation in the rat carotid artery lead initially to an impairment, but subsequently to an enhancement of the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation. The impairment is attributable to the removal of endothelium, whereas the enhanced beta-adrenoceptor-mediated function may be related to the occurrence of an NO system in the neointimal smooth muscle cells.", 
    "7": "We tested the hypothesis that altered phosphorylation of Ca2+ regulatory proteins contributes to contractile anomalies in cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in rats by chronic s.c. administration of isoproterenol (Iso, 2.4 mg/kg/day) via osmotic minipumps. On day 2 of Iso treatment the expression of atrial natriuretic factor was increased, time of relaxation in isolated papillary muscles shortened and protein expression of phospholamban (PLB) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase reduced. In addition, the phosphorylation state of PLB at serine-16 and threonine-17 was decreased from (arbitrary units) 2.3+/-0.3 to 1.1+/-0.2 and from 4.1+/-0.6 to 2.1+/-0.2, respectively. This was not accompanied by altered activity of PLB-phosphorylating protein kinases (protein kinase A or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II), whereas the activity of types 1 and 2A protein phosphatases (PP1 and -2A respectively) was enhanced from 1.1+/-0.08 to 1.71+/-0.13 nmol/mg/min. Iso treatment did not alter the PP1/PP2A activity ratio and 1 nmol/l okadaic acid, a concentration which completely blocks the catalytic subunit of PP2A, inhibited about 40% of total PP activity in all groups studied. These data indicate that the activity of both PP1 and PP2A were increased. All effects of Iso treatment were abolished by co-administration of propranolol (29.7 mg/kg/day). It is concluded that dephosphorylation of PLB is due to enhanced activity of PP1 and PP2A. We suggest that chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation, which occurs in human cardiac hypertrophy and failure, can lead to increased activity of PPs. This may contribute to altered contractile responses in the hypertrophied heart.", 
    "8": "The ability of either 0.5% betaxolol (1 drop topically, bid; n=31) or a combination of 0.25% demecarium bromide and a topical corticosteroid (gentamicin/betamethasone) (DB/GB; 1 drop of each topically, sid; n=55) to prevent glaucoma in the fellow eye of dogs with unilateral, primary closed angle glaucoma (PCAG) was investigated in a multicenter, open-label, clinical trial. Untreated control dogs (n=20) developed glaucoma significantly sooner (median, eight mos; p less than 0.001) than dogs treated either with DB/GB (median, 31 mos) or betaxolol (median, 30.7 mos). Although DB/GB and betaxolol equally delayed or prevented the onset of glaucoma in the second eye, a less frequent dosing schedule for DB/GB suggests demecarium bromide in combination with a topical corticosteroid may be preferable to betaxolol in preventing PCAG in dogs.",

    "13": "Osteoblasts derived from the periosteal surfaces of two-three-week-old male broiler chicken tibias were cultured for eight days. The cells were then loaded with fura-2/AM ester to detect surges in intracellular Ca(2+). Treatment with 10(-7) M testosterone (T) or 17beta-estradiol (E) elicited a rapid (within seconds) response that was substantially reduced by introducing the calcium chelating agent EGTA or the calcium-channel blocker verapamil. The hormones were equally effective when covalently linked to bovine serum albumin (BSA), a procedure that ensures the hormone does not enter the cells. The rapid response to surface-bound steroids indicates that the responses were invoked through plasma-membrane receptors. The source of Ca(2+) was shown to be through entry from external sources, as well as from intracellular stores. Flow cytometry of fluorescein-tagged T-BSA and E-BSA revealed that osteoblasts derived from male chickens had similar and substantial levels of both receptors.", 
    "14": "We explored the effects of contractile arrest maintained for 24-72 h in the presence of 2,3-butanedione monoxime or a Ca(2+) channel blocker (nifedipine or verapamil) on contractile activity, Ca(i)(2+) transients, and myofibrillar protein content and ultrastructure in long-term cultures of spontaneously beating adult guinea-pig cardiomyocytes. The contractions were not affected by 5 mM 2, 3-butanedione monoxime, but they were strongly or fully suppressed by 10 and 18 mM 2,3-butanedione monoxime, respectively, while the Ca(i)(2+)transients triggered by the maintained spontaneous electrical activity were either not changed at all (5 and 10 mM 2, 3-butanedione monoxime) or decreased only slightly (18 mM 2, 3-butanedione monoxime). The uncoupling of excitation from contraction by 10-18 mM for 24-72 h did not affect the content of the myofibrillar proteins. Confocal laser microscopy showed that these exposures affected the assembly of myofilaments, giving an overall deranged appearance to the myofibrils. In spite of this effect, the cells' contractile activity was readily regained within 15-60 min upon the washout of 2,3-butanedione monoxime. The 24-72-h exposures to 5 microM nifedipine or 10 microM verapamil, which blocked fully both the Ca(i)(2+) transients and contractility, did not affect the myofibrillar protein content nor their assembly. However, the recovery of contractile activity after exposure to a Ca(2+)-channel blocker was significantly slower (several days) than after 2,3-butanedione monoxime exposure. Furthermore, cultures exposed to Ca(2+)-channel blockers also had significantly decreased sensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Altogether, these data indicate the importance of regular Ca(2+) influx for the maintenance of the functional integrity of adult cardiomyocytes during prolonged periods of contractile arrest.", 
    "15": "In the behaving rat, the consumption of an unfamiliar taste activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1-2 (ERK1-2) in the insular cortex, which contains the taste cortex. In contrast, consumption of a familiar taste has no effect. Furthermore, activation of ERK1-2, culminating in modulation of gene expression, is obligatory for the encoding of long-term, but not short-term, memory of the new taste (Berman et al., 1998). Which neurotransmitter and neuromodulatory systems are involved in the activation of ERK1-2 by the unfamiliar taste and in the long-term encoding of the new taste information? Here we show, by the use of local microinjections of pharmacological agents to the insular cortex in the behaving rat, that multiple neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are required for encoding of taste memory in cortex. However, these systems vary in the specificity of their role in memory acquisition and in their contribution to the activation of ERK1-2. NMDA receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors, muscarinic, and beta-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors, all contribute to the acquisition of the new taste memory but not to its retrieval. Among these, only NMDA and muscarinic receptors specifically mediate taste-dependent activation of ERK1-2, whereas the beta-adrenergic function is independent of ERK1-2, and dopaminergic receptors regulate also the basal level of ERK1-2 activation. The data are discussed in the context of postulated novelty detection circuits in the central taste system.", 
    "16": "We investigated the roles of beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptors (beta-AR) in adrenergic enhancement of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) in canine ventricular myocytes. Isoproterenol and l-norepinephrine produced a monophasic and a biphasic concentration-I(CaL) relationship (CR), respectively. alpha(1)-AR inhibition with prazosin and beta(2)-AR stimulation with zinterol or l-epinephrine shifted the CR of l-norepinephrine leftward. Zinterol (50 nM) and l-epinephrine (10 nM), but not prazosin, altered the biphasic CR of l-norepinephrine to a monophasic CR. Zinterol and l-epinephrine applied after l-norepinephrine had no effect on I(CaL). beta(2)-AR inhibition with ICI-118551 reduced the E(max) of isoproterenol and l-norepinephrine by 60% and abolished the augmentation of l-norepinephrine by zinterol and l-epinephrine. Carbachol (100 nM) modestly reduced the I(CaL) response to beta(1)-AR stimulation but abolished the enhancement via beta(2)-AR. Zinterol augmented the enhancement of I(CaL) by forskolin, IBMX, and theophylline, but not in the presence of CGP-20712A. We conclude that selective beta(2)-AR stimulation does not increase I(CaL) but enhances adenylyl cyclase activity when stimulated via beta(1)-AR and with forskolin. beta(2)-AR activity preconditions adenylyl cyclase for beta(1)-AR stimulation.", 
    "17": "The effect of aging on cardiac membrane currents remains unclear. This study examined the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)), the transient outward K(+) current (I(to)), and the L-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca,L)) in ventricular myocytes isolated from young adult (6 mo) and aged (>27 mo) Fischer 344 rats using whole cell patch-clamp techniques. Along with an increase in the cell size and membrane capacitance, aged myocytes had the same magnitude of peak I(K1) with a greater slope conductance but displayed smaller steady-state I(K1). Aged myocytes also had a greater I(to) with an increased rate of activation, but the I(to) inactivation kinetics, steady-state inactivation, and responsiveness to L-phenylephrine, an alpha(1)-adrenergic agonist, were unaltered. The magnitude of peak I(Ca,L) in aged myocytes was decreased and accompanied by a slower inactivation, but the I(Ca,L) steady-state inactivation was unaltered. Action potential duration in aged myocytes was prolonged only at 90% of full repolarization (APD(90)) when compared with the action potential duration of young adult myocytes. Aged myocytes from Long-Evans rats showed similar changes in I(to) and I(Ca,L) but an increased I(K1). These results demonstrate aging-associated changes in action potential, in morphology, and in I(K1), I(to), and I(Ca,L) of rat ventricular myocytes that possibly contribute to the decreased cardiac function of aged hearts.",

To explore the effects of these antagonists, we studied Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-ir) structures, which correlate with cellular activity, in the accessory olfactory bulb of female rats after the vomeronasal organ was exposed to urine. After the administration of 3 mg/kg ketanserin, the expression of Fos-ir cells in the periglomerular cell layer in response to male Wistar urine was inhibited, while that in the mitral/tufted cell and granule cell layers was not changed. The administration of 20 mg/kg propranolol inhibited the expression of Fos-ir cells in all three layers. These results suggest that serotonin and noradrenaline are likely involved in the modulation of the expression of Fos-ir cells in response to the urine in the accessory olfactory bulb.", 
    "27": "The BRING-UP 2 (ANMCO) is an observational study which evaluates the applicability, safety and efficacy profiles of beta-blockers in elderly patients and in those with severe heart failure. In this last category the recommendations for beta-blockers should be expanded, but in routine conditions of care the administration of these drugs still needs careful guide and observation.", 
    "28": "BRING-UP, as already known, is an observational study of outcome of the use of beta-blocker therapy for heart failure. This has been an extraordinary event in clinical medicine: a class of drugs, the beta-blockers, which clinical evidence transformed from being considered as contraindicated into being recommended. This exceptional situation, together with the growing awareness of the limited spread and applicability of evidence produced by trials into clinical practice led to undertaking observational studies to evaluate the feasibility, safety and practical results of the implementation of new therapies recommended for widespread use on the basis of results of controlled, randomized clinical trials. BRING-UP 1 will be followed by BRING-UP 2, the aim of this latter being to assess the effects of beta-blocker therapy on populations underrepresented in randomized trials, and SET-UP, on the use of GP IIb/IIIa platelet receptor inhibitors in unstable angina. BRING-UP has started a new line of research which does not substitute randomized trials, but complements and completes them. For this type of study to become common practice in clinical research, there must be greater interaction and acceptance by pharmaceutical companies and national and international regulatory bodies and a widespread conviction among doctors that this research has a paramount scientific, clinical and social value.", 
    "29": "Traditional contraindications to beta-blockers are peripheral vascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Recent data seem to show that rigorous application of these rules are not completely justified and indicate that many patients would be inappropriately excluded from the beneficial effects of this therapy. Appraisal of clear guidelines for a safe use of beta-blockers is thus mandatory for the clinician. A brief review of the effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is offered. The therapy is aimed at blocking beta 1-receptors. On the other hand, the block of beta 2-receptors causes the well known side effects, i.e. vasoconstriction, delayed response to hypoglycemia in diabetic patients, bronchoconstriction. From the first compound, propranolol, with uniform action on beta 1 and beta 2-receptors, further generation of beta-blockers were subsequently developed: beta 1-selective, with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and with associated vasodilating \"ancillary\" property. Some favorable reduction in collateral effects has thus been obtained with new compounds, without reaching complete safety. Examination of exclusion criteria applied in clinical trials offers no useful indications because of their imprecise definition. Examination of the literature and a more accurate understanding of the diseases, traditionally considered contraindications, may help setting up a uniform and clear path: peripheral vascular disease: beta-blockers should be avoided only in those patients with vasospastic disorders, rest pain with severe peripheral vascular disease or nonhealing lesions. In patients with mild to moderate disease, beta-blockers can be prescribed, but careful surveillance for any changes in symptoms related to intermittent claudicatio should be achieved; diabetes mellitus: previous apprehension for the lessening reaction to hypoglycemia in patients treated with insulin has been retracted. Beta-blockers are not contraindicated in these patients. Some caution should be addressed when signs of autonomic disease are present or in patients with difficult glycemic control. Patients on oral long-acting antidiabetic drugs should not be neglected. The risk of prolonged and paucisymptomatic hypoglycemia while taking beta-blocker agents is somewhat more relevant than in patients treated regularly with insulin; COPD and asthma: confusion may arise if rigorous definition of these diseases and their severity is not applied following the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society. Because bronchial hyperreactivity seems the crucial factor in determining collateral effects to beta-blocker agents, agreement can be reached on the following statements. Beta-blockers are contraindicated a) when history of asthma is present, b) when COPD is moderate to severe, i.e. with FEV1 reduction < 50% of the predicted value, c) in patients on chronic bronchodilator treatment, d) in chronic airflow limitation with evidence of > or = 20% reversibility in airway obstruction in response to inhaled salbutamol. When FEV1 is > 50% of the predicted value, beta-blockers can be given, providing adequate control of stability of ventilatory conditions.", 
    "30": "Despite the importance of beta-blockers for secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction, several studies suggested that they are substantially underutilized, particularly in elderly patients. Actually no randomized clinical trial including elderly patients with heart failure treated with beta-blockers is reported in the literature. However, previous studies showed that beta-blocker therapy was associated with a reduction in total cardiac mortality (-40%) of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction without left ventricular dysfunction. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of five trials including 1729 patients aged > 60 years with heart failure evidenced a non-significant trend versus total mortality reduction in patients receiving beta-blockers (odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.51-0.93, p = 0.4).", 
    "31": "It is increasingly recognized that the syndrome of congestive heart failure may occur in the absence of any abnormality of left ventricular systolic function. In this situation, the clinical picture of heart failure, particularly the presence of symptoms and/or signs of pulmonary congestion, is usually considered a consequence of an abnormal diastolic function of the left ventricle (diastolic heart failure). However, in the individual patient, several other potential causes should be taken into account before attributing to an isolated diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle the pathogenetic role of clinical presentation. In fact, due to the current lack of validated criteria for diagnosis of diastolic heart failure, it still represents an exclusion diagnosis in the clinical setting. Prevalence of heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function is widely variable among the different studies, from 13% to over 70%, with most reports showing a prevalence of 30-40%. These differences depend on several factors, such as the criteria used for diagnosis of heart failure, as well as those used for recognizing a normal systolic function or the clinical setting considered (for example hospital versus community). According to an analysis of the studies published, heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function seems to be more common in the female sex and in elderly patients, and it is associated with hypertension and electrocardiographic or echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Atrial fibrillation, either paroxysmal or chronic, is common and may represent a precipitating factor of clinical deterioration. According to most studies, patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function show, compared to patients with reduced left ventricular systolic function, a better prognosis, as indicated by a lower mortality and hospital readmission rates. Regarding the therapy of these patients, it is known that there are virtually no well-controlled studies of the effect of pharmacological treatment on outcome. Accordingly, the therapeutic approach of heart failure with preserved systolic function is currently based on a careful pathophysiological interpretation of clinical picture in the individual patient.", 
    "32": "Sympathetic activation plays an important role in the progression of heart failure, and beta-blocker treatment not only improves ventricular function but may also slow and reverse heart remodeling. Patients with severe heart failure remain markedly symptomatic and have a poor prognosis despite optimal pharmacological treatment which includes an ACE-inhibitor. In these patients the tolerability of beta-blockers is reduced, but they could have the most to gain from this therapy, since they are more likely to show symptomatic and survival improvement in the long term. With close clinical observation during the initiation and titration of the drug, and an adequate adjustment of associated therapy, beta-blockers are tolerated in the majority of such patients. This article reviews the clinical experience of beta-blocker use in advanced heart failure, and discusses the appropriate modality of drug initiation and titration. Considerations are also made about the usefulness of prognostic parameters in the evaluation of tolerability and efficacy of beta-blocker treatment.", 
    "33": "Heart failure is one of the commonest debilitating conditions of industrialized society, with mortality and morbidity comparable with that of the common neoplastic diseases. The role of beta-blockers in heart failure has been the subject of debate for many years. The results of recent prospective, placebo-controlled studies of the addition of beta-blockers to standard therapy in patients with chronic heart failure have confirmed a significant beneficial effect on ventricular function, clinical status, morbidity and mortality. The importance of these trials suggests that beta-adrenergic blocker therapy can save one life out of every 35 patients treated with mild-to-moderate heart failure. These major trials have used one of four beta-blockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, or bucindolol) in varying study designs with different patient populations. Beta-blockers improve function of the failing left ventricle, prevent or reverse progressive left ventricular dilation, chamber sphericity, and hypertrophy, and consequently have a positive impact on cardiac remodeling. Beta-blockers also reduce heart rate and left ventricular wall stress, leading to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption, a clear benefit to the failing heart. Moreover, beta-blockers can improve the intrinsic contractile function of cardiomyocytes and have been shown to improve myocardial energetics in heart failure, possibly through desirable changes in substrate utilization. Many important clinical questions still remain unanswered. These questions include whether beta-blockers are of benefit in patients with severe NYHA functional class (IIIB-IV), in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, in the extreme elderly, in patients with diabetes mellitus and renal impairment. Furthermore, it is not clear whether beta-blockade by itself is the real mechanism of clinical benefit. Although certain effects of beta-blockers may be considered class effects, it is not yet clear whether there are differences between beta 1-selective antagonists and nonselective agents. Major studies are currently being undertaken to address the above questions.", 
    "34": "Although inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) have improved the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF), mortality related to this disorder remains unacceptably high. Results from studies started more than 25 years ago in Sweden suggested that long-term therapy with beta-blockers could improve hemodynamics and increase survival in patients with CHF; this hypothesis is confirmed by the results of six double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (MDC, CIBIS, ANZ, US Carvedilol Study, CIBIS II and MERIT-HF) who enrolled about 9000 patients with CHF. In these trials beta-blockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol or carvedilol) where added to the stable usual treatment of each patient (ACE-inhibitors, diuretics, digoxin). Baseline characteristics of patients enrolled into the beta-blocker or placebo arm were similar in all these studies. Specifically the mean patient's age was < 60 years, with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-26%, 30% of enrolled patients were in NYHA functional class II and 60% in NYHA functional class III, CHF was due to ischemic heart disease in about 60% of patients. The average follow-up for all the trials was 14.5 +/- 5.6 months. On the whole in patients on beta-blocker treatment there is a 33.3% reduction in total mortality rate, a 34.2% reduction in cardiac death rate, a 37.7% reduction in sudden death rate, and a 41.7% reduction in worsening heart failure mortality rate. Moreover, in beta-blocker patients there is a 31.7% reduction in all-cause readmissions to hospital and a 26% reduction in the combined end point (total mortality and hospital readmission). Beta-blockers improved ventricular function but there was no significant improvement in functional capacity. In conclusion, the results of the six trials considered indicate that there is convincing evidence supporting a favorable effect of beta-blockade on the risk of death and readmission to hospital in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction, aged < 70 years, in NYHA functional class II-III. The effects of these drugs in CHF patients a) with normal left ventricular ejection fraction, b) aged > 65-70 years, c) in NYHA functional class IV, and d) with comorbilities such as obstructive lung disease, diabetes, peripheral arterial diseases, require additional study.", 
    "35": "Ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cause of death in industrialized countries. This is a result of persistent risk factors and aging of the population. Medical progress with application of conservative, surgical or interventional strategies indeed reduced the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases, but markedly increased the medical care costs. The result is a discussion about the optimal use of the different therapeutic measures under consideration of the evidence based medicine. This article reviews several recently published clinical trials and discusses, which patient with symptomatic coronary artery disease should undergo a conservative strategy, percutaneous or surgical revascularization.", 
    "36": "The economic burden of congestive heart failure is significant. Approximately 1 to 2% of total health care expenditure is attributed to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of congestive heart failure. A great share of this expenditure is related to the costs of long-term complications and productivity losses. In order to manage these costs, providers and policymakers increasingly have to focus on economically attractive interventions. Pharmacoeconomic analyses aid the systematic selection of cost-effective drug therapy in congestive heart failure in an era of increasing cost-containment.", 
    "37": "During and after surgical procedures a strong activation of the sympatho-adrenergic system is common with correlation to adverse cardiac outcome. Several drugs (alpha 2-adrenoceptor-agonists, beta blockers) are discussed to prevent this reaction. The new alpha 2-adrenoceptor-agonist mivazerol with marked specificity for alpha 2-adrenergic receptors may be suitable for this indication. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of perioperative continuous administration of mivazerol on plasma catecholamines, body temperature and calculated haemodynamic parameters in the early postoperative period in cardiac risk patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.", 
    "38": "36 patients with known coronary heart disease or risk factors for coronary heart disease scheduled for elective abdominal or vascular surgery were included in the study. Patients received either mivazerol (n = 18) or placebo (n = 18) [initial dose 4 micrograms kg-1 for 10 minutes before induction of anaesthesia, followed by a continuous infusion of 1.5 micrograms kg-1 h-1 intraoperatively and for as long as 72 h after surgery] in a double-blinded, randomized manner. Blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature were measured every 10 minutes until 240 minutes after arrival at the ICU. During 240 minutes after arrival at the ICU measured parameters (CVP, PAP, PCWP, SaO2, SvO2, CO), calculated parameters (CI, SVR, PVR, VO2) and plasma catecholamines were measured at defined time intervalls.", 
    "39": "The plasma concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine and the heart rate were significantly lower in the mivazerol group in the study period. Regarding blood pressure and body temperature there were no differences between the groups. At some measuring points preload was higher in the mivazerol group, but there were no differences between the groups for measured (SaO2, SvO2, CO) and calculated (CI, SVR, PVR, VO2) cardiorespiratory parameters. The incidence of shivering, nausea and vomiting were similar in both groups.", 
    "40": "Continuous, perioperative administration of mivazerol decreased the heart rate and the plasma catecholamines in the early postoperative period, but did not affect blood pressure, body temperature and the incidence of shivering. There were also no effects of mivazerol on calculated haemodynamic parameters (CO, SVR, PVR, VO2). These findings show a selective decrease in heart rate by Mivazerol without markedly cardiorespiratory side effects.",

All patients were interviewed and examined, blood tests were performed, and endometrial thickness in the anterior-posterior diameter was measured by vaginal ultrasonography. Among the exclusion criteria were diabetes or an abnormal fasting blood glucose level, obesity, hormonal medication or replacement hormonal therapy during the previous 6 months, and a history of hormonal disturbances, infertility, or polycystic ovary syndrome.",

They were compared with 25 healthy women. There was no statistically significant difference in endometrial thickness between women treated with medications, including beta-blockers, and those who were treated with other hypotensive agents. Twenty percent of women with hypertension and none of the healthy women had endometrium >5 mm thick (P <.017; odds ratio, 8.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-infinity).",

    "45": "Neuronal nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels of the central and peripheral central nervous system that regulate synaptic activity from both pre- and postsynaptic sites. The present study establishes the acute interaction of bupropion, an antidepressant agent that is also effective in nicotine dependence, with nicotine and nicotinic receptors using different in vivo and in vitro tests. Bupropion was found to block nicotine's antinociception (in two tests), motor effects, hypothermia, and convulsive effects with different potencies in the present investigation, suggesting that bupropion possesses some selectivity for neuronal nicotinic receptors underlying these various nicotinic effects. In addition, bupropion blocks nicotine activation of alpha(3)beta(2), alpha(4)beta(2), and alpha(7) neuronal acetylcholine nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) with some degree of selectivity. It was approximately 50 and 12 times more effective in blocking alpha(3)beta(2) and alpha(4)beta(2) than alpha(7.) This functional blockade was noncompetitive, because it was insurmountable by increasing concentration of ACh in the nAChRs subtypes tested. Furthermore, bupropion at high concentration failed to displace brain [(3)H]nicotine binding sites, a site largely composed of alpha(4)beta(2) subunit combination. Given the observation that bupropion inhibition of alpha(3)beta(2) and alpha(4)beta(2) receptors exhibits voltage-independence properties, bupropion may not be acting as an open channel blocker. These effects may explain in part bupropion's efficacy in nicotine dependence. Our present findings suggest that functional blockade of neuronal nAChRs are useful in nicotine dependence treatment.", 
    "46": "Schizophrenics have cortical dysfunction that may involve mesoprefrontal dopamine (DA) systems. Rates of nicotine dependence approach 90% in schizophrenia, and nicotine administration through cigarette smoking may ameliorate cognitive dysfunction, which may be related to cortical DA dysregulation. We have shown that repeated, but not acute, nicotine pretreatment (0.15 mg/kg daily s.c.) reduces footshock stress-induced mesoprefrontal DA metabolism and immobility responses. This effect of repeated nicotine is dependent on mecamylamine (MEC)-sensitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation and endogenous opioid peptides. In the present study, we have further characterized these effects of repeated nicotine on the stress reactivity of mesoprefrontal DA neurons by using the following: 1) local infusion of MEC into cell bodies (ventral tegmental area) and terminal fields (medial prefrontal cortex) to determine the site of action of nicotine; and 2) systemic administration of selective nAChR antagonists. Results of bilateral local infusions of MEC (0.1-1.0 microgram/side) into ventral tegmental area or medial prefrontal cortex in saline- and nicotine-pretreated rats suggests a modulatory role for somatodendritic versus terminal field nAChRs on mesoprefrontal DA neurons under stress-induced states. Experiments with dihydro-beta-erythroidine (a beta2-subunit-selective blocker; 0.0-3.0 mg/kg) and methylycaconitine (an alpha7-subunit-selective blocker; 0.0-8.4 mg/kg) suggest that both alpha4beta2- and alpha7-containing nAChRs modulate mesoprefrontal DA neurons. Thus, complex regulation of mesoprefrontal DA neurons by nAChRs is suggested, which may have relevance to prefrontal cortical DA dysfunction and the high comorbid rates of nicotine dependence in schizophrenia.", 
    "47": "A cross-sectional study in a sample of 3,291 healthy workers was performed in May 1997 to assess the prevalence of obesity (BMI > or = 30 kg/m2) in a working population, and to compare prescription of antihypertensive drugs in obese and non obese subjects. Obesity was found in 7.4% (245) subjects and morbid obesity concerned 0.4% of the total sample (mean age 37.6 +/- 9.7 [SD] years, 52.4% of males). Risk of obesity was significantly associated with age, male sex, professional classes (higher in blue collars workers, lower in senior executive), business travels, atypical schedules, professional and private difficulties. Albeit the prevalence of drug users (49.7%) was similar whatever the BMI, obese subjects used a higher number of drugs than non obese (2.0 +/- 1.2 versus 1.6 +/- 0.9, p < 0.001). Risk of consumption of cardiovascular drugs was higher in obese than in non obese subjects (OR 2.9, 95% CI [2.2-4.1]). After adjustment on confounding factors, obesity increased specific drug use such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (OR 3.3, 95% CI [1.7-6.4]), beta-blocking agents (OR 2.83, 95% CI [1.01-8.01]), calcium channel blockers (OR 2.44, 95% CI [1.06-5.63]) or diuretics only in women (OR 5.7, 95% CI [2.1-16.3]). Prescribed antihypertensive drugs were different in obese (beta-blockers = angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors > diuretics > calcium channels blockers) and non obese (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors > calcium channel blockers > diuretics > beta-blockers) subjects.", 
    "48": "Local Pulse Pressure (PP) is an independent determinant of carotid artery wall thickness, stronger than mean BP. The present study was designed to assess whether a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist or an ACE inhibitor-based treatment was able to reduce carotid artery wall hypertrophy through the reduction in carotid PP rather than by lowering mean BP, and whether the influence of local PP reduction could also be detected at the site of a muscular artery, the radial artery.", 
    "49": "Ninety-eight essential hypertensive patients were randomised to 9 months of double-blind treatment with either celiprolol or enalapril. Arterial parameters were determined with high resolution echotracking systems. PP was measured locally with PP applanation tonometry, and independently of mean BP. After 9 month's treatment, mean BP, carotid PP and intima-media thickness (IMT) decreased significantly, with no difference between the tow groups. The reduction in carotid pression puls\u00e9e, but not in mean BP, was a major independent determinant of the reduction in carotid IMT. Radial artery IMT and PP decreased significantly with both treatments. However, the reduction in radial artery IMT was not related to the changes in radial artery PP.", 
    "50": "The regression of carotid artery wall hypertrophy during long-term antihypertensive treatment was dependent on the reduction in local PP rather than on the lowering of mean BP. The effect of PP lowering on IMT reduction was observed at the site of an elastic artery but not at the site of a muscular artery.", 
    "51": "Effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol and alprenolol in the oocyte maturation of the catfish (Clarias batrachus) were investigated under in vitro. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels were also measured in the control, propranolol and phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor treated oocytes. When full-grown folliculated oocytes were cultured in vitro in the presence of different concentrations of propranolol or alprenolol, both the substances induced germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) in a dose-dependent manner. The maturational effect of alprenolol at the concentration of 1.0 mM was similar to that of the 1.5 mM dose of propranolol inducing more than 88% GVBD. In the time course study, when the oocytes were treated with 1.5 mM propranolol or with 1.0 mM alprenolol for various times, both the antagonists induced more than 80% GVBD after 4 h of incubations and this induction gradually increased with the increased duration of treatments. On the other hand, 1.5 mM propranolol treatment caused a significant decrease in oocyte cAMP which was maintained upto the duration of the study (36 h). When the oocytes were first stimulated by 1.5 mM propranolol or 1.0 mM alprenolol for 4 h and then treated with various doses of cAMP or PDE inhibitors (IBMX and theophylline), all these substances effectively blocked beta-adrenoceptor antagonist-induced GVBD. Both these PDE inhibitors promoted the accumulation of cAMP in the oocytes. These results provide the first example of an existence of a cAMP-mediated mechanism of action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the induction of oocyte maturation in fish.", 
    "52": "Previous studies identified a prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) receptor in the salivary glands of partially fed female lone star ticks, Amblyomma americanum (L.). In the present studies, protein secretion from dispersed salivary gland acini was shown to be specific for PGE(2), as compared with PGF(2alpha) or the thromboxane analog U-46619, in accordance with their respective binding affinities for the PGE(2) receptor. Furthermore, the selective PGE(2) EP1 receptor agonist, 17-phenyl trinor PGE(2), was as effective as PGE(2) in stimulating secretion of anticoagulant protein. Calcium ionophore A-23187 (1 to 100 microM) stimulated secretion of anticoagulant protein in a dose-dependent manner but the voltage-gated Ca(2+)-channel blocker verapamil (1 to 1000 microM) and the receptor-mediated Ca(2+)-entry antagonist, SK&F 96365 (1 and 10 microM), and 5mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,NN', N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) had no appreciable effect on inhibiting PGE(2)-stimulated secretion of anticoagulant protein. PGE(2) (0.1 microM) and the non-hydrolyzable analog of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), GTPgammaS (10 microM), directly activated phospholipase C (PLC) in a membrane-enriched fraction of the salivary glands after PLC was first incubated with the PGE(2) EP1 receptor antagonist AH-6809, which presumably antagonized endogenous PGE(2) (0.3 microM) in the broken-cell-membrane-enriched fraction. TMB-8, an antagonist of intracellular inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors, inhibited PGE(2)-stimulated secretion. The results support the hypothesis that PGE(2) stimulates secretion of tick salivary gland protein via a phosphoinositide signaling pathway and mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+).", 
    "53": "We investigated the role of the spinal noradrenergic system in the antinociceptive effect of FR140423, 3-(difluoromethyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-[4-(methylsulfinyl)phenyl]py razole, by using the tail-pinch test in mice and various adrenoceptor antagonists. The antinociceptive effect of FR140423 injected i.t. was completely abolished by co-administration of the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine and the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine but not by the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Oral administration of FR140423, at doses of 5-80 mg/kg, produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect with an ED(50) value of 19 mg/kg. This antinociception was abolished by i.t., but not i.c.v., injection of phentolamine and yohimbine (10 microg/mouse). These results suggest that alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in the spinal cord are involved in the antinociceptive effect of FR140423 against mechanical noxious stimulus as they are in the effect of morphine and clonidine.", 
    "54": "Vascular remodeling and rearrangement of the extracellular matrix formation are among the major adaptive mechanisms to chronic increase in blood pressure. In previous studies we have found that angiotensin II (Ang II) participates in the hypertension-associated aortic and renal vascular fibrosis by stimulating collagen type I formation. The purpose of the present study was to gain insight into the molecular events that lead from the Ang II receptor to collagen I gene activation. To this end, we used a novel strain of transgenic mice harboring the luciferase gene under the control of the collagen I-alpha(2) chain promoter [procolalpha(2)(I)]. Ang II produced an early (1 hour) 2- to 3-fold stimulation of procolalpha(2)(I) activity in freshly isolated aortas and renal cortical slices (P:<0. 01) followed by similar increase in procolalpha(2)(I) mRNA aortic levels. This effect of Ang II was inhibited by AT1-receptor antagonism (candesartan) and blockade of the MAPK/ERK cascade (PD98059); in contrast, inhibition of the P38 kinase pathway (SB202190) and blockade of the release of the transcription factor NFkappaB (PDTC) did not have any effect in the Ang II-induced activation of the collagen I gene. In addition, Ang II induced a rapid (5 minutes) increase of the MAPK/ERK activity that was accompanied by increased expression (3-fold) of the c-fos proto-oncogene. This increase of c-fos mRNA expression was blocked by PD98059; in addition, curcumin, a blocker of the transcriptional factor AP-1, canceled the effect of Ang II on the collagen I gene. Decorin, a scavenger of the active form of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), canceled the Ang II effect on collagen I gene, whereas inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway had no effect on the TGF-beta-induced activation of procolalpha(2)(I). These data indicate that the cellular events after AT1 receptor stimulation and leading to activation of collagen I gene expression require activation of both the MAPK/ERK and TGF-beta signaling pathways.", 
    "55": "These experiments for the first time examine simultaneous changes in glucose and lactate in unanaesthetised animals during moderate hypoxia. Unanaesthetised rats were exposed to moderate hypoxia for a period of 15 min by reducing inspired oxygen to 8%. Changes in glucose and lactate were monitored in rat cortex using microdialysis and a novel dual enzyme-based assay. Samples of dialysate collected at 3-min intervals were assayed for both glucose and lactate. There was an early rapid rise of lactate that reached a peak at the end of the period of hypoxia followed by a steep decline. Glucose showed a very much smaller delayed increase that started during the period of hypoxia and continued beyond it. The origin of the rise in glucose is discussed, using the temporal relationship between the lactate and glucose changes.",

Injection of d,l-sotalol (2 mg/kg) prolonged QT interval more in affected dogs (+14%, n = 9) than it did in unaffected dogs (+6%, n = 6, p < 0.05) and increased the severity of arrhythmias in affected dogs. In vitro, in control conditions, action potential duration (APD90) of endomyocardial biopsies and Purkinje fibers were significantly longer in affected dogs (respectively 209 +/- 3 ms, n = 30 and 352 +/- 15 ms, n = 17) than they were in unaffected dogs (197 +/- 4 ms, n = 25 and 300 +/- 9 ms, n = 30) at a pacing cycle length (PCL) of 1,000 ms. This difference increased with PCL. The kinetics of adaptation of APD90 to a change in PCL was faster in affected dogs. D,l-sotalol (10(-5) and 10(-4)M) increased APD90 in both groups of dogs, but this increase was greater in affected dogs, with the occurrence of triggered activity on Purkinje fibers. E-4031 (10(-7) and 10(-6) M), an I(Kr)-blocker, increased APD90 similarly in both groups of dogs.

    "61": "The binding and displacement of beta-adrenoceptor blockers, [3H]propranolol ([3H]PRP) and [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA), were studied on isolated rat erythrocytes, their membranes and ghosts; the binding of [3H]DHA and a M-cholinoceptor blocker, [3H]quinuclidinylbenzylate ([3H]QNB), on cerebral cortex membranes. In all experiments, ligand-receptor interactions conformed to a model of two pools of receptors in the same effector system and the binding of two ligand molecules to the receptor. The results were similar for the displacement of [3H]PRP, [3H]DHA and [3H]QNB with propranolol, dihydroalprenolol and quinuclidinyl-benzylate, respectively. The parameters of [3H]PRP to beta-adrenoceptor binding for intact erythrocytes were: Kd1 = 0.74+/-0.07 nM, Kd2 = 14.40+/-0.41 nM, B1 = 24+/-2 unit/cell, B2 = 263+/-5 unit/cell; for ghosts, Kd1 = 0.70+/-0.17 nM, Kd2 = 19.59+/-2.59 nM, B1 = 9+/-1 fmol/mg protein, B2 = 39+/-4 fmol/mg protein. Receptor affinities were similar in erythrocytes and ghosts; on the ghost membrane, the number of receptors was considerably lower (B1 = 2 unit/cell, B2 = 6 unit/cell).

    "62": "The objective of the present study was to evaluate the benefit of beta-blocker therapy for patients with Takayasu arteritis complicated by moderate or severe aortic regurgitation. Clinical and echocardiographic evaluation was performed in 20 Japanese women in a follow-up period of 7.0 +/- 2.0 years. The patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A (n=10) patients who did not receive beta-blockers, and Group B (n=10) patients treated with long-term (5.1 +/- 1.6 years) therapeutic doses of beta-blockers. Left ventricular wall thickness increased significantly in all Takayasu patients who did not receive beta-blockers. Consequently, a remarkable increment in left ventricular mass took place (232 +/- 59 to 361 +/- 79 g; p < 0.005). In the same group, progressive worsening of the symptoms, with no reduction in the percent fractional shortening, was observed in 2 patients, while reduction of this last index was present in 1 asymptomatic patient. On the other hand, among the patients who were treated with beta-blockers, left ventricular mass still increased in 6 cases, while it clearly decreased in the other 4 cases (290 +/- 171 to 284 +/- 61 g; NS). The increment in wall thickness or left ventricular mass observed among patients with beta-blocker therapy was clearly less than the one registered among those who had not received beta-blockers. Furthermore, no worsening of the symptoms and/or left ventricular performance was observed during the follow-up period for patients receiving beta-blockers. We conclude that beta-blocker therapy can slow and even reverse the progression of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with Takayasu arteritis complicated by moderate or severe aortic regurgitation. The mechanism still needs to be elucidated. We believe an effective reduction in the excessive afterload imposed on the left ventricle to be most likely responsible, but cardiac beta-receptor up-regulation might also be involved. Deterioration of the clinical status and/or impairment of left ventricular function were not associated with beta-blocker therapy in our patients. Therefore, these agents can be used safely alone or in addition to standard anti-hypertensive therapy when attempting to reduce excessive afterload, in spite of the presence of severe aortic regurgitation.", 
    "63": "The capacity of beta-blockers to prevent cardiac events in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients was investigated. Among 1,483 study participants, a beta-blocker was included in the therapeutic regimens of 833 (beta-blocker group) and was omitted from the regimens of 650 (control group). The incidence of cardiac events (recurrent MI, sudden death and death by congestive heart failure) during a follow up period of 17.4 +/- 20.9 months was retrospectively compared between the two groups. Cardiac events occurred in 27 (3.2%) members of the beta-blocker group and in 44 (6.8%) controls, which represents a significant decline in the incidence of cardiac events among patients administered beta-blockers (p < 0.01, odds ratio 0.46, 95 % confidence intervals 0.28-0.75). Subgroup and multivariate analyses showed beta-blockers to be as efficacious in Japanese post-MI patients as was previously shown in Western patients. While these findings are compelling, it is clear that confirmation in a large, multicenter, placebo - controlled, randomized clinical trial, analogous to those that have been carried out in Western countries, is necessary.",

    "65": "African Americans outrank other ethnic groups in the United States in prevalence, early onset, and severity of hypertension. Furthermore, African Americans suffer the highest rates of mortality from cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and end-stage renal disease. The recently concluded Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study reports that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in a broad range of patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. These results strengthen the case for increasing the use of ACE inhibitor therapy. In accord with the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) guidelines, antihypertensive monotherapy for African Americans is based on the known ability of diuretics and calcium channel blockers to produce greater reductions in blood pressure in this population than those attainable with beta blockers and ACE inhibitors. The national guidelines also suggest ACE inhibitors for all hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction or nephropathy, which implies that African Americans must cross a clinical threshold to become candidates for these agents. The rationale for delaying ACE inhibitor therapy is due in part to a perceived unique pathobiology in hypertensive African Americans: an excess prevalence of salt sensitivity, hypervolemia, and low plasma renin activity (PRA). At first glance, it would seem intuitive to avoid agents that further depress the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and choose agents that reduce plasma volume. However, most hypertensive African Americans are not hypovolemic. Furthermore, dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy raise PRA and improve the response to ACE inhibitors. The overall aim of this article is to explain the rationale for expanded use of drugs that block the RAS in African Americans and low-renin populations.",

The method was applied to muscle and kidney from untreated pigs, the samples being spiked with the three molecules of interest. Recovery was between 70 and 106%. Quantification parameters were also good: the accuracy was between 80 and 110% and the coefficient of variation did not exceed 16%, being below 8% for 90% of the samples. Linearity was good from MRL/4 to 2MRL. For unequivocal identification of each analyte, four ions were detected. The method proved very suitable for routine analysis.", 
    "67": "A propranolol-derived molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) was prepared using methacrylic acid as monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as cross-linker. The extraction properties of five compounds structurally related to propranolol were assessed on the MIP and on a blank polymer made under the same conditions but in the absence of an imprint molecule. Using application from aqueous solution with methanol-water-triethylamine (TEA)-based solvents for elution (i.e. reversed-phase conditions) the MIP showed only marginal selectivity for the compounds on the MIP compared to the blank. Despite the limited selectivity there did appear to be a relationship between structure of the compound (relative to propranolol) and the extent of selective retention. Application of the compounds in toluene with elution using toluene-TEA or toluene-trifluoroacetic acid resulted in the MIP showing dramatically enhanced retention and selectivity of the compounds on the MIP compared to the blank. The enhanced selectivity for extraction on to the MIP relative to the blank, for all compounds using normal-phase solvents seem to be a class effect as there was no apparent relationship between compound structure and retention.", 
    "68": "The gene for the porcine beta2-adrenergic receptor (pbeta2AR) was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for expression. Fourteen stable cell lines were obtained and exhibited receptor densities ranging from 12 to 2,371 fmol/mg membrane protein. The receptor density was not correlated with estimates of gene copy number obtained by Southern hybridization. The pbeta2AR in CHO cells exhibited saturable binding of [125I]CYP (Kd = 14.5 pM) and stereospecificity for (-)- and (+)-isoproterenol. The relative affinities for (-)-isoproterenol (ISO), (-)-epinephrine (EPI), and (-)-norepinephrine (NEPI) were ISO > EPI > NEPI, which are characteristic of beta2AR. The affinity values for these ligands were similar to those in other species. Binding of ISO, EPI, and NE revealed two affinity states of the betaAR; the high-affinity state was eliminated by adding Gpp(NH)p, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue. Binding of the antagonist propranolol modeled to only one affinity state, and Gpp(NH)p did not affect binding. Multiple affinity states are characteristic of agonist-induced coupling of betaAR with G-proteins, and the data suggest that the cloned pbetaAR is functionally competent. Data confirm that the pbeta2AR is the pig version of beta2AR. Stable CHO cell lines will be useful for characterization of pbeta2AR and screening and designing potential drugs that may be used to enhance pig production.", 
    "69": "Since the renaissance of tilt table testing in clinical cardiology some 15 years ago, the syndromes of autonomic dysfunction with orthostatic intolerance underwent improved differentiation and classification. In the present review a variant of autonomic dysfunction with orthostatic intolerance--POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome)--will be discussed.", 
    "70": "The affected patients present with orthostatic intolerance, postural tachycardia, exercise intolerance, fatigue, dizziness and in some cases with other dysautonomic symptoms such as gastrointestinal or sudomotor dysfunction. Together with the clinical history, tilt table testing is the cornerstone of diagnostic evaluation by which the syndrome can be distinguished from typical neurocardiogenic disorders. POTS is characterized by different subtypes; accordingly, therapy for relief of symptoms is variable and includes beta blockers for patients with the hyperadrenergic type and alphamimetics for those with partial dysautonomia.", 
    "71": "Although it is now possible to differ POTS from other forms of autonomic dysfunction, further research is warranted to clarify the pathophysiology of this syndrome and its subtypes and to improve therapeutic interventions.", 
    "72": "Lambda-carrageenan, a linear, high molecular weight sulfated polysaccharide, was successfully employed in both its native and sulfobutyl derivatized form as a chiral selector in capillary electrophoresis for the separation of enantiomers of basic pharmaceutical compounds. In order to characterize the chiral selectivity properties of this chiral selector, various structurally related racemic compounds were analyzed for enantiomeric interactions using capillary electrophoresis. The results of these studies were then rationalized and analyzed utilizing a general quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) evaluation in order to predict critical analyte structural requirements for successful enantiomeric separation. Important structural components of the analytes were found to include the aromatic content, the type of substitution on the aromatic ring, presence of a primary or secondary protonated amine, and an overall positive charge to the molecule.", 
    "73": "The alpha and beta subunits of the amiloride-sensitive rat epithelial sodium channel (alpha beta ENaC) were expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used a combination of yeast strains, including a mutant in the secretory pathway (sec6), and Western blotting techniques, to show that alpha beta ENaC was synthesized and targeted through the secretory system to the plasma membrane. Yeasts expressing alpha beta ENaC were more sensitive to salt than the parent strain. In addition, amiloride, a specific blocker of ENaC, was found to suppress salt sensitivity in the yeast strain expressing alpha beta ENaC.", 
    "74": "Uncontrolled trials of strategies directed at inadequate antidepressant response are prone to falsely positive results. Most of those studies which have used placebo control have assessed augmentation and the addition of lithium to tricyclic antidepressants or serotonin reuptake inhibitors has so far received the most support. A smaller literature shows promise for augmentation with triiodothyronine, pindolol and dehydroepiandrosterone.", 
    "75": "We have shown that the stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors is an important step in venom production in the Bothrops jararaca venom gland. In the present study, the pharmacological profile of the beta-adrenoceptor present in Bothrops jararaca venom gland was characterized by radioligand binding assay and by the ability of isoprenaline to promote accumulation of cyclic AMP in dispersed secretory cells. In both cases, the venom glands were obtained from non-extracted snakes (quiescent stage) or from snakes which venom was extracted 4 days before sacrifice (venom production stimulated stage). [125I]-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]-ICYP) bound to extracted gland membranes in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner, but with low affinity. Propranolol, beta1- or beta2-selective adrenoceptors ligands displaced the [125I]-ICYP binding with low affinity, while selective beta3-adrenoceptor ligands did not displace the [125I]-ICYP binding. The displacement of [125I]-ICYP by propranolol was similar in non-extracted and extracted glands, showing the presence of beta-adrenoceptors in both stages. In dispersed secretory cells of non-extracted glands, isoprenaline (1 microM) increased the cyclic AMP production and propranolol (10 microM) was able to block this effect. On the other hand, in extracted glands, isoprenaline had no effect. The results suggest that the beta-adrenoceptors present in the Bothrops jararaca venom glands are different from those (beta1, beta2 or beta3) described in mammals, but are coupled to the Gs protein, like the known beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. Moreover, previous in vivo stimulation of venom production desensitizes the beta-adrenoceptors system and, although the receptors could be detected by binding studies, they are not coupled to the Gs protein, indicating that beta-adrenoceptors stimulation contributes to the initial steps of venom synthesis.", 
    "76": "A 27-year-old man diagnosed as having dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without myocardial accumulation of 123I-beta-methyl-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid, and he was found to have type I CD36 deficiency. This abnormality of cardiac free fatty acid metabolism was also confirmed by other methods: 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, measurements of myocardial respiratory quotient and cardiac fatty acid uptake. Although the type I CD36 deficiency was reconfirmed after 3 months, the abnormal free fatty acid metabolism improved after carvedilol therapy and was accompanied by improved cardiac function. Apart from a cause-and-effect relationship, carvedilol can improve cardiac function and increase free fatty acid metabolism in patients with both DCM and CD36 deficiency.", 
    "77": "Fifty patients with stable slight and moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension, treated by ramipril, atenolol, or isradipine, were examined. Total protein and urinary excretion of individual proteins were studied before and after treatment. Urinary concentrations of apolipoproteins A1 and B1, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, prealbumin, albumin, beta 2-microglobulin, transferrin, haptoglobin, IgG and IgA, and C3 and C4 complement components were measured. Index of proteinuria selectiveness was calculated for each portion of urine. All three drugs exerted a nephroprotective effect, atenolol being the most active of them. Apolipoproteins, IgG, and complement components were the most valuable for diagnosis. Their excretion correlated with the severity of arterial hypertension and efficiency of treatment. Use of protein markers helps reliably assess the renal function and monitor the treatment efficiency.", 
    "78": "Essential hypertension is frequently associated with the metabolic abnormalities of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. This prevalent clustering of multiple cardiovascular risk factors may help explain the less-than-expected improvement in coronary heart disease mortality provided by simple blood pressure reduction alone. Many antihypertensive medications effectively reduce blood pressure while providing no benefit or even causing a detrimental effect on the associated metabolic abnormalities. beta-Blockers and diuretics tend to negatively affect both glucose tolerance and plasma lipids. Calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers are most often found to be metabolically neutral. alpha-Blockers provide the most favorable metabolic effects of antihypertensive agents by improving both insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia. The multiple physiologic mechanisms by which blood pressure medications alter plasma lipids are discussed in detail. The effects of antihypertensive medications on postprandial lipid metabolism and the associated postprandial lipemia-induced endothelial dysfunction deserve special attention.", 
    "79": "Efforts to influence medical practice include the formation of expert medical panels who make recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of clinical problems. Despite the considerable expense and effort that go into these activities, it is unclear whether they are successful. Recent studies have evaluated whether recommendations from the Fifth Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC V) published in 1993 influenced antihypertensive prescribing patterns. These included a national study of medications dispensed by retail pharmacies and an evaluation of antihypertensive prescribing patterns in US Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities. Despite recommendations from JNC V that hydrochlorothiazide and beta-blockers be used as first choice for most hypertensive patients, calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were the most common drugs prescribed for hypertension in both 1992 (before JNC V) and 1995 (after JNC V). In retail pharmacies, changes in antihypertensive drug dispensing patterns from 1992 to 1995 reflected increased use of calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors and decreased use of diuretics and beta-blockers, suggesting that JNC V recommendations had little effect on prescribing patterns. Similar patterns of antihypertensive drug use were found in VA facilities. The reasons for the lack of influence of JNC V recommendations on antihypertensive prescribing patterns must be explored and alternative ways of educating health care providers implemented.", 
    "80": "The treatment of hypertension has progressed from a few nontoxic choices to the close to 60 individual drugs listed in the recommendations of the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI). Many combination drugs are also listed for use. The JNC documents have suggested initial therapy with diuretic or beta-blocker since 1993. Practitioners have followed these suggestions or not followed them on the basis of their personal bias. Since the 1997 JNC VI report, several studies that seem to support an individualistic approach to treatment have been reported. This is an exciting time in hypertension research. Clinicians who treat this common disorder will continue to line up as indiscriminate or individualistic prescribers, depending on their interpretation of the available data. We expect the hypertensive patient to be the winner of this increased attention.", 
    "81": "Essential hypertension is associated with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation and is caused mainly by production of oxygen free radicals that can destroy nitric oxide (NO), impairing its beneficial and protective effects on the vessel wall. Antihypertensive drugs can improve or restore endothelium-dependent vasodilation depending on their ability to counteract the mechanisms that impair endothelial function. Although treatment with atenolol gives negative results in peripheral subcutaneous and muscle microcirculation, acute nebivolol exerts a modest vasodilating effect in the forearm circulation. Whether this compound can activate NO production in essential hypertensive patients is controversial. Calcium entry blockers, particularly the dihydropyridine-like drugs, can reverse impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in different vascular districts, including the subcutaneous, epicardial, and peripheral arteries and forearm circulation. In the forearm circulation, nifedipine and lacidipine can improve endothelial dysfunction by restoring NO availability. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, however, seem to improve endothelial function in subcutaneous, epicardial, and renal circulation, but are ineffective in potentiating the blunted response to acetylcholine in the forearm of patients with essential hypertension. Finally, recent evidence suggests angiotensin II receptor antagonists can restore endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine in subcutaneous, but not in the forearm muscle, microcirculation. However, treatment with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist can improve basal NO release and decrease the vasoconstrictor effect of endogenous endothelin-1.", 
    "82": "Diabetes mellitus without previous myocardial infarction carries the same risk of a future myocardial infarction as someone who has had one. Intense glucose, lipid, and blood pressure control in diabetic patients is advocated to reduce cardiovascular events and decrease the incidence of end-stage renal disease, retinal damage, and peripheral vascular disease. Recent studies, including the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, indicate that low-dose diuretics, compared with placebo, reduce fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions but not fatal and nonfatal strokes in diabetic patients. Similarly, captopril (and diuretics) compared with diuretics and beta-blockers decreased fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions but not fatal and nonfatal strokes in the Captopril Prevention Project. Intense blood pressure therapy with captopril and intense blood pressure therapy with atenolol equally lowered macrovascular and microvascular events compared with less intense blood pressure treatment in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study. Fewer myocardial infarctions were seen with enalapril than with nisoldipine in the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes trial. Intense blood pressure control with felodipine, enalapril, and hydrochlorothiazide reduced overall cardiovascular events and mortality but not myocardial infarction and strokes in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment trial. Nitrendipine alone or together with enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide decreased fatal and nonfatal strokes and cardiovascular mortality but not myocardial infarctions in the Systolic Hypertension in Europe trial. These trials, in aggregate, reinforce the importance of intense blood pressure control, which can be achieved only with combination drug therapy rather than a specific monotherapy drug class recommendation.", 
    "83": "Clear evidence shows that decreasing blood pressure reduces risks for major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the separate effects of the various classes of blood pressure-lowering agents and the effects of blood pressure lowering in patients at high risk, particularly in the absence of hypertension. Several new randomized controlled trials have been started in the past few years in an effort to address these questions. However, individually, these studies are unlikely to resolve all current uncertainties. For this reason, systematic overviews and meta-analyses of the major ongoing trials are planned. The overviews will be conducted as a collaboration among the principal investigators of the participating trials and will involve about 270,000 patients and 1.1 million patient-years of follow-up. The combined trial results should provide good statistical power to detect even modest differences in the effects of various treatments on major cardiovascular outcomes.", 
    "84": "Morbidity and mortality data that increasingly favor the use of diuretics and beta-blockers continue to accumulate. Nonetheless, the use of these agents particularly diuretics is viewed as a dated practice. The issue of which antihypertensive drug to use will remain complex and confusing as the marketing juggernauts of the pharmaceutical industry vigorously promote drug classes such as angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, and calcium-channel blockers. A pharmacologic middle ground will probably be reached in the form of fixed-dose combination therapy. Diuretics and b-blockers are mechanistically rational when combined with numerous other drugs; thus, the issue of which drug should be used to begin treatment will be settled by a truce, albeit an uneasy one, favoring the increased use of fixed-dose combination antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "85": "Antihypertensive treatment may promote cancer through unknown mechanisms. Early retrospective studies implicated reserpine in breast cancer, but the drug was later absolved by prospective analyses. Data from case-controlled studies and several cohort studies suggested an association between the use of a diuretic and the occurrence of renal cell cancer. Several prospective studies showed that treatment with atenolol may increase mortality from malignancy. However, other studies that analyzed data from several thousand patients could not confirm this association. In two prospective studies, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were associated with increased mortality from malignancy, but a few case-controlled studies showed no association between use of ACE inhibitors and malignancy. In addition, a recent retrospective study showed that long-term use of ACE inhibitors had a protective effect against malignancy. In some studies, calcium antagonists were implicated in increasing the risk for cancer; however, two large case-controlled studies and the combined data from nine observational studies showed a similar risk for malignancy among users and nonusers of a calcium antagonist. Ongoing long-term prospective studies will tell us more about the carcinogenicity of cardiovascular drugs.", 
    "86": "Controlled clinical trials, performed in more than 13,000 patients, have consistently shown the beneficial effects of long-term beta-blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure. However, it is not clear whether this is a class effect or if it is specific only for some agents. Beneficial effects on the prognosis of the patients with mild to moderate heart failure have been obtained with metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol. Metoprolol and bisoprolol are selective for beta(1)-receptors and without ancillary properties, carvedilol, at doses of 25 mg twice daily, blocks beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and a(1)-adrenergic receptors, and has associated antiproliferative and antioxidant activities. These differences are important for the acute hemodynamic effects, but it is still controversial whether they may also influence the long-term effects of therapy. Differently from selective b-blockers, carvedilol blocks all adrenergic receptors, does not upregulate beta1-receptors, decreases cardiac norepinephrine release, and has associated antioxidant effects. These differences may cause a larger increase in left ventricular function, which was significant in some, but not all of the direct comparisons of the two agents. The long-term effects of different beta-blockers on prognosis are currently compared in the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial, in which more than 3000 patients with chronic heart failure have been 1:1 randomized to metoprolol or carvedilol and are going to be followed for more than 2 years.", 
    "87": "In this article, we review the basic biology, signal transduction pathways, and clinical pharmacology associated with cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) in the context of the use of beta-blocking agents in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Adrenergic receptors, particularly the beta-AR subtypes (beta(1)-AR and beta(2)-AR), are known to play a critical role in the modulation of cardiac function, providing for both \"adaptive\" and \"maladaptive\" compensatory changes. In the context of exercise or self-preservation, the adrenergic nervous system, acting via beta-ARs permits an appropriately rapid, highly-dynamic increase in cardiac function. Conversely, in individuals with chronic congestive heart failure, the sustained, heightened activation of adrenergic nervous system, as manifested by increases in circulating catecholamines, results in down- regulation and desensitization of myocardial beta-ARs, and potentially, significant myocardial damage. A number of recent clinical trials have demonstrated a marked mortality benefit from using beta-blocking agents such as metoprolol and carvedilol in patients with heart failure. The pharmacologic properties of several of these drugs and some of the specifics of their usefulness and limitations are discussed herein.", 
    "88": "Neurohormonal antagonism is now recognized as an essential treatment modality for heart failure. As a prime example, the benefits of blocking the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are clearly established for all four New York Heart Association classes. In this clinical trials review, we discuss two other therapies with neurohormonal targets: beta-blockers and the sympathetic nervous system, and the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone.", 
    "89": "The incidence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) after myocardial infarction (MI), has decreased significantly in the thrombolytic era and may not have a high enough power to predict sudden cardiac death or all-cause mortality post-MI. Nonetheless, noninvasive algorithms that utilize the combination of NSVT with left ventricular dysfunction, abnormal signal-averaged electrocardiogram, and heart rate variability can be used for better risk assessment. Recent multicenter studies have provided strong evidence for the use of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients with NSVT and inducible sustained ventricual tachycardia. On the other hand anti-arrhythmic drugs have no role and most are harmful in asymptomatic patients post-MI with NSVT.", 
    "90": "Sudden cardiac death remains a major public health care problem, generally occurring in patients with ventricular dysfunction. Beta-blockers, already of proven benefit for patients after myocardial infarction, have recently been shown to improve functional status and mortality outcomes in patients with heart failure. Amiodarone, a potent antiarrhythmic drug, was recently studied in a number of randomized clinical trials involving patients with heart failure and patients after myocardial infarction. Routine use of amiodarone cannot be recommended in these patient groups, but serious adverse outcomes were not observed. When antiarrhythmic drug therapy is required, amiodarone is the drug of choice for patients with structural heart disease.", 
    "91": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains a major public health threat. Patients with aborted SCD have a high incidence of recurrent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Antiarrhythmic drug approaches dominated early attempts to prevent SCD; however, several trials with sotalol and amiodarone revealed an unacceptably high rate of recurrent arrhythmic events. With the advent of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), the primary role of antiarrhythmic drug therapy for the secondary prevention of SCD has been called into question. Two recently completed trials, the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) trial and the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS), confirm the superiority of the ICD over the best medical therapy for saving lives.", 
    "92": "Managing patients with heart failure is rooted in appropriate recognition of the syndrome and subsequent tailoring of therapies to individual patients based on the stage of the disease. An individual with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (the earliest stage of heart failure) is treated quite differently than a patient with more advanced heart failure manifested by problematic fluid retention, peripheral organ hypoperfusion with dysfunction, and several comorbidities. The latter patient requires aggressive pharmacologic intervention coupled with other creative strategies that are individually tailored to each individual\"s unique clinical circumstance. The therapies available include long-term administration of parenteral inotropic therapy, dialysis, insertion of a ventricular assist device, cardiac transplantation, dynamic skeletal myoplasty, volume reduction surgery, or more standard (but higher risk) operative procedures. New drugs are constantly undergoing evaluation and may lead to additional therapeutic improvements in patients with advanced heart failure. The key is recognizing the appropriate place for more radical therapies.", 
    "93": "Neurohormonal activation and chronic adrenergic overstimulation appear to play important roles in mediating the progressive pathophysiology of congestive heart failure (CHF), and the beneficial effects of beta-blockade in the management of chronic heart failure have been demonstrated by multiple clinical trials over the last decade. Nevertheless, the initiation and maintenance of beta-blocker therapy in CHF may initially precipitate a deterioration in clinical function, and numerous questions regarding the appropriate use of these agents in patients with heart failure remain. This report examines the practicalities of beta-adrenergic blockade in heart failure, focusing on patient selection, nonselective versus selective blockade, management of adverse effects, and indications for withdrawal of therapy.", 
    "94": "Over the past 20 to 30 years there have been significant advances in the management of heart failure related to improved understanding of pathophysiology, better methods of assessment, and improved drug treatments. The aims of treatment have broadened, with increased emphasis on earlier intervention. Clinical research activity in this area has been considerable, increasingly allowing an evidence-based approach to management. Most earlier trials of treatment were relatively short-term, small-group studies with various clinical end points, including severity of symptoms, exercise performance, and left ventricular function assessment; however, increasingly a higher standard of evidence has been required, including a provision of reliable, large-scale mortality trial data. This has been further encouraged, if not mandated, by the relatively recent appreciation that some agents may demonstrate dissociation of treatment effects, possibly dose related, with improved short-term outcomes but adverse effects on survival with prolonged treatment. The general principles of management of congestive heart failure encompass patient evaluation and confirmation of the diagnosis, consideration, and correction of underlying remediable causes and precipitating factors, pharmacological treatment, patient education and counseling, and planned follow-up, as summarized in recently published guidelines. This review focuses primarily on the available randomized controlled clinical trial evidence related to the pharmacological treatment of the clinical congestive heart failure syndrome. Other aspects of management, such as patient education, counseling, and planned follow-up, should be regarded as complementary to pharmacological treatment and important to ensure compliance and optimal long-term outcomes.", 
    "95": "The purpose of this study was to examine the external predictability of an in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) for a metoprolol hydrophilic matrix extended-release formulation, with an acceptable internal predictability, in the presence of a range of formulation/manufacturing changes. In addition, this report evaluated the predictability of the IVIVC for another formulation of metoprolol tartrate differing in its release mechanism. Study 1 examined the scale up of a matrix extended-release tablet from a 3-kg small batch (I) to a 50-kg large batch (II). The second study examined the influence of scale and processing changes [3-kg small batch with fluid bed granulation and drying (III); 80-kg large batch with high shear granulation and microwave drying (IV), and a formulation with an alternate release mechanism formulated as a multiparticulate capsule (V)]. In vitro dissolution of all formulations (I-V) was conducted with a USP apparatus I at pH 6.8 and 150 rpm. Subjects received the metoprolol formulations, and serial blood samples were collected over 48 h and analyzed by a validated HPLC assay using fluorescence detection. A previously developed IVIVC was used to predict plasma profiles. Prediction errors (PE) were <10% for C(max) and area under the curve (AUC) of concentration versus time for I, II, and IV. The C(max) for III was slightly underestimated (11.7%); however, the PE of the AUC was <10%. Formulation V displayed a PE for C(max) > 20% and an AUC within 5% of observed values. The low PEs for C(max) and AUC observed for I-IV strongly suggest that the metoprolol IVIVC is externally valid, predictive of alternate processing methods (IV), scale-up (II, III), and allows the in vitro dissolution data to be used as a surrogate for validation studies. However, the lack of predictability for V supports the contention that IVIVCs are formulation specific.", 
    "96": "Lipids regularly exhibit complicated thermotropic and lyotropic phase behavior. In this study, the utility of (13)C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SSNMR) in characterizing the phase properties of pharmaceutical lipids was investigated. Variable temperature (13)C SSNMR spectra and spin-lattice relaxation times (T(1)(C)) were obtained for high-purity oleic acid (OA) and propranolol oleate (POA). Spectral changes took place following OA gamma-to-alpha phase transition that indicated increased nuclear inequivalence of aliphatic chain carbons in the alpha phase. T(1)(C) data for the alpha phase demonstrated considerable conformational changes throughout the aliphatic chain, not solely in the methyl side chain as previously reported. These data support alpha-OA classification as a conformationally disordered crystalline phase. The prevalence of low T(1)(C) values in both POA I and II suggested the absence of a rigid crystalline molecular lattice, so both phases were described as conformationally disordered crystalline phases. A two-phase mixture of POA I and II was also identified, emphasizing the sensitivity of this technique. (13)C SSNMR provided valuable information regarding the nuclear environment of specific functional groups in lipid crystalline and mesomorphic structures. Understanding phase behavior at the molecular level can aid selection of appropriate formulation strategies for lipids by allowing prediction of processing properties, and physical and chemical stability. (13)C SSNMR is a powerful technique for pharmaceutical lipid characterization.", 
    "97": "The effect of N-[4-[2-N-methyl-N-[1-methyl-2-(2, 6-dimethylphenoxy)ethylamino]-ethyl]-phenyl]-methanesulfonamide. hydrochloride (GYKI-16638; 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg, i.v.), a novel antiarrhythmic compound, was assessed and compared to that of D-sotalol (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.v.) on arrhythmias induced by 10 min of coronary artery occlusion and 10 min of reperfusion in anaesthetized rabbits. Also, its cellular electrophysiological effects were studied in rabbit right ventricular papillary muscle preparations and in rabbit single isolated ventricular myocytes. In anaesthetized rabbits, intravenous administration of 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg GYKI-16638 and 1 and 3 mg/kg D-sotalol significantly increased survival during reperfusion (GYKI-16638: 82% and 77%, D-sotalol: 75% and 83% vs. 18% in controls, P<0.05, respectively). GYKI-16638 (0.1 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of animals that did not develop arrhythmias during reperfusion (46% vs. 0% in controls, P<0.05). In isolated rabbit right ventricular papillary muscle, 2 microM GYKI-16638, at 1 Hz stimulation frequency, lengthened the action potential duration at 50% and 90% repolarization (APD(50-90)) without influencing the resting membrane potential and action potential amplitude (APA). It decreased the maximal rate of depolarization (V(max)) in a use-dependent manner. This effect was statistically significant only at stimulation cycle lengths shorter than 700 ms. The offset kinetics of this V(max) block were relatively rapid, the corresponding time constant for recovery of V(max) was 328.2+/-65.0 ms. In patch-clamp experiments, performed in rabbit ventricular myocytes, 2 microM GYKI-16638 markedly depressed the rapid component of the delayed rectifier outward and moderately decreased the inward rectifier K(+) current without significantly altering the slow component of the delayed rectifier and transient outward K(+) currents. These results suggest that in rabbits, GYKI-16638 has an in vivo antiarrhythmic effect, comparable to that of D-sotalol, which can be best explained by its combined Class I/B and Class III actions.", 
    "98": "alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, such as clonidine, attenuate hypoxia-induced damage to brain and retinal neurones by a mechanism of action which likely involves stimulation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. In addition, the neuroprotective effect of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists in the retina may involve stimulation of bFGF production. The purpose of this study was to examine more thoroughly the neuroprotective properties of clonidine. In particular, studies were designed to ascertain whether clonidine acts as a free radical scavenger. It is thought that betaxolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, acts as a neuroprotective agent by interacting with sodium and L-type calcium channels to reduce the influx of these ions into stressed neurones. Studies were therefore undertaken to determine whether clonidine has similar properties. In addition, studies were undertaken to determine whether i.p. injections of clonidine or betaxolol affect retinal bFGF mRNA levels. In vitro data were generally in agreement that clonidine and bFGF counteracted the effect of NMDA as would occur in hypoxia. No evidence could be found that clonidine interacts with sodium or L-type calcium channels, reduces calcium influx into neurones or acts as a free radical scavenger at concentrations below 100 microM. Moreover, i.p. injection of clonidine, but not betaxolol, elevated bFGF mRNA levels in the retina. The conclusion from this study is that the neuroprotective properties of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, like clonidine, are very different from betaxolol. The fact that both betaxolol and clonidine blunt hypoxia-induced death to retinal ganglion cells suggests that combining the two drugs may be a way forward to producing more effective neuroprotection.",

For the present study, 5 T-wave morphology descriptors were automatically calculated after singular value decomposition of the ECG signal. The total cosine R-to-T (TCRT [describes the global angle between repolarization and depolarization wavefront]) and the T-wave loop dispersion were univariately associated (P:=0.0002 and P:<0.002, respectively, U: test) with 27 prospectively defined clinical events in 261 patients (mean follow-up 32+/-10 months). Kaplan-Meier event probability curves for strata above and below the median confirmed the strong risk discrimination by TCRT and T-wave loop dispersion (P:<0.003 and P:<0.001, respectively, log-rank test). On Cox regression analysis, with the entering of age, left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, QRS width, reperfusion therapy, beta-adrenergic-blocker treatment, and standard deviation of R-R intervals on 24-hour Holter monitoring, TCRT (P:<0.03) yielded independent predictive value, whereas T-wave loop dispersion was of borderline independence (P:=0.064). Heart rate (P:<0.02), left ventricular ejection fraction (P:<0.02), and reperfusion therapy (P:<0.02) also remained in the final model.",

    "102": "A 68-year-old non-diabetic physician with a known psychiatric history was found dead in his home. The death scene investigation revealed three used insulin syringes on the coffee table next to the body. The autopsy and the consecutive chemical-toxicological investigation revealed that the deceased committed suicide by injecting an overdose of insulin in combination with a high therapeutic oral bolus application of a beta-blocker (Metoprolol). A surprising morphological finding was a terminal pulmonary thromboembolism in the right pulmonary artery.", 
    "103": "Reducing the risk in high-risk surgical patients is a common effort of surgeons, anesthesiologists and internists. Several definitions of high-risk surgery exist and one should differentiate the risk for the development of shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome from explicitly cardiac risk. Insufficient tissue, especially splanchnic, perfusion can lead to a cascade with the liberation of cytokines and adhesion molecules. Ensuring adequate tissue perfusion is therefore of utmost importance. Assessing tissue perfusion and recognizing hypovolemia is, however, a difficult task using only standard clinical signs as blood pressure and heart rate. Several studies where high-risk surgical patients were treated preoperatively with fluid infusions and/or vasoactive drugs, mainly as determined by invasive monitoring, have shown a positive effect on outcome. On the other hand the value of beta-blockade, started preoperatively, in selected patients at high risk for cardiac complications is accumulating and convincing. The author therefore suggests to aim for targets of therapy based on multiple baseline values for each individual patient. The author also calls for stopping the practice, as is still the case in many hospitals, to leave the patients the night before surgery with an overnight fast, without an intravenous infusion with the appropriate amounts of fluids. However, it is concluded that the definition of 'appropriate' is currently still a matter of opinion and not facts.",

    "105": "Retrospective review of administrative data. For 1 performance measure (beta-blocker treatment after a heart attack), a medical record review was performed for purposes of data validation.", 
    "106": "The eligibility criteria differed by the performance measure. Eligible populations for the first, second, and third performance measures, respectively, were: (1) patients aged 35 years or older who were hospitalized and discharged alive with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in calendar year 1996; (2) patients hospitalized for treatment of selected mental health disorders in fiscal year 1997; and (3) female patients aged 21 to 64 years enrolled in VA primary care clinics during fiscal years 1995-1997. We collected data in accordance with HEDIS 3.0 specifications for administrative data.", 
    "107": "With few or no modifications to the HEDIS specifications, we successfully adapted the HEDIS performance measures to the VA setting. We found that, in some areas, VA performance compared favorably to or exceeded that of the private sector. We also identified opportunities for quality improvement.", 
    "108": "HEDIS performance measures can be applied within the VA system, both as a means of quantifying performance and as a tool for improving the quality of care. Adopting HEDIS measures would provide additional value to VA medical centers by allowing them to compare their performance with that of private-sector providers.", 
    "109": "It has been reported that beta-adrenergic receptors are localized in the corneal endothelial cells. In this study, the change of cellular signal transduction, such as intracellular calcium and cAMP, was determined with pure adrenergic agonists and commercial antiglaucoma adrenergic agents. The intracellular calcium of cultured porcine corneal endothelial cells was inhibited by 10 microM isoproterenol and norepinephrine, but enhanced by propranolol and 50 mM KCl. In the case of phenylephrine, calcium mobility did not alter significantly. Verapamil, at 10 microM, decreased intracellular calcium concentration. In the presence of isoproterenol, cellular cAMP concentration increased from 28.8 pmole/mg protein (1 microM) to 42.2 pmole/mg protein (100 microM) compared with control of 6.07 pmole/mg protein. Incubation with commercial adrenergic eye drops, such as betaxolol, caused the cAMP concentration to increase from 21.6 pmole/mg protein (0.0005%) to 39.1 pmole/mg protein (0.05%). Adding commercial levobunolol and timolol into cells caused cellular cAMP to increase from 14.3 pmole/mg protein (0.0005%) to 840.5 pmole/mg protein (0.05%) and from 115.2 pmole/mg protein (0.00025%) to 931.0 pmole/mg protein (0.025%), respectively. However, the preservative, benzalkonium chloride, increased cellular cAMP from 15.4 pmole/mg protein (0.00001 mg/ml) to 1087.4 pmole/mg protein (0.01 mg/ml). It is concluded that the intracellular calcium of corneal endothelium decreases when the cellular adrenergic receptor is activated by agonists. Benzalkonium chloride, due to its preservative in commercial antiglaucoma agents which increases cellular cAMP, may alter corneal endothelial physiology through long-term use.",

    "111": "The short duration of action and titratability of landiolol hydrochloride make it ideal for use in patients with a clinical need for beta-blockers.", 
    "112": "In a total of 31 examinations we infused the drug in 19 patients (mean age, 55 +/- 14 years). After the persistence of the tachyarrhythmias was confirmed, continuous infusion was started at rates of 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.08 mg/kg/min for 5 minutes (for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia) or 15 minutes (for ventricular premature complex). We analyzed the pharmacokinetics of 16 examinations. A one-compartment model provided a close fit for each blood concentration-time curve.", 
    "113": "The maximum blood concentrations obtained clearly showed the dose dependency and revealed very short half-lives (range, 2.3 to 4.0 minutes). Area under the blood concentration-time curves also increased, showing dose dependency. In paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, landiolol hydrochloride reduced the heart rate from 111 +/- 20 to 90 +/- 10/min. Sinus rhythm was restored, without any adverse effects, in three of five patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and one patient with ventricular tachycardia. There was no significant change in peripheral blood pressure.", 
    "114": "Landiolol hydrochloride has a shorter elimination half-life than any other beta-blocker, and it can be administered safely to patients with various tachyarrhythmias."
