To determine whether increased coronary vasomotor tone can be induced by beta-adrenergic blockade, we measured the changes in coronary vascular resistance (CVR) during cold pressor testing (CPT) in 15 patients, nine with severe CAD and six with normal left coronary anatomy, before and after i.v. propranolol (0.1 mg/kg). Coronary blood flow was measured by coronary sinus thermodilution. CVR was calculated as mean arterial pressure divided by coronary sinus blood flow. Heart rate was maintained constant at a paced subanginal rate of 95 +/- 5 beats/min. Before propranolol, CPT induced significant increases in coronary vascular resistance in patients with CAD (15.0 +/- 2.2%, p less than 0.02), but no increase in CVR in the normal patients. After propranolol, the CVR change during CPT was augmented for patients with CAD (29 +/- 6%, p less than 0.01) and for the normal population (9 +/- 5%, NS). The potentiated increase in CVR occurred without significant changes in resting CVR or in the magnitude of the hypertensive response to CPT. We conclude that beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol can potentiate coronary artery vasoconstriction in some patients with CAD, possibly mediated by unopposed alpha-adrenergic vasomotor tone. These changes may be important in patients in whom intense adrenergic stimulation may increase coronary artery tone and adversely influence the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.", 
    "1": "4 groups of male Wistar rats were studied: - normotensive control rats (4 animals) treated with s.c. water - normotensive rats (6 animals) treated with s.c. 5 mg/Kg Oxprenolol - hypertensive control rats (renal artery stenosis) (6 animals) treated with s.c. water - hypertensive rats (renal artery stenosis) (9 animals) treated with s.c. 5 mg/Kg Oxprenolol. The animals were treated and/or operated at six weeks of age and sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. Blood Pressure (BP), Heart Rate (HR), Ventricular Mass (VM) and Thickness of the Aortic Media (A Th) were determined. Oxprenolol did reduce HR but not BP in both normotensive and hypertensive rats: these animals showed a reduced A Th but not a reduced VM compared with untreated control rats. These results suggest a direct effect of Oxprenolol on A Th independently from BP values, but not on VM.", 
    "2": "Synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex incubated with 3H-S-adenosyl-L-methionine (3H-SAM) displayed an increase in chloroform- extractable tritium when norepinephrine was added to the reaction mixture. The products of this mixture were maximally generated from intact synaptosomes, only partially inhibited by propranolol, and not enhanced by exogenous phospholipids. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of these chloroform extracts in three solvent systems yielded large norepinephrine- stimulated peaks of radioactivity that did not consistently co-chromatograph with authentic methylated phospholipid standards: phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PME), phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (PDE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC). Further, attempts to identify these peaks of radioactivity using as standards several putative methylated products of varied chemical classes, failed to elucidate likely candidates. It appears that while norepinephrine markedly stimulates the amount of tritium extracted into the chloroform phase, careful and positive structural elucidation of formed products is required before it can be concluded that these are indeed methylated phospholipids.", 
    "3": "The beta-adrenergic antagonist, [3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H] DHA), binds to membranes prepared from the rat vas deferens in a specific and saturable manner. Scatchard and Hill plot analysis indicates a single class of binding sites with no evidence of cooperative interactions. The specific binding sites have a high affinity (Kd = 0.3 nM) and a maximal occupancy estimated to be 460 fmoles [3H]-DHA bound/g wet tissue weight. Beta-adrenergic agonists and/or antagonists inhibit [3H]-DHA binding to rat vas deferens membranes in a stereospecific manner and with a relative order of potency expected for beta-adrenergic receptors of the beta2 subtype. The receptor affinities of various beta-adrenergic antagonists in the rat vas deferens determined using inhibition of [3H]-DHA binding correlated with their receptor affinities determined physiologically using antagonism of isoproterenol-induced inhibition of neurogenic contractions in-vitro.", 
    "4": "The effect of early aggressive antihypertensive treatment on kidney function in diabetic nephropathy was studied prospectively in ten insulin-dependent diabetics (mean age 29 years). During the mean pretreatment period of 29 (range 23-38) months the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased significantly and the urinary albumin excretion rate and arterial blood pressure rose significantly. During the 39 month (range 28-48) period of antihypertensive treatment with metoprolol, hydralazine, and frusemide (furosemide) or thiazide, arterial blood pressure fell from 144/97 mm Hg (mean of all pretreatment values) to 128/84 mm Hg (mean of all post-treatment values), urinary albumin excretion from 977 micrograms/min to 433 micrograms/min, and GFR from 80 to 62 ml/min/1 . 73 m2. The rate of decline in GFR decreased from 0.91 ml/min/month before treatment to 0.39 ml/min/month (range 0.08 to 0.68 ml/min/month) during treatment.", 
    "5": "The adenylate cyclase-coupled beta 2-adrenergic receptor of the frog erythrocyte has served as a useful model system for elucidating the mechanisms of catecholamine-induced densensitization. In this system, it has been previously demonstrated that agonist-induced refractoriness is associated with sequestration of the beta-adrenergic receptors in vesicles away from the cell surface and from their effector unit, the adenylate cyclase system (Stadel, J.M., Strulovici, B., Nambi, P., Lavin, T.N., Briggs, M.M., Caron, M.G., and Lefkowitz, R.J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3032-3038). These internalized beta-adrenergic receptors appear to be structurally intact as assessed by photoaffinity labeling, but their functional status has previously been unknown. In the present studies, we sought to assess the functionality of the sequestered vesicular receptors by fusing them to Xenopus laevis erythrocytes. This cell is suitable for such studies, since it has almost no detectable beta-adrenergic receptor or catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase, but contains prostaglandin E1-stimulable adenylate cyclase. Fusion of beta-adrenergic receptor-containing vesicles from desensitized frog erythrocytes with X. laevis erythrocytes results in a 30-fold stimulation of the hybrid adenylate cyclase by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. This effect was entirely blocked by the beta-antagonist propranolol. The catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity established in the vesicle-Xenopus hybrids showed the characteristic agonist potency series of the donor frog erythrocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptor. Fusion of vesicles from desensitized frog erythrocytes in which the beta-adrenergic receptors had been inactivated with the group specific reagent dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or of vesicles derived from control frog erythrocytes, which contain low amounts of beta-adrenergic receptor, did not establish catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity in the hybrids. These data demonstrate that beta-adrenergic receptors internalized during desensitization retain their functionality when recoupled to an adenylate cyclase system from a different source. The functional uncoupling of these receptors during desensitization is thus more likely due to their sequestration away from the other components of the adenylate cyclase than to any alterations in the receptors themselves.", 
    "6": "Ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCE), a benzodiazepine antagonist, was found to increase basal levels of cyclic GMP in rat cerebellum. beta CCE also augmented the elevation of cyclic GMP concentrations induced by isoniazid, in contrast to diazepam which blocked this effect of isoniazid. Administration of beta CCE and diazepam together cancelled each other's effect on the elevation of cyclic GMP levels after isoniazid. Ro 15-1788, another potent benzodiazepine antagonist, was found to have virtually no effect on cyclic GMP levels in naive or isoniazid-treated rats. Ro 15-1788 antagonized diazepam's lowering of the elevation of cyclic GMP content of cerebellum after isoniazid. Ro 15-1788 also blocked the increase in cyclic GMP levels elicited by beta CCE, indicating that this effect of beta CCE involves its interaction at benzodiazepine receptors. Some pharmacological actions of beta CCE might be based on hindering GABA transmission.", 
    "7": "The effect of iv digoxin on normal sinus node function was studied after pharmacologic autonomic blockade (AB) in ten patients. Sinus cycle length (SCL), sinus node recovery time (SNRT) and sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) were determined before and after AB with propranolol (0.2 mg/kg body weight) and atropine sulfate (0.04 mg/kg body weight) iv, and 15 min, 30 min, and 45 min after 1 mg iv digoxin. AB resulted in a significant decrease (P less than 0.01) in SCL (916 +/- 158 to 716 +/- 120 ms), in SNRT (1,229 +/- 221 to 871 +/- 190 ms), and in SACT (79 +/- 34 to 44 +/- 10 ms). Fifteen minutes after iv digoxin there was no significant change observed in SCL (716 +/- 120 to 708 +/- 92 ms), in SNRT (871 +/- 190 to 864 +/- 148 ms), or in SACT (44 +/- 10 to 46 +/- 15 ms). Similar results were obtained 30 min after digoxin administration. It is concluded that a single therapeutic dose of digoxin has no direct effect on electrophysiologic parameters of normal intrinsic sinus node function.", 
    "8": "Intraperitoneal injection of chlorpromazine and imipramine increases mouse brain ornithine decarboxylase but decreases S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase activity. Maximal effect was obtained 6-8 hr after treatment at which time single dose of chlorpromazine (50 mg/kg) stimulated ornithine decarboxylase activity 7-fold and decreased S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity to 50% from the control level. Correspondingly, ornithine decarboxylase activity was 5.5 times higher than the control value and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity about 40% from that after imipramine injection (80 mg/kg). The possible dependence of the enzyme responses on adrenergic receptors was studied using alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, concurrently with chlorpromazine and imipramine. The stimulation of ornithine decarboxylase but not the inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase could be abolished by propranolol (10 mg/kg), whereas phentolamine (10 mg/kg) slightly increased ornithine decarboxylase activity even when given alone. This suggests that beta- but not alpha-adrenergic mediation is involved in the stimulation of mouse brain ornithine decarboxylase activity and that brain ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activities are independently regulated. When chlorpromazine and imipramine were tested in vitro, both of them turned out to have an inhibitory effect on S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. The former caused 50% inhibition at a concentration of 1 mM and the latter at 2 mM. Preliminary tests suggest that the type of inhibition is noncompetitive for both of them.", 
    "9": "The addition of an arrhythmogenic concentration of ouabain (1.37 X 10(-6) M) results in a number of physiological, biochemical, and ultrastructural changes in isolated perfused guinea pig (Langendorff) heart preparations. Chronologically the following alterations occurred: first, a transient rise in ventricular cyclic AMP followed by a reduction in ventricular ATP, relatively minor electrocardiograph abnormalities (e.g., occasional missed beats, transient episodes of tachycardia, and occasional premature ventricular contractions), and a significant decline in coronary flow. A short time later, preparations became tachycardic and within 10 min asystole supervened. Simultaneously with the occurrence of tachyarrhythmias, there was a significant increase in the release of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase into the coronary effluent. Ultrastructural analysis of the ventricular endocardium revealed marked alterations in the mitochondria, disappearance of cytosolic glycogen granules, and chromatin clumping in the nuclei. Pretreatment with d,l-propranolol (3.38 X 10(-6) M) 15 min before ouabain abolished alterations caused by ouabain alone. Studies where ouabain-treated hearts were paced or coronary flow maintained suggest that changes in neither heart rate nor coronary flow are responsible for the protective action of propranolol. Results obtained indicate that ouabain-induced toxicity may in part result from an increase in coronary resistance producing myocardial hypoxia, cell damage, and arrhythmias. Preliminary studies suggest that the membrane-stabilizing action of propranolol appears to be the basis of its protective effect.", 
    "10": "In 210 newly detected untreated diabetics of type IIA or B from 4 districts of the county of Neubrandenburg who were admitted to hospital in 1982 their behaviour in taking medicaments was analysed. Cardiac remedies strictly speaking and in the wider sense were classified into the drug groups cardiac remedies (glycosides), antihypertensive agents, beta-receptor blockers, other coronary therapeutic agents and diuretics. At the same time the prevalence of the cardiovascular risk signs overweight (75.7%), hypertension (69.1%), hypertriglyceridaemia (54.8%), hypercholesterolaemia (43.3%), hyperuricaemia (21.0%) and inhalation of cigarette smoke (greater than or equal to 5 cigarettes a day: 12.9%) was established. The proportion of obese persons diminished with growing age, also the percentage of smokers was in the same proportion. In the inverse ratio to this the proportion of diabetics with hyperuricaemia increased according to age. 62.9% of the newly detected diabetics were treated with cardiac glycosides and 49.1% with antihypertensive agents. Only every 4th to 5th patient did not receive a medicament from the drug groups investigated. With the exception of the cardiac remedies in all other groups of substances the proportion of patients treated increased with the enlarging number of cardiovascular risk signs.", 
    "11": "The questions raised are: what is the physiological or pharmacological basis for the differentiation into beta 1- and beta 2-, and alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors?; and do the neurotransmitter norepinephrine and the hormone epinephrine differ in their receptors? On the basis of a preference of beta 2- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors for epinephrine, the hormone, and of beta 1-and alpha 1-receptors for norepinephrine, the neurotransmitter, it was postulated that the alpha 2- and beta 2-receptors are predominantly epinephrinergic in nature and located extrajunctionally and presynaptically whereas the alpha 1- and beta 1-receptors are predominantly norepinephrinergic in nature and located postsynaptically in the sympathetic terminal junction. The alpha 2- and beta 2-character of the presynaptic receptors matches that of the corresponding extrajunctional receptors. This indicates that a circulating catecholamine, namely epinephrine, is involved in the regulation of adrenergic transmitter release.", 
    "12": "Early experiments with the calcium antagonist verapamil showed that it could inhibit the transsarcolemmal influx of calcium ions induced by isoproterenol in ventricular myocardium without inhibiting the effect of beta stimulation to increase tissue cyclic AMP. Current views of the effects of the beta-receptor-adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP system of the calcium channel suggest that both calcium antagonists and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists should inhibit transsarcolemmal calcium influx if calcium is the third messenger of beta-agonist catecholamines. When high concentrations of circulating catecholamines are added to normal isolated hearts, two of the effects include increased vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation and high rates of enzyme release. These effects are antagonized by beta-adrenoceptor inhibitors and by calcium antagonists, which suggests a classical second (cyclic AMP) and third (calcium) messenger effect. In the presence of coronary artery ligation, the ventricular fibrillation threshold falls and enzyme release is enhanced. Both effects are associated with an increased tissue cyclic AMP level in the ischemic zone and are susceptible to calcium antagonist procedures. Neither effect can be fully stopped by beta-adrenoceptor antagonism. Therefore the evidence from this model with coronary artery ligation favors the views that 1) cyclic AMP accumulates in ischemic tissue by a process not fully susceptible to inhibition by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists; and 2) calcium ions are associated with the development of ventricular fibrillation and enzyme release by a process susceptible to inhibition by calcium antagonist agents such as verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem.", 
    "13": "Increasing the dose of a thiazide diuretic used alone in patients with essential hypertension has little further effect on blood pressure but increases the deleterious metabolic consequences of the diuretic. The effect of a beta-blocker on this flat dose response is not known. In two randomised crossover studies the effect of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide combined with 400 mg acebutolol was assessed. The mean fall in supine blood pressure was about 15% and was the same whatever dose of thiazide was used with the beta-blocker. As the dose of hydrochlorothiazide was increased, however, there was evidence of increasing metabolic consequences of the diuretic. The study did not define the minimum dose of diuretic, and doses of hydrochlorothiazide lower than 12.5 mg might be as effective. These results suggest that many patients who are being treated with a combination of a beta-blocker and a diuretic are receiving unnecessarily large amounts of the diuretic without benefit to their blood pressure and with adverse metabolic consequences.", 
    "14": "A rapid, sensitive method for the high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of propranolol in peritoneal dialysis fluid is described. An extraction step is replaced by the use of a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge for sample preparation. The procedure offers an acceptable alternative to sample extraction and will allow for pharmacokinetic studies of propranolol in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis for chronic renal failure.", 
    "15": "Several beta-blockers have now been shown to be effective in reducing total mortality during the extended recovery period after myocardial infarction. The rate of occurrence of reinfarction and sudden death is also reduced. While the exact mechanisms of this beneficial effect are unknown, it appears to result from a \"class\" effect, ie, secondary to beta-blockade, since neither cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, nor membrane-stabilizing activity appears to be requisite. The reduction in mortality is seen in all age groups, for all types of infarction, and in all risk groups. On the basis of presently available evidence, in patients without contraindication to beta-blockade, prophylactic treatment with beta-blockers should be initiated between one and four weeks after myocardial infarction. The dosage should be sufficient to blunt the heart rate response to exercise, and therapy should be continued for at least two years. The positive results of several well-designed and conducted studies have proved that the concept of secondary prevention is a valid one and should help to save thousands of lives in the coming decade. It is expected that ongoing investigations will determine the efficacy and safety of earlier institution of beta-blockade, including IV administration in the peri-infarction period. The effectiveness of secondary prevention with other agents, including calcium channel blockers, antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, lipid-lowering drugs, antiarrhythmics, prostacyclin analogues, and thromboxane synthetase inhibitors, should be investigated further. Additional information is needed on the mechanisms by which beta-blockers reduce mortality, sudden death, and reinfarction, on whether specific beta-blockers and/or specific types of beta-blockers have the greatest benefit, and, as a result of further analysis from some of the studies already published, the effect of beta-blockade after myocardial infarction on angina, rhythm disturbances, lipid profile abnormalities, and the quality of life.", 
    "16": "Administration of the combination of antidepressant and neuroleptic drugs has been reported to have a synergistic effect in the treatment of delusional depression. The effects of chronic coadministration of imipramine (IMIP) and chlorpromazine (CPZ) on beta-adrenergic and alpha 2-adrenergic binding sites in rat cerebral cortex were studied. The combination caused the same reduction in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors as IMIP alone. No changes in alpha 2-adrenergic receptors were observed with IMIP and/or CPZ.", 
    "17": "The effects of phenoxybenzamine an alpha-adrenergic blocker, propranolol a beta-adrenergic blocker, and diethyldithiocarbamate a noradrenaline synthesis inhibitor, on the LH increase induced by naloxone an opiate antagonist, was investigated in 25 day old female rats. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine or diethyldithiocarbamate suppressed the LH increase induced by naloxone, whereas pretreatment with propranolol had no significant effects on the naloxone-induced LH release. These results suggest that naloxone-induced increase in LH release is mediated via a noradrenergic mechanism.", 
    "18": "Recognition sites for the uptake of norepinephrine on adrenergic neurons in the brain and periphery were labeled with [3H]desipramine. The number of these uptake sites varied with the concentration of transmitter; depletion of norepinephrine with reserpine reduced the number of uptake sites, whereas increasing the concentration of norepinephrine induced by treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors raised the number of binding sites. These dynamic alterations in norepinephrine uptake recognition sites may regulate synaptic function homeostatically, providing less inactivation of reuptake when the synaptic concentration of the transmitter is low and increased inactivation when it is high.", 
    "19": "The ultrastructure of the left ventricular wall was studied in mice given intraperitoneal injections of propranolol (5 mg or 20 mg.kg-1 b.w. twice a day for 48 h with an additional dose 3 h before death), and in saline injected controls. Injections of propranolol increase the number of lipid droplets in areas of the myocardium. Fractional volume of lipid droplets in myocardial cells determined using quantitative stereological techniques, showed an increase of 280% and 544% in the group receiving the lowest and highest doses respectively. Injections of propranolol were also followed by an increased granularity of the mitochondria.", 
    "20": "Intracerebroventricular administration of prototype non-peptide opioid receptor (mu, kappa, sigma) agonists, morphine, ketocyclazocine and N-allyl normetazocine (SKF 10,047) and an agonist at both kappa and sigma receptors, pentazocine, induced hyperthermia in guinea-pigs. Similar administration of peptide opioids like beta-endorphin (BE), methionine enkephalin (Met-E), leucine enkephalin (Leu-E) and their synthetic analogues D-ala2-methionine-enkephalinamide (D-ala2-Met-E) and D-ala2-leucine-enkephalinamide (D-ala2-Leu-E) also caused hyperthermia. Of the three anion transport systems (iodide, hippurate and liver-like) present in the choroid plexus, only the liver-like transport system seems to be important to central inactivation of beta-endorphin, D-ala2-Met-enkephalin and D-ala2-Leu-enkephalin since iodipamide (an inhibitor of the liver-like transport system) augmented the hyperthermia. Prostaglandins (PG) and norepinephrine (NE) were not involved in peptide- and non-peptide opioid-induced hyperthermia because a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, indomethacin, and an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker, phenoxybenzamine, had no thermolytic effect. Likewise cAMP was not required since a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline, did not accentuate the hyperthermia due to administration of peptide and non-peptide opioids. Naloxone-sensitive receptors were involved in the induction of hyperthermia by morphine and beta-endorphin since naloxone attenuated the effect. In contrast, the hyperthermic responses to ketocyclazocine, SKF 10,047, pentazocine, Met-enkephalin, Leu-enkephalin, D-ala2-Met-enkephalin and D-ala2-Leu-enkephalin were not antagonized by naloxone. Lack of antagonism of naloxone on pyrogen, arachidonic acid, PGE2, dibutyryl cAMP and NE-induced hyperthermia indicates that endogenous opioid peptides are not likely to be central mediators of the hyperthermia induced by these agents.", 
    "21": "A method for studying the acute phase of myocardial infarction in conscious rats has been developed. In preliminary surgery, a loose ligature of atraumatic silk was understitched around the left coronary artery. Its ends were pulled through a polyethylene tube placed within the thorax and fixed under the skin. Seven days later, coronary occlusion was performed by tightening the ligature in conscious animal. Lidocaine and pindolol pretreatment increased the survival rate and attenuated the life-threatening arrhythmias during the first 20 min, but did not influence the infarct size 16 hrs later. An ex vivo perfusion technique for determining the ischemic area has also been developed. 3, 6, and 20 min after coronary ligation, the hearts were excised and perfused with 4% formaldehyde. The ischemic area could not be perfused and remained dark red with a sharp border-line. At the 3rd and 20th min its size was as same as that of the 16-hr infarcted area; however at the 6th min it increased by 50%. Lidocaine and pindolol eliminated this transitory increase. These methods appear to be valuable for large-scale determination of drug effects on the acute phase of experimental myocardial infarction in conscious rats, and for estimating their action on the size of ischemic area very early after coronary occlusion.", 
    "22": "The potential of several classes of antihypertensive drugs to cause orthostatic hypotension in man was evaluated in a conscious cynomolgus monkey model. Supine and erect blood pressure and heart rate were continuously monitored before and after administration of chlorisondamine (a ganglionic blocking agent); phentolamine and prazosin (alpha-adrenergic blocking agents); propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocking agent); and minoxidil (a vasodilator). Substantial validation of the model was accomplished when it was observed that these drugs evoked cardiovascular responses in the animal model which were similar to those which had been described in the clinical literature.", 
    "23": "A hyperventilation test, rationed with respect to respiratory rate and duration, was performed in 140 athletes under electrocardiographic control. During the test, one athlete developed an episode of sino-auricular block, and four showed a temporary second-degree Wenkebach--Samoilov A--V block. In three of those, resting ECG demonstrated decelerated atrioventricular conductivity which was combined with signs of myocardial dystrophy in two cases and with periodically recorded coronary sinus rhythm in one. Two athletes were under long-term dispensary observation. When repeated tests were negative, the block developed in response to hyperventilation preceded by obsidan administration.", 
    "24": "A preliminary pharmacological desympathization (pirroxan, obzidan, ornid) decreased blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and increased total vascular resistance in immobilized rats. The fraction of cardiac output decreased in lung (bronchial blood flow), liver and myocardium and increased in other organs and tissues. Relative blood supply increased in expansive regions of the skin, muscles and splanchnic organs but decreased in the liver. Opposite changes of transcapillary permeability were found in vascular regions of the skin and skeletal muscles as well as in splanchnic organs.", 
    "25": "Propranolol 40 mg was compared with a matched placebo tablet in its effect on the performance of anxious and non-anxious human volunteers. Subjects were required to give a brief speech, which was video-taped and later rated by trained observers for signs of anxiety; propranolol clearly reduced rated anxiety in the non-verbal behaviour of anxious subjects, as well as the anxiety observed in the speech of the anxious compared to the non-anxious. It also affected self-reported anxiety in the anxious, and reduced the pulse rate of anxious and non-anxious alike. Subjects were also prompted, by being given the first letter, to recall both difficult and easy words, drawn from selected verbal categories; propranolol impaired recall of difficult items in the memory of anxious subjects. Results were interpreted as showing a central as well as peripheral role for propranolol in blocking adrenergic receptors' activity in anxiety.", 
    "26": "A 10 min ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in anaesthetized pigs resulted in ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 70% of control and propranolol-treated animals. Felodipine (10 nmol kg-1) not only reduced ventricular ectopic activity by 90%, but also completely abolished VF. When a second occlusion was applied after 20 min of reperfusion, felodipine was less effective against VF, possibly due to decreasing felodipine concentrations or only a transient increase in VF threshold.", 
    "27": "A simple, rapid, and specific procedure was used for the analysis of propranolol in pharmaceutical formulations. The procedure consisted of dissolving (diluting) appropriate quantities of preparations and standards in (with) a 2 M potassium iodide-ethanol-water solution, spotting 5 microliter of each resultant solution onto filter paper disks, determining the phosphorescence intensities at room temperature, and comparing sample signal levels with those of standards. The results indicated that room temperature phosphorescence can be easily applied to the analysis of pharmaceutical formulations where active ingredients are generally contained in a wide variety of matrices.", 
    "28": "Ventilation, heart rate, and arterial blood gas tensions were measured at rest and during incremental exercise in 10 patients with emphysema after intravenous placebo or 7 mg metoprolol. Metoprolol reduced heart rate by 14% (P less than 0.001) and ventilation by 11% (P less than 0.01), but there was no significant difference in arterial O2 or CO2 tension (Pao2 and PaCO2, respectively). Metoprolol increased the time to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer (P less than 0.05) but did not improve the 12-min walking distance. A double-blind randomized crossover comparison of 4 wk treatment with atenolol (100 mg/day), metoprolol (100 mg/day), or matched placebo was performed in 12 patients with emphysema. Both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists reduced resting heart rate by 33% (P less than 0.001) and resting minute ventilation by 11% (P less than 0.025). There was no change in resting or exercise Pao2 or Paco2. During steady-state exercise on a cycle ergometer, atenolol and metoprolol reduced ventilation by 14 and 4%, respectively. This was accompanied by 11 and 5% reductions in O2 consumption (P less than 0.05) and 13 and 6% falls in CO2 production (P less than 0.05). There were no significant changes in tests of exercise tolerance, but forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity were reduced during beta 1-adrenergic blockade. beta 1-Blocking drugs reduce hyperventilation in emphysema by reducing pulmonary gas exchange without a change in arterial blood gas tensions. Increased airflow obstruction prevents this reduction being of therapeutic value.", 
    "29": "Ferguson (1975) calculated that if 5 per cent of the estimated 20 million patients with hypertension in the USA had a secondary cause, the cost of their investigation would amount to $2 billion at 1975 prices. For the majority of patients a careful clinical appraisal together with simple biochemical screening tests and a baseline ECG and chest film are adequate before embarking on therapy. For those patients in whom there are clinical or other grounds to suspect a treatable secondary cause, a wide range of modern investigative techniques are available. Even if there are no clues to a secondary cause initially, the possibility of such a cause is occasionally suggested by failure of response to triple therapy with, for example, a thiazide, a beta blocker, and a vasodilator. Whether the hypertensives are being treated in general practice or in hospital, a careful initial assessment together with regular supervision is essential to allow the identification of those with potentially curable disease.", 
    "30": "1 The effects of atenolol (100 mg), a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, and labetalol (300 mg), a combined alpha- and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent given in single doses were examined in a double-blind placebo controlled study in 11 asthmatic patients with hypertension. Changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were measured. 2 There were no significant differences between the effects of the active drugs, approximately half the patients having higher FEV1 values during each of the two active treatments. When compared with placebo, labetalol significantly reduced the effect of inhaled salbutamol on FEV1. 3 Whilst beta-adrenoceptor blockings drugs cannot be recommended in patients with airways obstruction, should they inadvertantly be given, labetalol like atenolol may be considered relatively safer then pure non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs.", 
    "31": "1 The effects on heart rate and blood pressure after single and multiple dosing (1 month) of a long acting formulation of propranolol 160 mg daily, and conventional propranolol, 80 mg twice daily, or 160 mg daily were compared in 11 moderately hypertensive subjects previously shown to respond to propranolol. 2 After acute dosing all three treatments produced significant reduction in blood pressure. After multiple dosing all three treatments maintained significant reductions in lying, standing and exercise heart rate and blood pressure throughout the 24 h. At 24 h, after multiple dosing, the fall in resting and standing systolic BP was significantly greater with LA propranolol than with conventional propranolol 80 mg twice daily or conventional propranolol 160 mg once daily (P at least less than 0.05). 3 The plasma propranolol concentration time curve after LA propranolol showed slowed absorption, and the area under the curve was significantly lower than after conventional propranolol (acute dosing; LA propranolol 160 mg 560 mg ml-1 h, conventional propranolol 80 mg twice daily 1135 mg ml-1 h, conventional propranolol 160 mg daily 1414 mg ml-1 h).", 
    "32": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether left ventricular receptor stimulation attenuates the arterial baroreflex control of heart rate in the conscious dog and to determine the role of cardiac efferent sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways in any interaction observed. Mean arterial blood pressure-heart rate function curves, which characterized arterial baroreflex control of heart rate, were constructed before (control) and during an infusion of veratrine into the left circumflex coronary artery. Peak sensitivity, the maximum absolute slope along the mean arterial blood pressure-heart rate curve, and heart rate range (maximum minus minimum heart rate) were reduced during intracoronary infusion of veratrine. The mean arterial blood pressure-heart rate relationship also was shifted to a lower pressure during intracoronary infusion of veratrine. In order to study the role of cardiac efferents in this interaction, we constructed mean arterial blood-pressure-heart rate curves during cholinergic blockade, cholinergic blockade plus intracoronary infusion of veratrine, beta 1-adrenergic blockade, and beta 1-adrenergic blockade plus intracoronary infusion of veratrine. The addition of intracoronary infusion of veratrine during cholinergic blockade produced a shift of the mean arterial blood pressure-heart rate curve down the ordinate axis (heart rate) and to a lower pressure; however, peak sensitivity and heart rate range remained unchanged. The addition of intracoronary infusion of veratrine during beta 1-adrenergic blockade resulted in reductions in peak sensitivity and heart rate range. These data indicate that left ventricular receptor stimulation attenuates arterial baroreflex control of heart rate and that the reduction of sensitivity and heart rate range is mediated by parasympathetic motoneurons common to both reflex arcs. On the other hand, resetting to a lower operational set point may be mediated by cardiac sympathetic motoneurons common to both reflex arcs.", 
    "33": "In the adult rabbit, both myelinated and nonmyelinated efferent fibers travel from the cervical vagus nerve to the sinoauricular node. The myelinated fibers convey the negative chronotropic effect. The influence of the nonmyelinated fibers was studied. Stimulation (4/sec) of the myelinated fibers, while the compound action potential was monitored continuously, caused a slowing of the heart rate. Subsequent activation of the non-myelinated fibers attenuated this negative chronotropic effect. Stimulation of adrenergic fibers was excluded, based on data from histochemical studies and the effects of blockade of beta- and muscarinic receptors. The lengthening of the RR interval during activation of the myelinated fibers alone was about 3.5 times larger than during activation of all fiber groups. When the conduction of the myelinated fibers was blocked (anodal block), activation of the nonmyelinated fibers did not show any effect on heart rate. It was concluded that the negative chronotropic effect is conducted via small myelinated fibers and that the nonmyelinated fibers modulate the effect of these cardiomotor fibers, without having an effect on heart rate on their own. This modulation is effected either via a presynaptic mechanism on preganglionic fibers or via an interaction with postganglionic neurons. The nonmyelinated fibers constitute a novel peripheral system to modulate heart rate.", 
    "34": "The availability of pharmacologic agents has contributed to a reduction in the morbidity and mortality of hypertensive cardiovascular disease. However, antihypertensive agents are associated with changes that may adversely affect patients receiving therapy. Nutritional and metabolic consequences of antihypertensive therapy may be associated with enhanced atherosclerosis. The abnormalities in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate tolerance, and changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis are reviewed. The mechanisms by which antihypertensive therapy causes these complications are unknown and their exact role in hypertensive cardiovascular disease remains to be elucidated. Appropriate selection of therapeutic agents and dietary manipulations may minimize the metabolic and nutritional consequences of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "35": "Applying the basic principles, therapy guides to our hypothetical cases can be constructed. The 60 year old man with postoperative abdominal perineal resection with hypertension and parkinsonism may well need a transurethral resection of the prostate; however, other options include decreasing his anticholinergic-type medications, such as antiparkinsonism medications, changing his hypertensive therapy from beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol to alpha blockers such as methyldopa and prazosin. Bethanacol would seldom be helpful alone, but with an alpha blocker could help if not contraindicated by the presence of vascular disease. The second example, a 45 year old woman with stress incontinence, may be assisted with improved storage by an anticholinergic agent, an alpha enhancer, a mucosal enhancer, and if pertinent, switching hypertensive therapy from an alpha blocker to a beta blocker. The last example, a T10 paraplegic with a spastic, hyperreflexic bladder, can have improved storage with anticholinergics, decreased sphincter tone with alpha blockers, as well as decreased sphincter tone with alpha blockers, as well as decreased spasms through suppression of hyperactive spinal cord activity with baclofen.", 
    "36": "The antiarrhythmic efficacy of oral acebutolol, a new cardioselective beta-blocking agent, was assessed in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Twenty-five patients with greater than or equal to 30 ventricular ectopic beats (VEB) per hour on three control ambulatory monitorings were studied. Mean VEB reduction from the control period was 35% with placebo and 45% and 50% with the use of acebutolol 200 mg and 400 mg, respectively. Eleven patients had greater than or equal to 70% reduction in VEB with acebutolol and nine of them had greater than or equal to 90 VEB reduction. Among these 11 patients, the mean VEB suppression was 51% after placebo but significantly higher following the two doses of acebutolol at 71% (p less than 0.05) and 86% (p less than 0.01). The mean reduction of paired VEB compared to placebo was 71% (p less than 0.05) and 75% (p less than 0.01) following 200 mg and 400 mg of acebutolol and only 49% after placebo. Complete suppression of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia was also noted in five patients. Mean PR interval only increased slightly when patients took 400 mg of acebutolol, but there was no significant change in either the QRS or QTc intervals. A significant decrease in heart rate from that during control periods was noted after acebutolol. No significant adverse reactions were noted during the study. Acebutolol appears to be an effective and well-tolerated antiarrhythmic agent in the treatment of VEB and higher grades of ventricular ectopy.", 
    "37": "The effects of 14 days of daily intraperitoneal injections of prazosin hydrochloride (3.0 or 0.3 mg/kg) or propranolol (5 mg/kg) on various aspects of the lipid metabolism of normal rats was studied. The results indicate that plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were lower and the ratio of plasma HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol concentration higher in prazosin-treated rats compared with propranolol-treated rats. The decline in plasma triglyceride levels in prazosin-treated rats was associated with a commensurate reduction in triglyceride secretion rates. Plasma free fatty acid levels were also lower in prazosin-treated rats, and this change may have contributed to the fall in triglyceride secretion rates. These data demonstrate that the disparate effects of alpha and beta receptor antagonists, previously shown to occur in hypertensive humans, can be duplicated in normal rats.", 
    "38": "Pindolol, a well-tolerated noncardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug, effectively reduced blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate hypertension without causing orthostatic hypotension. In common with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, pindolol blocked the normal increase in the standing pulse rate. The drug, however, did not decrease the supine pulse rate, a feature that can be interpreted as evidence of the postulated intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of pindolol.", 
    "39": "The effect of diltiazem on the contractile and vascular responses to 2 min of total occlusion and reperfusion was investigated in isolated blood-perfused canine papillary muscle preparations. Diltiazem, in doses (3 and 10 micrograms/min) that increased coronary blood flow but did not change developed tension and maximum rate of tension development (dT/dt) in papillary muscle before occlusion, attenuated tension development between 40 and 120 sec of ischemia. At-60 sec postocclusion, developed tension was at 36 +/- 4, 37 +/- 5 and 44 +/- 4% below preocclusion levels for 3, 10 and 100 micrograms/min of diltiazem, respectively (nondiltiazem treated = 24 +/- 3%). The dT/dt increased to 22 +/- 6% above preocclusion value during ischemia in nondiltiazem-treated preparations. This was blocked by diltiazem in a dose-dependent fashion. Propranolol and nitroprusside did not modify the developed tension and the increase in dT/dt of the papillary muscle during occlusion. On reperfusion, an overshoot in developed tension to 22 +/- 4% above preocclusion level was observed. This was significantly reduced by diltiazem and propranolol but not by nitroprusside. Diltiazem inhibited the maximal peak reactive hyperemia response after 2 min of occlusion by 30 to 38%. Both propranolol and nitroprusside did not change this response. The results show that diltiazem selectively depresses the inotropic state of the ischemic myocardium and suggest that a diltiazem-induced reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption during ischemia may contribute to the protection of ischemic myocardium and the reduction in reactive hypermia response in the ischemic heart.", 
    "40": "Intracranial pressure (ICP) was increased by hyperosmolar intracerebral infusion in dogs and the cardiopulmonary and catecholamine (CA) responses followed for 4 h. Increased ICP evoked persistent increases in endogenous CAs, pulmonary vascular pressures, pulmonary blood volume, and venous admixture. Other dogs similarly monitored were treated with a beta-blocking dose of propranolol 25 min after the onset of increased ICP. Although catecholamines were increased, elevated pulmonary pressures and venous admixture returned to control levels. CO and heart rate (HR) were reduced after beta blockade but systemic vascular resistance increased. It was concluded that increased ICP induces sustained increases in CAs which adversely affect pulmonary pressures and shunting. Selective beta blockade reverses these effects and may be useful in patients with evidence of sympathetic overactivity and progressive hypoxemia after head injury.", 
    "41": "The effects of thyrotoxicosis on Liver blood flow and propranolol disposition were followed in five patients while thyrotoxic and when euthyroid. Propranolol was taken orally to achieve steady state and then radiolabeled drug was given simultaneously by intravenous injection. Thyrotoxicosis was associated with doubling of both oral and systemic clearances of unbound propranolol, which resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in blood concentrations after oral doses. These changes were attributable to increases in hepatic blood flow and drug-metabolizing activity of the liver. The propranolol elimination t 1/2 was not affected by thyrotoxicosis since the enhanced clearance was offset by a change in volume of distribution. These findings may explain the reduction of plasma propranolol concentration and many of the therapeutic failures reported in the treatment of thyrotoxicosis. The dose required to achieve therapeutic blood concentrations of propranolol in thyrotoxic patients is variable and will usually be substantially larger than that required for euthyroid patients.", 
    "42": "This study was carried out to assess whether nadolol undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Eight healthy subjects received 80 mg nadolol orally on three occasions at least 2 wk apart. The first experiment was a control. The second consisted of nadolol followed in 3 hr by 3 gm activated charcoal given over a 9-hr period. In the third, the subjects received 0.5 gm erythromycin base and 0.5 gm neomycin four times a day orally for 2 days before nadolol. After the activated charcoal, the nadolol AUC fell from 2455 +/- 155 to 1355 +/- 123 ng . hr/ml (mean +/- SE), as did the percentage nadolol recovered in urine (15.4 +/- 1.4 to 10.2 +/- 0.7%) and the nadolol t1/2 (17.3 +/- 1.7 to 11.8 +/- 1.6 hr). These data suggest that nonrenal elimination increased. After the antibiotics, nadolol AUC was constant, percentage of nadolol recovered in urine fell to 12.7 +/- 1.7%, nadolol t1/2 fell to 11.6 +/- 1.3 hr, and mean peak nadolol concentration rose from 146 +/- 15 to 397 +/- 52 ng/ml. These results suggest that there is an enterohepatic circulation for nadolol, that activated charcoal may decrease nadolol bioavailability, and that antibiotics may increase the nadolol effect.", 
    "43": "Labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonist, was assessed for antiarrhythmic activity in the isolated perfused rat heart. Inclusion of 5.0 and 7.5 mumol/liter labetalol in the perfusate reduced the fall in ventricular fibrillation threshold and eliminated ventricular arrhythmias during the coronary occlusion period of 15 minutes. In treated hearts, levels of high energy phosphates were significantly higher and lactate, adenosine and hypoxanthine levels were lower in ischemic myocardium. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels were reduced in uninvolved myocardium (0.31 +/- 0.01 and 0.24 +/- 0.02 versus 0.43 +/- 0.02 nmol/g fresh weight) and in the ischemic myocardium (0.38 +/- 0.02 and 0.34 +/- 0.04 versus 0.65 +/- 0.05 nmol/g) in hearts treated respectively with 5.0 and 7.5 mumol/liter labetalol versus control hearts. When untreated hearts were perfused with 3.0 mmol/liter potassium in perfusate, all had ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation during coronary ligation and developed ventricular fibrillation after reperfusion. Labetalol, 5.0 mumol/liter, reduced ventricular tachyarrhythmias during coronary occlusion and after reperfusion, whereas labetalol, 7.5 mumol/liter, eliminated tachyarrhythmias during occlusion and reperfusion. Labetalol had potent antiarrhythmic activity in the hearts rendered uniformly prone to arrhythmias by perfusion with a low potassium solution.", 
    "44": "The contractile or relaxant activities or both of aqueous extracts of green and roasted coffees were assayed on isolated guinea pig tracheal spirals. Contractile and relaxant activities were compared with histamine and theophylline, respectively. Green coffee extracts induced concentration dependent contraction, but the maximal tension never exceeded 76.3% +/- 5.2 of a maximal histamine contraction (0.69 +/- 0.07 g/mm2 v 0.52 +/- 0.05 g/mm2; p (0.01). One gram of green coffee dust had a biological activity equivalent to 1.23 +/- 0.1 mg of histamine. The pD2 value of histamine was -5.17 +/- 0.05. The potency of green coffee was unaffected by mepyramine maleate (1 micrograms/ml, final bath concentration) while that of histamine was reduced 500 fold. Tissues contracted with histamine were not significantly relaxed by green coffee extracts. By contrast, roasted coffee extracts induced concentration dependent relaxation of uncontracted and histamine contracted tissues. Tissues contracted with green coffee extracts were also completely relaxed by roasted coffee extracts. The pD2 value of theophylline was -4.10 +/- 0.03. The relaxant activity of 1 g of roasted coffee was equivalent to 1.95 +/- 0.16 mg of theophylline. The potency of these extracts was significantly reduced after propranolol (1 micrograms/ml; dose ratio 1.56). Our results show that coffee dust extracts have considerable biological activity which changes from a contractile to a relaxant action as a consequence of processing. The greater incidence of adverse reactions to green coffee dust(s) in coffee workers may be related to the contractile activity present in green coffee dust.", 
    "45": "It has been found in experiments on rats trained to avoid electric stimulation of the foots by pressing the pedal that previous immobilization and administration of adrenaline and isoprenaline (but not noradrenaline) disturbs the accuracy of the realization of motor components of operant behavior. The total beta-adrenoblockers (but not phentolamine and cardioselective beta 1-adrenoblockers) given in doses which do not cause any central effects reduced the negative action of emotional stress. It is inferred that activation of beta 2-adrenoreceptors of skeletal muscles is likely to play a role in the genesis of disturbed motor skill under emotional stress.", 
    "46": "Fourteen hypertensive men underwent assessment of renal function and body fluid composition following short-term (three to six weeks), long-term (five to six months), and withdrawal (two weeks) of propranolol hydrochloride monotherapy for the treatment of hypertension. Results indicate that propranolol had little effect on glomerular filtration rate (less than 10% decrease); changes that did occur were directly correlated with changes in effective renal plasma flow. Propranolol therapy decreased effective renal plasma flow 14% and renal blood flow 15% during long-term therapy; decreases in renal perfusion persisted following withdrawal of therapy. Propranolol therapy was neither antidiuretic nor antinatriuretic; propranolol had no effect on urine osmolality, free water clearance, sodium clearance, or fractional sodium excretion. Furthermore, propranolol therapy did not expand plasma volume, extracellular fluid volume, or total body water. Finally, propranolol therapy had no effect on the renal handling of potassium or on serum potassium concentration.", 
    "47": "The present experiments were designed to study the renal effects of propranolol and atenolol in rats. Wistar rats were anesthetized with urethane and continuously hydrated with saline solution. In one group of the rats, the drugs were injected into the jugular vein. In the other group of the rats, the drugs were injected into the abdominal aorta through a canula which was inserted from the left carotid artery into the aorta up to the middle between forking points of left and right renal arteries. Intravenous infusion of propranolol and atenolol increased urine volume (UV), urinary sodium excretion, urinary potassium excretion and urinary chloride excretion. Propranolol and atenolol, which were intraaortally injected, produced an increase in UV and sodium concentration in the urine, inducing a more marked increase in total sodium amount excreted from both kidneys by propranolol than by atenolol. However, the natriuretic response was far more marked in the left kidney than in the right kidney in the case of atenolol administration as compared to that in the case of propranolol. It was speculated, therefore, that the natriuresis induced by these drugs was the first pass effect on the rat kidneys. It was also noted that the first pass effect of atenolol on kidneys was more marked than that of propranolol.", 
    "48": "The haemodynamic effects of prenalterol, a new sympathomimetic agent, have been studied in anaesthetized open-chest pigs with acute myocardial ischaemia provoked by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. A group of eight animals was infused with saline and served as control (C). In both groups the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery determined a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction of aortic flow, maximum left ventricular (LV) dp/dt with no changes in heart rate. The infusion of a first dose of 30 micrograms/kg of prenalterol restored the depressed haemodynamics but increased significantly the heart rate in the prenalterol group while the saline infused group did not show any significant changes. The haemodynamic effects of prenalterol were still evident 25 min after the infusion. The subsequent administration of a second dose of 60 micrograms/kg of prenalterol resulted in a further improvement of the aortic flow, LV dp/dt and heart rate which reached values higher than in the basal condition. The positive inotropic effect was not associated with changes in stroke volume, therefore the increase in aortic flow was essentially due to an increase of the heart rate. It is concluded that prenalterol is a powerful inotropic agent in acutely infarcted animals. Its action on aortic flow appears to be related to an increase in heart rate in contrast to some previous observations.", 
    "49": "Influence of noradrenaline, or isoprenaline injected into the dorsal hippocampus on electroencephalogram and behavior of rabbit was studied. The injections increased the participation of slow waves and spindles in cortical EEG, suppressed hippocampal theta rhythm and blocked the spontaneous locomotor activity. The inhibitory effect of isoprenaline was reduced by intrahippocampal pretreatment with propranolol or sotalol; the beta-blockers injected intrahippocampal induced EEG arousal and behavioral excitation. These results indicate an inhibitory role of noradrenaline and isoprenaline in the hippocampus of rabbit.", 
    "50": "Sudden reperfusion of ischemic myocardium has been related to an extension of damage, due to sudden increases in transmembrane calcium fluxes. When the calcium slow channel blocker nifedipine (1 microgram kg-1 min-1 i.v.) was infused just prior to release of a 30 min partial obstruction of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in anesthetized pigs, recovery of regional function was better (75%) than in untreated animals (50%). The number of reperfusion arrhythmias was also significantly lower in the treated animals. In another series of experiments, ventricular fibrillation occurred in 80% of the untreated animals within 10 min after the complete acute occlusion of the LAD. Animals pretreated with propranolol (0.5 mg kg-1 i.v. bolus + infusion) or nifedipine (0.05 microgram kg-1 min-1 i.c.) showed a similar high incidence of ventricular fibrillation. However, when the administration of these drugs was combined, 60% of the animals survived three periods (10 min) of intermittent myocardial ischemia. When the continuous infusion of nifedipine was preceded by a bolus of 2.0 microgram kg-1, sufficient to abolish systolic wall thickening completely, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation was also reduced. Recovery of regional function was nearly complete in these animals.", 
    "51": "Massive overdosage of adrenergic blocking drugs is associated with severe morbidity and a high mortality rate. We report the case of a 24-year-old medical intern who ingested 9.6 g acebutolol, 7.2 g labetalol and 0.625 g trimipramine in an attempted suicide. Blood samples drawn on admission were shown to contain markedly elevated plasma levels of acebutolol and its major metabolite and of labetalol. The patient was deeply comatose on admission. The heart rate was 60 min-1 (sinus rhythm) and the blood pressure was clinically unrecordable. Atropine, isoproterenol and dopamine initially had no effect on either heart rate or blood pressure. Only following the administration of inordinately large doses of isoproterenol and dopamine, together with glucagon was a clinical response obtained. The patient remained haemodynamically dependent on dopamine for 12 h and isoproterenol for 65 h. The total dose of isoproterenol administered was 260 mg, two thirds of this during the first 12 h. The patient left hospital well after 7 days but was readmitted after 26 days because of intestinal obstruction due to ischemic bowel necrosis.", 
    "52": "The drug release from an ointment that contains dissolved drug depends on the kind of preparation and on the time of storage. This indicates a relationship between shear treatment (disruption of the gel matrix) and liberation rate. With increasing storage time of the ointment the liberation rate decreases due to the increasing diffusional resistance of the reforming gel matrix.", 
    "53": "Antiidiotype antibodies were raised against anti-catecholamine ligand antibodies. The antiidiotype response was shown to be cyclical and to correspond to the production of antibodies that could bind to catecholamine beta-adrenergic receptors and stimulate adenylate cyclase. Disappearance of these antibodies from the serum could be correlated with the appearance of a catecholamine ligand-binding activity corresponding to the synthesis of autologous anti-antiidiotype antibodies directed against the induced antiidiotypic molecules. Comparison of the injected versus the induced anti-ligand antibodies reveals striking differences in affinities but similarities in the ability to bind to the antiidiotype antibodies and to the ligand-containing affinity gel. The results support the existence of a functional network of idiotype antiidiotype interactions involving external as well as internal antigens, antibodies, and possibly other types of molecules involved in recognition phenomena, such as hormone receptors.", 
    "54": "1 Effects of 3,4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropoxy)-3-nitroxy-2H-1-benzopyran (K-351) and its derivative, 3,4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropoxy)-3-hydroxy-2H-1-benzopyran (K-351 (N-)) on the electrical and mechanical properties of smooth muscles of the dog coronary and mesenteric arteries were investigated, and the findings were compared with data obtained with nitroglycerin. 2 In both proximal and distal regions of the coronary arteries, K-351 and nitroglycerin reduced the resting tone and suppressed the contractions produced by high-potassium solution or by current passage to the same extent, with no remarkable change in the electrical properties of the smooth muscle membrane. 3 In the proximal regions of the descending coronary artery, low and high concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) produced relaxation and contraction of the muscle, respectively. In the distal region, NA consistently relaxed the muscle with concentrations up to 10(-5) M. In both regions, the contraction or relaxation was suppressed by phentolamine or propranolol, respectively. 4 K-351 suppressed the NA-induced contraction. K-351(N-) potentiated the NA-induced contraction and suppressed the relaxation, but these actions were weaker than those of propranolol. Nitroglycerin suppressed the NA-induced contraction and the potency was weaker than that of K-351. 5 In the mesenteric artery, K-351 depressed excitatory junction potentials, spikes and contractions evoked by perivascular nerve stimulation, while K-351(N-) potentiated or depressed mechanical responses, with no change in the electrical responses. Nitroglycerin also depressed the mechanical responses evoked by perivascular nerve stimulation with no change in the electrical responses. 6 These results suggest that K-351 has a blocking action on postjunctional adrenoceptors, and also dilator actions similar to the actions of nitroglycerin on the dog coronary artery, while K-351 (N-) possesses a weak beta-adrenoceptor blocking action.", 
    "55": "The effect of ouabain on the secretion of catecholamines from isolated bovine adrenal medullary cells was investigated. Ouabain enhances the basal rate of secretion approximately 2-fold, with half-maximal stimulation occurring at a glycoside concentration of around 5 X 10(-7) M. Parallel measurements of the release of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.17.1) (an enzyme associated with chromaffin granules) and lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) (which is confined to the cytosolic compartment) suggest that this increase in secretion occurs as a result of an enhanced rate of exocytosis rather than by any other route. The stimulatory effect of ouabain is dependent on extracellular sodium but is maintained in the nominal absence of calcium and is unaffected by changes in the major external anion. Neither tetrodotoxin nor phenoxybenzamine alters the response to glycoside treatment, but the calcium channel blocker methoxyverapamil reduces the catecholamine secretion evoked by ouabain in a dose-dependent fashion. This study serves to characterize the secretory action of ouabain in isolated chromaffin cells and to provide a foundation for the ion flux studies reported in the following paper.", 
    "56": "To determine whether the pulmonary vasodilation produced by isoproterenol is mediated solely by its beta adrenergic effects, we studied the hemodynamic responses to isoproterenol in three groups of dogs with pulmonary vasoconstriction produced by continuous ventilation with 10% oxygen: (a) hypoxia alone, (b) hypoxia and propranolol 0.3 mg/kg i.v. bolus followed by an infusion of 5 micrograms/kg per min, and (c) hypoxia after pretreatment with an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, either indomethacin or meclofenamate 5 mg/kg s.c. twice daily for 2 d prior to study. All groups had similar values for mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) during room air and hypoxic ventilation. Isoproterenol in doses of 0.0025, 0.005, and 0.05 micrograms/kg per min produced a dose-related decline in PAPm and PVR during hypoxia in group 1. Despite beta-blockade with propranolol (group 2), isoproterenol at all three doses significantly reduced PAPm and PVR. The responses to isoproterenol were comparable in the presence or absence of propranolol; at 0.05 micrograms/kg per min the effects of isoproterenol were blunted, but not abolished, by propranolol. Similar results were observed even when five times the dose of propranolol was given. Isoproterenol at all three doses had no effect, however, on PAPm and PVR in the cyclooxygenase inhibitor-pretreated group. These data suggest that the pulmonary vasodilator effects of isoproterenol are not mediated solely by pulmonary vascular beta adrenergic receptors, and that vasodilator prostaglandins may play a role in the responses to this drug.", 
    "57": "Two patients with bipolar affective disorder and a history of bronchospastic phenomena experienced tremor during lithium carbonate therapy. In both, metoprolol produced objective and subjective improvement of the tremor without producing bronchospasm. Objective improvement of tremor after use of metoprolol was documented by accelerometry. The authors discuss the implications of these findings.", 
    "58": "Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist with established anti-vasospastic action in man and, possibly cardioprotective effects during ischaemia. Although it is regularly used in the treatment of acute myocardial ischaemia, few double-blind randomized trials have been performed in this area. Recently, one trial was published which showed that nifedipine, when added to conventional treatment (beta-blockers, nitrates) of patients hospitalized for unstable angina pectoris (UAP) prevents recurrent ischaemia. Several further trials are known to be under way. The American nifedipine angina-myocardial infarction study (NAMIS) comprises sub-protocols both for patients diagnosed as UAP and patients diagnosed as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In the former, a comparison is made between a nifedipine and a propranolol based regimen. Recurrence of ischaemia is the end point. In the NAMIS-protocol for AMI; nifedipine is compared with placebo. Infarct-size and complications are the end points. The Holland Interuniversity Nifedipine/metoprolol Trial (HINT) is similar in design to the NAMIS UAP-study. However, it has a placebo group for comparison and also deals with the combination of nifedipine and beta-blockade. NAMIS and HINT may resolve several important questions in reference to the treatment of acute myocardial ischaemia but they are of insufficient size to study effects on total mortality. Finally, in the area of secondary prevention after MI, a major trial (secondary prevention reinfarction nifedipine trial: SPRINT) is known to be under way in Israel."
