    "0": "Some anti-arrhythmic agents which have a stabilising effect on the membrane, particularly those belonging to Group I of Vaughan William's classification, are likely to cause rythmic disturbances by a re-entry phenomenon (atrial flutter 1/1, premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, \"torsades de pointe\", even fatal ventricular fibrillation). The quinidines have been the most often condemned due to their effect on the action potential and on the speed of conduction. The fact that these re-entry phenomena are more frequent at therapeutic doses than at high or toxic doses suggests an individual susceptibility and the interaction of various predisposing factors: renal insufficiency, potassium depletion, pre-existing conduction disturbances, potentialsing drugs. In order to prevent these incidents it is advisable not to prescribe such anti-arrhythmic agents for susceptible patients, to control individual tolerance and to watch for the first ECG signs of conduction disturbances or of re-entry, such as premature contraction with fixed coupling. Treatment consists in an electrosystolic stimulus and the possible administration of potassium and bretylium.", 
    "1": "A beta-adrenergic blocking activity of perhexiline was compared with that of propanolol. In the Langendorff's preparation of rabbits, canine heart-lung preparations, open-chest dog preparations and hind-limbs of dogs, perhexiline failed to block isoproterenol-induced changes in cardiovascular functions, which were effectively blocked by propranolol. These data suggest that perhexiline is not a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent.", 
    "2": "The effect of beta-blockade by acebutolol on global and regional myocardial perfusion (133Xenon wash-out) was studied in 10 patients with coronary artery disease. Another group of 10 similar patients was used to study the effect of acebutolol on left ventricular cavity size (metal markers--spot film camera). Global perfusion responses roughly paralleled the changes in rate-pressure variable which decreased in 8 patients and increased in 2 who had spontaneous angina pectoris. Regional perfusion decreased more in areas distal to less than 75% stenoses than in those distal to less than 75% stenoses (29 vs 12%; p = 0.10 less than 0.20). Left ventricular asynergy did not modify the response, nor did the presence or absence of collateral vessels. No evidence was found to support the thesis that beta-blockade may evoke a redistribution in perfusion which favours the potentially ischaemic areas of myocardium. Left ventricular cavity size remained unchanged after acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-blocking compound with some degree of agonist activity.", 
    "3": "The antihypertensive effect of a new non-selective beta-adrenergic blocking compound, penbutolol (40 mg b.i.d.), was compared with propranolol (160 mg b.i.d.) in a series of 20 hypertensive patients using a double-blind cross-over scheme. Both compounds reduced both the supine and the standing blood pressure significantly. The magnitude of the responses did not differ significantly and both compounds evoked a commensurate decrease in heart rate. No significant side-effects were noted and a series of laboratory tests did not disclose any biochemical changes.", 
    "4": "The experiment is aimed at establishing the consequences of the endotoxic stress (TAB) associated with alpha- or beta-adrenergic selective blocking drugs on the course of the acute irradiation disease in rats (700R, gamma rad Co60). TAB administered before or after irradiation, alone or associated with propranolol, increases the surviving rate at 30 and 60 days from exposure as compared to the controls (LD 95/30 days). Generally, dibenzyline has unfavourable effects on mortality and survival rate at the mentioned intervals. Based on the data obtained, an adrenergic component is analysed in achieving the survival increase by TAB and beta-adrenergic blocking substances; a hypothesis about the mechanisms involved is advanced.", 
    "5": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blocking agents inderal, trazicor, visken, benzoral and aptin on the bronchial patency was studied by means of four ventilation indices in 85 patients, 62 of whome had various diseases of the lungs; 44 of these patients had bronchial obstruction. It was established that all beta-blocking agents are detrimental to bronchial patency in patients with concomitant bronchial obstruction. In exacerbation of bronchial asthma, beta-blocking agents are contraindictaed. When it is necessary to prescribe beta-blocking agents for other patients with concomitant bronchial obstruction visken is the drug of choice. It should be given per os, with preliminary control of the function of external respiration.", 
    "6": "The antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs has been documented in a number of papers [10--13] and over the last 10 yr beta-receptor blockade has become a more and more frequent primary therapy for hypertension. During this time, a number of different beta-blockers with various degrees of selectivity, potency and intrinsic sympathomimetic effect have come into use. There have also been attempts to reduce the number of daily doses in beta-adrenoceptor blocking therapy while maintaining the antihypertensive effect [5]. Pindolol (Visk\u00e9n) is a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic effect and is characterized by high potency and long duration.", 
    "7": "The concept that migraine results from an initial vasoconstriction due to increased release of noradrenaline from the sympathetic nerves to cranial blood vessels has been reappraised in the light of recently acquired knowledge of the mechanisms of action of drugs used in the treatment of migraine, physiological and pharmacological evidence implicating noradrenaline, and the observations by others that several migraine variants may be associated with some degree of sympathetic overactivity. If the theory is correct, it suggests that both prophylaxis and management of the acute condition should be possible by means of selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism. The use of drugs with potentially dangerous vasoconstrictor properties appears to be unnecessary. The suggestion is made that the increased adrenergic activity might result from changes within the hypothalamus.", 
    "8": "1 Labetalol (AH 5158A) inhibited the adrenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity of rat liver and heart. This drug had no effect on basal or guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-activated adenylate cyclase activities. 2 Labetalol displaced the binding of the specific ligands [3H]-dihydroergocryptine and (-)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol from their respective alpha and beta-adrenoceptors in rat heart and liver. The affinity of labetalol was 10 fold higher for the beta- than for the alpha-adrenoceptor. It appeared to be 10 to 100 times less potent than phentolamine in blocking alpha-adrenoceptors and 5 to 10 times less potent than propranolol in blocking beta-receptors. 3 It is concluded that labetalol exerts its dual alpha- and beta-antagonism by acting directly on the plasma membranes, where it binds competitively to alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "9": "1 Blood platelets from normal human volunteers were isolated and aggregated in vitro with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA), dopamine and N-dimethyldopamine (DMDA). 2 The effects of 5-HT antagonists, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, butyrophenones and chlorpromazine upon aggregation induced by the four amines were investigated. 3 Only the the 5-HT antagonists, chlorpromazine and spiroperidol were potent inhibitors of 5-HT-induced aggregation, and only phentolamine was a potent inhibitor of the catecholamine-induced aggregation. 4 Evidence was obtained for two populations of receptors, one for 5-HT and one for the three catecholamines.", 
    "10": "This paper reviews the role of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs in the treatment of hypertension. A significant proportion of patients presenting with mild or moderate hypertension will respond to general measures and do not require specific drug therapy. Of the remaining patients, some will respond to treatment with a thiazide diuretic alone, and those with severe grades of hypertension will require the addition of a beta-adrenergic blocking drug, occasionally together with a vasodilator. The advantages of beta-adrenergic lbocking drugs alone or in combination and the problems associated with therapy are discussed.", 
    "11": "Blood flow changes in response to various drugs in simulataneously autoperfused canine subcutaneous adipose tissue and gracilis muscle were compared to study the vascular beta-adrenoceptors. Compared to isoprenaline the beta 2-selective agonist salbutamol was 4--6 times more potent as a vasodilator in the muscle than in adipose tissue. Furthermore two beta 1-selective agonists (Tazolol and H80/62) caused vasodilatation in adipose tissue but not in the gracilis muscle. When given by close i.a. injection after beta-adrenoceptor blockade, adrenaline was a more potent vasoconstrictor than noradrenaline in both tissues. Before beta-blockade, however, noradrenaline was the more potent vasoconstrictor in the gracilis muscle whereas adrenaline was more potent in adipose tissue. Intravenous infusion of adrenaline in doses causing vasodilatation in the muscle caused vasoconstriction in adipose tissue whereas intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused vasoconstriction in both tissues. The present findings suggest that the beta-adrenoceptors mediating vasodilatation in skeletal muscle are mainly ose tissue. Since adrenaline is a much more potent beta2- than beta1-agonist, these differences point to different roles of intravascular adrenaline in the two sites. In skeletal muscle circulating adrenaline is mainly a vasodilator whereas in subcutaneous adipose tissue it mainly acts as a vasoconstrictor.", 
    "12": "The myocardial effects of increasing concentrations of ionic lithium were investigated in isolated, spontaneously beating rabbit hearts, which were retrogradely perfused with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution containing lithium in concentration of 1, 5 or 10 mM. The following functional parameters were continuously recorded: heart rate, amplitude and rate of contraction, coronary flow, myocardial oxygen consumption and ECG. The lowest concentration of 1 mM lithium did not cause any measurable changes in these parameters. A concentration of 5 mM lithium produced a rather slowly developed increase in amplitude and rate of contraction of about 22% without any concomitant increase of oxygen consumption. A delayed increase in the oxygen consumption of about 21%, but accompanied by a significant decrease in contractility however, occurred much later in the experiments, probably as an expression of a decrease in myocardial efficiency. The highest lithium concentration produced similar effects. None of the other parameters measured were markedly influenced by lithium. The positive inotropic effect of lithium on myocardial contractility was very convincingly verified in isolated electrically stimulated rabbit papillary muscles by isometric measurements of the maximum tension produced and the rate of its development. An inhibitory influence of lithium on the positive inotropic effect of increasing frequency of stimulation was observed. Adrenergic beta-receptor blockade did not abolish the positive inotropic effect of lithium. A possible causative influence of lithium on the cellular calcium metabolism is discussed.", 
    "13": "The effect of nifedipine (BAY 1040), a calcium-antagonistic inhibitor of the electromechanical coupling process was tested on atrioventricular conduction and refractoriness of the dog heart in situ by means of His-bundle electrography and programmed electrical stimulation. The animals were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. As the basic effects of the compound can be altered by release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerves of heart and vessels, the dogs were pretreated with acebutolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, which decreased heart rate and prolonged atrioventricular conduction and refractoriness. Nifedipine 1,6 and particularly 30 microgram/kg body weight increased the heart rate and decreased atrioventricular conduction time during atrial pacing, whereas atrioventricular conduction time during sinus rhythm and atrioventricular refractoriness were only affected by nifedipine 30 microgram/kg. In this respect, nifedipine differs distinctly from another calcium antagonistic compound, verapamil.", 
    "14": "If beta- and alpha-adrenergic inotropic effects are cyclic AMP dependent and cyclic AMP independent, respectively, they may be qualitatively different. The inotropic effects of beta-receptor stimulation (isoprenaline) and alpha-receptor stimulation (phenylephrine combined with propranolol) were characterized in isolated perfused rat hearts, rat atria and rat papillary muscles. The beta-effect reached its maximum before the alpha-effect. The alpha-effect followed a three-phasic time-course indicating both stimulatory and inhibitory components. The aortic pressure wave (perfused heart) indicated a shorter contraction phase after beta-stimulation than after alpha-stimulation. The time to peak tension (atrium, papillary muscle) was relatively shorter after isoprenaline than after alpha-stimulation, which tended to prolong it. The contraction-relaxation cycles (atrium, papillary muscle) were examined by recording the isometric tension (T), its first (T') and second (T'') deri derivatives. alpha and beta-stimulation both increased Tmax, T'max (maximal rate of tension rise), T'min (maximal rate of tension decline) and T''min (maximal rate of transition from rise to decline of tension). Isoprenaline increased T'min (papillary muscle) and T''min (atrium, papillary muscle) relatively more than did alpha-stimulation, i.e. the relaxing processes were activated relatively more by beta-stimulation. The results indicate different mechanisms for the two adrenergic inotropic effects. The relatively larger activation of relaxation by beta-stimulation is assumed to be caused by clic AMP.", 
    "15": "Trimepranol (TMP) is a new propranolol-like, non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drug. Its antihypertensive effect versus placebo was evaluated in a double-blind corss-over study in 25 ambulatory patients, whose supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) was at least 95 mm Hg. After four weeks treatment with placebo, the dose of TMP was titrated weekly until the supine diastolic BP was below 95 mm Hg or intolerable side effects occurred. The trimepranol dose thus determined was 10 mg bid for three patients, 20 mg bid for twelve patients and 40 mg bid for ten patients. The subsequent double-blind cross-over study consisted of two six weeks treatment periods, either with trimepranol followed by placebo (Group I) or in reverse order (Group II). BP and heart rate at the end of these periods were compared. Supine BP fell from 156 +/- 3/105 +/- 2 mm Hg at the end of placebo periods to 140 +/- 2/93 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) for systolic and diastolic BP at the end of trimepranol periods, when the data of Groups I and II are pooled. In 19 out of 25 patients, supine diastolic BP declined below 95 mmHg during the trimepranol period. A statistically significant correlation was found between the antihypertensive and bradycardic effects of trimepranol. Mild side effects occurred in the heart volumes of the patients. We conclude that bid trimepranol is an effective antihypertensive agent.", 
    "16": "Labetalol is an orally active adrenoceptor blocking drug which is a competitive antagonist at both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor sites. Its beta-blocking effects resemble those of propranolol, but its overall haemodynamic effects are akin to those of a comination of propranolol and an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs such as phenoxybenzamine. Unlike with conventional beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, acute administration of labetalol reduces peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure and has little effect on cardiac output. Theoretically, labetalol has advantages over beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs alone in the treatment of hypertension, but any real advantage, particulary in mild or moderate hypertension, has yet to be conclusively demonstrated in therapeutic trials. Labetalol may be particularly useful in some patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs alone or combined with a diuretic, but possibly at the expense of a postural hypotensive effect. Postural hypotension is the most troublesome side-effect, occasionally necessitating withdrawal of therapy, but severe side-effects such as are seen with effective antihypertensive dosages of phenoxybenzamine do not occur with labetalol.", 
    "17": "Surgical excision of the sinoatrial node, verified histologically, is followed by a supraventricular (atrial) rhythm in both resting and exercising dog whether anesthetized or conscious. The ECG is characterized by a definitive P wave and associated atrial electrograms. Waxing and waning in heart rate, generally referred to as sinus arrhythmia continues in the awake animal after complete excision of the SA node. This arrhythmia is responsive to both adrenergic and cholinergic interventions, thus indicating the presence of both sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation of subsidiary atrial pacemaking tissues.", 
    "18": "The present studies were performed in order to investigate the role of neurotransmitters, prostaglandins and glucose on [3H] uridine incorporation into total RNA in beef thyroid slices. Carbamylcholine strongly stimulated RNA labelling from [3H uridine; atropine abolished this effect. NaF, at 1 and 5 mM, progressively increased this parameter while norepinephrine caused a similar effect at 10(-3) but not at 10(-6) M. Phentolamine (1 mM) blocked the stimulatory action of TSH; propranolol and atropine did not. Glucose at concentrations between 4 and 24 mM caused a progressive increase in RNA labelling from [3H] uridine. This effect was inhibited by dinitrophenol. Prostaglandins (E1, A1, F1alpha and F2alpha) assayed in concentrations between 5 and 25 microgram/ml, with or without caffeine, had no effect on RNA labelling. Moreover, neither aspirin nor indomethacin inhibited TSH stimulation. Under similar experimental conditions, PGE1 did simulate PB125I formation.", 
    "19": "Malignant myeloid leukemic cells and normal macrophages and granulocytes have functional beta-adrenergic receptors, which have been quantitated by radioreceptor binding with the beta-adrenergic antagonist [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol and by induction of cyclic AMP by adrenergic hormones. Both the normal and leukemic cells have beta(2)-adrenergic receptors, and the [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding was saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The leukemic cells consisted of clones that could be induced to differentiate (MGI(+)D(+)) and clones that could not be induced to differentiate to mature macrophages and granulocytes by the protein inducer MGI. The different types of leukemic clones all had 1100-2300 receptor sites per cell, whereas normal macrophages had 7000 receptors per cell. The differentiation of MGI(+)D(+) leukemic cells was associated with an increase in receptors to a number similar to that found with normal macrophages. MGI(+)D(+) leukemic cells and normal macrophages were able to densensitize to the beta-adrenergic agonist (-)isoproterenol, shown by termination of cyclic AMP induction within 10-15 min and the lack of a second induction. The leukemic cells that could not be induced to differentiate lacked this capacity for desensitization, possibly due to an alteration in the uncoupling system between the receptor and adenylate cyclase. The lack of desensitization in these leukemic cells was associated with a higher sensitivity to the receptor-mediated cytotoxic effects of adrenergic hormones. It is suggested that cells, like some leukemic cells, that are unable to desensitize to adrenergic and possibly other hormones may be appropriate targets for differential destruction by hormones under conditions that do not affect normally desensitizing cells.", 
    "20": "Some of the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in elderly patients may be mistakenly attributed to \"old age.\" Weight loss, muscle weakness, tremor, angina, congestive heart failure--all signs of hyperthyroidism--are also concomitants of aging. Fatigue, sluggishness, withdrawal behavior, senile atrophic skin changes--all signs of hypothroidism--are also a part of the normal aging process. Although screening elderly people for thyroid disease is economically unsound, the physician should maintain a high index of suspicion of its presence. Laboratory tests must be interpreted with extra care. Values of 131I uptake, serum T4 and T3, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone are all helpful in diagnosis. Thyroid disease is easily treated in elderly patients, and results often are dramatic. Propranolol is effective in thyrotoxic patients when symptoms require prompt relief. The definitive treatment, however, is 131I; antithyroid drugs are difficult to manage. Hypothyroidism is easily treated with T4.", 
    "21": "Transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) with 0.3-msec pulses between 1 and 25 Hz dilated cat cerebral artery segments in the presence of active muscle tone. Maximum vasodilatation occurred at 8 Hz. The dilator response to exogenous acetylcholine, but not to TNS, was abolished by atropine. Neither physostigmine nor hemicholinium affected the dilator response to TNS, which persisted after administration of guanethidine, phenoxybenzamine, propranolol, reserpine, and chronic sympathectomy. However, it was abolished by tetrodotoxin and cold storage. When examined histochemically, cat and rabbit cerebral arteries exhibited a rich plexiform distribution of acetylcholinesterase which was not affected appreciably by sympathetic denervation. These results suggest that vasodilation is not mediated through modification of sympathetic activity. They also indicate the existence of a nonadrenergic, possibly noncholinergic, vasodilator innervation in cat cerebral arteries. Preliminary studies suggest that the transmitter is not histamine, ATP, prostaglandins, gamma-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, or serotonin. The cat cerebral artery segments contrast with the isolated rabbit cerebral arteries which predominantly constrict in response to TNS and show a small dilator response.", 
    "22": "Metoprolol, a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker, was administered to 12 patients three to ten hours after sustaining a transmural myocardial infarction, and the effect of the drug (10 mg i.v., followed by 50 mg orally every eight hours) was followed for 48 hours. Heart rate decreased by 16% and cardiac output by 27%, while blood pressure and stroke volume decreased little and pulmonary \"wedge\" pressure was not significantly changed. Even in patients with initially definitely elevated left-ventricular filling pressure (greater than 20 mm Hg) the drug was well tolerated without any further rise in pressure. Since left-ventricular work was significantly decreased (stroke work--15%, cardiac output--31%) and the duration of diastole, decisive for coronary perfusion, was prolonged, it is concluded that early administration of beta-receptor blockers has a favourable effect on myocardial oxygenation and possibly reduce ultimate infarct size.", 
    "23": "The morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular complications of chronic arterial hypertension are distinctly reduced by persistent and successful antihypertensive therapy. The principal emphasis is on drug therapy. Diet and psychotherapy should be used as supportive measures. Examples of antihypertensive drugs available for general practice: saluretics, beta-receptor blockers, dihydralazine (Nepresol), alpha-methyldopa, clonidine (Catapresan), reserpine and guanethidine (Ismelin). With mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure up to 105 mm Hq), monotherapy with a beta-receptor blocker or a saluretic is indicated first. Contrary to the medical rule never to use a combination preparation if it can possibly be avoided fixed combinations have proved valuable in hypertensive therapy and facilitate therapy for the hypertensive patient and for the doctor.", 
    "24": "Cholecystectomy increases the incidence of post-vagotomy diarrhoea. The effect of agents which either bind bile acids or prevent their action on the colonic mucosa has been studied in 31 patients with post-vagotomy diarrhoea--15 had had vagotomy and pyloroplasty alone and 16 vagotomy and pyloroplasty and cholecystectomy. Cholestyramine was particularly useful after the combined operation. Aluminium hydroxide in large doses has a similar mechanism of action to cholestyramine and is cheaper and more palatable, but propranolol was of no value. This study suggests that the excretion and chemical composition of bile and the handling of bile acids by the small intestine is of fundamental importance in the pathogenesis of post-vagotomy diarrhoea.", 
    "25": "We assessed thyroid function for 12 months after subtotal thyroidectomy in 100 tyrotoxic patients treated with propranolol alone before and immediately after operation. The operation proved safe, with low morbidity. Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, present in the majority one month after operation, was evidenced by normal or low levels of serum total tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine, but absent or subnormal serum thyrotropin response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Eighty patients were euthyroid at 12 months. Three patterns of thyroid function were observed in this group between the first and 12th months: normal serum total tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine and thyrotropin levels at all stages (20 patients); normal serum total tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine, but raised thyrotropin levels on one or more occasions (40 patients); and temporary hypothyroidism (20 patients). Of the remaining 20 patients, permanent hypothyroidism developed in 14, and six relapsed. Postoperative thyroid function was related to the estimated weight of the thyroid remnant.", 
    "26": "Studies were performed in nine male patients with moderate hypertension. Treatment with metoprolol, 50--150 mg three times daily for 4--17 weeks, had no effect on the plasma level of glycerol, free fatty acids, triglycerides or glucose under basal conditions, neither in the supine nor in the upright position. Submaximal work, performed postprandially, increased plasma glycerol before medication but not during metoprolol, in spite of a marked increase in plasma noradrenaline. The work load employed caused no change in free fatty acids, triglycerides or glucose, neither before medication nor during metoprolol.", 
    "27": "The pharmacokinetics of pindolol were studied in six healthy individuals following a single 10 mg dose (SD) and multiple (5 mg tid over 6 days) dose (MD). The plasma elimination half-life was identical after SD (4.7 +/- 0,8h) and MD (4.1 +/- 1.1h). Steady state plasma concentrations were reached after 36 h and remained stable thereafter. The variation in steady state concentrations was small in each individual and also between individuals. The steady state concentration of pindolol can be predicted from the pharmacokinetic data obtained after a single dose. The results of the present study suggest that the disposition of pindolol is linear over the concentration range studied.", 
    "28": "The effect of a single oral dose of pindolol on bronchi was studied in a double-blind cross-over trial in 20 adult patients, most of whom had moderate bronchial asthma. A single dose of pindolol 5 mg, sufficient to cause a significant fall in heart rate and blood pressure at rest, did not produce a significant fall in the forced expiratory volume (FEV1.0). However, two patients showed marked deterioration in lung function after pindolol. A conventional therapeutic dose of salbutamol by inhalation produced a significant increase in ventilatory function relative to placebo, but it did not outweigh the bronchial effect of pindolol.", 
    "29": "The pharmacological methods used to assess the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of beta-blockers are discussed. The clinical relevance of ISA to respiratory function, peripheral resistance and cardiac function is reviewed. It appears doubtful whether ISA is always of predominant clinical significance and an alternative explanation is offered for many clinical effects observed with certain beta-blockers, e.g. pindolol, oxprenolol, tolamolol, metoprolol, etc. Some effects of these beta-blockers resemble those of labetalol, a new drug with both alpha and beta-blocking activity. Some clinical effects of certain beta-blockers are more likely to be due to alpha-blocking activity than to their ISA.", 
    "30": "It was shown in the rat that mobilization of intramuscular triglyceride during exercise is controlled by the adrenergic system.", 
    "31": "Currently there is not an in vitro or in vivo method of quantitating the potency of uterine inhibiting drugs. Electric field stimulation (EFS) of pregnant and parturient rabbit myometrial strips has been effectively used to assay oxytocic potency of prostaglandins and it is shown in this study to be useful in assaying potency of beta-sympathomimetic compounds. Decreasing electric field stimulation (DEFS) provides three measureable endpoints: tension, excitability, and threshold voltage. Three compounds were tested for these parameters: isoproterenol, ritodrine, and isoxsuprine. It is also revealed that so-called uterine inhibition by these compounds represents the creation of a chaotic fibrillating muscle which is unable to respond in a synchronous way to produce a contraction of maximal tension.", 
    "32": "Administration of tyramine (with or without phentolamine) as well as induction of ether anesthesia or insulin hypoglycemia caused a sharp increase in plasma cyclic AMP in rats. Based on the findings that the treatment of rats with reserpine, 6-hydroxydopamine, cocaine or propranolol totally abolished tyramine-induced increases in plasma cyclic AMP, it was concluded that catecholamines released from sympathetic neuronal terminals by tyramine could activate adenylate cyclase via the stimulation of postsynaptic beta-adrenoceptors. In contrast, catecholamines secreted from adrenal medulla were largely responsible for the increase in plasma cyclic AMP induced by ether anesthesia; whereas glucagon, in addition to adrenal catecholamines, played a significant role in hypoglycemia-induced increases in plasma cyclic AMP. Assay of plasma cyclic AMP following these stimuli is very promising as a test for adrenergic activities in experimental and clinical studies.", 
    "33": "The experiments described were concerned with elucidating the involvement of monoamines in the sexual behaviour of rhesus monkeys. The measurement of perturbations in the levels and turnover of the acid metabolites of serotonin and dopamine in cisternal cerebrospinal fluid, occurring in response to hormonal manipulations which alter proceptivity and receptivity, has not clarified the ways in which hormones and amines interact. However, the use of psychoactive drugs which alter the activity of monamine neurons in the brain has demonstrated that sexual activity can be profoundly influenced by such procedures. Thus, depletion of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the brain using p-chlorophenylalanine reversed the decrease in proceptivity that followed adrenalectomy. Conversely, inhibition of serotonin uptake using chlorimipramine reduced proceptivity and receptivity to very low levels. Both findings point to the apparently important role of serotoninergic neurons in the control of sexual behaviour. Low doses of the dopamine agonist alpha-bromocriptine enhanced the proceptivity of female rhesus monkeys but high doses had no such effect. This behavioural change was not related to the concomitant suppression of serum prolactin and may have been related to presynaptic actions of the drug in a manner postulated to explain similar behavioural effects in rats. The beta-blocker oxprenolol had the interesting property of improving the sexual performance of male rhesus monkeys, a behavioural effect consistent with an anxiolytic action, although endocrine (prolactin, cortisol) measures did not provide support for such a view. Defining the nature of the interaction between hormones and monoamine-containing neurons in the brain in behavioural contexts is shown to depend largely on the application of precise neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological techniques. However, the use of systemic treatment with psychoactive drugs used widely in clinical practice, in carefully controlled, behavioural and and endocrine experiments, is likely to provide invaluable information on where and how to investigate the neural mechanisms involved.", 
    "34": "Sympathetic nerves in vitro form long-lasting, intimate, functional relationships with cardiac muscle cells, but not with fibroblasts. In the presence of an adrenergic beta-blocker and a cholinergic muscarinic blocker, long-lasting relationships still take place. It was concluded that neurotransmitter \"receptors\" are not involved in the mechanism of \"recognition\" of cardiac muscle cells by sympathetic nerves.", 
    "35": "Ninety-nine patients took part in a multicentre, long-term study of metoprolol in the treatment of hypertension. Significant reductions in blood pressure and heart rate were achieved by the use of metoprolol alone, or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Side effects were similar to those seen with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, except that bronchospasm and cold extremities were rarely encountered. Results of monitoring for the abnormal eye symptoms and antinuclear factor titre are discussed. In a second study, 14 hypertensive patients with asthma (11 patients) or history thereof (three patients), received metoprolol for their hypertension. In general, no significant change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was found, despite significant reduction in blood pressure and heart rate. The concomitant use of a beta2-agonist is discussed.", 
    "36": "Echocardiography--combined with additional non-invasive methods--has proved a sensitive tool for measuring hemodynamic and left ventricular function parameters. This study was undertaken to measure by these methods the effect of digoxin, isoproterenol, of the beta-receptorblocker sotalol, sodium nitroprusside and isosorbide dinitrate on the hemodynamics and left ventricular contractility in various patients and normal volunteers. Besides the good reproducibility of results of recent invasive investigations, partly in animal experiments, new aspects about the mode of action of the individual substances were obtained.", 
    "37": "Human astrocytoma cells (EH118MG) respond to catecholamines and prostaglandins with a marked increase in the rate of formation of cyclic AMP. Treatment of EH118MG cells with cholera toxin (10 to 100 ng/ml) for 45 to 60 min caused an increase in cellular cyclic AMP content (5- to 10-fold over basal). Cholera toxin also decreased the K0.5 for isoproterenol 10- to 50-fold and decreased the K0.5 for prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)30- to 100-fold, while increasing the maximal response to PGE1 by 1.5- to 3-fold. Treatment with cholera toxin did not change the K1 values for beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists such as propranolol, alprenolol, and sotalol. Direct binding studies using [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol indicated no significant changes in the number of beta-receptors or in the kinetics of the interaction of the radioligand with receptors after treatment of cells with the toxin. Competition binding studies with propranolol and sotalol revealed no toxin-induced change in Kd values for these antagonists. Treatment with cholera toxin caused only small decreases (2- to 3-fold) in the Kd values for binding of isoproterenol and norepinephrine. It is concluded that cholera toxin has little direct effect on the binding of agonists or antagonists to beta-receptors, but instead increases the efficiency of coupling of receptor and catalytic moieties of adenylate cyclase.", 
    "38": "This case of practolol peritonitis was the first recognised in Australasia and fifth in the world series. At post mortem there was some indefinite indication that, in time and after withdrawal of the drug, the lesion slowly resolves.", 
    "39": "A very through ocular examination was made in 48 hypertensive patients treated for 18 months with acebutolol in a daily dose of between 400 and 2400 mg. Abnormal symptoms in the form of a prickling sensation were seen in two cases. Microscopic punctate lesions of the conjunctive were seen in 9 subjects, either with the Bengal Pink or fluorescein tests. These very slight microscopic lesions were found in general only in the region of the palpebral slits, a zone normaly exposed to microtrauma, which decreases the value of this finding. The results of a Schirmer test were considered to be abnormal in six patients. These ocular abnormalities were generally mild and it could not be shown conclusively that they were related to treatment with acebutolol. Ocular surveillance, with examinations repeated every six months, indicated the absence of any harmful effect on the eye of prolonged used of acebutolol in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "40": "A 68-year-old man with a history of organic heart disease and marked weight loss was found to have apathetic thyrotoxicosis and hypercalcemia. Oral propranolol, 20.0 mg four times a day, provoked a gradual fall in serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase. It is concluded that relatively small doses of oral propranolol may be effective in the management of hypercalcemia accompanying thyrotoxicosis and that beta-blocking agents may not only inhibit the enhanced bone resorption caused by thyroid hormones but also block the stimulated osteoblastic activity.", 
    "41": "The effect of dopamine on human sigmoid motility has been studied in 26 subjects. To record mechanical activity of the sigmoid colon, two small, air-filled balloons mounted on a probe introduced through a sigmoidoscope were used. The recordings were made at a distance of 25 and 15 cm from the anal edge. Dopamine was infused for 10 min after a 30-min control infusion of physiologic solution. Mean amplitude, mean duration, mean frequency, percentage of motor activity, and motility index of the pressure waves were determined. The motor response to dopamine was characterized by an increased baseline pressure with phasic waves superimposed. Dopamine produced a significant response at the dose of 5 microgram/kg/min. Alpha and beta antagonizing agents failed to oppose the effect of dopamine, while anticholinergic drugs enhanced its motor action. These studies suggest that dopamine may stimulate the motor function of human large bowel through specific receptors.", 
    "42": "By reducing the concentration of hypotensive drops and increasing the number of instillations, a therapeutic effect similar to that of the concentrated drop can be obtained, with a reduction of side-effects. The results of experiments with pilocarpine, adrenaline-guanethidine combination and propranolol are described.", 
    "43": "1. Instillation of 2 drops of 4% solution of atenolol decreases the ocular pressure in open angle glaucoma. 2. In 12 glaucomatous patients treated as in-patients, 4 daily instillations of 4% solution lower the average tension of the group below 20-22 mm Hg day and night. 3. The tensionnal effects of 4 or 6 daily instillations on out-patients seems to be less effective. 4. The hypotensive effects of atenolol, on some of the patients at least, decreases during the second month of uninterrupted treatment. However, the response to a single dose remains constant even after a long term treatment. 5. Treatment with atenolol is remarkably well tolerated. It does not provoke either local or general side effect. 6. Although the combination of atenolol and myotics or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors produces an additive pressure lowering effect this results in a loss of the advantages of atenolol with regard to absence of undesirable pharmacological effects.", 
    "44": "The activity of N-acetyltransferase is shown to significantly rise after administration of theophylline and isoprenaline, but not of propranolol and N-acetylderivate of para-aminosalicylic acid to form during 30 minutes at a constant rate that increases following addition of cyclic AMP to the incubation medium. The capacity of the rat to acetylate paraaminosalicylic acid did not change under the effect of the mentioned agents.", 
    "45": "1 Using a standardized form of mental stress, 21 patients with idiopathic hypertension were investigated before and after treatment with placebo (n=8), propranolol (n=7) or methyldopa (n=6). 2 Blood pressure was satisfactorily controlled in the propranolol and methyldopa groups but only the propranolol group showed modification of the pressor response to stress testing. 3 These results suggest that propranolol may provide more uniform control of blood pressure than methyldopa in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "46": "1 Plasma and saliva levels of metoprolol and oxprenolol have been compared in two groups of healthy volunteers. 2 Mean salivary oxprenolol levels were lower than, but closely related to the corresponding plasma levels (r=0.93), the mean ratio of saliva:plasma concentration being 0.42. 3 Mean salivary metoprolol concentrations were considerably greater thatn the corresponding plasma levels and the relationship between the concentrations in the two fluids was less clear. 4 The evidence presented suggests that oxprenolol diffuses passively whilst metoprolol is actively secreted into saliva. The mechanism involved in the active process is not known.", 
    "47": "Effects of cardioactive substances on the post-stimulation potentiation of atrial contractility were studied in 17 isolated, blood-perfused preparations of dogs. Maximum degree of the post-stimulation potentiation was obtained over approximately 3.5 Hz within 5-60 sec of stimulation. Each drug was administered directly into the cannulated sinus node artery of isolated atrium. An adequate dose of verapramil, manganese chloride, or pentobarbital which caused marked depression of contractility did not significantly suppress the post-stimulation potentiation in percent changes. The post-stimulation potentiation was not inhibited by continuous infusion of adenosine, which caused a negative inotropic effect. Tetrodotoxin, propranolol, or caffeine also never suppressed the post-stimulation potentiation but ouabain abolished it in the majority of cases.", 
    "48": "Myocardial hardness, defined as resistance to a pitting force, was measured on several sites of the myocardium in 20 anesthetized dogs. The durometer used for hardness measurements consisted of an indentor, 4 mm in diameter, pressed perpendicularly on the myocardium by a calibrated spring (elastic modulus 325 N/m). Hardness changes during the cardiac cycle caused movement of the indentor which interrupted a light beam falling on a photoresistance. Changes in illumination of the photoresistance resulted in resistance changes, which were recorded using a Wheatstone bridge and a DC amplifier. Hardness was expressed in mm of spring shortenings. Balanced in (zero hardness), the indentor protruded 7.2 mm beyond the foot. Thus hardness adequate to press the indentor level with the foot defined as 7.2 mm. The left ventricular pressure (LVP) rise followed slightly the hardness rise (from 29.5 +/- 3.6 msec--mean +/- SEM--for the basal area at the right ventricle to 35.8 +/- 5.9 msec for the basal area of the left ventricle. Apical areas were significantly harder in systole than corresponding basal areas and left ventricular areas had a significantly higher systolic hardness (SH) than corresponding right ventricular areas. Changes in LVP by transfusion bleeding caused almost proportional changes in SH. While using a constant pressure reservoir in left atrium and another in aorta, adrenaline caused a significant increase in SH, decrease in diastolic hardness (DH) and increase in hardness width (WH); calcium chloride caused a nonsignificant increase in SH and WH and a significant decrease in DH; practolol caused a nonsignificant decrease in SH and a significant increase in DH and decrease in WH. Ligation of 3--5 branches of the anterior descending coronary artery resulted in a significant increase in DH and reduction in the WH distally to the ligation during the first 11 min. The WH was significantly reduced as a function of time in both areas (healthy and infarcted) taken collectively. The WH was significantly higher over the healthy area than over the infarcted one at corresponding times.", 
    "49": "1. The interactions of practolol with acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin and bradykinin were studied on the trachea and lung of the guinea-pig, an animal whose sensitivity to bronchoactive endogens is known to be similar to that of human asthmatic bronchi. 2. Practolol, like propranolol, potentiated the action of the first three agonists mentioned above, but, unlike propranolol, it did not potentiate the bronchospastic effect of bradykinin. 3. Practolol, in fact, antagonized the action of bradykinin, but this effect was unlike that produced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 4. The possibility that beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists might show adverse interactions with certain foodstuffs was investigated, an is discussed. 5. It is suggested that the feasibility of the continued use of practolol (or the newer cardioselective beta-blockers) in asthmatics necessarily depends on the type of allergic reaction involved, and so it is not possible to generalize. Any drug or food that might cause a bronchospastic effect synergistically in the presence of a beta- adrenoreceptor antagonist, even a cardioselective one, should be regarded with suspicion.", 
    "50": "Experiments were undertaken to determine if drugs (verapamil, propranolol, and methylprednisolone sodium saccinate) that protect the fine ultrastructure of heart muscle against damage caused by hypoxia, protect mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial function was assessed in terms of oxidative phosphorylating and Ca2 +-accumulating activities. Isolated rabbit hearts were used, and hypoxic conditions induced by reducing the perfusate PO2 from 80.8 to 0.80 kPa (600 to 6 mmHg). The drugs were either added at the start of the hypoxic perfusion or (verapamil and propranolol) the rabbits were pretreated with them. Verapamil, propranolol and, to a lesser extent, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, provided protection evidenced by the maintainance of near normal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylating and Ca2 +-accumulating activities after 60 min hypoxic perfusion. When added directly to mitochondria isolated from hypoxic-perfused muscle, the drugs had no effect.", 
    "51": "The release of prostaglandin E elicited by sympathomimetic amines was studied in the isolated rabbit heart. The hearts were prepared according to Langendorff, with conventional recording of stroke frequency and contractile force. Assays were made of the outflow of PGE during exposition to equimolar concentrations of methoxamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline, in the absence and in the presence of phentolamine or propranolol. Noradrenaline caused an almost four-fold increase in the basal outflow of PGE from the heart, while methoxamine (an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist) and isoprenaline (a beta-adrenoceptor agonist) were both ineffective in this respect. Thus, the PGE-releasing capacity of the drugs was not correlated to their ability to activate alpha- or or beta-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, no relation was obtained between the PGE release induced by the drugs and the increase in heart rate and contractile force elicited by them. It is suggested that sympathomimetic drugs trigger PGE synthesis and release in the rabbit myocardium following activation of a hitherto unobserved adrenoceptive mechanism, optimally stimulated by NA.", 
    "52": "The influence of intramural noradrenaline on calcium induced contractures was studied in isolated preparations of rat uterus. The depolarized (127 mM KCl) myometrium of oophorectomized rats responded with contraction followed by a transient relaxation when exposed to 3 mM calcium. The threshold concentration of calcium, where the transient relaxation began to appear, was between 0.25 and 0.5 mM. Blockade of the beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol or noradrenaline depletion with reserpine completely removed the transient relaxation, indicating that the latter was due to release of intramural noradrenaline. Estrogen treatment abolished the relaxant effect of intramural noradrenaline, whereas progesterone was ineffective in this respect. Preparations from rats in natural estrus responded like estrogenized tissues, and diestrus preparations behaved as uteri of oophorectomized rats without estrogen treatment.", 
    "53": "Muscle action potentials and miniature end-plate potential frequency were studied in different concentrations of pindolol, d- and l-propranolol and sotalol using intracellular microelectrode recording from rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. d-and l-propranolol at concentrations of 10 to 40 mg/l and pindolol at 20 to 100 mg/l slowed down the rate of rise, prolonged rise and half-decay times and reduced the overshoot of the muscle action potentials. Sotalol had similar effects but only at higher concentrations (100 to 200 mg/l). The drugs had no effect on the increase in the miniature end-plate potential frequence obtained with depolarization by increased extracellular potassium concentration.", 
    "54": "It was shown in experiments on dogs that intravenous injection of adrenaline or noradrenaline in a dose of 2 microgram/kg per min was accompanied by an increase of resistance of the renal vessels with unchanged general renal circulation, and administration of adrenaline against the background of obsidan action--by an increase of resistance and reduction of blood flow, and--against the background of phentholamine action--by a reduction of resistance with unchanged circulation. On the basis of these data and those obtained by the author earlier a supposition is put forward on a possible mechanism of a combination of functions in the systems of circulation and excrection in the control of general water-salt homeostatis in extraordinary hemodynamic shifts with the participation of the humoral factor--renin-angiotensine system.", 
    "55": "Dopamine is present in the carotid body and has been postulated to be an inhibitory neurotransmitter. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of dopamine on ventilation in man and to examine its mechanism of action. Dopamine (0.5-10 mug/kg per min) was infused in eight normal men at different levels of arterial chemoreceptor activity, produced by varying the inspired Po(2). During normoxia dopamine produced a small decrease in minute ventilation (Ve) and an increase in arterial Pco(2). When arterial chemoreceptors were stimulated by hypoxia, infusion of dopamine produced a marked initial depression of Ve followed by a sustained although less pronounced decrease in Ve. An increase in Pa(co) (2) and a decrease in Pao(2) were also observed. When arterial chemoreceptor activity was suppressed by hyperoxia, infusion of dopamine did not affect ventilation. Subjects also breathed a hypercarbic, hyperoxic gas mixture. The hypercarbia produces hyperventilation by stimulating central chemoreceptors, whereas the hyperoxia suppresses peripheral chemoreceptors. Dopamine did not alter ventilation while the subjects were breathing this gas mixture. These studies suggest that dopamine suppresses ventilation in man through an action on the arterial chemoreceptor reflex. These findings support the hypothesis that dopamine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the carotid body, and that release of dopamine may modulate the sensitivity of peripheral arterial chemoreceptors.", 
    "56": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system has been implicated as one of the mechanisms involved in acute renal failure. Support of this hypothesis was forwarded by the finding that propranolol, a blocker of renin release, reduced the deleterious effect of ischemia on kidney function. The hypothesis was tested further in these experiments by studying renal blood flow after ischemic injury to rat kidneys with and without propranolol proection. Miniature electromagnetic flow probes measured blood flow after 70 min of total renal artery occlusion. Although brief infusion of propranolol reduced the degree of acute renal failure, it had no effect on renal blood reflow. The data do not support the hypothesis that the renin-angiotensin system plays a role in acute renal failure. Other explanations for the protective effect of propranolol are suggested.", 
    "57": "In DOCA-saline hypertensive rats, pindolol (4, 20 or 50 mg/kg orally) produced a hypotensive effect which was inversely related to dose. Following adrenal demedullation, a hypotensive response to the highest dose of pindolol was unmasked and the magnitude of the responses to lower doses was increased. The results suggest that adrenal catecholamines moderate the hypotensive effects of high doses of pindolol."
