    "0": "1. The initial effect of bretylium tosylate on isolated rabbit atria was to increase conduction velocity, contraction heights, spontaneous frequency and maximum driven frequency, and to reduce electrical threshold. At concentrations of 200 mg/l. or less, these were the only effects, and were consistent with the known sympathomimetic actions of bretylium.2. At extremely high concentrations, 1,200 and 2,400 mg/l., the initial actions were succeeded by weak quinidine-like effects; reduced conduction velocity, spontaneous and maximum driven frequencies, and rate of rise of action potential. The electrical threshold was raised, but contraction heights were not reduced.3. The local anaesthetic activity of bretylium, measured by reductions in the frog nerve action potential, was 1/90 that of procaine and 1/300 that of propranolol, on a molar basis.4. Acute pretreatment with bretylium, 20 mg/kg intravenously, significantly increased the amount of infused ouabain required before the appearance of the first signs of atrial arrhythmia in anaesthetized guinea-pigs, but did not prevent ventricular arrhythmias.5. Pretreatment with bretylium 30 mg/kg subcutaneously 24 hr, and again 4 hr before ouabain infusion, increased the dose of ouabain inducing atrial irregularity and slightly but significantly reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "1": "1. I.C.I. 50172 had marked quinidine-like effects on intracellular cardiac action potentials at concentrations above 20 mg/l. (6.61 x 10(-5)M). The rate of rise and overshoot of the action potential, conduction velocity and contractions were decreased. (-)-Propranolol had similar effects at less than 1/30 this concentration.2. I.C.I. 50172 had 1/100 the activity of (-)-propranolol as a local anaesthetic. Since this is also the ratio of their in vitro beta-receptor blocking activities, I.C.I. 50172 provides no net increase in specificity of beta-receptor blockade.3. In contrast, the in vivo activity of I.C.I. 50172 in protecting anaesthetized guinea-pigs against ouabain-induced ventricular fibrillation was 40% that of (-)-propranolol.4. Structure-activity relations of beta-receptor blocking drugs are discussed.", 
    "2": "1. The effects of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug alprenolol (H56/28) on myocardial and general haemodynamics were studied in anaesthetized cats.2. Alprenolol (0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg) reduced femoral systolic and diastolic pressures, heart rate and left ventricular systolic pressure. The rate of rise of the left ventricular pressure pulse (dp/dt) was reduced despite a significant elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. This is evidence for decreased myocardial contractility. On some occasions there was a transient initial increase in +ve dp/dt max. possibly indicative of moderate beta-adrenoceptor stimulant activity.3. Myocardial and liver blood flows were measured using a heated thermocouple technique. Alprenolol slightly decreased both myocardial and liver blood flows (mean of 17% and 15% respectively with a dose of 1.0 mg/kg). Myocardial and liver vascular resistances were only very slightly increased.4. Alprenolol had no direct effect on calculated myocardial and liver metabolic heat production.5. In doses up to 1.0 mg/kg alprenolol had no effect on airway resistance but occasionally decreased (in vivo) intestinal muscle movement.6. Since alprenolol (although reducing calculated myocardial oxygen consumption and the myocardial and metabolic heat stimulant effects of catecholamines) has no significant effect on myocardial vascular resistance, it is suggested that it would be a useful adjunct in the therapy of angina pectoris.", 
    "3": "1. The actions of pronethalol and propranolol have been studied to see if there was any relationship between the reduction in coronary flow and any other cardiovascular action they have.2. The experiments were carried out in anaesthetized open chest dogs. Measurements included central arterial, left and right venous or atrial pressures, heart rate, ventricular size and stroke volume, intra-ventricular pressures, total left coronary flow, arterial and coronary sinus blood pO(2). The pressure-time index (PTI) and maximum rate of isovolumetric contraction (dp/dt) were obtained from these records.3. It was concluded that, in these experiments, the reduction in coronary flow produced by pronethalol and propranolol was not directly related to a decrease in perfusion pressure, a raised venous pressure, the increase in ventricular volume and hence wall tension, the decrease in heart rate, or to the increased duration of systole.4. The PTI and dp/dt were always reduced at the same time as the coronary flow. These findings are discussed.5. Studies of the effects of sympathetic stimulation, of phentolamine, of reduced arterial oxygen tension and electrical pacing of the heart, all after beta-blockade, did not support the suggestion that the reduction in coronary flow after beta-blockade was due to the unmasking of an active vasoconstriction."
