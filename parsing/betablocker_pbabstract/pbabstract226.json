The out of hospital and clinical management is discussed. Prior to admission to hospital the patient only showed a few signs of intoxication such as hypotension, central symptoms and cyanosis. There was no bradycardia but during treatment she developed cardiac arrest. Out of hospital it was possible to stabilise the circulation with catecholamines (norepinephrin) and the transport to hospital was uneventful but only a few minutes after hospital admission the patient developed cardiac arrest. After initially successful CPR the patient died some hours later in the intensive care unit.", 
    "1": "An immunomodulatory effect of epinephrine has been reported that is supposed to be mediated via beta-adrenergic receptors. The effect of epinephrine and/or beta-adrenergic blockade on cellular immune functions during systemic inflammation has not yet been investigated.", 
    "2": "Male NMRI mice were treated with either an infusion of epinephrine (0.05 mg/kg/h i.p.), administration of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0.5 mg/kg s.c.), or a combination of epinephrine and propranolol after induction of a polymicrobial sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture. Forty-eight hours thereafter survival and cellular immune functions (splenocyte proliferation, splenocyte apoptosis and cytokine release, distribution of leukocyte subsets) were determined.", 
    "3": "Infusion of epinephrine did not affect lethality of septic mice but induced alterations of splenocyte apoptosis, splenocyte proliferation and IL-2 release and was associated with profound changes of circulating immune cell subpopulations. Treatment with propranolol augmented the epinephrine-induced increase of splenocyte apoptosis, did not affect the decrease of splenocyte proliferation and IL-2 release, augmented the release of IL-6 and antagonized the mobilization of natural killer cells observed in epinephrine-treated animals. Furthermore, these immunologic alterations were accompanied by a significant increase of sepsis-induced mortality. Coadministration of propranolol and epinephrine augmented the propranolol-induced changes of splenocyte apoptosis and IL-6 release and was associated with the highest mortality of septic mice.", 
    "4": "Epinephrine infusion modulated cellular immune functions during systemic inflammation without an impact on survival. A pharmacologic beta-adrenergic blockade partly augmented the epinephrine-induced immune alterations and was associated with a pronounced increase of mortality. This effect was further augmented by a combination of epinephrine infusion and beta-adrenergic blockade. These data indicate that adrenergic mechanisms modulate cellular immune functions and survival during sepsis, with these effects being mediated via alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways.", 
    "5": "Previous in vivo studies have shown that beta-adrenoceptor agonists cause a redistribution of coronary flow away from the subendocardium; however, the underlying mechanism remains uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that a heterogeneous distribution of beta-adrenoceptors and their vasomotor responses exists in the coronary microcirculation across the left ventricular wall.", 
    "6": "Porcine subepicardial and subendocardial arterioles (<100 microm) were isolated from the left ventricle and pressurized for in vitro study of vasodilation to the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol and the selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonist procaterol. Both vessel types developed a similar level of basal tone and dilated to isoproterenol and procaterol. However, subepicardial arterioles exhibited a much higher sensitivity and greater dilation capacity to both agonists. The isoproterenol-induced vasodilations were inhibited by glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel blocker. In contrast to isoproterenol, dilations of subepicardial and subendocardial arterioles to pinacidil, a K(ATP) channel opener, were similar. In both vessel types, isoproterenol-induced dilation was inhibited by the beta2-adrenoceptor blocker ICI-118,551 but was insensitive to the beta1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical data revealed that beta2-adrenoceptor mRNA and protein expression, respectively, were markedly greater in subepicardial arterioles.", 
    "7": "This study demonstrates that selective activation of beta2-adrenoceptors elicits dilation of both subepicardial and subendocardial arterioles through opening of K(ATP) channels. The higher beta2-adrenoceptor expression in subepicardial arterioles may contribute to the greater dilation of these vessels to beta2-adrenoceptor activation.", 
    "8": "Beta-blockers substantially improve survival in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but concerns about cardiovascular adverse effects may deter physicians from prescribing this therapy. We performed an overview of randomized beta-blocker trials in patients with HF to quantify the risks of these adverse effects.",

    "10": "beta-Blocker therapy was associated with significant absolute annual increases in risks of hypotension (11 per 1000; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0-22), dizziness (57 per 1000; 95% CI, 11-104), and bradycardia (38 per 1000; 95% CI, 21-54). There was no significant absolute risk of fatigue associated with therapy (3 per 1000; 95% CI, -2 to 9). beta-Blocker therapy was associated with a reduction in all-cause withdrawal of medication (14 per 1000; 95% CI, -2 to 29) as well as significant reductions in all-cause mortality (34 per 1000; 95% CI, 20-49), HF hospitalizations (40 per 1000; 95% CI, 22-58), and worsening HF (52 per 1000; 95% CI, 10-94).", 
    "11": "Although beta-blocker therapy was associated with hypotension, dizziness, and bradycardia, the absolute increases in risk were small, and overall fewer patients were withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy than from placebo.

    "12": "Streptozotocin-treated rats were used as models of type 1 diabetes to study the effects of dietary taurine on insulin- and adrenergic-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake by isolated adipocytes. In addition to the well-established impairment of basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptakes in adipocytes prepared from streptozotocin-diabetic rats, the alpha-(phenylephrine) and beta-(isoproterenol) adrenergic stimulations of glucose uptake were also abolished. The insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in adipocytes was selectively abolished by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, whereas that by the adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine and isoproterenol, was inhibited by prazosin and propranolol, respectively. Dietary taurine, 4 weeks before and 4 weeks after streptozotocin administration, prevented the loss of both insulin and adrenergic agonist stimulations of 2-deoxyglucose uptake, without affecting hyperglycaemia. Because insulin and adrenergic activations of glucose transport by adipocytes are coupled to different signalling pathways, it is unlikely that these effects of taurine are related to these disparate postreceptor mechanisms.", 
    "13": "Recombinant 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT7 receptors are known to express constitutive, i.e., agonist-independent activity. Nonselective ligands, like methiothepin, ritanserin or clozapine behave as full inverse agonists at 5-HT7 receptors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the degree of inverse agonist activity of three selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonists ((R)-3,N-dimethyl-N-[1-methyl-3-(4-methyl-piperidin-1-yl)propyl]benzene sulfonamide or SB-258719, R-(+)-1-(toluene-3-sulfonyl)-2-[2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)ethyl]-pyrrolidine or SB-258741 and (R)-3-(2-(2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)ethyl)-pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl)-phenol or SB-269970) in the same model. cAMP accumulation was measured in intact Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human recombinant 5-HT7a receptors. In these cells, 5-HT stimulated cAMP levels and a series of ligands antagonized the effect of 5-HT with a 5-HT7 receptor-like profile. SB-258719 had no inverse agonist activity, SB-258741 behaved as a partial inverse agonist and SB-269970 was a quasi-full inverse agonist (as compared to methiothepin). The inverse agonist effect of SB-269970 was antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by SB-258719. The widespread spectrum of inverse agonist activities shown by these compounds should help assessing the physiological relevance of constitutive 5-HT7 receptor activity in native tissues.",

    "15": "Forty-five patients scheduled for elective surgery were allotted to one of three groups. They were given either alfentanil 3 microg kg(-1) min(-1) (n = 15); esmolol 1 mg kg(-1) min(-1) (n = 16) or clonidine 3 microg kg(-1) (n = 14) as a 10 min infusion. The infusions of alfentanil and esmolol, but not of clonidine, were maintained during endotracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam (2 mg) and thiopental as required to suppress the eyelash reflex. Atracurium (0.5 mg kg(-1)) was given to produce neuromuscular block. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and bispectral index were recorded on arrival (baseline), after study drug infusion, after injecting midazolam and thiopental, as well as after endotracheal intubation. ANOVA and chi2-test were used for analysis.", 
    "16": "Blood pressure, heart rate and the bispectral index were unaltered by the study drugs, but thiopental requirements were reduced by alfentanil and clonidine (P < 0.014). Mean arterial pressure values (mean +/- standard error of mean) in the alfentanil, esmolol and clonidine groups were: baseline: 107.8 +/- 3.8; 106.6 +/- 3.9; 103.4 +/- 3.7 mmHg; after thiopental: 74.0 +/- 4.2; 85.6 +/- 4.3; 94.2 +/- 4.1 mmHg and after endotracheal intubation: 91.7 +/- 5.3; 114.1 +/- 6.9; 123.6 +/- 5.6 mmHg, respectively (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.001). Mean arterial pressure changed significantly after intubation from baseline (P < 0.001) after alfentanil (-15%) and clonidine (+20%) but not after esmolol (+7%), while the changes between pre- and postintubation values were similar in all groups (24-33% increase). The bispectral index indicated that all patients had an adequate level of hypnosis, but the variability was higher in the esmolol group (P < 0.002).",

    "18": "The aim of this study was to develop an in vitro model of the cornea of bovine cells, to characterise the model by histochemical methods and to investigate permeation of ophthalmic drugs through the model. As in the in vivo situation, an in vitro model of the cornea should consist of all three different types of cells. In the current study, the construction of the in vitro cornea was performed using cells prepared from primary cultures. To investigate the state of the cells in the cultures, growth curves were established. Immunocytochemical determination of keratin and vimentin was performed for all three isolated and sub-cultivated cell types of the bovine cornea. To further simulate the in vivo conditions, corneal epithelial cells were seeded onto the collagen-gel base containing the stromal cells with an underlying sheet of endothelium. Permeation experiments were performed with pilocarpine hydrochloride and timolol hydrogen maleate as model drugs and excised bovine cornea and the in vitro cornea as permeation barriers. The immunohistochemical investigations show that excised bovine cornea and the in vitro model of the cornea are comparable with respect to the expression of keratin K3, indicating that the primarily isolated cells correspond to the different cell types of the cornea. Culturing of the epithelial cells on the complex basis has led to the formation of a corneal epithelium with several layers, closely resembling the morphology of the in vivo epithelium. Although the permeation rates of the drug through the in vitro cornea were always higher, the sequence in which the drugs permeate through the two types of barriers was the same. The drug permeation through the in vitro cornea may therefore be a useful predictive tool to estimate the permeability coefficients of drugs through excised cornea.", 
    "19": "The human beta1-adrenoceptor (beta1-AR) is an important therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases and has two common functional polymorphisms (49S>G and 389R>G). These polymorphisms have only been studied in isolation, however, and not in the context of the four haplotypes (SR, SG, GR and GG) that exist in native beta1-ARs.", 
    "20": "To address this, the function of each of the receptor haplotypes was studied in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with appropriately modified human beta1-adrenoceptor cDNA sequence.", 
    "21": "The affinity for the beta-adrenoceptor ligand, [125I]-cyanopindolol, was not significantly different across the haplotypes, but a high affinity state for the beta1-AR could only be demonstrated for receptors carrying the 389R substitution.

Incubation with isoprenaline (10 microm for 30 min or 20 h) caused increased down-regulation of beta1-ARs in cells expressing GG and GR haplotypes (at 20 h percentage fall respectively -28.1 +/- 5.2 and -38.2 +/- 3.0).",

    "23": "Previous research has demonstrated that in the Siberian hamster, both photoperiod and estrous cyclicity alter the profile of noradrenergic activity with the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and that noradrenergic activity is correlated with changes in circulating levels of prolactin. Work from our laboratory has demonstrated an inhibitory role for norepinephrine (NE) acting at the alpha-2 receptor subtype within the PVN on serum prolactin levels; however, the functional significance of other adrenergic receptor subtypes on this system is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional significance of the alpha-1b and beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes at the level of the PVN on circulating levels of prolactin. These experiments were performed in male Siberian hamsters using reverse microdialysis coupled with serial blood sampling. In Experiment 1, infusion of l-phenylephrine hydrochloride (alpha-1b agonist) initiated a dose-dependent increase in circulating prolactin, whereas infusion of chloroethylclonidine (alpha-1b antagonist) induced a significant dose-dependent decline in prolactin. In Experiment 2, intraparaventricular administration of propranolol (beta antagonist) initiated a significant increase in prolactin levels in a dose-dependent manner, whereas isoproterenol (beta agonist) induced a dose-dependent decline in prolactin. The results of this study indicate that both the alpha-1b and beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes have a significant role in regulating circulating levels of prolactin at the level of the PVN in the Siberian hamster.", 
    "24": "The results of cardiac biopsies suggest that myocardial beta1-adrenoceptor (AR) density is reduced in patients with chronic heart failure, while changes in cardiac beta2-ARs vary. A technique for visualization and quantification of beta1-AR populations rather than total beta-AR densities in the human heart would be of great clinical interest. Molecular imaging techniques, either single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET), with appropriate radiopharmaceuticals offer the possibility to assess beta-AR density noninvasively in humans, but to date, neither a SPECT nor a PET-radioligand is clinically established for the selective imaging of cardiac beta1-ARs. The aim of this study was to design a high affinity selective beta1-AR radioligand for the noninvasive in vivo imaging of cardiac beta1-AR density in man using SPECT. Based on the well-known selective beta1-AR antagonist, ICI 89,406, both the racemic iodinated target compound 11a and the (S)-enantiomer 15a were synthesized. Competition studies using the nonselective AR ligand, [(125)I]iodocyanopindolol ([(125)I]ICYP), and ventricular membrane preparations from mice showed that 11a and 15a possess higher beta1-AR affinities (up to 265-fold) and beta1-AR selectivities (up to 245-fold) than ICI 89,406. Encouraged by these results, the radioiodinated counterparts of racemic 11a (11b: (125)I, 11c: (123)I) and (S)-configurated 15a (15b: (125)I, 15c: (123)I) were synthesized. The target compounds were evaluated in rats. Biodistribution and metabolism studies in rats indicated that there is a specific heart uptake of 11b-c and especially 15b-c accompanied by rapid metabolism of the radioligands. Therefore, radioiodinated 11c and 15c appeared to be unpromising SPECT-radioligands for assessing beta1-ARs in vivo in the rat. However, the rat may metabolize beta-AR ligands more rapidly than other species as demonstrated for (S)-[(11)C]CGP 12177, a radioligand structurally related to 11a-c and 15a-c. Therefore further studies in a different animal model will be carried out.",

    "26": "Strips were cut from the bladder body and placed in organ baths containing Krebs solution. Contractions were induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS) and, in some experiments, by exogenous alpha,beta (alpha,beta)-methylene adenosine triphosphate.", 
    "27": "St. John's wort was significantly more active in inhibiting the EFS-induced contractions than the alpha,beta-methylene adenosine triphosphate-induced contractions, suggesting both a presynaptic site of action and a direct inhibition of bladder smooth muscle. The inhibitory effect of SJW on EFS-induced contractions was unaffected by methysergide, haloperidol, phentolamine plus propranolol (antagonists that block the action of the neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytriptamine, dopamine, and noradrenaline on their own receptors), the L-type calcium channel antagonist verapamil, capsazepine (which blocks the vanilloid receptor), or cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A. However, the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of SJW on EFS-induced contractions. Among the chemical constituents of SJW tested, hyperforin and, to a lesser extent, the flavonoid kaempferol showed inhibitory effects.", 
    "28": "The results of our study demonstrated that SJW inhibits excitatory transmission of the rat urinary bladder and also directly inhibits smooth muscle contractility. The inhibitory effect on excitatory transmission could involve, at least in part, opioid receptors. SJW may be evaluated for its possible use in treating urinary incontinence in depressed patients.", 
    "29": "Stress induces analgesia by mechanisms within and outside the brain. Here we show that the sympathetic nervous system is an essential trigger of intrinsic opioid analgesia within peripheral injured tissue. Noradrenaline, injected directly into inflamed hind paws of male Wistar rats, produced dose-dependent antinociception, reversible by alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta(2)-antagonists. alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors were demonstrated on beta-endorphin-containing immune cells and noradrenaline induced adrenergic receptor-specific release of beta-endorphin from immune cell suspensions. This antinociceptive effect of noradrenaline was reversed by micro - and delta-opioid antagonists as well as by anti-beta-endorphin. Stress-induced peripheral analgesia was abolished by chemical sympathectomy and by adrenergic antagonists. These findings indicate that sympathetic neuron-derived noradrenaline stimulates adrenergic receptors on inflammatory cells to release beta-endorphin, which induces analgesia via activation of peripheral opioid receptors.", 
    "30": "Brugada and long QT-3 syndromes are two allelic diseases caused by different mutations in SCN5A gene inherited by an autosomal dominant pattern with variable penetrance. Both of these syndromes are ion channel diseases of the heart manifest on surface electrocardiogram by ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads and prolonged QT(c) interval, respectively, with predilection for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and sudden death, which may be the first manifestation of the disease. Brugada syndrome usually manifests during adulthood with male preponderance, whereas long QT3 syndrome usually manifests in teenage years, although it can also manifest in adulthood. Class IA and IC antiarrhythmic drugs increase ST-segment elevation and predilection for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in Brugada syndrome, whereas these agents shorten the repolarization and QT(c) interval, and thus may be beneficial in long QT-3 syndrome. Beta-blockade also increases the ST-segment elevation in Brugada syndrome but decreases the dispersion of repolarization in long QT-3 syndrome. Mexiletine, a class IB sodium channel blocker decreases QT(c) interval as well as dispersion of repolarization in long QT-3 syndrome but has no effect on Brugada syndrome. The only effective treatment available at this time for Brugada syndrome is implantable cardioverter defibrillator, although repeated episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia can be treated with isoproterenol. In symptomatic patients of long QT-3 syndrome in whom the torsade de pointes is bradycardia-dependent or pause-dependent, a pacemaker could be used to avoid bradycardia and pauses and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is indicated where arrhythmia is not controlled with pacemaker and beta-blockade. However, the combination of new devices with pacemaker and cardioverter-defibrillator capabilities appear promising in these patients warranting further study.",

    "32": "In 884 MADIT II patients, 10-minute Holter monitoring at enrollment was used to evaluate HRT parameters and frequency of VPBs. The primary endpoints were defined as all-cause mortality in patients randomized to conventional treatment and as appropriate therapy for ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in patients randomized to implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy.", 
    "33": "The median turbulence slope was lower in patients who died in comparison to survivors in the conventional arm (2.3 vs 4.5 ms/RR; P < 0.05); but it was not a significant predictor of mortality after adjustment for clinical covariates (age, ejection fraction, beta-blocker use, and BUN levels). There was no association between HRT parameters and arrhythmic events in ICD patients. Conventionally treated patients who died and ICD patients who had appropriate ICD therapy had significantly more frequent VPBs than those without such adverse events. After adjustment for clinical covariates, frequent VPBs>3/10 min were associated with death in the conventional arm (HR = 1.63; P = 0.070) and were predictive for appropriate ICD therapy in the ICD arm (HR = 1.75; P = 0.003).", 
    "34": "In postinfarction patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, frequent VPBs are associated with increased risk of mortality and with appropriate ICD therapy. HRT obtained from 10-min Holter ECG showed a trend toward the association with mortality in univariate analysis but HRT parameters were not predictive of the outcome in multivariate analyses.", 
    "35": "It has been shown that a statin (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme reductase inhibitor) enhances a suppressive effect of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) blocker (ARB) on injury-induced transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta expression in kidneys. We have shown that TGF-beta plays a crucial role in the development of liver fibrosis. In this study, we tested whether a combinatory use of a statin (pitavastatin) and an ARB (candesartan) may further inhibit liver fibrogenesis in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-treated rats. Candesartan (8 mg/kg/day) significantly suppressed injury-induced TGF-beta 1 expression in livers, and attenuated fibrogenesis, as evaluated by masson-trichrome staining and hydroxyproline content in livers. Pitavastatin (2 mg/kg/day) alone did not affect liver fibrogenesis. However, it enhanced significantly the suppressive effects of candesartan on TGF-beta 1 expression and fibrogenesis. Although we do not know the underlying molecular mechanisms at this moment, these results suggest that a combinatory use of a statin and an ARB may confer beneficial effects on human liver fibrogenesis.", 
    "36": "Betablocking agents are known to exert anti-arrhythmic effects in ischemic myocardium due to blockade of myocardial beta-1-receptors. Since adenosine (Ado) induced muscarinic potassium current (IK(Ado)) and ATP sensitive potassium current (IK(ATP)) are discussed to be activated during ischemia we studied the effect of propranolol on IK(Ado) and IK(ATP).", 
    "37": "The effect of propranolol on muscarinic potassium current and IK(ATP) was studied in isolated rat atrial myocytes by means of the whole-cell voltage clamp tech- nique. Propranolol (50 microM) completely inhibited IK(Ado). IC50 was 7 microM. Inhibition of acetylcholine induced current (IK(ACh)) and GTP-gamma-S induced muscarinic potassium current was less potent (IC50 29 microM and 31 microM respectively). Propranolol was active from the outside only. Intracellular application did not significantly affect muscarinic potassium current. (+)-propranolol, an isomer without beta-blocking properties, was as effective as (+/-)-propranolol. The inwardly rectifying potassium current IK(ATP) showed minor sensitivity to the compound (10% current reduction, propranolol 50 microM).", 
    "38": "Propranolol inhibits IK(Ado). Inhibition is not due to beta-receptor blockade. Predominantly an interaction with A1-receptors seems to be involved. The observations in part might explain the anti-arrhythmic properties of the drug in ischemic/fibrillating myocardium based on the prolongation of refractoriness.",

    "40": "In this 6-month, prospective, parallel, randomised, investigator-masked clinical trial, 61 glaucomatous patients treated with timolol 0.5% twice in both eyes were enrolled. The timolol 0.5% was replaced by bimatoprost 0.03% once daily (group I) or by latanoprost 0.005% plus timolol 0.5% (group II). IOP measurements were performed at the baseline visit and at days 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180. Digital colour photography was used to evaluate topical side effects.",

Both treatments lowered the mean IOP at every visit significantly compared with the baseline (p<0.01). Comparing the IOP reductions obtained by the two treatments, no significant differences were found at any time during the study.

    "44": "Hind paw edema was induced in male Wister rats by the subplantar injection of venom (12.5-100 microg/paw) in the absence and presence of antagonists. Edema was quantified by hydroplethysmometry at 0.25, 0.5, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h post-injection and was expressed as the percentage increase relative to the contralateral (control) paw. The ability of the venom to release histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells was also assessed.", 
    "45": "Venom caused dose- and time-dependent edema that was maximal within 15 min but disappeared after 24 h and was accompanied by hemorrhage. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg, s.c.), methysergide (6 mg/kg, i.p.), HOE 140 (0.6 mg/kg, i.v.) and mepyramine (6 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly ( p < 0.05) reduced edema formation, whereas indomethacin (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was ineffective. Dialysis did not affect venom-induced edema. Venom (1, 10 and 30 microg/ml) caused a concentration-dependent release of histamine (13 +/- 1%, 61.9 +/- 4.6% and 73.6 +/- 2.4%, respectively; n = 5) from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. Histological analysis confirmed the presence of edema, hemorrhage and neutrophil infiltration. Pretreating the venom with EDTA partially inhibited the edema and hemorrhage, but did not affect the migration of neutrophils.", 
    "46": "B. lanceolatus venom produced dose- and time-dependent edema in rat paws.

    "47": "Peptide toxins have been valuable probes in efforts to identify amino acid residues that line the permeation pathway of cation-selective channels. However, no peptide toxins have been identified that interact with known anion-selective channels such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR channels are expressed in epithelial cells and are associated with several genetic disorders, including cystic fibrosis and polycystic kidney disease. Several organic inhibitors have been used to investigate the structure of the Cl- permeation pathway in CFTR. However, investigations of the wider cytoplasmic vestibule have been hindered by the lack of a high-affinity blocker that interacts with residues in this area. In this study we show that venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus reversibly inhibits CFTR, in a voltage-independent manner, by decreasing single-channel mean burst duration and open probability only when applied to the cytoplasmic surface of phosphorylated channels. Venom was able to decrease burst duration and open probability even when CFTR channels were locked open by treatment with either vanadate or adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate, and block was strengthened on reduction of extracellular Cl- concentration, suggesting inhibition by a pore-block mechanism. Venom had no effect on ATP-dependent macroscopic opening rate in channels studied by inside-out macropatches. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity was abolished by proteinase treatment. We conclude that a peptide toxin contained in the scorpion venom inhibits CFTR channels by a pore-block mechanism; these experiments provide the first step toward isolation of the active component, which would be highly valuable as a probe for CFTR structure and function.", 
    "48": "In this randomized controlled multicenter trial, we compared endoscopic variceal banding ligation (VBL) with propranolol (PPL) for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. One hundred fifty-two cirrhotic patients with 2 or more esophageal varices (diameter >5 mm) without prior bleeding were randomized to VBL (n = 75) or PPL (n = 77). The groups were well matched with respect to baseline characteristics (age 56 +/- 10 years, alcoholic etiology 51%, Child-Pugh score 7.2 +/- 1.8). The mean follow-up was 34 +/- 19 months. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Neither bleeding incidence nor mortality differed significantly between the 2 groups. Variceal bleeding occurred in 25% of the VBL group and in 29% of the PPL group. The actuarial risks of bleeding after 2 years were 20% (VBL) and 18% (PPL). Fatal bleeding was observed in 12% (VBL) and 10% (PPL). It was associated with the ligation procedure in 2 patients (2.6%). Overall mortality was 45% (VBL) and 43% (PPL) with the 2-year actuarial risks being 28% (VBL) and 22% (PPL). 25% of patients withdrew from PPL treatment, 16% due to side effects. In conclusion, VBL and PPL were similarly effective for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. VBL should be offered to patients who are not candidates for long-term PPL treatment.",

In smokers, fibrinogen, PAI-1, and homocystine were reduced more (P =.002, P =.0009, and P <.0001, respectively) than in nonsmokers in the whole study cohort. The effect of nebivolol was more prominent in smokers than nonsmokers in reducing all three parameters (P =.0001,.003, and.003, respectively), whereas in celiprolol and carvedilol-treated groups, differentiation between smokers and nonsmokers was significant (P =.00003 and.01, respectively) only in homocystine level change.",

    "78": "We have studied whether Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) is involved in the mechanism of long-term potentiation (LTP) at nicotinic synapses of bullfrog sympathetic ganglia. Fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fast EPSPs) were recorded in a low-Ca(2+), high-Mg(2+) solution and quantal analysis was applied. The conditioning stimulation of the B-type preganglionic nerve at 20 Hz for 4 min consistently enhanced the amplitude and quantal content of fast EPSP for > 2 h, but only sometimes enhanced the quantal size. The LTP of quantal content produced by the conditioning tetanus was blocked by thapsigargin, a blocker of Ca(2+) pumps at Ca(2+) stores, applied before or after the conditioning tetanus, and by Xestospongin C, a blocker of inositoltrisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors, applied before the tetanus. It was not, however, blocked by ryanodine, a blocker and/or activator of ryanodine receptors, or by propranolol, a blocker of beta-adrenergic receptors. Thus the long-lasting activity of the preganglionic nerve at a high frequency causes the LTP of impulse-evoked transmitter release by the activation of CICR from thapsigargin-sensitive Ca(2+) stores in the nerve terminals. It is likely that a large Ca(2+) entry into the nerve terminals during tetanic activity primes ryanodine-insensitive Ca(2+) release channels for activation.",

Compared to the EBL strategy, the HVPG+ strategy cost an incremental 5,974 dollars per recurrent bleed prevented. In a population with 100% compliance with all therapies, the incremental cost of HVPG-versus EBL fell to 5,270 dollars per recurrent bleed prevented. The model results were sensitive to the cost of EBL, the cost of HVPG monitoring, and the probability of medical therapy producing an adequate HVPG decline.",

Pinealocytes from 21-day-old ovariectomized rats were exposed to different estrogen doses and treated with beta-adrenergic agonists. Estrogen treatment produced a dose-dependent, biphasic response to beta-adrenoceptor-induced accumulation of cAMP. This effect was inhibitory at estrogen doses up to 0.1 nM and fitted to a negative exponential curve, while at doses from 0.1 to 100 nM the effect was stimulatory and fitted to a standard positive hyperbola. For in vivo studies, ovariectomized rats were treated with equivalent estrogen concentrations plus a single dose of progesterone (250 microg per rat), and their pineals exposed in vitro to beta-adrenergic agonists. Low doses of E2 (0.1-100 ng per rat) reduced both pineal cAMP accumulation and N-acetyltransferase activity after beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, while a high dose (10 microg per rat) induced the opposite response. Apparently, the final estrogen target was the pineal beta-adrenergic receptor, as a low dose of E2 (which had diminished cAMP accumulation after beta-adrenoceptor stimulation) also reduced its maximal binding capacity (Bmax) and its dissociation constant (Kd). We also found that the female rat pineal gland contains two different ER subtypes, alpha and beta, which respond to estrogen exposure with nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. These results indicate that, in the female rat, estrogen directly modulates pineal sensitivity to adrenergic stimulation in a complex, dose-dependent manner that may be related to differential expression and activity of two estrogen receptor subtypes within pineal cells.", 
    "95": "Forty-five patients aged 34 to 67 years who had coronary heart disease (CHD) were examined. Anaprilin was given in a dose of up to 120 mg daily. Concurrently with positive changes in the anginal syndrome there were improved sleep, decreases in hot temper, irritability, anxiety, phobic manifestations, hypochondrical trends, and neurotic asthenization, increased working and social orientation. During anaprilin therapy, cardialgias reduced or disappeared, the incidence of arrhythmia decreased. There was a reduction in the personality profile in the scales \"neurotic triad\" and \"psychoasthenia\", significantly diminished reactive anxiety, and a decrease in the blood levels of aldosterone, cortisol, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine. Thus, supplementation of anapriline to the combined therapy for patients with CHD of behavioral type A (BTA) positive affected the clinical course of the disease. Hormonal disorders in BTA CHA may be eliminated by anaprilin. Configuration of the personality profile was leveled in patients with CHA of \"coronary\" type.",

A meta-analysis of four studies evaluating BNP levels versus exercise peak oxygen uptake or 6-minute walking distance showed a significant correlation, but a low R-value of -0.59. Studies using BNP levels for optimisation of heart failure therapy showed conflicting results concerning the correlation between the functional improvement and changes in BNP levels. Conflicting results were also found concerning the utility of BNP levels as a surrogate to predict efficacy of the various anti-congestive therapies on heart failure outcome.",

    "99": "Chronic inflammation is one of the important mechanisms involved in atherosclerosis formation. The activated monocytes and their secreted cytokines contribute significantly to this inflammatory process. Here we examined the effects of carvedilol, a recently introduced cardio-protective alpha-1- and beta-receptor blocker, on cytokine production from various stimuli-activated human immune effector cells. By ELISA analysis, we showed that carvedilol inhibited interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but enhanced interleukin (IL)-12 production in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)- and concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was marginally affected. When purified monocytes were examined, we observed the consistent up-regulation of IL-12 production while both IL-10 and TNF-alpha were unaffected or marginally down-regulated, respectively, by carvedilol. In agreement with the observation in monocytes, the production of IL-12 from activated macrophages was also up-regulated by carvedilol. We concluded that carvedilol might mediate its therapeutic effects through differentially regulating cytokine production from activated mononuclear cells, including at least monocytes and macrophages.", 
    "100": "Electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded from the giant danio (Danio aequipinnatus) to study glutamatergic input mechanisms onto bipolar cells. Glutamate analogs were applied to determine which receptor types mediate synaptic transmission from rods and cones to on and off bipolar cells. Picrotoxin, strychnine, and tetrodotoxin were used to isolate the effects of the glutamate analogs to the photoreceptor-bipolar cell synapse. Under photopic conditions, the group III metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist (RS)-alpha-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine (CPPG) only slightly reduced the b-wave, whereas the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) blocker dl-threo-beta-benzyl-oxyaspartate (TBOA) removed most of it. Complete elimination of the b-wave required both antagonists. The alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)/kainate receptor antagonist 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX) blocked the d-wave. Under scotopic conditions, rod and cone inputs onto on bipolar cells were studied by comparing the sensitivities of the b-wave to photopically matched green and red stimuli. The b-wave was >1 log unit more sensitive to the green than to the red stimulus under control conditions. In CPPG or l-AP4 (l-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid, a group III mGluR agonist), the sensitivity of the b-wave to the green stimulus was dramatically reduced and the b-waves elicited by the 2 stimuli became nearly matched. The d-wave elicited by dim green stimuli, which presumably could be detected only by the rods, was eliminated by NBQX.",

    "102": "The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) plays a key role in neural development and neurodegeneration. Here, we identify a novel, modulatory receptor ligand, a 14-amino acid peptide (AEFHRWSSYMVHWK) derived from the C-terminus of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In three different in vitro preparations, this 'AChE-peptide' is bioactive in a ligand-specific and concentration-dependent manner. First, it modulates acutely the effect of acetylcholine (ACh) on Xenopus oocytes transfected with human alpha7, but not alpha4/beta2, nAChR. The action persists when intracellular calcium is chelated with BAPTA or when calcium is substituted with barium ions. This observation suggests that intracellular Ca(2+) signals do not mediate the interaction between the peptide and nAChR, but rather that the interaction is direct: however, the intervention of other mediators cannot be excluded. Secondly, in recordings from the CA1 region in guinea-pig hippocampal slices, AChE-peptide modulates synaptic plasticity in a alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BgTx)-sensitive manner. Thirdly, in organotypic cultures of rat hippocampus, long-term exposure to peptide attenuates neurite outgrowth: this chronic, functional effect is selectively blocked by the alpha7 nAChR antagonists, alpha-BgTx and methyllycaconitine, but not by the alpha4/beta2-preferring blocker dihydro-beta-ethroidine. A scrambled peptide variant, and the analogous peptide from butyrylcholinesterase, are ineffective in all three paradigms. The consequences of this novel modulation of the alpha7 nAChR may be activation of a trophic-toxic axis, of relevance to neurodegeneration.",

The performance of the models was compared in 14 healthy men in supine and standing positions under control conditions and under conditions of beta -sympathetic and parasympathetic pharmacological blockades. Transfer function gains were computed from ILV to RRI (cardiopulmonary gain) and from SBP to RRI (baroreflex gain). The measurements were done under controlled random-interval breathing.", 
    "106": "The gains identified by the open-loop model tended to be higher than those from the closed-loop model, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Importantly, the two models discriminated the changes in transfer gains between different interventions equally well.", 
    "107": "Because the interactions between SBP and RRI occur physiologically in a closed-loop condition, the closed-loop model provides a theoretical advantage over the open-loop model. However, in practise, it seems to be little reason to select one over the other due to methodological errors when estimating cardiopulmonary or baroreflex transfer gains.", 
    "108": "Five patients with amiodarone-induced QT prolongation and torsade de pointes are described. Hypokalemia was present in three patients, marked bradycardia - in two, and T-wave alternans - also in two patients. Patients with negative T waves in precordial leads were at higher risk of ventricular fibrillation than the patients with positive T waves. Beta-blocker, lidocaine and, in two patients, tosylate bretylate were effective. All patients survived to hospital discharge, however, one patient died four months later.", 
    "109": "MODALITIES FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM: Currently rely on the confrontation of the initial clinical data and the results of D-dimer measurements, a venous Doppler, although reliable, is not a first-line exploration. REGARDING TREATMENT: Indications for thrombolysis are currently limited to massive pulmonary oedema with shock. Alteplase added to heparin improves the progression of severe embolism; it spares the patients from heavy interventions of resuscitation but the mortality remains the same. Concerning anticoagulant treatments, prolonged antivitamin K at classical doses is more effective than low doses and for limited duration if phlebitis is an idiopathic one. FOR HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION: Treatment of these heart failures, formerly know as 'diastolic' is similar to that of the acute phase of systolic heart failure. However, care should be taken with vasodilatators. CONCERNING HEART FAILURE IN GENERAL: The brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) represents a remarkable progress for the aetiological diagnosis of dyspnoea (inferior to 80 pg/ml in the case of pulmonary origin, superior to 300 pg/ml in the case of cardiac origin or severe pulmonary embolism). Regarding treatment, for acute heart failure, it is still the association of nitrates and diuretics, with oxygen therapy and eventually inotropics. Beta-blockers, which have revolutionized the treatment of chronic heart failure, must be maintained whenever possible in the case of the onset of acute pulmonary oedema. Multisite pacing is increasingly used in refractory chronic heart failure. Implantable defibrillation has become common practice. Non-invasive ventilation (Bi or C-PAP) is interesting in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. THE PREVENTIVE ROLE OF N ACETYL-CYSTEINE: N acetyl cysteine reduces the incidence of nephropathies induced by the radio contrast products in patients with chronic kidney failure. Combined with hydratation, it must be proposed the day before and on the day of the procedure in any patient with diabetes or kidney failure.", 
    "110": "UNBLOCK THE CORONARY ARTERIES: For the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with ST-segment elevation, emergency repermeabilisation is of the artery is crucial, generally by primary angioplasty than by fibrinolysis. The other treatments have little beneficial effects on mortality. Primary angioplasty is the technique of choice when it can be performed in the intensive care units with staff with sufficient experience and within the 90 minutes following the preliminary medical management, and benefiting from the supply of PG IIb-IIIa. THROMBOLYSIS: Performed before the twelfth hour, thrombolysis reduces mortality. The earlier it is performed the greater the benefits. A significant reduction is mortality is observed even in patients aged over 75. The indications for coronography are determined by the existence of clinical risk factors and by the data of supplementary non-invasive examinations (sonography, scintigraphy, effort testing). When clinical risk factors exist from the start, a coronography must be performed. In the absence of initial risks, and if the non-invasive examination reveals risk factors, then a coronarography should be performed.", 
    "111": "NEW DENOMINATIONS: With the arrival of new therapeutic strategies requiring rapid intervention, acute coronary syndromes required classification on earlier data than the Q-wave or MB creatinine kinase. In a patient with anginal pain and depending on the electrocardiogram, we now distinguish syndromes with or without ST segment elevation. REGARDING ANTIPLATELET DRUGS: Aspirin is used in all cases, as well as clopidogrel. Anti PG IIb-IIIa agents are set aside only for the forms at risk, when an angioplasty is envisaged in the short term. ANTICOAGULANTS: Enoxaparin has demonstrated its superiority over unfractionated heparin. In general, the biological controls are not indispensables; they can however be used in certain cases (notably elderly patients). OTHER TREATMENTS: These are beta-blockers (first dose via the intravenous route in the case of persisting pain, then relay to the oral route), calcium-channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) when beta-blockers are contraindicated, nitrate derivatives with demonstrated antalgic effect but not to be used if an extension to the right ventricle or low blood pressure is suspected, nasal oxygen in the case of cyanosis or respiratory distress, enzyme conversion inhibitors if hypertension persists, and repeated intravenous injections of morphine in the case of persisting intense pain. CORONARY REVASCULARISATION: In all the patients considered at high risk, coronary revascularisation is recommended within the first 24 hours, when technically possible.",

The target dose of carvedilol is 10 mg twice a day and the mean follow-up is estimated to be 2 years. The primary endpoints are to evaluate (1) all-cause mortality or hospitalization, (2) cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization and (3) worsening heart failure. The secondary endpoints are to assess (1) cardiovascular events, (2) the individual components of the above combined endpoints, (3) the duration of hospitalization, (4) the functional class and exercise capacity and (5) the safety and tolerability.

BRS was assessed according to the transfer function method. A cardioverter - defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 97 patients. During follow-up (median 315 days), appropriate ICD discharge occurred in 53 patients, and 3 more patients died suddenly. Sustained VT was induced in 84% and 77% of patients who did or did not develop arrhythmia at follow-up (p=0.34). No differences were found in age, sex, infarct site, drug therapy, resting RR interval or cycle of induced VT. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < or =35%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class >2 and BRS < or =3.3 ms/mmHg were found to be univariate predictors of arrhythmia recurrence. Multivariate models were obtained after grouping patients according to a moderately or severely depressed LVEF. Among the patients with LVEF < or =35%, BRS < or =3.3 ms/mmHg emerged as the only significant risk predictor of arrhythmia occurrence (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value = 79%, 74%, 83% and 68%, respectively), whereas NYHA class >2 was a significant predictor among patients with LVEF >35%.",

Recent data suggest that blocking the effects of IgE with omalizumab, a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the binding of IgE, is an effective strategy for the treatment of asthma, particularly for moderate to severe asthma that is difficult to control with inhaled corticosteroids and traditional controller medications. Targeting specific steps in the inflammatory cascade with omalizumab improves daytime and nocturnal symptom control, reduces exacerbations, and decreases the need for inhaled corticosteroids and beta(2) agonists. These benefits, along with improved daily functioning, have resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in asthma-related quality of life for a substantial number of patients. This paper briefly reviews the contribution of IgE to the development of airway inflammation, discusses the clinical benefits of IgE-blocker therapy, and profiles the patient who stands to benefit from this new and innovative form of therapy.", 
    "119": "Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a secreted member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, and in previous studies has been shown to regulate osteoclast activity and differentiation. Ablation of the OPG gene in mice results in calcification of the aorta and renal arteries. We have previously reported an association between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of OPG and vascular morphology and function in healthy humans. The objective with this study was to confirm our previous results in a larger population, and in addition, to study subjects with hypertension. The OPG genotype was determined by restriction fragment length and the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery was measured by ultrasound in 100 patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, and 75 healthy normotensive control subjects. In the hypertensive group subjects with the CC genotype (n=24) showed a significantly increased IMT compared to those with the TC (n=52, p=0.007) and TT (n=24, p=0.009) genotype, in the hypertensive group only (mean +/- SD for TT=0.88 +/- 0.21 mm, TC=0.90 +/- 0.16 mm, CC=1.05 +/- 0.31 mm). The allele distribution did not differ between hypertensive and control individuals.

In all, 6614 elderly patients with hypertension (mean age 76.0 years, range 70-84 years at baseline) were included in STOP-Hypertension-2. In the present subgroup analysis of STOP-Hypertension-2, isolated systolic hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure at least 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure below 95 mmHg, in accordance with the Syst-Eur and Syst-China study criteria. In total, 2280 patients in STOP-Hypertension-2 met these criteria. In the study, patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups: \"conventional\" antihypertensive therapy with beta-blockers or diuretics (atenolol 50 mg, metoprolol 100 mg, pindolol 5 mg, or fixed-ratio hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus amiloride 2.5 mg daily); ACE inhibitors (enalapril 10 mg or lisinopril 10 mg daily); or calcium antagonists (felodipine 2.5 mg or isradipine 2.5 mg daily).

Prevention of cardiovascular mortality, the primary endpoint of the study, did not differ between the three treatment groups. All stroke events, i.e. fatal and non-fatal stroke together, were significantly reduced by 25% in the newer-drugs group compared with the conventional group (95% CI 0.58-0.97; p=0.027). This difference was attributable to reduction of non-fatal stroke while fatal stroke events did not differ between groups. New cases of atrial fibrillation were significantly increased by 43% (95% CI 1.02-1.99; p=0.037) on \"newer\" drugs compared with \"conventional\" therapy, mainly attributable to the calcium antagonists.

    "128": "The major antibody in saliva is IgA, which is actively transported by pIgR expressed by parenchymal cells within the salivary glands. The rate of IgA secretion into saliva is regulated by the autonomic nerves supplying the glands in vivo. This study examined the mechanism of increased IgA secretion into saliva with autonomimetic stimulation. In vitro stimulation of IgA secretion from cells prepared by digestion of rat salivary glands found submandibular cell preparations responded to alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimuli whereas the parotid cells responded only to beta-adrenergic stimulation, although cells from both glands responded similarly to cholinergic stimulation. The additional responsiveness of submandibular cells to alpha-adrenergic stimulation probably reflects the presence of granular duct cells (absent in parotid glands) which are known to secrete protein in response to high frequency sympathetic stimulation. The increased secretion of IgA was not dependant upon increased plasma cell activation since isolated salivary gland plasma cells did not respond to agonists. Further evidence for the regulating role of parenchymal cells in IgA secretion into saliva was revealed by analysis of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) levels expressed on cells. Following in vivo nerve stimulation, there was an increased amount of pIgR expressed on the membrane surface. This was functionally demonstrated in vitro by increased uptake of human IgA by acutely prepared rat salivary cells following stimulation by adrenaline, indicating increased mobilisation of pIgR with stimulation. This study confirms that salivary cells increase the delivery of IgA into saliva by a pIgR-mediated mechanism in response to autonomic stimulation.",

When symptoms were stable before the introduction of beta-blockers and for up to 1 year thereafter, MIBG myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography was performed and the images analysed to obtain the extent score (EXT), severity score (SEV) and washout rate (WR). At the same time, echocardiography was performed to measure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Thereafter, patients were placed under observation for an average of 1,314+/-986 days, with the occurrence of cardiac events as the endpoint.",

Therefore, patients at risk have to be identified and the appropriate diagnostic or therapeutic measures initiated. The most important factor in this context is whether a planned surgery can be postponed. Several strategies have been developed (e.g. Goldman index, Eagle criteria) and the American Heart Association (AHA/ACC) has produced guidelines concerning perioperative diagnosis and therapy of cardiac risk patients. The common goal of these strategies is always the risk classification of the patient by combining the operative risk and the risk factors of the patient. The further procedure (diagnostic or therapeutic measures) is based on the risk classification. If further invasive therapy proves to be necessary, the determining factor is the period of time for which the operation can be delayed. This appears to be about 3 months but if this is not possible the outcome could be improved with a beta-blocker therapy in advance. A working group from the university hospital in Marburg has developed a strategy for risk classification and further diagnostic and therapeutic measures as outlined in this article.", 
    "141": "Recent evidence suggests that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system ameliorates diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction, but the mechanisms involved in this process remain elusive. We investigated the effect of treatment with an angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan, on the metabolic and electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes isolated from streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ) rats. Glucose uptake and electrophysiological properties were measured in ventricular cardiomyocytes from normoglycemic and STZ-induced diabetic rats given vehicle or 20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) losartan for 8 weeks. Insulin and beta-adrenergic stimulation failed to increase the glucose uptake rate in STZ cardiomyocytes, whereas the alpha-adrenergic effect persisted. Concurrently, a typical prolongation of action potential duration (APD) and a decrease of transient outward current (I(to)) were recorded in patch-clamped STZ myocytes. Treatment with losartan did not affect body weight or glycemia of diabetic or control animals. However, in losartan-treated STZ-induced diabetic rats, beta-adrenergic-mediated enhancement of glucose uptake was completely recovered. APD and I(to) were similar to those measured in losartan-treated control rats. A significant (P < 0.0001) correlation between metabolic and electrophysiological parameters was found in control, diabetic, and losartan-treated diabetic rats. Thus, angiotensin receptor blockade protects the heart from the development of cellular alterations typically associated with diabetes. These data suggest that angiotensin receptor blockers may represent a new therapeutic strategy for diabetic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "142": "Recent work suggests that insulin may exert both positive and negative feedback directly on pancreatic beta-cells. To investigate the hypothesis that insulin modulates beta-cell metabolism, mouse islets and beta-cell clusters were loaded with rhodamine 123 to dynamically monitor mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). Spontaneous oscillations in DeltaPsi(m) (period: 218 +/- 26 s) were observed in 17 of 30 islets exposed to 11.1 mmol/l glucose. Acute insulin application (100 nmol/l) hyperpolarized DeltaPsi(m), indicating a change in mitochondrial activity. The ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel opener diazoxide or the l-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine mimicked the effect of insulin, suggesting that insulin activates K(ATP) channels to hyperpolarize DeltaPsi(m) by inhibiting calcium influx. Treatment with forskolin, which increases endogenous insulin secretion, also mimicked the effect of exogenous insulin, suggesting physiological feedback. Pretreatment with nifedipine or the K(ATP) inhibitor glyburide prevented insulin action, further implicating a K(ATP) channel pathway. Together, these data suggest a feedback mechanism whereby insulin receptor activation opens K(ATP) channels to inhibit further secretion. The resulting reduction in beta-cell calcium increases the energy stored in the mitochondrial gradient that drives ATP production. Insulin feedback onto mitochondria may thus help to calibrate the energy needs of the beta-cell on a minute-to-minute basis.", 
    "143": "Increasing evidence indicates that a progressive decrease in the functional beta-cell mass is the hallmark of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The underlying causes, beta-cell apoptosis and impaired secretory function, seem to be partly mediated by macrophage production of interleukin (IL)-1beta and/or high-glucose-induced beta-cell production of IL-1beta. Treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with the potassium channel opener diazoxide partially restores insulin secretion. Therefore, we studied the effect of diazoxide and of the novel potassium channel opener NN414, selective for the beta-cell potassium channel SUR1/Kir6.2, on glucose- and IL-1beta-induced apoptosis and impaired function in human beta-cells. Exposure of human islets for 4 days to 11.1 and 33.3 mmol/l glucose, 2 ng/ml IL-1beta, or 10 and 100 micromol/l of the sulfonylurea tolbutamide induced beta-cell apoptosis and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The deleterious effects of glucose and IL-1beta were blocked by 200 micromol/l diazoxide as well as by 3 and 30 micromol/l NN414. By Western blotting with phosphospecific antibodies, glucose and IL-1beta were shown to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, an effect that was abrogated by 3 micromol/l NN414. Similarly, 1 micromol/l of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1/2 inhibitor PD098059 or 1 micromol/l of the l-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nimodipine prevented glucose- and IL-1beta-induced ERK activation, beta-cell apoptosis, and impaired function. Finally, islet release of IL-1beta in response to high glucose could be abrogated by nimodipine, NN414, or PD098059. Thus, in human islets, glucose- and IL-1beta-induced beta-cell secretory dysfunction and apoptosis are Ca(2+) influx and ERK dependent and can be prevented by the beta-cell selective potassium channel opener NN414.",

These findings support treatment guidelines that recommend the concurrent use of all available proven efficacious treatment in patients with advanced CHF.", 
    "154": "Intravenous injections of CCK-B agonists, such as pentagastrin, produce symptoms of panic and potent activation of the human hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. It is unclear whether these psychological and endocrine effects are mediated by similar or independent processes. Independence is supported by prior evidence that beta-adrenergic receptor blockade attenuates cardiovascular and symptom but not vasopressin responses to CCK-4. To further explore associations between somatic, emotional and endocrine responses to CCK-B agents, and potential beta-adrenergic mediating mechanisms, symptom and endocrine responses to pentagastrin were examined after propranolol pre-treatment. Cardiovascular, symptom, and endocrine (ACTH, cortisol, epinephrine) responses to pentagastrin were measured in 16 healthy adult subjects randomly assigned to receive propranolol or placebo pre-treatment. Propranolol significantly blocked the normal cardiac acceleration produced by pentagastrin, but did not reduce panic symptom or anxiety effects. It delayed and perhaps enhanced the cortisol response. No relationship between HPA and symptom responses following pentagastrin could be detected, though pre-pentagastrin cortisol was inversely related to post-injection panic symptom intensity. Endocrine, cardiovascular and symptom responses to pentagastrin appear to be separately mediated, as they did not change in concert in response to propranolol pre-treatment, nor were they correlated with one another. The results are consistent with the presence of inhibitory beta-adrenergic mediation of the HPA axis in humans. They support the hypothesis that the HPA response to pentagastrin is not secondary to the psychological stress of its side effects.",

Cells possibly more responsive to GPIIb-IIIa (alpha(IIb)beta(3)) antagonists were evidenced through MP phenotypes by comparison with healthy volunteers (HV) and STEMI patients treated by PTCA without GPIIb-IIIa antagonist (CP). In 50 STEMI patients, blood samples were collected at day 1 and day 6. Circulating procoagulant MP were captured on annexin V and quantified by prothrombinase assay as nanomolar phosphatidylserine equivalents (nm PhtdSer). Platelet activation by thrombin was confirmed through independent measurement of soluble GPV (sGPV). With respect to HV, procoagulant MP levels were high in patients with STEMI or unstable angina, platelet-derived MP and elevated sGPV testifying to significant platelet activation. A substantial release of endothelial-derived MP was evidenced simultaneously. In abciximab-treated patients, procoagulant MP, mainly of platelet origin, decreased precociously at day 1 (4.2 +/- 0.6 vs. CP 15.5 +/- 2.1 nm PhtdSer; P = 0.001) together with sGPV (36 +/- 3 vs. CP 58 +/- 8 ng mL(-1); P = 0.02). Leukocyte-derived MP decreased at day 6 (0.12 +/- 0.04 vs. CP 0.56 +/- 0.12 nm PhtdSer; P = 0.01) suggesting a possible effect on underlying inflammatory status. In patients presenting cardiovascular events at 6-month follow-up, procoagulant MP levels at day 1 could be indicative of a worsened outcome. MP could constitute a relevant parameter for the follow-up of STEMI patients treated by GPIIb-IIIa antagonists.",

Such treatment is now included in guidelines of asthma therapy on the basis of class A evidence from large placebo-controlled trials. Data on the cost-benefit of such treatment is less compelling, but suggests that for patients with mild asthma this clinical improvement is gained at the expense of an increase in direct costs (mostly drug costs), whereas for patients with more severe asthma there may be a cost benefit, largely from reduced costs of exacerbations. Recently, combination inhalers containing both LABA and corticosteroid in the same device have been introduced. Although it is said that a single inhaler (with some immediate symptom relief) may aid patient adherence, there are no firm data to support this, nor are there any cost-effectiveness data on this point. Overall, these devices have been priced at less than the two drugs given separately, but prospective studies evaluating costs in clinical settings are required.",

In addition, we determined the involvement of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), which have been implicated in cardioprotection induced by opening of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. Adult male ICR mice were pretreated with the KCa-channel opener NS-1619 either 10 min or 24 h before 30 min of global ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion (I/R) in Langendorff mode. Infusion of NS-1619 (10 microM) for 10 min before I/R led to smaller infarct sizes as compared with the vehicle (DMSO)-treated group (P <0.05). This infarct-limiting effect of NS-1619 was associated with improvement in ventricular functional recovery after I/R. The NS-1619-induced protection was abolished by coadministration with the KCa-channel blocker paxilline (1 microM). Similarly, pretreatment with NS-1619 (1 mg/kg ip) induced delayed protection 24 h later (P <0.05). Interestingly, the NS-1619-induced late protection was not blocked by the NOS inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (15 mg/kg ip). Unlike diazoxide (the opener of mitochondrial KATP channels), NS-1619 did not increase the expression of inducible or endothelial NOS. Western blot analysis demonstrated the existence of alpha- and beta-subunits of KCa channels in mouse heart tissue. We conclude that opening of KCa channels leads to both early and delayed preconditioning effects through a mechanism that is independent of nitric oxide.",

With careful monitoring of these patients--including echocardiography for one patient--we document the onset of asystole at the exact time of ECT stimulus application. With these data, we discuss why asystole is likely to result from a direct central pathway rather than via a baroreceptor reflex, and discuss a neuroanatomic pathway potentially responsible for our findings.

Antihypertensive treatment with beta-adrenergic receptor blockers may have deleterious metabolic consequences, including worsening of lipid profiles and insulin sensitivity. The centrally-acting sympatholytic agent moxonidine may improve these variables. In this randomised, double-blind multicenter study, the effects of two widely used antihypertensive agents--moxonidine (MOX) and the beta (1)-selective adrenergic receptor blocker metoprolol (MET)--on blood pressure and metabolic control were directly compared in hypertensive subjects with type 2 diabetes. Patients received either MOX (0.2 - 0.6 mg/d) or MET (50 - 150 mg/d) for 12 weeks, intending comparable blood pressure control. In total 200 patients were randomized. Here we report results from the per protocol population consisting of 127 patients (MOX 66, MET 61) but similar results were found in the ITT population. Reductions in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures after 12 weeks were similar in both groups: In the MOX group, mean SBP (+/- SD) decreased from 154 +/- 12 to 142 +/- 17 mmHg and mean DBP from 91 +/- 9 to 83 +/- 9 mmHg. In the MET group, mean SBP decreased from 152 +/- 13 to 140 +/- 15 mmHg, and mean DBP from 90 +/- 8 to 84 +/- 10 mmHg. Mean HbA (1C) values did not differ between groups after 12 weeks (MOX 8.1 +/- 1.4 Hb%, MET 8.1 +/- 1.5 Hb%, intention-to-treat population). However, fasting plasma glucose decreased in the MOX group (median change - 5 mg/dl), but increased in the MET group (+ 16 mg/dl; p < 0.05). Median changes in the insulin resistance index (HOMA (IR)) were + 0.56 micro IU x mol/L (2) in the MET group, and - 0.27 micro IU x mol/L (2) in the MOX group. Correspondingly, fasting triglycerides increased with a median change of + 29.5 mg/dL in the MET group, but decreased in the MOX group (- 27.5 mg/dl; p < 0.05). These results indicate that MOX, unlike MET, may elicit beneficial adaptations in glucose and lipid metabolism in hypertensive subjects with type 2 diabetes, although mean HbA (1c) values did not differ.

Despite the compelling scientific evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers reduce hospitalizations and mortality rates in patients with HF, these lifesaving therapies continue to be underused. Several studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of eligible patients with HF are not receiving treatment with these guideline-recommended, evidence-based therapies. In patients hospitalized with HF, who are at particularly high risk for re-hospitalization and death, the initiation of beta-blockers is often delayed because of concern that early initiation of these agents may exacerbate HF. Recent studies suggest that beta-blockers can be safely and effectively initiated in patients with HF before hospital discharge and that clinical outcomes are improved. The Initiation Management Predischarge Process for Assessment of Carvedilol Therapy for Heart Failure (IMPACT-HF) trial demonstrated that pre-discharge initiation of carvedilol was associated with a higher rate of beta-blocker use after hospital discharge, with no increase in hospital length of stay. In addition, there was no increase in the risk of worsening of HF. Studies of hospital-based management systems that rely on early (pre-discharge) initiation of evidence-based therapies for patients with cardiovascular disease have also found increases in post-discharge use of therapy and a reduction in the rates of mortality and hospitalization. On the basis of these pivotal studies, the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) program is designed to improve medical care and education of hospitalized patients with HF and accelerate the initiation of evidence-based HF guideline recommended therapies by administering them before hospital discharge. A registry component, planned as the most comprehensive database of the hospitalized HF population focusing on admission to discharge and 60- to 90-day follow-up, is designed to evaluate the demographic, pathophysiologic, clinical, treatment, and outcome characteristics of patients hospitalized with HF.

Calcium alginate beads are known to be unable to control the release of most insoluble drugs. Pindolol-loaded alginate-gelatine beads have been developed using a solvent-free technique that involves a cross-linking reaction. Modifications in matrix structure and physicochemical behaviour caused by the cross-linking reaction were assessed during particle formation and drug release. Several parameters, such as matrix gelling rate, encapsulation efficiency, drug release profile and matrix erosion rate, were investigated. Physicochemical characterisation indicates the formation of a new alginate-gelatine matrix and shows that pindolol does not interfere with the matrix formation process. Matrix swelling of calcium alginate beads induced by phosphate buffer ends up in erosion and destruction. However, for cross-linked beads swelling does not lead to complete erosion, which may be the main cause of pindolol retention within the matrix. The modifications introduced in the initial calcium alginate formulation by means of an appropriate method such as the use of a cross-linking agent successfully changed the matrix performance, allowing the controlled release of pindolol.",

    "200": "Angiotensin II (AT II) is a final product of the renin-anglotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) and presents one of the most influential factors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial dysfunction and heart failure. ACE-inhibitors (ACEI), beside beta adrenergic blockers, are a cornerstone of the current chronic heart failure (CHF) treatment. Evidence based medicine has not yet proved any significant beneficial effects of ACEI in patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP), although according to the SoLVD study testing the possible effects of ACEI in patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction and/or CHF, there was a significant hospitalization rate reduction as well as less transformation of UAP to myocardial infarction in patients treated with ACEI. In the GISSI 3, ISIS 4 and CCS studies, ACEI was given within the first 24 hours and continued for 4-6 weeks. According to pooled results, ACE inhibitor could save 11/1000 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and only 1/1000 patients with non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In the SAVE, AIRE and TRACE studies, ACEI was started later, i.e. 3-16 days after acute myocardial infarction and continued for several years. ACEI therapy resulted in a significantly lower mortality during the first year, and an even 20% relative reduction in the total mortality during the 4-year follow up. The effects of ACEI were even more prominent in more severe myocardial dysfunction, as it was well known that they could slow or stop unfavorable myocardial remodeling. Conclusively, ACEI should be given as early as possible to all patients with acute myocardial infarction, if no contraindications. The HOPE study showed efficacy of ACEI in the primary prevention of ischemic heart disease in high risk individuals, and the EUROPA study showed a favorable effect of ACEI in the secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease in low risk patients. According to these findings, ACEI should be given permenantly following myocardial infarction. These findings suggest the need of a permanent treatment with ACEI in patients having sustaned myocardial infarction. Angiotensin-1 receptor antagonists (AT-1 antagonists) are a newer generation of neurohormonal antagonists, which block the effects of AT II produced not only through a classic, ACE-dependent pathway but also via alternative pathways (non ACE-dependent) and selectively bind to AT-1 receptors for AT II. Therefore, they have some theoretical advances in comparison with ACEI. There are 2 relevant studies elucidating their possible role in treating patients with or post-myocardial infarction. The OPTIMAAL study did not prove losartan to be better than an ACEI (captopril), while the VALIANT study showed that the effects of valsartan vs. captopril were statistically nonsignificantly different. Furthermore, there is no sense to combine AT-1 antagonist and ACEI, while a combination of AT-1 antagonist and a beta blocker is justified. In other words, AT-1 antagonist (the class effect is disputable) should be given to patients with acute myocardial infarction or to post-myocardial infarction patients who cannot take ACEI.", 
    "201": "In recent years cardiology has opened new chapters in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The acute therapeutic procedures include antianginal, anticoagulant and revascularization therapy. Optimal therapeutic procedure in ACS has two objectives: 1) quick removal of the factors causing ischemia, and 2) prevention of death or myocardial infarction, i.e. reinfarction. Nitrates have been present in pharmacotherapy for more than 150 years. They are used exclusively to efficiently suppress the symptoms, but there is no proof of their positive effect on the disease prognosis. The effect of nitrates is manifested as vasodilatation in the arterial, and particularly in the venous vascular basin (central and peripheral effects) thus increasing the capacity of venous blood. Besides the peripheral effect, nitrates have an important central effect, i.e. they dilate epicardial coronary arteries, both the healthy ones and those damaged by atherosclerosis, in this way increasing the collateral blood circulation. Organic nitrates, although the oldest antianginal drug, play one of the leading roels in the treatment of ACS even today. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have been used since 1960 in the treatment of arterial hypertension, coronary disease and cardiac arrhythmias, and later their efficacy in the prevention of secondary myocardial infarction was noted. Beta blockers (BB) reduce heart rate, systemic blood pressure and myocardial oxygen requirements, reduce myocardial contractility, thus alleviating precordial pain in ACS, decreasing the rate of threatening infarction, and reducing ventricular arrhythmias. Numerous clinical studies have shown that BB in ACS improve the disease prognosis and play an important role in long-term secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Antagonists of calcium channel blockers are a group of therapeutic agents successfully used in numerous cardiac and noncardiac indications. Potential benefits of calcium antagonists in ACS are the result of various combinations, such as dilation of coronary arteries and arterioles, reduction of heart rate and myocardial oxygen requirements, and beneficial effect on left ventricular function and elasticity. The use of calcium channel blockers in ACS reduces or prevents the symptoms and accompanying ischemia, but there is no evidence that these agents prolong survival in patients with heart failure. In recent years the treatment of an ACS has significantly changed owing to better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease as well as progress in medicinal and interventional treatment. Antianginal therapy, which includes nitrates analgesics, calcium channel blockers and antiadrenergic therapy using beta-blockers in treatment of ACS, takes a significant place.", 
    "202": "The objective of this study was replacing an in vivo bioequivalence study by generating suitable in vitro data in order to get generic marketing authorisation. Solubility and permeability of sotalol hydrochloride were determined thereby achieving classification of this compound according to the biopharmaceutical classification system. In addition comparative investigation of in vitro dissolution properties of different Sota-saar formulations and the reference product provided satisfying justification to waive in vivo bioavailability (BA)/bioequivalence (BE) studies. The investigations on solubility were performed considering the highest dose strength in aqueous media (250 ml) with pH conditions between pH 1.0 and 7.5. Permeability was studied using the human colorectal carcinoma cell line Caco-2. In vitro as well as in vivo data suggest high permeability of the drug compound through the intestinal membrane. Thus, evaluation of solubility and permeability allow sotalol hydrochloride to be classified as biopharmaceutics classification system class I drug. In vitro dissolution profiles demonstrate comparable rapid dissolution (more than 85% in 15 min) for test and reference products. Summarizing, relevant prerequisites are fulfilled to waive BA/BE studies."
