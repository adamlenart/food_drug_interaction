Neutrophils play a major role in mediating joint inflammation in gout. Along with neutrophils, other immune cells, such as macrophages, are present in inflamed joints and contribute to gout pathogenesis. Neutrophils form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in response to MSU crystals. In the presence of MSU crystals, macrophages release IL-1\u03b2, a cytokine crucial to initiate gout pathogenesis and neutrophil recruitment. Our research investigated interactions between human macrophages and neutrophils in an in vitro model system and asked how macrophages affect NET formation stimulated by MSU crystals.",

The presence of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase (NE) was measured by ELISA. NET formation was quantitated by Sytox Orange-based extracellular DNA release assay and NE-DNA ELISA. AggNET formation was assessed by macroscopic evaluation.", 
    "4": "We found that crystal- and cell-free supernatants of macrophages stimulated with MSU crystals promote MSU crystal-stimulated NET formation in human neutrophils. This observation was confirmed by additional assays measuring the release of MPO, NE, and the enzymatic activity of NE. MSU crystal-induced NET formation remained unchanged when neutrophil supernatants were tested. IL-1\u03b2 is a crucial cytokine orchestrating the onset of inflammation in gout and is known to be released in large amounts from macrophages following MSU crystal stimulation. We found that recombinant IL-1\u03b2 strongly promoted MSU crystal-induced NET formation in human neutrophils. Interestingly, IL-1\u03b2 alone did not induce any NET release. We also found that clinical grade anakinra, an IL-1 receptor blocker, strongly reduced the NETosis-enhancing effect of macrophage supernatants indicating that IL-1\u03b2 is mainly responsible for this effect.", 
    "5": "Macrophage-derived IL-1\u03b2 enhances MSU crystal-induced NET release in neutrophils. We identified a new mechanism by which macrophages and IL-1\u03b2 affect neutrophil functions, and could contribute to the inflammatory conditions present in gout. Our results also revealed a new anti-inflammatory mechanism of anakinra.", 
    "6": "Chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is one of the major possible hazards that can result from potential cardiotoxic agents while treating cancer. Prognostic risk factors include the rate of drug administration, history of hypertension, female gender, extremes of age, previous history of mediastinal irradiation, cumulative dose and pre-existing heart disease. Close monitoring of the patients, timely diagnosis, use of well-known biomarkers including cardiac troponins, NT-ProBNP and imaging studies like 2D Echo or cardiac MRI are essential. Emerging biomarkers include carbonyl reductases (CBR1 and CBR3), aldo-keto reductases (AKR, type 1A1, 1C3, 7A2) and topoisomerase2\u03b2 (Top2\u03b2). \u03b2 blockers and ACE inhibitors have not only been shown to slow down the progression of cardiac dysfunction but also produce symptomatic improvement. Our case report describes a patient with acute myeloblastic leukaemia who developed severe cardiomyopathy acutely after starting the anthracycline-based regimen. Nevertheless, with timely intervention her symptoms improved and subsequently she successfully received allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

Patients were compared according to the use of \u03b2-blockers at discharge. Compared with the no \u03b2-blocker group, the risk of all-cause death was significantly lower in the \u03b2-blocker group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.65 [P=0.001]). A consistent result was obtained in multiple adjusted model and propensity score-matched analysis. The use of \u03b2-blockers was also associated with decreased risk of composite of adverse cardiovascular events (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28-0.81 [P=0.006]), although statistical significance disappeared after multivariable adjustment and propensity score matching. Furthermore, we performed post hoc analysis for the subsets of patients and the results revealed that patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction benefited the most from \u03b2-blocker therapy at discharge (HR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.00-0.27 [P=0.001]), and the use of <50% of target dose was significantly associated with better outcome compared with no \u03b2-blocker use, rather than \u226550% of target dose.",

All participants had hypertension at baseline, defined as blood pressure \u2265140/90 mm\u2009Hg or use of antihypertensive medications. Medication use and blood pressure were assessed at 5 time points. Young's elastic modulus and distensibility coefficient of the right common carotid artery were obtained by ultrasound at baseline and after a mean (SD) follow-up period of 9.4 (0.5) years. Associations with changes in Young's elastic modulus and distensibility coefficient, baseline antihypertensive medication use, number of visits each medication class was reported, and blood pressure control (<140/90 mm\u2009Hg) were assessed using multiple linear regression models. At baseline, mean age of participants (n=1206) was 63.2 (9.0) years (55% female; 35% African American, 19% Hispanic, 12% Chinese). Mean systolic blood pressure was 136.5 (20.6) mm\u2009Hg. Greater progression of arterial stiffness was associated with older age, African American ethnicity, and baseline calcium channel blocker use. There were no other associations between changes in Young's elastic modulus or distensibility coefficient and use of other medication classes (all P>0.4). Achieving blood pressure control (<140/90 mm\u2009Hg) at all visits was associated with slower progression of arterial stiffness (Young's elastic modulus: \u03b2=-790.1 mm\u2009Hg, P=0.01; distensibility coefficient: \u03b2=7.34\u00d710(-)(4) mm\u2009Hg(-)(1), P=0.001).

Antihypertensive drugs were divided into Ang II increasers (angiotensin-I receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics) and Ang II suppressors (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta blockers). We evaluated stroke severity during admission with the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). We performed a multivariable logistic regression with the score being dichotomized at 15. Scores of less than 15 were categorized as less severe stroke.",

    "26": "Implantable loop recorders (ILR) do not play a\u00a0pivotal role in the current guidelines on ventricular arrhythmias except in identifying rhythm-symptom correlations if ventricular arrhythmias are assumed. Before a\u00a0decision for a\u00a0pure diagnostic implantable device is made, a\u00a0thorough arrhythmic risk assessment is of major importance due to the potential lethal outcome of ventricular arrhythmias. Nevertheless, some clinical circumstances exist where long-term monitoring by an ILR may add significant information in electrical heart diseases, in patients with ventricular arrhythmias, or structural heart diseases and a\u00a0potential risk of ventricular arrhythmias. As medical therapy (\u03b2-blocker therapy) plays an important role in long QT syndrome (LQTS) and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardias (cpVT), the ILR can be used to control therapy in patients at risk. In electrical diseases without pharmacologic therapeutic options (e.\u2009g., Brugada syndrome), the ILR may be used in low-risk patients with atypical syncope as benign faints may occur without association to the underlying disease. Evidence on cardiomyopathies with preserved left ventricular function and nonsustained VT or premature ventricular complexes is scarce. The ILR may also add long-term information on the individual risk in these circumstances. In very rare diseases like infiltrative disease or muscular dystrophies, the ILR may also provide evidence on risk stratification. In summary, ILR in electrical heart diseases and in patients with ventricular tachycardia remains a\u00a0very individual decision taking into account various clinical, electrocardiographic, and genetic parameters. The following review aims at highlighting possible indications and clinical scenarios for ILR in ventricular tachycardias and electrical heart diseases with-probably debatable-case presentations.",

Cardiac cell therapy represents a promising regenerative treatment and, for autologous cell therapy, the patients clinical history may correlate with the biology of resident progenitors and the quality of the final cell product. This study aimed at uncovering correlations between clinical records of biopsy-donor CHD patients undergoing cardiac surgery and the corresponding yield and phenotype of cardiospheres (CSs) and CS-derived cells (CDCs), which are a clinically relevant population for cell therapy, containing progenitors. We describe a statistically significant association between BB therapy and improved CSs yield and CDCs phenotype. We show that BB-CDCs have a reduced fibrotic-like CD90\u2009+\u2009subpopulation, with reduced expression of collagen-I and increased expression of cardiac genes, compared to CDCs from non-BB donors. Moreover BB-CDCs had a distinctive microRNA expression profile, consistent with reduced fibrotic features (miR-21, miR-29a/b/c downregulation), and enhanced regenerative potential (miR-1, miR-133, miR-101 upregulation) compared to non-BB. In vitro adrenergic pharmacological treatments confirmed cytoprotective and anti-fibrotic effects of \u03b21-blocker on CDCs.

Sex steroids modulate fundamental immune functions, including immune cell development, differentiation and polarization, and facilitate specific immunophysiological microenvironments, such as pregnancy. The supplementation of exogenous phytoestrogens is beneficial to post-menopausal women. Stilbenes are a potent group of phytoestrogens, of which resveratrol\u00a0(Res) is a well-known representative exhibiting a variety of immunomodulatory activities, including the attenuation of autoimmune diseases and boosting anti-tumor immunity. In the present study, arachidin-1\u00a0(Ara\u20111) and Res, primary stilbenes, enriched in peanut sprouts as phytoalexins, were investigated for their immunomodulatory properties for successful aging. We found that similar to 17-\u03b2-estradiol\u00a0(E2), Ara\u20111 or Res significantly inhibited concanavalin\u00a0A\u00a0(ConA)-activated lymphoblastogenesis of cell repertories from splenic or thymic origins. However, these inhibitory effects were partially reversed by the E2 receptor blocker, tamoxifen. While the ratios of the CD4+CD25+ cell population of ConA-activated T\u00a0cell repertories were not significantly altered, treatment with E2, Ara\u20111 or Res led to an increase in the number of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein\u00a04\u00a0(CTLA-4; also known as CD152)-positive cells and in the gene expression levels of CTLA-4, Forkhead box\u00a0P3\u00a0(FoxP3), interleukin\u00a0(IL)-10 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2\u00a0(TGF-\u03b2).

CYP2D6 exhibited the highest contribution to the metabolism of R-CAR, followed by CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9, whereas the metabolism of the S-enantiomer was mainly mediated by CYP1A2, followed by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. In HLMs, metabolism of R- and S-CAR was markedly inhibited by quinidine; R-CAR metabolism (57-61% decrease) was more inhibited than S-CAR metabolism (37-43% decrease), and furafylline and ketoconazole almost equally inhibited metabolism of both enantiomers by 25-32% and 30-50%, respectively. The absence of CYP2D6 in a mixture of five major recombinant CYP isoforms at the approximate ratio as in HLMs resulted in a 42% and 25% decrease in the metabolic activities for R- and S-CAR, respectively. Moreover, the absence of CYP1A2 in the mixture resulted in a 16% and 39% decrease in the metabolic activities for R- and S-CAR, respectively. Our results suggest the stereoselective metabolism of CAR is determined by not only the activity of CYP2D6 but also of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4.",

Mortality in G. fossarum was not observed in acute toxicity testing (48\u00a0h), and a significant increase of mortality at 45\u00a0mg/L was found when amphipods were exposed chronically (40\u00a0days). The most sensitive population-relevant endpoints were the juvenile-adult ratio and number of egg-bearing females with NOEC/LOEC-values of 5/15\u00a0mg/L. No proteotoxic effects were identified in G. fossarum. The sediment toxicity test with L. variegatus according to the OECD Guideline 225 with an exposure time of 28\u00a0days resulted in EC10-values of 92.5 and 126.1\u00a0mg/kgdw for the endpoints reproduction and biomass, respectively. In L. variegatus the response kinetics of Hsp70 showed no significant difference between the treatments.

Syncope and sudden death are frequently associated with physical and emotional stress. Management of patients with LQTS consists of life-style modification, \u03b2-blockers, left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. Prohibition of competitive exercise and avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs are important issues in life-style modification. Although \u03b2-blockers are the primary treatment modality for patients with LQTS, these drugs are not completely effective in some patients. Lifelong ICD implantation in young and active patients is associated with significant complications. LCSD is a relatively simple and highly effective surgical procedure.

The G. mellonella lysozyme, similarly to its human counterpart, is a member of the c-type family of lysozymes that exhibits antibacterial and antifungal activity. However, in contrast to the relatively well explained bactericidal action, the mechanism of fungistatic and/or fungicidal activity of lysozymes is still not clear. In the present study we provide the direct evidences that the G. mellonella lysozyme binds to the protoplasts as well as to the intact C. albicans cells and decreases the survival rate of both these forms in a time-dependent manner. No enzymatic activity of the lysozyme towards typical chitinase and \u03b2-glucanase substrates was detected, indicating that hydrolysis of main fungal cell wall components is not responsible for anti-Candida activity of the lysozyme. On the other hand, pre-treatment of cells with tetraethylammonium, a potassium channel blocker, prevented them from the lysozyme action, suggesting that lysozyme acts by induction of programmed cell death.

Ivabradine is known to reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with CHF under certain conditions. Beyond the reduction of heart rate, only limited knowledge exists about potential anti-inflammatory effects of ivabradine that might contribute to its benefit in CHF. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of ivabradine on systemic inflammation. Methods. In the present study, 33 patients with CHF due to dilated, ischemic, and hypertensive cardiomyopathy were treated with ivabradine according to the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). A number of circulating dendritic cells as well as inflammatory mediators were investigated using FACS analysis and ELISA, respectively, before and during ivabradine therapy. Results. Treatment with ivabradine resulted in a significant improvement of CHF symptoms as well as an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction. Moreover, ivabradine treatment led to a significant reduction of TNF-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) serum levels and a reconstitution of circulating dendritic cells which are known to be reduced in patients with CHF.

Poly vinyl acetate (Kollicoat(\u00ae) SR 30 D - KSR) was selected for its flexibility and ammonio methacrylate copolymer (Eudragit(\u00ae) RL 30 D - ERL) because of its high permeability. Films based on KSR:ERL blends were prepared by casting or spraying aqueous dispersions of these polymers and were characterized by water uptake, dry mass loss and mechanical properties. KSR:ERL blends were investigated as coating materials to improve the robustness, mechanical strength and drug release from the HPMC matrix tablets containing propranolol HCl, caffeine and carbamazepine as model drugs. Both HPMC and the polymer coating affected the propranolol release. The release and the mechanical properties could be easily adjusted by varying the polymer blend ratio. The flexibility increased with increasing KSR content. At an 8% w/w coating level, a force of 3.2N was required to rupture the coating of the swollen tablet after 16h in the release medium; the coated tablets were thus robust to withstand gastrointestinal forces. The coating level (6%-10%, w/w) and dissolution agitation rate (50rpm to 150rpm) had no effect on the drug release. The water-insoluble carbamazepine was not released from the coated tablets as HPMC erosion, which is necessary for the release of a poorly water-soluble drug was hindered by the coating.

The aim of this study was to compare the in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of different formulations based on metoprolol, a selective adrenergic \u03b21-receptor antagonist, in dogs and rabbits and to contrast the observed differences. To that end, metoprolol (50 to 200mg) was administered to 6 Beagle dogs and 6 New Zealand White rabbits as a single intravenous (IV) bolus injection and to 8 dogs and 6 rabbits as an oral modified release formulation. To derive pharmacokinetic parameters from the data, a non-linear mixed-effects model was developed using NONMEM(\u00ae) where the contribution of observations below the limit of detection (BDL, below detection limit) to the parameter estimates was taken into account in the parameter estimation procedure. In both species and for the three modified release formulations, different absorption models were tested to describe the PK of metoprolol following oral dosing. In Beagle dogs, plasma concentration-time profiles were best described using a sequential zero- and first-order absorption model. In rabbits though, the absorption phase was best described using a first-order process only. In both species, the reservoir formulation ZOK-ZID(\u00ae) was behaving quite similarly. In contrast, the absorption properties of both matrix formulations were rather different between species. This study indicates that the PK of the reservoir formulation is similar in both species, even after accounting for the almost completely missed absorption phase in rabbits. The insights gained further illustrate that rabbits are not very well suited to study the PK of the current matrix formulations in view of their less optimal prolonged release characteristics and the resulting fast decline in metoprolol plasma levels.",

Pharmacological inhibition of the formation of autophagosomes with 3-methyladenine or of autophagolysosomes with a lysosomal functional blocker, bafilomycin A1, induced a similar increase in collagen protein levels, while inhibition of the proteasome by MG132 had no effects on collagen I accumulation. In addition, CD38-deficiency did not change the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP-9) or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in CAMs. Confocal microscopy showed that collagen I deposition was mainly lied within lysosomes or autophagosomes in CD38(-/-) or TGF-Beta treated CAMs. Collagen I deposition increased when CAMs lack CD38 expression or if autophagy was blocked, which is associated with impaired autophagic degradation of collagen I.

In this study, rats were treated with metformin alone or in combination with metoprolol. Plasma, urine and tissue concentrations of metformin were determined by HPLC. Western blotting and real-time qPCR were used to evaluate the expression of rOCTs and rMATE1. The results showed that, after single or 7-day repeated administration, the plasma concentrations of metformin in the co-administration group were significantly decreased compared with that in the metformin group. However, the parameter V/F of metformin in the co-administration group was markedly increased compared with that in the metformin group. The hepatic, renal and muscular Kp of metformin were markedly elevated after co-administration with metoprolol. Consistently, metformin uptake in rat kidney slices was significantly induced by metoprolol. In addition, multiple administrations of metoprolol significantly reduced the expression of rMATE1 in rat kidney as well as the urinary excretion of metformin. Importantly, after long-term administration, lactic acid and uric acid levels in the co-administration group were increased by 25% and 26%, respectively, compared with that in the metformin group. These results indicate that metoprolol can decrease the plasma concentration of metformin via the induction of hepatic, renal and muscular uptake, and long-term co-administration of metformin and metoprolol can cause elevated lactic acid and uric acid levels.

End-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume, and ejection fraction (EF) were calculated by use of the Teichholz method for 1-D echocardiography, single-plane and biplane modified Simpson method of disks (MOD) and area-length method for 2-D echocardiography, and real-time biplane echocardiography (RTBPE) and real-time 3-D echocardiography (RT3DE) for 3-D echocardiography. Volumes were indexed to body surface area and body weight. Median values, correlations, and limits of agreement were compared between echocardiographic modalities and MDCT.

    "157": "Among patients on dialysis, hypertension is highly prevalent and contributes to the high burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Strict volume control via sodium restriction and probing of dry weight are first-line approaches for the treatment of hypertension in this population; however, antihypertensive drug therapy is often needed to control BP. Few trials compare head-to-head the superiority of one antihypertensive drug class over another with respect to improving BP control or altering cardiovascular outcomes; accordingly, selection of the appropriate antihypertensive regimen should be individualized. To individualize therapy, consideration should be given to intra- and interdialytic pharmacokinetics, effect on cardiovascular reflexes, ability to treat comorbid illnesses, and adverse effect profile. \u03b2-Blockers followed by dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are our first- and second-line choices for antihypertensive drug use. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers seem to be reasonable third-line choices, because the evidence base to support their use in patients on dialysis is sparse. Add-on therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in specific subgroups of patients on dialysis (i.e., those with severe congestive heart failure) seems to be another promising option in anticipation of the ongoing trials evaluating their efficacy and safety. Adequately powered, multicenter, randomized trials evaluating hard cardiovascular end points are urgently warranted to elucidate the comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive drug classes in patients on dialysis. In this review, we provide an overview of the randomized evidence on pharmacotherapy of hypertension in patients on dialysis, and we conclude with suggestions for future research to address critical gaps in this important area.", 
    "158": "Bacterial infection is highly prevalent in patients who have had a stroke. Despite the potential contribution of micro-aspiration in post-stroke pneumonia, we found that the majority of the microorganisms detected in the patients who developed infections after having a stroke were common commensal bacteria that normally reside in the intestinal tracts. In a mouse model of ischemic stroke, post-stroke infection was only observed in mice that were born and raised in specific-pathogen-free facilities; this was not seen in mice that were born and raised in germ-free facilities. Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, we provide evidence demonstrating that the source of the bacteria forming the microbial community in the lungs of post-stroke mice was indeed the host small intestine. Additionally, stroke-induced gut barrier permeability and dysfunction preceded the dissemination of orally inoculated bacteria to peripheral tissues. This study identifies a novel pathway in which stroke promotes the translocation and dissemination of selective strains of bacteria that originated from the host gut microbiota.", 
    "159": "Activation of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is important for tumor metastasis. Although growth factors such as TGF\u03b2 and EGF have been shown to induce EMT in breast epithelial cells, the mechanism resulting in migration is not well understood. Herein, we provide evidence that Ca2+ entry into the cell, especially upon store-depletion, plays an important role in TGF\u03b2-induced EMT by promoting cellular migration and potentially leading to metastasis. The increased migration by TGF\u03b2 in non-cancerous cells was due to the loss of E-cadherin along with a subsequent increase in N-cadherin levels. Importantly, TGF\u03b2-treatment increases store-mediated Ca2+ entry, which was essential for the activation of calpain leading to the loss of E-cadherin and MMP activation. Inhibition of Ca2+ entry by using Ca2+ channel blocker SKF-96365, significantly decreased Ca2+ entry, decreased TGF\u03b2-induced calpain activation, and suppressed the loss of E-cadherin along with inhibiting cell migration. Furthermore, TRPC1 function as an endogenous Ca2+ entry channel and silencing of either TRPC1 or its activator, STIM1, significantly decreased TGF\u03b2 induced Ca2+ entry, inhibited TGF\u03b2-mediated calpain activation and cell migration. In contrast, overexpression of TRPC1 showed increased Ca2+ entry and promoted TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migration. Moreover, increased TRPC1 expression was observed in ductal carcinoma cells. Together these results suggest that disrupting Ca2+ influx via TRPC1/STIM1 mechanism reduces calpain activity, which could restore intercellular junction proteins thereby inhibiting EMT induced motility.",

Low doses (10 and 20\u00a0mg\u00b7kg(-1) \u00b7day(-1) ) significantly inhibit tumour growth, whereas higher doses are progressively less effective. We also found that high-dose propranolol stimulates tumour arteriogenesis whereas no effect on angiogenesis was observed at any dose. Based on these data and considering that propranolol is a vasoactive drug, we hypothesized that it causes systemic vasoconstriction or vasodilation depending on the dose and thus alters tumour perfusion and growth.

The effectiveness of low-frequency electroacupuncture in the treatment of metabolic disorders associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an endocrine-metabolic disorder characterized by an imbalance in sex steroid production, is controversial. What is the main finding and its importance? In a rat model of PCOS induced by the inhibition of P450 aromatase, low-frequency electroacupuncture increased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol but did not improve the insulin resistance or the adipose tissue dysfunction, suggesting that a balance of sex steroids is needed to restore the metabolic function in this rat model of PCOS. Low-frequency electroacupuncture restores sex steroid synthesis and sympathetic activity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, which may ameliorate its metabolic disturbances, probably by modulating sympathetic nerve activity or sex steroid synthesis. We investigated whether low-frequency electroacupuncture regulates the metabolic function to the same extent as treatment with estradiol or \u03b2-adrenergic blocking in a rat model of polycystic ovary syndrome induced by a P450 aromatase inhibitor (letrozole). Letrozole (200\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0day(-1) ) or placebo pellets were implanted in prepubertal Wistar rats. Six weeks thereafter, rats were treated for 5-6\u00a0weeks with the following: low-frequency electroacupuncture (5\u00a0days per week); a \u03b2-adrenergic blocker (propranolol hydrochloride, 0.1\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) , 5\u00a0days per week); or 17\u03b2-estradiol (2.0\u00a0\u03bcg) every fourth day. Body weight development, body composition, locomotor activity, insulin sensitivity, tissue-specific glucose uptake, lipid profile, adipocyte size, serum concentrations of adiponectin and insulin, and gene expression in inguinal fat were measured. All treatments increased circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Estradiol treatment restored locomotor activity and increased insulin sensitivity but did not modify the glucose uptake in muscle and fat. An upregulation of genes related to insulin sensitivity and downregulation of genes related to adipogenesis were observed in subcutaneous adipose tissue from rats exposed to letrozole. Only estradiol treatment normalized the expression of these genes. In conclusion, low-frequency electroacupuncture increased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol without affecting insulin sensitivity or adipose tissue function, which could suggest effects on hepatic lipid regulation, probably mediated by the action of estradiol or the \u03b2-adrenergic pathway.",

Genetic screening revealed a novel mutation in Kir2.1 (c.665T>C, p.L222S). Functional studies showed that this mutation reduced ionic currents in a dominant-negative manner.

A dilated aortic root (>40 to 45\u00a0mm) is considered a relative contraindication for pregnancy. We investigated the risk for aortic dissection and pregnancy outcome in patients with MS. Women with MS who attended our cardiology high-risk pregnancy clinic from 2006 to 2015 were followed clinically and with serial echocardiograms by a multidisciplinary team. Beta blockers were offered and titrated by blood pressure and heart rate. Patients with aortic root dilation \u226540\u00a0mm were considered high-risk patients with MS. A consistent increase in aortic root diameter of >1\u00a0mm during pregnancy was classified as dilation during pregnancy; 31 pregnancies in 19 patients with MS were followed. Four pregnancies were terminated early because of prenatal diagnosis of fetal MS and 4 additional babies born with MS. Eight pregnancies were in patients with a dilated aortic root (40 to 46\u00a0mm); 21 patients (68%) were treated with \u03b2 blockers. There were 2 cases of postpartum aortic dissection (6.5%): 1 type A dissection in a woman with a dilated aortic root who declined \u03b2 blockers (1 of 8, 12.5%) and 1 type B dissection. Increasing aortic root diameter (>1\u00a0mm) in pregnancy was significantly associated with later aortic dissection (2 of 6 vs 0 of 21, p\u00a0= 0.04). No maternal deaths occurred. All high-risk women with MS gave birth by cesarean section, whereas in the non-high-risk group mode of delivery was by obstetric indication. Preterm delivery rate was 41% (11 of 27). One antenatal fetal death and no major neonatal morbidity or mortality were observed. In conclusion, pregnant patients with MS, especially those with a dilating aortic root, are at high risk of aortic dissection, even with tight control of blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "177": "Apelin has been proved to be a critical mediator of vascular function and homeostasis. Here, we investigated roles of Apelin in aortic remodeling and fibrosis in rats with transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to TAC and then randomized to daily deliver Apelin-13 (50\u03bcg/kg) or angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1) blocker Irbesartan (50mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Pressure overload resulted in myocardial hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction, aortic remodeling and adventitial fibrosis with reduced levels of Apelin in ascending aortas of rat after TAC compared with sham-operated group. These changes were associated with marked increases in levels of miRNA-122, TGF\u03b21, CTGF, NFAT5, LGR4, and \u03b2-catenin. More importantly, Apelin and Irbesartan treatment strikingly prevented TAC-mediated aortic remodeling and adventitial fibrosis in pressure overloaded rats by blocking AT1 receptor and miRNA-122 levels and repressing activation of the CTGF-NFAT5 and LGR4-\u03b2-catenin signaling. In cultured primary rat adventitial fibroblasts, exposure to angiotensin II (100nmolL(-1)) led to significant increases in cellular migration and levels of TGF\u03b21, CTGF, NFAT5, LGR4 and \u03b2-catenin, which were effectively reversed by pre-treatment with Apelin (100nmolL(-1)) and miRNA-122 inhibitor (50nmolL(-1)). In conclusion, Apelin counterregulated against TAC-mediated ascending aortic remodeling and angiotensin II-induced promotion of cellular migration by blocking AT1 receptor and miRNA-122 levels and preventing activation of the TGF\u03b21-CTGF-NFAT5 and LGR4-\u03b2-catenin signaling, ultimately contributing to attenuation of aortic adventitial fibrosis.

The resulting TM-CHL was the most promising formulation with a mean particle size of 150.7nm and an EE% of 75.83\u00b11.61%. In vitro release of the TM-CHL showed an extended drug release profile. The TM-CHL exhibited significant mucin adhesion and compared with commercial eye drops, TM-CHL produced a 3.18-fold increase in the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp), resulting in a significant enhancement of corneal permeation. In addition, the gamma scintigraphic study and the pharmacokinetic study showed that TM-CHL could be retained at the corneal surface for longer time compared with eye drops. The ocular irritation study indicated that the developed liposomes produced no significant irritant effects. Furthermore, pharmacodynamics results showed that the maximum intraocular pressure(IOP) produced by TM-CHL was (19.67\u00b11.14) mmHg compared with the (23.80\u00b11.49) mmHg for TM eye drops, revealing that TM-CHL was more effective in reducing the IOP.

Determination of asymmetrical dimethylarginine concentrations and total protein carbonyls in the aorta were analyzed. Esmolol significantly attenuated abnormal aortic wall thickness, cross-sectional area, wall-to-lumen ratio, volume density of elastic fibers, and wall stiffness. The protective effect of esmolol could be related to a decrease in asymmetrical dimethylarginine levels after down-regulation by oxidative stress.

Despite its important role in arrhythmogenesis, the mechanism underlying Ca(2+) alternans remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), the major Ca(2+) release channel responsible for cytosolic Ca(2+) transients, in cardiac alternans. Using a unique mouse model harboring a suppression-of-function (SOF) RyR2 mutation (E4872Q), we assessed the effect of genetically suppressing RyR2 function on Ca(2+) and action potential duration (APD) alternans in intact hearts, and electrocardiogram (ECG) alternans in vivo We found that RyR2-SOF hearts displayed prolonged sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release refractoriness and enhanced propensity for Ca(2+) alternans. RyR2-SOF hearts/mice also exhibited increased propensity for APD and ECG alternans. Caffeine, which enhances RyR2 activity and the propensity for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), suppressed Ca(2+) alternans in RyR2-SOF hearts, whereas carvedilol, a \u03b2-blocker that suppresses RyR2 activity and CPVT, promoted Ca(2+) alternans in these hearts. Thus, RyR2 function is an important determinant of Ca(2+), APD, and ECG alternans. Our data also indicate that the activity of RyR2 influences the propensity for cardiac alternans and CPVT in an opposite manner. Therefore, overly suppressing or enhancing RyR2 function is pro-arrhythmic.",

Recently, three new drug principles have been approved for clinical use, the \u03b23 -adrenoceptor agonist, mirabegron, the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, tadalafil and the blocker of afferent and efferent nerves, botulinum toxin. However, new alternatives are continuously being explored. OAB is a filling disorder, and ATP is involved in the generation of afferent impulses. One way of blocking the ATP afferent pathway is through the use of P2X3 receptor antagonists. In animal models, this strategy appears to work very well, but whether it translates effectively to man remains to be established. Evidence suggests that components of the endocannabinoid system are involved in regulation of bladder function. Clinical studies of cannabinoid extracts on LUTS are scarce and essentially restricted to patients with MS, and the results have so far not been convincing. Amplification of endocannabinoid activity by inhibiting their degradation via fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitors may be an attractive approach, but no clinical experiences in OAB have been reported. Studies of the lower urinary tract have indicated that several transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, including TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV4, TRPM8 and TRPA1, are expressed in the bladder and may act as sensors of stretch and/or chemical irritation. Animal studies have shown that inhibition of these pathways can be effective for the reduction in bladder activity. However, the roles of these channels for normal function and in pathological states have not been established, and so far adverse effects (hyperthermia) have hampered development of antagonists.", 
    "194": "In a previous study on a xenograft model of melanoma, we showed that the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol inhibits melanoma development by modulating angiogenesis, proliferation and cell survival. Stress hormones can influence tumor development in different ways and norepinephrine was shown to downregulate antitumor immune responses by favoring the accumulation of immunosuppressive cells, impairing the function of lymphocytes. We assessed the effect of propranolol on antitumor immune response in the MT/Ret mouse model of melanoma. Propranolol treatment delayed primary tumor growth and metastases development in MT/Ret mice. Consistent with our previous observations in human melanoma xenografts, propranolol induces a decrease in cell proliferation and vessel density in the primary tumors and in metastases. In this immunocompetent model, propranolol significantly reduced the infiltration of myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils, in the primary tumor. Inversely, cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were more frequent in the tumor stroma of treated mice. In a consistent manner, we observed the same shift in the proportions of infiltrating leukocytes in the metastases of treated mice. Our results suggest that propranolol, by decreasing the infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, restores a better control of the tumor by cytotoxic cells.",

That means dl-sotalol produced no inotropy, although it decreased load-dependent inotropic parameters, including maximal upstroke velocity of left ventricular pressure, attributable to decreased heart rate and blood pressure. Other typical pharmacological effects of the compounds tested were also detected. Both \u03b2-blockers produced PR prolongation, decreased left ventricular end-systolic pressure, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and increased maximal descending velocity of left ventricular pressure and time constant for isovolumic relaxation. dl-Sotalol also prolonged heart-rate-corrected QT interval.

Previously, we established a novel prediction system of drug intestinal absorption in humans, using the mini-Ussing chamber equipped with human intestinal tissues. In this system, the TI value was defined as the sum of drug amounts transported to the basal-side component (X(corr)) and drug amounts accumulated in the tissue (T(corr)), which are normalized by AUC of a drug in the apical compartment, as an index for drug absorption. In order to apply this system to the screening assay, it is important to understand the differences between animal and human tissues in the intestinal absorption of drugs. In this study, the transport index (TI) values of three drugs, with different levels of membrane permeability, were determined to evaluate the rank order of drug absorbability in intestinal tissues from rats, dogs, and monkeys. The TI values in small intestinal tissues in rats and dogs showed a good correlation with those in humans. On the other hand, the correlation of TI values in monkeys was lower compared to rats and dogs. The rank order of the correlation coefficient between human and investigated animal tissues was as follows: dog (r(2)=0.978), rat (r(2)=0.955), and monkey (r(2)=0.620). TI values in large intestinal tissues from rats (r(2)=0.929) and dogs (r(2)=0.808) also showed a good correlation. The obtained TI values in small intestinal tissues in rats and dogs were well correlated with the fraction of drug absorbed (Fa) in humans. From these results, the mini-Ussing chamber, equipped with intestinal tissues in rats and dogs, would be useful as a screening tool in the drug discovery stage. In addition, the obtained TI values can be used for the prediction of the Fa in humans.",

A transient bradycardia prior to the AB is followed by sustained tachycardia during breath-hold. This study evaluated air-breathing and cardiac responses to sustained aerobic exercise in juveniles (total length~20cm), and how exercise influenced variations in fH associated with AB. In particular, it investigated the role of adrenergic and cholinergic control in cardiac responses, and effects of pharmacological abolition of this control on air-breathing responses. Sustained exercise at 15, 30 and 45cms(-1) in a swim tunnel caused significant increases in fAB and fH, from approximately 5breathsh(-1) and 60heartbeatsmin(-1) at the lowest speed, to over 60breathsh(-1) and 100beatsmin(-1) at the highest, respectively. There was a progressive decline in the degree of variation in fH, around each AB, as fAB increased with exercise intensity. Total autonomic blockade abolished all variation in fH during exercise, and around each AB, but fAB responses were the same as in untreated animals. Cardiac responses were exclusively due to modulation of inhibitory cholinergic tone, which varied from >100% at the lowest speed to <10% at the highest. Cholinergic blockade had no effect on fAB compared to untreated fish. Excitatory \u03b2-adrenergic tone was approximately 20% and did not vary with swimming speed, but its blockade increased fAB at all speeds, compared to untreated animals. This reveals complex effects of autonomic control on air-breathing during exercise in C. gariepinus, which deserve further investigation.",

Dectin-1 is a \u03b2-glucan (including LNT) receptor that regulates immune functions in many immune cell types. Cumulative evidence has suggested that the glutamatergic system seems to play an important role in the treatment of depression. Here, we studied the antidepressant-like effects of LNT and its therapeutical target in regulating the functions of AMPA receptors. We found that 60min treatment with LNT leads to a significant antidepressant-like effect in the tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swim test (FST) in mice. The antidepressant-like effects of LNT in TST and FST remained after 1day or 5days of injections. Additionally, LNT did not show a hyperactive effect in the open field test. Dectin-1 receptor levels were increased after LNT treatment for 5days and the specific Dectin-1 inhibitor laminarin was able to block the antidepressant-like effects of LNT. After 5days of treatment, LNT enhanced p-GluR1 (S845) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); however, the total GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 expression levels remained unchanged. We also found that the AMPA-specific blocker GYKI 52466 was able to block the antidepressant-like effects of LNT.

This recommendation is primarily based on two landmark trials, the RALES trial (for spironolactone) and the EMPHASIS-HF trial (for eplerenone). A crucial question is, however, why MRAs are advised only in \"third place,\" i.e., after optimal up-titration of ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers.

    "210": "Primarily, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors suppress the cotransport of glucose and sodium from the tubular lumen of the proximal tubules to the blood, and excrete glucose into the urine. Therefore, glucose and caloric balances become negative, reducing both the blood glucose level and insulin secretion. On the other hand, the proximal tubular fluid, constituted with low chloride concentration because of SGLT2 inhibition, is transferred to the loop of Henle. Under low chloride conditions, the reabsorption mechanisms in the loop of Henle do not work, similar to when loop diuretics are given. Subanalysis data on heart failure (HF) from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trials are discussed, assuming that SGLT2 inhibitors are loop diuretics. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers contribute to prognostic improvements of HF, independent of SGLT2 inhibitors, and therefore, both regimens are essential for the treatment of HF. On the other hand, the prognostic improvements by SGLT2 inhibitors are not significant under treatment including conventional diuretics such as loop diuretics and aldosterone antagonists, suggesting that the prognostic improvement in HF by SGLT2 inhibitors is mostly through their diuretic action.

To investigate the relationship between low HRVO (SD\u00a0<\u00a00.5 BPM) during surgical procedures and mortality within 48\u00a0h post-procedure. We retrospectively reviewed all adult general surgical procedures performed at our center from January 1, 2003 through July 1, 2013 to identify patients who died within 48\u00a0h post-procedure. Demographic, heart rate, and mortality data were extracted from the electronic anesthesia record. Propensity score analysis was used to find matching controls based on age, gender, ASA score, anesthesia type, Charlson index, procedure type, emergency status, year, use of preoperative beta blocker, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation and heart failure. HRVO was calculated for each 5\u00a0min interval as the SD of all HR's within that interval. Negative binomial regression was then used to model the count of intervals with HRVO\u00a0<\u00a00.5 BPM for the duration of the surgery. During the 10\u00a0year study period, 283 patients died within 48\u00a0h of procedure finish. These patients were matched to 566 patients who did not die within 48\u00a0h after procedure.

Emerging evidence suggests that human renal organic cation transporter 2 (hOCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins 1 and 2-K (hMATE1/2-K) exhibit substrate-dependent inhibition, but their impact on renal drug secretion and intracellular accumulation is unknown. Using metformin and atenolol as the probe substrates, we found that the classic inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) of renal organic cation secretion were approximately 10-fold more potent for hOCT2 when atenolol was used, suggesting that atenolol is a more sensitive in vitro substrate for hOCT2 than metformin. In contrast, inhibition of hMATE1/2-K was influenced much less by the choice of substrate. Cimetidine is a much more potent inhibitor for hMATE1/2-K when metformin is the substrate but acts as an equally potent inhibitor of hOCT2 and hMATE1/2-K when atenolol is the substrate. Using hOCT2/hMATE1 double-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, we evaluated the impact of substrate-dependent inhibition on hOCT2/hMATE1-mediated transepithelial flux and intracellular drug accumulation. At clinically relevant concentrations, cimetidine dose dependently inhibited basal-to-apical flux of atenolol and metformin but impacted their intracellular accumulation differently, indicating that substrate-dependent inhibition may shift the major substrate-inhibitor interaction site between apical and basolateral transporters. Cimetidine is effective only when applied to the basal compartment.

    "228": "Hypertension is currently one of the greatest global health care challenges. Although many effective drugs are available, combinations of 2 or more medications are often required to meet clinical targets. Combination therapy has several advantages over monotherapy: lower doses of each drug can be used to achieve therapeutic goals; lower doses may lead to fewer adverse events, facilitating patient adherence; and using multiple drugs with different modes of action may be more effective in treating multifactorial diseases, including hypertension. Adherence is an important consideration when requiring patients to self-administer multiple medications; as the number of concurrent medications increases, patient adherence tends to decrease. Recent evidence suggests that fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) may be more effective than free-dose combinations, as they provide all necessary medications in a single convenient tablet/single-pill combination. Among combinations of hypertension medications, a \u03b2-blocker such as bisoprolol with a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine is an effective combination therapy for hypertension, with distinct and complimentary modes of action. With advantages over free-dose combinations, the FDC of bisoprolol/amlodipine is thus an effective and convenient treatment for hypertension, allowing more patients to achieve their therapeutic goals, while potentially reducing the burden of hypertension on health care systems.",

From 2008 to 2014, we observed an increased prevalence, among TRH episodes, of \u03b2-blockers (+6.8% [79% to 85.8%]) and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (+8.1% [69.1% to 77.2%]), and a decreased prevalence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (-12.5% [60.4% to 47.9%]) and nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists (-5.0% [15% to 10%]). The prevalence of most other classes changed by <5% from 2008 to 2014. Thiazide diuretic use was largely unchanged from 2008 to 2014, with hydrochlorothiazide being by far the most prevalent thiazide diuretic; chlorthalidone use increased only modestly (+2.6% [3.8% to 6.4%]). Aldosterone antagonist use increased only modestly (+2.9% [7.3% to 10.2%]). Use of optimal regimens increased steadily (+13.8% [50.8% to 64.6%]) during the study period, whereas combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use declined (-11.4% [17.7% to 6.3%]). Our results highlight the persistent infrequent use of recommended therapies in TRH, including spironolactone and chlorthalidone, and suggest a need for better efforts to increase the use of such approaches in light of recent evidence demonstrating their efficacy.", 
    "235": "Multiple studies have compared coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) with percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for coronary revascularization. There is considerable evidence that adherence to medical therapy can affect the outcomes of therapeutic interventions. However, the long-term influence of compliance with recommended medical therapy on the comparative outcomes of CABG versus PCI remains to be defined.", 
    "236": "All non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing coronary revascularization in an 8-hospital network were followed for up to 8 years to determine medication history and major adverse cardiac events: all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and reintervention. All mortalities were checked against the Social Security Death Index. Survival curves were derived with Kaplan-Meier methods; hazard ratios were calculated with the Cox proportional hazard model; and propensity score matching was used to account for differences in patient selection.", 
    "237": "Among the 973 CABG and 2255 PCI patients, Kaplan-Meier major adverse cardiac event-free survival curves demonstrated a significant benefit for antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, and \u03b2-blocker therapy in both the CABG and PCI groups (P=0.001 for all 3 medications). Cox regression identified compliance with optimal medical therapy as a more powerful predictor of major adverse cardiac event-free survival than choice of therapy (hazard ratio for noncompliance=2.79; 95% confidence limits, 2.19-3.54; P<0.001; hazard ratio for PCI versus CABG=1.68, 95% confidence limits, 138-2.04; P<0.001). In propensity-matched patients, CABG outcomes were superior to PCI outcomes in patients nonadherent to optimal medical therapy (P=0.001) but were not different in patients adherent to optimal medical therapy (P=0.574).", 
    "238": "Regardless of coronary revascularization strategy, medication adherence has a dramatic effect on long-term outcome. Among comparable patients who adhere to optimal medical therapy, outcomes of PCI and CABG may not differ; however, among nonadherent patients, CABG affords better major adverse cardiac event-free survival. Therefore, patient compliance with medical therapy may inform clinical decision making and should be incorporated into all future comparative studies of comparative coronary revascularization strategies.", 
    "239": "Carvedilol is an anti-oxidant non-selective \u03b2-blocker used for reduction of portal blood pressure, prophylaxis of esophageal varices development and bleeding in chronic liver diseases. Recently, it exhibited potent anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, anti-proliferative and anti-carcinogenic effects. In the present study, we evaluated the possible suppressive effect of carvedilol on circulating and hepatic IL-6 levels responsible for hepatocarcinogenesis in a rat model of hepatic cirrhosis. Besides, its effect on hepatic STAT-3 levels, function tests, oxidative stress markers, and hydroxyproline content, hepatic tissue histopathological changes and immunohistochemical expression of E & N-cadherin. Nine-week-old male Wistar rats injected intraperitoneal by 1ml/kg 10% CCL4 in olive oil three times/week (every other day) for 12weeks to induce hepatic cirrhosis. Carvedilol (10mg/kg/day suspended in 0.5% CMC orally), silymarin (50mg/kg/day suspended in 0.5% CMC orally) or combination of both used to treat hepatic cirrhosis from 15th to 84th day. Our data showed that carvedilol and silymarin co-treatment each alone or in combination efficiently reduced the elevated serum IL-6, ALT, AST, ALP and BIL, hepatic IL-6, STAT-3, MDA levels and hydroxyproline content. In addition, it elevated the reduced serum ALB level, hepatic CAT activity and GSH level. Meanwhile, it apparently restored the normal hepatic architecture, collagen distribution and immunohistochemical E & N-cadherin expression. Furthermore, carvedilol was superior to silymarin in improving MDA level. Moreover, the combination of carvedilol and silymarin showed an upper hand in amelioration of the CCL4 induced hepatotoxicity than each alone. Therefore, carvedilol could be promising in prevention of hepatocarcinogenesis in chronic hepatic injuries.", 
    "240": "Collagen type \u2161 (col \u2161) and aggrecan, the main components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in human joint cartilage, have been reported to be reduced by chronic production of inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 in arthritic joints. Carvedilol, a licensed medicine, has been used for treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure and coronary disease in clinics. In this study, we investigated the effects of Carvedilol on the expression of col \u2161 and aggrecan. Our results demonstrate that treatment with Carvedilol didn't change the expression of aggrecan or col \u2161 at mRNA levels in SW1353 chondrocytes. However, the expression of aggrecan and Col II at protein levels were significantly reduced by IL-1\u03b2 treatment, which were reversed by Carvedilol in a dose dependent manner, suggesting the inhibitory effects of Carvedilol on the expression of aggrecan and Col II are at post-translational modification levels. In addition, it was shown that IL-1\u03b2 treatment highly induced MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression in SW1353 chondrocytes at both gene and protein expression levels, which were restored by Carvedilol in a dose dependent manner. Mechanistically, exposure to IL-1\u03b2 increased phosphorylation of IKK-\u03b1/\u03b2 and degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 in SW1353 chondrocytes, which were suppressed by pretreatment with Carvedilol. Administration of Carvedilol inhibited IL-1\u03b2-induced translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 from cytosol to nucleus manner. Notably, a luciferase reporter assay showed that IL-1\u03b2 severely increased NF-\u03baB luciferase activity, which was markedly suppressed by Carvedilol treatment. Our results suggest that Carvedilol might be a potential therapeutic agent for chondro-protective therapy.", 
    "241": "Patients with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) exhibit severe phenotypes that are characterized by congenital deafness, very long QT intervals, and high risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Current treatment strategies include high doses of beta-blocker medication, left cardiac sympathetic denervation, and ICD placement, which is challenging in young children.", 
    "242": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effect of pacing in addition to beta-blocker treatment in children with JLNS.", 
    "243": "All genetically confirmed patients with JLNS born since 1999 in Norway were included in the study. Data on history of long QT syndrome-related symptoms, QT interval, and beta-blocker and pacemaker treatment were recorded.", 
    "244": "A total of 9 patients with QT intervals ranging from 510 to 660 ms were identified. Eight patients developed long QT syndrome-related symptoms, and 1 patient died before diagnosis. The survivors received beta-blocker medication. Seven patients also received a pacemaker; 1 had a ventricular lead and 6 had atrial leads. The patient with the ventricular lead died during follow-up. The 6 patients with atrial leads survived without events at a mean follow-up of 6.9 years after pacemaker implantation. Two patients received prophylactic upgrade to a 2-chamber ICD.", 
    "245": "No arrhythmic events occurred in 6 very young JLNS patients who received atrial pacing in combination with increased doses of beta-blockers during 7-year follow-up. If confirmed in additional patients, this treatment strategy may prevent life-threatening arrhythmias in this high-risk patient group and may act as a bridge to insertion of a 2-chamber ICD when left cardiac sympathetic denervation is not available."
