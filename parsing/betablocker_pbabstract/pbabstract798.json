The chronotropic and inotropic effects of dopamine were analysed by using reserpine, desmethylimipramine (DMI), cocaine and phenoxybenzamine, and the relative chronotropic and inotropic effects defined, the results being compared with those for noradrenaline (NA). 2 The effects of dopamine administered intra-arterially into the isolated preparations were reduced by pretreatment of animals with reserpine both in the papillary muscle and sinus node. The chronotropic effects, however, were affected less by pretreatment with reserpine than were the inotropic effects. 3 Desmethylimipramine (DMI) reduced the inotropic and chronotropic effects of dopamine, and enhanced the effects of NA and nerve stimulation; the chronotropic effects of the amines were less affected than the inotropic effects. 4 Cocaine enhanced considerably the inotropic and chronotropic effects of NA, and decreased the inotropic but not the chronotropic effect of dopamine. 5 Phenoxybenzamine enhanced the inotropic effects of dopamine, NA and nerve stimulation, but did not affect the chronotropic effects of the amines. 6 When dopamine (1 to 300 mug/kg) was administered intravenously to the donor dog, it increased preferentially the contractile force of the ventricular myocardium with a comparatively small change of the sinus rate in the isolated preparations as well as in the heart in vivo. NA (0.1 to 10 mug/kg) caused effects similar to those of dopamine. The maximal inotropic responses to these catecholamines were reached with lower doses than the chronotropic ones. 7 It is concluded that both the positive inotropic and the positive chronotropic responses to dopamine are mediated partially by a direct and partially by an indirect stimulant effect on beta-adrenoceptors in the dog heart. The present results suggest that the difference in activity of dopamine and NA between the ventricular myocardium and the sinus node may be ascribed to the unequal innervation with adrenergic nerve fibres of the atrium and the ventricle (Furnival, Linden & Snow, 1971). The sinus node which is densely innervated by adrenergic nerve fibres may inactivate noradrenaline and dopamine more effectively than the ventricular myocardium through the uptake into the nerve and thereby be less sensitive to the exogenous catecholamines.", 
    "1": "The elimination of sotalol was studied in 25 patients with chronic renal failure. All patients were given a single 160 mg dose of sotalol orally and their sotalol serum levels were determined after 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours. The elmination of sotalol was distinctly slower as the serum creatinine concentration rose. The half-lives, calculated graphically, were in lenear ratio to the serum creatinine values (r = 0,91; p less than 0.001). In accordance with the results, it is probable that sotalol accumulates in chronic renal insufficiency. Since beta-blockers may impair renal function, even in therapeutic concentrations, the dosage of sotalol, in particular, must be reduced in patient with kidney disease.",

    "3": "Injection of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (nialamide) into the uterus of an anaesthetized and laparotomized rat on day 20 of pregnancy severely disturbed parturition. Injection of the solvent (0-9% isotonic NaCl solution) at the same stage of gestation produced the same but less frequent disturbances. When the rats were injected on days 19 or 21, impairment was less marked than on day 20. Therefore, day 20 seems to be a critical period for the onset of parturition. Injection of Ringer solution into the uterus on day 20 had effects analogous to those of saline injection at the same stage. Anaesthesia induced with ether, laparotomy of the pregnant rat on day 20, and handling of the uterine horns without injection of either Ringer or NaCl also disturbed parturition in 70% of the rats treated. Nevertheless, disorders were not as severe as those after injection. Laparotomy alone on day 20 did not disturb parturition. The effects on parturition of a saline injection into the uterus on day 20 were greatly decreased when the injection was performed on pregnant rats adrenalectomized on day 14, or on pregnant rats pretreated on days 18 and 19 with an agent blocking the adrenergic beta receptors (propranolol); 70-80% of the treated rats had normal deliveries. In control rats, uterine catecholamine levels were markedly modified between days 21 and 22 of gestation. These changes did not occur in rats injected with MAO inhibitor or saline.", 
    "4": "1. The effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline on renin secretion in the isolated perfuseed rat kidney was examined. The doses of catecholamines used were such that renal vasoconstriction and therefore increases in renal perfusion pressure were avoided. Under these conditions adrenaline and noradrenaline significantly increased renin secretion rates, compared with control experiments in which no catecholamine was infused. 2. Mean renal perfusion pressure during both adrenaline and noradrenaline infusion paralleled the control study by showing a progressive fall. 3. Administration of phenoxybenzamine did not impair the stimulation of renin secretion by adrenaline whereas this was prevented by racemic propranolol. 4. These observations suggest that catecholamines stimulate renin secretion by an intrarenal effect which is largely independent of changes in renal perfusion pressure. It is postulated that the beta-adrenoceptors mediating renin secretion are an integral component of the renin-producing cell.", 
    "5": "The effects of route of administration and blood flow on the elimination of lidocaine, diphenylhydantoin and propranolol have been investigated in the isolated perfused rat liver. After administration directly into the portal vein, drug concentrations in the reservoir were the same at a given flow rate as concentrations in the hepatic vein after drug was placed directly into the reservoir. The apparent clearance of the drug calculated from these concentrations gave an estimate of intrinsic drug clearance, which is an estimate of the activity of the drug-metabolizing enzymes. Intrinsic clearance is defined as drug clearance when flow is not rate limiting and therefore should be independent of flow. This was confirmed by showing that, at steady state, neither hepatic venous drug concentrations nor concentrations in the reservoir after portal venous administration of lidocaine were affected by altering hepatic blood flow from 10 to 20 ml/min. Propranolol was given as a single dose into the reservoir at flows of 10 and 20 ml/min. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in the reservoir was decreased by increased flow, but AUC for hepatic venous blood was unchanged. Although AUC in hepatic venous blood was unchanged. Although AUC in hepatic venous blood was unchanged, higher peak concentrations and a more rapid half-life was seen in keeping with the clearance of drug from the reservoir. These data suggest that after oral drug administration, steady-state concentrations or AUC in systemic blood is dependent only on the activity of the enzymes involved (i.e., intrinsic clearance) and unaffected by flow, provided drug is completely absorbed and eliminated only by the liver. Furthermore, this will apply even to drugs whose systemic clearance and drug half-life after i.v. administration is profoundly affected by altered hepatic blood flow.", 
    "6": "Ischemic contracture of the left ventricle (\"stone heart\") is a recognized complication of prolonged periods of interruption of the coronary circulation during open-heart surgery. We have examined the effects of moderate hypothermia (28 degrees C.) and preoperative beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 0.5 mg. per kilogram; 1.0 mg. per kilogram) on contracture development during ischemic arrest of the heart. Four groups of 8 dogs each were placed on total cardiopulmonary bypass, and ischemic arrest of the heart was produced by cross-clamping the ascending aorta and venting the left ventricle. Intramyocardial carbon dioxide tension was continuously monitored by mass spectrometry. When anaerobic energy production ceased, as indicated by a final plateau in the intramyocardial carbon dioxide accumulation curve, the ischemic arrest was terminated and the contractile state of the heart observed. These results are given in the text. We conclude that beta-adrenergic blockade delays, but does not prevent, the onset of ischemic contracture of the left ventricle under normothermic conditions. Moderate hypothermia appears to prevent this complication completely.", 
    "7": "The adrenergic neurohumors, when present locally in the myocardium in high concentrations, can produce a variety of cardiac arrhythmias which may develop into ventricular fibrillation (VF). Of particular importance are the arrhythmias observed immediately after experimentally induced acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Fatal VF, often seen to occur after acute coronary occlusion in the canine heart, may be related to the release of endogenous catecholamines, and a similar phenomenon might be responsible for sudden coronary death (SCD) in man. If adrenergic amines play a vital role in the development of arrhythmias and VF in response to acute myocardial ischemia, then it is conceivable that pharmacological means may be undertaken in an attempt to prevent the release of the adrenergic neurotransmitter or to prevent its arrhythmogenic actions by specific blockade of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. Drugs that have a central site of action and are capable of producing a decrease in sympathetic outflow might also play a valuable role in the prevention of arrhythmias and SCD. While the activity of the autonomic nervous system can modify the type and severity of arrhythmias resulting from AMI, existing pharmacological agents have little to offer in preventing the potential adverse effects of adrenergic stimulation without compromising the level of consciousness or cardiovascular function through the removal of adrenergic support to the heart. It would seem more beneficial to direct drug therapy at the electrophysiological defect in the myocardium in an effort to prevent arrhythmias and fatal VF. While currently available antiarrhythmic agents fail to achieve the desired effect, the recent evidence dealing with the quaternary ammonium derivatives of propranolol, lidocaine, and bretylium provides some hope for the future development of drugs with antiarrhythmic as well as antifibrillatory properties which may provide a therapeutic approach to the prevention of SCD.", 
    "8": "Of 34 patients scheduled for aortocoronary bypass operations who were withdrawn from chronic propranolol therapy between 18 and 48 hours before anesthesia and operation, propranolol was detected in the plasma of nine and in atrial tissue of five patients. Higher plasma levels were associated with higher propranolol intake and with shorter time of withdrawal. In 15 patients withdrawn preoperatively from propranolol the heart rate and blood pressure response to 3 mug isoproterenol was not significantly different from the response of similar patients who had received no propranolol. In contrast to the response of healthy subjects, most patients with coronary artery disease responded to isoproterenol with a decrease in systolic blood pressure. Plasma propranolol levels after a 0.5 mg bolus given intravenously during operation produced a peak level of 40 ng/ml in one minute and disappeared in five minutes. These studies suggest that no beta blockade persists 18 hours after acute preoperative withdrawal of propranolol in patients taking up to 300 mg per day for control of angina. In view of the reported hazards of abrupt withdrawal of propranolol before operation and the reported usefulness of propranolol in treating tachyarrhythmias during operation, we suggest that early preoperative withdrawal of propranolol may be more hazardous than its continuation before coronary bypass operations.",

This description of the clinical features is bases on experience of over 200 patients and the influence of some pharmacological agents on the severity of the tremor are recounted.

    "11": "Propranolol and practolol were tested in patients with repeated daily occurrence of spontaneous angina. Twenty-one showed ST segment depression (type I) and 15 ST segment elevation (type II) during angina. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated in subjective (number of reported episodes of pain) and objective terms (number of episodes of electrocardiographic abnormalities documented during periods of continuous recording): practolol was fully effective in 42 per cent and propranolol in 38 per cent of type I cases; in type II angina 73 per cent of the cases fully responded to propranolol, none of the patients in this group given practolol improved. The study also showed that: (a) the effects on angina are strictly dose-dependent, and optimal results are achieved at individualized doses; (b) within the same subject the response may be preferential to one beta-blocker as opposed to the other; (c) propranolol is more effective in type II angina; (d) the occurrence of heart failure is uncommon even with high doses of beta blockers;(e) the relief of angina is due to prevention of ischaemia and not to a placebo or anaesthetic effect; (f) the prevention of ischaemia is not adequately explained by reduction of the mechanical effort and the oxygen need of the myocardium; (g) the antianginal effect is possibly dissociated from the beta blockade of the heart. The hypothesis that beta-blocking agents influence the conronary vasomotion is discussed.", 
    "12": "Comparison, in the dog, of the fibrinolytic response to adrenaline and histamine in presence of adrenergic blocking agents, suggests that adrenergic stimulation plays only a minor role in the mobilization of plasminogen activators during histamine shock.", 
    "13": "We measured the short-term effects of beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (0.2 mg/kg iv), followed by stimulation with salbutamol (200 mug inhaled), on specific airway conductance (SGaw) heart rate, and systemic blood pressure (BP) in 11 healthy subjects, and 11 symptom-free asthmatics with normal lung function values. Propranolol induced a significant bronchoconstrictor effect in both groups, stronger in asthmatics than in normals: mean SGaw decreased 34.6 +/- 25% against 9.4 +/- 9% (p less than 0.01). Six of the 11 asthmatics exhibited a more pronounced bronchoconstriction than the most responsive healthy subject. Large individual variations were seen in both groups although they were greater in the asthmatics. A similar rise in SGaw was produced by salbutamol in both groups. The decrease of heart rate provoked by propranolol was similar in the two groups, averaging 18.6%, with no further change after salbutamol. The blood pressure was slightly decreased by propranolol in both groups. The results indicate that normal subjects have a weak and variable bronchodilator beta-adrenergic activity. In most asthmatics beta-adrenergic tone appeared more pronounced. The individual differences in response to propranolol observed in both groups suggest that asthmatic patients differ quantitatively rather than qualitatively from healthy subjects with respect to beta-adrenergic receptor function. There was no association between clinical findings and the degree of bronchomotor effect of propranolol in the patients with asthma. This study does not support the view that airways of asthmatic patients have a decreased beta-adrengeric receptor function.", 
    "14": "The effects of halothane, enflurane, and methoxyflurane on hypocapnic bronchoconstriction (increased airway resistance and decreased compliance of the lung) were studied in vivo in the isolated left lower lobe of the canine lung. Hypocapnic bronchoconstriction, induced by altering the concentration of CO2 in gas ventilating the lobe, was repeated in the presence and absence of various concentrations of anesthetic gases (halothane: 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 per cent; enflurane: 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 per cent; methoxyflurane: 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 per cent). In the higher concentrations, all three drugs blocked the bronchoconstrictor effect produced when the inspired CO2 was decreased from 5 to 0 per cent. In lower concentrations, halothane was the most effective blocking drug. Propranolol did not affect the ability of the three anesthetics to block hypocapnic bronchoconstriction, nor did the beta-receptor blocking drug sotalol affect the blocking effects of halothane. The ability of these anesthetics to block hypocapnic bronchoconstriction probably is mediated not through an adrenergic mechanism but by one that is nonspecific. (Key words: Lung, bronchoconstriction; Carbon dioxide, hypocarbia; Anesthetics, volatile, halothane; Anesthetics, volatile, enflurane; Anesthetics, volatile, methoxyflurane.)", 
    "15": "Diethylstilbestrol (DES) and 17beta-estradiol elicit significant increases in levels of endogenous and [14C]cyclic AMP in [14C]adeninelabeled hypothalami from immature female rats, but only after incubation of the hypothalami with these estrogenic agents for 40-50 min. Estriol has no effect. The 2-fold accumulation of cyclic AMP elicited by low concentrations (20 muM) of DES appears dependent on catecholamine-related mechanisms, since it is prevented by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic antagonists. Higher concentrations (100 muM) of DES elicit a 3-fold accumulation of [14C]cyclic AMP which is only partially blocked by adrenergic antagonists, haloperidol, or the adenosine antagonist, theophylline. These phenomena appear to be specific for the hypothalamus since incubation of cerebral cortical slabs with estrogens resulted in no significant increases in the levels of cyclic AMP. The slow time course in whole hypothalami and the complete lack of effects of low concentrations of estrogenic agents in chopped hypothalami suggest an indirect mechanism of action. Interaction of estrogens with receptors in cell bodies may result, after a latent period of 40-50 min, in enhanced release of catecholamines from distal synaptic terminals and in stimulation of catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclases at post-synaptic sites.", 
    "16": "This experiment was designed to study the role of cardiac beta-adrenergic mechanisms in the development of hypertrophy in rats. The suprarenal abdominal aorta was banded, resulting in an increase in cardiac wt-body wt ratio. A group of rats received a sham operation. Half of the banded rats were treated with practolol, 2.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally every 12 hr for the 6 days after banding. The effectiveness of cardiac beta-adrenergic blockade was confirmed by absence of an increase in heart rate following intravenous isoproterenol at various times between practolol injections. Practolol did not affect the gradient in the banded groups. Six animals in each banded group were sacrificed daily for 6 days. The right and left ventricles were dissected separately and weighed. RV-body weight ratios increased similarly in both banded groups. LV-body weight ratio (g/kg) was 2.17 +/- 0.043 in sham rats, and it attained maximal levels of 3.03 +/- 0.10 within 6 days in banded untreated rats and 2.96 +/- 0.14 in banded rats receiving practolol. Therefore, beta-adrenergic mechanisms were not involved in the development of hypertrophy due to increased afterload. Also, these findings are not consistent with the Meerson hypothesis, since hypertrophy occurred despite the reduction in myocardial O2 consumption due to practolol.", 
    "17": "The author describes the notions that led to initiation of controlled trials of long-term medication with antiarrhythmic drugs following myocardial infarction, and reviews reports of controlled trials with diphenylhydantoin, alprenolol, and procaine amide. It is concluded that, so far as possible widespread prophylactic use of these drugs to prevent sudden death is concerned, diphenylhydantoin has no place, while procaine amide cannot be evaluated on a large scale because of the frequency with which it causes serious adverse reactions. There is no bar to an extended trial with alprenolol or comparable beta-blocking drugs. The author believes that nonspecific prophylactic long-term use of antiarrhythmic drugs to prevent sudden coronary death outside the hospital is unlikely to prove rewarding.", 
    "18": "Two identical studies, one comparing the effect of single doses of a new beta-adrenoceptor blocker, atenolol (Tenormin) (50 mg and 100 mg) and placebo, and the other comparing the effect of single doses of methyldopa (250 mg and 500 mg) and placebo, in healthy volunteers, were carried out. 2 In both studies the effect of the drugs upon reaction time, critical flicker frequency, subjective drowsiness, pulse rate and blood pressure was measured. 3 Atenolol produced no effect upon reaction time, critical flicker frequency or subjective feelings, while methyldopa produced a statistically significant prolongation of reaction time and a statistically significant increase in the subjective sensation of drowsiness. 4 Atenolol produced statistically significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in pulse rate while methyldopa was without effect. 5 It is concluded that atenolol is unlikely to produce the side effects of sedation or drowsiness.",

    "20": "In 30 refractory hypertensives a hydrallazine beta blocker combination was added to or substituted for previous antihypertensives. Over a mean period of 12 months a good or satisfactory blood pressure response resulted in 12 patients each, while six others had an unsatisfactory outcome. (Good = diastolic pressure (DP) less than 95 mmHg; Satisfactory = deltaDP greater than 15 mmHg or DP 95-105 mmHg; Unsatisfactory = DP greater than 105 mmHg or deltaDP less than 15mmHg.) Twelve of the patients had significant renal disease with serum creatinine greater than 2 mg/100 ml, but in these there was no evidence that renal hydrallazine retention potentiated an antihypertensive effect. Those with an unsatisfactory response were receiving slightly higher doses hydrallazine and propranol when compared with good responders. The average dose of hydrallazine was 258 mg/day and of propranolol 308 mg/day. Transient headache was not uncommon at the commencement of hydrallazine therapy. Angina and vertebro-basilar insufficiency were each aggravated in one patient, but resolved with dosage adjustment. A lupuslike rash developed in one patient, a slow acetylator on 300 mg hydrallazine/day who had received a total of 92 g over eleven months. The genetically determined acetylator phenotype was assessed in 75 subjects. A little over one third were found to be rapid acetylators. Those with slow acetylator phenotype did not show a more favourable phenotype did not show a more favourable blood-pressure response to equivalent doses of hydrallazine.", 
    "21": "The adrenergic control of the cerebral circulation was subjected to pharmacological analysis. The status of the cerebral circulation was assessed using radioisotope, electromagnetic and resistographic methods. EEG, ECG and arterial pressure were recorded. The acid-base equilibrium and oxygen tension were measured in the arterial blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The experiments showed that the sympathetic innervation plays an important role in controlling cerebral circulation and in the development of cerebrovascular disorders. This was indicated by the constriction of intracranial arteries induced by noradrenaline, stimulation of sympathetic nerves, reflex sympathetic activations and the effect of potassium chloride on the centrol nervous system. The pharmacological study demonstrated that constriction of the intracranial vessels is brought about by an activation of the sympatho-adrenal system which is mediated via alpha-adrenoreceptors of cerebral blood vessels.", 
    "22": "In present study interactions of some adrenergic drugs with the binding of 3H-norepinephrine (NE) and response of some enzymatic systems in the heart of rats with pharmacological hyperthyroidism have been investigated. Binding of NE to cardiac particles was inhibited by isoproterenol, propranolol and in lower concentrations by another beta-blocking drug trimepranol both in control and hyperthyroid hearts in the same degree. However, after addition of nonradioactive norepinephrine (10(-3) M) the degree of displacement was lower in hyperthyroid than in euthyroid group. Activity of adenylate cyclase was lower in hyperthyroid cardiac particles. This difference remained preserved after stimulation by norepinephrine or NaF. The activities of hormone-sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase were increased in preparation of hyperthyroid hearts. The phosphorylase \"a\" activity was also increased in hyperthyroid cardiac particles. There was no change in cardiac adrenergic binding sites properties in hyperthyroidism with the exception of less displacement of NE by nonlabelled hormone. The results indicate that the increased lipolytic and phosphorylase \"a\" activities in hyperthyroid hearts are not necessarily linked to elevated activity of adenylate cyclase.", 
    "23": "Water soluble pig insulin (4 x 10(-8) to 4 x 10(-7) g/ml) produced a marked and long-lasting increase in the contractile force of the rabbit auricle in vitro. Once the maximum effect for a given insulin concentration had been reached, addition of more insulin did not produce any further increase in inotropic effect. Insulin was without effect in reserpinized animals. Inhibition of cardiac beta-receptors by propranolol suppressed the positive inotropic effect of insulin. These findings support the hypothesis that insulin releases catecholamines from the myocardium.", 
    "24": "The effects of the cardioselective beta-blocker, metoprolol, were evaluated under double-blind conditions in eighteen patients with angina pectoris. During an introductory run-in period of eight weeks, a placebo was given single-blindly. Thereafter two double-blind crossover periods each of four weeks followed, either 20 mg metroprolol or placebo being given t.i.d. Metoprolol gave a significant reduction in the number of anginal attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption. The patients' subjective assessments of their daily angina pectoris symptoms also showed a significant improvement compared with the placebo. At the end of each period, a standardized exercise test was performed. In comparison with placebo, metoprolol gave a significant increase of total work performed until the appearance of 1 mm ST-segment depression and until the end of exercise. The heart rate was significantly reduced at rest and during exercise. The blood pressure was significantly reduced only during exercise. None of the patients reported any severe unwanted effects. The complaints reported were mild to moderate, and the frequency during metoprolol treatment was even lower than during placebo treatment. No signs or symptoms of cardiac failure were seen in any of these patients on any occasion. It is concluded that 20 mg metoprolol t.i.d. is of benefit in the treatment of angina pectoris but further benefit might be obtained with higher doses.", 
    "25": "A method is described for the GLC determination of atenolol BP in plasma and urine. Extraction is accomplished under dehydrating conditions, and interfering impurities are removed by using an acidified cyclohexane-isopropanol mixture (2:1) and charcoal-treated paper disks. The drug thus isolated appears to react more efficiently with heptafluorobutyric anhydride, increasing the sensitivity of GLC electron-capture analysis. Concentrations as low as 0.02 mug/ml were measured using 0.5-ml aliquots of plasma or 0.1 ml of urine. Amino alcohols such as atenolol may form hydrates or alcoholates, precluding complete derivatization with heptafluorobutyric anhydride.", 
    "26": "A nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system has been demonstrated in the guinea pig trachea. Electrical field stimulation of this system, in the presence of adrenergic and cholinergic blockade, resulted in relaxation of tracheal rings contracted by the mediators of immediate hypersensitivity or histamine. The relaxation was blocked by tetrodotoxin, which indicated that nerve stimulation was responsible for the relaxation. The gastrointestinal tract, which has a similar embryological origin to the respiratory tract, also has a nonadrenergic inhibitory system. In the gastrointestinal tract, this system is thought to be responsible for the relaxation phase of peristalsis, and absence of this system, in the colon and the rectum, is thought to be an explanation for the spastic bowel in Hirschsprung's disease. It is possible that an abnormality of the respiratory nonadrenergic inhibitory system may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hyperreactive airways in asthma. The airways, due to a lack of inhibition, may be either partially contracted or unable to relax, and thus appear hyperreactive to stimuli.",

    "28": "The effectiveness of intravenously administered propranolol in antagonizing the chronotropic effect of isoproterenol and exercise has been investigated, and has been found at all times to be a predictable function of its plasma concentrations according to the classical drug-receptor theory for competitive antagonism. The data show further that the relationship between effectiveness and time depends on the way in which antagonism is measured. If the dose ratio to isoproterenol (DR) is measured, then (DR-1) declines with time in parallel with drug concentration. On the other hand, if propranolol's effects are measured as percentage reduction in a given response, then this declines linearly with time, even though plasma concentrations decline exponentially. This fact explains why confusion has in the past arisen concerning the relationship of the duration of beta blockade and pharmacokinetic half-life.", 
    "29": "A quantitative method for the simultaneous determination of propranolol and its active metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol in human plasma is described. Plasma samples are extracted at pH 9.6 with ethyl acetate after the addition of sodium bisulphite and the internal standard oxprenolol. The extracts are derivatized with trifluoroacetic anhydride before separation on a gas chromatograph--mass spectrometer. Detection and quantitation of the trifluoroacetyl derivatives are made by single-ion monitoring. The minimum detectable concentration of propranolol is 1 ng/ml and of 4-hydroxypropranolol 5 ng/ml using 1-ml plasma samples. No interferences from normal plasma constituents or from drugs commonly prescribed together with propranolol were detected.", 
    "30": "Prazosin was used in combination with other antihypertensive drugs in the successful management of hypertension in seven patients with chronic renal failure and six renal transplant recipients, also with chronic renal failure. The addition of small doses of prazosin (mean 3 mg/day) to the antihypertensive regimen produced significant falls in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both the lying and standing positions. The standing blood pressures were significantly lower than the lying blood pressures during prazosin treatment. Neither the mean blood urea concentrations nor the mean plasma creatinine concentrations changed significantly during prazosin administration. Chromium-51 edetic acid clearances did not change significantly during prazosin treatment in the seven patients in whom it was measured. Severe symptomatic postural hypotension occurred in one patient a week after starting prazosin 3 mg/day. This hypotensive episode was associated with a transient and reversible deterioration in renal function. Another patient developed a rash while on prazosin but it was probably related to propranolol rather than prazosin. Prazosin is thus an effective antihypertensive drug in patients with chronic renal failure, and it may be used with a variety of other drugs. It should be used cautiously, however, since patients with chronic renal failure may respond to small doses, and significant postural falls in blood pressure may result. There was no evidence that the use of prazosin resulted in progressive deterioration in the residual renal function of the patients with chronic renal failure.", 
    "31": "The present investigation sought (a) to establish the efficacy of morphine and ethanol as discriminative stimuli when each is paired with the administration of saline and (b) to compare, in a qualitative sense, the stimulus properties of the two drugs. Additional experiments examined the effects of treatment with naloxone or l-propranolol upon morphine and ethanol-mediated discriminated responding. Finally, the stereospecificity of the stimuli produced by morphine was determined by a comparison, in morphine-trained rats, of levorphanol and dextrorphan. Discriminated responding developed rapidly in both the morphine and ethanol groups. In tests in which ethanol was administered to morphine-trained animals and vice versa, no similarity to stimulus properties was apparent. Antagonism of discriminated responding induced by morphine and ethanol was attempted using naloxone and l-propranolol. Naloxone blocked the actions of morphine but was without effect upon ethanol. No evidence of antagonism of either drug by propranolol was found. When a range of doses of levorphanol (0.1-3 mg/kg) and dextrorphan (3-100 mg/kg) was tested in morphine trained animals, only levorphanol was able to substitute for morphine. The present results suggest that the stimulus properties of morphine represent typical opiate effects.", 
    "32": "The possibility of a protective effect by reserpine or propranolol on anoxia-induced released of malate and lactate dehydrogenase was investigated in isolated perfused hearts of guinea-pigs. After allowing 30 min of aerobic perfusion for the development of a steady state, the hearts from the nontreated group as well as the reserpine-pretreated or propranolol-treated group were subjected to a prolonged anoxia of 5 hrs. A marked enzyme release which occurred from the anoxic nontreated hearts was significantly inhibited by reserpine or propranolol. These findings suggest that the enzyme release from the anoxic myocardium is partly related to the liberation of endogenous catecholamines.", 
    "33": "The brain mechanisms mediating amphetamine's suppressive effect on feeding behavior were analyzed in rats with chronically implanted brain cannulas. Experiments in which drugs were injected directly into the anterolateral hypothalamus, the region found to be most responsive to amphetamine's action, yielded the following results. (1) Over a dose range of 6.25 nmoles (0.8 mug) to 400 nmoles (51.4 mug), hypothalamically injected D-amphetamine produced a reliable suppression of food consumption (20 percent at 6.25 nmoles, increasing to 88 percent at 200 nmoles) and was found to be approximately 3 times as potent as L-amphetamine in yielding this effect. (2) The anorexic effect of hypothalamically injected D-amphetamine was totally abolished by local administration of alpha-methyltyrosine, an inhibitor of dopamine, norepinephrine, and perhaps epinephrine synthesis, or by local administration of Fla-63, an inhibitor of only norepinephrine, and perhaps epinephrine, synthesis. (3) This effect of hypothalamic D-amphetamine was also antagonized by locally administered dopaminergic or beta-adrenergic receptor blockers but was unaffected by alpha-adrenergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic blockers. (4) Lateral hypothalamic administration of dopaminergic or beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, at quite low doses, was also effective in antagonizing the anorexia induced by peripherally administered D-amphetamine. These results strongly suggest that amphetamine, in suppressing feeding behavior, acts through the lateral hypothalamus, perhaps the anterior region, causing a release of dopamine and norepinephrine (or perhaps epinephrine) from lateral hypothalamic nerve endings and a subsequent stimulation of dopaminergic and beta-adrenergic receptors located in that region.", 
    "34": "In two separated treatment groups of 18 and 30 hypertensive patients of the clinical degrees of severity II and III after insufficient propranolol monotherapy a combined propranolol/hydralazine or propranolol/hydrochlorothiazide treatment, respectively, was performed during several months. Under the combination therapy on average a clear increase of the effect of the beta-receptor blocker on the systolic as well as on the diastolic blood pressure is achieved. There were no essential side-effects. In accordance with modern opinions in the therapy of hypertension the combination of propranolol with a peripheral vasodilator and/or a salidiuretic should find a wide area of use, above all in hypertensive patients who are diastolically more difficult to be stabilised. The production of an adequate combination preparation is to be taken into consideration.", 
    "35": "Lipid peroxidation was initiated by the addition of either ADP-complexed Fe3+ or cumene hydroperoxide to isolated rat hepatocytes and the resultant biochemical and morphological alterations investigated. As previously observed with microsomes, malonaldehyde formation was associated with the inactivation of glucose-6-phosphatase. Inhibition of microsomal oxidative drug metabolism was correlated with the release and subsequent inactivation of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, whereas cytochrome P-450 destruction occurred only in the presence of high concentrations of the organic hydroperoxide which were associated with extensive malonaldehyde formation. Under these conditions there were also marked ultrastructural alterations in the hepatocytes which were not apparent after incubation in the presence of iron (less than or equal to 187 muM Fe3+). The latter treatment was, however, associated with moderate biochemical effects such as glucose-6-phosphatase inactivation and increased membrane permeability. The cellular defence system against lipid peroxidation is discussed and it is concluded that the isolated liver cell system provides a valuable tool for the study of lipid peroxidation and its pathological implications.", 
    "36": "The faecal output of bile acids and endogenous neutral steroids was increased in three hypertriglyceridaemic patients. One patient had familail type IIb, one had type IV and the third had type V hyperlipoproteinaemia. The hyperlipidaemia in the type IV and type V patients was associated with diabetes and a high alcohol intake. The plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and the faecal output of bile acids decreased significantly when the type IIb patient was given D-thyroxine plus propranolol, and when the type IV and type V patients were treated by withdrawal of alcohol, a low=carbohydrate diet and insulin or glibenclamide. The findings are discussed in relation to the possibility that hypertriglyceridaemia and increased bile acid synthesis in these patients have a common metabolic origin.", 
    "37": "The blood pressure lowering effects of prindolol (2 x 5 mg daily) and of the combination prindolol (2 x5 mg) + clopamide (10 mg) were investigated in a single blind controlled study on 61 patients with slight hypertension and compared with placebo in another group of patients. In both groups, a significant lowering of blood pressure, both lying down and standing, could be achieved, the fall in blood pressure in standing being significantly better with the combination treatment. The number of responders was greater with the combination therapy than with prindolol alone.", 
    "38": "The antihypertensive activity of timolol (Blocadren, FROSST-MSD), a new beta blocking agent, was assessed in a single blind crossover placebo-controlled study in 14 patients with essential hypertension. Ten patients completed the trial. The average standing pressure during the placebos periods was 168/109mmHg and during the periods on treatment with timolol the average standing pressure was 139/92mmHg. All 10 patients showed some hypotensive response. The average daily dosage was 21 mg with a range of 15-30 mg. Four patients achieved optimal levels of blood pressure by the end of one week's therapy with the maximum time required being four weeks. Timolol appears to be an effective antihypertensive agent. Side effects were insignificant.", 
    "39": "The development of a logical and physiologically sound approach to the management of gestational hypertension presents a formidable challenge to both obstetrician and internist. The maternal and fetal risks and sequelae are well known and significant. Therefore, understanding the pathophysiology of the particular hypertensive syndrome or disease being treated is of great importance if a rational approach to treatment is to be accomplished. In this discussion we will present the pharmacology of the various antihypertensive agents currently being used, followed by a brief discussion of our current concept of the pathophysiology of the three major types of hypertension seen during pregnancy and finally by our suggested management.", 
    "40": "Both human and rat erythrocytes respond to low doses (10(-11)--10(-9) M) of L-isoproterenol and L-epinephrine with an increased degree of hypotonic hemolysis and a decreased rate of filtration through standardized paper filters. The receptors in both cell types have many of the characteristics of beta-receptors for catecholamines. However, hormone-receptor interaction in the human cell does not lead to an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP concentration, but in the rat cell, hormone-receptor interaction does lead to a significant increase in cyclic AMP content. Thus, catecholamine-beta-receptor interaction, at least in the human red cell, leads to a change in red cell properties which are not mediated by adenylate cyclase activation. Likewise, prostaglandin E2, at 10(-12)--10(-10) M, causes are increased degree of hypotonic hemolysis and a decreased rate of filtration through standardized paper filters, but it also does not increase the cycliC AMP content of the human erythrocyte but does increase that of the rat erythrocyte. Nevertheless, exogenous cyclic AMP, when added at a concentration of 10(-8) M to washed human erythrocytes, increases the degree of hypotonic hemolysis. Conversely, prostaglandin E1, at 10(-12)--10(-10) M, causes a decreased degree of hypotonic hemolysis and an increased rate of filtration through a standard filter. Both prostaglandin E2 and the catecholamines decrease the size of a rapidly exchangeable calcium pool, and prostaglandin E1 increases it.", 
    "41": "To study the mechanisms by which propranolol suppresses essential tremor, accelerometric recordings were made from four normal subjects and eight patients with that tremor, and small amounts of isoproterenol and propranolol were infused intravenously or into one brachial artery. Intra-arterial isoproterenol increased tremor amplitude selectively in that arm in normal subjects and in patients with essential tremor (range, 1.85 to 3.50 with mean 2.74 times the base-line level). Intra-arterial or intravenous propranolol quickly blocked the enhanced action tremor in both groups. It did not simultaneously affect the underlying essential tremor, whereas long-term oral propranolol therapy did diminish the amplitude of the essential tremor in each patient. Peripheral beta-adrenergic tremorogenic receptors function normally even in patients with essential tremor; their function is not necessary for the production of essential tremor, and the efficacy of chronic propranolol therapy in the suppression of essential tremor is not mediated via its peripheral beta-adrenergic blocking action.", 
    "42": "Noradrenaline, adrenaline, isoprenaline and salbutamol induced marked accumulations of cyclic AMP in incubated slices of chick cerebral hemispheres. Isoprenaline was both more potent and more powerful than adrenaline or noradrenaline and the increase in cyclic AMP elicited by the catecholamines was powerfully antagonized by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol but not by the alphapadrenoceptor blocker phentolamine. The order of potency of the catecholamines isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline and the ability of the non-catechol salbutamol to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation in chick cerebral slices suggests that the beta-adrenoceptro may resemble that found in the lung (beta2) rather than that in the heart (beta1). Propranolol proved to be a very potent antagonist of the cyclic AMP response induced by isoprenaline in vivo. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade was still evident 12 hrs after a single injection of the durg although only negligible amounts of 3H-propranolol could be detected in cerebral tissue after 2 hrs.", 
    "43": "In animals without myocardial infarction the new beta-sympathicolytic agent atenolol (4-[2'-hydroxy-3'-iso-propylaminopropoxy]-phenyl acetamide, ICI 66 082) dose-dependently decreased heart rate, systolic aortic pressure and cardiac output. Coronary mean flow, coronary resistance, stroke volume, left ventricular enddiastolic pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance did not change significantly. Atenolol significantly reduced myocardial contractility, expressed by (dp/dtmax), Vpm, t-(dp/dtmax) and pre-ejection period. Furthermore, the comparative studies in animals with myocardial infarction and concomitant reduced cardial efficiency revealed, that atenolol has neither a positive intrinsic activity as has practolol nor a negative intrinsic activity as has propranolol. The dose-contractility relation of atenolol resembles that of practolol: in low dosages a strong decrease is achieved, in higher dosages no further reduction of the contractility parameters is observed. Because of the strong negative inotropic and blood pressure lowering effect it is suggested to use atenolol only with great caution in patients with reduced cardiac efficiency.", 
    "44": "A case of lymphosarcoma of the heart in a 10-year-old boy is presented. The clinical picture simulated a pericarditis. Prednisolone had a remarkably good temporary effect. Post-mortem examination showed a highly differentiated lymphosarcoma invading the pericardium and myocardium from a primary mediastinal localisation. Cytologic examination for malignant cells in the pericardial fluid must not be forgotten in a case of unexplained pericardial effusion.", 
    "45": "The intraperitoneal injection of isoprenaline in rats caused an increase in myocardial ornithine decarboxylase activity which reached a maximum of about four times the control value one hour after the injection. The intraperitoneal injection of dl-propranolol had no effect on myocardial ornithine decarboxylase activity. The injection of dl-propranolol 30 min before the injection of isoprenaline almost completely prevented the effect of isoprenaline.", 
    "46": "A double-blind trial of propranolol, in a dosage of 120 mg a day, and placebo was conducted in 11 patients with essential tremor. An improvement in tremor was observed in all patients who received propranolol and was most pronounced in the upper extremities. The favorable clinical assessment was further confirmed by improvement in a grooved pegboard test and in the quality of handwriting as evaluated by two \"blind\" observers. No side effects were encountered. It is concluded that propranolol is at present the best available drug for the treatment of essential tremor.", 
    "47": "The informativeness of functional tests and of their combinations was studied with reference to the differential diagnosis of the functional or organic genesis of the repolarization ECG changes. The highest informativeness was found to be achieved with the potassium and Inderal tests that permit to establish unequivocally a functional or organic genesis. A combination of the potassium and Inderal tests significantly increases the informativeness of each of these tests taken separately. The Valsalva and the orthorstatic tests are practicallt noninformative in terms of the conducted study.", 
    "48": "The relative blockade of rate and force responses of guinea-pig isolated atria to catecholamines by practolol was compared. pA2 determinations revealed that with (--)-noradrenaline as the agonist, practolol was more effective in antagonizing rate (pA2, 6.99) than force (pA2, 6.44). This difference was absent in either atria from reserpinized animals incubated with phenoxybenzamine and tropolone or atria incubated with cocaine. Similarly, when (--)-isoprenaline was the agonist, force and rate pA2 values were identical, suggesting that rate and force beta1-adrenoceptors do not differ. The preferential blockade of (--)-noradrenaline-induced rate responses in untreated atria was attributed to the operation of a saturable neuronal uptake mechanism which differs between left and right atria. To avoid high (--)-noradrenaline concentrations encountered during pA2 determinations, the % reduction of responses to single doses of (--)-noradrenaline by practolol were measured in untreated atria. Far from confirming the lack of receptor differentiation indicated by the pA2 determinations, this study revealed force to be more practolol sensitive. The relative merits of the two methods are discussed in an attempt to resolve the question whether rate and force beta1-adrenoceptors differ.", 
    "49": "Acute tests with rats demonstrated that the adrenoblocking agent phentolamine acts predominantly on the potassium level in the myocardium, raising its total, intra- and extra-cellular content. The effect of anapriline was mainly on sodium. Thyramine, which like adrenoblocking agents displays a catecholine-reducing effect, did not produce any similar changes in the potassium and sodium content.", 
    "50": "Trasicor (oxprenolol) was introduced intraperitoneally to mongrel albino rats of 4 age groups (7, 14, 30 days old and adults) in single effective and resistance doses, following which the ATP, ADP, AMP and NP content in the renal tissue homogenates was determined. At early stages of postnatal ontogenesis the animals are shown to be less sensitive to the drug than in the case of adult rats. Possible increases in the dosage of trasicor in the pediatric practice are deemed permissible.", 
    "51": "Nonachlazine (10 mg/kg intravenously) exerted a two-phase influence on the heart activity. The short phase of the weakening of the heart activity gave place to the intensive increase in the cardiac output and the contractility of the myocardium. An increase in the blood supply and heart activity coincided in time with the accumulation of the quantity of noradrenaline and with increase in the phosphorylase \"a\" activity. Beta-adrenoblockers prevented the development of the effect in question. It is assumed that the efficacy of nonachlazine during ischemic heart disease was connected with its capacity to activate the adrenergic mechanisms of the glycogenolysis regulation leading to the switching of the myocardial metabolism to the anaerobic route of energy release.", 
    "52": "In anesthetized dogs, differences in the haemodynamic effects of propranolol and oxprenolol were observed during normoxia, hypercapnia and hypoxia. These differences are presumably due to the sympathomimetic activity of oxprenolol.", 
    "53": "In 5 volunteers with essential hypertension (age between 32 and 48 years) plasma renin activity (PRA) was determined and right heart catheterization and femoral artery pressure measurements were carried out at rest and during isometric exercise by handgrip. Both investigations were repeated 88 to 98 days after continuous treatment with oral pindolol in increasing doses, the highest dose in all patients amounting to 45 mg/day. Following pindolol therapy arterial systolic cuff pressure decreased from 163 +/- 12 (1 SD) to 148 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0,005). Diastolic cuff pressure decreased slightly but not significantly from 109 +/- 13 to 106 +/- 9 mm Hg. PRA varied in an inconsistent manner. Pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP), femoral artery mean pressure (FAM), cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance did not change significantly during treatment with pindolol. Stressing of the left ventricle by handgrip prior to and following pindolol elicited similar changes of heart rate, FAM, PCP, CO and stroke work. It is concluded (1) that pindolol produces only a small decrease in systolic cuff pressure, (2) that there is no correlation between changes in cuff pressure and PRA, and (3) that long-term treatment with pindolol is not accompanied by impairment of left ventricular function either at rest or during isometric exercise.", 
    "54": "Thymic biopsies taken from women at the beginning of the operation of subtotal thyroidectomy were studied by the point-counting histometric technique. In all patients with primary thyrotoxicosis, the thymus is hyperplastic. After pretreatment with antithyroid drugs, the pattern of thymic involution with age is similar to, but at higher levels, than that in control groups of patients with non-toxic goitre in whom there is no evidence of immunological abnormality. By contrast, after propranolol pretreatment very little age involution is seen. The differences in the appearance of the thymus in female primary thyrotoxixosis patients prepared for operation with different drug treatment regimes are probably related to the pharmacological actions of the drugs and may indicate an interaction between primary immunological and secondary endocrinological factors in the disease process.", 
    "55": "The anti-hypertensive effect of propranolol is studied in 35 essential permanent hypertensive patients. The decrease in blood pressure in higher in the presence (p is less than 0.01) than in the absence of diuretic therapy. The anti-hypertensive effect is higher in severe than in moderate hypertension. No side effect was observed except the decrease in heart rate (p is less than 0.001). Dihydralazine was added in 4 severe hypertensive patients and induced in 2 of them anginal attacks.", 
    "56": "This study was designed to investigate changes in cardiac performance during hypoglycemia produced by the administration of insulin in the newborn piglet. With heart rate, aortic pressure, and aortic flow held constant, the treated group demonstrated a pronounced positive inotropic response manifested by an increase of dP/dt max to 138% of control values. Central nervous system function and beta adrenergic activity were excluded from the preparation by ligation of the brachiocephalic vessels and administration of practolol. For reasons discussed, it is unlikely that the findings can be ascribed to glucagon contamination. Therefore, the increase in contractility presumably resulted from a direct effect of insulin upon the myocardium. Clinical and laboratory data suggest that the resistance of the neonate to hypoxia is modified by glycogen stores. Insulin is known to increase glycogen synthesis, and this effect might be expected to augment myocardial resistance to hypoxia. Under the conditions of these experiments, however, pretreatment with insulin had no demonstrable influence on the rate of deterioration of cardiac function during hypoxia. The mechanism of cardiac stimulation by insulin is unknown but may involve calcium fluxes."
