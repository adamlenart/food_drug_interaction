    "0": "Chronic treatment with isoprenaline causes hypersecretion and a marked enlargement of submaxillary glands. Isoprenaline, given to normal rats or treated animals with hypertrophied salivary glands, increases the incorporation of 32P in tissue inorganic and organic phosphates and phospholipids. Propranolol given alone is inactive on phosphorus metabolism, but inhibits the effect of isoprenaline. The phospholipid effect is probably related to the increase of membranes in hypertrophied acinar cells; a correlation with the hypersecretion induced by isoprenaline needs further study. The results show that in experimental sialadenosis and hypersialorrhea induced by isoprenaline in the whole rat stimulation of glandular beta-adrenoreceptors and phosphorus metabolism are involved.", 
    "1": "Intravenous administration of dl-propranolol, l-and d-alpr\u00e9nolol in normotensive and spontaneous, renal or neurogen hypertensive rats induced decrease of blood pressure in anaesthetized animals. In awake animals hypotensive activity was irregular and lower.", 
    "2": "In anesthetized rats, after i.p. treatment during 4 days: phenoxybenzamine and guanethidine were hypotensive and increased nutritional blood flow in squeletal muscles; propranolol had a poor hypotensive effect and decreased nutritional circulation in heart, skin and intestine.", 
    "3": "Lactacidemia, catecholaminemia and blood pressure have been measured in normal rats submitted to a swimming exercise. They are overloaded (6% body weight). Lactacidemia is increased after 15 minutes swimming. Adrenalinemia and noradrenalinemia are also statisticaly increased. Blood pressure falls during the exercice period. Hypotension is prevented by beta adrenergic blockade.", 
    "4": "Myocardial taurine level was found to be greater in the rat than in the guinea-pig. Taurine inhibited the development of arrhythmias caused by the i.v. infusion of ouabain in the rat. When ouabain induced arrhythmias, the myocardial taurine level decreased. Both effects were blocked by pretreatment of propranolol. The uptake of taurine into the heart did not necessarily result in the reversal of the PR interval prolonged by ouabain. The protecting effect of taurine against ouabain toxicity was not dependent upon the change in myocardial total ATPase activity.", 
    "5": "Bovine fibrinogen can aggregate human blood platelets by a direct mechanism (first wave) and also indirectly by releasing endogenous ADP (second wave). A primarily non-altered surface structure of the thrombocytes is important for the induction of the first wave. Under certain conditions a second aggregation wave, concomitant with the release and the availability reaction is elicited. Besides the cell's contact, the presence of ADP and calcium ions are necessary for the induction of the release reaction in human platelet rich plasma. The changes induced by bovine fibrinogen thus follows the same pattern as the irreversible phase of aggregation, linked to release as induced by ADP.", 
    "6": "10 compounds from the 2.4- and 3.4-difluorinated phenylethanol-amines series were tested for their antagonistic action against a hyperglycemia induced by catecholamines in rats, and the ED50 and AD50 values were determined. All the substances acted beta-adrenolytically, with the glycogenolysis enhanced by isoproterenol being blocked more potently by 3.4-difluorophenylethanolamines than by the corresponding 2.4-difluoroderivatives. An exception in the series is 2.4-difluoro-n-butylnoradrenalin, which acts 10fold more beta-adrenolytically than the 3.4-difluoroderivative, and has 3 times the effect of the comparative substance dichloroisoproterenol.", 
    "7": "Changes in gastric mucosal microcirculation in rats were studied by using the method of intra-aortic injection of India ink, followed by microdissection of the mucosa. Acute stress, induced by restraint and exposure to cold for 2 hr, caused marked and significant vasodilatation in the gastric mucosa. This vasodilatation was prevented by pretreatment with atropine or chlorpromazine, but not by alpha- or theta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. Phentolamine caused significant vasoconstriction in the gastric mucosa of non-stressed rats, but when animals were stressed phentolamine induced a greater vasodilatation than was obtained with stress alone. These observations provide added support for the hypothesis that stress induces vagal overactivity, probably of central origin. The resulting strong contractions of the gastric wall, and compression of the intramural vessels, are probably responsible for degeneration of the mucosal cells leading to the formation of stress-induced ulcers in the rat.", 
    "8": "Having briefly touched upon the problem of terminology and classification of arrhythmias the authors consider the diagnosis and clinical evaluation of some disorders, including the extrasystole (the significance of the extrasystolic interval), ectopic arrhythmias from the region of the atrio-ventricular junction (with simultaneous consistent or transent disruption of the intraventricular conduction), isolated atrial tachycardia, some variants of auricular fibrillation, flutter paroxysms, paroxysms of ventricular tachycardia, with continued auricular fibrillation in particular, and also the earlier described electrocardiographic phenomenon tentatively interpreted as sinistroatrial fibrillation with dextraatrial tachycardia, as well as major types of disrupted condution. The authors give a brief exposure of their views as to the principles of the treatment. Emphasis is placed on the importance of a comprehensive clinical approach to the diagnostic matters and to the evaluation of arrhythmias, as well as to the fundamental need to define more precisely the pathogenesis of the disturbed rhythm in a concrete patient so as to adopt an effective treatment.", 
    "9": "Gastric motility was investigated under the effect of adrenergic receptor agonist and antagonist substances in albino rats of both sexes and weighing 150 to 180 g. Gastric evacuation was studied, after introducing 2 ml/100 g of Novobarium suspension in the stomach, by radioscopy and radiography. Epinephrine (Tonogen) was found to inhibit gastric motility, this inhibition being effective even after pylorotomy. The dominantly alpha adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (Sympathomim) had not any effect; the alpha blocker phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline) slightly depressed gastric evaluation. A marked inhibitory influence was noted with stimulating the beta receptors by isoproterenol (Prophylon), while propranolol (Inderal) slightly accelerated gastric evacuation by blocking beta receptors. A pretreatment by phenoxybenzamine of the animals did not affect epinephrine influence whereas a pretreatment by propranolol completely abolished the inhibitory effect of epinephrine on gastric motility. These results suggest the presence of a slight beta receptor tone in gastric motility at rest, and indicate further that epinephrine exerts its inhibitory effect on gastric motility via adrenergic beta receptors.", 
    "10": "This study reveals the main vaso-active substances which pass through the lung, by studying in each case the extra-pulmonary of pulmonary origin, the effects of the lung on these substances: capture, discharge, transformation, and the effects of these substances on the lung. Eight groups of substances are studied: mediators of the sympatho-adrenergic system, substances interfering with adrenergic agents, acetyl-choline, serotonin, angiotensin, histamine, kinins, and prostaglandins. The lung behaves either as a neutral organ, or a filtering organ, or a filtering organ, or a secreting organ for these substances. In this way it strangely resembles the kidney. The pulmonary circulation is not completely comprised of simple reaction. It is capable of internal adjustement and redistribution under the effect of these substances. Pulmonary edema probably will always remain difficult to their mechanism of production, in so far as can be estimated from the multitude of substances. It is still rather a delicate matter to distinguish between edema-generating phenomena and phenomena which are secondary to the edema itself.", 
    "11": "Intravenous etilefrine increases the pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure of healthy individuals. Peripheral vascular resistance falls during the infusion of 1-8 mg etilefrine but begins to rise at higher dosage. Marked falls in pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and peripheral bloodflow, accompanied by rises in mean arterial pressure, occur when etilefrine is infused after administration of intravenous propranolol 2,5 mg. These findings indicate that etilefrine has both beta 1 and alpha adrenergic effects in man.", 
    "12": "Physiological and pharmacological characteristics of the spontaneous motility of rat oviductal tracts (the coiled oviduct plus its mesosalpinx), isolated in proestrus, estrus or metestrus, are described. The initial contractile tension (recorded following isolation) was comparable in the three stages of the cycle, but its decrement with time was greater in metestrus than in proestrus; the opposite being observed regarding the rate of contractions. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine depress motility in proestrus and metestrus, but not in estrus. The inhibition of motility during proestrus, produced by added norepinephrine, phenylephrine or isoproterenol was not modified by phenotolamine but was abolished by propranolol. During estrus, norepinephrine and phenylephrine inhibited tubal contractions of preparations incubated with phentolamine, whereas it produced a distinct stimulation in the presence of propranolol. It is concluded that: (a) the rat mesosalpinx might play some role in the motility of the whole isolated oviductal tract; (b) there are variations in the decrement with time of contractile tension and frequency of contractions in different stages of the sex cycle; (c) the effects of catecholamines upon the rat oviductal tract also varies within the cycle, probably due to influences imposed by sex hormones.", 
    "13": "Although the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of intact animals, it either does not alter, or it inhibits in vitro insulin secretion. This may be because in the higher concentration used in in vitro studies, phentolamine exerts a second pharmacological effect that counterbalances its primary effect of blocking monoamine action. We recently demonstrated that pancreatic islets contain substantial amounts of monoamine oxidase (MAO), and that MAO inhibitors such as iproniazid and tranylcypromine can alter insulin secretion. In the present study, we determined if other drugs that affect insulin secretion, alter the MAO activity of homogenates of rabbit pancreatic islets (collagenase technique) or liver. Phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol (10 muM and 100 muM) inhibit islet and hepatic MAO. Haloperidol (10muM) inhibits hepatic but not islet MAO, while haloperidol (10muM) does not inhibit MAO in either tissue. Ethanol (270 to 2.7mM) inhibits islet MAO. Hepatic MAO is inhibited by high (270 to 180mM) but not by low (27 to 2.7mM) concentrations of ethanol. Collagenase digestion does not increase the sensitivity of islet and liver MAO to inhibition by phentolamine or ethanol. In the absence of added monoamines, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine do not alter basal or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from rabbit pancreas. Preincubation of rabbit pancreas with the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) increases the beta cell serotonin content and inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Alpha adrenergic antagonists not only fail to block, but actually potentiate the serotonin inhibition of insulin secretion. We conclude that inhibition of islet MAO may cause an increase in islet monoamine content and these monoamines may alter in vitro insulin secretion. One mechanism through which adrenergic antagonists and ethanol modify in vitro insulin secretion may be by inhibiting pancreatic islet MAO.", 
    "14": "The authors examined the beta-adrenergic structures in the mesencephalic formation (MSF) in view of establishing their role on the activity of MSF in view of establishing the in rols on the activity of MSF itself and the relationship of the same formation with the cerebral cortex and the lymbic system. It was established that beta-adrenergic blockers after their local application in MSF could inhibit its function. The data from the effect on the induced bioelectrical activity indicated also diminution in the functional activity of MSF. The authors found that the inhibiting influences of beta-blockers were abolished by their antagonist isoprenalite. An inference is made that there are beta-adrenergic structures, which act excitatory.", 
    "15": "pKa's of fourteen beta-receptor blockers, isoproterenol and norepinephrine, were determined potentiometrically. A Hammett analysis indicated that the influence of ring substituents on the basicity of the amines is attenuated by the ethanolic chain and abolished by the propranoloxy chain of beta-receptor blockers. The effect of ring substituents in phenoxypropranolamines upon affinity for the beta-adrengeric receptors is therefore unrelated to the strength of the bases. Two alterantive hypotheses are fowarded to explain why phenoxypropranolamines have greater affinities for the beta-receptors than phenethanolamines.", 
    "16": "The clinical usefulness of propranolol as the sole drug in the preoperative treatment of thyrotoxicosis has been investigated. The effect of the drug on the serum levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine has also been studied. Eight consecutive patients were treated. Four of these showed good clinical response to propranolol and both pre- and postoperative periods were uneventful. Two patients also showed a good clinical response but developed accentuated thyrotoxic symptoms in the immediate postoperative period. One patient showed no clinical response to propranolol therapy and in one further patient the treatment was discontinued because of discomfort. All glands were resected without technical difficulty. They were more vascular and friable after this therapy than after pretreatment with antithyroid drugs and thyroxine. The serum levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine decreased during propranolol treatment. It is concluded that treatment with propranolol as a sole preoperative drug might be used as an alternative only in cases where conventional therapy is not suitable.", 
    "17": "The authors describe a simple method of spectrofluorimetric estimation of acebutolol, applicable to blood and urine, sufficiently sensitive to obtain therapeutic concentrations. After administration of a 200 mg dose by mouth, one may observe a maximal plasma concentration 3 hours later, with average values of 1.02 +/- 0.20 mg/liter. The principle of the estimation is based on acid hydrolysis of the product, then condensation of the liberated amine with nitroso-1 naphtol-2 to give a fluorescent derivative (stimulation 460 nm, emission 545 nm).", 
    "18": "This report considers interference between medications for, on the one hand, drugs given during pregnancy, and, on the other hand, drugs given to the pregnant women and anaesthetic agents. Consideration is given to progestational agents, oxytocics, beta-mimetics, corticosteroids, insulin, hypotensive agents, diuretics and psychiatric drugs. For each case of interference, an attempt is made to provide practical data, with particular respect to those combinations frequently prescribed by obstetricians, e.g. the combination of the beta-mimetics and corticosteroids with the aim of preventing impending premature onset of labour and to ensure foetal pulmonary maturation; the combination of insulin and corticosteroids given to diabetics with the aim of preventing hyaline membrane disease; the combination of corticosteroids with anti-histamines in the treatment of rhesus disease; the association of oxytocics with large quantities of intravenous fluid in the case of post-partum haemorrhage and hypontensive medication combinations and the problems which may result with emergency anaesthesis.", 
    "19": "The effect of propranolol, phentolamine, papaverine, theophyline and Ca++, administered in different combinations of their threshold doses, on the relaxing effect of adrenaline was studied on an isolated segment of proximal jejunum of male cats. It was established that phentolamine weakened the relaxing effect of adrenaline, while propranolol had no effect on it. Papaverine potentiated the relaxinf effects of adrenaline both when administered alone and in combination with propranolol or with phentolamine. Theophylline weakened the relaxing effect of adfrenaline and of the combination phentolamine-adrenaline. Ca++ increased the smooth-muscle tone. The interpretation of the results obtained leads to the fundamental conclusions that the relaxing effect of adrenaline on cat jejunum is more alpha- than beta-adrenergically determined and that the system of the cyclic AMP participates in its realization. At the smae time, however, the possibility of participation of other mechanisms is not excluded. The smooth-muscle effect of papaverine and theophylline is not determined only by their inhibitory effect on phosphodiesterase.", 
    "20": "The effects of some drugs on the beating frequency of isolated cells of the chick amnion cultivated on cover slips were investigated. Cholinergic and adrenergic agonists and antagonists, serotonine, antispasmodics, coronary dilatants and local anesthetics influenced the beating frequency significantly. The isolated chick amnion cells equal in their pharmacological behaviour the intact chick amnion and smooth muscle cells of mammals but differ from isolated beating heart cells.", 
    "21": "Adrenergic agonists produced a characteristic and definite decrease in the amplitude of spontaneous contractions and tone of the isolated rabbit jejunum. Effect of phenylephrine was abolished either by phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine. Relaxation induced by epinephrine and by norepinephrine was inhibited after combined treatment with phentolamine and propranolol. Phentolamine alone diminished the response to epinephrine and to norepinephrine, but the diminution for epinephrine was greater, indicating that epinephrine has a greater affinity for alpha- than for beta-receptors in the rabbit jejunum. Stimulation of the beta-receptors by isoproterenol was inhibited by propranolol, oxprenolol, sotalol and pindolol, but the block was incomplete. The activity of these four beta-blockers in preventing the inhibitory response to isoproterenol was as follows: inidolol greater than or equal to oxprenolol greater than propranolol greater than sotalol. This demonstrates the fact that not all beta-adrenergic blocking agents possess an identical pharmacologic spectrum of activity. Also it can be suggested that the beta-receptors of jejunum differ in specificity from those of other organs.", 
    "22": "In the albino rat, the evolvement of myocardial necrosis induced by a single injection of ISO was accompanied by a fall in total NE. Pretreatment with propranolol and pargyline protected against ISO-induced necrosis and myocardial hypertrophy, but did not influence the ISO-induced depletion of NE stores. The depletion of NE stores is not due to impairment in synthesis or increased intraneuronal metabolism of NE since, in ISO-treated rats, neither cardiac tyrosine hydroxylase activity nor MAO activity was altered. The decrease in endogenous NE is not due to a defect in the storage of NE. The ability of myocardium to take up and store NE returned to normal within 48 hours, whereas endogenous levels returned to normal within 5 days, even in the presence of demonstrable necrosis. Thus, there is lack of correlation between chemical and morphological changes, since catecholamine depletion occurred in the absence of morphologically demonstrable tissue injury, and the function of the adrenergic neuron returns to normal in the presence of demonstrable necrosis.", 
    "23": "Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and blood values of PO2, PCO2, and pH were studied in unanesthetized rats for 8 hours. After a cardiotoxic dose of 20 mg/kg isoprenaline, s.c., blood pressure fell from 117 to 72 mm Hg, heart rate accelerated from 326 to 497 beats/minute, and cardiac work diminished by about 15%. Metabolic rate increased by about 80%, blood values of PO2 rose, and those of PCO2 fell somewhat, whereas blood pH dropped from 7.48 to 7.38, indicating metabolic acidosis. Propranolol (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and verapamil (50 mg/kg, i.p.), both of which almost completely prevented isoprenaline-induced cardiac necroses, inhibited the chronotropic and calorigenic actions of isoprenaline by about 50%. While propranolol inhibited the depressor effect of isoprenaline completely, verapamil enhanced it: blood pressure fell to 46 mm Hg. Isoprenaline-induced fall of blood pH was not prevented by either propranolol or verapamil. Decrease of blood pH and cardionecrotisation were enhanced when isoprenaline was given together with 4.8 g/kg ethanol, p.o. In conclusion, hemodynamic actions of isoprenaline, especially hypotension, seem to be nonessential for the production of cardiac necroses. Strong acidification can aggravate the cardiotoxicity of isoprenaline.", 
    "24": "An iodine-labeled beta-adrenergic inhibitor ((125)l-hydroxybenzylpindolol) binds specifically to a site on turkey erythrocyte membranes. A series of beta-adrenergic agonists and inhibitors compete for this binding site, with apparent affinities paralleling biological effectiveness as activators or inhibitors of catecholaminestimulated adenylate cyclase. The activity of d-(+) agonists or inhibitors was 1 percent (or less) than that of the corresponding l-(-) isomers in competing for binding of the iodinated blocker as well as in affecting catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase. 1-(-)-Norepinephrine was about one-tenth as active as l-(-)-isoproterenol in competing for the beta-blocking agent site. The stereospecificity of the interaction with the iodinated beta-blocking agent and the correspondence between affinity for site and biological potency of analogs suggested that this interaction is involved in function of the beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "25": "Dopamine, apomorphine, isoproterenol, and norepinephrine each increased the concentration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in slice of rat caudate nucleus. The concentrations of dopamine, apomorphine isoproterenol, and norepinephrine causing half-maximal increases were 60, 150, 0.03 and 30 micromoles per liter, respectively. The effect of dopamine was blocked by fluphenazine, a dopamine receptor antagonist, but not by propranolol, a beta-andrenergic receptor antagonist. Conversely, the effect of isoproterenol was blocked by propranolol but not by fluphenazine. The results suggest that in rat caudate nucleus there are two distinct catecholamine receptors capable of causing increased concentrations of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, one having the characteristic of dopamine receptor, and the other having the characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "26": "All schizophrenic symptoms remitted completely in six out of 14 adults who had not responded to phenothiazine drugs and who were then given propranolol. Another patient improved markedly and four improved moderately. Two had minimal or transient improvement, and one left hospital unchanged after a short, severe, toxic reaction. The six with complete remissions all began to improve within a few days of starting propranolol and the florid symptoms remitted completely after three to 26 days. They were stabilized on a daily dose of 500-3,500 mg of propranolol and at the time of writing had remained well for up to six months. Two patients who stopped propranolol after their symptoms remitted relapsed severely within a few days. Toxic effects (ataxia, visual hallucinations, and confusional states) were related to the rate of increase rather than to the absolute dose of propranolol. After the procedure was modified unwanted effects were usually mild or absent.", 
    "27": "The beta-adrenergic blocking and hemodynamic properties of 5-(3-tert-butyl-amino-2-hydroxy) propoxy-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril hydrochloride (OPC-1085) were investigated and compared with those of propranolol and pindolol on myocardial contractile force, heart rate and arterial blood pressure in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs. OPC-1085 showed almost the same beta-adrenergic blocking potency as pindolol, but was approximately 30 and 20 times stronger than propranolol against isoproterenol and cardiac nerve stimulation, respectively. Slight negative inotropic and chronotropic responses were observed with OPC-1085 in effective blocking doses from 1 to 10 mug/kg but were converted to positive ones in doses from 30 to 3000 mug/kg in non-reserpinized dogs. In reserpinized dogs, both OPC-1085 and pindolol induced only positive responses. These responses were more evident with OPC-1085.", 
    "28": "To evaluate the effects of morphine on the peripheral venous and arterial beds, 69 normal subjects were evaluated before and after the intravenous administration of 15 mg morphine. Venous tone was determined by three independent techniques in 22 subjects. The venous pressure measured in a hand vein during temporary circulatory arrest (isolated hand vein technique) fell from 20.2+/-1.4 to 13.4+/-0.9 mm Hg (P < 0.01) 10 min after morphine, indicating that a significant venodilation had occurred. With the acute occlusion technique, morphine induced a reduction in forearm venous tone from 12.8+/-1.1 to 7.9+/-2.3 mm Hg/ml/100 ml (P < 0.01). Although forearm venous volume at a pressure of 30 mm Hg (VV[30]) was increased from 2.26+/-0.17 to 2.55+/-0.26 ml/100 ml, measured by the equilibration technique, the change was not significant (P > 0.1). Of note is that the initial reaction to morphine was a pronounced venoconstriction, demonstrated during the first 1-2 min after the drug. (Isolated hand vein pressure increased to 37.2+/-5.4 mm Hg, P < 0.01). This rapidly subsided, and by 5 min a venodilation was evident. Morphine did not attenuate the venoconstrictor response to a single deep breath, mental arithmetic, or the application of ice to the forehead when measured by either the isolated hand vein technique or the equilibration technique. To evaluate the effects of morphine on the peripheral resistance vessels in 47 normal subjects, forearm blood flow was measured plethysmographically before and 10-15 min after the intravenous administration of 15 mg of morphine. Although mean systemic arterial pressure was unchanged, forearm blood flow increased from 2.92+/-0.28 to 3.96+/-0.46 ml/min/100 ml (P < 0.01), and calculated vascular resistance fell from 42.4+/-5.2 to 31.6+/-3.2 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml (P < 0.01). When subjects were tilted to the 45 degrees head-up position, morphine did not block the increase in total peripheral vascular resistance that occurs; however, it did significantly attenuate the forearm arteriolar constrictor response (before morphine, + 25.7+/-5.4; after morphine, + 13.7+/-5.3 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml, P < 0.05). However, morphine did not block the post-Valsalva overshoot of blood pressure, nor did it block the increase in forearm vascular resistance produced by the application of ice to the forehead. Similarly, morphine did not block the arteriolar or venoconstrictor effects of intra-arterially administered norepinephrine. Morphine infused into the brachial artery in doses up to 200 mug/min produced no changes in ipsilateral forearm VV[30], forearm blood flow, or calculated forearm resistance. Intra-arterial promethazine, atropine, and propranolol did not block the forearm arteriolar dilator response to intravenous morphine; however, intra-arterial phentolamine abolished the response. These data suggest that in human subjects, morphine induces a peripheral venous and arteriolar dilation by a reflex reduction in sympathetic alpha adrenergic tone. Morphine does not appear to act as a peripheral alpha adrenergic blocking agent but seems to attenuate the sympathetic efferent discharge at a central nervous system level.", 
    "29": "Effects of cocaine on a hypogastric nerve-vas deferens preparation of the guinea pig, in vitro, were investigated with the microelectrode and the double sucrose gap methods. 1) Cocaine, at a concentration of more than 3 X 10 minus-5 M, depolarized the membrane and enhanced the electrical activity of the postjunctional membrane. These effects were, however, not due to accumulated noradrenaline near the postjunctional membrane. 2) The electrical resistance of the postjunctional membrane was slightly increased by treatment with cocaine (3 X 10 minus-5M) but the length constant of the tissue was almost unaffected. The electrical threshold to evoke a spike from the postjunctional membrane was lowered. 3) Cocaine (3 X 10 minus-5M) did not change the amplitude and frequency of the miniature excitatory junction potentials but it markedly suppressed the amplitude of the excitatory junction potentials evoked by hypogastric nerve stimulation. Cocaine prolonged the falling phase of the excitatory junction potentials. 4) The inhibitory action of cocaine on the junction potential evoked by nerve stimulation was not specific for the adrenergic fiber. Cocaine also suppressed the amplitude of the non-adrenergic inhibitory junction potential evoked in the taenia coli by field stimulation. 5) Exogeneously applied noradrenaline enhanced the electrical and mechanical activities of the postjunctional organ but suppressed the amplitude of the excitatory junction potential. This effect of noradrenaline was still observed on pretreatment with cocaine. 6) In the presence of cocaine, the dose-response curves plotted from the mechanical activity induced by excess [K]o or by noradrenaline shifted to the left and the maximum responses evoked by either treatment were enhanced. 7) From the present experiments, it was concluded that supersensitivity induced by cocaine or cocaine potentiation of the mechanical response may be mainly due to direct action on the smooth muscle tissue rather than to inhibition of noradrenaline re-uptake into the nerve terminals.", 
    "30": "Effects of catecholamines were investigated on isolated strips of the guinea-pig stomach. In the circular muscles, the relaxation and biphasic response caused by adrenaline and noradrenaline were suppressed partly by phentolamine and also partly by propranolol. The relaxation by catecholamines in the longitudinal muscles was inhibited mainly by propranolol. Thus, there are probably two types of relaxation. Alpha relaxation was more dominant in the circular muscles and beta relaxation in the longitudinal muscles. Contractions in both muscles were mediated through alpha-effects. The circular muscle is more sensitive to the alpha effect and the longitudinal muscle to the beta effect. In the presence of propranolol, isoprenaline. Field stimulation which excited intramural nerves resulted in contraction followed by relaxation in both circular and longitudinal muscles. The inhibition of the electrically evoked contractions by adrenaline and noradrenaline in both circular and longitudinal muscles was abolished by phentolamine but the electrically evoked relaxations were affected little.", 
    "31": "We previously reported that the pressor action of propranolol was observed in the rat anesthetized with urethane. In the present study, rats, anesthetized with pentobarbitone or ether, treated with curare or unanesthetized, were used to investigate the influence of anesthetics on the blood pressure response to propranolol. Propranolol always produced a pressor response under these experimental conditions as well as urethane anesthesia. But under pentobarbitone anesthesia, the magnitude of the pressor action was significantly lower than that obtained under the other experimental conditions. It is concluded that the choice of urethane as the anesthetic does not create a situation irrelevant to that found with other anesthetics and that the cardiovascular responses of rat to propranolol are unique when compared to other species."
