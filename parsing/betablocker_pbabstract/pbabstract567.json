    "0": "A new variant of the inflation test of the Eustachian tube is presented; a constant air flow generator was constructed with minimal sensitivity to counterpressure, and variations in air pressure were measured, reflecting variations in Eustachian tube patency. By means of this test the effect of Otrivin (alpha 2-receptor stimulation) and Timacar (beta-receptor blocking) on the Eustachian tube was investigated with saline serving as reference. The following results were obtained: Otrivin lowers the opening pressure and the steady state pressure, and reduces the pressure drop during active opening. Timacar alone has no statistically significant effect on the Eustachian tube, but the combined effect of the two drugs is a more pronounced decrease in steady state pressure than the decrease seen following alpha 2-adrenergic stimulation alone. An explanation could be an alpha 2-receptor modulation by the beta-blocking agent. Consequently, autonomous regulation should be further studied in the search for a better understanding of Eustachian tube physiology.", 
    "1": "This study was undertaken to identify psychosocial and physical characteristics that independently predict anginal pain relief. The original study group comprised over 570 patients in whom the characteristics were identified at the time of coronary arteriography and who were followed up after 6 months of standard medical therapy. In the subset of 382 of these patients who were assessed as having NYHA Class III or IV angina at the time of angiography, a multivariable analysis of 101 baseline descriptors showed that higher scores on the MMPI hypochondriasis scale, unemployment, and more severe right coronary occlusion were significant independent predictors of failure to achieve two-class improvement at follow-up. These three characteristics also predicted continuing severe angina in a subsequent, independent sample of 91 new patients. These findings could help physicians select appropriate treatment by prospectively identifying patients who are unlikely to respond to standard medical treatment of angina.", 
    "2": "Isoprenaline-induced changes in activity of an endogenous, specific inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (type I inhibitor) under conditions of experimental supersensitivity of beta-adrenoceptors were investigated in rat hippocampus and brain stem. Both subchronic administration of reserpine (2.5 mg kg-1, i.p., 4 days, once daily) and i.c.v injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (250 micrograms/ventricle, bilaterally, 48 h apart), which are known to increase beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity in the rat brain, markedly enhanced the response of the type I inhibitor activity to isoprenaline. To obtain a significant decrease of type I inhibitor activity in the examined brain structures of these animals, doses of isoprenaline 2-5 times lower than in control groups had to be used. It is suggested that the isoprenaline-induced decrease of type I inhibitor activity might be used as an index of central beta-adrenoceptor reactivity in-vivo.", 
    "3": "Streptomyces gabonae KY2234 was found to produce a new compound, MY336-a, which bound to beta-adrenergic receptor. The compound was isolated from the fermentation broth of KY2234. MY336-a showed a high affinity for the beta-receptor, labeled with [3H]dihydroalprenolol in the membrane fractions of rat heart (beta 1-adrenergic receptor) or lung (beta 2-adrenergic receptor), whereas the compound bound very weakly to alpha-adrenergic receptor, labeled with [3H]dihydroergokryptine in rat brain. the inhibition constants (Ki) of the compound were 0.73 and 0.14 microM for the beta-receptors of heart and lung, respectively. 5'-Guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) did not alter the affinity of the beta-receptors for MY336-a. In isolated guinea-pig atria, MY336-a produced an inhibition of the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoproterenol. MY336-a also antagonized the relaxation of tone induced by isoproterenol in isolated guinea-pig trachea. No partial agonistic activity was detected in MY336-a in the isolated atria and trachea. In anaesthetized dogs, MY336-a (1 mg/kg, iv) exerted negative inotropic action (left ventricular dp/dt max, -32.6%).", 
    "4": "Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between nifedipine and two beta-blocking agents were investigated. Eighty mg propranolol twice daily, and 20 mg betaxolol once daily, were randomly administered orally to six young healthy male volunteers, either singly for four days, or combined with nifedipine for the two subsequent days. Nifedipine had similar effects on the pharmacodynamics of both drugs. Nifedipine significantly enhanced propranolol bioavailability and Cmax, but reduced its tmax, in three out of six subjects who were also good absorbers of beta-blockers when taken alone. These effects might be due to enhanced intestinal absorption and/or enhanced first-pass effect, induced by nifedipine.", 
    "5": "The effects of the beta-1 adrenergic agonist prenalterol and the beta-2 adrenergic agonist terbutaline on oesophageal peristalsis were studied in nine healthy volunteers with pressures recorded in the proximal, middle, and distal oesophagus. Two doses of the agonists were given after pretreatment with placebo, propranolol, or metoprolol in a double blind randomised fashion. Terbutaline 0.25 +/- 0.25 mg iv decreased peristaltic pressure in middle oesophagus from 8.1 +/- 1.1 to 5.1 +/- 0.8 kPa (p less than 0.01) and in the distal oesophagus from 9.5 +/- 1.0 to 4.7 +/- 0.6 kPa (p less than 0.001). Peristaltic velocity was decreased in the distal oesophagus after terbutaline from 3.3 +/- 0.2 cm/sec to 2.9 +/- 0.2 cm/sec (p less than 0.05). Prenalterol 1 mg iv was followed by a decrease of peristaltic pressure in the middle oesophagus from 10.2 +/- 1.3 to 7.7 +/- 1.1 kPa (p less than 0.01) and a decrease of peristaltic velocity in upper oesophagus from 3.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.3 +/- 0.1 cm/sec (p less than 0.05) while no significant changes were seen in the distal oesophagus. Pretreatment with the beta-1 blocker metoprolol 15 mg iv blocked the effects of prenalterol 1 mg iv but not the effects of terbutaline. Propranolol 10 mg iv blocked the effects of terbutaline on peristaltic pressure. After metoprolol infusion mean distal peristaltic amplitude was 11.9 +/- 0.8 kPa compared with 8.5 +/- 1.2 kPa after placebo (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation significantly decrease oesophageal peristaltic pressure in man. The body of the oesophagus seems to be under beta adrenergic inhibitory influence under physiological conditions.", 
    "6": "Vasodilatory treatment decreases exercise dyspnoea in the majority of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, due to an increase of cardiac output. Pulmonary vascular resistance declines, but pulmonary arterial pressure decreases only in some patients. Basically, the cause of the difference among \"responders\" and \"non-responders\" to this type of therapy is not known. The presence of hypertensive vascular changes in the pulmonary circulation may be a possible explanation for a lack of positive response to vasodilator treatment. This treatment is not without side effects and needs careful clinical and haemodynamic evaluation. Calcium antagonists are probably the drug of choice. There are few studies about the effect of vasodilatory treatment of \"secondary\" pulmonary hypertension due to chronic lung diseases, with differing results. Whether vasodilatory treatment can improve the life expectancy in patients with primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension is not yet known. The quality of life seems, however, to be improved, at least in some patients.", 
    "7": "The formation of 3-(4-hydroxy-1-naphthoxy)lactic acid (4-HO-NLA) from propranolol was investigated. Authentic 4-HO-NLA was synthesized from 4-methoxy-1-naphthol using methods previously used for preparation of naphthoxylactic acid (NLA). Cleavage of the 4-methyl ether was accomplished using iodotrimethylsilane in the presence of cyclopentene. After ip administration of propranolol-3,3-d2 (P-3,3-d2) (20 mg/kg) to rats, 4-HO-NLA-d2 was identified by GC-MS as a urinary metabolite. After administering pseudoracemic propranolol (S-P-d0/R-P-3,3-d2) ip to rats (20 mg/kg), parent ions of 4-HO-NLA-d0 and -d2 as methyl ester-trifluoroacetyl derivatives were monitored by GC-MS. 4-HO-NLA arose stereoselectively from S-propranolol (S/R ratio 2.6). After administering approximately equimolar quantities of 4-HO-P and P-3,3-d2 (10 mg/kg each, ip), only 4-HO-NLA-d2 arising from metabolism of P-3,3-d2 was observed by GC-MS indicating that 4-HO-P is probably not an important metabolic intermediate in vivo. In vitro experiments in the presence of the rat liver supernatant fraction performed with P-3,3-d2, NLA, and 4-HO-P showed that only NLA led to 4-HO-NLA. Incubation of NLA also produced two other hydroxylated NLA regioisomers. Incubation of 4-methoxypropanolol, a more lipophilic congener of 4-HO-P, produced no lactic acid metabolite in the presence of the rat liver supernatant fraction, indicating that poor lipophilicity is not the only deterrent to N-dealkylation of the side chain of 4-HO-P.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties and cardioselectivity of ICI 141, 292 were investigated in healthy male subjects. Seven subjects received in random order oral doses of ICI 141,292 20, 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg, atenolol 50 and 100 mg and placebo. ICI 14 292 had no effect on supine heart rate which was reduced by atenolol 100 mg. ICI 141,292 50, 100 and 200 mg had no effect on standing heart rate which was reduced by 400 mg at 2 h. Both doses of atenolol caused greater reductions. The maximum percent reduction of an exercise tachycardia after ICI 141,292 200 mg (23.9 +/- 3.7%) and 400 mg (24.3 +/- 5.2%) were similar to atenolol 50 mg (27.3 +/- 4.7%) but less than atenolol 100 mg (30.8 +/- 2.9%) (P less than 0.02). Six subjects received in random order single oral doses of ICI 141,292 100, 200 and 400 mg, atenolol 50 mg, propranolol 40 mg and placebo. Following each dose each subject received graded infusions of isoprenaline sulphate until heart rate increased by 40 beats min-1. Dose-response curves were constructed for the changes in heart rate, finger tremor, blood pressure and forearm blood flow produced by each infusion. At the 4 micrograms min-1 dose of isoprenaline, ICI 141,292 200 mg caused more attenuation than atenolol 50 mg but less than propranolol 40 mg in the changes of heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and finger tremor (P less than 0.02). ICI 141,292 400 mg caused more attenuation of the changes of all parameters than atenolol 50 mg but less attenuation of the changes in diastolic blood pressure and finger tremor than propranolol 40 mg (P less than 0.02). These results indicate that ICI 141,292 is a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity.", 
    "9": "Flestolol (ACC-9089) is a nonselective, competitive, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent, without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 minutes. This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min. In long-term infusion studies, flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta-blocking dose (5 micrograms/kg/min) for up to seven days. Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta-adrenergic blockade. Flestolol produced a dose-dependent attenuation of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers. In contrast with other beta blockers, flestolol-induced effects reverse rapidly (within 30 minutes) following discontinuation because of its short half-life. Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. In patients with unstable angina, flestolol infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling chest pain. It is concluded that flestolol is a potent, well-tolerated, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Use of flestolol in the critical care setting is currently undergoing investigation.", 
    "10": "Esmolol is an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent that possesses minimal partial agonist activity or direct membrane depressant activity. The short duration of action of esmolol is attributable to rapid enzymatic hydrolysis by red blood cell esterases, forming ASL-8123 and methanol. Experiments in the constant-flow-perfused isolated canine hindlimb indicate that therapeutic (beta blocking) doses of esmolol lack direct vascular effects and alpha-adrenergic blocking activity and that therapeutic doses do not interfere with vascoconstrictor effects of peripheral sympathetic nerve stimulation. Esmolol produces cardiac electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects consistent with those of beta blockade. Specifically, esmolol decreases heart rate, depresses atrioventricular nodal conduction, and decreases determinants of myocardial oxygen demand. The beneficial antiarrhythmic and infarct-size limiting effects of esmolol have been demonstrated in several experimental models. Whereas beta blockers in general are effective in settings of supraventricular arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, and myocardial ischemia, esmolol provides the added dimension of \"titratability.\" Thus, the short duration of action of esmolol allows for very rapid titration to a preferred steady-state level of beta blockade; rapid adjustment to different steady-state levels of beta blockade, as may be required by changing status of the patient, and rapid disappearance of beta blockade following discontinuation of esmolol infusion, should this be necessary in the event of deleterious cardiac hemodynamic effects. Thus, esmolol is ideally suited for use in the treatment of patients in whom beta blockade is desirable, but in whom level of beta blockade must be very carefully modulated.", 
    "11": "Esmolol, an ultra-short-acting, cardioselective, beta-receptor blocking agent, has been developed for use in clinical conditions requiring controlled beta-receptor blockade. Its esterase-induced rapid metabolic inactivation and resulting brief pharmacologic effect provides control over the magnitude and duration of beta-receptor blockade. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the effects of infusion of esmolol on the sympathetically mediated hemodynamic responses to stressful events during the perioperative period were evaluated in patients scheduled for surgical procedures under general anesthesia. In patients undergoing either noncardiac or cardiac surgical procedures, esmolol was effective in attenuating tachycardia that is normally seen during induction of anesthesia, laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, or sternotomy and aortic dissection by reducing the hemodynamic stress on the heart with negligible adverse effects. This much-desired cardioprotective effect of esmolol will be of special value to patients with coronary artery disease and patients with an unstable cardiovascular status who are undergoing major surgical procedures with general anesthesia.", 
    "12": "The efficacy and safety of esmolol, an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent (elimination half-life, 9 min), was investigated in 358 patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTs) in three multicenter studies (placebo-controlled, propranolol-controlled, and open-label baseline-controlled) and in 19 patients with myocardial ischemia (acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina) in a single-center, open-label study. Esmolol was infused intravenously in doses ranging from 25 micrograms/kg/min to 300 micrograms/kg/min. In SVT studies, efficacy was judged by one or more of the following: a reduction of at least 15% to 20% from the average baseline heart rate, heart rate less than 100 beats/min, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Results revealed that esmolol was superior to placebo and equal to propranolol in controlling heart rate in SVT patients. Conversion to NSR was comparable in patients treated with esmolol (14%) and in those treated with propranolol (16%). The majority of patients achieved therapeutic response at esmolol doses of 200 micrograms/kg/min or less. Among esmolol-treated patients, recovery from beta blockade (i.e., heart rate approaching baseline levels) was achieved within ten minutes after discontinuation of infusion, indicating a brief duration of action of esmolol. In contrast, beta blockade persisted 4.5 hours after discontinuation of propranolol. In patients with myocardial ischemia, esmolol effectively reduced heart rate and blood pressure, thereby decreasing rate-pressure product. The most frequent adverse effect in patients treated with esmolol was hypotension. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were reported in esmolol-treated patients. Esmolol was well tolerated in patients infused for durations of up to 24 hours and in patients with conditions for which treatment with beta blockers is inappropriate. These results suggest that esmolol effectively and rapidly controls the heart rate in patients with SVT and in patients with acute myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, because of its short half-life, esmolol offers excellent benefits as compared with the currently available beta-adrenergic blockers in the treatment of critically ill patients. Esmolol was well tolerated by patients for whom beta blockers in general would be unsuitable.", 
    "13": "In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in ten patients with asthma, the effects on specific airway resistance of esmolol, a new ultra-short-acting beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker, were compared with those of placebo. Specific airway resistance was measured during increasing doses of esmolol infusion, during dry air provocation tests, and following isoproterenol inhalation. These same studies were later carried out on six of ten patients following intravenous propranolol infusion. All patients were able to tolerate the maximum dose of esmolol (300 micrograms/kg/min); treatment differences between esmolol and placebo were not found. In contrast, intravenous propranolol produced marked symptomatic bronchoconstriction after the lowest dose (1 mg) in two of six patients. Esmolol produced slight but statistically significant enhancement of patients' sensitivity to dry air provocation. Similarly, a slight but significant inhibition of bronchomotor sensitivity to isoproterenol was noted during esmolol infusion. After infusion of 5 mg of intravenous propranolol, one of four patients had a clinically significant increase in sensitivity to dry air. It is concluded that esmolol, because of its short duration of action and relative lack of effect on airway resistance, may be preferred over propranolol in patients with asthma who require treatment with an intravenous beta-blocking agent.", 
    "14": "The effects of KF-4317 on the accumulation of radioactivity from [3H]-noradrenaline, and on the subsequent spontaneous and noradrenergic nerve-evoked outflow of radioactivity have been investigated in the rat isolated right ventricle. In addition the effects of KF-4317 on the contractions of the electrically-driven directly muscle stimulated rat right ventricle to isoprenaline and of the rat isolated aorta to phenylephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine are reported. KF-4317 at 1 microM had no effect on the ability of the rat right ventricle to accumulate radioactivity from [3H]-noradrenaline. The spontaneous outflow of radioactivity, following loading of the ventricle with [3H]-noradrenaline, was increased by KF-4317 at 1 microM by a cocaine-insensitive mechanism. KF-4317 at 1 microM had no effect on the noradrenergic nerve-evoked outflow or radioactivity, and therefore is not an alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, but reduced the associated contractile response probably mainly by acting as an antagonist at postjunctional beta 1-adrenoreceptors. KF-4317 caused a parallel rightward shift of the concentration-response curve of the electrically-driven directly muscle stimulated rat right ventricle to isoprenaline. However the inhibitory effect, X9.0 and X237.2 in the presence of 0.1 and 1 microM KF-4317, was not closely concentration-related. At 1 microM, KF-4317 also depressed the maximum responses to isoprenaline. This suggests that in addition to beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonism, KF-4317 probably exerts membrane stabilizing activity. The responses of the rat isolated aorta to phenylephrine were inhibited in a non-concentration related manner by KF-4317.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "The role of the renin-aldosterone system in predicting the hypotensive effect of beta-blockade is controversial. We have measured blood pressure, heart rate, plasma active renin, prorenin and aldosterone in 44 hypertensive patients before and after 18 weeks treatment with either nadolol or metoprolol in a double blind randomized study. Prorenin increased and active renin decreased with treatment, total renin and aldosterone remaining unchanged. After beta-blockade the correlation between active renin and prorenin improved from p less than 0.025 to p less than 0.001, and both variables attained a correlation with aldosterone. There was a weak correlation between the reduction in diastolic pressure and both pretreatment active renin and pretreatment prorenin (p less than 0.05). However, using a multiple regression analysis there was a highly significant correlation between the combination of the pretreatment values of active renin, prorenin and aldosterone and the reduction in diastolic pressure with both nadolol (p less than 0.001) and metoprolol (p less than 0.003). This indicates that the combination of active renin with prorenin and aldosterone is a reliable guide to the hypotensive effects of beta-blockade and that the failure to detect this in previous studies is most likely due to errors in the measurement of renin.", 
    "16": "Three compounds that have been suggested to irreversibly inactivate beta-adrenergic receptors were studied: NHNPNBE [N-(2-hydroxy-3-[1-napthoxy]-propyl)-N-bromoacetylethylenediami ne], BAAM (bromoacetylalprenololmenthane), and Ro 3-7894 [1-(5-chloracetylaminobenzfuran-2-yl)-2-isopropylaminoethanol++ +]. Membranes of rat cerebral cortex were used as a source of predominantly beta 1-adrenergic receptors and membranes of rat cerebellum were used as a source of predominantly beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Beta-Adrenergic receptor binding sites were studied by Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms of specific [125I]-pindolol ([125I]PIN) binding. NHNPNBE added to the incubation medium competitively inhibited specific [125I]PIN binding in both cerebellum and cerebral cortex with KI values of 1-2 microM in each tissue. After washout of membranes pretreated with NHNPNBE for 30 min at 37 degrees, no loss of specific [125I]PIN binding sites was observed in either cerebellum or cortex except at very high concentrations (30-100 microM). Ro 3-7894 caused a simple competitive inhibition of specific [125I]PIN binding in rat cerebellar membranes with a KI of approximately 14 microM, an effect which was reversed completely by washing. In cerebral cortex, Ro 3-7894 added to the incubation medium apparently decreased the density of [125I]PIN binding sites with an IC50 around 1 microM. This effect was reversed after washing the membranes twice. However, in the presence of Ro 3-7894 some Scatchard plots showed a slight curvature. Further saturation of the [125I]PIN binding sites in cerebral cortex showed that the inhibition by Ro 3-7894 was competitive but with a high- and low-affinity component, consistent with Ro 3-7894 being a beta 1-selective competitive antagonist. Ro 3-7894 was also beta 1-selective in other tissues. BAAM added to the incubation medium competitively inhibited specific [125I]PIN binding in both cerebellum and cortex with KI values of 0.006 to 0.03 microM, but was about 5-fold more potent in cerebellum. After treatment of membranes with higher concentrations of BAAM for 30 min at 37 degrees and washing twice, there was a dose-dependent decrease in the density of specific [125I]PIN binding sites with IC50 values of approximately 0.3 microM in both tissues. Similar effects were observed in rat heart. These data suggest that NHNPNBE is a simple competitive antagonist at both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors except at very high concentrations. Ro 3-7894 is a beta 1-selective competitive antagonist with no apparent irreversible effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "17": "A representative sample of Maryland physicians in three practice settings (family/general, internal medicine, and specialty practice) participated in a survey designed to identify their attitudes toward patients with high blood pressure. Respondents recommended initial laboratory investigations more frequently and treatment at lower levels of blood pressure than was the case in a national physician survey performed in 1977. Family/general practitioners were the most cautious in respect to recommending antihypertensive drug therapy. They expressed greater enthusiasm, however, for nonpharmacologic treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors. Physicians in each of the three practice settings expressed strong support for the use of diuretics as initial drug therapy in patients with mild hypertension. Impediments to long-term care were overwhelmingly believed to be patient- rather than physician-related.", 
    "18": "Electrical activity generated by pieces of pig placenta, taken from anesthetized animals and mounted in Ussing chambers, has been investigated. Ten minutes after the start of voltage clamping, potential difference (PD; fetal side positive, open circuit), short circuit current (SCC), and resistance were 5.9 +/- 0.4 (SE) mV, 8.6 +/- 0.5 microA X cm-2, and 720 +/- 45 omega X cm2, respectively (n = 50). Ouabain (10(-4) M) added to the fetal side caused a maximum decline in PD and SCC from the time of addition of -3.7 +/- 0.98 mV and -3.9 +/- 1.4 microA X cm-2 (n = 6); epinephrine (10(-5) M) added to the fetal side caused increases of +1.0 +/- 0.2 mV and +4.0 +/- 1.4 microA X cm-2, respectively (n = 14). Drug concentrations for 50% maximum response for the effect of a series of adrenergic agonists on SCC were (in M) isoproterenol 1.2 +/- 0.05 X 10(-8), norepinephrine 6.1 +/- 0.3 X 10(-8), epinephrine 2.4 +/- 0.1 X 10(-7), and phenylephrine 4.7 +/- 0.2 X 10(-5), suggesting the involvement of fetally oriented beta-adrenergic receptors. Fetal epinephrine (10(-5) M) also stimulated net Na+ flux (Jnet) toward the fetal side to an extent equal to its effect on SCC. In control experiments Jnet was small but was inhibited by fetal side ouabain (10(-4) M) to produce a maternally directed Jnet, significantly different to the SCC. Replacement of Na+ by choline reduced SCC markedly but did not abolish it. In the absence of Na+, epinephrine had no effect on SCC. These results suggest that active Na+ transfer is not completely responsible for the control electrical activity of pig placenta. Epinephrine, however, modulates SCC entirely by stimulating net Na+ transfer toward the fetal side.", 
    "19": "Bucindolol is a new nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent with direct vasodilator, partial agonist and alpha-adrenergic blocking properties. Its hemodynamic effects were evaluated in 13 healthy young men. In an open study, the effects of increasing single oral doses (50 to 200 mg) were examined. Two hours after each dose there was little effect at rest, but the responses of heart rate and systolic blood pressure to cycle exercise (50 to 150 W) were significantly reduced. There was no greater effect with larger doses. The second phase was a 3-way double-blind study comparing the effects of placebo with 50 and 200 mg of bucindolol. Left ventricular (LV) ejection phase indexes derived from digitized M-mode echocardiograms (% fractional shortening, mean and peak velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, stroke volume) increased more than 10% 2 and 4 hours after bucindolol was administered, whereas systemic vascular resistance and the ratio preejection period/LV ejection time decreased to the same extent. Although there was little effect on measurements at rest, the response to cycle exercise of heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly attenuated. These results show that the effects of bucindolol on LV systolic function are related at least in part to reduction of afterload, but do not indicate whether the drug has an additional direct inotropic effect.", 
    "20": "To determine the relative value of clinical findings, results of low-level treadmill electrocardiographic (ECG) exercise testing and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) for predicting cardiac events in the year after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 72 patients who had had an uncomplicated AMI were studied with either radionuclide angiography or 2-dimensional echocardiography to assess LVEF and a low-level treadmill exercise test before hospital discharge. All patients were followed for 1 year. Nineteen patients (26%) had at least 1 cardiac event: coronary artery bypass grafting (11 patients), recurrent AMI (6 patients) or cardiac death (6 patients). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that total cardiac events were predicted by exercise ECG ST-segment depression or angina, prior AMI, ventricular ectopic activity during exercise and digoxin therapy (cumulative r = 0.58, p less than 0.001). Coronary artery bypass grafting was predicted by exercise ECG ST-segment depression or angina (r = 0.29, p = 0.01). Recurrent AMI was predicted by exercise ECG ST-segment depression or angina, prior AMI and ventricular ectopic activity during exercise (cumulative r = 0.49, p less than 0.001). Cardiac death was predicted by an LVEF of 40% or less (r = 0.38, p = 0.01). The presence of both an LVEF of 40% or less and ECG ST-segment depression on treadmill exercise testing defined a subgroup of patients with a high incidence of early cardiac death (33%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities was studied in 11 patients with coronary artery disease and silent myocardial ischemia during exercise testing. Four patients were asymptomatic; 7 were asymptomatic after a myocardial infarction. Left ventricular wall motion abnormalities were characterized by reduced regional ejection fraction (EF) during exercise determined by gated left anterior oblique images of the cardiac blood pool. In the 11 patients, 10 anteroseptal and 8 inferoposterior regions were subserved by stenotic coronary arteries. Before beta blockade, regional EF decreased in 15 of 18 regions. After beta blockade, this occurred in only 6 of 18 regions (p less than 0.05); the other 12 regions showed no change or an actual increase in regional EF. Thus, beta-adrenergic blockade effectively improved the reduction in exercise regional EF usually seen in patients with coronary artery disease with silent myocardial ischemia. One probable mechanism of action is a reduction in myocardial oxygen requirement at peak exercise.", 
    "22": "Nifedipine is known to reduce blood pressure both acutely and chronically. However, the following questions remain to be answered: can nifedipine be given acutely and safety to patients with severe hypertension in an outpatient setting, would its efficacy be retained with long-term therapy, and is nifedipine safe in the presence of cardiomegaly? Nifedipine (10 mg capsule sublingually) was given to 46 outpatients with severe or apparently refractory hypertension; 19 were followed-up for 18 months and 18 for 24 months. Nifedipine reduced blood pressure acutely and safely in 43 of 46 outpatients (mean control diastolic pressure 137 mm Hg), irrespective of prior treatment regimen. Blood pressure levels after 2 to 24 months of twice daily oral nifedipine (10 mg) were similar to 20-minutes levels, showing that tolerance did not occur. In a separate series of 37 patients, who had radiologic cardiomegaly in addition to hypertension, the control ejection fraction was 62%. Nifedipine, when used acutely, slightly increased the ejection fraction to 65% (p less than 0.005). Our studies show that in outpatients with severe hypertension, sublingual nifedipine is an antihypertensive agent which acts swiftly and safely, without causing a decrease in the ejection fraction when it is used for acute blood pressure reduction, and that subsequent therapy with oral nifedipine results in a predictive long-term hypotensive effect.", 
    "23": "The direct inotropic actions of ethmozine and of its diethylamine analog, ethacizin, were studied in the presence of muscarinic and beta-adrenoreceptor blockade in 12 ferret right ventricular papillary muscles. In each muscle ethmozine caused a small but consistent and significant (p less than 0.05) increase in contractile performance, whereas ethacizin significantly (p less than 0.05) diminished contractility. Although both phenothiazines are fast channel blockers, it appears that the net positive inotropic action of ethmozine is due to its stimulatory effect on the slow inward current and that the negative inotropic action of ethacizin is largely due to its recently demonstrated decreases of the slow inward current.", 
    "24": "Knowledge of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia has been greatly enhanced recently by new information on coronary artery spasm. This phenomenon accounts for the mechanism underlying the attacks of resting chest pain in Prinzmetal's angina and plays a role in almost all aspects of ischemic heart disease. The diagnosis of coronary artery spasm can be made presumptively with noninvasive methods, but definitive documentation is usually obtained in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. The nitrate derivatives and the calcium antagonists provide a safe and effective approach to therapy.", 
    "25": "The antagonist potencies of amosulalol (YM-09538), its stereoisomers and the corresponding desoxy derivative (YM-11133) have been compared at alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors in isolated organs in vitro and in radioligand binding experiments. In isolated peripheral tissues, (+/-)-, (-)- and (+)-amosulalol and YM-11133 are selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists over alpha-2 adrenoceptors by two orders of magnitude and are nonselective beta adrenoceptor antagonists. (+)-Amosulalol and YM-11133 were 14 and 9.3 times more potent than (-)-amosulalol as alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists but approximately 50 and 40 times less potent antagonists at beta adrenoceptors than (-)-amosulalol, respectively. The adrenoceptor blocking profile of the racemate is approximately 2-fold less potent than that of the (+)-isomer at alpha and that of the (-)-isomer at beta adrenoceptors. The affinities of (+/)-, (-)- and (+)-amosulalol and YM-11133 obtained from radioligand binding experiments (pKi) using rat brain membrane correlated well with those obtained from in vitro experiments (pA2) at alpha-1 (r = 0.884), alpha-2 (r = 0.977), beta-1 (r = 0.993) and beta-2 (r = 0.971) adrenoceptors. These results indicate that the stereochemical requirements of alpha and beta adrenoceptors differ for the stereoisomers of amosulalol with the alpha adrenoceptor subtypes favoring the (+)-isomer and the desoxy form and the beta subtypes favoring the (-)-isomer.", 
    "26": "Effects of stimulation of the splanchnic nerves (gastric sympathetic nerves) on the histamine-induced increases in gastric acid secretion and mucosal blood flow (MBF) were studied in anesthetized rats. The gastric acid secretion and MBF were increased by i.v. infusion of a submaximal dose of histamine (50 micrograms/kg/min). Stimulation of the splanchnic nerve, carried out under an increased steady state of acid secretion and MBF, inhibited the histamine-induced acid secretion and MBF and these effects were abolished by phentolamine and augmented by propranolol. The manner of inhibition by splanchnic nerve stimulation was similar to the inhibitory effects of vasopressin on histamine-induced acid secretion and MBF, but differed from the inhibitory effects of somatostatin; i.v. infusion of vasopressin reduced both histamine-induced acid secretion and MBF, whereas i.v. infusion of somatostatin reduced the histamine-induced acid secretion more effectively than MBF. Inhibitory effects of splanchnic nerve stimulation or infusion of vasopressin on the histamine-induced gastric acid secretion and MBF paralleled the increases in the systemic blood pressure during such treatment. These results suggest that the splanchnic nerves have no direct inhibitory effect on the histamine-induced gastric acid secretion in rats. Decreases in the histamine-induced gastric acid secretion are probably secondary to the decrease in the MBF during splanchnic nerve stimulation.", 
    "27": "Beta adrenergic antagonists, while useful in the treatment of glaucoma, can be absorbed transocularly causing a variety of systemic side effects. An adequate animal model which simultaneously indicates the intraocular pressure lowering effects as well as the systemic effects of ocularly applied beta-adrenergic antagonists would be highly useful. The pentobarbital anesthetized dog, instrumented to record blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) and in which intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured with a pneumatonometer, was investigated. Isoproterenol iv dose-response curves were run and IOP measured before and hourly for 3 hr following ocular application of 50 microliters 0.5% RS-52367 (a Syntex beta-adrenergic antagonist), or dH2O control. Timolol and RS-52367 produced similar decreases in IOP. However, timolol decreased basal BP and HR, markedly inhibited isoproterenol-induced BP and HR responses, and also decreased contralateral IOP. Systemic effects of RS-52367 were far more mild. Since both the IOP lowering and systemic beta-adrenergic antagonist properties of timolol were elicited, the anesthetized dog appears to be an excellent animal model for examining the effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists applied topically to the eye.", 
    "28": "The nature of beta-adrenergic binding by swine corpora lutea and granulosa cells was examined with the specific beta-adrenergic radioligand, (+/-)3-[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Saturation analyses revealed the presence of high affinity (Kd = 15.2 +/- 2.1 pM; n = 8 experiments) and low capacity (6.7 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg protein) beta-adrenergic receptors on porcine corpora lutea membranes. The properties of beta-adrenergic binding were determined by computer modeling of competition studies with a variety of compounds selective for beta-adrenergic subtypes. These studies disclosed predominantly beta 1-adrenergic receptors on pig luteal membranes. This inference from radioligand binding studies was corroborated functionally by the approximately equipotent biological effects of L-norepinephrine and L-epinephrine on cAMP production by luteal tissue (respective EC50s of 282 +/- 31 and 187 +/- 66 nM; n = 3 experiments). Physiological regulation of specific beta-adrenergic receptor content in the swine ovary was indicated by prominent (up to 9-fold) variations in receptor concentrations among corpora lutea and granulosa cells at various stages of maturity. In addition, there was differential expression of beta-adrenergic receptor subtype. Whereas the beta-adrenergic receptor subtype was predominantly beta 1 in corpora hemorrhagica and corpora lutea, granulosa cells and corpora albicantia contained principally beta 2 receptors. This difference could not be accounted for by blood cell contamination of corpora lutea, since swine blood cells contained predominantly (greater than 98%) beta 2-receptors, which were present at less than 8.6% the concentration of total beta-receptors in luteal tissue. In summary, swine corpora lutea and granulosa cells contain specific high affinity, low capacity beta-adrenergic receptors that are functionally coupled to biological responses. Moreover, total receptor content as well as beta-adrenergic subtype exhibit significant physiological variation in relation to maturational status of ovarian follicular and luteal tissue.", 
    "29": "A double-blind randomized study was designed to investigate differences in the recovery of finger skin temperature after finger cooling during dosing with placebo or one of four beta-blockers: propranolol, atenolol, pindolol, and acebutolol. In 11 normotensive nonsmoking subjects, finger skin temperature was measured with a thermocouple before and 20 minutes after immersion of one hand in a water bath at 16 degrees C. This finger cooling test caused no significant changes in systemic hemodynamics such as arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and forearm blood flow. The recovery of finger skin temperature during propranolol dosing was better than that during pindolol and atenolol dosing. There were no differences between the recoveries of skin temperature during pindolol, atenolol, and acebutolol dosing. Thus we could demonstrate no favorable effect of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or beta 1-selectivity on the recovery of finger skin temperature after finger cooling.", 
    "30": "Tertatolol is a potent new beta-blocker with no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or beta 1/beta 2-receptor subtype selectivity. When given at therapeutic doses (5 mg/day) to human subjects it induced a reduction in the beta-adrenergic receptor number measured by 3H-CGP 12177 specific binding, without any change in the affinity on intact lymphocytes. This reduction was seen 7 hours (54%), 24 hours (35%), and 48 hours (30%) after a single drug dose. A similar receptor reduction was observed 7 hours (42%), 24 hours (37%), and 48 hours (15%) after 14 doses of the drug. In parallel, the pharmacologic efficacy of the drug was evident from the reduction in supine and upright heart rates and after submaximal exercise; heart rate was reduced to the same extent after single or repeated drug doses. The reduction of receptor number correlated well with the reduction in heart rate in the supine (P less than 0.001) and upright (P less than 0.01) positions and after exercise (P less than 0.02). In in vitro competitive binding experiments tertatolol was found to be a competitive inhibitor of beta-adrenergic receptors. However, on intact human lymphocytes preincubated with this drug, tertatolol reduced the density of beta-adrenergic receptors. We conclude that tertatolol, besides competitively inhibiting beta-adrenergic receptors, induced a marked and lasting decrease in the beta-adrenergic receptor number. This effect may be important for its beta-blocking effects.", 
    "31": "The endogenous level of epidermal cyclic AMP does not remain constant but increases rapidly and transiently after removal of the tissue; this is known as the \"ischemia\" effect. UVB-irradiated epidermis which shows increased beta-adrenergic response revealed an increased ischemia effect, while psoriatic involved epidermis which shows decreased beta-adrenergic response revealed a decreased ischemia effect. Because of the similar rise-and-fall pattern between the ischemia effect and the beta-adrenergic response, the mechanism of the ischemia effect was investigated, especially in terms of the beta-adrenergic relationship. The ischemic rise of epidermal cyclic AMP was well preserved after 6 h pretreatment at 4 degrees C, and, following the pretreatment, the skin markedly increased its cyclic AMP level by the 37 degrees C treatment with 1 mM isobutylmethyl xanthine. The addition of propranolol or cimetidine at the time of 37 degrees C treatment (following the 4 degrees C pretreatment) had no effect on the ischemia effect; both skin groups markedly increased their cyclic AMP levels to an extent similar to that of the control skin. However, the addition of propranolol at the time of both preincubation (at 4 degrees C) and incubation (at 37 degrees C) markedly decreased the ischemic rise of cyclic AMP. Similar treatment by cimetidine had no effect on the ischemia effect. There was no significant difference in cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activities among skin groups by propranolol or cimetidine pretreatment. These results indicate that the so-called ischemic rise of epidermal cyclic AMP is actually the beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase-dependent process. Our results also indicate that the magnitude of the \"ischemic\" rise of cyclic AMP is generally parallel to the beta-adrenergic responsiveness of epidermis.", 
    "32": "Inhibitory effects of propranolol on the contractions to various treatments were investigated in the epididymal half of the rat vas deferens. Reportedly, 10(-5)-3 X 10(-4) M propranolol inhibited 150 mM K-induced contractions dose-dependently; 3 X 10(-4) M propranolol abolished the contractions. The present results showed that propranolol at concentrations up to 10(-4) M did not inhibit the maximal contractions to 10(-3) M norepinephrine (NE) or 10(-2) M methacholine (MCh). Propranolol at 3 X 10(-4) M slightly inhibited contractions to NE and MCh by 11% and 12%, respectively. In contrast, propranolol inhibited twitch components of the contractions induced by nerve stimulations at similar doses to those reported for high K contractions. Propranolol also inhibited contractions to Ca in high K-containing solution and shifted the dose-response curve to the right. Propranolol did not affect the depolarizations by high K measured by microelectrodes. Propranolol at concentrations of 10(-5)-3 X 10(-5) M diminished the magnitude of spikes dose-dependently. Spikes were rarely observed in the presence of 10(-4) M propranolol in spite of generation of e.j.p.s with amplitudes that would be sufficient to induce spikes in the absence of propranolol. These results suggest that propranolol inhibits contractions by decreasing Ca-influx through the potential-operated Ca-channels in the smooth muscle cells of rat vas deferens.", 
    "33": "The effects of metoprolol, administered in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction was studied in 126 patients. Patients were treated in a double-blind randomized fashion, with metoprolol -15 mg, intravenously followed by 100 mg twice daily for 15 days or placebo, with a mean delay of 8.1 hours from onset of symptoms. All patients underwent 24 hour Holter monitoring on days 1, 5 and 15 after randomization. Although there was no antiarrhythmic effect on day 1, metoprolol reduced the number of hours with warning arrhythmias (greater than 30 ventricular ectopics/hour, any R/T ectopics or ventricular tachycardia) on both days 5 (35 +/- 16% vs 8 +/- 11%; P less than 0.05) and day 15 (13 +/- 37% vs 4 +/- 13%; P less than 0.05). Metoprolol also reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion -6% vs 0%; P = 0.058. Metoprolol, administered in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction, had an antiarrhythmic effect which was evident only in the later phase of the study.", 
    "34": "This work reports a study of cardiovascular effects of elliptinium, a recently-acquired antitumoral agent, acutely administered i.v. in the dog. Its hemodynamic effects (10 parameters) are detailed, and their mechanism of action is investigated by antagonist administration and determination of blood and plasma histamine levels. Elliptinium induces vasodilation and tachycardia. The former is mainly due to histamine release, and a brief and slight release of prostaglandins; the latter is due to a reflex to hypotension and release of catecholamines. These results agree with others using various compounds of the ellipticine family and anthracycline antitumoral agents. They suggest treatment to prevent anaphylactoid side effects observed with this drug in man and they raise the question of the usefulness, in antitumoral agent, of histamine releasing properties.", 
    "35": "Effects of ketamine were investigated on atrial rate and contractile force in the isolated, blood-perfused canine atrium. When a relatively small dose (3 micrograms) of ketamine was injected into the sinus node artery, positive chronotropic and inotropic responses were consistently observed. With doses of 10-300 micrograms i.a., biphasic (i.e., negative followed by positive) chronotropic and inotropic responses were induced. An extremely large dose of ketamine frequently produced biphasic chronotropic and only negative inotropic responses. The negative effects of ketamine were not affected by atropine pretreatment. After treatment with propranolol or imipramine, the positive effects were significantly suppressed. The effects were not influenced by tetrodotoxin. These results suggest that ketamine has (a) indirect cardioexcitatory properties mediated by a release of catecholamines which is due to a tyramine-like action, and (b) direct cardioinhibitory properties by which high doses depress the contractility rather than the pacemaker activity.", 
    "36": "The maximal increases in heart rate produced by intravenous xamoterol in anaesthetized cats and rats are less than that of (-)-isoprenaline. In cats, blood pressure was slightly raised, while in rats, supramaximal cardiac-stimulant doses produced reductions in blood pressure. In anaesthetized guinea pigs, cardiac-stimulant effects of xamoterol were evident only after treatment with hexamethonium. In all three species cardiovascular responses to xamoterol were antagonized by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Thus, xamoterol is a partial agonist which displays beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity. In cats, infusions of xamoterol elicited beta-adrenoceptor-mediated increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output, while calculated total peripheral resistance was little affected and, unexpectedly, stroke volume was reduced. These cardiovascular effects were unaffected by hexamethonium or captopril. Both xamoterol and (-)-isoprenaline elevated left ventricular dP/dtmax and reduced central venous pressure. When cat heart rate was paced over a range (175-250 beats/min) corresponding to the beta-receptor-mediated chronotropic effects, an inverse relationship between rate and stroke volume was observed. The rate-induced reduction in stroke volume offers the best explanation for the decrease in stroke volume produced by xamoterol. In general, the effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists on stroke volume in the anaesthetized cat appear to represent a balance between a rate-related reduction and a drug-induced elevation of this parameter.", 
    "37": "Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that alpha 2-adrenoceptor activation reversed arachidonic acid induced diuresis in the rat. However, the site of action was not elucidated. Since prostaglandin E2 is the predominant prostaglandin metabolite of arachidonic acid, we studied the effect of renal alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induced cAMP formation. The study was done in intact single nephron segments and glomeruli. All incubations were done in the presence of 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and propranolol at 37 degrees C for two minutes. PGE2 increased cellular cAMP levels in the thin descending limb of Henle (tDL), cortical collecting tubule (CCT) and glomerulus. Alpha 2-adrenoceptors were activated with varying concentrations of epinephrine (E). In the tDL, alpha 2-adrenoceptor activation with E (5 X 10(-6)M to 5 X 10(-5)M) suppressed (p less than 0.05) PGE2 stimulated cAMP production by 35%. This suppression by E was inhibited by 5 X 10(-6)M yohimbine but not by 5 X 10(-6)M prazosin confirming alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediation of the effects of E. Conversely, in the CCT and glomerulus, E had no effect on PGE2-stimulated increases in cellular cAMP levels. Thus, the capacity of alpha 2-adrenoceptors to inhibit PGE2-stimulated adenylate cyclase is anatomic site-specific. This effect of alpha 2-adrenoceptors on cAMP in the tDL may explain, at least in part, the effect of alpha 2-adrenoceptors on arachidonic acid induced diuresis in the rat.", 
    "38": "CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase is thought to be a rate-limiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine synthesis. This enzyme has not been well studied in intestine. We found that activity was greater in the non-lipid stimulated state (cytosolic form of the enzyme) than any previous tissue investigated (2.7 nM/min per mg protein). On addition of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, the enzyme only increased in activity 2.4-fold which is less than any previously reported tissue on lipid stimulation. As compared to liver, the enzyme was resistant to inhibition by chlorpromazine (gut, 100% activity remaining at 80 microM; 14% in liver). Tetracaine and propranolol were found to be impotent as inhibitors of the intestinal enzyme. Octanol-water partitioning showed that both chlorpromazine and tetracaine were hydrophobic, propranolol was not. pKa studies demonstrated that at the reaction pH, chlorpromazine would be uncharged. Physiologic experiments in which de novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis was either stimulated by bile duct fistulization and triacylglycerol infusion or suppressed by including phosphatidylcholine in a lipid infusion demonstrated that the enzyme (cytosolic enzyme) responded by decreasing Vmax but that the Km remained the same. In sum, these studies suggest that CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase in intestine is unique as compared to other tissues and that its response to a physiological stimulus is counter to that which would be adaptive.", 
    "39": "The available data indicate that the beta-adrenergic receptors that mediate positive inotropic responses undergo \"down-regulation,\" a cellularly mediated decrease in surface receptor number, in congestive heart failure. This decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor number is proportional to the degree of myocardial dysfunction and the loss of contractility that occurs in congestive heart failure. It appears to be chamber-specific, occurring to the greatest degree in the most severely affected ventricular chamber, and is specific to the beta 1-adrenergic receptor subtype. Beta-adrenergic receptor down-regulation may be the result of the excessively high levels of plasma catecholamines seen in congestive heart failure, inasmuch as a similar phenomenon of beta-adrenergic receptor down-regulation is seen in animals treated with high doses of catecholamines. The specific down-regulation in cardiac beta receptors may be, in part, the cause of the decrease in myocardial function observed during long-term beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, and an actual decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor number has been observed in myocardial tissue from patients with congestive heart failure. Down-regulation of beta receptors in congestive heart failure results in a decrease or loss of efficacy of beta-adrenergic receptor agonists on long-term administration. This is especially evident for partial agonists, which are more dependent on receptor number for their positive inotropic effects than full agonists. Although beta receptors are down-regulated in congestive heart failure, myocardial alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and histamine H2 receptors do not appear to be subject to this same regulatory process. Inasmuch as stimulation of both of these receptors results in a positive inotropic effect, further study should be given to the potential therapeutic utility of selective stimulation of myocardial alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and histamine H2 receptors in congestive heart failure. It is evident that the status of specific receptor subtypes in pathophysiologic states such as congestive heart failure must be considered when assessing the likelihood of success in treating patients with beta-adrenergic receptor agonists.", 
    "40": "The precise role of adrenergic activity in congestive cardiomyopathy has not been established. A number of mechanisms through which increased catecholamine levels may be harmful, along with the clinical and experimental evidence supporting this concept, are summarized in this review. In this context, the suggestion that beta blockers may be beneficial for patients with severe heart failure, despite their well-known propensity to decrease cardiac contractility, can be better understood. Published reports on the use of beta blocker therapy for congestive cardiomyopathy now include approximately 200 patients, but have yielded inconsistent results. Non-randomized trials in Sweden have suggested increased survival, with most patients having improved functional status while receiving beta blockade, although improvement may take three to six months to become evident. The Swedish group also reported clinical deterioration after discontinuation of beta blockade. Two recent randomized trials in America yielded promising results, but the unexpectedly low mortality in the placebo groups emphasizes the critical importance of concurrent controls. Unfavorable reports have involved small groups with short-duration therapy. Even in these reports, overt aggravation of clinical heart failure has been quite infrequent but sometimes profound. As large scale trials are undertaken, an obvious goal is the development of methods to differentiate the patients with congestive cardiomyopathy who will benefit in response to beta blocker therapy from the few patients who will have a serious adverse response.", 
    "41": "Recent reports have confirmed that some slow calcium channel inhibitors have useful antihypertensive properties because they produce dilatation of the peripheral arterioles without reflex tachycardia. Verapamil is such a drug, but its clinical role in the management of hypertension is not clear. An open crossover trial was performed to compare the 24-hour profiles of blood pressure reduction after long-term therapy with a standard beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, and verapamil. Nineteen patients were studied by continuous ambulatory intraarterial recording and the order of drug administration was determined by random allocation. The drugs were administered 2 times a day and titrated according to casual clinic pressures (propranolol, 40 to 240 mg 2 times a day; verapamil, 120 to 240 mg 2 times a day). Mean hourly blood pressure and heart rate values were obtained over a 24-hour cycle and the responses to isometric and dynamic exercise were also examined. The drugs produced a uniform and comparable reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, together with a reduction in heart rate, which was greater with propranolol. Comparable effects were also seen on the pressor responses to exercise. Both drugs were equally well tolerated and caused no patient withdrawals. Thus, oral verapamil given 2 times a day shows a degree of efficacy similar to that of propranolol and provides 24-hour blood pressure control. This slow calcium channel inhibitor was well tolerated and may be used as initial therapy for hypertension.", 
    "42": "The efficacy and safety of verapamil and propranolol were examined in 14 hypertensive patients (mean age 51.2, range 30 to 65) in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of verapamil, 360 mg, propranolol, 240 mg, these 2 formulations in combination and placebo, each given for 4 weeks. Supine blood pressure, heart rate, atrioventricular conduction (PR interval) and left ventricular function were measured. All treatments reduced diastolic blood pressure (mean +/- standard deviation) (p less than 0.001): placebo to 106.6 +/- 8.1 mm Hg; propranolol to 93.8 +/- 7.7; verapamil to 89.8 +/- 7.8; the combination to 84.1 +/- 6.1, but the effect of the combination was significantly greater than that of either drug alone (p less than 0.05). Heart rate at rest (placebo, 80.2 +/- 12.2 beats/min) was reduced by propranolol (63.3 +/- 9.4, p less than 0.001), but not by verapamil (79.0 +/- 8.9). However, the addition of verapamil to propranolol led to a further reduction in heart rate (56.9 +/- 8.4, p less than 0.005). PR interval was prolonged significantly by the combination (185.5 +/- 35.3 ms) when compared with placebo (154.0 +/- 22.7); propranolol (159.1 +/- 21.2) and verapamil (165.5 +/- 32.4) (p less than 0.005 for each). The active drugs increased end-diastolic dimension and end-systolic dimension. For each variable, the effect of the combination was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Fractional shortening was not altered significantly by any of the treatments. Thus verapamil plus propranolol is a very effective antihypertensive combination but heart rate, atrioventricular conduction and left ventricular function may be affected adversely, necessitating careful monitoring of therapy.", 
    "43": "A clinical trial in 24 patients with essential arterial hypertension (14 women and 10 men, mean age 47.5) was conducted on a double-blind basis using a placebo, 240-mg verapamil and 100-mg atenolol daily. The total duration of the trial was 12 weeks: a 2-week washout period on placebo, a 4-week period on one of the trial drugs, a second 2-week weaning period and a further 4-week treatment period on the other trial drug. Stabilization of the hypertension was obtained in 80% of the patients on verapamil and 71% of the patients on atenolol both in the supine and upright positions; there was no significant difference between the 2 drugs. A moderate decrease in heart rate was obtained. Sinus bradycardia was observed in 3 patients on verapamil and 4 patients on atenolol. No instances of atrioventricular block were observed on electrocardiogram. No adverse effects were reported with verapamil and in only 1 patient taking atenolol. Adequate stabilization of hypertension appears possible in most patients with both verapamil and atenolol.", 
    "44": "Calcium-channel blockers have been successfully used in the treatment of angina of effort and systemic hypertension. Many patients present with concomitant angina pectoris and hypertension. Controlled clinical trials demonstrate that the calcium-channel blockers are safe and effective as monotherapy in the treatment of these patients, and that their use compares favorably with that of propranolol. The effectiveness of these agents in hypertension appears to be primarily due to their ability to induce systemic vasodilation. Calcium-channel blockers have several therapeutic effects in angina pectoris. Beneficial actions on the major determinants of oxygen consumption, i.e. heart rate, blood pressure and contractility, are generally seen. The potent coronary vasodilating actions of these agents allow for increased coronary blood flow. Improvements in ventricular compliance, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and cardioprotection appear to be additional effects of the calcium-channel blockers; their contribution to the drugs' overall therapeutic efficacy is presently being evaluated. Calcium-channel blockers are a welcome addition to drug regimens available for the management of patients with coexisting angina pectoris and hypertension.", 
    "45": "The distribution of alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenoceptors has been studied in the midbrain and forebrain of normal and reeler mutant mice, using autoradiographic visualization of radioiodinated HEAT and ICYP, respectively. All cortical structures and nuclear groups of the murine forebrain and midbrain bind ICYP and HEAT. For each ligand, there is substantial regional variation in binding density and these variations tend to observe boundaries between nuclei or cortical regions or the stratification of cortical regions. Regional variations in binding densities are generally different for ICYP and HEAT. Binding sites for ICYP are distributed densely throughout all fields of the neocortex (particularly, layers I-III greater than VI) and paleocortex, the striatum, pallidum, substantia nigra and superficial strata of the superior colliculus. Dense concentrations of binding sites for HEAT in cortical structures, by contrast, are limited to frontal (all layers except IV) and anterior cingulate regions of the neocortex and, as with ICYP, the stratum lacunosum-moleculaire of the regio superior of the hippocampal formation. In subcortical structures, again in contrast to the pattern with ICYP, binding density is greatest in the principal nuclei of the dorsal thalamus and the septal nuclei. The regional binding patterns of both ICYP and HEAT in the reeler brain are identical to those in the normal animal. Differential laminar binding patterns within the neocortex are approximately inverted in the two genotypes, however. Thus, binding of ICYP is densest in an inner zone of the mutant, but in the outer 3 layers of the normal neocortex. Binding of this ligand is of relatively lower density in an outer zone of the mutant and in the inner 3 layers of the normal neocortex. Similar inversions are characteristic of the laminar binding patterns of HEAT in the frontal, primary sensory and associational cortical regions of the two genotypes where densest binding is encountered superficially in reeler but at deeper levels of the normal neocortex.", 
    "46": "The antianginal and antiarrhythmic role of calcium antagonists is well established. Recent preliminary studies have indicated that, like beta blockers, calcium antagonists may produce short- and long-term hypotensive effects in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The pharmacologic properties of calcium antagonists provide a clear rationale for their use in the control of essential hypertension. The comparative hypotensive effects of verapamil (80 to 160 mg 3 times a day) and propranolol (40 to 120 mg 3 times a day) were evaluated over 4 weeks, preceded by a 4-week placebo phase, in a double-blind protocol in 17 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Verapamil (n = 10) reduced the mean sitting systolic blood pressure by 10.7% (p less than 0.01) and standing by 7.6% (p less than 0.04). The corresponding data for propranolol (n = 7) were 4.8% (not significant) and 5% (p = 0.04). Verapamil reduced the sitting diastolic blood pressure by 10.8% (p less than 0.01), propranolol by 7.5% (p = 0.01); the standing diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 10.7% with verapamil (p less than 0.01) and by 8.6% (p = 0.01) with propranolol. With verapamil the mean heart rate fell from 77.60 +/- 8.42 to 70.20 +/- 4.85 beats/min (p = 0.03); with propranolol it fell from 76.85 +/- 6.91 to 66.29 +/- 4.54 beats/min (p less than 0.01). Although a trend towards a slightly greater hypotensive effect was apparent with verapamil compared with propranolol, the difference was not statistically significant. It is concluded that verapamil and propranolol exert comparable hypotensive potency in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "47": "The demonstration that antihypertensive drug treatment reduces mortality and morbidity in persons with mild hypertension has extended the indications for treatment. Verapamil, nitrendipine, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are equally effective in reducing blood pressure. The choice of which drug to use depends on the presence or absence of specific contraindications and the occurrence of adverse effects in the individual patient.", 
    "48": "In pentobarbital-anesthetized cats, over arterial paCO2 values of 20-60 mm Hg, cerebral blood flow (CBF, Xenon) and cardiac output (CO, thermal dilution) show positively inflicted curves with slopes significantly greater than zero. To examine the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) in these responses, bilateral stereotactic thermo-coagulation lesions of the LC were made. The effect of lesions confirmed to involve the LC bilaterally (n = 10), were compared with the effects of misdirected lesions placed in the cerebellum and lateral to the LC (n = 10) and sham lesions (n = 10). Ten days after the lesioning procedure, the animals were re-anesthetized with pentobarbital and paCO2 response curves were determined for CBF and CO prior to and following intravenous administration of propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.). The results obtained with the sham-operated animals and the animals with lesions outside of the LC were indistinguishable. Bilateral LC lesions had no significant effect on normocapnic CBF as compared to control animals. They did, however, significantly reduce the slope of the CBF paCO2 response curve. Propranolol produced a significant reduction in CBF in lesioned and non-lesioned animals measured at all levels of pCO2 and did not alter the slope of the pCO2 response curve for any group as compared to predrug values. Bilateral lesions of the LC did not significantly alter either normocapnic CO or the slope of the CO-paCO2 relationship, but did reduce the elevation in mean arterial blood pressure otherwise observed during hypercarbia. Measurement of norepinephrine levels in cortex indicate a close correlation between the ability of the lesion to reduce norepinephrine content and produce the observed physiological effects. The results of these experiments suggest that the hypercapnic response of CBF, but not CO to arterial paCO2 is modulated by systems which traverse the dorsal brainstem. The role of the locus coeruleus-catecholamine cell bodies in this effect, however, must be considered speculative until further transmitter-selective interventions are carried out.", 
    "49": "Possible receptor changes occurring after withdrawal of chronic nifedipine treatment or chronic propranolol treatment were examined by administering nifedipine (100 mg/kg per day) or propranolol (45 mg/kg per day) to rats for 2 weeks and then withdrawing treatment [3H]Nitrendipine and [3H]DHA binding were measured in membrane fragments of the ventricle. In propranolol-treated rats, 8 h after the last administration, the maximum binding for [3H]DHA was significantly increased from 79.9 +/- 8.0 to 139.8 +/- 12.8 fmol/mg protein (mean +/- S.E.); the dissociation constant was significantly increased from 4.9 +/- 0.7 to 10.7 +/- 1.2 nM. On the other hand, in nifedipine-treated rats, 12 and 48 h after the last administration, [3H]nitrendipine binding and [3H]DHA binding had not changed significantly. These results indicate that the mechanism of the calcium antagonist withdrawal syndrome may be different from that of beta-blocker withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "50": "Platelet activating factor (PAF; 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is a potent bioactive phospholipid released from platelets, neutrophils, basophils and macrophages that has been proposed as a mediator of anaphylaxis, acute lung injury and other disorders. Specific factors which stabilize PAF and/or regulate PAF activity in body fluids are largely unknown. As part of a general autacoid-serum protein binding screen, the platelet activating factor-alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (PAF-AAG) interaction was indirectly characterized by examining the ability of PAF to displace propranolol from AAG. Both PAF and its deacetylated metabolite (lyso-PAF), at 20 microM, doubled the fraction unbound of propranolol (0.4 microM) from purified human AAG (20 microM). None of the other autacoids that were studied (epinephrine, serotonin, spermidine, putrescine, leu-enkephalin or phenethylamine) exhibited any propranolol displacement activity. Scatchard analysis indicated that PAF competitively displaced propranolol from AAG, causing the apparent affinity constant for propranolol-AAG to decrease from 1.8 X 10(5) M to 6.9 X 10(4) M. PAF behaved qualitatively like chlorpromazine (a documented inhibitor of propranolol binding to AAG), but PAF was less effective at displacing propranolol. The apparent binding to AAG may help stabilize and transport extracellular PAF. Furthermore, the interaction of PAF and AAG suggests that serum AAG, which fluctuates in a number of diseases, may function to regulate PAF activity during acute and chronic disease states.", 
    "51": "We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of adding topically administered betaxolol 0.5% twice daily in 39 patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma already being treated with dipivefrin 0.1% twice daily. The addition of the betaxolol significantly decreased (P less than .01) the mean intraocular pressure after two weeks (2.82 mm Hg) and four weeks (3.63 mm Hg). There were no significant changes in pulse rate, mean arterial pressure, or pupil diameter. The administration of betaxolol to patients already receiving dipivefrin appears to be clinically useful.", 
    "52": "The release of insulin which occurred in response to arginine, in the conscious calf, differed from that which occurs in response to glucose in that it was not significantly affected by either adrenergic or muscarinic blocking agents. Release of pancreatic glucagon was reduced by pretreatment with phentolamine.", 
    "53": "In clinical trials, antihypertensive therapy with beta blockers and methyldopa has resulted in adverse changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. To investigate whether such effects can be observed in a general population in which beta blockers and methyldopa are prescribed widely for the treatment of high blood pressure, plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels were compared in subjects receiving antihypertensive treatment, subjects with untreated high blood pressure, and subjects with normal blood pressure; these subjects were drawn from a random sample of 5,603 men and women screened in a national study of risk-factor prevalence in Australia. In both sexes, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower in the group receiving treatment for hypertension than in the other groups (p less than 0.001). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in normotensive subjects and subjects with untreated high blood pressure were identical. In men, triglyceride levels and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were higher in the group receiving treatment than in the other groups (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively). In both sexes, the differences in plasma lipids and lipoproteins between treated and untreated hypertensive groups were independent of age, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and smoking. More than 40 percent of untreated hypertensive subjects and more than 50 percent of treated hypertensive subjects had elevated total cholesterol levels (greater than or equal to 252 mg/dl) or an elevated ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (greater than or equal to 6.0) in comparison with less than 30 percent of normotensive subjects. These results indicate that even without treatment, a large proportion of persons with high blood pressure had a significant abnormality in plasma cholesterol. The observation of a lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in subjects receiving treatment for high blood pressure suggests that antihypertensive therapy as prescribed in this study population had worsened the already poor plasma lipid and lipoprotein profile of the average hypertensive patient.", 
    "54": "The effects of prazosin and atenolol monotherapy on plasma lipid concentrations were compared in 51 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Prazosin monotherapy (mean dose 5.4 +/- 5.3 mg per day) resulted in a significant decrease in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; these changes were evident at three months and at six to 12 months. Atenolol monotherapy (mean dose 66 +/- 23 mg per day) resulted in a significant increase in plasma triglyceride concentration that persisted during one year of treatment. The deletion of thiazide from the regimen of prazosin plus thiazide resulted in a small stepwise decrease in plasma triglyceride concentration over 12 months of observation. The addition of polythiazide (0.5 mg two to three times weekly) to the regimen of patients in whom acceptable blood pressure was not attained with prazosin or atenolol monotherapy resulted in a decrease in blood pressure, averaging 18.8 mm Hg for systolic and 10.3 mm Hg for diastolic, and a small, though significant, increase in the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. It is suggested that the effects of prazosin on plasma lipid composition may be mediated, at least in part, by blocking an action of either the sympathetic nervous system or circulating catecholamines that normally modulate lipoprotein metabolism and might mediate the lipid alterations induced by thiazide diuretics.", 
    "55": "A prospective, crossover study was used to evaluate the effects of prazosin and propranolol on lipid metabolism in 10 hypertensive patients receiving long-term hemodialysis therapy. Adequate blood pressure control was achieved with either agent (mean predialysis blood pressure was 144/77 mm Hg). Total triglyceride levels increased by 27 +/- 4 percent during propranolol therapy but decreased during prazosin therapy by 8 +/- 2 percent (p less than 0.05). These changes were accounted for by a 21 +/- 1.5 percent increase in very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride during propranolol therapy and a 6 +/- 2 percent decrease in very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride during prazosin therapy (p less than 0.05). Although no change in total cholesterol occurred with either agent, a significant decrease (19 +/- 1 percent, p less than 0.01) in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol occurred with propranolol therapy and an increase of 16 +/- 4 percent occurred during treatment with prazosin (not significant). The high-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol levels decreased by 22 +/- 4 percent after treatment with propranolol and increased by 4 percent after prazosin therapy. Propranolol reduced high-density lipoprotein3 cholesterol levels by 18 +/- 2 percent, whereas prazosin increased these values by 19 +/- 2 percent (p less than 0.01). These changes were associated with a reduction in tissue lipoprotein lipase activity after propranolol therapy (2.4 +/- 0.3 percent) and an increase after prazosin therapy (2.5 +/- 1 percent, p less than 0.05). These data suggest that treatment with propranolol may be associated with unfavorable changes in the lipid profile that are not observed after treatment with prazosin.", 
    "56": "Twenty hypertensive men, aged 58 to 62 years, who had been treated with a combination of different drugs for many years, had their therapy changed in a stepwise manner to a combination of 50 mg of atenolol per day and 2 to 15 mg of prazosin per day. The effects of each change of treatment were assessed separately five to six months after the change. Serum lipids and high-density lipoprotein concentrations were determined, and an intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed at the start of the study and after each change. In the group in which therapy was changed from a diuretic to prazosin, serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations decreased significantly by 11 and 42 percent, respectively, but in the group in which therapy was changed from hydralazine to prazosin, there were no alterations in serum lipids or lipoproteins. The changes in therapy had no overall effects on glucose or insulin parameters evaluated with an intravenous glucose tolerance test. However, prazosin was associated with an increase in the fasting blood glucose level and a decrease in the peak insulin value after glucose injection, both of which were dose-related effects. The data indicate that the glucose turnover was at least as good after a switch from diuretic to prazosin treatment as before at lower insulin values. In those patients in whom therapy was switched from propranolol to 50 mg of atenolol per day, the serum triglyceride concentration decreased by about 10 percent, whereas in the group in which therapy was changed from 100 to 50 mg of atenolol per day, there were no serum lipid or lipoprotein alterations. The results show that a combination of 50 mg of atenolol per day and prazosin has metabolic advantages over combined diuretic and propranolol treatment. Such advantages may be of importance in the long-term treatment of hypertensive patients.", 
    "57": "To compare the effects of prazosin and atenolol on plasma lipid concentrations, 60 patients with arterial hypertension (diastolic 90 to 120 mm Hg, systolic 160 to 200 mm Hg) were allocated at random to one of two treatment groups. The lipid profile included the determination of total cholesterol and triglyceride levels by ultracentrifugation, and assays of apoproteins A1 and B by laser immunonephelometry. Determinations were performed 30 days before and on the first, 90th, and 180th days of treatment. Both drugs had similar reducing effects on blood pressure. A significant decrease in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apoprotein B, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 were observed in patients receiving prazosin, whereas patients receiving atenolol exhibited opposite changes in plasma lipids. Although the clinical significance of these findings is uncertain, such metabolic effects should be taken into account when evaluating the risk/benefit ratio of antihypertensive treatments.", 
    "58": "Prazosin and propranolol were compared in an open, crossover study to determine their effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. After a four-week placebo period, 10 hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to prazosin treatment (Group I) and another 10 to propranolol treatment (Group II) for eight weeks. After a second four-week placebo period, treatment in each group was switched to the alternative drug for eight weeks. The mean blood pressure was reduced to normal levels (diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) by both drugs--prazosin (1 to 8 mg per day) and propranolol (40 to 240 mg per day). The results of the study indicate that prazosin decreases serum cholesterol levels. In contrast, propranolol not only increases serum triglyceride levels and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but decreases total high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein2, and apoprotein A-I. The data suggest that propranolol may induce significant, potentially atherogenic changes in lipid metabolism, whereas prazosin may represent an advantageous alternative as an antihypertensive agent, especially in subjects with an already atherogenic lipoprotein profile.", 
    "59": "It is generally acknowledged that hypertension is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and that lowering elevated blood pressure is effective in reducing that risk. However, hypertension is more likely to cause cardiovascular disease in those with additional risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypokalemia, loft ventricular hypertrophy, or electrocardiographic abnormalities. The evidence to date indicates that not all patients with mild hypertension need to be treated with drugs; not all of those receiving drug therapy should be treated with the same drugs; and the benefit of the same degree of reduction in blood pressure may not be equivalent for different drugs. The use of traditional step 1 diuretic therapy is not uniformly appropriate. As an alternative, the vasodilator prazosin can be effective as monotherapy in the treatment of mild hypertension, and its addition to diuretic or beta blocker therapy appears to blunt or prevent the adverse effects of those agents on lipid levels. Since prazosin therapy is least likely to worsen existing risk factors or precipitate their occurrence, it should enhance the benefit of blood pressure reduction in delaying or preventing cardiovascular disease.", 
    "60": "The Oslo Hypertension Study began in 1972; patients were followed for an average of 66 months (range: 60 to 78). A total of 785 healthy men, aged 40 to 49, with mild hypertension was randomly assigned to either a drug-treated group or to an untreated control group. Hydrochlorothiazide was used alone in 36 percent of patients, in combination with propranolol in 26 percent, and with methyldopa in 20 percent. Other drugs, including combinations with hydrochlorothiazide, were used in 18 percent. A total of 95 percent of patients in the drug-treated group received hydrochlorothiazide. Complications of hypertension such as stroke and aneurysm occurred only in the control group. Coronary events were more numerous in the drug-treated group; thus, the total incidence of cardiovascular complications did not significantly differ between the treated and untreated groups. After five and 10 years, total mortality was the same in both groups. However, the coronary heart disease mortality rate at 10 years was significantly greater in the drug-treated group than in the untreated control group (14 versus three, p less than 0.01). This article presents possible reasons for the failure of antihypertensive drug therapy to prevent coronary heart disease. The adverse effect of diuretics and beta-adrenergic blockers, both on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, is contrasted with the effect of the alpha-adrenergic blocker prazosin, which has been shown to have no adverse effect on the blood lipid profile. In a short-term trial that was part of the Oslo Study, prazosin was found to reduce total serum cholesterol by 9 percent, low-density lipoprotein and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 10 percent, and total triglycerides by 16 percent. All these changes are statistically significant.", 
    "61": "The role of lipoprotein lipase in the pathophysiology of lipid changes during alpha-receptor or beta-receptor blockade was evaluated in this clinical trial. Thirty hypertensive patients were given 2 mg of prazosin twice daily or 100 mg of metoprolol twice daily for 10 weeks, according to an open, randomized protocol. Both drugs were effective in reducing arterial blood pressure (from 153 +/- 16/102 +/- 6 mm Hg to 146 +/- 12/92 +/- 8 mm Hg with prazosin and from 158 +/- 17/103 +/- 8 to 144 +/- 14/94 +/- 10 mm Hg with metoprolol). Prazosin significantly reduced total plasma cholesterol from 202 +/- 39 to 188 +/- 36 mg/dl and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol from 36 +/- 8 to 40.5 +/- 11 mg/dl. Prazosin did not affect plasma triglycerides levels, whereas patients taking metoprolol had a slight rise in these levels, from 122 +/- 42 to 142 +/- 57 mg/dl, along with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol from 37 +/- 10 to 31 +/- 8 mg/dl. The concentration of apoprotein B did not change significantly with either treatment. Lipoprotein lipase activity increased in the prazosin group from 28.4 +/- 16 to 37.7 +/- 14 mumol/liter per minute (p less than 0.01), but did not change significantly (29.9 +/- 12 versus 32.8 +/- 8 mumol/liter per minute) in patients treated with the beta blocker. These data, which confirm previous reports of serum lipid changes during antihypertensive therapy, suggest that alpha1 blockers may interfere with lipoprotein lipase, possibly by reducing its catecholamine-mediated inactivation.", 
    "62": "In a double-blind, comparative study metoprolol (100 to 300 mg/day) or pindolol (5 to 15 mg/day) was given in randomized order to 39 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Peripheral hemodynamics were studied by noninvasive means after an initial 6-week placebo period and again after 6 weeks and 6 months of active treatment. Three patients withdrew from the trial during the 6-week period of active treatment. Heart rate during exercise on an ergometric bicycle to a predetermined workload indicated that the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade was identical during treatment with either metoprolol or pindolol. Both agents also reduced resting blood pressure to the same extent. Heart rate at rest fell considerably more during metoprolol than pindolol therapy, while vascular resistance was reduced by pindolol but not by metoprolol. This indicates that the antihypertensive effect of metoprolol can be ascribed mainly to cardiac mechanisms; in contrast, pindolol appears to lower blood pressure primarily through vascular effects. Studies at maximal dilatation showed that pindolol, but not metoprolol, reduced resistance at maximal dilatation after 6 months of treatment, indicating that a reversal of the structural vascular changes had occurred. The hemodynamic differences between the 2 agents can probably be explained by the fact that pindolol with its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity acts as a partial agonist causing active stimulation of vascular beta 2 adrenoceptors and relaxation of resistance vessels.", 
    "63": "The effect of the combined administration of pindolol (10 or 20 mg daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg daily) on the serum lipid and lipoprotein levels of 34 hypertensive patients was investigated for 6 to 18.5 months (mean 13.3). Placebo control data were compared with the results obtained during treatment periods in each patient by paired t tests. Mean levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 17% (p less than 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 4% (p less than 0.01) and the high-density lipoprotein: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio increased by 28% (p less than 0.01). Total serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol showed no statistically significant changes from control values. These findings suggest that the long-term administration of this beta blocker combined with a diuretic results in serum lipid changes considered beneficial in the evaluation of risk factors for coronary artery disease.", 
    "64": "Investigation of preventive measures for hypertension and atherosclerosis is a geriatric medicine priority. While the causes of both isolated systolic hypertension and conventional systolic and diastolic hypertension in the elderly are well defined, the benefits of lowering blood pressure are not. Evidence to support the treatment of symptomatic hypertension is convincing for men 60 years of age; it is not for women in this age group. The need to treat hypertension, particularly isolated systolic hypertension in patients above 75 years old, is still not resolved. Isolated systolic hypertension in older patients is at least as strong a risk factor for cardiovascular disease as is diastolic hypertension. Ongoing trials may answer these questions; in the meantime, drug therapy in this group will vary widely. The elderly hypertensive is more likely than the younger hypertensive to have other diseases; diagnosis of these disorders is crucial. Hypertension arising de novo late in life warrants a search for underlying and possibly remedial causes. Antihypertensive drug therapy to relieve symptoms is difficult to justify, because most elderly hypertensive patients are asymptomatic; however, it has been shown to delay morbid and fatal complications of hypertension. Appropriate therapy for the elderly hypertensive must be individualized and should be associated with few or no side effects. The thiazides are the preferred diuretics for long-term treatment of hypertension in the elderly. Beta blockers are attractive because they are cardioprotective, counter the end organ effect of catecholamines and reduce angina; however, some decrease cardiac output, increase peripheral resistance, decrease renal blood flow and cause fatigue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "The effects of single and repeated administrations of the beta-agonist, clenbuterol (0.5 mg/kg i.p., twice daily for 4 or 7 days) were measured in the open-field test as responsiveness of rats to beta- (clenbuterol), alpha 2-(clonidine) and alpha 1-(phenylephrine) adrenergic stimulation. Furthermore, the effects of such treatment on beta- and beta 1-adrenoceptor binding in the rat brain cortex were studied. Repeated administration of clenbuterol failed to change the exploratory activity, in contrast to the acute sedative effect. Repeated treatment with clenbuterol resulted in a decrease in [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to cortical beta-adrenoceptors. A single dose of clenbuterol reduced the clonidine-induced sedation and repeated treatment of clenbuterol abolished this sedation. Clenbuterol did not affect the action of phenylephrine nor did it change the binding of [3H]prazosin. These results indicate that repeated administration of a beta-agonist produces a rapid appearance of beta- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor subsensitivity, which it not followed by alpha 1-adrenoceptor changes.", 
    "66": "The effect of celiprolol at a daily dosage of 300 mg (19 patients) was compared with that of propranolol at a daily dosage of 120 mg (14 patients) on peripheral blood flow of the calf and foot in a randomized double-blind trial. Altogether 33 patients (47 extremities) suffering from arterial occlusive disease (stage II according to Fontaine) and hypertension, were treated for 25 days. Blood flow was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. Celiprolol led to a small, insignificant increase in resting blood flow of the muscle. Propranolol produced a small decrease in resting blood flow of the muscle, and a significant fall in resting blood flow of the skin of the foot. At the completion of treatment with celiprolol there was a small increase in the initial value of reactive hyperaemia of the calf. Propranolol led to a decrease in the initial, and in the maximum values of reactive hyperaemia of the calf and foot. Celiprolol and propranolol led to a comparable decrease in resting blood pressure.", 
    "67": "We compared the effects of weight reduction, metoprolol, and placebo on M-mode echocardiographic measurements of the thickness and mass of the left ventricular wall in a 21-week, randomized controlled trial that enrolled 41 young, overweight patients with hypertension. At the end of the follow-up period, the patients in the weight-reduction group had lost an average of 8.3 kg, and their blood pressure had decreased by an average of 14/13 mm Hg, as compared with 12/8 mm Hg in the metoprolol group and 9/4 mm Hg in the placebo group. In the weight-reduction group, interventricular septal and posterior-wall thickness decreased by 14 percent and 11 percent, respectively, and left ventricular mass decreased by 20 percent (16 percent when adjusted for body-surface area). Decreases in interventricular septal and posterior-wall thickness and in left ventricular mass in the weight-reduction group were significantly greater than those in the placebo group. The changes in thickness of the interventricular septum and the left ventricular mass in the weight-reduction group were also greater than those in the metoprolol group. Changes in weight, independent of changes in blood pressure, were directly associated with changes in left ventricular mass. We conclude that weight reduction decreases left ventricular mass in overweight hypertensive patients and that control of obesity is important not only for the treatment of hypertension but also for the prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "68": "The relaxing effect of dopamine on the rat isolated jejunum has been studied. Dopamine was found 170 times less potent than noradrenaline and 3 times more potent than tyramine. The relaxing effect of dopamine does not show the tachyphylaxis phenomenon, is present in preparations from rats pretreated with reserpine and is not influenced by cocaine. These results indicate that dopamine has a direct action. To characterize the receptor(s) through which dopamine causes intestinal relaxation the alpha-blocker phentolamine, the beta-blocker propranolol and the dopamine receptor blockers haloperidol and cis-alpha-flupenthixol, alone or in combination have been tested. 40% of inhibition of the response to dopamine was obtained with phentolamine, 25% with propranolol and 30% with haloperidol or cis-alpha-flupenthixol. Combining together three antagonists acting on three different receptors it was possible to obtain 70% of inhibition of the responses to dopamine. It is concluded that alpha and beta adrenoceptors and specific dopamine receptors are involved in the direct relaxing action of dopamine.", 
    "69": "Responses to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, 1-isoprenaline, and to transmural (electrical) stimulation of the guinea-pig tracheal muscle were evaluated at basal and high levels of carbachol or potassium-induced (K+) tone. The sensitivity of guinea-pig tracheal preparations to 1-isoprenaline was reduced by approximately 7-fold when high level tone was induced by carbachol or K+. Propranolol also shifted the dose-response curves to the right, but was apparently more potent in preparations with basal tone than in tissues where high tone was induced by carbachol or K+. Transmural (electrical) stimulation of tracheal strips produced an initial contraction followed by a longer lasting relaxation. At high level of tone produced by carbachol or K+, the contractile component was almost abolished while the relaxant response was unaltered. Relaxation induced by transmural stimulation was decreased to similar extents by propranolol at both basal and high tone levels. These results suggest that the potency of 1-isoprenaline and propranolol is affected by tonic conditions of tracheal muscle but the proportion of noradrenergic to non-noradrenergic components in the relaxation induced by neural stimulation may be unaltered at basal and elevated tone levels.", 
    "70": "Propranolol has been shown to exert a protective effect in experimental myocardial, renal, and early acute focal cerebral ischemia. However, propranolol was not found to reduce infarct size in nitrous oxide-anesthetized, paralyzed, mechanically ventilated cats subjected to 6 hours of acute focal ischemia. The objective of the current investigation was to study further the effects of racemic (d,l)-propranolol on the evolution of acute focal cerebral ischemia in awake, conscious cats. Adult cats were anesthetized with halothane and underwent the implantation of an occluding device around the right middle cerebral artery. After a 48-hour recovery period, the right middle cerebral artery was occluded for 6 hours and then reopened, allowing reperfusion for an additional 6 hours. Neurological examinations were conducted every 2 hours throughout each experiment. Ten cats received d,l-propranolol (2 mg/kg) 1 hour before occlusion, immediately before occlusion, and every 2 hours throughout each experiment. Eleven cats serving as controls were not treated. The neurological examination significantly improved over time in the treated group when compared to the untreated group (P = 0.01). Carbon filling defects, gross brain swelling, and infarct size were reduced in treated cats. The results of this study suggest that propranolol does have beneficial effects in acute focal cerebral ischemia.", 
    "71": "The inhibitory action of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on gastric function was studied in vagotomized rats. 5-HT (0.6, 1 or 5 mgkg-1, s.c.) dose-dependently reduced gastric acid secretion evoked by histamine, pentagastrin or methacholine. Pepsin secretion induced by pentagastrin or methacholine was also depressed by 5-HT. Basal secretion of both acid and pepsin was not significantly affected by any of the three 5-HT doses. Indomethacin pretreatment, which significantly decreased gastric mucosal prostaglandin E2 content, did not modify the inhibitory effects of 5-HT on histamine-induced acid secretion, nor did phentolamine or propranolol. This study suggests that 5-HT inhibits gastric secretory function through mechanisms other than by sympathetic influence or increased prostaglandin synthesis. The inhibitory action appears not to be vagus-dependent. Other mechanisms of action are discussed.", 
    "72": "The effect of propranolol on baroreflex control of heart rate was studied in 12 young patients with essential hypertension and was compared with that of 12 age-matched normotensive subjects. Resting heart rate and cardiac index in patients with essential hypertension were significantly higher than those of control subjects (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.01, respectively). The reduction of heart rate and cardiac index after propranolol were significantly greater in patients with essential hypertension than in control subjects (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05, respectively). In the control state, the baroreflex slope in young patients with essential hypertension was significantly less than that of control subjects (p less than 0.01). After propranolol, the baroreflex slope was significantly increased in control subjects (p less than 0.01), but remained unchanged in patients with essential hypertension. These results suggest, first that the antihypertensive action of propranolol must be due to a mechanism other than the augmented baroreflex function and, second that increased beta-adrenergic activity is not a factor contributing to impaired baroreflex function in young patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "73": "Infusion of norepinephrine (NE) into the third ventricle of ovariectomized (OVX) adult rats inhibits pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. This study examines the effects of pretreatment with specific alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers on the subsequent NE-induced suppression of LH release. Unanesthetized long-term OVX rats were injected ip or iv with phenoxybenzamine (alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker), propranolol (beta-adrenergic blocker), or an equal volume of saline (as controls). Approximately 1-1.5 h later, the animals were given an intraventricular (ivt) administration of NE. Infusion of acidified saline into the third ventricle of OVX rats failed to affect the pulsatile pattern of LH release characteristic of these animals. After ivt of NE, the control rats showed a significant decrease in mean blood LH level of ca. 30%. Pretreatment of OVX rat with propranolol either ivt or ip failed to affect pulsatile LH release. Subsequent ivt infusion of NE either at 1 h or 15 min after propranolol treatment also caused a 28-30% decrease in the mean LH levels and suppressed pulsatile discharge of LH, an effect that lasted for approximately 45-50 min. In sharp contrast to the saline and propranolol-treated groups, rats pretreated with phenoxybenzamine had sporadic or no LH pulses during the 70-min postphenoxybenzamine period and had significantly lower mean LH levels when compared with control animals (P less than 0.05). Moreover, a drop in mean blood LH levels after NE infusion was not observed in the rats pretreated with phenoxybenzamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "75": "The experiments on rats with a 3-day myocardial infarction caused by the left coronary artery ligation have shown that multiple lidocaine and pyromecaine injections according to a given scheme decrease the size of the necrosis area. Drug effects were not related to their action on the blood supply of the ischemic area.", 
    "76": "We studied cardiovascular effects related to ophthalmic timolol maleate, a beta-adrenergic blocker commonly used to treat chronic glaucoma. Twenty normal subjects were randomly assigned to two double-blind treatment groups each with ten subjects. One group received two drops of ophthalmic timolol (0.5%) twice daily for 4 weeks, and the other received two drops of placebo (artificial tears) twice daily for 4 weeks. Ophthalmic timolol significantly decreased resting and maximal exercise heart rate after the first dose and maximal exercise heart rate during chronic dosing. Chronic timolol administration reduced oxygen consumption at maximal exercise and blunted the augmentation in exercise capacity seen during chronic placebo therapy. Cardiac sympathetic tone and inotropy were reduced after ophthalmic timolol treatment. Despite the presence of drug-induced cardiovascular effects, the plasma levels of timolol were often undetectable and never exceeded 2.8 ng/mL.", 
    "77": "The propensity of systemic beta-adrenergic blockers to cause bronchoconstriction in patients with reactive airway disease is well recognized. A study was carried out to determine the prevalence of sensitivity to ophthalmic timolol in 24 asthmatic subjects at our institution and to determine the effect of ophthalmic betaxolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker efficacious in the treatment of glaucoma, in 8 subjects who were timolol-sensitive. Subjects received topical timolol 0.5%; ventilatory function, blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored over a 90-min period. The mean FEV1 fell from 2.47 to 1.93 L by 30 min after drug treatment to a minimal value of 1.86 L (-27.8%). There was a corresponding fall in FVC from 3.68 to 3.09 L by 30 min with a minimal value of 3.00 L(-20.7%). FEV1/FVC ratio also fell from 66.9 to 61.0% by 30 min, reaching a minimum of 60.0%. In 14 subjects (58.3%), the fall in FEV1 was greater than or equal to 20%, with a mean fall of 38.7% by 30 min and a maximal fall of 44.9%. The severity of timolol-sensitivity correlated with the extent of reduction in baseline percent predicted FEV1 and FVC and with exercise-induced bronchospasm. In addition, the administration of timolol reduced the bronchodilator response to below the pretimolol value. In 8 of the timolol-sensitive patients who underwent a double-blind crossover challenge with ocular instillation of betaxolol 1% and saline, betaxolol was well-tolerated and did not affect ventilatory function over a 4-h observation period. In addition, it did not prevent the FEV1 response to inhaled bronchodilator.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "Transverse (3rd-order) arterioles (diam 12 +/- 2 micron, n = 6) in rat spinotrapezius muscle were observed with video microscopy during electrical stimulation of preoptic recess in periventricular region of hypothalamus (AV3V region) to test whether active skeletal muscle vasodilation was mediated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism. Bipolar wire electrodes were implanted in AV3V 3-7 days before an experiment. Continuous superfusion of propranolol (10(-5) M) caused steady-state reduction (3 +/- 1 microns) in arteriolar diameter and reduced steady-state vasodilation (26 +/- 2 vs. 11 +/- 2 microns) caused by a continuous superfusion of isoproterenol (10(-6) M). Six arterioles were observed with and without propranolol during four frequencies of AV3V stimulation (8-15 V, 0.2-0.5 ms pulse duration; 10, 15, 20, and 25 Hz; 1 min stimulus duration). Stimulation caused frequency-related reductions in arterial blood pressure (10-20 mmHg), which were sustained and not altered by propranolol. Transient peak diameters were observed after 30 +/- 7 s; the time was not related to stimulus frequency or affected by propranolol. Peak diameters averaged 14-17 microns during vehicle and 11-12 micron during propranolol (maximum diam 32 +/- 3). Peak vasodilations were significant but identical with vehicle or propranolol (avg 3 +/- 1 microns) and not related to stimulus frequency. Diameters stabilized at steady-state values above base line only during 15 and 20 Hz with vehicle and only during 20 Hz with propranolol. We conclude that AV3V stimulation causes transient vasodilation in spinotrapezius muscle that is probably not mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "We studied peak isovolumic pressure-volume (PV) relation of the left ventricle in 3-mo-old mongrel puppies. A puppy heart was excised and cross circulated with an adult dog. Left ventricular pressure and volume were measured with a water-filled balloon. Peak isovolumic PV curve in control contractile state was convex upward, reaching a maximum pressure of 130 mmHg. Epinephrine (0.6 microgram/min intracoronary) shifted the curve leftward and up to a maximum pressure of 160 mmHg. Propranolol (0.8 mg intracoronary) shifted it rightward and down to a maximum pressure of 110 mmHg. These PV curves were reasonably fitted by an asymptotic equation: P = A (1 - exp[-B (V - Vd)]), where V was normalized volume for 100 g left ventricle and Vd (6 ml/100 g) was V at which peak pressure was zero. A and B are regression coefficients. A was 149, 169, and 120 mmHg, and B was 0.16, 0.19, and 0.06 ml, respectively, in control, enhanced, and depressed contractile states. These changes in A and B were statistically significant. We conclude that the puppy left ventricular peak isovolumic PV curve is convex upward and shifts sensitively with inotropic changes.", 
    "80": "We studied the effect of intravenous (1 mg/kg) and oral (400 mg) acebutolol on atrioventricular conduction in 22 patients with idiopathic bundle branch block and 1 to 1 atrioventricular conduction. Seven patients had previously symptomatic complete heart block (Group 1) and 15 were asymptomatic with bundle branch block only (Group 2). Following intravenous acebutolol heart rate decreased 82 +/- 16 to 63 +/- 16/min (P less than 0.01), A-H interval lengthened 98 +/- 22 to 121 +/- 30 msec (P less than 0.005) and H-V time was prolonged 60 +/- 13 to 70 +/- 17 msec (P less than 0.02) in those with previous heart block. The corresponding changes in the patients with no previous block were 74 +/- 14 to 61 +/- 8/min (P less than 0.01), 90 +/- 17 to 109 +/- 22 msec (P less than 0.05) and 48 +/- 15 to 56 +/- 14 msec (P less than 0.01). There was no difference between the basal or induced changes between these two groups. After intravenous acebutolol infusion 2 of 6 patients with previous spontaneous heart block and none of those without previous heart block developed atrioventricular block distal to His. The induced block was temporary (less than 10 min) and corresponded to the time of peak plasma acebutolol levels. Temporary atrioventricular block followed oral acebutolol administration in 4/7 patients with previous spontaneous heart block and 0/14 in those without block. In patients with bundle branch block intravenous acebutolol prolonged H-V conduction times in 19/20 patients and intravenous and oral acebutolol induced A-V block in 4/7 patients with previous spontaneous block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
