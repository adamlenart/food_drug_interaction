In symmetrical K+ concentrations the current-voltage relation of this channel showed slight inward rectification. The K+ permeability coefficient was 1.05 x 10(-13) cm3/s ([K+]o = 140 mM; 20 degrees C) in the inside-out patch and somewhat smaller when measured under the same conditions in the outside-out configuration (0.86 x 10(-13) cm3/s). 3. When intracellular Rb+ replaced K+, inward K+ currents were unaffected but the outward currents carried by Rb+ were substantially smaller. The extent of the reduction in the outward currents depended on the internal Rb+/K+ ratio and increased as [Rb+]i was raised. Both inward and outward Rb+ currents were blocked by 1 mM-ATP. No currents were measurable in symmetrical 140 mM-Rb+ solutions. 4. With 140 mM [K+]o and 140 mM [Rb+]i the single-channel current-voltage relation reversed at +8 mV and the potential at which the variance of the ATP-sensitive current was least was shifted by 6 mV to more positive potentials. These data suggest a PRb/PK ratio of around 0.7. 5. Outward Rb+ currents were reduced at all potentials in inside-out patches exposed to 107 mM-Rb+ solution intracellularly and 5 mM-K+ externally. 6. Partial replacement of external K+ with Rb+ substantially reduced the inward currents recorded from outside-out patches and also decreased outward K+ currents. 7. In outside-out patches, the addition of 1 mM-Rb+ to the external solution produced a block of inward K+ currents that initially increased and then decreased again with hyperpolarization. This suggests that the Rb+ block of K+ currents is voltage dependent and that Rb+ acts as a permeant blocker of K+ currents. 8. The sodium permeability of the channel, relative to that of potassium, was 0.39 for internal Na+ and 0.007 for external Na+ ions. 9. We conclude that Rb+ serves as an acceptable tracer for K+ in efflux studies when changes in K+ flux through ATP-sensitive K+ channels are of interest but that the magnitude of such fluxes will be considerably underestimated.", 
    "1": "The effect of metoprolol on indices of infarct size and left ventricular function was compared with that of placebo in a double-blind randomized trial in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction. Intravenous metoprolol (15 mg) or placebo was given within 24 h of the onset of symptoms, and oral treatment (200 mg daily) was continued for 15 days. Thirty-five patients received metoprolol and 34 patients placebo. The mean (+/- SD) of maximal creatinine phosphokinase (CK)-MB activities was 142 +/- 110 IU/l in the placebo group and 74 +/- 72 IU/l in the metoprolol group (p less than 0.001). The ECG QRS score at discharge from hospital was 5.22 +/- 4.47 and 4.61 +/- 3.06 (NS), respectively. Global left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was 44 +/- 14 and 51 +/- 15% (p = 0.054), respectively, and no change occurred in either group from rest to peak exercise. Ventricular fibrillation occurred in 1 placebo patient during the first day in hospital and in 1 metoprolol patient on the 14th day. Holter monitoring revealed no significant difference in the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias during the first 24 h. Smaller enzyme release and higher ejection fraction suggest myocardial protection by early metoprolol treatment in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "2": "In 45 newly-weaned 3 to 4-week-old piglets, diarrhoea was induced by a combined infection with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) strains. In untreated control animals this dual inoculation resulted in profuse diarrhoea, vomiting, hypovolaemic shock and death of 77% of the animals within five days of TGE virus inoculation. Antisecretory drugs were administered intramuscularly for three consecutive days after experimental infection. The neurolepticum chlorpromazine, at 2 mg/kg/24 h, resulted in a significant inhibition of diarrhoea and vomiting, and in an increase in weight gain and survival. Sedation and hypothermia, however, were serious side-effects. The alpha 2 agonist clonidine, at 80 micrograms/kg/12 h, induced a significant antidiarrhoeal effect and a reduction in mortality. The drug, however, provoked decreased activity of alpha 2-adrenergic excitation and incoordination. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, at 0.33 mg/kg/8 h, and the calcium channel blocker verapamil, at 2 mg/kg/8 h, had no beneficial effect on the experimentally induced diarrhoea.", 
    "3": "Pigmented rabbits were treated with timolol maleate, betaxolol hydrochloride or levobunolol hydrochloride eye drops twice a day for six months. Animals of the same age group and breed were used as controls. There were no differences observed in corneal epithelium with light and transmission electron microscopy. With scanning electron microscopy, in the timolol and betaxolol treated animals the picture of the corneal surface was similar to that of normal rabbit corneas after exposure to air. In scanning electron micrographs of the levobunolol treated animals, the corneal surface resembled the corneas of normal rabbits treated with artificial tears.", 
    "4": "The response of two ophthalmic betablockers, Timolol (without ISA) and Pindolol (with marked ISA), on IOP and tonographic outflow facility was investigated in a single-blind clinical study on 20 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In two treatment groups, ten patients each, in a randomized order IOP and tonographic outflow facility measurements were performed before and 2 hrs after drug application. Timolol reduced IOP by 6.8 mm Hg and Pindolol eye drops by 4.5 mm Hg. Both topically applied betablockers did not influence tonographic facility of outflow. It is concluded that the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of an ophthalmic betablocker has no effect on outflow facility of aqueous humor.", 
    "5": "The present study was designed to compare the antihypertensive potencies of ketanserin and metoprolol in a double-blind trial and to study ketanserin long-term efficacy in a one-year open trial, plain or combined with metoprolol, according to diastolic blood pressure (DBP) normalization. Thirty-four patients were randomly assigned to two groups, one (n = 17) received ketanserin, 80 mg/day, and the other, (n = 17) metoprolol, 200 mg/day. After 3 mo. double blind treatment, all patients received plain ketanserin, or combined with metoprolol if ketanserin failed to normalize DBP. A significant effect was demonstrated after 3 mo. double blind treatment, for both drugs, in both standing and supine DBP (p less than 0.001). In the one-year follow-up, all patients received ketanserin and were divided in: I (n = 15) previously treated with the same drug; II (n = 2) plus metoprolol, in whom ketanserin had failed to decrease DBP; and III (n = 15) previously treated with metoprolol. In group I the blood pressure lowering effect of ketanserin remained constant during the one-year follow-up. In group II a trend in the decrease of parameters was observed. In group III, supine DBP diminished from 92.5 +/- 2 mmHg during treatment with metoprolol to 86.0 +/- 2 at 12 mo., after treatment with ketanserin (p less than 0.05). In groups I and III, 24/30 of patients normalized their DBP during one-year ketanserin open treatment. Ketanserin appears as a new alternative in the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "6": "The therapeutic efficacy of guanfacine was investigated in a group of 32 hypertensive patients. Guanfacine caused a marked decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance (by 19.8%, p less than 0.001) and, hence, in blood pressure (by 19.4%), p less than 0.001). A slight reduction in the heart rate (by 9.8%, p less than 0.01) was compensated by an increase in stroke volume (by 11.8%, p less than 0.05) so that cardiac output remained constant or was even slightly raised. After 4 weeks of treatment there was a regression of the left ventricular wall thickness and mass (by 7.43 +/- 2.44 g, p less than 0.05). Guanfacine monotherapy was effective in 75% of patients with moderate hypertension (using low doses 1-3 mg/day). In severe hypertensive disease a satisfactory therapeutic response was mostly achieved by a combination of Guanfacine (3-5 mg/day) with a beta-blocker, diuretic or vasodilator. Guanfacine is a promising agent in the long-term treatment of stable hypertension, particularly in patients, whom diuretics or beta-blockers are contraindicated.", 
    "7": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the relation between the urinary excretion of guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) and other substances in hypertensive patients (6 with borderline hypertension and 29 with hypertension) and 12 normal controls. In 10 of the hypertensive patients, GAA was measured before and after 4 weeks of treatment with calcium entry blocker. In hypertensive patients the rate of GAA urinary excretion was 43.5 +/- 17-4 micrograms/min, which was much lower than in the controls (77.2 +/- 35.9 micrograms/min) (p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference among these groups in creatinine clearance (CCr), serum creatinine (Cr), beta 2-microglobulin (BMG) or in the urinary excretion of BMG, N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) or radiosensitive microalbumin (mAlb). The urinary excretion rate of GAA was positively correlated with CCr (r = 0.62; p less than 0.01), and negatively correlated with mean blood pressure (r = -0.49; p less than 0.01). Finally, the GAA excretion was significantly correlated with urinary NAG (r = 0.24; p less than 0.05) and serum BMG (r = -0.31; p less than 0.05), but not with urinary mAlb (r = 0.12; p less than 0.05). Ten hypertensive patients followed for 4 weeks attained their ultimate mean blood pressure reduction after treatment (from 119.3 +/- 8.0 to 101.7 +/- 13.5 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), but the GAA/Cr ratio in the urinary excretion was significantly elevated (from 0.054 +/- 0.016 to 0.070 +/- 0.02; p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "The effect of treatment with the beta-blocker metoprolol on several indicants of task performance was investigated. Twenty-five male hypertensives were treated for 2 weeks each with drug and placebo in a double-blind crossover design. Comparisons to 25 matched untreated normotensives were made. Participants responded twice to a Mood Adjective Check List (MACL) and the Stroop Color-Word Test. In addition, they participated in two parallel decision-making simulations. Normotensives and hypertensives on drug or placebo did not differ on MACL and Stroop scores. Comparisons on 12 validated simulation measures showed that drug treatment with metoprolol aided complex task performance. Drug treatment improved strategic capacity and the ability to deal effectively with emergencies. Preliminary evidence that treatment with metoprolol might help restore performance capacity that may have been lost due to hypertensive disease was also obtained.", 
    "9": "Responses to dopamine were compared in helical strips of human gastroepiploic arteries (proximal portion) and their epiploic branches (distal portion), partially contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha. Dopamine produced a dose-related contraction in the proximal arteries, which was reversed to a relaxation by treatment with phentolamine. On the other hand, the distal arteries responded to low concentrations of dopamine with relaxations and to high concentrations with contractions. The relaxant response was selectively suppressed by treatment with droperidol and reversed to a contraction by SCH23390, but was not influenced by domperidone and propranolol. The amine-induced relaxation was not reduced by removal of the endothelium. The distal arteries, in which dopamine elicited a relaxation, responded to norepinephrine with dose-related contractions, which were suppressed by phentolamine but were not reversed to relaxations. It may be concluded that dopamine contracts human gastroepiploic arteries of the proximal portion, due to a predominant activation of alpha-adrenoceptors, and dilates the distal arteries by acting preferentially on dopaminergic DA1-receptors, possibly residing in smooth muscle. In the distal arteries, the ability of norepinephrine to activate alpha-adrenoceptors appears to be evidently higher than that of dopamine.", 
    "10": "The acute effects of propranolol and acebutolol on blood pressure, heart rate and hormonal changes during graded treadmill exercise were studied in patients with essential hypertension. Both of propranolol (2 mg i.v.) and acebutolol (10 mg i.v.) lowered the pre-exercise hemodynamic parameters and suppressed the elevation of systolic blood pressure, heart rate and pressure-rate product during exercise, but did not show any significant effect on diastolic blood pressure. Although these drugs increased plasma norepinephrine concentration (PNE) at rest and during moderate exercise, they failed to affect PNE at submaximal exercise. Plasma renin activity at rest and during exercise were more strongly suppressed by propranolol than acebutolol. Plasma aldosterone concentration was not affected by these drugs. Propranolol and acebutolol showed similar acute effects on blood pressure, heart rate and hormonal profiles at rest and during exercise within the doses used in this study. These results indicate that beta 1 adrenoceptor selectivity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may not play an important role in the acute antihypertensive effect at rest and during exercise and that both beta blockers have beneficial antihypertensive effects during exercise on patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "11": "The trend in blood plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, renin and parameters of central hemodynamics were studied in randomized sample of 67 patients with uncomplicated macrofocal myocardial infarction with a hyperkinetic syndrome. To 32 patients obsidan was administered intravenously (0.1 mg/kg), then orally for 2-3 days every 3-4 hours to lessen cardiac contraction rate by 20-30 per cent and to obtain moderate hypotension and after than 60-120 mg per 24 hours. The traditional treatment was prescribed to 35 patients of the control group. The acute period of the disease was marked by increased concentrations of catecholamines and renin and a close correlation between them and the central hemodynamic parameters. Use of obsidan led to a more rapid reduction and normalization of the content of biologically active substances, central hemodynamic parameters and to the removal of their correlation. The mechanisms of obsidan action are discussed.", 
    "12": "A study was conducted on a group of chronically hospitalized, brain-damaged male patients to assess the effectiveness of treatment with pindolol on behavioral problems. The study was conducted in two parts. The first was a double-blind, placebo-controlled analysis of the effect of pindolol on assaultive behavior, both verbal and physical. The second part was open and sought to determine whether pindolol would diminish such behaviors as resistance to care, sexual preoccupation, or provocation of others, which were sufficient to preclude placement at a lower level of care. These target behaviors and nursing interventions were monitored and clinical global assessments of improvement in behavior and of suitability for lower levels of care were developed. Eight of 13 patients were considered improved. Those with significant premorbid personality disorders showed little benefit. Pindolol appears to ameliorate some management problems and, by inference, improve the quality of life in many patients with behavioral pathology due to organic brain disease.", 
    "13": "251 untreated patients with mild to moderate hypertension were included in a multicenter study aimed 1) to detect arrhythmias (24-H Holter recording) and 2) to assess the efficacy of sotalol on blood pressure and possible arrhythmias. Patients with coronary heart disease or previously documented arrhythmias were excluded. Atrial arrhythmias such as premature beats, fibrillation, flutter and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia were detected in 16% of patients. Monomorphic ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) (Lown I and II) were detected in 41% of patients and polymorphic VPCs or duplets/triplets (Lown III and IV) in 14%. A correlation seems to exist between the level of hypertensive cardiopathy, judged on electrocardiographic data (Tarazi classification), age of patients and severity of arrhythmias. Sotalol was administered during 2 months at a mean dose of 160 mg per day. The treatment was effective on blood pressure and arrhythmias (82% improvement of severe VPCs) and the drug was well tolerated. It was difficult to conclude if these good results are due to the betablocking properties or specific class II antiarrhythmic effects of sotalol or to the combined activity.", 
    "14": "M-mode echocardiography was used in 80 patients with essential hypertension to study changes in the index of left ventricular mass during treatment over 3 years with reserpine, prazosin, indapamide and atenolol, separately or in combination. Forty patients completed a follow-up period of 36 months, while 5 patients died during this period. In all 5 groups, the index of left ventricular mass decreased significantly from the baseline after 1 and 3 years of treatment, except in those patients receiving prazosin in which there was no significant difference in the index of left ventricular mass between 1 and 3 years of treatment. Our results confirm that effective treatment of blood pressure results in a significant reduction in the index of left ventricular mass. Furthermore, this reduction was seen with all modes of treatment and suggests that it was reduction of blood pressure rather than any specific pharmacological property of the drugs that was of major importance.", 
    "15": "One-hundred and ninety-seven consecutive patients admitted for suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomized to double-blind treatment with intravenous followed by oral metoprolol or matching placebo within 24 hours (mean 6.9 hours) after onset of symptoms. A symptom-limited exercise test was performed 15 days after admission in 132 patients (70 patients receiving metoprolol; 62 placebo). Patients treated with metoprolol had a lower observed frequency of exercise-induced ST-segment elevation (11.4% vs. 22.6%; P less than 0.05) and less ventricular arrhythmias (7.1% vs. 19.4%; P less than 0.05) on the predischarge exercise test compared to placebo-treated patients; however, ST-segment depressions were equally distributed to the two treatment groups. Mean exercise capacity was the same in the two groups. Early administration of metoprolol to patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction reduces early exercise-induced parameters related to a bad prognosis and may therefore improve the long-term prognosis without reducing physical performance.", 
    "16": "Vivid visual hallucinations without other psychopathology have been reported for several hundred years. However, there is no consensus on whether these hallucinations should be considered a separate syndrome, the Charles Bonnet syndrome, or whether eye disease or brain disease is a necessary or exclusionary criterion for diagnosing this syndrome. In an attempt to resolve these issues, this article reviews the literature on isolated visual hallucinations and presents follow-up data from six cases. Criteria for diagnosing the Charles Bonnet syndrome are suggested.", 
    "17": "The effects of labetalol were compared with those of placebo in a multicentre randomized double-blind and prospective study of 152 patients with mild to moderate, non-proteinuric pregnancy-induced hypertension. Labetalol in a dose of 100 mg three times daily, increasing to 200 mg three times daily where required, significantly reduced maternal mean arterial pressure. There was some reduction in preterm delivery, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and jaundice in the labetalol-treated group. Intrauterine growth retardation and neonatal hypoglycaemia occurred with the same frequency in both groups. There were no perinatal deaths. Labetalol appears to be an effective agent in the management of mild to moderate pregnancy-induced hypertension. The data from this study suggest possible advantages and no apparent disadvantages for the fetus during its use.", 
    "18": "This randomized, single-blind, crossover study compared three formulations of propranolol, each given once daily for hypertension. After an initial titration phase, subjects randomly received regular-release, long-acting, or a generic propranolol formulation. Each drug was given for 4 weeks and each active treatment was separated by a washout phase to allow blood pressure to return to baseline. Twelve subjects received all three active treatments. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulses were significantly reduced from baseline by all formulations. There was no significant difference among drugs. Examination of diastolic blood pressures suggested some loss of antihypertensive control at the end of the dosing interval. These results indicate that it may be possible to administer propranolol once daily for hypertension and that there is no advantage for using the long-acting form.", 
    "19": "The authors compared the ocular hypotensive efficacy of two different treatment regimens of levobunolol 0.5% in a double-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Seventy-one patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension received levobunolol 0.5% as their sole glaucoma medication either on a once-daily or twice-daily treatment regimen for 3 months. Approximately 81% of the patients in the once-daily treatment group and 88% of subjects in the twice-daily treatment group successfully completed the 3-month study period. The overall mean decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) was 4.5 mmHg in the once-daily group and 5.6 mmHg in the twice-daily group. These differences were not statistically different. For both treatment groups, effects on mean heart rate and blood pressure were minimal. The authors' data from this population suggest that once-daily treatment with levobunolol is an effective glaucoma regimen.", 
    "20": "The authors compared the additive intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effects of two different topical medications, apraclonidine hydrochloride and dipivefrin hydrochloride, when used in conjunction with timolol maleate. Eighteen patients with elevated IOPs entered a randomized, double-masked, cross-over study. Each used apraclonidine 1.0%, dipivefrin 0.1%, or placebo, twice daily for 3 weeks each, in addition to timolol 0.5% twice daily. Only apraclonidine produced a significant additional IOP lowering over timolol treatment alone at all time intervals (P less than 0.001). Its additive effect was significantly greater than that seen with dipivefrin at all time intervals (P less than 0.01), with the exception of day 22 (P = 0.061). No significant change in pulse rate or blood pressure was seen during apraclonidine administration. Apraclonidine may be a useful adjunctive agent in patients with poorly controlled glaucoma.", 
    "21": "Effects of PEEP on cardiac function, myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial oxygen consumption (mVO2) were studied in eight mongrel dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. Myocardial oxygen demand was increased by isoproterenol infusion or atrial pacing, or decreased by beta-receptor blockade. PEEP was set to 15 cm H2O in all groups. The greatest reduction in cardiac output due to PEEP was seen during isoproterenol infusion (44%), and the smallest during beta-receptor blockade (18%). This is attributed to increased sensitivity to the reduced left ventricular (LV) preload induced by PEEP, when cardiac inotropy is augmented by isoproterenol, compared to normal and reduced cardiac inotropy. PEEP decreased MBF similarly and significantly in all groups. However, myocardial oxygen extraction did not increase, and reduction in MBF caused by PEEP was closely related to concomitant reduction in mVO2. A significant correlation was also observed between reductions in LV work and reduction in mVO2 when PEEP was applied in all groups. We conclude that the reduced MBF observed with use of PEEP was probably due to reduced myocardial oxygen demand.", 
    "22": "A method for the determination of (R)- and (S)-atenolol in human plasma and urine is described. The enantiomers of atenolol are extracted into dichloromethane containing 3% heptafluorobutanol followed by acetylation with acetic anhydride at 60 degrees C for 2 h. The acetylated enantiomers were separated on a chiral alpha 1-AGP column. Quantitation was performed using fluorescence detection. A phosphate buffer pH 7.1 (0.01 M phosphate) containing 0.25% (v/v) acetonitrile was used as mobile phase. The described procedure allows the detection of less than 6 ng of each enantiomer in 1 ml plasma. The relative standard deviation is 4.4% at 30 ng/ml of each enantiomer in plasma. The plasma concentration of (R)- and (S)-atenolol did not differ significantly in two subjects who received a single tablet of racemic atenolol. The R/S ratio of atenolol in urine was approximately 1.", 
    "23": "Only limited information is available on the stereochemistry of the in vivo distribution of beta-receptor-blocking drugs. In this study we determined the levels of the propranolol enantiomers in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and central nervous system (CNS), and peripheral tissues in the dog following an intravenous dose of a deuterium-labeled pseudoracemate. The appearance of the propranolol enantiomers in the CSF was rapid and nonstereoselective, with maximum concentrations reached at 15 min after dosing. The levels of the enantiomers in both CSF and plasma then declined in a parallel biphasic fashion, with a terminal t1/2 of about 125 min. Except for an early high CSF/plasma concentration ratio of 0.35, the CSF propranolol levels corresponded to the unbound concentration in plasma, CSF/plasma 0.20. All areas of the brain showed a similar uptake of propranolol, with a tissue concentration exceeding that in plasma about 10-fold during the terminal phase of elimination. The uptake of propranolol by peripheral tissues varied widely, ranging from a 50-fold accumulation by the lungs compared to plasma to no accumulation by adipose tissue. However, as for the CSF, there was no evidence of stereoselective uptake of propranolol by any CNS or peripheral tissue except for the liver. A significantly higher level of (+)-vs. (-)-propranolol in liver tissue presumably was a reflection of stereoselective hepatic metabolism of (-)-propranolol by this tissue. The slight stereoselectivity in plasma binding of propranolol known to exist in the dog had no significant influence on tissue or CSF distribution.", 
    "24": "The pharmacokinetics of (S)-propranolol were compared after the oral administration of a 40 mg dose of the pure enantiomer and an 80 mg dose of a racemic mixture of (R,S)-propranolol. The results of this study indicate that the bioavailability of (S)-propranolol, as expressed by the mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum serum concentration, is lower after 40 mg of the optically pure drug than after the racemic drug.", 
    "25": "1. To test the hypothesis that early pharmacological protection of the ischemic myocardium can enhance the effects of late reperfusion, 32 mongrel dogs were submitted to 6 h of left anterior descending coronary (LAD) occlusion and 18 h of reperfusion. 2. Arterial pressure and ECG were monitored. Area at risk was determined with methylene blue during coronary occlusion. Myocardial infarct size, measured with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and by planimetry, was reported as percent of the area at risk of necrosis. 3. Ten dogs received no treatment and were used as controls (Group I); Group II (9 dogs) and Group III (13 dogs) received 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg propranolol, iv, respectively, 30 min after LAD occlusion. 4. The hemodynamic effects of propranolol were not significantly different among groups during ischemia or reperfusion. Area at risk was similar in the 3 groups. 5. Following reperfusion, salvage of ischemic myocardium was 13 +/- 3% of area at risk in Group I, and 18 +/- 8% (Group II) and 25 +/- 5% (Group III) in propranolol-treated animals. The differences between Groups I and II or II and III were not significant. However, preservation was significantly greater in Group III than in Group I (P less than 0.05). 6. Therefore, early propranolol administration during ischemia improves the effects of subsequent reperfusion.", 
    "26": "A simple method for isolation of acebutolol from blood serum, and conditions of thin-layer chromatography for detection of this drug in blood are reported. An own colorimetric method has been developed for the determination of acebutolol after its isolation and hydrolysis in the medium of sulphuric acid. Results of the determinations were subjected to statistical analysis. The methods were elaborated using model samples prepared by addition of the acebutolol working standard to blood serum. Sensitivity of the acebutolol detection by thin-layer chromatography under elaborated conditions proved to reach the level of 0.5 microgram.", 
    "27": "Pulpal vessels are innervated with sympathetic adrenergic vasoconstrictor fibers. Electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerve causes pulpal arteriolar constriction and a reduction of arteriolar and venular flow rate (in mm3/s) in rat incisor pulps and a decrease in pulpal blood flow (in ml/min/100 g) in canine pulps of cats and dogs. The alpha-antagonist phenoxybenzamine and the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin attenuated the decrease in pulpal blood flow (PBF) caused by sympathetic stimulation. Reflex excitation of the sympathetic nerve system by hemorrhage caused pulpal vasoconstriction and a reduction of PBF. Induction of hemorrhagic hypotension in dogs subjected to cervical sympathectomy and adrenalectomy caused less pronounced pulpal vasoconstriction and flow reduction than in normal dogs. Pulpal vessels are also equipped with alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta-adrenergic receptors. Activation of alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors by intraarterial injection of phenylephrine and clonidine caused a reduction in PBF in dogs and decreases in arteriolar and venular diameters and volumetric flow in rats. These responses were blocked by the alpha-1 and alpha-2 antagonists. Activation of beta-2 receptors by i.a. injection of isoproterenol caused a paradoxical reduction of PBF in dogs. In rats isoproterenol caused a transient increase in the flow rate followed by a reduction, and arteriolar dilation was accompanied by venular constriction. These flow responses to isoproterenol were blocked by the beta-2 antagonist propranolol. Results of microcirculatory studies in dogs and rats indicate that pulpal hemodynamics are regulated significantly by the sympathetic adrenergic system.", 
    "28": "The effects of L-adrenaline and L-noradrenaline on human lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity were investigated in vitro. Both catecholamines are shown to be inhibitors of this enzyme. Despite inter-individual variations in the dose-response relationships calculated for both hormones, significant effects can be expected in the upper physiological range of concentration. Since diminished LCAT activity is known to be followed by a low level of HDL cholesterol and an increased concentration of triglycerides, it is supposed that catecholamine mediated inhibition of LCAT activity may contribute to the development of stress mediated fluctuations in plasma lipoprotein concentrations.", 
    "29": "Patients with essential hypertension were given calcium channel antagonist, Nifedipine Retard or Acebutolol for 26 weeks in a single blind, randomised trial. Both drugs reduced mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but side effects were less frequent and caused less drop-outs in Nifedipine than in Acebutolol group of patients. We conclude that both Nifedipine Retard and Acebutolol were equally effective in essential hypertension but side effects were considerably milder in patients treated with Nifedipine Retard.", 
    "30": "Current evidence indicates that the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol reduces the severity of experimental atherosclerosis in animal model. We studied the effect of propranolol on cholesterol ester synthesis and storage in mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Propranolol in concentrations found in the plasma of patients treated with it (150 ng/ml) decreased by 20-30% beta-VLDL-stimulated synthesis of cholesterol esters with (14C)-oleate. A similar effect was observed also on this synthesis stimulated by acetyl-LDL. In a similar degree the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in the cells was decreased during the 48-hour incubation with lipoproteins in the presence of propranolol. No effect of the drug was observed on the uptake and degradation of beta-VLDL or acetyl-LDL. These observations suggest that propranolol may inhibit cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages at the point subsequent to lipoprotein uptake. This may have an impact on the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis.", 
    "31": "In 59 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension effects of propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide on serum lipids, fibrynogen, glucose and uric acid concentrations as well as serum euglobulins fibrynolysis time were studied. 36 patients received propranolol and 23 subjects hydrochlorothiazide. Follow-up time was 1 year. Statistically significant increases of serum triglycerides, fibrynogen, levels and total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol LDH/HDL indices in comparison with their initial values were stated in a propranolol group. Significant serum cholesterol increase after 6 month therapy was the most substantial metabolic change in a hydrochlorothiazide group. Alterations of lipids indices in both groups were especially intensive in patients with pretreatment stated disturbances of lipids metabolism.", 
    "32": "For the first time in Bulgaria a case of hypokalemic periodic paralysis in thyrotoxicosis is described. Three periods of paralysis were observed and documented in a hospital. The thyrotoxicosis was well manifested with disturbed carbohydrate tolerance and responded favourably to methizole treatment. It is suggested that the mechanism for the development of the hypokalemic periodic paralysis is the intracellular blockade of potassium by the surplus of thyroid hormones.", 
    "33": "In 17 patients aged 21-61 (mean 32) with WPW syndrome the transoseophageal stimulation was performed before and after intravenous administration of propranolol (0.1 mg/kg b.w.) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg b.w.). Pharmacological blockade of the autonomic nervous system resulted in statistically significant increase of heart rate (from 81 to 111/min), shortening of a-v nodal and atrial refraction (from 298 to 272 ms) as well as in shortening of stimuli cycle length revealing Wenckebach's point (from 324 to 291 ms). The Kent bundle refraction did not at the average change (333 and 324 ms), while in individuals great differences were observed. Generally, pharmacological blockade of the autonomic nervous system improves a-v nodal conduction, but in patients with WPW syndrome does not significantly effect on the accessory pathway.", 
    "34": "32 patients in an early state of coronary sclerosis were investigated in connection with diagnostic angiography. 8 patients received 2 mg gallopamil (G) and for every 12 patients 0.1 mg/kg propranolol (P), respectively, 0.12 mg/kg Atenolol (A). All medications were injected intravenously over 4 min. The angiograms were repeated in identical projections before (control) as well as 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after G and 2, 4, 6...up to 20 min after P and A. All angiograms were analyzed using a quantitative computerized contour detection system. 10 min after infusion of G 34 measured coronary segments showed a significant (p less than 0.05) medium dilation of 21 +/- 4.3% and after a further 10 min an insignificant increase in coronary diameter was observed up to 25 +/- 4%. After infusion of P and A a distinct vasoconstriction could be seen. Especially P showed a decrease in diameter of almost 25% in small coronary segments (less than 2.0 mm diameter). The dilatative effect of G i.v. seems to be important in the therapy of acute ischemic situations, for instance, for unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, or during PTCA. The acute coronary vasoconstriction after infusion of P and A should be considered when used in acute ischemic events.", 
    "35": "The results of 35 consecutive trabeculectomies in eyes developing medically uncontrollable glaucoma following penetrating keratoplasty are presented, with a mean follow-up of 3 years from the time of drainage surgery. Five eyes remained phakic until trabeculectomy was performed. Additional medical therapy was necessary to control the intraocular pressure in 32 eyes, which therefore were considered to have failed to be controlled by trabeculectomy and 90% of these failed within 6 months of filtration surgery. Despite additional medical therapy, in 17 eyes, further drainage surgery was required and 90% of this surgery took place within the first 14 months. Adverse prognostic factors were multiple grafts and synechiae closure of the drainage angle.", 
    "36": "Scanning and transmission electron microscopy was used to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of three commercially available beta adrenergic blockers (Betoptic 0.5%, Betagan 0.5% and Timoptic 0.5%), and preservative (benzalkonium chloride 0.01%) on rabbit corneal endothelium. Evaluation was performed on groups including intact corneas, de-epithelialized corneas, full-thickness corneal grafts with intact epithelium, and de-epithelialized corneal grafts. Both Betoptic and Betagan produced minor damage to endothelial microvilli in the intact epithelial group. The de-epithelialized and the grafted-cornea groups had less damage induced by Betoptic than Betagan. Timoptic produced more endothelial damage than Betoptic and Betagan in all groups. Benzalkonium chloride produced minimal endothelial damage. Results indicate that Betoptic produces less endothelial toxicity than the two non-specific beta blockers when corneal epithelium is damaged and after penetrating keratoplasty.", 
    "37": "A simple technique for rapid determination of the flow of aqueous humor (AH) in rabbits is described. Data from control eyes and eyes treated with known inhibitors of aqueous humor production are presented as evidence of the suitability of the technique for comparing the influence of other drugs on aqueous flow. The flow measurement depends on marker dilution by fluid turnover during the first 30 min after 5 microliters marker solution is delivered to the anterior chamber. This is done by passing a needle through the sclera and behind the iris. The advantage of this route is that it permits withdrawal of the needle after delivery without leakage of marker or aqueous humor. Sulfacetamide (SAC), a sulfonamide with low lipid solubility and pKa 5.4, is the marker of flow used here. Control flow data from SAC, fluorescein (FL), reactive blue-2, and 14C-inulin as markers were compared. The control flow measured with SAC in two independent groups is 3.91 and 3.40 microliters/min or 3.69 +/- 0.37 S.E. overall. The data show that inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (CA) in ciliary processes by systemic methazolamide reduces flow 38%. Topical timolol reduces flow 35%. Pilocarpine, which is known to decrease IOP largely by increasing outflow facility, did not significantly reduce flow. This system for measuring AH flow allows rapid accumulation of data for topical, intracameral or systemic treatments.", 
    "38": "The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of IV labetalol were evaluated and compared with the efficacy and safety of IV hydralazine in the treatment of postoperative hypertension. Twenty patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery were entered into the study. Patients were randomized and treated for postoperative hypertension with either labetalol (n = 10) or hydralazine (n = 10). Labetalol and hydralazine both produced significant reductions in arterial blood pressure (p less than 0.001) within 10 minutes, which lasted at least 2 hours. In addition, labetalol produced a significant reduction in the heart rate and rate-pressure product without creating any adverse effects. In contrast, hydralazine produced significant sinus tachycardia requiring IV propranolol in three patients, two of whom developed transient ST segment depression. These results indicate that labetalol is safe and effective for the control of postoperative hypertension, especially in those patients who are least able to tolerate tachycardia.", 
    "39": "Endotracheal intubation following anesthesia induction frequently produces hypertension and tachycardia. This study evaluated the efficacy of preinduction IV labetalol for attenuating the hemodynamic responses to intubation following thiopental and succinylcholine induction of anesthesia. Two hours after diazepam (10 mg by mouth), 60 patients were randomized in a double-blind manner and received IV saline or labetalol at doses of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1 mg/kg in a parallel design study. Five minutes later, thiopental (4 mg/kg) and succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) were administered, and the trachea was intubated in 2 minutes. Nitrous oxide (70%) anesthesia was maintained for 10 minutes. Hemodynamic parameters were grouped and analyzed for significance (p less than 0.05) by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance and t-test with Bonferroni adjustments. Baseline group demographics and hemodynamics were comparable. All doses of labetalol significantly attenuated the rate-pressure product increase immediately postintubation versus placebo. There was a dose-dependent attenuation of the increases in heart rate and the systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures versus placebo following intubation. IV labetalol at doses up to 0.75 mg/kg offers an effective pharmacologic means of attenuating preoperative hemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation.", 
    "40": "The effect of antiaggressive agents on self-injurious behavior (SIB) was retrospectively assessed by studying the charts of mentally retarded individuals with both aggression and SIB who had been treated with either lithium (n = 11) or propranolol (n = 6). The frequency of these two behaviors was examined during the 3 months prior to starting medication and the first 3-month period at either a therapeutic blood level of lithium or at the individual patient's maximum dose of propranolol. The results support an equal reduction in both behaviors with either drug. This suggests that antiaggressive agents may be useful in SIB and raises the possibility that similar biochemical mechanisms may underlie both behaviors.", 
    "41": "In preparation for general anesthesia in older people (over 60) with hypertension we do not interrupt the treatment with Beta-receptor-blockers, on the day of operation and in postoperative treatment. We have had good results for years and we can recommend this method of treatment.", 
    "42": "Physiopharmacological properties of the pupillary dilation produced by the humoral factor in the reflex pupillary dilation were studied in cats anesthetized with ketamine-HC1. Pupillary dilation produced by the humoral factor was separated from that produced by the neural mechanism, ie, sympathetic activation and parasympathetic inhibition, by atropinization of acutely sympathectomized pupil. To evoke the pupillary reflex dilation, the sciatic nerve was stimulated by using a bipolar electrode. The stimulus consisted of trains of 0.5 milliseconds duration rectangular pulses and was given for 5 seconds. The stimulus frequency was usually 50 Hz; high frequency stimuli were more effective to evoke pupillary dilation produced by the humoral factor. The pupillary dilation was recorded with an infrared pupillo-analyzing system. A long latency (about 6 seconds) and long peak latency (about 10 seconds) pupillary dilation was produced by the humoral factor. The threshold of pupillary dilation produced by the humoral factor was always higher than that produced by parasympathetic inhibition. The pupillary dilation produced by the humoral factor was not affected by local application and intravitreal injection of 10(-2) M propranolol-HC1 and 10(-2) M yohimbine-HC1. However, the dilation was markedly inhibited by intravitreal injection of 10(-2) M phenoxybenzamine-HC1 or local application of 10(-2) M bunazosin-HC1.", 
    "43": "The paper presents a simple way to design and analyse studies on pharmacodynamic food-interaction and drug-interaction studies. The study design includes two distinct interventions--the drug or control against eating, or fasting, and allows an analysis of variance. It provides a model for a more analytical approach in the conduct and analysis of pharmacodynamic interaction studies and pharmacotherapeutic combination trials.", 
    "44": "Timolol is widely used in glaucoma treatment without sufficient knowledge of its vascular retinal effects. In this study, we measured the retinal vessel diameters before and after instillation of 0.5% timolol twice daily in one eye for 1 week, using photographic enlargements (x44). A total of 12 normal, caucasian subjects aged 25-39 years (average, 30.6 +/- 4.2 years) participated in this study. In all, 75% of the subjects had a diminution of retinal arterial size in the treated eye. The mean arterial diametric decrease was 4.1% in treated eyes compared with both untreated eyes and pretreatment values of treated eyes. These diminutions were statistically significant according to Student's paired t-test (P less than 0.05). No statistical difference was found in venous diameters (t = -0.065). Results showed that 0.5% timolol may have a vasoconstrictive effect on the retinal arteries of normal human subjects after 1 week of unilateral instillation twice daily. We suggest that this arterial vasoconstriction could be caused by the effect of timolol on the vascular beta-2 receptors. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether timolol also acts on ciliary arteries and whether arterial vasoconstriction participates in lowering intraocular pressure.", 
    "45": "Changes in intraventricular phase delays, phase angle histograms, amplitude images, and electrocardiograms (ECG) were investigated during oesophageal pacing with and without beta-blockade, after induced myocardial infarction, and during septic shock in the anaesthetized baboon model. Unavoidable triggering from the pacemaker spike and to a lesser extent increased heart rate were responsible for parameter changes during pacing. Myocardial infarction changed contraction patterns, which did not always correlate with conduction changes from the ECG's. Cardiac volume changes during septic shock could be responsible for the abnormal trends in phase angle spread and electrocardiographic data.", 
    "46": "Semipurified diets containing 0.5% cholesterol were used in a 9-month study with spontaneously hypertensive male rats to characterize the effects of the protein source (casein vs. soybean protein), and the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol on both lipid levels in blood plasma and the aorta, and on the morphology of intramural branches of coronary arteries. Raised blood lipid levels were observed in these rats. A significant decline in HDL2 cholesterol took place, while plasma cholesterol belonging to lipoprotein fractions of lower density increased. Metoprolol treatment led to a substantial elevation of the plasma triacylglycerol level and, with time, a reduced cholesterolemic response. The use of soybean protein instead of casein had a persistent plasma lipid-lowering effect. Arteriosclerotic changes in the form of musculo-elastic thickenings, intimal cushions and homogeneous hyalin deposits appeared in the intramural coronary arteries of rats in all groups after 9 months on the diet. However, intimal deposition of lipid was only present in rats belonging to the casein group not treated with metoprolol. Rats of this group also showed more severe myocardial lesions in the form of scar tissue with or without inflammatory cell reaction.", 
    "47": "Prebranchial blood pressure (Pva), heart rate (fH) and plasma catecholamine concentration were measured in the mudpuppy Necturus maculosus at rest and during exercise. During exercise, both fH and Pva increased, as did the plasma noradrenaline concentration. There was no significant effect on Pva after injection of the adrenergic neuron blocker, bretylium, in resting animals, neither did bretylium affect the exercise-induced increase in Pva. This suggests that there is no adrenergic nervous tone on the vasculature at rest or during exercise. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine had no effect on the resting Pva in the bretylium-treated animals, but it abolished the increase in Pva during exercise. This is compatible with the view of no influence on Pva by the plasma catecholamines at rest, while during exercise the increase in plasma noradrenaline concentration is responsible for the increase in Pva. Injection of atropine elevated resting fH, and reduced or abolished cardiac arrythmia, indicating an inhibitory cholinergic tone on the heart at rest, and that variations in this tone are responsible for the intrinsic variation seen in untreated animals. After the atropine treatment, there was still an increase in fH during exercise. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol decreased fH in resting atropinized animals, and inhibited the exercise-induced tachycardia, implying that there is an additional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated adrenergic tone, affecting the heart both at rest and during exercise. The cholinergic tone decreased during exercise with a concomitant increase in adrenergic tone. Falck-Hillarp fluorescent histochemistry was used to study the presence of adrenergic nerve fibres and other catecholamine-storing cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "To answer the question whether beta-adrenergic receptor agonists or antagonists and calcium channel blocking agents affect activation of neutrophils in vivo, the chemiluminescence (CL) test was employed. The intensity of emitted photons was amplified by luminol. The effect of investigated agents was measured after stimulation of isolated peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) with opsonized zymosan particles. The investigations were performed on 9 duodenal ulcer patients, aged 19-23 years, after informed consent. Single subcutaneous dose of epinephrine (0.014 mg/kg) induced a marked increase in PMNL number and a moderate, but significant, decrease in CL 30 min after injection. Verapamil (0.15 mg/kg intravenously) diminished CL, propranolol (0.1 mg/kg intravenously) enhanced CL, but 150 min after injections CL was approaching the initial values. The obtained results suggest that the investigated compounds may modify the PMNL function in vivo.", 
    "49": "The effect of (+/-)-sotalol (a beta-blocker with class III antiarrhythmic activity) against reperfusion-induced arrhythmias was studied in artificially ventilated, open-chest, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. Coronary artery occlusion was produced for 5 min and reperfusion allowed for 10 min. A somewhat different arrhythmic profile was observed between saline-treated rats of the 2 strains studied, with more Sprague-Dawley rats experiencing an irreversible ventricular fibrillation (VF) upon reperfusion, compared to Wistar rats, in whom a combination of reversible ventricular tachycardia (VT) and VF was more frequently observed. No difference in action potential characteristics and ventricular effective refractory period determined in vitro, nor in myocardial noradrenaline content, was found between the 2 strains of rats. (+/-)-Sotalol (5 and 10 mg/kg, IV) showed marked beta-blocking activity and reduced the mean duration of VT-VF in both strains studied. It also produced similar increases in action potential duration and refractory period in vitro in these 2 strains. In a different series of experiments, the antiarrhythmic action of the racemic form was compared to that of (+)-sotalol using Wistar rats. (+)-Sotalol had much less beta-blocking activity, and was found to be similarly effective against reperfusion-induced VT-VF. It is concluded that the antiarrhythmic effect of sotalol against reperfusion-induced arrhythmias may not be related to beta-adrenergic blockade but probably to class III type activity. Despite differences in the profile of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias between Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats, both strains were sensitive to the antiarrhythmic action of (+/-)-sotalol.", 
    "50": "Genetically determined polymorphisms of N-acetylation and oxidative capacity have been studied using dapsone and metoprolol in 51 Japanese patients with spontaneous bladder cancer and 203 healthy control subjects. The results for N-acetylation pharmacogenetics were against the initial expectation that there would be a preponderance of slow acetylators in the cancer group, as 3 such patients (5.9%) were found as compared to 13 (6.4%) in the healthy group. There was no poor metabolizer (PM) of metoprolol in the cancer group, whereas in the healthy group one (0.5%) was a PM. There were no significant differences between the groups in the frequency of slow acetylator and poor oxidiser phenotypes, or in the frequency distribution profiles of acetylation (monoacetyldapsone/dapsone) and oxidative metabolic ratio (log metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol). The results indicate that neither N-acetylation nor the debrisoquine/sparteine-type oxidative phenotype and/or capacity represent a genetic predisposition to spontaneous bladder carcinogenesis in Japanese patients. In the normal Japanese population there is a great predominance of rapid acetylators and extensive oxidisers.", 
    "51": "Nine healthy adults were administered indocyanine green (ICG) 0.5 mg.kg-1 IV alone and after the administration of the following oral drugs: nifedipine 10 mg, propranolol 80 mg, propranolol 80 mg and nifedipine 10 mg, and propranolol 80 mg after nifedipine 10 mg every 8 h for 5 days. Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were also determined. Nifedipine increased ICG clearance by 14% and decreased t1/2 by 26%. Propranolol decreased ICG clearance by 21% and increased t1/2 42%. Nifedipine and propranolol given together increased ICG clearance 63% and decreased t1/2 by 19%. All changes were statistically significant. Propranolol given after multiple doses of nifedipine did not change ICG kinetic parameters. Propranolol Cmax, tmax, oral clearance, and t1/2 did not change after nifedipine therapy. However, partial propranolol AUC values between 0-0.33, 0-0.5, 0-1.0 and 0-1.5 h were significantly larger after single and multiple doses of nifedipine indicating higher propranolol concentrations during the absorption phase. Heart rate and MAP did not change after nifedipine treatment. Similar declines in heart rate and MAP occurred after propranolol alone and propranolol after single and multiple doses of nifedipine.", 
    "52": "Forty-two patients with essential hypertension, WHO I-II, and a diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg, were initially given 25 mg hydrochlorthiazide alone. After treatment for 3 months 10 mg pindolol was also given to 16 of them as the diastolic blood pressure had not been reduced to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. After 3 months treatment on hydrochlorthiazide alone there was a significant increase in serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, and a decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, and this pattern persisted after a further 3 months on the single drug regimen. In contrast, in those patients who received additional treatment with pindolol after the first 3 months, there was a significant decrease in the low density lipoprotein cholesterol and an increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol during the following 3 months. Thus, the addition of pindolol to hydrochlorthiazide therapy appeared to reverse the negative effects on the lipid profile induced by the diuretic alone.", 
    "53": "An oral controlled-release system (M-HBS) of metoprolol was developed based on the hydrodynamically balanced controlled drug delivery system. It was found that the in vitro release characteristics showed basically first-order kinetics (K'r = 0.1651 h-1); a tentative two-year expiration date on M-HBS was established; the gamma-scintiphotographic study after oral ingestion showed that M-HBS was retained in human stomach for longer time (5-6 h) than the conventional metoprolol tablet (1-1.5 h). The blood concentration-time course of M-HBS was demonstrated to fit a one-compartment model with apparent first order absorption and first order elimination. The parameters were calculated using a NONLIN computer program with the values of Ka, K, Vd, tmax, cmax, being 0.1944 h-1, 0.1867 h-1, 2.813, 5.247 h, 125.1 ng/ml, respectively. Moreover, the fraction of the dose absorbed from M-HBS in vivo well correlated with dissolution rate in vitro.", 
    "54": "Experiments were carried out in albino rats to find out the effect of propranolol, priscol and atropine on post-hemorrhagic erythropoiesis. Administration of either propranolol or priscol decreased reticulocyte response following hemorrhage, whereas administration of atropine produced no change. The results indicate that alpha as well as beta adrenergic systems participate in the control of erythropoiesis following hemorrhage, whereas parasympathetic system does not take part.", 
    "55": "1. Baclofen given intraperitoneally (i.p.) to rats caused a dose-dependent decrease in food intake. 2. Bicuculline or picrotoxin (GABAA-antagonist) and methergoline (5-HT antagonist) decreased the anorectic effect of baclofen. 3. Pimozide (dopamine receptor blocker), phenoxybenzamine and propranolol (alpha and beta adrenergic blockers) did not diminish the baclofen effect, but even increased the anorexia induced by the drug. 4. It can be postulated that, at least partially, GABAA receptor mechanism, GABA-5HT receptor complex and/or 5-HT mechanism may be involved in baclofen induced anorexia.", 
    "56": "1. Low concentrations of petaline chloride (1-300 micrograms/ml) caused relaxation of the epinephrine-contracted aorta, contraction of the ileum, and no effect on the trachea. 2. Larger concentrations (up to 3 mg/ml) caused nonsustained large contractions of the aorta and the trachea and increased the amplitude of the phasic contractions of the ileum. 3. The above effects were not inhibited in the presence of atropine. 4. Petaline chloride increased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the contractions of the spontaneously-beating atrium and the isolated perfused heart. 5. The effects of petaline chloride on the atrium and on the perfused heart were not affected by propranolol but were significantly reduced in the presence of quinacrine, suggesting the participation of arachidonic acid metabolism to this effect. 6. In anesthetized rats, petaline chloride (0.3-3 mg/100 g body weight; i.p.) increased both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increased the heart rate.", 
    "57": "In order to study the influence of labetalol on the peroperative oxygenation during deliberate hypotension, 50 patients undergoing middle ear microsurgery were randomly divided in two groups of 25 patients; one group receiving labetalol to induce hypotension, the other group receiving placebo in a double blind manner. In the group receiving labetalol the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) decreased significantly 5 minutes after the intravenous bolus injection. Within 30 minutes the PaO2 returned to the starting level. The arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) increased within 5 minutes and also returned to the initial level after 30 minutes. These changes were absent in the control group. It is concluded that, although labetalol produces a statistically significant change in PaO2 and PaCO2, this finding has only minor clinical implications and so labetalol remains a safe drug to be used for the induction of deliberate hypotension during middle ear microsurgery.", 
    "58": "The effect of beta 1 and beta 2 blockade on dopamine and dobutamine induced hypokalaemia was investigated in dogs. Arterial plasma potassium was continuously monitored using a potassium-sensitive electrode sited in the abdominal aorta. Dopamine and dobutamine were infused at 15 micrograms kg-1 min-1 into animals pre-treated with atenolol (0.5 mg kg-1) or ICI 118551 (0.5 mg kg-1) and the potassium changes compared to those seen in control animals. The inotrope infusions caused a small and transient rise in plasma potassium (p less than 0.05) followed by a more profound hypokalaemia (p less than 0.05) sustained for the duration of the infusion. The potassium falls in the control animals were similar to those in the beta 1 and beta 2 blockade groups. The results suggest that beta 2 receptor stimulation cannot alone be responsible for dopamine and dobutamine induced hypokalaemia and a multiple receptor activation is postulated.", 
    "59": "A study has been performed in thirteen patients with essential hypertension, WHO Class I-II, and a diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mmHg, on beta-blocker (metoprolol or atenolol) monotherapy, who were also given felodipine 10 mg b.d. for 28 days. The acute and steady state blood pressure response at rest and during exercise, and the pharmacokinetics of felodipine and metoprolol, were examined. Felodipine in combination with the beta-blocker reduced the systolic and diastolic blood pressures acutely and at steady-state. The duration of the effect was longer at steady-state. There was a significant correlation between the plasma concentration of felodipine and the change in blood pressure. The increase in systolic blood pressure during exercise was of the same magnitude before and after felodipine administration. No change in resting supine heart rate was found after the administration of felodipine. There was no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of felodipine during long-term treatment, except for the trough plasma concentration, which was increased at steady-state, even though cumulation of felodipine and its metabolite did not occur. There was a significant decrease in the maximal plasma concentration and AUC of metoprolol after 28 days of treatment with felodipine, but its elimination half-life was not changed. The adverse reactions reported during this study were those generally seen after dihydropyridines and, except for two patients who were withdrawn after the first study day, the effects were well tolerated.", 
    "60": "To investigate if the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of pindolol could modify its beta-blocking effects on the responses to an adrenaline infusion, 10 healthy volunteers were studied. At an interval of 1-4 weeks each subject received pindolol and atenolol in randomized order before the infusion of adrenaline 0.06 microgram.kg-1.min-1. Pindolol prevented hypokalaemia and significantly decreased the heart rate during the adrenaline infusion. These effects were not observed after atenolol. The diastolic blood pressure was slightly increased during the infusion of adrenaline after pindolol, whereas it remained unchanged after atenolol.", 
    "61": "Altogether 75 patients (males aged 31 to 67 years) with unstable angina pectoris were subjected to transcutaneous pacing to measure the coronary reserve level before and after administration of obsidan (propranolol) in a dose of 40 mg. The area and depth of ischemia were found to be noticeably decreased, which was appraised according to 35 precordial leads on the ECG regardless of the unchanged \"double product\". It is concluded that not only the reduction of the heart rate and afterload but also their effect on the functional factors of angina pectoris are implicated in the mechanism of the anti-ischemic action of the beta-blockers.", 
    "62": "The effect of abrupt propranolol withdrawal on exercise-induced changes in heart rate and blood pressure was studied in six normal volunteers. Response to exercise was measured on two occassions during propranolol treatment and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 days after the last dose of propranolol. Exercise-induced changes in heart rate were significantly lower than control during propranolol treatment (p less than 0.005). Following propranolol cessation, all subjects showed a biphasic pattern of hypersensitivity. Heart rate response was significantly greater than control 2, 3 and 7 days after the last propranolol dose (p less than 0.05) and not significantly different from control 1, 4 and 5 days after the last dose of propranolol. Exercise-induced changes in pulse pressure showed a biphasic pattern similar to the changes in heart rate.", 
    "63": "Adipose tissue lipolytic activity is increased in endurance-trained subjects, but little is known about the mechanisms of this increase. To understand more fully the mechanisms involved and to discover whether sex-related differences exist, biopsies of fat were performed in the periumbilical region of 20 sedentary subjects (10 women (W) and 10 men (M)) and 20 trained subjects (10 W, 10 M); the in vitro response to epinephrine of the collagenase-isolated fat cells was studied. Glycerol release, chosen as an adipocyte lipolysis indicator, was measured by bioluminescence. Dose-response curves with epinephrine (alpha 2 and beta agonist), with isoproterenol (beta agonist) and epinephrine + propranolol and adenosine deaminase, were studied. Epinephrine-induced lipolysis was enhanced in trained subjects and this was due to an increased efficiency of the beta-adrenergic pathway. However, differences were found between the two sexes. In trained men, the lipolysis increase resulted from the enhancement of the beta-adrenergic pathway efficiency without any significant decrease in the alpha 2-adrenergic pathway efficiency. In trained women, the lipolysis increase was not only due to the enhancement of the beta-adrenergic pathway efficiency (which was greater than in trained men), but also to a significant decrease in the alpha 2-adrenergic pathway efficiency. Despite the decrease, the alpha 2-adrenergic pathway remained more efficient in trained women than in trained men, as was the case in sedentary subjects. It is concluded that endurance training led to better lipid mobilization and that this effect seemed greater in women than in men.", 
    "64": "A HPLC method is described for the identification and quantification in plasma and urine of beta-blockers (betaxolol, carteolol, metipranolol, and timolol) topically used in the therapy of glaucoma. An extraction method is presented using pindolol as an internal standard. Separation is performed on an RSIL CN 10 microns column with a mobile phase of water/acetonitrile/pH 3.0 0.1 M NaH2PO4 buffer solution (60:30:10, v/v). The lower detection limits were found to be 4 to 27 ng/ml. This method is simple, rapid and sensitive; moreover, it allows the determination of 8 other beta-blockers.", 
    "65": "The effects on baseline ventilation as well as beta 2-receptor stimulant-induced bronchodilation and tremor of atenolol and dilevalol, a beta-blocking agent with non-selective beta-antagonistic properties and intrinsic activity on the beta 2-receptor were evaluated in 8 patients with stable asthma. Both atenolol and dilevalol were found to significantly decrease both forced expiratory volume during 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). This decrease was significantly more pronounced after atenolol. Both agents decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate to a similar degree. Increased activation of beta 2-adrenoceptors by terbutaline infusion resulted in increased FEV1 and FVC as well as beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated reflex tachycardia and skeletal muscle tremor. The dose response curves for all these parameters were significantly shifted to the right and a decrease of the maximum relative response was seen after atenolol pretreatment. This effect was more pronounced after treatment with dilevalol with a further shift to the right of the response curve and a decrease of the maximum relative response. The haemodynamic and ventilatory effects of dilevalol are consistent with a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade combined with intrinsic activity on the beta 2-receptors.", 
    "66": "This paper describes a general approach for the therapeutic drug monitoring of 13 different beta blockers in plasma. The chromatographic system contains a cyanopropyl-bonded phase as a stationary phase in combination with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (pH = 3, mu = 0.05). Two modes of detection are used, namely, UV detection and fluorescence detection. The sample pretreatment is performed with a nitrile-sorbent in combination with methanol-phosphate buffer (pH = 3, mu = 0.05) or with methanol containing 0.1% propylamine as eluent. Acceptable recoveries are obtained for practolol, acebutolol, pindolol, oxprenolol, mepindolol, atenolol, propranolol, prenalterol, alprenolol, metoprolol, sotalol and nadolol. For labetalol, however, the elution recovery has to be improved. Finally, this approach is illustrated by the assay of nadolol in the plasma of patients suffering from hypertension, who had received an oral formulation of the drug.", 
    "67": "A sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electro-chemical detection is developed for the determination of deacetylmetipranolol (DMP), an active metabolite of beta-sympatholytic drug metipranolol (MP). DMP is extracted from the plasma after basifying with dichloromethane. After evaporation, the residue is reconstituted in the mobile phase, injected onto the reversed-phase ODS column and chromatographed at 50 degrees C. The sensitivity of the method is 2 ng of DMP in 1 ml plasma. Pindolol, another beta-blocking agent is used as internal standard. The method is used for a pharmacokinetic investigation of MP in healthy volunteers and in the patients with liver cirrhosis.", 
    "68": "The oxidation of labetalol with sodium metaperiodate is described. In spite of the bulky substituent on the amino group of labetalol, glycol cleavage of the molecule occurred. Spectrometric methods verified that the aromatic aldehyde formed was 2-hydroxy-5-formylbenzamide and that the amine was 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine. The polarographic behaviour of the aldehyde was examined as well. The half-wave potential in Britton-Robinson buffer pH 5.68 was -1.24 V. Direct linearity (r = 0.9999) was observed between the diffusion current and the concentration of the aldehyde. Quantitation of labetalol was carried out polarographically by measuring the concentration of 2-hydroxy-5-formylbenzamide formed in the oxidation.", 
    "69": "Preliminary studies on the properties of a commercially available graphitized carbon black for the solid-phase (or liquid-solid) extraction of drugs and metabolites from biological fluids such as urine and plasma are described. A variety of basic drugs, all of the beta-blocker type, were efficiently extracted from dog plasma and subsequently recovered from the adsorbent using chloroform-methanol mixtures. Similarly metabolites of the non-steroidal anti-flammatory drug ibuprofen also were efficiently extracted from human urine. The proportions of methanol and chloroform used for elution were found to be critical to ensure complete recoveries of adsorbed material. Proton NMR studies of the column eluates from both carbon and C18 bonded silica gel extraction cartridges revealed differences in capacity and selectivity following the application of ibuprofen containing metabolite samples.", 
    "70": "Functional stability of the peritoneum is essential for patients on long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatment. Sixteen patients on CAPD treatment for at least 4 years were studied. Their mean age was 47 +/- 15 years, 5 were males, and none were diabetic. Residual creatinine clearance at the beginning was 2.1 +/- 2.6 mL/min. Once yearly since starting CAPD, we have evaluated their peritoneal ultrafiltration (UF) and diffusion capacities by calculating the peritoneal mass transfer coefficient (MTC, mL/min) for urea and creatinine. Patients were categorized so that we could distinguish the effect of peritonitis, betablockers, and hypertension. For all patients the average initial and final MTCs and UF values were not different. Early episodes of peritonitis (those occurring less than 36 months after starting CAPD) did not influence long-term function. However, late peritonitis (occurring greater than 36 months since initiation) induced a decrease in urea-MTC (22.3 +/- 6 to 15.8 +/- 3.9, p less than 0.05), creatinine-MTC (9.4 +/- 3.1 to 7.4 +/- 2.5, p less than 0.05), and a corresponding increase in UF (1.25 +/- 0.4 to 1.4 +/- 0.3, mL/min, p less than 0.05). Age, sex, betablockers and hypertension did not influence the peritoneal parameters followed. After 5 years on CAPD, functional stability of the peritoneum is evident, except for patients who suffer late episodes of peritonitis. We speculate that the peritoneum in patients who have been on long-term CAPD are more susceptible to injuries, such as peritonitis, and that this results in functional deterioration.", 
    "71": "Twelve DSM-IIIR diagnosed schizophrenics, with neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA), were treated with either propranolol or matched placebo for two days, followed by a treatment crossover phase for five more days. Raters and patients were \"blind\" to treatment. This study shows that 120 mg of propranolol a day is more effective than placebo in reducing akathisia, and that propranolol's antiakathisic effect may require several days of treatment.", 
    "72": "Ocular irritation studies are important in the safety evaluation of ocular formulations. There are many reports on acute ocular irritation studies, but almost nothing about prolonged ocular instillation of ophthalmic formulations. This report discusses the predominantly lymphocytic infiltrates seen in the limbus corneae and eyelids of dogs treated with 1 and 2% solutions of L-653,328, an ocular hypotensive beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, for up to 53 weeks. The number of animals affected and severity of the lesions increased with time and concentration. A minimal effect was seen microscopically with the 2% solution as early as 14 weeks. Rabbits treated similarly for 14 weeks had no such changes. The first and only clinical sign in dogs was diffuse pinkness of the bulbar conjunctiva seen from Drug Week 22 onwards. Although not seen with similar molecular structures, given the equivocal results in sensitization studies and the long time required for the development of change, delayed contact hypersensitivity was suspected as the cause of the ocular infiltrates. Simple chronic irritation was not ruled out, however. These findings suggest that delayed contact hypersensitivity in dogs may be a phenomenon not limited to skin, but may also involve the eye after repeated ocular instillation.", 
    "73": "The interaction of a series of beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents with unilamellar dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) liposomes has been studied by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) in the presence of praseodymium cation (Pr3+) at 30 degrees C. Addition of Pr3+ increased the splitting of the trimethylammonium group signals arising from the phospholipid molecules located at the internal and external surfaces of the bilayers. Adding Pr3+ caused a considerable downfield shift of the external peak but only a slight upfield shift of the internal peak (approximately 3%). The difference in chemical shift of the external and internal peaks (delta Hz) increased linearly as a function of Pr3+ concentration up to 10 mM. The addition of beta-blockers reversed the effect of Pr3+, and propranolol exerted the most pronounced effect, causing complete reversal of the splitting at a concentration of 5 mM. Much higher concentrations of other beta-blockers were required to displace Pr3+. A linear correlation between Pr3+ displacement (P) and logarithm of the apparent partition coefficient (K'm) in DMPC liposomes was obtained for hydrophobic beta-blockers, but hydrophilic beta-blockers did not fit this correlation. It appears that beta-blockers that have ortho or meta substitution require penetration of the liposome bilayers before significant polar group interaction can occur. On the other hand, beta-blockers that have para substitution and low K'm values are able to interact with the polar surfaces of the liposomes without penetration to cause displacement of Pr3+.", 
    "74": "The effect of exploitation and adrenergic system drugs on sexual reflexes and properties of the semen in somatically mature Polish Large White boars has been presented. At the first stage 8 males were exploited twice a week. Then, previous to semen collection, the animals were given beta-adrenolytic (Propranolol--Polfa), after 30 minutes followed by the preparation Levonor--Polfa (alpha-adrenomimetic). 15 minutes after last injection the semen was collected, this procedure having been repeated twice a week. At the second stage of the experiment the same males were exploited once a week. Like in the first stage, the animals were given the same doses of the drugs in the same sequence. 15 minutes after last injection the semen was collected once a week. At the third stage of the experiment the boars were exploited every day. Again, like in the previous stages, the animals were given the above mentioned beta-adrenolytic and alpha-adrenomimetic to collect the semen 15 minutes after last injection. In all the stages of the experiment 6-8 ejaculates were collected from each boar. Apart from preliminary assessment of concentration and morphology of spermatozoons there was determined the level of protein and activity of selected enzymes in the semen. The sexual drive as well as the time of searching reflex and ejaculation were observed. The drugs applied have been proved to be able to prolong the time of ejaculation reflex. Simultaneous application of beta-adrenolytic and alpha-adrenomimetic to animals exploited twice a week appeared to increase the number of spermatozoons in the whole ejaculate, the percentage of spermatozoons with proper movement and the activity of GGT and fucosidase. Intensive exploitation of a boar with parallel application of the preparations described bring about a gradual decrease in spermatozoons and protein in the ejaculate as well as in the activity of hyaluronidase in its plasma and in conversion to mg protein of semen plasma.", 
    "75": "The stereoselectivity of carvedilol, a novel beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and vasodilator with one asymmetric carbon atom, was examined at alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors in vitro and in vivo. (-)-(S)-Carvedilol is a potent, competitive antagonist of the beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic response to isoproterenol in guinea pig atrium, with a dissociation constant (KB) of 0.4 nM. (+)-(R)-Carvedilol was more than 100-fold less potent than the (-)-S-enantiomer as an antagonist of beta 1-andrenoceptors, having a KB of approximately 45 nM. Consistent with these findings (-)-(S)-carvedilol (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) produced a 25-fold rightward shift in the beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic response to isoproterenol in pithed rats, whereas the (+)-R-enantiomer had no beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity in vivo at this dose. In contrast to the marked degree of stereoselectivity observed at beta 1-adrenoceptors, both (-)-(S)- and (+)-(R)-carvedilol produced equal antagonism of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine in rabbit aorta, with KB values of 14 and 16 nM, respectively. Furthermore, in the pithed rat, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor dose-response curve to cirazoline was shifted approximately 6-fold to the right by both the (+)-R- and (-)-S-enantiomers of carvedilol at a dose of 1 mg/kg, i.v. In anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats, (-)-(S)-carvedilol was 6-fold more potent as an antihypertensive than (+)-(R)-carvedilol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "Beta-blockers are widely used in the primary open angle glaucoma treatment. The molecular mechanism by which these drugs reduce intraocular pressure is essentially based on the blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors localized on the ciliary processes. Vascular effects of beta-blockers, which are difficult to exhibit clinically, have been recently reported for some drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. In this study, we attempted to investigate the presence of beta-adrenergic specific binding sites on the human retinal vessels, by means of an in vitro autoradiographic technique. These receptors are localized both on arteries and veins; displacement studies indicated that they are mainly of beta-2 subtype.", 
    "77": "(-)-[125I]-Iodocyanopindolol [-)ICYP), used to characterize beta adrenoceptors on membrane preparations from rat cerebral cortex, was shown to have affinity for both beta adrenoceptors and serotonin receptors. Therefore, 10 microM serotonin was added to the assays to prevent (-)ICYP binding to serotonin receptors. Under these conditions, (-)ICYP binding to the cortical membrane preparation was reversible and saturable, and the association reaction was very slow. The dissociation reaction was also very slow, and revealed two affinity states corresponding to a high and a low affinity state. Scatchard analysis showed a single class of binding sites with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 20.7 pM, and a maximal density of binding sites (Bmax) of 95.1 fmol/mg membrane protein. Displacement binding analyses revealed a potency series of (-) isoproterenol greater than (-) epinephrine equal to (-) norepinephrine, suggesting a predominance of the beta 1 adrenoceptor subtype. Detailed competition ligand binding studies with the selective beta 1 adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-89406 and the selective beta 2 adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118551, showed that about 70% of the beta adrenoceptor population in the rat cortex is of the beta 1 subtype with the remainder being of the beta 2 subtype. We conclude that since (-)ICYP binds to both beta adrenoceptors and serotonin receptors, it is important to prevent the binding of (-)ICYP to serotonin receptors by adding a suppressing ligand like excess cold serotonin when assaying beta adrenoceptors. We have presented the first such characterization of rat cerebral cortical beta adrenoceptors with (-)ICYP in this study.", 
    "78": "The effects of i.v. administration of metipranolol (Trimepranol, Biotika; 0.03; 0.15 and 0.3 mg.kg-1) and saline (1.0 ml.kg-1) on the cardiovascular system of rabbits in vivo have been determined under the conditions of the paced and non-paced heart. The administration of saline in the control group led to a mild decrease of dP/dtmax, minute blood flow through the abdominal aorta and slowing-down the cardiac frequency without significant changes in blood pressure in a. femoralis and stroke blood flow through the abdominal aorta. No practically important differences between the paced and non-paced conditions were found. The administration of Trimepranol led to a significant, dose dependent decrease in dP/dtmax, which was less expressed in the paced heart (in comparison with the non-paced heart) after the lowest dose of the drug; no such a difference was found after higher doses of Trimepranol. Reactions of blood pressure (no significant changes) and minute blood flow through the abdominal aorta (a mild decrease) to the administration of Trimepranol were similar both in the paced and in non-paced heart. A significant slowing-down of the spontaneous cardiac frequency after Trimepranol was dose-dependent and, in relation to this fact, a significant increase in stroke blood flow through the abdominal aorta was found. On the basis of the above-mentioned results, it is possible to conclude that the paced heart conditions do not unfavourably influence the effects of Trimepranol on the cardiovascular system of rabbits in vivo.", 
    "79": "With the purpose of obtaining new compounds with antiarrhythmic activity, nine novel aminoalkanol derivatives of 5H-furo[3,2-g] [1]benzopyran-5-one were synthetized. In pharmacological studies, compound IX proved to display strong antiarrhythmic action, which in chloroform-induced arrhythmia was stronger from that of propranolol at three times lower acute toxicity.", 
    "80": "Blood pressure variability has been known in the cardiovascular clinic for a long time. The mechanisms of the variations are largely unknown; it was the aim of the present work to approach this question. In a first group of studies, the role of the adrenergic receptors was examined. The results have shown that the adrenergic system does not play an important role in this phenomenon as administration of beta and of alpha blocking agents is unable to diminish the amplitude of the blood pressure variations; this was confirmed by other studies showing no correlation between blood pressure variability and the response to sympathetic function tests. However, there was a positive correlation with the level of blood pressure. In a second part, the role of the cholinergic system was investigated; atropine was found to diminish, both in dogs as in men, the amplitude of blood pressure variability. No decrease of blood pressure variability was seen with calcium antagonists. Thus, blood pressure variability is depending on the level of blood pressure and cholinergic activity; since these mechanisms only explain part of blood pressure variability, further research will be needed to unravel this challenging question.", 
    "81": "The phenomenon of \"learned helplessness\" is characterized by elements of motor, cognitive and emotional deficit, and it is particularly suitable to be used as a \"model\" of behavioural depression. There is no doubt about the central role of the cerebral noradrenaline and serotonin in the stress-induced behavioural deficit. The effects of two known beta-adrenoceptor agonists--salbutamol and trimetoquinol--and the beta-adrenergic blockers propranolol and compound 3B, with beta-blocking activity equipotent to that of propranolol, were investigated under conditions of \"prophylactic\" and \"therapeutic\" administration in rats subjected to stress by modelling of the behaviour of learned helplessness. Among the serotoninergic agents, the effects of 5-hydroxytryptophane and of the inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, parachlorophenylalanine, were studied. The experimental results show a favourable effect on the behavioural deficit, caused by the blocking of the adrenergic transmitter system and by increasing the activity of the serotoninergic system.", 
    "82": "1. In order to determine the selectivity of classical and novel adrenergic agents for alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors in brown adipose tissue, the ability of these agents to compete for binding sites labelled with [3H]prazosin and [3H]CGP-12177, respectively, was investigated. 2. The beta-antagonist propranolol, known to inhibit norepinephrine-induced respiration in micromolar concentrations, bound to the [3H]CGP-12177 site with nanomolar affinity. 3. Among agonists, only isoprenaline showed high selectivity for beta-receptors, and only oxymetazoline for alpha 1-receptors. 4. Unexpectedly, the novel thermogenic agonists (BRL-agonists), shown to be potent and selective stimulators of brown fat thermogenesis, were unselective and bound only with low affinity to the [3H]CGP-12177 binding sites. 5. These results suggest that the beta-adrenergic binding site in brown adipose tissue identified here with [3H]CGP-12177 may not be the one (or not the only one) coupled to thermogenesis.", 
    "83": "1. Cardiac adrenergic receptors in a frog, Rana tigrina, were examined in winter and summer months using isolated atria preparation maintained at 24 degrees, 14 degrees and 6 degrees C. Treatments included an examination of the atrial responses to selective alpha and beta adrenergic agonists (phenylephrine and isoproterenol respectively) and antagonists (phentolamine and propranolol). 2. Basal atrial beating rates differed between summer and winter months and increased with temperature. 3. Phenylephrine produced dose-dependent increases in the atrial beating rate and tension in the winter frogs only at 6 degrees C. These increases were blunted by phentolamine. 4. Isoproterenol produced positive chronotropic effects of 14 degrees and 24 degrees C but not at 6 degrees C in both summer and winter frogs; these effects were abolished by propranolol. Further, at 6 degrees C, the contractile response of the atrial tissue to isoproterenol was very sensitive. 5. Data suggests that the alpha adrenoceptor might be physiologically important to the frog in the low temperature environment of the cold season, during which period the cardiac beta adrenergic activity would be minimal or even absent.", 
    "84": "Normalizing rheological deficits may enhance perfusion. Both betablockers and calcium antagonists induce such effects in various populations due to differing mechanisms. In the case of calcium antagonists, this could synergistically contribute to a reduction of the peripheral resistance, predominantly caused by vascular changes. This hypothesis requires experimental testing."
